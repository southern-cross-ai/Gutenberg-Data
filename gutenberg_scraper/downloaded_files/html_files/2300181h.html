<h2>ABOUT THE AUTHOR</h2>

<p class="first">British-born and educated at Berlin and Oxford,
Ernest Favenc (1845-1908; the name is of Huguenot origin) arrived
in Australia aged 19, and while working on cattle and sheep
stations in Queensland wrote occasional stories for the
<i>Queenslander</i>. In 1877 the newspaper sponsored an
expedition to discover a viable railway route from Adelaide to
Darwin, which was led by Favenc. He later undertook further
explorations, and then moved to Sydney.</p>

<p>He wrote some novels and poems and a great many short stories,
reputedly 300 or so. Three volumes of his stories were published
in his lifetime:</p>

<p><i>The Last of Six, Tales of the Austral Tropics</i>, 1893</p>

<p><i>Tales of the Austral Tropics</i>, 1894</p>

<p><i>My Only Murder and Other Tales</i>, 1899</p>
<br>

<p>His short stories range from bush humor to horror,
supernatural to strange, and to the privations of late 19th
century exploration in Australia's unforgiving inland. His first
two short story books (consolidated into one volume, as there is
considerable overlap), are available free as an ebook from
Project Gutenberg Australia.</p>

<h2><a id="ch1"></a>01. &mdash; THOSE DISSIPATED COWS</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, 12 Sep 1896</h3>

<p class="first">
'DID I ever tell you about Mrs. Birrell and her milkers?'
asked Jim one evening, when the mosquitos were especially
annoying.</p>

<p>'No; another flame of yours?'</p>

<p>'Flame be hanged! She was old enough to be my grandmother.
Birrell and his wife had a farm up north, in the sugar country.
Both of 'em were a bit ratty. He had a notion of matching plaid
match boxes, making the top and bottom Join evenly according to
the pattern. Did you ever try it! Yes, of course you have, and
never succeeded, no more did anybody. Well, when old Birrell had
wasted two years at this game he went off his chump, and insisted
that people's heads didn't fit their bodies and wanted to screw
'em round till they did; so they had to send him to the asylum,
and the store keeper of that part said it was an outrage on the
liberty of the subject. When he was in his cups he let out that
old Birrell used to buy his matches from him by the gross, and as
he never wanted to strike any, the storekeeper bought worthless
stock, so when Birrell went into retirement the storekeeper lost
a little income.</p>

<p>Old Mrs. Birrell's fad was temperance&mdash;rabid
teetotalism&mdash;and when the old man went away she had the land
they had planted with cane ploughed up and put under grass and
lucerne, because rum was made from cane juice.</p>

<p>'She was more consistent than the big brewers, at any rate,' I
said.</p>

<p>'Oh the old woman was quite honest, but her cows&mdash;and a
very nice milking herd they had&mdash;did not approve of the
change, because they had got used to eating the trash, and when
cattle take to that it's just like opium with a man. So when they
found their supply stopped they just knocked the slip rails down,
and went out and joined the other vagrant cows who picked up a
living on the road. When the carts came by with cane going to the
mill they used to follow them up and help themselves from the
tail. This went on for some time, and the old cows began to fancy
this vagabond kind of existence, and forgot to come home early,
and got regular rakish-looking. One afternoon Mrs. Birrell was
driving home, when she came across some cows, and she thought she
was dreaming. There was one of her best-behaved milkers, 'Mother
Hubbard,' fighting a pitched battle with a low little rat of a
cow, with a white back and liver-colored sides. Mother Hubbard
charged her adversary into a wire fence, and bent down two panels
of it; then she commenced to cavort round and trumpet. The old
woman had just got over the horror of this, when she saw another
of her pets with a damaged eye and other signs of bad behavior.
The old woman was plucked. She got down and drafted those erring
cattle out of the others on foot with the buggy whip. Then she
started them on ahead of her and drove after them till they came
to the slip rails. She turned them in, put the rails up, and went
smack off into a faint.</p>

<p>'I had my team there at the time breaking up the ground for
'em. There was a fellow there milking and doing odd jobs for the
Birrells. He was a broken-down swell, and he used to come out and
give me a hand at times&mdash;said he found my conversation
interesting when I wasn't too digressive. Well, as luck would
have it, we were close by, and got her round and helped her to
the house.</p>

<p>'"O Jim!" she said; "isn't it an awful thing those animals
going out of their nature to abuse the gifts of God. I assure
you, Parkes, that I found those cows in the road reeling drunk
and fighting with disreputable cattle from the township."</p>

<p>'I tried to cheer her up, told her that they were only a bit
lively after a feed of cane which they'd been used to; and the
'Wreck' he pitched a lot of yarns about elephants always getting
an allowance of toddy when they were working. But she was very
miserable over the falling away of her cows, and told the Wreck
to go and make new pegs for the rails and wedge them in tight.
That afternoon she sent the Wreck into the township with a
message to the storekeeper, and he came back with about twenty
yards, more or less, of blue ribbon. This she ornamented the cows
with when they were brought up in the evening, and after telling
them to be good and she would forgive them, they were turned out.
But you can't lick a knowing old milker for getting slip rails
down, and the next morning the Wreck had to go down the road ever
so far for them, and sort them out of their dissolute companions.
This was most unfortunate, for he met a friend, and they had
several rums together, so the Wreck came back with the cows
rather owly. Worse still, the friend gave him a bottle of white
rum, and he brought that back inside his shirt. Then he sat down
to milk. He got on very well with Mother Hubbard and another cow,
and then, as he told me afterwards, he began to think of his
misspent past, and it preyed on his mind to such an extent that
he felt he must have another nip to bear up against the painful
memory. He took out the bottle and had a tidy swig. Then a
brilliant idea awoke in his besotted brain, and he emptied the
contents of the bottle into the half bucket of milk he had
between his knees. Now just as luck would have it, I came up at
that time with a pannikin to get some milk for my breakfast, and
he hadn't time to bide the bottle.</p>

<p>'"Shim," he said, "milk's got staronary taste this mornin';
shust you try it, o' feller."</p>

<p>'I tried a pannikin of it, and real good it was. I had just
finished, when Mrs. Birrell came in to the yard, and wanted to
know how the cows were that morning.</p>

<p>'"Found 'em milesh away," said the Wreck. "Shee here, empty
bottle with them;" and he held up the dead marine.</p>

<p>'Mrs. Birrell looked hard at him; then at me.</p>

<p>'"Milk has got a queer taste this morning, Mrs. Birrell," I
said.</p>

<p>'"Let me taste it."</p>

<p>'I dipped out half a pannikin full, and she sipped and sipped
until it was gone.</p>

<p>'"It has a strange taste," she said. "And oh my! there's all
their ribbons gone and twisted and mucked up. Isn't it shocking
when even the beasts of the field are led astray by the accursed
thing!"</p>

<p>'The Wreck took advantage of the opportunity to take another
pannikin of the milk, to make sure of the queer taste. He handed
me the pannikin, and I had another lot, as it was a pity to see
it wasted. The Wreck supported himself against the calf-pen, and
remarked, "Allshrunkashkloee;" then he slid down in a sitting
position, with his legs like the letter V, and went to sleep. He
meant to say "All drunk as Chloe," meaning the cows, but the will
was better than the deed. Mrs. Birrell had a little more of the
milk. Then she began to cry; said she was worse off than a widow,
and that her own cows went back on her and got shamelessly
intoxicated, and would I help her indoors. I took the old dame
in, got another bucket, and finished milking. I put what was left
in the first bucket safely away, as I thought, but while I was
busy, blest if one of the calves didn't nose it out, put his head
in the bucket, and drank every blooming, drop. In about ten
minutes he was as drunk as a fiddler, and commenced playing up
old top ropes.</p>

<p>'There was a nice situation for a temperance household! The
Wreck asleep in the calf-pen, Mrs. Birrell camped indoors, and a
drunken bull calf in charge of the paddock. Just then the parson
rode up, for it was getting late.</p>

<p>'"Good morning, Parkes. Is Mrs. Birrell in?" he asked, getting
off his horse. I. was just saying that she was a little unwell,
when that intoxicated calf took offence at the minister's horse.
He gave two or three prances and a bellow, then prodded the poor
innocent nag fair in the ribs. Away he went down the paddock,
stepping on his bridle until he broke it. The calf kicked up his
heels and took after Jim, and all the others, as they will do,
did the same. The rails were down, for the Wreck had been too
muzzy to put them up, and into the road and away out of sight
went the whole crew, leaving the parson and me with our mouths
open like codfish. The parson said, that he would go in and see
Mrs. Birrell, and I let him go, for I wanted to have my laugh
out.</p>

<p>'Fortunately, the parson had been too much occupied with the
loss of his horse to notice the Wreck, and when I went in with
the milk I found Mrs. Birrell telling him all her troubles, and
asking him to pray for the misguided cows. The parson went away
on foot, quite mixed up, and it was soon all over the place that
there had been a nigh old spree at Birrell's farm, and the parson
had fallen off his horse, and all the rest of it. The Wreck made
it worse, for he endorsed every word that was said, and a lot
more; in fact, he managed to keep drunk for a week on the
strength of his yarns.</p>

<p>'It was some weeks before things got straight, and the cows
broken in to staying properly at home. Mrs. Birrell fired the
Wreck, and got a girl in to milk and then the cows made trouble
again, they were a misguided lot.</p>

<p>'I thought a girl was coming in,' I remarked. O! This had
nothing to do with me, but she was a study was that girl. She
told me that she liked milking because it was such a romantic
occupation, and did I think there was any harm in changing one's
name? I told her I believed there was no law against it, so she
confided to me that she thought her own name horrid&mdash;it was
plain Eliza Thomas. She'd seen a name in the "Answers to
Correspondents" in a paper. "Daisy Dimple." Didn't I think that
would do lovely? I said it would, but that people might make fun
of it, and call her "Pimple."</p>

<p>'After that she didn't confide in me.</p>

<p>After Eliza had been there some time, a travelling
photographer came round. He wanted to take some views of the
farm, so I gave him the wrinkle to propose the cows, who were in
favor again now, and Mrs. Birrell dropped to it, and ordered one
of Mother Hubbard and another cow. Eliza got hold of that
photographer, and he promised he would take the cows in the
morning, when, they were being milked. Sure enough, when I was
yoking, up the bullocks in the next yard, I saw a sight that
nearly made me scream. How the deuce the girl had managed it I
don't know, but there she was tricked out in a sort of Dolly
Varden dress, with a little wooden bucket, and a three-legged
stool all complete. She posed herself alongside the cow, and
looked as killing and saucy as she could. Mrs. Birrell was not
well, and didn't turn up, so it all came off smoothly, and the
photo-man was very complimentary, and in a day or two he came
back with proofs.</p>

<p>'Now poor Mrs. Birrell's eyes were getting weak, and the
photos were pretty smeary, and when she looked at 'em she could
make out nothing but a cow's head and tall, and a petticoat.
Lord! the poor old woman went on worse than ever. She said the
devil had surely got into those cows for her sins, and that they
were sending her in sorrow to her grave. They had given up drink
and taken to fine dress, and were a lot of painted Jezebels.
Eliza, however, was quite charmed, and took some of the copies,
but Mrs. Birrell wouldn't have any, or pay for any. This made the
photographer wild, and he printed a lot, and sold them in the
township as a portrait of Mrs. Birrell and her cows. Everybody
thought that the old woman must be as mad as her husband, and the
parson came and lectured her on the vanity of it, and the sin of
dressing herself up as a girl at her time of life, when she ought
to be thinking of the next world, and so on. This so upset the
old woman that she took to her bed.</p>

<p>'Eliza heard the yarn, and she was so put out at being
mistaken for Mrs. Birrell that she gave notice straight away, and
married the Wreck, who had just had a remittance sent out to pay
his passage home, and was busy drinking it. Yes, those cows had a
kind of bad luck about them. That bull calf that got drunk, he
chewed up a waistcoat of mine, leastways part of it. The Wreck
was there at the time I'd laid it down, and he was arguing with
me, and my back was turned. I got the best of him, and he was
spiteful.</p>

<p>'"You'd best get your waistcoat back, anyhow what's left of
it," he said, and walked away. I looked round, and there was that
calf chewing away, as though he was bound to get it finished in
record time, and had a bet on. There was a £5-note in the pocket,
and he'd mashed it all into pulp, and though I belted his ribs
with a yoke, the bank wouldn't recognise it. No, there never was
no luck about those cows, somehow.'</p>

<p class="verse">
I STOOD in the street at midnight,<br>
The pubs were shutting up fast;<br>
The moon shone over the township,<br>
And my shadow behind me cast.</p>

<p class="verse">
I saw its bright reflection<br>
On the galvanised roof-tops shine,<br>
Like bright ore with metal encrusted,<br>
From a rich galena mine.</p>

<p class="verse">
And far in the hazy distance,<br>
With a sparkling lurid sheen,<br>
Came the glare of the burning furnace<br>
That belonged to the crushing machine.</p>

<p class="verse">
As I felt in my empty pockets,<br>
And thought of my late career,<br>
A flood of reeling came o'er me.<br>
That was closely allied to beer.</p>

<p class="verse">
I thought what a vain creature man is,<br>
How bliss unalloyed he'll ne'er sip:<br>
Thus thinking, I turned into "Annie's,"<br>
To comfort myself with a nip.</p>

<p class="verse">
And I saw there a radiant female.<br>
With a wealth of greasy hair;<br>
She gave me no change for a shilling,<br>
Which seemed to me hardly fair.</p>

<p class="verse">
Soon my head was aching badly,<br>
The brandy was far from good;<br>
The houses seemed staggering madly,<br>
And reeling round me as I stood.</p>

<p class="verse">
The earth began rocking wildly,<br>
Like a storm-beaten vessel at sea,<br>
That to save me from utter destruction,<br>
I had to lay hold of a tree.</p>

<p class="verse">
As I lay in that haven of safety,<br>
And looked at the moon above,<br>
Seemed to me that her placid features<br>
Looked down with a smile of love.</p>

<p class="verse">
Seemed to me a wonderful symbol,<br>
Set up for all men to see,<br>
That when overburdened with liquor,<br>
They had better make fast to a tree.</p>

<h2><a id="ch3"></a>03. &mdash; THE GOLD KING</h3>

<h3>A NEW YEAR'S TALE</h3>

<h3>As by "Dramingo"</h3>

<h3><i>Queenslander</i>. 26 Dec 1874</h3>

<p class="first">
MULLUCKVILLE was anything but a lively township; like other
dogs it had had its day, and now that its day was done, the night
seemed to have descended doubly dark upon the wretched spot. Some
years before, a wandering prospector 'dropped upon' a small patch
of gold; rumor, as usual, magnified the amount of the find, and a
rush set in upon the doomed place.</p>

<p>In less than a month it had returned almost to its primitive
state of solitude. The hastily run up stores and public houses
had been taken down, the less pretentious habitations of bark and
saplings had been left to fall to pieces at leisure by their
original constructors, and but one place, which combined within
itself the attractions both of store and public house, remained
to supply the wants of the few fossickers who still struggled for
a living and the chance of a haul. It will therefore be seen that
Mulluckville was scarcely a township wherein any man whose
unhappy lot did not foredoom it, would choose of his own accord
to spend the festive season which is supposed to usher in a new
year.</p>

<p>Tom Duval was perhaps the most wretched specimen of humanity
to be found in Mulluckville on the particular New Year's Eve I am
writing of. He had come with the rush, and had remained there
ever since; his periodical earnings, scanty as they were, were
all sacrificed at the altar of Bacchus. The time had been when
Tom was a comparatively respectable member of society; but
sobriety and he had long since cut one another, and
now&mdash;well, he was scarcely a desirable acquaintance.</p>

<p>The clock struck 11. Tom looked out of the door of the public
house, and into the cool fresh night. His own funds were
exhausted; few of the residents of Mulluckville were in a
condition to shout, and he had not yet reached the condition in
which he delighted to go to bed. He snuffed the night air for a
few moments, then turned his head and looked back into the
bar&mdash;longingly he looked at the bottles, beseechingly at the
proprietor, contemptuously at the only other customer, who had
money and would not spend it; then, like a blast, away he passed
out into the night.</p>

<p>Adown the rambling apology for a street, haunted on either
hand by the skeletons of houses, or the more substantial-looking
ghosts of bark humpies; but they were but dead ghosts the souls
that had inhabited them had passed away, and were making merry
elsewhere. No publican in snowy shirt came and asked him to step
in as he passed, no songs echoed from the interiors. Here and
there flickering campfires shone out; but the owners were
courting sleep, and dreaming of the fortunes their picks were yet
to win for them.</p>

<p>Tom sauntered on until the dark mounds of earth around told of
the search for gold. He reached the old claim of the lucky
prospector, and in a fit of spleen cursed his luck for not having
been the man to strike it. Musing on his bad fortune, he ascended
the rugged pile of dirt, and throwing himself down on the top,
gazed into the black mouth of the shaft.</p>

<p>"I've a good mind to take a header into it," he thought; but
like a good many men before him, he had a better mind not to do
so, so remained where he was.</p>

<p>"How light it seems down there!" was the next thought that
crossed his mind, and then the unmistakable sound of human voices
struck upon his ear. He lifted his head and
listened&mdash;silence all around!</p>

<p>Again he stooped his head into the shaft, and heard the murmur
of many voices. "There must be a lot of fellows up the drive." He
listened intently; a burst of laughter, a short silence, and then
a wonderfully clear and powerful voice began singing&mdash;</p>

<br>
<p class="verse">
Go March through the page<br>
Of a long-past age<br>
For a despot with power untold,<br>
And find, if you can,<br>
Since the world began,<br>
A king with such power as gold.</p>

<p class="verse">
There's no tie so true<br>
I cannot undo,<br>
No secret I can't unfold&mdash;<br>
As for beauty and mirth,<br>
Pride, valor, and worth,<br>
They are all of them slave to gold.</p>

<br>

<p>At the end of each verse a chorus of many voices took up the
last line, and repeated it as a refrain; then again the singer
went on&mdash;</p>

<p class="verse">
I humbled the proud,<br>
And can laugh aloud<br>
At the childish tales that are told<br>
Of honor unbought;<br>
For to me 'tis but sport<br>
To beat down honor with gold. </i></p>

<p class="verse">
I have great and small<br>
At my beck and call,<br>
Men's hearts at my will I mould;<br>
Look all the world round,<br>
Men will ever be found<br>
To barter their souls for gold. </i></p>

<br>

<p>The song ended, and a short silence succeeded; then a glare of
light suddenly shone in the bottom of the shaft, as though a door
in the side had been opened. A dark figure crossed this path of
light, a strange scrambling noise followed, and before Tom could
recover from his surprise, or attempt flight, the figure was
beside him.</p>

<p>"Come," said a deep voice, and a hand was laid on his
shoulder&mdash;such a hand! the fingers, hard as steel, seemed to
bury themselves into his flesh, and he felt there was no escape.
The figure caught him up in its strong arms, and the next moment
they stood at the bottom of the old shaft. He followed his guide
on hands and knees along the drive at the bottom, too astonished
for words or resistance; they paused through a door at the end,
and Tom saw a scene such as mortal ne'er saw before:</p>

<p>A man&mdash;a golden man apparently&mdash;sat in regal state
at the head of a long table. Opposed to him, at the foot, was a
being of silver; and ranged down both sides were forms and
figures of such dazzling lustre that Tom's bloodshot eyes winked
again. It was not their dresses that caused the splendid effect;
the light and brilliance seemed to radiate from their faces;
their eyes emitted flashes like lightening, and glancing down the
board, every color and shade of color sparkled in rays of fire
from these strange creatures.</p>

<p>Tom's guide left him standing a few paced from the entrance,
and took a vacant seat on the king's right hand. Tom saw that he
was a gigantic being; his features were noble and stern-looking,
though his color was jet-black&mdash;not a dull black, but bright
and sparkling; at intervals, his face seemed to glow like heated
metal. On the left hand of the king was a precisely similar
figure.</p>

<p>Of the king's face, Tom could make nothing; it seemed be
changing from a man to a woman's, from a soldier's to a priest's,
but through them all, the lips wore a sneer. Although they all
seemed carousing, and the table was covered with eatables and
flasks of wine, their faces bore no trace of mirth, but one and
all looked hard and stern. They all turned their blazing eyes
upon Tom as he stood there a picture of human degradation; and
the king, after an earnest gaze at him, as he stood bewildered
where hid guide had left him, with a grim smile said, "What's
yours?"</p>

<p>Never before had Tom been at a loss for an answer to such a
question. Now his tongue failed, and conscious that the whole of
that brilliant company were looking mockingly at him, he could
only at last feebly stammer, "Whatever you like."</p>

<p>At a sign from the king, the dark right hand man arose, and
filling a glass with some colorless liquid, approached Tom and
offered it to him. Nerved by the thought that nothing could make
his situation much worse, Tom, whom no liquor ever daunted
before, seized the glass and swallowed the contents. Instantly
his frame grew light and buoyant, a warm glow coursed through
every vein; he was a new man.</p>

<p>"Shake yourself," said the king. He did so, and as he said
afterwards, "shook his body off." Yes; surely that was dirty,
drunken Tom Duval lying in a heap on the ground. Then what was
he? He could not tell; he only knew that he looked with
unutterable loathing on his late body, now lying motionless and
lifeless at his feet.</p>

<p>"His body was found huddled up in a heap at the bottom of a
deserted shaft, and he was supposed to have fallen down during
one of his drunken fits. A verdict of accidental death was
returned," said the king, in a sing-song voice, as though reading
from a newspaper.</p>

<p>Tom shuddered; the figure on the floor looked horribly like a
corpse. The king arose, and looking at a clock, said:</p>

<p>"My friends, here's to our next meeting&mdash;this day twelve
months."</p>

<p>The glasses were filled and emptied.</p>

<p>"Five minutes to twelve. Good-night, all," said the silver
man, and vanished.</p>

<p>"Good-night!" re-echoed through the cavern, and the golden
king and Tom were alone.</p>

<p>"Come with me," the king said, beckoning to him, and opening a
door at one end of the cavern. Tom advanced, and followed him
through.</p>

<p>Instantly he found himself flying through space and utter
darkness with frightful rapidity. A sudden shock brought him to a
halt, and he was conscious that the king was beside him, opening
a door, through which a stream of light gushed out.</p>

<p>"We are now in the centre of the earth," said the king,
pausing with the half-opened door in his hand. Somehow Tom felt
no whit astonished at the information. They entered. In a vast
hall, like the interior of some mighty cathedral, a venerable old
man was seated in an easy chair, before a brightly burning fire;
his long white beard hung down upon the ground, and he sat and
gazed into the fire in a drowsy, abstracted manner, with half
shut eyes. A short distance from him, a very dirty man was
writing with great haste on the last page of a thick volume.
Neither of them took the slightest notice of the king or his
companion as they advanced towards the fire.</p>

<p>Gold stationed himself in front of the fireplace, his back to
the warmth, and nodded to Tom to take possession of an unoccupied
chair standing near. He did so, and his attention was soon taken
up watching the strange freaks the burning embers seemed to be
playing. Like living things, the glowing coals climbed up over
each other, changed, and altered their positions until they had
formed what appeared to Tom to be the model of a fair town. As he
looked, the likeness grew more and more distinct&mdash;stately
buildings, beautiful churches, and wide streets shone out in
miniature. All appeared perfect, when the old man in the chair
slightly waved his hands, with a low laugh, and they all crumbled
into ashes.</p>

<p>A noise at the far end of the hall diverted his gaze from
these strange proceedings. He looked and saw a number of men rush
in, laden with large sacks, the contents of which they emptied on
to the floor. These contents appeared to be thousands of pieces
of white paper, and the heap thus formed soon began to assume
astonishing dimensions.</p>

<p>"What can they be," thought Tom.</p>

<p>"Good resolutions," said the king, answering his unspoken
thought. "But they'll come to nothing, heaps of them every year.
His successor," and he nodded towards the silent figure still
writing as though for life, "will put them through a
refinery."</p>

<p>"Phryne!" said the ancient figure in the chair, apparently
starting up out of deep musings. "The naughty little flirt! I
remember her well; but she hadn't half the figure Cleopatra had,"
and he chuckled feebly.</p>

<p>"Pshaw!" said Gold. "I know as much about them as you do," and
he glanced contemptuously at the other. But the old man went on
mumbling out aloud, "Yes, yes! She stood out a long time; but I
was too much for her. Couldn't beat Old Time."</p>

<p>The door through which Tom and the king had entered here
opened, and a man walked in, so like the man writing at the table
that Tom started. In all respects save one, they were exactly
similar, and that one was, that whilst one was outrageously dirty
(in fact, seemed rapidly growing worse), the new comer was
painfully clean and neat. The new arrival walked up to the silent
figure still writing hard, and stood waiting beside him, glancing
once up to a clock over the fireplace. Tom looked up too, the
hands were nearly on the stroke of 12.</p>

<p>Everybody was silent, save the busy figures at the far end of
the hall. The seconds crept on, and suddenly a mighty boom burst
forth, reverberating through the lofty hall like
thunder&mdash;another and another. Time started from his
chair.</p>

<p>"Eh, what!" he said. "Bonaparte at it again?"</p>

<p>"Sit down," said Gold. "It's only the New Year."</p>

<p>At the sixth stroke, the dirty figure sprang from his chair,
and before the seventh could sound, the clean man had seized his
relinquished place and pen, and was hard at work on the first
page of a new volume. The relieved scribe came towards the fire,
yawning wearily, and nodded carelessly to Gold.</p>

<p>"Tired?" said the latter.</p>

<p>"Rather," returned the other.</p>

<p>"You've got to tell him all about it," and Gold nodded towards
Time.</p>

<p>"Yes; and he's getting deaf."</p>

<p>"He's a poor creature! Look at me, now, and I'm a tidy
age."</p>

<p>"Got an astonishing memory, though, when fairly awake."</p>

<p>"Well, I will leave you to 'vex his dull ear,' as Shakespeare,
who&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here Time woke up again with a screech.</p>

<p>"Shakespeare! I hate him. His confounded plays will see me out
yet."</p>

<p>Gold laughed, and beckoning Tom, passed out into black
darkness again, and then into a spacious cavern filled with naked
toiling gnomes They were working amongst gold, digging it up,
carting it away, and passing it from hand to hand. Strange to
say, Tom felt not the least desire to appropriate any of the
precious metal so carelessly kicked about.</p>

<p>The king threaded his way through the turmoil, until he
reached a desk where some were acting as clerks. One handed him a
paper. He read it, muttering over strange, outlandish names, and
some that seemed familiar to Tom's ears.</p>

<p>"Palmer, eh! Make it patchy there," he said, as he handed the
paper back. Then he waved his hand. The cavern and toiling
multitude had disappeared, and they were walking along the
crowded street of a town. Not once did the hurrying crowd of
passers appear to notice them; but Tom saw his companion slightly
touch some of them, and their faces assumed a joyous expression
at once. They went into a house, and on the stairs they
encountered a form coming down, upon whose face Tom felt that he
dared not look, and as he passed, the very air seemed to
freeze.</p>

<p>In the room they entered, mourners were weeping around a bed,
and the king took the cold hand of the dead, and gazed upon some
amongst the crowd, and self-satisfied smiles soon chased away the
tears; only those upon whom Gold did not look went out speaking
bitterly. They passed out, and into another house, where a man
was vainly pleading for the love of a beautiful girl; but she
averted her head, and would not listen to him. Then Gold looked
over the man's shoulder, and laughed bitterly; and when they
left, the coy fair one had turned so kind.</p>

<p>They went into a poor, mean house, where, in spite of poverty,
a happy family were laughing round the fireplace. Gold stood
amongst them, gazing into some of the smiling faces, and bitter
dissension broke out. Then they went into a quiet churchyard, and
the king, pointing to the rows of graves, said, "There, I have
no power."</p>

<p>Then they went into a large building, where there were many
men with vacant, foolish faces and some like wild beasts, and Tom
saw that they were all mad.</p>

<p>"Here," said the king, "my power is but small; but&mdash;" and
they passed into the street, and he pointed to the moving crowd,
"&mdash;these are all my subjects to save or destroy."</p>

<p>As he spoke, a poor girl passed them, hastening on with such a
look of despair in her face, that Tom's heart was wrung.</p>

<p>"Save her!" he cried. They overtook her as she reached a
bridge; but even as the king stooped to look into her face, she
sprang on to the parapet, and down into the river. Forgetting his
incorporeal existence, Tom would have followed, but his limbs
refused to obey. He turned to Gold. The king had thrown himself
down upon the pavement, and was whining pitifully.</p>

<p>Aghast at such a change, Tom stood gazing in astonishment; but
the moans soon died into deep curses.</p>

<p>"I cannot change human nature," he muttered sullenly, when he
arose. A great crowd now bore them along until they were in front
of a gloomy gaol, and in the open space arose the black beam
whereon a man was shortly to die, and the king again hid his
face, and moaned out that he "could not help human nature."</p>

<p>Then they went amongst great factories and foundries, and the
king pointed out the figures of the two black men he had seen at
the bottom of the shaft, though invisible to all others
beside.</p>

<p>"They are Coal and Iron," said he, "and they are my slaves;
but they are happier than I am."</p>

<p>"And the others," said Tom.</p>

<p>"There is one," said the king, as they passed again into the
street, and the silver figure glided by. "He, too, has good work
to do at times; but I!&mdash;am a curse, and you men make me
so."</p>

<p>He ground his teeth, and glanced at his companion so
wrathfully that Tom blessed his stars that he had no longer a
body upon which the king could wreak vengeance. They went into
balls and gay assemblies, and gliding unperceived amongst the
revelers, Tom saw many of the figures he had seen in the
cavern.</p>

<p>"Tom Duval," said the king, turning suddenly upon him, "do you
want to become the subject of a coroner's inquest?"</p>

<p>Tom reflected; life did not appear to be such an unmitigated
boon. But he answered, after a pause, "No."</p>

<p>"Then change your mode of life; there is still a chance
awaiting you. Forty yards due south from the old prospecting
claim, you will find what will help to lift you out of your
present state. Whatever you get, keep to yourself; and do not
bring a lot more fools there on a vain search. I have still five
minutes to spare; then you can go back to Mulluckville. And
remember, that as you use my gift, so will it bring you happiness
or&mdash;"</p>

<p>And the king looked significantly upon the ground.</p>

<p></p>

<p>"I LIKE coming here," said Gold. They were standing upon the
bank of a small creek, strange beautiful birds were in the
tree-tops, rich vegetation all around, overhead a cloudless blue
sky. On either side of them, gently sloping green hills arose,
and at the end of the valley that opened up before them they saw
bold ranges rising one above the other, terminating at the top in
picturesque peaks. No sign of man was anywhere to be seen. The
water trickling along the bed of the creek wound its way amongst
boulders of pure gold. Perfect peace and quiet seemed to
impregnate the balmy air that they were breathing. Flowers were
amidst the herbage on the ground, gaudy butterflies flitting from
one to the other. The king's face wore a look of great calm and
contentment.</p>

<p>"Once it was like this everywhere," he murmured.</p>

<p>"Where are we?" said Tom.</p>

<p>Gold turned suddenly and fiercely upon him. "Why do you ask?"
he screamed, harshly. "That you may bring your fellow-fiends, and
take from me the only spot of earth where I am left undisturbed?
But that you never shall."</p>

<p>Doubling his fist, he struck Tom on the head.</p>

<p></p>

<p>HE was lying on the edge of the old shaft in Mulluckville,
rubbing his head where he had struck it against the crazy
windlass. The sun was high and hot, and he felt very
uncomfortable.</p>

<p>Next morning he started to work, a changed man. Forty yards
from the old claim, he put down a shaft. When he had bottomed it,
Mulluckville knew him no more.</p>

<h2><a id="ch4"></a>04. &mdash; MORRISON'S BUGGY</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, 24 Oct 1896</h3>

<p class="first">
THE Morrisons, said Jim, always thought very highly of
themselves because they owned a buggy. It was a family affair,
this buggy. Old Morrison bought it when he was first married,
because his wife was a Powens, and could play the piano. She made
a point of it, that he must either buy a piano or a buggy before
she would condescend to marry him, and, as he thought the buggy
would be most useful, he bought the buggy.</p>

<p>In course of time it descended to his son, and, although it
had naturally seen its best days, still young Ben Morrison was
very proud of it, because you see he had been properly brought up
in the matter, and taught to respect it. He was always in a state
of alarm about it, and it's a wonder he didn't build a glass case
for it.</p>

<p>He lost a very nice girl indeed through the buggy&mdash;Bally
Braggins&mdash;she whose brother Tom once saw a man hanged. Awful
nuisance Tom was about it ever afterwards; you couldn't be in his
company ten minutes but that he wouldn't bring the conversation
round to executions. Sally, however, was a real nice girl, with
no nonsense about her, fresh and good-looking; the only thing
was, being a tall, well-made girl, she was a trifle heavy, and
the Morrisons were all undersized people, which was the reason, I
suppose, that Ben Morrison hung his hat up there.</p>

<p>There was to be some races, just a kind, of a picnic you know,
and Sal told Ben to drive round with his buggy and take her
there. Ben came round accordingly, and Sal came out, looking; as
pretty as a full blown sunflower, and got up. Ben's face fell
when she got in, and he kept hesitating and walking round the
buggy, and looking underneath before he got in himself, until at
last Sal asked him what on earth he was doing.</p>

<p>Then he, like a fool, up and asked her if she would sit nearer
the middle, for it was a trifle heavy on the spring, and he
misdoubted they might come to grief. If there was anything Sal
was touchy about it was her weight, and she bounced out as savage
as a meat axe. She miscalled Ben all the wizened little dwarfs
she could get her tongue round, and long Gavan happening to be
riding past, she hailed him and asked him to run her horse up
from the paddock and saddle him while she put her riding skirt
on; and off she went with Gavan.</p>

<p>'I wouldn't have minded it,', said Ben afterwards, 'if she
hadn't abused my buggy so. She well nigh blistered the paint on
it. Said it was an old shanderadan only fit for fowls to roost
on.</p>

<p>It was awful work when anyone wanted to borrow that buggy. Ben
would walk round and talk about the paint getting scratched, or
the wheels dirtied, and would go all over it with a screw-wrench
before he would let it out of his sight.</p>

<p>What a blow he got when old man Hitchins died. Young Hitchins
came to borrow the buggy, and Ben, thinking it was so that the
family would make a bit of a show following the hearse, lent it
without a word, never dreaming it was wanted to use as a hearse
itself. Fancy his feelings when he rode up himself, just as the
funeral procession was starting, and saw the seats had been taken
out of his buggy and the coffin put in. And there he had to ride
at a snail's gallop for two miles behind his own buggy turned
into a hearse.</p>

<p>'No,' he said to me afterwards, 'I'm not a particular man, but
I'd never have the brazen cheek to ask for the loan of a man's
private carriage to stow a corpse in. Too bad altogether.'</p>

<p>Poor Ben! He was bent on getting spliced, but the girls used
to poke such borak at each other about going to church, in
Morrison's hearse that he hadn't got a show. At last one Polly
Dancer took pity on him. Polly was going off a bit, so set up to
be a girl of sound common-sense, and talked of vanity and
worldliness a good deal; said she saw nothing wrong about the
buggy, except that it was a bit old-fashioned, but that didn't
matter, it would carry more than that flash trotting sulky Gavan
was always driving Sally Braggins about in.</p>

<p>So she let Morrison take her to church in it, although he was
on pins and needles all the time for fear that some one would
steal it while he was praying inside.</p>

<p>Polly Dancer soon became Mrs. Morrison, and Ben didn't do
badly, for, although she wasn't a patch on Sal for looks, and
nearly as old as Ben, she could work like a nigger and make
everyone else work too, and that '-was Just what Ben wanted.
Strange to say, she took to worshipping the old buggy near as bad
as her husband, until at last the two of 'em got so blooming
careful of the old rattletrap that they'd never use it. You know
how when a man's got a favorite horse, or cow, or worker, he
loves to go down and sit on a top rail and look at it along with
a mate. Not talk much, you know, only now and again a word, smoke
solemn-like, and throw in a sentence now and again. It's about as
joyful a way of spending a morning as I know.</p>

<p>Ben and his wife used to do just the same. They'd stand there
together, and admire that old buggy in a way you'd scarce credit.
Never seemed to get tired of it. They had a boy, and, as he got
old enough, he learned to idolise that 'ere buggy too, and then a
terrible thing happened. The buggy was stolen.</p>

<p>Stolen one dark night when it was raining cats and dogs; and a
good horse of Ben's as well. It was the talk of the place. People
went about discussing it, and some women went up to see Mrs.
Morrison, and found her in bed, with Ben keeping her spirits up
with gruel with a stick in it. Ben was woefully broken up, and
didn't seem to care a bit about the horse, which was worth
twenty, of the buggy. But nobody could make out what on earth
anybody could have stolen the buggy for, for the blamed thing
wasn't worth driving away.</p>

<p>Three days afterwards the bank was stuck up at Daintee Hill.
You remember, it was at night, and they tied up the manager and
accountant, and carted a small safe away that they hadn't time to
open, 'cause the manager slung the keys in the tank. Some of us
went in to moon about, like men will when they can't do any good.
I was talking to a trooper I knew when up came Morrison all
excited.</p>

<p>'Jack Davis,' he said to the trooper. 'Those villains stole my
buggy to carry that safe away, you mark my words; if they didn't
I can swear to the track of that buggy, anywhere. You take me
with you, and let's make a start.'</p>

<p>Jack Davis looked at me and we were both going to laugh at
Morrison, who seemed to think all the world was after his buggy,
when it struck us both at the same time: that perhaps there was
something in it. Just as likely as not, no other vehicle was
missing. Davis went and consulted his superior, and the upshot
was that the sergeant and he and Morrison went, off quietly
together.</p>

<p>They had a long bout of it, but Davis told me that Morrison
picked out the buggy track on the road when they got clear of the
township. He showed them a peculiar wobble by one of the wheels
by which they could tell it as well, although he said he knew it
without that.</p>

<p>It turned off, and they had a deuce of a job tracking it over
a low rocky range, but they came up with it at the end of the
second day. Too late; for the thieves had busted open the safe
and cleared off with the horses, leaving the buggy behind. Such a
buggy it was! Davis said he never saw such a scarecrow. The
weight of the safe had damaged one spring, so everything was all
askew, and one tyre was off, and altogether It was a ruin.</p>

<p>Morrison, however; was quite silly with joy. He went round the
buggy pitting it affectionately and asking the two men if she was
not a brave old girl, and hadn't she acted proud? He didn't seem
to care twopence about the money not being there, only he'd got
his buggy back. He wouldn't go any further with them, which
didn't matter as they didn't want him. So they started off on the
trail, and Morrison went to work wedging the tyre up, and he
never left that buggy until he got it safe home, and it took him
over three days to do it.</p>

<p>But it was through the buggy after all that the men were
caught, for the two troopers ran them down in thirty miles, with
most of the money on them. And it's a fact, if they had not taken
Morrison's buggy; but someone else's, they might have got away,
for nobody else would have made such an eternal fuss about it as
he did.</p>

<p>The bank was mighty well pleased, and would have given
Morrison a reward, but he wouldn't take it, and said that if they
would have a silver plate let into the buggy he would be more
than satisfied, and they did it.</p>

<p>After that Mr. and Mrs Morrison and their old-fashioned kid
thought more of it than ever, and used to visit it and stare at
it every evening; while Ben told his son how It would be his some
day, and how he must keep it as a precious thing all his life,
and the boy said he would.</p>

<p>Poor Ben, he got kicked by a horse he was shoeing about a
fortnight afterwards, and although he lingered for a long time,
the doctor held out no hope, and he gradually sank; but before he
died; he asked that his last bed might be made up in the buggy,
and it was; and there he died very quietly, and was taken to his
grave in it, patched up for the occasion.</p>

<p>About a year or eighteen months after that, what did that fool
of a woman do but get married again; and a nice sort of a loose
fish she married. A regular rackety, horse-racing, card-playing
wastrel. Luckily for her Ben, who was a sensible enough fellow
where the buggy was not concerned, had tied everything he had up
pretty tight, and she could not interfere with it for she only
held it in trust for the boy. This made, the fellow she had
married, a distant cousin of hers of the same name Dancer,
thundering wild, and he began to abuse her and the boy.</p>

<p>Of course; nobody could interfere, although they were willing
enough to do so, as Morrison had been a harmless little fellow,
and a good enough neighbor. Besides, he belonged to the place,
which this fellow Dancer did not: However, no one, as I say,
could interfere, and things, went on from bad to worse. But
Dancer did not get much from it, for Polly, seeing the bitter
mistake she'd made, hung on to everything for the sake of her
boy, and not a shilling more than she chose to give could either
curses or kicks or kisses get out of her. Then he thought of a
new plan to worry the soul out of her.</p>

<p>The old buggy had been straightened up for the funeral, as I
said before, and Dancer said one evening that he was going to
drive it in to the township. She begged and prayed him not to,
and at last consented to give him a cheque for a few pounds if he
wouldn't. He agreed; but when the devil had got the paper he
laughed at her, and went out, and took the boy with him to help
him harness up. He was going to take the old buggy after all.
Then she turned to and cursed him properly, but he took no
notice.</p>

<p>Now, it was a bright moonlight night, and the boy says that
the old buggy creaked and groaned something wonderful when they
took it out, which was not to be wondered at, seeing how crazy it
was. But what he stuck to, and he was a sharp youngster for his
age, was that when Dancer got in and took the reins something
else that he did not see got in the other side and sat beside
him. The boy said that the spring bent, and the buggy creaked
when it got in, but Dancer drove off without seeing it.</p>

<p>He was away two or three days, and when he came back the
silver plate had been wrenched out of the buggy. It was of no
great value, but still the bank had acted handsomely, and it was
of solid silver, and worth a few pounds. Anyhow, it was gone, and
Dancer swore it had fallen out; but, of course, he had prized it
out, and made away with it. Mrs. Dancer said nothing; but she
must have felt bad inside, and when a few days afterwards he told
her he was going in once more she did not offer him money to
stay, but told him that if he did he would never come back in it
alive again.</p>

<p>So he harnessed the horses up, and the boy says that the
something got in the buggy again, and went off with it, sitting
beside the driver. The moon was at the full that night, and about
one o'clock in the morning the boy was woke up by hearing the
noise of something coming' along the road. He looked out of the
open window, and saw the buggy coming; but Dancer was not in it
as far as he could see. Still the reins were held by something,
and the horses jogged steadily along as though they were being
driven. On it came right up to the stable, where the horses
stopped, and then the boy saw something like a shadow in the seat
next to where the driver should have sat&mdash;something that
faded away even as he looked, but on the floor of the buggy was a
darker shadow that did not fade.</p>

<p>The frightened boy rushed off to his mother, and she called a
man, and they went into the yard. There was the buggy, the horses
standing quiet waiting to be unharnessed, and at the bottom,
where he had fallen from the seat, was Dancer's body. The doctor
who came out and examined the dead man said it was a fit brought
on by alcoholic poisoning. But nothing will shake the belief of
young Morrison and his mother that Dancer suddenly saw what was
sitting beside him, and the horror of it frightened the life out
of him. Then that awful passenger took the reins and drove home
with his body.</p>

<p>Young Morrison is growing up fast; but you bet he'll never
part with that old buggy in which his dead father drove his
wicked, dead stepfather home.</p>

<p>Asleep?</p>

<p>'Not quite, Jim. Good night.'</p>

<h2><a id="ch5"></a>05. &mdash; THE YOUVEL MOUNTAIN GHOSTS</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, 9 Oct 1897</h3>

<p class="first">
I PAID a visit, the other day, to my old friend Jim, now a
substantial and well to do member of society.</p>

<p>'I've been wanting to see you for some time,' he remarked.
'I've had a most curious adventure.'</p>

<p>'Ghosts again?'</p>

<p>'Yes, and I've learnt a good deal more of their habits and
customs, although I thought I knew a lot already.'</p>

<p>'When you die, Jim, you won't feel lonely in the next
world.'</p>

<p>'No, I don't think I shall, but I have no desire to peg out
just now. You see that range up there? Well, there's a haunted
hut there that I never heard of until about three months
ago.'</p>

<p>'And of course you've spent a night there?'</p>

<p>'Of course I have. I made some excuse to the missus and went
and camped there, and, as I tell you, had quite a new experience.
I got there about sundown; and a lonely-looking spot it
is&mdash;just a slab hut with a zinc roof, standing in a thick
forest of peppermint-gum-trees, alongside the scummiest-looking
waterhole I ever saw.</p>

<p>'It was once a boundary rider's hut, at the corner of a big
paddock, and the posts of the fence are still standing, but the
wire has been taken out. Of course, there's a yarn, that the last
man who lived there cut his throat; but I don't lay any stock on
that, and it has nothing to do with my story. I had left my horse
at a friend's place about two miles away, for I knew he wouldn't
stop in hobbles, so I had nothing to do but open the door and
walk in. Pretty dank and dismal it was, and I gave a bit of a
shiver and said, half aloud, "Mighty lonely quarters." There was
a sort of a sigh went round, and I seemed to hear a voice say,
"Ah! you're right."</p>

<p>'Just then there was a rustling in one corner, and blessed if
a thundering big black snake hadn't taken up his abode in the
hut. I soon taught him that there was not room for two, and then
I had a good look round for some more of his family, but he
seemed to have been an orphan, for I saw no more. A distant
relation of his, a centipede about six inches long, was the only
other tenant I had to chuck out. By the time I had got a roaring
good fire and boiled my quart it was dark, so when I had finished
I went outside for a smoke. My! wasn't it quiet and still up in
that range! Not a sound of any sort could I hear, not even an
owl. The sky looked black up between the branches of the trees,
and only a few stare were reflected in that dark pool.</p>

<p>'I shivered a bit, and went in to the fire again.</p>

<p>'Now, those frauds who pretend to show spirits say that they
don't like a strong light, and don't like to be looked at, and
all that nonsense. It's part of their fake. A good honest ghost
likes light and company when he can get it I was not a bit
surprised, therefore, when, on entering the hut I saw a man
sitting on one of the sawn logs that served as seats by the
fire.</p>

<p>'He was a decent-looking chap, just dressed like any ordinary
man in the bush dresses, a man who might have four figures in the
bank or nothing. I eat down opposite to him, and bade him a civil
good evening.</p>

<p>'He smiled as though pleased, and said, "That's a relief,
anyway." I looked inquiringly at him. "Oh!" he said, "I expected
you to bolt out yelling like all the other fellows have done, and
I so longed for a yarn."</p>

<p>'"I'm not frightened of ghosts," I answered. "Fact, I came out
here to-night on purpose to look you up."</p>

<p>'"That was kind of you, very kind. 'Tisn't many people who are
thoughtful about a poor ghost nowadays. We are laughed at, and
not believed in, and yet when a fellow shows himself, what's the
result? Why, the man who doesn't believe in ghosts runs for his
bare life."</p>

<p>'He seemed rather warm on the subject, so I guessed he'd had
some disagreeable experiences in the matter.</p>

<p></p>

<p>'"I HAD a great bit of fun once," he said, regaining
his good temper. "This is my residence, as a rule, but
sometimes I take a holiday, and on this occasion I went to
Bladderatong to look up some old friends who are buried there.
There was a woman who called herself a medium (how we ghosts do
laugh at those mediums), and she was to give a séance that night;
so we determined to go and see it. We went in a body&mdash;I
don't mean the body, but we made up a surprise party, and
attended that séance.</p>

<p>'"The room was darkened, and the medium had all her
preparations ready&mdash;masks, wigs, lazy tongs, and all the
other accessories&mdash;and she started in to materialise the
spirit at somebody she called Jonas. Well, Jonas was a dummy, of
course, and she paraded him, and the audience sat in the gloom
and gasped. Then we took a hand. I appeared first, and then the
woman sang out that it was against the rules, and called out to
her husband to put me out. You see she made sure I was a live
man. Her husband came and ordered me off, and went to put his
hand on my shoulder, and, of course, he went right through
me.</p>

<p>'"By Jove, it's a real one," he yelled out, and ran into the
street without his hat to the nearest pub, and drank four
whiskies in succession before he recovered himself. I
vanished.</p>

<p>'"Well, the woman was plucked. I believe she thought it was
some monkey trick of her husband's; but at any rate she stuck to
her guns, and explained to the audience, who were getting uneasy,
that I was a bad spirit.</p>

<p>'"It was Frank Dodd's turn next. Now, Frank was thrown from
his horse, and lay for days dead in the bush before he was found
and buried; so he was a ghost whose appearance was not at all
inviting, though he's a good fellow. Well, when this sun-dried
corpse appeared there was no mistake but what he was the genuine
article.</p>

<p>'"The medium screamed like a locomotive, and let poor dummy
Jonas fall, exposing what he really was. That was a lucky, thing,
for some sensible fellow amongst the audience burst out laughing
at seeing the corpse of Jonas, and others followed suit and
somebody turned the gas up, and stopped a panic. Then they all
went out, and we ghosts were left there with the medium lying on
the ground and moaning, 'I'll never do it again; only forgive
me.'</p>

<p>'"I believe she recovered her spirits and cheek the next
morning, and accused the Mayor and Corporation of having entered
into a conspiracy to play a trick on her. But some youngsters had
got hold of Jonas, and carried him up and down the street, so
that gave the show away altogether."</p>

<p></p>

<p>'"YOU seem to have rather a good time of it where you are," I
said.</p>

<p>'"Only at times," he replied. "It's beastly dull here as a
rule."</p>

<p>'"Have you no company?"</p>

<p>'"Yes, but I don't want them. One's an old shepherd who wants
to tell stupid yarns all night, and the others are two flash
fellows from about the ranges somewhere who tell a fresh lie
every night of how they came to grief."</p>

<p>'"Would you mind telling me your own fate?" I asked.</p>

<p>'The ghost started, got up, and walked up and down the hut.
"You'd take me for a liar at I did," he said at last.</p>

<p>'"No, I would not," I said.</p>

<p>'"Well, mind, every word I tell you is true. How long have you
been in the district?"</p>

<p>'"About three years."</p>

<p>'"Ah, then, you know nothing about this country when it was a
cattle-run, before it was all selected. I owned it in those days.
You ought know where the remains of the old homestead and the
garden and orchard are?"</p>

<p>'"I know it well," I answered.</p>

<p>'"That was any home, and as pretty a one as ever a man brought
a bride to. I brought mine there&mdash;a young girl whom I had
known for years, and her parents ever since I was a boy. She was
as fresh and pure-looking as an opening bud at sunrise,
and&mdash;" He got up and walked about again in evident,
agitation&mdash;"as false as though she she'd been born and
educated in Hell. Just a few months of perfect trust and
happiness, a fool's paradise, and then an awakening and
death&mdash;that was any lot.</p>

<p>'"The man who betrayed me was, naturally, my best friend. Oh!
since I have been dead, how much of that sort of thing have I not
seen! He came up to stay with us. He had been sick, and wanted a
change. I was busy and they were thrown much together. I believe
every soul on the station knew of my dishonor excepting myself,
for, naturally, none dare tell me. I am sure I would have killed
any man who ventured to hint a word against her.</p>

<p>'"Nature betrayed her. One day, as by a flash, my eyes were
opened to her condition as a coming mother. She happened to look
at me, and saw in my eyes the look of staggered incredulity, of
wonder, of horror and doubt. This intrigue had been going on
before our marriage. She read my face like a book, and from that
instant another devil of murder entered into her heart.</p>

<p>'"She became wildly gay, and was in the best of spirits. Next
day I was coming out to this hut, where a boundary rider then
lived, and she proposed that she an Hammond, my false friend,
should accompany me. I had not decided on anything at the time.
My brain was to a whirl, and I could not see my path clear before
me.</p>

<p>'"We came to this hut. The boundary rider was absent on his
rounds, and we unsaddled and prepared a meal. My wife was still
in the highest spirits, and took upon herself the preparation of
the meal. We had brought quart-pots with us, and my wife
superintended the boiling of them, and made the tea. Did ever
three such people sit down to a meal, two of them with black
murder in their hearts, for if my suspicions were correct
Hammond, I swore, would never see another sun rise. But in my
wife's heart was murder of the loudest kind.</p>

<p>'"I was thirsty, and as soon as my tea was cool. I took a long
drink of it. In less than five minutes I felt an uncontrollable
start go through my limbs. For the minute I did not know what it
meant. Then, as another and more violent spasm shook me from head
to foot, I knew what had happened.</p>

<p>'"I was poisoned, poisoned with the strychnine which the
boundary rider kept in his hut for baits for the native dogs.</p>

<p>'As I rolled over in agony I saw that beautiful fiend burst
out laughing, and Hammond rise with a white, frightened face.
Though racked from head to foot with recurring spasms of the
utmost agony, I heard all that passed. Hammond came over to me.
'Good God!' he said, 'what is the meaning of this?'</p>

<p>'"He's poisoned!" laughed the woman. "I did it! I saw in his
eyes that he knew, and now he will not trouble us any more. It's
no good, Tom, he's got to die, die like a dingo of a poisoned
bait."</p>

<p>'"You infernal murderess," said Hammond, rising to his feet.
"I can bring you to the gallows on your own confession I
will."</p>

<p>'"Rolling and writhing to the most horrible agony as I
was&mdash;for of all forms of death, poisoning by strychnine is
the worst and cruelest, yet I remember all that passed.</p>

<p>'"Tom," said the woman, to a changed voice, approaching him
as if to embrace him, "what do you mean?"</p>

<p>'"Mean, you Hell-cat!" he returned, pushing her roughly away,
"I cannot help him, and I must go."</p>

<p>'"What, leave me, now, when the future is ours? Leave me? You,
my lover?"</p>

<p>'"I hate and loathe you, I hate you; do you understand? and
will never see you again!" And picked up his bridle and went to
where the horses were feeding.</p>

<p>'The woman stood there with a look of despair on her face;
stood as if stricken motionless for ever. Then, as the last
mortal agony caught me in its grip and twisted and distorted my
features, she laughed load and mirthlessly. "Look how he grins!"
she shouted. "Grin away, old man. You've got the best of it,
after all."</p>

<p>'Then, crying, 'Tom! Tom! come back!' she fell to the ground,
even as my spirit left my body, and my agony ceased for ever.</p>

<p>'When the boundary rider returned he found her a gibbering
idiot beside my dead body. Her trouble came on her, but she
lived through it, and is now in an asylum, hopelessly
insane.'</p>

<p>'The ghost got up and walked backwards and forwards a bit,
then commenced again.</p>

<p>'"You said we had a good time. Yes, I am going to have a good
time one day, when he comes back, for he's bound to come, bound
to come, they always do. And then, and then&mdash;"</p>

<p>'He stopped abruptly, and said in his former manner: "You've
upset me somewhat. I think I shall bid you good night," and
vanished.</p>

<p>'That was the story he told me, and I jotted it down, so that
I could remember enough to tell you. I stayed there the rest of
the night and received a visit from the old shepherd, and the two
flash youngsters, who told me that they shot each other dead in a
duel; but after what I had heard these commonplace ghosts had no
interest for me.'</p>

<p></p>

<p>JIM stopped and lit his pipe.</p>

<p>'Is that the end?' I asked.</p>

<p>'No; I saw the end. You've heard of the Youvel Mountain
mystery? That range as called Youvel Mountain sometimes.'</p>

<p>'I think I do remember something about it.'</p>

<p>'I told you I left my horse at a friend's. In the morning I
went for it. I remained there most of the day, for he wanted me
to give him a hand with some work he was doing. Towards evening,
when I was preparing to start home, a stranger rode up. He was a
well-dressed, handsome man, and had a valise strapped on his
saddle.</p>

<p>'He said he was on his way to Tantallon Station, and asked if
there was not a short cut over the Youvel Mountain. I told him
there was, but he could not reach there before dark.'</p>

<p>'"There's an old hut on the track you can camp at if you won't
stop here to-night," said my friend.</p>

<p>'I saw the stranger pale at mention of the hut, but he thanked
my friend for his offer, and said that he must push on. Then he
rode away, and I began thinking.</p>

<p>'About the middle of the day my friend came over here. He
looked upset, and I asked him what was the matter.</p>

<p>'"Jim," he said, "you remember that fellow who came along last
night, going to Tantallon Station?"</p>

<p>'"Yes; what about him?"</p>

<p>'"Why, his horse came back this morning."</p>

<p>'"Well, why didn't you run the short cut up to see what had
become of the rider?"</p>

<p>'"O, I wanted somebody with me, and I thought perhaps you'd
come," said the chuckle-head.</p>

<p>'I was too angry to say anything, but got a horse and rode
back with him as hard as I could. We rode straight on to the hut.
I felt certain we should find him there, and we did.</p>

<p>'He was dead, lying there with wide-open staring eyes. Eyes!
but I cannot tell you what ghastly horror and fright were in
those eyes. Even that mule-headed friend of mine saw the fear in
them, and cried out to me to close them.</p>

<p>'There was not a mark or scratch on him. The doctors who
examined the body could find no cause of death. I know as well as
if the corpse had spoken out and told me that the man was killed
by awful, paralysing terror, that stopped his heart and turned
his blood cold.</p>

<p>'When the police took charge of his things and examined them,
I learned, as I expected, that the dead man's name was
Hammond.'</p>

<p>Jim got up, and went inside, and brought out the whisky. He
took a good stiff nip, and then said:</p>

<p>'Do you know, old man, I would go and spend another night at
that hut, just to see how those two ghosts get on together, only
tar what I saw in those dead eyes. I don't want to be found like
that.'</p>

<h2><a id="ch6"></a>06. &mdash; THE DOOM OF THE DESERT</h2>

<h3><i>Queenslander</i>, 14 Dec 1895</h3>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="first">
THERE were many obstacles in the way of Arthur Constable
marrying Dorothy Clayton, and there was only one thing in his
favour, but that one thing, in his opinion, outweighed all the
others. Needless to say it was the consent of pretty Dorothy
herself. She was willing, but all her family, and there were many
of them, scouted both him and the idea.</p>

<p>Dorothy's father was perhaps one of the most objectionable
beings to be met with in a world where objectionable people are
not rarities. That was the candid and unprejudiced opinion of
nearly every one who had any dealings with him. Not that he cared
a snap about the opinion of anybody for that matter. He called
himself a man of an independent spirit, and there was no doubt
that he was; so independent that he had not a friend in the
world. The whole family were much the same, and only tolerated
each other when they united in doing something disagreeable to
somebody outside their own Vicious circle.</p>

<p>The Claytons owned three stations among them. Dorothy's father
had the largest, his brother, an equally disagreeable old
curmudgeon, owned the next best, and their maiden sister, an
especially acidulated old lady, was mistress of the third. She
took care to let her people know, too, that she was mistress.
True, she had an overseer, but she overlooked everything herself
for all that.</p>

<p>Then there were the families of the two brothers, all cast in
the same mould, and how sweet and sunny Dorothy came to spring
from such a crowd no one could understand. The only other
exception was a wild and somewhat dissipated brother of hers,
whom she was constantly reforming and saving from the dire
penalty of being cut off with a shilling. As for the other
brothers and cousins, they were locally known as scrubbers, rank
scrubbers, too mean even to be dissipated unless at some one
else's expense.</p>

<p>The stations belonging to the Clayton family formed, as it
were, three corners of a square, the fourth corner being occupied
by the station of which Arthur Constable was the poorly-paid
manager. His audacity, then, in falling in love with Dorothy, and
her infatuation in returning his affection, can only be called
frantic lunacy. Worse still. The owner of the station managed by
Constable was in the hands of the bank, whose agent he daily
expected to arrive armed with credentials to take over the
property. It may be imagined, then, that there was considerable
friction between him and the Claytons, but as some compensation
he had a neighbour, some fifteen miles to the westward, who was
his fast friend and ally. His name was Everett; he was a man of
considerable means, and was some years older than Constable.</p>

<p>In due time the expected blow fell. The manager appointed by
the bank turned up, and Constable was not sorry to hand over his
unpleasant responsibility; for there is nothing more calculated
to give a man premature gray hairs than looking after a station
tottering on the eve of foreclosure, with all the men growling
and dissatisfied. It was then with a feeling of relief that
Constable rode over to his friend Everett's place to pay a short
visit whilst he decided on the future, a future in which Dorothy
Clayton was the central figure.</p>

<p>"I am very glad you are out of a billet," said his host as
they chatted after dinner.</p>

<p>"Very kind of you," was the reply.</p>

<p>"Because," continued Everett, "I have gone into two specs
lately, and I want a good man. One is a share I have taken in a
shelling station in the Straits. The other is some country I have
taken up in Western Australia in conjunction with a partner. I
want some one to look after my interests in both cases; which
would you like to undertake? That is, if you will accept
either?"</p>

<p>"I know nothing whatever about pearl shelling," returned his
friend. "Oh. it's more for the business part of It that I want a
man. The practical details are, of course, in experienced
hands."</p>

<p>Constable hesitated. Visions of tropic seas and palm-girt
isles, of dusky natives and pearls like eggs, of a broad veranda
and Dorothy in a white dress on a cane lounge, flashed before his
eyes. He had never been on a pearl shelling lugger nor seen a
pearling station. But he was no fool, he knew what Everett
wanted. True, Western Australia was a long way off, but he
answered quietly:</p>

<p>"I think I'd better tackle what I do understand. I'll go to
Western Australia."</p>

<p>Everett looked pleased.</p>

<p>"I am glad of it." he said. "I can easily get a man for the
other billet. But I do not know of any one on whose judgment of
country I could so thoroughly rely as on yours."</p>

<p>The rest of the evening was spent in explaining the details of
the mission on which he wanted Constable to proceed. The country
was an enormous area of, as yet, unexplored territory, on and
beyond the upper portions of two of the principal coastal rivers
of central Western Australia. This tract had been taken up in
small blocks, and Constable's work was to thoroughly examine it
and to report as to which blocks should be retained and which
forfeited. Now it is not to be supposed that, although Constable
had been, as it were, struck off the Claytons' visiting list, he
and Dorothy never met. The emissary of love was a very artful old
black fellow, bound over to faithfulness by much tobacco and
occasional rums. The notes were generally carried behind his ear,
concealed by his greasy thatch of hair. Thanks to the trusty
aborigine they had many a stolen meeting, and wore thus enabled
to bid each other farewell before Arthur's departure.</p>

<p>The goldfields (though it was on the eve of their discovery)
had not then converted Western Australia into the busy place it
now is, but in due time Constable arrive at his point of
departure, a seaport to the north of Fremantle, accompanied by
one of the men from his old station. Everett of course knew and
heartily approved of the engagement, and had promised to stand
Dorothy's friend in every way during Arthur's absence, also to
act as post office.</p>

<p>Just as he was about to start Constable received the following
telegram:&mdash;</p>

<br>

<p class="telegram">
AUNT DIED SUDDENLY. LEFT ME EVERYTHING. COME BACK AT ONCE.
EVERETT WILLING.&mdash;DOROTHY CLAYTON.</p>

<br>

<p>Constable smiled at his sweetheart's impulsiveness. More than
ever must he woo Dame Fortune and not come back empty-handed. His
reply ran:&mdash;</p>

<br>

<p class="telegram">
CONGRATULATIONS. IMPOSSIBLE TO RETURN UNTIL COMPLETION OF
WORK. START AT ONCE. GOODBYE.</p>

<br>

<p>He smiled again when he thought how good-tempered Everett knew
full well what he would do.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p class="first">
DOROTHY CLAYTON stood on the veranda of the homestead of which
she was now mistress, wearily watching the sun go down. Her
aunt's will had astonished and disgusted all her relations. The
only cause that they could assign for its provisions, save that
of unsound mind, was the fact that Miss Clayton was Dorothy's
godmother, and the girl had been named after her. None of them
gave the grim and soured old maid credit for discerning that
Dorothy was not built of the same mean and selfish clay that they
were. Dorothy's again newly-reformed brother Frank looked after
the place for her, and while she prayed for Arthur Constable's
safety and speedy return her relations fervently hoped that he
might never appear again.</p>

<p>As Dorothy stood looking sadly out on the landscape she
noticed a horseman approaching. She knew who it was; beyond her
harum-scarum and shallow brother, Everett was almost the only
friend she had in the world. Her heart was too engrossed with the
thought of her lover for her to dream of such a thing happening,
but, truth to tell, Everett found that acting as a kind of
guardian to his friend's sweetheart had become a task conferring
as much pain as pleasure. He was loyal to the core, however, and
never by word or look Indicated what his feelings were. He rode
up to the stable, dismounted, and gave his horse to a boy, then
walked up to the house.</p>

<p>"No news?" asked Dorothy as they shook hands.</p>

<p>"None," replied Everett. "I left, however, before the mailman
came, as I had to go round by the Lagoon Camp. I told them to
send any letters after me here."</p>

<p>"Eighteen months now," said Dorothy sorrowfully. "Seventeen
since we last heard."</p>

<p>"And it should have taken eight at the outside," Dorothy
sighed. Eighteen months had indeed elapsed since Arthur Constable
started from the coast town on his journey. One letter had been
received by Everett, dated a month later, enclosing, of course,
one for Dorothy; since then all had been utter silence. The last
letter had been sent back to the furthest outside station, and
Arthur then wrote in high spirits. Everything was running
smoothly, and he anticipated a successful trip and a speedy
return.</p>

<p>The twilight had now set in, and as they entered the house
Dorothy turned and looked round.</p>

<p>"Some one coming," she said.</p>

<p>"Letters by the mail, I suppose," returned Everett, and went
down to the garden gate to meet the messenger, who had come up
and handed the leather mail-bag to Everett, which had come since
his departure. He took it into the house. Dorothy was flushed,
every fresh mail brought fresh hope. Everett turned the contents
of the bag on to the table. Amongst the letters was a
curious-looking parcel. He took it up, and Dorothy's quick eye
detected the Western Australian stamps.</p>

<p>"At last," she said.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute. What's this?" said he, picking up a Government
envelope and opening it. Glancing at she and he saw that it was
signed by the Commissioner of Police at Perth. Dorothy and he
read it together. It was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<br>

<p class="typewriter">Sir,&mdash;</p>

<p class="typewriter"> By this post I forward you a packet, which
was found by mounted troopers X and Y in a camp of natives on the
G River. With some difficulty we deciphered the address, and I
now forward it to you in the same state in which it was found,
but with the addition of a new wrapper. Trusting It will reach
you safely,&mdash;</p>

<p class="typewriter">I am, yours, etc.</p>

<p class="typewriter">P.S.&mdash;I may add that the address was
so obliterated that it was only by looking up the names and
addresses of pastoral lessees in the books of the Lands office,
that we were enabled to finally identify it as yours.</p>

<br>

<p>Everett took up the packet. What did it contain? Life or
death? Death to Constable, and&mdash;life to him. He opened it.
Underneath the new wrapper was the only one with the almost
effaced superscription. He cut this carefully off; a piece of
waterproof sheeting came next, then some wrappers of old
newspaper, and at last the precious letter. Everett opened it,
and silently handed Dorothy an enclosure addressed to her. She
tore it open, unfolded the closely written sheet, and down
fluttered two or three pressed flowers, the gorgeous blossoms of
Sturt's desert pea.</p>

<p>Everett's letter ran:&mdash;</p>

<br>

<p class="letter">
<span class="smcap">Dear Old Man</span>,&mdash;</p>

<p class="letter">
I am afraid I am in a bit of a fix. All went on velvet until
we had to examine blocks 380, '61, '52, '58, etc. These all lie
beyond the heads of the coastal rivers, on the inlaid slope. It
was terribly dry, but we managed to get a little water, enough
for no night, and the next night camped at a salt lake where some
natives were camped, and fairly good water could be obtained by
digging, back from the lake. So far so good, but when Jim the
blackboy went after the horses the next morning he came back with
four, which had been feeding around the lake. The others must
have gone out back on the higher ground, so he started after
them. You never saw a blackboy look so white as he did when he
returned.</p>

<p class="letter">
"That fellow bung, altogether bung," he stammered.
Vickars and I jumped up and looked at each other. "Poison plant,"
he said. I motioned to Jim to show us where they were. True
enough there lay ten of our horses dead. Up to this time we had
not had a single mishap with the horses, and now out of fourteen
ten were struck down at one blow, and but for the fact that four
had remained feeding around the edge of the lake all would have
shared the same fate. As it was we were in a pretty tight place.
With only four horses It would be next to Impossible to get back
the way we came, more especially as one of the survivors was a
dull, sluggish brute, one of the worst, if not the worst, we
had.</p>

<p class="letter">
The blacks, of whom there were only about a dozen all
told, were quiet and friendly. Presently, after we had returned
to camp, we heard them shouting, and some came running towards
us; they had come across the dead horses, and came to tell us of
our loss. It was not safe to stay where we were, as we might at
any time lose the remainder of our horses. We therefore tried to
find out from the natives if there was any other water handy, to
which we could shift our camp. One gin seemed more intelligent
than the others, and from her we found out, or rather thought we
did, that there was water not very far away, but that they camped
at the lake because there was plenty of wild fowl on It, whereas
there was nothing to eat at the other water. This was puzzled out
after a deal of trouble, and I offered one of them a tomahawk to
show Vickars where the water was. Before they started Vickars and
I searched the place where the horses had died to try and
identify the plant. We found something which Vickars said
resembled the poison plant of the Northern Territory, and he left
with the native. Meanwhile I took stock of the rations,
ammunition, etc, and found that we fortunately still had a good
supply.</p>

<p class="letter">
Vickars was back sooner than I expected, and his report
was favourable. The water was a shallow spring In a small creek,
and much fresher than that we were then on. The grass was fair,
and he had not found any trace of the poison plant. In two or
three journeys we shifted our belongings, and found our camp a
great improvement, and you may fancy we blessed our ill-luck at
not striking it in the first place Instead of the salt lake. We
came to the conclusion, knowing what we did of the country, that
it would be madness to attempt to get back on foot, with the
horses packed with water, as it would take too long and they
would die on our hands and leave us stranded at the head of the G
River, where there Is a long stretch of dry country. Nothing for
it but to sit down and wait for rain.</p>

<p class="cp">(A later date.)</p>

<p class="letter">
We have been here now three months, and no sign of rain; a
long spell of dry weather seems to have set In. Vicars is down
with fever. The blacks at the lake, where we go every day for
game to eke out our rations, are talking of shifting north. I
would go with them, on the chance of working round to the coast
eventually, but Vickars is too ill to travel. Jim has made great
friends with the natives, and when I asked him if he would like
to go with them he seemed delighted. I have explained to him that
if they go near any station, no matter where, he must get in and
give this packet to a white man. I enclose copies of my plan and
route, and as the work was nearly finished. It will be all right,
that is if this ever reaches you. Good-bye, old man. I don't
intend to say die while there's a shot in the locker.</p>

<br>

<p>Dorothy's letter, as may be imagined, was somewhat different.
Arthur Constable referred her to Everett for all particulars, and
concluded by saying:</p>

<p class="letter">
The creek just above our camp is ablaze on either hank
with the blossoms of the desert pea; they are such a contrast to
the surrounding desolation that they make me feel quite hopeful,
so I have plucked some and pressed them for you. Do you remember
how all our notes went safely that old Joe used to take? I am
trusting this to a native, so I hope it is a good omen.</p>


<p><br>
THROUGH what strange vicissitudes had this packet travelled
before reaching the bands of the troopers; and what had become of
Jim, the original bearer? The two looked at each other in
silence. The last date was nine months old; what had happened
during all that dreary time?</p>

<p>"Pray God that Vickars recovered," said Everett at last. "Two
men might pull through, whereas one would be lost.</p>

<p>"Is there any hope?" asked Dorothy.</p>

<p>"Hope? Yes, plenty," replied Everett. "No rain has fallen,
that is evident; they have four horses for the two of them; and
a thunderstorm will put them across the dry country. They are
saving up their rations and living on what they can shoot. I dare
say they are having a rough time, and will be as thin as rakes;
that will be the worst of it." He spoke cheerfully, but he did
not quite believe all he said. There was a long pause, and
Everett looked at the map covered with close writing, the map
that perhaps meant....</p>

<p>"Mr Everett," said Dorothy at last, "I am going over to
Western Australia."</p>

<p>"Going to Western Australia?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I am going to look for Arthur. Frank shall go with
me."</p>

<p>"You mean you are going over there to start a party to look
for him. We can do that from here. The police there will
undertake it."</p>

<p>"I am going to start a party and&mdash;go with them."</p>

<p>"Girl!" said Everett excitedly, "you do not know what you are
talking about. What good will Frank be? He has never been outside
of wire fences."</p>

<p>"There must be plenty of good men over there who would go if
they are paid."</p>

<p>"No doubt of it, as good as you could find anywhere. Why not
pay them to go? You will be only in the way."</p>

<p>"I was born and brought up in the bush; I shall not be In the
way. I am going."</p>

<p>He looked in her eyes and saw the unshakable resolution of a
loving woman in them. He turned and took two or three strides up
and down.</p>

<p>"Arthur went for me," he said, as if speaking half to
himself, "and he has done his work!"</p>

<p>He went up to her. "If you go I must go too, both to look for
him and to take care of you, as I promised him that I would
do."</p>

<p>She caught his hand in both hers, and he saw her eyes become
suffused with tears.</p>

<p>"I knew you would," she said, "and now&mdash;we shall find
him; for, oh! I have such trust in you." They stood for a moment
with her hands clasping his.</p>

<p>"I must go back at once," he said. "There is much to do, and
the sooner we start the better." He stooped and kissed her on the
forehead.</p>

<p>"God bless your true heart," he said, and left the house. The
quiet stars whispered peace to him as he rode home beneath their
light. The soft night-wind fanned his hot face and bore the same
message. The battle had been fought and won; once and for
all.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p class="first">
IT may be imagined what the outcry of the Clayton family was
like when Dorothy announced her Intention of going in search of
the detrimental. But it was useless. Dorothy was now of age; her
money was her own; she defied them. Old Clayton blustered and
threatened, but half-an-hour's talk with Everett reduced him to
as much reason as he ever possessed, and he recognised the
helplessness of his position. Preparations were pushed on with
all speed, for every day was precious, and, aided by lucky
circumstances, the party were soon In the town that had witnessed
Constable's departure. Money being no object, the services of a
couple of good bushmen were soon secured, and a thorough
equipment got together. Just at that time a shipment of camels
arrived, and Everett hired six of them with drivers for the trip,
as there was no knowing how far they might have to go, or what
dry country they would have to encounter in their doubtful quest
of the lost man. Before they started, a volunteer was added to
their party.</p>

<p>A doctor, who was also an enthusiastic botanist, hearing that
they were likely to go beyond the settled districts, requested
permission to accompany them, and such an acquisition was gladly
welcomed. The journey was naturally uninteresting until they at
last reached the point Indicated on Constable's map as the last
permanent water before reaching the fatal salt lake.</p>

<p>As it was evident that no rain had fallen since, a dry stretch
of at least a hundred miles now intervened. A camp was formed,
and Everett determined to leave the two men behind, and push
across with the camels and the buckboard they had brought with
them for Dorothy's use. Two camels were packed with water for the
use of the two buggy-horses, and the party, consisting of Dorothy
and her brother, Everett, Dr. Fanshawe, and the two Afghans, made
a final start. Dr. Fanshawe, who did not appreciate camel riding,
took the vacant place in the buggy beside Dorothy.</p>

<p>It had been debated whether to go straight to the camp
indicated on the map or to the salt lake. Everett finally
determined to arrange it so that they would camp the last night
within easy distance of the lake, and go round by It to the camp,
where, however, he had no hope of now finding any one. The
journey through the monotonous desert was without Interest to
anybody but Dr. Fanshawe, who was continually jumping in and out
of the buggy to secure specimens of the flora.</p>

<p>At last the morning dawned that Dorothy had been so anxiously
looking forward to, and her heart beat painfully as, in the early
hours, they came in sight of the salt lake. Save for the wild
fowl it was lonely and tenantless. They waited for nearly an hour
while Everett made an inspection of the shores. Coming back he
came up to Dorothy, and whispered to her:</p>

<p>"Some one is here. There are fairly fresh tracks about, and
some cartridge cases." He showed her two or three he had picked
up. They had the appearance of having been lately discharged.</p>

<p>"Keep cool and brave," he said as he helped her back into the
buggy.</p>

<p>It was not long before the camp was in sight. The little sandy
creek, which began and ended nowhere, was situated between two
gently sloping ridges scantily grassed. A tattered, weatherworn
tent, covered by a shade of boughs, was all they saw as they
approached, but no sign of life save the ubiquitous crows. They
halted when near the place, and, leaving the Afghans to look
after the camels and buggy, went towards the tent on foot.</p>

<p>Suddenly Dorothy started and clutched Everett's arm. Just to
their left was a grave. A grave that had been tended and cared
for. It was at the foot of a tree, large for that part of
Australia. A piece of bark had been stripped from the lower part
of the trunk, and on the wood a rude inscription
carved&mdash;</p>

<p class="sign">J. VICKARS<br>
DIED ......</p>

<br>

<p>Then followed a date but a few days later than the
well-remembered one of the letter.</p>

<p>"He has been here alone," said Dorothy in an awe-struck voice,
looking round at the desolation that environed them.</p>

<p>"Yes, alone," repeated Everett, "but where can he be now?"</p>

<p>The tent was empty, but the ashes were warm, showing that the
occupant of the camp had been there that morning.</p>

<p>"Perhaps he is after the horses?" suggested Frank. Clayton.
Everett shook his head. "The horses would want no looking after;
they would not leave the water."</p>

<p>A whistle from the doctor, who had been wandering about by
himself, attracted their attention. He was standing in front of
some heaps of broken stones neatly arranged, almost like heaps of
road metal. Dr. Fanshawe was examining one.</p>

<p>"Your friend has luckily found something Interesting to employ
his time on," he said, passing the stone to Everett. It was
quartz, and showed gold freely. All the heaps were the same, and
had evidently been brought in and stacked.</p>

<p>"There is a reef somewhere handy, and he is at work on it
now."</p>

<p>A short search revealed a well-worn pad leading back from the
creek.</p>

<p>"You had better stay here with Frank," said Everett to
Dorothy, but she shook her head determinedly. They followed the
pad for nearly a mile when they heard a monotonous sound of
knocking ahead. They crested the rise, and, close to them, came
on the object of their long search.</p>

<p>Bareheaded under the pitiless sun, burnt nearly black where
his skin was exposed, ragged, and with matted hair and beard,
Constable was hammering fiercely at the cap of a long line of
reef, and talking vehemently to himself all the time. Dr.
Fanshawe clutched Everett's arm at the first glimpse he caught of
the wild figure.</p>

<p>"For God's sake be careful," he whispered, "the man is
mad."</p>

<p>They were unobserved by the toiler, and stood watching him.
Presently he dropped the tool he had been using, an old axe
battered out of all shape, picked up one of the stones he had
detached, and commenced to examine it.</p>

<p>"Gold for Dorothy!" he shouted, "More gold for Dorothy!" As he
threw the fragment down he caught sight of them, and a blaze of
fury flashed into his unrecognising eyes.</p>

<p>"Ha! ha! You have come at last. I knew you would in time, but
you are too late, too late!" and he held out both arms as if to
protect his treasure.</p>

<p>"Arthur! Dear Arthur!" said Dorothy, stepping In front before
they could stay her. "Don't you know me? I am Dorothy, your
Dorothy."</p>

<p>"No! No!" he shouted, then, as a sudden thought came into his
crazed brain, "You have been to my camp. You have robbed me,
robbed Dorothy!"</p>

<p>He snatched the revolver from his belt, and pointed it at the
girl he loved. With one bound Everett was in front of her. The
madman pulled the trigger, and shot him through the heart. He
gave a choking sigh, and fell on the track, the pumping life
blood trickling down till it stained the hem of Dorothy's skirt.
Fanshawe was about to rush on the wretched man at all hazards,
when, as if startled by his own act, the maniac drew his hand
across his forehead and dropped insensible.</p>

<p>Fanshawe stooped over Everett.</p>

<p>"Dead?" whispered the girl with white lips.</p>

<p>"Instantaneous," he replied. She knelt on the dusty ground
beside the body, and taking the dead face between her hands,
kissed it reverently.</p>

<p>"For me," she murmured.</p>

<p>"Quick!" shouted the doctor to the stupefied Frank. "Run as
hard as you can to the camp, and bring up the buggy, bring
water."</p>

<p>Nothing loath to quit the scene, Frank sped away. Fanshawe
straightened the limbs and closed the staring eyes. Then he went
over to Constable, and Dorothy followed him. She had shed no tear
as yet, but when she took her lover's head on her lap and saw the
change that misery and insanity had wrought her tears fell fast.
She nursed it as a mother would a baby, while the doctor felt the
galloping pulse.</p>

<p>"He must have had a sunstroke," he said, "and has been going
about bareheaded ever since. He will be delirious when this
stupor leaves him; we must get him back to camp at once."</p>

<p>"Will he&mdash;will he remember this?" she asked, and pointed
to Everett's body. The doctor shook his bead.</p>

<p>"Then it must be a secret between is," she said. Fanshawe held
out his hand, and the silent pressure over the insensible form
sealed the compact. The rattle of the buggy was now heard. Frank
had lost no time. The doctor was a strong man, and there was not
much difficulty in lifting the wasted frame into the vehicle.</p>

<p>"Will you get in and hold him?" he said to Dorothy. "No!" she
replied, "you know best what to do. Frank will lead the horses
quietly."</p>

<p>"And you?" he asked.</p>

<p>A harsh guttural croak sounded in the air.</p>

<p>"Will stay here until you return. Do you think I would leave
him for the crows to peck at," and she pointed to the tree where
the foul carrion birds had alighted. The doctor looked at her
admiringly, then got into the buggy and put his arm round the
patient to support him. Frank led the horses on foot, and they
went slowly away, leaving Dorothy alone in the desert with the
dead.</p>

<p></p>

<p>AS soon as Everett's body was brought in Fanshawe sent one of
the Afghans back on the best camel to fetch a small medicine
chest and some other necessaries from the main camp. Poor Everett
was buried beside Vickars, and another inscription carved on the
tree. All their attention was now turned to Constable, who, as
the doctor had predicted, was now raving in delirium. Tossing
restlessly day and night; ever the same cry "Gold for Dorothy!
More gold for Dorothy!"</p>

<p>Fanshawe and the girl watched by him alternately, for Frank
seemed lazy and useless. At last, after some days, the Afghan
returned, and the precious chest containing the opiates the
doctor needed was in his hands, and the poor sun-scorched brain
had a little rest. When at last he awoke from the long sleep that
saved him, Dorothy was watching, and saw that reason had
returned. He gazed amazedly at her, then sat up.</p>

<p>"Another dream!" he said faintly, but in his natural
voice.</p>

<p>"No dream, dear," she said, putting her arms round him and her
cheek against his. "Is this a dream?"</p>

<p>"Dorothy! Here!"</p>

<p>"Yes, Dorothy herself. We came to look for you, your packet
reached us after all. This is Doctor Fanshawe," she said as the
doctor hearing the voices entered the tent, "who has helped me to
nurse you, for we found you ill and delirious."</p>

<p>"But how did you come here?"</p>

<p>"With the doctor, and my brother Frank, and some men we
engaged." It had been settled not to say anything about Everett
until he became stronger.</p>

<p>From that hour he rallied quickly, and in a few days he was
strong enough to go outside, and his sweetheart on one side and
Fanshawe on the other guided him round to the heaps of
quartz.</p>

<p>"Do you know anything about this?" asked the doctor.</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>"I remember finding the reef," he said. "Three or four months
after Vickars died."</p>

<p>"More than six months ago," said Dorothy. He looked
bewildered. "What has happened to me?" he asked. "You had a
sunstroke, I should imagine, and have been temporarily out of
your mind. Doubtless this reef kept you here, or you might have
made a desperate attempt to get in, and perished," replied
Fanshawe.</p>

<p>"But how could I have lived?"</p>

<p>"Instinctively you would have gone on as usual. We found
freshly discharged cartridges round the lake."</p>

<p>"Arthur dear," said Dorothy, taking his arm. "I have sad news
for you. Everett&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Is dead."</p>

<p>"Dead? When did he die?"</p>

<p>"The day we got here," said Fanshawe boldly, taking the lie on
himself. "It was an unhappy accident. He was taking a gun out of
the buggy and the trigger caught. It was one of those careless
things the best men will do at times without thinking."</p>

<p>"Where is he?" he asked in a pained voice. They took him to
the two graves, and he stood there with the team welling from his
eyes.</p>

<p>"But for him I doubt If we should have found you."</p>

<p>When Constable had gained sufficient strength the Journey home
was undertaken, much to Frank Clayton's relief, for the bush had
no charms for him. The sea voyage helped greatly to restore the
invalid, and when they reached Sydney, where they intended to
remain for a time, he was almost his old self again. The secret
of the reef was confided to the two men who had accompanied them
from the seaport and worked well, Constable and Fanshawe
retaining a half share between them. Dorothy would have abandoned
it altogether, but her opposition was overcome.</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p class="first">
EVERETT had made a will before starting, and in it he had left
a considerable sum to Constable, enough to enable him to marry
Dorothy on equal terms. She had sold her station to her uncle,
who had long coveted it, and with her husband settled down to
live a quiet life for a few years in one of the principal
Australian cities.</p>

<p>The reformed scapegrace, however broke out again badly; very
badly this time. His father, much to the joy of his brothers,
sent him about his business and he drifted to the city, where his
sister lived, and degenerated into c sponger on her and her
husband.</p>

<p>Over and over again Constable and his wife tried to put him
straight once more. Every position they obtained for him he
forfeited, and he finally took to drinking hard. One day in a
half-tipsy state he came to the house and asked for money.
Arthur, in order to try what a little restraint would do, refused
to give him any. Young Clayton stopped for some time
expostulating and entreating. Then, in bitter spite at being
refused, said: "I don't see why you should lecture me. I never
shot a man and took his money afterwards."</p>

<p>Constable sprang to his feet.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" he shouted.</p>

<p>"Mean?" returned the youth, and as he spoke his sister entered
the room. "I mean that you shot Everett when you were mad, and
are now living on his money."</p>

<p>Dorothy rushed forward and threw her arms round her husband,
in whose eyes she saw the wild light growing rapidly.</p>

<p>"Arthur, dear Arthur," she cried, "it is false! It
was&mdash;it was an accident. Leave the house, you liar and
coward!" she said, turning fiercely with flashing eyes on her
brother. "Never dare enter here again."</p>

<p>But the cub was wound up for revenge.</p>

<p>"Fanshawe and Dorothy made up that tale," he said as he backed
to the door.</p>

<p>"You aimed at Dorothy, but Everett Jumped between, and you
shot him."</p>

<p>"Go! will you?" she commanded. "If I had a weapon here I would
kill you! Sweetheart!" she said imploringly as the door closed on
the culprit. "It is all false. Do you not believe me and Dr.
Fanshawe? He has said it only to torture you."</p>

<p>He put his hand to his head, and she saw to her horror that
his eyes had a vacant and terrified look as though trying to
recall some dread dream of the past. With an effort he recovered
himself.</p>

<p>"Dorothy, wife!" he said. "I seem to remember something. Is
it?&mdash;tell me, is It true?"</p>

<p>"It is false," she answered firmly. "It was an accident. Just
as we told you."</p>

<p>And the lie was the whitest ever uttered. But the mischief was
done. He sank back in his chair and hid his face in his
hands.</p>

<p>Dorothy knelt beside him. Presently he looked up.</p>

<p>"Gold for Dorothy!" he said. "More told for Dorothy!"</p>

<p>Constable was not violent as before. He seemed to know his
wife and be soothed by her presence. He would stay for hours in
the quiet garden which was not overlooked, piling up stones and
muttering over and over again the old refrain. Fanshawe came to
him, and in time his brain cleared and he recovered, but though
there was never a cloud between Dorothy and him, one seemed to
hang over their quiet lives for years until it was banished by
the voices of children.</p>

<p>A seedy, disreputable loafer comes at times to the house,
which he is not allowed to enter, and his sister gives him the
alms he begs for. Among her treasures Dorothy has a rough serge
skirt with a blood stain on the hem that has never been washed
out.</p>

<h2><a id="ch7"></a>07. &mdash; A FEUD IN THE FAR WEST</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, 1 May 1897</h3>

<p class="first">
JIM DACEY awoke as the sun began to blaze into his face, the
flies to crawl over him, and the crows, from the dead tree
opposite, to make insulting remarks about him. He had a drunken
sleep all night on the hard, earthen floor of the verandah, and
woke up with a lime-kiln mouth, and one of the logs it was lately
his work to split, for a tongue.</p>

<p>He gazed around, and tried to collect his senses. There was
something the matter with one of his eyes, but that would do far
later investigation; at present there was only one thing in the
world worth having, and that was a nip of strong, hot, fiery rum,
something that would grip and bite all the way there and back. He
got up stiffly and went inside the bar.</p>

<p>The generally useful loafer, supposed, as usual, to be a
broken down swell, was washing out the bar-room, the landlord, in
a sleepy fashion, was putting the bottles straight. He looked at
Jim and whistled, then without a word put down the alleged rum
and a tumbler. Dacey filled and drank a tumbler of it neat, then,
with his mouth wide open to give the fumes vent, groped for the
water The landlord put it in his hand, and he slaked his parched
throat. The landlord waited till the rum got its work in, then he
remarked, 'You'll have a fine eye by the time it's sundown,
Jim.'</p>

<p>'Fine eye: what the&mdash;?' he stopped, remembering that he
had a curious bunged up feeling in one optic. 'Hand us that bit
of glass,' he said. The man handed him a bit of broken looking
glass from the bar shelf. Dacey inspected his unpresentable
appearance. His right eye was swollen, and commencing to put on
mourning.</p>

<p>'Whose blank fist did that?' he demanded savagely.</p>

<p>'Don't you remember anything?'</p>

<p>'Not a crimson word.'</p>

<p>'You got nasty, as usual, and had a turn up With Dan.'</p>

<p>'What was it all about?' he asked with a lowering frown.</p>

<p>'Suppose somebody else'll tell you, so I might as well. You
were blooming well tanked, and Dan came in with some fellows to
have a drink, and you commenced going for him. You've got a
tongue when your drunk, Jim, you know. Your brother kept his
temper, until at last you commenced about his wife; then he gave
you that lift in the eye, and that shook you up so that you
camped straight off.'</p>

<p>'Was I very drunk?' asked Dacey. 'Well, you might have been
able to lie straight on the floor without holding on, that's
about all.'</p>

<p>'And Dan was sober?'</p>

<p>'Oh yes. Dan was sober.'</p>

<p>Without a word Dacey turned away and banged open the door of a
small bedroom out of the bar. The first thing Dan Dacey knew was
that the blanket was snatched off, and he was dragged out of bed
by his feet, his head coming whack on the floor.</p>

<p>'Come out and fight, now I'm sober!' yelled his brother. Come
out, you &mdash;&mdash;cur, who hits men when they're drunk, and
can't put their &mdash;%mdash; hands up!'</p>

<p>Jim went out to await the result of his assault and
challenge.</p>

<p>It was not a soothing landscape that met his bloodshot eyes.
The great grey plain stretched, without break, towards the rising
sun, and over its wide surface the heat-haze was already
beginning to dance and tremble. The creek wound through the plain
like a wide serpentine ditch, fringed on either hand by a
straggling line of warped and crooked coolibah tress, with here
and there a patch of rusty polygonum. There was breadth and
grandeur about it, but nothing soft nor peaceful, and Jim, at
that moment did not want anything soft and peaceful. He had a
black eye to avenge. Dan came out of the house with other freshly
awakened sleepers. It was what Mulvaney would have called a
'sumptehous fight,' but Jim, as usual, was the victor, in spite
of being handicapped with a damaged eye. Dan would not be able to
follow the Grand Old Man's advice about chewing every mouthful
thirty-five times, for many days.</p>

<p>The enmity between the brothers was notorious in the district.
To hate each other like the Daceys was a common form of
illustrative expression. One would have thought, where such
bitter animosity existed, they would have put the width of the
continent between them, but no. Wherever Jim was, Dan was to be
found; and when Dan struck out a new line, Jim followed. Like
most of the outside men of twenty or thirty years ago, they were
good all round&mdash;stock-riding, horse-breaking,
'bull-punching,' splitting and fencing, it was all the same, both
could take their part. Jim was eighteen months older than Dan,
and, when sober always got the best of it when it came to
blows.</p>

<p>The vendetta between them reached its climax when Dan cut Jim
out with the girl he was courting, and married her. Both men had
been tolerably steady before, with the exception of an occasional
burst, but after Jim got jilted, as long as he had a shilling to
spend it went in drink. And if he came across Dan when drunk the
inevitable fight followed for Jim always fell foul of his
brother, and commenced to abuse his wife. Dan's wife was a
pretty, foolish girl, rapidly assuming the hard-baked appearance
of most women in the far west; she was neither wiser nor better
than the average woman of her class, and certainly not worth the
spoiling of a good man's life. But, as everyone knows, when
personal affection between the sexes comes in to the game of
life, the rules of the game are at once disregarded. Jim had
unconsciously created an ideal, and it was that ideal he thought
his brother had stolen from him&mdash;not the real girl at all,
perfectly ridiculous, but it is what nearly every man or woman
does more or less.</p>

<p>The man that the woman loves, and the woman that the man
loves, is always the 'twopence colored' print of imagination, not
the 'penny plain' one of reality. This ancient truism was
doubtless one the first reflections that occurred to Adam and Eve
when banished from the unreal glamor of Eden.</p>

<p>The brothers and their mates were returning from finishing a
good large fencing contract when this scene happened at the bush
pub where they had halted. They kept asunder for the rest of the
day, and the next morning Dan departed on his homeward way, and
Jim remained, and proceeded to knock down his cheque after the
approved fashion of those days. Jim's cheque lasted longer than
most men's would nave done. He had an uncomfortable habit of
straightening himself up every now and then and ascertaining how
the funds were getting on. Moreover, Jim Dacey was an ill man to
quarrel with.</p>

<p>Some three weeks passed, and Jim had a sore head, and an empty
pocket when Dan and another man rode up. The two brothers
glowered surlily at each other, but never interchanged a word.
Dan and his companion went into the bar, and Jim remained lolling
on the verandah. What passed inside Jim did not hear, but pretty
well guessed, from hearing his brother's voice, evidently
purposely raised for his benefit.</p>

<p>'Pay for the drinks he's stuck up! If it was to help him out
of hell I wouldn't.'</p>

<p>Dan was up, and in the room like a flash.'</p>

<p>'Who has asked you to pay for my drinks, you
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;' he demanded, turning
fiercely on the landlord, who began to feel sorry that he had
spoken, and proceeded to stammer out excuses. Jim never heeded
them, but commenced on his brother.</p>

<p>'You wouldn't pay for a drink, wouldn't you? Well, some day
I'll see you gasping, praying for a drink&mdash;a drink of muddy,
stinking water even, and I'll stand by with a full water-bag, and
pour it on the ground in front of you.  Now, go before I give
you another hiding.'</p>

<p>Dan would have retaliated, but his friend got him outside and
on his horse, and they rode off. Jim then turned his attention to
the landlord, and just as he had cursed him into a fit of, fever
and ague and blasphemed the rouseabout till he barred himself in
the kitchen, some one with a black boy and loose horses and
pack-horses rode up.</p>

<p>The newcomer dismounted, and strode in with a firm tread and a
clink of spurs.</p>

<p>'What, Dacey, painting the house red?' said a voice that Jim
recognised as belonging to the man he most respected in the
world, Balcombe, of Bareela Station, where Jim had raised many a
good cheque.</p>

<p>He turned sharply round. 'I was only giving this wholesale
poisoner a piece of my mind,' he said. 'Have a drink with me, Mr.
Balcombe. Put out some good sniff, if you've got any, you
unmentionable thief.'</p>

<p>The landlord grinned a relieved grin; he saw his money now,
and hastened to supply the best he had.</p>

<p>'Jim,' said Balcombe, 'this is a stroke of luck, my meeting
you. I was just wondering where I could find you as I came along.
Now, are you right for a long trip out across the Diamantina? You
won't be getting the horrors when we get away from the
liquor?'</p>

<p>'I'm your man, Mr. Balcombe, to the other end of Australia
with you.'</p>

<p>'Right, Jim, we'll go on to the twelve-mile tonight.'</p>

<p>'Dun's camped at the twelve-mile to-night, and to tell you the
truth, I want to keep apart for a bit,' replied Jim.</p>

<p>'Oh! Cain and Abel, I know you, but I'm hanged if I know which
is Abel. Very well, we'll stop here, and perhaps it's just as
well. Got a house and saddle?'</p>

<p>'I've got two; but this old Jew has them in pawn at
present.'</p>

<p>'Well, I'll square that. Now, if you know of a bit of feed
about here you might take the horses to it, with Coppertop.'</p>

<p>'You say Dan is on ahead,' remarked Balcombe, as they were
starting next morning, 'what's he doing, looking for work?'</p>

<p>'I suppose so.'</p>

<p>'Well, Dan's as good a man as you amongst cattle, Jim.'</p>

<p>'I don't deny it, although he's Dan Dacey.'</p>

<p>'My cousin is coining on with the cattle, and wants just such
a man. You and I are going ahead to find a good track and have a
look over the country. 'I'll send Dan back with a note to my
cousin to engage him; you'll be far enough apart.'</p>

<p>'The better for Dan,' said Jim grimly.</p>

<p>They found the two men spelling at the twelve-mile, and
Balcombe made his arrangements, while Jim and Coppertop lounged
on with the horses.</p>

<p>Three months had passed, and Balcombe and Jim, after a long
and toilsome trip, were slowly returning to meet the oncoming
cattle. They had been through months of difficulty and danger,
but all bad been happily surmounted, and only one tough piece of
work remained to them&mdash;to meet and get the cattle over a dry
stretch of from fifty to sixty miles that had to be crossed
somehow.</p>

<p>In due time the herd came, having had a fairly good trip. Not
a word passed between the two brothers when Balcombe and Jim met
the cattle; not a word passed between them during the week they
spelled on the last water, waiting for the moon to grow full
before starting on the dry stage. The sun was low when the herd
started, and the setting moon in her turn saw them still steadily
pushing on. When the sun grew warm they halted where a belt of
mulga afforded a grateful and welcome shade.</p>

<p>The real trouble had not commenced yet; the cattle were,
simply tired, and camped during the hottest hours of the day. In
the evening the weary way was resumed, the tired men and the now
restless beasts, the latter stringing out in a dogged, sullen
manner. It was midnight, the moon riding high, in a calm sky.</p>

<p>Balcombe, who was listlessly following the tail of the mob,
half asleep and nodding on his horse, heard a gust of wind
approaching. It rustled the leaves of the scrub belt they were
just then passing through, and with a lingering sigh passed over.
Immediately he heard some confused cries and whip cracks on one
flank of the mob, as though the men were trying to stop a break
away. Hastening round, he was told that three or four of the
horses, loose amongst the cattle, had apparently snuffed the
smell of water in the passing gust of wind, and suddenly had
started off in the direction it came from. The men had had some
difficulty in blocking the cattle from following them.</p>

<p>'Had any one gone after the horses?' asked Balcombe. Dan Dacey
was after them, but they had got a good start in the scrub.</p>

<p>Then the steady march kept on. Daylight, and they were on the
crest of the watershed, and before them lay the long decline of
downs sloping to the creek. At dawn two men drafted the horses
out and started ahead, and the strong cattle drew out after them,
and here and there weak ones in the tail began to fall out, for
these last four hours under the increasing heat of the sun were
harder than all that had gone before. The creek had on one side
the long slope of the bare down, on the other a line of hills
escarped by a crown of rocks. By mid-day the last straggler was
in, and Balcombe congratulated himself on getting across the dry
stage with a loss of only a few head. He rode on to a
newly-formed station some seven miles away, meaning to stop there
the night.</p>

<p>About two o'clock one of the men drew attention to the missing
horses, that had broken away on the dry stage, coming down the
side of the hill. They trotted hurriedly up to the cattle, and
dashed eagerly into the waterhole and drank greedily. The gust of
wind that carried the damp smell that had misled them had
probably passed over the wet mud or some just dried waterhole.
Dan Dacey was not behind them, and he did not turn up either that
afternoon or during the night.</p>

<p>Next morning, when there was talk of going to look for him,
the men naturally turned to Jim as the proper man. None of them,
now Balcombe was away, knew of the lifelong hatred existing
between the two. Some had joined where the cattle had started,
and others had been taken on since, and they thought it was only
some temporary estrangement between the brothers.</p>

<p>Jim saddled his horse, filled his waterbag, and started to run
the tracks of the horses back. These took him diagonally up the
ridge, and Jim was three or four miles from the camp when he
reached the reef of rocks on the crest. From that elevation he
could see far over the lower country, the cattle gathered round
the waterhole looking like so many parti-colored dots. Jim
glanced carelessly over it, then fixed his attention on the
tracks, little thinking that he would look no more over the broad
western plains.</p>

<p>In about ten miles or less, the tracks bending round towards
the point where the horses had started, he came on the object of
his search. Dan's horse was dead, and he was sitting propped
against a mulga tree. He scowled at Jim when he saw him.</p>

<p>'How did you get in this mess?' asked his brother. 'Horses
bolted for a muddy lagoon; then the brutes made straight off
here; they were as mad as hatters, and I couldn't get near them
for a long time; then, when I was wheeling them, my horse fell
over a boulder and broke his neck. I've hurt my ankle, broke it
or something, and I can't walk. Give us that waterbag; I'm dead
with thirst,' he added hoarsely.</p>

<p>'Oh! give you this waterbag,' retorted Jim, smiling pleasantly
at the suffering man. 'Didn't you say you wouldn't pay for a
drink for me to get me out of hell, and didn't I tell you that
I'd see you come to me with your tongue out for a drink? It's
happened sooner than I thought for, but I'd be ashamed, Dan
Dacey, to beg from the man whose sweetheart you stole.'</p>

<p>'D&mdash;&mdash;you! Go, then, if you won't give me the water;
don't stop there poisoning my sight. Somebody else will be here
soon.'</p>

<p>'No, they won't; nobody but Jim Dacey could have tracked you
here over that stony country, unless it's Balcombe or Coppertop,
and they're both away.'</p>

<p>Dan turned his face away. The sun had grown hot, and the shade
of the tree had shifted. He crawled painfully after it. Jim held
the waterbag in his hand, and shook it to make the contents
gurgle.</p>

<p>'Sounds pleasant, don't it?' He put the bottle neck to his
mouth and took a mouthful. 'Tastes pleasant, too. To my mind,
there's nothing like a drink of cool water out of a water bag
when you're thirsty. Seems to glide down your throat without any
trouble. Better than all the rum in the world, or a false woman's
kisses.'</p>

<p>'You devil!' muttered Dan. The cruel sun mounted to the
zenith; its vertical rays smote the heated ground, fierce and
pitiless. Jim stood there taunting the wretched man.</p>

<p>Dan groaned in agony. 'I wouldn't have minded so much if they
hadn't the baby,' he said, brokenly.</p>

<p>'What's that?' asked Jim sharply. 'You've got a child?'</p>

<p>'Yes. We christened him just before I left.'</p>

<p>'What did you call the whelp?'</p>

<p>'It's called after you. For me, I'd have christened him Judas
Iscariot before I'd have given him your name; but Louey was sick,
and begged me to; said she hadn't treated you well. Which was a
woman's lie.'</p>

<p>Jim turned round and stood with his hand on his horse's
shoulder. 'I'll give him the water, and help him to camp,' he
muttered; 'not for him, but for the sake of the kid.'</p>

<p>'Jim Dacey!' rang out his brother's voice, in an altered tone.
'Bring 'me that waterbag, or you're a dead man.'</p>

<p>Jim wheeled round. His brother had drawn his revolver from
his belt and had him covered; his face was fiery red with rage
and torment. 'I give you while I count ten,' he continued.</p>

<p>Every softer feeling left Jim Dacey on the instant. If his
brother had waited a single minute the tragedy had never
happened.</p>

<p>'I'll pour it to waste on the ground first,' answered Jim. He
began to suit the action to the word, and Dan mad with fury at
the sight of the clear water that he so craved for being spilled
on the barren ground, fired at him. Jim staggered forward and
fell; his horse snorted, and drew back with a start.</p>

<p>'I was just going to bring it you, Dan,' he gasped, with blood
bubbling in his mouth, 'if you hadn't threatened me.'</p>

<p>There was a quick clatter of hoofs, and Balcombe and Coppertop
rode up.</p>

<p>'I expected some devil's work of this sort,' said the latter
as he dismounted, and bent over Jim. Balcombe came back to the
camp about three hours after Jim left. His first inquiry was if
Dan had returned. When told that Jim had gone back on the tracks
alone he was greatly put out.</p>

<p>'Of course you did not know,' he said to his cousin, 'but you
should have sent some one with him. There is not a better man
than Jim Dacey, but when you are alone with a man for months in
the outside country you are bound to see what he's made of. Jim
Dacey is the best man I ever had with me; but on this subject,
his hatred of his brother, he's not sane, not responsible; and I
don't think his brother is either, but I don't know so much of
him as I do of Jim. I'll go after him. Coppertop, get a couple of
horses up.'</p>

<p></p>

<p>THEY took Jim's body in and buried it at the camp, and Dan
lived on, a moody, taciturn man, for many years. The case, of
course, underwent a judiciary examination, but, under the
circumstances, Dan was not accounted responsible for his
actions.</p>

<h3>A STORY OF SPINIFEX LAND</h3>

<h3>2 April 1892</h3>

<h3>Collected in <i>My Only Murder and Other Stories,</i> 1899</h3>

<p class="first">"CAN'T find 'em, can't you?"</p>

<p>The speaker&mdash;a tall, middle-aged man&mdash;was leaning
against the tail of a horse-dray, addressing a trembling black
boy, of about 14.</p>

<p>"Now, just you be off again, and if you are not back with the
whole lot before sunset down there," and the speaker indicated a
certain point in the heavens, "I'll hide the immortal soul out of
you. I heard the bells just before daylight, so they must be
camped close handy."</p>

<p>The boy gave a longing look at the fire, for the winter
mornings in North Queensland are sharp, and he had nothing on but
his shirt; then, with the bridle trailing over his arm, he
departed in search of the missing horses.</p>

<p>His master, owner, employer (call him what you will) lit his
pipe and laid himself down upon his blankets for a smoke. He was
a man who prided himself on having been a gentleman and owning an
aristocratic name. He also boasted that he could break in a black
boy properly (a small boy, of course), and had a general,
all-round swagger about him that, however, could always be
reduced by reference to a certain of a station he was once
employed on. What time he was conspicuous by his sudden
disappearance and immediate return, after the trouble was over,
with the announcement that he had gone to the back-verandah of
the kitchen to get his revolver. Some of the boys said they found
his tracks under the water-tank.</p>

<p>The sun was high above the spot indicated before the boy
returned, mounted, barebacked, on an old horse with a muffled
bell round its neck. He dropped wearily from its back, having
been belting it along with the hobbles and his bare heels, for a
couple of miles or more. "'Nother fellow gone," he said regarding
the "white" man timidly. "This one bell you bin hear."</p>

<p>Delcourt, the individual in question, got up silently and went
to the tail of the dray.</p>

<p>"Last time I send you after horse," he muttered. "Put my
saddle on," he continued, "I'll go myself."</p>

<p>The boy saddled the old horse obediently while Delcourt, after
rummaging for some time, finally came up with a pair of very
small handcuffs. The boy guessed, from experience, what was
coming; but, after all, it was no great hardship to be handcuffed
to the dray-wheel until Delcourt came back. He could sleep, and
he was tired.</p>

<p>Naturally he supposed that was all that was intended&mdash;to
prevent him running away. He had been served so before.</p>

<p>Delcourt told the boy to go under the dray and he down. He did
so, and his hands were handcuffed through the spokes of the
wheel, over his head, as he lay on his back. Then his "employer"
fastened his shins to two spokes of the opposite wheel with a
couple of saddle-straps. This the boy did not quite understand,
but he was helpless, his feet sticking out from beneath the dray
as far as his ankles, or a little above. "Now, my lad, I'll make
you hop along quick next tune you go to look for horses for me.
I'll roast your lazy toes for you. You've been sitting under a
tree all the morning with the old horse's bell tied up. I'll
teach you."</p>

<p>He dragged a burning log from the fire and put it close to the
soles of the boy's feet, then he piled on a few more sticks, and,
getting on the horse rode away.</p>

<p>For the first few minutes while the fire still smouldered the
warmth was not unpleasant, and the wearied lad dozed off. He was
soon awakened. The fire blazed up brightly, and agonising yells
began to resound through the solitude. They brought no answer,
save the caws of a frightened crow, disturbed from its meal at
the deserted camp-fire.</p>

<p>In about four hours' time Delcourt returned with the missing
horses. The fire had burned itself out, and the boy was either
senseless or dead.</p>

<p>He released him, dragged him from under the dray, and threw a
blanket over him, for at that moment he heard voices and the
tread of horses coming from another direction.</p>

<p>He was busy hobbling the horses when the new-comers arrived on
the scene. Two men with a couple of pack-horses.</p>

<p>"Why, Delcourt," said the first one to dismount, a slight,
dark, wiry little man with a crippled hand, "you've not got far;
we did not expect to overtake you for another thirty miles."</p>

<p>"I've been after my horses all day," returned Delcourt,
rising from his task, "and my boy is sick too."</p>

<p>"What's the matter with him?" said the other, a man with white
beard and hair.</p>

<p>"Fever, I suppose, you know how blacks cave in." One of the
men stopped over the boy and turned the blanket back. "He looks
d&mdash;d queer," he said; "give me some water." The other handed
him a quart-pot full, and he bathed the boy's face and breast,
until he revived somewhat, and drank greedily of the
remainder.</p>

<p>"You fellows going to turn out here?" said Delcourt coolly at
this juncture. Neither answered. The boy, in his clutch at the
quart-pot, threw aside the blanket, and the keen eyes of the
shorter man were attracted by the appearance of the boy's
feet.</p>

<p>"What's the meaning of this, Delcourt?" he said sharply.</p>

<p>"Oh," returned the other carelessly, "we came over some fresh
burnt country yesterday, and the young beggar had been hammering
his horse so I made him walk."</p>

<p>"You liar!" returned the other fiercely.</p>

<p>"We've seen your tracks for nearly sixty miles, and there is
not an acre of burnt country between here and the foot of the
tableland. Besides I've seen scores and hundreds of niggers
hunting over freshly burnt country, but never saw one with feet
like that;" and he pointed to the scorched and crippled
members.</p>

<p>The elder man had arisen by this time, and now spoke before
Delcourt could collect himself.</p>

<p>"This is some of your work," he said, "I have heard of it
before. This time by (here he swore an oath rather too common in
the spinifex country) you shall answer for it."</p>

<p>"The boy did it himself," said Delcourt sullenly in answer,
without resenting the language used to him.</p>

<p>"That shall be seen to," said the other. "Remember both I and
T&mdash;here are magistrates, and if this boy is not brought into
&mdash;&mdash;I'll have a warrant out against you for
murder."</p>

<p></p>

<p>THE boy never came in. Delcourt said that he ran away! Nobody
could do anything. Nobody could prove he didn't run away,
although everybody believed it to be a lie. Delcourt got a
worse name than before, that was all, and he didn't mind
that.</p>

<p></p>

<p>RETRIBUTIVE justice overtook him many years in another land,
where the natives slew him. But although in a certain sense it
was retributive it was not poetical justice; for a British
man-o'-war came along and shot the natives for wiping him out.</p>

<h2><a id="ch9"></a>09. A GUM-TREE IN THE DESERT</h2>

<h3>Collected in <i>My Only Murder, and Other Stories</i>,
1899</h3>

<h3>Reprinted in <i>The Bulletin</i>, Sydney,26 Aug 1959</h3>

<p class="first">
A CREEK, that is to say, a depression in the ground which
began nowhere and, after a brief course, ran out into nothing.
Its one distinctive feature amid the surrounding monotony, a low,
ancient, stumpy, scarred and twisted gum-tree, of scantiest
foliage, rusty and forlorn appearance, A tree, large in girth but
without heart, the mere mockery of a shell.</p>

<p>Around, a dull level of country, neither plain nor forest.
Small belts of mulga, then clumps of stunted shrubs, growing on
arid soil sparsely covered with spinifex and the withered stalks
of other bushes.</p>

<p>But beyond the proud distinction of a gum-tree, or "yalloo,"
as the aboriginal inhabitants of that region would call it, the
creek boasted of a more important claim to consideration. At the
foot of the little bank, beneath the gum-tree, grew a few
dark-green reeds, wiry and short. They grew beside a small and
shallow pool of clear water, so small that one would think a
single day of the desert sun would suck it dry. But the old
gum-tree knew better and had grown up beside the only weak,
struggling, little surface spring there was in all that thirsty
land. The water was slightly brackish and nauseous to the taste,
but for many miles east, west, north and south it was the sole
store Nature had provided in all that desolate region.</p>

<p>The wretched little spring and the old, coreless tree had not
many visitors. At times, some of the gaunt, meagre, ape-like
denizens of the great Western interior would camp there for a
night, halting on their journey across some wide, dry stretch,
but there was no game to tempt them to linger. At other times
parrots, pigeons, or a tired and worn-out kite came in and drank
and rested in the branches of the old yalloo, then hastened on to
a more promising land; but, as a rule, the old tree and little
spring were lonely, silent and unvisited.</p>

<p>It was the time of day when the old gum-tree cast no shadow,
when the wrathful sun looked straight down on the scorched earth,
and the earth lay pulseless and faint, that a dark object came
limping painfully through the cruel spinifex towards the lone
spring. It was a miserable old black gin helping her thin,
decrepit legs along with a yam stick not much thinner than they.
A poor creature, abjectly bent and worn, with scaly skin, blear
eyes and the ribs of a skeleton. How she had missed her fellows
and turned off to this soak-hole, led by some old instinct, it
would be hard to say; perhaps a bad cut in one of her feet would
account for it, but she came hobbling on, until she reached the
place and sank down beside the water.</p>

<p>Even then she did not act as a white would have done, and
plunge her face into the mawkish, tepid stuff; but scraped a hole
alongside for the water to drain into through the sand; then she
drank some sparingly, and lay there a while with the sun beating
on her poor old limbs and body. Revived a little, she arose, went
to an old camping-place, and rubbed some ashes into the sore on
her foot; then, from her miserable dilly-bag, took out some roots
and a few fresh-water mussels. This was her meal, which she
vainly tried to supplement by searching in the damp mud at the
foot of the bank for more mussels. At the foot of the old tree
was an aperture in the shell about the size of the entrance to a
dog-kennel or the manhole of a tank. Into this the old gin
crept, apparently knowing the place, and coiled herself up to
rest and sleep.</p>

<p>Two hours of drowsy heat, of sultry calm, of unbroken
stillness; then, through the haze that rises with the coming of
the afternoon, loomed other figures&mdash;men and horses. Two
white men, with a couple of pack-horses, wild-eyed, with
tucked-up flanks, rode towards the old tree.</p>

<p>Some distance away they pulled-up and one went ahead alone.
When he saw the water he waved his hat and the other followed;
then they hastily unpacked and unsaddled, and the thirsty horses
ran down to the water. There was not much more than room for them
all to drink at once.</p>

<p>"That was a stroke of luck," said one of the men as they
stood looking at the horses, "catching sight of the old tree. You
can generally bet on a little water of some sort where a yalloo
of this kind grows."</p>

<p>"Think there will be enough for them?"</p>

<p>"Yes, this must be a bit of a spring, for there's been no rain
since the country was made, I think," and he looked significantly
at the parched surroundings.</p>

<p>"We had better camp here, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"By Jove, yes, and spell to morrow, too, after such a tying-up
as the mokes have had."</p>

<p>"Not much feed."</p>

<p>"They'll pick-up something amongst the mulga over there."</p>

<p>By this time the horses had finished, and the little hole was
drained dry for the first time. "It will fill again, slowly of
course, but there's plenty of soakage still in this bank," said
one.</p>

<p>They hobbled the horses, made a fire, and camped by the old
tree, which now cast a long shadow.</p>

<p>Inside the trunk the quaking gin had been awakened by their
coming&mdash;had, even with her rheumy eyes, recognised through a
crack the dreaded strangers once or twice seen before at a
distance.</p>

<p>Night had set-in, the tired men slept, but the wretched
creature could not escape even had she had courage, for the
pack-bags and saddles were heaped against the hole by which she
had entered. Slowly the moon rose and lit-up the scene, and from
amongst the long shadows it cast crept forth other darker
shadows, and stole towards the camp.</p>

<p>Blacks, even the most abject, do not desert their sick, old,
or crippled, and some had come back to look for the crippled gin.
But the white men were sleeping at the tree, and although, at
last, emboldened by necessity, they crept in to drink at the
water, the wretched prisoner could not let them know of her
presence, even had she been aware of theirs. The men slumbered
unscathed, the blacks departed; and morning broke, dewless and
oppressive.</p>

<p>"Phew!" said one of the two men, "Look at the niggers' tracks
on top of our horse-tracks. Wonder they didn't knock us on the
head last night."</p>

<p>"Some gins, I suppose, sneaking in for water," returned his
companion. "They travel at night very often in this dry
country."</p>

<p>All that day the men lounged about, and the inside of the old
tree was like an oven, and the frightened creature nearly
shrieked when one with a tomahawk commenced chopping his initials
on the outside.</p>

<p>Night once more, and when the moon was high one of the men
started and roused his companion.</p>

<p>"What the deuce did you groan like that for?"</p>

<p>"Did I groan? Must have been dreaming."</p>

<p>"Don't dream like that again. I never heard such a
groan&mdash;you ought to sell it."</p>

<p>Next morning they saddled up and left, and the tree and the
trampled spring were solitary once more.</p>

<p></p>

<p>IT was many years after settlement of the neighboring
"available" country that the old yalloo succumbed to a high wind
preceding a thunder-storm, and toppled over. And again, some time
after that, a man from one of the stations, visiting the spring,
looked into the hollow trunk of the fallen tree and found an old
mummy huddled-up, nose and knees together.</p>

<p>The remains were sent away as a great curiosity, and an
authority on ethnology wrote a very clever paper proving that
this method of "tree-burial" was analogous to that practised in
many other parts of the world a few thousand years ago, and it
exactly fixed the era of development arrived at by these
Australian aborigines.</p>

<h2><a id="ch10"></a>10. &mdash; THE MARTINET</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, 19 Oct 1901</h3>

<p class="first">
ON a river running through a well-known cattle district in
Capricornia there were two stations, the homesteads of which were
within a mile of each other; one being on the east bank, the
other on the west.</p>

<p>Marangeebar were the name of the eastern and Ulliebong the
name of the western one. Both were managed by their respective
owners, who were, and had been since the first settlement of
the district, fast friends. In fact, on the river they were
regarded as a modern reincarnation of Damon and Pythias. It was a
prosperously slow district in those days: Cattle went on breeding
up from year to year; fats maintained a steady, if modest, price;
the seasons were strangely favorable, and selectors were then
nearly unknown.</p>

<p>Almost everybody on the river had a pet hobby, and plenty of
leisure to indulge in it. Strange to say, Wilson, of Marangeebar,
and Curtis, of Ulliebong shared a taste for natural history,
which helped greatly to cement their friendship. Annually, when
the slack times would set in, and the usual discussion would crop
up in the weekly journals as to whether the young kangaroo was
born in the pouch or placed there immediately after birth, they
would jointly indite scathing letters to the newspapers,
ridiculing the upholders of the first theory.</p>

<p>And when Jim Bolson, the contractor who did most of the
fencing on the river, got hold of the editor of the local paper
during a fit of the horrors, and persuaded him to publish a long
account of a bunyip that Jim swore to having seen in the big hole
at the Fourteen-mile Bend, was it not well known that the
sarcastic letter, signed 'Incredulous,' exposing the absurdity of
the statement, emanated from the near neighborhood of the two
stations?</p>

<p>But one circumstance, above all had hitherto rendered their
course of friendship as unbroken as the pastoral peace of the
district in which they resided, that was, that both of them were
confirmed and sworn bachelors.</p>

<p>Now, the owner of Ulliebong had occasion to pay a lengthy
visit to New South Wales, and was away much longer than he had
mentioned that he intended being; but this fact excited no
suspicion in the breast of his friend, nor did the circumstance
that he received no communication from him, for the friends were
not in the habit of corresponding.</p>

<p>When, therefore, he heard of Curtis's return, no suspicion of
the awful truth entered Wilson's mind, and he calmly prepared to
saunter over the intervening mile in the cool of the evening,
welcome his friend back, stay to dinner, end spend a pleasant
evening.</p>

<p>He was just about to put this laudable intention into
execution, when a mutual friend rode tip to Marangeebar, and
getting off his horse, walked into the house, and, sitting down
without a word of greeting, demanded a drink.</p>

<p>Wilson was a taciturn man, and without expressing any
surprise, produced the required refreshment. The friend, Summers
by name, drank it off, heaved a sigh of relief, and then,
without a word of warning, said: 'Curtis is married.'</p>

<p>At this astonishing, incredible announcement, Wilson, though a
temperate man, had to sit down and help himself to a stimulant.
He would say nothing. The ice being broken, Summers went on:</p>

<p>'They stayed at my place last night. He and his wife and
servant&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Servant!' gasped Wilson, for such a thing as a female servant
had hitherto been unknown on the river.</p>

<p>'Yes, servant. Apparently she comes from the same part of New
South Wales as the bride, and between them they sit upon
Curtis.'</p>

<p>'Sit upon Curtis!'</p>

<p>'Well, figuratively speaking. When Mrs. Curtis feels annoyed
she talks to the servant at Curtis. Brought her up for that
purpose, I should say.</p>

<p>'And how is, he?'</p>

<p>'Broken. Not a word to say for himself.'</p>

<p>'And what is she like?'</p>

<p>'Hum! So-so, nothing much either way. I think her people must
have been the big people of a little district, you understand.
She says that the two chief virtues are total abstinence and
frugality.'</p>

<p>'Does she order Curtis about, then?'</p>

<p>'Order him about? I should think, so! Never saw a man so
changed. Curtis, used to be a masterful man in his way&mdash;
good-naturedly so, without any side, but still he'd have his way
in his own place, and quite right, too. It's "The Taming of the
Shrew" reversed, with a vengeance.</p>

<p>'You'll stay to-night. Summers? I shan't go over now.'</p>

<p>'Stay? Of course; I came with that intention.'</p>

<p>During the dinner, and in the course of the evening, the two
could find no other topic of conversation than their sense of
wonderment, not so much at the dictatorial manner of Mrs. Curtis,
as at the tame submission of their friend.</p>

<p>Wilson determined to put off his call for a fortnight at
least, although he was such a close neighbor and old friend the
husband. He could always plead that the cause of delay was
anxiety to allow them to get settled down first. But when he met
Curtis on the run one day, and the latter pointedly asked him why
he had not been over to call on his wife; he had no recourse but
to promise to come to dinner that evening.</p>

<p>The meeting between the old friends had been constrained on
both sides. Wilson had heard so many strange rumours, and Curtis
evidently that he must have heard them. So, though all was good
fellowship; it was not the good fellowship of former days. True
to his appointment, Wilson crossed the river, and presented
himself at Ulliebong. He found Mrs. Curtis inclined to be cordial
in manner, and her appearance answered to the neutral,
description given by Summers. After declining to refresh himself
with either lime juice or raspberry vinegar, dinner was
announced, and they sat down to it. It was mail day that day, and
Wilson was considerably astonished when, just as they commenced
on some very thin soup, Laura, the servant, a flat-faced,
countrified-looking girl, thrust her head into the room, and
exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p>'Uncle John's taken to drink.'</p>

<p>'Dear me, Laura, how shocking!' said Mrs. Curtis, quite
calmly.</p>

<p>'Yes, m'm,' said Laura, and retired. A few minutes afterwards
she reappeared, and said, 'They're trying to get him to join the
Salvation Army.'</p>

<p>'A good idea, Laura,' replied Mrs. Curtis, in her former
tone.</p>

<p>'Yes, m'm,' said Laura.</p>

<p>Wilson, as before stated, was a taciturn man, and preserved
his countenance. He turned to Curtis, and was about to ask if he
still kept up his natural history, when Laura announced once
more, 'Aunt Jane's got another baby.'</p>

<p>'Another, Laura?' returned Mrs. Curtis, still unmoved.</p>

<p>'Yes, m'm,' said Laura, end vanished.</p>

<p>'It's the seventh, and a fine gel,' was the next piece of
news, and Mrs. Curtis, seeing the bewilderment struggling with
the composure of Wilson's face, vouchsafed an explanation. 'You
see, I have brought Laura up here, right away from her friends,
all of whom I know, and I feel bound to take an interest in her
belongings.'</p>

<p>Wilson then began to comprehend that the mail had arrived that
day, and that Laura was simply retailing scraps of local
information which she had received in a letter from home.
Reassured by this information, for he began to think that he had
got amongst a set of lunatics, he turned to Curtis, and asked his
unspoken question about the natural history, this time aloud.</p>

<p>'No,' replied Curtis; not since my marriage.'</p>

<p>'Do you not think such subjects a great wastes of time, Mr.
Wilson?' said Mrs. Curtis.</p>

<p>'I mean, anyone addicted to study could find so much better
ones. There's the total abstinence question, for instance, and
the theory of thrift.'</p>

<p>'Very good things, both; but, surely, Mrs. Curtis, the study
of natural history has its good points?'</p>

<p>'Merely subordinate ones. I should like to lend you some books
on the subjects I have mentioned.'</p>

<p>Wilson replied hypocritically that he would be happy to read
them, and Laura came in to change the plates, and confide to the
company that 'young Jimmy Jones had been seen but walking with a
girl.'</p>

<p>Wilson presently went home feeling as though he was in some
awful nightmare. He found that Mrs. Curtis had insisted on the
storekeeper and one of the men being discharged. Had taken the
keys of the store herself, and cut down everyone's rations!</p>

<p>'By Jove!' muttered Wilson, as he stumbled across the sand of
the river; 'She'll insist on going out on the run after the
cattle next.'</p>

<p>Things went on unaltered for a week or two, and then Wilson
was surprised by a visit from his old friend.</p>

<p>''You don't want to sell Marangeebar, do you?' he asked, to
Wilson's intense surprise.</p>

<p>'No. Never dreamt of doing so. Why do you ask?'</p>

<p>'Well, Mrs. Curtis rather likes you, and she has written down
for her sister.'</p>

<p>'Yes, but what has that to do with my selling my station?'</p>

<p>'Don't you see? She is going to make a match of if between her
sister end you. I thought you might prefer to sell the place and
clear out in time, if you didn't like the idea. I give you the
hint because we're old friends.'</p>

<p>'I say,' said Wilson, as a sudden idea flashed through his
brain, 'did anything happen to you, any accident, while you were
down south?'</p>

<p>'Only that accident on the race course.'</p>

<p>'Accident on the racecourse? Never heard of it.'</p>

<p>'Oh, they persuaded me to ride in a Steeple-chase when I was
staying with Sarah's (my wife's) people. My horse fell at the
last hurdle, and I got a nasty spill.'</p>

<p>'Hurt your head?'</p>

<p>'I believe so. Anyhow, Sarah nursed me through, like the brick
she is.'</p>

<p>After a little more talk, Curtis rose to go. He refused any
refreshment on the plea that Sarah would smell it, and went away,
Wilson merely remarking with regard to the sister that he would
stay and face the music.</p>

<p>'So the murder's out,' he thought; 'but there seems no help
for it, but I am sorry for Mrs. Curtis if Curtis regains his
proper frame of mind again. Not that she would deserve any pity.
I am afraid her sister is coming up on a fruitless errand.'</p>

<p>Wilson rode over to Summers, and confided to him all he had so
unexpectedly learned; but, though Summers was hugely delighted at
the idea of the sister having been sent for on Wilson's behalf,
he could suggest nothing as regarded Curtis. They could not get
him to go south and see a specialist without the consent of his
wife, and yet it was heartbreaking to witness him tamely
submitting to the tyranny of the 'Martinet,' which was the name
by which she was known on the river.</p>

<p>In due time the sister arrived, and proved to be a fair
counterpart of the 'Martinet,' without her experience.
Unfortunately for Miss Jane, as she I was called, the Martinet
had made things so unpleasant for the neighbors that no one came
near the place, and her bright hopes were disappointed. Wilson
had many invitations sent him, but the invariable excuse was
pressing business in some outlandish part of the run. As Jane
could not storm his citadel, although it was such a short
distance away, she could only fall foul of her sister for having
brought her up on a fool's errand.</p>

<p></p>

<p>IT was mustering time on Marangeebar, and Curtis, who was as
good a station man as ever, was over&mdash;after the usual
custom&mdash;to look after his own strayed cattle, and assist his
neighbor and friend.</p>

<p>One evening they were yarding a mob of cattle, when a beast
made an attempt to break away. Curtis went to turn it in. He had
scarcely put his horse into a canter when it blundered over an
ant-bed, and went down, throwing Curtis on to his head.</p>

<p>When they picked him up he was unconscious, but no bones were
broken. They took him home across the river, and, as he did not
quickly recover, a man was sent for the doctor at the local
township, but long before he arrived Curtis had recovered. Curtis
had recovered in more senses then one, for the old Curtis bad
come back again.</p>

<p>The actual events surrounding his resurrection were, of
course, never fully known, but the results were apparent. Rumor
says that the first to encounter the new Curtis was the
unfortunate Laura. Being left for a short time to look after him,
she, in the guilelessness of her heart, began to read him scraps
of information out of her last letter from home.</p>

<p>Within a short space of time she went squawking from the room,
like a frightened hen.</p>

<p>Her mistress flew to the rescue, and there was a battle royal,
the details of which were never revealed. Curtis strode across
the river to Marangeebar just as the men were coming down from
the drafting yard. They all saw what had happened, and pressed
his hand with affectionate congratulations and sympathy. He took
a fair square peg of whisky, and, looking round on his old
friends, remarked:</p>

<p>'I've been a bit off color the last few months, but I feel as
right as possible now.'</p>

<p>Then Wilson, without any elaboration, told him the facts of
the case&mdash;how one spill had put him all wrong, and another
had restored him to himself again.</p>

<p>'I think I'll stop over here and have dinner tonight, if
you'll have me, Wilson,' he said.</p>

<p>A distracted martinet was pacing the verandah of Ulliebong
that evening. Two or three times she had made up her mind to go
over to Marangeebar In person, and demand the body of her
husband, dead or alive, but each time her courage failed her at
the bank of the river, and she returned. Within a few days the
devoted Laura and the speculative sister departed whence they
came. And within a few months the one time martinet became one of
the most genial hostesses and the most popular woman on the
river.</p>

<p>Wilson and Curtis, when they meet at the bathing hole for
their evening swim, discuss&mdash;as an appropriate
subject&mdash;the question as to the lowest latitude in which the
<i>Ornithorhynchus parodoxus</i> is to be found, in contentment
and peace. And Mrs. Curtis, until other developments in natural
history, which are shortly expected, take place, has started a
collection of moths and butterflies.</p>

<h2><a id="ch11"></a>11. &mdash; A MISSING VESSEL</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, 18 Jul 1896</h3>

<p class="first">
THE scrub, or, rather, jungle, of the coastal ranges of far
Northern Queensland is unique in its way. Underfoot is an
accumulation of dead leaves and, other vegetable debris; soft,
yielding, and noiseless, a veritable carpet of Nature's
providing. Overhead the boughs of the great trees twine and
intertwine, and the long rope-like vines swing and sway in
tangled loops like the cordage of a wrecked ship. It is shady,
cool, and silent&mdash;very silent. The whip-like crack made by
the coachman bird, the coo of a wonga pigeon are the only sounds
that break on the ear. The great buttresses of the trees radiate
in walls on all sides of the giant trunks, and the broad,
baleful, green leaves of the stinging tree are visible here and
there. Tall palms rear their plumed crests and intermingle with
the canopy of leaves above.</p>

<p>On occasional spans of the range there are open spaces of rank
glass, green and matted, and from these vantage points a view of
the ocean can be obtained. Amongst these solitudes primeval still
roam the few remaining tribes of aborigines as yet but little
contaminated by contact with the whites. They know them, of
course, and some even join in the trepang and <i>bêche-de-mer</i>
fisheries, taking temporary service. But they soon, return to the
fastness of mountain and scrub and their former freedom.</p>

<p>On one of these open spaces commanding a bold outlook over the
ocean and the sandy shore of a little cove beneath, stood a
native gazing intently seaward. He was a tall, athletic fellow,
naked, of course, holding in one hand a boomerang and light
nulla; in the other he carried by the tail a dead rock wallaby,
while round his neck were the banded coils of a carpet snake.
Evidently he was not going to bed supperless that night. His gaze
was fixed on the white sails of an incoming lugger, apparently
making for the little cove beneath; a visitor from the Great
Barrier. As the black stood there watching the white man's boat
from his lofty eyrie, so might one of his ancestors have gazed in
amazement at brave Cook in the <i>Endeavor</i> picking the
dangerous way through the lurking coral reefs.</p>

<p>The aboriginal was motionless as he watched the steady
approach of the lugger, until it was quite evident that she
intended running into the little cove for the night; then he
turned, and rapidly descended the steep side of the range. It was
rough travelling, but the native's long legs and hard-soled feet
made little of it, and he soon arrived at a camp of his tribe not
far removed from the beach.</p>

<p>The lugger, with a light and favoring wind, came to an anchor
in the cove shortly before sundown. The crew were enjoying their
evening meal as the sun sank behind the range, leaving behind a
red glow to illuminate a scene of peace and rugged beauty. The
night closed in, and a watch was set for the treacherous and
savage nature of the inhabitants of that part was well known.</p>

<p>In the blacks' camp the scene soon became animated, and the
rhythmic beat of a corroboree was wafted to the ears of the men
on the lugger.</p>

<p>'We shall have some of those bucks off tomorrow,' said the
master of the boat to the man who acted as mate.</p>

<p>'Yes, and we must keep our eyes skinned tonight,' returned the
other. 'You remember, it was not far from, here that they
murdered poor Thornton and two of his men!'</p>

<p>The lugger had come across from a fishing station on one of
the low, sandy islets of the Barrier, to try and obtain some
native labor. A risky job on that part of the coast, almost as
dangerous as recruiting in the Islands.</p>

<p>In the native encampment a large number of blacks were now
assembled, and the fun was growing fast and furious. It is
astonishing how, after a long day's hunting, blacks will
corroboree&mdash;no light work&mdash;until far into the night
Gradually, however, the sounds died down, the fires went out, and
the camp grew silent; and, save the armed watch on the lugger's
deck, not a soul was awake in the lonely cove, sheltered from the
inrush of the long Pacific rollers by the insect-built wall, that
the mightiest wave could not surmount, and live.</p>

<p>The sun rose, unflecked by cloud, promising a day of heat.
Lazily the men roused up, and drew buckets of the clear, salt
water to refresh themselves with by plunging their heads in and
laving their bodies. A few more buckets were sluiced along the
deck, and the smoke from the galley soon began to rise.</p>

<p>On shore it was some time before the natives showed signs of
stirring, for blacks are late sleepers. Moreover, they are
usually saved the trouble of preparing any breakfast, for the
result of the day's hunt is generally consumed the same night.
The men departed one by one, and it might have been noticed that
they took with them far more than their usual supply of weapons.
The gins, save some too old and crippled to move, went away
searching for shellfish and other small game. Two only remained,
watching the lugger, one of them, a rather light-colored gin,
belonging to the tall blackfellow who had watched the incoming
lugger.</p>

<p>After breakfast the men on board hoisted out their boat, and
the owner of the craft and two men went ashore to try and open up
negotiations. The blacks, however, seemed shy and disinclined to
show up. At last the two gins cautiously approached the men, and,
after being thrown a lew paltry presents, they appeared to gain a
little confidence. At first they pretended they did not know what
was wanted; then, as if suddenly enlightened, they made signs
that they would bring the men down directly, and departed. The
skipper paddled back to the lugger, and lay alongside, chatting
with his mate.</p>

<p>'There are the gins again,' said the latter, glancing on
shore; 'but I don't see any men.'</p>

<p>'I think I'll bring those two off, and then the men will show
up,' said the captain.</p>

<p>'Go easy about it,' replied the mate.'I don't like the way
they are carrying on at all.'</p>

<p>The dinghy went to the beach, and the gins explained that the
blacks would be down directly. The captain made them understand
that they might come aboard if they liked, and they readily
consented. When they reached the lugger the mate drew the other's
attention to the change taking place in the weather. A white mist
was gathering on the top of the range, and stealing down the
side.</p>

<p>'A squall,' said the captain; 'better get the anchor up, and
shake the sails out, it will just run us out nicely.'</p>

<p>'There are some blacks,' returned the mate; and some three or
four were now visible holding up their hands to show that they
were unarmed.</p>

<p>'Keep the gins on board,' said the captain as he paddled
back. While the men hauled up the anchor and shook out the sails,
the mate managed to get the two gins, one on each side of a
ring-bolt; and having given them something to eat, to put them in
a good temper, he stooped down, and, as if in fun, snapped a
handcuff round the ankle of one, and then&mdash;passing it
through the ringbolt&mdash;he locked the other cuff round the
other gin's ankle. They took no notice, beyond laughing.</p>

<p>Meantime, the men on shore were bartering with the blacks; the
white mist was creeping faster down the side of the range, and a
sigh of cold air seemed to break up the calm that reigned. The
mate hailed the captain to hurry up. Whether his sudden shout
startled the gins, or they suddenly awoke to the fact they were
fast, it is impossible to say, but, with a loud cry, they both
made an effort to spring overboard.</p>

<p>Of course, they both fell headlong, making the place resound
with their frightened yells. The Captain jumped into the boat and
made an effort to push off, but both he and the man with him were
immediately clubbed to death. Then from every hiding place in the
mangroves darted out the canoes that had been waiting their
opportunity all the morning.</p>

<p>'By &mdash;&mdash;, we're nicely caught,' swore the mate.</p>

<p>'Make all fast, and keep them off if you can,' he shouted,
springing to the tiller. A gust of wind might have saved them,
but it came too late. Just as the lugger began to move slowly the
canoes ranged alongside, and the blacks swarmed into her. The
whites fought hard, but the odds were too many. The mate shot
down the tall black, who was the leader, and then fell, speared
through the body. As he did so the white mist enveloped
everything, and the squall struck the lugger. His body jammed the
tiller, and instead of falling off she gathered way and sped out
to sea.</p>

<p>The blacks scarce knew at first what was happening, for they,
were busy plundering the boat. Suddenly the mist lifted. Their
canoes were gone, and they were far from land. With cries of
alarm they sprang overboard, but how many reached the shores, the
sharks alone know. On, with her freight of dead and two living
passengers, sped the doomed lugger to the Great Barrier.</p>

<p>It was months before she was found, for, steered by the dead
man, she threaded safely a narrow, passage and ran up on a reef
of soft coral. Her decks, however, had been swept clear of all
but three of her ghastly crew. The corpse at the tiller and the
two skeletons shackled to the ring bolt.</p>

<h2><a id="ch12"></a>12. &mdash; THE LIVELY DICK</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, 21 and 28 Oct 1899</h3>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="first">
'GREAT SCOTT!' exclaimed the super of Kamerackity Station as
he tumbled out of his bunk on the morning of a certain day after
the arrival of the team with medical comforts on board, when
there had been a wild scene of hilarity over night, 'if I haven't
forgot all about the horses for old Jenkins!'</p>

<p>Strange to say, whisky and a prevailing idea that we are all
jolly good fellows have a tendency to make people forget what
they ought to remember. Like a man of energy and action, as
beseemed the manager of a cattle station in the land of
Carpentaria, the first thing Mr. Dick Robbins thought about was
retrieving the sin of omission he had been guilty of. Without
waiting to doff his pyjamas and don other garments, he rushed
outside the stately mansion of slabs and iron, that formed the
head station of Kamerackity to see how matters fared.</p>

<p>The sun was a considerable height, and already rather hot. A
dread mysterious silence reigned around, save when it was broken
by the unanimous bellow of three hungry calves in the calf pen,
whose milky mothers were quietly chewing the cud within sight of
them. It might, have been 8 o'clock, 10, or 12&mdash;nay, the
gazer still being confused about the points of the compass, it
might have been 4 in the afternoon, with a declining instead of a
rising sun. It might have been yesterday instead of to-day, or
perhaps even to-morrow, for any sign of life there was to the
contrary.</p>

<p>Rising to the occasion, Robbins proceeded to the blackboys'
camp, and, after an infinity of blasphemy, managed to rouse two
sleepy-headed aboriginals, and start them to look for the horses.
On returning past the kitchen the sounds of a loud discussion
induced him to look in there. One of the fencers was slanging the
cook, whom he accused of drinking a reserve of grog put aside for
morning refreshers.</p>

<p>'Think I'd touch yer jolly rum?' said the indignant cook.
'That's not my sort. Us old hands don't round on our mates like
that.'</p>

<p>'Where is the jolly stuff, then?' demanded the fencer. 'Didn't
I put it there myself last night?'</p>

<p>'Then yer drank it yourself,' returned the cook; and war
seemed imminent as Robbins appeared. Peace spread its wings when
he called them for a 'doctor,' and the other sleepers being
aroused, and likewise doctored, a council of war was held.</p>

<p>Now, the trouble was this: Old Jenkins, the new owner of
Kamerackity, in the district of Carpentaria, Queensland, had
intimated, both by post and wire, his intention of paying a visit
to his new property, and naturally expected to be met with
appropriate means of locomotion at the glorious township of
Mangroveton. All that was known of Jenkins was that he was a
retired Sydney merchant, always dabbling in station property, and
although without practical experience, still making very shrewd
bargains, as he was gifted with good business instincts and much
luck.</p>

<p>Robbins, who had been the manager under the former owners, and
had accepted the offer to remain in charge, knew nothing of his
owner, except by letter. Now, the mailman, had brought word to
Kamerackity that the <i>Lively Dick</i>, the small steamer plying
between Saxonton and Mangroveton, was due in the latter port that
very morning, and that it would behove Robbins to hasten with all
speed to meet the owner of the property in due time.</p>

<p>The blackboys had been dispatched at once in search of the
horses, but, alas, they had returned at night horseless, stating
that 'that feller jolly rogue, altogether clear out,' and now it
was nearly 10 o'clock, not a horse within coo-ee, and Mangroveton
fifty good miles away. All hands determined to do something, and
two impetuous men picked up their bridles and started off to get
horses or die; they got as far as the stockyard before they found
out that they were thirsty, and had to come back for a drink;
then forgot all about their first intention. Meantime calmer
counsels commenced to prevail. Merewether, who was over from the
next station, suggested that they should all 'taper off' a bit,
that the boys would be back with the horses in less than no time,
and that, in point of fact, everything would be all right. Now,
when a man makes a statement that 'everything will be all right'
with a convincing amount of confidence, a feeling of relief will
spread itself throughout any deliberation. Merewether was
unanimously voted a shrewd fellow, and it was agreed that the
process of tapering off should commence forthwith.</p>

<p>But fate had already taken the matter in hand, and the stars
in their courses were fighting on behalf of Robbins in a way he
little dreamed of. Although it was known throughout the district
that Mr. Campbell Jenkins intended visiting his new purchase, it
was not known that he had one fair daughter, and that that fair
daughter intended accompanying him to Carpentaria, or the
desperate state of affairs might have led Mr. Robbins to seek
refuge in a suicide's grave.</p>

<p>Mr. Jenkins was an elderly gentleman, quite destitute of
imagination. He had never travelled but by rail or steamer, he
never read anything but political and commercial articles, or the
reports of his own speeches at temperance meetings.</p>

<p>Now Daisy Jenkins, aged 19, was just the reverse; she had
rather too much imagination, although a good share of common
sense behind it all. In her heart she suddenly desired to emulate
the doings of other lady globe-trotters and perhaps publish a
journal of her adventure; so she decided to accompany her parent
north. Daisy was essentially a nice girl. She had bright eyes,
bright hair, and a bright complexion. She had also a neat rounded
figure, trim ankles, and an eminently squeezable waist. She had
no more idea of what she was going to encounter than her father.
Mr. Jenkins was a highly respectable-looking old gentleman, who
would have commanded respect in any British community of
merchants, and he had no more idea of what he was going to
encounter than his daughter.</p>

<p>If the small centre of population at Kamerackity had
endeavored to keep it up properly, Mangroveton had also been
seized with a determination to outdo itself. Every man of the
population had sworn to bring back the ancient reputation of the
hard-drinking township for once; and every publican had applauded
the resolution, and said it showed a manly spirit, hard to find
in these degenerate days; and those social blisters who went
about bragging that they were real old Gulf hands also applauded
and talked familiarly of old times and got many drinks in
consequence. There were sounds of revelry by night in
Mangroveton's halls of light, and the red, red wine flowed
without stint, for would not the <i>Lively Dick</i> arrive at any
moment with a fresh cargo?</p>

<p>So the joy at night was unbounded, but in the morning there
was blank! despair. Every drop of liquor in the town was gone,
the residents had a collective head on them, and the <i>Lively
Dick</i> had not arrived.</p>

<p>There were numerous gatherings of desperate men, and the
liquorless publicans quailed before the public wrath. There was
stern talk of pain killer, Worcester sauce, and other
substitutes, but each man felt that such a descent would be
unworthy of the occasion. The public accused the publicans of not
keeping enough stock in hand, and the publicans defended
themselves by blaming the abnormal thirst of their customers.</p>

<p>'Why, some of you would only be content with lying down in a
paddock and sucking at a hose laid on to a brewery,' said one
indignant Boniface, wrath with contemplating lost
opportunities.</p>

<p>What could have become of the steamer? That was the question.
It was darkly hinted that she had been decoyed up the Turtle
River, and that even then perhaps the inhabitants of that river
were holding unholy carousals on Mangroveton grog, and the
thought was maddening.</p>

<p>Suddenly, a simple child of the forest; clothed only in a
saddle strap and a boomerang, came in and remarked, 'Teemer sit
down. Alonga a bank. Close up, good way.'</p>

<p>Then there was a sudden joyous awakening. Of course the
steamer was stuck on a mud bank down the river! But why had the
men not come up with a boat and some portion of the cargo? Why
had they not behaved like white men? The crew was strong enough
for the purpose. There was the captain, the engineer, the
fireman, the general utility hand, the Chinese cook and steward,
and a kanaka, who had got religion from the Maryborough Salvation
Army. But this must be looked into afterwards.</p>

<p>It was at once moved and carried unanimously that a boat's
crew should take a boat down the river and, inasmuch as the
boat's crew might forget to come back, it was further agreed that
a mounted party with pack horses should also go down the river,
and that both parties should be bound under the most horrid oaths
to return as speedily as possible to the relief of the thirsty
township.</p>

<p>The noble savage had reported truly. As the boat turned a bend
in the river half an hour after leaving Mangroveton, the anything
but lively <i>Dick</i> was visible, hard and fast on a mud bank.
There was little sign of life on board. An elderly gentleman,
dressed in snowy white, was blinking at them through a pair of
goggles as they approached; the converted kanaka was lazily
throwing coke at a crocodile asleep on the bank; and on a bamboo
chair the awe-struck gazers saw a female figure. The remainder of
the crew were evidently sleeping it off somewhere, and a dismal
groan of disapprobation broke from the boat's crew, which caused
the sleeping crocodile to wake up and promptly disappear.</p>

<p>This awful sound also aroused the female, for it arose from
the chair, and when the foremost of the Mangrovetonians clambered
on board he saw such a vision of beauty, dressed in navy blue
serge, that all he could do was to ejaculate something that
sounded like 'What name?' and sit down on the deck to recover
himself.</p>

<p>Then a solemn hush fell on this piratical crew, who had so
unceremoniously boarded the <i>Lively Dick</i>, and the word was
passed for the remittance man. The remittance man, who was
supposed to be able to interview anybody, from a bishop to a
blackfellow, with credit to himself and the community, managed,
by a vigorous and determined effort, to impart some speculation
into his boiled owl's eyes, and challenged boldly the hidden fire
of the respectable goggles and the bewildering broadsides of the
navy blue serge.</p>

<p>The converted kanaka at this point threw in 'Hallelujah' as a
fitting and appropriate remark. Then the remittance man, with
most elaborate politeness, explained that they wished to see the
captain of the <i>Lively Dick</i>, adding that the craft was
freighted with a valuable cargo of merchandise, the non-arrival
of which had occasioned great loss to the mercantile community,
and in a great measure stagnated trade.</p>

<p>'I am indeed sorry to hear it, but by no means surprised; the
captain of this craft is at the present moment quite unfit for
duty; otherwise we should not be here,' returned he of the
goggles.</p>

<p>The remittance man looked full of sympathy, and expressed,
unqualified disgust at the captain's conduct, and a more
disgusted-looking lot of men than his fellow-pirates could
scarcely be found anywhere; even the kanaka had to give vent to
another 'Hallelujah!'</p>

<p>'Could he see the engineer or the fireman?'</p>

<p>'The engineer, the fireman, and the other man who constitutes
the crew went ashore last night to cut firewood,' replied Mr.
Jenkins, who was of course, the owner of the goggles. 'They have'
not yet returned.'</p>

<p>The remittance man looked incredulous; and all the other
pirates tried to look as incredulous as their eyes would let
them. 'They told me,' went on Mr. Jenkins, 'that that was the
object of their departure. They took a case of weapons with them,
which they in formed me were warranted to kill at fifty yards, to
defend them from the attacks of the natives.'</p>

<p>'Brandy case; Hallelujah!' cried the kanaka.</p>

<p>'It certainly was a brandy case, but I do not know the
contents of it. We heard some strange howlings in the night,
which may have been natives.'</p>

<p>Just at this moment an uproar on the bank announced the
arrival of the land party. On their way down they had come across
the 'crew' fast asleep in the shade of an ant-hill. Having
compelled him, on pain of death, to divulge the whereabouts of
the engineering department, they had likewise unearthed that
department, and some of the weapons, which they immediately
unloaded for fear of accidents; now they were hailing the
steamer.</p>

<p>'Oh, dear!' exclaimed the navy blue serge, really startled a
little; 'what do all those wild looking men want?'</p>

<p>At once a brilliant idea shot across the rapidly clearing
brain of the spokesman.</p>

<p>'Have I the pleasure of addressing Mr. Jenkins?' he asked.</p>

<p>'You have, sir,' replied that gentleman, and, seeing the look
of inquiry in the other's eyes, 'this is my daughter,' indicating
the vision.</p>

<p>'Really, Mr. Jenkins, this is more than provoking,' exclaimed
the remittance man, angrily. 'We knew of your coming, and,
fearing some accident, all our townspeople have turned out to
search for the steamer. The conduct of the men in charge has been
most abominable.'</p>

<p>'Abominable, indeed,' chorused all the pirates.</p>

<p>'I should not wonder,' continued the speaker, 'if they fell
victims to the just vengeance of our friends ashore.'</p>

<p>'Oh, no!' interrupted Mr. Jenkins, hastily; 'nothing of that
sort, please. Their conduct has been bad, but I will take legal
remedies.'</p>

<p>'In that case,' said Harcourt, the remittance man, 'you had
better allow me to go ashore for a few minutes, and explain
matters to our friends.'</p>

<p>Half a dozen strokes took the pirates to land, and in a
secluded spot, out of view of the steamer, Harcourt revealed the
outline of his programme to the choice spirits around him. It was
agreed to at once. Some went on board to assist in getting the
steamer off; some went back to the township.</p>

<p>Their efforts on board were successful. Steam was got up, and
in two hours' time the <i>Lively Dick</i> was alongside the wharf
at Mangroveton.</p>

<p>Poor Daisy felt rather disenchanted at beholding the somewhat
prosaic appearance of the town, which did not seem to offer much
material for her journal; but the kind welcome extended by
everybody, the dignified speech of the police magistrate, who had
had the one policeman pouring buckets of water over him for the
last half-hour, all tended to reassure hear, and the P.M. having
vacated his quarters for the accommodation of father and
daughter, she began to enjoy her adventure.</p>

<p>Mr. Jenkins had duly inquired from Harcourt concerning Mr.
Robbins and his expected arrival, and, having heard from that
worthy a full and most particular account of the well-known
steadiness of his super's character, so that his non-arrival
could only be accounted for by something quite unforeseen and
unavoidable, he too allowed his mind to resume its wonted
balance. Meantime a raid had been made upon all the white suits
in the town, and it was decided that a gorgeous banquet should be
tendered to their distinguished visitor.</p>

<p>The Acting-Collector of Customs having hastily cleared the
steamer's cargo, retired with the P.M. to compose a speech which
should fool Mr. Jenkins to the top of his bent when his health
was proposed. Harcourt dispatched a blackboy with a note to meet
Robbins, and put him up to the state of affairs, so that he
should not be off his guard on arrival.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Daisy, determined to get as much information as she
could for her future journal of travels, had sallied out despite
the heat. Meeting Harcourt, she had impressed him as escort to
show her over the town and explain things generally. This
Harcourt did in a manner which would have drawn tempests of
applause from his numerous admirers. According to him,
Mangroveton was an example of the infancy of a giant; residents
and visitors should feel a thrill of pride at being permitted to
view this promising outcome of the British Empire while yet in
embryo.</p>

<p>'This town, insignificant as it now looks, Miss Jenkins, is
destined to be the Carthage of the north. The banks which
witnessed the mishap to the little steamer that brought you here
will in future see stately vessels glide past freighted with
products from the great emporiums of the East. That space' (he
indicated a space occupied by five melancholy tea trees and the
same number of ant hills) 'is the site of our future Town Hall.
There will be the cathedral; there the&mdash;let me see&mdash;the
hospital, in case we should ever need one in this healthy
climate; and there will arise the walls of some palatial
hotel.'</p>

<p>This was splendid. Daisy really felt a thrill of pride to
think that she should be privileged to witness the scene of so
many future splendors, unvisited even by the gifted authoress of
<i>Cruisings in Many Seas</i>. Surely <i>The Log of the Lively
Dick</i> would rival that famous work. Her spirits rose very
much.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p class="first">
IT was Sunday afternoon, and, as, although there was a future
cathedral, there was no church, Daisy proposed to her new friend,
with whom she was now on the best of terms, that as there was a
harmonium in the P.M.'s private establishment, they should hold
service in the evening. Harcourt enthusiastically seconded the
motion. All the presentable boys were rolled up, and bound over
to good behavior, under penalty of having to swear off for six
months.</p>

<p>It was a delirious success. The P.M., supported by the
Customs, read prayers, and Daisy, with a choir of volunteers,
played and sang hymns.</p>

<p>'Why, what's come of all the fellows?' asked one disgusted old
Gulf hand, who had just woke up, and was looking for someone to
shout for him.</p>

<p>'Up at the P.M.'s, singing psalms,' returned the temporary
barman. 'The boss is up there, too.'</p>

<p>The old hand gasped out something about, 'Well, I'm&mdash;'
and there being nothing else to do, had a long drink of water,
and went to sleep again.</p>

<p>A full account of the choral service, as it was termed, was
immediately wired to Saxonton, making the residents of the town
sit up with envy, and causing them to see more green-eyed
monsters than they usually did. But the banquet!</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Daisy could not grace the board with her
presence. For all that, nothing like it had ever before been
known in the Gulf country. The speech, in which the P.M. proposed
the health of their distinguished guest, and extolled the
glorious future of their district, which had attracted to their
shores a man of such unbounded wealth and business capability,
almost made that gentleman shed tears. In returning thanks, he
publicly forgave the captain and crew of the <i>Lively Dick</i>
for their late conduct, and sat down amidst a hurricane of
cheers. The captain rose to explain.</p>

<p>He was not quite intelligible, but he was understood to mean
that the accident was the result of his sensitive feelings; they
had overcome him at a critical moment when rounding Square Gin
Point. He had lost an angel sweetheart once in his unforgotten
youth, and catching sight of Miss Jenkins at the moment, the
memory brought tears into his eyes, and before he recovered
himself they were ashore. Here he again broke down, and had to go
outside to weep, protesting that ever since Mr. Jenkins put foot
on the deck of the <i>Lively Dick</i> he had venerated him as a
father.</p>

<p>The grey dawn was stealing through the chinks in the slabs
when the remittance man, who was dreaming that he was waltzing
with Daisy Jenkins, was roused from his sweet repose by diligent
shaking. Waking sufficiently to comprehend that Robbins and
Merewether were in his room, having just arrived after riding all
night, he recounted to the fresh arrivals the events of the day
before, and a discussion ensued as to what was best to be
done.</p>

<p>'You can't let the old donkey take the girl up to the station,
you know; that would be too much of a joke,' said Harcourt. 'Good
gracious, man, I'd never look up again. Why if I soaked that
blessed cook of mine in the creek for a week or a fortnight, I
couldn't get the smell of rum out of him,' returned Robbins.</p>

<p>'What's she like?' asked Merewether, stroking his moustache,
with a side glance in the cracked looking-glass.</p>

<p>'Well, her name's Daisy, I believe, and she just is a daisy. I
can't say any more.'</p>

<p>'You fellows must help me out of the scrape somehow,' remarked
the super of Kamerackity.</p>

<p>'I've done my best,' replied Harcourt. 'I've gone bail that
nothing but the most unforeseen of accidents could have detained
you; and have vowed and declared such a character of you as I am
sure your godfathers and godmothers would hesitate to
endorse.'</p>

<p>'I can easily get up an excuse for not turning up in time, but
how on earth to put them off coming up to the station, in its
present condition?'</p>

<p>'I don't know,' returned Robbins. 'Give it a spell, old man;
go away, and get a feed; while I finish my sleep. Something is
sure to turn up.'</p>

<p>'Of course, everything will be all right,' added Merewether,
glad to get in his favorite axiom; and for the time they
parted.</p>

<p>At breakfast, Harcourt had his plan all cut and dried. A buggy
and horses were ready. Daisy was eager to make a start into the
mysterious bush, and Papa Jenkins was still smiling over the
flattery of last night; so the cavalcade departed, amidst the
open-eyed wonder and admiration of Mangroveton, and when the
buggy and attendant horsemen vanished from sight, everybody went
away to sample something.</p>

<p>It being impossible to reach the station in one day, the three
conspirators&mdash;for such they now were&mdash;had arranged to
camp half-way at the crossing of one of the principal rivers, and
had prepared accordingly. Harcourt, who was driving, kept drawing
Mr. Jenkins's attention to the wonderful productions of nature
along the road.</p>

<p>'Ant hills, sir, that only require knocking down and pounding
up with water to make the most splendid bricks imaginable. Timber
that the white ants refuse to look at; miles superior, sir, to
the far-famed jarrah of West Australia. Why, even the Gulf
natives show powers of endurance that&mdash;'</p>

<p>Here he stopped suddenly, and beckoned to Robbins, who was
riding close behind. He leant over, and whispered something
impressively to him.</p>

<p>'No, I don't think there will be any about; we didn't notice
any as we came down,' returned Robbins in a louder key, audible
to the other occupants of the buggy.</p>

<p>'That's all right,' answered Harcourt, apparently much
relieved. 'At any rate, we can sacrifice two boys, as usual, if
there is trouble.'</p>

<p>Presently, Robbins and Merewether went on ahead with the two
black boys; and when the buggy overtook them, they found that a
shady camp had been improvised on the bank of the river.</p>

<p>Daisy was supremely delighted with everything; for,
fortunately, it was a tolerably cool day, and even Mr. Jenkins
began to think that he would be able to tell of his experience as
a daring pioneer, without having undergone much real discomfort.
The boys were most attentive, and everything looked
promising.</p>

<p>Towards evening, however, Merewether came up from the river in
great haste.</p>

<p>'They're here, after all,' he said. 'More than ever I saw
before.'</p>

<p>'You don't say so?' cried Robbins and Harcourt together. 'What
a good job we did not try to cross.'</p>

<p>'May I inquire what is wrong?' asked Mr. Jenkins, whilst
Daisy, who was writing up the <i>Log of the Lively Dick</i>,
looked up rather startled.</p>

<p>'Oh, nothing, nothing. Don't disturb yourself,' said Harcourt;
'only a little inconvenience that we thought we had guarded
against.'</p>

<p>'Are the natives coming?' asked Daisy.</p>

<p>'No, Miss Jenkins; the natives about here are quite harmless.
To tell you the truth, it's the crocodiles. They sometimes
assemble here in such numbers that for weeks it is impossible to
cross.'</p>

<p>'Are we quite safe up here?' hastily inquired Mr. Jenkins.</p>

<p>'As safe, if not safer, than, you would be in Sydney. The only
difficulty is crossing to-morrow.'</p>

<p>'I hope they don't get hold of Dickie; he's down after the
horses, hunting them back from the edge of the water,' said
Merewether.</p>

<p>At this instant there was a wild aboriginal yell from the
waterside, and two or three of the horses came galloping up in
their hobbles, snorting, and startled. Daisy caught hold of
Harcourt's arm, who happened to be nearest to her, and Mr.
Jenkins, with great presence of mind, got into the buggy, and put
her umbrella up.'</p>

<p>'Crocodile catchem Dickie!' said the other black boy, very
coolly. Agonising cries and frantic splashings were now heard
from the water.</p>

<p>'Oh!' cried poor Daisy; 'Do, do try to save him,' and before
the men could stay her, she was off down the bank, with them
after her, calling to her to stop, leaving Mr. Jenkins seated in
the buggy crying out loudly for the police.</p>

<p>Meantime the black boy increased his alarm by screaming with
laughter, shouting out in between, 'My word! Crocodile catchem
Dickie! No you bin hear 'im sing out?'</p>

<p>When the party reached the edge of the water, all was still.
Save a few ripples, there was no sign of the tragedy that had
just taken place. Daisy was very white and frightened. The men
did not dare look at one another, and from the top of the bank
came continued calls for the police.</p>

<p>'It is of no use our staying here, Miss Jenkins,' said
Harcourt at length. 'I really must insist upon your coming back
to the camp. You are not safe, here.'</p>

<p>Daisy took his arm.</p>

<p>'Did they really eat the poor fellow?', she said, with big
tears in her eyes, as Harcourt led her away. Robbins and
Merewether looked guiltily at each other.</p>

<p>'She's a thorough little brick,' said the former at last. 'We
must keep her from being frightened again.'</p>

<p>Merewether nodded, and they followed back to camp.</p>

<p>''I suppose you did not see anything of the unfortunate black
lad?' asked Mr. Jenkins from the buggy. 'Why does this native
seem so extremely amused at his companion's death?'</p>

<p>Robbins said that it was a way they had; and asked the
proprietor of Kamerackity to step aside with him for a
moment.</p>

<p>'This is most unfortunate, sir, the crocodiles turning up like
this; it may detain us some considerable time; and I suppose you
do not intend making any lengthened stay?'</p>

<p>'No. But cannot we cross the river where there are no
crocodiles?'</p>

<p>'This is the only crossing place in the river; but we will
manage it. I certainly never tried it before, but I will now. We
have still one boy left.'</p>

<p>'Whatever can you mean, Mr. Robbins?' asked Jenkins, somewhat
startled.</p>

<p>'Nothing particular, sir. I may as 'well tell you, though; and
then you can give Miss Jenkins a hint not to feel alarmed at any
noise she hears during the night.'</p>

<p>'Mr. Robbins; I insist upon your explaining yourself.'</p>

<p>'Well, the truth is,' commenced Robbins&mdash;here he suddenly
stopped, and called to Merewether. 'You'd better slip the
handcuffs on Jerry,' he went on to his friend, when, he joined
them. 'I think he smells a rat.'</p>

<p>'Tell me at once what all this means?' insisted the now
thoroughly alarmed Jenkins.</p>

<p>'Nothing shall hurt you, sir; rest assured. As I told you, I
have never done it before; but I have heard of it. You see you
and Miss Jenkins must be our first care. Now, the crocodiles will
be quiet for a time, digesting Dickie; when they wake up again
about 2 o'clock in the morning, we will give them Jerry, and that
will serve them till we get safely across. Coming back, we will
bring two fresh boys. But we must chain Jerry up to-night, or he
might give us the slip.'</p>

<p>The eyes of the respectable merchant grew wild with
horror.</p>

<p>'Why, it would be murder,' he gasped. 'Let us turn back at
once.'</p>

<p>'But you must see the station,' remonstrated the manager.</p>

<p>'I am quite satisfied, I assure you. We will turn back. Do you
mean to say that the practice you mention so coolly, is often
indulged in?'</p>

<p>'Not often,' said Merewether, 'but I believe it's a good
plan.'</p>

<p>'Well, if we don't go on, sir, we will turn back in the
morning, it is too late now; but pray, don't mention what we have
been talking about.'</p>

<p>'Not for worlds,' replied the old gentleman, as he turned back
to camp, much relieved.</p>

<p>'Look here, you fellows,' remarked Harcourt to the others, 'we
must resuscitate that nigger somehow; it's taken all the fun out
of the little girl's trip; I don't like it.'</p>

<p>After tea, when Miss Jenkins had somewhat recovered her
spirits, and was chatting a little again, a rustling was heard in
the grass as of someone approaching.</p>

<p>'Dickie come up,' said Jerry, as if it was a matter of course
for a blackfellow to be eaten by a crocodile one minute and turn
up smiling the next. Daisy looked on, half frightened, as Dickie
marched in, with a broad grin on his face, and sat down alongside
his companion.</p>

<p><i>'Bugee titu inkum barrabar?'</i> said Jerry.</p>

<p><i>'Yow, dutor, dum, dum, dum, dum, cheear,'</i> replied
Dickie, with a wide sweep of his arm.</p>

<p>'What does he say,' Mr. Robbins?' cried Daisy, with wondering
eyes.</p>

<p>'Says he dived down and got away from them, and then swam
right up the river.'</p>

<p>'Oh, I am so glad,' said the girl. 'I shall sleep now. Good
night,' and with a bright smile which each man appropriated to
himself, she tripped away to the tent that had been pitched for
her beside the one for her father.</p>

<p>'You were quite right, Harcourt,' said Robbins, after a long
and silent smoke, during which Mr. Jenkins had also departed.
'She is a daisy, every inch of her.'</p>

<p>'Yes,' returned Merewether, 'and would settle down to bush
life in no time,' and they all sighed deeply. Presently, Harcourt
got up and went over to the back of the buggy, and the two others
followed, and a strange and mystic sound like unto the drawing of
a cork, was heard. Then that deep, mysterious, solemn hush of the
bush, that Australian poets are always raving about, fell over
everything.</p>

<p>The return of the party to Mangroveton surprised nobody; they
had got beyond that feeling. The <i>Lively Dick</i> was about to
return, and the skipper was clothed and in his right mind, and
vowed that he would not think of his lost angel sweetheart until
the party were transferred to the large steamer at the mouth of
the Saxon River.</p>

words, in the "hidden kingdom"<br>
genre, set in the high mountains of what was then Dutch New Guinea.</i></p>

<hr>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="first">
THE quick-falling night of the tropics seemed to close in
faster than ever that evening. There was one, sudden, blood-red
gleam on the western horizon, and then the sullen masses of vapor
merged, at once, into black night.</p>

<p>There was scarcely any lightning, excepting some distant,
fitful glimmerings, accompanied by a low, ominous muttering. The
air was dead calm, and stifling, and the men lounged about the
deck, gasping, almost.</p>

<p>Moraine walked impatiently up and down, anon glancing to where
the northern coast of New Guinea had been visible while daylight
lasted. All sail had been taken in; but a jib and staysail were
ready for hoisting directly a puff of wind would give us a chance
to creep a little farther away from the dangerous proximity of
the land.</p>

<p>So time crept on in the still gloom, and the schooner lay
helpless, without steering-way on her. Suddenly there was a blaze
of blinding white light, accompanied by an instantaneous, crash
of thunder, as though a world was falling in pieces. Moraine
sprang to the wheel, giving orders to hoist the staysail. The
next moment the tempest leaped on us with a scream of fury. The
schooner reeled over as though struck by a mighty blow, and I
thought she was going to turn turtle; but she recovered herself,
and they were able to set the jib, for a lull took place for a
second, and Moraine and the mate managed to get the schooner's
head to wind. Then the hurricane came on again, and, it seemed to
me, animated by seven devils worse than the first. I would have
crawled aft to speak to Moraine, but conversation was impossible
even had one been gifted with the lungs of a Domain orator.</p>

<p>Everything had been battened down in readiness, and for a time
she stood up to it gallantly. But as the wind continued in
unabated fury it was evident that our fate was sealed, and that
we were gradually but surely making leeway, and drifting down on
the New Guinea coast. The sea, too, was rapidly rising, and the
waves that the taut little schooner had ridden over at first now
buried her nearly under, and occasionally swept her clean fore
and aft. I had made myself partially fast with the bight of a
rope, ready to cast off when the inevitable smash came, but
whether there was anyone else left on board I did not know. For
aught I could tell in that fury of wind and sea, and the reeling,
staggering craft, every soul might have been swept overboard and
I left alone to go ashore with the vessel. I had fallen into an
apathetic state when we struck at last. I felt that we were going
up on a-mighty wave, and knowing that the end was come I threw
off the bight of the rope, but still retained my hold of it. Down
we went, but the shock was not nearly so violent as I expected.
Then came another giant wave, and again we were lifted and hurled
forward.</p>

<p>Things seemed quieter then; the wind appeared to roar overhead
of us, and the seas only came in showers of pelting spray; the
schooner, too, was upright and steady. Wondering much what had
happened, I prepared to make a tour of the vessel, and see if I
could find any other human beings. I turned my steps, but had not
gone far, feeling my way in the Stygian darkness, before I ran
against somebody doing the same. We caught held of each other,
and roared out our names, for the noise and riot of the wind and
the incessant peals of thunder rendered ordinary speech
impossible.</p>

<p>It was Moraine.</p>

<p>'Follow me!' he yelled. I did so, and he groped along to the
companion way, and so down to the cabin. Here we could speak.</p>

<p>'What's happened?' I asked.</p>

<p>'Thrown up amongst the mangroves,' he replied. 'It's saved our
lives, but the schooner will never come off. There's a riding
light down here, if I could only find it and light it.'</p>

<p>After a little while he was successful, and we returned to the
deck to muster up whoever might be on board. Only four of the
crew turned up&mdash;two kanakas, a Manila man, and the old
Malay <i>serang</i>. We found the body of Bowler, the mate, lying
on the deck. He had been dashed against the mast, and his skull
fractured. The rain was falling in torrents, and the wild
north-west hurricane hurtling overhead. We could do nothing but
wait for daylight, so we assembled in the cable, and Moraine
found a providential bottle of rum, and served out a very
grateful nip all round. Then followed a dreary time of waiting
and watching until daylight came. When it was fairly light
Moraine and I went on deck to view our surroundings. There was
not much to see; the rain still poured down as it only does in
New Guinea.</p>

<p>The force of the hurricane had somewhat abated, but it still
roared overhead. For the rest we lay on a bed of mud, surrounded
by the dense foliage of the mangroves, but how far the swamp
extended we were unable to see on account of the rain which
enveloped everything in a shroud of falling water. Apparently the
schooner was uninjured to any great extent, but as we possessed
no means of getting her off she might just as well have been a
total wreck.</p>

<p>The old <i>serang</i> coming on deck, Moraine told him to call
the others up, and go forward and make some coffee and get
breakfast.</p>

<p>'This comes of trusting to yarns about new banks,' he said, as
we returned to the cabin.</p>

<p>To explain matters I may as well state that Moraine, who owned
a large pearl-shelling station on Prince of Wales Island, had
heard from some vagrant Malays of rich banks of pearl-shell off
the northern coast of New Guinea, and had determined to go round
and try and find them. Moraine was an old friend of mine, and as
I happened to be at Thursday Island at the time, and he told me
of his projected cruise, I volunteered, to accompany him as a
passenger, which offer was cordially accepted. As ill-luck would
have it, the north-west monsoon set in exceptionally early that
season, and hardly had we reached the indicated locality when the
hurricane burst that put us in our helpless position. There was
nothing to do all day but discuss the situation, for the rain
still continued falling in sheets, and blotted out all view of
our surroundings. We had two good boats on board, and Moraine
thought that we might possibly get these into the sea, and make
for German New Guinea, whence we could pick up a steamer.
However, we could do nothing until the rain ceased, which it did
about midnight that night.</p>

<p>The morning was as clear as though such a thing as a storm was
unknown in that region. Ascending the rigging, Moraine and I were
able to take in our position. We had been carried about three
hundred yards into the mangroves, and from the look of things it
appeared as though we should be able to launch the boats at high
water without having to drag them far through the mangroves.
Shoreward the mangroves stretched for about half a mile, when
they met a sandy slope on which grew some straggling pandanus
trees. Beyond its crest we could not see. Westward the forest of
mangroves was unbroken until a point was rounded. Eastward the
mangroves died away and became a sandy beach, which, looked as
though it would make a good landing-place.</p>

<p>Somewhat comforted, we descended. The state of affairs looked
promising, although Moraine had lost his schooner, and vitiated
the insurance by taking her into unknown waters. Much against our
will we had to consign the body of poor Bowler, the mate, to the
slime and ooze of the mangrove swamp, for it was impossible to
take it either to sea or shore.</p>

<p>We then started the men, under the serang, to cut a passage
through the intermixed boughs and twisted roots of the mangroves,
to the sea. This was not a very long job, and by the afternoon it
was finished, and by that time we had the boats down ready for
tugging out Into the sea. The tide suited, and by the evening we
had them both afloat and snugly secured amongst the outer belt of
mangroves for the night.</p>

<p>Discussing our movements, we determined to first investigate
the sand to the eastward next morning, and then form our plans
for escape. This was a mistake of judgment altogether, and I
wonder we fell into it so easily. If we had occupied the night in
stocking the boats and made straight off whilst the weather was
fine we could have escaped what afterward befell us. By our
calculations we were near the mouth or mouths of the Amberno
River and in face we were actually on a delta between two of its
many mouths. All that is known of this river was from an ascent
made by Mr. Van Bram Morris, who reported shallow water sixty
miles from the sea, but it was supposed that he did not find the
main stream. Neither could we have been off the main mouth, for
the river in flood makes a strong off-shore current, which might
have saved our schooner.</p>

<p>Next morning we started in one of the boats, leaving the
serang and the others to get certain stores ready packed for our
projected boat voyage, We had plenty of arms, but did not expect
any annoyance from the natives, as the schooner was too well
concealed amongst the mangroves. We landed at the point we had
seen from aloft, and found the country clear and open, but of the
usual sandy, barren character common to the coast. From a hill,
the country, as far as we could see, to the eastward was also
clear and free from mangroves.</p>

<p>We turned, and were descending, when, looking westward,
towards where our unfortunate schooner lay in its forest dock, I
saw three war canoes coming round the corner, evidently bound for
our helpless craft. In an instant we were flying down to our boat
and pulling desperately for the schooner. They had reached the
opening cut in the mangroves long before us, had swarmed over the
vessel in no time, before resistance could be offered, so
unexpected was it; and when we reached there we found the
entrance guarded by the canoes, and our vessel evidently
captured. This was a facer. Even with our magazine rifles we
stood no show against three great war canoes, full of men armed
with bows and arrows. The men in the canoes did not offer to
molest us; but motioned to us to keep off; so we kept off. There
was simply nothing else to do.</p>

<p>Presently, some of them came down through the mangroves, and
got into one of the canoes. They started towards us.</p>

<p>'Better see the matter out quietly,' said Moraine. 'We can't
run, and we can't fight.'</p>

<p>As the canoe approached one man, who appeared from his
headdress to be some sort of chief, hailed us, but what he said
we could not make out, so we simply stayed quiet until they came
alongside. This individual did not speak any more, but looked
curiously into our boat, and motioned us to hand him our two
rifles. We had no alternative, and did so. Reaching over he took
the painter of our boat, and made it fast to the stern of the
canoe, and then they started towing us.</p>

<p>'This is an entirely new sensation,' said Moraine, filling and
lighting his pipe; 'better take it coolly. These fellows don't
seem vicious, unless they intend making long pig of us.'</p>

<p>I followed his example, and in this strange fashion we went on
to the westward. We could not see much of our lost schooner as we
passed her, but there seemed no excitement of any sort going
on.</p>

<p>As we went on the day grew hot. The chief hailed us, and threw
us a couple of coconuts on board, which was an act of
consideration we appreciated. Very soon we turned into the
entrance of a wide inlet, which gradually led us into the mouth
of a river, still surrounded by the eternal mangrove forest. Up
this river we proceeded, and it was not until the sun was getting
low that we reached higher country. After leaving the mangroves
for good the current of the river, increased in strength, and on
tasting the water I found it fresh, or nearly so. About two hours
before sundown we came to a native village, a good-sized one.
too, with large houses, with turtle-backed roofs, capable of
containing many families. There were sago plantations, and a
grove of coco-palms; and what with that and the children and pigs
knocking about, the place seemed quite civilised. This I wondered
at the more, as I knew that this portion of Dutch New Guinea had
been seldom visited.</p>

<p>The chief beckoned to us to leave the boat, and when we
stepped ashore he led us to a fair-sized house that was empty,
and indicated by signs that it was ours. A woman brought some
mats and put them down on the floor. The chief&mdash;I call him
'chief,' but there are no chiefs in this part of New Guinea; only
every tribe has a kind of headman, who does not possess much
authority&mdash;then left us and went back to the river, and
standing at the door of our newly-acquired villa residence, we
saw, to our astonishment, another canoe approaching, towing, our
second boat, laden with stores, and Judge our surprise, when in
the stern of it we recognised our Malay serang. We stood and
watched, unable to understand what was intended by these strange
proceedings. Under his direction we saw some of the men take up
several packages that he pointed out; then, taking one himself,
the whole party came towards where we were standing.</p>

<p>'Hullo, <i>serang</i>; I thought you were done for!' said
Moraine, when he was within hearing.</p>

<p>'Thought so, too, sir, when these fellows came aboard,' he
answered, with a grin; 'but they seem a good sort after all.'</p>

<p>'Have a fight at all?'</p>

<p>'No, sir. These fellows too quick.'</p>

<p>'Just as well. Where are the others?'</p>

<p>'Still aboard, sir. All safe. I understand them a little, and
they told me to pick out what things you would want, and come
here with them.'</p>

<p>The men had put the things down and gone away. There was
everything we wanted to make us comfortable; but that, of course,
was owing to the serang, the Papuans themselves could not have
picked them. The other things they had brought they put into one
of the other houses.</p>

<p>They were only cases, taken at random from what few stores we
had on board, for, of course, we had not much with us. Before
dark the headman came up and spoke to the <i>serang</i>, who
partially understood him, for he had been knocking about the
coast of New Guinea before.</p>

<p>'He wants to know if you will be comfortable?' said Rastan,
interpreting.</p>

<p>'First rate, tell him,' said Moraine; then as the headman
moved away he went on, 'Well, I have heard that some of the
Papuan tribes have a great deal of natural politeness, but, by
Jove, Charley, this beats all.'</p>

<p>The next morning the canoes, with our two boats in tow, went
down the river, and as they took the <i>serang </i>with them we
concluded they were going to the schooner; and this proved
correct, for in the evening they returned with the pump and
diving gear.</p>

<p>Meanwhile we had passed the day rambling about the village
quite unattended. We found much to interest us in it, and the
inhabitants seemed perfectly friendly, and showed us their
weapons and other implements readily and cheer fully, explaining
their uses by dumb show.</p>

<p>The next morning the headman came to us, and, through Rastan,
asked us if we would go with him a short distance, at the same
time pointing to a not very distant rise. We had no mistrust, and
agreed to at once. It was about five miles to the rise, and we
found it much higher than we thought. On ascending it we had a
splendid view of the mountain ranges of the interior rising in
tiers one over, the other. But what made Moraine and, I utter an
exclamation of surprise was, that far, far away, rising above the
intervening ranges, were snow-clad peaks, their crests just
visible, one only ascending in solitary grandeur above the
others.</p>

<p>'The Charles Louis mountains,' said Moraine, after a long
pause.</p>

<p>The headman said something to Rastan.</p>

<p>'He says that we are going there in a day or two,' said Rastan
to us.</p>

<p>'Going there! Where?' I asked.</p>

<p>The headman, as if he understood the question, pointed to the
snowy peaks.</p>

<p>This was cheerful sort of information. We were prisoners after
all it seemed.</p>

<p>'How are we going? Ask him,' said Moraine.</p>

<p>Rastan repeated the question, and the headman pointed to where
a broad river could be seen winding its way in the distance; at
the same time he said something in reply.</p>

<p>'There are those who will come for us shortly,' Rastan
translated.</p>

<p>The return home was under circumstances of a somewhat moodier
sort than what we set out in the morning. We had begun to hope
that the natives were friendly by their own account, and we
should be able to treat with them to get away.</p>

<p>Now it seemed that we were merely reserved for an unknown fate
in an unknown region. More over, we had not the slightest chance
of escape either by land or sea. Moraine, with his usual
philosophy, accepted the matter, and when we returned had a good
stiff nip of the rum they had kindly restored to us, ate a hearty
meal of some particularly nice fish that they brought us, and
smoked the pipe of indifference after it. I followed his example
and felt the better for it.</p>

<p>'Look here, Charley!' he said, 'we've neither of us wives nor
families, and nobody who will particularly miss us, so what's the
odds. We can't get away, and must face the music. For my part I
think that they can't mean us much harm, or they would not have
been so deuced civil.'</p>

<p>On consideration I agreed with him, and we grew pretty well
resigned to the situation, if not exactly contented.</p>

<p>It was some three days after this communication that there
seemed a little excitement visible amongst the natives. Towards
noon it increased, and what was the amazement of Moraine and
myself when a large kind of barge appeared coming down the river,
the crew rowing and not paddling, and equipped in a sort of
uniform. Moraine and I watched astounded. Were these the people
who were, going to take us away? It seemed so, for the man who
sat in the stem with all the dignity of an officer of a
man-of-war, stepped on to tire bank, and, with a few words with
the headman, approached us.</p>

<p>He was dressed in a white suit, cut something after the manner
of a pyjama suit. His face was handsome; and hairless, bearing
rather a Semitic cast. His color was a clear olive, and
altogether he was a striking and noticeable figure, nearly, six
feet in height. He approached us with a genial smile of greeting,
which so impressed us that we both involuntarily stepped forward
to meet him.</p>

<p>'Good day, gentleman,' he said in perfect English. 'Glad to
make your acquaintance, although, it might have been under
happier circumstances.'</p>

<p>He extended his hand, and we fill cordially shook: 'This is
not the region for visiting cards,' he went on, 'so we must
exchange names. My name, outside of New Guinea, is Captain
Willis, a Purser's name. My own is Doria Papwan.'</p>

<p>'And mine is Charles Beckford,' I said.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p class="first">
'WELL, gentlemen,' said our new friend; 'Perhaps, as I am
better equipped than you, will you come and lunch with me? I can
offer you something better to drink than rum.'</p>

<p>We accepted his invitation, and strolled down to where an
awning had been erected by the crew of his barge. Underneath
lunch was laid out in civilised style, and he certainly kept his
word, and gave us some excellent claret.</p>

<p>'I can see,' said this strange man, 'that you are wondering
who I am, and where I come from. Since you are going to favor me
with a visit, which will probably prove an extended
one'&mdash;Moraine glanced at me, but said nothing&mdash;'it is
only fair I explain matters. The European ancestors of the people
of our settlement, if I may give it such a name, date as far back
as the beginning of the seventeenth century, and were the crew of
a Dutch ship wrecked between where we are now and Astrolabe Bay.
They saved most of their effects and boats, and had started for
Batavia, when, in coasting along, they noticed this inlet, and
came in to examine it. There they fell in with two Portuguese
sailors, castaways, who had been living with these natives, who
have always been of a friendly disposition. These two fellows
told them of a wonderful country in the interior, which they had
seen in their wanderings, which so excited the curiosity of the
Dutch that they determined to go there.</p>

<p>'You must remember that the craze of that age was discovery,
and it was not strange, then, for a party of ship-wrecked sailors
to start on such a hare-brained expedition. They went up this
river, they reached the country seen by the Portuguese, and they
liked it so well that they settled down there. They found a
distinctive race up there, of whom I will tell you more another
time. The Dutch were not strong enough to dispossess them; but
they managed to secure the power and authority. The Captain was a
typical man of those days&mdash;shrewd and masterful; he kept up
his communications with the coast, and also with Java, by means
of native vessels, thus maintaining the secret of their country.
His brother was amongst the crew, and he sent him on one of the
voyages in disguise. The Dutch authorities detected him, seized
him as a deserter, and hanged him. The native crew managed to
escape, and brought back the news. This naturally embittered the
captain against his countrymen, and he swore that the secret of
the rich tableland should never be known by them. Thereafter he
traded through Malay traders with the Spanish and Portuguese
settlements. A Malay, as perhaps you know, is one of the most
secretive of men. With them he was safe.</p>

<p>'The Dutch took wives from the race they had settled amongst,
enacted good laws, simple and natural; sought no religious
changes, and before the captain died the people had learnt to
love and respect him. His son, carefully reared and educated by
his father, carried on the government, And I am a descendant,
although not direct, of his line.'</p>

<p>Needless to say, this story was told; when we had finished our
meal, and our host, in addition to the excellent claret, had
provided us with some first-class Manilla cigars.</p>

<p>'I must tell you that we have been recruited by many castaways
since the formation of our race as a people. In the early days
two of Dampier's sailors joined us. But the largest number of
recruits we got at the beginning of this century. I suppose you
know that the British East India Company once took possession of
New Guinea, and formed a station on the shore of Geelvink Bay?
When they were leaving the transport was blown off by a storm,
and a subaltern, a sergeant, and about fifteen rank and file,
were left behind. Our people heard of their position, for the
natives keep us informed of everything that happens on the north
and east coasts, and messengers were sent to them. They consented
to come, and they stopped and settled down. They were all
intelligent men, and the Ensign, my grandfather, entered into the
progress of the community with enthusiasm. He married the
daughter of the then Governor, and succeeded him, which accounts
for my present position.'</p>

<p>Willis paused, and Moraine asked him if he was then the
present Governor, to which he replied in the affirmative.</p>

<p>'I may add that our population is now quite sufficient, and we
are In no more need of recruits; but the natives still keep us
supplied with information, and a special motive brought me down
to see you. We are in want of a doctor. Our medical man died the
other day, and although I expect two of our young men back
shortly, who are studying in London, it will be some time before
they are here. Meantime we want somebody.'</p>

<p>'Studying in London?' I said, in amazement.</p>

<p>'Certainly; I was educated in England, and a proportion of our
young man go there at intervals for their education. They are
brought up as engineers, architects, electricians, etc.'</p>

<p>'But how do you manage to keep the secret of your existence
from the world?'</p>

<p>'Very easily. I have a capital little steam yacht. She lies in
a hidden pool in the mangroves. She is registered with papers all
complete, and she runs over to Singapore, as a rule, during the
south-east winds. Singapore is a free port, where you come and go
as you like, no questions asked, and as there are trait from
every imaginable part of the world there, we axe unnoticed.'</p>

<p>'Well,' I said, 'I don't practise as a doctor now, but I am
one. I never liked the profession, and when I came into some
money I slung it.'</p>

<p>'Well, I'm in luck. What do you profess, Mr. Moraine.'</p>

<p>'Nothing useful. I was a broken squatter before I took to
pearl-shelling.'</p>

<p>'You will be able to help me, too, and I must thank both of
you for paying me this friendly and unexpected visit.'</p>

<p>Moraine looked hard at me.</p>

<p>'Now we will go round and see if it is possible to get your
schooner afloat.'</p>

<p>He strolled-down to his barge, leaving us alone.</p>

<p>'Seems a mild-mannered kind of pirate,' said Moraine. 'Did you
notice how quietly he put it that we were paying him a visit of
our own accord?'</p>

<p>'Yes; there's a decided hand of iron under the velvet glove.
But I'm getting interested in the adventure now, and wouldn't
turn, back even if we could.'</p>

<p>'I'm the same; but it is remarkable how all the visitors to
this wonderful country decided to stop here. Shall we do the
same?'</p>

<p>'It seems a case of "no compulsion, but you must;" at least
that is our case at present.'</p>

<p>'I should like to know where that yacht is concealed. I know
enough about engines to be able to run her in case of
necessity.'</p>

<p>'He's not likely to let us know,' I returned.</p>

<p>Willis's voice hailed us, and we went down to the barge,
wherein the rowers were now taking their places.</p>

<p>'We too late to go round your schooner today,' he said; 'but
you might enjoy a trip up the river. There's a big village up one
of the arms that I want to pay a visit to. By the way, that
diving dress and pump are the very things I was going-to send
for. Now, it is no further use to you; I suppose you will sell it
to me?'</p>

<p>Again Moraine looked gravely at me, then answered, 'I shall be
happy to give it to you, Captain Willis, or sell it to you if you
prefer it. But may I ask what you wanted diving dress for?'</p>

<p>'Oh! laying the stones of water walls and the embankments of
our canals. Does your Malay dive?'</p>

<p>'Yes; he's a fairly-good diver.'</p>

<p>In about an hour's time we came to the village, far larger
than the one we had been living in. We found much to interest us
there during the afternoon, and the inhabitants seemed to stand
in great awe of our new acquaintance. On our return we dined with
him, and a good dinner he save us, and when we were smoking he
resumed the conversation about the people he belonged to.</p>

<p>'The race of people who occupied the tableland have an origin
which I cannot trace. They have no marked religion, unless It was
a kind of general spirit worship, neither exacting nor entailing
much ceremonial. That they were moral and decorous in their
behavior, and to all advanced state of more then
semi-civilisation, the record of the Dutch captain testifies.
They made cloth, went decently dressed, had good houses furnished
with mats, cooked their food properly, and, had even a kind of
hieroglyphic writing; but where they came from, and how they came
to be such a distinctive race, occupying one of the most
wonderful spots on earth, I cannot find out. There are ruins and
carvings, and I visited the old Cyclopic ruins on the Pelew and
Friendly Islands, and also on Easter Island to try and trace some
connection, but there is no resemblance between them whatever.
No; I am inclined to look to Asia for their birthplace, but I do
not connect them with the coming with the spread of Hindooism,
which overran Java and other islands.' He paused, and lay back
quietly smoking; while I puzzled more and more over this singular
man; and I am sure Moraine did the same.</p>

<p>Next morning after an early, breakfast, we were off betimes to
visit our poor schooner. Arrived there, we had to clamber along
the mangrove roots and branches to get aboard. We found the
Manilla man and the two kanakas rather weary of waiting, and
heartily glad to see us. Willis went all over the vessel with
Moraine, and gave it as his opinion that she would come off.</p>

<p>'You see,' he said, 'the mangrove roots form a perfect network
underneath her, and have prevented her sinking in the mud. Get
enough power on her, and with a high, tide she'll come off
flying.'</p>

<p>'That steam yacht of yours should be able to tow her off,'
said Moraine.</p>

<p>Willis darted a hasty glance at him, but only smiled and
answered, 'I think we can manage without. I'll tell you what I
propose. You will not want her for some time, so we'll strip her
canvas off and send it ashore. Her spars and topmasts can come
down and be floated round. Then we'll get the anchors out to
heave on to, and tail every nigger in the district on to the tow
ropes.'</p>

<p>'But, man alive, where are they to stand to get a
purchase?'</p>

<p>'Stand! You'll see when the time comes. Now, we'll send for
provisions and the <i>serang</i>, and what with my crew and your
men we'll soon have her stripped.'</p>

<p>Truly the work that was done during the next two days was
wonderful. The men worked with perfect order and precision, and
on the morning of the third day the pretty little schooner was a
plain hull, with only her two lower masts left in her. The tide
would be full about noon, and meantime, the natives gathered in
swarms, and were roosting about amongst the mangroves, like so
many clumps of flying foxes.</p>

<p>The way through the mangroves had been cut wider, and as the
critical hour approached the natives fell into orderly limes on
either side of it. They had made rude platform to stand on, but
how they clung on to them I could not imagine. Tow lines had been
passed on to the barge and two large canoes and one each was held
by the natives on either side of the water way. The <i>serang</i>
and our men were at the windlass to heave on the anchors.</p>

<p>Willis, Moraine, and myself were also on board, and at noon
Willis gave the agreed upon signal. A great shout arose, the oars
of the barge and the paddles of the canoes struck the water
together, the blacks on the flimsy platforms threw all their
weight into one mighty pull. We felt her creak under us, and them
there was a distinct move, a start, and away she want, too fast
for the men at the windlass to pick up the cable. The natives on
the platforms had to let go the rope as she swept on, the barge
end the two canoes being now enough for motive power, and before
we could recover from our surprise we were floating in deep
water. Willis turned to us with a sly look of triumph.</p>

<p>'It's done, and well done,' said Moraine, 'but I never thought
you could have get so many niggers to pull all together. That's
where I thought you'd break down.'</p>

<p>'I had my fear of it, I confess,' said Willis, graciously,
'but they shaped splendidly. Now we can leave them to bring her
up the river, and tomorrow we'll make a start for home.'</p>

<p>Again Moraine looked gravely at me, and certainly the word
'home' sounded strangely to our ears. Nest morning we took our
places in the barge, on which a good awning had been spread, and
behind us were our two boats in tow, containing the diving dress
and pump and other luggage. The <i>serang</i> steered one of
them. Willis had politely asked Moraine to lend the boats to him
the night before, and Moraine, with a solemn look on his face,
had offered to make him a present of them, which Willis would not
hear of.</p>

<p>As we progressed up the river the country became more open,
and when we landed for lunch we could see ranges ahead. The
country was, however, only clear just an the banks of the river;
beyond arose the dense forest and jungle peculiar to New
Guinea.</p>

<p>'To-morrow morning we shall have some falls to ascend,' said
Willis, as we took our seats in the barge.</p>

<p>'Many of them?' asked Moraine.</p>

<p>'About six during the next two days.'</p>

<p>'How do you manage?'</p>

<p>'Oh! we have lines fixed up now, and tow them up without much
trouble. There is a track cut round the falls that we can walk
up. In my grandfather's time it was an undertaking, but he
cleared most of the big rocks out of the way, and made towing
paths on either side, and we have done more to it, so it is
pretty plain sailing now.'</p>

<p>That night we camped in a pretty little nook, where there was
a large, empty native house, but the night was fine, and we
preferred steeping in the open air.</p>

<p>Next morning we came to the falls, which in their original
state must have been rather rough and broken, but now, owing to
the removal of the obstructions, they were smooth, but rapid. We
left the boat, and Willis led us by a well-made winding path to
the upper part of the falls, where we sat down, and awaited the
boats. They did not take so long as I imagined they would, and we
were soon on our way again. We now passed through a very barren
region, and when we stopped at noon, Willis took us to some
boiling springs that ware surrounded by tall trees of most
luxuriant growth, somewhat resembling our Australian tea trees.
The following evening we surmounted what Willis told us was the
last of the falls, and immediately in front of us was a black and
rugged range. Out of a narrow defile in this range the river
flowed, and that night we camped at the mouth of it.</p>

<p>Our way next morning lay through this gorge, and a grand
spectacle it was. On either hand rose a wall of rock over 500
feet high, and between these walls the river ran with a sluggish
current. There was no sign of vegetation, anywhere, nothing but
bare rock and water and a ribbon of blue sky overhead. Suddenly
without warning Willis gave a load shout. Backwards and forwards
it was handled between the echoing walls until I thought the
repetitions would never cease.</p>

<p>All the morning and the best part of the afternoon this gloomy
gorge beset us until we longed for a sight of open country. At
last the walls on either hand grew lower, and we shot out between
low banks, and at a sign from Willis the rowers stopped and we
paddled slowly into the bank.</p>

<p>'Come,' said Willis, and we followed him up the bank on to the
top of a small rise. It certainly was a glorious sight, not
vouchsafed to everybody to see once in a life time.</p>

<p>Before us outstretched swelling downs, dotted with clumps of
jungle. The green billows rolled on until they were lost in a dim
haze; but beyond, splendid in their naked white majesty, rose the
glittering crests of the Charles Louis Range, the tall peak we
had seen before towering above the others like a king of old over
meaner men. The monarchs of the present day may not suffice for a
comparison, being much given to ran to corpulence rather than
dignity.</p>

<p>The range, now that we were closer to it, presented an
appearance of great grandeur. The western, sun cast deep shadows
on it, making it look more serried and rugged than it really was.
Looking at the downs once more we could see the course of the
river flowing through it, but it was no longer one main stream
but was split up into tributaries, coming from all sides and
watering the beautiful country they passed through.</p>

<p>'My goodness! What a sheep station,' said Moraine, all his old
squatter instinct aroused. 'Water carriage right to the door. No
droughts with those mountains at the back of you.'</p>

<p>He heaved a deep sigh at the sight of such a pastoral paradise
being wasted in the centre of New Guinea.</p>

<p>'Wait till you see the range in the early morning when the sun
first catches that tall peak which my grandfather christened
Mount Orient,' said Willis.</p>

<p>'Where's your town?' asked Moraine, rather abruptly.</p>

<p>Willis laughed.</p>

<p>'You think you are gazing at a huge stretch of country
reaching from here to the foot of the range, but it is an optical
illusion my friends. Between us and that range is a broad valley,
but the rise that hides it is so gradual and blends so with the
country beyond, that you, think the surface is without a
break.'</p>

<p>'I have seen the same thing on the downs country in
Australia,' remarked Moraine.</p>

<p>'Do you see that branch of the river with some clumps of
timber close to the banks? That is the river that flows through
the valley, the tributary we shall ascend to-morrow.'</p>

<p>We turned to descend, the hill, and I was at once struck with,
the contrast presented by the range we had just passed through.
Bare, gaunt, and rugged it frowned upon the beautiful landscape
it looked down on as if hating it for its loveliness. There was
still an hour or two of daylight, and of this advantage was taken
to reach the junction of the tributary Willis had pointed out.
There we camped for the night.</p>

<p>Next morning Moraine and I hunted out from our belongings a
couple of clean white patrol suits so as to make a due impression
on the strange people we were about to meet, Willis telling us we
should reach there about noon. The tributary we now rowed along
bore evident marks of artificial improvement in its course,
canals having been cut across the necks of lands; and the banks,
in places, built up with rough hewn and squared stones. At last
we came to a well-constructed lock, and having passed through we
found ourselves in what was more like a serpentine canal than a
river, winding between gentle sloping banks, with here and there
cultivated fields running down to the water's edge, but what
houses there were we could not see on account of the banks being
too high. Noticing our curiosity Willis stopped the boat and we
landed.</p>

<p>When we reached the top of the bank we could see that we had
entered the valley Willis had spoken of. Open country extended
back from the river, bounded by tall forest trees, but the forest
was not the massive jungle of New Guinea, but more like an
English wood. Around were fields and plantations, and stone
cottages, each surrounded with a garden, were visible here and
there. Cattle and sheep were feeding in two of the paddocks,
which were fenced in with orthodox post and rail fences.</p>

<p>'How in the name of mischief did you import the cattle?' asked
Moraine.</p>

<p>'It was a bit of a job, but we did it by degrees. Some are
cattle the Dutch left behind when they abandoned their settlement
at Triton Bay. Now we have enough to go on unaided.'</p>

<p>We returned to the barge, and were soon passing through
country evidently more closely settled. Then on turning a corner
we came in sight of two tall obelisks, one on either side of the
river, and beyond lay the town&mdash;no town of palaces and
temples, such as the imagination draws as befitting a strange and
mysterious people, but a town of plainly built modern one-storey
houses, all with verandahs and balconies, and with small
luxuriant gardens in front of them. Broad streets, with avenues
of shady trees on each side, we caught sight of, and then we
passed between the obelisks.</p>

<p>Willis, or to give him his proper title in his own country,
Doria Papuan, turned to us and with a genial smile said, 'Welcome
to Ban Yammoo, the city which holds the world in its grasp.'</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p class="first">
IT was indeed a marvellous city of beauty we landed at.
Imagine a city all composed of prettily built residences, with
white walls showing out of green foliage, and balconies and
verandahs clothed with carefully trained creepers. We were met at
the landing-place by several of the principal citizens, men of
the same complexion and cast of features as Doria, who welcomed
us in well-spoken language to the City of Ban Yammoo. Then, we
sauntered through the beautiful town to the large town square,
where were situated a huge market-place.</p>

<p>This, we learned, was the main market place, there being
smaller branches in the outskirts of the city. There were no
shops disfiguring streets with their gaudy signs; no vulgar
advertisements flaunting on hoardings; no noisy traffic; only a
smooth-gliding and almost noiseless electric car, which, in cases
of necessity could be brought to all almost instantaneous
standstill. All supplies, I learned, were brought in too the
markets special cars in the early morning. There were houses
building, but one did not have to ram the gauntlet of bricks, and
stones, and planks and other annoyances that beset the
unfortunate pedestrian in Sydney and other benighted towns. All
building material was brought to in the early dawn, and the
houses, standing back from the pathway, obviated all nuisance to
the foot passengers. Ban Yammoo was surrounded by undulating
downs country, dotted with smiling farms and green plantations.
As a background rose the Charles Louis Mountains, with the
majestic Mount Orient.</p>

<p>'Where are your quarries and manufactures?' asked Moraine.</p>

<p>'A good way off,' answered Doria. 'We believe in keeping our
living city and our manufacturing city apart. It does not take
long to go out there, for our trams travel much faster in the
country than you see them doing here in the streets. Now I will
show you to your residence, where the <i>serang</i> and a servant
I will appoint will look after you.'</p>

<p>He led the way to a pretty, comfortable house, which, on
entering, we found quite modern in furniture and detail.</p>

<p>'I live next door,' said Doria, 'but will leave you to amuse
yourself during the afternoon, and hope you will have dinner with
us this evening.'</p>

<p>He shook hands with us and left us.</p>

<p>The <i>serang</i> came up smiling a broad smile.</p>

<p>'Ever see such a place as this before, sir?' he said.</p>

<p>'Never,' answered Moraine. 'How is it you have not heard of
it, Rastan?'</p>

<p>'Keep secret too well,' answered the Malay, with an unmoved
face, which convinced me that he had heard of it.</p>

<p>'Did you ever see such beautiful women?' said Moraine to
me.</p>

<p>'Never in such numbers,' I answered, and the female passers-by
in the street had struck us both by their exceptional good looks.
Clear, olive complexion, and large, expressive eyes characterised
them all, and the curves of the body and contour of the face
would have driven an artist desperate. The elder women were, in
their way, as handsome as the young, carrying their years with
dignity and graciousness. The men, too, were tall and well-built,
of much the same type throughout, enough to mark them as a
distinctive race, but a very handsome one. Their dress was
generally white, of modern cut, adapted to a warm climate. The
women wore some colors, and their dresses seemed like the men's,
an adaptation of modern fashions to the demands of the
climate.</p>

<p>Moraine and I went out for a stroll in the afternoon, and
found the streets more thronged than in the morning. But what
streets! No women with vulgar, ill-made dresses, and faces an
inch, thick with paint and powder; no street organs nor beggars;
no ragged urchins nor loafers; no 'buses, nor goggle-eyed craning
cyclists; and no policemen. Some curiosity was evident at our
presence, but it did not take the form of impertinent annoyance,
as would have been the case elsewhere. We returned, and found
that a supply of suits of clothes had been sent in for us to try
on and choose from. They were white, like all the men wore, but
of finer material, and cut in a slightly different manner.</p>

<p>We bathed and dressed, in what we presumed was equivalent to
evening dress, and awaited Doria. He was not long in coming, and
conducted us to his house; and, strange to say, did not ask us
what we thought of the city&mdash;the first question a Sydney or
Melbourne man would have put. At the dinner party, most of the
principal citizens had been invited to meet us&mdash;the two
judges, two or three military officers, and others who were noted
men in their different departments. Doria's wife, a singularly
beautiful and stately woman, as the wife of a Governor should be,
had, I noticed with surprise, a tinge of melancholy and sadness
in her manner. Not obtrusively so in any way, for she was the
perfection of a hostess, but still it seemed to me that she was
haunted with, a shadow of coming misfortune which she could not
shake off. She chatted cheerfully enough with me, and told me of
her travels about the world, which had been widely extended.</p>

<p>'What a beautiful city Sydney could be made,' she said</p>

<p>'And what a place it is,' I interposed</p>

<p>'I did not exactly mean that,' she said, smiling; 'but after
our streets the streets of Australian cities seem so
different&mdash;the eternal rattle of vehicles, the pushing and
crowding and lounging in the streets. The way the women stand in
groups on the pavement, and in doorways, and never attempt to
make way for you, all strike a citizen of Ban Yammoo very
disagreeably.'</p>

<p>'I entirely agree with you, and a little energy would banish a
number of our street nuisances our Australian cities; but energy,
well-directed energy, is what our authorities are deficient in.
They expend plenty of energy in getting themselves elected to
positions of authority and made members of Parliament, but once
there they think of nothing but getting what are called
perquisites of obtaining places for their relatives. Did you
happen to meet some of our respected legislators and Ministers
during your travels?'</p>

<p>'Yes, and do you know, they made me laugh when in private I
may be wrong, but they appeared to me so absurdly narrow-minded
and full of their own importance. And their appearance did not
carry out the dignity they claimed. But, its seems to me that
your religion is a great cause of your backwardness.'</p>

<p>'A good many of us think that,' I replied.</p>

<p>'Fancy people professing the same principles split up into
sects and factions, condemning and ignoring one another&mdash;the
priests quarrelling over the silly details of the fables they
teach. Why our Mohamedan Malays set you a good example.'</p>

<p>'Don't say you, I am not a professing Christian, as they call
it in the cant of their talk. But Captain Willis has evidently an
ardent disciple in you.'</p>

<p>Her face, which had been speaking and animated while she had
been talking, suddenly changed, and the sad look overshadowed it
once more.</p>

<p>'Don't use that name here,' she said in a low voice, 'He is
Doria Papwan in this city.'</p>

<p>I bowed, and to change the subject remarked, 'What a change
must be worked in feminine nature when you do without shops
here.'</p>

<p>'But we have shops, but no 'sellings-off' and 'wonderful
bargains'. We have learned to do without them. But are you and
Mr. Moraine early risers?'</p>

<p>'Yes; we are pretty used to rising at any hour.'</p>

<p>'Then I invite you to accompany me to the market to-morrow
morning. We transact all our shopping before breakfast. I will
send a servant to call you.'</p>

<p>I gladly consented, both for myself and Moraine, and the
dinner party soon adjourned to another room, whence, after a
little music, I was asked into smoking-room. Doria, Moraine, and
some half-a-dozen others were there, and I took a cigar and sat
down.</p>

<p>'Mr. Moraine was just remarking that if the Dutch were to find
as out they would not leave us long in peaceful occupation of
this table-land,' said Doria.</p>

<p>'As General Dulsett was about enlightening him as to the
impregnability of our position, I thought, doctor, that you might
like to hear it.</p>

<p>I replied that I was much interested, and General Dulsett, a
dignified-looking man, with a moustache as white as the snows of
Mount Orient, took up the tale.</p>

<p>'You came through the gorge when you entered our territory,'
said the General. 'I need scarcely explain to you that that
entrance could not be forced by all the armies of the world in
the face of an enemy; with a small army, it is true, but one
whose officers are acquainted with improvements in artillery that
the best armies of Europe know nothing of. I have lately visited
Russia, Germany, France, and England, and can assure you that an
army from either nation would be annihilated if they attacked us,
whilst we wouldn't lose a man. On the south we are safeguarded by
the Charles Louis Range, which you will also admit is capable of
defence by a very small number of men. There remains the range
which encircles us to the north and west, through which the gorge
runs. This range&mdash;of course we know every rock and
stone&mdash;can be scaled only by five passes, and each of these
passes can by our arrangement be simply turned into a death-trap
for any invading army. But first the army has to get that far. We
should take good care that they did not transport stores and
material by the river. You have doubtless heard often enough of
setting the Thames on fire; but to us the setting of the Amberno
on fire would be a very easy matter. I do not mean you to try and
believe that we know how to make water burn, but we are
acquainted with a chemical compound which practically would have
the same effect, so far as the destruction of transports is
concerned. Land carriage, which as you did not see much of the
surface of the country you passed through you could not
appreciate the difficulties of, would necessitate the building of
roads and railroads which we could destroy as fast as they were
built. I think we can justly consider ourselves impregnable. The
Dutch are the most likely nation to give us trouble, as they
claim this territory, though as they have never done anything to
establish their claim, and our ancestors settled here long before
the claim was enforced, no international court would uphold them.
I should like to see them attempt to come in force. They would
get a lesson they richly deserve. If our existence became known,
Great Britain and America, and all British colonies, would
assuredly recognise our nationality. France and Russia would he
indifferent, and Germany is the only country likely to interfere;
and we'd serve them like we would the Dutch.'</p>

<p>'How about the coming air ships?' asked Moraine.</p>

<p>'We are up to date in the latest known inventions, and will
probably have air ships as soon, as, if not before, the rest of
the world.'</p>

<p>'If you make up your minds to stop here,' said Doria, 'you
will learn some more that will confirm what I said when you
landed, that we have, in absolute truth, got the world in our
grasp.'</p>

<p>'But you don't seem to want it,' I remarked.</p>

<p>'I have not asked you what you thought of Ban Yammoo,'
returned Doria, with a pleasant smile. 'When Captain Willis was
doing Australia in his steam yacht, he was absolutely sickened by
that question in every seaport he visited; he nearly keel-hauled
one fellow who called himself an interviewer. Now, however, I
will answer your question by asking you if there is any
comparison between this city and the sordid centres of the
outside world, with their misery, vice, and starvation, their
dirt and disease? Why should we want the outer world? And I say
to you,' and he stood erect and his voice was intensely
thrilling, 'it will be a signal of the world's social destruction
when we fail in the task our forefathers set us, or if our
descendants do. The day that witnessed this tableland and its
secret thrown open to the world's inrush would be the knell of
all order, stability of government, and the social laws that bind
people together.'</p>

<p>Moraine and I were silent at this unexpected outburst, and the
others listened gravely and approvingly. Then we broke up, for
the citizens of Ban Lammoo are an early people.</p>

<p>'What the devil does he mean?' I said as we turned into our
house.</p>

<p>'I cannot make out,' returned Moraine, 'unless he has "auld
Hornie" chained up in the mountains, and intends to let him loose
to have a good time of it.'</p>

<p>It was before sunrise when we stepped outside at the summons
of the messenger. Mme. Doria was ready, attended by two men with
baskets. She greeted us kindly, and said, 'Stay here for one
moment,' and then directed our attention to the towering form of
Mount Orient.</p>

<p>On its virgin peak a spark of golden fire suddenly kindled,
crept down a short way, and then merged into a rosy-tinted blush.
As we looked the golden fire increased on the red more and more;
other peaks caught it, until the great white range seemed ablaze
with beacon fires. Then quickly they paled and died, and once
more, cold and white, they reared their crests to the blue
sky.</p>

<p>'That mountain was well named,' said Moraine. Mme. Doria
smiled assent, and we started to the market. Everything was
wonderful in this wonderful city, and the market was no
exception. No dirty row of stalls, with a smell of decayed fruit
and stale vegetables hanging about. But, ranged beneath a lofty
dome of glass, were rows of shops, each row devoted to one
particular class of wares. Between these rows ran a broad
tessellated pavement, along which the customers walked to the
places they wished to visit. There was no display worth speaking
of in any of the windows, so that there was no loitering. Those
who served were nearly all young men, though for special articles
there were young women in attendance.</p>

<p>It seemed so strange to me to have to carry money about with
me, and pay for everything I got, when I first went abroad,' said
Mme. Doria, smilingly.</p>

<p>'Have you nothing but a credit system here?' I asked.</p>

<p>'Neither money nor credit. We don't want it. We are a commune
in the strictest sense of the word; but we are a commune with a
head to it, and a head that is not tossed up by the breath of the
mob.'</p>

<p>'You have no mob seemingly,' said Moraine.</p>

<p>'No, we have neither poverty nor discontent to breed one. But
Doria will tell you all about the political structure of our
community better than I can. Only I have seen the world, and I am
frightened of it. You would scarcely believe that I went slumming
in London?'</p>

<p>'No wonder you fear the contamination of the world then,'
answered Moraine.</p>

<p>'I do,' she said softly; and the sadness that was often in her
eyes now spoke in her voice, as she added in a lower voice, 'I
wish that Captain Willis would cease to exist.'</p>

<p>Was this the cause then of the shadow on her face? Did she
fear that ambition and the love of power so evident in the
masterful nature of her husband would get the upper hand of him,
and bring him into grips with the world? It was probable enough;
Doria was a man who, as statesman and ruler, could have held his
own anywhere, and he must have known it. I could guess that it
must have often chafed his proud spirit to think that this
wonderful community, where trouble and crime were unknown, should
go on its way unknown, unrecognised, uninitiated.</p>

<p>Mme. Doria's purchases were soon completed, and we left the
market, and turned our steps homeward. Halfway there we met Doria
coming to meet us, with him his two eldest children, whom we had
not seen the night before, a handsome boy and girl, 10 and 9
years old respectively.</p>

<p>'I've got a busy day for you to-day,' he said, after the
morning salutations had been exchanged. 'What do you think of
this climate for the medical profession?' he continued.</p>

<p>'I am afraid you would have to build benevolent asylums for
them,' I answered, 'if they came here in any numbers.'</p>

<p>Moraine was looking hard at this wonderful man, evidently
contrasting his strange enthusiasm of the night before with the
sunny, careless side of his character he was showing us now.</p>

<p>'I wonder,' he said, laughingly, 'what the orthodox priest or
parson would say if he strayed here, and found a people amongst
whom crime was almost unknown, and who yet never kept Sunday, had
no churches, and no religion worth speaking of. I suppose they
would start missions to convert us. I think I'll catch a
missionary some day, and bring him up here.'</p>

<p>We laughed, and Moraine changed the subject by asking bow our
busy day was to be employed.</p>

<p>'We will go and see our manufacturing town,' he said. We
strolled homeward, chatting on different topics; and parted at
the gate of our new abode. A capital breakfast was awaiting us,
and as our walk and the buoyant morning air had given us princely
appetites, we thoroughly enjoyed it. We had scarcely finished
before Doria came in.</p>

<p>'Come,' he said, as he offered us cigars; 'we have a long day
before us.'</p>

<p>We soon found ourselves seated in the smoking compartment of
one of the electrical cars which ran as easily and smoothly as a
sleigh. Once outside the city streets the pace increased to that
of an express train, and we rapidly neared an outlying spur of
the mountain range, behind which, Doria told us, lay the city of
manufactures.</p>

<p>Round this spur we came in sight of the city, and both of us
uttered an exclamation of surprise. No tall chimneys pierced the
air, no pall of smoke hung overhead, blotting out the blue sky.
The buildings, plain but not ugly, stood out as clear and dean as
those of the city we had just left.</p>

<p>'Doesn't look much like a big manufacturing town, does it?'
said Doria.</p>

<p>'No,' we both replied.</p>

<p>'See that white streak on the range below the snow-line?' he
asked, pointing ahead.</p>

<p>We looked, and saw a perpendicular band of white on the face
of the range.</p>

<p>'That's a waterfall, and our source of motive power.'</p>

<p>So that accounted for the absence of smoking chimneys! The
tram now slackened speed, and in a minute we glided into a
station, where two of the guests of the night before were waiting
to receive us, and after conversing for a few minutes we
proceeded to the nearest tall building.</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p class="first">
TO recount all we saw on that day would be wearisome to the
reader. As Doria predicted, it was a busy day, and the end of it
found us Only too glad to get into the tram and speed homeward to
Ban Lammoo. We saw too much that day. Too much to grasp at once,
and, consequently, we were brain-tired trying to comprehend it.
The absolute order and method throughout all the works was
marvellous. And the fine, independent, well-mannered air of the
workmen was a treat to see. As Mme. Doria had said, it was the
spirit of community in its truest sense that dominated this
marvellous settlement.</p>

<p>'I wonder,' I said to Doria, 'that you require either laws or
judges here. Every man seems to have the welfare of the community
at heart, and seeks to further it.'</p>

<p>'We cannot change human nature, my dear doctor, as you of all
men should know. Men will ever differ in their notions, and
trouble would ensue, only that we have a court of arbitration and
reference, which all respect. I said we had do crime, and we have
none. But we have, like every human assembly, the germs of
trouble in us; but we check it before it grows. In civilised
countries they wait till the criminal has committed his crime
before their laws deal with him. Here we anticipate it in the
bud. It sounds something like <i>Alice in Wonderland</i>, where
the white Queen cries because she is going to cut her finger;
but, nevertheless, that is the principle of our law. Again, we
have another advantage. What do you call the chief incentives to
crime?'</p>

<p>'The lust of money, the lust of power, and the love between
the sexes,' I replied.</p>

<p>'The first we don't possess. No one wants money here&mdash;it
is useless; it is not a motive for crime. With us, in its
original shape, we have more than enough&mdash;it is dross. As
yet the lust of power has not troubled us, the man has not
arisen. He may at any moment. I admit that is an ever-present
shadow. As for the love of men and women, that is decided by the
women themselves. Where rivalry exists, the girl is the arbiter
of her own fate, and chooses for herself. You would have fewer
divorce cases if you did the same.'</p>

<p>'I am not so sure of that; hasty marriages by young people
come into the divorce court often enough. But, talking of
incentives to crime, latent insanity is often the cause with
us.'</p>

<p>'That we are free from. I ascribe it to the utter absence of
worry. The average man has here no cares.'</p>

<p>'The average man,' I repeated; 'but you do not wish me to
believe that all here are but average men?'</p>

<p>'No&mdash;some of us are troubled with cares; but they are not
of the nagging, worrying order that when they get hold of a man
never cease to haunt.'</p>

<p>'You're free from the domestic scold, then?' I said. But he
only laughed.</p>

<p>We were in the factory devoted to electricity when this
conversation was held, and as we turned I caught sight of the
face of the chief electrician watching us. He was one of the men
who had met us at the station, one of the guests at the dinner
party, and the way in which he suddenly averted his gaze reminded
me that during that dinner party I had once or twice caught him
watching Mme. Doria and myself when we were conversing.</p>

<p>He was a man with a fine, intelligent face; with a dominant
look in it like that of Doria's; but there the resemblance
ceased. Doria's face gave you the impression of a man of great
resolution, who would not hesitate at the means, when there was a
great end in view, and that end a good one. La Manca, the
electrician, impressed you as a man who could be just as resolute
in pursuing a chosen path to the end; but the end would be solely
for his own good.</p>

<p>I have always been a keen reader of faces, and during my short
career as a physician had often exercised the faculty. Perhaps
this habit influenced me now in ray conjectures; but the thought
that flashed through my head was the question: Was this the man
who might arise and disturb the peace of centuries that had
reigned on this wonderful tableland? I thought that it might be.
He had vast power in his hands. Evidently electricity was the
great motive power used by these people in their engineering
works and defences, and here was the man who held the power in
his hands. One act of treachery on his part could throw the whole
working gear out of order. I made a mental resolve to cultivate
his acquaintance, and, above all, I would get Mme. Doria's
opinion of the man. Somehow this woman had imbued me with a
strong feeling of respect for her judgment. The wonderful
instinct of her sex with regard to those she loved enabled her
to see clearly the dangers threatening the future of their
community.</p>

<p>She saw, which her husband did not, that contact with the
outer world would sooner render it impossible for him to continue
in their present safe obscurity, and dreaded the future. Mme.
Doria was a type of what the new woman dimly and ignorantly
imagines that she strives to be. But, dressing in mannish dress,
and writing risky, problem novels which would make Fielding and
Smollett blush, never produced, nor ever will produce, the
incarnation of womanhood represented by Mme. Doria.</p>

<p>Before leaving the manufacturing city, we went out to the
artillery ground to witness some examples of the latest
developments in arms and ammunition. The force and annihilating
power of the explosive used was something terrible.</p>

<p>'You would think nothing could stand against it, would you?'
said Doria, smiling.</p>

<p>'Nothing that I ever heard of,' replied Moraine.</p>

<p>'Our chief artificer has, however, made and armour-plate that
even our guns cannot pierce. It will never be used, partly on
account of its great weight, but, above all, its immense cost. We
are able to dint it, but nothing more.'</p>

<p>Along a set of rails a target was now run, and placed, in
position against the side of a huge mass of rock jutting out from
the quarries. The gun was fired, and apparently made no
impression whatever. It struck the target right enough, for if it
had hit the rock we should have seen the impact. At Doria's
invitation we went over to the armored target to examine it. The
mark of the projectile was visible, but no harm had been
done.</p>

<p>Moraine examined it closely, and asked if he might be told
what metals it was made of.</p>

<p>'Certainly,' answered Doria. 'It is, as you may guess, a
mixture of the toughest metals known. But the one which makes it
so impossible for practical use is gold. How much gold Is there
in that plate?' he asked the chief artificer.</p>

<p>'About £5000 worth,' was the reply.</p>

<p>'You, will see now the impossibility of its being employed in
common use for the navies of the world. Fancy the cost of a.
battleship plated with armor such as that. It might pay such a
power as England to make one impregnable destroyer, to launch
amongst the fleets of her enemies, but there is the question of
weight to be worked out yet.'</p>

<p>'I think it will be solved by the new backing I am now
experimenting with,' said the artificer.</p>

<p>Doria pointed to the top of the rocky spur against which the
target had been placed. It ended abruptly in a sheer cliff.</p>

<p>'That is where we conduct our aerial experiments,' he said.
'We are getting on pretty well with them, too; I think we shall
fly as soon as the rest of the world.'</p>

<p>We turned away, and walked back to the station, and entered
the tram. Both Moraine and I were silent, thinking of the many
wonders we had seen that day, and Doria was, I thought, watching
us, to note for the effect created. We parted at out abode.</p>

<p>'I will, with your permission, pay you a visit this evening,'
he said; 'I have something of importance to say to you.'</p>

<p>'Well, Moraine,' I said when we were alone, 'what does it all
mean?'</p>

<p>'Mean, old man&mdash;that we have got to spend the rest of
our lives here. It might be worse. We are both men without family
ties, and the life is pleasant.'</p>

<p>'You think that is the important information he is going to
convey to us this evening?'</p>

<p>'I do, and doubtless he showed us his power to-day to clinch
things. The well-bred dog leaves the room when he sees
preparations being made for kicking him out. So, having impressed
us with the utter impossibility of escape, he presumes we shall
cheerfully consent to stay.'</p>

<p>We talked the matter over still further, but only came to the
inevitable conclusion that what must be, must. Many people would
think that it was by no means a hard fate that lay before us, nor
was it. But, the sensation of being detained, of being no longer
a free man, persists in being ever present amid the most
pleasurable surroundings. An unbreakable chain of flowers may
grow just as galling as one of rusty iron.</p>

<p>Doria came soon after we had finished dinner, and I at once
saw by his manner that Moraine's guess was likely to be
correct.</p>

<p>'As you are men of the world,' he commenced, 'it is best to
speak plainly and openly. I said that we are not in want of fresh
additions to our population from outside, for I am now extremely
anxious to promote a feeling of intense patriotism amongst my
people, which may stand them in good stead in the future. Fresh
blood from the outer world would retard this feeling. But it does
not follow but what the advent of occasional emigrants, men with
knowledge and experience, will not be of great advantage to
us.'</p>

<p>Moraine held up his hand with a queer smile. Doria ceased
speaking and looked at him.</p>

<p>'My dear sir, why not put it into plain words at once. We are
here and must stop.'</p>

<p>'That is the truth of it,' said Doria, springing up as though
much relieved. 'You can see yourselves that your going away is
impossible. I might take your words to keep a strict silence, but
some unguarded phrase, some unheeded expression may, against your
will, betray us, and though I have proved to you our security
against force, I have no wish to make a slaughterhouse of our
defences; nor to see thousands of doomed men rush on to
inevitable death. In short, it is as you say, Moraine, you must
stop here. Don't reply to me yet until we return from an
expedition on which I am going to take you. I will not insult you
by supposing that you are too tired to go with me after our day's
outing. Are you ready?'</p>

<p>We both signified our readiness and followed him out. A car
was in waiting, and, taking cur seats, we sped rapidly out of the
city. We turned off on a branch line, and were whirled along at a
great pace for quite an hour. The air grew somewhat cool, and
Doria reached down warm overcoats from a rack, and we put them
on.</p>

<p>At last we stopped at an unlighted and deserted platform, and
got out. Right in front of us rose the base of the range; we were
too close to see the summits, but the breeze bore the breath of
the snow in its crisp coldness.</p>

<p>'We'll be warm enough directly,' said Doria, as he led the way
onward. After half an hour's walk through the somewhat keen night
air, we saw a light in the distance, and on our arrival at it,
found it illuminated the portico of a building constructed of
heavy stone.</p>

<p>Entering, we were greeted by a tall, old man, who seemed to be
expecting us. Without much parleying the old man ushered us into
a room, wherein were spread rough overalls which Doria said we
were to put on, himself setting the example; then, each took a
lantern, which, by a system of reflectors, gave forth a very
brilliant light.</p>

<p>Following the old man, we proceeded along a passage for some
distance, then I noticed a change in the face of the wall, and we
were evidently pursuing the course of a tunnel, piercing the base
of the range. Channels had been cut for drainage, but drops from
the roof dripped steadily on us, and we found the advantage of
our overalls. At times we passed air-shafts, and the atmosphere,
though warm, was comparatively pure. At last we halted in an open
space, in which there was a large closed door.</p>

<p>'Before we enter,' said Doria, 'I must prepare you for what
you are about to see. No doubt you have wondered at my occasional
allusions to our power and wealth, and that if our country was
overran it would end in world-wide turmoil. To-night you will
agree with ma That gold can exist in quantities that can scarcely
be conceived, you will admit. A ten-ton nugget, if I may use the
term, is as possible as a ten-ounce one. Here we have gold in
such enormous quantities that we cannot estimate it. The
revelation of its existence would at once destroy its standard
value in the world. This would mean nothing else than the direst
universal ruin that the utmost efforts could not avert.
Individuals and nations alike would go headlong to destruction in
the revolution that would inevitably follow the blotting out of
our present test and value of all property.</p>

<p>'If the change could be worked slowly and gradually, it might
be effected, but the sudden knowledge that
gold&mdash;inexhaustible gold!&mdash;existed would set men crazy.
They would slaughter each other to obtain it, and when they got
it, it would be of no more value than the sand of the sea shore.
You can see this result?'</p>

<p>We both replied that it was inevitable.</p>

<p>'We are the keepers of this awful secret. To us gold itself is
nothing, only the means of purchasing what we require from the
outside world. It is only the travelled few amongst us that
realise the danger of this gold mine becoming known. Now you
understand that with illimitable wealth at our command we have
been able to do so much. It was first found about 150 years ago.
Before that, however, it had been obtained in small quantities,
as is usual in other auriferous countries. The passage we first
followed is the bed of a river, an intermittent flowing river, as
it was fed by melted snow descending through vast crevices in the
range. During one of its dry periods it was followed up by an
adventurous member of the community, and the gold discovered. The
Governor at that period was equal to the occasion. He verified,
to the best of his power, the incalculable nature of the
treasure. He was a wise and far-sighted man. It became through
life means one of the fundamental principles of our social being
that we are the guardians and warders of this gold, destined for
this by the great, unknown controlling power whose attributes we
cannot conceive. Other men would have laden themselves with gold,
and sailed away, and died in luxurious dissipation. Others would
have gone with their knowledge to grasp the power and pomp of the
world. Governor Kurtzon did neither. He did as I said, taught his
people of the valueless character of the metal to them
individually, and inspired them, with the belief that has since
been unshaken. We are the warders of the world, our perpetual
silence saves it from, ruin. In years the course of the river has
been diverted, the passage widened, and when we want gold it is
easily obtained, reduced to ingots, and disposed of by the many
channels of communication, we now possess with the markets of the
world. There has been one honor to the dead conferred, amongst
us. It is a statue of the wise Governor Kurtzon. You will see it
when this door is opened. Risdant here, our guide, is a
descendant of the man who first found the gold. He and his
fathers have always lived here, keepers of another secret which
involves far-spread destruction in the event of things being so
ruled that our land is invaded by the spoiler. I will tell you
what it Is when you have seen, what that door hides.'</p>

<p>At a signal from Doria the old man advanced and threw open the
door, at the same time touching a button which flooded the scene
with electric light. We entered. The cavity was lofty and
circular in shape. In the centre stood the statue. Of heroic
size, hewn out of white marble, the grand old Governor stood en a
pedestal of gold, facing the entrance. He was dressed in a bygone
fashion, and wore a moustache and peaked beard. One hand was
uplifted and one foot advanced, as if warning or menacing the
intruder. The features wore an indescribable air of dignity and
stem determination.</p>

<p>'That's an inspired work,' I could not help saying, so much
did it entrance my attention.</p>

<p>'It is,' returned Doria, 'and the youth who did it was an
inspired sculptor. But he was not to live. On the day he gave the
last touch to that statue he died. He was found dead at the foot
of it.'</p>

<p>We looked around, and saw gold everywhere, in such profusion
that we ceased to wonder at it. It seamed the wall in veins, it
was there in patches, discoloring the white surface. Tunnels were
cut leading in different directions, but the monotony of the
thing tired us, and we did not enter them. Doria stooped and
picked up a piece of broken core, composed of alternate layers of
gold and stone.</p>

<p>'We have bored a thousand feet horizontally into the southern
wall, in six places, and it is all like this. This range, the
highest between the Andes and the Himalayas, is formed of gold
and golden stone. Did I say too much?'</p>

<p>We could find no words to answer. The sight of what we saw,
and the dire consequences that were contained in that lofty
cavern, left us speechless, and we gladly went out. Old Risdant
shut the door, turned out the electric light, and Governor
Kurtzon resumed his endless, lonely watch, in the depth of the
range. It haunted me, that picture of the grim old man standing
there through sunless centuries keeping faithful watch over the
awful charge entrusted to his keeping.</p>

<p>Almost in unbroken silence we retraced our steps, and on
arrival at the house Doria led us into a room where refreshments
were awaiting us.</p>

<p>'Is this real, legitimate whisky, and not a decoction of fluid
gold,' said Moraine, taking up a decanter.</p>

<p>'It is,' answered Doria, smiling, 'I brought it from Scotland
myself.' Moraine poured out about four fingers and a thumb, and,
adding same water, drank it off.</p>

<p>'I wanted that badly,' he said, apologetically. 'You have too
many wonders in this country, Doria. The ordinary white man
cannot take it all in without stimulants. Now, if you have any
more side-shows, bring them out, and let us get it all over.'</p>

<p>Doria laughed, but, truth to tell, I felt much the same as
Moraine, as though my mind was utterly confused.</p>

<p>After a short pause Doria spoke.</p>

<p>'I said that the keeper here held another secret, and it is an
hereditary one. The governor who succeeded Kurtzon had the place
mined and the mines charged with powder, so that in case of
necessity the entrance could be concealed by the explosion. The
family of Risdant are bound over to this duty. Since we have
mastered the secrets of electricity and explosives the system of
mines has been extended and amplified. An explosion, now would
shatter a tremendous area, and what the consequences might be I
cannot say. Avalanches of snow would probably be brought down,
and overwhelm our valley with destruction. Risdant and his son
hold the secret by which this catastrophe can be brought about,
and if ever the time came that our defences failed us before an
invader, he and his would unhesitatingly do their duty, and bury
friend and foe. But I do not fear that eventuality. No human
power can guard against treachery, and, sometimes in my dark
hours, I am o'ershadowed with a dread and terror of that being
our fate!'</p>

<p>He ceased, and it seemed to me that a dark hour had come over
him then. Rousing himself, he said in a different tone: 'Well,
gentlemen, you see the state of the situation. Will you sit down,
in safety and peace, as one of us, or remain unwilling
prisoners?'</p>

<p>Moraine and I exchanged glances.</p>

<p>'Are we to understand,' I asked, 'that we are never to quit
this place if we become naturalised?'</p>

<p>'Not for years, certainly. If you settle down here, and give
hostages to Fortune it might be a different matter.'</p>

<p>'I see; but I must ask another question. In the event of some
such fate overtaking your community, as you seem to indicate by
your gloomy forebodings, would we be expected to fight against
our countrymen?'</p>

<p>'No, but as an alternative we should, for our own safety, keep
you in close, but honorable, captivity. The same objections would
not, I presume, militate against your assisting us with your best
endeavors against a foreign enemy?'</p>

<p>'Certainly not&mdash;be with you through thick and this,' said
Moraine.</p>

<p>There was silence for a time. I was thinking deeply. At last I
asked to speak with Moraine alone, and Doria assented, and left
the room. Our consultation was not long. In five minutes I went
out and asked Doria to come back.</p>

<p>'We are willing,' I said, 'to settle down here and become
citizens of our city, and obey all your laws, and give all the
assistance in our power to further the good of the community and
assist to repel foreign enemies, if the agreement ceases in the
event of your death.'</p>

<p>'That is a peculiar stipulation, and I don't quite know
whether I can agree to it or not, without consultation with the
others. What do you intend in the event of my death, though! I do
not see why I should not outlive you. I hope, doctor, you are not
gifted with second sight.'</p>

<p>'In the event of your death, which we trust may be long
averted,' said Moraine, 'we should, I presume, have no choice but
to go into imprisonment. But we should have our parole returned,
and could honorably seize any opportunity to escape.'</p>

<p>'By that time you would know all our ins and outs, would you
not?' asked Doria, laughing. 'That's our proposition,' I
said.</p>

<p>'I cannot give you an answer before consulting my principal
men. Till then, forget everything but that you are my
guests.'</p>

<p>We bade adieu to Risdant, and started to walk back to where
the tram was awaiting us.</p>

<p>'Why was the tram not brought right up to the place,' asked
Moraine.</p>

<p>'Too dangerous,' said Doria. 'Mines are delicate things to
play with, and we did not think it wise to incur risk by
vibration.'</p>

<p>We did not feel much inclined to sleep when we reached home,
after saying good-night to Doria; but it was some satisfaction to
see our way straight before us in black and white.</p>

<p>'Do you think he will accept our terms?' I asked, as we parted
for the night.</p>

<p>'Personally, I think he is willing, but I suppose it will go
by the vote of the majority,' returned Moraine, as we parted.</p>

<p>At 12 o'clock the next day, Doria came to us in company with
some of the leading men.</p>

<p>'Gentlemen,' he said, after they were welcomed, 'I am pleased
to tell you that your terms are accepted, and on behalf of all of
us here I heartily bid you welcome as citizens of Ban
Yammoo.'</p>

<p>'There is a little formality to be gone through in signing
this paper,' said one of the judges, advancing and spreading two
documents on the table, the contents of which were specifically
what we had proposed last night. Our signatures were soon
written, and we became affiliated citizens.</p>

<p>'There was one very strong opponent to your terms being
sanctioned,' said Doria, afterwards, to me. 'But only one.'</p>

<p>'I can guess who that was,' I replied.</p>

<p>'Who?' he asked.</p>

<p>'La Manca, the electrician,' I answered.</p>

<p>'How on earth did you guess?' he asked, in surprise.</p>

<p>But that question I could not answer, it had been only an
inspiration.</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p class="first">
SIX years passed over our heads in the peaceful remoteness of
Ban Yammoo. Neither Moraine nor myself had given hostages to
fortune, for both of us cherished the idea of finally getting
back to the world we had been used to. Such is the contradiction
of human nature that, although we had every desire gratified, and
every wish fulfilled, we yet longed to re-enter the world of
sorrow and strife.</p>

<p>I had resumed my medical studies, and Moraine had devoted
himself to the cattle and sheep-breeding farms. Rastan, our
former <i>serang</i>, had settled down, and was employed in
various avocations. Our friendship with Doria still continued
unshaken, and the horizon appeared calm and cloudless.</p>

<p>I had never definitely spoken to Madame Doria of the feeling
of mistrust I entertained towards La Manca, for I feared to
increase the burden of doubt she so evidently bore. But I had
gently approached the matter, and plainly saw that she did not
entertain very friendly feelings towards the chief electrician.
It was towards the conclusion of the six years of our residence
that, through the many channels of communication which Doria
maintained, we first heard of the great war that inaugurated the
opening of the 20th century, and resulted in dire slaughter and a
readjustment of many of the outlying boundaries of the world's
many countries.</p>

<p>During the whole of this time Doria had been in a state of
repressed excitement, and evidently mastered with the idea of
what would result should he appear on the scene of warfare backed
up with the unlimited treasure of the Charles Louis Mountains.
Madams Doria's face wore a constant shadow of fear, as if
dreading that Doria would give way to the thoughts that dominated
him.</p>

<p>At last, when half the battleships of the world were at the
bottom of the sea, and the armies decimated, peace was restored,
and the world set about repairing damages under certain altered
conditions. During the time the conflict had lasted I felt
certain that La Manca had urged Doria to take part in the
struggle. But the sacredness of the tradition that he guarded was
too strongly implanted in Doria's character, and the end of war
saw the secret of Ban Yammoo still carefully concealed from the
outside world.</p>

<p>At last the natives brought up news that a large expedition
had landed at the mouth of the Amberno, and was about to trace it
to its source. The great struggle had not interfered with the
titular ownership of Western New Guinea; the Dutch still claimed
it, and the present expedition was a Dutch one.</p>

<p>The world was full of restless spirits of all nations,
disorganised by a bloody and almost universal war. Doria was
unmoved by the news.</p>

<p>'We have been prepared for this for a long time,' he said. 'It
is easy work. The natives will do most of it.'</p>

<p>And so it proved. Misled and guided astray, up the many arms
and channels of the river, the expedition at last came to the
conclusion that the Amberno was only a mass of intricate
branches, a maze of tortuous channels. But their leader thought
that with properly constructed boats success might follow, and a
main channel be at last found.</p>

<p>Six months afterwards two gunboats appeared somewhere near the
spot where we had suffered wreck, and a large party was landed
and boats launched. On receipt of this news Doria appeared
uneasy. I was not surprised at it. He could annihilate the whole
party with ease, but the slaughter of a peaceful, scientific
party, unsuspecting any encounter with civilised foes, would be
cold-blooded murder. It seemed very improbable that they could be
again hoodwinked in any way, as they were evidently a
well-equipped and resolute party, determined to reach the
ranges.</p>

<p>Things had come to a crisis. As the intruders were Dutch,
Moraine and I were invited to assist at the deliberations that
ensued. They were long and anxious. Whether the decision arrived
at was the wisest I cannot say. Certainly there seemed no choice
at the time. Ana also, it was the inevitable that stared us in
the face. The world was now too old for there to be any waste
places in it left unvisited. The war had for long stopped all
geographical research, but now that the world was recovering from
it and peace reigned once more, travelling would commence
again.</p>

<p>Coming from the council one evening after all had been
settled, I encountered Madame Doria. Knowing that she was in her
husband's confidence throughout, I was not surprised when she at
once entered into conversation with me en the subject then
troubling us.</p>

<p>'It is decided then to send a party to meet and interview the
leaders of this Dutch expedition, and point out to them that they
will not be allowed to enter the country?' she asked.</p>

<p>'Yes, it has been decided to do that, as the only means of
avoiding bloodshed.'</p>

<p>'Do you think it will be successful.'</p>

<p>'Successful in turning them back for this time but they will
come again.'</p>

<p>'Who will go?'</p>

<p>'General Dulsett, La Manca, and probably either Moraine or
myself.'</p>

<p>'Doria will not go?'</p>

<p>'We advised him not. For one thing it would not be safe for
him to become personally known to the Dutch. Moraine or I will
carry on the negotiations, and, if possible, give them the notion
that this settlement is English.'</p>

<p>'I wish La Manca were not going. I am nervous and silly, but I
have been troubled by bad dreams lately, and that man's face has
been ever present in them.'</p>

<p>'I would not trust La Manca. He stood out against our
conditions of residence being accepted, and now advocates the
admission of these intruders.'</p>

<p>'Is that the tone he takes?'</p>

<p>'It is. He says, with some show of truth, it is impossible to
keep the knowledge of our existence any longer hidden, and it is
better to keep the world at arm's length than run the risk of
being surprised, and the secret of the gold discovered.'</p>

<p>'Do you agree with him?'</p>

<p>'Partly, and partly not. I think a bold policy would be the
best&mdash;declaring an independent nationality, and claiming the
recognition of our independence from the principal Powers. In
that case we should be able to enforce our own laws, and only
admit strangers under a passport system. The secret of the gold
could be preserved, even as Russia has kept her Siberian gold
fields intact. La Manca's idea of alliance with the Dutch, and
acknowledging their suzerainty by a yearly tribute, is a
temporising, half-way policy, bound to end in trouble.'</p>

<p>'It means more,' she returned, 'Doctor, a crisis is
approaching, and I will tell you what is preying on my mind. La
Manca aspires to the Governorship; if he carries his point, and
makes an alliance with the Dutch, he will so influence them that
he will gain this point, and Doria will be deposed, or civil war
will ensue. And next to Doria, he is possessed of much power, and
all our secrets. Treachery on his part means ruin.'</p>

<p>'I fully agree with you,' I replied, 'and if Doria saw with
our eyes it might be different; but he thoroughly trusts the man,
and would hear of nothing against him.'</p>

<p>'He does,' she said, sadly. 'La Manca plays his part well, but
with you and Moraine and I watching him we may yet baffle
him.'</p>

<p>'Could you not go as well as Mr. Moraine?'</p>

<p>'I see no difficulty. I have, I think, only to volunteer.'</p>

<p>'Go, then. I trust in you.'</p>

<p></p>

<p>Time went on, and the natives kept our outposts well informed
of the movements of the expedition. They at last found the main
channel of the river, and it was time for us to start. My
services had been thankfully accepted, La Manca alone objecting.
We had a well-armed escort, and awaited the party at the foot of
the first cascade. We had only one day's waiting; then two
shallow draught steam launches came in sight, evidently fully
manned.</p>

<p>Our encampment was in full sight, with a flag
flying&mdash;white, with a single red star in the centre.
Evidently they took us for another exploring party from the east
or south, and were proportionately astonished when informed that
the country was claimed and settled, and that they would not be
allowed to proceed further. At the same time, full geographical
details of the upper courses of the river and the heights of and
trend of the ranges would be supplied them.</p>

<p>The principal members of the party consisted of a young Dutch
military officer, a German officer, two Dutch and one English
scientist, so that when we met our parleying was easy. Naturally
they pooh-poohed the thing, the Dutch officer being especially
arrogant in his manner. The others, however, saw the matter from
a serious point of view, and argued very reasonably that if we
were a civilised people the coming of a purely scientific and
peaceful party could not be objected to.</p>

<p>To all this General Dulsett replied that it was our law and
according to our constitution, and, while regretting the want of
courtesy it seemingly evinced, it was not to be relaxed. The
expedition must not attempt to proceed further, or they would be
made prisoners. This roused the ire of the Dutch officer, who
began to vapor and fume in a way which only roused a smile on
General Dulsett's face.</p>

<p>However, in the course of a speech loudly addressed in Dutch
to his countrymen, he made use of an insulting expression towards
the English, which Moraine understood. Stepping up to the
braggart, Moraine asked him if he had heard aright, if not, would
he kindly repeat the term? Looking at him with all the contempt
he could throw in a glance, the Dutchman did so, and immediately
received a back-hander from Moraine's open hand across the mouth
that made the blood start.</p>

<p>Foaming with rage he would have drawn his sword, but the
German laid his hand on his shoulder, and in a stern tone bade
him desist, which he sullenly did.</p>

<p>This squabble naturally somewhat strained any friendly
relations which might have been on the point of springing up.
However, the Dutch officer retired to the steamer, and
negotiations were resumed. But, talk as they might, the result
was the same. The party were not to proceed a step further. That
was the unalterable ultimatum, which at last they were forced to
acquiesce in. It was past noon when this was finally settled, and
General Dulsett invited the party to partake of their mid-day
meal with us. They all accepted the offer, with the exception, of
course, of the Dutch officer, who was nursing his cut lip and
wounded honor on board the steam launch.</p>

<p>Now that the inevitable was accepted, our guests proved right
good company. Their curiosity with regard to the tableland was
naturally insatiable, and the more they heard the more they
desired to go on. This was but natural, and to be expected. But
the leading professor was evidently partly appeased by the
geographical maps General Dulsett supplied him with. This, at
least, would be something to take back.</p>

<p>At the invitation of the party we adjourned on board the
launches, and were soon busy examining the latest mechanical
improvements. The launches were moored to the bank close
together, and, happening to look up, I saw La Manca on board the
other one, in conversation with the Dutch officer. Apparently, by
their gestures, they were merely talking of certain details in
the construction, and, as the rest of us were all on the boat
where I was, their conversation would be perfectly private. As we
went back to our camp the German officer went with us, and drew
General Dulsett aside. After a few words the latter crossed to
Moraine, and said something to him at which he smiled and gave a
short reply. I guessed it was a hostile message from the
Dutchman.</p>

<p>'Doctor,' he said, and called me over. 'Captain Heidekker has
brought a request for satisfaction from the gentleman whom our
friend Moraine very properly reprimanded this morning.'</p>

<p>'Between ourselves I quite agree with you,' interrupted the
German smilingly. 'Moraine, as the challenged party, has selected
pistols at daybreak to-morrow. I will act as his friend. Will you
come in case of accidents?'</p>

<p>'Of course,' I replied; and after a few remarks we parted.</p>

<p>Next morning at daylight we paraded our men, and Moraine, who
was an excellent shot, put a bullet through the young fellow's
shoulder. I bound it up for him, and assured him that, but for a
little stiffness, he would soon be as right as ever. But he was
not a gentleman, and growled out some guttural curses, so, to put
him at his ease, I condoled with him on being such a bad shot, at
which he squirmed; and congratulated him on Moraine letting him
off so easy, at which he squirmed still more.</p>

<p>Preparations for departure were soon made by the Dutch
expedition, but we remained for a day or two longer just to see
them off the premises as it were. Before leaving however, an
incident occurred ominous of further trouble. The wounded
officer, who was resting on a deck chair, asked for an interview
with General Dulsett.</p>

<p>'As I represent the Dutch Government in this matter,' he said,
'I must ask you by what right you assume complete control over
this territory?'</p>

<p>'By the right of first discovery by our ancestors, and
continuous occupation ever since.'</p>

<p>'What country do you claim under these conditions?'</p>

<p>'The whole area drained by the Amberno River and its
tributaries; from the mouth to the summit of the Charles Louis
Range.'</p>

<p>'You actually repudiate all Dutch claims.'</p>

<p>'Utterly. Your countrymen have no claim according to
international law.'</p>

<p>There was a frigid bow on either side, and they parted.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Time passed on, and Doria's vigilance never relaxed, neither
did my watch on La Manca, but my chance had gone unobserved, or
those steam launches had never left the river. Then came the
expected news&mdash;two transports, convoyed by gunboats, had
arrived, and a party was immediately sent to watch their
movements.</p>

<p>When the intelligence came that soldiers were landed General
Dulsett departed to warn the invaders that their progress would
be regarded as a declaration of war, and if necessary to declare
it forthwith. Naturally this was laughed at, and hostilities
shortly commenced. This was very one-sided. The men of Aurumnia,
as the community was named, avoided all open warfare as yet, and
with their superior explosives and knowledge of the country
inflicted great loss on the enemy without losing a man.</p>

<p>General Dulsett's motive was to weary them out, and
disorganise and terrorise the men without inflicting great loss.
This was rapidly being done. The Dutch troops had not advanced
thirty miles before they were ripe for a panic, and the least
demonstration in force by the Aurumnians would have made them lay
down their arms. But this was not Doria's policy. He wanted to
give them a dread of the country, not to take prisoners.</p>

<p>Small attempts to ascend the river had been made, but they had
been easily defeated. In fact, the desultory warfare thus kept
up, while it might have been exciting to the Dutch, who bore all
the losses, was remarkably tame on our side. But a deeper scheme
than we suspected had been hatched in La Manca's treacherous
brain.</p>

<p>In that short interview with the Dutch officer he had
entrusted to him the plan of a scheme for acquiring the territory
of Aurumnia and the riches of the world on certain terms. The
answer to this he had received in some underhand manner, and the
invasion that followed was the result.</p>

<p>When the great war was on Holland had drifted into an alliance
with Russia and Germany, and this alliance was now renewed. This
of course I learned after the catastrophe. Russia, Germany, and
Holland were to share the dominion of the world, for La Manca had
betrayed everything, the boundless wealth, the impregnable armor
plates, and the new explosives, of which, however, he fortunately
did not know the whole of the secret. The Dutch army at the mouth
of the Amberno was simply a bait, poor devils sent there to
distract our attention and fall victims in the game. Meanwhile in
Geelvink Bay the real campaign was being organised. Russian
troops were landed on Schouten and Jobi Islands, and from there
drafted slowly on to the mainland, and before the fact became
known to us an army of 30,000 men was on the march to attack
Aurumnia with its garrison of 5000. The country through which
they advanced, though mountainous, offered no such natural
opposition as did the advance from the north by the Amberno.</p>

<p>How our information corps had thus failed us we could not then
make out, but if treachery was the agent it was easy, as all
men's thoughts were centred on the Dutch invasion.</p>

<h3>VI</h3>

<p class="first">
DORIA heard the news without dismay, and merely remarked, 'I'm
sorry for the awful slaughter, for not a man will go back: but
they rush on their fate.'</p>

<p>I was at his house at the time; and when he left to assume his
duties Mme. Doria entered.</p>

<p>'This is treachery,' she said.</p>

<p>'And not hard to guess the traitor.'</p>

<p>'Hard, no! I have spoken to Doria, and told him my suspicions;
this is no time for concealing them. But he will not listen, nor
have the man arrested. He blames all to the mistake made in
giving the Dutch expedition the maps.'</p>

<p>'How can he be so blind? The maps told nothing of the gold,
and without that lure do you! suppose that Russia would have sent
such an army to conquer a poor little colony in which they have
no interest? No! La Manca has told them all. Russia and Germany
both came out of the great war with loss and defeat; now, at
their feet, defended by a handful of men, lies illimitable wealth
and the secret of invulnerable armor-plating. Believe me, we
shall hear of the Germans as allies yet. Aurumnia conquered, and
the world is at their mercy. Truly this gold might work the
world's destruction; but not as the old Governor thought.'</p>

<p>'Can we do nothing more?'</p>

<p>'I will see Doria, and urge on him my views; but I doubt his
listening.'</p>

<p>I did as I said. I had a long interview with Doria; but in
vain. He would not connect treachery with La Manca's name. It was
impossible.</p>

<p>'Is the under-electrician trustworthy?' I asked.</p>

<p>'As true as La Manca.'</p>

<p>'That's not saying much; but I prefer his looks to La Manca.
Listen to me, for the country is at stake. Take Mannors with you
and examine the defences at the Black Pass; but not a word to
anyone about your mission.'</p>

<p>'I will do this; it is my duty; and I will do it at once.'</p>

<p>I sighed with relief. The Black Pass was a defile two miles
long, and the only accessible pass on the west. If the defences
had been tampered with, and Mannors was a true man, Doria would
yet be in time to restore any electrical communication needful,
for all their defence work rested on an electrical basis.
Moreover, La Manca's guilt would be proved. No one but he could
tamper successfully with the communications so as to allow the
Russians to pass safely through.</p>

<p>I passed a restless afternoon; the more I thought, the more
did the man's diabolical treachery become apparent. I had told
all to Moraine, and towards evening, still talking to him, we
found ourselves at the tram station, whence the electric system
radiated to all parts. A tram started as we stepped on the
platform&mdash;a tramcar, with only one passenger in it, La
Manca. I saw him, but he did not see us. By this time, of course,
I was well acquainted with everybody, and as a member of the
council met with every respect.</p>

<p>'Mr. La Manca is making a late journey to-night?' I said to
the man in charge of the station.</p>

<p>'He is going to the range, I suppose, to see that everything
is in order,' he replied. The range meant the gold mine.</p>

<p>'To see that everything is out of order,' was the thought that
instinctively flashed through my brain. But I did not speak.</p>

<p>Turning to Moraine, I asked him if he felt inclined for a trip
down there. He answered eagerly In the affirmative, and I saw his
thoughts were mine. Being a council member, I had a right to a
special tram, and the stationmaster had one quickly ready.</p>

<p>'Madam Doria went there half an hour before La Manca,' he
said. 'I suppose you will come back together,' he added as we
started.</p>

<p>Once out of sight of the station, Moraine went forward and
spoke to the driver or guard, for he was both. Our pace increased
until it was greater than any I had travelled before. Still La
Manca must have travelled as fast, or faster, for his car was
standing empty when we arrived at the terminus.</p>

<p>As rapidly as possible we hurried along the road that
separated us from the house of the keeper of the secret.
Risdant's son admitted us. Moraine struck in before I could
speak.</p>

<p>'We have an important communication for Mr. La Manca, and have
followed him here. Where is he?'</p>

<p>'In the mine with my father.'</p>

<p>'We must see him instantly. Lead on with a light.'</p>

<p>The young man knew us, and the times were troublous; so he
obeyed at once. We did not stop to don overalls; but rushed after
our guide. As we neared the circular opening from which opened
the door to the treasure cavern we heard loud voices ahead, and
at the door we saw a strange sight.</p>

<p>At the foot of the pedestal of the towering figure of Governor
Kurtzon lay old Risdant wounded and bleeding. Between him and La
Manca, who still held the dagger in his hand, stood Madam Doria
grasping a pistol. Without asking a question, Moraine, I, and
young Risdant threw ourselves on La Manca, overpowered, and
secured him. Then the son knelt by his father, and supported him
while I examined the wound.</p>

<p>It was fatal, I was grieved to find; but he might linger for
some time. The son went away to procure a litter on which to
carry him, and Madam Doria told us the story.</p>

<p>It suddenly occurred to her that a traitor would naturally
wish to avert the forlorn hope explosion, which would cover up
the source of the gold. Fired with a sudden determination, she
started off to warn Risdant not to obey any orders, except those
sent by Doria Papuan or General Dulsett. While still talking, in
the chamber of Governor Kurtzon, they heard footsteps
approaching. She hid behind the pedestal and La Manca came in. He
ordered Risdant to assist him in disconnecting the wires, stating
that all the enemy had been destroyed, and that Aurumnia was now
safe. This Risdant refused to do, and a scuffle ensued, in which,
in spite of Risdant's age, La Manca was getting the worst of it;
when his passion got the better of him, and he stabbed the
faithful old man. He would have repeated the blow had not Madam
Doria stepped forward and covered him with her revolver. Just
then we made our appearance, and the play was over.</p>

<p>Mme. Doria, under Moraine's convoy, went back to town, taking
with them our prisoner, guarded by one of the men employed at the
mines. I remained to attend still further to Risdant. The door
into the treasure chamber was closed, and wise Governor Kurtzon
never saw the light again.</p>

<p>It was nearing daylight before I returned, leaving my patient
better and easier. As I walked home I heard rapid steps behind
me, and Doria overtook me.</p>

<p>'I have just returned,' he said in breathless tones. 'You are
right, Beckford, the treachery of hell has been at work. Oh! when
I catch that villain&mdash;'</p>

<p>'He is caught,' I interrupted.</p>

<p>'Caught! How, when, where?'</p>

<p>'Tell me your story first,' I said.</p>

<p>'It is soon told. The Black Pass was virtually
undefended&mdash;an army of babies could have walked through it.
All communication had been not only destroyed, but so carefully
manipulated that it would have brought havoc on the defenders to
work the wires. Before the sun gilds Mount Orient's crest
everything will be ready again for the Russian reception.'</p>

<p>As shortly as possible I told him my story and of Mme. Doria's
share in it. I was tempted to tell him that if he had listened to
the warnings of her intuition it might have been all well still,
but when I looked at his worn, white face I refrained.</p>

<p>Neither Moraine nor I attended the council at which La Manca
was judged and condemned; it was not our business.</p>

<p>A week passed, and the Russians were allowed to advance
unmolested. Then a summons came to us from the Black Pass, and we
went there. As I said before, it was a defile, two miles long,
with precipitous sides, and could be defended with ease, but the
foe relied on treachery for success. We noticed that the outlet
was blocked up by blasting the rocks on either side, and the
black, narrow chasm stretched straight before us for a long
distance without bending.</p>

<p>'It looks like a grave,' I said.</p>

<p>'Then it looks like what it is going to be,' answered Doria.
'The Russians have already sent an advance to reconnoitre, and
their main army will probably march through to-morrow. La Manca
is here to welcome them,' said the general.</p>

<p>'La Manca,' I repeated. Then he drew my attention to what I
had not noticed before. At the head of the pass, on the brow of
the cliff, stood a mighty gallows, and from the beam swung a
body. I did not ask whose. Judas had received his reward. They
told me that he died, sullen to the last.</p>

<p>The night passed undisturbed, and in the morning Doria took
his station at the table, on which stood the telegraph
instrument. All that fateful morning it clicked at intervals
steadily, and Doria and the general relieved one another
occasionally. At two o'clock something decisive had happened.
Doria pressed down the key hard, and rose from the table; at the
same time a soldier announced that the head of a Russian column
was in sight, rounding the bend of the defile. Doria lifted his
hand, and we heard from afar off the roar of a mighty peal of
thunder. The cliffs at the entrance had been shattered, retreat
was cut off, and the Russians were in their grave. There seemed
some doubt in their ranks. Officers were gathered together
examining the dangling body of the traitor through their field-
glasses.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly they seemed to conceive what had befallen them,
what a trap they had entered but before an order could be issued,
the fire of death broke forth from each side. It was most
horrible. The murderous fusillade of machine guns was at times
broken by the reports of the explosion of mines, which hurled
tons and tons of rock down. The smoke from these mercifully hid
the terrible sight, and the roar of the artillery drowned the
wail of agony and despair that arose. Hemmed between the walls of
solid rock, both advance and retreat cut off, they could only
await death and agonising wounds. So it went on, and out of that
Black Pass arose a smoke freighted with souls just torn from
their bodies, until the firing ceased, and in the succeeding
silence there arose only a few feeble, dying groans. It was done.
The Russian army of invasion was annihilated to a man. Down in
that bloody pass they lay, never more to be seen.</p>

<p>A tram car dashed up, and Mme. Doria descended. She almost
staggered down to her husband's arms; she had no eyes for the
yawning gulf of hell beneath; some dire and dreadful misfortune
was evidently impending.</p>

<p>'More treachery,' she gasped. 'A German army has come from the
East. The passes have been betrayed by La Manca's men, two have
been taken, and surrendered without opposition, and the mines
have been drawn. They are now pouring on to the tableland, and
are within our defences.'</p>

<p>She finished her tale of horror, and then fainted.</p>

<p>Doria lifted her in his arms, and carried her back to the tram
car. Without a word, in the face of such awful calamity, we took
our seats, and the car sped back to Ban Yammoo.</p>

<p>All there was confusion and dismay, but no craven fear was
visible. As we descended from the car Doria called to us, and we
went over to him.</p>

<p>'Moraine and Beckford, we will now say good bye. I give you
back your parole. Leave this doomed city, and make the best of
your way to the coast; take the <i>serang</i> with you, and take
this,' and he handed Moraine a stone with strange markings on
it.</p>

<p>'That will be your safeguard through the natives&mdash;they
will obey that, and serve you. The Dutch have left sick and
sorry. There are boats at the landing; take any one and provision
it and go, with my kindest wishes for your welfare. You are
welcome now to tell what you like.'</p>

<p>'Good-bye, friends,' said Mme. Doria, extending both her
hands. In that supreme hour no word of repining had escaped her
lips; her duty was plain, and it was resignation.</p>

<p>'But, Doria,' I stammered, 'we cannot act as cowards, and
desert you.'</p>

<p>'No, by God!' said Moraine. 'Dear friends, this is folly. The
hour has struck. To-morrow commences our last day. But what will
my small army of men, unused to war, do against the veterans of
Germany in the open. Four times our number. No, it is our first
and last fight, but we shall die hard. When the conqueror reaps
the victory, as he thinks, the hour of his defeat has come.
Defeat! No! An overthrow as utter as befell the Russians in the
Black Pass. The victor and vanquished will be heard of no more by
the world. When I told you that the explosion there,' and he
pointed to the range, 'would work havoc, I did not tell you all.
You will see for yourselves soon. Meantime, you helped to unmask
and secure the traitor, and for that I will thank you again in
some other world.'</p>

<p>He paused, and Mme. Doria broke in, 'You see, dear friends,
that however brave and willing your arms are, they would not
avail us, only add other victims. Good bye again, and I pray you
not to court death uselessly, but to hasten.'</p>

<p>What could we do but obey, and we obeyed. With many a
lingering look we were hastening away, when Doria hailed us.</p>

<p>'Warn the natives as you go to keep to the sea shore,' he
shouted. I understood him, and waved my hand in the affirmative,
and that was the last I saw of the most wonderful man in the
world, betrayed by the weakness of being trustful; and the most
noble woman.</p>

<p>With the assistance of the <i>serang</i>, who worked with the
energy of two men when he knew what we were fleeing from, we were
soon off, but when we were afloat and making swiftly down the
river, Rastan began a strange, low chant I had never heard
before. In fact, I had never heard a Malay sing before.</p>

<p>'What's started you, Rastan?' I asked.</p>

<p>'I saw that big killing at the Black Pass. I nearly ran down
with my knife. My blood was mad. How they fell and cried, and how
the big rocks crushed them!'</p>

<p>'There will be bigger killing to-morrow, Rastan.' I said.</p>

<p>'I know it; but you know there is something behind, or you
would have stayed. I would love to have stayed, but I know that
you know what will come, or you would not go. You are not afraid
of the killing.'</p>

<p>'Pull, you fellows, and don't chatter so much,' snarled
Moraine from the stern, where, in a black temper, he was sitting
steering. We pulled and steered by spells, and when day broke we
were out of the gloomy gorge through which we had passed up. We
kept on; we guessed the end would not come till night, and pushed
on to warn the natives.</p>

<p>The first body we met knew and acknowledged the stone. They
told us that the Dutch were gone, and we told them to fly to the
mangroves, for the mountains would shake and the river come down
in flood. We kept on, and, the river being higher, shot the
rapids easily, and, towards evening, drew up at a bend where the
point of a range ran into the river and turned its course
somewhat.</p>

<p>Here we landed, and taking food and wine climbed the highest
point before the sun set. From here we could see the black
boundary range and the fair white one beyond, with Mount Orient
prominent and beautiful. Then we heard the murmur of voices and
the pattering of bare feet. The natives, alive to the idea that
something was going to happen, had gathered, and followed us.
They had sent messengers down the river they said. They grouped
themselves around us and waited.</p>

<p>Suddenly a deep sigh went up from them. Flashing through the
darkness a ragged zone of fire had seemingly circled the base of
Mount Orient, and disappeared. Risdant, or his son, had done his
duty. More than ten minutes afterwards a dull, heavy boom reached
our ears. Then there was silence and darkness.</p>

<p>An hour passed, and a low cry broke from all, for Mount Orient
glowed as when the sun touched her. When first I saw this
mountain I said to myself it is a dormant volcano, and one of the
highest in the world. Now, the terrific force of the explosion
that had rent its base had roused the sleeping fires, and once
more they burst forth to ravage and consume as they had done in
bygone times.</p>

<p>The fertility of that wonderful tableland was explained, and
the presence of the gold. Where would that gold vanish? Nevermore
would it be a lure to drag men to the shambles of the battle
field. It was gone. And with it the guardian race and their
conquerors.</p>

<p>A black pall soon enveloped everything. All the terrors of an
awful eruption followed; for days it lasted, and the river ran
boiling mud. At last, starved, and wearied with horror, we
ventured down and wandered on with the natives to the sea. There,
after a while, a Malay <i>proa</i> took us off, and we reached
civilisation, bearing with us as the only relic out of the riches
of the world the carved pebble Doria had given us at the last.
The Russian ships at Geelvink Bay and the German ships at
Astrolabe Bay waited long for the return of the men with the
gold. But they are buried beneath the lava, where nobler hearts
than theirs rest.</p>

<i>If you can have one hidden kingdom in New Guinea, surely there's<br>
room for a second... A humorous and cynical take on the subject.&mdash;Ed.</i></p>
<br>
<hr>
<br>

<p class="first">
OVER all and through all the mingled memories of my awakening
I heard the ceaseless gurgle of the splash of the boat's bow as
she tossed up and down, and the crashing noise of the wavelets as
they broke against her planks. Gradually, slowly coming to my
senses, I found that the noise was somewhat different to the
dread monotony I had been accustomed to. The lapping sound was no
longer directly beneath my head; but, though it was still
audible, it was more remote, and I languidly opened my eyes to
discover the cause I was ashore, no longer adrift.</p>

<p>Evidently lying on solid ground. The <i>lap-lap</i> of the
hungry waves that had been striving to get at us so long was no
longer close to me, for I was no longer In the boat. The smell of
burning wood was in my nostrils, and with it that indescribable
odor that told me that I was in a native camp of colored men.</p>

<p>Rousing myself, I found that I was lying on the sand above
high-water mark, and that, not far away, was a camp of about half
a dozen natives. They were not regarding me, but when I raised
myself on my elbow and looked towards them one of them came over
to me. He was a tall savage, with the yellow-dyed mop of the
Papuan and the ready smile and white teeth of the tribes
inhabiting the south of New Guinea, These fellows, as I knew,
would smile cheerily if they were going to eat you the next
minute; but still it was pleasant to see it. But our attempts at
conversation were disastrous. As to how I came to be there, or
how I had escaped the sea, I could not learn from him. Still, he
was friendly, and brought me a drink, and I lay back and looked
at the blue sky and considered.</p>

<p>Adam Joyce and I had patched up the boat on the sandbank where
our schooner had been wrecked, after the trouble we had had with
the kanakas and the Malay <i>serang</i>, who formed our crew. I
remembered our labor in the boat, the constant bailing, the
thirst, the horror of it all, and then came a blank.</p>

<p>What had become of Joyce? Once more I struggled to get up, and
the same young fellow came to me, and assisted me. I tried hard
to make him understand that I wanted to know where my companion
was; but in return he could only show me the empty, crazy boat
drawn above high-water mark, evidently by the savages. One of
these fellows offered me some turtle that they were busy eating,
and although my appetite was not great, I tried to eat some to
regain my strength. The blank in my memory worried me
exceedingly, and I tried vainly to piece things together; but
could not get beyond the one incident of the madness of Joyce and
my attempt to tie him down in the boat to prevent him going
overboard.</p>

<p>Striving to recall these disjointed memories, it suddenly
struck me whether the delusion was not on my part, and whether
all the madness that I thought Joyce displayed had not arisen in
my own brain. Joyce had asserted that he saw a woman in a canoe,
and tried to jump overboard to swim to her. We were both weak and
desperate with hunger and thirst. I had tried to restrain him,
for I could see neither land nor canoe. We had struggled
together, and try as I could I remembered no more. Evidently we
had been near land, and I must have been rescued by the natives
while in an unconscious state. One of the natives now made signs
to me to indicate that they were going away, and I was to
accompany them. They did not seem unfriendly nor unacquainted
with whites; but they had not had much intercourse with them, to
judge by their ignorance of language fitted to converse in. I was
still very weak, and made them understand that I could not walk
far, and we set out. Leaving the beach we almost immediately got
into low, scrubby country which shut out all view ahead. We
seemed to be following a kind of beaten track that was not much
used although plain enough to follow easily. Fortunately we had
not far to go before we emerged from, the scrub on to the bank of
a broad river, and at the edge of it was a large canoe, it was
somewhat different from the others I had seen amongst the natives
of Papua, but I recognised the ornamentation of the prow. We got
in the canoe, and the natives began to paddle up what was
evidently the estuary of a large river. I was permitted to rest
in the bottom of the boat, and the young fellow I have mentioned
before gave me a coconut, the milk of which I found very
refreshing.</p>

<p>The six natives paddled silently, steadily, and swiftly, for
we were in tidal waters and the tide was making. By sundown we
must have Coins many miles and the river's, banks began to be
clothed with a forest of gigantic trees, but there was no sign of
animal life or human habitation. A few parrots and a flight of
two at pigeons was all I saw. At nightfall we landed, and the
natives lit a fire and warmed some food. I felt better for the
rest and refreshment, and tried to make them tell me what they
were going to do with me, and where they going; but on this point
they would afford me no information. They were very quiet amongst
themselves, and, after eating, smoked a strong-smelling tobacco
in bamboo pipes.. They were not much different to the Papuans I
had seen, but were rather better looking and more intelligent in
appearance, and lighter in color. I could only await with
patience their intentions which did not seem to be hostile. They
had bows and arrows, but no other weapons, and their dress was
only a loin cloth of grass.</p>

<p>I fell asleep for some hours, and was awakened at what I
fancied was about midnight by the altitude of the constellations.
We returned to the canoe, and our silent journey recommenced.</p>

<p>The dawn was beginning to brighten when we turned off the main
stream, and our progress was Slow up a tributary branch, and
against a current, for we went much slower. Daylight showed us to
be in a narrow stream still, with the huge forest trees on either
side of us, but now I saw in one place the tree houses peculiar
to New Guinea, but I saw no inhabitants. It was well on in the
morning when we landed, and, as they took everything out of the
canoe and made it fast in a sheltered spot, I concluded that our
water journey was done, and wherever we were bound for it would
have to be finished by land. I was, however, now in much fitter
state to stand fatigue, and felt in better spirits altogether,
but the mystery of my companion's disappearance still haunted me.
Apparently he had not been killed by the natives who had me with
them.</p>

<p>Leaving the stream, we went through the forest, which had here
and there open patches and signs of old cultivation, but in no
case did they appear to have been recently tended. At last we
came to a good-sized village, but the huts were deserted, and
neither pigs nor poultry were to be seen.</p>

<p>We rested, and two of the natives went away, and presently
returned with some yams and coconuts, and some birds they had
killed. I gave up trying to conjecture what they were going to do
with me, and ate what was given me with a good appetite.</p>

<p>Our journey was continued that day as far as another deserted
village, where we rested that night. In the morning, soon after
we started, we came upon a regular track, apparently at one time
well used, but now becoming overgrown and rank with vegetation.
Still we went on, the country becoming more hilly and the forest
less close in appearance as we advanced. At last we were amongst
fair-sized ranges, and our way became toilsome and difficult.
Finally, when surmounting a higher ridge than usual, I caught a
glimpse of the land ahead, and, from what I saw, concluded that
we should soon reach a dividing watershed of some sort. The
silence of my captors now somewhat relaxed, and they laughed and
chatted to each other more after the fashion of the other Papuans
I had met. Evidently we were nearing our destination, and they
were pleased at coming to the end of their journey.</p>

<p>Coming suddenly to clear country and a sheer descent, I saw
before me the most wonderful and beautiful view I ever saw in my
life, or ever will see. A valley was before us, smiling under the
afternoon sun, rich in foliage and vegetation, and watered by a
serpentine river which flowed through its entire length. The land
was park-like in appearance, and rose and fell in undulations. I
could see habitations scattered about, and plantations of many
shades of green, indicating different sorts of crops. The six
natives halted, and broke into a perfect babble of talk that was
strange, after, their late grim, silence. They pointed eagerly to
different objects, evidently familiar to them, and by their
bright looks and evident pleasure, it was quite plain that it was
their native home we were overlooking.</p>

<p>Towards the head of the valley, the mountains towered far
aloft, and some appeared snow capped. The young native whom I
have once or twice spoken of took me by the arm, and pointing to
the beautiful valley, said 'Allako!' once or twice eagerly. I
nodded and smiled in answer, which seemed greatly to please him,
and he patted my arm as if to show me that I was quite safe, and
would meet with no harm. Strange, to say the term 'Allako!'
seemed familiar to me, but I could not then recall where or when
I had heard it before.</p>

<p>I have said there was a sheer descent beneath our feet, down
to the valley and, this I saw, would have to be negotiated by
means of a zigzag path, which did not look any too pleasant for
anyone but a practised mountaineer. However, the natives put me
between them, and after I started I recovered my nerve somewhat,
and found the descent looked worse that it really was. It took
some time, however, and I was glad whet we got to the bottom, and
stood on level ground.</p>

<p>The instant we reached the foot of the descent, the six
natives dropped on their knees, and bowing down their heads
touched the earth with their foreheads. This attitude, so
different to the habits of the Papuans, struck me with
astonishment, for, as a rule, the natives of New Guinea have
little reverence for anything, and hardly any religion, unless
the worship of some of their ancestors be considered in that
light. Whether their devotional attitude awoke a dormant train of
thought or not I cannot say, but, now I remembered there was a
legend or myth connecting the word, of 'Allako,' with some
unknown race in the interior, who were held by the other tribes
in great awe and terror. There were said to be Amazonian women
amongst them, and it certainly seemed as though the tribes in the
country we had passed through had either been driven out, or
wilfully abandoned their homes. Now, had I really come to this
wonderful Allako that, as I thought, no European had visited.</p>

<p>The natives rose and pushed on, and soon we were greeted by
others Who had been working In the plantations, and now hastened
to greet the returned wanderers. They evinced no surprise at
seeing me, it was quite evident that these were not homestaying
folk, and had been in parts of New Guinea where members of the
white race are a familiar sight. They were a handsome race of
savages, of a light copper color, and the only actual savage
touch, beyond the scanty dress, was the mop of dyed hair; and
this I put down to their adopting, on account of being able to
pass, when outside their own country, as ordinary Papuans. In
this conjecture, I afterwards found I was right. In spite of the
anxiety I naturally felt as to the future, I could not help
feeling rejoiced at being amongst such a peaceful, simple people,
after the perils of the sea I had lately undergone.</p>

<p>The people gathered round us good-humouredly, and we went
through the scattered houses until we arrived at the main cluster
of buildings. The houses we had seen were much superior to the
ordinary run of New Guinea habitations, but the one we approached
was large and well built enough to have graced a more civilised
country than Papua. Out of the house came a woman of great beauty
and European origin, as could be at once seen. She was dressed in
a long waist-petticoat only, but she wore jewellery in the shape
of gold bangles on her arms, and altogether appeared a person of
authority. Her hair was black and her eyes the same, while her
complexion was a rich olive, warm-tinted and lustrous. She was a
splendid-looking creature as she stood there gazing at me, and
behind her came other women dressed like the women I had seen
coming along, and with no pretence to any admixture of European
blood.</p>

<p>My guardian spoke to the woman as one speaks to a superior,
But what he said was of course unintelligible to me. Presently,
however, she addressed me, and though I did not fully understand
her; I caught enough to know that she was talking in broken
Spanish, a language in which I had some experience. I answered
her as well as I could, and she seemed exceedingly pleased at
having made herself understood. She spoke to the men who had come
with me, and they dispersed to their homes and left me standing
before the women, whom I took to be the originators of the Amazon
myth.</p>

<p>The mistress of the establishment, as she appeared to be,
asked me to come in, and I entered the house, and found the
interior comfortable and well furnished with mats and articles
made of bamboo. I had food brought to me, and I sat down on the
ground and ate. Then a bamboo pipe was given me, and I listened
while the lady of the house explained the situation. I will put
it in my own words.</p>

<p>In the early days of discovery some three centuries ago a
castaway Spanish captain and his followers were captured by the
Papuans, who admired them very much, so much so that they ate all
of them but the captain. He was a notable man, and managed to
obtain so much influence over them that he started an
independency of his own in the valley of Allako. He was a
sensible man, for all he insisted on was quiet, peaceful living
and good cultivation. His descendants succeeded him one after
another, and preserved their independence, and gradually, by
strong persuasions, managed to get the other tribes to withdraw
from the neighborhood, and hence they lived a happy, prosperous
life in the fertile valley.</p>

<p>But it was part of their belief that the white strain of blood
was necessary in the reigning family. To preserve this heritage
parties of natives visited other parts of New Guinea, and, to put
it plainly, kidnapped men for their representative of the royal
family to marry. Thus it happened that I had fallen into the
hands of a kidnapping party, and the fate before me was to wed
the charming creature whose hospitality I was enjoying, provided
that she approved of me. If she did not, the alternative was
simplicity itself, I should be put to death.</p>

<p></p>

<p>THE trouble in which I was placed was rather perplexing. It
was not as though I could settle the matter myself in any way,
but Donnareena, as she was called by the natives, held the power
exclusively in her own hands. I might be able to gain her favour,
but that was but a fickle look out, and the least mistake might
consign me to death. That outlook seemed to stand out plainly,
fore evidently Donnareena was accustomed to having her own way,
and a husband, more or less, would be nothing to her.</p>

<p>Certainly, I had an advantage in my knowledge of Spanish, but
really, beyond saving my life, I had no particular desire, for
various reasons, to become a reigning partner in Allako, nor did
I intend to, excepting for a chance to get clear. However, I made
myself as agreeable as possible, and, finally, was conducted to a
large building, used as a sort of bachelor club by some of the
young men, and informed that those were my quarters pending
approval.</p>

<p>I was glad to find that the cheery young fellow of whom I have
made mention was amongst the residents in this house, and he made
me comfortable in a very kindly manner. Also, seemingly that I
now knew the customs of the country, he did not hesitate to
inform me, as well as he could, that he considered me a very
desirable occupant of the vacant throne. He as well led me to see
the place where undesirable white men were executed, an event
which had not occurred in his lifetime, so that he did not
conceal the idea he had latent in his mind, that, whichever way,
it went, I should be an object of interest to him. As I said,
they seemed a very, friendly sort of people, and anxious to
entertain strangers.</p>

<p>The particular form of entertainment designed for an
unsuccessful candidate to the throne of Allako consisted In
fastening him to a post and allowing all the young men to
practise on him with their weapons. To practise only. It was
considered bad form to bring the pastime to a conclusion by
killing the subject outright. That was what I had to expect if
Donnareena did not approve of me as a husband. If she did not, I
felt instinctively that I should dislike Donnareena very
much.</p>

<p>I passed that night very comfortably under the circumstances,
and the next morning, after a swim in the cold waters of the
river that flowed through the valley, and a capital breakfast of
fish, was conducted again to the presence of the lady in whose
hands lay my destiny. Donnareena was very gracious. It was
obvious that for the present I was safe; but what feminine vagary
might interfere with the interest she felt in me I could not
tell.</p>

<p>However, I was soon to find out, for in the course of the
morning there was commotion amongst the inhabitants of the
valley, and this was in consequence of a fresh party of
kidnappers appearing, bringing with them no less a person than
Joyce, my partner in the schooner. Joyce and I greeted one
another with effusion, while the friendly natives looked
wonderingly on. This was an event in the annals of
Allako&mdash;two white men at the same time, two candidates for
the hand of the reigning princess.</p>

<p>This thought struck me with a direful feeling, immediately
after the first greeting with Joyce, who, by the way, seemed
uncommonly like a lunatic. True, he recognised me, but he could
give me no connected account of his escape, or parting with me.
However, the ceremony of presenting him to Donnareena had to be
gone through, and at this I had to attend, as Joyce could not
make himself understood as well as I could. Donnareena seemed
much struck with Joyce, who was a younger and better-looking man
than myself, and I began to feel a nasty qualm like being tied to
a post and practised on by my cheerful young friend and his
companions.</p>

<p>As soon as possible I got Joyce away, and told him the nature
of the situation, but the infatuated fool seemed quite pleased,
and remarked that Donnareena was a very fine young woman indeed,
and that he believed that it was a vision of her he saw that made
him jump out of the boat, for, from what I managed to piece
together, Joyce must have jumped out, and left me stunned in the
bottom. Seemingly, he was rescued by another party of the men of
Allako, and brought to the valley by a different route.</p>

<p>Anyhow, his coming was most unfortunate, as it was evident
that Allako did not want two candidates for the hand of the
princess, and one of us would have to go to the execution post;
that seemed inevitable. Well, we had at least a week to decide
the matter, and something might be done in that lime; meantime,
we had to make ourselves agreeable to Donnareena. Certainly,
Joyce had the advantage of me in youth and appearance, but then,
he could not make the lady understand him as easily as I could,
therefore the handicap was not at all on his side, and as I had
to interpret, I saw a chance open. I proposed to Joyce that we
should come to some arrangement in the matter, by which the
successful suitor for the hand of the princess should insist upon
the rejected one being spared; but Joyce was seemingly so far
gone in stupidity that he could not see that we should work
together for our mutual benefit. He replied that it was
impossible to alter the traditional laws of Allako, and that the
man who failed would have to make the best of it. For his part,
he did not mean to fail. Donnareena was a magnificent creature,
and if he did not succeed, in gaining her affections he was
content to die. What had happened to him I don't know, but it was
quite evident that his brain was affected past recovery, and that
I must work for myself.</p>

<p>That night I was awakened by a most infernal noise, and, going
out, I found that besotted fool singing a love song outside
Donnareena's house. I had told him of the origin of the people of
the valley, and he had got it into his crazy brain that it was
the correct thing to do, according to Spanish notions, to
serenade a lady. The people had got up, and were listening to
him, and, strange to say, they seemed rather pleased at the
lunatic's performance, and resented my attempt to restrain him.
After he had sung everything he could think of, from 'Wait till
the clouds roll by' to 'Ben Bolt,' he condescended, to retire;
but it was evident that he had made a good impression by his
musical abilities, which I must say were of the smallest.</p>

<p>I did not sleep much, for it seemed evident that such a
novelty as a singing white man would have first chance, and I
should be wedded to the execution post, and not to Donnareena. I
had made Joyce a fair offer to work together, and he had refused
it; new I had to set my wits against his.</p>

<p>Next morning I was called up to interpret between Donnareena
and Joyce, and had to convey to my rival the expression of
pleasure by the Queen at the musical treat he had afforded. I
felt much tempted to alter the wording, and tell Joyce that if he
started howling again he would get his head cut off, but on
second thoughts I did not; I had a better scheme in view. As long
as I was needful as interpreter, my life would be safe. I saw
that Donnareena was getting infatuated with the interesting
Joyce. I could wait until she was very far gone in love's young
dream, and then I would manage to turn her love into something
like hatred. A jealous or slighted woman will stick at nothing,
no more will a man with a torture post in view.</p>

<p></p>

<p>LIFE soon became intolerable. From morn to eve I found I had
nothing to do but translate love Passages between Joyce and
Donnareena, and the agony promised to be protected, for I soon
found out that instead of the week of courtship which should have
been mine, I was now condemned to be nothing but an interpreter
between Joyce and Donnareena for an indefinite time.</p>

<p>Still, in one way, it was best; it gave me an interval in
which to evolve some sort of a plan by which I could eventually
escape the doom of the torture post, and Joyce had proved so
ungrateful in every way that I did not care if the fates should
eventually lead him to death instead of me.</p>

<p>One morning when I had a little relief from the constant
interpretation, which I had to undergo, I persuaded the young
fellow, of whom I have spoken before, to take me for a walk
around the outside the town. I particularly wanted to find out
whether any of the other ascents or descents to the valley were
easier than the way we had come. He was a guileless youth, and in
the course of our walk and conversation let out a good deal of
Useful information. I found that some distance to the south of
where we had descended there was a gap in the cliffs,
comparatively easy of access, but which was guarded by a number
of men stationed there, whose duty it was to watch tale&mdash;the
only easy communication&mdash;to the valley of Allako.</p>

<p>I saw plainly that my only means of escape was to sacrifice
Joyce. The alternative was painful, but necessary. I was only
kept on until Joyce had learnt the language, and I was no longer
accessory, and now that love had sprung up between them they
would soon understand each other. I formed my plans accordingly.
The next day, when engaged in translating their amorous small
talk, I made a point of making Joyce say that what a pity it was
that such a divine creature should ever grow old. I saw
Donnareena's eyes flash at the suggestion, and the answer came us
expected.</p>

<p>'Surely I shall never be old in the eyes of Don Joyce?'</p>

<p>This was the sort of catlap I had to interpret between the
pair. I ignored Joyce's real answer altogether, and replied for
him, 'Not in the eyes of my soul, dear love, but in the eyes of
my body you are even now older than I am.'</p>

<p>Then the fat was in the fire with a vengeance. She turned on
Joyce and gave him a bit of her mind In choice language, which,
fortunately, he Hid not understand; but he could not help
understanding her looks, and the tone of her voice.</p>

<p>'What the devil have you been saying to her?' said Joyce
angrily to me. In turn she deciphered the angry element in his
voice, and naturally concluded that he was giving her a nasty
reply through me. I had started a pretty quarrel, and it waxed
hotter and hotter, Joyce abusing me and Donnareena, after the
unreasoning manner of a woman in a rage, letting Joyce have it,
regardless of whether he understood her or not. At last, when she
was almost ran down, she turned to me and said that she insisted
on knowing in precise terms what he had said. I pretended to
protest and deprecate the question, but at last gave in, and
informed her that he had only been anxious to inform her that he
loved her so much because she reminded him of a dearly-loved
aunt.</p>

<p>There was one wild scream of rage, a few sharp peremptory
orders, and Joyce was in the hands of a couple of strong women,
and literally dragged out at the house before he knew what was
happening to him. He was handed over to the care of some of the
men, and I, knowing that it was no time for explanations, retired
to the portion of the club-house set aside for me.</p>

<p>I found there was great consternation amongst the young men.
They could, of course, not guess what had happened to cause
Donnareena to perform like that, but they felt frightened of her
wrath from whatever cause it sprang. I, who had started the
trouble simply to see how events would turn out&mdash;for I had
no denned plan in my head&mdash;was able to sleep peacefully,
knowing full well that matters could not be worse as far as I was
concerned, and that possibly they might be better.</p>

<p>Well! The next morning, Joyce was brought up before the Queen,
and I also was made to take my station as interpreter, and the
following conversation passed:</p>

<p>First, she wanted to know what Don Joyce meant by saying that
she was old enough to remind him of a beloved aunt? I saw at once
that love had reasserted itself, and that she was anxious to give
Joyce a loophole of escape. Accordingly I asked Joyce what he
meant by saying that Donnareena was old enough to be his
aunt.</p>

<p>Of course, he flew into a rage, and denied it, and commenced
to abuse me. I pretended to be very indignant with him, and
finally, when Donnareena insisted on knowing what was going on, I
told her that he was protesting that he venerated her with the
same veneration that he bore to his grandmother.</p>

<p>Now, the Papuans have no particular religion, beyond a sort of
ancestor worship, and when Joyce, according to me, said that he
loved her with the sort of love that the general run of niggers
felt for their ancestors' bones, instead of the very human love
she expected, why, naturally she kicked up, and the result was
that poor Joyce went once more into durance vile.</p>

<p>But though Donnareena was thus hard upon Joyce, you may be
sure that it did not soften her one whit towards me; but I did
not expect it, my plans were deeper than that. Donnareena retired
in high dudgeon, and I wandered, about, and made as close
acquaintance as I could with the young fellow I have so often
mentioned, whose name was Poorpoorgai, for I intended him to help
me in my endeavors to escape. I persuaded him to allow me to
visit Joyce in his confinement, and as there had been no orders
laid down about it, I was admitted to my misguided companion and
former partner. He greeted me scornfully, and asked me whether I
considered myself a white man or not? I replied that I did.
Emphatically so; but that I did not include him under that
category.</p>

<p>He said I had made mischief between Donnareena and himself,
and I answered that he, by his opportune arrival, had done the
same. But for his coming, I should now be the happy husband of
the reigning Queen of Allako, Which, although not a position I
aspired to, was better than the death which was likely to be my
portion. To this Joyce had nothing to say, and finally I said
that, although he had brought all this trouble on us, I forgave
him, and we would endeavor to escape together.</p>

<p>This soothed him somewhat, and kept him quiet, and I now sent
word to Donnareena, and requested an audience. She assented to
see me, and I then informed her that I knew of a way to bring
Joyce to, his senses. I assured, her that it was the spirit of an
old aunt of his that was afflicting him, and leading his
affections away from her, and that I knew of a way to put a stop
to it.</p>

<p>She listened very scornfully at first, but after a bit her
curiosity was awakened, and she listened more attentively. I lied
like a Trojan on behalf of Joyce; told her now he was the same as
he always had been to her in reality, a slave to her youth and
beauty, but this vexatious spirit of his old aunt would suddenly
upset things, and make him say what he never intended to.</p>

<p>Finally, she agreed to my carrying out a plan that would
banish the spirit of the old aunt, and bring Joyce back to his
senses. But she also informed me that I should answer for it if
it did not succeed. Naturally, I expected that&mdash;I told her
that I must have Poorpoorgai's assistance in the experiment, and
she told that youth to do whatever I told him. Then I went to
Joyce, and told him. I had made it up with Donnareena, and we
would act some mummery, after which he would find himself back in
favor again. To this he agreed, and, the fright having somewhat
restored his wits, said that when he became the husband of
Donnareena he would at once have my life spared. I expressed my
gratitude, but privately I did not attach any importance whatever
to this, as I guessed that Donnareena would do just as she
liked&mdash;husband or no husband. I had my own plans for getting
away, and they did not depend upon anybody but myself. That night
I got Joyce released, and told him to go and do the singing
business again, which he did to the great delight of all the
people of Allako.</p>

<p>Now, it may be thought that the easiest way to settle the
matter would be to stipulate for my release as a reward for
restoring Joyce to the allegiance he had never really abandoned,
and this was my intention at first, but from something
Poorpoorgai had dropped, I found that that was beyond the power
of Donnareena herself. No white man must leave Allako, and only
one must remain alive In it. This seemed to me rather unfair to
the other ladies of Allako, who might have fancied a white
husband, and, had time permitted, I would have endeavored to have
stirred up discontent amongst them on the subject; but time did
not permit. I presume the law was strictly enforced to prevent
the advent of a rival royal house. Joyce finished his serenade,
as hoarse as a crow, and the remainder of the night passed in
peace. In the morning I commenced my hanky-panky.</p>

<p>I led Joyce out To an open place, and stationed the queen and
her women in one position, and allowed the people to gather
round, but not in a circle, as I explained that I must have a
space left for the spirit to escape. I had drilled Poorpoorgai,
who was shaking with terror, that immediately he saw Joyce make a
movement towards the queen it would be a sign that the spirit had
left him. He was then at once to start as hard as he could for
the easy passage cut of the valley. The spirit would undoubtedly
pursue him, but as he was the fastest runner of his tribe he
ought to be able to easily escape her. I was a pretty good runner
myself, and in tip top condition; also, the men on guard at the
pass had been warned about the thing, so that they would not make
any attempt to stop Poorpoorgai with the spirit after him. I had
got myself up grotesquely with paint and pigment, and looked a
proper wizard for a savage tribe. Joyce had his instructions, and
we commenced operations.</p>

<p>I took Joyce into the middle of the unoccupied space, and
began my incantations. Joyce howled occasionally and jumped as if
in pain, and Poorpoorgai stood in the opening left vacant nearly
white with horror, but still ready to do or die, as he had been
instructed that principally on him rested the honor of ridding
the valley of the spirit of Joyce's aunt. He was told that once
without the confines of the valley the spirit was harmless and
could not return, and all he had to do was to run hard enough to
keep ahead of her.</p>

<p>I kept my foolery going long enough to make the people uneasy
and a bit frightened and nervous; then, fearing that I might keep
it up too long, I gave the signal to Joyce.</p>

<p>With apparently a great cry of relief and joy, he gave a wild
spring upwards (I never thought the fellow could jump so high)
and bounded towards Donnareena, and clasped the startled woman in
a close and loving embrace. Dire was the consternation; some ran
screaming away, some ran to seize Joyce and release the Queen,
and some seemed to get quite stupid. The action was so sudden and
unexpected, and if you want to get the better of a savage you
must always startle him.</p>

<p>Straight and sudden as a released arrow, Poorpoorgai darted
away, looking neither to the right nor the left, bent only on
getting a good start of the spirit. I had instructed him to make
the dash when Joyce executed the big jump of release, and he
never delayed an instant.</p>

<p>I was away after him as soon as he was, and I had relied on
the confusion caused by Joyce's unexpected embrace of the Queen
to enable me to escape unharmed in the confusion. Poorpoorgai had
not been told that I was going to follow, and an occasional howl
from me lent speed to him. But I had little breath left to howl
with. Never did a sprinter make better time on a cinder track
than did we two across the valley of Allako. Soon the ascent was
in sight with the men encamped there. Now was the critical time.
Would they spear me as I passed?</p>

<p>But the agonised expression of Poorpoorgai's face, the
desperate haste with which he fled, and the strange figure
pursuing him were quite enough. They stampeded with one accord,
and Poorpoorgai and I continued our panting way alone and
unmolested.</p>

<p>What toil it was letting up that ascent! but both of us were
nerved by terror. The Papuan for fear of capture by the spirit,
and for fear that there should be somebody after us, for I dared
not look behind. Sobbing with distress, we reached the top of the
ascent, and there the Papuan fell exhausted on the ground, and I
did the same. When I had somewhat recovered my wind and the
thumping of my heart had stilled a little, I found myself
surrounded by a grateful silence, at least in my immediate
vicinity. Far down the valley I heard yells and shouting, and
once I caught a shrill cry of agony in what sounded like Joyce's
voice.</p>

<p>I glanced around at Poorpoorgai. He lay motionless in the same
position in which he had fallen, and, wondering much at his
stillness, I got up and went over to him. He was dead. That
desperate race with the fancied spirit at his heels had been too
much for him, and when he reached the top of the ascent he had
fallen dead. I was sorry for the poor fellow, but he had
faithfully done his duty as far as I was concerned.</p>

<p>Listening once more for the noises in the valley, I found that
they did not approach nearer, and I concluded that Joyce was
fastened to the torture post, and that the amusement was too good
for anybody to leave it to go in pursuit of me. I am not sure
that this was the case; perhaps the shouting might have been
joyous greetings at the wedding of Donnareena, but I'm certain
somebody was squealing as though they were being hurt.</p>

<p>However, my chief concern was centred in getting back to
civilisation; so, leaving the body of my poor friend at the head
of the ascent, where it might serve to check pursuit, I turned my
back gladly on the valley of Allako, and commenced my journey to
the coast. I suffered much on my way, but eventually reached an
outpost missionary station, and the native teachers helped me to
get in.</p>

<h2><a id="ch15"></a>15. &mdash; MRS. MAUNDERS' VISION</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, 14 Sep 1895</h3>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="first">
WHEN Maunders got married and took his wife up to the new
house he had had built on the small cattle station he owned, he
anticipated some years of happiness and steady work. The seasons
had been good, and things in their own small way were prospering
with him. Their engagement had been one of long standing, but
their affection for each other had suffered no diminution from
that fact; and Mary Maunders, herself country born and bred,
settled down, contentedly enough to the quiet but familiar
routine of domestic station life with the man of her choice.</p>

<p>Four years passed quietly and uneventfully. Their eldest
child, a little girl, was a lusty little wench of the age of
constant prattling, and Maunders himself was two or three stone
heavier at least.</p>

<p>He was sitting in the verandah one evening contentedly smoking
and wading through his last budget of newspapers, when he heard
unusual sounds of commotion inside, and the little black girl who
had been trained as nurse for the youngster, came to him with a
troubled and scared look on her face, and confusedly explained
that 'Missee Maunder' had suddenly been taken ill.</p>

<p>Rising hastily Maunders went in to see his wife. He found her
in her room with a wild and terrified look on her face, so intent
upon some awful vision of unspeakable horror that it was some
time before he could restore her even to recognition of his
presence.</p>

<p>'Oh, Dick!' she cried when he had somewhat calmed her, 'that
awful, awful face that looked in! and then the waves&mdash;they
seemed coming right in at the window, and then&mdash;they went
back again, and carried the face with them.'</p>

<p>Poor Maunders listened in astonishment at this delirious
outburst. What could it mean? His wife was always in perfect
health, and in no way given to moods or fancies; a practical,
sensible woman. He got her to go to bed, waited on her, and
watched patiently by her until she seemed to sleep. But it was a
restless, broken sleep, and, morning dawned and found him still
sitting by the bedside, for all through the long night she had
been, starting up and calling to him to keep that awful face
away, and drag her out of the reach of the angry waves that swept
around and surged up, and then fell back carrying that face of
torment with them.</p>

<p>At daylight she seemed to find rest, and late in the morning
woke apparently restored to her natural self. All she could tell
her husband was that the vision of a face&mdash;the face of a
Chinaman&mdash;had suddenly appeared to her. Not alone was it
hideous in itself, but it was blotched and loathsome with
disease, and in the dreadful eyes was an expression of most
agonised suffering. Then great white-crested waves had come
leaping around, and tossed the head about, and finally dragged it
away.</p>

<p>Poor Maunders was fairly astray. That his quiet, unimaginative
Mary should suddenly have taken to seeing visions, like a man in
the horrors, was incredible; but he soothed her to the best of
his ability, and stopped with her, and tended her all day
long.</p>

<p>That night, however, the delirium was worse than ever, and
Maunders dispatched his only stockman to the seaport town, with a
led horse to bring up the doctor as speedily as possible.</p>

<p>All through the dark hours she raved of the haunting face and
battled with the angry waves, and now, too, it was raging and
consuming thirst that tormented her.</p>

<p>'Water, water! fresh, cold water!' was her one cry, in spite
of the cool drinks her husband kept holding to her fevered lips.
Late in the afternoon the stockman and the doctor arrived on
tired-out horses. Maunders had written a description of the case,
and the doctor came prepared with sedatives. But the attack
appeared to have passed, for that night she slept naturally, and
when the doctor left she seemed quite restored.</p>

<p>For many days Maunders felt strangely uncomfortable, and
wondered greatly why this Chinese face should thus haunt his
wife's dreams. He never employed Chinese, and she had never, in
her remembrance, been frightened by one in childhood, or ever
been brought much in contact with them. Gradually the feeling
faded, and became only a disagreeable memory.</p>

<p>Work went on evenly once more, and Mrs. Maunders enjoyed her
usual health again.</p>

<p></p>

<p>THE lazy wavelets broke rhythmically on the untrodden beach.
The day was hot, calm, and hazy. The primal forest growing beyond
the fantastic and angular pandanus trees was lifeless and still.
Nature and her family were having their siesta. On the smooth
bosom of the sea, a short distance from the shore, floated some
object but partially visible above the surface; the incoming tide
was bringing it slowly nearer, for on this part of the Australian
continent there was but a slight rise and fall, and even that was
of uncertain height.</p>

<p>It was nearly sundown before the derelict touched bottom,
floated over a small inequality, and grounded. It was wreckage of
a sort. A hencoop, probably carelessly lashed, had been swept off
the deck of a steamer. But this theory would not fit, for the
coop carried a passenger, only he had been travelling, so to
speak, steerage, underneath the water. The body of a dead man lay
on the sand beneath the coop, lashed to it by two turns of a
rope. When the man died the coop had turned turtle with his
weight, and so borne its ghastly freight unseen to shore&mdash;to
a shore where it was not likely to be found for some time, for
the land there was lonely and uninhabited.</p>

<p>It was a spring tide that left it ashore, and there it lay
untouched for weeks, save by the vicious red ants and the crabs
that came at might from a patch of mangroves not far distant. In
time a wandering lot of natives came by, and examined the flotsam
cast there fry the sea. The body was shrunken and hideously
disfigured, and they let the repulsive thing lie where the
wavelets had bestowed their fatal gift to rot on.</p>

<p>A few nights afterwards two blacks were stricken down by
sickness, and when the camp was shifted they left some dead
behind. Again others sickened, and when they made back up the
range Death walked with them through the northern jungle, amidst
its close, unwholesome heat, and took toll of them, one by
one&mdash;Death, too, in hideous guise, who smote his victims
first with blindness and madness, and festering sores that made
them tear their flesh, in agony intense. And, with the grim
pursuer still always on their tracks, they wandered on and on,
until a wretched remnant reached the country about Maunders's
station, and as the quiet natives camped near the homestead were
friendly to them they camped with them, and these, too, began to
sicken and die.</p>

<p>When Maunders came home one evening he complained of having a
headache and feeling feverish. He went to bed early, but day
after day the feeling increased, until at last he took to his
bed, and once more a hurried visit to the seaport was made for
the doctor. The doctor wore a grave face when he called the sick
man's wife to one side.</p>

<p>'Your husband, I am grieved to tell you, has smallpox, and
appearances point to a most malignant type. How could he have
caught it?'</p>

<p>She had heard of the sickness amongst the natives, and told
him of it.</p>

<p>'Is he likely to have gone to the camp?'</p>

<p>'The black boy who goes out on the run with him sleeps
there.'</p>

<p>'That must have been the source of infection. It is locking
the stable door after the steed is stolen, but they must all be
hunted away, and their camp burnt. The child must be kept away
from him&mdash;and you?'</p>

<p>'I must nurse my husband,' she said resolutely.</p>

<p>The doctor looked gravely at her. 'You must,' he agreed. 'It
is only good nursing will pull him through. Will you tell the man
to get in fresh horses, and I will go back to town and bring out
what is wanted&mdash;disinfectants and lymph, for I must
vaccinate you all.'</p>

<p>So the blacks had to wander forth with their sick, and the
cleansing fire swept their camp and blazed merrily amongst their
frail bark gunyahs. But the pest had stayed its hand, and dogged
their footsteps no more. They left it sitting at the side of the
delirious white man, whose wife kept the spectre company.</p>

<p>The doctor returned and did all he could, and when he went
back sat down to prepare a paper for a medical journal on an
inexplicable and spontaneous outbreak of the worst form of
smallpox amongst a tribe of natives in North Queensland.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p class="first">
IT was before there was much restriction of Chinese
immigration, and the <i>Chowatta</i>, a tramp steamer, was coming
down the coast with 350 Coolies on board. When they left Hongkong
they had another passenger who paid no passage money. Down in the
fore-hold, roughly rigged up with tiers of bunks for the trip,
the atmosphere was close and heavy with the smell of dirt, and
oil, and opium. The dim lamps afforded but a murky light, just
sufficient to show the recumbent, half naked forms packed around
on the shelves.</p>

<p>One tossed and tumbled in incipient delirium and burning
irritation. How delicious it would be to cool himself by a plunge
in cold water, and the sick man got up and climbed up the steep,
straight ladder on to the deck. It was a rough night, and a high
sea was running, but the man with the smallpox rioting in his
system noticed it not. He was no longer on the unsteady deck of
the <i>Chowatta</i>, but standing on his sampan floating on the
still water of the Pearl River.</p>

<p>The look-out turned round as he mounted the bulwark, and as a
wave swirled up and received him, the cry of 'Man overboard!' was
wafted aft. One of the stewards was on the poop, and cut the
lashing of a hen-coop and threw it overboard to the drowning
wretch as he vanished into the blackness. The sea was too high
and the night too dark for a boat to be lowered, so the steamer
was kept on her course.</p>

<p>The plunge under the cold waves restored the sufferer to his
senses, and he battled strongly for life. As he struggled his
beating hands struck something hard; it was the hen-coop, and to
it he clung through the night of terror that followed. In the
morning he found a loose piece of rope inside the coop, which had
been empty on the trip, and had been made a receptacle for loose
articles. With his last remaining strength he tied himself on to
the coop, and then the fever fiend got him in his grasp again,
and for two days and nights he drifted, drifted, suffering a
raging hell of thirst and torture, with the salt of the sea
encrusted on his sores. At last death was kind to him, and the
coop yielded to the magnetic attraction of the land, and laid the
pestilential gift on the sand, even as the <i>Chowatta</i>
rounded the North Head with the yellow flag flying.</p>

<h2><a id="ch16"></a>16. &mdash; THE SHADOW OF A SHADOW</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, 21 Sept 1895</h3>

<p class="first">
THE moon shone brightly through the many chinks of the old
hut, in the walls of which were several gaps caused by the slabs
having fallen down. Two travellers who were camped on the hard
earthen floor for the night were suddenly aroused by a wailing
sound that seemed to pass by their resting place like the sigh of
a breeze.</p>

<p>Both raised themselves on their elbows and listened. The wail
came round once more, and as it swept by a passing gloom seemed
to glide through the hut, as though the moon's light had been
eclipsed for one brief instant...</p>

<p>The men were silent. Rising with one accord, they went to one
of the gaps and looked out, for the sound was approaching once
more. It came, it passed, and for an instant there was again a
shade of gloom, and both men afterwards swore positively to
seeing a plainly-defined shadow cross the broad path of
moonlight. Not a shadowless man, but a shadow without the
necessary substance to cast it.</p>

<p>The wail died down in the distance, and the men broke their
silence.</p>

<p>'Rum sort o' thing, Jim. See that shadder?'</p>

<p>'My oath I did. And did yer hear what the thing cried
out?'</p>

<p>'Sounded to me as if it was calling out, "Blind, blind."'</p>

<p>'Just what I took it to be.'</p>

<p>'Blame these old huts,' said the first speaker, as they
returned to their blankets. 'A fellow never knows what he's going
to get. If they're not chockful of fleas, why, it's ghosts as
come moanin' around.'</p>

<p>When the men reached the next township, some thirty odd miles
away, they told their tale. They were two fencers who had just
finished a contract and were well known in the district as
steady, decent men, not by any means given to romancing.</p>

<p>The story seized on the superstitious feelings of the
townsmen, of which every man has a more or less sized share, the
oldest inhabitant failing to recall any tragic story connected
with the old hut and several excursions were made to test the
truth of it by daring spookhunters. They all, with one exception,
came back unsuccessful, the exception being a party of three,
who, having loaded themselves up inside and out with whisky,
returned with a richly-embroidered yarn of ghosts, devils, imps,
and hobgoblins, sufficient to satisfy the yearnings of the
wildest imagination.</p>

<p>In due time the story was forgotten, save by one man, who,
having a theory of his own, had carefully noted the date of the
vision of the shadow, and on the following year departed without
beat of drum one morning of that date.</p>

<p>Although the moon's age was slightly different, it was old
enough to give a good light, and the night was clear and still,
and the inquirer after the supernatural slept restlessly, as a
man would do who had exchanged a comfortable bed for a blanket on
a hard floor. He was awakened by footsteps, not by the mysterious
sounds heard by the former temporary occupants. A man's figure
appeared at the doorless aperture, peered in, then entered.</p>

<p>'Who's that?' demanded the first tenant.</p>

<p>'Hell!' replied a voice, somewhat cracked and shaky. 'Who's
that yourself? I'm not frightened of you, darn you.'</p>

<p>The ghost-seeker struck a match, and saw before him an old
swagman, with a white, tobacco-stained beard, having the usual
swag over one shoulder. He blinked at the sudden flare of light,
then remarked:</p>

<p>'Dossing here, old man? What brought you out here? Don't look
as though you were in the bluey line.'</p>

<p>'No; I came here to find out if this hut's haunted as they say
it is.'</p>

<p>'Yes, that blessed yarn got in the papers, and as I was coming
around this way, I thought I'd just go out of my road a bit to
have a look myself; so I'll keep you company.'</p>

<p>And he threw his swag on the ground. At that moment a wail of
downright agony, a cry of 'Blind! blind!' rang through the forest
without, startling both the men in the hut.</p>

<p>On it came, and with it the gruesome darkening of the
moonlight. The ghost-seeker had not recovered himself
sufficiently to look out for the moving shadow the others averred
they had seen; but on the second approach of the ghostly voice,
now wailing loudly, as though knowing that there were listeners
to shriek its torments to, he went to the open door and stepped
out. There was no doubt of it&mdash;a shadow did cross the open
space in front of the old hut. A shadow, it seemed to the
watcher's excited fancy, like that of a man, stumbling along,
holding both hands to his eyes.</p>

<p>He waited for the third repetition, and just as the weird
shadow became visible he felt himself thrust on one side, and the
old sundowner pushed past him, saying, 'He's come for me. I must
go after him, and see what came of him.'</p>

<p>He went on and followed the invisible presence, and the
ghost-seeker felt himself constrained to follow too and see the
end. On through the silent forest they went, the viewless leader,
the muttering old man, and the entranced spectator. On, on, a
zig-zag course they kept, until at last they stopped.</p>

<p>The old man looked about still talking to himself, saying:</p>

<p>'He must'a bin about here, must'a bin here as he died.'</p>

<p>The supernatural voice had ceased, and presently the old man
squatted down on the ground, with his back against a tree, and
the other stooped over him and urged him to get up and
return.</p>

<p>'I'm a-going to stop here,' he replied. 'Come daylight, p'raps
I'll find him.'</p>

<p>This was all that could be got out of him.</p>

<p>Suddenly the other asked, 'What do you know about this?'</p>

<p>'Know about it? Why, I knows all about it. Just you listen and
I'll tell yon. You can't see in the dark, but I'm a boko'
(one-eyed) 'and it was Bill Simmons as made me so. It was nigh
upon thirty years ago, and I could make good wages anywhere, and
one night we was having a bit of a jamboree, and Bill was there,
and he was one of the nastiest-tempered fellows in his drink as
ever you came across. Bill got on to me, and presently he got my
monkey up, and I gives him the lie straight out.</p>

<p>'"Say that again," he shouts; "call me a blooming liar again,
and I'll split y'r skull open."</p>

<p>'Of course, I ups and calls him no end of a thundering liar,
and what does the cur do but let drive at me with one of them
big, heavy tumblers. It caught me fair in the eye, and smashed
all to bits, and a piece of it cut right into my eyeball.</p>

<p>'The other fellows bandaged me up, and took me to the doctor,
and he said I must go to the hospital; and they took me there.
Some of 'em went for Bill, but he never seemed sorry; said it
served me jolly well right for calling such names, and he'd never
given any provocation, and paid out a lot of slack of that kind.
I had to stop weeks in the hospital, and while I was there he
cleared out of the district: and you bet he didn't give any
address where to find him. When I came out, t'other eye was a bit
bandy&mdash;doctor says as how it was for sympathy. Queer sort of
sympathy, it seemed to me.</p>

<p>'Well, all my bad luck set in then. First of all, a young
woman as was going to marry me went back on me&mdash;says as how
she never could abide a man with one eye; didn't seem natural
like. Beside, that dead eye of mine would give her the
jim-jams&mdash;always reminded her of an old horse her father had
who took fright at some washing hanging out and smashed the cart.
I told her as how I didn't intend to take fright at no washing;
but she wouldn't have it at any price, and I got left. A few of
the people who knew what a good workman I had been gave me an odd
job, but it was poor truck, and gradually I had to drift about,
travelling, getting anything I could do. So years went on, and I
never clapped my one eye on Bill Simmons, until one blazing hot
day I come to that old hut where you was camped. It was sound
enough then, and there was a shepherd there with a flock of
sheep. But there was no sheep about when I came there&mdash;only
a man with his eyes tied up lying groaning on the bunk, and my
colonial! if it wasn't Bill Simmons, blind as a bat with sandy
blight. I knowed him by his snarly voice, with which he cussed me
for letting the light in.</p>

<p>'"I say, damn you, whoever you are," he said, "will you go
into the head station and tell 'em as I'm stone blind with the
sandy, and 'the sheep's all over the country, and they must send
out and get 'em together 'fore the dogs get among 'em?"</p>

<p>'"No, I'm hanged if I will," says I. "My name's Jim Donnelly,
who you made a boko of years ago with chucking a glass at him,
and you just about ruined me, you cur."</p>

<p>'"Jim Donnelly, are you?" he said. "Yes, I am, and you can
just lie on your bunk and swear until somebody comes out from the
station. If you wasn't as you are I'd take it out of your
hide."</p>

<p>'He lay quiet for a bit; then he said: '"I'm sorry, Jim
Donnelly," in a humble kind of voice, and I thought he was going
to cry small; but he burst out as savage as a meat-axe, "as I
didn't knock both of your cussed, squinting eyes out when I was
at it!"</p>

<p>'This got my hair off at once. "You'll repent those words,
Bill," I says.</p>

<p>'"I repent 'em! When I get right I'll follow you up and just
wallop the soul out of your carcass."</p>

<p>'Well, he kept on raving and abusing of me, and I got madder
and madder as I thought of all the years of my life wasted
through that wretch lying there blaspheming at me; but I kept
cool. I cooked myself a feed of the best in the hut. How he did
swear when he heard me opening his pickles and jam.</p>

<p>'When I'd finished, I says, 'Now, Bill Simmons, you want
bringing down off your perch a bit&mdash;a peg lower will suit
you,' so I went over to him and just took the bandage off his
eyes. What a scream he gave, just like the way that ghost
shrieked.</p>

<p>'"You've blinded me," he cried, putting his hands up to his
eyes; but there was a. devil in me, and I only laughed at him. I
took all the things out of the hut, as I thought he could find
and make fresh bandages of, and emptied all the water away; then
I went and sat down on the bundle and smoked his tobacco until
sundown.</p>

<p>"He'd stopped raving after a bit, and when it was dark I heard
him calling in a very pitiful voice 'Jim Donnelly! Jim! for the
Lord's sake bring me a little water to wash my eyes, the lids is
all glued together."</p>

<p>I would not answer him, though I felt sorry, so after a while
he fell to cursing me agin, and presently he got up and I heard
him groping his blind way out. He'd got his boots off, and was
feeling for the track to the waterhole with his naked feet. He
passed close to me, but I made never a move, although I was
beginning to think better of it, and making up my mind that I
would doctor his eyes up again and leave him.</p>

<p>'"Blast you, Jim Donnelly," he kept saying as he stumbled
along. "May a blind shadder haunt you all your days."</p>

<p>By and bye he gets off the track, and then he comes to grief
agin a stump, and gets so outrageous mad over this that he
muddled himself up together, and finally got on a sheep track and
started to follow that I calls out to I him as he's wrong, but he
was so busy swearing that he didn't hear me, so after letting him
go on a bit I started after him meaning to bring him back, but
being boko of one eye and not seeing well out of the other, I
come to grief myself over a stump, and bringing my head agin a
tree, and lay there stunned like for a bit. When I picked myself
up Bill Simmons was nowhere in sight and I never set eyes on him
again, no more did anybody else, although I looked high and low.
He must have lost himself altogether, and wandered in the blazing
sun next day till he died of thirst, and being without a hat.</p>

<p>'I heard of this yer yarn about, them fencer chaps seeing a
shadder at this hut as called out it was blind, so I thought I'd
just check up to see if Bill had been found; that's to say his
bones or whatever left of him. Now, as it's pretty well daylight,
we'll have a look round for 'em, they're dead sure to be about
here somewheres.'</p>

<p>The two looked for the bones of Bill without success, until
the sun got high, then the ghost seeker tried to induce Donnelly
to return to the hut, but without avail. The old fellow announced
his intention of staying there until he found Bill's bones or
died there.</p>

<p>When the ghost seeker got back to the township, and told of
the success of his adventure he became a temporary hero, much to
the jealousy of the oldest identity, who now professed to have
remembered all about the mysterious disappearance of Bill
Simmons, and predicted that the dead body of Donnelly would be
found beside the bones of the lost man.</p>

<p>It wasn't, however, for when some curious people went out they
found neither the old sundowner nor the swag he had left in the
hut; nor has the wailing shadow ever been heard again, nor the
bones of the bad-tempered Bill Simmons found.</p>

<h2><a id="ch17"></a>17. &mdash; THE COMMUNICATIVE ORGAN GRINDER</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, 28 Sep 1895</h3>

<p class="first">
MY mate and I were camped out west, about as far out as men
had got in those days, and we had decided to turn back the next
morning. I was awakened from a sound sleep by my companion
Nickoll suddenly starting up and exclaiming 'Did you hear that?'
I listened, but could not hear a sound, and said so.</p>

<p>'Keep still,' he replied, 'I want to make sure that it is only
my fancy.'</p>

<p>I listened silently, and presently, to my astonishment, heard
something like a cracked concertina, or a crazy old barrel-organ,
grinding out a wheezy tune.</p>

<p>'By Jove, there must be somebody camped near here,' I
exclaimed.</p>

<p>'Not at all,' returned Nickoll quietly, 'that organ's ground
by no mortal hands.'</p>

<p>'I thought they, went in for harps up there,' I answered.</p>

<p>'What tune was it trying to play?' he asked; ignoring my
flippancy.</p>

<p>'It sounded like an attempt at "When Other Lips and Other
Hearts..."'</p>

<p>'Ah, then its right enough. I shall never get in again.'</p>

<p>'Tommyrot! Men get their cranks into their heads, and then
they work it out themselves. It was a queer noise certainly, but
I've no doubt it can be explained away in the morning.'</p>

<p>'I can explain it. It's my death warning.'</p>

<p>'Well, I know nothing about that, but you won't make me
believe that there's a spectral old organ grinder knocking about
out here.'</p>

<p>'Are you sleepy?'</p>

<p>'No.'</p>

<p>'Then I'll tell you the yarn. I was in London at the time, and
had overworked myself. I was lodging in one of the suburbs, and
used to work in my room. I was translating at the time, and the
work was as hard as the pay was poor. I was terribly worried by
an old organ grinder, who used to come daily and strum his
wretched old instrument underneath my window. "When Other Lips"
is not an especially joyful air at any time, but when it is
ground over and over again by a cracked organ the agony is
excruciating. The fellow did not exactly stand beneath my window,
but at the house next door to me, and the people used to
encourage him by throwing him down coppers wrapped in paper.</p>

<p>'I tried my best to get rid of him. I once threw down a packet
of chocolate creams with tartar emetic in them, and, by Jove, I
was afraid I had poisoned him for good, for he was absent for two
whole days. I tried him with copper coins made hot, and he burnt
his ringers and swore, but came back. I threw him a bad shilling,
in the hope that he'd try to pass it; but I suppose he mistrusted
me, for nothing came of it. Then I took to sending in next door
asking them out of charity to me to refrain from their daily
dole.</p>

<p>'They were French people lodging there, and they affected to
misunderstand my letter, for I received a reply written in what
might be called Franco-English, stating "that they fully
comprehended my noble sympathy on behalf of their distressed
countryman, and if I sent in any contributions they would gladly
add them to their small mite."</p>

<p>'This was maddening. I wrote them a letter in excellent
French; but it was of no avail. You know how little things worry
and distress a man when he is off the track, and what between
insomnia and work, the persecution of this old grinder had become
a monomania with me. Of course, I had told the police about the
nuisance, and once or twice the men on the beat moved him on; but
they did it in a perfunctory manner, and I feel pretty sore now
that they were tipped by the people next door. How I finished my
work I don't know, but I did; but still I would be kept awake
with this atrocious "When Other Lips" ringing in my ears, I
fancy, until daylight.</p>

<p>'There was a mystery about it, and I felt I should go mad if I
did not solve it I was talking one day to a friend of mine who
did some confidential clerical work in the police department. He
noticed my nervous manner, and I told him the cause. He seemed
somewhat struck by my narrative, and I did not see him for a day
or two; then I received a note asking me to call and see him. I
found two strangers with him, whose occupations were
unmistakable. One was a police inspector, the other a French
detective. I was told, politely enough, that my story fitted in
with some secret correspondence that had been going on lately
between the London and Paris heads of the police, and would I
describe the man and the occupants of the next house, or lodgers,
there.</p>

<p>'I could not describe them, for I had never seen them. If they
went out at all it was at night The Frenchman smiled. As for the
organ grinder, I gave an accurate description of the fiend, and
his habits and customs.</p>

<p>'"Has he lost two fingers on his left hand?"</p>

<p>'A thought struck me. When I threw Mm the hot coins he had
picked them up with his right hand and burnt it; then he turned
the handle with his left, and I noticed something wrong with it.
Now it struck me that it was he had lost two fingers. I told that
to them.</p>

<p>'"We shall want your assistance, but you need not show in the
matter," said the police inspector, and I agreed to what was
explained to me.</p>

<p>'Now, I own I could not at another time have given a poor
devil away, but at this time my brain was in a state of abnormal
irritation, and I certainly was not responsible for my actions as
regards the organ grinder.</p>

<p>'To make a long story short, the organ grinder was a desperate
communist escaped from New Caledonia. The French detective had an
extradition warrant for him; but he had heard since coming to
London that fade ex-communist was in communication with others
who were badly wanted, and he was anxious to bag the whole.
Through my occupation of the neighboring house the capture was
effected neatly. And cleverly. Of course, the papers thrown down
wrapped round the money contained cipher messages, and my friend
the organ grinder was caught red-handed picking one up, which was
just what the French detective aimed at doing. It afforded the
link in the chain connecting him with the men in the other house,
who were easily taken.'</p>

<p>Nickoll ceased and gazed dreamily into the fire which, for
company's sake, we had made to burn up.</p>

<p>'Go ahead,' I said, 'that's not the end.'</p>

<p>'No; the bearing lies in the postscript. Before starting with
his extradited prisoners, the French official paid me a
visit.</p>

<p>'"See here," he said, "you have done me a good turn. This
quick and complete capture means much for me, and I will try and
repay it. When we handcuffed that organ grinder I saw him cast a
villainous look up at your window. Believe me, my friend, he
knows you, and guesses you had a hand in it although your name
was never mentioned. Now I know the scoundrel, and a bigger
devil's name does not figure in our list. If ever he gets free
again he'll put a knife in you, believe me. He has no special
enmity against me. He recognises that it was my business. But you
were an outsider. He will go out to Noumea for life, and will be
kept at it pretty hard; but who knows what may happen? If he
escapes a second time I will warn you, no matter where you are,
it is as well to be on your guard. It is the least I can do, and
I am sure to hear of it Now, can you give me a permanent address
which will always find you?"</p>

<p>'I reflected. I had almost made up my mind to return to
Australia, which I had foolishly quitted in search of better
fortune at the Cape, some years before. I mode it up on the spot,
and gave him a permanent address with a friend resident in
Sydney.</p>

<p>'"Good," he said, as he took it down. "I will cable you. What
is a pound or two to me compared with what you have done?"</p>

<p>'"By the way," he said, halting at the door. "Our dear friend
made this remark: 'Tell that damned Englishman that he shall hear
that tune I tormented him with so, just before he dies. He has
sent me back to hell, and if I die first I'll come and play it to
him just before he goes there.' Bah! for all that hell business.
But the dog meant something."</p>

<p>And the detective left.</p>

<p>'And is that the end?'</p>

<p>'That is the end of one chapter of my story so far. You will
probably see the epilogue.'</p>

<p>I did not answer, and soon fell asleep.</p>

<p>The next morning, while Nickoll was after the horses, I
searched round about for any clue to the strange noise, but found
none. We started home, and arrived there without any mishap.</p>

<p>Then Nickoll and I drifted apart. Six months afterwards we met
in Sydney. Naturally, after the manner of bushmen, we adjourned
somewhere for a drink and a yarn.</p>

<p>'Well, old man,' I said. 'I'm heartily glad to see you again,
for, by all the rules of the game, you ought to be a corpse now.
You remember the ghostly organ grinder out west?'</p>

<p>'Don't!' he replied, and turned, I thought, a little pale.
'That story is not finished even yet. After we parted I came into
a little money, and had to come down here to settle the business.
What do you think I found awaiting me amongst other letters? A
cablegram from the French detective stating that our mutual
friend had again effected his escape. From information I have
subsequently gained it was on the same hour that we heard the
infernal tune out there. Naturally, I kept a lookout, and also
found that the Sydney police had received notice from Noumea, and
a full description of the man.</p>

<p>'One day, turning a corner, I came right against him. He was
well got up, but the recognition was mutual and instantaneous. I
expected an attack, and was on my guard for a stab; but he saw
that I was a bigger man, and prepared. Muttering a curse, he
turned back. His chance had not arrived. At that moment a
sergeant of police turned the corner, the very man, luckily, from
whom I had been making inquiries concerning this escapee.</p>

<p>'"There's your man," I said, pointing to him. "Quick!"</p>

<p>'"By God, it is!" he answered, and sprang forward. I heard his
whistle sound, and there was a scuffle, and the usual crowd
closed in. I stood where I was. Presently the ring parted, and I
saw my friend led away in handcuffs for the second time. The
sergeant's hand was bleeding, and the other policeman had a knife
in his hand. That is the end of another chapter.'</p>

<p></p>

<p>THIS happened three years ago. I know that Nickoll is well,
but have not met him since.</p>

<h2><a id="ch18"></a>18. &mdash; AN UNQUIET CORPSE</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, 5 Oct 1895</h2>

<p class="first">
'SOU-WEST you'll pick up the road from Watervale,' said the
man in charge of the repairing party on the overland telegraph
line, addressing two travellers with led pack horses; 'but it's
almighty rough across there, and I'd advise you to go back to
Watervale, and follow the road, You'll find it shorter in the
end.'</p>

<p>'Don't like turning back,' said one of the men, 'and our
horses are pretty fresh, and shod.'</p>

<p>'Oh, it's not stones so much as sand ridges&mdash;white sand
and pine scrub. However, you'd better turn out here, and start
to-morrow morning, for there's only one place where you can
reckon on water, and that's a creek about half way.'</p>

<p>'What came of the old loony who was knocking about here six
months ago?' said one of the line-men, addressing the crowd in
general as they sat eating their meal that evening.</p>

<p>'Never heard,' returned another; 'but there was some yarn
about his tracks having been seen going out the way you fellows
are going; and another yarn about his horses having turned up at
Watervale, but I never heard the rights of it.'</p>

<p>Next morning the two men started, and towards sundown came to
the creek they had been told about. It was a desolate looking
spot enough; a bare sandy creek, where a trickle of water down
the centre of the bed, cut its way between white sand ridges,
whereon gaunt angular pine trees threw their naked arms about.
There was a little grass on the edge of the bank, and the
travellers soon turned their tired horses out for it had been,
heavy travelling all day.</p>

<p>'What's that half-way up the ridge there, Jack?' said one of
them.</p>

<p>'Blessed if at does not look like a rag of an old tent. Let's
go up and see.'</p>

<p>It was the tattered rags of an old tent which the wind had
blown into ribbons, and the late owner sat with his back to a
tree as if complacently, contemplating the wreck of his property.
He had been dead some months, and the summer heat had dried him
to a mummy.</p>

<p>'What the devil's that round his neck?' said Alf to his mate,
as they stood and surveyed the relic.</p>

<p>They went forward and found a surcingle round the neck of the
corpse, like a running noose, the end of the surcingle having
been passed through the buckle and pulled nearly taut.</p>

<p>'Looks as if he'd been hanged and then let down again,' said
Jack, glancing up the tree.</p>

<p>There was a suspicious bough handily situated just overhead.
They found a pack-saddle and a riding saddle in the camp, and a
few of the rest of the impedimenta a man generally carries in
outside country; but the dogs had been at work, and the leather
had been damaged by the weather.</p>

<p>'I suppose it's the old loony the men spoke of, whoever he
was. I reckon we had better bury him in the morning; it's too
late to-night' said Jack.</p>

<p>'What on earth did he want to come and die here for?' grumbled
Alf, who seemed to look upon it rather in the light of a personal
affront.</p>

<p>'I suppose he couldn't pick and choose his own place, could
he?' retorted Jack. 'Although for the matter of that I don't see
what he had to die of about here. It's not a cheerful spot
certainly, but there's no occasion for a man to die on that
account.</p>

<p>The men cooked and ate their meal, and soon were fast
asleep.</p>

<p>Jack woke up in the middle of the night and looked around, and
listened to hear which way the horses were making. It, was bright
moonlight and if the place looked cheerless by day, it looked far
more so at night The white bare sand and the sombre trees, with
their black shadows, did not combine to make up a lively picture.
A wind was wailing too, and made a melancholy sound, amongst the
pine boughs. Jack's attention was drawn by the flapping of the
old tent on the ridge. He looked that way, started, jumped up,
and stared with might and main. He glanced at Alf, but he was
sleeping soundly. What he thought he saw was a dark figure
leaping and waving its arms about under the tree where the corpse
lay.</p>

<p>'Must be a moving bough,' muttered Jack. 'Any way, I'll go and
see without waking Alf.'</p>

<p>Buckling on his belt and revolver, he went noiselessly to the
spot and' came on to a strange sight. The corpse had got up, and
was indulging in strange and unbecoming antics&mdash;springing in
the air; and trying to throw the end of the surcingle that was
round its neck over the branch overhead.</p>

<p>At last it gave up, and moaned so miserably that Jack felt
sorry for it; he was a soft-hearted fellow.</p>

<p>'What's the matter, old man?' he said.</p>

<p>'Matter!' groaned the corpse. 'Why I've got to roost out here
on this ridge without any rest until I've hanged myself.'</p>

<p>'What do you want to hang yourself for? I should have thought
you had no need to do that.' (Jack told me this yarn himself, and
said he felt as cool as a cucumber all through the
interview.)</p>

<p>'You don't understand,' returned the corpse. 'All our family
have hanged themselves. My father, my grandfather, and my uncle
Bill. My cousin Ned was hanged by the hangman. Now, my uncle Bill
was a cantankerous old curmudgeon, who always disliked me, and
before he did it he wrote a letter about his property, and in it
he said, "I mistrust my nephew Frank (that's me); when the time
comes he'll go back on his family, see if he don't."</p>

<p>'And then the old maligner went and did it.</p>

<p>'Now, I felt very hurt about this, and it rather preyed upon
me, so one day I made an attempt to prove old uncle Bill a liar,
but I was cut down and reprimanded by a magistrate, and
altogether made a mess of it. I tried another time; same result.
Same result again a third time, and I was getting about tired of
it. Then I made up my mind to come out away back somewhere where
a man could have a fair show. I got a hankering after the
telegraph posts, but I didn't think it quite fair, because those
chaps on the line were very sociable, so I came out here, and,
would you believe it that very day I started I was taken bad with
the fever.</p>

<p>'You know what the fever is, how it takes it out of a man's
knees and neck and backbone, and everything else. How I managed
to get here, I don't know; but somehow I did, and here I had to
camp. I was bad, and a bit off my head for a few days, and when I
was able to get about I found that my horses had come to the
conclusion that it was a God-forgotten kind of place, and had
cleared out Then it struck me that now was my chance. Here was I,
all alone, no one to cut me down; I'd show Uncle Bill if I was
going to go back on the family. And then, then&mdash;' (Here the
corpse yelled in agony.)</p>

<p>'I was too weak, too gone in the joints, to throw that blessed
surcingle over the branch! I tried, and tried, and tried, and at
last one day I made a sort of a cast of it and half choked
myself, and being so weak I fell down under the tree, and
died.'</p>

<p>The corpse was silent for awhile.</p>

<p>'Ever since then,' went on the defunct, 'I've been tormented
by old Uncle Bill coming and jeering at me, and night after night
I've tried to do it properly and failed, and never a soul has
come to this day to help me. Now,' went on the corpse, in a
coaxing tone, 'would you mind giving me a hand. Just a pull on
the surcingle, you know; throw it over the limb first.'</p>

<p>Jack took up the surcingle and considered. There could be no
harm in hanging a dead man who wanted it so badly. The corpse
took up his position, and he threw the surcingle over the limb,
but it fell too short for him to grasp.</p>

<p>'Wait a minute,' he said, 'I will go and get one of our's and
buckle on.'</p>

<p>Jack went to the camp, and got a surcingle. Alf was still
snoring, and the dead man was awaiting him with a heavenly smile
of expectation on his face.</p>

<p>'Now, then,' said Jack, 'say when you're ready.'</p>

<p>'Ready!' cried the corpse.</p>

<p>'Up you go,' said Jack, and half way up to the limb he went.
Jack took a turn and a couple of half-hitches round a handy
sapling, then, saying 'Good-night' went back to his camp, and
slept soundly until morning.</p>

<p></p>

<p>THE two travellers got up at daylight. Alf went after the
horses, which had gone down the creek in a different direction.
Jack got breakfast ready, and glanced at the place of his
midnight adventure, but there was nothing hanging on the tree, so
he came to the conclusion that it was a nightmare, and made up
his mind to say nothing about it. Presently Alf returned with the
horses, and they had breakfast.</p>

<p>'Suppose we'd better go and bury that chap,' growled Alf.
'Good job it's soft digging.'</p>

<p>Jack assented, and they started. Arrived at the spot Alf
looked round and started.</p>

<p>No wonder! The body lay under the limb, the head a little
distance off, and over the branch dangled the empty noose.
Evidently the defunct's neck had not stood the strain. Jack kept
silence; then Alf strode over to where the second surcingle was
fastened to the sapling, and examined it.</p>

<p>'Blowed if he didn't come down and get my surcingle,' he
muttered as he recognised his initials marked on it. He unbuckled
it and marched off, saying to Jack as he did so, 'Look here, if
that fellow could get up last night and hang himself with my
surcingle, he can just bury himself as well.'</p>

<h2><a id="ch19"></a>19. &mdash; ROSITA'S CURSE</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, 12 Oct 1895</h3>

<p class="first">
IT was a hot, tropical night, and a soft, drizzling rain was
falling. The sea was calm, with a long, lazy swell, and in the
north-west there was a constant mutter of thunder, with an
incessant gleam of distant lightning. There was no inducement to
stop on deck, and very little to go below. The steamer was built
more for cargo than passenger traffic, and, in point of fact,
there were only two passengers on board&mdash;myself and a
Portuguese officer from Goa on his way to Macau.</p>

<p>He was a heavy swell, and no wonder, for his name was Dona
Miguel Francisco de Paula da Rocha, and he came on board at
Bombay in a meteor-like uniform that made one wink to look at
him. However, he had the sense to put on Christian-like garments
when we got to sea, and, apart from the little foibles natural to
his country, turned out to be a decent enough fellow. Moreover,
he had been so long in the East that he could speak tolerable
English, and, all things considered, we got on pretty well.</p>

<p>We were between Singapore and Hongkong on the particular night
I speak of, and so far had made a very fair passage. I knocked my
pipe out at last and went below. The lowered lights of a couple
of lamps illuminated the saloon but dimly, and I stumbled over
the recumbent forms of the sleeping cabin boys, and used some
strong language.</p>

<p>'What is the matter?' asked the Dom, as I passed the open door
of his cabin, and we exchanged a few remarks on the closeness of
the night and the difficulty of getting any sleep. I took a
pillow, and went to lie down, on one of the transoms, and lay
there for some time, while the churn of the screw and the beat of
the pistons wound themselves up in a sort of a rhyme in my brain
and I dozed off.</p>

<p>Presently I awoke, and turning restlessly on to my side, saw
that the opposite transom was occupied.</p>

<p>'The Dam must have found his cabin too close, like myself,' I
thought, and then I saw that it was not the Dom, but a stranger.
I got up, and looked, curiously across at my silent companion. He
was dressed in a blue tunic, his black hair was cut short, and he
had either bandages or a white handkerchief bound around the
lower part of his face. We had been too long at sea for the man
to be a stowaway or a deserter from Goa. I thought I would rouse
up one of the boys and draw attention to the strange presence;
but Dom Miguel heard me moving, and came to the door of his
cabin.</p>

<p>'Who's that fellow asleep on the transom?' I asked. He peered,
across the table, and then gave a start, and took two or three
steps forward. He clutched my arm, and as he gazed his grasp grew
positively painful.</p>

<p>'Pedro!' he cried at last, and at the exclamation the figure
on the transom rose and looked back at him. Such a face of horror
was turned towards us that I don't wonder that the Dom fell down
in a faint, with a yell of terror. I know I shouldn't like to
have a living corpse look at me so vindictively.</p>

<p>I saved the Dom from a heavy fall, and as I was bending over
him the purser came out, and asked what the row was about I told
him I didn't know, but that a stranger was camped on one of the
transoms, and Dom Miguel had recognised him and got a fright.</p>

<p>'There's no one on the transom, man,' said the purser, and
turned the nearest lamp up. There was no one there.</p>

<p>'He must nave slipped away,' I said. 'Help me to get Dom
Miguel back to his cabin.'</p>

<p>We roused him somewhat and did so, and just at that moment
there was a sharp order and a bustle on deck. Then a roar swept
up, and the steamer heeled over, and the sound went hurtling to
leeward. The purser and I were both nearly capsized, but Miguel
was safe in his bunk. As we were going out to see what all the
uproar was about he opened his eyes, and I saw that he wanted to
speak to me. I held on, for we had a good list, and stooping down
heard him ask if 'it had gone.' I told him 'the man was gone,'
and went out to the cabin, where the purser was hunting the boys
round, shutting portholes and making all fast.</p>

<p>We had been struck by the outer edge of a typhoon; the sea,
was getting up rapidly, and by morning we were steaming head to
wind, playing seesaw beautifully.</p>

<p>Dom Miguel was up next morning, although, as a rule, he was
only a fair weather sailor, but he said nothing about the night's
work, only expressed some anxiety to know our exact position.</p>

<p>The skipper would not leave the bridge, but the chief officer
was down for a short spell, and gave him the desired information.
He turned more sallow than ever, and shortly after spent to his
cabin. We had an ineffective search after the strange man, and I
had to stand some chaff about it, but there was no mistake about
the fright the Dom got.</p>

<p>About twelve he sent for me, and I went into his cabin to see
him. His first question was as to our position. I told him that
we were in much the same place, and would be until the wind fell,
as we were only keeping her head to wind and sea. He groaned, and
suddenly sat up in his bunk.</p>

<p>'And we shall stop here,' he cried, vehemently. 'Why did I
ever come back to this cursed coast? Listen to me, you have time
before tiffin. That man you saw last night lies drowned at the
bottom of this sea. He went down with a shot at his heels years
ago.</p>

<p>'I was around here when I was little more than a boy&mdash;a
smooth-faced cadet&mdash;' and here he stroked his long moustache
fondly. 'I came from Goa in a gunboat commanded by my uncle, a Da
Rocha. He was a man of violent temper, and self-willed to a
degree, which had kept him back in his professsion, or he would
have been given something better than a paltry little gunboat,
but there were so many stories of his cruelty whispered about
that even his influential friends could not advance him. This
made his temper worse, and the men on the gunboat could not call
their souls their own. I was in charge of a small party of ten
soldiers and their wives, going round to Macau, to be stationed
there for some time.</p>

<p>'One of the soldiers&mdash;Pedro, the man you saw last
night&mdash;had married a very beautiful girl. I don't know of
what descent she was, but she was a half-breed of some sort. She
had eyes like midnight, and a form as curved and rounded as a
Greek statue's. My uncle had his wicked eye on her, but she
scorned and avoided him. Then poor Pedro came in for it. Now, I
might have asserted myself a little, but you see how young I was,
and I could not go against my uncle, as I was under his command
on board; so, between one pretext and another, poor Pedro soon
found himself in irons below.</p>

<p>'But his wife never left him, and there was not a man on board
could have made her, for she had the eyes of a wild beast when
roused, and a knife as sharp as its claw.</p>

<p>'Now, Pedro was brought up on deck for an airing one day, and
a squall struck us as he was stumbling up and down with the aid
of his wife, and put the vessel right over, like Last night.
Pedro fell heavily, and broke his jaw against some iron work.</p>

<p>'The surgeon then plucked up enough spirit to interfere, and
insisted that the man's irons should be taken off, and tie should
be put in hospital. This was done, and the poor fellow was a
little better off. Now, for what happened I can only account by
supposing that my uncle's temper and his passion for this girl
had so Increased that he was not responsible for what he did.
Rosita tended her injured husband, and one morning leaving him
sleeping she went away to rest herself. My uncle and the surgeon
went below, and what passed between them I do not know, but that
surgeon was as guilty as my wretched uncle. All I know is this,
that when I came on deck shortly afterwards Pedro was on deck,
apparently a corpse, and the sailmaker busy stitching canvas
round him.</p>

<p>'The captain said something to his officers about a catching
disease; the body was laid on a hatch, the engines stopped, the
hatch tilted, and poor Pedro went overboard.</p>

<p>'Almost before the noise of the plunge died away his wife was
on deck, knife in hand. The stoppage of the engines had aroused
her.</p>

<p>'"Devils!" she said, glaring round, "what have you done with
my husband?"</p>

<p>'"Your husband, Rosita, died suddenly, and it was necessary
for the safety of the crew that he should be buried
immediately."</p>

<p>'So spoke the surgeon. She gave him one look of awful contempt
then turned to the captain.</p>

<p>'"Liar and murderer," she cried, with blazing, eyes. "He was
well, and better when I left him. You have killed him and thrown
him overboard; but you will never gain your end, for I will
follow him." With knife uplifted for whoever should attempt to
stay her she sprang on to the bulwark, and stood there holding on
by a stay, while she cursed us all. Such a curse! It rings in my
ears yet. It was levelled at everyone on the ship, and the ship
itself. Suddenly, while we all listened awestruck, a flash of
light gleamed past me, and my uncle fell; next moment she sprang
into the sea. Her last act had been to hurl her knife with
unerring aim straight into the captain's heart.'</p>

<p>Dom Miguel ceased speaking for a while.</p>

<p>'Now, I will tell you the great crime. That poor man was alive
when he was cast overboard. He had been drugged. I saw him open
his eyes before the canvas was sewn over his face.'</p>

<p>I was silent after this strange narration. What could I say
after what I had seen the night before? Dom Miguel went
on&mdash;</p>

<p>'We reached Macau an safety, and the gunboat returned in
charge of the first lieutenant. She was never heard of again.
Sickness carried off every one of the soldiers and their families
before the year was out, and I am the sole survivor. I believe we
are now in the same place, and last night Pedro came up from his
ocean grave to tell me to be ready. I am ready. I want you to see
to my effects, and deliver them and these letters to the
Portuguese Consul at Hongkong. Now, good-bye.'</p>

<p>I was quite at a loss for anything to say. I took the letters,
promised compliance with his wishes, and left him.</p>

<p>The captain managed to get down to tiffin, and to our surprise
Dom Miguel in full uniform, ablaze with orders and ribands, put
in an appearance. The captain, a taciturn man, stared, but said
nothing. There was too much ducking and diving to stay long at
table, and when we rose I went up on the bridge with the
captain.</p>

<p>It was wild chaos all around, about as tempestuous a sea as I
ever saw. We were shipping seas over the bows with nearly every
plunge, and there seemed no sign of the turmoil of wind and water
abating. Presently we saw Dom Miguel come put and ascend the
poop. The captain made some remark about the figure he cut in his
gay uniform on that reeling deck, when the quartermaster let her
fall off; a huge sea raced along our side, just curling over the
bulwarks, then seemed to spring up over the quarter and shatter
itself on the poop. As the steamer dived, the water rushed on to
the main deck in two cataracts adown the companion ladders, but
Dom Miguel was gone; nor in that tumultuous sea could we catch
one glimpse of him.</p>

<p>At sundown the typhoon had blown itself out.</p>

<h2><a id="ch20"></a>20. &mdash; PROFESSOR DODO'S EXPERIMENT</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, 2 Nov 1895</h3>

<p class="first">
I SUPPOSE no man ever had a more devoted admirer than
Professor Dodo had in myself. I metaphorically sat at his feet
and drank in learning through my ears. He was a very taking man,
absorbed in scientific research; but what attracted me most was
the fact that he was a daring experimentalist.</p>

<p>At that time I was a young man, living at home with my family,
and, like most young men, apt to make a fool of myself by going
in for extremes of hero-worship. Just at that period it was
Professor Dodo.</p>

<p>For some time, however, he had been somewhat more reticent and
uncommunicative than usual. Whatever it was that he was engaged
on, he did not invite me to share his confidence. The professor,
however, had one weakness, common, as I know now, to the greatest
of men, but as I then thought a weakness far beneath him. It was
a consuming jealousy of Dr. Panto, a man who could not possibly
aspire to rival him. Be that as it may; Panto and he were mortal
enemies.</p>

<p>One evening the professor came to our house in a wonderfully
pleasant frame of mind. I could tell at once that the experiment,
whatever it was, that he had been engaged upon, had turned out a
success. I was suffering from an attack of neuralgia at the time,
and he soon noticed it.</p>

<p>'I will send you something that will quickly relieve you,' he
said as he left, and in about half an hour's time his man came
round with a bottle of medicine and a note telling me how to use
it. True enough, it relieved my pain speedily, and I slept
soundly throughout the night. In fact, next morning I felt
stronger and more active than I had done for a long time. I went
to see the professor, and on his inquiring after my health I told
him how I felt.</p>

<p>'You've run down a bit, my boy,' he said, 'I am not a
professional M.D., but still I can give you something that will
make a new man of you.' Afterwards I understood the fiendish
meaning of those words.</p>

<p>I thanked him cordially, and he sent me the medicine, with
instructions how to use it. Certainly it was a wonderful
invigorative, and seemed to put the most uncommon strength into
my limbs. At the same time, I did not feel up to much brain work,
and what I did was with great exertion. One evening the professor
strolled up to ask after me.</p>

<p>'I noticed that you were a little feverish to-day,' he said,
'so I have brought round a soothing draught which will give you a
sound night's rest. Take half when, you go to bed, and go early.
You will probably wake in some three hours, then take the other
half. In the morning you won't know yourself.'</p>

<p>We shook hands, and I followed his advice, and fell off to
sleep as soon as my head touched the pillow. Then I dreamt a
strange dream. I saw before me a boundless sea&mdash;a sea that
seemed to stretch further than our earthly one, as though I was
high up in the air and bad a more extended view. Gigantic
creatures of strange and awful shape swam and floated on this
great sea, and fought and devoured each other, until it all
passed from my view, and there was nothing but mud&mdash;mud
everywhere&mdash;and through, it and over it crawled horrible
reptiles of all kinds; and these, too, fought and devoured each
other. I awoke with a start of horror, and struck a light; it was
half past 12.</p>

<p>I hastily drank the remainder of the draught and went back
into bed, trusting that I would nave no more dreams of that
description. There was one strange thing which did not strike me
at the time, for I fell asleep at once, but when I got into bed,
instead of doing it in the ordinary manner, I leaped lightly on
the bed from the floor and then laid myself down.</p>

<p>At once I was in a forest so dense, so thick and high, that it
made twilight underneath. But that did not matter, for I was one
of a band of apes who sported amid the upper branches. How we
frisked and fought and swung ourselves about, and watched the
great beasts struggling in combat underneath; and pelted them
with dead limbs, and then marched away to some other part, and
there met with other apes, and battled for the new territory. Oh!
it was a mad life; until one day, chasing one of my fellows, a
branch broke with me, and I fell clear eight on to the
ground....</p>

<p>I was awake; sitting up in my bed, with my heart beating fast.
Was this the sound sleep promised me? The day had just commenced,
a summer morning, and I got out of bed, intending to dress, and
go out, for I felt I must get into the fresh air.</p>

<p>I sat down on the edge of the bed to dress, and quite
unconsciously picked up my socks with my toes instead of
my hand. I started as I did so, and looked at my foot.</p>

<p>Good God! It was not my foot It was long, narrow, and the
great toe was like a thumb. My hands! They, too, were altered. I
rushed to the glass, and at the first glimpse I turned to see who
was looking over my shoulder. No one! I was gazing at what
purported to be my own reflection, but surely that ape-like
countenance was not mine? It was, though. It was myself, and not
myself. I shuddered with disgust.</p>

<p>This, then, was the experiment he had been employed on. This
the hell-brew he had been administering to me! I grew quite calm,
for I saw the necessity for it. I would go at once to the
villain. Scarcely any one was stirring, and I could depart
unobserved. If he refused to undo his devilish work I would kill
him first and myself afterwards. I would not live like I was.</p>

<p>I dressed myself, and with some trouble got my boots on; then
I started on my errand of vengeance.</p>

<p>What a lovely morning it was, and what a miserable wretch I
felt As I crossed the park an irresistible impulse made me leap
up and, catching hold of a branch, swing myself up into a tree
and sit on a limb; then I remembered myself, and dropped to the
ground. Fortunately no one was about to witness this wild
antic.</p>

<p>I reached the professor's house just as a sleepy servant was
opening the door. Pushing past her, I went straight up to his
room, which I knew well. Evidently he expected me, for he was
awake and sitting up in bed.</p>

<p>'How do you find yourself?' he asked, sneeringly.</p>

<p>'The question is how will you find yourself directly,' I
replied.</p>

<p>'Then your visit is&mdash;'</p>

<p>'To choke the life out of you and then kill myself.'</p>

<p>'Indeed! And what good will that do? The whole of my
experiment, and its success&mdash;Its success, mark you!&mdash;is
written down and deposited in a safe place. You may kill me, but
the record remains. You may kill yourself, but your body and
skeleton remain as a proof of my success, which will stamp me the
most wonderful scientist in the world's history.'</p>

<p>'I will drown myself from a steamer.'</p>

<p>His face changed, and I saw his hand steal underneath the
pillow, but with my ape-like agility I had the revolver from his
hand, and sent it crashing through the window. Then I took him by
the throat, and shook him soundly. The madman would have shot me
for my skeleton.</p>

<p>'Now,' I said, 'will you restore me to my natural shape?'</p>

<p>'On one condition. Allow yourself to be photographed in all
the different positions I want, and then I will do it.'</p>

<p>'Never.'</p>

<p>'Remember. If you kill me, you kill the only man who can
restore your form. Reflect.'</p>

<p>'I have reflected,' I returned, as a bright thought flashed
through me. 'I am going now to Dr. Panto. I will allow him to
photograph me, and exhibit me if he likes. I will swear that you
had nothing whatever to do with it; that you are a humbug and an
impostor; and Dr. Panto shall claim the successful experiment,
and reap all the honor and glory of it. Good morning.'</p>

<p>What a howl of anguish burst from that bed!</p>

<p>'You mean it?' he yelled.</p>

<p>'Mean it! Do you suppose a man in my position sticks at
trifles?'</p>

<p>'I will do it,' he said feebly, and in a broken tone.</p>

<p>He went to his laboratory, and presently returned with certain
drugs, which he told me how to use.</p>

<p>'Now, mark me,' I said, as I left. 'Before I take these I am
going to write to Dr. Panto a detailed account of your experiment
and its success. This will be sealed up to be opened after my
death, so that should you have given me poison you will not gain
by it.'</p>

<p>'One thing,' he said humbly, 'have you any sign of a tail
coming?'</p>

<p>I withered him with a look, and left. It was still early, and
I regained my home without observation. The charm worked
backwards, and I arose a man once more.</p>

<p>Dodo died soon afterwards from sheer disappointment. But we
did not speak in the interim.</p>

<h2><a id="ch21"></a>21. &mdash; GANNON'S GHOST</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, 16 Nov 1895</h3>

<p class="first">
'GHOSTS do come back,' said Jim, indulging in the luxury of
lighting his pipe at the slush-lamp, a thing to make one
shudder.</p>

<p>'Old Gannon came back, as most people know. Old Gannon died
some years after his daughter Mary got married. You knew Mary
Gannon, of course?'</p>

<p>'No, I didn't,' I replied wearily, seeing that Jim was going
in for one of his complicated yarns, which, at any rate, might
send me to sleep.</p>

<p>'Mary Gannon was a nice girl, barring a slight cast in one eye
and a habit of coughing at meal times. She married Tom Davis, and
he was not a bad fellow, either, only he couldn't smoke without
spitting&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Oh, hang it all, shut up!' I said. 'Tell us about old
Gannon's ghost.'</p>

<p>'Old Gannon's ghost, eh? He was a terror; and the strange
thing was that there was no reason for his coming back, so
everybody thought until afterwards. He had been well and properly
buried in a nice, dry grave, and what he wanted to leave it for
no one could make out. However, the first night it happened Tom
Davis, who was living in the old man's house, which had been left
to them, went out into the verandah for his usual smoke after
tea, while Mary put the things away. They had one little boy,
about 3 years old, and he went out with his father to be out of
Mary's way&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Confound it, keep out of Mary's way yourself, and tell us
about the ghost.'</p>

<p>'Just what I'm coming to. The youngster being out there with
Tom suddenly said&mdash;"Why, there's granpa." Sure enough, when
Tom looked, there was the old man, just like life, leaning
against the fence.</p>

<p>'Poor Tom was a terrible simpleton, for, without a word of
preparation to his wife, he said&mdash;"Why, Mary, here's father
come back."</p>

<p>'Of course, she came straight out on to the verandah, and as
soon, as she saw her dead and buried father, gave one scream and
fainted. Then the youngster cried out at seeing its mother fall,
and with one thing and another Tom had his hands full, so that
he never saw how the old man disappeared.</p>

<p>'That was the first time old Gannon's ghost was seen.'</p>

<p>'I hope he was more interesting the next time,' I yawned.</p>

<p>'He was, you may take your oath. He didn't come and lean
against the fence quietly, but took to walking round the house
and swearing like a bullock-driver. The worst of it was that no
one could understand him. They could tell it was swearing, and
bad swearing, too, by the emphasis the old man threw into it, but
as to what language it was&mdash;why, there was not a soul could
guess. Now, old Gannon, as everybody knew, had never learnt any
language in his life, so where he'd been acquiring foreign
tongues during the time he had been buried was the mystery.</p>

<p>'All the people from round about I used to come to see the old
apparition gabbling out swear words, and bring every foreigner
they could lay hands on, but the only one they had any success
with was a Hindoo hawker. He said, and whether he lied or not I
can't say, but what he stated was to the effect that he had seen
the same sort of thing before in his own country, and it was not
old Gannon's ghost at all, but something or another in his
appearance who might have come from anywhere&mdash;Central
Africa, or Lapland, or any other outlandish place. He didn't
express any opinion as to the cause of such strange procedure on
the part of a disembodied spirit; only asserted that such things
had been known in his country, and that, so far as he knew, there
was no cure for it.</p>

<p>'Now, this roused all the woman and daughter in Mrs. Davis,
who commenced to abuse the Hindoo hawker, asking him if he
supposed that she did not know her own dear, blessed father, and
could imagine that he would allow any kind of heathen, black or
white&mdash;and here she threw great force and expression into
her language&mdash;to steal his body? That, if such things did
happen in the hawker's country, why, she had no great opinion of
it as a place to live in, although it was quite good enough for
him.</p>

<p>'She began to get hysterical, and all the while the shindy was
on the ghost of old Gannon kept stumping around swearing volubly,
so you can imagine the confusion.'</p>

<p>Here Jim paused, and started his pipe again at the slush lamp.
I was commencing to get interested.</p>

<p>'Well, this tireless old ghost began to get a nuisance, and
although Mary Davis entreated him to go back to his grave and
rest there quiet he paid no attention to her at all. At last the
thing attracted so much attention, and began to bring such crowds
of people, that Davis had a fence put round the place and made a
charge for admission, and the ghost brought in a tidy income,
which smoothed things over, and the Davis family began to get
proud and uppish.</p>

<p>'Then came their downfall.</p>

<p>'As I said before, the ghost had attracted so much, attention
that many people who had studied this kind of thing came to see
it, and amongst them a very clever man with at least twelve
letters after his name, and he stopped there some days trying to
find out the truth.</p>

<p>'One night&mdash;the ghost, of coarse, only walked at
night&mdash;he suddenly struck his forehead, and said some words
of gibberish to the ghost, and, to everyone's astonishment, the
spectre stopped, and the two entered into an animated
conversation, and finally shook hands. You can imagine now
everybody crowded round and stared at this scene.</p>

<p>'"Now," said the eminent man, turning to Mrs. Davis, "I can
explain this thing. This is your father's ghost, and yet it
isn't. Now, have you ever had any blacks about here?"</p>

<p>'"No,'" replied Mrs. Davis, indignantly. "Father never could
bear them, and, besides, they've been all dead years and years
ago."</p>

<p>'"Ah! I thought so. Just you dig up your father's body, and
you will find that you have put him in an ancient native burying
ground. The old man evidently didn't like this, and attempted to
get up and come and tell you so; but some old blackfellow made an
effort to 'jump up white-fellow' at the same time, and the result
was that things have got terribly mixed."</p>

<p>'Here the eminent man with twelve letters after his name
paused, and Mrs. Davis, as she thought of the Hindoo hawker,
burst into tears.</p>

<p>'The scientist went on: "I have been, studying native dialects
of late, and fortunately was able to recognise a few words. The
result is as you see. I have ascertained your father's wishes,
and those are, that he should be dug up again and buried
elsewhere. If you do that I am convinced that he will rest in
peace." With this the eminent scientist departed.'</p>

<p>I was just going to sleep when Jim commenced again, and woke
me up.</p>

<p>'You would have thought that when the Davis family heard all
the rights of the case they would have at once acted on the
scientist's advice, but, unfortunately, they had grown
avaricious, and kept the poor old ghost still running around on
account of the income he brought in. However, the truth got
about, and the public commenced to buck. Moreover, those who had
come at first turned rusty, and demanded their money back. Said
that they had come to see old Gannon's ghost, not that of a
common blackfellow so they had to dig old Gannon up,
and&mdash;'</p>

<h2><a id="ch22"></a>22. &mdash; THE BLACK WATERHOLE</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, 30 Nov 1895</h2>

<p class="first">
'THE story of the Black Waterhole,' said Tom Donovan, 'is
firmly believed in by every man, woman, and child around that
part, I don't say but what I feel inclined to put some faith in
it myself. However, I'll tell you the truth of it, and you can
judge for yourselves, only all I tell you has been well
authenticated.</p>

<p>'The Black Waterhole is on the Koramang River; a rare old
place about there for the worst kind of selectors. Smart fellows
the youngsters are, too, so far as regards the bush, but as
ignorant of the outer world as it is possible for any one to be
at the end of the nineteenth century. The only books they read
are the penny cowboy and detective novels, and they implicitly
believe that such fustian heroes really exist in America.</p>

<p>'One day one of these budding Premiers of Federated Australia
was fishing in the Black Waterhole when he saw something rise up
out of the water and look at him. Look at him hard, with such a
look that his heart sank down to his belt and his knees got what
he called the 'ager' in them&mdash;meaning ague. However, he was
able to cut and run for it, which he did. When asked to describe
the appearance he could not do so. It was a man's head&mdash;it
was a calf's head&mdash;it was a snake's head&mdash;here somebody
asked if it was not a donkey's head; but the matter was too
serious for joking, for the Black Waterhole was one of the best
holes in the river, and if that was haunted it would be a bad
look-out.</p>

<p>'At last some bold spirits volunteered to go and recover the
fishing line, and four started. Three stopped behind for various
reasons, so the fourth found himself alone when, he reached the
waterhole, and did not fancy the position at all. However, he
took his courage in both hands, and proceeded, to pull the line
up. Something was on the end, probably a turtle; but when he
hauled it up he saw something that he dared not touch. It was the
hand of a man&mdash;such a hand! It had come away from the arm at
the wrist; it was bleached and rotten and corrupted,
but&mdash;and the young fellow noticed it at once&mdash;the hand
was clenched round the line. The hook had not caught by chance in
this awful hand. But the dead hand had clutched the line, and
become detached from the body.</p>

<p>'The young fellow kept his nerve, and walked home holding the
ghastly thing by the line. Arrived there the neighbors assembled
to hear has tale, and the youthful hero told it with many
embellishments. How he felt the hand haul at the line, and then
pull hard against him, etc.</p>

<p>'"The police will have to be informed," said old Philaster.
"There's a body in that hole where the hand came from."</p>

<p>'"Let it stop there," returned a neighbor; "we don't want the
police poking about here for days, prying into things that don't
concern them."</p>

<p>'"That's true," echoed several others. But old Philaster
insisted that the police must be informed, otherwise it would
look suspicious if the thing leaked out, which it was sure to do,
sooner or later.</p>

<p>'So the police were informed, and the drowned hand, still
clutching the line, passed over to them. Then the highly
disagreeable of task of searching for the body was proceeded
with, and the horrid thing at last found, brought ashore, and
recognised by the young fisherman as the horror that rose up out
of the water and stared at him.</p>

<p>'Now came the question, who was the deceased, and how did he
come in the waterhole? And that question neither the police nor
any one else was able to answer.</p>

<p>'It was three years afterwards, and, things about the Black
Waterhole had much altered for the better. The selections had
been fenced for the most part; and the face of the country, on
account of the clearing of the timber, entirely altered in
appearance.</p>

<p>'Two troopers with a prisoner rode to the Black Waterhole one
midday, and turned out for a short spell. The man was a horse
thief, who had been caught after a long chase; they put leg irons
on him as soon as he dismounted.</p>

<p>'When they had prepared their food, and given him some with a
pannikin of tea, he looked tip.</p>

<p>'"What place do you call this?" he asked, sullenly.</p>

<p>'"The Black Waterhole," answered one of the tippers, shortly,
for their prisoner was not a man to rouse their sympathy.</p>

<p>'"The Black Waterhole," he repeated. "The country was
different when I was here last."</p>

<p>'"Yes. Three of us camped here about four years ago, and one
is here still. No, thanky, no tea for me," and he emptied the
pannikin on the ground.</p>

<p>'"What's the meaning of this?" asked the trooper.</p>

<p>'"Leary's dead, I believe, so I can do him no harm if I tell
the story. When we camped here I was mortal sick, and that was
the reason we stopped two days here camped, for I could not ride.
Leary was a swell, down on his luck, and Bardie was the same;
both had come up country for a spell to get away from their debts
in town, I suppose. I had been breaking, and we met accidentally,
and travelled together.</p>

<p>'"In the afternoon of the day we stopped here they had, a row,
and came to blows, but Bardie was much the better man, and the
fight did not last long, but I was too weak to interfere. It was
something about a woman, I think. Next morning, after we had had
breakfast, I got up to try and use my legs a bit. Bardie was
sitting on the bank fishing, and as I staggered up I saw Leary
sneak up behind, and suddenly shove him in the river. Bardie
could not swim, and when I saw that it was murder I crept behind
a tree, for I knew Leary would not let me live if he knew I had
witnessed it. I suppose in his struggles Bardie got further away
from the bank, for, presently I saw Leary pick up a big stone and
hurl it at something in the water; then he commenced to run up
and down the bank, calling to me. When I came up he shouted,
"Bardie is drowning; he fell into the lagoon, and I can't
swim."</p>

<p>'"I'm too weak to go in," I said.</p>

<p>'Just then Bardie came up for the last time, looking awful.</p>

<p>'"Do something," cried Leary; "throw him the fishing line," I
took the line the man-had been using, and he caught it, but as
soon as we put a strain on it, it broke, and he went down, for
good.</p>

<p>'There was a pause.</p>

<p>'"That's not the end of it," said the trooper.</p>

<p>'"So far as I am concerned, it is," replied the prisoner.</p>

<p>'"What became of Leary?"</p>

<p>'"He went to Coolgardie with the first rush, and I heard died
of fever. We parted as soon as possible, you bet."</p>

<p>'"Bardie has been out of that hole some three years, and it
has been; flooded half a dozen times since, so you can drink your
tea."</p>

<p>'"How was he found?" asked the prisoner.</p>

<p>'"He caught hold of a boy's fishing line, and his hand came
off, and came up holding on to the line. Then they found the
body."</p>

<p>'The prisoner stared at him with a white face.</p>

<p>'"It's true," went on the trooper; "the hand catching the line
is in spirits in Sydney. But you have solved the mystery, and if
you make a proper confession when we get in, and give a good
description of Leary, it may do you good. Leary may not be dead,
after all."</p>

<p></p>

<p>'LEARY was very much alive, and had done well at Coolgardie.
He was back in Sydney under another name, swelling round the
bars. He was tracked down without much difficulty, for he had a
tattoo mark on his hand, made when he was a boy at sea.</p>

<p>'One day the inspector who had the warrant for his arrest, and
had purposely made friends with him, remarked to him that, if he
would walk as far as the Central, he had a curious thing to show
him. Leary complied, and when there the inspector took him into a
room where, on a small scale, there; was a museum like that of
Scotland! Yard.</p>

<p>'"What do you think of this?" he asked, holding up the glass
jar containing the hand, from the Black Waterhole.</p>

<p>'Leary fell back, every line in his face crying guilt.</p>

<p>'"His hand," he murmured. "Bardie's hand!" and the next minute
the handcuffs were on him.'</p>

<h2><a id="ch23"></a>23. &mdash; BREWSTER'S AFFLICTED DOG</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, 28 Dec 1895</h3>

<p class="first">
'I ONLY found out what ailed the dog by accident,' said Jim.
'You see, it was this way. The dog was not an ordinary dog, but
it possessed another identity, a what-do-you-call-it? An astral
body, or something of that sort. Quite unexpectedly this poor
dog's being would be projected into space somewhere, and then the
form that was left could do nothing but sit on end and howl until
the spirit returned. This was rough on the dog, and also on
Brewster, for he was continually having to fight people for
kicking his dog because the brute howled so. Sometimes, too, the
astral dog would come back and sit down and jeer at his own body
and refuse to go inside, and that body could do nothing in return
but howl; so the dog lived in considerable hot water.</p>

<p>'Now, there happened to be on the station a young fellow,
horse-breaking, who was just the ordinary kind of bush hand,
without a spark of imagination, and he and Brewster were always
at loggerheads about the afflicted dog. His name was Cotten, and
he particularly disliked being kept awake by the howls of the
dog. One night the dog was perfectly quiet, strange to say,
and&mdash;'</p>

<p>'How did you find out about the dog's astral body, Jim?' I
asked.</p>

<p>'Well this way&mdash;it was the only theory that seemed
feasible, and, as the dog never contradicted it, I came to the
conclusion that it was true. However, the dog, although the
actual cause of the trouble, was not the chief actor in it.
Cotten and Brewster had to go out together early that morning
after the quiet night I spoke about, and Brewster hunted high and
low for his afflicted dog and found him not. He accused Cotten of
having made away with the animal, and they came to high words,
and called each other the usual number of scarlet liars. They
went away together still quarrelling; but only one came back, and
that was Cotten. He told a fairy tale that when they were out
together they saw two dogs racing through the scrub. The first
one didn't try to dodge trees or anything, but seemed to let the
trees pass through his body; the other one in pursuit had to slew
about all roads, and lost, ground.</p>

<p>'"There's my dog!" cried Brewster, and started after him as
hard as he could lick. Cotten was not such a fool as to go
pelting through a thick gidea and brigalow scrub after another
man's dog, so he waited where he was, but Brewster did not come
back, so he came home. Next morning we turned out to look for
Brewster, and, true enough, we found him with a broken leg.</p>

<p>'He was very bad for some time, but at last he began to pull
around; but Cotten had to keep away from him, the sight of him
excited him so. He declared that Cotten had been up to some
tricks with his dog, and blamed him for his broken leg.</p>

<p>'Now, I believe Cotten was quite right in what he saw, or said
that he saw, and could no more have invented the yarn than he
could have flown; as I said, he hadn't a spark of
imagination&mdash;he couldn't even tell a decent lie without
being found out. The afflicted dog turned up about a week after
the accident, miserably poor and thin; but he seemed to have no
life in him, and there was a vacant look in his eyes, and, in my
opinion, his astral body bad succeeded in giving him the slip for
good.</p>

<p>'Brewster gradually got better, and at last was able to hop
about on crutches. Certainly, he confirmed what Cotten had
related, but, at the same time, he seemed to think that Cotten
had cast some unholy spell on the dog, which, at any rate, proved
that Brewster had imagination, for the idea, of Cotten knowing
anything about "unholy spells" was too immense. The only thing
Cotten knew about "spells" that I can think of was when he
wrote a letter once a year, and used to put his head down on the
table, and stretch his tongue out and curl it round, while he
asked somebody if r-a-n-e-s spelt reins.'</p>

<p>'Oh, hang it, Jim! What the deuce has Cotten's spelling to do
with Brewster's dog?'</p>

<p>'Nothing, I admit But, at any rate, the dog pined away and
died&mdash;that is to say, that empty frame of the dog died; and
then the tragedy happened.</p>

<p>'You see, Brewster's leg had not set well, and he was bound to
limp for the rest of his life, and that made him cranky,
and&mdash;between ourselves&mdash;a bit off his chump, and this
dislike of Cotten had become a regular craze, until at last the
place became unbearable, and the owner told them that, one must
leave. Brewster was the best man of the two before this
accident, but what with that and his cranky temper he was mot
much good, so he had to go.</p>

<p>'You can imagine that this did not improve his feelings
towards Cotten, and when he had his cheque and his horses were
brought in, he broke out and threatened Cotten, who sat with has
mouth open all the time, not half understanding what it was all
about. He was very bitter, and just as he was riding away he
forgot himself and whistled to his dog, not remembering that the
dog was dead.</p>

<p>'The Chinese cook swore that when Brewster whistled, a dog,
just like his, came from somewhere and trotted off at the horse's
heels. None of the rest of us saw it.'</p>

<p>'I am glad to hear you admit that, Jim.'</p>

<p>'Brewster went away and five days afterwards Cotten's horse
came home without Cotten on his back. Of course, we ran the
tracks back until dark without success, and had to give it up
until the next morning. For although we tried tracking with
firesticks and matches we made no fist of it, and had to give it
up. There was, of course, no suspicion of foul play, for Cotten
had been riding a green colt; and anything might have happened.
We camped where we were, and to the middle of the night we were
aroused by a most doleful howl.</p>

<p>'"Hang the dingos!" said one fellow.</p>

<p>'"Dingos?" said another; "them's no dingos; that's Brewster's
dog!"</p>

<p>'We all of us listened intently. Sure enough, when the howl
went up again, we all recognised it as the howl of Brewster's
dog. The dog we knew had been dead for weeks. I tell you it was a
very unpleasant camp for the rest of the night. In the morning we
started off on the tracks at the first glimmer, and about 10
o'clock we found poor Cotten dead as a herring.</p>

<p>'What's worse, though, he had been killed. It was no accident.
There had been a fight and Cotten had been stabbed with a sheath
knife.</p>

<p>'Of course everybody said "Brewster!" and with good reason, as
it afterwards turned out.</p>

<p>'One of us went back for the tray buggy the rations were
carried on, and Cotten's body was taken in and the police sent
for.</p>

<p>'Of course they could do nothing but agree with us that it was
probably Brewster; but the question was to find Brewster.</p>

<p>'Now, you may think us very stupid, but none of us thought of
connecting the howling of that dog that night with the
disappearance of Brewster, and it was not till a dog came and
howled round the quarters all one night that we thought anything
about it. Then Dick Mathers said to me at breakfast, "Do you
remember that dog howling that night we were tracking
Cotten?"</p>

<p>'"Of course I did."</p>

<p>'"Well, it's my opinion that it was the same dog as was round
here last night. Do you think, if we could get leave to go out
and camp there, we could fix that spot?"</p>

<p>'"I am pretty well sure of it."</p>

<p>'"Then, let's go."</p>

<p>'To make a long story short we went, and while we were trying
to get the right direction, there came the howl again. There was
a very fair moon, so Dick and I started after it, and presently,
at a bit of an opening, we came to the spot. A dog was
certainly sitting there howling, but he seemed to vanish as we
came up; but there was something else that did not vanish, and
that was the body of Brewster, hanging to a tree.'</p>

<p>Jim paused, and I was just going to say good night, when he
spoke again.</p>

<p>'I just want to ask you a question. There's that there astral
dog still wandering about somewhere, and I want to know what's
become of him? The other dog is a skeleton long ago, so he can't
get back there. Has he got to wander around forever?'</p>

<p>'He shouldn't have been such a fool as to project himself out
of the other body,' I said. 'It's his look-out anyhow. I suppose
the story is true?'</p>

<p>'Quite true,' said Jim, as he went off into the sleep of
innocence.</p>

<h2><a id="ch24"></a>24. &mdash; THE CATALEPTIC</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, 4 Jan 1896</h3>

<p class="first">
'WHAT'S the name that they call it when a man goes stiff and
dead-like, and can't move or speak? Dog&mdash;something, isn't
it?' asked Jim.</p>

<p>'Catalepsy, I suppose you mean.'</p>

<p>'Ah! I knew it was something either about a dog or a cat.
Well, we had a fellow out west who used to go that way&mdash;or,
at least, he did once on that station. It gave us all a turn, I
can tell you, when, we woke up one morning and found him in his
bunk as dead as a doornail, to all appearance. It was blazing hot
weather, so there was nothing to do but bury him as soon as
possible. Some of the fellows started to knock up a coffin, and
two of us dig a grave in the softest patch we could find.</p>

<p>Now, there was a fellow on the place putting in time as store
and book keeper. He had been pretty fast in his day, and gone to
the dogs. He had been brought up as a doctor, but had never
passed, for he did something disgraceful, and had to clear out;
so he got lower and lower, until at last the boss, who knew
something about his people, took him on to the station, to knock
about there for a year or two, and see if he would steady down a
bit.</p>

<p>Young Pills had looked at Lanty&mdash;that was the name of the
man&mdash;and pronounced him a corpse; but when we had the grave
dug and the coffin made, and everything ready, including a
prayer-book, Pills went and had another look at Lanty, and he
said, "I don't believe this man's dead at all; he's in a
cataleptic (yes, I remember now, that's the word) trance." He
called the boss over, and he pointed out a lot of things that
should have happened if Lanty had been a real corpse, but as they
hadn't happened it showed he was only a sham corpse.</p>

<p>'"Why couldn't you have found this out before?" said the boss.
"Here we've got a grave and a coffin steady for nothing; I've a
good mind to utilise them on you."</p>

<p>'Pills said at wasn't his fault, as no one could tell at
first, and perhaps the man might die after all.</p>

<p>'"And how long before be comes to, or dies?"</p>

<p>'"You must have somebody always with him, and at the first
sign of life he must be helped to sit up, and, if possible, got
to swallow something. When he, begins to smell you can bury
him."</p>

<p>'So one of us sat by Lanty all that day, and we had some weak
brandy and water ready for him against his waking up.</p>

<p>'When night came on we put a young galoot of a stringybarker
on to take the first watch&mdash;a real myall, who'd never seen a
town bigger than Dustburra in his life. He was to call on of us
at once if anything happened, and he did with a vengeance.</p>

<p>'Seems this youngster got nervous like when we all went to
sleep and, left him all alone with a dead man, as he supposed,
for he knew nothing about cataleptic trances, and after a bit he
got looking at the brandy and water, and wondering if it would
give him a little Dutch courage. The man was dead, and would
never want it. He took hold of the pannikin, and was about to
drink it, when a deep sigh startled him. He looked round. Lanty
was sitting up in his bunk, looking at him, with a ghastly
smile.</p>

<p>'"That's mine," he said, indicating the brandy and water. Next
moment that young greenhider was racing down the paddock, yelling
"Fire! Blacks! Murder! Help!" and all manner of things.</p>

<p>'We woke up with a start, and without troubling about the
young fool, who fell over a stump and lay there until daylight,
we turned to and fixed Lanty up, and some of us went to put the
coffin out of sight and filled the grave up, for fear it should
hurt his feelings. He had a good quiet sleep for the rest of the
night, and in the morning he told us of his experiences.</p>

<p>'He said that even though he was lying there without being
able to stir, he knew all that was passing; that it was something
worse than awful when we were going to bury him, and that, as for
Pills, he would never forget his stoping his premature
burial.</p>

<p>'Lanty got round soon enough, and Pills warned him that if he
went on to a strange station he must tell them that he was liable
to these seizures, or he would be whipped underground before he
knew, where he was.</p>

<p>'In the course of time Lanty shifted to the next station as
boundary rider, where, of course, they knew all about him. He
said goodbye to Pills before he left, and almost cried as he
remarked, 'I shall send, for you if anything goes wrong again.
Then he went away sobbing.</p>

<p>'Some time after that we were mustering, and Pills came with
us for a bit of a change. We were camped about fifteen miles from
the station that Lanty was boundary-riding on, and just towards
one morning we were awakened by a great shout of "Help!"</p>

<p>'We all sat up and listened. I remember the scene well, for
the morning star was shining like a moon in the grey dawn to the
east.</p>

<p>'Suddenly Pills cried out, "Did you hear that?" We listened,
but heard nothing but the horse-bells. "There it is again," he
cried, "Don't you hear it? He's crying out, 'They are going to
bury me alive. Come quick!' It is Lanty calling. Come, Jim, to
the horses."</p>

<p>'Now, I will say this of those ne'er-do-well chaps, that when
there is any trouble on, and a little bit of daredevil work to
do, they are all there.</p>

<p>'Pills collared the first horse he came to and I took another,
and we jumped on them bare-backed, and he was for racing off like
that. I said, "No, we shall make more haste in reality by going
up for our saddles." So we went back to camp, saddled up, and
then the race began. Fortunately, it was a splendid
road&mdash;all level country, and only two gates. How Pills did
go it! The sun was only just over the trees when we were in sight
of the station.</p>

<p>'Now, luckily I remembered where two men who had died on the
station at different times had been buried, and I guessed that
they would naturally bury Lanty in the same place, so I told
Pills to follow me and made straight for there instead of going
to the station. Lucky we did. The grave was dug, the men were
there, and just taking the coffin out of the cart.</p>

<p>'"Stop! Stop!" yelled Pills, galloping up and jumping off his
horse. "The man's not dead!"</p>

<p>'"How do you know?" said the super.</p>

<p>'"I must see him first. Take the lid off." One of the men put
the blade of his shovel in the frail coffin, and up came the lid.
There lay poor Lanty, sure enough, and he had all his clothes on
including an old coat that he always used to wear on account of
the handiness of all the pockets.</p>

<p>'"Now, didn't you say that if he began to smell we could bury
him, when he got into this state?" asked the super.</p>

<p>'"I did," returned Pills</p>

<p>'"Well, smell him then."</p>

<p>'There was no doubt about it, a very strong odour of
decomposition came from the open coffin.</p>

<p>Pills knelt down and put his hand on Lanty's forehead.</p>

<p>'"Feel that," he said to the super. "Does that feel like a
dead man?"</p>

<p>'The super felt Lanty's forehead, and seemed puzzled. "It does
not," he said.</p>

<p>'"Lift him out of the coffin." We did so.</p>

<p>'"Take his coat off, Jim," said Pills to me, as he held the
body up in a sitting position.</p>

<p>'I did so, and stepped aside to lay it out on the dray. Then I
dropped to it all.</p>

<p>'"When did you fellows kill?" I asked.</p>

<p>'"Four days ago," said the super. "But what has that to do
with it?"</p>

<p>'"Everything. If you chaps had taken his coat off you would
have found out where the smell came from. He had some old dog
baits in his pocket, and I turned them out on the tail of the
dray."</p>

<p>'Well, to wind up. Lanty got right again, and says that he
knew everything that went on, and he felt that his only chance
was Pills, so he yelled out for him. Strange to say, Pills pulled
himself up with a jerk. He finished his studies, passed his
examination, and has now a first-rate practice in Sydney; and
Lanty, who is frightened to leave him, is his coachman.'</p>

<p>'Jim, you seem to have an intimate acquaintance with all kinds
of spooks. Did you ever come across the ghost of a barbed-wire
fence or a galvanised iron bucket?'</p>

<p>'Can't say in one act. But I'll overhaul my memory on the
subject.'</p>

<h2><a id="ch25"></a>25. &mdash; THE HAUNTED MILK BUCKET</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, 11 Jan 1896</h3>

<p class="first">
'IT'S a queer thing,' remarked Jim, 'but after you asked me
that question last night, I fell to thanking about it, and I
distinctly remember a very strange thing that happened about a
galvanised iron bucket.'</p>

<p>'You mean to say,' I interrupted, 'that you stopped awake and
made one up.'</p>

<p>'No fear. This is perfectly true, and I'll tell you of a man,
who you must know, too, was there. You remember Tom Sweeney?'</p>

<p>'No, I don't,' I said.</p>

<p>'His brother married an elder sister of Bill Burke, and, as
you remember, Burke was breaking out on the Paroo at the time you
passed down with cattle&mdash;or it might have been the year
before or the year after, I'm not sure which. Anyhow, you must
know him.'</p>

<p>'I'll be hanged if I do, and who is it, Burke or Sweeney, that
I ought to know? And which saw the ghost of the bucket, Burke or
Sweeney?'</p>

<p>'It is Sweeney you ought to know. I only mentioned Burke in
order to bring him back to your remembrance. I never said that
either of them saw the ghost of a bucket I said that something
strange happened about a bucket. Anyhow, I remember that Sweeney
broke his neck before you came up on the station, so I suppose
you couldn't have known him. He was there, at any rate, and was
the cause of what happened.</p>

<p>Ringfield was in charge then. I suppose you won't deny knowing
him? He was going to get married, and wanted a lot of heifers
broken in, so that there should be plenty of milk and butter on
the station when he brought his wife up. Now, there's no fun in
breaking heifers in. If they're not choking themselves in the
bail, they're kicking the leg-rope off and knocking the bucket
into smithereens. Moreover, between, ourselves, Ringfield knew as
much about cattle as he did about giraffes, and instead of
picking out nice, quiet, lazy-going Shorthorns, he pitched on
bald-faced carts of things, who'd yell and squeal and lie down in
the bail, and kick blazes out of creation. Naturally, everyone,
was in a bad temper; for we had to get up in the morning, and
give the doctor a hand, and we generally cussed
everything&mdash;Ringfield's future wife included. The time came
when be started down to get married, and he was to be away for
three weeks. Said Sweeney that night&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Was that after he broke has neck?' I asked.</p>

<p>'No; how the deuce could it be? No; it was before. And he
said, "Look here, lads, I'm sick of man-handling those brutes;
let's let them rip, and go out to the old Durham bulls camp and
bring in the same number of decent, quiet heifers. There's a lot
of good ones there, with young calves. I saw them there this
morning. Bet you two to one that Ringfield will never know the
difference."</p>

<p>'We all thought it a splendid joke, and the next morning we
turned the heifers out, and they were just as glad to go as we
were to get rid of them. That evening we had a nice lot of quiet,
packed heifers in the yard, and in a few days some of them would
walk into the bail without roping, and by the time the three
weeks were over the whole of them were like old milkers.</p>

<p>'Now, we had a young sneak of a jackeroo on the station. I've
had a lot of experience with jackeroos, and I've found them all
sorts. Some as wild as you can make 'em, up to any larks; others
sneaks, and I must say that, although I'm a Tamworth native
myself, I prefer the imported men. You can do something with
them, but the other sort think that because they are born in the
country they must know everything, and their conceit is something
stinking, that's what it is. This young whelp had never been out
of Sydney before, and he'd been sent up by the firm who owned the
station, being a relation of one of the partners. But I'm getting
away from my story.'</p>

<p>'You have run off the rails a bit'</p>

<p>'Yes; it's a bad habit of mine, I admit. Ringfield came up
with his bride, and she turned out a nice, quiet, sensible body,
who had been brought up on a station, and knew all about it.
Ringfield took her down to the milking-yard one morning, and,
would you believe it, that duffer didn't know that those were not
the same heifers, and explained to her how he had picked them all
out himself against her arrival, and what splendid milkers they
had turned out. What does that young fool of a jackeroo do, but
blurt out the whole truth might in front of Mrs Ringfield, making
a regular fool of her husband. Did you ever bear of such a
thing?'</p>

<p>Jim started has pipe again his disgust at the remembrance,
then he proceeded.</p>

<p>'Ringfield, of course, was very mad at being made to Hook so
small before his bride, and when he toad pumped the jackeroo dry,
and found out that it was Sweeney who originated the proceeding,
he had it in for him. Now, I do not believe that Ringfield ever
anticipated what happened. It was simply done out of spite, but
he never meant it would be serious.</p>

<p>'"Sweeney," he said one day, "Miss. Ringfield has taken a fancy
to that brown colt. You might try him with a skirt. See how he
stands it."</p>

<p>'Sweeney whistled. "I might as well try to break in the devil
to a skirt, Mr. Ringfield," replied he. "Why, that brown colt can
kick a mosquito off his ear nine times out of ten. He'll never
carry a lady."</p>

<p>'"Oh well, if you are frightened of him, that's another thing.
I've heard you blow that you could ride anything with a
tail."</p>

<p>'Now, this got Sweeney jumping mad as, of course, it was meant
to do, and he asked me to catch a horse and come out with him to
the One-mile Plain, and he'd try the colt with a skirt. So we
went, and Sweeney took a red blanket with him for a dummy skirt.
When we got on the plain he tacked this under his leg and let it
flap, and, my oath! that brown colt did go it! He never shifted
Sweeney, though, and he kept him going right across the plain.
There was one tree grew right in the middle of that plain,
and&mdash;would you credit it?&mdash;just when they were close to
it the colt put his foot into a hole, stood on his head, pitched
Sweeney against the tree, and fell over on his back. There they
lay, quiet as possible, the two of them, with the red blanket
lake like a sheet of blood, between them.</p>

<p>'I pulled the horse off Sweeney, but both their necks were
broken, and I could do nothing but cover poor Sweeney up with the
red blanket, and ride hell-for-leather into the station.</p>

<p>'You may imagine what Ringfield felt like, but the worst was
to come. Next morning the milk was taken to the little lean-to
used as a dairy, and Mrs Ringfield, who had taken the dairy under
her charge, went down to strain the milk into the dishes.
Suddenly there was a shriek that could be heard all over the
station, and when they ran into the dairy, there was Mrs
Ringfield in a dead faint on the floor, an empty bucket beside
her, and&mdash;a dish full of blood on the table.'</p>

<p>Jim paused.</p>

<p>'Now, this is a solemn fact! It was the same bucket Sweeney
used when breaking in the heifers, and you could milk into that
bucket pure, sweet milk, but when you turned it out into the
dish&mdash;it was blood.</p>

<p>'They tried everything&mdash;scraping, and scalding, and
scrubbing, till the bucket shone like silver inside. It was all
of no avail, and, what is more, the two heifers Sweeney had
broken in would not let themselves be milked into any other
bucket. They would kick, and bellow, and buck if you tried it on,
quiet as they generally were. So they had to be turned out
again.'</p>

<p>'What became of the bucket, Jim?'</p>

<p>'It was taken away down to an old hut on the river where
travellers used to camp, but it very soon had some holes punched
in the bottom, for a yarn got about that the water dipped up in
it turned to blood before it was carried to the hut.'</p>

<h2><a id="ch26"></a>26. &mdash; THE BLACK GIN'S CURSE</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, 25 Jan 1896</h3>

<p class="first">
FAR away in the north west of New South Wales there was a
cattle station, then one of the most outside ones existing. There
was, as usual, much friction amongst the two races at first, but
in time this cooled down, and the blacks were allowed to come in
and hang about the station unmolested.</p>

<p>There was a married stockman on the place, his wife acting as
cook. They had one little girl about six years old; and both
parents were intensely fond of her, the man especially. She was
also a great pet of all hands on the station. Instead of going
ragged and barefooted like most sturdy station children,' she was
always neatly dressed, and wore shoes and socks.</p>

<p>One day she was missed. Search was made for her everywhere
without avail, and the parents were in despair, the father
especially so. Next morning the search, was renewed, some of the
blacks being enlisted in the work.</p>

<p>Dick the stockman, the child's father, went off by himself,
and did not return until night. He spoke to no one, but sullenly
sat himself down and ate some food and drank some tea. After a
smoke he went down the paddock, and returned with a horse
belonging to himself, which could be easily caught. He said he
was going to camp out all night, and took his carbine with him to
fire off shots that perhaps she might hear if yet alive, so
nobody thought anything about it, and he left unquestioned.</p>

<p>Next morning he returned about 10 o'clock. He hung his horse
up, and on his wife going to the door to meet him he handed her
one of their child's little shoes.</p>

<p>'I found that in a blacks' camp yesterday, and I went out last
night, watched them to see that they did not shift camp, and at
daylight shot as many as I could of the wretches. They have
killed her.'</p>

<p>The woman staggered against the doorpost, and regarded her
husband with eyes of horror and affright.</p>

<p>'Oh, God! what have you done?' she cried, wringing her hands.
'An old gin brought Mary in late last night, and she is now
asleep inside. The gin carried Mary in here in her arms, for when
they found her she had taken off her shoes. The child was lame,
so the old woman carried her in, at first on her back, and then,
when the child got sleepy, in her arms.'</p>

<p>The man made no answer, but, unslinging the fatal carbine,
walked away and threw it far into the lagoon the station was
formed on. Meanwhile the wife hastily unsaddled the horse and let
the animal go.</p>

<p>Dick came back and entered, but never spoke, and never kissed
his sleeping child, but sat down sullenly on a sawn log near the
fireplace and leaned his chin on his hands. His wife asked if he
would have some food, but he shook his head, and resumed his
quiet, sullen demeanor. The poor woman did not know what to do;
if she held her tongue the affair might blow over and never be
found out But it was destined to be, and in a strange
fashion.</p>

<p>About midday there came a shrill cry from outside. There stood
the old gin, naked, shining, and shrivelled. She waved her lean,
arms aloft and commenced to shriek out what was evidently a fell
denunciation of the bloody deed, and to call down a curse on the
doers.</p>

<p>The men who had gathered at the outcry were awestruck. Dick
alone kept his composure. He walked quietly up to her, pointed to
himself, and stood with bent head, as though willing to stand the
whole brunt of it; but she heeded him not. In her fell wrath she
heeded him no more than if he had been invisible. She pointed to
each one present; she pointed to the sky, as though praying no
rain should ever fall on the accursed place; at the cattle and
horses visible in the paddock, as though beseeching that a
pestilence should smite them. And after having got through a most
comprehensive and Old Testament kind of curse, spat on the
ground, turned away, and her gaunt shadow disappeared amongst the
trees.</p>

<p>Then Dick confessed what he had done, and announced his
intention of going at once and giving himself up. All efforts of
his wife and friends were vain. He ate a good meal and rode off
to the nearest township. He was committed for trial but never
tried, as he was found to be insane with a suicidal tendency, and
sent to, the asylum during her Majesty's pleasure.</p>

<p>While there a strange disease came on him. It was not leprosy,
but a kind of death In life that made its appearance. The doctors
could make nothing of it, and only found an analogy in one or two
doubtful historical cases. His body emitted an offensive smell,
growing worse and worse as his emaciated form, grew more
loathsome day after day, until at last when death relieved him he
was nothing but a corpse that looked as though it had been buried
for days and days.</p>

<p>And the station? There, too, the curse wrought its fell spell,
but not on the human beings. The cattle felt its evil influence,
and died strangely and in a mysterious manner. The sky was brass
year after year, and there was a strange tale got round that on
the home lagoon there floated a carbine&mdash;a carbine that
should have gone down like any stone, but still it refused to
sink.</p>

<p>The owners tried to sell the place; but its unlucky name had
got about, and it had to be abandoned, and is now a desolate
region of pine scrub.</p>

<p>Thus was the gin's curse accomplished.</p>

<h2><a id="ch27"></a>27. &mdash; "BACK IN TEN MINUTES"</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, 1 Feb 1896</h3>

<p class="first">
'THERE are no flies on me,' said Jim, 'when ghosts are around.
I don't know why I should have been especially picked out for
this sort of thing, but somehow I seem to have come across more
adventures of this kind than most men. Did I ever tell you about
the ghost who was always "back in ten minutes?"'</p>

<p>'No, he must have been a punctual sort of ghost.'</p>

<p>'That's just what he wasn't, and that's just what made him so
fidgety and restless. Did you ever know a man who wrote up on a
card on his office door, "Back in ten minutes," who was back
under half an hour? No, the most unpunctual man in the world is
the man who is coming back in ten minutes.</p>

<p>'This ghost adventure did not happen to me, but to a kind of
distant relation of my brother's.'</p>

<p>'How was it he was not a distant relation of yours as
well?'</p>

<p>'This way. This fellow's name was Withers, and my brother
married a second cousin of his; so, although I cannot quite fix
the relationship, it can have nothing to do with me, unless,'
mused Jim, 'it comes through old Bowles, he being stepfather to
Withers, and having once known my father well. I remember old
Bowles as a boy, because he never used to speak without clearing
his throat first?'</p>

<p>'Here, Jim. Back in ten minutes.'</p>

<p>'Right. Withers was in a bank or the Lands Office, or
somewhere or other, and he had a great chum called Lomley, who
was an accountant and general kind of agent. One day he went up
to see Lomley, as was his custom when he got out at half past 4,
and there was a card with the legend on it, "Back in ten
minutes," so Withers waited the ten minutes, but deuce a sign of
Lomley. Just as he was turning away up came a nice-looking,
elderly lady, and stopped at Lomley's door and read the card.</p>

<p>'"Have you been waiting long, sir?" she asked Withers.</p>

<p>'"Neatly a quarter of an hour, madam."</p>

<p>'"Then its no good my waiting," she said, and taking out her
card, case, she wrote something on a card and pushed it
underneath the door.</p>

<p>She'd scarcely gone before up came a red-faced man, and he
asked Withers the same question. Then the man swore, and he too
wrote something on a card, pushed it under the door, gave the
door a terrific kick, and stumped off. Thinking it no good
waiting, Withers followed his example.</p>

<p>'Next afternoon Withers, having in vain waited at his diggings
all the evening expecting Lomley to turn up, went once more to
the office. There was the card still, "Back in ten minutes," and
there was the elderly lady and the red-faced man, and the latter
was more furious than ever.</p>

<p>'He banged at the door, and shouted through the keyhole, "Hie!
Lomley, you're in there all the time. You know you are. I can see
your coat tail through the keyhole quite plain. I wouldn't skulk
in a corner if I were you. Come out and show yourself. It's more
than ten minutes since yesterday afternoon."</p>

<p>'Just then Withers noticed that the old lady was crying
nervously, so he got the red-faced man to desist, and took the
old lady downstairs and put her in a cab, for she was quite
hysterics.</p>

<p>'"Oh, sir," she said, "do you think that Mr. Lomley has run
away, for if he has I'm ruined," and she began to cry, and
Withers, who was very soft-hearted, assured her that Lomley must
be sick with typhoid, and had forgotten to send in, or he had
been run over by a tram and had both legs cut off, or been bitten
by a shark, which would account for it all. He had a happy knack
of cheering people up had Withers.</p>

<p>'When he got back he found the red-faced man dancing a
combination of a can-can and a war-dance on the landing.</p>

<p>'"Look here, sir!" he snouted, "if you come across that
scoundrel Lomley, just you tell him that I've gone to get a
warrant out for him. You know me?"</p>

<p>'"I'm hanged if I do," replied Withers.</p>

<p>'"Well, he does, at any rate. Tell him that Jonas Thresher has
taken a warrant out for him," and he went down three stairs at a
time.</p>

<p>'"Lomley seems to have got into a mess somehow, but I hope he
has not made away with any of that poor old lady's money."</p>

<p>So thought Withers, as he waited on the landing, and he
determined to wait for a bit, as, if Lomley had been up to any
hanky panky tricks, he would probably come in when he saw the
coast clear.</p>

<p>'It was winter time, and dusk soon after 5, and Withers was
just thinking what a fool he was hanging round there in the cold,
when, sure enough, he saw Lomley coming along the corridor.</p>

<p>'"You're a pretty fellow," he said when he got close, "there's
been half Sydney up here looking for you."</p>

<p>'"Couldn't help it," returned Lomley in a queer, hoarse
whisper. "Had an important engagement on; bound to keep it."</p>

<p>He took the latchkey out of his pocket: and opened the office
door. It was much lighter inside the office, and Withers noticed
that his friend's neck was discolored.</p>

<p>'"What's up with your throat," he asked.</p>

<p>'Lomley pulled out his handkerchief and fastened it round his
neck. "Got bad cold," he said in the same hoarse whisper, "had
mustard plaster on."</p>

<p>Now it didn't look a bit like the back of a mustard plaster,
even if it was usual to put one round one's throat, but Withers
said nothing about it.</p>

<p>'"Look here, old man," he went on, "there's been two people
here, wanting to see you badly. One, a very nice old lady, and
the other, a regular firebrand, who has gone to get out a warrant
for you, said his name was Jonas Thresher."</p>

<p>'Lomley laughed somewhere down the pit of his stomach.</p>

<p>'"That's just what I came back for," he said. "If you see the
old lady, her name is Mrs. Bransher, you tell her that her money
is all right&mdash;or nearly so. It was paid into her account
yesterday in the Bank of New South Wales. As for Jonas Thresher,
just you tell him to serve his warrant on me halfway between
Manly and Narrabeen, on the left hand side of the road.
Remember!"</p>

<p>'And he leaned over and stared hard at Withers.</p>

<p>'"Here," cried Withers, jumping up, "don't make such horrid
faces at me!" for Lomley's eyes were bulging out of his head, and
his tongue was lolling out all swollen.</p>

<p>'Withers stepped back in alarm, and found himself in the cold,
dark corridor again, and the door of the office was fast shut and
locked. You may be sure that Withers lost no time in getting
home.</p>

<p>'Next morning he informed the police, and they searched the
bush and found Lomley hanging from a tree, having been dead two
days. His affairs we're all abroad, and it was either suicide or
bolt with him. Withers did not know what to do about the old
lady, as he didn't want his experience to be made known. So he
wrote her an anonymous letter, telling her where her money was;
but he feels quite certain in his own mind that it was the
red-faced man's money Lomley had paid in to make up the old
lady's that he had embezzled.</p>

<p>'The worst of it was that the room was haunted ever after. No
matter who took it, it was always the same. Every one who came on
business always saw a card up, "Back in ten minutes."</p>

<p>'Now this was outrageous. A lawyer took the rooms, his clients
came, saw the notice "Back in ten minutes," went away, came back,
same old notice, left in disgust for another lawyer&mdash;just
the same with everybody else. Could do no business, no matter
what time people came; always they saw "Back in ten minutes"
written on a card in beautiful round hand, for Lomley wrote a
splendid hand. So there was nothing left but to let the room as a
storeroom at half price.'</p>

<p>'There's a moral in that story, Jim,' I said, 'that Sydney
people might take home. If you stick up "Back in ten minutes,"
mind&mdash;'</p>

<p>'You come back in ten minutes, or it might end in you hanging
yourself,' interrupted Jim.</p>

<h2><a id="ch28"></a>28. &mdash; WICKED BENSON</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, 29 Feb 1896</h3>

<p class="first">
'I ONCE knew a ghost,' said Jim, 'who had the most
disagreeable habit of any ghost I ever came across.'</p>

<p>'Whose ghost was it?'</p>

<p>'Ah! that was the question. Some said one thing, some another,
but, at any rate, it turned out to be wicked Benson's, and this
spectre cost the owners of the station a lot of money, for they
had to shift the homestead in consequence of it.'</p>

<p>'What was the objectionable habit?'</p>

<p>'Used to pull the bedclothes off you at night. On a cold night
it was very nasty to wake up shivering, and find your blankets in
a heap on the floor. It used to come into the men's hut after a
hard day's work, when they were all fast asleep, just shout 2
o'clock in the morning, and yell out, "Now then, daylight! Tumble
up!" And off would go the blankets right and left. But that was
not by any means the worst of it. Once there was a governess
going up to the next station, and they didn't tell her about the
ghost, for fear of frightening her, so in the middle of the night
there was an awful shriek, and, when they rushed in, there was
the poor girl sobbing and crying, vowing that, a man had come in
and pulled the bed-clothes off her, and then she went off into
hysterics. Fortunately the super, of that time was a married man,
and his wife managed to calm the girl down, although she never
believed that it was a ghost that did it.</p>

<p>'Then the bank manager's wife, who came out an a visit from
the township, had a like experience, and there was war to the
knife over it.</p>

<p>'At last, the owners determined to shift the homestead, things
were getting so unpleasant, so it was done, and only a few old
huts, not worth worrying about, were left. The ghost must have
had a lonely time of it, for his only relaxation was when a
chance traveller came along and camped there for the night. He
had great sport once, I believe, when two swaggies camped there,
and each one accused the other of pulling the blanket off him,
until at last they came to blows. Many a blowhard went there
determined to find out all about it, but they all failed, until
at last one man succeeded. This is how he managed it. He was an
ingenious fellow with a mechanical turn, and he set to work and
fixed up a complicated arrangement of lanterns&mdash;dark
lanterns&mdash;with slides that worked easily. And these he
connected with thin wire so that, if the lanterns were solidly
fixed down, one pull would open the lot. He rigged up his
machinery in the day time, and then, when night came on, went to
bed in the middle of all his lanterns. Of course he stayed awake,
and about 12 o'clock felt the first tug at his blankets; he
pulled his string, and immediately there were bars of light all
over the place.</p>

<p>'Here! I say! Hang it, this is not the rules of the game.
You've blinded me,' said a voice.</p>

<p>'Ah! ah! my boy,' said the man. 'Come out into the light;
let's see who you are?'</p>

<p>Now this fellow was a plucky fellow, I know, because I was
splitting with his brother once, and his brother, the one who
married long Kelly's sister, he told me a story about him; at
least, I think it was about him. Anyhow, when he saw the object
that came out into the light, he nearly took to his heels. It was
a nasty, vicious-looking monkey, with a leer on him like a wicked
old man. However, he pulled himself together, and said, in as
steady a voice as he could command:</p>

<p>'Who the devil are you?'</p>

<p>'I'm old Benson; used to be called "Wicked Benson" when I was
alive.'</p>

<p>'Who, or what, were you when you were alive?'</p>

<p>'You see, it was this way,' said the monkey, stealing out a
sneaking paw towards Teddy's blankets.</p>

<p>'Stop that,' said Teddy, 'or I'll say my prayers.'</p>

<p>'No; don't do that it's only force of habit; I can't help it
Mortmayne was my partner on this station&mdash;Benson and
Mortmayne. He was a young fellow, with some money, who had been
knocking about in the East&mdash;Malay Peninsula and those
places&mdash;and I persuaded him to buy a share in this station
and settle down, which he did. He had a monkey with him, and,
somehow, this monkey took a great fancy to me, and I taught him
all manner of tricks.'</p>

<p>'Pulling bedclothes off, for instance,' said Teddy.</p>

<p>'Yes, that was his chief accomplishment. Mortmayne and I did
not agree long. Although he was a new-chum, he soon found out
that he had been had&mdash;that he had paid double the value of
the run&mdash;so there was constant quarrelling between us, but
just then Mortmayne fell ill. Now, although under pretence of
completing some improvements, I had received and given a receipt
for the money, the transfer of Mortmayne's share had never been
properly completed, and it struck me that if he died and I found
the receipt amongst his papers and destroyed it, why I owned the
whole place again. One day when he was asleep I searched his
papers and found my receipt; then I was determined that his
illness should be fatal. He had malarial fever, and I started the
monkey to annoy him, pulling his bedclothes off two or three
times a night. This, of course, put him into a nervous fever, and
he grew rapidly worse. He begged me to chain the monkey up, and
let him have a night's sleep, but somehow that monkey was always
getting loose, and up to his old pranks at once. He entreated me
to send for the doctor, and I pretended to; but the doctor was
always fifty miles away, attending to a man with a broken leg, or
something of that sort I kept all the men away from him, and
Insisted on nursing him myself, I was so devoted to him. One day
I had left him by himself for an hour or two, and when I came in
he was gone. I tell you I gave a jump. Poor fellow! he had
managed to crawl out, intending, I suppose, to find one of the
men and get help, but the exertion had been too much for him, and
I found him lying a short distance away in a dead faint I carried
him back, but I could see that his end was near.</p>

<p>'Just before he died he mustered up enough strength to curse
me horribly. He prayed that, after I died, when my time came, I
might wander about this place in the shape of a monkey; pulling
the bedclothes off people, and playing other impish tricks. Then
he called me a murderer, and other hard names, and died. I was in
great distress, you may be sure, and called the men in at once,
sent for the doctor, and did everything a man should do.</p>

<p>'To cut it short, I destroyed the receipt, wrote home to this
people telling them of his death, and how sorry I was; forwarded
all his useless traps, and £5 4s 6d he had on him.</p>

<p>'He had no friends out here; but his sister came out to see
his grave, and to look after some money he had in the bank here.
Now, unfortunately for me, he had money in the bank which I knew
nothing of, and there was enough to divert suspicion, for his
folk were wealthy, and did not miss a thousand or two. In fact, I
overreached myself, for I should have done better to make friends
and nursed him well.</p>

<p>'I showed his sister the unsigned transfer, but somehow she
did not seem to like me, and, as for the monkey, she refused to
have anything whatever to do with him. What she said in the
township I don't know, but it was then I got the name of 'Wicked
Benson,' and I tell you I tried to deserve it. I shot the monkey
one day, and the next my horse stumbled and broke my neck. Ever
since I've been at this game, and I'm about tired of it. There
is, however, one thing can by done that would release me. If the
owners of the station would hunt up the papers, find out the true
value of the property, and pay the Mortmaynes back half the value
I might get a spell from this.'</p>

<p>Teddy burst out laughing.</p>

<p>'Well, you are the greenest old ghost I ever came across. Is
it likely that they will take that trouble to get rid of two or
three thousand pounds for your sake? Their title is not likely to
be disputed on the strength of a monkey's ghost. If that's all
there is to depend on, old man, you must enjoy yourself as you
are, as best you can.'</p>

<p>Wicked Benson looked mournful, but admitted the justice of the
remark.</p>

<p>'One thing more,' said Teddy. 'Why did that light racket
disturb you so?'</p>

<p>'I'm not exactly handsome you see, and object to being seen,
and you fixed it up so that I had to cross the light somewhere to
get away.'</p>

<p>'Good night. Benson; don't worry me any more,' and Teddy went
to sleep.</p>

<p>'There's no moral in that story, Jim, for what had the people
who were so annoyed ever done to the defunct Mortmayne?'</p>

<p>'That's true,' replied Jim.</p>

<h2><a id="ch29"></a>29. &mdash; THE INVISIBLE HORSEMAN</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, 7 Mar 1896</h3>

<p class="first">
THE moon was full and about half-way to the zenith, and the
tall trees on either hand threw black shadows across the bridle
track I was riding along. The shadows were abrupt and strongly
marked. Presently I heard the sound of a horse's footfall
following me, and glanced round to see who it was who was
overtaking me. To my surprise, I could see no one, although the
footfall had sounded quite close, and appeared to be travelling
smartly. Twice this occurred, and I began to fancy that I was
encouraging a hallucination, when the station lights came in
sight, and I rode gladly on, for a nasty superstitious feeling
was beginning to creep over me.</p>

<p>The station was owned by a widow&mdash;doubly
bereaved&mdash;for six months after the death of her husband her
only son, a promising young fellow of about 18 or 19, was killed
by his house falling on him only three miles from the station. I
was living on a neighboring station, so rode up to the bachelors'
quarters as a matter of course, and unsaddled and turned my horse
out. A hearty welcome, a nip of Mackay, and a rough but plentiful
feed, soon drove all thoughts of the supernatural out of my
brain.</p>

<p>I told the boys, however, what queer fancies had come into my
head on the road, and was astonished to see that they took it
gravely and seriously.</p>

<p>'That sound has been heard before,' said Doyle, the oldest man
there. 'It was on just such a moonlight night as this that young
Murdoch was killed, and at the very place where you heard the
footfall. He was cantering along, with the Mack boy riding
behind, when his horse tripped and rolled right over on top of
him. Killed him instantly.</p>

<p>'And is it only on moonlight nights like this that he
walks?'</p>

<p>'So they say; but that is not all the yarn. It was on that
same night that Mrs. Murdoch&mdash;you know what a severe woman
she is&mdash;found out that pretty little Maggie, the girl she
brought up with her half-servant, half-companion, was likely to
become a mother. She got in a terrible state, and when Maggie, in
her shame and terror, confessed that young Murdoch was the man,
she nearly went mad. Late as it was, she had the horses put in
the buggy, and told me to drive Maggie over to the
township&mdash;she would not have her on the place another night.
I protested, but it was useless, and when we got about three
miles away, for that bridle track is a short cut on to the road,
there was the dead body of the man who had sworn to marry her and
save her good name, lying in the moonlight on the dusty
track.</p>

<p>'I don't want to go through that scene over again, I can
assure you. The black boy had ridden in and raised an alarm, and
some men came out to bring the body in. I managed to quieten the
girl somewhat and pushed on to the township; but next morning she
was in, a raging fever, and what with that and having a dead
child born prematurely, poor Maggie nearly died too. She
recovered, however, and went away somewhere&mdash;nobody knew
where. Ever since the clatter of a horse can be heard coming
along that bridle track on moonlight nights. I don't know whether
Mrs. Murdoch has heard of it or not, but I expect she has.'</p>

<p></p>

<p>MRS. MURDOCH soon left the station which had such bitter
memories for her. Doyle and the other fellows had wandered off
one by one, until at last there were none of the old hands left.
The superintendent had occasion to hire a married couple, and
procured one in the neighbouring township. The man was a surly
ill-conditioned lout, whilst the woman was neat and tidy, with
the remains of past prettiness on her sad and worn face; they
were without children. They had not been there long before it was
found out that he was in the habit of beating his wife, and being
tackled by one of the other men about it, he showed up a cur. But
this did not help the poor woman, who probably received extra
punishment on the quiet in consequence of the man's
interference.</p>

<p>The story of the ghostly footfall had of course been handed
down, and it was noticed that often of a moonlight night the poor
silent woman would steal out and walk along the ghost's pad, as
it was called. One night, when it was almost as clear as day, one
of the men, smoking in the verandah of the men's hut, saw the
woman steal out along the ghost's pad. Shortly afterwards he
noticed the husband slink after her, and, fearing he meant
mischief, the man, who was the same one who had interfered
before, went after him.</p>

<p>The woman was standing looking expectantly along the road,
when her husband went up to her, and, putting his hand on her
shoulder, told her roughly to go home. She shrank away from, him
and he lifted his fist. At that moment the watcher heard the
approach of the invisible horse and rider. Whether the woman
really saw anything or not it was not possible to tell; but she
lifted her hands up and her face was transformed with joy. As for
the husband, he gave one glance in that direction, then took to
his heels and ran home.</p>

<p>'After that the woman was free to wander out to the ghost's
pad whenever she liked, but it did not alter her husband's
behavior to her when on the station. It was about 12 o'clock one
night when the whole homestead was awakened by a shriek of mortal
terror. It came from the room off the kitchen where the couple
slept. Hastening there they found the woman with her face bruised
and bleeding from a blow, standing half-dressed in the middle of
the room and the man extended on the floor senseless.</p>

<p>'The tale told by the woman was that her husband had
quarrelled with and struck her. That then something, she knew not
what, had come between them, and her husband had fallen to the
floor, uttering the cry they had heard. When the man came to his
senses he could tell nothing, excepting that he admitted having
struck his wife and being immediately felled by what, he said,
was a red hot fist. Strange to say, there was now visible a
distinct burn on his temple where he said he had been struck.</p>

<p>'The story was very strange. The poor woman had not the
strength to strike such a blow, and the man could not have
inflicted it himself. The mystery was never solved, but the man
became different after that; less violent, but more taciturn and
sullen. Some months after that a distant shot heard in the middle
of the night roused one or two sleepers whose rest was light, but
nobody took the trouble to rise and investigate the matter. In
the morning the husband waited on the super, and told him that
he had accidentally shot his wife during the night.</p>

<p>'His story ran that he had followed his wife, suspecting that
these visits of hers to the ghost's pad were only a screen for
covering an illicit love affair. He saw his wife seated on a log
beside a young man or boy, who had his arm round her waist. That
he took aim and fired at this man, and that the bullet passed
through the man and struck his wife.</p>

<p>The body of the one-time pretty Maggie was found at the place
he described, and buried by the side of young Murdoch. And from
that date the tramp of the ghostly horse was heard no more.</p>

<p>The author of her death persisted in his story up to the
minute that the bolt was drawn and he dropped into eternity. He
avowed that the youth embracing his wife was no being of this
earth, for the charge had no effect on him at him. And the doctor
who had examined the corpse of the murdered woman told a strange
story that few could believe.</p>

<h2><a id="ch30"></a>30. &mdash; JONSON'S FLEA-BITTEN GREY</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, 28 Mar 1896</h3>

<p class="first">
DO you remember that grey horse of Jonson's? <i>said Jim</i>.
Maybe it was not in your time; at any rate his was the only
ghost-horse I ever saw or spoke to. Moreover, he was a very
exceptional horse. In the first place he was said to be one
hundred years old. Now you know the average age of a horse I
suppose? This horse, this flea-bitten grey of Jonson's had just
succeeded to his hundredth birthday when Jonson came in to
possession of him.</p>

<p>Greys get flea bitten with age, and this horse was about the
worst flea-bitten horse you ever clapped your eyes on. In point
of fact, he need not have been called a grey at all, except as a
matter of courtesy, and you must be civil to a horse
occasionally. Now, as I stated before, when Jonson got this horse
he was just one hundred years old.</p>

<p>How do you know that? This way. Jonson's brother married Sally
Parsons; he was a man I never liked, because, although be was a
hard smoker, he never carried any matches with him. What has
Sally Parsons's husband to do with it? Come to think of it, I
don't know, I was only refreshing my memory a bit.</p>

<p>Jonson got the horse from his father, and his father got the
horse from his father, and as both of them each lived for fifty
years, that made 100, didn't it, when Jonson got the
horse&mdash;Anyhow, that's how he reckoned it.</p>

<p>When I knew Jonson he was boundary-riding, and, like these men
often do, he got gloomy and out of sorts; used to be always
talking to himself. Most of these fellows who live all alone get
queer that way. One day he came to me and said: 'Jim, what is the
best thing to do with that horse?'</p>

<p>'Keep him till he dies or sell him; his keep doesn't cost you
anything.'</p>

<p>'Now,' he replied, scarcely heeding me. 'I ask you, as a white
man, is it natural for a horse to live over a hundred years. I
tell you it's preying upon me, and either that horse or myself
must succumb under the strain. Which is It to be?'</p>

<p>'Don't be a fool, Jonson,' I said. 'Go home and let the horse
be.'</p>

<p>He left me, remarking that there was bound to be trouble
between him and the horse soon, and I did not see anything more
of him for some time. About three weeks afterwards he came to me
again, and sat down by the fire; it was winter time.</p>

<p>'I had to do it,' he remarked, as he knocked his pipe out, 'I
tried all I knew to get that horse to talk, but it was no
good.'</p>

<p>'To get him to talk! Do horses generally talk, then?'</p>

<p>'No, not as a rule, but a horse 100 years old ought to be able
to. Just fancy all he could remember about the colony. Why he
would have made my fortune. Think I was going to lose that. Not
me.'</p>

<p>'So you killed him?'</p>

<p>'Yes, it was necessary, there was nothing else to be
done.'</p>

<p>'Why necessary?'</p>

<p>'I keep telling you. That horse would not talk. He used to
grin at me, and try and express his ideas that way. But I
couldn't understand him. No, that horse mistook his vocation. He
was meant for a man.'</p>

<p>'Well, Jonson, you're simply a common-place kind of idiot. You
could have got a fiver for that horse, old as he was.'</p>

<p>'Perhaps I am. Never mind, that horse had to talk or die; and
he was obstinate&mdash;and died.'</p>

<p>Jonson got up, kicked my dog, and started home.</p>

<p>I knew what was the matter with him after I had meditated over
his case a bit. The ghost of his horse was haunting him, and
making things lively. Now listen, I love ghosts; they are
twelve-fig tobacco to me; so I thought I would go and camp with
Jonson for a few days, and find out what was really the matter.
Jonson had a dog, a bad dog in every day. He could eat strychnine
bait without a wink.</p>

<p>This dog and the flea-bitten grey had never been friends. The
dog considered the horse too old, and the horse thought the dog
too young. I have my suspicions that the dog prompted Jonson to
the killing of the horse, but I couldn't bring it home to him.
This dog was quite altered. He would constantly start and shiver,
and give little yelps and howls. Jonson used to kick him for it,
and when I found out the real cause I actually pitied the dog,
bad as he was.</p>

<p>The shade of that old horse used to come round and worry the
life out of that dog. He'd insist on his listening to his yarns,
and when the dog did not laugh in the right place, he'd suddenly
materialise himself, and kick the dog. The dog never had a
chance, for before he could get a bite in the horse was a ghost
again. One second he was a materialised horse, kicking a dog,
hard; the next he was a spectre, and it's no good biting a
spectre. What between, the materialised kicks outside and
Jonson's kicks inside, it was not a fair deal at all.</p>

<p>I made up my mind to interview this ghost and try and induce
him to stop his visits, for Jonson was getting decidedly loony.
So, one moonlight night I went outside about the time that Jonson
said the horse usually came. The ghost turned up to time, but for
a long time he would only grin at me, and go off into a horse
laugh. At last I asked him what the joke was.</p>

<p>'I'm laughing at that fool, Jonson,' he said. 'The ass thought
I was a hundred years old when he killed me.'</p>

<p>'Well, everybody thought so,' I said, on behalf of Jonson.
'Didn't you belong to his grandfather?'</p>

<p>'Bah! I wasn't twenty when he killed me. Besides, Jonson never
had a grandfather.'</p>

<p>'But he must have had some sort of a grandfather,' I
suggested.</p>

<p>'Yes, if you put it that way, of course he had, but I don't
suppose he was anything to blow about, or that he ever owned a
horse in his life. But what do you want interfering here for? I'm
enjoying myself, which is more than I did when I was alive.'</p>

<p>'I tried my best to get Jonson to let you alone,' I replied.
'He was a bit off before, but if you keep this racket up I'm
quite sure he'll go clean cranky.'</p>

<p>'Serve him right; but can you suggest any other kind of
amusement?'</p>

<p>I thought for a bit, and then his kicking the dog put an idea
into my head. 'You could have had great fun on the road,' I said.
'You could materialise yourself and eat up the bread and sugar
and salt in the travellers' camps, and have all manner of high
jinks.'</p>

<p>'Never thought of it,' said the ghost. 'Tell Jonson I won't
worry him any more, but that I shall have an occasional kick at
that dog.'</p>

<p>As he spoke he gradually faded away.</p>

<p>I went back and told Jonson of my success. He was very
grateful; owned up that the ghost horse had been preying on his
nerves, and that he felt like a new man.</p>

<p>In spite of all that, the ungrateful brute turned dog on me in
the end.</p>

<p>I told you that Jonson's brother married Sally Parsons. I knew
she had something to do with the yarn, and this is where she
comes in. She and her husband were the first to see the horse.
They were driving home one night in a spring cart, and it was
bright moonlight. Jack Jonson had a drop or two in him, and he
suddenly saw two horses in front of him.</p>

<p>'Why, dash my buttons!' he said, 'I'm not so bad as all that.
Wake up, Sally!' for Sally was nodding.</p>

<p>Sally opened her eyes, but there was no horse there, and she
called him a drunken hog, and wished she'd never married him,
when she had plenty of better offers, and cried and went to sleep
once more. There was the horse again.</p>

<p>Jack Jonson rubbed his eyes.</p>

<p>'Dash my buttons,' he said again, 'if it isn't Teddy's old
grey.'</p>

<p>As I say, he had a drop in him, and before that horse could
dematerialise himself he'd given him a stinging cut with the
whip. The old grey rattled his heels against the horse in the
shafts, and nearly knocked the whole caboodle over.</p>

<p>Sally woke up, and gave Jack a bit of her tongue for driving
over a stump, and they quarrelled all the way home, so much so,
that when Sally's baby was born, folks said it used to neigh
like a horse in its cradle.</p>

<p>This game continued, everybody driving along that, road on a
moonlight night would see two horses instead of one, or three
instead of two, as the case, might be. When they got home and
told the story to their wives they were accused of being mops and
brooms; and the whole of the married population in the district
were soon at loggerheads. How that wicked old ghost must have
chuckled.</p>

<p>Now, most of them recognised the spectral appearance as
Jonson's flea-bitten grey, and, in consequence, there was much
indignation against Jonson for killing the horse, which, as the
nuisance increased, came to a head, and a large number of people
interviewed Jonson, to inform him that he must either get rid of
the ghost or go himself.</p>

<p>Then it was that he played dog on me. He told them that it was
all my fault, and that I had invited the ghost of the old grey to
play these tricks, so they transferred their attentions to
me.</p>

<p>I did my best, I begged and entreated that old shade to give
up his tricks, but it was no use. He said he was enjoying
himself, and meant to keep it up; so I had to come away. I was
sorry, too, for it was a splendid district for ghosts. What
became of the dog? Oh, he died. Whether Jonson killed him or the
horse kicked him to death I don't know.</p>

<h2><a id="ch31"></a>31. &mdash; JIM'S DEVICE</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, 13 June 1896</h3>

<p class="first">'WERE you ever in love, Jim?' I asked.</p>

<p>'In love! I should smile. The first girl I ever got real,
downright shook on was Polly Oldfield. Old Oldfield kept a bush
pub, and ran a small farm as well. I really believe I should have
married Polly only for her mother. Not that her mother was
against it for I was doing well at the time, carrying; but she
was so stout. She could scarcely waddle in and out of the bar,
and the thought struck me that probably Polly would grow like
her. At that time Polly was a nice slim girl, but not too slim.
She had eyes like sparks, and a complexion like a red sash and a
white shirt. She was a downright pretty girl, and there were
plenty of fellows after her; but I felt mighty certain that I had
the best show, and could have gone in and won only for that
thought, and that kept haunting me. It tormented me so, that one
day I asked old Oldfield, in a chatty kind of way, whether Mrs.
Oldfield had always been so stout. He laughed.</p>

<p>'Lord, man, when we were married she was just the image of our
Polly.' He went into his bedroom behind the bar, and came back
with one of those tin things they used to do a long time ago,
before they photographed like they do now.
Dog&mdash;something.'</p>

<p>'Daguerreotype,' I suggested. 'Yes; that's the ticket. Well,
in this old picture Mrs. Oldfield was certainly as slim and
nice-figured as Polly. That decided me, but I couldn't back out
at once&mdash;it would look mean. Besides, it would seem as
though I was frightened of the other fellows. So I just went on
the same as ever and bided my time. It soon came. There was a
long slab of a fellow called Watkins. Let's see. His brother got
into trouble about some horses, and the judge said that he was a
disgrace to humanity. No; hold on! That was not Watkins. That was
Doolan&mdash;for killing one of his working bullocks with an axe.
O yes, he said that he left the court without a stain on his
character. Well, this yer long Watkins, not the brother, was
always hanging round after Polly, and I think she encouraged him
a little, just to make me jealous, and although in my own mind it
was all off, still one doesn't like to see another fellow jump
his claim straight away.'</p>

<p>'Rather "dog in the manger" kind of thing, Jim.'</p>

<p>'Perhaps so; but anyhow, it's human nature. Watkins and I
never could hit it, and one day when I went into the bar and
found them with their heads together across the counter I felt
mad. I asked for a drink rather huffy, and she looked up mighty
saucy and said, "In a moment, Jim." I waited&mdash;and then, as
she did not attend to me, I stalked out. I heard her call "Jim!"
but I paid no attention. I went over to my camp and sulked. But
that did not do any good except to make me think what an ape I
was. Here was the very opportunity I was looking for to fall out
with Polly, and I was not taking advantage of it. You see it was
this way: I wanted to break with Polly, but yet I didn't want
Watkins to remain master of the field. So I smoked six pipes on
end, and then an idea came to me. I got up and sauntered auto the
bar again. Watkins had gone by that time, and Polly was pouting
behind the counter.</p>

<p>'"Father in, Miss Oldfield?" I said.</p>

<p>'"No," she returned; "what is it?"</p>

<p>'"Oh, I wanted a drink, that's all."</p>

<p>'She said I was a brute ('So you were,' I interjected), and
began to cry. Of course I made it up sufficiently to stop that,
and then turned the conversation.'</p>

<p>'"Did you ever see anything of Watkin's relations?" I
asked.</p>

<p>'"There," she said; "I thought you were jealous of
Watkins."</p>

<p>'"Pooh, nonsense," I answered. "But did you ever see any of
his relations&mdash;seen his sister?"</p>

<p>'"No."</p>

<p>'"Ah, poor girl! She'd be a pretty girl only she has warts all
over her face. Fancy, one right on the tip of her nose, one on
her forehead one under one eye and a great big one on her cheek.
She never goes without a thick veil."</p>

<p>'"Poor dear thing," said Polly; "but can't she get rid of
them?"</p>

<p>'"No; she's tried everything, but they keep coming again. It's
in the family&mdash;in the blood. Watkins has them too, but he's
lucky, for they come on the back of his shoulders and his hands,
so they don't show much. Don't you shake hands with
him&mdash;warts is terribly catching."</p>

<p>'I saw Polly look at her own pretty hands, which were always
clean and well kept, and she shuddered.</p>

<p>'"And supposing Mr. Watkins married and"&mdash;there Polly got
very red&mdash;"had a family, would they all have warts?"</p>

<p>'"Of course they would&mdash;it's in the family. Watkins's
youngest sister has one on each side of her forehead just like
two horns growing."</p>

<p>'"Why doesn't she wear her hair low to cover them up?"</p>

<p>'"O, she's only a young girl yet. Perhaps she will when she
grows up. Awful infliction, isn't it?"</p>

<p>'Polly shivered. "I couldn't bear it," she said. "I'd take
<i>Rough on Rats</i>."</p>

<p>'Now, the worst of it was that I couldn't see the end of it
myself; but my mate was there and told me all about it. Watkins
did not come back that day, and the next morning I started on the
road. Well, my noble Watkins came in and wanted to take Polly's
hand, but she drew it back.</p>

<p>'"What's the matter?" demanded Watkins.</p>

<p>'"Thank you, Mr. Watkins; I don't want to catch any warts on
my hands."</p>

<p>'"Warts! Is the girl mad? I haven't got any warts on my
hands."</p>

<p>'"I suppose not, and you haven't got a sister with warts all
over her face, have you?"</p>

<p>'"No. By gum I haven't, because I haven't got a sister at
all."</p>

<p>'"Nor a young sister with a wart on each side of her forehead
like horns beginning to sprout?"</p>

<p>'"O Jerusalem the Golden! Don't I keep telling you that I have
no sisters at all?"</p>

<p>Polly curled her pretty upper lip, and went to the other end
of the bar to serve somebody, leaving Watkins in a taring rage,
fit to jump on his hat.</p>

<p>'"Who told you all these lies?" he demanded when Polly
returned to his end of the counter.</p>

<p>'"Never you mind. Just show me your hands." Watkins spread out
his great sunburnt paw.</p>

<p>'"There, I told you so," said the girl, triumphantly; "look
here, and here."</p>

<p>'"Them's not warts, girl; warts don't come there. Them's corns
from using the bullock whip."</p>

<p>'"O, very well, Mr. Watkins; call them corns if you like," and
Polly turned away. But he gave her no peace until she told him
who told her. "Didn't he say as well I had a wife and ten
children, and used to larrup them all round every night?"</p>

<p>'"No, he didn't."</p>

<p>'"He might just as well, for one would have been just as true
as the other. Wait till I get hold of Master Jim."</p>

<p>'This is the version my mate gave me. I knew it would have to
come to that one time or another, and at last we met. The fellows
said that I got the best of it, but I don't think it made much
difference who did, for we were both equally damaged. As for
Polly, she would not speak to either of us again. But that was
not where I felt it most. This happened more than ten years ago,
and Polly got married soon afterwards. I met her last year, and
expected to find her following her mother's track, but would you
believe it she had just as neat a figure as ever, allowing for
her being the mother of five. I was regularly had, and call it
downright mean.'</p>

<h2><a id="ch32"></a>32. &mdash; SHE DIDN'T DO</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, 20 Jun 1896</h3>

<p class="first">'SO that's the young lady, is it?'</p>

<p>The old gentleman calmly took out his spectacles as he uttered
these words, and putting them on, after a preliminary polish with
his silk handkerchief, he proceeded to leisurely inspect the
photograph he held in his hand.</p>

<p>The young man who had given it to him looked supremely
uncomfortable. He turned fiery red, and shifted uneasily about.
As though to prolong his agony the old gentleman examined the
photograph in every possible way. Held it far away from him, held
it close to him, held it in all kinds of lights, until at last he
gave it back to the eager hand waiting to secure it.</p>

<p>'She won't do, son,' was the sole remark.</p>

<p>'Won't do? What do you mean, governor?'</p>

<p>'Mean what I say&mdash;that she won't do. What did you say
her name was?'</p>

<p>'Jonson.'</p>

<p>'Spells it Jon, without the h?'</p>

<p>'Yes.'</p>

<p>'And has got some sort of a pre-name tacked on with a hyphen.
Seymour-Jonson or something?'</p>

<p>'Well, it's Howard-Jonson.'</p>

<p>'Thought so. She won't do, Bob, I tell you.'</p>

<p>Bob looked at his father curiously, and reproachfully.</p>

<p>'Do you mean, governor, that you will not consent to my
marriage with her when you have not even seen her?'</p>

<p>'That all depends upon circumstances. How old is she?'</p>

<p>'Not twenty. Her birthday is next October.</p>

<p>'Let me look at that portrait again.'</p>

<p>Bob reluctantly gave it to him.</p>

<p>'How well they re-touch these things nowadays,' the old fellow
went on; 'you, Bob, are just 22, and your lady love is 25, if she
is a day.'</p>

<p>Bob stamped his foot in impatient anger. 'I tell you she is
not twenty until next October.'</p>

<p>'How do you know?'</p>

<p>'She told me so herself.'</p>

<p>Old Beveridge went off in a roar of laughter; then he got up
and put his hand in a kindly manner on his son's shoulder.</p>

<p>'Look here, Bob, I do not want to hurt your feelings, but
really, you are too funny. Now I am going to act the stern parent
to this extent: Your engagement must last for twelve months, and
most of that time you are to spend up on that country I have just
stocked in Queensland. It will do you good to be busy putting the
place straight, and you will come to your senses sooner.'</p>

<p>'Never Governor. I shall love her till I die;' and imprinting
a passionate kiss on the picture Bob departed, while his father
sank into his chair convulsed with laughter.</p>

<p>'O lord! what a thing calf love is. Who would believe that Bob
was a really sensible young fellow at bottom,' he thought as he
wiped his eyes.</p>

<p></p>

<p>BOB Beveridge bade his sweetheart a tender farewell, and went
away north to form the new station. Now there was a very pretty
girl on the steamer, just sweet 17. She was returning from
Sydney, where she had been at school, to her parents, who Bob
found out owned a station not fifty miles from his father's
place, where he was bound. This constituted them neighbors at
once, and when they landed he was formally introduced to pa and
ma, and as their road was the same he accompanied them to their
station, where he stayed a few days before proceeding to his
destination.</p>

<p>Strange to say, he found himself at times forgetting all about
Miss Howard-Jonson, while Kitty Danver's pretty, saucy face was
constantly in the memory. He took himself to task for his
fickleness, and as his <i>fiance</i> took care to send him a
weekly letter, full of her heart's outpourings, his memory was
not allowed to flag. O, the bore those letters became in a month
or two; he quite dreaded the arrival of the mailman. At last they
grew shorter, and then, to his great surprise, not to say relief,
they stopped altogether. Fearful to break the spell, Bob took no
notice of this, and went on steadily with his work, and allowed
himself to dream of Miss Danver occasionally without any
self-reproach.</p>

<p>'The governor knew a thing or two, after all,' he mused at
times.</p>

<br>

<p style="text-indent:8%"><i><span class="smcap">My dear
Bob</span>,</i> ran a letter he received shortly afterwards,</p>

<p class="letter">
I may as well come to the point at once. I am going to get
married. Life has become too lonely altogether, so I am going to
give you a stepmother. It will make no difference to you, dear
boy, as I intend to make over all my station property to you
before the event comes off. I have plenty without that. Come down
at once, so that you may be at my wedding.</p>

<br>

<p>Bob scarcely knew what to think of the epistle. His mother had
died when he was quite young, so he did not feel any jealousy on
her account. His father had a right to please himself, and as
Miss Howard-Jonson seemed to have thrown him over, why, he was at
full liberty to urge his suit with Kitty Danver, now that he
would have all his father's station property.</p>

<p>So it was in a cheerful mood he packed his valise and started
south, stopping for a day or two at the Danvers' station on his
way.</p>

<p></p>

<p>'WHAT'S her name, governor? You forgot, to tell.'</p>

<p>'Her name is&mdash;hum! Jonson.'</p>

<p>Bob sat bolt upright, and stared at his father.</p>

<p>'She spells it Jon, without the h?'</p>

<p>'Well&mdash;yes.'</p>

<p>'And she's a Howard-Jonson, or something of that sort?'</p>

<p>'Yes, there is some little weakness of that kind, but she'll
be Beveridge shortly.'</p>

<p>'How old is she?'</p>

<p>'Confound your cross-examination. She was 20 last
October.'</p>

<p>'How do you know?'</p>

<p>'Hang your impudence. She told me so, of course.' Bob
yelled.</p>

<p>'She won't do, governor,' he spluttered out.</p>

<p>Beveridge jumped up in a towering rage. 'You graceless young
scamp I'll cut you off with a shilling; I'll&mdash;I'll&mdash;I
don't know what I won't do.'</p>

<p>But Bob only laughed the louder.</p>

<p>'Why, she's thirty-five, if she's a day,' he managed to get
out.</p>

<p>Finally peace was restored. Old Beveridge, it seems, had made
himself known to the Howard-Jonsons in order to see what the
young lady was like, and had himself fallen a victim to her
innocent wiles. The marriage duly came off, the bride meeting her
former youthful sweetheart with the utmost coolness.</p>

<p>'How the deuce could I have been such a fool as to get spooney
on that woman?' cogitated Bob, as he left the church. 'Why I
believe that she's old enough to be my mother.'</p>

<p>Bob was not long before he was back in Queensland, and had
followed his father's example ere many months had passed.</p>

<p></p>

<p>TWO years had fled, and one evening Bob and his young wife
were seated on the verandah, he smoking, and she retailing to him
all the wonderful, precocious doings of baby, during the day,
when a buggy was seen approaching, and an old gentleman descended
therefrom.</p>

<p>'Why, it's the governor!' cried Bob, jumping up and going to
meet him.</p>

<p>Beveridge, senior, kissed his daughter-in-law and grand-child,
then sank down in a chair, and remarked, 'I was right in the
first place, Bob, and so were you in the second. She didn't
do.'</p>

<p>And although he remained with them to the end of his days,
that was all they ever got out of him.</p>

<h2><a id="ch33"></a>33. &mdash; MAD MACGREGOR'S WOOING</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, 27 Jun 1896</h3>

<p class="first">
MAD MACGREGOR was worried. For the first time since his very
young days he was desperately in love. In love too with a saucy
chit of a young girl. So far, however, as little Kitty Fadden was
concerned, there was really nothing for him to worry about, for
she was as pretty, blithe, and bright as a goodhearted girl could
be: and, moreover, unless MacGregor blindly deceived himself,
evinced for MacGregor a most distinguished preference.</p>

<p>Now, this was all highly satisfactory, and it was not Kitty
who was worrying him. It was the very natural and commonplace
fact that she had a father. He was neither drunken nor
disreputable; far worse was there to fight against. He was a
C.M.G. and an M.L.C., and in the arrogance of his pride
considered MacGregor not by any means a fitting match for
Kitty.</p>

<p>Now, could a MacGregor, especially one who had the right to
spell his name Mac and not Mc, submit to be slighted by a C.M.G.,
mused MacGregor in his wrath, and then the image of sweet,
lovable, little Kitty came up, and he groaned, and cursed his
fate, and swore that the mighty M.L.C. should yet appreciate the
honor done him by a MacGregor wooing his daughter.</p>

<p>Fadden, the pompous, was also troubled. He had built great
hopes on, pretty Kitty mating a distinguished alliance, and now a
man, little better than a common selector, aspired to her hand,
and was&mdash;by her&mdash;the favored swain. Moreover, this
plain and simple man did not appear to rightly estimate the
worth of a C.M.G.cum M.L.C. He must be brought to his bearings,
thought Fadden in his turn.</p>

<p>The two men were neighboring squatters. That is to say, as
much so as men could be when one lived on and looked after his
small run and the other resided in Sydney and only came to his
big, mortgaged one occasionally. But Mrs. Fadden and family were
often sent to live on the station from motives of economy. Hence
the understanding between Kitty and Mad MacGregor.</p>

<p>The nickname of 'Mad' had been attained by MacGregor in
consequence of a tendency to dabble in scientific experiments.
During the big drought of 188&mdash;he frightened a year's growth
and seven bells out of every blackfellow in the district by
sending up fire balloons carrying explosives. He succeeded
admirably in burning down some miles of his own fences, and
getting into a lawsuit with Mudga Mudga Station for firing their
grass. Certainly he claimed that the heavy rain which fell a few
months afterwards was due to his public-spirited endeavors; but
even his best friends declined to admit this.</p>

<p>Not a soul, however, called him Mad MacGregor from any
ill-natured motive. All his eccentricity was of such a
good-humored kind, and he was so much the typical open-handed,
generous bushman that Mudga Mudga township was honestly proud of
Mad MacGregor, of Sunnymere. On the other hand, Mudga Mudga tried
its best to be proud of Fadden, C.M.G., who owned Mudga Mudga
Station, from which the township took its same. There is a
wonderful difference between liking a man spontaneously and only
trying to like him.</p>

<p>Fadden did nothing for Mudga Mudga township. He did not spend
a shilling in it if he could help it. He sent up cheap stores
from Sydney, and managed with a cheap superintendent. The super's
name was Winters, and, somehow it suited him. He was always
abjectly writhing under the threat of losing his billet if he did
not keep expenses down; and, therefore, was always engaged in the
desperate and heartbreaking task of making both ends overlap a
little. Consequently he was held in little esteem by the
townfolk, and despised by the men.</p>

<p>There were weak-minded people who held the belief that if was
all the fault of the wretched buffer, Winters, that the station
was worked on such miserly lines; and that if the C.M.G. only
knew of it things would be very different. These good gossips
were, therefore, mightily disappointed when Fadden, under stress
of financial circumstances, came up to live on the station, and
so pestered, pried, and interfered that Winters for the first and
only time in his life stood up straight and called his soul his
own.</p>

<p>Then the C.M.G. sacked him on the spot, and Winters was very
sorry for his one manly action: So was the C.M.G., for another
drudge like Winters was not to be got in a hurry. Pride stood in
the way of a reconciliation, and Fadden was in a fix. His only
son was an inborn larrikin, and would have only hastened the
disasters that Winters's parsimonious management had induced by
going to the extreme of prodigality. Fadden, M.L.C., therefore,
spread out his legs, and cursed his fate in his turn. Suddenly a
brilliant idea struck him.</p>

<p>MacGregor was the best station manager in the district, The
flourishing condition of his own little place proved this; whilst
Mudga Mudga, with money begrudged and cheap labor in every
department, was going down hill rapidly. Could MacGregor arrest
the descent? But that would mean Kitty. Would it? Fadden
flattered himself that he could get to windward of any man; so
MacGregor was shortly greatly astonished by receiving a polite
note inviting him over to dinner. After the meal the great man
enlarged on his troubles, and the reputation of the unhappy
Winters was offered up as a burnt sacrifice. Of course, MacGregor
knew all about it before. Who does not know all about his
neighbours' affairs? The worn-out ewes, the patched-up fences,
the overstocked paddocks, and the shoddy attempts at conserving
water were as well known to him as to the discharged Winters, and
when Fadden asked him feelingly as a friend and neighbor if he
could help him by looking after things a bit while the C.M.G.
hunted up another super, MacGregor unsuspectingly consented. Of
course, he thought it would mean nothing else than Kitty, and to
gain her he would have undertaken the management of more than one
station, no matter how handicapped.</p>

<p>Satisfied with the arrangement, and inwardly determining to
outwit MacGregor in the end, Fadden departed, taking with him his
wife and family, much to MacGregor's disgust, as he had
confidently anticipated Kitty's presence on the station, and many
a stolen meeting. He felt inclined to throw up the job on some
pretence or other; but being a proud man of punctilious honor, he
determined to keep his word. As some compensation, Fadden sent
him up his scapegrace son to live on the station, and
reform&mdash;if possible.</p>

<p>MacGregor soon made short work of the cub, and speedily
reduced him to an outward semblance of order. When he eventually
found out that Kitty was the cub's favorite sister, and that he
was always ready to talk about her, he did not resent his
presence so much; and the cub, who respected and liked MacGregor,
in spite of his iron hand in ruling him, soon guessed what was
up, and became his ally.</p>

<p>Over six months had elapsed, and the time of the Mudga Mudga
annual show and races was approaching. MacGregor had been lucky.
Of course, sufficient time had not yet elapsed for him to
completely rectify the doings, or misdoings, of the past; but, at
any rate, the place was presentable; and, moreover, it had been a
good season, and wool had gone up in price. The financial outlook
before Fadden, C.M.G., was brighter than it had been for some
time. Things had turned out just as he wished, and he was in a
position to pay MacGregor for what he had done, and at the same
time to disillusion him as regarded Kitty, who had captivated the
fancy of the son of a wealthy Sydney merchant with great interest
and influence in matters political, and whose son as his
son-in-law would be of assistance. Besides, he had been one of
the commissioners in a Royal Commission to inquire into the
reason why the postal pillars of Sydney were looked upon as
unsightly and ugly, and anticipated a few more such appointments.
Under these circumstances the idea of MacGregor as a son-in-law
was preposterous.</p>

<p>The day for the show drew near, and needless to say that
MacGregor and Kitty had met more than once. One day Fadden,
C.M.G., was taking a ride round his boundary fence, which on one
side marched with Sunnymere, when he spied two saddled horses
tied to the wire fence some distance away&mdash;one on one side
of the fence and one on the other. But the riders were on the
same side, and one wore a riding skirt. There was a patch of
scrub handy, and Fadden tied his horse up in it, and approached
the unsuspecting couple, his daughter Kitty and MacGregor. He was
close to them before they saw him.</p>

<p>'Well, Mr. MacGregor,' he said, 'what am I to think of
this?'</p>

<p>'Nothing to be ashamed of,' returned MacGregor, haughtily.
'Miss Fadden and I are engaged to be married, and when we settled
for my bringing your station into working order I intended to ask
her for my wife in sole return.'</p>

<p>He took Kitty's hand, and drew her to his side.</p>

<p>'Very generous of you; supposing we go now, and have this
settlement. There is a gate not far from here, I think, where you
can get your horse through.'</p>

<p>'I ought to know that,' MacGregor was beginning, when a look
and a hand-squeeze from Kitty stopped him. They rode together to
the homestead in almost a complete silence. Arrived there, Fadden
asked MacGregor to accompany him to his office, and they were on
their way there, Kitty accompanying them, when Fadden said,
'Kitty, you can go to your room. What I have to say is
private.'</p>

<p>Kitty halted rebelliously; she was not the yielding,
hysterical kind of young woman.</p>

<p>'Father, please understand that I am engaged to Mr. MacGregor,
and do not 'intend to break it off. As for marrying that young
Bragazon, at whose head you have been throwing me lately, I would
sooner marry our Chinese gardener.'</p>

<p>She turned to her sweetheart, and they exchanged an honest and
defiant kiss. MacGregor followed the unmoved Fadden into the
office, and Kitty marched off, majestically holding her riding
skirt up. Fadden seated himself at his writing desk. MacGregor
took a chair. The C.M.G. wrote out a cheque, and handed it to
him.</p>

<p>'Mr. MacGregor,' he said, 'you have fulfilled my expectations
to the utmost, and I thank you heartily for it. I regret that I
cannot countenance the little bit of sentiment existing between
my daughter and yourself; but it will soon pass, believe me.
Meantime, Kitty's hand is being sought by Mr. Arthur Bragazon,
and the marriage will, I trust, shortly take place.'</p>

<p>'I'm &mdash;&mdash; if it will!' said Mad MacGregor, slowly
rearing up his lengthy form. Deliberately he tore Fadden's cheque
into fragments, and threw them on the desk, not deigning to look
at the amount.</p>

<p>'Mr. Madden,' he went on, 'I have already, told you that for
rescuing your station from bankruptcy, and making it a paying
concern, I desire nothing more than you daughter's hand. As for
your marrying her to a low, dissipated cad like Bragazon, whose
father was a decent, honest, working man who worked himself up
from hawking tripe to being a wealthy butcher, no shame to him,
but to the son who is now ashamed of him, I tell you that you
will never do it, Kitty will never consent, and as soon as she is
of age we shall get married.'</p>

<p>'I think we had better close this discussion,' said Fadden,
who had turned both red and white during the speech.</p>

<p>'I agree with you,' returned MacGregor, and marched out of the
room. Outside he saw nothing of Kitty, but met young Fred, the
erstwhile cub.</p>

<p>'Fred,' he said, 'come with me. Now, you must confess that
I've made a man of you. I've taught you to give up those beastly
cigarettes and smoke a decent pipe, and to knock off habitual
swearing, and wanting a nip every half hour.'</p>

<p>'You have,' said the reformed one, squeezing his arm.</p>

<p>'Well, the governor has distinctly refused me, and Kitty is
going to be persuaded into marrying that young snob Bragazon. You
must stick by us and help us.'</p>

<p>'I will, through thick and thin. Kitty shall never many that
Bragazon. I know too much about him.'</p>

<p>They parted at that, and MacGregor went home feeling slightly
comforted. The next day was the first day of the show, and
MacGregor, who was, of course, one of the judges, had his work
cut out all day; but he defiantly took Kitty into lunch, thanks
to a clever manoeuvre of Fred's. The races were the third day,
and poor Fred got a nasty spill in the hurdle race. He was taken
to the local hospital, and gradually grew worse. MacGregor and
Kitty often met at his bedside, and Fadden was deeply cut up at
the prospective loss of his only son, who, under MacGregor's
tuition, had become a different man.</p>

<p>One day, when he was alone with his father, the boy said,
feebly, 'I don't think I shall last out tomorrow. It would make
me so happy if you would agree to Kitty and MacGregor getting
married. What will become of Mudga Mudga? If I had lived I could
have kept it improving with MacGregor's help. Now it will go to
the dogs again in a year or two, and I shouldn't be surprised if
MacGregor bought it.'</p>

<p>Fadden felt greatly moved at his dying son's request, and was
struck by the shrewdness displayed, by the remarks on the
station. After all, Fred's petition would be an excuse for his
pride to accept terms; and he gave his consent before
leaving.</p>

<p></p>

<p>THERE was no sprightlier guest at the wedding than young Fred
Fadden, who never had the least intention of dying when he
swindled his father into consenting to Kitty marrying the man of
her choice. Mudga Mudga prospered and flourished, and Fadden has,
after all, no reason to regret his bargain, as young Bragazon is
now peeling potatoes for a living.</p>

<h2><a id="ch34"></a>34. &mdash; JIM'S SECOND EXPERIENCE OF IT</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, 4 Jul 1896</h3>

<p class="first">
'I HAD an awful time with my second sweetheart,' said Jim.
'She was a widow, and one of the Plugberrys on her mother's side,
and very proud she was at it. The Plugberrys were a very old
family in that part; the old man who first settled there was one
of the most talented cattle-duffers of that period, and founded
the family fortunes, although they never speak of him in the
present-day. Elizabeth Plugberry married a man called Mottles,
with a nice selection, and, also descended from good old stock.
So when Elizabeth was left a young widow. I thought I couldn't do
better than hang my hat up there and I did so.'</p>

<p>'Things went smoothly enough at first and Elizabeth was all
that could be desired, and didn't put on any frills, at least,
not a great number so to speak, until Tom Lucas appeared on the
scene. She played one of us off against the other very nicely
indeed; it takes a widow to do that sort of thing to perfection;
until one day I called and found her steeped and soaking in
tears. Regular five inches in twenty-four hours!'</p>

<p>'"Jim Parks," she said; "go, leave me! I never could have
believed it of you. Never! never! never!" And off she went again,
boo-hooing.</p>

<p>'"Elizabeth," I replied, "What is the meaning of this? Answer
me at once."</p>

<p>'"To think that a Plugberry should come down to think
seriously of marrying a man whose hands are red with gore."</p>

<p>'"Nonsense," I cried; "This calumny is the work of some
jealous lover rival. I'll wash my hands in his gore, you
bet."</p>

<p>'"Go away. Go away!" was all I could get out of her, so I
tried another tack.</p>

<p>'"You did think seriously of marrying me, when I asked you,
then?"</p>

<p>'She gave a wild shriek, threw herself back and drummed
frantically with her heels. "To think of dragging my secret from
me thus!" she screamed, and the red-headed girl came in from the
kitchen and called me a "brute" and a "beast," and her, "a poor
dear." So I had to leave.</p>

<p>'I could make, nothing out of it. I was in what we call a
'quandairy.' I suspected Lucas, but could not prove it; only at
the risk of another fit of hysteria? There was something about
Lucas I could not recollect. His face was familiar to me, and
yet, I could not place it. Some two days passed, and I could
think of nothing to make the situation clearer, when I bethought
me of the red-headed girl. It was dangerous work, for the
red-headed one might at any time affect to misunderstand me and
believe I was making downright love. Moreover, I am a bit
superstitious, and they always had a white horse in the home
paddock. Now, of course, you know that when you meet a redheaded
girl you are bound, to see a white horse directly afterwards; and
if you meet a white horse you are bound to see the girl. Now this
forebodes trouble to the man who sees it, and as it happened that
the red-headed girl had a habit of passing most of her time at
the back kitchen door, and the white horse was a conspicuous
feature in the paddock, one always caught sight of them both. For
my part, I believe that when the red-polled girl was not visible
the white horse used to go and lie down and pretend that he was
an ant-bed. However, that's nothing to do with it. I saw the
red-headed girl, end, in the course of conversation, found out
that her one ambition in life was a pair of six-buttoned gloves.
If she could obtain those, and wear them two or three times in
public places, she would be content to die with the early
violets, with white lilies in her pallid hands and a choir of
angels hovering over her. I promised her a pair, and in turn she
told me that it was Tom Lucas who had told the widow that I had
shot somebody called "Old Towzer."</p>

<p>'I puzzled my brains over this second "quandairy" until at
last I began to recall things, and to remember who Tom Lucas was,
and where I had seen him before. Then the red-headed girl told me
that the new Methodist parson was making big running, and had
fairly cut out both of us. Now, everything was clear to me, and I
had determined on my course of action. Tom Lucas and myself
appeared at the widow's almost at the same time, when she was
just entertaining the parson at afternoon tea, which, as a
Plugberry, she understood was the proper thing to do.</p>

<p>'"Mr. John Parks," she said, "I have already asked you once to
leave my premises for good. Must I repeat the request?"</p>

<p>'"Of what do you accuse me?" I asked.</p>

<p>'"Let your conscience tell you. Do you know nothing of the
death of the late Mr. Towzer?"</p>

<p>'Both Lucas and I laughed.</p>

<p>'"What about Towzer?" I asked.</p>

<p>'"Did you not deliberately, and in cold blood, shoot that
unhappy man?"</p>

<p>'"Who told you?"</p>

<p>'"Mr. Lucas."</p>

<p>'"Well," I said, "he is worse than I am; for after I had shot
him, Tom, here, cut his throat."</p>

<p>'"Go, men of blood, go!" cried the parson, jumping up. "Do not
dare to pollute this good woman's innocent ears with a recital of
your crimes."</p>

<p>'Now, the parson just put his foot in it. If there's one thing
a member of the fair sex resents more than another it is to be
called a "good woman," or "a female." If you want something
straight at your head, address a woman as "my good woman," and
you'll get it. My colonial! The widow turned on the parson, and
gave him "what for" until she was tired. Tom and I resumed the
conversation.</p>

<p>'"Yes," I said, "Tom was the worst of the two&mdash;for after
we had killed Mr. Towzer, he suggested that we should skin him,
cut him up, take his remains on to the next pub, salt him and
dispose of, at least, two-thirds of his carcass. We did so. The
pub was kept by your uncle, Dick Plugberry, and you can ask him
if the old boy did not turn out very good eating."</p>

<p>'Elizabeth fell back in a faint, and the parson uprose. "Go,
men of blood, go! Do not any longer pollute the ears of this
lovely and afflicted lady, whose departed saint is scarce yet
cold in his grave, with vile accounts of your cannabalistic
orgies. Go, men of blood!"</p>

<p>'The men of blood went.</p>

<p>'Old Towzer was a working bullock of mine, and one day he
slipped in a deep, hard hit and broke his leg. There was nothing
to do but shoot the poor old fellow, and Tom, who was then
one-siding for me, suggested that, as he was in prime condition,
having been spelling for over six months before the trip, we
should bleed and quarter him, pack him on the waggon, and salt
him that night at old Plugberry's, who would probably take half
or more. We did so, and realised nearly all his market value.
What induced Tom to tell this yarn to the widow as though Towzer
was a man I had shot I don't know, but he was always on for a
joke, and, seeing that I had clean forgotten him, played it on me
for revenge.'</p>

<p>'Did you get the girl her gloves, Jim?' I asked.</p>

<p>'Of course, I did. Do you suppose: I'm not a white man? But,
owing to some mistake in the size, she so wrestled and fought
with them, and scratched her arms with a hairpin trying to button
them, that I am afraid they were quite in ribbons and completely
unpresentable.'</p>

<p>'And the parson?'</p>

<p>'Married the widow, and was soon convinced that he had not a
soul to call his own. I did hear, but I can't guarantee it, that
he eloped with the red-haired girl.'</p>

<h2><a id="ch35"></a>35. &mdash; THE DOWNFALL OF SMAILES</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, 11 July 1896</h3>

<p class="first">
'THE greatest blockhead I ever knew,' said Jim, 'was a man
called Smailes. I disremember his Christian name. It wasn't Jim
Smailes, because Jim Smailes was doing the first of his ten years
at he time; but let it pass at Smailes.'</p>

<p>'Yes, do, for Heaven's sake. I suppose Smailes is a blockhead
because he got the better of you in some way. I always notice
that when you come off second best the other man's a fool.'</p>

<p>'Well, I didn't come off second best this time, young man, you
bet. Smailes was desperately spoony on a little girl, with a
swell name, evidently taken, from a penny novel. What was it? O!
Aurelia&mdash;Aurelia Murphy; and if ever you saw a calf on two
legs, you saw Smailes when he was gazing at Aurelia, or Spuds, as
she was nicknamed. He never spoke, only stood and simpered at
her, and gave her all kinds of absurd presents&mdash;a whip lash,
an old matchbox, some faded old vegetables, or flowers, as he
thought them. Of course everyone was sniggering at this, and I
took it on myself to reason with Smailes, calmly and mildly. I
pointed out to him what a wretchedly imbecile son of a gun he
must be, what an utterly insane ass to suppose that a girl cared
about whip-lashes or old match-boxes, and such like trumpery. He
took it all quietly, and asked my advice as to what he should
give her. So I told him that all girls liked a bit of jewellery,
and advised him to give her a ring. What do you think the galoot
did? Bought her a great thick, silver ring, about as big as the
ring of a hobble chain. The poor girl took it, and said she would
wear it round her neck in remembrance of him, and he grinned and
chuckled all over, and squeezed his hat up to a ball, and
generally made an exhibition of himself. Now it struck me that
Aurelia had taken a fancy to me&mdash;'</p>

<p>'They all do. Jim.'</p>

<p>'Quite right; they do. So just to have a lark with Smailes I
encouraged her. It was pure generosity on my part, for I thought
it would bring Smailes up to the scratch. But it didn't at all.
The more I spooned Aurelia, the more Smailes seemed to think of
me.</p>

<p>'"Ah, Jim," he'd say, "I wishes I had your way with the women;
you can't believe how I envy your style." That's what he called
it&mdash;style! About as much style around you as there is in a
scrub Micky; but go ahead. Anyhow, style or no style, it fetched
Aurelia, and Smailes seemed to think that my success and his were
one and the same thing. At last he said, "Look here, Jim, would
you mind sounding the gal about me, because if she won't have me,
I'm blest if I don't stick up to the old woman." Aurelia's mother
was a widow. Naturally, this tickled me all to pieces; but honor
bright, I spoke to the girl, but she scorned the notion.</p>

<p>'"I cant abide him, Jim. Fancy&mdash;a man who gives a girl a
present of an old matchbox. No, not me."</p>

<p>'"Well, Aurelia, he's going to speak to your mother."</p>

<p>'"Like his impudence. Do you suppose mother would make me
marry a thing like that? No fear. I'll be there when he speaks to
mother!"</p>

<p>I saw the mistake Aurelia had fallen into, but of course I
wasn't going to explain matters; the joke was too good. So I told
poor Smailes that there was no hope for him. He heaved a sigh and
said he supposed it must be the old woman then. He was bound to
get in the family somehow. He asked me to go and back him up when
he demanded Mrs. Murphy's hand in marriage, and I consented. When
we got there we found Mrs. Murphy at home, and scarcely had we
said good-day than Aurelia came into the room with considerable
fire in her eyes.</p>

<p>'"Mrs. Murphy," commenced Smailes in a hesitating and timid
manner; then he looked at me as though he thought I ought to help
him out, and I did my level best. I remarked, "Mr. Smailes has
come on a rather delicate mission, Mrs. Murphy."</p>

<p>'"Yes," simpered Smailes, "very delicate mission."</p>

<p>Aurelia Spuds jumped up.</p>

<p>'"Now look here, mother, that gawk wants me to marry him and
I'd sooner die first! Here are your presents, Mr. Smailes, and
never speak to me again!"</p>

<p>She threw on the floor the whip-lash, the old matchbox, and
the great silver ring. Poor Smailes turned red and white and
white and red as she bounced out of the door.</p>

<p>'"It was you, Mrs. Spuds," he stammered, "that I came to ask
to marry me."</p>

<p>'I jumped up and made for the door too, and watched
proceedings from safety. Mrs. Murphy danced up to poor Smailes,
and commenced to cuff and scratch him, her face like raw beef.
That fool Smailes never had the sense to run for it, but stayed
there protesting and apologising, whilst she banged him and
shrieked for Aurelia to come and help her. I don't know how much
of his skin and garments he lost before he found sense to run.
But it did him good, for he had the savvy to get out of the
district that night.'</p>

<h2><a id="ch36"></a>36. &mdash; JIM'S LAST AND SERIOUS CASE</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i> Sydney, 1 Aug 1896</h3>

<p class="first">
'I CAME to the conclusion that widows knew too much,' remarked
Jim.</p>

<p>'There was a certain well-known coachman who held the same
opinion,' I replied.</p>

<p>'Was there? One of Cobb and Company's, I suppose. Well, there
is no doubt they are men of experience, and it was during the
only time I was coach-driving that the following love affair
happened to me. The regular driver broke his leg, and I took his
place while he was laid up. It was away in the New England
district, and a terribly rough bit of road it was for the most
part. They ran the line pretty, cheap, too, for the contractor
had taken it at a low figure, and as for the horses, I believe
they gave me all the outlaws they had while I was driving that
spell. They had no regular changing places, either; the horses
were left in the paddocks of the two or three stations we passed,
and sometimes the fellows would forget to bring them up, and I'd
have to go after them myself. I generally had a decent lot of
passengers, however, who'd always lend a hand, and mostly
bushmen, who knew their work, so I got along somehow.</p>

<p>'One trip I had four passengers&mdash;two ladies, a parson,
and a commercial. One of the ladles was a school mistress going
to take charge of a school, a tall girl, who wore spectacles; the
other was a farmer's daughter, at least a cane-grower, who'd been
over the range on a visit, and was on her way home&mdash;a smart,
pretty little girl she was too.</p>

<p>'Now the commercial was not a bad sort&mdash;most of them are
decent fellows; but, somehow, I didn't like the parson. He was
one of these finicking kind of pussy cats. The first thing he did
was to put his great-coat and a bag on the box seat, and stand
there watching them. I got up, after stowing the malls and
luggage, just to fix my way-bills, etc., before the horses were
put in, and the first thing I did was to hand the coat and hat
down again.</p>

<p>'"What are you doing coachman?" said the parson. "Let me
inform you that I have secured the box seat."</p>

<p>'"We've got a rough road ahead of us," I replied; "and the
ladies are coming up here. They'd be jolted to bits inside."</p>

<p>'"But I insist on my rights," he said, getting very red.</p>

<p>'"Know nothing about rights," I grunted; "I'm captain of this
ship."</p>

<p>'"I shall go to the office, and enter a complaint," he
said.</p>

<p>'"Better look sharp, or you'll lose your passage."</p>

<p>'Just then the girls came out. The commercial put them up on
the box, the traces were booked on, and the parson, still
grumbling, had to follow the commercial inside, or be left
behind.</p>

<p>'It was a lovely morning, and the first few miles of the road
was fairly good; and the girls seemed to enjoy it immensely. It
was the first time the school mistress had ever been on the box
seat of a coach, I think. As for the other one, she was as pert
as you please, and it was "Jim" this, and "Jim" that before we
were well out of sight of the township. This first team was the
only decent one on the line, and going down the range I let them,
out properly, and shook that parson up to rights. The commercial
told me that he was as white as his necktie. There are some very
awkward turns and sidings on that bit of the road, and I trotted
round them as fast as I dared; and when the parson looked out of
the window, and saw the off wheels just shaving the edge of a
neck-or-nothing go-down, he must have thought his time for glory
had arrived. The school mistress held on like grim death; but the
little one started singing.</p>

<p>'At twelve o'clock we changed horses at a small roadside
accommodation, house, and stopped to get something to eat.</p>

<p>'"I really must protest against such furious driving," said
the parson when he got out.</p>

<p>'"Call that furious driving?" said the commercial. "Jim came
down as steady as a hearse Why, Hell-fire Jack used to negotiate
it at a gallop all the way."</p>

<p>'Then he and I went in for a drink, and made it up to pull the
parson's leg, as they call it.</p>

<p>'While we had our meal the commercial kept talking about the
road ahead, and inventing a lot of names.'</p>

<p>'"Let's see, this is the worst stage of the lot There's the
Devil's Jump, and the Overthrow Siding, and Breakneck Slide on
it; isn't there, Jim?"</p>

<p>'"Yes," I said, "and Smash-up Gully, and Graveyard Flat."</p>

<p>'"I do trust you will-be most careful coachman," said the
parson; "and I will overlook that little affair of the box
seat."</p>

<p>'"Oh," I said carelessly; "I'm not going to drive after I've
steadied the horses down. This young lady wants to handle the
reins for a bit."</p>

<p>'The parson's mouth opened like an oyster</p>

<p>'"Yes," said the little one, dropping down to it; "don't be
frightened, I'm a first-rate whip!"</p>

<p>'Just then we heard the horses coming, so without waiting to
hear what the parson had to say, we got up and went out. When he
came out the commercial and I were standing together.</p>

<p>'"By Jove!" he said, loud enough for the parson to hear,
"you've got that mare in the pole who has upset the coach three
times."</p>

<p>'"That's the darling," I answered, as I climbed up, "and she
looks in a sweet temper this morning."</p>

<p>'"I protest," cried the parson, standing on the step, "I will
enter an action; I will&mdash;"</p>

<p>'"Get along up down there, my beauties," I sang out with a
crack of my whip, and if the commercial hadn't pulled him in the
parson would have been on the broad of his back in the
road.'</p>

<p>'The next change was at a bit of an outside place, where a
stockman lived by himself, and the horses were away down the
paddock, and I had to go down and bring them up, as he was also
away somewhere. The yard was all to pieces, and the commercial
and the two girls kept them bailed up in a corner of the paddock
while I put the winkers on. My! didn't the little one enjoy it.
She'd got a good lump of a waddy, and she'd head 'em back when
they tried to break, and rap out a bit of a swear word that made
the parson, who stood looking on without giving a hand, turn up
his eyes and hold up his hands.</p>

<p>'That night we stayed at a little one-horse place they called
a township, and here the commercial stopped, and the next morning
I had only the three. Well, the school mistress felt a bit sorry
for the parson, and she said she would take a spell inside for a
while, and let the parson take her place. So up he came, and you
bet I raced down the ridges, and frightened seven bells out of
him.</p>

<p>'We used to carry a horn in them days, and the little one had
been practising on it all the way. We met the up coach about 10,
and when it came in sight she thrust the horn into the parson's
hand, saying, "Just hold that a minute," and he took it in his
left hand, and with his right he was holding on like beeswax to
the back of the seat, and, to the people on the other coach, it
must have looked for all the world as though he had his arm
around the girl's waist; and who should be on the box but the
bishop. Lord! what must he have thought of his parson, with the
horn in his hand, as though he had been blowing it, and his arm
seemingly round a girl's waist. His soft hat was jolted all awry,
and he looked a picture; I didn't stop long; only whispered
something to Dick Frost who was driving, and just as we started
he called out, "Look out for that corduroy bridge, Jim, there's a
loose place in the middle."</p>

<p>'The bridge was at the bottom of a. long rise, and we went
down It at a gallop. The parson yelled out something about
stopping, but over we went like a flash, and up the other side,
one of my leaders bucking all he knew; and ten years' growth had
gone out of the parson when we got on the level.</p>

<p>'However, by the time we got to the end of our trip, I was
fairly gone head over heels on that little girl, and was thinking
what sport it would be when I asked the little parson to marry
us. She was so smart and plucky that I vowed I'd never seen a
girl like her before, and forced the running all I could during
the short time I had to stop before turning back. Her name was
Vincent, and her father's place was only a short distance from
the town.</p>

<p>'We seemed to get on famously, and every time the coach came
in she was in the township, so what with my personal advantages
and the fact of being a coach-driver, I reckoned it was a mild
walk over.</p>

<p>'One morning, when I was about starting on the down trip, a
long, slab-sided, red-haired bushey climbs on to the box seat. He
was about as green-hide as you make 'em, and I hoped to goodness
he was not going through, but he was, and he was about the
biggest hog I ever drove. He had a bottle with him, end he sucked
at it all by himself, and got it filled up at every place where
he could get liquor, until he was as tight as Pharaoh's prize pup
after the show; and all the time he scarcely spoke a word.</p>

<p>'Next day it was the same, and about the middle of the day he
blurted out, "I say, driver, how long before we gets to the
end?"</p>

<p>'"To-morrow night. You seem in a hurry."</p>

<p>'"Ay! Got a sweetheart; a regular puffick plum. Going down to
get married."</p>

<p>'"Gosh! I'm sorry for her," I said politely.</p>

<p>'"Dussay you've seen her; Tilly Vincent."</p>

<p>'"The &mdash;&mdash; you are!" I exclaimed, and stared at
him.</p>

<p>'"It's so," he slobbered on. "She's my cousin; made it all up
last time she was up with us."</p>

<p>'Now only for having four women inside, each with a baby, I'd
have upset the coach there and then, and broken his jolly neck,
but dussent do it. We were close to the corduroy bridge, and some
softy had dropped a log of wood on it and left it there.</p>

<p>'"Hold fast inside!" I shouted through the window, and started
at a gallop. He was just taking a suck at his bottle, when up
went the off wheel over the log. There was a scream of four
woman-power from inside, and the galoot shot over the railing
into a pool of water, bottle and all.</p>

<p>'I drove on, gammoning I couldn't steady the horses, although
all the women had their heads out of the window, singing out that
there was a man overboard.</p>

<p>'Half way up the ridge I stopped, and saw him crawl on to the
bank all dripping wet, and begin to howl after me, for as soon as
I saw that he wasn't hurt, I drove on and left him.</p>

<p>'Next day I made record time, and got in two hours early.</p>

<p>'I saw the little one looking curiously at the coach; she was
in her riding habit, and looked so pretty that when I thought of
that pig marrying her, I felt like murder. After I had driven the
coach to the post office and the yard, I went back to the hotel,
and found her in a sitting-room by herself.</p>

<p>'"Jim," she said, sidling up to me, and I could see the tears
in her bright eyes, "Did anyone come down with you besides those
women?"</p>

<p>'"Yes," I answered; "a gowk of a fellow, who said he was going
to marry you."</p>

<p>'"What's become of him?"</p>

<p>'"I tilted him over that corduroy bridge, and left him
there."</p>

<p>'She threw her arms around my neck, and kissed and hugged me.
"You dear, dear old Jim," she said, "I do hope he has broken his
neck."</p>

<p>'"No such luck," I said, giving her the kisses back. "I saw
him get out. But surely you're not going to marry that
beast?"</p>

<p>'"I've got to," she sobbed. "He's just come in to his father's
property, and father and mother will have it."</p>

<p>'"Look here, Tilly!" I said. "I saw that little sheep of a
parson just now. I'll go and make it right with him, and he shall
marry us at once."</p>

<p>'Tilly agreed to this, and went away to get the school
mistress to come, while I hunted up the parson. He threw a lot of
obstacles in the way said it was irregular, and ail sorts of
things, but when I said I'd get the C.P.S., who was also
registrar, to do it, he consented; but there was a spiteful look
in his eye.</p>

<p>'I got the man whose place I had taken to come on his
crutches, and Tilly came with the school mistress, and there we
waited at the church for more than an hour until I was jumping
mad. At last the parson turned up, very red and nervous. He put
his surplice on, and we got ready, when there was tramping of
feet behind us, and Tilly's mother and father appeared, and then
there was a scene. The dirty little sneak of a parson had driven
straight out and brought them in. Tilly was under age, and I
could do nothing, so we were parted.'</p>

<p>Here Jim paused and sighed; I had never seen him so serious
before.</p>

<p>'I started out with my coach when the time came, and about 12
o'clock met the galoot coming along on a horse he had borrowed
from somewhere. He was foaming, and rode straight at the leaders
and tried to stop them. I lashed him with the whip two or three
times, and then pulled up. There were a couple of larky fellows
with me on the box, and I whispered to them, and they jumped
down, collared him, and pulled him off his horse.</p>

<p>'"Sticking up her Majesty's mail," says one. "Ten years'
hard," says the other.</p>

<p>'"See if he's got any weppuns," I said. Lucky for him he had
nothing but the usual bottle, or by gum I'd have sworn he tried
to stick up the coach, and got him shopped.</p>

<p>'"What shall we do with him?" they asked.</p>

<p>'"Well," I said, "if my duty allowed me, I'd get down and put
a head on him, but anyhow, we'll make him walk, for it. Jump up,
boys." I gave the horse he had been riding a cut with the whip
that sent it off hot foot the way it had come, and left him there
cursing and swearing like a fiend.'</p>

<p>'Did she marry him?'</p>

<p>'Yes; they bullied her into it, poor little girl, but thank
the Lord that ducking give him a cold that settled on his lungs,
and he's soon bound for Kingdom Come.'</p>

<p>Jim struck a match and lit his pipe.</p>

<p>'Perhaps I may marry a widow after all,' he said,
reflectively.</p>
