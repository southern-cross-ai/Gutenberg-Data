<h2><a name="ch-0a" id="ch-0a"></a>PREFACE</h2>
<p>It is demanded of the writer of fiction, whether novelist or
dramatist, that the events he sets forth shall be endowed with the
quality of verisimilitude. What he writes need not necessarily be
true; but, at least, it must seem to be true, so that it may carry
that conviction without which interest fails to be aroused. The
historian appears to lie under no such restraining obligation.
Whilst avowed Fiction is scornfully rejected when it transcends the
bounds of human probability, alleged Fact would sometimes seem to
be the more assured of enduring acceptance the more flagrantly
impossible and irreconcilable are its details. And this not merely
by the uninformed, who are easily imposed upon by the label of
History, but even by those whose activities would appear to connote
a degree of mental training at least sufficient to dispel the
credulity that lies ever cheek by jowl with ignorance.</p>

<p>Were it otherwise one of the criticisms of this play which found
utterance in some quarters on its first presentation in London
would not have been that it "whitewashes" Cesare Borgia, that it
distorts historical records for the purposes of the theatre, and
that&mdash;either out of venality, or, perhaps, ignorance&mdash;it
presents a Duke of Valentinois who in nothing resembles the Duke of
Valentinois of sober history.</p>

<p>The Duke of Valentinois of sober history is evidently conceived
by these particular critics to have been a gentleman with no
occupation in life other than the pursuit of murder, incest, and
other similar avocations, a prince with so much poisoning and
poignarding to do in the ordinary way of business that no time
remained him for any of the activities common to a
fifteenth-century ruler; in short, a Duke of Valentinois as
ludicrous and impossible in fiction as he would have been ludicrous
and impossible in fact.</p>

<p>What I mean by this is that the argument of "whitewash" would
appear to rest, if it rests upon anything at all, upon the
following syllogism: We have been taught that Cesare Borgia in the
course of his career murdered, or procured the murder of a number
of persons, and that he practised various unmentionable
abominations; the Cesare Borgia in this play does not commit or
procure, in the course of the events it reflects, the murder of
anybody, nor is he shown engaged in vices of any peculiar
depravity; therefore this Cesare Borgia is not the Cesare Borgia of
history.</p>

<p>The matter would not be worth mentioning at all if it were not
for the undeniable circumstance that those who take this view have
behind them the authority, if not of historians generally, at least
of a certain school of historians, who derive their histories from
those of Guicciardini, Giovio, Matarazzo, and a host of others,
who, through some four centuries, have been busily re-editing and
amplifying the grotesque and sensational tale of Borgia
turpitude.</p>

<p>This school&mdash;ignoring all contemporary evidences of a
refutatory character&mdash;represents Cesare Borgia as a monster of
infamy, a devil incarnate, a gross sensualist, an inhuman scoundrel
without a single redeeming feature. He is accused (without a rag of
tenable evidence, either of fact or of motive, upon which to hang
the accusation) of the murder of his own brother the Duke of
Gandia; he murdered, we are told, his brother-in-law Alfonso of
Aragon; he attempted the murder of his brother-in-law Giovanni
Sforza, Lord of Pesaro; he poisoned his cousin and friend the
Cardinal Giovanni Borgia; he stabbed Pedro Caldes in the very arms
of the Pope, whither the unfortunate chamberlain had fled for
shelter from his fury; and he is charged with procuring in several
ways the death of many others. And these are the least of his
alleged crimes. In the same light and irresponsible fashion,
without the support of any substantiating evidence, with a cynical
disregard of the abundant evidence that might be employed in
refutation, he is, together with all his family, accused of
wholesale incest and other abominable practices.</p>

<p>Of such a character and quality are the details we are afforded
of his misdeeds that if, instead of being the creation of writers
who described themselves as historians, Cesare Borgia had been the
creation of an avowed romancer, he would have been slain for all
time by the ridicule of the public; for such is the conception's
utter lack of verisimilitude that it belongs, not to the realm of
sensational melodrama, but to Bedlam.</p>

<p>Elsewhere, and at length&mdash;in a "Life of Cesare Borgia,"
which is quite frankly a brief for the defence&mdash;I have dealt
critically and in detail with this curious page of Italian history,
examining the sources and applying to the available evidence the
ordinary tests. So much would be out of place here, nor is it
necessary for my immediate aims.</p>

<p>For the moment, and for the purposes of my present argument, let
us admit that the Duke of Valentinois perpetrated all the fantastic
crimes and practised all the equally fantastic abominations with
which he is charged.</p>

<p>From the pages of Guicciardini, written in retirement at his
villa at Arcetri, a quarter of a century after Cesare Borgia's
death, you will hardly gather that the Duke had any other
occupations. And it is curious&mdash;in itself a proof of that
deliberate malice with which Guicciardini is branded by such
contemporaries as Sebastiano Maccithat whilst none of the things
which the Florentine historian relates of Cesare Borgia are of the
slightest historical significance, he omits almost entirely to
mention those deeds and achievements which had so wide and lasting
an effect upon Italian politics, and which are the only matters it
is a sincere historian's function to record.</p>

<p>It is elsewhere that you must seek the details of the admirably
conducted conquest and reorganization of the Romagna, details which
reveal Valentinois as a leader of great military skill, a brilliant
strategist and an enlightened administrator. Still more admirable
does he appear as a ruler over those same Romagna states once he
had wrested them from the turbulent, rapacious despots under whom
they had previously groaned. He restored order out of revolting
chaos, established courts for the proper dispensation of justice,
so that persons and property could depend upon that protection
which they had not known for generations.</p>

<p>The tyrants he deposed went raging up and down Italy, inveighing
against him, dubbing him antichrist and charging him with all
manner of unutterable wickedness, seeking actively to enlist for
his destruction the hostility which his growing power and boundless
ambition had already aroused in the great states of Venice, Naples,
Milan and Florence. But the people of the tyrannies upon which he
made war hailed this antichrist as their deliverer, and they
afforded him such ready and loyal service that in more instances
than one his conquests, as a consequence, were bloodlessly
effected.</p>

<p>These facts&mdash;unlike those matters of his personal
turpitude&mdash;are to-day beyond the realm of controversy. They
are accepted by the most hostile of Borgia critics. Even
Gregorovius, most bitter and unrestrained of anti-papal historians,
finds it necessary to pay the following tribute to a man of whom he
can say little else that is favourable:</p>

<p class="quote">It is undeniable that his government was energetic
and good; for the first time the Romagna enjoyed peace and was rid
of her vampires. In the name of Cesare justice was administered by
Antonio di Monte Sansovino, president of the Ruota of Cesena, a man
universally beloved.</p>

<p>Among the many contemporary pen-portraits that survive we have
the following in a letter to his government from Bishop Soderini,
Ambassador of Florence to the Duke, written at a time when the
relations between Cesare Borgia and the Florentine Republic were
none too friendly:</p>

<p class="quote">This lord is very magnificent and splendid, and so
spirited in feats of arms that there is nothing so great but that
it must seem small to him. In the pursuit of glory and the
acquisition of dominions he never rests, and he knows neither
danger nor fatigue. He moves so swiftly that he descends upon a
place before it is known that he has set out for it. He knows how
to make himself beloved of his soldiers, and he has in his service
the best men in Italy. These things render him victorious and
formidable, and to these is yet to be added his constant good
fortune. He argues with such sound reason that to dispute with him
would be a long affair. His wit and eloquence never fail him.</p>

<p>Other pen-portraits confirming this exist in abundance, some
emanating from friendly, some from hostile sources. They find in
the pages of Gregorovius's "Geschichte der Stadt Rom" the following
summary:</p>

<p class="quote">Nature had been prodigal of gifts to Cesare
Borgia. Like Tiberius of old he was the most beautiful man of his
day, with the shapely vigorous body of an athlete. He held his
senses in subjection to an intellect that was acute and cold. He
exercised a magnetic attraction towards women; but still more
formidable was the magnetic attraction which he exercised towards
men, disarming them. Acute and perspicacious, swift as lightning in
his actions, endowed with great knowledge of men, he was
remorseless, using virtue and vice indifferently to attain his
ends.</p>

<p>Finally, as a lasting monument to Cesare Borgia's achievements,
energy, industry and varied intellectual gifts, we have "The
Prince," that grammar of statecraft from the pen of Niccolò
Macchiavelli, inspired by his close observation of the methods
adopted by Cesare Borgia, who is held up throughout as the model
upon which princes should frame their conduct.</p>

<p>Enough will have been said to show that anyone approaching the
study of this subject for the purposes of the theatre will, if he
probe deeply enough into history, find himself confronted with two
Cesare Borgias. There is, on the one hand, the able soldier, the
astute statesman, the physically and intellectually gifted prince
of those eye-witnesses Soderini, Macchiavelli, and some others. And
there is, on the other hand, the depraved voluptuary, the
bloodthirsty murderer, the unmitigated scoundrel of the
compilations of Guicciardini and Giovio.</p>

<p>The popular conception of the Borgia family is based upon the
latter, or, rather, upon their extensive elaboration in a
seventeenth-century novel by Gregorio Leti. This novel has been
rendered well known by the adaptations of it which Dumas (in his
"Crimes Célébres") and Victor Hugo (in his "Lucrezia Borgia") have
given to the world. Dumas did not consider it necessary to
acknowledge the source of his own romance. Victor Hugo acknowledged
his borrowing from that crude, ill-constructed, ill-written and
salacious piece of fiction, by putting it forward as a serious
authoritative historical document, and so imposed upon a world that
knew no better.</p>

<p>If I had attempted to write of Cesare Borgia a biographical play
I must of necessity have constructed it either upon the parent
story in Guicciardini, together with its lusty well-developed child
in Gregorio Leti, its still lustier grandchildren in Dumas and Hugo
and the subsequent and ubiquitous great-grandchildren, or else upon
the very definite and very different&mdash;though by no means
singular&mdash;conception which I derived from my own independent
researches.</p>

<p>If I had adopted the first of these alternatives, I should have
been guilty of an insincerity which would have brought its own
punishment. Moreover, the result would inevitably have been a
melodrama so flagrantly absurd that any intelligent audience
visually beholding the materialization of that farrago of
ill-invented rubbish&mdash;with whatever art it might have been
presented&mdash;would have laughed it off the stage. In that way,
it is true, I might have rendered valuable historical service by
destroying for all time, by complete exposure, the Borgia myth.</p>

<p>If I had adopted the second alternative I should have been under
the necessity of constructing that very difficult and tedious
thing, a controversial drama. I should have been
accused&mdash;assuming that I could have found production for such
a play&mdash;of departing from the dramatist's proper function of
entertaining an audience, for the purpose of expounding an
historical thesis. And since, in any case, the limitations of the
theatre would never have permitted me fully to develop the
arguments through which my thesis must be expounded, persons who
study their history <i>ad hoc</i> in the Encyclopaedia Britannica
and similar books of concise and summarized reference might indeed
have been justified in raising against me the cry of
"whitewash."</p>

<p>I mention this merely in passing, because the writing of a
biographical play on Cesare Borgia or any other historical
character would not at any time attract me. The career of an active
man of achievements, even when it is so brief a career as Cesare
Borgia's, can hardly prove of interest when telescoped into the
compass of a three-hours' entertainment. More commendable seems the
method of reflecting the man's personality and psychology in a
single incident that shall be typical of the activities of his
career. The incident need not be entirely real, although to have
any true historical value it must be set in circumstances of
reality and at least amid happenings that are actually true.
Moreover, in this way it should be possible&mdash;or so I
fancied&mdash;entirely to avoid all controversy. I would present
the Cesare Borgia of Soderini and Macchiavelli, without, however,
urging anything that should contradict what has been written by
Guicciardini and Giovio. In other words, I would show Cesare Borgia
moving through a set of circumstances that should reveal his
daring, his resource, his splendour, his athletic physical beauty,
his personal magnetism, his intellectual acuteness, his
ruthlessness, his merciless ambition, his typical fifteenth-century
cruelty and his remorseless egotism, whilst at the same time in
nothing suggesting that he could not in a different set of
circumstances have perpetrated any or all of the villainies with
which the popular conception charges him.</p>

<p>Therefore, I was careful that no character in the play save
Cesare Borgia himself should have a single good word to say of
Cesare Borgia, or anything that might have sounded like an argument
in his favour. And the very explanations which, in passing, Cesare
himself offers of the horrible tales that are told of him in Italy
are the explanations which he would have offered&mdash;which we
know, in fact, that he did offer&mdash;whether those tales were
true or not. The actual historical incidents employed in the
construction of the story are incidents about which there is no
controversy between the two schools; whilst if Cesare Borgia is
endowed with the attributes which Soderini and Macchiavelli admired
in him, yet the invented set of circumstances and his remorseless
conduct in them are such as Guicciardini might not have hesitated
to include in his history, if they had been invented
instead&mdash;like so many other political slanders&mdash;by some
Roman, Venetian Neapolitan contemporary.</p>

<p>In this way it seemed to me possible to satisfy my own
conceptions without doing violence to popular belief.</p>

<p>But since in spite of this care with which I sought to steer a
justifiable middle course between conflicting schools, I have not
escaped the charge of having whitewashed Cesare Borgia, it seems to
me that I may have done here better historical service than I set
out to do. For the explanation should lie in the fact that it is
impossible to combine in one person the gifted prince of Soderini
and Macchiavelli with the brutal scoundrel of Guicciardini and his
literary successors.</p>

<h2>ACT I</h2>
<hr>
<p><i>A Hall in the Castle of Solignola.</i></p>

<p><i>A spacious chamber on the first floor of the castle, severe
in tone. Its grey stone walls show bare here and there between the
strips of sombre-hued tapestries with which in the main they are
hung; the ceiling is crudely frescoed. The main
entrance&mdash;double-doors of square design, massive of timber,
fortified by metal&mdash;are in the back flat, a little to the
right of the middle. They open directly on to an external
stair-head with a shallow parapet, whence steps descend, left, to
the ground level below. The farther buildings of the wide
court-yard are seen on the backcloth when this door is
open.</i></p>

<p><i>The loggia is in the same fiat, to the left. Its ceiling is
carried on seven slender pillars (two at each side and three at the
back) delicately carved and painted. These rise from a parapet
rather higher than that of the stairhead, and the outlook thence is
upon distant hills. Against this parapet a bench is set, rather
like a window-seat, equipped with loose leather cushions.</i></p>

<p><i>There is a door low down in the right flat, and opposite to
this a great cowled fireplace, decorated by armorial bearings in
relief and coloured. The floor is of stone, grey and unrelieved. It
may be strewn with rushes. Below this a heavy table is set squarely
across, rather low and a little to the left of midstage. Five
stools are placed about this table, three above, two below, and an
armchair at each end. A carved and gilded throne-like chair stands
R.C. against the wall at back, between doors and loggia, on a small
dais. There is an armchair with cushioned seat against flat
R.</i></p>

<p><i>AT RISE OF CURTAIN the armchair by the hearth is occupied by
COUNT GUIDO DEGLI SPERANZONI, a vigorous man of fifty, with
grizzled hair and a shaven, aquiline face, strong and crafty. He is
well dressed, without fripperies, his exterior, like his bearing,
marking him for a soldier rather than a man of courts. He sits
brooding, chin in palm.</i></p>

<p><i>On the bench in the loggia sits PANTHASILEA DEGLI SPERANZONI,
a beautiful woman of twenty-three, regal of mien and carriage,
dressed simply, yet with a certain richness betokening her rank;
thus there are jewels in her girdle and in the gold network that
confines her hair.</i></p>

<p><i>On a cushion at her feet sits GIULIA. Younger than
Panthasilea, she is by contrast almost child-like. She fills the
office of companion and lady-in-waiting to Count Guido's
daughter.</i></p>

<p><i>It is the afternoon of a day in early Spring.</i></p>

<p><i>PANTHASILEA is singing, accompanying herself upon an
archlute, and the first stanza of her song may be heard before the
curtain actually rises:</i></p>

<p class="quote">Life is an anguish grown, a source of tears,<br>
For Love lies stark and cold on his last bed,<br>
A round of broken days and empty years<br>
When hope is dead.<br>
<br>
There is no joy in song, nor solace yet<br>
In all the tears demanding to be shed;<br>
Vainly we sigh our longings, vainly fret<br>
When hope is dead.<br>
<br>
Thus in Life's fetters still a pris'ner held,<br>
Eating of hopelessness the bitter bread,<br>
Waiting...</p>

<p class="indent1">[<i>Her utterance becomes choked by tears. It
breaks off on a sob. GUIDO starts up in solicitude, whilst GIULIA,
rising to her knees, puts her arm about Panthasilea.</i></p>

<p>GIULIA: Monna Lea! Monna Lea!</p>

<p>GUIDO: Panthasilea, my child! (<i>He goes quickly up to
her.</i>) Why will you make songs to afflict you</p>

peace with the Orsini and with those of his own captains who had
been in rebellion against him.</p>

<p>ALDI: There are rumours of fighting at Cesena, which is very
loyal to him. But I have heard of little else&mdash;save that
Sforza is back in Pesaro, Caterina's son marching on Imola, and
Malatesta hastening to repossess himself of Rimini.</p>

<p>GUIDO: But if he came...</p>

<p>GIANLUCA: He brought more troops at his heels than they had
expected: That gave them pause. They must wait and make their
opportunity. Meanwhile to keep suspicion slumbering there was most
courteous interchange of loving phrases. And when they would have
taken leave of him at the Palace, he insisted that they must in

arrest Cardinal Orsini and the Archbishop for their complicity.</p>

of Venice was there and pleaded eloquently for resistance.</p>

use every state in Italy as the monkey used the cat. But Assisi has

nothing yet. I am patient. I can wait. But though you should never
come to love me, Lea, you cannot deny my loving you, nor while I've

considered what will happen to the townships of the valley?</p>

<p>GUIDO: I have not.</p>

<p>PAVIANO: It should be weighed, I think.</p>

<p>CAMPO: Of course it should. It is our duty to weigh it. We are
here in Solignola itself, which is almost impregnable. But those in
the valley are defenceless, and Valentino may terribly avenge upon
them the stubbornness of the Capital.</p>

<p>SINIBALDI: Surely, sir, if you think that, you cannot have
observed Valentino's methods. They are not quite so crude. It is
not his way to avenge upon dependencies the resistance of a
capital. He is too guileful, believe me. Whom he subjects, he
conciliates.</p>

<p>GIANLUCA: Always is it so. Consider the Case of Faenza. What
harm was suffered by the folk in her territories? None. The
townships surrendered, and knew no violence, though Faenza herself
resisted stubbornly.</p>

<p>CAMPO: But to little purpose.</p>

<p>GUIDO: That is beside the point. And Faenza had not the natural
strength of Solignola.</p>

of ten thousand men for ever.</p>

ever.</p>

sighs.</i>)</p>

<p>GUIDO: Yet it is in the interest of VeniCe that we resist.</p>

<p>SINIBALDI: That is why I am here to-night. Ostensibly I am the
Republic's ambassador to the Duke. In reality I am her ambassador
to those in Romagna valiant enough to stand against this Catalan
adventurer. The interests of the Serene Republic are the interests
of every fief in Middle Italy.</p>

<p>SINIBALDI: The republiC would have to reckon with
France&mdash;for the King of FranCe is behind Valentino. You
perceive the danger, sirs. In the end...VeniCe may be compelled to
incur it.</p>

<p>GIANLUCA: Does not the Serene Republic consider that the end has
been reached?</p>

<p class="indent1">[GIANLUCA'S voice is cold, almost hostile.
Hostility towards Sinibaldi marks his bearing throughout, for he
sees in the Venetian a crafty, cold-blooded schemer, who is slyly

says</i>) the chestnuts from the fire for Venice.</p>

<p>SINIBALDI: No.</p>

<p>ALDI: What remains?</p>

<p>PAVIANO: Ay, what?</p>

been planned in Sinigaglia. It failed. But that which failed in
Sinigaglia might succeed in Assisi.</p>

you a mind to it? To rid Italy of this scourge at a single stroke?
To save your dominions from being ravished by this insatiable
devil?</p>

<p>GUIDO (<i>assentingly</i>): By Heaven's light!</p>

the head and brain of the Pontifical forCes. You make an end of

conquest of Middle Italy; for if he lives he will not rest until he
is King of Tuscany.</p>

<p>CAMPO (<i>rising in horror</i>): It is murder that you are

us to do it. What is the difference?</p>

<p>SINIBALDI: It is considerable. First, the discovery of Venice's

case hope would be at an end for all. Second, your need is urgent,
far more urgent than the need of Venice. Venice is not directly

touch ourselves.</p>

<p>SINIBALDI: Sacrifice for the State's weal is the sacred duty of
the individual.</p>

<p>ALDI: Consider now: His captains would never allow the death of
Valentino to go unavenged. And the measure of their probable
revenge is such as no man may calmly contemplate.</p>

<p>GIANLUCA: Messer Francesco d'Aldi is right. Those devils would
carry fire and sword through every township and every hamlet of the
State. No man, woman or child would they spare in their devastating
rage. Have you thought of that, Prince Sinibaldi, that you come
urging Count Guido to pull this chestnut out of the fire for
Venice?</p>

Venice only. You forget that unless Count Guido takes action, and
that quickly, he is lost.</p>

whether it succeed or fail.</p>

the blow must of necessity be discovered?</p>

<p>GIANLUCA: The right by which you assumed it, when you urged it
as a reason why Venice should not strike.</p>

deliberately to provoke me.</p>

forgotten.</p>

the danger of that. My proposal is that we take him alive.</p>

<p>GUIDO: Why? What then?</p>

<p>ALDI: Hold him as a hostage. Meanwhile, send envoys to the Pope.
Offer His Holiness his son's life and liberty in exchange for our
own&mdash;in exchange for a Bull of perpetual enfranchisement from

looks questioningly at the Condottiero. SANTAFIORA nods
significantly. The others draw breath audibly. SANTAFIORA stolidly
comes down and resumes his place at the table.</p>

<p>GUIDO: A shrewd suggestion, yours, Messer d'Aldi. Surely by
guile it should be possible to lure him into some trap.</p>

<p>GIANLUCA: It would ask a guile not less than his own.</p>

<p>GUIDO (<i>ruminating</i>): Trap, eh? Trap? A trap needs baiting.
What bait do you advise? (<i>He looks round, and is met by
blankness.</i>) Come now: What is the bait to lure a man?</p>

<p>ALDI: Ordinarily I know none better than a woman. But...</p>

<p>SEVERAL: A woman! That's it!</p>

<p>ALDI (<i>to Sinibaldi</i>): Do women tempt this duke?</p>

<p>GUIDO: Need you ask? He'll be his father's son.</p>

<p>SINIBALDI: Hardly as lusty in that respect. Still, he's far from
proof against the lure of beauty.</p>

<p>GUIDO: How should he be? He's a man and young. It should be easy
for a woman so to enmesh him in her toils that he would lie
helpless.</p>

<p>SINIBALDI: Of course it should. You have solved it, Lord
Count.</p>

accomplishments to deceive, and courage to perform her part. Again
I ask you, sirs: Where shall you find that woman?</p>

been wed this spring. And Pietro Varano was strangled three months
ago in Pesaro by Borgia justice. Justice!</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: Could you in honour ask another woman to face the
dangers to which you would not expose your daughter? Besides, where
is this danger? I am not known in Assisi. I have never been there.
I am scarcely known even here in Solignola, where I have been
seldom seen since I came back from Mantua.</p>

Assisi with a dozen men of Santafiora's condotta disguised as
grooms and lackeys. And while</p>

<p>Solignola defies Valentino, and so detains him in Assisi, I
shall find a way to ensnare him, and carry him off to Siena, where
Petrucci will gladly act as your agent in this matter.</p>

<p>GIANLUCA (<i>passionately</i>): Lend it to you! My house? To be
a...a...trap in which you&mdash;your matchless
womanhood&mdash;shall be the lure? I'll be for ever damned before I
am a party to such infamy.</p>

valley thousands of women and little children are threatened with
violence, homelessness, hunger, death, and worse than death.</p>

<p class="indent1">[GUIDO groans, taking his head in his hands.</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: Shall one woman hesitate? Shall one woman fear a

<h4>THE CURTAIN FALLS</h4>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-2" id="ch-2"></a>ACT II</h2>
<hr>
<h3>SCENE I</h3>
<p><i>An Antechamber in the Communal Palace at Assisi.</i></p>

<p><i>A spacious room panelled in dark oak with a tesselated floor
on which lemon verbena and similar herbs are scattered. At back
four steps lead up to a narrow gallery running thence right and
left under an arched roof carried on slender corkscrew pillars of
polished wood, very decoratively carved in the capitals, these
pillars springing from panelling which is carried up here to a
height of some five feet. Immediately facing the steps, beyond the
gallery, another step leads up to a door which is closed, and
guarded at curtain-rise by a Swiss man-at-arms. He wears striped
hose, red and white, puffed out and slashed at the knee. Above
this, cuissarts of steel, steel back-and-breast, and brassards. The
back-and-breast is covered by a tabard on which the arms of the
House of Borgia are displayed in full (this constituting the
livery). His hat is slashed, red and white, and heavily plumed with
red and white feathers. He is armed with a broad-headed pike. A
strip of richly coloured Eastern carpet runs from this door across
the gallery and down the four steps to the level of the
antechamber.</i></p>

<p><i>There is a single door high up in the left flat. The main
doors&mdash;double&mdash;are low down in right flat.</i></p>

<p><i>A long, high, mullioned window, set at a very wide angle
across, joins the right extremity of the gallery with the right
flat. This window is in three sections between two mullions; it is
Gothic in design and in the arcs above there is stained glass
bearing the arms of Assisi. The sunlight shining through these
throws patches of vivid colour on the floor and walls. Below the
arcs the windows are of clear glass; the middle one stands open.
The only furniture in the room consists of a table, covered with an
Eastern carpet and bearing writing materials. This is set rather
low down, and to left of midstage. There are two chairs at this
table. Lower down and further to the left, there is a wooden
settle, equipped with a leather cushion, raked sharply across.
Benches are set against the gallery right and left of steps, and
another bench against the right flat, between double doors and
window. There is also a cushioned window-seat. A portrait of St.
Francis adorns the left flat.</i></p>

<p><i>AT RISE OF CURTAIN the antechamber is occupied by three main
groups. One of these about the window, some seated and some
standing, consists of two ladies and one gentleman, with whom is
CARDINAL REMOLINO. Another is that of Valentino's three Captains,
DIEGO RAMIREZ, SCIPIONE and FERRANTE, which occupies the middle of
the stage; their dress and arms advertise their calling. (N.B.:
They are the only men present with weapons upon them.)</i></p>

<p><i>The third and last group is composed of the Ambassadors,
MACCHIAVELLI, CAPELLO, GASPARO, and MARIANO, and is ranged about
the table.</i></p>

<p><i>MACCHIAVELLI is a slight, lean man of thirty-three, with a
pale, shaven crafty face, prominent cheek-bones, and wide-set,
lively eyes. His black hair is fairly short, and squarely cut. He
is dressed in rather rusty black with almost clerical simplicity,
and his long black gown is of distinctly clerical fashion over a
plain black doublet, buttoned to the throat. By contrast, his
fellow-ambassadors look opulent in their furred velvet gowns,
especially the smooth, corpulent and elderly CAPELLO.</i></p>

<p><i>Two cowled monks sit telling their beads on the bench under
the gallery right: the bench left is occupied by two stripling
pages who are playing Mora. They are dressed in tight-fitting
scarlet with the Borgia escutcheon wrought on the breasts of their
doublets.</i></p>

<p><i>The chatter is general, and enlivened by trills of laughter
from the ladies, for which the CARDINAL appears chiefly
responsible.</i></p>

<p><i>The main doors are thrust open by a man-at-arms (A Swiss,
counterpart of the one above) who, entering, stands at attention,
with ordered pike, whilst Prince Sinibaldi swaggers in,
resplendently dressed, and followed by a page, carrying his sword
and purse.</i></p>

<p class="indent1">[The Swiss levels his pike to bar the boy's
passage.</p>

<p>SWISS: Hi! Young sir! That sword!</p>

<p>SINIBALDI (<i>checking and turning</i>): What now?</p>

<p class="indent1">[The general chatter dies down.</p>

<p>SWISS: No one, not of the duke's service, passes this door
wearing a sword.</p>

<p>SINIBALDI: He's not wearing a sword. He is carrying
one&mdash;for me.</p>

<p>SWISS: It's all one, excellency. The sword does not enter.</p>

<p>SINIBALDI: Are we at the Vatican? Is this a Papal antechamber? I
am an ambassador and I have my privileges.</p>

<p class="indent1">[CAPELLO detaches from the group of ambassadors,
and comes down to SINIBALDI.</p>

<p>SWISS: No privilege to bear arms in here. My orders,
excellency.</p>

<p class="indent1">[CAPELLO presses SINIBALDI'S arm, grimacing
significantly. SINIBALDI shrugs his impatience.</p>

<p>SINIBALDI: Go wait in the outer room, boy.</p>

<p class="indent1">[The PAGE retires with the Swiss, who closes the
doors again, from the outside.</p>

<p class="indent1">[SINIBALDI turns to CAPELLO, who is soothing his
ruffled humour.</p>

<p>SINIBALDI: What new rule is this, Messer Capello?</p>

<p>CAPELLO (<i>sneering</i>): The duke perceives the need to take
precautions against the sort of affection he inspires. It is very
prudent of him. He is not without bitter enemies here in
Assisi.</p>

<p>SINIBALDI And elsewhere.</p>

<p>CAPELLO (<i>hypocritically</i>): Alas!</p>

<p class="indent1">[He glances significantly at SINIBALDI, who
pulls himself together, and looks round. He exchanges bows with the
Cardinal, and then, on CAPELLO'S arm, joins the ambassadorial
group.</p>

<p>SINIBALDI: Ah, Messer Macchiavelli! Do you still linger here in
Assisi?</p>

<p>MACCHIAVELLI (<i>slyly</i>): My presence calls for no
explanation. My motives are innocent. I am detained here by
affairs.</p>

<p>SINIBALDI (<i>a little dubious of Macchiavelli's meaning</i>):
So are we all, sir. You are not singular in that. And what news
from Florence? How does the Signory view the affair at
Sinigaglia?</p>

<p>MACCHIAVELLI: How would your excellency have my masters view it?
Why, with hearty approval&mdash;(<i>sardonic</i>) like the Serene
Republic.</p>

<p>SINIBALDI: I am glad that our respective States take the same
view. Harmony, I always think, is the soul of statecraft. Don't
you?</p>

<p>MACCHIAVELLI (<i>uncompromisingly</i>): No.</p>

<p>SINIBALDI: No?</p>

<p>MACCHIAVELLI: When there is harmony, there is no need for
statecraft.</p>

<p>CAPELLO: Oh, but to preserve it&mdash;to keep the peace?</p>

<p>MACCHIAVELLI: Force is what keeps the peace. Statecraft disturbs
it.</p>

<p>SINIBALDI: Surely, Messer Macchiavelli, in an ambassador and the
ambassador of such a power as Florence, this is rank heresy?</p>

<p>MACCHIAVELLI: Most wisdom, my lord, is heresy. But the strong
hand, well displayed, seldom needs exerting. Si vis pacem, para
bellum. That is a truth Duke Valentino understands.</p>

<p>SINIBALDI (<i>laughing</i>): Is it? The events hardly encourage
him. The strong hand has been well displayed before Solignola to
little purpose; and it's been exerting itself, too, for a week,
without result.</p>

<p>CAPELLO: Ay! How do you reconcile that with your theory,
sir?</p>

<p>MACCHIAVELLI: I don't.</p>

<p>SINIBALDI: But then...?</p>

<p>MACCHIAVELLI: I look beyond for a reason.</p>

<p class="indent1">[There is a pause. SINIBALDI and CAPELLO are a
little uneasy.</p>

<p>SINIBALDI (<i>sardonic</i>): Oh? And you see?</p>

<p>MACCHIAVELLI: Nothing. Therefore, I am the more suspicious.</p>

<p>CAPELLO (<i>breathlessly</i>): And you suspect?</p>

<p>MACCHIAVELLI: That Solignola is being stimulated into resistance
by one of the great powers of Italy.</p>

<p>SINIBALDI (<i>taken aback, then counterfeiting amusement</i>)
But how very interesting! And your evidence?</p>

<p>MACCHIAVELLI: Evidence? I leave evidence to dullards, lord
prince. I have my wits.</p>

<p>CAPELLO They are renowned. (<i>Bowing.</i>) The Signory of
Florence is most fortunate in her Secretary of State.</p>

<p>MACCHIAVELLI: Scarcely so fortunate as the Serene Republic of
Venice in her ambassadors&mdash;ordinary (<i>bowing to CAPELLO</i>)
and extraordinary (to SINIBALDI).</p>

<p>SINIBALDI and CAPELLO (<i>speaking together</i>): O, sir!</p>

<p>SINIBALDI But from whom should Solignola expect assistance,
Messer Macchiavelli?</p>

<p>MACCHIAVELLI: Ah, that...! I can tell you from whom she does not
expect it. Nothing more.</p>

<p>SINIBALDI: And the duke? Does he share your views? He honours
you with a deal of his confidence.</p>

<p>MACCHIAVELLI: The duke, lord prince, honours no man with his
confidence. He allows some odd fools to think so. That is all.</p>

<p class="indent1">[There is laughter in the ambassadorial group.
SINIBALDI turns away.</p>

<p>SINIBALDI: What keeps his magnificence this morning? He is not
usually so late in giving audience.</p>

<p class="indent1">[The CAPTAINS drawn by the laughter have moved
up to join the Ambassadors. RAMIREZ answers him.</p>

<p>RAMIREZ: A courier has just arrived from Cesena. I would to
Heaven he had broken his neck on the way, or else arrived sooner.
He keeps us cooling our heels here, when our work is under the
walls of Solignola.</p>

<p class="indent1">[RAMIREZ is a vigorous man of thirty, swarthy,
and bearded in the Spanish fashion, truculent of air and carriage,
fully conscious of the fact that he is a great soldier.</p>

<p>RAMIREZ: It doesn't advance at all, devil take it! I have
conducted fifteen sieges in my time, and brought them all to a
capitulation. But this one...</p>

<p>SCIPIONE: We've wasted a whole week there to no purpose at
all.</p>

only fit for goats.</p>

<p>CHAMBERLAIN: Cardinal Remolino, his highness will see you at
once.</p>

<p>CARDINAL: I come. You give me leave, ladies...and you, sirs.</p>

<p class="indent1">[There is an exchange of courtesies.</p>

<p>CHAMBERLAIN (<i>addressing the antechamber generally</i>) His
highness will be occupied for some time yet. It is pleasanter on
the loggia here at the gallery's end. (<i>He indicates it, Off
R.</i>)</p>

<p class="indent1">[The COURTIERS (<i>i.e., ladies and
gallants</i>) rise and begin to move up in the wake of the
Cardinal, but some distance behind him. As the latter passes up the
steps he beckons the MONKS, who rise and follow him. They pass
through the door at the back. The CHAMBERLAIN is about to retire
when SINIBALDI detains him.</p>

<p>SINIBALDI: Will you say to his highness that I am here to pay my
homage?</p>

<p class="indent1">[The CHAMBERLAIN bows, and withdraws through the
door at back, which he closes.</p>

<p class="indent1">[The COURTIERS now move up the steps, along the
gallery to the right, and so pass out of view, laughing and
chatting. As the last of them are disappearing, the main doors are
opened, and the Swiss enters, ushering PANTHASILEA and GIULIA. The
Swiss on guard above now shoulders his pike, and begins to pace the
gallery's length, disappearing from view for a moment or two each
time that he reaches either of the visible ends of it.</p>

<p>SWISS: In here, madonna. His highness will be giving audience
soon.</p>

<p class="indent1">[SINIBALDI sees her, and at once leaves the
ambassadorial group, which by now has moved over to the window,
where the other three remain closely in talk, their backs to the
stage.</p>

<p>SINIBALDI: My homage, madonna. PANTHASILEA: Lord prince.</p>

<p class="indent1">[He bows, then glances furtively at the group in
the window. Seeing its members engrossed, he draws closer to her,
and lowers his voice.</p>

<p>SINIBALDI: Is this prudent? That you should thrust yourself in
here?</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: (<i>smiling and calm</i>): It is necessary to make
a beginning. I have waited a week, plaguing my wits to find a
way.</p>

<p>SINIBALDI: But to come&mdash;into the lion's den. It is very
rash.</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: Not more than the rest of the enterprise. I seek
audience of the duke, such as is accorded to all who seek it.
Moreover, I have a definite reason. I come to ask for justice.</p>

<p>SINIBALDI: On what grounds?</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: The best that my invention could discover. I have
no fear&mdash;save as concerns Gianluca. He is hostile&mdash;madly
hostile&mdash;to the whole business.</p>

<p>SINIBALDI: I thought you had persuaded him...</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: So did I. But he's recanted. He won't be persuaded.
He raves and rants, and swears that at need he will kill the duke
with his own hands rather than let me carry through my project.</p>

<p>SINIBALDI (<i>alarmed</i>): Then if he knows that you have come
here...</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: He doesn't. I have eluded him. Once he knows that I
am definitely committed, he will perforce submit. But you, sir? Is
it wise of you to stand in talk with me so long?</p>

<p>SINIBALDI: I know you as Madonna Bianca Bracci of Spoleto. I
have made your acquaintance since coming here to Assisi. Why should
it be unwise of me to talk to you?</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: You misunderstand. It might be unwise of Monna
Bianca Bracci of Spoleto to be seen talking to the
envoy-extraordinary of Venice. The Serene Republic is in none such
good odour hereabouts.</p>

<p>SINIBALDI (<i>bowing, with an ironic smile</i>): I see. In that
case...</p>

<p class="indent1">[The door at back has opened again, and the
CHAMBERLAIN reappears.</p>

<p>CHAMBERLAIN: Prince Sinibaldi!</p>

<p class="indent1">[SINIBALDI starts round.</p>

<p>CHAMBERLAIN: His highness is distressed that you should wait.
But affairs detain him still. If your business is urgent, he
informs you and (<i>to the other Ambassadors</i>) you also, sirs,
that his secretary Messer Agabito will see you at once.</p>

<p>CAPELLO: For me, Messer Agabito will serve excellently.</p>

<p>GASPARO: And for me also.</p>

<p>CHAMBERLAIN: His highness will hope to see you before you leave.
(<i>To Page.</i>) Tolomeo, conduct their notabilities to Messer
Agabito.</p>

<p class="indent1">[The PAGE rises, and steps forward. The
CHAMBERLAIN bows and withdraws again. The AMBASSADORS pass round to
the steps, and up these, conducted by the PAGE, who leads the way
oft along the gallery to the left.</p>

<p class="indent1">[SINIBALDI bows to PANTHASILEA, who seats
herself on the settle down left, with GIULIA behind her. He is
turning away, when the main doors open abruptly and GIANLUCA surges
in, the Swiss restraining him.</p>

<p>SWISS: Nay, nay, noble sir! Whither so fast?</p>

<p>GIANLUCA (<i>wildly excited</i>): Why do you detain me?</p>

<p>I..I...(<i>He espies Sinibaldi.</i>) I am of the household of
Prince Sinibaldi. I have a message for him.</p>

<p class="indent1">[SINIBALDI stiffens. PANTHASILEA rises
again.</p>

<p>SWISS: Why didn't your worthiness say so?</p>

<p>GIANLUCA: I've said so now. Let me pass.</p>

<p>SWISS: Not with that sword. No weapons are allowed within this
door.</p>

<p>GIANLUCA: Oh, a plague on it. Here! Take the thing.</p>

<p class="indent1">[GIANLUCA hastily lifts the sword from its
carriages. The Swiss takes it and goes out, closing the doors
again. GIANLUCA springs towards PANTHASILEA. SINIBALDI gets in his
way.</p>

<p>SINIBALDI: I trust, sir, that since you've made so free with my
name, and connected yourself with me, you are not considering any
rashness here. You'll remember where you are!</p>

<p>GIANLUCA (<i>fuming at the detention</i>): Rashness? Far from
it, I am here to prevent a rashness.</p>

<p>SINIBALDI: By argument alone?</p>

<p>GIANLUCA: How else? Besides, man, they've taken my weapons. How
they guard this pestilent duke!</p>

<p>SINIBALDI Sh! Be prudent, sir&mdash;for your own sake, and that
of others. (<i>Impressively.</i>)</p>

<p class="indent1">[He turns and goes up, and slowly of along the
gallery to the left as the others went.</p>

<p class="indent1">[The stage is now empty save for GIANLUCA,
PANTHASILEA and GIULIA, and the Swiss who stolidly parades the
gallery at back and intermittently disappears.</p>

<p>GIANLUCA: Thank God I am in time!</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: In time for what? In time to ruin me? 0, you are
mad to have followed me here.</p>

<p>GIANLUCA: You are mad to have come. What can you hope to do?
Come away, Lea. Come away at once.</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: In all this week, Gianluca, you have tried my
patience to the utmost. I have suffered it out of a mistaken
tenderness.</p>

<p>GIANLUCA: Don't be angry with me, Lea; you know what it is that
urges me to screen and guard you even from your own self.</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: That knowledge has given me my patience. But this
patience is worn out. By your madness, if you persist in it, you
may ruin all, including yourself and me, and Solignola. So go!</p>

<p>GIANLUCA (<i>doggedly</i>): I will not go without you! I will
not have you do this thing. I will not!</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: You will not? By what right do you say that to
me?</p>

<p>GIANLUCA (<i>snapping his fingers</i>): That for right! You
shall not do it. You shall not brand yourself with this
infamy&mdash;this Delilah work.</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: Sh! You fool! Will you shout it from the
housetops?&mdash;and have us both sent to the strangler? How dare
you come ranting here, telling me what I shall and shall not
do?</p>

<p>GIANLUCA (<i>desperately</i>): I am presumptuous in that I love
you, Lea. That is why I abhor to see you shouldering so vile a
task&mdash;making a lure of your matchless beauty, to...</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: Stop!</p>

<p class="indent1">[For a moment they stand looking at each
other.</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: You have gone the length of insult.</p>

<p>GIANLUCA: Forgive me, Lea!</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: We will forget what you have said&mdash;all of it.
As long as I am in Assisi, I must continue to use your house; but I
trust that you will relieve me of your attendance, thus sparing me
the memory of your offence.</p>

<p>GIANLUCA: Ah, Lea, I didn't mean it as you think. I...</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: Messer Gianluca, to be frank, I care nothing what
you meant. But I beg you to respect my wishes without driving me to
take measures to enforce them.</p>

<p class="indent1">[The COURTIERS come sauntering back, along the
gallery from the right.</p>

<p>GIANLUCA (<i>furiously piqued</i>): Depend upon it, I shall not
trouble you again...ever.</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: Control your voice. We are no longer alone.</p>

<p>GIANLUCA: Madonna, I take my leave.</p>

<p class="indent1">[He bows curtly; PANTHASILEA turns her shoulder.
He swings on his heel, and goes angrily out, as the COURTIERS come
down the steps.</p>

<p>GIULIA: Poor Messer Gianluca! He means you well, madonna.</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: Maybe, but I think I shall be more comfortable in
his indifference.</p>

<p>GIuLIA: Are you sure, madonna, that he is not right?</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA (<i>sitting down again on the settle</i>): Perhaps
he is. But I have that to do in which I must not count the cost. I
must remember only all the lives that hang upon it, Giulia.</p>

<p class="indent1">[The main doors are violently opened by the
SWISS. A COURIER enters, haggard, dust-covered, a leather satchel
slung about his body. The SWISS faces towards the gallery, and
roars.</p>

<p>SWISS: Ho there! Who waits?</p>

<p class="indent1">[A PAGE appears suddenly from doorway left, and
answers nervously.</p>

<p>PAGE: Here!</p>

<p>SWISS: Where were you hiding?</p>

<p class="indent1">[RAMIREZ, SCIPIONE and FERRANTE emerge from the
same door, accompanied by MICHELE DA CORELLA (<i>known as
MICHELETTO</i>). He is the most trusted of Cesare Borgia's captains
and the highest in authority. He is a small, slight man, swarthy of
face, with a black beard. He is bareheaded, and his hair is long,
reaching to his shoulders. He is plainly dressed, as a soldier, but
without armour, and his only visible weapon is a heavy dagger on
his right hip.</p>

<p class="indent1">[The Swiss continues to address the PAGE.</p>

<p>SWISS: Here's a courier from Rome for the Duke's magnificence.
Conduct him.</p>

<p class="indent1">[The PAGE goes up, the COURIER following hint,
and knocks at the door at back. The CHAMBERLAIN opens it, the
COURIER is drawn inside, and the door closed again.</p>

<p class="indent1">[The PAGE lounges down to the bench on the left
under gallery. The SWISS meanwhile has withdrawn again, and closed
the doors. The CAPTAINS have broken into conversation, as they
saunter across to the right, towards the window.</p>

<p class="indent1">[The COURTIERS are clustering down left about
the table.</p>

<p>RAMIREZ: Fifteen sieges have I conducted successfully in my day;
but may I be damned if ever I had to reduce such a place as
this.</p>

<p>CORELLA: You haven't reduced it yet, and by your present methods
I'll be damned if you ever will.</p>

<p>RAMIREZ (<i>snorting</i>): Oho! And why not, if you pleas;
Micheletto?</p>

<p>CORELLA: Because, they are of no avail.</p>

<p>RAMIREZ (<i>truculent</i>): Who says so?</p>

<p>CORELLA: I say so, and his highness says so.</p>

<p>RAMIREZ: That you should say so, Micheletto, and that his
highness should say are two totally different things.</p>

<p>CORELLA: In this case, we both say the same thing.</p>

<p>RAMIREZ (<i>sneering</i>): Of course you do. You may be depended
upon to say what his highness says.</p>

<p>CORELLA: On the contrary; it was I who drew the attention of his
highness to this state of things.</p>

<p>RAMIREZ: When was that?</p>

<p>CORELLA: Last night. I told his highness...</p>

<p>RAMIREZ: Oh! You told his highness, did you?</p>

<p class="indent1">[The AMBASSADORS return along the gallery from
the left accompanied by AGABITO. The latter, Cesare Borgia's
secretary, is dressed in black, and has almost the air of a cleric.
His face is round and shaven and pale; he is rather paunchy, and
oily in his manner; a man of between forty and fifty, with thin
grey hair, kept short.</p>

<p class="indent1">[RAMIREZ goes truculently on.</p>

<p>RAMIREZ: And pray what did you tell him?</p>

<p>CORELLA: Why, that if we are not to sit here for ever, some
other plan of operations will have to be devised.</p>

<p>RAMIREZ: Oh! And what was the plan you advised?</p>

<p>CORELLA: I have made no suggestions yet.</p>

<p>RAMIREZ: Ah! That is wise of you.</p>

<p>SCIPIONE: Now what do you mean by that, Ramirez?</p>

<p>RAMIREZ (<i>exploding</i>): Mean? Lord of Heaven! I mean that
I'm a Spaniard&mdash;that's what I mean; and that what a Spaniard
doesn't know about the art of war, no Italian pimp in the world can
teach him. (In a towering rage.) That's what I mean! Do I make
myself plain?</p>

<p class="indent1">[SCIPIONE and CORELLA laugh at his rage.</p>

<p>SCIPIONE: Ho, ho, ho! A Spaniard, eh, Micheletto?</p>

<p>CORELLA: It's lucky for you the duke can't hear you.</p>

<p>RAMIREZ: The duke! If the duke is the greatest soldier in Italy
that's because he's half a Spaniard. And I say it again, and who
contradicts me is a liar. The Spaniard is the first soldier in the
world.</p>

<p>SCIPIONE (<i>tauntingly, through laughter</i>): Next to the
Italian, Ramirez. Next to the Italian.</p>

<p class="indent1">[He and Corella go off into laughter again.
RAMIREZ: What's to laugh at?</p>

<p>SCIPIONE: You, you Spanish Rhodomont. Ho, ho, ho!</p>

that from no man; from no man in all this world.</p>

<p>CORELLA (<i>suddenly grave</i>): RamireZ! Be quiet, you
fool!</p>

<p>RAMIREZ: He called me Rhodomont.</p>

<p>CORELLA: And now you're proving that he's right.</p>

<p>RAMIREZ: What's that? (<i>He bares his sword.</i>) You miserable
Italian capons!</p>

<p class="indent1">[There is a roar from SCIPIONE and CORELLA and
counter-roars from RAMIREZ and from FERRANTE, who sides with him.
SCIPIONE and CORELLA fling themselves upon RAMIREZ to disarm him.
There are screams from the ladies, whilst the gallants, to increase
the uproar and confusion, rush noisily in to separate the
disputants. There is a seething, roaring mob to the right of the
steps, and the two PACES hover gleefully on the skirts of it,
enjoying the fun.</p>

<p class="indent1">[The AMBASSADORS, grouped left, watch the
turmoil in alarm. Down stage, PANTHASILEA is soothing GIULIA, who
has loosed a scream or two. Through the incoherent vociferations
are heard intermittently the phrases:</p>

<p>CORELLA: You Spanish buffoon!</p>

<p>RAMIREZ: You Italian dogs!</p>

<p>SCIPIONE: Let me come at you!</p>

<p>CORELLA: Quiet, you fool!</p>

<p>RAMIREZ: I'll carve your livers into ribbons!</p>

<p class="indent1">[The uproar and clamour have reached their
height when suddenly, abruptly, as if a door had been shut, all is
quiet. The seething mass disintegrates, and its members land cowed
and stricken, suddenly conscious of a presence.</p>

<p class="indent1">[At the head of the steps VALENTINOIS stands
looking down upon them, cold, severe, inscrutable.</p>

<p class="indent1">[He is a young man of twenty-five, tall,
elegant, virile. His face is pale, his eyes large and glowing. His
auburn hair is bushed out behind into a clump, held by a fine
network of gold. His paler auburn beard is delicately pointed. He
wears on his head the scarlet cap of the gonfalonier, on his breast
the collar of the order of St. Michael. He is dressed in a long
surcoat of deep wine-coloured velvet that reaches almost to his
feet, caught about his middle by a jewelled girdle, from which a
dagger hangs on his hip. This surcoat is reversed with ermine.
Under it he wears a doublet of cloth of gold, a wedge of which is
seen at the breast, and the sleeves of which are revealed to the
elbow, whence his arms emerge from the wide escalloped sleeves of
the outer garment.</p>

<p class="indent1">[After a pause in which he surveys the occupants
of the antechamber, his cold, level, utterly dispassionate voice
cuts sharply upon the silence.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: Is this an antechamber, a tavern, or a stable?</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA (to GIULIA, breathlessly): Who is that?</p>

<p>GIULIA: The Duke of Valentinois.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: Am I become of no account? Are there not ladies
present? (<i>Without raising his voice.</i>) That sword, Diego? Why
is it bare? Did you draw it in my service? (<i>More sharply.</i>)

<p class="indent1">[RAMIREZ surrenders it, but exclaims on a
pleading note.</p>

<p>RAMIREZ: Magnificent!</p>

from our noble cousin of Ferrara. Our love and duty to him. We hope

proofs of her respect and wonder.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: Ambassadorially she honours me beyond my poor
deserts. And what, Messer Capello, is the newest gossip from the
Mistress of the Adriatic? What do they say of us in Venice now?
Whom have we recently murdered or betrayed? What Cardinals has our
father poisoned lately? What new lover has our sister taken to her
bed?</p>

<p>CAPELLO (<i>aghast</i>): These are jests, highness!</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: They are. The jests of Venice&mdash;a city of
jesters, clearly; a little morbid perhaps in her pleasantries, a
little dull in her invention. Still, when I need a fool I'll seek
one in Venice.</p>

<p class="indent1">[SINIBALDI and CAPELLO mask their rage in
mechanical smiles, exchanging looks eloquent of their common hate
as VALENTINOIS passes on.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: Messer Gasparo, you will inform your beautiful and
accomplished Lady Isabella of Este of my delight in the masks she
has had the sweet thought to send me. You shall tell her of their
joyous use at a supper to which you are bidden for to-night. We
deserve, I think, a little revelry after our latest labour of
Hercules&mdash;the cleaning of the Augean Stable of the
Romagna.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, and concerned with this, there is a spectacle of
another sort preparing in the market-place here at Assisi.</p>

<p>The Orsini traitors&mdash;the Duke of Gravina and his
brother&mdash;will be strangled there at noon precisely.</p>

<p class="indent1">[There is a general movement followed by a
rather awe-stricken stillness.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: Letters from Rome bring me word of the arrest of
Cardinal Orsini and the Archbishop of Florence. So that...(he
dismisses the matter with a wave and a sigh). You will be
impatient, sirs, to send that news to your governments. You have
leave to go. We look to see you at our table to-night.</p>

<p class="indent1">[The AMBASSADORS bow, and make shift to
withdraw. VALENTINOIS detains MACCHIAVELLI, placing a hand on the

presence. But we trust that fortune will make amends to-night if
you will ennoble by your attendance the masque we are preparing.

<p>VALENTINOIS (<i>smiling ironically</i>): But for special
purposes, madonna, there are the special people I have appointed to
my service.</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: Your patience, highness, but this is a matter upon
which I could have little hope from any but yourself.</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: Because it is said of you that you are the soul of
justice.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: Is it? Of me? Where is that said? Whence are you,
madonna?</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: From Spoleto, magnificent.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: And they say that of me in Spoleto, do they? What
ails them in Spoleto that they should speak the truth?</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: They have no cause to do otherwise, highness.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: They have no cause elsewhere in Italy.
Nevertheless, you'll find that everywhere they speak&mdash;Italian.
What is your name, madonna?</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: I am called Bianca Bracci, highness.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: Bracci! An honourable name. And what may have
brought you from the veracious city of Spoleto to this Assisi where
the truth has probably not been heard since St. Francis died?</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: Family reasons, magnificent. I came a week
ago&mdash;on the very day of your highness's arrival.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: Undeterred by it?</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: Encouraged by it, my lord.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: Ah?</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: It was not unnatural that I should desire to see
for myself the most illustrious of the Gonfaloniers of Holy Church,
the matchless soldier who has restored the Romagna fiefs to the
patrimony of St. Peter, the mirror of chivalry whom the King of
France honours himself in honouring.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS (<i>conning her with narrowed eyes</i>): Flattery,
madonna, may be the shortest cut to most men's confidence. It is
the longest way to mine.</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA (<i>scandalized</i>): Flattery? I spoke from my
heart.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: A courtier's heart by the ring of your words.</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: No courtier, highness. I am country-bred. Nor have
I said that you are all this. But merely that I had heard it said
so.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: In Spoleto?</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: In Spoleto.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: Decidedly I must go to Spoleto. But you said, I
think, that a special reason detains you here.</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA (<i>suddenly grave</i>): They say of your highness
that you are of a justice that is terrible but always just.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS (<i>suspiciously</i>): Is it justice you require of
me?</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: I had with me a young waiting-woman-a mere child,
who was good and pious, and beautiful&mdash;to her undoing perhaps,
though I still pray that it may not be so. This child, Francesca
Lidana is her name, has disappeared. She vanished yesterday
afternoon.</p>

<p class="indent1">[VALENTINOIS stares at her in astonishment; then
he speaks with some indignation in his voice.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: And you come to me! You break in on me, who am
engaged upon matters that may set nations tottering, with such a
trumpery affair as this?</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA (<i>heatedly</i>): Trumpery? Is brutal violence,
perhaps the murder of one who is your subject, maybe the ruin of a
soul, a trumpery affair? (<i>With a half-sneer.</i>) They told me
you were justice incarnate.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: I have established courts, madonna, to see that the
public peace is kept and to protect persons and property. There is
my CaptaIn of JustIce here In Assisi.</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: I have appealed to him without satisfaction.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: What?</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: I understand that such a court should hesitate to
move against your soldiers&mdash;against your officers,
perhaps.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: Why else have I established it? Or do you think
that I govern like the Baglioni, the Malatesta, the Speranzoni, and
all these other brigands who have preyed upon this unfortunate
Romagna?</p>

<p class="indent1">[PANTHASILEA quivers at the mention of her own
name; but instantly recovers.</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: It is because I do not that I have come to you.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS (<i>after a moment's pause, as if irresolute</i>):
Let me understand this thing. You spoke of violence and
murder&mdash;hinting that it was the work of my men. What is the
full tale of this woman's disappearance?</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: I sent her on an errand. The streets were full of
soldiers at the time. Myself I saw a group of men in your
liveries&mdash;with the Bull escutcheon on their
breasts&mdash;lounging before my house when she went forth.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: Where is your house?</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: By the Temple of Minerva. It is the house of Messer
Gianluca della Pieve. He is a distant relative.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: And you reside with him?</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: Oh no, highness. In his house. He has ceded it to
me.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: No matter. You saw the maid go forth. What
next?</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: That is all.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: All?</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: Save that she has not yet returned.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: But you spoke of violence&mdash;of murder!</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: What else is to be presumed? Why else should she
continue absent?</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: Little wonder that the Captain of Justice would not
take action upon such slender grounds. Wait until the wench
returns, madonna.</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: But if she should not return?</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: Seek my Captain of Justice again. He shall have
orders from me.</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: Of your charity&mdash;of your great justice,
highness&mdash;will you not give those orders now, orders that
search be made for her? Consider what the delay may mean to this
poor child. Consider what it means to me, magnificent, who feel
myself responsible to the mother who entrusted her to me.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS (<i>smiling</i>): When I, need an advocate, Monna
Bianca, I shall send for you, I think. Content you. My Captain of
Justice shall have commands at once to make such search as you may
order.</p>

<p class="indent1">[He is standing by the table, and now as he
speaks he stoops and scrawls some lines on a sheet of paper.
VALENTINOIS: Go to him again with that, and give him all details he
may ask. I trust your little maid may be restored to you undamaged.
If otherwise&mdash;I shall see justice done.</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA (<i>effusively</i>): I knew that your potency would
not deny me.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: You knew that no man could; and you traded a little
upon that, I think, madonna. A dangerous&mdash;dangerous trade. But
your gratitude must give proofs.</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: Proofs?</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: There are revels here to-night; a supper to the
patricians of Assisi, to be followed by a masque. You will grace it
with your presence, madonna.</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA Your magnificence does me too much honour.</p>

<p class="indent1">[She curtsies.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS (<i>graciously</i>): So that you come, the honour
will be of your conferring. Until to-night, Madonna Bianca.</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA (<i>assentingly, curtsying again</i>):
'Highness!</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: The door, Scipione.</p>

<p class="indent1">[SCIPIONE hastens forward to hold the door for
PANTHASILEA, who goes out with GIULIA.</p>

<p class="indent1">[VALENTINOIS watches her off; then saunters up,
speaking to MACCHIAVELLI.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: A very beautiful woman, Master Secretary, and fully
aware of it; knowing, too&mdash;mark you&mdash;though merely
country-bred, that beauty is a coinage universally honoured. Ready,
as I judge her, to spend it in purchasing whatever she may require
of life.</p>

<p>MACCHIAVELLI: Your highness describes not a woman, but
womankind.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: Oho!</p>

<p>MACCHIAVELLI: And this lady of Spoleto seemed in some ways
extraordinary.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: YOU observed it, too, did you? I wonder does
anything escape you.</p>

<p>MACCHIAVELLI: At least all those things that escape your
highness; and many that do not.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: Faith, Ser Piccolo, you are yourself the chief of
those things...(<i>He crosses to the window, and looks
out.</i>)...the most elusive of them all.</p>

<p>MACCHIAVELLI: I, magnificent! I am candour
incarnate&mdash;transparent as glass.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS (<i>pointing upwards to the arc of the windows</i>):
Stained glass&mdash;that allows the light to pass in, but nothing
to pass out. (<i>He breaks off.</i>) Ah, there she goes, stepping
so very proud and dainty...Ah! Who is that? (<i>He cranes
forward.</i>) Scipione, you are an Assisian. Who is that man
standing in talk with her, do you know?</p>

<p class="indent1">[SCIPIONE comes to his side at the window, and
looks out.</p>

<p>SCIPIONE: The gentleman is very vehement, highness.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: Vehement! He is angry. Observe me his arms,
thrashing the air like the sails of a windmill. There, now&mdash;do
you see his face?</p>

<p>SCIPIONE: Yes...Yes...that's it. He is Gianluca della Pieve.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: Gianluca della Pieve? Ah, yes, her distant
relative. He doesn't behave like a distant relative. A husband
couldn't better the performance. (<i>Turning from the window.</i>)
Gianluca della Pieve, eh? Now where have I heard that name
before?</p>

<p>SCIPIONE: He is the gentleman who abstained when the patricians
of Assisi swore fealty to your highness.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: Oh, yes. He was absent then. I wonder where he was.
Anyway, he is present now, and he hasn't troubled to repair the
omission. It almost seems as if his absence might have been
intentional. (<i>He turns to the window again.</i>) Scipione, I
should like to discover where Messer Gianluca della Pieve has been.
I should like a word with him. Ah, there he goes, striding off.
After him, Scipione. Desire him to attend me here at once.</p>

<p>SCIPIONE: And if he decline to come?</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS (<i>dryly</i>): Persuade him.</p>

<p class="indent1">[SCIPIONE hurries out by main doors. VALENTINOIS
turns to MACCHIAVELLI.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: I wonder now is a connection possible between his
absence and the presence here in Assisi of that lady with whom he
has the bad manners to be so very angry. Pshaw! I am beginning to
start at shadows. But I have walked so long amid snares
that...(<i>He shrugs, and laughs.</i>)</p>

<p>MACCHIAVELLI: That you understand the art of detecting them,
however they may be dissembled.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: Do I? I wish I could detect the snare that
treachery is preparing for me here in Assisi. I have seen signs,
very vague as yet, but very familiar. (He pulls open the breast of
surcoat and doublet, displaying the meshes of a shirt of mail.) I
go in steel, and I never eat or drink without a venom taster at my
elbow to take his chance of hell before me. This it is, Master
Secretary, to be a conqueror. To walk ever in the shadow of
assassins and worse than assassins. Do I rant?</p>

<p>MACCHIAVELLI: Nay, highness, I am admiring your restraint.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: Look at my work. This Romagna was a bloody
playground for rapacious despots, brigands in authority, glutting
themselves like vampires upon their miserable subjects; it has been
cleaned out. Saving that robber's nest of Solignola, the work is
done. The Malatesta, the Vitelli, the Varani, the Oliverotti and
all the rest of that infamous brood of tyrants are gone. The place
no longer reeks like a shambles. Men may breathe, and lift their
heads, and go about their honest lives secure in the protection of
my laws. Yet Venice plots my ruin, bespatters me with calumny,
whilst sending me fawning ambassadors like Sinibaldi and Capello.
Milan seeks to destroy my friendship with the King of France.
Naples conspires with Spain to pull me down.</p>

<p>MACCHIAVELLI: That is the price of achievement. It begets envy.
The man who has no enemies, magnificent, has nothing.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: Then am I rich, indeed! Here, I think, comes
Scipione with our reluctant patrician.</p>

<p class="indent1">[The main doors open to admit GIANLUCA, ushered
in by SCIPIONE; GIANLUCA'S air is one of extreme uneasiness.</p>

<p>MACCHIAVELLI: I take my leave, magnificent...</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: No, no. Let me trespass a moment on your patience.
We have yet to settle the terms of the treaty. This matter asks no
secrecy.</p>

<p>SCIPIONE: Here, highness, is Messer Gianluca della Pieve.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: Ah, yes.</p>

<p class="indent1">[He comes slowly down, his eyes glitteringly
intent upon GIANLUCA'S face, heightening the latter's
uneasiness.</p>

we seemed in danger of having to forgo the honour, we were
constrained to send for you.</p>

<p class="indent1">[GIANLUCA bows, his uneasiness growing to fear.
He does not answer.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: Although you are one of Assisi's first citizens,
you were not present when the patricians took the oath on Sunday

<p>GIANLUCA: I...I judged the opportunity had passed.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: I see. Tell me, Ser Gianluca, when did you leave
Assisi?</p>

<p>GIANLUCA (<i>hesitating</i>): On the day of your potency's
arrival.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: And what was the urgent business that took you from
home at such a moment?</p>

<p class="indent1">[GIANLUCA'S uneasiness is visibly increased.
VALENTINOIS observes it. His tone, silken hitherto, becomes
suddenly of steel.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: Dare you tell us that?</p>

<p class="indent1">[GIANLUCA starts.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: Dare you tell us where you went?</p>

<p class="indent1">[GIANLUCA trembles at that tone of implied
knowledge and menace.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: You hesitate, eh? Faith, well you may. It begins to
occur to you at last that they do not lie who say we have as many
eyes as Argus, and that the men in whom I am interested cannot move
far without my knowledge. Shall I tell you what you dare not tell
me? Shall I tell you where you went, Messer Gianluca?</p>

<p>GIANLUCA (<i>deceived and terrified</i>): Your highness
knows...!</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: Of course I know. What are my spies employed
for?</p>

<p>GIANLUCA (<i>in a tone of explanation and apology</i>): But,
then...you must also know that Count Guido was my father's friend.
We owed him many favours.</p>

<p class="indent1">[VALENTINOIS' surprise at the information thus
trapped, shows a moment on his face, which is averted from
GIANLUCA. There is a sharp movement from SCIPIONE, instantly
restrained by MACCHIAVELLI.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: I am not quarrelling with your ill-timed visit to
Count Guido, nor yet with your friendship for him. My quarrel is
with the motives that led you to seek him&mdash;motives which may
cost you dear, Messer Gianluca.</p>

<p>GIANLUCA (<i>in increasing terror</i>): My lord, I...I...took no
willing part in any of the measures concerted at Solignola.</p>

<p class="indent1">[Again there is a flash of understanding on
VALENTINOIS' face.</p>

the Throne of Heaven.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: I require proofs, man; not oaths.</p>

<p>GIANLUCA (<i>abjectly</i>): I...I have no means of proving what
I say.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: Indeed, you have, sir; and you'll afford it me if
you would save your neck.</p>

<p>There is one proof you are overlooking. It is yours to use
frankness with me now. Thus you may convince me of your honesty:
that you were caught unawares in that net of treason. But you are
careful to tell me nothing. (<i>He adds on a sudden
inspiration.</i>) You do not even mention...the lady who was lately
with me.</p>

<p class="indent1">[GIANLUCA recoils in fresh terror.</p>

<p>GIANLUCA: My lord...since you know so much, you will understand
the rest.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: To be sure, I do. But my present concern is with
you personally, Ser Gianluca&mdash;to test your honesty.</p>

<p>GIANLUCA (<i>plunging</i>): Is it not natural, highness, that
being determined upon resistance, Count Guido should have desired
to place his daughter in safety&mdash;to remove her from the
dangers and discomforts of a place besieged? In my having given her
the shelter of my home is there anything that reflects upon my
loyalty to your highness?</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: Is this your honesty? Is this how you prove that
you are not my enemy?</p>

<p>GIANLUCA: It is the truth, magnificent!</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: It is a lie, I say&mdash;a foolish lie.</p>

<p>GIANLUCA (<i>indignation blending with fear</i>): Highness!</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: To pretend that Count Guido's daughter, with all
Italy open to her, should come here for shelter, here to Assisi,
here into my very camp&mdash;a dove into the falconry&mdash;is to
prove yourself a man of poor invention. Your wits are numbed by
your desperate need to find a cloak for the true reason of her
presence. (<i>Harshly</i>) You abuse my patience, sir. You forget
that I have the rack and the hoist at my command.</p>

<p>GIANLUCA: The rack and the hoist! (<i>Indignantly</i>) For me,
highness! I am of patrician blood.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: A fig for your patrician blood! Believe me, it
sheds as easily as any other. They're shedding some of
it&mdash;better blood than yours&mdash;in the market-place at this
moment. Orsini blood, my friend. Shall I hesitate at yours?</p>

<p>GIANLUCA: Neither rack nor hoist could extract another word from
me. I have no more to tell.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: You have no more to tell me, eh? An ambiguous
phrase, sir. But I think I read its real meaning. We shall test it
later. Scipione, take Messer della Pieve, and place him under
arrest until I make known my pleasure.</p>

<p>SCIPIONE (<i>to Gianluca</i>): You hear, sir. Come.</p>

<p class="indent1">[GIANLUCA hesitates a moment, then with a shrug
resigns himself, and goes out by the main doors with SCIPIONE. As
the doors close, VALENTINOIS looks at MACCHIAVELLI, and laughs
between amusement and bitterness.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: Well? Do I start at shadows, or is there a
substance behind them? That young man has told us something we were
very far from suspecting. Panthasilea degli Speranzoni is here in
Assisi calling herself Bianca Bracci of Spoleto. She thrusts
herself upon my notice on a trumped-up matter, as I suspect. Her
real object is to enlist my attention and ensnare my senses. Can
you read that riddle?</p>

<p>MACCHIAVELLI: It is extremely simple. She is the bait in the
trap that's set for your highness.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: That, sir, is what I've been telling you. The
riddle is the nature of the trap itself. Can you resolve it.</p>

<p>MACCHIAVELLI: Can your highness</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: Not yet, elusive Socrates. But I shall; and
then...</p>

<p>MACCHIAVELLI: Heaven help Panthasilea degli Speranzoni.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: Ay! I think she'll need the help of Heaven.

masters...</p>

<h4>THE CURTAIN IS LOWERED</h4>
<hr>
<h3>SCENE II</h3>
<p><i>The evening of the same day.</i></p>

<p><i>Having been lowered for a moment to mark the lapse of time,
the curtain rises again upon the same scene. The table has been
drawn down a little farther to the left and is set lengthwise up
and down stage. The armchair is on the left of it; there are
writing materials on this table, and a candlestick with a lighted
candle on a tray. The latter and a couple of lanterns suspended
from the ceiling supply the light of the chamber, which is subdued,
leaving the gallery at the back in gloom. The door in the left flat
stands open, and a glowing light occasionally increases and reddens
to the accompaniment of the audible sighing of bellows. Shadows of
men (off in this room on the left, which is being used as a torture
chamber) flit across the light proceeding thence at the opening of
the scene.</i></p>

<p><i>AT RISE OF CURTAIN, AGABITO GHERARDI is pacing up and down
waiting. The door at the end of the gallery (off left) opens. This
is conveyed by a beam of light along the gallery and a whiff of
languid dance-music played in a distant part of the palace. The
light is instantly cut off as the door is closed again. CORELLA has
entered the gallery. He advances into view, and speaks as he comes
down.</i></p>

<p>CORELLA: Is everything ready, Messer Agabito?</p>

<p>AGABITO (<i>surly</i>): Ready? (<i>He waves a hand towards the
torture chamber.</i>) I've been waiting this half-hour.</p>

<p>CORELLA: His highness is reluctant to leave the dance; as I am,
and with less cause. But he'll be here directly. Where's the
prisoner?</p>

<p>AGABITO: Messer Gianluca has been roused, and awaits the duke's
pleasure in his cell.</p>

<p>CORELLA: And meanwhile the duke's pleasure lies elsewhere; and
who shall blame him? I grudge these moments stolen from the revels,
and God knows I'm no dancing pimp. Why the devil couldn't this
business have waited until morning?</p>

<p>AGABITO: It's the duke's way: always the unexpected. No one ever
knows what's really in his mind. Not even I, his secretary, who
know more than most men.</p>

<p>CORELLA: Hum! I could hazard a guess of what's in his mind
to-night. Have you ever heard of Love, Messer Agabito?</p>

<p>AGABITO (<i>disgusted</i>): Love! Pshaw! Don't be a fool,
Micheletto.</p>

<p>CORELLA: Oh, to be sure, you're half a priest; and so you think
that whilst God created man, the devil invented woman. According to
some of you the devil invented everything that's pleasant. Well,
thanks to him we are very merry up there to-night.</p>

<p>AGABITO: So I judge by the sounds.</p>

<p>CORELLA: And the duke is merry&mdash;merriest of all. He's
fallen headlong into the toils of an Assisian beauty...No; not
Assisian...She is from Spoleto. Bianca Bracci is her name. A
splendid woman. You should see her, Master Secretary. She'd quicken
your sluggish old pulses, warm your coagulating old blood.</p>

<p>AGABITO Pshaw!</p>

<p>CORELLA: She's fired his highness. AGABITO: His highness?</p>

<p>CORELLA I've never seen him so beglamoured. Never. He placed her
beside him at supper, and sat as nearly in her lap as decency
permitted. Then he led her out to dance, as though she were the
first lady in the place. But I tell you she's worthy of the honour.
A magnificent woman, Messer Agabito.</p>

<p>AGABITO: Faugh!</p>

<p>CORELLA: I believe you feed on parchments and sealing-wax, and
your veins are filled with ink. Why...who's this?</p>

<p class="indent1">[The main doors, down right, are opened by the
Swiss guarding them, who enters to admit SCIPIONE.</p>

<p class="indent1">[VALENTINOIS appears in the gallery. He is
resplendent in a ball dress of white and gold (i.e., doublet of
cloth of gold, edged with ermine, and either white hose or hose

Michael, a jewelled girdle, and there are tiny jewels in the
network that confines his hair; there is also a large jewel&mdash;a
long pearl&mdash;in his left ear; he is bareheaded. A pomander ball
of filigree gold, and of the size of a small orange, dangles by a
fine gold chain from his left wrist. Mainly he holds it in his

at it. AGABITO: But the cipher, highness?</p>

eleven letters of the name Panthasilea. Assume it to be that, and

<p class="indent1">[He goes up into the shadows of the gallery.
AGABITO resumes his seat.</p>

<p class="indent1">[The door opens, and CORELLA appears on the
threshold. CORELLA: The prisoner is here, sir.</p>

<p>AGABITO: Let him enter. And do you, Captain, place guards at the
end of the gallery and suffer no one to pass.</p>

<p class="indent1">[CORELLA steps aside. GIANLUCA comes into view
(from the right) between guards in the Borgia livery. He is wrapped
in a cloak, his countenance is pale and wide-eyed with fear.
AGABITO claps his hands and Two EXECUTIONERS enter from doorway
left. They are brawny men, in skin-tight garments, like wrestlers,
the torso cased in leather, the arms bare from the shoulder. They
receive GIANLUCA from his guards, who withdraw. CORELLA goes up and
out by gallery. Dance music, tripping and trivial, strikes up in
the distance just before the door is opened by the departing
CORELLA and is heard, though muffled now, after it has closed. The
EXECUTIONERS drag GIANLUCA forward, visibly shrinking in horror of
them. They pull off and cast away his cloak. From the waist upward
he remains clad only in his shirt. They stand him immediately
opposite to AGABITO, and themselves fall back a little. GIANLUCA
has not seen VALENTINOIS, who should be as nearly as possible
invisible.</p>

<p>GIANLUCA: What do you want with me?</p>

<p class="indent1">[AGABITO'S voice is cold and dispassionate.</p>

<p>AGABITO: Messer Gianluca della Pieve, you are guilty of plotting
with Count Guido degli Speranzoni, Tyrant of Solignola, against the
High and Mighty Lord Cesare Borgia, Duke of Valentinois and
Romagna, Prince of Andria and Venafri; and of having prepared here
in Assisi a pitfall for this same high and mighty lord. Thereby you
have deserved death. But worse than death have you deserved when it
is considered that his highness is Gonfalonier of Holy Church, that
the battles he fights are the battles of the Holy See. Thus you
offend not only against the Duke's Magnificence, but against God
and His earthly Vicar, Our Holy Father, the Pope. Yet since the
Church in her infinite mercy has said Nolo mortem peccatoris, sed
ut magis convertatur et vivat," his Highness, in our Holy Father's
name, desires to spare you, so that you make frank and full
confession of your offence.</p>

<p>GIANLUCA: I have nothing to confess.</p>

<p>AGABITo: Look yonder, and assure yourself that we do not lack
the means to unseal your lips if you prove obstinate.</p>

<p>We have at our command cord and fire and water. Be sure that
when we cannot twist out truth, we can burn it out or flood it
out.</p>

<p>GIANLUCA: You have not the right. It is not lawful. I am a
patrician; by my birth and blood immune from torture.</p>

<p>AGABITO: Had you offended merely against an earthly potentate,
that plea might avail you. It cannot avail you here. So be
reasonable, and confess.</p>

<p>GIANLUCA (<i>obstinately</i>): I have nothing to confess.</p>

<p class="indent1">[AGABITO sighs heavily. His voice is sad.</p>

<p>AGABITO: Executioners, do your office. First, the hoist.</p>

<p class="indent1">[The EXECUTIONERS seize GIANLUCA. One of them
twists the patient's wrists behind him, the other pinions them.</p>

<p>GIANLUCA (<i>in a moan</i>): No...No.</p>

<p class="indent1">[VALENTINOIS emerges into view.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: Wait!</p>

<p class="indent1">[He waves the EXECUTIONERS away. They fall back,
leaving him alone with GIANLUCA in midstage.</p>

<p class="indent1">[GIANLUCA, amazed by his sudden appearance,
stares at him in terrified fascination. VALENTINOIS' face is sad,
his eyes pitiful, his voice very soft and persuasive.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: Messer Gianluca, consider what you do. Consider
what is before you. You may have seen the hoist at work; you have
perhaps seen it wrench a man's arms from their sockets. (<i>He
places a hand on Gianluca's shoulder, and tightens its
grip.</i>)</p>

<p class="indent1">[GIANLUCA winces, writhes and cries out in
pain.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: Consider by that how little you are fitted to
endure the cord. Be assured that you will speak in the end. And
when you have spoken, what do you think must follow? Once the hoist
has gripped you, you become the property of the law, and when the
law has made you speak, the law will silence you forever. From the
agonies of a broken body, your release lies through the strangler's
hands.</p>

<p class="indent1">[GIANLUCA, shaking off the spell of the other's
persuasiveness, his voice strident.</p>

<p>GIANLUCA: I...I have nothing to tell you. Your arts cannot
conquer me.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: They are very compassionate arts, compassionately
employed. I admonish you to confess, so that you may be forgiven,
so that you may spare that fair body from being broken and
destroyed. Judge whether I admonish you in any interests but your
own, when I tell you that you can confess nothing&mdash;nothing
material&mdash;that is not already known to me.</p>

<p>GIANLUCA (<i>with a laugh, half-hysterical, half-ironic</i>): Is
it because all is known to you that you are at such pains to make
me speak?</p>

<p class="indent1">[VALENTINOIS moves away; he speaks frostily,
indifferently, the pomander to his nostrils.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: I see that I must leave you to the tormentors. I
have no time to waste in convincing you, for Madonna Panthasilea
awaits me impatiently above stairs. She waits for me with smiles of
allurement that might be very dangerous did I not know them false
and treacherous as the false name of Bianca Bracci by which she
calls herself. Her net is spread, and richly baited with her own
luscious beauty; and she waits confident of her haul; so confident
that already this evening has she written to her father&mdash;the
scoundrel father who has committed her to this vileness&mdash;that
within a week her work will be complete.</p>

<p class="indent1">[He looks at GIANLUCA, who is gaping
awe-stricken. He laughs.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: You see? Do you still think that you can discover
anything that will harm your friends? Do you still doubt that I am
other than compassionate when I admonish you to have pity on
yourself?</p>

<p>GIANLUCA: But what is there left to tell? Already you appear to
know more than I do.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: There is one little thing you can discover for me.
The precise nature of this snare that has been set. Tell me that,
and you shall have your life and immunity from this.</p>

<p>GIANLUCA: I cannot. You shall have no evidence from me that you
can use to this lady's hurt.</p>

<p class="indent1">[In the passionate tone, VALENTINOIS detects
GIANLUCA'S true feeling for the lady. His understanding is
reflected on his face. He pauses a moment, then speaks quietly
again.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIs: To her hurt? Haven't I evidence enough already? If
you would serve her, you will answer me, for if you don't I may
have to place her where you now stand.</p>

<p>GIANLUCA (<i>in horror</i>): What?</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: Unless I know enough to avoid the trap, I must take
measures to protect myself. The first of these will be to have
Monna Panthasilea strangled.</p>

<p>GIANLUCA: Oh-h!</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: What else? Am I unreasonable to value my own life
more than I value hers?</p>

<p>GIANLUCA: Your life? Your life is not aimed at!</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: So, so! I thought there was more than murder here.
What, then? Answer me if you would save yourself and her.</p>

<p>GIANLUCA (<i>after a pause</i>): Oh, God pity me! I can't!</p>

<p class="indent1">[VALENTINOIS considers him a moment.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: Very well. Then I will send for her. (<i>To the
EXECUTIONERS.</i>) Loosen his bonds. Restore him his cloak.</p>

<p class="indent1">[He is obeyed, to GIANLUCA'S increasing
bewilderment.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: When she comes I will confront her with you, her
accuser and betrayer.</p>

<p>GIANLUCA: You fiend! You&mdash;a prince, a great
conqueror&mdash;and you'd stoop to that vile lie.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: It is the truth.</p>

<p>GIANLUCA: The truth.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: The truth, you fool. It was you who first betrayed
her identity to me this morning when I questioned you. It was you
who disclosed to me this plot, of which until then I had not
dreamed.</p>

<p>GIANLUCA (<i>in agony</i>): O God! You tricked me.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: Will she believe that? Will she believe that coming
straight from quarrelling with her, it was by accident that you
betrayed her?</p>

<p>GIANLUCA: You devil! Do your worst! I will say nothing further
to her hurt.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: To her hurt? It is your silence that will hurt her.
Come, come, Messer Gianluca, will you speak now or will you wait
until you see her stretched upon the rack?</p>

<p>GIANLUCA: The rack! For her! You cannot! You dare not!</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: Dare not! (<i>To Agabito.</i>) Tell Micheletto to
bring Monna Panthasilea...Monna Bianca Bracci here.</p>

<p class="indent1">[AGABITO moves to obey.</p>

<p>GIANLUCA (<i>headlong</i>): I'll tell you. I'll tell you.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: Speak, then!</p>

<p>GIANLUCA: The aim of the plot is to take you alive, and carry
you to Petrucci at Siena, there to hold you as a hostage whilst
extracting terms from the Pope.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: Aha! And how is this to be accomplished?</p>

<p>GIANLUCA: I don't know. That was a matter to be determined by
Monna Panthasilea as the opportunity should serve her.</p>

<p class="indent1">[VALENTINOIS looks steadily into his face, and
nods at last.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: What assistance has she here in Assisi?</p>

<p>GIANLUCA: I don't know. She depended upon me. But I rebelled
against her using herself in this unworthy way. It was on that we
quarrelled, and I swore to hold aloof.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: So that she will not find your absence strange.
Hum! (<i>He turns abruptly, claps his hands and calls.</i>)
Micheletto!</p>

<p class="indent1">[The door at the end of the gallery opens, and
CORELLA advances; the music swells up in the closing strains of the
dance, and presently ceases altogether.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: Take Messer Gianluca della Pieve back to his
prison. See that he is closely guarded.</p>

<p class="indent1">[MICHELETTO opens doors of main entrance; at a
sign from him the guards re-enter. GIANLUCA staggers up, a man
overwrought.</p>

disguising himself as a clown. And mark this: you are to capture no
more messengers at present.</p>

<p>SCIPIONE: I am to allow letters to pass into Solignola?</p>

receive are likely to lull their vigilance, and we shall find it
easier to complete the mine without interference. I shall ride over
in the morning with Micheletto, and give you clear instructions
about the excavations, and also about mounting batteries elsewhere
as a blind upon our real aim. You may go.</p>

<p>SCIPIONE (<i>bowing</i>): Highness!</p>

<p class="indent1">[He goes out, after an intrigued and sympathetic
glance in the direction of the waiting Ramirez. VALENTINOIS sits
down at the table. As the door closes, he takes up the sword, and
looks at Ramirez.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: Well, Ramirez? You had something to say to me, I
think.</p>

<p>RAMIREZ: Only to plead with your highness. I admit my fault. I
am a hot-blooded, quick-tempered scoundrel, and I deserve your
anger. But I urge my tried loyalty as a plea for more merciful
punishment than dismissal from your service.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: You find it harsh?</p>

<p>RAMIREZ: Almost as harsh and dishonouring as the epithet your
highness cast at me. To call me "dog"and publicly! I am a soldier,
scarred in your service and of proven excellence as a leader...</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: And of an equally proven fidelity to me. Am I a
fool, Ramirez, or are you?</p>

<p>RAMIREZ: Your highness means?</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: I have not many servants like you, Ramirez; hardly
another whom I esteem so highly; certainly no other whom I trust
more fully. To dismiss you for a trivial fault, I must be a fool.
To believe that I could mean it, you must be a fool.</p>

<p>RAMIREZ: I don't understand.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: Dullard! I dismissed you publicly in the terms I
employed, for the belief of others, not your own. If I called you
"dog" in public, I call you "friend" in private. It was necessary
for the service I require of you.</p>

<p class="indent1">[He holds out the sword to Ramirez. RAMIREZ
bounds forward to take it.</p>

<p>RAMIREZ: Highness!</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: Listen. There is a plot here in Assisi, which aims
at my liberty, possibly at my life. Go forth now, breathing
vengeance, a man bitterly wronged, dismissed before witnesses,
harshly and with infamy. Denounce me publicly in terms as infamous.
Proclaim me a thief, a liar, a murderer, what you will. But let
yourself be freely heard. Announce it as your aim, henceforth, to
avenge the affront I put upon you. Make big talk of your impugned
Castilian honour. You will not have long to waIt before your hate
is offered employment. You will be just the tool for treacherous
hands. You understand?</p>

<p>RAMIREZ: Completely. I am your man, my lord.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: Good! About it, then, my friend.</p>

<p>RAMIREZ: The taverns of Assisi shall ring to-night with your

<p>VALENTINOIS: Excellent! The ambassadors of the Most Serene
Republic will imagine themselves back in Venice.</p>

concerned to make it speedier. That is all. Although his Holiness

<h2><a name="ch-3" id="ch-3"></a>ACT III</h2>
<hr>
<p><i>A Room in the Pieve Palace at Assisi.</i></p>

<p><i>A nobly proportioned room, the walls tapestried, the ceiling
frescoed, the floor paved in black and white marbles.</i></p>

<p><i>In the back flat three glass doors open upon a balustraded
terrace. Three steps from the stage level lead up to these doors.
Beyond the balustrade we see a moonlit garden, dimly figured on the
back cloth, with spear-like cypresses standing black against the
faintly luminous sky.</i></p>

<p><i>There are four sets of twin pillars at the back, two of these
being placed between the windows, the other two flanking them. A
rod crosses these pillars near their capitals, carrying leather
curtains which are gilded, and tinted in dull reds and
blues.</i></p>

<p><i>There are double doors in the right flat; about midway up and
above them, this flat sets on an angle to the back, with a small
single door in it. This is the door to Panthasilea's
bedroom.</i></p>

<p><i>There is a large, projecting fireplace with a broad
overmantel low down on the left. Below this stands an armchair.
Raked across stage, just above the fireplace, there is a long
settle of carved wood, with leather cushions. Above this settle
stands a wooden lectern on which an open volume&mdash;an
illuminated manuscript. A little to the right of midstage there is
a fairly substantial table, at which are placed two armchairs, all
of carved and gilded wood, the chairs being upholstered in wrought
and tinted leather. On this table a gold salver, bearing a gold
beaker, and three tall venetian glasses.</i></p>

<p><i>A candlebranch of gold carrying six lighted candles is placed
upon the broad overmantel. From this the room is suffused with
golden light, which contrasts with the cold moonlight
outside.</i></p>

<p><i>AT RISE OF CURTAIN the middle window stands open to the
terrace.</i></p>

<p class="indent1">GIULIA is alone, lounging on the settle.</p>

<p class="indent1">[Immediately the doors R. are opened by
GIOVANNI, who ENTERS.</p>

<p class="indent1">[GIULIA swings her feet to the ground, and sits
up.</p>

<p>GIULIA: What is it, Giovanni?</p>

<p>GIOVANNI: Prince Sinibaldi is here, Monna Giulia, craving
audience of madonna.</p>

<p>GIULIA (<i>rising</i>): Madonna is in her room. But admit his

ushers SINIBALDI, then withdraws.</p>

<p>SINIBALDI: Why have the duke's visits ceased abruptly? For two
days&mdash;yesterday and to-day&mdash;he has not been near your
lady. Does he...does he suspect?</p>

<p>GIULIA: How does your excellency know that he has not been?</p>

<p>SINIBALDI: How do I know? Just as I know&mdash;just as all
Assisi knows&mdash;that for four days he was assiduous in his
visits. For two hours and more each afternoon the street was
blocked by his waiting escort.</p>

<p>GIULIA (<i>laughing</i>): That is why.</p>

<p>SINIBALDI: That is why? Why what?</p>

<p>GIULIA: By his devotion he was rendering madonna the talk of all
Assisi. For her reputation's sake she desired him to practise more
discretion.</p>

<p>SINIBALDI: Discretion! Surely this is not a time for prudish
qualms!</p>

Monna Bianca Bracci of Spoleto. Have we not danced together at the
Communal? How, then, is it strange that like the Lord Cesare
Borgia, I should come to pay my homage to the fairest lady in
Assisi?</p>

a woman moving now mechanically in a task that has become
repellent. Her distaste for SINIBALDI is manifest, and merely held
in check by her appreciation of his position and her own.</p>

<p>SINIBALDI: For two days&mdash;yesterday and to-day&mdash;he has
not been here, and I understand from Monna Giulia that this is by
your own desire.</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: Naturally. It was not possible for me to have
Valentino seized whilst his escort was at my door.</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: So you presume to question. I shall be glad to know
your right.</p>

<p>SINIBALDI: No, no. I am not here to question, but to warn. And
now, it seems, I am too late.</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: To warn, do you say?</p>

final assault upon Solignola will be delivered at any moment
now.</p>

and there is an end to this fine opportunity.</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA (<i>commanding herself</i>): True. But why assume
that already it is too late?</p>

<p>SINIBALDI: If already Valentino should have paid you his last
visit...</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: He has not. He will be here soon.</p>

<p>SINIBALDI (<i>startled</i>): Eh?</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: I expect him at the second hour of night.</p>

<p>SINIBALDI (<i>amazed</i>): What? You have given him an
assignation? Here?</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: How else was it to be contrived? Now you understand
why I bade him visit me no more, on the ground that his escort
waiting in the street was destructive of my reputation.</p>

<p>SINIBALDI: Yes, yes! And so?</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA And so, desiring neither to render me a subject for
scandal, nor yet to forgo his visits, he did as I expected&mdash;he
begged the key of the garden gate that he might come in secret and
alone.</p>

<p>SINIBALDI: By Heaven! But that was shrewdly played, madonna!</p>

<p class="indent1">[PANTHASILEA turns to GIULIA.</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: Bid them send Santafiora to me here at once.</p>

<p class="indent1">[GIULIA nods, and goes out.</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: I am glad your excellency approves me.</p>

<p>SINIBALDI,: Approve you? I am lost in wonder. You...you have no
doubt...You...are sure that he will come?</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: Oh, yes. He came last night; and he will come
again.</p>

<p>SINIBALDI: He came last night, do you say?</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: I said so. Yes. (<i>Half defiantly.</i>)</p>

<p>SINIBALDI (<i>between amazement and anger</i>): He came last
night, and you allowed him to depart again?</p>

<p class="indent1">[She is silent, hanging her head a little. His
indignation rises, fanned by suspicion.</p>

<p>SINIBALDI: What does it mean? Can that squeamish fool Gianluca
have been pestering you again?</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: Gianluca? Gianluca is sulking. I have not seen him
since I dismissed him a week ago.</p>

<p>SINIBALDI: But then...?</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA (<i>a little lamely</i>) My preparations were not
quite complete. I...I could not risk a failure.</p>

<p>SINIBALDI (<i>anxiously</i>): And to-night?</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: All is ready.</p>

<p>SINIBALDI: If you need help...</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: I have men enough. Besides, he trusts me so
completely; he is so utterly without suspicion...</p>

<p>SINIBALDI: You are sure? You are quite sure?</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: Would he come in secret and alone if he were
not?</p>

<p>SINIBALDI: No. I suppose not. And yet...he is subtle as all the
fiends.</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: This time his subtleties are blunted. (<i>She sties
a sigh.</i>) Before morning he will be on his way to Siena, a
helpless captive.</p>

<p>SINIBALDI: Eh? I marvel that you will still trouble to send him
to Siena.</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: Is not that what was concerted?</p>

<p>SINIBALDI: Yes; but at a time when there was no thought for such
circumstances as you have so cleverly contrived. This alters
everything. He comes in secret and alone&mdash;in secret and alone!
When he fails to return, none will know what has become of him.
None will even know whether he is alive or dead. He will have
vanished, leaving no trace. Why trouble, then, to send him to
Siena?</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: What else?</p>

<p>SINIBALDI: What else? Is it not plain?</p>

<p class="indent1">[He ceases abruptly as the door opens.</p>

<p class="indent1">[SANTAFIORA comes in. He is armed and wears a
peaked cap of steel.</p>

<p>SANTAFIORA: You sent for me, madonna. (<i>He perceives
Sinibaldi, and bows formally.</i>) Lord Prince.</p>

he leaves. It would be best of all in here...</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA (<i>shrinking</i>): No, no!</p>

<p class="indent1">[SANTAFIORA shrugs and bows his acquiescence.
She continues.</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: At least not if it can be avoided. Post your men in
the garden. Await him there&mdash;unless I should meanwhile call
you.</p>

<p>SANTAFIORA: Very well, madonna. I shall be near at hand.</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: And you will remember that he is to be taken
alive?</p>

<p>SANTAFIORA: Of course. But this duke is a man of his hands. He
has the strength of any other three.</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: That is why there are six of you to do this
thing.</p>

<p>SANTAFIORA: True. But if he gives trouble, if he should kill a
man or two before we make him fast, I cannot answer for the temper
of my fellows.</p>

<p>SINIBALDI: Of course not.</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: I tell you, Santafiora, he must be taken alive.
Alive he is worth a thousand times as much as dead. You
understand?</p>

<p>SANTAFIORA: Madonna, you may depend upon me to deliver him to
you&mdash;alive if possible.</p>

<p>SINIBALDI: I will pray Heaven that it may not be possible. Thus,
considering what a man is Valentino, believe me it will prove best
in the end.</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA (<i>faintly scornful</i>): For Venice, no doubt; but
not for Solignola.</p>

<p class="indent1">[GIULIA comes in by the double doors.</p>

draws the curtains across all three. PANTHASILEA, meanwhile
dejectedly seats herself, staring into the fire.</p>

behind PANTHASILEA and stands considering her a moment.</p>

<p>GIULIA (<i>fondly</i>): Madonna!</p>

<p class="indent1">[PANTHASILEA looks up at her, and attempts to
smile her gratitude for this solicitude. She raises a hand to pat
GIULIA'S. GIULIA takes it in both her own.</p>

<p>GIULIA: How cold you are!</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA Cold ay! Cold and sick. I begin to see that Gianluca
was right; that this is a loathly Judas-trick.</p>

<p>GIULIA: It was a Judas-trick that lured Pietro Varano to his
end.</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA (<i>stiffening</i>): I know. That is what I tell
myself when I feel my courage melting. Because of that I shall
carry this thing through. But I think I shall hate myself for ever
after.</p>

<p>GIULIA: Yet many will love and bless you for it, madonna. Dwell
on that.</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: O God, help me! All that I can dwell on is his
trust in me. He comes here so confidingly, so full of tender
homage, so unsuspicious of the knife to which he bares his
throat.</p>

<p>GIULIA: How often has he not lured others so?</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: Do you know that sometimes I ask myself if that be
true? When he talks, when he tells me of his dreams and aims, when
he reveals the vileness of those upon whom he has made war, I begin
to doubt the evil that is said of him by such men as...Sinibaldi.
(<i>Scornfully.</i>) Sinibaldi! A creature steeped in treachery,
sly, faithless, cruel, cynically using us, as he uses all men, to
his own ends.</p>

<p>GIULIA: But surely, madonna, it is too well known that this Duke
Valentino...</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: Because a thing is well known, it does not follow
that it is true. Consider, Giulia. We were led to believe this duke
an odious monster. From what is said of him we had looked to find
some horror of a man, malformed, prematurely aged and ravaged by
disease and the wrath of Heaven. Instead...(<i>She shrugs and makes
a little gesture of scorn and helplessness.</i>)</p>

<p>GIULIA (<i>sighing</i>): Ah yes! He is beautiful. No woman could
deny that. But his beauty is from the devil. He is wicked and cruel,
and he prevails by evil arts.</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: Pshaw!</p>

<p>GIULIA: Do not sneer, madonna. Take heed, lest he bewitch
you.</p>

<p class="indent1">[Two strokes of a deep-toned bell.</p>

<p>GIULIA: Remember Pietro Varano, dear madonna. Remember
Solignola, which depends upon you, and which will be lost if you
should weaken.</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: Weaken? Why, what matter now even if I should? Once
he is here, the matter is accomplished. Sh! I hear his step.</p>

<p class="indent1">[She rises, and with GIULIA turns to face the
curtained windows. A moment they wait. Then the curtain masking the
middle window is swept aside, and VALENTINOIS surges on the
threshold. An instant he stands there raking the room with his
glance.</p>

<p class="indent1">[Wrapped in a hooded black cloak, he is in
silhouette against the moonlight flooding the terrace behind him.
Then he heaves a sigh that may be of satisfaction, and closes the
window, but leaves the curtain drawn aside.</p>

<p class="indent1">[He comes down, and at the foot of the steps
lets his long mantle slip from his shoulders, emerging in
close-fitting scarlet relieved only by a golden girdle from which
hang dagger and purse.</p>

<p class="indent1">[GIULIA cries out at the first sight of his
cloaked and hooded figure. Having cast his cloak, he advances,
speaking.</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA (<i>her voice strained</i>): In fear, my lord?</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS (<i>advancing towards her</i>): How else are you to
be approached, madonna, but in fear?</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA (<i>dissembling her uneasiness</i>): In fear of
what?</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: Of loss of liberty.</p>

<p class="indent1">[She starts.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: For what man can account himself free who has met
your glance? What man can be other than a slave thereafter?...You
laugh!</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA (<i>breathing again</i>): My lord, as a courtier,
you outshine even the great soldier that you are.</p>

feet a courtier's part contents me.</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: You may leave us, Giulia.</p>

<p class="indent1">[GIULIA curtsies in leave-taking, and goes out.
At the door she pauses a moment, looking back upon them almost in
fear. Meanwhile, PANTHASILEA at the table is taking up the beaker,
and addressing VALENTINOIS anew.</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: A cup of wine, my lord?</p>

<p class="indent1">[She pours for him. He advances to take the cup.
VALENTINOIS: With all my heart.</p>

<p class="indent1">[He takes the glass and raises it towards his
lips, but checks midway. His eyes narrow, and grow keen as they
regard her. She is about to fill a second glass, when he stays her,
covering it with his hand. She looks up at him in surprise. His
countenance is again smiling and normal. Leaning towards her, he
proffers his own glass.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: One cup for us twain, I do beseech it, lady, humbly
conscious of my unworthiness. (<i>On a sudden muted note of
passion.</i>) Pledge me, then, and leave the wine the richer by the
fragrance of your lips.</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA (<i>drawing back, as if to refuse</i>): My lord!</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: Nay, now, I insist.</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: You insist?</p>

<p class="indent1">[As she stares at him, a smile of understanding
slowly breaks upon her face. Without another word, she drinks half
the contents of the glass, then hands it to him.</p>

<p class="indent1">[He takes it, heaving a sigh of satisfaction. As
he drinks she speaks.</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: You are content, I trust.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS (<i>smiling, as he sets down the cup</i>): I see you
understand. ForgIve the unworthy doubt. I should have known that
one so lovely, one in whose eyes honour and truth shine so brightly
and clearly, must be incapable of treachery or baseness. But I have
walked so long amid snares, that mistrust of wine and steel is
become an instinct. Forgive.</p>

<p class="indent1">[She forces a light laugh, as she replies.</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: Nay, my lord. I am honoured that you should appoint
me to the exalted office of venom-taster in your household.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: I accept the rebuke. It is deserved, alas! My
instinct conquered reason, which should have assured me that here,
at least, I have nothing to fear.</p>

<p class="indent1">[He is standing before her now, his back to the
un-curtained window, which she faces.</p>

<p class="indent1">[The figure of a man in a peaked steel cap like
that worn by SANTAFIORA is silhouetted for a moment against it by
the moonlight. Catching sight of it, she shrinks a little. The
figure passes, and disappears. He has not observed it.</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA (<i>her voice trembling a little</i>): It is very
chill. The wind is in the north.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: Come nearer to the fire, my Bianca.</p>

<p class="indent1">[Holding her hands in his own left, he slips his
right arm round her waist to conduct her. She makes a
half-protest.</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: My lord!...</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: Would you play the north wind to me? Would you use
me coldly on this my last evening with you?</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA (<i>with a catch in her voice</i>): Your last
evening!</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: Of course you do not know. Come, I will tell
you.</p>

<p class="indent1">[She allows him to conduct her to the fire. He
sinks to the settle, his back to the window. She remains standing
before him, facing the window and him.</p>

<p class="indent1">[The silhouette returns. Having reached
mid-window, it halts there; the peaked steel headpiece, such as
that worn by SANTAFIORA, is discernible in the outline.</p>

summons.</p>

<p class="indent1">[The silhouette moves again, crossing slowly to
the left, and vanishing. Her eyes never quit it. The moment it has
disappeared, she leaves him, and goes quickly up towards the

I have not long to stay.</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: But why, my lord?</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: Because at dawn we deliver the final assault, which
is to carry Solignola.</p>

before.</p>

Solignola is one of those few things.</p>

circumstance.</p>

tell you? Are you not my friend? My one true and loyal friend in a
land that swarms with enemies and betrayers? Are you not,
Bianca?</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: Indeed, my lord.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS (<i>heaving a sigh of content</i>): I do love to
hear you protest it! It warms me like wine. Listen, then: There is
here in Assisi a plot&mdash;a shrewd and well-laid plot&mdash;to
destroy me.</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA (<i>shrilly</i>): My lord!</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: Nay, do not start. It is no new thing. For years
now I have walked constantly in the shadow of death and betrayal.
Custom has robbed them of their terrors for me. They charge the air
I breathe with a stimulus that makes me strong. Without them I
might grow soft, and languish. Well, then, this plot: It was
hatched in Solignola by the Speranzoni, and so confident are they
of its success...Nay, do not tremble, child! There is no real cause
for alarm.&mdash;They are so confident of its success, so drugged
and lulled by this confidence, that they have kept a negligent
watch up there at Solignola. Thus we have been able to mine the
Southern wall at a spot where a week ago I spied out a weakness.
They have offered us no hindrance, wIth the result that our
operations are complete. At dawn we fire the mine, and enter
through the breach. The Speranzoni meet the fate of those who lean
on treachery.</p>

<p class="indent1">[A silence.</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA But it still wants some hours to dawn. Betwixt this

<p>VALENTINOIS: Why! What do you fear for me, gentle lady?</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: You spoke of a plot&mdash;a shrewd and well-laid
plot to destroy you.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: How sweet is this concern! I vow you are trembling.
Oh, dismiss your every fear. With the strength of the bull that is
the emblem of my house, I combine the cunning of the fox. There
have been more plots against my life, I do believe, than against
the life of any man since Adam. Where are the plotters now? Mostly
dead of the death they had prepared for me. They have my pity, poor
deluded fools! My pity and my prayers. God rest their evil, foolish
souls!</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: But this present plot may not be like those others.
This time the plotters may prevail. And if they did...</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: Pooh! Why have they not yet struck? Because
opportunity has been denied them. And now it is too late.</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: Too late? You are sure?</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: I am sure. None knows of my presence here to-night
save you and Monna Giulia.</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: We...we might be in the plot.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS (<i>laughing</i>): Dear saint! If I were capable,
without good reason, of suspecting you of any vileness, why, then I
should be unworthy to sit beside you here.</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: Yet just now you suspected my wine.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: Am I not forgiven an offence that was born of
habit? Besides, to prepare the wine there were other hands than
yours. (<i>Taking one of her hands.</i>) These gentle hands that
could never dispense anything but charity and good.</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA (<i>withdrawing her hand, shrinking</i>): My lord!

<p class="indent1">[She is silent.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: What cause can I have given? (<i>Passionately.</i>)

not tell yourself what joy and consolation it has been to me to
find here a blessed haven, a sanctuary where falsehood and evil
have no room, where, secure from peril, I may for a brief fleeting
hour forget the world and turbulent ambition? Do not those feminine
intuitions, said to be never failing, tell you that this Cesare
Borgia, regarded in Italy as a dread conqueror, is here a
slave&mdash;your creature, to do with as you will? Ha! If those who
hate me had but won you to their service, in what a trap might I
not now be caught</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA (<i>trembling</i>): Why...O why do men hate you
so?</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: Why? Hate, madonna, is the first-born of fear, and
I have made men fear me.</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: If I were a man and had your power, lord duke, I
should prefer to make men love me.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: And how would you win the love of such creatures as
those upon whom it is my duty to make war? Can you name one amongst
them who deserves love, respect, or even mercy, at my hands?</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: Some you have slain who did no more so it is
said&mdash;than defend their right.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: "So it is said." That introduces every tale of my
misdeeds. Whom have you heard named?</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: More than one, I think.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS (<i>frowning</i>): Eh? Their names, madonna!</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: There...there was Oliverotto, Lord of Fermo.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: A brigand who butchered his own uncle that he might
usurp his place, and who would have sold me to the Orsini faction.
Should I have pitied such a scoundrel?</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: You cannot say the same of the Varano.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: Did I slay old Giulio? Nay, now...</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: But you slew his son, Pietro...Pietro Varano.</p>

<p class="indent1">[She speaks the name between tenderness and

<p>VALENTINOIS: Pietro Varano! Yes! What do you know of him?</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: I...What should I know? No more than what is
said.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: Not all of that, I hope. For there are things said
of him&mdash;and they are true&mdash;of which such purity as yours
were best in ignorance. You never heard perhaps how he
treaCherously poisoned Paolo degli Uberti because he coveted
Uberti's wife?</p>

<p class="indent1">[She wheels upon him suddenly, quivering with
anger, her voice shrill.</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: Do you say that of Pietro Varano? It is false! A
wicked, evil lie!</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: It does credit to your charity that you should so
believe it. But it is true, none the less. Pietro Varano was like
that&mdash;an evil devil in an angel's shape.</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: O God! It can't be true! It can't!</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: You are oddly moved. Does it happen, after all,
that you knew this fellow Varano?</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: I did. I knew him well, and honoured him.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: Alas! For what I say is true. I had the tale from
the lips of Uberti when he lay dying. He was a condottiero in my
service, and my friend. I swore to him that I would see justice
done; and when Camerino fell, I did not forget. I never do. I
always pay&mdash;as you'll discover when you know me better.</p>

<p>Varano was like all these petty tyrants whom I have
expunged&mdash;from Imola, Faenza, Pesaro, Rimini and the rest a
faithless steward. He was of those set to rule in</p>

<p>Romagna as Vicars of the Holy See. Instead, abusing their
trusts, they have ground the people to their own profit; grown
arrogant, they have rebelled against the authority of their
overlord, the Pope, from whom they hold their fiefs, and fallen to
brigand warfare among themselves. They have soaked the soil of this
Romagna in blood. Because I drove them out I am hated. But by whom
P Is it by the people of this Romagna P Nay. They hail me as a
deliverer. My best troops are Romagna men, who come flocking to my
banner, eager to throw off the yoke of their oppressors.</p>

<p>The men who hate me are the glutted tyrants I have deposed, and
the rulers of the great Italian States of Venice, Milan and Naples
who jealously dread my consolidation of this dismembered Romagna
into one great power that shall be the equal of themselves. Oh, and
there is more than that. Venice&mdash;covetous, peddling Venice,
had looked with eyes of greed upon the Romagna seaports. That greed
I have frustrated. And now Venetian spite vents itself in calumnies
of me and mine that are spreading over Europe with the rank
luxuriance of all evil growths. There is no crime that is not now
attributed to us, no vice so foul but that it is our daily habit,
no evil lust by which we are not obsessed. The least that is said
of me is that I am a murderer, that the poison cup and the dagger
are my tools.</p>

<p>To-day I hear from Rome that the Cardinal Orsini has died in the
castle of Sant' Angelo, where he was imprisoned because he had
conspired against my house, and already the rumour runs that he was
poisoned by my father. And the rumours of to-day are the history of
to-morrow. There is no evidence, but what matter that? All the
world knows that it is impossible for an old man of seventy to die
a natural death.</p>

<p>But if we had desired his death should we have poisoned him in
secret? When I strike, I strike openly, that others may beware and
tremble&mdash;and justly, always justly.</p>

<p>In Rome there was a scribbler hired by Venice to defame us. He
published a pasquinade in which he represented me and mine as
monsters of infamy. Among the crimes with which he charged me was
the murder of my own brother Gandia, for reasons so grotesquely
horrible that I will not offend your ears with the recItal of
them.</p>

<p>I had him taken. But do you think I killed him?</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: None could have blamed you. What...what did you
do?</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: I let him go.</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: You let him go?</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: All but his tongue and his right hand. Those I kept
that he might never utter or write another slander.</p>

<p>And so, Bianca, when you hear the evil that is so freely spoken
of Valentino, bethink you that evil may have provoked the deeds
with which he is charged.</p>

<p>If I have dwelt on these things in this last of the precious
hours we have spent together, it is that hereafter you may judge me
with that strict justice in which, myself, I deal.</p>

<p class="indent1">[A pause.</p>

<p class="indent1">[Throughout his apologia, her interest, faint at
first, has gradually grown more and more keen. Now that he has done
she sits very pensive.</p>

<p>You are silent, my Bianca! Is it that I have failed to convince
you? Is it that you prefer the voice of slander to my own? Do you
doubt the truth of what I have told you?</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA I do not. I would I could. But you have magic arts
of conviction when you talk.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: You would that you could? Why so?</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA (<i>confused</i>): My lord, I do not know what I am
saying. I am bewildered by your tale. It is at war with all that I
have ever heard of you, and yet (<i>impulsively</i>) God knows it
agrees with what I have come to think for myself during these
days.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: Happy days! Happier in that case than I had even
dreamed them!</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: Tell me this, my lord...What&mdash;what fate do you
reserve to-morrow for Count Guido degli Speranzoni!</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS (<i>He sighs. He seems beset by doubt, by
weakness</i>): That is the question that is troubling me. Count
Guido, I know, is but the catspaw of scheming Venice. It is Venice
that has stiffened him into this resistance. And I should be unjust
if I visited the consequences too heavily upon him. When I shall
have reduced him to obedience, it shall be his to continue Lord of
Solignola, if he will frankly recogniZe his stewardship and
discharge its obligations.</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: Now am I indeed convinced. I see at last how I have
been misled...</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: Misled?</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA (<i>recollecting herself</i>): In the opinions I had
formed.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: Who could blame you? It is not often I am at such
pains to reveal myself as I have been to-night.</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: Why? Why is this?</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: Need you ask, Bianca? Does not the act explain
itself? Can you doubt the motive that urges me to stand well in
your dear eyes?</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: These are but words! (<i>She utters a little laugh,
half bitter.</i>) Will you ever think again, I wonder, when you
pass on to further conquests, of poor Bianca Bracci in her
loneliness?</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS (<i>faintly sardonic</i>): At Spoleto?</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: At...at Spoleto. Where else?</p>

<p class="indent1">[He leans towards her, staring into her eyes
until she draws back, shrinking, as if in fear. He rises, and moves
to the hearth. There, after a moment, he turns, facing her again,
and considering her obvious agitation. Then he speaks softly, his
arms thrown out towards her.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: Shall I come back to you, my Bianca? Shall I seek
you at Spoleto? Would you have it so?</p>

<p class="indent1">[His glance envelops and holds her own,
fascinating her.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: Speak! Answer me, Bianca. My destiny, all my life,
is in your hands at this moment.</p>

<p class="indent1">[The double meaning of the phrase arrests her,
terrifies her. Suddenly she begins to weep. She speaks
brokenly.</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: My lord! My lord!</p>

<p class="indent1">[As if compelled and drawn by his glance, she
rises, confronting him. He opens his arms.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: Bianca! Come!</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA (<i>battling against the magnetism of his
personality</i>): Ah, no! no!</p>

<p class="indent1">[She hides her face in her hands. He steps
forward, and takes her by the shoulders.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: Bianca!</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA (piteously, seeking justification for a surrender to
which she is compelled): Say...say that you love me!</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS (<i>laughing softly</i>): That is a bombardment with
which any clown may win a citadel. I ask a free capitulation.</p>

<p class="indent1">[He takes her in his arms. She falls to
shuddering and sobbing against his breast. Over her head, his eyes
look straight ahead into nothingness. They are invested with the
mockery inseparable from knowledge. Then he stoops to kiss
her&mdash;long and passionately. Thereafter, he gently disengages
her arms from his neck, and steps away from her.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: And now, farewell! I leave my soul with you.</p>

<p class="indent1">[She starts in terror, remembering the men who
wait for him in the garden. She clings to him fearfully, her voice
trembling.</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: Ah, no, no! You shall not go!</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS (<i>in surprise</i>): Why? What is this?</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA (<i>panting</i>): Ah, not yet...My lord, do not
leave me yet!</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: Would you tempt me from my duty? You know the work
awaiting me.</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: Yes, yes...I know. But...I know not when I shall
see you next. You ride at dawn. Valentino!</p>

<p class="indent1">[Still clutching the long sleeve of his doublet,
she sinks down, half collapsing upon the settle.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: Sweet temptress!</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: There is something...something I must say to you
before you go.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: You make resistance very hard. But it grows late,
and I have much to do.</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: Ah, not yet. Do not go yet! I am full of dreadful
premonitions. You say there is a plot to destroy you. What...what
if assassins should be lurking out there now, waiting for you?</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: How is that possible? None knows that I am
here.</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: You...you may have been spied upon, and followed.
Oh, my dear lord, do not go hence just yet. Here&mdash;in here with
me&mdash;at least you are safe. Do not leave me racked by fear for
you...</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: Sweet persuader!</p>

<p class="indent1">[He kisses her again, and moves towards window.
She bars his way.</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA (<i>desperately</i>): I can't let you go! I
can't!</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: You can't? Why?</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: Because...(<i>She checks, shrinking from giving the
true reason. Then pleads desperately.</i>) Give me an hour,
Valentino...just one little hour.</p>

<p class="indent1">[Looking at her, he slowly yields.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: You turn my will to water. Let ambition go hang! I
am but mortal man. Though Solignola should go unconquered for
to-morrow, here I stay since you so bid me. (<i>He takes her in his
arms.</i>)</p>

<h4>THE CURTAIN SLOWLY FALLS</h4>
<p class="indent1">[It remains lowered for half a minute to mark
the passing of time.</p>

<h4>THE CURTAIN RISES AGAIN</h4>
<p class="indent1">[The stage is now in darkness, save only for the
glow of the fire and a beam of light from the open doorway of
Panthasilea's room. VALENTINOIS enters thence, and crossing to the
hearth, takes up a taper and lights the extinguished candles on the
overmantel. As he does so, PANTHASILEA, a loose robe about her,
appears in the doorway.</p>

<p class="indent1">[He crosses to her. She clings to him.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIs: The hour is sped&mdash;and more.</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: And in its speeding, it has altered the whole world

<p class="indent1">[He leads her across to the settle.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: It is time for me to go.</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA (<i>wildly</i>): Not yet! You must not leave me yet!
How can you leave me, now?</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: Alas! I must! It is nigh on midnight, and...</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA (<i>interrupting, passionately pleading</i>): You
love me? Say that you love me, Valentino. You have not said it
yet.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: Does it still need words?</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: It does, it does. I must be very sure of it. Oh,
Valentino! (<i>Suddenly, overwrought, she falls to
weeping.</i>)</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: Why do you weep, Bianca?</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: Oh, I am vile! Vile!</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: What are you saying?</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: It is time that you knew.</p>

<p class="indent1">[She speaks in a strained voice. It is obvious
that she preserves her self-control only by an effort.</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: Awhile ago, if you had listened, you might have
heard steps out there.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS (<i>calmly</i>): I did. I heard the gravel crunching
in the garden.</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: You heard! Those were the footsteps of assassins,
brought here by my contriving.</p>

<p class="indent1">[He does not move. Calmly he continues to regard
her, smiling a little. She stares at him a moment, amazed by his
calm. Then she interprets it in her own way.</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: You cannot believe it of me! You think I jest. No,
you think I am testing your affection for me. But it is true, I
tell you&mdash;true! I...I was sent hither to lure you into a trap
that you may be held as a hostage for the safety of Solignola.
I...I am the centre of the plot, of this plot to destroy you which
you suspected.</p>

<p class="indent1">[He continues calmly to regard her, maintaining
his faint smile. Slowly he shakes his head. He speaks, on a note of
incredulity.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: You You, Bianca! The lovely spider in this unclean
web! Pshaw! But if this were so, why should you tell me now?</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: Why? Why? Don't you...don't you see?</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: Unless you mean that because I am now in the trap,
your telling cannot matter...I do not understand.</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: I tell you because I love you. You have made me
love you, Valentino&mdash;until I must break faith with those who
trust me&mdash;betray them all. Love has defeated me. I can no
longer do this vile thing I came to do.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: I see.</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA (<i>stricken by his unalterable calm</i>): You see?
You see?</p>

<p class="indent1">[He looks at her a moment, still smiling and
enigmatic. Then he takes up his hat and cloak, and without a word,
followed by her startled glance, he crosses and goes up to the
window by which he entered. His hand is upon the curtain, when she
speaks, crying out.</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: You do not believe me!</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS (<i>turning</i>): Yes. I believe you.</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: You believe me! But then...? Have you nothing to
say?</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: What can be said to a traitress who makes, as you
have confessed, a snare of her own charms?</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA (<i>stung</i>): Oh-h! And your contempt&mdash;in
spite of all that lies between us&mdash;will suffer you to say no
more than that?</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: No more! (<i>He turns to go.</i>)</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA (<i>suddenly fierce</i>): Take care! My men still
wait. You are walking to your death&mdash;for death it will be at a
word from me.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: Why, what a thing do you conceive me, that I am to
be blown this way and that by every gusty emotion you display. You
think to stir me to love, to pity, to contempt, and now to
fear&mdash;and all at your good pleasure</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA (<i>in mounting anger</i>): Have you only scorn and
mockery for my love and pity?</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: Pity? And shall Cesare Borgia owe his life to your
compassion?</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: You may owe death to your own arrogance, if I but
speak the word.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: Speak it, then. I urge you. Give the signal.</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA (<i>furiously</i>): You will have it so! Why,
then...(<i>Shouting, and beating her hands together.</i>) Ho,
there! To me! Santafiora!</p>

<p class="indent1">[As she calls, VALENTINOIS, with a laugh, sweeps
aside the curtain.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: Let me admit them for you.</p>

<p class="indent1">[He pushes open the windows, then recoils a
little. On the terrace are dimly visible four men in steel caps.

God's name!...Ah!</p>

<p>RAMIREZ: My lord, your orders are fulfilled. We have seized all

<p class="indent1">[RAMIREZ retires, but remains in view at the
back of the terrace with his men.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: From the hour I met you, Panthasilea degli
Speranzoni.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: That, too.</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA (<i>in torturing bewilderment, weakly</i>):
Then...then...Why...?</p>

defenders of Solignola with your daily letters, until we completed
the mine that is to be fired at dawn.</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: And for that...for that you...</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: For that and something more. (<i>Suddenly
exultant.</i>) The lust of Conquest! I accepted this duel against
you and your woman's arts; and your confession when it came should
be the admission that I was conqueror in your heart and soul as I
am conqueror elsewhere, as I shall sit a conqueror to-morrow in
Solignola.</p>

<p class="indent1">[He sweeps her a bow, and goes up.</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA (<i>in a strangled voice</i>): Solignola Oh, God!

<p>VALENTINOIS (<i>pausing on the threshold of the window</i>): For
you? Lady, I leave you the memories of this hour.</p>

<h4>CURTAIN</h4>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-4" id="ch-4"></a>ACT IV</h2>
<hr>
<p><i>A Hall in the Castle of Solignola. (As Act I.)</i></p>

<p><i>It is evening of the following day. In the sky, seen beyond
the loggia, an orange glow of sunset pales gradually to lemon as
the scene proceeds. This fades out thereafter during the act to
palest turquoise and then begins to deepen, first to purple, then
to sapphire blue, with the onset of night.</i></p>

<p><i>The scene is that of the first act. But the upper part of the
stage is now furnished by a large dais upon which a banqueting
table is set. At the middle place on the upper side of this there
is a large, gilded armchair, flanked by two stools on either side;
in addition an armchair is set at each end of the table. A lantern,
on a tall pedestal, stands at each upper end of the dais, and there
are two leather cushions on the dais in front of the table.</i></p>

<p><i>At rise of curtain MICHELETTO DA CORELLA is standing in the
loggia, attended by a PAGE. CORELLA is in armour, stained and
dusty. He has put of his helmet, and his head is cased in a velvet
skull-cap. Two LACKEYS are in the act of completing the furnishings
of the banqueting-table, which consists of a platter, goblet and
knife and spoon at each place, all gilded and decorated; of dishes
of fruit, and tall, decorative wine jugs. A large, beautifully
wrought cup of gold is in the middle place, where the great chair
is set.</i></p>

<p><i>The main doors are open. On the parapet outside Two SWISS,
under the direction of FERRANTE, are hauling down the standard of
the Speranzoni from the castle flag-staff. They tear it from the
halyard and replace it by the banner of Cesare Borgia, which they
proceed to hoist.</i></p>

<p><i>A carillon of joy-bells&mdash;begun before the rise of the
curtain crashes out in fullest volume as the flag soars aloft. With
this comes now a burst of cheering from the courtyard below.
Gradually thereafter the bells diminish, and, with a half-dozen
single strokes, cease altogether.</i></p>

<p><i>The Two LACKEYS, having completed the furnishing of the
table, now withdraw by the small door down right.</i></p>

<p>CORELLA: Thank heaven that's over! If there's a din I hate, boy,
it's the ding-dong of church bells.</p>

<p>PACE: But when they are joy-bells&mdash;and rung for
victory.</p>

<p>CORELLA: Bells are bells, whatever they may be rung
for&mdash;distracting as a scolding woman's tongue. Here, boy, help
me off with my harness.</p>

<p class="indent1">[RAMIREZ enters at back. He, too, is in armour.
CORELLA: Ah, Ramirez! Well come. RAMIREZ: Well found,
Micheletto!</p>

<p class="indent1">[While the talk continues now, the PACE is
assisting CORELLA to disarm&mdash;back and breast, cuissarts and
brassards only, which compose the armour.</p>

<p>RAMIREZ: So the job is really finished! And we labourers can lay
aside our tools. Faith! It proved none so difficult in the end.
These men of Solignola didn't show much spirit.</p>

<p>CORELLA: Spirit? We blew the spirit out of them when we fired
the mine this morning. It took them too completely by surprise.</p>

<p>RAMIREZ: Still, they might have made a better show at the
breach. Why, they were just driven in like sheep in panic. I had
expected more of them.</p>

<p>CORELLA: The fact is, they had expected less of us. Be
thankful.</p>

<p>RAMIREZ: I am. The job is done. We're here, and all is quiet.
Where is the duke?</p>

<p>CORELLA: His highness is closeted with Count Guido (<i>He points
L.</i>), settling the details of the terms, and not to be
disturbed.</p>

<p>RAMIREZ: But I've come for orders.</p>

<p>CORELLA: I have them for you. You are to remain in Solignola
with your troop, to furnish a bodyguard for his highness, and to
escort him hence to-morrow. But you are to order Naldi and Scipione
to withdraw all their men from the town and to encamp them in the
valley.</p>

<p>RAMIREZ: Withdraw them from the town?</p>

<p>CORELLA: His highness will take no risk of pillage or any sort
of violence. See to it, Ramirez. Let your officers remind them that
if any man steals so much as a straw his neck will pay for it.</p>

<p>RAMIREZ: The duke is very tender of these his latest
subjects.</p>

<p>CORELLA: That is his usual way.</p>

<p class="indent1">[The SENESCHAL comes in at back.</p>

<p>CORELLA What is it?</p>

<p>SENESCHAL: The Orators of the Powers are here, to felicitate his
highness upon his victory.</p>

<p>CORELLA: Bid them in.</p>

<p class="indent1">[The SENESCHAL bows and withdraws.</p>

<p>CORELLA: Be off, Ramirez. Draw up your troop in the square
before the Duomo. His highness will be there presently.</p>

<p>RAMIREZ: I go.</p>

<p class="indent1">[He bows and turns to depart. As he is going,
the ambassadors enter: MACCHIAVELLI, CAPELLO, SINIBALDI (<i>who is
livid with chagrin</i>), MARIANO and GASPARO.</p>

<p>CORELLA: Sirs, to command. His highness bade me announce you the
moment you arrived. He will, I know, be honoured by your
congratulations. If you will give me leave, I will let him know at
once.</p>

<p class="indent1">[CORELLA goes out L., followed by the PAGE
bearing his arms.</p>

<p>CAPELLO (<i>falsely genial</i>): There is good cause for our
congratulations. These people of Solignola take their defeat in
excellent part.</p>

<p>SINIBALDI (<i>sourly</i>): As the mountains take rain. Because
they cannot help themselves.</p>

<p>MACCHIAVELLI: A happy image, Lord Prince.</p>

<p>SINIBALDI (<i>mistrustful</i>): Eh?</p>

<p>MACCHIAVELLI: Is not the rain beneficent to the mountains? Does
it not bring fertility to their slopes?</p>

<p>SINIBALDI: Maybe. But that is not what I had in mind.</p>

<p>CAPELLO (<i>hastening to explain</i>): It is the passive
acquiescence in their subjection that amazes the prince.</p>

<p>MACCHIAVELLI: But why should it? The folk of Solignola know that
their conquest by the duke is for their ultimate good; they know
his way, and that they need apprehend no danger to life or
property.</p>

<p>SINIBALDI: What of the life and property of Count Guido, Messer
Niccolo? Will you answer for those?</p>

<p>MACCHIAVELLI: As to the property, it was never really his own.
Count Guido was but a Vicar of the Holy See, a feudatory of
Rome.</p>

<p>SINIBALDI: You take that view, do you?</p>

<p>MACCHIAVELLI: Does not your lordship?</p>

<p>CAPELLO (<i>interrupting hurriedly</i>): But of course, of
course!</p>

<p>SINIBALDI: And his life then? What of that?</p>

<p>MACCHIAVELLI: A delicate matter. When a prince conquers such a
State as this, he will, if he is a wise prince, do one of two
things: either he will constrain the members of the vanquished
family to become his friends, or else...</p>

<p>SINIBALDI Or else?</p>

<p>MACCHIAVELLI: Or else put it beyond their power to be his
enemies.</p>

<p>SINIBALDI: That, no doubt, is the policy his highness will
prefer.</p>

<p>MACCHIAVELLI: Dare you blame him?</p>

<p>SINIBALDI: Sir, I am not so steeped in statecraft that I can
find no pity for Count Guido.</p>

<p>MACCHIAVELLI: Pity! That is an emotion. It has no place in
policy.</p>

<p>SINIBALDI: It certainly has none in Valentino's.</p>

<p>MACCHIAVELLI: That is why he is a model prince.</p>

<p class="indent1">[CORELLA re-enters, and announces.</p>

<p>CORELLA Sirs, his highness!</p>

<p class="indent1">[VALENTINOIS and GUIDO come in by the door down
R., following CORELLA. VALENTINOIS is booted to the thighs and
wears a short hacketon, below which gleams the escalloped edge of a
coat of mail. Over this he wears the gonfalonier's mantle as in Act
II. Scene I. He is covered by a steel cap, and wears gloves, one of
which he is drawing on as he enters. COUNT GUIDO, too, is in
leather, and a steel gorget still remains upon him of his armour.
His head is bandaged, and he carries his left arm in a sling. He is
pale and dejected.</p>

<p class="indent1">[The ORATORS all bow as VALENTINOIS
advances.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: Sirs, it honours me that you should seek me here so
soon. Twice gives who quickly gives.</p>

<p>CAPELLO: Knowing that at dawn you set out for Rome, this was our
only opportunity to present our felicitations.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: I make them very welcome, and you, sirs. But my
time is short. I am awaited at the Cathedral by the Ancients of the
City who are to swear fealty upon my hands. If you will give me
your support and company at the ceremony I shall be honoured.</p>

<p>ORATORS (<i>They all bow, mumbling platitudes</i>): Highness,
the honour will be ours. It is we shall be honoured! We Could not
miss the occasion.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: On our return perhaps I may have your company at
supper&mdash;simple and informal, because I must retire early
against to-morrow's journey. Count Guido, here, will be our
host.</p>

<p class="indent1">[There is a movement of surprise.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: For I rejoice to tell you that Count Guido is to
continue here in Solignola as Rome's Vicar and my Vicegerent,
subject to certain conditions which have been happily agreed. Count
Guido is not required to take the oath in public. He shall be
privately sworn before I depart. And now, sirs, if it be your
pleasure, we will proceed to the Cathedral.</p>

<p class="indent1">[They fall back. CORELLA goes ahead to the door
at back. Beyond it the SWISS come to attention. VALENTINOIS bows to
COUNT GUIDO, and goes up and out, the others following. As he
appears at the head of the stairs there is a flourish of trumpets
and a burst of cheering from the courtyard below. This is followed
by martial music as he descends out of view, which continues some
little time, but dwindling in the distance until it fades away
entirely.</p>

<p class="indent1">[The doors are closed by the SWISS, and COUNT
GUIDO is left alone. He makes a mute gesture of despair, then
crosses with dragging feet towards the chair by the hearth, into
which he lets himself fall. He pulls a letter from his pocket,
straining his eyes to read it (yet again, having read it
previously). As he reads he groans.</p>

<p class="indent1">[The door at back is softly opened. The SWISS,
having followed VALENTINOIS, are no longer on guard there.</p>

<p class="indent1">[SINIBALDI enters furtively.</p>

<p class="indent1">[Hearing his step, COUNT GUIDO crushes the
letter in his hand, and turns in alarm.</p>

<p>GUIDO: Sinibaldi!</p>

<p>SINIBALDI (<i>in the act of closing the door</i>): I gave them
the slip in the courtyard. Let them go to their fawning on this
bastard. You had my message?</p>

<p>GUIDO: Your message? Yes. I have it here. God's curse on
you!</p>

<p>SINIBALDI (<i>aghast</i>): On me! Why...</p>

<p>GUIDO: Was it not you that set her on to this? Was it not you
who sent her to this ruin that has dragged our own at its
heels.</p>

<p>SINIBALDI: My friend, I heed your poor bruised heart, rather
than your words. Was It my fault that your daughter failed us in
this fashion? Could I foresee that this devil would beguile her so?
And to say I sent her! It was she, herself, afire with vengeance,
who insisted. Your grief makes you unjust, Lord Count.</p>

<p>GUIDO: I am accursed, I think! Why&mdash;as there is God of
Pity&mdash;did not the pike that broke my arm this morning tear out
my heart instead? Why did not the sword that shore my brow bite
deep into this old brain? Was I spared that I may go mad? For what
was I spared?</p>

<p>SINIBALDI: My friend! My poor friend!</p>

<p>GUIDO: Poor! that is the word. A thing of pity. Count Guido
degli Speranzoni, once a proud eagle on these craggy heights; now a
poor battered fowl, so tame and broken, that I am to feed from the
hand of this ravisher of my power and of my honour!</p>

<p>SINIBALDI: Sh! Have a care!</p>

<p>GUIDO (<i>on a musing, bitter tone, tapping the letter</i>):
Three hours you say he stayed alone with her last night, whilst his
men made fast all those she had posted in the garden. Three
hours!</p>

<p>SINIBALDI: And it's my belief that but for her weakness she
could have taken him the night before. I have it from herself that
he was there alone&mdash;alone and in secret.</p>

<p>GUIDO: Hell! It seems impossible. I'd not believe it but for her
lying letters, her failure and her absence now. Her lover Pietro
but three months dead! Her soul, a flame of vengeance! And
then...this. That is woman. Woman! Again I ask you, why have I been
spared?</p>

<p>SINIBALDI: For vengeance, surely. GUIDO: Eh? Are you mad?</p>

<p>SINIBALDI: This bolt has missed. But I've another in my armoury.
We'll end where we should have begun. I was a fool ever to have
yielded to this crazy plan of taking him alive.</p>

<p>GUIDO: Do you reproach me with that?</p>

<p>SINIBALDI: If I had insisted on the direct and simple way, we
should have had him stiff by now. There was ample opportunity in
Assisi, and I must have seiZed it, but that I trusted to your
crack-brained scheme.</p>

<p>GUIDO: God's light, man! Do you think I have no memory? When you
came here seeking catspaws to do the work of Venice, you gave a
dozen reasons why the hand of the Serene Republic should not be
seen. And now we have your big talk of what you would have done but
that we thwarted you!</p>

<p>SINIBALDI: In what I would have done the hand of Venice would
never have appeared. It will not now in what is yet to do.</p>

<p>GUIDO: Be plain, man.</p>

<p>SINIBALDI: You'll take a little risk to make him cold, to avenge
your ruin and your daughter's shame?</p>

<p>GUIDO: A little risk? There's no risk too big to daunt me. I am
to swear fealty to him upon the Scriptures and upon his hands, so
that I may purchase a few more years of this dishonoured life. If I
can avert that...</p>

<p>SINIBALDI: Listen!</p>

<p class="indent1">[He looks cautiously round, and draws a little
silver phial from his pocket.</p>

<p>SINIBALDI: He delivers himself into our hands. This supper to
which we are bidden...Look! One single drop of this, rubbed round
the cup from which he is to drink...One drop...So little that it
will not show. Let him drink but half the cupful, and in less time
than it will take to tell a dozen paternosters he will be
journeying over Styx.</p>

<p class="indent1">[They look at each other in silence.</p>

<p>SINIBALDI: It leaves no signs, and none will know of what he
died.</p>

<p>GUIDO (<i>with sarcasm</i>): Save that he died here in my
house&mdash;at my table!</p>

<p>SINIBALDI: Do you not wish him dead? Have you not cause enough
to kill him? Your daughter...</p>

<p>GUIDO: O cease! Let the thing be done. What do I care so that he
perishes? What do I care that I do the work of Venice, so that I do
my own?</p>

<p>SINIBALDI: That's it, that's it! Each of us achieves his
ends.</p>

<p>GUIDO: But only one will pay. What matter? I am past caring.
There's his cup the cup of honour&mdash;already set. Do it, and be
damned!</p>

<p class="indent1">[SINIBALDI steps eagerly to the table, takes up
the cup, and from the phial measures into it one drop. SINIBALDI: A
lovely cup for such a draught!</p>

<p class="indent1">[He twirls the cup to spread the drop of liquid.
He is still doing so when the door at back opens and,</p>

<p class="indent1">[PANTHASILEA comes in. She is wrapped in a
black, hooded cloak, her face pale and set.</p>

<p class="indent1">[SINIBALDI wheels in alarm at the sound of the
opening door, still holding the cup a second before he hastily puts
it down.</p>

<p>SINIBALDI: Madonna!</p>

<p class="indent1">[GUIDO turns, sees her, and utters an audible
gasp of mingled anger and amazement.</p>

<p class="indent1">[She comes forward, loosens and removes her
cloak, under which she is darkly clad. She flings the cloak on a
chair by the door. She looks at her father in mute, appealing
expectancy.</p>

<p>GUIDO (<i>starting up</i>): So, you have returned at last, you
drab!</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA (<i>piteously</i>): Father!</p>

<p>GUIDO (<i>with a gesture of loathing</i>): Never...never call me
by that name again. I would a blight had withered me or ever I
begat a harlot. O God! the shame of it!</p>

<p class="indent1">[PANTHASILEA stands rigid, frozen.</p>

<p>SINIBALDI: Patience, sir! At least hear what Monna Lea has to
say. Perhaps she can explain...</p>

<p>GUIDO: Explain what? Her presence here? (<i>To Panthasilea.</i>)
Why have you come back? To see for yourself the ruin you have
wrought? To see your broken father dragged at the bloody wheel of
this conqueror's chariot? Or is it so that I may kill you, and thus
wipe out your disgrace and mine?</p>

<p class="indent1">[With his hand on his dagger, he turns as if to
rush upon her. SINIBALDI restrains him.</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: Nay, Lord Prince! Let be! (<i>To Guido.</i>)</p>

<p>Kill me if you will. Kill me and be welcome. But do it cleanly
with your dagger or your hands, not foully with your tongue.</p>

<p>GUIDO: Why, so I will. But first, madonna, render your accounts.
What did you go to do in Assisi, and what was it that you did?</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: What I went to do, you know; and why I went to do
it.</p>

<p>GUIDO: Ay; but will you tell us what you did?</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: I went to save Solignola. My love for Solignola and
you was one spur to drive me. The other was my hate of the murderer
of Pietro Varano.</p>

<p>GUIDO: Yes, yes. This we know. Come to the business.</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: My hate was fed on lies&mdash;on lies. I believed
Pietro to be good and noble; I learnt that he was base and vile, a
murderer, an adulterer&mdash;the man I was to have married, the man
my virgin heart had sanctified.</p>

<p>GUIDO: So! They told you of the business of the Uberti!</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: You knew! You&mdash;my father&mdash;and you let me
go immolate myself to avenge&mdash;that!</p>

<p>GUIDO: Is there more of this?</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: A little more. There is the other lie, the lie
touching this man I was to betray into your hands. He was depicted
to me as a monster in body and in soul.</p>

<p>GUIDO: In soul! He has no soul. He is antichrist.</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: So you taught me, and so I believed, so I thought
last night that I had proof&mdash;until I came to see that what I
deemed his vileness was but the mirror of my own. I went to do a
Judas work. I was detected...</p>

<p>GUIDO: Detected? You mean that you betrayed us.</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: Betrayed you! There was not the need. He knew; from
the first he knew. He was never in my power. I was ever in his.</p>

<p>SINIBALDI: But, madonna, two nights ago, when he came, as you
told me, you might have taken him then.</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: You think so?</p>

<p>SINIBALDI: I have your word for it, that you had not posted your
men.</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: But if I had posted them, that would have happened
then which happened last night instead.</p>

<p>GUIDO: Had he not beguiled you, the blow would have been struck
a week ago, and if it missed, we could have taken other
measures.</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA (<i>scornfully</i>): Against him? It is your vanity
that blinds you, that has blinded you throughout, as it blinded
those treacherous dolts at Sinigaglia, as it blinded me&mdash;poor
fool!&mdash;when I went to proffer him my Judas-kiss, and stayed
instead to receive the Judas-kiss from him.</p>

<p class="indent1">[With a growl of rage, GUIDO would fling himself
upon her. But again SINIBALDI restrains him.</p>

<p>SINIBALDI (<i>suddenly inspired</i>): You see how it is! She is
possessed! That warlock has practised the black arts upon the
girl.</p>

<p>GUIDO (<i>stricken by the explanation</i>): Saints of Heaven!
Can you believe...</p>

<p>SINIBALDI: Can you behold her, can you hear her, and still doubt
that she is bewitched?</p>

<p>GUIDO: Bewitched! (<i>Draws his dagger.</i>) Let me go, by
Heaven! that I may exorcise her.</p>

<p>SINIBALDI: Nay, nay, man! A deed of violence now, and you ruin
all.</p>

<p class="indent1">[GUIDO pauses, and curbs himself,
recollecting.</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: Do not restrain him, sir. And do not deceive
yourselves. He practised on me no witchery but that of his beauty,
his cunning and his power.</p>

<p>GUIDO: You shameless drab!</p>

<p>SINIBALDI: How should she understand&mdash;poor victim of his
spells?</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: That, yes&mdash;that and more. Say also: the
wretched dupe of his loathing and his scorn, which he disguised
under a glittering mask of love. 0 God! Is there in all the world
such another thing of shame? Why don't you kill me, and have
done?</p>

<p>GUIDO: Ay!</p>

<p>SINIBALDI (<i>again restraining</i>): We will do better,
madonna. We will avenge you.</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: Avenge me! You! (<i>Laughs.</i>) How will you
avenge me?</p>

<p>SINIBALDI: I will end now where I should have begun&mdash;do
that which as lately as last night I was urging you to do.</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: You will kill him&mdash;you!</p>

<p>SINIBALDI: I will bring about his end.</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: And how will you accomplish it? He is invulnerable.
Weapons forged to slay him, turn against those that handle
them.</p>

<p>SINIBALDI: Not this one. Impalpable, invisible, it lies in wait
for him already.</p>

<p>GUIDO: Ay.</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA You deceive yourselves to your undoing. He is
empanoplied in caution, armed in cunning against all your
wiles.</p>

<p>GUIDO: His cunning cannot turn steel or supply the antidote to
poison.</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: He wears mail under his silk as a protection
against steel, and never touches meat or wine without a
venom-taster.</p>

<p>GUIDO: What's that?</p>

<p class="indent1">[He looks sharply at SINIBALDI, who has also
made a movement of dismay. PANTHASILEA observes one and the
other.</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: Last night, myself, I was appointed to that office.
He constrained me to it before he would drink a cup of wine I
offered him. He takes no chances.</p>

<p>GUIDO (<i>bewildered</i>): You! He made you his venom-taster, do
you say?</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: Yes.</p>

<p class="indent1">[GUIDO considers her a moment with dilating
eyes. Then deliberately he sheathes his dagger.</p>

<p>GUIDO: Now I understand why God has willed that you should come
back, despite your load of shame.</p>

<p>SINIBALDI: Eh?</p>

<p>GUIDO: It is so that you may be his venom-taster once again,
to-night.</p>

<p class="indent1">[SINIBALDI audibly sucks in his breath. He would
intervene, but controls himself.</p>

<p class="indent1">[There is a tense pause. PANTHASILEA, looking at
her father, at SINIBALDI and finally at the cup with which she has
seen him tampering, realizes all. There is from her a flash of
inspiration, almost instantly veiled. She smiles a little at last,
but with more mockery than mirth.</p>

<p class="indent1">[Martial music is heard faintly in the distance
and rapidly approaching.</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: I understand, I think. So be it. It is
very...just.</p>

<p class="indent1">[SINIBALDI, who has been showing constraint,
breathes freely again.</p>

<p>SINIBALDI: And very timely. They are returning.</p>

<p class="indent1">[GUIDO sinks limply into a chair, his head in
his hands. PANTHASILEA turns slowly, and goes up and out into the
half-gloom of the loggia, where she remains standing, looking
out.</p>

shoulder.</p>

<p>SINIBALDI: Come, brace yourself, Lord Count. You have a part to
play.</p>

<p>GUIDo: A part! Lord of Heaven! What part is mine?</p>

<p>SINIBALDI: A Roman part.</p>

<p>GUIDO (<i>bitterly</i>): Written by a Venetian. Pah!</p>

<p class="indent1">[The main doors are thrown open. MACCHIAVELLI,
CAPELLO, GASPARO and MARIANO come in. The music swells up, now
close at hand.</p>

<p class="indent1">[Two LACKEYS enter from above door right, with
tapers, and light the lanterns to dispel the gathering dusk.</p>

himself.</p>

<p>GUIDO: Sirs, you are well returned.</p>

<p>CAPELLO: You missed a very impressive ceremony. But it was kind
of you, Lord Prince, to bear Count Guido company. Courage, Lord
Count. After all, you retain your vicarship.</p>

<p>GUIDO (<i>impatiently</i>): Where is his highness? MACCHIAVELLI:
He follows. CAPELLO: Here he comes.</p>

<p class="indent1">[FOUR Swiss enter and take up their stations
inside the door. Then comes VALENTINOIS, preceded immediately in
single file by CORELLA, RAMIREZ and FERRANTE, and followed by two
pages. VALENTINOIS takes off his steel cap and then the velvet
skull-cap under it. These he hands to one of the pages, who sets
them down. Then VALENTINOIS comes forward, ungloving, raking the
room with his glance, which finally settles on SINIBALDI.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: Ah, Lord Prince! We missed your company in the
Cathedral.</p>

<p class="indent1">[At the sound of his voice, PANTHASILEA wheels
about, a hand clutching her agitated bosom.</p>

<p>SINIBALDI: I was none so well, highness, and Venice was well
represented by Messer Capello.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: (<i>nodding</i>): Who will report to the Serene
Republic this happy conclusion of our campaign.</p>

<p>SINIBALDI: The Serene Republic will rejoice in this. VALENTINOIS
(<i>dryly</i>): I know.</p>

<p>SINIBALDI: And she will commend your generous wisdom in the
matter of Count Guido.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: TO merit the approval of the Most Serene is more
than a reward. It leaves me in her debt&mdash;and in yours, Lord
Prince. I shall study to repay. I always pay my debts. But Come,
sirs. To table! I have a long journey before me for to-morrow, and
so I must early to bed.</p>

<p class="indent1">[He turns, and so confronts PANTHASILEA, who is
standing in the loggia. He starts at sight of her. Recovering, he
speaks calmly, in greeting, bowing low.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: Monna Panthasilea! My homage. I had not dared to
hope that you would grace our company to-night.</p>

<p class="indent1">[He extends his hand. She hesitates a moment,
then comes forward, and kisses it, curtsying.</p>

highness has appointed me.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: Office?</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: Venom-taster to your potency.</p>

<p class="indent1">[VALENTINOIS' eyes quicken suddenly. They flash
upon COUNT GUIDO and from him to SINIBALDI, both of whom betray
constraint. Then he looks steadily at PANTHASILEA.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: That is to take a jest too seriously.</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: No office in the service of your potency can be
taken as a jest.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: Certainly not that one. It is no sinecure to be
venom-taster to Cesare Borgia. It has its risks, madonna.</p>

<p>GUIDO: Not here, my lord.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: Could I suggest it? I could no more suspect your
lordship than I could suspect...say, Prince Sinibaldi, who
represents a State that loves and honours me, or this sombre
Macchiavelli, who strictly confines himself to poisoning minds.</p>

<p>MACCHIAVELLI: I thank your highness for the compliment.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: There was none intended. But be seated, pray. You,
here beside me, Ser Niccolo; then Ramirez; you, Lord Prince, there,
and Micheletto yonder. Messeri Capello, Gasparo and Mariano here on

bustle of preparation, and a general hum of talk. Then VALENTINOIS
leans forward to address SINIBALDI, and all fall silent.</p>

<p>SINIBALDI: Your highness honours me by your attention. I have
said that I am none so well.</p>

How else could I give proof? Would anything less have made you
believe in me? Would anything less have conquered you?</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: It is a conquest that must break me if you leave me
now. (<i>He takes her up in his arms. He holds her now, crushing
her to him.</i>) Stay with me, Lea&mdash;O pitying
Heaven!&mdash;stay!</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: Thus did I plead with you last night, as
passionately and as vainly. Thus did I beg you to stay. You would
not then, and now I...I cannot.</p>

<p class="indent1">[He kisses her. She smiles.</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: But this time...we part...friends...lovers...(On a
sudden alarmed outcry.) Valentinois!</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: Lea!</p>

<p>PANTHASILEA: It is growing dark...It...</p>

<p class="indent1">[A long fluttering sigh escapes her. She makes a
convulsive movement. Her head falls back. She is dead.</p>

lowers her into the chair again.</p>

<p class="indent1">[He kneels beside her. He speaks in a suffocated
voice.</p>

<p>VALENTINOIS: Ay, you have conquered now!</p>

<p class="indent1">[A sob bursts from him. His head sinks on to the
arm he is resting on the table's edge.</p>

<p class="indent1">[A trumpet is heard in the distance, and faintly
thereafter the sound of march music.</p>
