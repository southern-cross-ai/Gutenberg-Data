<p>Production Notes:</p>
<p>"Wakefield's identity as the author of the new theory of
colonization was well hidden for a year or two from the public
and even from the Colonial Office. In 1831, Robert Gouger, who
was then, and later, Wakefield's mouthpiece, revealed the secret
to the Colonial Office in a letter which is worth rescuing from
oblivion. Gouger wrote to T. F. Elliot of the Colonial Office:
"You are aware I have always declined giving the name of my
friend the author of the plan of colonization to which I have
been so much attached, and which I have endeavoured to work upon
the attention of the Government rather assiduously. I am now at
liberty to reveal his name and do it to you with great pleasure,
as you may perhaps be glad to make use of his very extensive
knowledge of colonization generally. It is Mr. Edward G.
Wakefield, the author of a book just published on the Punishment
of Death, and whose name you must remember to have heard of in
connection with the abduction of Miss Turner some years since. I
am very glad to be able to make this communication, as it does
away with any unpleasant feeling of 'false position' I may have
entertained relative to my own connection with this subject. The
cause of retaining the author's name will now readily suggest
itself to you." Gouger to Elliot, July 29th, 1831. CO. 384/28."

<h3>PREFACE.</h3>
<hr class="2">
<p>"<span class="a">Another</span> evil, aggravated, though
certainly not engendered, by the miserable administration of our
poor-laws, is our present redundancy of population. He must have
been inattentive to what is visible in almost every town and
hamlet throughout the kingdom, who does not perceive that
population has, for at least fifteen or twenty years, been
increasing at a rate for which no improvement in agriculture or
manufactures could afford employment. For many years it failed to
attract the attention it deserved, but is now brought practically
home to all orders of society. By what means this severe, and
apparently sudden calamity, is come upon us, is well worthy of
inquiry. The same excess of numbers which caused the hardy tribes
of the north, in former times, to pour their swarms over the
south, is again experienced in every part of Europe, but presses
most heavily of all on England. Instead of parents delighting in
the spread of their families, and rejoicing in the display of
their endowments of mind and body as they grow up, they no sooner
open their eyes on the world, than in comes solicitude about the
means of rearing them; and when they approach maturity, a degree
of anxiety, unknown and unnecessary in former times, is
frequently experienced, as to procuring for them situations
wherein, by skill and diligence, they may earn an honourable
support. <i>All trades, pursuits, and professions are becoming
more and more overstocked; and multitudes of persons, of all
degrees and ages, are moving about, without employment, useless
to themselves, and a burden to the public</i>. It is possible
that this excessive increase of population (which forms the
subject of several able treatises lately published in France, and
of a most elaborate work which we have just received from
Germany) may at last correct itself; but it will not do so for a
considerable time, nor until great privations have been suffered;
and ours are likely to be the most serious and prolonged, as this
is the country where the multiplication of the people has been
going on with by far the greatest rapidity. In this strait, the
quantity of land suffered to lie uncultivated and waste, in this
island and in Ireland, appears to us most extraordinary; and, not
less so, the small degree of public attention attracted to our
colonies, which exceed in number and value those which any state
in the world ever before possessed. Hitherto, we have derived
from them little assistance, because the poor are sure of being
maintained by their parishes at home, and the rich have been
brought up too indulgently to sit down willingly as settlers in a
new country. Necessity, however, will overcome all repugnance.
<i>No pains should be spared to teach the labouring classes to
regard the colonies as the land of promise, which it should be
their highest ambition to be able to reach. Nor does this matter
concern the poorer orders among us alone: in the colonies, a
large proportion of the children or grandchildren of the highest
families in this land must be contented to fix their abode,
unless they resolve to drag on a life of dependence and indigence
here. It is unfortunate that these establishments should so long
have been regarded as fit only for the residence of convicts,
labourers, mechanics, and desperate or needy men</i>.
<span class="a">The Greek colonies contained a mixture of all
classes of society</span>. Regularity and subordination were thus
encouraged and preserved in all stages of their progress, and
they rose to wealth and eminence much earlier than they would
otherwise have done. We ought still to follow their example,
though it is vain to expect that all the colonies we have will
prove so effectual a drain as we now require. <i>Hitherto, at
least, our population has been increasing at the rate of between
3 and 400,000 annually, while those removed to our colonies,
including convicts and emigrants, have not exceeded the rate of 7
or 8,000 at the utmost</i>. We may, however, expect the ratio of
emigration to rise considerably above this, and we ought to use
all our efforts with that view. <i>If adequate encouragement be
held out to enterprising young men of rank and connections; if
young men and women, in the intermediate ranks of life, are
accustomed to look to the colonies as the most certain means of
obtaining a comfortable settlement; and if the poor could be
persuaded that it would be better for them to purchase a passage,
by binding themselves to serve as bondsmen a few years after
their arrival in the colonies, than to wear out an abject and
hopeless life at home</i>, the country might be materially
relieved of the useless population by which it is likely soon to
be encumbered. The policy of emigration, we once more say, ought,
in these days, to go hand in hand with that of agricultural
improvement at home."</p>

<h3>A LETTER FROM SYDNEY</h3>
<hr class="2">
<p><span class="a">As</span> the Australasian settlements are
known indifferently by several names, I must introduce the
following account of their condition and prospects, by requesting
you to understand that, by Australia, I mean the large island of
which one half is called New Holland, and the other New South
Wales; and that, by Australasia, I mean Australia and all the
smaller islands in its neighbourhood, including Van Diemen's
Land.</p>
<p>In the first place, I have to give you, in general terms, my
opinion of Eastern Australia, and of the prospects which this
penal settlement offers to emigrants of a class above "convicts,
labourers, mechanics, and desperate or needy men."</p>
<p>All that you read in the works of Wentworth and Cunningham, as
to the healthfulness and beauty of the climate, is strictly true.
There are scarcely any diseases but what result immediately from
intemperance. Dropsy, palsy, and the whole train of nervous
complaints, are common enough; but then, drunkenness is the vice
<i>par excellence</i> of the lower orders; and the better class
of settlers have not learned those habits of temperance which are
suited to the climate of Naples. The two classes often remind me
of English Squires and their grooms, as I used to see them at
Florence, just after the peace; the masters drinking at dinner,
because they were abroad, and after dinner because they were
Englishmen; the servants drinking always, because wine and brandy
were cheap. Perhaps a generation must pass away before the people
here will accommodate their habits to the climate, which is that
of Italy, without either malaria or the sirocco. I shall have
more to say on this head presently.</p>
<p>The soil of New South Wales is not particularly fertile. The
plains of the Ganges, and of the great rivers of China, the
lowlands of the West India islands, the swamps of the Gulf of
Mexico, and even the marshes of Essex, produce crops of which the
people here have no conception; but then, as we are without great
masses of alluvial deposit, so are agues and intermittent fevers
absolutely unknown. In point of natural fertility, I am inclined
to compare this soil to that of France; and I have no doubt that,
if the same quantity of agricultural labour as is employed in
France, were here bestowed upon an area equal to the French
territory, the quantity of produce would fully equal that of
France. But hundreds of years must elapse before land, here, will
be cultivated as well as in the most barbarous countries of
Europe. Having regard, however, only to the natural powers of the
soil, this account will probably satisfy you. Timber, coal, iron,
and other useful minerals, abound; the harbours and rivers teem
with fish; cattle of all sorts thrive and multiply with
astonishing rapidity; every fruit that flourishes in Spain and
Italy comes to the highest perfection; and Nature fully performs
her part in bestowing upon man the necessaries, comforts, and
luxuries of life.</p>
<p>In the above sketch, I have described my own impressions of
the country before I reached it. They remain unaltered by some
years of close observation; and I can soberly declare that I
believe this country to possess merits of a physical nature
superior to those of most other spots on the globe.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 4}</u></p>
<a name="ch-03" id="ch-03"></a>
<div class="insertl">Value of Land, Timber,<br>
and Minerals.</div>
<div>I cannot say that in other respects, not physical, I had
been misled. I drew my information from books, and the verbal
reports of sincere men who had passed many years in the colony.
If you wish to form opinions of your own from facts only, study
the unpretending but very useful little books of Mr. Curr, Mr.
Widdowson, and Mr. Atkinson. Beware, however, of taking for
granted their statements of cause and effect. But perhaps you
have resolved to come here at all events; in which case you had
better examine only the more gaudy pictures of these settlements;
and, pursuing the usual course of self-delusion, enjoy, during
your passage at least, the comforts of anticipation. The facts on
which my opinions were formed have turned out to be true; but my
conclusions were miserably erroneous. For example, I was told
that an estate of 10,000 acres might be obtained for a mere
trifle. This was true. I have got 20,000 acres, and they did not
cost me more than 2<i>s</i>. per acre. But I imagined that a
domain of that extent would be very valuable. In this I was
wholly mistaken. As my estate cost me next to nothing, so it is
worth next to nothing. For reasons which I shall mention
presently, I tried to sell it; but I could not find a purchaser,
without submitting to lose great part of what I had expended in
improvements. Yet there are persons continually reaching the
colony on purpose to invest money in the purchase of land; but
when I have made overtures to them, they have grumbled at my
price, saying that they could obtain a grant from the Crown for
less than six-pence per acre; and when I have talked of my
"improvements," they have answered that they preferred improving,
themselves, to buying <i>my</i> improvements. In short, my domain
has no market value. It is a noble property to look at; and
"20,000 acres in a ring fence," sounds very well in England; but
here, such a property possesses no exchangeable value. The reason
is plain: there are millions upon millions of acres, as fertile
as mine, to be had for nothing; and, what is more, there are not
people to take them. Of my 20,000 acres I reckon about 5000 to be
woodland, though, indeed, there are trees scattered over the
whole property, as in an English park. For my amusement, I had a
rough estimate made of the money that I could obtain for all this
timber, were it growing in any part of England. The valuation
amounts to above £150,000. Now for my pecuniary advantage, the
best thing that could happen to me would be the annihilation of
all this natural produce; provided, I mean, that it could be
destroyed without cost. The cost of destroying it, out of hand,
would be at least £15,000. Thus, in point of fact, my timber
injures my estate to that amount, instead of being worth ten
times that sum. It seems droll, does it not, that an English
hundred-and-fifty-thousand-pounds-worth of any thing should, any
where, be a dead loss of fifteen thousand pounds? It is true,
however; as you may fully convince yourself by reading, in any of
the accounts of these settlements, a chapter upon "Grubbing."
Fortunately some other things that I possess, and which, if I had
them in England would make me a peer, are not, like the timber, a
positive injury. These are mines of coal and iron, in which my
estate is supposed to abound. Being under the surface, they can
do me no harm; and I shall take good care that they are not
disturbed. For if anyone, out of enmity to me, should bring an
army of miners from Staffordshire, and raise to the surface a
large quantity of my coal and iron ore, the cost of throwing it
down the shafts again would quite ruin me, if, indeed, I could,
at any cost, find labourers for the purpose. As for disposing of
it in any other way, that would be impossible, for want of roads.
Besides, neither the Crown nor individuals would let me injure
their land by casting my rubbish on to it. As regards the coal,
though, I am mistaken; I might consume it by fire without much
trouble. But what could I do with the iron ore, when, even though
there should be means to convey it to Sydney, nobody would give
me one Birmingham frying-pan for the whole of it? An estate of
20,000 acres, containing rich mines of coal and iron, and covered
with magnificent timber, is, no doubt, a very good thing in some
countries; but here you will lose money by such a possession; if,
that is, you have any money to lose, and unless you take
particular care of it.</div>
<p>I did not, you know, intend to become a farmer. Having fortune
enough for all my wants, I proposed to get a large domain, to
build a good house, to keep enough land in my own hands for
pleasure-grounds, park, and game preserves; and to let the rest,
after erecting farm-houses in the most suitable spots. My
mansion, park, preserves, and tenants, were all a mere dream. I
have not one of them. When, upon my first arrival, I talked of
these things to some sensible men, to whom I was recommended,
they laughed in my face. I soon found that a house would, though
the stone and timber were to be had for nothing, cost three times
as much as in England. This was on account of the very high wages
required by mechanics; but this was not all. None of the
materials of a house, except stone and timber, are produced in
the colony. Every pane of glass, every nail, every grain of
paint, and every piece of furniture, from the kitchen copper to
the drawing-room curtains, must have come from England. My
property is at a distance of nearly seventy miles from the sea,
and there is no road, but a track through the forest, for
two-thirds of that distance. Every thing, even the food of the
labourers, must have been transported from afar. Log-houses must
have been built for the labourers; and the cheapest way of
providing for them would have been by the establishment of a
farm, in the first instance, to produce enough for their
subsistence. Lastly, though none of these obstacles had existed,
the whole colony did not contain as many masons, carpenters,
glaziers, painters, black and whitesmiths, and other mechanics,
as I should have required. You may believe most statements of
fact respecting the colony; but beware how you draw
conclusions!</p>
<p>Of course, I soon abandoned all thought of building a mansion.
As for a park, my whole property was a park, and a preserve for
kangaroos and emus. The grand object was to dispark it as soon as
possible. I clung for some time to the hope of having tenants;
but you will readily see that what deterred me from building a
mansion presented numerous obstacles to the erection of
farm-houses. Besides, even though I had forced circumstances, and
had, at an enormous cost, placed a dozen good homesteads on my
land, where was I to find tenants? There is no such class as a
tenantry in this country, where every man, who has capital to
cultivate a farm, can obtain one of his own for nothing. I soon
found that what little my twenty thousand acres had cost me would
be entirely lost, unless I turned farmer myself, and endeavoured,
by my own exertions, with the assistance of convict servants, to
extract something from the soil. Believe statements of
fact&mdash;but beware how you draw conclusions!</p>

<div>I bore my disappointment as well as could be expected; and,
to use a colonial phrase, "took boldly to the bush." I dare say
you fancy that it was very agreeable, but I assure you that it
was not. The novelty of the thing pleased me at first; but I soon
tired of the clear Italian sky, the noble forests, and the
sublime solitude of the untrodden wilderness. People in a highly
civilized country, like England, are not aware of their own
wants. The wants exist, but most of them are supplied as soon as
they are formed. In England, when you want to eat, you eat, and
there is an end of the want; when you are sleepy, you go to bed;
when your clothes are wet, you change them; when you are tired of
talking, you take a book; and when you are tired of reading, you
begin to talk. But, in the desert, almost every want is severely
felt before it is supplied. Every thing, from the very beginning,
has either to be created or brought from a great distance. Try to
reckon the number of your physical wants, which are every day
supplied without any effort on your part, and you may form some
idea of the physical deprivations of a settler. As for mental
wants, talking and reading are out of the question, except it be
to scold your servants, and to con over a Sydney newspaper, which
contains little else but the miserable party politics of this
speck upon the globe, reports of crime and punishment, and
low-lived slang and flash, such as fill the pot-house Sunday
papers of London.</div>
<p>However, the settler's attention is pretty well diverted from
his wants, physical and mental, by the necessity of watching over
his property. I bought herds and flocks, horses, ploughs, carts,
carpenters' tools, and all sorts of implements of husbandry. My
only servants were convicts. My own man, who had served me for
eight years in England, and had often sworn that he would go the
wide world over with me, seeing that I was the best of masters,
never reached my new abode. He had saved about £150 in my
service; and I had advised him to take the money out of a London
Savings' Bank, under an idea that he might obtain ten per cent.
for it at Sydney. He followed my advice. About a month after our
arrival I missed him one morning. Before night I received a
letter, by which he informed me that he had taken a grant of land
near Hunter's River, and that he "hoped we parted friends." He is
now one of the most consequential persons in the Colony, has
grown enormously fat, feeds upon greasy dainties, drinks oceans
of bottled porter and port wine, damns the Governor, and swears
by all his gods, Jupiter, Jingo, and Old Harry, that this Colony
must soon be independent.</p>
<p>But to return to my convicts. One of them was a London
pickpocket, and a more mischievous animal I never had to contend
with. The others were country bumpkins, transported for poaching,
whom I had obtained with much trouble, supposing that they would
serve my turn much better than Londoners; but if they were better
able to work than the cockney, they were not a bit more willing.
Perhaps he corrupted them; but, be this as it may, they
altogether led me the life of a dog. My sheep and cows were
continually lost, and it was nobody's fault; my effects were
often stolen, though most of them could be of no use to the
thieves. I grumbled and threatened; but these men, all round,
declared their innocence, and called Heaven to witness that they
had not wronged me of a "dump." I stopped some of their extra
allowance until the goods should be produced. No more work was
done; one was ill&mdash;another had hurt his hand&mdash;a third
"would see me damned first"&mdash;and there was I, planted, as
the French say, at the distance of twelve miles from any sort of
assistance. It seemed necessary, however, to quell this
rebellion. I rode, therefore, to the magistrate, got a constable,
and sent the whole gang to prison; but the next day I was but too
glad to fetch them back; for harvest had just begun, and my maize
would have rotted on the ground, had I been long deprived of
their labour, such as it was. I might have had them flogged, or,
in colonial language, had "their backs scarified," whereby I
should have punished them without losing their labour. This is
the ordinary, because the most economical, mode of correcting our
slaves; but, thanks to Fortune, I was not compelled to adopt it,
being rich enough to indulge some foolish sentiments of
tenderness and respect for all my fellow-creatures, not to
mention tenderness and respect for myself. A necessary
consequence, however, of this my abstract humanity and selfish
pride, was, that I became the slave of my slaves. Can you imagine
a more hateful existence? Meanwhile, I had built a house&mdash;so
called here, but, properly speaking, a shed. It is well I have
abstained from marriage. What should I have done for a delicate
woman, bound to me by sacred ties? And if I had had children, and
those children had happened to be daughters? Why, I should have
done like others, who carry women and children out of civilized
society to inhabit the wilderness. I should have made my tender
wife a drudge, and my children little savages. Could 20,000 acres
of valueless desert have compensated for such misery?</p>
<p>Perhaps you think this a too highly coloured picture of my
mishaps?&mdash;but remember, I was not bred to labour&mdash;I
know nothing of farming&mdash;I have not been used to the cabin
of a brig-of-war, or the mess of a marching regiment. You, too,
have enjoyed the leisure which fortune bestows, and have inquired
the habits of refinement which belong to a numerous class in
England. Were you a broken farmer, or a poor lieutenant, I should
say, "Come here by all means. You cannot be placed more unhappily
than at present, and you may gain by the change." But I am
advising a man of independent fortune, who prefers his library,
even to the beauties of nature, and to whom intellectual society
is necessary for his peace of mind. Intellectual society! I shall
come to that presently.</p>
<p>Disgusted with my convict servants, I sent to England for
shepherds, ploughmen, carpenters, a blacksmith, a bricklayer, and
other useful labourers. The men arrived in high spirits, having
been hired from a part of the country where I was well known, and
having, most of them, worked for me in England. They knew that
they could depend on the high wages that my English agent had
promised them; their passage had been paid for by me; and the
sailors had told them that in New South Wales they would live
like fighting cocks. Being in the desert when I received notice
of their arrival, I hastened to Sydney, having first got rid of
my convicts, for fear that they should contaminate the
new-comers. The latter, who, my Sydney agent informed me, had,
when they were put ashore, spoken in raptures of the 'Squire,
received me with gloomy looks. They were already contaminated,
notwithstanding my precaution. One of them, a harness-maker from
Salisbury, acted as spokesman for the party, and told me flatly
that they had been imposed on. I stared, and asked in what
respect?&mdash;"They had not been told," he said, "what high
wages a man could get in New South Wales&mdash;they were told now
they could not live on the wages which had been promised them,
and they hoped I should take their case into my consideration." I
had not bound them by indentures, for I was weak enough to think
that free agents would prove better servants than bondsmen. I
desired them to "take into their consideration" the cost of their
passage; but in the long discussion that ensued, they carefully
avoided that point, and dwelt with dogged pertinacity on the
wages which honest men, like them, could obtain at or near
Sydney. I was completely in their power. By dint of flattery,
appeals to their honour, and promises of comfort, I induced the
mere peasants to observe their agreement and follow me to the
wilds; but the mechanics were impracticable. They had already
engaged with masters at Sydney and Parramatta, at double the high
wages that I had promised; and I could make no impression on
them. I retired to the woods with my clodhoppers, whom I found
very serviceable during a whole year; but at the end of that time
they began to grumble and fidget. Other persons had settled in my
neighbourhood. Some of these had been convicts, and afterwards
emancipated servants. They persuaded my men to become settlers
also. In less than two years each of my servants saved wherewith
to stock a small farm, and one by one they all left me. At last I
was glad to obtain a fresh supply of convicts. Under these
circumstances, my estate did not produce largely. My herds and
flocks, however, had rapidly multiplied: and in the last year of
which I speak, I reaped one hundred and forty acres of corn. This
was thought immense doings; but as my free labourers were gone, I
had no such prospect for the future; and as for the flocks, their
increase in number was not a proportionate increase of property
to me. The wool produced something; but the flesh was worth
nothing, unless taken to market, and then it would scarcely repay
the cost of the journey. Here, there are no drovers or jobbers in
cattle to come between the farmer and the butcher. In short,
there is little division of labour, and you may roll in plenty,
without possessing any thing of exchangeable value. You must do
almost every thing yourself; and flocks in the wilderness are not
worth much more than the wilderness itself, of which you may
obtain nearly any quantity for all but nothing. Under an idea
that cheese would be easily transported, and would fetch a good
price in Sydney, I thought at one time of establishing a dairy.
But I ought to have known better. My cows were as wild as hyænas,
and almost as wicked. I had no milkmaids, no dairy-women, no
churns, no any thing that was wanted for the purpose; and, above
all, I wanted industry, skill, economy, and taste, for any such
pursuits, or, at least, a drudge of a wife to supply those wants.
At length my impatience got the better of a certain stupid vanity
that had led me to fancy myself qualified to become a settler. I
wrote to my friends at Sydney acknowledging that I was sick of
the bush, and that their prophecies of my ill success had been
fulfilled to the letter. By their assistance I made over my
estate for twenty years, with every thing upon it, to a tough
Scotch farmer, on condition of receiving one-third of its
produce. This third produces me less than 3 per cent. interest on
what I have expended; but I am, comparatively speaking, a happy
man, living upon my English income, in a place where at least
books, and men and women, such as they are, are not quite
wanting, and where money will supply the more pressing wants of
civilized life.</p>
<p>Behold me established at Sydney, in a small house, a poor
vamped-up building, more inconvenient, and far more ugly, than
you can imagine, for which I pay a rent of £250 a year. For half
the money you could get twice as good a house in any English
country town. This excessive house rent is caused by the dearness
of labour, which enhances the cost of building; for, either the
builder will exact a rent proportioned to his outlay, or (if he
cannot obtain such a rent) he will not build.</p>
<p>I now associated with the inhabitants of Sydney, hoping, as I
had become an idle man, to be of some service to the colony, by
directing my attention to public objects. To one I talked of
introducing the cultivation of silk; to another, of tobacco; to a
third, of sugar; to a fourth, of wine;&mdash;and I proposed to
form societies for these several objects. But all my proposals
were received with coldness. Those to whom I addressed myself
knew, though they could not well say why, that my schemes were
exceedingly foolish. Seeing them apparently so deaf to the calls
of self-interest, I endeavoured to find some good reason for
their conduct; and my trouble in this respect was not thrown
away. I puzzled myself for a long while with questions of soil,
and climate, and markets, and duties, and bounties. At length the
true light broke upon me. The <i>scarcity of labourers</i> was an
insuperable bar to any mode of cultivation that requires the
employment of many hands! I profess to be but little versed in
the laws of political economy; but the fact was self-evident. I
could not, though I had been ever so reckless, have embarked my
fortune in one of the above-named speculations. Had I done so, I
should have been ruined, by the dearness of labour. But I could
not do so:&mdash;there were not labourers enough for the purpose,
at any rate of wages.</p>

<a name="ch-05" id="ch-05"></a>
<div class="insertl">Plans of Immigration.</div>
<div>I then turned my mind to plans of immigration, with a view,
at once, to increase the number of working hands and diminish the
wages of labour. Many projects suggested themselves to my mind,
and were discussed by some of the most intelligent colonists.
But, one by one, we abandoned all as utterly worthless. This will
surprise you; but attend to me for a moment. Suppose that we had,
by some means or other, brought twenty thousand industrious and
skilful Chinese into the colony. For how long would they have
remained labourers for hire? Just until they had saved money
wherewith to obtain grants of land, when they would have become
employers of labour, supposing any to be had. A sudden revolution
in their condition would have increased the demand for labour,
just in the same proportion that it would have diminished the
supply. The servants would have become masters, wanting servants.
Nothing is more clear.</div>
<p>Suppose, again, that we had sent to England for five thousand
starving peasants, and had bound them to labour for seven years,
at a rate of wages which, in England, they would have considered
extremely liberal. But this mode of supplying an urgent demand
for labour, has been tried over and over again in new countries.
Can you tell me of a single case in which it has effected its
object? I could tell you of hundreds in which it has failed.
Indeed, from the very nature of things, it must fail. An indented
emigrant, named John, reaches the land of promise in high
spirits, and labours contentedly, for three shillings a day, till
he meets a free labourer named Tom. Tom informs John that he,
Tom, gets six shillings a day, and he calls Tom a "sneak" for
taking only three. Tom, mind, has a personal interest in
corrupting John; because, if indented labourers could be held to
their bonds, they would reduce the wages of free labourers. John,
however, who is as honest as a poor man can be, and is very
grateful for his removal from abject misery in England, resists
Tom's first attack, and resolves to work out his agreement,
though he should be called a thousand sneaks. But the next time
they meet, Tom calls him a "poor dunghill devil." Even this does
not move his resolution; but as he is now well fed and full of
blood, it makes his heart thump against his ribs. At last Tom
calls him a "negur slave," and from that moment he determines to
be free as soon as possible. Yet this is a favourable case; as,
generally speaking, the indented immigrant declares he has been
cheated, and resolves to cheat his master, within twenty-four
hours of his landing. John now begins to grumble and neglect his
work. He and his master soon come to high words, which are not
worth repeating. The master, let us suppose, sends him to jail
upon the bond; but Tom visits and comforts him. He perseveres,
therefore; and his master loses his labour. Suppose that the
master could "scarify his back." Even then, though apparently
subdued, he might contrive to do less than three shillings worth
of labour per day, in which case the produce of his labour would
be a loss; and this without manifestly departing from the bond.
He might also&mdash;and this is no uncommon case&mdash;secretly
do more than three shillings worth of injury per day to his
master's property. Upon the whole, when once an indented labourer
becomes dissatisfied, the sooner his bond is cancelled the better
for the master. But what the master loses by the cost of the
labourer's passage from England is not the whole loss. The once
indented labourer obtains six shillings a day; saves half his
earnings; obtains a grant of land; and becomes an employer of
labour, and a competitor with his late master in the market of
industry. This, of course, raises the price of labour to all. So
that a large importation of indented labourers may very soon have
an effect directly contrary to its purpose.</p>
<p>Two methods of securing the labour of bondsmen have been
suggested. First,&mdash;it is proposed that, instead of being
paid with money only, they should be paid partly with money and
partly with land; the right to the land to depend upon good
behaviour during the whole term of service mentioned by the bond,
and to vest, of course, only at the expiration of that term. This
precaution, however well it look upon paper, has been found, in
practice, quite ineffectual; because, wherever land can be
obtained for nothing, labour is much more valuable than
land;&mdash;because John, by saving only two shillings a day for
three years, might obtain as much land as he could possibly want.
Secondly, it has been proposed, with a view to remedy the defect
of the former suggestion, and, generally, in order to prevent
indented labourers from raising the price of labour by becoming
employers of industry, that government should not make grants of
land to persons of that description. But this device is no better
than the other, because John could obtain a grant of land in
Tom's name, to which fraud upon the government Tom would be happy
to lend himself for nothing; or, in the worst case for John, he
might buy some of Tom's, or of any other body's land for a mere
trifle. My late menial has recommended that indented labourers
should be bound for life, liable to have their "backs scarified,"
and forbidden by law either to own or hire land, or to work for
any but the man who had imported them. This plan would be
effectual, no doubt; and we may, perhaps, adopt it. But many
people would prefer <i>negro</i> slavery, as being, though far
more unjust, and therefore more cruel, nevertheless, much better
calculated to please the English nation, which does not approve
of white slavery. Thus you will perceive that, even though the
Poor rates of England were employed in sending labourers to this
country, instead of maintaining them in idleness at home, the
colonial rate of wages would not be permanently diminished. As
before, there would exist an urgent want of labourers; and the
only difference would be the spread of that want to places where
it does not at present exist. The sole reason why it does not now
exist in those places is, because none of the land, there, is yet
appropriated. In time, the same intense want of labourers,
extended over an immense space, would bring this country to the
condition of North America, where, though the population be now
eleven millions, the want of labourers is as urgent as ever, and
is not altered in character by the increase of people, except
that, instead of being confined to a strip of land on the coast,
it is extended over half a continent. At the first blush, one
would suppose that a want of labour, being in fact a scarcity of
people, would be supplied by a supply of people; and this, of
course, would be the case in a country where all the land was
appropriated. But in an extensive country, of which by far the
greater part is still open to be appropriated by all who can
muster capital for cultivating a grant, an increase of people has
no permanent effect in supplying the want of labourers. On the
contrary, if the immigrants should be capitalists they would
render the want of labourers still more urgent; and this may
account for the jealousy, and dislike, almost, with which newly
arrived settlers in this colony are regarded by those who
preceded them. In many of the books that treat of New South Wales
and Van Diemen's Land, you will find this jealousy frequently
mentioned. The writers in question attribute it to a fear, on the
part of the older settler, that he may be deprived, by a
new-comer, of the use of certain unappropriated land in the
neighbourhood of his own grant; and this, I believe, is what the
older settler imagines to be his motive for falsely assuring the
new-comer, that there is no land worth having in his
neighbourhood. But were he to reflect for a moment, he would see
that, the sooner all the land in his neighbourhood is
appropriated and cultivated, the sooner will his own land possess
some market value; a circumstance far more profitable to him than
the use, for grazing only, of land which, sooner or later, must
be appropriated by others. He would acknowledge, therefore, that
his real, though latent, motive for wishing to remain isolated in
the desert, had been a fear of being surrounded by competitors in
the market of labour.</p>
<p>From all these considerations we may infer, that whatever the
amount of immigration into a waste country, there must constantly
exist an urgent demand for labour, so long as the territory at
the disposal of the people shall remain immense in proportion to
their numbers&mdash;so long, in other words, as there shall
remain any fertile land not cultivated. I, for one, used to think
quite otherwise. Like thousands who have settled in waste
countries, I thought that any actual want for labour might be
permanently supplied by a positive increase of people; and this
was why I lost so much time, like thousands before me, in forming
plans of immigration without reference to territory.</p>
<p>In another respect I fell into what I now believe to be a
great error. I imagined that the only evil attendant upon a
scarcity of labourers, was an extravagant rate of wages, which,
by giving to the labourer a very large share of the produce,
prevented the capitalist from accumulating. But I now perceive,
that in new countries, a still more fatal check to improvement
occurs through an absolute want of labourers at any rate of
wages. To make this clear, I beg of you to remark that there is a
<i>maximum</i> as well as a <i>minimum</i> of wages. No one will
work for less than a bare subsistence, and none will employ
labourers but for profit. The <i>minimum</i>, therefore, being
the smallest portion of the produce upon which the labourer can
exist, the <i>maximum</i> is the largest share which the
capitalist can <i>profitably</i> relinquish to the labourer. In
old countries, the price of labour varies continually, according
to the variations in the proportion between capital and labour;
but in some old countries the <i>minimum</i> is become the
ordinary and permanent rate; because, however much capital may
have accumulated, no more of it can be profitably employed in
providing food for the redundant population. In new countries, on
the contrary, the <i>maximum</i> is the ordinary and permanent
rate; because, however much people may multiply, they are not
obliged to sell their labour, and most of them, by saving a small
capital and obtaining land, become buyers of labour. This,
however, does not comprise the whole difference between old and
new countries in respect to the original purchase money of all
things. In some old countries, many labourers cannot obtain even
the <i>minimum</i> of wages, but are either starved or maintained
in idleness. In Britain, for example, though we cannot tell how
many people die of misery, we know how many millions of money are
annually expended in maintaining idle paupers. Whereas, in new
countries, capitalists often cannot obtain labourers even at the
<i>maximum</i>. In America, when the pay of seamen in the navy
exceeded the <i>maximum</i> of wages in the merchant service, the
naval demand, even for landsmen, was still unsupplied. So at this
moment in Australasia, there is, notwithstanding the limited
supply of cheap labour afforded by convicts, an unsupplied demand
for labourers at the <i>maximum</i>. Take, for example, the case
of settlers in Van Diemen's Land, where as many as 5000 sheep,
sometimes, and 2000 commonly, are allowed to run in one flock,
male and female, old and young, weak and strong, all mixed
together. The loss, in consequence of this bad management, is
immense. That loss would be wholly prevented by the employment of
more shepherds; and anyone capable of estimating the loss, will
acknowledge that its prevention would afford ample wages to the
additional shepherds, besides leaving an additional profit to
their employer. But though these <i>maximum</i> wages are, there,
going abegging, as one may say, there are not labourers to take
them. The case of the Australian Company furnishes another
example. With a capital of £1,000,000, the company proposes "to
produce, at a more distant time, wine, olive oil, hemp, flax,
silk, opium, etc." But why not <i>now</i>? Not for want either of
capital, or of picked land, rent, tithe, and tax free, or of a
favourable climate, or of ready markets; not even for want of
cheap labour, inasmuch as, under the peculiar circumstances,
these commodities might be profitably produced, though wages
should be high;&mdash;but simply, because, for any such purposes,
which require the employment of many hands, there is an absolute
want of hands at any rate of wages.</p>
<p>What does all this mean but that there is a constant waste of
capital? Great part of the capital of the Australian Company is
safely employed in England, at a profit of, perhaps, 3 per cent.
per annum; but is not the trampling to death of sheep in Van
Diemen's Land a waste of capital? Is not the mere destruction of
useful timber a waste of capital? I could fill pages with an
account of the number of things, which would be of great value in
England, which would be considered as capital in any densely
peopled country, but which we throw away as rubbish.</p>
<p>But this state of things is not without many precedents. It
has occurred in every waste country, settled by emigrants from
civilized countries. In most other new countries, it has been
partially remedied by means of slavery; and a time may come when
its evils will be mitigated here in the same way. For, seeing
that this colony would never be any thing but a half-barbarous
Tartarian, ill-cultivated, poverty-stricken wilderness, until, in
the course of nature, some hundreds of years hence, the
population should become more dense, I began to hanker after,
what till then, I had considered the worst of human ills
&mdash;the institution of slavery. How often, in my presumption,
had I cursed the memory of Las Casas, for bribing the first
planters of Hispaniola to spare the inhabitants of that island,
by suggesting that they might obtain slaves from Africa! How
scornfully, in my ignorance of cause and effect, had I abused the
Democrats of North America for cherishing the horrors of slavery!
In moments of weakness, how I had sighed, and even shed tears of
compassion and anger, at the damnable cruelties which I saw
inflicted upon Blacks at the Cape of Good Hope! And yet, in spite
of my reason and every better feeling of my nature, I brought
myself to find excuses for the Spaniards, Americans, and Dutch;
aye, even to think that a few thousand Negroes would be a great
acquisition to New South Wales! So they would; and they would
conduce to the wealth, and&mdash;deny it who will&mdash;even to
the <i>civilization</i> of these colonial landowners. What made
Lord &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; a rich, well-educated, and agreeable
gentleman?&mdash;The sweat, and blood, and tears of his and his
father's slaves in Jamaica! Had slavery never existed, he would,
in the natural course of things, have been a little West Indian
farmer, perhaps scarcely able to read&mdash;certainly not fit to
be a member of civilized society. What made the most able public
men of North America? Even their slaves, which conferred upon
them riches, leisure, and instruction. Slavery has not produced
any distinguished men in South Africa; because slavery, there, is
of a gentle kind&mdash;domestic, not predial. But the African
farmer is highly civilized, when compared with some of the
descendants of Spaniards, who inhabit the Pampas of the Rio de la
Plata; and he owes whatever distinguishes him from the Tartar to
the cheap labour of his slaves. In my heart I abhor the very name
of slavery; but this is my adopted country, and when I
contemplate its future condition, I can conceive that slavery was
revived for something else than the gratification of man's worst
propensities. Slavery exists, not to gratify the hearts of cruel
men, but to fill the pockets of those who, without slavery, would
be poor and insignificant. It will never be abolished by appeals
to the hearts of slave-owners. You might as well expect to make
Mr. Buxton and Mr. Macaulay live upon vegetables, by showing them
the cruelties of Smithfield. It is wonderful, but true, that,
notwithstanding the great exertions of the abolitionists, the
number of slaves owned by Christians is increasing every day. But
why should we wonder? What was the sole cause of the revival of
slavery by Christians, but the discovery of waste countries, and
the disproportion which has ever since existed in those countries
between the demand and supply of labour? And what is it that
increases the number of slaves to Christian masters, but the
increase of Christian capitalists wanting labourers, by the
spreading of Christian people over regions heretofore waste?</p>
<p>I constantly ask myself, whether it be possible to devise any
means by which to establish, in a new country, such a proportion
between people and land as would render labour plentiful, and not
extravagantly dear. Here we have, it is true, a species of
slave-labour that of convicts, and our system of slavery has been
peculiarly favourable to the master, because the slaves have been
obtained without any prime cost. To this, combined with the
demand for produce created by the great expenditure of
Government, the few rich men of New South Wales are wholly
indebted for their fortunes. But the supply of cheap labour was
always small and variable; and, of late, the demand has so much
increased, through the increase of landowners, that not the
slightest dependence can be placed on convict labour as a
permanent source of wealth. You may obtain, though not without
trouble, one, two, or perhaps three, convicts, for a term of a
few years; but that they will rob you, is almost certain; that
they will murder you, is by no means improbable; and that their
labour will not be very profitable, is beyond a doubt. What,
then, are we to do, to obtain that desirable proportion between
the demand and supply of labour, without which, I say, no country
can flourish? Answer me that question satisfactorily, and I will
tell you that Botany Bay is an earthly paradise. This, indeed,
would be a glorious discovery. Call it an invention, or what you
will, it must, whenever established in a country cursed with
slavery, cause the natural, slow, easy death of that hideous
monster. Fancy the slavery of America and South Africa in a slow
consumption, and free labour growing up, healthy, strong, and
cheerful, to supply its place! But I am dreaming&mdash;We have a
right to presume that slavery will flourish in America and South
Africa, until there shall be no more land to be obtained for next
to nothing; and that the inhabitants of Australasia must, for
hundreds of years to come, secretly long for a trade in human
flesh. Tell me the time when the disproportion between the demand
and supply of labour in America, South Africa, and Australasia
will cease, and I will tell you when slavery will cease in
America and South Africa, and when the Australasians will become
a rich, instructed, refined, and highly civilized people.
Meanwhile, I deliberately state it as my opinion, that a
permission to obtain slaves from Africa would be most beneficial
to these settlements, with a view only to wealth and
civilization; and that if Australasia should become independent
to-morrow, these people would find some means of establishing
slavery in spite of all the saints.</p>

<div class="insertl">Free Emigrants.</div>
<div>Did I not mention something about intellectual society?
There is no such thing in this country; at least, in the sense
which you attach to the words. We are not barbarians&mdash;the
colony is too young for that. Not even the thieves of England
have had time to forget the civilization, such as it was, which
they brought from the old country. Our free settlers, whose
emigration dates some time after that of the first convicts, are
English men and women, not much altered from what they were in
England. Some generations hence, their descendants will probably
be as uncouth, and ignorant, and violent as the great mass of
North Americans. Perhaps, as here there are no dense forests to
prevent them from spreading, they may become as wild as the
inhabitants of the Pampas, or as gross, lethargic, and stupid as
the boors of the Cape of Good Hope; who, by the by, were
<i>compelled</i> to spread by the Dutch mode of granting land.
But, at present, they are English people, to all intents and
purposes, of that class to which, in England, they belonged. You
will understand, however, that they were not of a class
particularly intellectual, even whilst in England; and it was not
to be expected that they should cultivate their minds here. They
came here for a very different purpose. Literary men, men of
science, philosophers, do not emigrate to new countries where
their acquirements would be neither rewarded nor admired. Sir
Walter Scott, Sir Humphrey Davy, and Mr. Malthus, would not earn
as much in this colony as three brawny experienced ploughmen; and
though the inordinate vanity of a new people might be gratified
by the possession of them, they would be considered as mere
ornaments, and would often be wholly neglected, for things of
greater utility&mdash;unless, indeed, Mr. Malthus could create
for us that proportion of which I have spoken above. In that
case, we should load him with riches, and erect statues to his
honour in every market-place. Apropos of statues&mdash;professors
of the fine arts would be of no greater value here than writers
and philosophers. I can now easily comprehend why Copley and West
emigrated from America, and why Cooper and Irving are become
citizens of Europe. And I have said enough to explain why this
country imports hardly any superior intellect.</div>
<p>Of what class then, you ask, have been the great mass of
emigrants from England, not convicts? Excellent people in their
way, most of them; farmers, army and navy surgeons, subalterns on
half-pay, and a number of indescribable adventurers, from about
the twentieth rank in England. They came here to live, not to
enjoy; to eat and drink, not to refine; to "settle"&mdash;that
is, to roll in a gross plenty for the body, but to starve their
minds. To these must be added convicts, many of whom are become
rich and influential; and some, not exactly convicts, to whom
England ceased to be a convenient residence. The English who live
at Boulogne, some for cheapness, some from misfortune, and some
from fear, would offer, I should think, a fair sample of the
materials which compose the best society in New South Wales;
though, I must admit, that the bustling, thriving settler of New
South Wales is a companion, rather ignorant though he
be&mdash;far away preferable to the not more enlightened, but
melancholy English sluggard of Boulogne. To form a due conception
of the "upper classes" here, suppose all the natives of France
annihilated, and the whole country belonging to the English
residents of Boulogne. In that case, there would be an almost
perfect resemblance between those Englishmen who, across a narrow
channel, can see their own country, and those who, at its
antipodes, look upon the Pacific Ocean. Man&mdash;how often must
it be repeated?&mdash;is the creature of circumstances. In
likening these, my fellow colonists, to the English outcasts in
France, I speak only of their original composition.</p>
<p>They had nothing to lose, and they have gained immensely by
the change in their condition. This is true, both in a pecuniary
and in a moral sense. A poor man who emigrates to New South Wales
may become comparatively rich; and though he should be ever so
idle by habit, he must become industrious, or starve. My case is
an exception to the ordinary course of things, here. I did not
come to <i>make</i> money, but to invest money made by my
grandfather. This was a capital error on my part. But to proceed.
The poor lieutenant, whose miserable pittance would but just
support him in England&mdash;whose wife and children were a
burthen, and whose life was passing away between the anxieties of
poverty and the short day-dreams of brandy and
water&mdash;becomes, here, independent; wealthy in grain and
cattle; a proprietor of thousands of acres; a master of servants,
such as they are; an uxorious husband, and a fond father, because
his wife and children, instead of being a burthen, are of
infinite value to him; and an excellent member of society, such
as it is, because he is deeply interested in the well-being of
the community. What a contrast with the lazy, pick-tooth,
fretful, lounger of the pier at Boulogne!</p>
<p>But this is the bright side. We must not forget the original
composition. I will now briefly describe the actual condition of
our "best society."<br>
<br></p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 43}</u></p>
<a name="ch-07" id="ch-07"></a>
<div class="insertl">Society.</div>
<div>You imagine, perhaps, that society here is divided into but
two classes&mdash;criminal slaves, and their temporary owners.
But let me tell you, this is by no means the case. We have
gradations of rank almost as numerous as those which divide the
community of England. The Governor is King; and a much more
powerful man he is, in respect to those over whom he rules, than
the Sovereign of Britain. This will be clear to you, when you
reflect that the King of England can govern only by responsible
Ministers, and that our King governs without responsibility,
except to those who appoint him; who live at the antipodes of his
palace, and who, of course, trouble themselves but little about
this distant and insignificant settlement. Besides, an Englishman
may be at bitter variance with the Ministers, without the
slightest injury to his private affairs; however loud his
opposition, his name may not even be known to the Government;
and, though he should be a thorn in their sides, like Joseph
Hume, he may be rich and happy in spite of them. Whereas, in this
small community, every man's words are reported and weighed; and
the ill will of the Sovereign may deeply affect his fortunes.
Here, scarcely anybody lives on a fortune made by his
grandfather. It is the local Government which supplies the means
of production, and which, again, is the principal purchaser for
consumption. Here, convicts are of immense value, and it is the
Government which bestows those temporary slaves; here, almost
every man is a cultivator of the soil, and the Government is the
principal buyer of agricultural produce. Add to this, that the
Governor disposes of many offices, some giving rank, and some
profit,&mdash;and, above all, of waste land, that is, of
unappropriated earth, air, and water!</div>
<p>You may perhaps think, that as waste land possesses no value,
the power to dispose of it can give no influence. Reflect,
however, for a moment. Notwithstanding the experience of ages
there are still persons who imagine that an estate of 20,000
acres, bearing noble timber, must, any where, be a very valuable
property. Such persons, guided wholly by their imaginations, long
for extensive domains even in such a country as this; and he who
can gratify or disappoint them, as he pleases, must, for a time,
hold them in subjection. Anticipation is universally more
pleasant than the fact, and one man having controul over the
hopes of mankind would be master of the world. In the next place,
the Government of a new Colony alone determines the sites of
towns, and the direction of roads; whereby it has the power to
give a considerable market value to certain portions of
territory. I am the most independent man in this Colony; but its
Governor could at once put twenty or thirty thousand pounds into
my pocket by making a road through my estate, and nailing upon
one of my trees, a board inscribed with, "This is Town." How,
then, can I help being, at all times, his most devoted humble
servant? How, indeed, but by recollecting that I draw a competent
income from England, which enables me to enjoy my existence; that
in a few years both "His Excellency" and I shall be meat for the
worms; and that, consequently, I have not an hour to spare for
the misery of being his parasite.</p>
<p>The Governments of all new countries exercise an imperceptible
despotism over the affairs of nearly all their subjects, by means
of their power over waste land. They can raise or lower the wages
of labour by restricting or extending grants of earth, air, and
water; and by the same means they can raise or lower the value of
land already appropriated by individuals. Capitalists and
landowners, therefore, are liable to be ruined, or made rich, by
the mere will of the Government. The history of settlements in
desert countries abounds with instances of <i>fluctuations</i> in
the value of land and of labour, arising solely from fluctuations
in the proportion between the people and the territory for their
subsistence; and such fluctuations have, for the most part, been
caused solely by a restriction or an extension to the amount of
grants. I do not pretend that the Governments of new countries
have ever increased or lessened the amount of grants, with a
direct view to raise or lower the value of land and labour: for I
believe that they have been, and still are, unconscious of their
power in this respect; but they have so exercised their power as
to prevent the accumulation of earth. It follows, that they have
had to deal with poor, and therefore impotent subjects; and, of
course, the real power of a Government over its subjects must be
in proportion to their weakness. The Democracy of North America
is not an exception to this general rule; for, do we not, there,
see a whole people exercise the most terrible despotism over
individuals? If the Government of America, that is, the great
body of the people, were highly instructed, individuals would
have nothing to fear from its power; but, at present, wrong is
often inflicted on individuals, without benefit to the mass. An
ignorant body of men, in short, is just as liable as an ignorant
individual, to commit self-injury and self-destruction. If you,
as a Liberal, should be hurt at these remarks, I beg of you to
tell me, whether partizan-murder may not be committed with
impunity in Kentucky? and whether the American tariff be not a
great injury to the whole people that has enacted it?</p>
<p>Hence you may conceive that this Government, or rather
Governor, possesses extraordinary power for good or evil. How
such a degree of power has been used for evil, you will learn, if
you come here, merely by listening when you are at the Cape of
Good Hope. Here, there is no particular reason for complaint; and
I use the language of complaint unwillingly, merely because I
could not otherwise give you a true picture of our condition.
Need I say that there can be no court without courtiers? Of
course, there is a pretty numerous class&mdash;numerous, I mean,
in proportion to forty-five thousand inhabitants, altogether
devoted to "His Excellency." This class forms the "best society"
of Sydney. It is composed of Government officers, unconnected
with the colony, excepting by their offices, of local
magistrates, who are all settlers and landowners, and of the more
opulent merchants, together with their respective wives. Now look
back to what I have said of the original composition of the
emigrants, not convicts. Do you smile at the picture which your
imagination must have conceived? A court, an aristocracy, an
exclusive set, persons of fashion, ladies patronesses, composed,
King and all, of people such as the English who inhabit
Boulogne;&mdash;a St. James's, a White's, an Almack's, at Botany
Bay! It is true, as I hope to be saved. But why should you
wonder?&mdash;Where did men and women ever congregate without the
assumption, by a few of them, of superiority to the many? Nothing
is more general&mdash;nothing, therefore, is more vulgar, than
exclusiveness. Laugh rather at the thing itself than at its
existence here.</p>
<p>As in France, the first class call themselves "gens comme il
faut"; and in England, "people of fashion," or "the
world"&mdash;so here the leaders of society are distinguished by
a peculiar term. They are called "respectable." Not to speak of
France, it is difficult to say what in England constitutes
"fashion." Not high birth, certainly&mdash;for some of the
despots of English society are sprung from the dunghill. Our
epithet to express exclusiveness is, I think, better
chosen&mdash;for though, strictly speaking, it means worthy of
respect, it is claimed, here, only by those to whom respect is
paid. In England, the <i>Quarterly Review</i> tells us,
"respectability" sometimes means keeping a rig&mdash;here it
always means dining with the Governor.</p>
<p>You will readily understand, that an exclusive set being once
established, those who compose it are jealous of their
privileges. In this respect we do but mimic the "best society" of
England. We are proud, shy, difficult of access to those whom we
despise, presumptuous, sarcastic of whatever does not meet our
notions of right, swollen, blinded with a sense of our own
importance. In a word, we are "the world" at Botany Bay.&mdash;We
look with an evil eye upon those who are rising to belong to us;
we examine and canvass their pretensions; and we admit them, only
after is long course of insult, to the honour of equal terms.
They, in their turn, become excluders; and thus the farce
proceeds&mdash;but is not this a picture of Grosvenor-square?</p>
<p>Our manners set the fashion. Those whom we exclude, exclude
others. Free emigrants claim to be of a nature superior to
convicts; convicts, whose terms of punishment have expired,
behave as if their flesh and blood were wholly unlike that of
convicts still in durance; convicts, who have not been convicted
south of the line, scorn those who have; and these several
classes, except the last, are as proud and tenacious of their
privileges as is every distinctive class in England, except the
unhappy lowest; or, as is every shade of colour in the West
Indies except the perfect black. The main features of the human
character are every where alike, and a passion for distinctions
seems to be implanted in our nature.</p>

<div class="insertl" style="text-align:center;">Ruling idea
of<br>
the Colony.</div>
<div>Recollecting what has been said of the class to which you,
as an emigrant, would belong, now learn that our most interesting
subject of conversation is the price of wool. As our territory is
extensive in proportion to its inhabitants, so, and for that very
reason, our ideas are confined within a circle extremely narrow.
Owing to the cheapness of land, it is impossible to obtain a
revenue without labour of some kind; and farming is the most
fashionable kind of labour. Owing to the scarcity of labouring
hands, we produce hardly any commodity for foreign markets except
wool, which may be produced almost without hands. Thus landlords
and merchants think continually of wool, as did English landlords
and merchants at the time when woolsacks were placed in the House
of Lords, to fix the thoughts of the legislature on what most
deeply interested the community. We are in a barbarous condition,
like that of every people scattered over A territory immense in
proportion to their numbers; every man is obliged to occupy
himself with questions of daily bread; there is neither leisure
nor reward for the investigation of abstract truth; money-getting
is the universal object; taste, science, morals, manners,
abstract politics, are subjects of little interest, unless they
happen to bear upon the wool question; and, what is more
deplorable, we have not any prospect of a change for the better.
When will the territory of this country be not immense in
proportion to its inhabitants? I see that you do not like the
picture. Should you like to live in Kentucky? But if you come
here, you will be a wool-grower; your mind will shrink to that
narrow capacity, which is called <i>esprit de corps</i>; and you
will then enjoy what now would disgust you. Did the members of
the United Service Club ever tire of military concerns?&mdash;is
the bar ever sick of lawyers' gossip?&mdash;do authors ever shun
the subject of their own works? In England, however, there is an
unavoidable variety, which gives a greater zest to the indulgence
of every man's ruling idea. Here we have nothing but wool, wool,
wool; and it will be thus to the end of a chapter, of which we
have seen only the first page.</div>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 54}</u></p>
<a name="ch-09" id="ch-09"></a>
<div class="insertl">Colonial Ladies.</div>
<div>But, you ask, do the women think of nothing but wool?
<i>Ladies!</i> Sir, if you please. Women, indeed! I should like
to hear you call our Governor's wife a woman. At a tea party in
New York, where I was the only man, I remarked that the men of
America shewed very bad taste, and a sad ignorance of what
constitutes happiness, by prizing so little the society of women.
"Women, indeed!" exclaimed a tall, slender, sallow girl, without
teeth; "Women, indeed!" and then she turned up her nose and
snorted, as if I had called her dog's wife. Similar tokens of
displeasure were evinced by the whole circle. I felt that the
word "women" had given offence. Cautiously, and fearing to make
bad worse, I said "females"&mdash;"the society of females." Still
wrong; I tried again;&mdash;"the sex," said I, in a deprecating,
wheedling tone, "the society of the fair sex." No. Though the
general scowl was somewhat relaxed, I felt quite confounded and
wished for an earthquake to cover my embarrassment. At length,
the first offended one&mdash;pitying me, I suppose&mdash;gravely
uttered "the ladies." "The ladies," shouted I&mdash;and all was
right.</div>
<p>In new countries, where, for the reasons already given,
narrow-mindedness must prevail, politeness consists entirely of
forms; and the least infraction of those precise rules which make
up the code of behaviour, is reckoned a grave offence. So it is
here; not exactly because this is a new country&mdash;for it is
not old enough to have a character of its own&mdash;but, because
the greater part of those who have transported themselves hither
were originally narrow-minded&mdash;because persons of enlarged
views will not quit civilization and refinement, to vegetate in
the wilderness. Some fifty years hence, Australasia will have a
native stock of the attributes of newness; &mdash;it has those
attributes now, but they are importations from England. Fifty
years hence a Sydney tea party will be dangerous ground for an
uninitiated Englishman, not a prig;&mdash;even now it contains
some awkward spots which are hidden from him, who is used only to
the firm footing of truly polished intercourse. Am I not refining
over much? I admit it;&mdash;the barbarism of new countries is
become my ruling idea.</p>
<p>Now I will answer your question. The ladies of Sydney do think
of something besides wool. They think of household affairs, of
beef, mutton, pork; of their convict maidservants, who, however
troublesome, are far better than none; of dress, earnestly,
though not profoundly, as they study less to ornament their
persons than to outvie their neighbours in finery; of questions
of precedence, which furnish them with heart-burnings,
bickerings, and desperate feuds; of their "respectability;" and
of all those very, very little things, which occupy the minds of
women not strongly tempted to acquire, either delightful
knowledge, or the other arts, meaner than knowledge, by which
superior men are pleased. Will you come here? Are there not
plenty of vulgar bodies in England? Plenty. Then fancy one of
them converted, by sudden elevation to the first place any where,
into a vulgar fine lady, and you will form a pretty correct idea
of a setter of fashions at Sydney. Mind&mdash;I am speaking only
of our old or middle-aged ladies patronesses. There is a young
race of striking beauty. The latitude of Sydney is 33° south;
that of Cyprus about 85° north; the line of heat is north of the
equator; all imported animals improve here. But I will not
explain myself yet;&mdash;the "Currency Lasses," as they are
vulgarly called, shall have a chapter to themselves.</p>

<a name="ch-10" id="ch-10"></a>
<div class="insertl">Politics.</div>
<div>You cannot believe that the men of New South Wales think
absolutely of nothing but wool. I did not say so. I said, only,
that wool forms their most interesting subject of conversation;
that it is the ruling idea of the colony. Other matters obtain
occasional notice. Some of these I will mention presently; but
first, you must be made acquainted with a very curious feature of
the colonial mind.</div>
<p>Remember where I am. I am standing, with my head downwards, as
it were, almost under your feet. Your letter has made me think of
you; but I am bound to confess that, for two or three years
before I received it, the image of my old friend, my school
crony, my college chum, the most intimate companion of my early
and enthusiastic manhood, did never once cross my perverted
thoughts. In all that time I never thought of you; not even once.
Are you surprised? Remember where I am! Should we love our
parents, if, after the period of infancy, we were never reminded
of them? Not more than the beasts that perish, which have no
reason for keeping in remembrance the authors of their being. It
is thus with the emigrant to a far distant land. He is severed
from all that he once held dear, and is fixed immutably, where
nothing occurs to remind him of his birth-place. As a plant, torn
from the soil in which it germinated, and placed in one of a
different nature, gradually accommodates itself to the new
situation, and at length flourishes as if it had never been
removed, so the wanderer from home, should he once take root in a
foreign land, feels and acts as if he had been born there; his
affections are utterly divorced from objects of early attachment;
they are wedded to the new abode; he forgets the old country; the
new country becomes to him all in all. This ilk peculiarly true
of men, who, by emigrating, exchange poverty for comparative
wealth, anxiety for peace of mind, misery for happiness. If that
were possible, it would be still more true of poor emigrants who
obtain property in land. Nearly all my fellow-colonists were once
poor, and are now lords of the soil. Wonder not when I tell you,
that they regard Old England with no more concern than a
flourishing English yeoman bestows upon New South Wales. The
above was a necessary introduction to some account of colonial
politics. Into what parties are we divided? What are our standing
questions?</p>
<p>As with you, we have "Government" and "Opposition." You see
the necessity of government, but wish to learn the purpose of
opposition. The use of your opposition, regarding it, not as a
party, but as an act, is not always apparent. The existence of
our opposition party must be explained by reference to the last
paragraph. The Government is conducted by Englishmen connected
with the colony only by their offices. These persons do not come
here to remain. They are not settlers in any sense of the word.
By the settlers, therefore, with whose indifference towards
England you are acquainted, they are regarded as foreigners. They
<i>are</i> foreigners, except by name. Their main interests and
affections have reference only to England. They are mere
sojourners here. They do not like the place, even as a temporary
residence. How should they? Is it not Botany Bay? Having to deal
with a population, of which far more than half the adults are
criminals actually suffering punishment, they acquire the
sentiments and manners of gaolers and turnkeys. They are
overbearing, therefore; peremptory; quick at taking offence;
suspicious; jealous of their almost boundless power; and yet
fearful of the lawless body under their controul, whom, at the
same time, they despise. Nevertheless, their enormous power for
good or evil procures them many partizans amongst the colonists.
These, united with them, form the Government party. The
Opposition consists of emancipated convicts who have attained
wealth and importance, of the children of convicts, and of
certain free emigrants&mdash;men of fiery, and, in many cases, of
generous tempers; of whom some cannot tamely brook subjection in
their own persons, some hate oppression in the abstract, and some
are filled with a high ambition, like that which urged the
robber-shepherd to found Rome. These are the leaders of
four-fifths of the population. They are bent upon procuring for
the colony a Government of colonial origin. They want Trial by
Jury and a Legislative Assembly. They talk even of perfect
Independence. They are rebels, every one of them, at heart; and
nothing but a sense of weakness deters them from drawing the
sword.</p>
<p>The state of Spain during the reign of Joseph Bonaparte offers
a parallel to our political condition. We have a foreign King,
the creature of a foreign power; foreign civil officers, a
foreign army, domestic partizans of the foreign rule, and a
people strongly disaffected. The likeness holds good in another
important particular. As most of the Spanish partizans of J.
Bonaparte were still essentially Spaniards, and went always ready
to have deserted the foreign King for a powerful Government
purely Spanish; so the Australian partizans of the deputed
British Government would, I believe, with very few exceptions,
rejoice to obtain a domestic government, which is the avowed
object of the Opposition. If the immediate independence of this
country were a probable event, the whole body of colonists would
form one party. At present they are divided into two
parties&mdash;those who serve time and bow to circumstances,
taking meanwhile all the good within their reach &mdash;and those
who, regardless of time and seasons, have embarked their energies
in a cause, which must be hopeless during their generation. The
independence of Botany Bay! Of course, if you come here, you will
belong to the Government party.</p>
<p>To one or other you must belong, unless you would prefer to be
at enmity with both. Neutrality is out of the question. An
English Churchman may live in peace between a Papist and a
Methodist, because there are some points on which he can agree
with both, as, indeed, the opinions of all three have a common
foundation; but in this small colony, the disagreement of parties
is absolute and universal. It admits of no compromise or
qualification. It extends from the great speculative question of
independence over all possible matters of opinion, and through
every operation of the Government down to the least important act
of the most humble public functionary. The hostility which it
begets is bitter and unceasing, and the manner in which the
warfare is conducted is dogmatical and personally offensive;
because, in the first place, the opposing factions of our little
capital are necessarily brought face to face, from year's end to
year's end, and from morning to night; and, secondly, because
cheapness of land and dearness of labour render men's minds as
narrow as their territory is extensive, preventing, not only the
native growth of liberal feeling and polished manners, but also
the importation from abroad of those attributes of civilization.
Have I said enough to convince you that the state of parties,
here, does not admit of neutrality?</p>
<p>This account of the intensity of party feeling is not at
variance with my assertion that wool is the ruling idea of the
colony. Of course you do not understand that assertion quite
literally. It is, however, almost literally true. "Clearing" is
the ruling idea of an American backwoodsman; and yet he may be a
savage partizan of Clay or Jackson. It is just because the
colonists are too much occupied with questions of daily bread, to
have leisure for inquiry and reflection, that they make such
violent politicians. Were the leading men of both parties as rich
as they would be, supposing land dear and labour cheap, they
would have time and motive calmly to examine the great question
that disturbs them. They would perceive, on the one hand, that
this colony is not yet qualified to govern itself, even
partially, by means of a colonial assembly; and, on the other
hand, that its complete independence is, sooner or later,
inevitable, supposing no decided alteration in the colonial
policy of Britain. Having made these concessions to reason and
truce they would have a common object; that of securing every
<i>attainable</i> good, and cultivating the resources, and, above
all, the minds of their countrymen, with a view to that
self-government which must come, but which would prove a grievous
curse, if it should come out of season and without due
preparation.</p>
<p>It behoves me to satisfy you that we are not at present
qualified to govern ourselves, and to state my reasons for
presuming that our grand-children will assert their
independence.</p>
<p>First, as to our incapacity for self-government. The
population of the settlement may amount in round numbers to
45,000. Of these only 14,000, including women and children, have
not been convicted of felony; and two-thirds of the remainder,
seven-eighths being grown men, are galley-slaves, still in
chains! Are you convinced?</p>
<p>Secondly, as to the probable epoch of our independence. This
question may not be settled by a few figures. Indeed, it involves
so many, and such grave considerations, that I have done wrong,
perhaps, to touch upon it in a familiar letter. I will not,
however, discuss the whole question; as it is not from me that
you have to learn why a people, governed from afar, and
continually increasing their territory, must have a continually
increasing tendency to rebellion. I will therefore only point
your attention to several circumstances, which, in this colony,
are either peculiar or excessive, and which threaten to give an
uncommonly rapid progress to the tendency just mentioned.</p>
<p>1. The very great distance between the government and the
subjects, which far exceeds the space by which any former
plantation, having free scope for the increase of people, was
separated from a mother country. 3. In this colony there are
neither warlike natives, nor dense forests, nor extensive swamps,
nor impracticable mountains, to prevent the people from
<i>spreading</i> till they shall become as wild as Tartars, and
as awkward to catch. Nor are there any great navigable rivers to
compensate, by affording easy communication between distant
parts, for the want of savages, forests, swamps, and mountains.
3. Land is cheaper, and as soon as the present system of Penal
Slavery shall be at an end, labour will be dearer, than in other
new countries. I say that land is cheaper than elsewhere, because
this use of land can be obtained at a less price. The settler in
North America, though be should obtain a right to land for
nothing, must pay largely for the use of that right. He must
clear and drain his grant before he can use it, at a great cost
of money or money's worth. Whereas, here, there are hundreds of
thousands of square miles of unappropriated land, already cleared
and drained by the hand of nature. Land, therefore, may be said
to be cheaper, here, than in America. Cheapness of land is
another expression for scarcity of labourers; and as land here is
extraordinarily cheap, we may expect that, when the supply of
convicts shall cease, labourers for hire will be excessively
scarce. Thus we shall have excessive dearness of labour; but this
is not all: we shall suffer also from an excessive scarcity of
dear labour. As to this point, I must refer to the preceding
remarks on the subject of labour. Dearness of labour, alone,
would go far to prevent the accumulation of wealth; but a
scarcity of dear labour will absolutely forbid it. Hence I judge
that our grand-children will be a race of unmixed barbarians,
more <i>ungovernable</i> than even the white savages of Kentucky.
4. The democratic spirit which must exist, where every man
possesses a little wealth and a little knowledge, but no man
possessing much of either, will surely exist here. That this
spirit cannot exist without hostility to England, the least
democratic of free States, is proved by the history of Republican
France, and of Independent America. Since the Americans opened
roads over the chain of the Alleghanies, and thus obtained
greater facilities for spreading, they are become less civilized,
more democratical, and, I believe, more hostile to England, than
in the days of Franklin and Washington. Hence, and looking also
at the hatred of authority which has been imported, and is
constantly maintained by criminal immigration, I conclude that
the Australians will hate their parent country more bitterly, and
at an earlier period, than did the British Colonists in America,
because they will have greater facilities for growing up poor,
ignorant, and democratical. 5. And lastly&mdash;coming now to the
question of power. It was not the forests and swamps of America
that enabled a handful of farmers and hucksters to defeat a
powerful nation. If the American colonists had accumulated
wealth, and had been crowded together, though in the midst of
forests and swamps, they might have been readily subdued. It was
their poverty and their dispersion that constituted their
strength. They had little to lose except their lives, and it was
impossible to take their lives on a large scale, because they
were never to be caught congregated in masses. They met the force
of Concentration, which is so useful in attack, by a successful
defence, of which the essence was Dispersion. The Parthians of
old, the Cossacks of late, and now the South American Republics,
whose fruitless endeavours to destroy each other promise to be
perpetual, have established, that Tartars, united in will and
fighting on their own plains, are not to be conquered. From the
foregoing considerations, it appears to me that Australasia is
peculiarly adapted to become, and at a very early period too, the
abode of a Tartar people. I conclude, therefore that our
grandchildren will govern, or rather misgovern, themselves.</p>

<div class="insertl" style="text-align:center;">Influence of
Convict<br>
Labour.</div>
<div>So gloomy a view of our prospects appears, I know, at
variance with what has actually occurred here. Little more than
forty years ago this country was an absolute waste. By way of
contrast, behold, in the parts first settled, the following
proofs of wealth: a thriving capital, and several inferior towns,
the latter being larger and better constructed than the capitals
of some English settlements in America, a hundred years after
their foundation; excellent roads; productive turnpikes; crowded
market-places; public hotels, superior to the best in North
America, even at this late hour; warehouses, through which there
is a constant flow of luxuries from all parts of the world;
public carriages, almost as well managed as those of England; an
astonishing number of private carriages, built in Long-Acre;
several newspapers, and other periodical works; booksellers'
shops, well supplied from Europe; two banks of deposit and
discount; many churches and chapels; very good schools for rich
and poor; scientific, literary, and philanthropic societies; a
botanical garden; a turf club; packs of hounds; dinner parties,
concerts, and balls; fine furniture, plate, and jewels; and
though last, not least, many gradations in society, being so many
gradations in wealth. "All this," I hear you exclaim, "in forty
years! No North American colony made half the progress in double
the time! In all modern history there is no parallel case of
creation from nothing&mdash;and by a parcel of thieves, too! That
Australia must possess some happy quality denied to other new
countries, and still a mystery, like the instinct of the
carrier-pigeon, of which we know nothing but its results! Surely,
so fortunate a people will not degenerate into barbarism."</div>
<p>Perhaps not; but attend, for this matter concerns you deeply.
In settling a perfectly waste country, the main object, as well
as the chief difficulty, is to produce on the spot, food for the
first emigrants, and a surplus quantity for those who are to
follow them. For the passage of this asses' bridge, in the
process of founding a colony, one thing is
indispensable&mdash;capital; that is, seed-corn, cattle for
stock, implements of husbandry, and food to keep the settlers
alive, whilst producing food for the future; but the epoch of
success will be determined by two other things, over which the
settlers can exercise no control&mdash;namely, the state of the
soil to be cultivated, and the nature of the climate. In the case
of every plantation in North America, whether English, French, or
Dutch, the settlers had to contend with a soil which, being
covered with dense forests, required much labour, and with a
climate which incapacitated them for labour. It followed, of
course, that they should struggle for a long while with hunger,
produced by sickness, and with sickness again, produced by
hunger. In every case, many years, and, in some cases more than
forty years, elapsed, before the emigrants escaped out of that
vicious circle. Now, in all that has been written of the un
timbered, grassy regions, and the glorious climate of
Australasia, there is not a word of exaggeration. Even here,
however, famine made some havoc amongst the first settlers, until
they had passed the thickly timbered district near the coast. But
when their cows led them to those green plains, they could sow
and reap without the labour of "clearing;" their cattle grew fat,
and multiplied rapidly; the asses' bridge was passed; and the
advantage, so quickly gained, was, from the nature of its causes,
imperishable. If you would thoroughly appreciate the merits of
clear land and a wholesome climate, compare Mr. Cunningham's
account of our new settlement at Bathurst with Captain Beaver's
Journal of an attempt at colonization on the western coast of
Africa. At Bathurst, only one settler died in the course of
several years; at Bulama, the whole colony was in the hospital at
once. I acknowledge, therefore, that nature has bestowed those
very great merits on this country; but they are not of a
mysterious nature, for their operation is as manifest as their
results. Nor do they account for the actual wealth of the colony.
They explain only why an ample supply of food was obtained at a
very early period; but food, taken by itself, is not wealth.
Whence have come all those things, over and above mere
subsistence, which astonish the beholder, when he reflects that
this colony has been planted little more than forty years?</p>
<p>An example has just passed my window, in the shape of a
dashing English landau. It contains a "lady," who married a poor
half-pay lieutenant, and who now drinks tea that would cost in
England twenty shillings the pound. They emigrated to New South
Wales in 1815. But how did she get that carriage, and how does
she manage to send to China for the gunpowder? Thus:&mdash;Her
husband is both landowner and merchant. Being constantly supplied
with a number of convict labourers, he breeds cattle and
cultivates grain; and as he gives to his labourers but just
enough for their subsistence, he has a large surplus produce.
Having sold to the local government wheat and beef for the supply
of prisons, hospitals, and barracks, he is paid partly with bills
upon the English treasury, and partly with dollars, sent from
England for the support of the great penitentiary. He remits one
of those bills to his London agent, and desires him to purchase,
with the proceeds thereof, a superb landau. In less than a year,
his wife "rides in her coach." He sends some of the dollars to
Canton, and purchases therewith a cargo of tea, of which he gives
to his wife as much as she likes, and sells the rest to the wives
of other men, who pay him with bills or dollars, received again
from the government for wheat and beef. Thus, you see, Mrs.
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; is indebted for two decided proofs of
wealth to the prevalence of crime in England. Even the coat of
arms on her landau was found by your Herald's College, in return
for a part of the proceeds of that bill, which was drawn <i>to
pay for the food of the soldiers who drove the convicts, who
produced the food</i>. Our old friend Sir George Nayler would no
doubt start at being told of his obligation to the pickpockets of
London. And the rogues are little aware of their influence in
political economy; but I have stated a plain fact, which, if you
have any doubts about it, pray submit both to Sir George himself,
and to Mr. M'Culloch.</p>
<p>That is, indeed, an ill-wind which blows no good. We owe every
thing, over and above mere subsistence, to the wickedness of the
people of England. Who built Sydney? Convicts? Who made the
excellent roads from Sydney to Parramatta, Windsor, and
Liverpool? Convicts. By whom is the land made to produce? By
convicts. Why do not all our labourers exact high wages, and, by
taking a large share of the produce of labour, prevent their
employers from becoming rich? Because most of them are convicts.
What has enabled the landowner readily to dispose of his surplus
produce? The demand of the keepers of convicts. What has brought
so many ships to Port Jackson, and occasioned a further demand
for agricultural produce? The transportation of convicts. What
has tempted free emigrants, to bring capital into the settlement?
The true stories that they heard of fortunes made by employing
the cheap labour of convicts. But here are questions and answers
enough. The case is plain. Nearly all that we possess has arisen
from the happy influence of penal emigration and discipline, on
production, distribution, and consumption. Thanks to the system
of transportation, we have have had cheap labour and a ready
market; production, consequently, has exceeded consumption; and
the degree of that excess is the measure of our
accumulation&mdash;that is, of our wealth.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* "Place us on an equal footing with New South
Wales, by giving us a share in those benefits which must, more or
less, accrue from supporting convicts and from convict
labour."&mdash;<i>Suggestions on the propriety of re-introducing
British Convict Labour into British North America. By a Canadian.
London</i>, 1824.]</p>
<p>But will transportation continue to exert the same happy
influence on our condition? t think not. If, for every acre of
land that may be appropriated here, there should be a conviction
for felony in England, our prosperity would rest on a solid
basis; but, however earnestly we may desire it, we cannot expect
that the increase of crime will keep pace with the spread of
colonization. What, then, must happen? Every day sees an increase
in the number of employers of labour, without a proportionate
increase in the number of labourers. As convicts are fairly
distributed amongst those who want them, the general increase of
demand diminishes the supply to each settler. Twenty thousand
convicts, divided amongst five hundred settlers, would give to
each settler forty pair of bands, wherewith to obtain for his
wife a superb landau and plenty of gunpowder; but divide the same
number of convicts amongst ten times the number of settlers, and
poverty, in respect to every thing above mere subsistence, must
be the lot of all. During forty years we have combined the fire
and water of political economy&mdash;cheap land and cheap labour.
The result is, no doubt, astonishing: but, as that strange union
of contradictions is almost at an end, so what it has produced
will vanish like a steam-cloud produced by the fire and water of
physics, which can be maintained only by the constant action of
its cause. The union of cheapness of labour with cheapness of
land depended on <i>the proportion</i> which labour bore to
appropriated land. Alter that proportion, either by diminishing
the quantity of labour, or increasing the quantity of land, and
you dissolve the unnatural union. Every day, I must repeat, sees
an increase in the quantity of; land, whilst the quantity of
labour remains the same. Ten years hence land will be as cheap as
ever, and we shall talk of cheap labour as a thing that was. Ten
years hence, perhaps sooner, the peculiar cheapness of land,
which is a natural attribute of this country, must operate
without a check; the accumulation of wealth must cease; and most
of that creation from nothing, which astonishes the hasty
observer, will gradually perish.</p>
<p>These are my opinions. If I am not mistaken, I am not wrong in
supposing that we shall become a Tartar people. "Perhaps not,"
you say; "but why bore me by dwelling so wearisomely on cheap
land and dear labour?" Because, I answer, you have asked for
information about a new country.</p>

<a name="ch-12" id="ch-12"></a>
<div class="insertl">Wool Question.</div>
<div>You ask me in particular, whether the emigrant to New South
Wales, having capital, may expect to make large profits by the
growth of wool? In direct opposition to the ruling idea of my
fellow-colonists, I answer&mdash;No. Here, I should not for the
life of me, dare to express such an opinion, much less to support
it by argument; but to you, whose passions are not yet interested
in the subject, and who desire not flattery but truth, I may
venture to state both sides of the question. You will afterwards
judge for yourself.</div>
<p>In favour of the speculation&mdash;First, the unlimited extent
of natural pasturage will allow an unlimited increase of sheep.
Secondly, the food provided by nature is peculiarly agreeable to
the animal, but not more so than the climate, which, it is now
ascertained, causes a great improvement in the native fleece.
Thirdly, owing to an abundance of natural food throughout the
year, and to our mild climate, which forbids the use of clothes
or buildings, as well as to the very nature of the pursuit, sheep
farming may be conducted with very little labour. It is not
affected, therefore, by that colonial curse, the scarcity of
labour. Fourthly, as wool is light, and nearly imperishable, it
may easily be conveyed to market, notwithstanding the want of
internal communications, which, in respect to heavier and less
durable goods, would check production, even though labour were
plentiful. Fifthly, there exists in England a demand for
Australian wool, where also there is a supply of goods required
by us. Thus we have a market of exchange for the commodity that
we can most readily furnish. Lastly, very considerable fortunes
have been made and secured, and even carried to England, by
Australian flock-masters.</p>
<p>On the other hand, against the speculation, there are all the
circumstances apparently in favour of it, not excepting even the
last. Your question, mind, applies not to quantity, but to profit
only. Last year we exported to England above 1,500,000lbs. of
wool. Our fine wooled sheep, of which none that will live are
killed, double themselves every third year. Your demand for
foreign wool somewhat exceeds 30,000,000lbs. We might, therefore,
in less than fifteen years, supply the whole of your demand, and
a great deal more. That we shall do so within twenty years I
firmly believe. For the six reasons stated above, there is no
assignable limit to our capacity for production, and there is
every possible encouragement to over-production. May not, then,
the wool-grower of Australasia be permanently, like the French
wine-growers at this time, "rich in goods, and yet ruined?" Not
so, you think. The laws of political economy will operate as
usual; the want of profit will divert capital to some other
employment; and a diminution of supply will enliven the market
and raise the price. This argument is, no doubt, conclusive when
applied to the glut of a commodity of which the production is
expensive. As soon as the poorer wine-growers of France shall be
destroyed by lowness of price, a less quantity will be produced,
and those who weather the storm of low prices will once more
obtain satisfactory profits. So, also, the over production of
wool in Germany, where rent, taxes, and an unfavourable climate,
occasion heavy expenses, would cure itself by means of low prices
and the diversion of capital. But here, remember, wool may be
produced almost without expense. Indeed, now that we have an
ample stock of fine fleeced sheep, the quantity would increase of
its own accord, if not in spite of us. The demand, it is evident,
will not keep pace with our production, and the over-production
will be perpetual. What must result but a gradual fall of prices
and permanent low profits? I do not pretend of course, that we
shall continue to send wool to England, unless you continue to
offer us a remunerating price. All I assert is, that we shall
very soon produce so large a quantity as to bring down the price
far below the mark of high profits, and that a continued excess
of production will maintain perpetual low prices.</p>
<p>Still, you say, large fortunes have been made in New South
Wales by breeding sheep. Unquestionably; but if you inquire into
the causes of that fact, and look at its effects, you will not
mention it again as an argument in favour of the speculation.
Hitherto the demand for wool has been equal to the supply, and
those who took advantage of the extraordinary facilities for
production which this country affords, have obtained high prices
for a commodity which cost them very little. Those very
facilities, I have endeavoured to show, now threaten to alter the
relation between demand and supply, and to cause a proportionate
fall of price and of profits. But our rich sheep farmers owe
their fortunes, not so much to the high price, in proportion to
the cost of production, which they have hitherto obtained for
wool, as to the monoply which they have had of an article still
more in demand than wool itself&mdash;namely, fine-fleeced sheep.
Mr. Macarthur, for instance, who was the first to perceive how
admirably this country is suited to sheep-farming, made more
money by the sale of sheep to his fellow colonists than by the
sale of fleeces to the wool-staplers of London. Possessing, upon
this subject, a monopoly of good sense, foresight, and
enterprise, he brought into the colony a stock of fine-wooled
sheep, and thus secured, during several years, a most profitable
monopoly in trade. But the advantage that he, and others who
followed his example, enjoyed for some time, has already
exhausted itself. The supply of sheep <i>for stock</i> is already
equal to the demand; a great fall in price has ensued; and as
sheep increase much faster than people, there is no chance of an
alteration favourable to the flock-owner. Consequently, we must
not infer that, because at one time riches were obtained by
sheep-farming, that pursuit will bestow riches in future. Indeed,
looking now at the effects of the fact which I admit&mdash;at the
eager desire which it has created amongst all classes here to
extend the production of wool; at your London companies formed
for that purpose, with their two millions of capital; at the
number of emigrants that it has brought, and is still bringing to
the Colony, provided with crack flocks, and bent upon driving the
Spaniards and Saxons out of the English market;&mdash;looking, I
say, at all these immediate consequences of past success in
sheep-farming, I think that the undoubted fact will be one main
cause of over-production and low profits in future. In support of
this opinion, I must tell you that the breeding of coarse-wooled
sheep <i>for mutton</i> was, until lately, a very profitable
trade; but that now all the meat of a fat wether sells for little
more than the cost of driving him to market, killing him,
skinning him, cutting him up, and selling him piecemeal.* Where
then is the return for breeding and fattening him? Why, the truth
is, that Nature, who is not particular about returns, conducts
nearly all that part of the business. I have read that at one
time the price of a horse in South America was 200 ounces of
gold, and of a cow 150 ounces. Not many years later, as now in
some of the plains eastward of the Andes cows and horses were to
be had for the ditching. I do not mean to say that Australasia
will abound in wild wool to be obtained on such very easy terms,
because sheep, if allowed to run wild, would either degenerate or
perish; but extraordinary facilities for unlimited and almost
costless production interdict large profits; Nature has provided
those facilities; Mr. Macarthur and his followers have taken care
that they shall operate to the utmost, and large profits,
therefore, are henceforth, in my humble opinion, out of the
case.</p>
<p class="foot">[* "At this time" (a sudden and but temporary
demand for mutton having arisen) "many persons considered
themselves fortunate in having an opportunity of diminishing
their flocks, by killing the ewes when heavy with lamb. They
spoke of them as <i>vermin, which, if they were not kept down,
would soon over-run the country</i>. An indiscriminate slaughter
and destruction of stock was kept up during the whole year of
1820; and the people were at last surprised to find that their
flocks were greatly diminished,&mdash;that it was a less evil to
have too much stock than too little,&mdash;and that it would not
be impracticable to exterminate it altogether."&mdash;<i>Account
of Van Diemen's Land by Edward Curr</i>. Page 67.]</p>
<p>If you could procure a conviction for felony in England for
every half dozen lambs that may be dropped here, or for, what
would amount to the same thing, every acre of land granted by the
crown, then, indeed, the increase of people, and of demand for
mutton and wool, would keep pace with production, and the case
would be wholly altered. But where is the use of wishing for
impossibilities? Carefully examine both sides of the question,
and judge for yourself.</p>
<p>A bright thought lately entered my head &mdash;it was this.
Suppose that your Parliament should make it a transportable
offence to contract marriage without a provision for children; *
and that we, in return for the incalculable benefits thereby
conferred upon us, should defray the whole cost of
transportation; would not all parties be gainers by the measure?
You would save nearly the whole amount of your poor-rates, and of
what you must otherwise spend in the prevention and punishment of
crimes dictated by misery; we should gain more millions than you
would save; for, though each unhappy pair should cost us fifty
pounds, their labour and the labour of their children, would
repay us a thousand fold, and the new married convicts, poor
things, whom we should receive with open arms, would be the
greatest gainers of all; as, wanting the means of subsistence,
they would obtain plenty for themselves and a fine provision for
their children. In the penal act suggested it would be well to
insert these clauses:&mdash;1st. Provided that persons
transported as aforesaid, shall , immediately on touching the
shores of Australia, be at liberty <i>to dispose of their labour
to the highest bidder</i>. 2nd. Provided that parties accused of
the offence created by this Statute shall not be prosecuted
<i>without their free consent in writing first had and
obtained</i>. These provisions would take off the seeming
harshness of the law, and would, no doubt, promote convictions;
but it would at the same time be absolutely necessary to forbid
the transports from becoming owners of land. Otherwise, as before
explained, they would not remain labourers, but would become
employers of labourers. What think you of the plan? When I
mentioned it to our Chief Justice, he, thinking I meant to insult
him, coloured up, and said, "are you mad?" I did not answer, but
took comfort, repeating to myself after the Abbé Raynal, "Madmen
sometimes utter words of profound meaning."</p>
<p class="foot">[* <i>Brighton Police&mdash;Present, S. F.
Milford and W. Seymour, Esqrs</i>.&mdash;George Back, attended by
his wife and five small children, requested the bench would order
the overseers to give him some employ, or that his children might
be taken to the poor house. He had applied everywhere, both in
town and country, but could not meet with any employ. He said
that he was willing to work, if he could get any. Mr. Harper, the
assistant overseer, stated that the parish had given the
applicant work; but now, as the time was coming on when work
would be plentiful, the directors and guardians had given orders
that the applicant should seek work. The directors and guardians
could not find work for every applicant all the year round;
besides. Back was not an industrious man; the whole family were
an idle set, and not willing to work. The applicant denied the
charge, which he said might be very convenient. Mr. Harper had
threatened to punish him if he applied to the magistrates for
relief. What was he to do with his family?&mdash;he had tried
every place. Mr. Seymour&mdash;'These misfortunes occur through
the impropriety of poor persons marrying without any thoughts of
how they are to maintain a wife and family. Persons who possess

<div class="insertl">Van Diemen's Land.</div>
<div>The whole of this report applies quite as much to Van
Diemen's Land as to New South Wales. There is a slight difference
of soil and climate between the two settlements, and a certain
difference, of course, in some of the productions for which each
is best adapted. Van Diemen's Land, for example, yields better
apples and wheat; New South Wales superior oranges and maize; but
in point of salubrity there is no difference, and the quantity of
valuable produce to be obtained from any given area is the same
in both places. It is easy to explain why, independently of soil
and climate, this account of one settlement may be taken as a
description of the other. In fact, they are one and the same
colony, peopled by emigrants from the same country; who came here
in the same manner, and with the same dispositions; who use the
same language, obey willingly or unwillingly the same laws, have
acquired the same habits, enjoy the same advantages, feel the
same wants, indulge the same high hopes, and are fated to the
same disappointment. Still, are not these settlements parted by
the ocean? No, they are united by a strait. Water is every where
the best of roads for brining together distant places. Without
the great civilization, of England, London would be nearer to
Hamburgh than to Birmingham. Here, where canals are out of the
question, and where the few roads of which I have boasted are due
entirely to a forced cheapness of labour, now coming to its end,
the operation of water in contracting absolute space is far more
evident than in any part of Europe. The inhabitants of Hobart's
Town and Sydney are nearer neighbours than two families in the
district of Bathurst, who may be separated by only fifty miles of
unreclaimed land. A farmer of Van Diemen's Land sells corn in the
market of Sydney, whilst many a New South Wales farmer grows no
more pom than will supply his family, because he would be unable
to remove a surplus quantity from his own barn. The shopkeeper of
Launceston, again, can sell Chinese goods, obtained from Sydney,
for less than the shopkeeper of Bathurst, who, on the map,
appears nearer to Sydney by some hundred miles. In a word, ships,
and water to float them on, are, to the inhabitants of new
countries, what waggons, carriages, inns, and Macadam's roads are
to you. Believe, then, that New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land
are connected, not separated, by Bass's Strait.</div>
<p>It is true, however, that the English Governors of Australasia
have begun to establish the old-fashioned institution of
coast-blockade in this newest world, and so to convert that
friendly bond, the sea, into a hostile barrier. As if their
subjects were not criminal enough: or, willing, perhaps, that
those who have been brought here by smuggling should resume their
old trade, that they have bestowed upon us a "Commercial System."
One of its provisions deserves to be known. For the declared
purpose of forcing the northern settlers of Van Diemen's Land to
buy and sell at the southern extremity of the island, it has been
ordered that English goods imported from Port Jackson to Port
Dalrymple, shall pay an extraordinary duty; but the object of
this absurd measure has not been attained. The dealers of
Launceston would not travel across the island to deal at Hobart's
Town. They preferred to give something more, and receive
something less, in their own shops. The duty is paid, either to
Government or to the smugglers, and goods are exchanged as
before. The sea, therefore, still enables fellow-countrymen and
brothers, living on either shore of Bass's Strait, to maintain an
intimate connection. And it will continue to perform that office;
for though, no doubt, the duty in question may, for a time,
lengthen the commercial distance between New South Wales and Van
Diemen's Land,&mdash;just as an extra duty on Port wine, imported
any where but at Leith, would lengthen the commercial distance
between Lisbon and Southampton,&mdash;still men die, and their
absurdities perish; whilst the principles of reason and justice
are eternal, and the world's knowledge of them increases from day
to day.</p>
<p>Why am I so angry with our rulers for treating these districts
of Australasia as "natural enemies?" Because I am an apostate
from their view of the subject. I did not think of pulling the
mote out of their eye till I had cast the beam out of my own. On
my passage to this place, by way of North America, I built many
castles in the air. I then intended to settle in Van Diemen's
Land, because I fancied that its insular position and small
extent would render it, not merely foreign, but also superior, to
New South Wales. All the land, thought I, in that beautiful
island will soon be appropriated. The people will increase
rapidly, and will be unable to spread. The proportion between
people and territory will be like that of an old country. Labour,
therefore, will be plentiful, and, perhaps, even cheap; at least,
there will not be a scarcity of dear labour. Division of labour
will follow. That will cause, as, indeed, nothing else can cause,
great production. Wages being moderate, the employer of labour
will take a large share of a great produce. This will cause
accumulation; and the accumulated produce of labour is wealth.
Wealth will bestow leisure; and leisure will bestow knowledge.
Wealth, leisure, and knowledge mean civilization. Schools and
colleges will be established. The arts and sciences will
flourish, because artists and discoverers will be paid and
honoured. Abstract truth will be sought, because its pursuit will
be rewarded; and this will make philosophers. A little island of
the Southern Ocean will produce painters, sculptors, poets,
orators, and friends of mankind. A nation will be born free,
under a clear sky, and will be highly instructed. Being a new
people, they will reject the prejudices, whilst they improve the
accumulated knowledge, of other worlds; and, at length, it will
be fairly decided whether or not man can reach perfection.</p>
<p>Moreover, my estate of ten thousand acres will yield a rent of
ten thousand pounds a-year!</p>
<p>This was my foolish dream. Its basis was delusion, which
vanished in America. I became acquainted with a citizen at New
York, whose eldest son was still a youth at college. The father
wished that his boy should continue to study for three years
longer, and it was proposed that he should afterwards visit
Europe, to gather knowledge that might make him useful to his
country. The stripling was in love with a neighbour's daughter,
and not much inclined to study. He asked his father's leave to
marry and become a man; that is, to make nails for his coffin, by
making children whilst yet a child, and to smoke, drink rum
before breakfast, and choose a side in the paltry, but violent,
party politics of the state. The father objected, mentioning the
affectionate reasons that weighed with him; and the son asserted,
what in America is called the dignity of human nature, by
departing with his neighbour's daughter, and settling in the back
woods, twelve hundred miles from home. Afterwards, on the banks
of the Illinois, I met with a labouring man, who was always tipsy
without ever being drunk. Enervated by dram-drinking, he had not
the courage to obtain a bit of forest and settle; but he could
earn seven shillings a day by his labour. When I spoke to him, he
complained of low wages. "At New York, friend," said I, "five
shillings a day are thought quite enough." "I know that," he
answered,; "I was born there, and came here to get eight
shillings a day, which, I was told, was the lowest rate
hereabouts." It turned out that he never worked more than three
days in the week, and that, in order to obtain twenty-four
shillings a week by three days' labour, he had made a circuitous
voyage of some thousand miles from the place where he was born,
and where he could have earned thirty shillings a week by working
every day.</p>
<p>These and many similar instances of the migrating habits of
the Americans, opened my eyes. I saw a people without monuments,
without history, without local attachments founded on impressions
of the past, without any love of birth-place, without
patriotism&mdash;unless men constantly roaming over immense
regions may be called a country. I saw Europeans, the only
visitors at the grave of Franklin, and heard Americans titter at
Englishmen for admiring the other founders of America. I learned
that, with a new people, restlessness is a passion, insatiable
whilst any means of indulging it remain; a disease, incurable but
by cutting away its source. "What a blessing," I exclaimed, "for
the present race of Americans, if the Pacific should overflow all
the land that separates it from the Mississippi!" And then it
occurred to me that my hopes of Tasmania were a dream, which
could not come true, unless the rest of Australasia were
swallowed by the sea. What had been my delusion? I had fancied
that the waves which surround Van Diemen's Land would prevent its
inhabitants from spreading; and that <span class=
"a">concentration</span> would produce, what never did, and never
can, exist without it&mdash;<span class="a">civilization</span>.
I know, now, that it is easier to migrate from the coast of Van
Diemen's Land to the Southern and Eastern coasts of Australia,
which present a line of many thousand miles, than from some
interior parts of the island to others not fifty miles distant. I
believe, therefore, that New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land
are one and the same colony, and that they will become, at the
same time, districts of one and the same country, remaining
equally barbarous till the year 3000, and becoming afterwards
equally civilized, if the world should last so long.</p>

<div class="insertl">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Influence of
Transportation<br>
on Colonial Manners<br>
and Habits.</div>
<div>Why then do I remain here, my only stake in the country
being those 20,000 acres, which are not worth staying for? I will
tell you presently. There are few pictures without a bright side;
but first let me shew you the whole dark side of this one.</div>
<p>You will not accuse me of underrating the value of convicts.
To make it impossible, however, I once more declare my belief
that this is a flourishing settlement, merely because it is a
Penal settlement, and that it would immediately fall into a state
of torpor and insignificance, if your Government should abandon
the system of transportation. That system, indeed, is itself a
system of colonization; and as colonization means the creation
and increase of every thing but land, where there is nothing
except land, any system, provided that colonization must be
pursued at all events, is surely better than none. Where else, in
modern times at least, has colonization been pursued with any
kind of system? Still the system is full of evil. So long as the
whole colonial population consisted only of criminals and their
keepers, there was no ground for complaint; because, though the
keepers had not committed felony, they were not obliged to live
with felons unless they liked it. But the case 19 now greatly
altered. I say nothing of those Englishmen who wilfully migrated
to a penal settlement; and it is of no importance, therefore,
whether or not the British Government encouraged them to settle
here. But they brought children with them; they have produced
children here; convicts also brought and have produced children;
and the native Australasians form the cream, the flower of the
colony. Not one of these either is a felon, or could have avoided
living amongst felons. They were born, every one of them, with
the very same rights as belong to native Englishmen, and they
have done nothing to forfeit any of those rights. Is not an
Englishman's first right equality before the law? But if the law
should direct all rogues convicted in Yorkshire to be
domiciliated in Kent, would not the Men of Kent complain, and
with truth, of a shameful violation of their
birth-right?&mdash;Of course; but the cases are not parallel,
unless we suppose the Men of Kent to bear as small a proportion
to the' inhabitants of Yorkshire as that of the native
Australasians to the whole people of Britain. It would be just to
drive one man mad by passing a rail-road close to his study, in
order that the numerous inhabitants of two towns should exchange
their wares somewhat more quickly; the few, in short, must suffer
for the good of the many.&mdash;The maxim is a good one, but not
applicable to this question, unless we first prove that it is
impossible to serve the many without injuring the few. If the two
towns could be accommodated by passing a rail-road any where but
close to the man's study, it would be cruelly unjust to drive him
mad. Now, nothing can be more evident than that British criminals
might, for all British purposes, be transported to parts of
Australasia where there are no British subjects to
injure.&mdash;Yes; but then the greater expence of fresh
establishments?&mdash;That might be a question of fact; but admit
the fact, and allow also, that in order to save the pockets of
the many, it is just to inflict a great moral injury on the few;
still, what if the moral injury must necessarily descend to the
successors of the few; and if it be certain that the injured
will, in time, acquire a numerical proportion to the benefited,
such as to throw the words few and many out of the argument? What
if, in the case of the rail-road, it were sure that the studious
man's madness would descend from him to a number equal to the
inhabitants of both towns? In that case, clearly, the injury must
not be done.&mdash;But the constant influx of criminals into New
South Wales is, though a moral injury in one respect, a great
pecuniary benefit, and in that point of view a moral benefit,
because wealth is the parent of civilization.&mdash;Let us not
confound the past with the present, much less with the future.
The effect of penal slavery in producing wealth must, as has been
already explained, depend altogether on the proportion of cheap
slaves to the employers of slave-labour. If, henceforth, convicts
shall be fairly divided amongst all who want labourers, they will
not confer wealth upon any man. If they should be unfairly
distributed by favour, so as to bestow upon a few persons only
the means of wealth, that would not be a general benefit; and
such partiality would be injurious, in another light, by causing
furious ill-will amongst the colonists. It follows that to
domiciliate the criminals of Britain amongst those British
subjects not criminal, who reside in Australasia, is unjust and
wicked, provided the system be calculated to do the latter and
their posterity a great moral injury.</p>
<p>That the system abounds with evil it will not be difficult to
establish.</p>
<p>In the first place. The insecurity of life and property that
it occasions is a manifest evil. Bush-ranging is a dreadful evil,
being a kind of land piracy. None but back settlers, it is true,
are exposed to its burnings, rapes, and massacres; but these are
as much British subjects as the inhabitants of Sydney or of
Downing-street. And, if the inhabitants of towns escape those
horrors, they are liable to be murdered in a quiet way, and their
property is exposed to every kind of depredation. Their actual
losses by robbery, including the expence and loss of time
occasioned by prosecutions, are very great.</p>
<p>Secondly, The population not legally criminal, is corrupted by
the constant example of crime, and the frequent sight of bloody
punishments. What sense of right can children acquire, where
villainy is the rule, and honesty the exception; where they must
needs associate familiarly with depraved men and women, who use
every art to convert them to vice; where law has no moral force;
where general opinion favours the criminal; where to break the
law is a merit, and to elude its grasp an honourable achievement;
where, above all, human beings are continually hanged in rows, as
cattle are slaughtered in the French abattoirs? Is not this an
evil?</p>
<p>Thirdly, Convict labour being a kind of slavery, the employer
of convicts is a species of slave-driver, and his children are
little slave-drivers. As his slaves have more rights and more
reason than the black slaves of Virginia, his position is more
injurious to his character than that of the Virginian
slave-owner. Unless you are a natural devil, you can treat your
horses and dogs without cruelty; but if those brutes should
acquire some of the rights and reason of men, they would make a
devil of you in spite of your natural good temper. You may kill
them now without hindrance or punishment;&mdash;therefore you
never think of such a thing; but if they could complain of you,
and get you punished, for beating them, or for giving them too
little oats and tripe, you would often long to kill them, and you
might gratify your wish by a safe, legal, slow-torture process,
far more cruel than the pole-axe and the rope. God help the poor
horse whose master returns to it, in his own snug stable, after
being fined under Mr. Martin's Act for beating it in public! The
Guardian of Slaves at the Cape of Good Hope, reports "instances
of ill-treatment, which may be ascribed to a tendency in some
parts of the slave population to acts of insubordination,
arising, perhaps, from an erroneous idea respecting the rights of
the master, the intention of the Government in the appointment of
a Guardian, and the nature of the protection to be afforded by
that officer." Of course! To place men in the situation of
cattle, with rights, reason, and a guardian, was to increase the
quantity, though it might alter the character, of the sufferings
which they endured whilst they remained nominal men, but real
cattle. One can imagine a kind master of downright slaves; but to
drive men, half slaves and half freemen, <i>must</i> make the
driver a brute. Here, also, we have guardians of slaves. But our
slaves have more rights and more intelligence than those of any
other colony. There is more "insubordination," consequently, on
the one hand, and on the other, more fear. Apply to the well
known character of a Virginian planter an extra dose of those
qualities which spring from quarrelling and terror, and you will
see that the injury done to the character of the master by our
slave system, is quite perfect. Is not this a great evil?</p>
<p>Fourthly, The base language of English thieves is becoming the
established language of the colony. Terms of slang and flash are
used, as a matter of course, everywhere, from the gaols to the
Viceroy's palace, not excepting the Bar and the Bench. No doubt
they will be reckoned quite parliamentary, as soon as we obtain a
parliament. It is common to reproach the Americans with having
departed from the language of their ancestors; but the fact is,
that most of the words which we suppose them to have coined, are
current, at this day, in different parts of England, Dear old
Franklin tried in vain to establish the best English in America.
Had he lived till now, experience would have taught him that,
whilst, in old countries, modes and manners flow downwards from
the higher classes, they must, in new countries, ascend from the
lowest class. Though in England the son of a costermonger may
become a peer, the individual donkey-driver cannot-whereas a
great portion of the magnates of Australasia not only may, but
necessarily must, have formed, in their own persons, part of the
dregs of society. Hence, bearing in mind that our lowest class
brought with it a peculiar language, and is constantly supplied
with fresh corruption, you will understand why pure English is
not, and is not likely to become, the language of the colony.
This is not a very serious evil; and I mention it only to
elucidate what follows.</p>
<p>Fifthly, The system of transportation is establishing, along
with a base language, and in the very same manner, a general
habit of drunkenness. No wonder that some Americans should have
formed "Societies for the suppression of Dram-drinking." But will
their exertions prove successful, whilst modes and manners
continue to flow upwards to, instead of downwards from, their
proper source? The actual source of the drunken habits which
brutify this people is your St. Giles's; and the foul stream is
constantly maintained by you. What need I say more, after
noticing that the temperature of this part of Australasia is like
that of the countries for which Mahomet legislated?</p>
<p>Lastly, The transportation of at least ten males for one
female, maintains a great disproportion between the sexes. This
is the greatest evil of all. If I hate any thing, it is Cant. And
I should think it impertinent to obtrude upon any one my notions
of individual morality. But this is a great public evil; and in a
public sense, I have a right to speak of its consequences with
indignation. The subject, however, is a grave one, and shall be
treated gravely. Know then, that, in this British colony, open,
naked, broad-day, prostitution is as common as in Otaheite. Are
there not societies in England, which have expended millions in
sending men and books to the heathen? Why do not they send some
women to this abandoned community of their fellow Christians? Are
not those devout persons surrounded by unfortunates, who become
prostitutes for want of bread? Tell them that, here, prostitution
is owing solely to the want of women, and that there is abundance
of bread for any number of poor creatures that they might
mercifully send to us. Tell them, moreover, that if they will
equalize the sexes, we offer a husband, plenty, and a virtuous
life, to every one of the miserable beings whom they may
charitably withdraw frow sin and misery. Can they, though, be
ignorant of the depravity that reigns here? For what do they
combine and subscribe? For the promotion of religion and morality
all over the world! And are they not intimately acquainted with
the vices of savages in obscure regions, to which none but their
own active missionaries can penetrate? If you think that they do
not know the condition of these their fellow subjects, inform
them of it. Tell them in plain terms, so as to leave them without
the excuse of ignorance, that every female child in this colony,
not defended by parents of some influence, is sure to be hunted
by a dozen roaring lions, and that her destruction is almost
inevitable; that the frequency of early corruption has already
established a general license of manners; that mothers are not
ashamed to sell their own daughters, even before the young
creatures know what chastity means; that husbands make a market
of their wives; that early prostitution occasions barrenness; and
that the origin of all this evil&mdash;the inequality of the
sexes&mdash;is partly maintained by the evil itself.</p>
<p>Do they imagine that the evil may be cured otherwise than by
equalizing the sexes? Would they make prostitution a legal
offence? Would they put an end to the general corruption of
females, by restraining and punishing incontinence? Let them
beware! Let them first consult some captains of men-of-war, or
his Majesty's Secretary of State for the Colonies, who, if truly
informed of the moral state of this people, will tell them, for
God's sake, to beware! It is a fact, a miserable truth, that the
most virtuous and sensible of the Colonists are fain to rejoice
at every addition to the class of prostitutes; at every sale,
that is, of a female child by her own parents, of a wife by her
own husband; at the earliest possible destruction of innocence;
at the greatest possible female corruption. Good and wise men,
they choose the least of two dreadful evils. Can it be true that
this colony is within the jurisdiction of an English bishop, and
that we have a body of regular clergy, with many other Christian
ministers, not wanting in zeal? Yes, this is true; and yet habits
are taking a firm root amongst the people, which must gradually
become indigenous, national; and which, in time, may not leave
ten righteous to save the city. Blame neither the clergy nor the
people. Blame the system, which leaves not even a choice of
evils, but decrees, as plainly as ever cause produced effect,
that either evil can be less, only as the other is greater; and
that, in whatever proportion to each other, both shall, by the
force of example and habit, increase with the increase of people,
notwithstanding the ultimate removal of the original cause.</p>
<p>Do you doubt the fact, because it is not reported in published
accounts of the colony? Remember that hitherto the proportion of
cheap slaves to their employers has conferred wealth upon the
latter; that every employer of labour longs within the most
selfish recesses of his heart, for an increase in the amount of
transportation, and loudly expresses his dread lest the parent
Government should disgorge its criminals on any shore but this.
Can human nature be so base? Look at home. How many English
farmers do never secretly wish for rain after their own crop is
housed? How many English landlords abstain from supporting the
Corn Laws, which, by rendering bread scarce, fill hospitals and
gaols? If this fact had been brought before the English nation,
if they had been told that they are creating from their own loins
a nation of Cyprians and Turks, they might have disposed of their
criminals in some other manner. And was it to be expected that
the colonists should, as they term it, "cut their own throats,"
by asking to be deprived of their only means of wealth? If you
still want a reason for the silence of colonial writers, remember
who they are. Are they not colonists? could you expect them to
disparage their country?</p>
<p>For my part, having inherited what is wealth to me, I, though
a colonist, have no interest in the maintenance of penal slavery;
and I had rather serve, than flatter, my adopted country. If
there were a reasonable prospect, or only an even chance, that
the evil would wear itself out, the least knowledge of the world
must dictate silence; but will not the future be an aggravation
of the present? Recollect what has been said of language and
drunkenness; that laws are mere words unless upheld by opinion;
and that habit is a second nature. If, again, the evil were
incurable, the least share of discretion would command silence;
but it is caused solely by an extreme disproportion between the
sexes, which has been caused, and is now maintained, by the
British legislature! You cannot recall the past; but you must
deplore the present, and you may controul the future. A law of
your parliament is opposed to the laws of nature&mdash;repeal it,
and we are saved. If you do not, at least, modify it, so as to
give us, with the poison, a partial antidote&mdash;that is, fewer
men or more women; you will surely (and this is no anti-climax),
hear again and again of the intolerable subject.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, if General Murray should be Colonial Minister when
you receive this, find your way to his closet. Repeat to him my
earnest, though too feeble, complaint. He is a man of business,
and will hear you. He is a man of the world, and will understand
you. He is a reasonable man, and will not deny that such causes
must produce such effects. He is a statesman, and will
acknowledge the injustice of inflicting so many curses upon any
body of his master's equal subjects. He is a brave man, and will
not hesitate to probe the wound. He is a gallant gentleman, and
will pity this young race. He is an eloquent man&mdash;perhaps he
will undertake their cause. He must be capable of generous
emotions, or he could not shine as an orator; if, in this case,
he should give way to the noblest feelings of his heart, millions
yet unborn will have to bless his name.</p>
<p>I have done with the dark side of the picture.</p>

<div class="insertl">Position of<br>
Australasia.</div>
<div>Just before I embarked at Plymouth, I visited my
grandmother, in order to take leave of her for ever. Poor old
soul! she was already dead to the concerns of this life; my
departure could make but little difference in the time of our
separation, and in regard to her affection for me, it could be of
no importance to her which of us should quit the other. My
resolution, however, revived for a day all her woman's feelings.
She shed abundance of tears, and then became extremely curious to
know every particular about the place to which I was going. I
rubbed her spectacles whilst she wiped her eyes, and having
placed before her a common English chart of the world, pointed
out the situation of New Holland. She shook her head. "What
displeases you, my dear Madam?" said I. "Why," she answered, "it
is terribly out of the way&mdash;down in the very right hand
corner of the world." The chart being mine, I cut it in two
through the meridian of Iceland, transposed the parts laterally,
and turned them upside down. "Now," asked I, "where is England?"
"Ah! boy," she replied, "you may do what you like with the map;
but you can't twist the world about in that manner, though they
<i>are</i> making sad changes in it."</div>
<p>Enough of my grandmother.&mdash;But, notwithstanding the great
increase of knowledge which she deplored, English people
generally do consider New Holland "terribly out of the way." Out
of the way of what? Of England? Yes; but is every part of the
world a pleasant or hateful residence, only according to its
facilities of communication with England? Any people, no doubt,
must be the better for communication with the most civilized
people in the world; but the degree of intercourse between
nations is not entirely regulated by distance. Indeed; distance
has very little to do with it, as appears by comparing the case
of France and Spain, with that of England and India. Perhaps, if
there were no restrictions on trade, the greatest difference of
temperature, which involves considerable distance, would cause
the greatest degree of intercourse, by means of the greatest
difference of production, and the greatest motive for exchange.
But, however this may be, I suspect that those who despise New
Holland on account of its being out of the way of England, would,
if they could be forced to think on the subject, acknowledge that
they do not mean exactly what they say. Comparing the inhabitants
of Pest, for example, with those of Calcutta, they would see that
wealth and civilization are not measured by the longitude from
Greenwich; and a glance at Loo Choo might convince them, if
Captain Hall was not deceived, that happiness does not depend on
geographical position with respect to England. But, without
inquiry, a moment's reflection would lead them to use other
words. They do not mean, though they say so, out of the way with
respect to England, but positively out of the way&mdash;that is,
isolated and distant from the rest of the world&mdash;"down in
the corner," as my grandmother said. This old woman's notion
appears to arise from confusion of ideas. Because New Holland is
more distant from England than some well-known distant places,
the vulgar suppose that it must also be more distant from those
places. Whereas the very contrary is the fact; the distance of
those places from England placing them near to New Holland. There
is a great difference, in short, between looking <i>to</i> a
place and looking <i>from</i> it; and my grandmother thought
there was no difference. Now the situation of a country is of
importance to those who live in it, rather than to those who do
not; and the former also will, looking from the country, make the
truest estimate of what good or evil may belong to its position
with respect to other countries. Call upon your imagination,
therefore. Fancy yourself here. And for fear of my grandmother's
"down in the corner," look at a globe, or divide a chart of the
world, transposing the parts laterally, but without turning them
upside down.</p>
<p>Where is England? Up in the left-hand corner&mdash;And New
Holland? Let an English writer answer&mdash;"In order to obtain a
connected view of the loftiest and most extensive system of
mountains upon the globe, we must suppose ourselves placed in New
Holland with our face turned towards the north. America will then
be on the right, Asia and Africa on the left. From Cape Horn to
Behring's Strait, along the western coast of America, there is an
almost uninterrupted range of the highest mountains; from
Behring's Strait again, succeeds an enormous line passing in a
south-westerly direction through Asia, leaving China and
Hindostan to the south, somewhat interrupted as it approaches
Africa, but still to be looked upon as continuing its course in
the mountains of Persia and Arabia Felix. From Cape Gardafui, in
Africa, to the Cape of Good Hope, there appears to be a chain
which completes the view. The series of mountains which we have
thus followed, is in the form of an immense irregular curve,
which comprises within it the Pacific and Indian Oceans, with
their innumerable islands, besides a portion of Asia, including
China, the Burman dominions, and the Indian peninsula." The
situation of New Holland with respect to this "immense irregular
curve," is like that of the frog of a horse's foot to the outline
of the shoe; the most favourable position imaginable for
intercourse with all that the curve contains. Remark, also, that
Australasia has a territorial line of above eight thousand miles,
immediately connected by water with those numerous countries, of
which, again, nearly all the rivers flow towards a common centre,
which is New Holland. Add to this, that those countries comprise
not only every degree of latitude, north and south, as far as
land extends, but the most fertile, and, above all, the most
populous regions of the earth. Thus it becomes evident that
Australasia, instead of being positively "out of the way,"
offers, all at once, better means and greater motives, for a more
frequent intercourse with a greater variety of nations and a
larger number of people, than any other country without
exception. But what avails this super-excellent position, unless
there were civilized men to enjoy it? Let us see whether the
country be capable of supporting a numerous population.</p>

<div class="insertl" style="margin-left:3%;">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Capacity of Australasia<br>
for supporting a dense<br>
Population.</div>
<div>Our knowledge with a view to this question is very confined.
Except of Van Diemen's Land, New South Wales, and a small part of
the western coast of Australia, nothing is known but from the
reports of shipwrecked sailors or nautical surveyors. Even the
latter, when they examine an uninhabited country, have little
opportunity, and are seldom in a fit state of mind, to observe
usefully for any but nautical purposes. The greatest of them all
passed some time close to the noble harbour of Port Jackson
without discovering it; and he represented as the best situation
for a town on the eastern coast of Australia, what turns out to
be one of the worst. Cook, being a great man, was master of his
own mind; but how many explorers of unknown regions have had
their spirits, either over-excited by novelty and the pride of
conquering so many difficulties, or else depressed by long
anxiety, the gloom that surrounded them, and the uncertainty of
their return to the haunts of men! How many quite ordinary
places, in various parts of the world, accordingly, have been
described either as Eldorados or Hells upon Earth! All the early
explorers of Australasia were of the melancholy class. They told
of nothing but horrors&mdash;horrid winds, horrid currents,
horrid deserts, and more horrid savages. We are not to wonder,
therefore, that no attempt was made to form settlements in the
country till a hundred and seventy years after its discovery.
Later voyagers have expressed themselves little more favourably
of the spots at which they touched. The French, in particular,
seem to have been almost as much terrified as the Dutch, who,
during two previous centuries, could meet with nothing, but
horrors; and modern English navigators have rather confirmed than
contradicted the gloomy tales of their predecessors. Upon the
whole, if we had no other knowledge of this country but what may
be gathered from the reports of sailors, we should believe it to
be a hell upon earth.</div>
<p>We have, however, some other knowledge. A good portion of
Eastern Australia has been thoroughly examined by men whose
researches were not confined to the coast, who were glad to find
the country thinly peopled, and with whom "plenty of fresh water"
was not, as it is with the sailors on desert coasts, a ruling
idea. Experience, in a word, has proved New South Wales to be as
habitable as any country in the world. Van Diemen's Land, also,
which was represented by the French as a dreary mass of rocks, a
butt to the storms, and a breaker to the waves, of the Southern
Ocean, where&mdash;</p>
<p class="poem">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; "winds
tumultuous flew;<br>
Forth burst the stormy band with thundering roar,<br>
And heaps on heaps the clouds are tost before;<br>
To the wide main then stooping from the skies,<br>
The heaving deeps in watery mountains rise"&mdash;</p>
<br>
<p>turns out, to those who live there, a very quiet, comfortable
island, not less suited to be the abode of man than the most
fortunate department of France. Lastly, a part of Western
Australia, which, by the French again, as well as by the Dutch,
Portuguese, Spaniards, and English, was described as subject,
like Van Diemen's Land, to the most dreadful storms, and as
presenting a mass of mere sand-hummocks; having at length been
carefully examined by a landsman, appears, as he says, "superior
to any land that he ever saw in New South Wales east of the Blue
Mountains, not only in its local character, but in the many
existing advantages which it holds out to settlers." I do not
vouch for the accuracy of Mr. Frazer's report, though I believe
that it will be verified by the experiment now in progress. If
the emigrants to Cockburn Sound should soon be over-supplied with
mere food, (which, without slaves, either black or white, is the
utmost that they can expect,) the reports of ages will be
falsified in a third instance, and we shall have another motive
for judging of the unsettled parts of this country, rather by
analogy than by the statements of coast surveyors.</p>
<p>Pursuing the former method, referring to countries of a
corresponding latitude in both hemispheres, and to what is
established beyond a doubt as to New South Wales and Van Diemen's
Land, may we not conclude that Australasia, generally, is capable
of supporting a dense population? I do not pretend to decide the
question, and your means of judging are almost equal to mine.
Consult your maps and books, therefore, and judge for yourself. I
venture, however, to recommend, that whilst studying the subject,
and particularly when reading works that treat of this country,
you bear in mind the following considerations:&mdash;</p>
<p>1. The line of heat is two or three degrees north of the
equator; consequently, our tropic corresponds with a line by so
much north of yours.</p>
<p>2. A high temperature and great humidity of <i>soil</i> seem
to be incompatible with health.</p>
<p>3. Countries having a very dry soil, and reckoned amongst the
happiest spots on the globe, receive a greater quantity of rain
than some countries where few days pass without rain. In the
course of a year, for instance, more rain falls in New South
Wales than in England.</p>
<p>4. Most of the European and Asiatic countries, lying between
the latitudes 25° and 45°, which correspond with the
extra-tropical portion of Australasia, either do actually
support, or have supported, a dense population. Though their soil
be dry and naturally unfertile, it becomes productive through the
skill of man in raising water to the surface, preserving rain
water, and distributing both. Great part of Italy, for example,
would be unproductive, but for wells, reservoirs, and canals of
irrigation; and, in the now desert countries about the Caspian
Sea, where the remains of cities abound, ruined wells, tanks, and
aqueducts, prove that, until the people perished through moral
causes, they were preserved by their skill in the management of
water.</p>
<p>5. Englishmen being used at home to consider water an enemy,
and to exercise much skill in getting rid of it, are ignorant of
the means by which, in countries where the sun exerts great
power, water becomes the first agent of production. When an
Englishman, therefore, laments over the blasting effects of
drought in New South Wales, he should be reminded that in Italy,
Greece, and Asia Minor, "the dry season" is the season of
vegetation. But it is not owing to their ignorance only that
Englishmen in New South Wales have neglected the management of
water. It is owing, principally, to the scantiness of their
number in proportion to the soil at their disposal. Where
labourers are scarce, it must be impossible to form reservoirs
and aqueducts; and where scarcity of labourers is occasioned by
excess of territory, it would, also, be useless to do so. Why
should we exert ourselves to cultivate the sandstone district
near Sydney, whilst there is, at a distance, unappropriated land
naturally productive? If fifty thousand acres of the now desert
land near Sydney could be removed, and attached to the coast of
Genoa, they would soon produce rich harvests; but we are not to
blame for our neglect of what would be so much prized in Europe.
All I wish you to remember is, that, though what has occurred
here proves a good deal, it has not by any means proved the
utmost capacity of this part of Australasia to support a dense
population.</p>
<p>6. Partly from ignorance, and partly from necessity, the
cultivators of New South Wales have failed, in another respect,
to give their soil a fair trial. They are still bent upon growing
English wheat, though experience might have satisfied them that
the soil and climate are not agreeable to it. The consequence is
that they often complain of bad harvests. Probably, if the
Neapolitan territory were depopulated, and given to Englishmen,
they would sow wheat rather than maize, and plant gooseberry
bushes rather than vines and fig-trees. But time would instruct
them; and, if it did but increase their numbers so as to permit
the employment of many hands in one fields it would re-establish
those productions which, in Italy, maintain a dense population,
notwithstanding the curse of bad government. So, in time, though
it is impossible to conjecture at what time, the inhabitants of
New South Wales will sow and plant with a view to obtain the
greatest possible produce from a given space. Then, but not till
then, experience and analogy will enable us to estimate with
confidence the utmost number of people that the whole country may
be capable of supporting. By then, however, the point will be
absolutely decided; for no part of this country can become
densely, whilst any part shall remain thinly, peopled.</p>
<p>On this interesting question I now leave you to speculate for
yourself. Why does not a second Volney migrate to a New America,
and furnish to the other worlds a philosophical account of our
soil and climate? Europe, at least, would reward his labours. But
as it matters little that a country should support many people if
they be physically worthless, you must want some account of the
influence of our soil and climate on the offspring of British
emigrants. This will bring me to the promised chapter upon
"Currency Lasses."</p>
<br>

<div class="insertl">Currency Lasses.</div>
<div>That low-lived Englishman who, in the pride of his John Bull
breed, and of his condition as paymaster to an exiled marching
regiment, distinguished the Emigrant from the Native population
of New South Wales, by nicknaming the one Sterling, and the other
Currency, was, no doubt, a man of taste, according to his station
and habits. Colonial money being at the time below par with
reference to British money, he intended to depreciate the Native
colonists with reference to true-born British colonists; as if,
forsooth, there were a pin to choose between colonists, in point
of rank. But, probably, he was an admirer of cherry cheeks,
purple arms, thick legs, and a nutmeg-grater skin, in the one
sex, and of bulk, high cheek-bones, and red whiskers in the
other&mdash;all characteristic, perhaps, of the regimental
paymaster and his tramping wife. If so, no wonder that he should
think meanly of the Native Australians. But, if an Englishman of
refined taste had been compelled to express his opinion of the
two races by terms signifying measures of value, he would, I
believe, have given the higher denomination to the Australians,
who, as they differ from a vulgar Englishman's idea of
perfection, approach to that of Flaxman and Byron.</div>
<p>"Tous les goûts sont dans la nature; celui qu'on a est le
meilleur." In English, "every one to his taste, as the old woman
said when she kissed her cow." Nevertheless, in spite of the many
proverbs which declare that there is no standard of taste, the
same human form which more than two thousand years ago was
embodied by Phidias and Praxiteles, is still considered the model
of perfection by all refined Europeans. Where does that form most
commonly breathe? In Greece, and even in the very Cyprus, where
Adonis was conceived, and where the Goddess of Beauty had two
temples. You may laugh or sneer; but the latitude of Sydney
corresponds exactly with that of Paphos; and it is no less true
that the native Australians bear a stronger resemblance to the
modern Greeks than to any other people. They have been described
as lank, sallow, and relaxed, like the Americans; but I have seen
the Apollo and the Venus, some thousands of breathing Greeks, and
some millions of Americans; and I assert the description to be
false. The Australian youth are neither chubby, ruddy, and
strongly knit, like the English, whose otherwise variable climate
is almost constantly wet; nor fat, white, thick-skinned, and
shapeless, like the Dutch, whose climate is one fog, dripping or
frozen; nor indescribable, like the mongrel French, whose climate
is neither one thing nor the other; and they are still less like
the Americans, whose climate, more variable than that of England,
is always in extremes, blowing burning hot and biting cold with
the same breath; but they resemble the Castilians, the sea-coast
Italians, and more especially the island Greeks, which last
enjoy, like them, perpetual summer upon a soil not alluvial.</p>
<p>As to form and mien you shall judge for yourself. The young
men of Australia, like Alfieri and Mr. Hope's Modern Greeks are
passionately fond of horses. If you would see one of them, look
in Flaxman's illustrations of the Iliad, at the figure of Diomed
returning with the spoils of Rhesus. The Australian girls, like
the girls of Genoa, Naples, and the Archipelago, are passionately
fond of swimming. If you would see a group of them, look at
Flaxman's sea nymphs obeying the command of Thetis&mdash;</p>
<p align="center"><small>"Ye sister Nereids, to your deeps
descend."</small></p>
<p>But Flaxman's outlines represent only form and mien. How shall
I paint the rest? As for the young men, I cannot help feeling
envious and jealous of their personal beauty: so I shall not
mention it again; and you may fancy what you please, or get a
woman of observation to take their picture for you. But the
girls&mdash;oh! that is quite another thing; and I will write for
my own pleasure, whether you read or not. And let me ask, by the
bye, whether, if the women of a country be generally beautiful,
the men, likewise, will not be handsome? Why is the highest class
in England better looking, than the others? Because, I imagine,
it obtains a constant accession of beautiful women;&mdash;men of
rank having the largest choice, and marrying to please their
eyes; whilst young men of wealth, aspiring to rank, marry girls
of condition, the daughters of beauty, and of rank, whose mother
was beauty. Thus, not only does the highest class pick out the
beauties of two or three classes, but it also keeps its own
beauties. Supposing you to agree with me that both sexes of the
English highest class, do generally excel in person both sexes of
the other classes, it would seem to follow that if the female
colonists, generally, are beautiful, beauty in both sexes will be
a colonial attribute. However, infer what you like. Here is the
fact.</p>
<p>You remember that Genoese girl before whom you trembled, and I
became faint, though she only handed us some grapes. Do you
remember that, having recovered ourselves, we measured her
eye-lashes? Do you remember how long they were, and how she
laughed? Do you remember that bright laugh, and how I patted her
cheek, and told her that it was softer than her country's velvet?
And how she blushed&mdash;do you remember that?&mdash;to the tips
of her fingers and the roots of her hair? And then how
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; do you remember how, peasant as she was,
and but just fifteen, she tossed her head, and stamped her little
foot, with the air of a Queen? And then how, on a sudden, her
large eyes were filled with tears; and the grace with which she
folded her arms across that charming bosom; and the tone&mdash;I
hear it now&mdash;the deep, grave, penetrating tone in which,
half angry, half afraid, she at once threatened us with her
"Berto," and implored our respect? We did not care much for Mr.
Berto, certainly; but did we not swear, both together, that not a
hair of her head should be hurt? And when, flattered by our
involuntary devotion, she departed with a healthy lively step,
shewing her small smooth ancles, and now and then turning her
profile to us, and laughing as before&mdash;did we not, dashing
blades as we thought ourselves, snuffle and blow our noses, and
shake hands without the least motive, like two fools? And
afterwards, notwithstanding that gratuitous fit of friendship,
did we not feel jealous of each other for three days, though
neither of us could hope to see the little angel
again?&mdash;Yes, you remember it all. Well, just such another
girl as that brings fruit to my door every morning.</p>
<p>I do not pretend, however, that all the girls of Australia are
equally beautiful; but I do declare, what you know to be true of
the Ligurian girls, that three out of four of them would be
considered beauties in Mayfair. The cause&mdash;what is the
cause? As you love a reason for every thing, I will state my own
notion on the subject.</p>
<p>It was after you left me in Italy that I passed a miserable
winter at Turin, amongst one of the ugliest races of women in the
world. In March, whilst the plain of the Po was still covered
with deep frozen snow, and all things above the snow were
enveloped in dense, chilling, choking fog, I removed to Genoa.
The old track over the Bochetta, by Gavi, was then the only road
across that part of the Appenines; and that track led over the
narrow top of the highest ridge, so that three turns of a wheel
earned the traveller from the climate of the Baltic, as it were,
to that of the Mediterranean. The contrast was most delightful,
not to the sight only, but to every one of the senses. Instead of
only some yards of snow and fog, I beheld, suddenly and at one
view, a long range of mountain steps clothed with vegetation,
partly of the dark evergreen, partly of the bright green of the
spring; and, winding through those wooded hills, the narrow vale
of Polcevra with its clear stream and brilliant gardens; and,
beyond these, Genoa the Magnificent, with her light-house, domes
and marble palaces, glittering in the sun; and last, the
Mediterranean itself, rising, apparently to me who looked down
upon it, into a huge bank of blue, which formed the back ground
of the picture. Was, not this a sight for eyes just thawed?
Instead of a cold, damp, motionless atmosphere, I breathed highly
rarefied air, and felt the soft breeze pass over my face. I
listened, doubting; but it was true&mdash;the music of the
chestnut groves had begun. Presently there were violets by the
road side; and at Campo Marone, the first post-house on the sunny
side of the Appenines, I received strawberries from a group of
girls, with bare arms and necks and fresh flowers in their hair.
I was mad with animal joy. Even my English servant (the same who
is now an Australian Aristocrat) felt the genial change. Though
morosely glum by nature, he played some monkey's tricks, ogling
the strawberry girls and pulling the postilion's tails, before my
face. And, though anything but a beauty, his stubborn features
expanded with happiness, which makes every animal comely after
its kind. In the very act of admiring him I discovered why the
Genoese are as lovely as the Alexandrians are frightful. I knew,
before, that Alexandria is placed in a swamp between the Alps and
the Appenines; that, consequently, its inhabitants are frozen in
winter and stifled in summer; and that at Genoa the air, never
very cold or very hot, always circulates freely; and I had
imagined that this great difference of soil and climate must
cause the great difference of person. But I still wanted to know
the process by which soil and climate deform or beautify the
human creature; and it was this that I learned by observing the
friskiness of my valet. The Alexandrians suffer from their birth
many inconveniences, restraints, and even torments, which the
Genoese escape. They feel, therefore, a greater quantity of pain;
or, in other words, the Genoese enjoy more happiness. If the face
is the mirror of the mind, the whole form may be an index of the
habits. Happiness includes animal liberty, and misery includes
restraint. Whatever the human variety, a face of joy and a form
of ease make the perfection of beauty; whilst general deformity
is the type of suffering and constraint. As we feel and act
continually, so shall we appear. Thus, after all, soil and
climate may produce beauty or ugliness by a moral rather than a
physical process. What think you of my invention? Apply it to the
Australian girls. If you should find in it a reason for their
loveliness, I shall not have digressed. Would that all men might
adopt the theory; as, in that case, every admirer of beauty, must
be a warm philanthropist! The first division of the theory,
however, is not new, but very old. The supposed influence of soil
and climate on happiness, without reference to beauty, gave a
name to this Fortunate Isles. Why should not this ill-named part
of Australasia be called Australia Felix? Allowing that soil and
climate produce beauty by means of happiness, still the character
must, in a great measure, depend on original causes strictly
moral. The disposition of a people will be governed by their
condition; and their condition again will, in most cases, be
ordered by their laws. This Colonial Government, though
necessarily bad, is far superior both to the late oligarchy of
Genoa, and to the actual despotism of Carlo Feroce. In one most
essential point, it is greatly superior to the government of
Britain. Able to increase its territory according to the increase
of its people, it avails itself of that mighty advantage; and
thus, by the most gentle laws, forbids the existence of Want. If
to do what is here so easy deserve the least praise, how might
the government of Britain be blessed for finding means to do
what, there, would be so large a good! But let us proceed. The
Australian youth suffer none of the evils of poverty. It follows
that what may be called their natural character is excellent. The
young men are gay, high-spirited, impetuous; brave even to a
fault; that is, wanting in discretion; yet, at times, when with
their parents, gentle and affectionate&mdash;when with their
mistresses, tender and passionately amorous. The girls are
lively, imaginative, enthusiastic, and very&mdash;very loving;
yet, until hunted down, as before stated, modest as girls can be.
Both sexes have a strong capacity for knowledge; and I observe in
them a certain natural refinement of mind, like that which
distinguishes a Greek Peasant from a Dutch Mightiness. In shorty
they resemble the modern Greeks, mentally as well as bodily. A
Triple Alliance offers to Greeks the means of exerting their
capacity for all that is great and good. Shall British laws
forbid this young race of British Subjects to eschew evil and
cultivate good&mdash;to escape from that moral debasement which,
wherever it occurs, is due rather to bad laws than to the nature
of things? Answer that question, proud Englishman!</p>
<p>Having answered it, you may laugh at my admiration of these
despised colonists; and you may, if you like, sneer at my
enthusiasm in their cause. But I have written as I believe and
feel; I do admire and love them; and I hope to live and die
amongst them, besides serving them, to the best of my poor
ability.</p>
<p>I will continue nevertheless, to scribble with the
impartiality of a cosmopolite. It is true that many of the native
Australians lose their teeth at Ian early age. This is an ill
truly American; and it is produced in both countries, I believe,
by the very same cause or causes. Volney, a man of taste as well
of deep research, was educated for the practice of physic. Being
most kindly disposed towards the Americans, apd shocked at the
state of their mouths, be gave himself the trouble to inquire,
and to tell them, not only why their teeth decayed so early, but
also how that sickening evil might be avoided by future
generations. He shewed that the disease is not strictly endemial,
but that it arises from the excessive use of animal food and
strong drinks, in a climate not adapted to such gross sustenance.
His view of the subject is founded, in part, upon a survey of
human habits from the Equator to the North Pole. The nearer
people live to the sun, the less animal food, and the less animal
fat especially do they consume. The Esquimaux, who live as far as
possible from the sun, breakfast, dine, and sup upon
bears'-grease and blubber; whilst the northern nations are
remarkable for their love of strong spirituous drinks, and for
the impunity with which they swallow enormous quantities of them.
To gormandize flesh and to guzzle strong drinks is the mark of an
Englishman all over the world. These habits are not destructive
to the teeth of English people; but the descendants of English
people in America lose their teeth. The descendants of Spaniards
and Portuguese in America, who are temperate in eating and
drinking, do not lose their teeth. Hence, it is inferred that the
English Americans owe the loss of their teeth to the intemperance
which they have inherited from their ancestors and ours.</p>
<p>So far Volney. But gormandizing and guzzling are habitual only
to certain low classes of English people-to every class below,
and including the highest that delights in goose, sausages, and
pork chops. Why did the Americans adopt, and why have they
preserved, these baser English appetites, rather than those
which, now at least, belong to the upper classes in England?
Because emigrants to new countries are of the gormandizing and
guzzling classes; and because, in new countries, tastes and
habits, as well as modes and manners, must necessarily proceed
from the lowest class. The Americans scorned the friendly
suggestions of Volney; as now, they glory in some of their worst
defects, like the beast who, being reproached with the dirty
state of his hands, said, "Dirty&mdash;oh! you call that dirty,
do you? I wish you could see my feet." But what else could be
expected? It is not as to their teeth only that the American
people, as has been said of Russian Nobles, become rotten before
they are ripe; and by such a people advice will always be
received with scorn,&mdash;unless it happen to flatter their
prejudices, in which case, though of course the advice of an
enemy, it will be implicitly followed.</p>
<p>So it is here, only, I mean, as to the decay of teeth; for at
present this is not a people, but merely a colony of low-bred
English. I attribute the loss of teeth which disfigures so many
of the colonials, youth, entirely to their low English habits of
eating and drinking. Some of them have adopted habits more
suitable to the climate; and these have generally beautiful
teeth. Amongst them is the girl before, mentioned. She has sound,
strong, white, separate teeth, like those of a young dog fed upon
oatmeal; and her breath is sweet, as that of a sucking donkey.
Feeling deeply upon this subject, I have taken pains to ascertain
what has been the ordinary food of those young people, who are
remarkable for very good or very bad teeth, and the result of my
inquiries is a conviction that gross English feeling under a
Neapolitan sun, if steadily pursued from infancy to puberty, will
spoil nine mouths out of ten. I also believe, of course, that
this, the worst Americanism that has, as yet, crept into the
colony, may be eradicated. If you come here, you will, I trust,
join me in a crusade against gormandizing and guzzling. What
think you of sending to Naples for a dozen foundling children;
six of whom we might feed on vermicelli, polenta, fruits and
water; and six upon melted butter, lard, dripping, suet, fat
mutton, roast pork, ducks, geese, pork sausages, hams and bacon;
with ale, porter, stout, brandy, rum, gin, hollands, whiskey,
shrub, and other cordial compounds of essential oil? The
experiment would probably be conclusive of the question; and in
that case, though somewhat cruel apparently, it would, in truth,
be a large humanity. I know not how we could invest a little
money more for our children's advantage. But do not imagine that
I have a greater affection for those colonists who have good
teeth than for those who have none. When on ship board with
women, we pity those who suffer more than those who escape; and
pity is akin to love.</p>
<p>My determination to tell you the whole truth has compelled me
to speak evil of the Australians after I had, as I thought just
now, finished the dark side of their picture At length you have
both sides of it, and I shall describe no more. But my residence
in this miserable place has compelled me to think, for want of
something else to do. Of course I have thought principally of
this place and this people; and it was but natural that I should,
in theory at leasts search after means for improving the place
and mending the people. Whether it be possible to do so, is a
question that I do not pretend to decide; but here follow my
bumble reflections on the subject. If you should think them
worthy of the least attention, make what use of them you please.
If not, throw the remainder of this letter into the fire.</p>

<div class="insertl">A New People.</div>
<div>What are the ideas that we mean to express by the words a
<i>New People</i>? Do we mean simply a people little advanced in
civilization? Certainly not; as we do not apply the terms either
to the Russians, or the Turks, or the Irish, or even to the
Hottentots. Do we mean any body of people that emigrates from an
old country, and settles permanently at a distance from it?
Certainly not; or the Portuguese inhabitants of Goa, and the
Dutch settlers in Java, would have been called a new people,
which they never were called; and the English who will settle in
Hindostan, as soon as the India Company's Charter shall expire,
would be called a new people, which they never will be called. Do
we mean a people who remove from cultivated to uncultivated
regions, and settle permanently in the latter? Certainly not; or
the inhabitants of Petersburgh and Odessa would be called new
people. Do we mean a people who migrate from an old country and
settle permanently elsewhere, forming from the day of their
settlement an independent State? Certainly not; for all that we
know of the wealthy, accomplished, and refined founders of
Syracuse, Agrigentum and Ephesus, is quite at variance with what
is now meant by a new people. What then do we mean? We mean, it
strikes me, a people like what the Canadians will be, and the
United States' Americans are&mdash;a people who, though they
continually increase in number, make no progress in the art of
living; who, in respect to wealth, knowledge, skill, taste, and
whatever belongs to civilization, have degenerated from their
ancestors; who are precluded from acquiring wealth except by the
labour of slaves; whose education, though universal, stops before
the age of puberty, and thus becomes, if not an evil, at least a
dangerous thing, instead of the greatest good; who, ever on the
move, are unable to bring any thing to perfection; whose opinions
are only violent and false prejudices, the necessary fruit of
ignorance; whose character is a compound of vanity, bigotry,
obstinacy, and hatred most comprehensive, including whatever does
not meet their own pinched notions of right; and who delight in a
forced equality, not equality before the law only, but equality
against nature and truth; an equality which, to keep the balance
always even, rewards the mean rather than the great, and gives
more honour to the vile than to the noble. We mean such a people
as would despise the memory of a Washington, and quote his
elsewhere honoured name only to justify the keeping of slaves. We
mean such people as would invent and cherish an American Tariff,
a second Spanish Code of the Indies immediately after the council
of the Indies had been virtually dissolved for ever, and after a
Vansittart had been reasoned down, in the mother tongue of
America, by a Smith, a Malthus, a Ricardo, a Mill, and a
M'Culloch. We mean, in two words, a people who become rotten
before they are ripe.</div>
<p>It follows that we do not say what we mean. By the word new,
we do not express newness either as to settlement or as to
independence; for, according to our sense of the word, the
Canadians will probably be a newer people fifty years hence than
they were fifty years ago, and the United States' Americans are a
newer people now, in 1829, than they were in 1779. We mean, then,
something quite independent of time and of connection with a
mother country. What can it be? Something not plainly
attributable either to the Russians at large, or the Turks, or
the Irish, or the Hottentots, or to the Portuguese Indians, or to
the Dutch Javans, or to the future Anglo-Indians, or to the
inhabitants of Petersburgh and Odessa, or to the ancient Greek
colonies. What can it be? It must be something peculiar to those
whom we call new people-to the Americans, Canadians, South
Africans, and Australasians. And what is that something, but an
excess of territory in proportion to inhabitants?</p>
<p>That this is what we do mean will become more apparent by
reference to the change that has taken place in the condition of
the Spanish Mexicans since their independence. Considering that
whilst dependent they laboured under many terrible evils, such as
the Code, of the Indies and a powerful established superstition,
their progress towards a ripe state of civilization (as described
by Humboldt) was superior to that of the Anglo-Americans at the
same period. For two reasons they could not spread so easily as
the North Americans; firsts because the Mexican Indians are less
easily displaced than those of British America; and secondly,
because the Spanish Government discouraged agriculture, and threw
many obstacles in the way of gaining a property in waste land.
Hence, though the Mexican territory was in fact enormous in
proportion to the people, still that disproportion did not
operate to its fullest extent, and the Spanish Mexicans enjoyed,
politically, a proportion between people and territory something
like that of old countries. By their independence they have
escaped civil, religious and commercial bondage; but they have
acquired the power to spread at will. Does not their present
Tartar state seem to decide the question?</p>
<p>But this question is too important to be settled by me. Though
it appear to regard only the meaning of a word, it cannot be
decided without stating why half the world is in a barbarous
condition. Let us, therefore, consult authority. From every book
that treats of what we call "new countries," it would be easy to
quote numerous passages illustrating my view of the subject. I
have selected five; and the names of their authors will secure
your attention.</p>
<p>First, Adam Smith,&mdash;in quoting whom I take the bull by
its very horns; for he argues in favour of excess of territory.
In his "Inquiry into the Causes of the Property of New Colonies,"
he writes&mdash;</p>
<p>"The colony of a civilized nation, which takes possession,
either of a waste country, or of one so thinly inhabited that the
natives easily give place to the new settlers, advances more
rapidly to wealth and greatness than any other human society. The
colonists carry out with them a knowledge of agriculture and of
other useful arts, superior to what can grow up of its own accord
in the course of many centuries among savage and barbarous
nations. They carry out with them too the habit of subordination,
some notion of the regular government which takes place in their
own country, of the system of laws which support it, and of a
regular administration of justice; and they naturally establish
something of the same kind in the new settlement. But among
savage and barbarous nations, the natural progress of law and
government is still slower than the natural progress of arts,
after law and government have been so far established, as is
necessary for their protection. Every colonist gets more land
than he can possibly cultivate. He has no rent, and scarce any
taxes to pay. No landlord shares with him in its produce, and the
share of the sovereign is commonly but a trifle. He has every
motive to render as great as possible a produce, which is thus to
be almost entirely his own. But his land is commonly so extensive
that, with all his own industry, and with all the industry of
other people whom he can get to employ, he can seldom make it
produce the tenth part of what it is capable of producing. He is
eager, therefore, to collect labourers from all quarters, and to
reward them with the most liberal wages. But those liberal wages,
joined to the plenty and cheapness of land, soon make those
labourers leave him, in order to become landlords themselves; and
to reward, with equal liberality, other labourers, who soon leave
them for the same reason that they left their first master. The
liberal reward of labour encourages marriage. The children,
during the tender years of infancy, are well fed, and properly
taken care of; and when they are grown up, the value of their
labour greatly over-pays their maintenance. When arrived at
maturity, the high price of labour, and the low price of land,
enable them to establish themselves in the same manner as their
fathers did before them. In other countries, rent and profit eat
up wages, and the two superior orders of people oppress the
inferior one. But in new colonies, the interest of the two
superior orders obliges them to treat the inferior one with more
generosity and humanity; at least, where that inferior one Is not
in a state of slavery. Waste lands, of the greatest natural
fertility, are to be had for a trifle. The increase of revenue
which the proprietor, who is always the undertaker, expects from
their improvement, constitutes his profit, which, in these
circumstances, is commonly very great. But this great profit
cannot be made without employing the labour of other people in
clearing and cultivating the land; and the disproportion between
the great extent of the land and the small number of the people,
which commonly takes place in new colonies, makes it difficult
for him to get this labour. He does not, therefore, dispute about
wages, but is willing to employ labour at any price. The high
wages of labour encourage population. The cheapness and plenty of
good land encourage improvement, and enable the proprietor to pay
those high wages. In those wages consist almost the whole price
of the land; and though they are high, considered as the wages of
labour, they are low, considered as the price of what is so very
valuable.&mdash;What encourages the progress of population and
improvement, encourages that of real wealth and greatness. The
progress of many of the ancient Greek Colonies towards wealth and
greatness, seems accordingly to have been very rapid. In the
course of a century or two, several of them appear to have
rivalled, and even to have surpassed, their mother cities.
Syracuse and Agrigentum in Sicily, Tarentum and Locri in Italy,
Ephesus and Miletus in Lesser Asia, appear by all accounts to
have been at least equal to any of the cities of ancient Greece.
Though posterior in their establishment, yet all the arts of
refinement, philosophy, poetry, and eloquence, seem to have been
cultivated as early, and to have been improved as highly, in
them, as in any part of the mother country. All those Colonies
had established themselves in countries inhabited by savage and
barbarous nations, who easily gave place to the new settlers.
They had plenty of good land, and as they were altogether
independent of the mother city, they were at liberty to manage
their own affairs in the way that they judged was most suitable
to their own interests."</p>
<p>In the above passage, of which the object is to account for
the very rapid acquisition of wealth by emigrants from the states
of Greece, five main causes are stated&mdash;knowledge of
agriculture and other useful arts; freedom from taxes;
independence, from the beginning; cheapness of land; and dearness
of labour. But the statement, when examined, will appear very
objectionable, both in fact and in reasoning. The Emigrants from
Greece did <i>not</i> obtain immense tracts of waste land, over
which they and their children might spread at will. There is not,
I believe, an instance of their having advanced far into the
interior of any country. Wherever they landed they had to
displace warlike tribes, who, abandoning the sea coast after a
struggle, continued to watch the intruders and to confine them
within very narrow limits. The first occupation of a Greek Colony
seems to have been to erect a fortress, into which the whole body
of colonists might retire in case of need. Some of these strong
places became, in a very short time, splendid cities; but the
quantity of land required to maintain the inhabitants of one
great city, formed, in most cases, <i>the whole territory of a
Greek Colony, from the beginning to the end of its career</i>.
Abundance and consequent cheapness of land, therefore, were not a
cause of the rapid prosperity of the Greek Colonies. In the next
place, high wages&mdash;dearness of labour &mdash;assuredly had
no part in their rapid advancement. For, besides that high wages
could have arisen, only in the manner so well described by Dr.
Smith, from superabundance of land, the Colonists carried with
them, and obtained after their settlement, numbers of slaves, who
were their principal, if not their sole, cultivators and
artizans! Lastly, it may be denied that the complete independence
of a Colony from the beginning is by any means advantageous; for,
however ill dependent Colonies have been governed after they had
arrived at some importance, they have generally received nothing,
in their first beginnings, but protection and assistance from the
parent States under whose dominion they remained.</p>
<p>If these objections to the facts and reasoning of Dr. Smith
are not unfounded, but two out of the five causes assigned by him
can be admitted&mdash;knowledge of agriculture and other useful
arts, and freedom from taxes. These, by themselves, are surely
quite inadequate to the effects for which he endeavour, to
account. May not other causes be assigned?&mdash;I imagine
four:&mdash;</p>
<p>First-The constitution of the emigrating body. The leaders of
bodies of emigrants from Greece were men of the highest
distinction, whose fame, ability and wealth enabled them to
collect and transport a great number of followers, drawn from all
ranks in the old State. Thus a body of Colonists formed, not a
new society, in the common acceptation of the term, but an old
society that had changed its abode. Secondly&mdash;The new abode
was not an immense waste, without inhabitants, over which the
colonists might spread themselves, remaining for ages a scattered
people, without that concentration in any thing, which in almost
every thing is the essence of power. Thirdly&mdash;The narrow
limits of territory in proportion to people, together with the
institution of slavery, rendered labour cheap instead of dear.
Hence the profits of stock, to use a modern term, were large;
wealth rapidly accumulated; and it was easy for the new society
to erect fine buildings&mdash;to create very rapidly a city
rivalling their parent city. Fourthly&mdash;As the portion of
produce which falls to the land-owner&mdash;in modern language,
rent&mdash;is small or great, according as people are few or many
in proportion to territory, and as the leaders of the new society
were the owners of a limited territory, they possessed, either at
once or very soon, the riches and the consequent leisure
wherewith to cultivate 'all the arts of refinement, philosophy,
poetry, and eloquence.'</p>
<p>In the same chapter Dr. Smith endeavours to account for the
less rapid progress of the American Colonies, in comparison with
those of Greece, by dwelling on the evils of dependence; and he
frequently repeats that settlers in America were enabled to
prosper, in spite of dependence, by reason of their excess of
territory in proportion to the people; which advantage, he says,
they possess in a greater degree than emigrants from Greece.</p>
<p>This doctrine may be submitted to the test of facts. The
United States of North America have for some time enjoyed
complete independence. Their inhabitants pay no tithes and but
few taxes. Land may still be obtained almost as easily, and
labour is still quite as dear, as when those States were founded.
Their population equals, probably, that of Great Britain and
Ireland at the time when Dr. Smith wrote. A constant influx of
emigrants from Europe, the press, and great improvements in
navigation, have placed at their disposal the accumulated, and
always increasing knowledge of the old world. Their soil is
naturally fertile, and their climate is more favourable to varied
production than that of Britain. Their mineral productions are
little inferior to those of Britain. Their magnificent rivers
afford natural means of communication infinitely superior to
those of any European State: and the people are hardy, brave,
active, intelligent, enterprising and extremely ambitious.
According to Dr. Smith, therefore, they ought by this time to
have rivalled at least, if not to have surpassed, their parent
state in wealth and greatness. Yet look at their condition. Their
metropolis is not to be compared to many of the mere
pleasure-towns of England. Want of capital prevented the State of
New York from commencing its great Canal from Lake Erie until
long after the profit of that undertaking had been demonstrated;
and other States are now attempting to raise money in London for
great works, which cannot be undertaken unless capital be
obtained from the parent country. In the useful arts, excepting
only, perhaps, that of steam-navigation, they are far behind the
parent country. Their manufactures, miserable at best, exist only
through restrictive laws. If in the fine arts there arise amongst
them a man of ability, he hastens to Europe for patronage and
profit Their best writers live in France and England, because
America offers no rewards for success in literature. Their
cleverest mechanics bring their skill to the rich market of
Europe, because in America skill is less valuable than strength.
Their boasted naval power is held as a mere boast by those who
know that they are positively unable to man as many ships as
constitute a fleet; and all the arts of refinement, philosophy,
poetry and eloquence, are more largely and successfully
cultivated in the narrow space that is covered by the sea-port
town of Liverpool, than throughout the extensive regions of North
America. Thus the doctrine of Adam Smith concerning the effect of
cheap land and dear labour, in producing national wealth and
greatness, has been refuted by the safest of all arguments-an
ample experiment Doubtless, the people of America are laying a
most extensive foundation of future wealth and greatness&mdash;of
a national greatness surpassing any that has occurred in the
world. They are spreading over such extensive regions, that, if
they do but preserve their integrity, they must, whenever they
cease to spread, acquire an unexampled degree of national wealth
and power. But at present, and until they can no longer spread,
they are, and must remain &mdash;like children acquiring the
means of knowledge by learning to read&mdash;an infant people,
acquiring only the means of future wealth and greatness.</p>
<p>Secondly. Washington, writing to Arthur Young, says, "An
English farmer ought to have a horrid idea of the state of our
agriculture, or the nature of our soil, when he is informed that
an acre with us only produces eight or ten bushels. But it must
be kept in mind that, where land is cheap and labour dear, men
are fonder of cultivating much than cultivating well. Much ground
has been scratched, and none cultivated as it ought to be."</p>
<p>Land is not the only thing, which, for the reasons given by
Washington, the Americans have only scratched instead of
cultivating.</p>
<p>Thirdly. Humboldt, describing the province of Vera Cruz, says,
"A small number of powerful families, who live on the central
table land, possess the greatest part of the shores of the
intendencies of Vera Cruz and San Luis Potosi. No Agrarian law
forces these rich proprietors to sell their Mayorazzos, if they
persist in refusing to bring their immense territories under
cultivation."</p>
<p>In this case, good seems to have come of evil. The Spanish
government granted away the shores of Vera Cruz and San Luis
Potosi in a manner tantamount to the annihilation of those
fertile districts, and there were wealthy persons on the table
land. But if the shores of the Mexican Gulf had been scratched,
would the Mexican table land have been well cultivated? The ghost
of Washington would say, No. If, in all things but barbarism, yon
prefer scratching to cultivating, read no more. What says a
spirit akin to that of Washington?</p>
<p>Fourthly. The Abbé Raynal: "Louisiana would not, probably,
have languished for so long a time, had it not been for an
original error adopted <i>in granting lands indiscriminately to
every person who applied for them, and in the manner in which he
desired them</i>. Immense deserts would not have separated the
colonists from each other. Being brought near to a common centre,
they would have assisted each other, and would have enjoyed all
the advantages of a well-regulated society. As population
increased, the lands would have been cleared to a greater extent.
Instead of a few hordes of [French] savages, we should have seen
a rising colony, which might in time have become a powerful
nation, and procured infinite advantages to France."</p>
<p>Fifthly. A writer in <i>The Edinburgh Review</i> (No. 92): "We
have never heard it surmised that a gradual change from slavery
to freedom has been a disadvantage to any country, or to any
individual; and it is impossible that it should be so, if that
change follows in the natural course of things. We have next to
consider what would have promoted, or what has retarded, this
change, and why this natural course of things" (the gradual
extinction of slavery by means of free labour) "has made so
little progress in the British colonies, or in the United States
of America. In the United States, it is certain that the increase
of the slave population has been in operation, and would have
made men cheap and land dear long before this time, <i>if they
had not been prevented by the boundless extent of new and fertile
land</i>. Thus, when the soils of Virginia had become exhausted
by slave cultivation, (for when men do the work of cattle, and
use little animal food, fertility is not kept up by green crops,
and the soils invariably deteriorate), then the Virginians became
breeders of slaves for sale, and the new and fertile lands in the
South Western States found them an extensive market; In our West
India Islands, again, land capable of cultivation is in limited
extent: and if the slaves in them had increased as in the United
States, and the inter-colonial slave-trade had always been
illegal, or had been effectually prevented, the operation of
natural causes must long since have converted the slaves in most
of the islands into free men. What <i>the boundless extent of
fertile land</i> has done to maintain slavery in the United
States, bounties and prohibitory protections have done in the
British colonies. For it is just the same things whether a bad
system is supported by the abundant productions of a fertile
soil, or by raising the price of the smaller produce, by bounties
and protections."</p>
<p>You are now requested to exert your imagination, and to
suppose that, by some convulsion of nature, or by a law of
Congress, the North Americans were deprived of their "boundless
extent of fertile land." Can it be doubted that, in that case,
they would soon be able to escape all the evils of a new, and to
enjoy all the advantages of an old, people? Would not they be
obliged to concentrate themselves? Would not labour become
plentiful and cheap? Would not many people accumulate wealth, and
many more cultivate knowledge, with a view to wealth? Would not
slavery be gradually abolished, and without loss to the
slave-owners; as the diminished value of slaves and the increased
value of land, would measure each other? Reminding you, in order
to save repetition, of my Tasmanian dream, might not all those
great things which are foretold of America happen within the time
of living men? If you answer these questions in the affirmative,
then you must acknowledge that, by the words, a "new people," we
mean a people who, whether new or old, dependent or independent,
have a capacity for greatness, and yet remain insignificant,
solely in consequence of their excessive territory. Supposing
this point established, there arises a question which appears to
me as important as any that can occupy the minds of reflecting
men. It is&mdash;whether it be possible to devise a faultless
cure for this sort of newness where it already exists, and a
preventative of it as to future settlements in waste
countries?</p>
<br>

<a name="ch-19" id="ch-19"></a>
<div class="insertl" style="text-align:center;">Cure and
Preventative<br>
of Newness.</div>
<div>Does not our inquiry into the causes of the evil point out a
remedy? In all new countries the government alone has the power
to dispose of waste land. Not that a Government would, any where,
prevent the cultivation of mere waste; but nobody would cultivate
without a title; the government alone can give a secure title;
and it is, therefore, impossible to use waste land without the
active assistance of government. Does it not follow that the
government might, by restricting the amount of grants, establish
and maintain the most desirable proportion between people and
territory? The answer appears to me so clear and unquestionable,
that I will not detain you by any argument concerning it. The
proportion between people and territory does, in new countries,
depend altogether upon the will of the government. Every new
government, therefore, possesses the power to civilize its
subjects.</div>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 169}</u></p>
<a name="ch-20" id="ch-20"></a>
<div class="insertl">Restriction.</div>
<div>But supposing the will to exist, in addition to the power,
what would be the proper amount of restriction? An insufficient
restriction would be but a partial good, and an excessive
restriction would produce, more or less, those terrible evils
which, in some old countries, arise from an excess of people in
proportion to territory. Where are we to find the just medium?
The answer appears to me to be plain and satisfactory. As a wise
man eats just as much as will keep him in the beat health, but no
more: so a wise government would grant just enough land to enable
the people to exert their utmost capacity for doubling
themselves, but no more. It is needless to enlarge upon this mere
truism. But the wisest government must have to invent some rule,
by which to measure out the due increase of land according to the
increase of people; for it is not enough to say that the land
ought to be doubled in quantity, as often as the people should
double in number. As the people would increase gradually, so must
the quantity of land be augmented by degrees. How, then, might
the gradual increase of land be so regulated as to be neither
inadequate nor excessive? By, it appears to me, requiring a
payment in money for the title to waste land, that is, by selling
grants of land, instead of bestowing them gratis,&mdash;instead
of persuading people to accept of them. But this is the practice
of the American Government, whose subjects are, nevertheless, as
"new" as possible. True, and what is the inference, but that the
price which the American Government requires for waste land is
too low for the only purpose that calls for any price at all? Now
let us suppose that the American Government should require nine
pounds, instead of only nine shillings, per acre for waste land.
There would be no buyers, you think. Of course not, until the
people had increased so as to render land, already appropriated,
worth more than nine pounds per acre; but then, as surely, there
would be buyers at the lower price. What would happen in the
meanwhile? Why, the very thing of which we are in search&mdash;a
desirable proportion between territory and people. Thus it
becomes dear, that the object in view may be attained by fixing
some considerable price on waste land. Still, how is the proper
price to be ascertained? I frankly confess that I do not know. I
believe that it could be determined only by experience; but this
I do know&mdash;that if nine farthings per acre should check the
natural increase of people, by causing a scarcity of well-paid
employment, it would be too much; and that, if ninety pounds per
acre should not promote the greatest increase of wealth and
civilization, by maintaining a constant supply of the demand for
well-paid labour, it would be too little.</div>
<p>If Johanna Southcote were to rise again, she and one Mr.
Sadler (whose Irish rhapsody is more amusing to me than Win
Jenkins's letters in Humphrey Clinker) would exclaim
&mdash;"What, ask a high price for land where land is worth
nothing at all! How unjust in the name of humanity, and false in
the name of God!" In answer to these profound exclamations, I
would observe, that if your government should discover a mine of
pure gold just under the turf of Hyde Park, and if the quantity
did not exceed a million of ounces, the godsend would pay off
near four millions of the national debt; but that, if the
quantity of gold so found were ten thousand millions of pounds,
none of it would be worth lifting from the earth. If, in short,
gold were as plentiful and as easily obtained as water, no one
would buy gold, and no one would invest capital in the working of
gold mines. But let us suppose that government, discovering ten
thousand millions of pounds of gold, should have the power and
the will to dole it out gradually, supplying every year to the
public a quantity equal to what had been lost by wear and
accidents during the previous year. In that case the mine might,
in time, pay off the whole national debt; that is to say, the
government might every year sell a certain quantity of gold at
the present mint price. So in the case of waste land in new
countries, new governments might, by measuring the quantity
according to the demand, sell that quantity for a considerable
price; but as Mrs. Southcote has not risen again, and it is a
mere waste of time to reason with men like her, let us
proceed.</p>

<a name="ch-21" id="ch-21"></a>
<div class="insertl">Free Migration.</div>
<div>I beg, now, for another effort of your imagination. Suppose
that the American Government had fixed nine pounds per acre as
the price of waste land, and that, consequently, during many
years, no waste land had been purchased; but that the people had
increased so as to raise the price of appropriated land above
nine pounds per acre, and that "the pressure of population" upon
territory had occasioned a brisk demand for waste land at the
government price. All this, as it might surely happen, may be
easily conceived. In this case the American Government would
every year obtain a large sum of money, the produce of the more
divided labour of its less scattered people. What would it do
with this money? Pay off the national debt! Good; but from the
moment that there had occurred a demand for land at the
government price, that demand would, by means of the constant
increase of people, continue incessantly, till all the waste land
of America should be sold. That economical government, therefore,
having paid off its national debt, would still feel the
embarrassment of riches. Let us suppose that, not content with an
increase of American-born subjects, at the rate of doubling in
twenty-five years, and a similar geometrical spread of
cultivation, it should employ its surplus wealth in obtaining a
foreign addition to the population. Let us suppose that it should
provide a free passage from all over-peopled countries to
America, for all who might be tempted to exchange starvation
wages for those ample wages which, it is taken for granted, would
still prevail in America. What! all who should arrive? If every
poor English and Irish family could obtain a passage to America,
millions upon millions might emigrate, and the American
government might not be able to fulfil its engagement with those
poor people. Its funds might be exhausted, and it might be unable
to pay the shipowners for bringing the emigrants. Not so, I
think. The sole motive for emigration from Britain would be the
higher rate of wages in America. If, therefore, the emigrants
should press too hard upon the accumulation of American capital,
wages would not be high, but low; and immigration would cease
until a fresh demand for labour should arise. And this seems
quite clear&mdash;that the more British paupers should labour and
rear children in America, the greater would be the amount of
American wealth, of the demand for waste land, and of the funds
to provide for further immigration.</div>
<p>What think you of the scheme? I trust, at least, that it will
set you a thinking. But it contains one manifest flaw. Great part
of the good to America, and all the good to Britain, that its
adoption in practice might bestow, must be deferred until the
domestic population of America should attain such a proportion to
the land already granted, as would raise the average price of
land above nine pounds per acre. So immense is the actual
disproportion between people and granted land, that very many
years must elapse before its removal by the increase of native
Americans. These would be years of hope deferred. Would it be
possible to skip over them and to seize all the good at once? I
humbly think it would.</p>

<a name="ch-22" id="ch-22"></a>
<div class="insertl">Anticipation.</div>
<div>Mr. Ricardo's theory of rent is perfectly unquestionable as
far as it goes. But it does not, as I imagine, go far enough to
explain the nature of rent in new countries. In England, the most
fertile land, be it where it may, will let for what is called a
high rent: here the most fertile land will not, unless near a
town, yield any rent at all. But, even in England, fertility is
not the sole criterion of rent; as land near a town will let for
more than equally fertile land situated far from any town. Again,
even in England, land which is in high artificial condition, and
is provided with superior farm buildings, will let for
considerably more than land of equal natural fertility which has
been neglected, and is without the necessary buildings. All I
mean by this is, that in speaking of rent according to Mr.
Ricardo's theory, we are not to attribute to natural fertility
<i>only</i>, what is in fact, <i>partly</i> due to situation and
to the outlay of capital. In England, that part of the rent which
is paid for superior natural fertility only is generally so
large, in proportion to what is paid for situation and the use of
fixed capital, that it may not be worth while to distinguish them
with hair-splitting precision. But here, that is, in all new
countries, the case is quite different. Wherever the most fertile
land can be obtained for nothing, the superior fertility of land
is worth nothing; and whatever is obtained under the name of
rent, is paid <i>solely</i> either for vicinity to markets or as
interest of fixed capital. Now the supposed restriction on the
appropriation of waste land would, as before stated, gradually
raise the average price of appropriated land above nine pounds
per acre. In other words, it would gradually cause appropriated
land to yield a rent in the sense of Mr. Ricardo; it would
gradually create an average rent of (we may suppose with
reference to the supposed market value) seven or eight shillings
per acre, over and above what might be paid for situation and the
use of fixed capital. This would be an enormous benefit conferred
upon the American landlords. They would of course, wish to enjoy
such a benefit as soon as possible. Might they not greatly hasten
its arrival, by engaging to abandon a portion of it, that is, by
submitting to a <i>tax upon rent</i>, and employing the proceeds
of the tax in defraying the cost of foreign immigration? Still,
how could that be taxed which does not yet exist? Answer: first,
from the moment of restriction on grants, appropriated land would
begin to yield some rent, which would increase every year without
any foreign addition to the population; and if a portion of that
rent were employed in promoting foreign immigration, the increase
of rent would proceed more rapidly. Secondly, the produce of the
tax (the tax being so much per cent. upon the rent actual and
future) would increase with the increase of rent. Consequently it
might be anticipated, just as now the American Government could
readily anticipate the taxes of customs and excise. Indeed, we
may suppose that it would be more readily anticipated than those
taxes; for though all governments profess to employ the proceeds
of loans for the good of the country, that is for increasing the
security of the lender, still loans are often unproductive of
advantage to any but those who spend them, and sometimes
mischievous to all other persons; whereas, in the supposed case,
the money raised on the security of a future tax must necessarily
and immediately be employed in raising the value of security,
that is, in augmenting the number of people and increasing the
amount of rent. If, however, this excellent security should not
prove sufficiently tempting to capitalists, the government might
add to it the future proceeds of sales of land, the amount of
which would be increased by every loan, exactly as in the case of
rent. Supposing both rent-tax and the proceeds of sales to be
thus mortgaged, the power of anticipation would be used to the
utmost; and the final object, the great good in view, would be
attained at a period proportionably early.</div>
<p>Apply this theory of Restriction, Anticipation, and Free
Migration, to the case of Britain and her colonies in South
Africa and Australasia. Here, in the South, are boundless regions
wanting people; there, in the North, are countless people wanting
land. Would not this system of colonization be, in effect, a
bridge, without toll as to the poor, from Britain to Australasia,
touching at the Cape of Good Hope? Remember always that the
greater the number of emigrants from Britain the greater would be
the demand for land at a money price, and the greater,
consequently, would be the means of further emigration. But I
must not repeat myself too often. Let us forget, for a moment,
the astonishing effects of such a system of colonization upon the
colonized countries, and turn to its probable effects on your
over-peopled country.</p>

<div class="insertl">Extension of Britain.</div>
<div>If an Englishman who ardently desires the greatest good of
his country&mdash;Mr. Wilmot Horton, for instance&mdash;were
offered the gratification of one wish, however extravagant, for
what would he ask? For an immense gold mine? For the destruction
of his natural enemies, the French? For an earthquake to swallow
up troublesome Ireland? Oh no! &mdash;for none of these would he
ask. If his character were more remarkable for justice than
humanity, he might, perhaps, be tempted to wish for a
straightforward Catholic Relief Bill; but, on the whole, he
would, I think, wish for the power to increase the territory of
Britain according to the wants of the people. And, in making this
choice of blessings, he would not be actuated by any ambitious
views with reference to the territorial extent of his country.
His sole object would be to put an end to that portion of crime
and misery which in Britain is produced by an excess of people in
proportion to territory; and he would not care, therefore,
whether the increase of territory, having that effect, should
take place near to or at a distance from Britain. Behold, I say
to men of that class&mdash;behold your wish accomplished! Do you
doubt the possibility of so great a good? Let me try to persuade
you that it is within your reach.</div>
<p>Suppose that you had the power to remove any portion of the
waste land of South Africa or Australasia, and attach it to the
coast of Britain. If you were to exercise that power rashly, and
at once to quadruple the territory of Britain, what would be the
consequence? Whatever crime and misery arise from want of
employment would cease; but would not rent cease also? Would not
wealth and civilization perish? Would not Britain, old as she is,
become suddenly a new country? All this assuredly would happen.
How, then, would you exercise your power? Prudently, no doubt,
with a view to cure the evils of excess of people, without
producing the evils of excess of territory. Let us suppose that
you should begin by removing only 100,000 acres of good land,
bearing fine timber, and fix them on the coast of Lancashire;
They would be the property of the Crown. The Crown, probably,
would not give them away. It would sell them to the highest
bidder. They would sell for perhaps £10, or £20 per acre,
according to their natural fertility. Why would they fetch such a
price? Because, becoming part of a densely peopled country, they
would yield a rent proportionate to that market value. In this
supposed case, the Crown would do what it liked with the purchase
money. But, in the proposed case, the purchase money of
additional territory would be employed in increasing the colonial
population-that is to say, in giving to the land purchased a
value like that of land removed miraculously to the coast of
Lancashire. Whether you remove the land to the people, or the
people to the land, makes no difference as to your sole object.
Bearing in mind that the greater the amount of emigration to the
colonies, the more rapid would be the increase of colonial
capital, and the greater would be the demand for more land and
more labour&mdash;that is, for more emigrants, and of the means
of obtaining them&mdash;this system of restriction, anticipation,
and free migration, does offer you the accomplishment of your
wish. The good, therefore, is not the less attainable, because it
would be very great. Nevertheless, this stupendous good must have
a limit as to its duration. Of course it must; because the world
is of limited extent. But, even if a system of free migration
were adopted in all new countries, so as to permit the population
of the world to exert its utmost capacity of increase, still half
a century must elapse before the pressure of population upon
territory would be felt, at the same moment, all over the world;
and perhaps in the course of fifty years we might discover a way
to "new countries" in the moon, or, what appears quite as
difficult, a means of checking population otherwise than by sin
and sorrow.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, though we should always acknowledge our obligations
to Mr. Malthus, for having told us what we had not even guessed
till he wrote&mdash;namely, the precise reasons why some men are,
and ever must be, richer than others; still we might avoid, for a
time, the worst evils of which that eminent philosopher
discovered the causes. This, though but a temporary gain, is
worth the greatest efforts; and Britain might enjoy that good for
a longer period than any other country because she already
possesses the largest extent of waste land, and she might,
perhaps, acquire an exclusive property in more.</p>
<p>As to the immediate operation of this system, one point only
remains to be noticed. Perhaps the capital of all new countries,
put together, is not at present sufficient to afford ample
employment to all the labourers who might be disposed to emigrate
from Britain. If the population of Britain were not at once
reduced sufficiently to put an end to pauperism arising from want
of employment, they might "fill up the vacuum" created by the
emigration of an insufficient number, and might still press hard
upon the distant demand for labour. To check this too rapid
increase of people <i>in Britain</i>, it would be advisable to
select as emigrants young persons only, and especially young
couples of both sexes. The Domestic power of increase would
thereby be greatly weakened, and the Colonial power of increase
would be strengthened in the same degree. The object is, to
reduce, as much as the system would allow, the population of the
emigrating country, and to increase, as much as possible, that of
the immigrating countries. The propriety of such a selection is,
therefore, evident. But there are additional reasons for it.
First, it would prevent, altogether, the evils which, here
especially, and more or less in all modern new colonies, have
arisen from the disproportion between the sexes. Secondly, young
men would be more willing than old ones to make the venture of
emigration; and both young men and young women would prefer
crossing the world in couples, to migrating singly only across
the Channel. Thirdly, young persons of both sexes would most
readily accommodate their habits to a new climate, and embrace
new modes of cultivation and general labour. Lastly, having
families to rear, they would be more industrious than older
poisons, and probably more apt to save a part of their earnings;
whereby they would promote a more rapid increase of colonial
capital&mdash;of the demand for more land and more labour
&mdash;of the demand for more young couples, and of the means for
obtaining them. In a word, they would make the best members of a
new society.</p>
<p>The colonies, however, would no longer be new societies,
strictly speaking. They would be so many <i>extensions</i> of an
old society. Pursue that idea, and you will see that emigration
from Britain would not be confined to Paupers, passing by the
free bridge. We (I speak in the name of the colonists) should
acquire wealth rapidly. Such of us as are landowners must have
good income without trouble; for remember that, though the tax
upon rent would take something from us, it would only take a part
of what it would first bestow! How many ready-made articles, both
useful and ornamental, should we import from England, for which,
now, we have not the means to pay? Let me enumerate a few of
them&mdash;farming bailiffs, surveyors, builders, architects and
engineers; mineralogists, practical miners, botanists and
chemists; printers, schoolmasters and school-mistresses,
booksellers, authors, publishers, and even reviewers; merchants,
to supply us with English goods, and to take our surplus produce;
bankers, underwriters, life-insurers, and clerks innumerable;
actors, surgeons, and physicians; lawyers, clergymen, singers,
music and dancing masters, milliners and other female artists,
and, at least, one good Political Economist at each settlement,
to prevent us from devising an Australasian tariff. Most of these
emigrants would call themselves ladies and gentlemen, and would
object to pass by the bridge of charity. Consequently we could
not force them to preserve an equal sexual proportion; but if an
excessive number of males should emigrate, they would create,
here, a demand for females, and a supply would immediately follow
by the bridge. Moreover, as the value of all land purchased of
the government must necessarily rise somewhat above the amount of
the purchase-money; and as portions, on or near to which towns
would grow up, must rise in value considerably above the
government price, the purchase of waste land would be an
excellent employment of capital. Much of the surplus capital of
Britain, therefore, might be so invested, instead of being given
away to monks in Spain and to Tartars in South America. Some of
the persons, who should invest their money in this manner, would
emigrate along with it, in order to become the leading men of
civilized Australasia. Thus, you see, these colonies, like those
of Greece, would "contain a mixture of all classes of society;"
they would, every day, open new fields to "all trades, pursuits,
and professions," which in England "are becoming more and more
overstocked," and would provide for "multitudes of persons of all
degrees and ages who," in England, "are moving about, without
employment, useless to themselves and a burden to the public." *
In fewer words, every grant of land in these colonies would be an
extension, though distant, of Britain itself, and would provide
so much more room for all classes of Britons.</p>
<p class="foot">[* See Preface.]</p>
<p>You will believe that I have reflected a good deal upon this
subject. Nevertheless, sometimes when I am in a desponding mood,
I exclaim&mdash;But where on earth is all the money to come from,
that is to pay for all the ships employed by this system, and to
confer wealth upon so many of the inhabitants of these extensive
regions? To this, when I feel happy and strong in the force of
truth, I answer&mdash;in the first instance, from places where
the money already exists, but is employed with little or no
profit; and, ultimately, from the divided labour of millions,
who, but for some such permission to labour and multiply, must
either die of slow starvation or would never be born! When I
reflect that all the wealth that the world contains has been
produced by the labour of man, the answer becomes quite
satisfactory.</p>
<p>My castle in the air is finished. View it only as a structure
of the imagination. Still, does its foundation appear solid? Are
its ideal proportions just? Does it seem to unite the chief
properties of a good building &mdash;usefulness, strength, and
beauty? If you answer, yes, then I ask, though this plan be too
magnificent for execution, may we not really construct a smaller
edifice upon this model? In plain English&mdash;if the principles
here suggested be correct, why should they not be reduced to
practice, upon whatever scale?</p>
<p>At any rate, it is worth while to inquire, very briefly, what
would be the probable effects of some such, system, independently
of those considerations which form its main principles.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p class="pagenum"><u>{Page 190}</u></p>
<a name="ch-24" id="ch-24"></a>
<div class="insertl">Convicts.</div>
<div>First. In this colony, convict-labour would no longer be of
the least value to the capitalist. But it does not follow that,
because such a system of colonization would occasion the natural
death of negro slavery in South Africa, it should have the same
effect on penal slavery in Australasia. There could be no
objection to the employment of convicts on various parts of the
coast, at a distance from any actual settlement. On the contrary,
there would be many reasons in favour of it. If good judgment
were exercised in the selection of spots calculated to become
important sea-port towns, the Transports would act as pioneers to
a future army of Emigrants; and when they had paved the way for a
settlement, not penal, they might be removed to other desert
places. In this case, their labour would, of course, be confined
to preparing the settlement for the habitation of better men; and
the penal labourers would be supplied with food from settlements
already not penal. As those purified settlements would produce
abundance of food, the cost of maintaining convicts in desert
places would be infinitely less than on former occasions, when
food was obtained from India and even from England. And their
labour would repay the cost of their maintenance, in this manner.
All the land which they had prepared would be the property of
government The preparation of that land would give it a value
over and above the price of mere waste, as determined by the
general system. Government, also, would have a right to fix the
site of a future town. Much town-land has been sold in New South
Wales at the rate of £500 per acre. As, by the operation of the
general system, half-a-dozen years, probably, would produce a
larger town than Sydney, government would be able to obtain, for
all the prepared land, and especially for the portion destined
for town-land, a price very much above the ordinary price of mere
waste. The excess, whatever it might be, would belong to
government; and it would, I believe, be more than enough to repay
the cost of establishing the settlement by convict labour. But I
must add a condition to this opinion. As, in the case supposed,
government would be a capitalist, employing its money with a view
to remunerating profit, any great want of skill, and especially
of economy, in the administration, would insure loss instead of
gain.</div>
<p>Secondly. Whilst waste land could be obtained at whatever
price, with the certainty of a progressive increase of market
value, colonial capital would naturally be employed in the
purchase and cultivation of land&mdash;in providing subsistence,
that is, for the rapid increase of people which the system of
free migration would occasion. And it is taken for granted that
the rate of wages in the colony (which must be governed by the
price required for waste land) would always be considerably
higher than in the mother-country; because, otherwise, labourers
would not emigrate. It must follow that the colonists would not
be manufacturers of any but those coarser goods, which, on
account of their bulk and weight, might be produced in the colony
for less than the sum of their cost in England and their freight
to the colony. The suggested extension of Britain, consequently,
must cause a great increase of demand for all the finer British
manufactures. I will not weary you with a statement of the
process by which we should pay for those British goods; but you
will remark that, for a long time to come, every Paul conveyed
to, or born in, the colony, would furnish employment to, perhaps,
several British Peters. The quantity of employment so furnished
to British industry would depend upon the degree in which Britain
should be extended; and the degree of that extension would depend
upon the degree of skill and singleness of purpose with which the
system should be administered, together with, of course, the
degree in which births should exceed deaths in this most healthy
country, I am inclined to believe that the population of
extra-tropical Australasia might increase at the rate of five per
cent. per annum, which is the rate of increase in the least
wholesome parts of North America.</p>
<p>Thirdly. There exists in England a pretty general feeling that
colonies, as such, are of no value to the mother country, in any
point of view; and that they are injurious, in one respect, by
the great expense incurred in governing and defending them. Allow
that this opinion is justified by the whole history of modern
colonization, that the mere possession of a "new country,"
"scratched" by a scattered population, is worth nothing, or is
even injurious to the possessor; still, may we not conceive that
colonization, which is pursued now just as it was two hundred
years ago&mdash;that is, without the least attempt at
system&mdash;is as open to improvement as was, fifty years ago,
the carriage of letters? Mr. Palmer's suggestion as to the Post
was adopted at once. Within the last twenty years, the same
number, at least, of plans of colonization has been suggested,
but not one of them has been adopted, or was perhaps worthy of
adoption. There is all the more room for improvement. Now,
according to this last project, the colonists themselves would
defray the whole cost of their government and protection. Suppose
the inhabitants of Van Diemen's Land to be 500,000 instead of
26,000; their labour, their produce and their consumption, would
be, at least, as 20 to 1, and the produce of their taxes,
consequently, would be twenty times what it is at present. We
may, indeed, presume that the produce of 500,000 inhabitants of
Van Diemen's Land, would much exceed twenty times the produce of
25,000 inhabitants; because the different <i>proportion</i> of
people to territory would cause a greater <i>division of
labour</i>, which is the very soul of production. We may presume,
therefore, that any given piece of colony might be as productive
of revenue as a similar piece of mother country, and that it
would pay as well for its own government. I have a suspicion,
however, that after a time the ordinary expense of government
might be defrayed out of the proceeds of rent-tax and sales of
land, without any great departure from the main principles of the
system. That is to say, there might be a constant balance in hand
of the Free-migration Fund, after supplying the colonial demand
for labour; and it would be proper to employ such a balance in
relief of other taxes. Ultimately, as soon as the demand for
British emigrants should cease, the proceeds of rent-tax, which
would, by then, be very great, might defray the whole cost of
colonial government. It follows that, as between the colony and
the mother country, there might be scarcely any commercial
restrictions; and that, as to the colony only, there might be
none at all.</p>
<p>Lastly. Though some of the above speculations may be doubtful,
they might, perhaps, be carried much farther without
extravagance. This, however, admits of no uncertainty either way,
being positive and self-evident&mdash;namely, that the system in
question would tend more than any thing to preserve an intimate
connection between the colony and the mother country. In fact,
the mother country and the colony would become partners in a new
trade&mdash;the creation of happy human beings; one country
furnishing the raw materials&mdash;that is, the land, the dust of
which man is made; the other furnishing the machinery&mdash;that
is, men and women, to convert the unpeopled soil into living
images of God. In this honourable, and, we may say, even glorious
copartnership, the interest of the mother country would be
greater than that of the colony; and a rupture of their
connection would, therefore, be most injurious to the former. If
the system of free migration should be destroyed by a war of
independence, the colony might still pursue the system of
restriction, and so preserve all the desirable attributes of an
old people; but in that case, the mother country would lose a
given portion of the means by which she had enjoyed the one great
good that belongs to new countries&mdash;the power of supplying a
constant increase of territory according to the wants of the
people. The mother country, therefore, in governing the colony,
would consult the greatest advantage of the colonists, in order
to preserve their friendship; and the colonists, having much to
lose, and being incapable of dispersion, would feel a wholesome
dread of war. The colonists, being an instructed and civilized
people, would be as well qualified to govern themselves as the
people of Britain; and, being a wealthy people, they would be
able, without going to war, to assert the birth-right of all
British subjects&mdash;to enforce in the British Parliament,
against a bad British ministry, their claim to equality before
the law. Qualified, entitled, and powerful to govern themselves,
they might either take share in framing the general laws of the
empire, by means of their representatives in the British
Parliament; or, if a mean jealousy on the part of Englishmen
should prevent such an arrangement, they might frame their own
laws, in a Colonial Assembly, under the eye of a viceroy,
incapable of wrong, and possessing a veto like the king of
England, but whose secretaries, like the ministers of England,
should be responsible to the people! At all events, they must be
governed, by whatever machinery, with a view to their good and
their contentment, which is the greatest good, instead of to the
satisfaction at their governors only. This would render them
happy in a most intimate connexion with their mother country; and
the American war of independence would no longer be a favourite
theme in the still dependent colonies of Britain. Mutual
dependence would prevent oppression on the one part, and on the
other, a wish for independence; reciprocity of interest would
occasion mutual good will; there would no longer be injurious
distinctions, or malignant jealousies, or vulgar hatred between
British subjects, wherever born; and Britain would become the
centre of the most extensive, the most civilized, and, above all,
the happiest empire in the world.</p>

<h3>POSTSCRIPT.</h3>
<hr class="2">
<p>Without regard to the excess of people in Britain, and to the
benefits which the mother country might derive from treating her
colonies as so many extensions of her own territory; the mode of
colonization which I have ventured to propose, might, it appears
to me, be adopted in Australasia with infinite advantage to the
colonists, by establishing a free bridge between the settlements
and those numerous over-peopled countries, by which they are, as
it were, surrounded. Many of the islands of the Pacific Ocean
have a superabundant population, who, constantly exposed to the
want of food, would rejoice to emigrate to this country and to
supply our urgent want of labourers, if we did but offer them a
free passage and plenty to eat. The British dominions in India
might afford us a much larger supply; for though, hitherto, the
Hindoos have been disinclined to emigrate, the most careless
observer must see that a great moral revolution has commenced in
British India, that the obstinate prejudices of ages are there
beginning to disappear, and that but little management would be
required to induce the poorest class of Hindoos to labour and
enjoy in Australasia, rather than drown their children in the
sacred stream, or die of misery near their own temples. But the
Chinese, especially, who with a population of 300,000,000, feel
the pressure of people upon territory more than any other nation
whatsoever,&mdash;who are greatly disposed to emigrate,&mdash;and
who are, by far, the most industrious and skilful of
Asiatics&mdash;might, not only supply the want of labourers now
felt in the British Australasian settlements, but they might, in
the course of a century, perhaps, convert the whole of this
enormous wilderness into a fruitful garden. This last proposition
must, I know, appear extravagant to him who thinks old times and
old ways the best, and who considers novel and visionary as
synonymous terms. Even to him I would recal the migrations of the
northern hordes; who, in no very long period of time, overran the
most fruitful regions of Europe, and kept possession of them
notwithstanding vigorous opposition. To others, to those who
believe that mankind is in a state of progressive improvement,
and who, instead of only inking their heads, heartily rejoice at
every useful novelty, whether mechanical, moral or political, I
offer the following evidence in support of what I have asserted.
But, first, let me remind you once more, that, according to the
proposed system of colonization, the amount of colonial capital,
in other words, the demand for waste land and for emigrant
labourers, as well as the means of free migration, must increase,
continually, with the increase of immigration, until all the land
shall be appropriated and cultivated. Supposing new settlements
to be made on the southern, north-western, northern, and
north-eastern coasts of Australia, the demand for emigrant
labourers and the means for supplying it, would extend along a
line of above 8000 miles; and it is certainly possible, that the
population of China should furnish millions, even, of emigrants
every year, without any diminution of its domestic
number,&mdash;inasmuch as those only would emigrate, who, but for
the offer of free migration, either would die of misery or would
never be born.</p>
<p>My purpose in making the following quotations is to satisfy
you that the Chinese are well disposed to emigrate, and that it
would be hardly possible to select a more useful description of
labourers.</p>
<p>Sir George Staunton, in his account of Lord Macartney's
embassy, thus describes the Chinese emigrants at
Batavia:&mdash;"Great numbers of Chinese come constantly to
Batavia, with exactly the same views that attract the natives of
Holland to it&mdash;the desire of accumulating wealth in a
foreign land. Both generally belonged to the humbler classes of
life, and were bred in similar habits of industry in their own
country; but the different circumstances that attend them after
their arrival in Batavia, put an end to any farther resemblance
between them. The Chinese have, there, no way of getting forward
but by the continuance of their former exertions in a place where
they are more liberally rewarded, and by a strict economy in the
preservation of their gains. They have no chance of advancing by
favour; nor are public offices open to their ambition; but they
apply to every industrious occupation, and obtain whatever care
and labour can accomplish. They become, in town, retailers,
clerks, and agents: in the country, they are farmers, and the
principal <i>cultivators of the sugar cane</i>. They do, at
length, acquire fortunes, which they value by the time and labour
required to earn them. So gradual an acquisition makes no change
in their disposition or mode of life. Their industry is not
diminished, nor their health impaired.
*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;* The Chinese are said to
be now as numerous as ever again in and about Batavia; for
however imminent the danger to which the Dutch allege that they
were exposed by the intended former insurrection of this people,
and however cruel and unjustifiable the Chinese consider the
conduct of the Dutch towards them, at that tune, the occasion
they have for each other has brought them again together; and it
is acknowledged by the latter that the settlement could scarcely
exist without the industry and ingenuity of the former."</p>
<p>In Mr. Barrow's voyage to Cochin China, the following passages
occur: "The next description of inhabitants of Batavia, who in
number and opulence exceed the format is the Chinese. These
people, as appears by their records, first obtained a settlement
in Java about the year 1412. As intruders, but not conquerors, it
is probable that they have at all times been subject to harsh and
oppressive treatment; but the restrictions and extortions under
which they at present (1793) labour, seem as unnecessary and
impolitic as they are unjust. That they should consent to the
Mahomedans, Malays, and Javanese exercising their devotions in
the same temple, which they built at their own expense, and
consecrated to the god of their own worship, is by no means an
unfavourable feature in their character; but on the part of the
Dutch who enforce the measure, it is one of the greatest insults
that could well be offered. The Chinese hospital or infirmary,
which was erected by voluntary contributions from their own
community, and is supported by legacies, by profits arising from
theatrical exhibitions and fire-works, and by a small tax on
marriages, funerals, and the celebration of public festivals, is
equally open for the benefit and reception of those who have not
contributed towards the establishment, and who do not belong to
the society. Into this admirable institution are indiscriminately
admitted the infirm and the aged, the friendless and the
indigent, of all nations. Towards the support of those
institutions, the temple and the infirmary, their contributions
are voluntary; but exclusive of these, their industry is severely
taxed by the Dutch government. Every religious festival and
public ceremony, every popular amusement, as well as every branch
of individual industry, are subject to taxation. They are even
obliged to pay for a license to wear their hair in a long plaited
tail, according to the custom of their country; for permission to
bring their greens to market, and to sell their produce and
manufactures in the streets. Yet to the industry and exertions of
these people are the Dutch wholly indebted for the means of
existing with any tolerable degree of comfort in Batavia. Every
species of vegetable for the table is raised by them, in all
seasons of the year, and at times when the most indefatigable
attention and labour are required. They are masons, carpenters,
blacksmiths, painters, upholsterers, tailors, and shoemakers.
They are employed in the arts of distilling, sugar-refining,
pottery, lime-burning, and every other trade and profession that
are indispensably necessary for making the state of civilized
society tolerably comfortable. They are, moreover, the
contractors for supplying the various demands of the civil,
military, and marine establishments in the settlement; they are
the collectors of the rates, the customs and the taxes; and, in
short, are the monopolizers of the interior commerce of the
island; and, with the Malays, carry on the principal part of the
coasting trade.</p>
<p>"The influence which would naturally follow from the
management of concerns so very important and extensive, could not
long be regarded by a weak and luxurious government without
jealousy. Those arts which the Europeans have usually followed
with success in establishing themselves in foreign countries, and
which the Dutch have not been backward in carefully studying and
effectually carrying into practice, with regard to the natives of
Java, could not be applied with the least hope of success to the
Chinese settlers. These people had no sovereign to dethrone, by
opposing to him the claims of an usurper; nor did the separate
interests of any petty chief allow them, by exciting jealousy, to
put in execution the old adage of <i>divide et impera</i>, divide
and command. With as little hope of success could the masters of
the island venture to seduce an industrious and abstemious people
from their temperate habits by the temptation of foreign
luxuries; and their general disposition to sobriety held out no
encouragement for the importation of spirituous liquors and
intoxicating drugs. For, though the Chinese, who are in
circumstances to afford it, make use of opium to excess, yet this
is a luxury in which the common people of this nation rarely
think of indulging. The Dutch, therefore, who were weak in point
of numbers, had recourse to a more decisive and speedy measure
for getting rid of a redundancy of population, which had begun to
create suspicion and alarm: they put them to the sword.
*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;* This
extraordinary affair took place on the 9th of October; the whole
of the 10th was a day of plunder; and on the 11th they began to
remove out of the streets the dead bodies, the interment of which
employed them eight days. The number said to have perished,
according to the Dutch account, amounts to more than twelve
thousand, souls. Having thus completed one of the most inhuman,
and apparently causeless transactions that ever disgraced a
civilized people, they had the audacity to proclaim a public
thanksgiving to the God of mercy for their happy deliverance from
the hands of the heathen. While the Dutch, in their public
records, endeavour to justify this atrocious act on the plea of
necessity, they make the following memorable observation: It is
remarkable that this people, notwithstanding their great numbers,
offered not the least resistance, but suffered themselves to be
led as sheep to the slaughter." For my own part, when I reflect
on the timid character of the Chinese, their want of confidence
in each other, and their strong aversion to the shedding of human
blood; and when I compare their situation in Batavia to that of
the Hottentots in the colony of the Cape of Good Hope, where
every little irregularity is magnified into a plot against the
government, I cannot forbear giving a decided opinion that these
people were innocently murdered. The consequences to the Dutch
proved much more serious than at first they seemed to have been
aware of. The terrified Chinese, who escaped the massacre, fled
into the interior of the island; a scarcity of rice and every
kind of vegetables, succeeded; and the apprehensions of a famine
induced them to offer terms to the fugitives, and to entreat
their return."</p>
<p>Sir Stamford Raffles, in his history of Java, writes as
follows:</p>
<p>"Besides the natives, whose numbers, circumstances, and
character I have slightly mentioned, there is in Java a rapidly
increasing race of foreigners, who have emigrated from the
different surrounding countries. The most numerous and important
class of these is the Chinese, who already (1816) do not fall far
short of a hundred thousand; and who, with a system of free
trade, and free cultivation, <i>would soon accumulate
ten-fold</i>, by natural increase within the island and gradual
accessions of new settlers from home. They reside principally in
the three great capitals of Batavia, Semàrang, and Surabàya, but
they are to be found in all the smaller capitals, and scattered
over most parts of the country. A great proportion of them are
descended from families, who have been many generations on the
island;&mdash;additions are gradually making to their numbers.
They arrive at Batavia from China to the amount of a thousand or
more annually, in Chinese junks, carrying three, four, and five
hundred each, <i>without money or resources</i>; but, by dint of
their industry, soon acquire comparative opulence. There are no
women in Java, who come directly from China; but as the Chinese
often marry the daughters of their countrymen by Javan women,
there results a numerous mixed race, which is often scarcely
distinguishable from the native Chinese."</p>
<p>Mr. Finlayson, in his Account of the Mission to Siam and Hué,
in 1822, speaks as follows of the Chinese emigrants at Penang and
Singapore:</p>
<p>"We had not proceeded far (at Penang) before a more
interesting and more gratifying scene was expanded to our
observation. Industry&mdash;active, useful, manly and
independent&mdash;seemed here to have found a congenial soil and
fostering care. The indolent air of the Asiatic was thrown aside.
Every one laboured to produce some useful object, and every
countenance teeming with animation, seemed, as it were, directed
to a set task. With the air, they had lost even the slender frame
of the Asiatic; and the limbs, and muscularity, and symmetry were
those of another and more energetic race. These were Chinese, a
people highly valuable as settlers, by reason of their
industrious and very regular habits, who had established on this
spot the mechanical arts, on a scale which might even vie with
that of European artists, but which we should look for in vain in
any other part of India. It was a pleasing and gratifying
spectacle&mdash;so much are we in India accustomed to the
opposite&mdash;to see a numerous, very muscular, and apparently
hardy race of people, labouring, with a degree of energy and
acuteness, which gave to their physical character a peculiar
stamp, and placed them in a highly favourable point of view, when
compared with the habits of the nations around them. Their manner
of using their instruments, so different from the puerile style
of Indian artists, had in it much of the dexterity of Europeans:
while their condition bespoke them a flourishing and wealthy
tribe. All the principal shops, all important and useful
employments, and almost all the commerce of the island, was in
their hands. Under the patronage of the British government they
soon acquire riches; they meet with entire protection of property
and person, and are cherished by the government, which, in
return, derives benefit from their industry, and from the
commercial and profitable speculations in which they usually
engage."</p>
<p align="center">
*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>
<p>"The neatness, the industry, and the ingenuity displayed in
plantations of this sort, (at Singapore) afford a very gratifying
spectacle, and attest the great progress which the Chinese nation
has made in agricultural science. The Chinese may be considered
as the sole cultivators of the soil.
*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;* The most prominent
feature in the character of the Chinese emigrant, is
industry,&mdash;the best and highest endowment which he has
attained. He is mechanically uniform and steady in the pursuit of
what he conceives to be his immediate and personal interest, in
the prosecution of which he exerts a degree of ingenuity and of
bodily labour and exertion, which leave all other Asiatics at a
distance. He labours with a strong arm, and is capable of great
and continued exertion. He is not satisfied to bestow the
quantity of labour necessary for the mere gratification of his
immediate wants. Profusion and indulgence claim a share of the
produce of his toils. Next in the catalogue of his virtues may be
reckoned general sobriety, honesty, a quiet, orderly conduct,
obedience to the laws of the country in which he resides, and, as
is affirmed, a strong and unalterable sense of the important
duties which parental affection inculcates.
*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;* It must be confessed,
however, that the Chinese are, in a political point of view, at
least, by far the most useful class of people to be found in the
Indian Seas. or Archipelago. Their robust frames, their
industrious habits, and their moderate conduct, place them beyond
competition. They furnish the best artizans, the most useful
labourers, and the most extensive traders. Their commercial
speculations are often extensive, often of the most adventurous
nature; and we may remark by the way, that they are often
immoderately fond of games of chance, as cards, dice,
cock-fighting. Inebriety is a vice of which they are but rarely
guilty? *&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;* Notwithstanding
the prohibitory laws of the celestial empire, <i>there would
appear to be no other limit to the extent of emigration than the
capacity of individual to procure a passage to the neighbouring
countries</i>, modified, in some degree, by the greater or less
demand for industry. It must be recollected, however, that this
emigration is to be considered as temporary, the majority of the
Chinese calculating upon returning after a time to their
respective provinces. Their wives, or females of any description,
are not permitted to accompany them abroad, to which circumstance
it is perhaps chiefly owing that the Chinese have formed no
colonies or other settlements, for the establishment of which
their situation is peculiarly favourable."</p>
<p>The above quotations give an exact description of the
emigrating Chinese <i>at this present time</i>; and I have
availed myself of them, in order to bring you to my opinion, by
means of the superior language and authority of very eminent
persons, who wrote without any ruling idea. Mr. Barrow has
declared that a few thousand Chinese emigrants would be of more
advantage than a rich gold mine, to the British colony in South
Africa; but he expressed that opinion on intimate, acquaintance
with the Chinese character, and he formed his opinion of the
Chinese long before he had an opportunity of observing the urgent
want of labourers at the Cape of Good Hope. His account of the
Chinese in Java, therefore, must be considered as perfectly
unprejudiced by any views of colonization, though, no doubt, the
idea on which I am dwelling is rather his than mine.</p>
<p>That idea, indeed, must strike every man at all acquainted
with the facts; for who can be aware of the crowded state of the
Chinese, and of their admirable qualities as settlers in a waste
country, without feeling surprised that they did not long ago
overrun this naturally happy wilderness, which seems to be made
on purpose, one may almost say, to receive the superabundant
millions. And is it not still more surprising that these British
settlers, who would gladly purchase slaves at one hundred pounds
per head, should not have procured labourers from Canton? The
labouring classes there, I am credibly informed, frequently make
offers to the masters of English ships to bind themselves to
labour, without wages, during three days in the week, for a term
of years, in return for a free passage to any British settlement.
Those abstemious and industrious creatures, who, at home, cannot
by the most constant and vigorous labour, earn more than just
enough to preserve their lives, are confident of being able to
acquire comparative wealth by the free disposal of half of their
time in any new country. But I have already explained, at length,
why the colonial employer of labour makes no efforts to obtain
indented servants, even at the cheapest rate of wages. However,
to repeat the words of Mr. Finlayson, "there would appear to be
no other limit to the extent of Chinese emigration, than the
capacity of individuals to procure a free passage to the
neighbouring countries;" and I have suggested, what appears to
me, a certain means of providing free transport to unlimited
numbers. Supposing me not to be mistaken in my view of the mode,
and the degree, in which the proposed system of colonization
would operate, there might be A constant immigration of Chinese
labourer? at every settlement in Australasia; and, considering
the transcendent skill of those people in the management of
water, they might, within a century, convert this immense desert
into a fruitful garden; provided, always, that females should be
permitted to emigrate in equal number with the males.</p>
<p>The existing obstacles to the emigration of females appear to
me to be the only bar to a most rapid increase of the
Australasian people, by means of emigration from China; but I
believe that those obstacles might be removed. It is certain
that, in seasons of scarcity, great numbers of Chinese females
migrate, with their husbands and parents, from the seaward
provinces into Tartary; and it is the Tartar government, alone,
of China which prevents their emigration by sea. But two
questions therefore remain: 1st, Whether the governors of the
seaward provinces might be persuaded, or bribed, or compelled, to
permit the emigration of women? 2d, Whether, if once a
considerable body of Chinese men had <i>established</i>
themselves in Australasia, enjoying perfect security of person
and property, whether in goods or <i>land</i>, they would not
readily procure women from their mother country, in spite of its
government? These questions can be answered by experience alone;
but the experiment seems worth an effort of diplomatic
skill&mdash;not by means of a pompous embassy, wherewith to
frighten the timid rulers of China&mdash;but through the
intervention of a class of persons who, by hook or by crook,
would procure <i>tea</i> from China, in spite of all earthly
obstacles.</p>
<p>It would appear, at first sight, that the people of England
have no motive for enabling the Chinese to multiply according to
the laws of nature, by means of free migration. But would it be
no advantage to British manufacturers to enjoy free trade with
millions of fellow subjects of Chinese origin, and, <i>through
them</i>, perhaps, with hundreds of millions of customers in the
celestial empire? I must not, however, enter on so large a
question; my only object in these remarks being to promote an
examination of the whole subject, by those Who have a special
interest in it and who are best qualified to conduct such an
inquiry.</p>

<h3>APPENDIX.</h3>
<hr class="2">
<h5>ARTICLE I.</h5>
<p><i>It is suggested</i>,<br>
<br>
<span class="a">That</span> a payment in money of per acre, be
required for all future grants of land without exception.</p>
<p class="quote">For the execution of this provision, the
<i>mode</i> of selling waste land in North America would furnish
a useful model.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h5>ARTICLE II.</h5>
<p>That all land now granted, and to be granted, throughout the
colony, be declared liable to a tax of
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; per cent. upon the
actual rent.</p>
<p class="quote">As this is not a land-tax, but a tax upon
<i>rent</i> the yearly amount of the tax would be determined,
either by the actual receipt of rent, or by the estimated letting
value of land when occupied by the landlord; and the machinery
for collecting the tax might be the same as that by which county
rates are levied in England.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h5>ARTICLE III.</h5>
<p>That the proceeds of the tax upon rent, and of sales, form an
<i>Emigration Fund</i>, to be employed in the conveyance of
British Labourers to the colony free of cost.</p>
<p class="quote">This provision explains itself. It may be
remarked, however, that, in conjunction with the other
provisions, it would supply the desideratum, so anxiously sought
by the Parliamentary Emigration Committee; namely, a means of
conducting the emigration of paupers from Britain <i>without any
expense to the country</i>. The principle on which the
recommendation of the Committee was founded, is, that the labour
of paupers, removed from an old to a new country, will repay the
cost of their removal. No doubt it will; but the measure proposed
by the Committee offers <i>no security</i> for repayment. They
suggest that Government shall advance to the Pauper Emigrant, not
only the cost of his passage, but also stock, implements and food
for a year; holding as security for repayment, the bit of forest
or swamp on which he shall be located. The pauper, necessarily
ignorant and imprudent, is to be converted, all at once, into a
landowner, and under circumstances, which, above all others,
require much intelligence and the greatest prudence. He is not to
be planted on a small grant, in the midst of rich, intelligent
and prudent emigrants, whose example and assistance might lead
him to profit by the great change in his condition; but thousands
like him are to be planted in masses, and left entirely to their
own guidance. His land, being in a country where land can he
obtained for next to nothing, will possess no value, except
according to the degree in which it shall be improved. The
security of the Government, therefore, for the repayment of its
advance, is the emigrant's good fortune and good conduct. He will
be subject to fever, and in a society so composed, to idleness,
drunkenness, blunders, and despair; any one of which must prevent
him from fulfilling the condition of his grant. Here then is an
end of security, in the usual sense of the word. Moreover, the
settler will be tempted, by the high wages of labour at no great
distance, to sell his stock, quit his embarrassing estate, and
return to his proper condition of a labourer for hire. Many
attempts have been made, both in America and in New South Wales,
to settle paupers in masses, isolated from capital, intelligence
and prudence. Such attempts at plantation have almost universally
failed. The poor, ignorant, imprudent landowner has sunk under
his troubles; his land has passed away to the dealer in rum; and,
the wages of labour near him being very high, he has returned to
his proper condition of a labourer for hire. Unquestionably the
emigration of paupers, according to the system proposed by the
Committee, would greatly benefit the condition of the persons
removed; but there is no security for repayment to Government of
the expense incurred by their removal; and this country is not
inclined to risk further taxation for any purpose, bad or good.
These, we may suppose, are the reasons why Mr. Wilmot Horton's
benevolent plan has been received by all parties, with apathy, if
not with dislike.<br>
<br>
Recurring to the proposed measure, whatever the extent of
emigration for which it should provide, the whole would occur
without any expense to this country. Emigration would be carried
on by private speculation, not to the loss but to the advantage
of those who should defray its expense. A part of that expense
would he defrayed beforehand by the produce of rent-tax and
sales; or, if that produce were anticipated, there would be ample
security for repayment to those who should make the advance.<br>
<br>
The Parliamentary Committee on Emigration have provided the
machinery for executing all that part of the proposed measure
which concerns the mere removal of the emigrant from Britain to
the Colony.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h5>ARTICLE IV.</h5>
<p>That those to whom the administration of the Fund shall be
entrusted, be empowered to raise money on that security, as money
is raised on the security of parish and county rates in
England.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h5>ARTICLE V.</h5>
<p>That the supply of Labourers be as nearly as possible
proportioned to the demand for Labour at each Settlement; so that
Capitalists shall never suffer from an urgent want of Labourers,
and that Labourers shall never want well-paid employment.</p>
<p class="quote">The execution of this provision would require
considerable intelligence and judgment in the persons to whom it
might be confided. It is proposed, that there should be an Agent
of Emigration at each Settlement. His duties would be,<br>
<br>
First, To supply the Government at home with accurate information
as to the state of demand for labourers in the Settlement; and
according to his reports, the supply of emigrants would be
carefully regulated.<br>
<br>
Secondly, To receive the emigrants on their arrival, and to
facilitate their being hired by capitalists.<br>
<br>
Thirdly, To furnish them with a very moderate provision until
hired.<br>
<br>
The first duty is the most important. In the infancy of a
Settlement, the Agent might very accurately learn the state of
demand for labour, by receiving applications from capitalists,
and keeping an exact registry of the same. Afterwards, as the
Settlement should increase, and capitalists should be far removed
from the seat of Colonial Government, he must take great pains to
collect true information, and to judge soundly.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h5>ARTICLE VI.</h5>
<p>That, in the selection of Emigrants, an absolute preference be
given to young persons, and that no excess of males be conveyed
to the colony free of cost.</p>
<p class="quote">A thousand emigrants of all ages might not, at
the end of twenty years, increase the Colonial population by more
than that number. As many might die as would be born, and, if
there were an excess of males, the number might, at the end of
twenty years, be much less than a thousand. But five hundred
young couples, supposing that each couple rear six children, and
that in twenty years half of the original emigrants be dead,
would, in that short period, increase the Colonial population by
three thousand five hundred souls. Any number of emigrants, in
short, would, if selected as proposed, treble themselves in the
first twenty years; whereas, a number of emigrants of all ages
might not, and probably would not, begin to increase till the end
of twenty years.<br>
<br>
Supposing the cost of conveying one thousand emigrants to be
£20,000, that sum, increasing for twenty years at compound
interest of five per cent., would be £53,000. Supposing one
thousand emigrants <i>of all ages</i> to be conveyed in the year
1830, the cost of increasing the Colonial population by a
thousand souls, in the year 1850, would be £53,000; whereas, if
young couples only were selected, an increase of a thousand souls
would be obtained, in 1850, by the emigration in 1880, of three
hundred persons, at a cost (allowing compound interest of five
per cent. for twenty years) of £16,000.<br>
<br>
This is an extreme calculation; but it is offered only to
illustrate a principle. By adopting that principle in the conduct
of emigration, in conjunction with the rest of the proposed
measure, might not the crown eventually sell land in the Colonies
for as high a price as could be obtained for fertile land, rising
miraculously out of the sea, close to Britain?</p>
<br>
<br>
<h5>ARTICLE VII.</h5>
<p>That Colonists providing a passage for emigrant Labourers,
being young persons and equal numbers of both sexes, be entitled
to a payment in money from the Emigration Fund, equal to the
actual contract price of a passage for so many labouring
persons.</p>
<p class="quote">The object of this regulation is to enable
capitalists to obtain labourers accustomed to any particular kind
of cultivation. It would not at all interfere with the general
principles on which the whole measure is founded.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h5>ARTICLE VIII.</h5>
<p>That Grants be absolute in fee, without any condition
whatsoever, and obtainable by deputy.</p>
<p class="quote">The other regulations of the proposed measure
would obviate the necessity for conditions. All the conditions at
present attached to grants of colonial land, are intended to
prevent the misappropriation and neglect of land. They have
entirely failed of their object; but that object would be
obtained, in the most simple and certain manner, by the proposed
measure. As the supply of labourers would always be in proportion
to the land granted, the grantee, if he did not let his land,
would surely cultivate it. It cannot be doubted that, at present,
grantees of waste land wish to fulfil the conditions of their
grants. To do so would be for their own advantage; but the
dearness of labour,&mdash;the absolute want of
labourers,&mdash;prevents them from doing so. In the proposed
case, the grantee would have the power to consult his own
advantage, by cultivating his land. It is for this that be would
pay, when appearing to pay for his title to the land; and it is
to be presumed that he would not neglect that which he had
purchased at a considerable price. It seems, therefore, quite
unnecessary to bind him to do what every man in his situation
would be sure to do without any bond. If this view of the subject
be correct, it furnishes a strong argument in favour of the whole
measure. The governments of all new colonies have adopted the
principle of checking the misappropriation of land, and have
hitherto universally failed in their attempts to give effect to
that principle. The proposed measure, it is conceived, would at
once give complete effect to that excellent principle, by
securing what alone has been sought by the conditions attached to
grants.<br>
<br>
That grants should be obtainable by deputy, that is, without
emigration, is recommended with a view to treat colonial land as
much as possible like land that should, miraculously, rise out of
the sea close to Britain. In the imagined case, the purchaser of
land would not be compelled to reside on his grant Whether or not
he should reside oti his grant would be wholly unimportant, with
a view to the effect of an increase of territory in causing a
decrease of pauperism. So in the proposed case, the grantee, even
though he should never quit London, could not misappropriate
land. His purchase-money would be employed in augmenting the
colonial population, in proportion to the extent of his grant.
His land therefore would yield rent; and of course it would be
cultivated, though not by him.<br>
<br>
If this conclusion is reasonable, it is much to be desired that
grants should be obtainable without emigration. The whole object
of the proposed measure is to diminish the evils of pauperism in
Britain, and to promote colonization, by rendering the purchase
of waste land a very profitable employment of capital. The
greater the quantity of land purchased, the more gratifying would
be the results of the proposed measure. Consequently the purchase
of waste land should be encouraged, as much, and checked as
little, as possible. An obligation to emigrate would be a serious
check. If there were no such obligation, much British capital
might be invested in the purchase of colonial land. Such a mode
of investment would be peculiarly eligible for properties
intended to accumulate, and would, perhaps, be preferable to any
investment in reversionary property. Every argument, at least,
which favours the presumption that the whole measure would cause
a rapid advance in the rent of land, is an argument also in
favour of such investments. For the increase of rent is an
increase of market value; and if the increase were rapid, such
investments would be a very profitable employment of money.
London capitalists would require no other encouragement to assist
in giving effect to the proposed system of colonial policy.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h5>ARTICLE IX.</h5>
<p>That any surplus of the proceeds of the tax upon rent and of
sales, over what is required for Emigration, be employed in
relief of other taxes, and for the general purposes of Colonial
Government.</p>
<p class="quote">"If a body of people were to migrate into a new
country, and land had not yet become private property, there
would be this reason for considering the rent of land as a source
peculiarly adapted to supply the exigencies of the government:
that industry would not, by that means, sustain the smallest
repression, and that the expense of the government would be
defrayed without imposing any burthen upon any individual. The
owners of capital would enjoy its profits; the class of labourers
would enjoy their wages, without any deduction whatsoever; and
every man would employ his capital in the way which was really
most advantageous, without any inducement from the mischievous
operation of a tax, to remove it from a channel, in which it was
more, to one in which it would be less productive to the nation.
There is, therefore, a peculiar advantage in reserving the rent
of land as a fund for supplying the exigencies of the state."
*</p>
<p class="foot">[* Mill's Elements of Political Economy.]</p>
<p class="quote">All the expense of the measure itself, that is,
the whole cost of surveys, of the collection of rent-tax, and of
emigration, would, of course, be at once defrayed by the proceeds
of rent-tax and sales. The utmost economy of administration would
be indispensable to the success of the measure; and especially
that economy which would devote as much as possible to the mere
passage of emigrants, and as little as possible to the salaries
of officers. Perhaps the surplus of the fund produced by rent-tax
and sales over what would be required to maintain a constant
supply of labour in proportion to the demand, would, at times, be
very considerable. Such surplus might properly be employed in the
construction of roads, bridges, canals, docks, or other public
works, having a tendency to increase production and consumption,
that is to raise the rent of land. Perhaps also that surplus
might be sufficiently great to defray a part, or even the whole,
of the expense of colonial government.</p>
<hr class="2">
<p class="quote">1. <span class="a">It</span> is suggested that
this mode of disposing of waste land should be rendered permanent
by an act of the Legislature. Because, without the best security
for its permanence, capitalists would not, to any great extent,
either purchase waste land, or advance money on the future
proceeds of rent-tax and sales.<br>
<br>
2. To operate effectually, this mode of disposing of waste land
should be adopted in all the settlements of any colony actual and
future. Otherwise the capitalists of a settlement where land
might be obtained for nothing, would, in order to supply their
consequent want of labourers, entice away the labourers of other
settlements, where land had been obtained by payment; and the
purchasers of land would thereby be cheated of their
consideration.<br>
<br>
3. The measure could not be applied to Canada. Because the
vicinity of the United States would induce emigrant labourers to
emigrate once more in search of waste land, or extravagant wages;
and the purchasers of waste land in Canada, would thereby be
cheated of their consideration. It appears peculiarly adapted to
Australasia: in the first place, because, in that country, the
acquisition of land at no great distance from the sea, might
proceed for ages to come; and the cost of transport, both for
emigrants and for produce, would be much less than in a country,
where colonization could proceed only at a great distance from
the sea: secondly, because the profit on the employment of
capital in colonization would depend on the increase of people;
and in Australasia the absence of those diseases which afflict
other new countries, and of many diseases which are fatal to
children in Europe, would permit an unexampled excess of births
over deaths: thirdly, because the Australasian settlements are
yet in their infancy; no uniform system of granting land has yet
been established in them; and an uniform system might be
established there without injury to any existing class of
persons.<br>
<br>
4. It seems difficult to discover any class of persons whose
vested rights, or other interests, would be injuriously affected
by the measure. The actual grantees of land, whom, at first
sight, it would appear to tax, are exactly the class of persons
that would gain the most by it As waste land would no longer be
obtainable but by payment of per acre, their land must very soon
possess that market value, at least; and the tax upon rent, not
being a land tax, would take from them only a part of what, in
most cases, the tax itself would first bestow.<br>
<br>
5. It would be in accordance with the principles on which the
suggested measure is founded, to allow the occupation of waste
land, for grazing, as such occupation is now usefully permitted
in. New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land. The object of that
permission would be to give a temporary additional value to
appropriated land, and to facilitate the rapid increase of
capital in the shape of animal food. Whenever a demand should
occur for the purchase of land so occupied, the time would be
come for making that land still more productive; and then its
occupation by the owner of other land ought properly to
cease.<br>
<br>
6. Supposing the measure to be adopted, its operation might be
materially retarded, xxiii if the intention of Government to
adopt it were publicly known before the first step towards
execution. The first step towards execution would be to put a
stop to the granting of land according to the various existing
regulations. Were the intention of government to take that step
publicly known, and were it, besides, publicly understood that,
before long, no grants would be made but for payment in money,
and that every grant would provide for a given increase of
people, very many grants would be hastily obtained on the easiest
of present terms. A very great misappropriation of land would
take place. Such misappropriation would be directly contrary to
the whole spirit of the measure, and must retard its beneficial
effects, by postponing the time when the increase of people and
capital, in proportion to appropriated land, should cause a
demand for fresh grants at a money price. But when government had
taken that first step, publicity would be useful, by affording to
individual and joint-stock xxiv capitalists time to prepare for
giving effect to the new system of colonization, as soon as
possible after it had been established by law.</p>
