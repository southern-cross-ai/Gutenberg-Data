<h2><a id="wolf1" name="wolf1">I. &mdash; THE BATTLE STANDARD</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">THE commander of the Turkish outpost of El Ashraf
was awakened before dawn by the stamp of horses and jingle of
accoutrements. He sat up and shouted for for his orderly. There was
no response, so he rose, hurriedly jerked on his garments, and
strode out of the mud hut that served as his headquarters. What he
saw rendered him momentarily speechless.</p>

<p>His command was mounted, in full marching formation, drawn up
near the railroad that it was their duty to guard. The plain to the
left of the track where the tents of the troopers had stood now lay
bare. The tents had been loaded on the baggage camels which stood
fully packed and ready to move out. The commandant glared wildly,
doubting his own senses, until his eyes rested on a flag borne by a
trooper. The waving pennant did not display the familiar crescent.
The commandant turned pale.</p>

<p>"What does this mean?" he shouted, striding forward. His
lieutenant, Osman, glanced at him inscrutably. Osman was a tall
man, hard and supple as steel, with a dark keen face.</p>

<p>"Mutiny, <i>effendi</i>," he replied calmly. "We are sick of
this war we fight for the Germans. We are sick of Djemal Pasha and
those other fools of the Council of Unity and Progress, and,
incidentally, of you. So we are going into the hills to build a
tribe of our own."</p>

<p>"Madness!" gasped the officer, tugging at his revolver. Even as
he drew it, Osman shot him through the head.</p>

<p>The lieutenant sheathed the smoking pistol and turned to the
troopers. The ranks were his to a man, won to his wild ambition
under the very nose of the officer who now lay there with his
brains oozing.</p>

<p>"Listen!" he commanded.</p>

<p>In the tense silence they all heard the low, deep reverberation
in the west.</p>

<p>"British guns!" said Osman. "Battering the Turkish Empire to
bits! The New Turks have failed. What Asia needs is not a new
party, but a new race! There are thousands of fighting men between
the Syrian coast and the Persian highlands, ready to be roused by a
new word, a new prophet! The East is moving in her sleep. Ours is
the duty to awaken her!</p>

<p>"You have all sworn to follow me into the hills. Let us return
to the ways of our pagan ancestors who worshipped the White Wolf on
the steppes of High Asia before they bowed to the creed of
Mohammed!</p>

<p>"We have reached the end of the Islamic Age. We abjure Allah as
a superstition fostered by an epileptic Meccan camel driver. Our
people have copied Arab ways too long. But we hundred men are
<i>Turks!</i> We have burned the Koran. We bow not toward Mecca,
nor swear by their false Prophet. And now follow me as we
planned&mdash;to establish ourselves in a strong position in the
hills and to seize Arab women for our wives."</p>

<p>"Our sons will be half Arab," someone protested.</p>

<p>"A man is the son of his father," retorted Osman. "We Turks have
always looted the <i>harims</i> of the world for our women, but our
sons are always Turks.</p>

<p>"Come! We have arms, horses, supplies. If we linger we shall be
crushed with the rest of the army between the British on the coast
and the Arabs the Englishman Lawrence is bringing up from the
south. Onto El Awad! The sword for the men&mdash;captivity, for the
women!"</p>

<p>His voice cracked like a whip as he snapped the orders that set
the lines in motion. In perfect order they moved off through the
lightening dawn toward the range of sawedged hills in the distance.
Behind them the air still vibrated with the distant rumble of the
British artillery. Over them waved a banner that bore the head of a
white wolf&mdash;the battle-standard of most ancient Turan.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="wolf2" name="wolf2">II. &mdash; MASSACRE</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">WHEN Fräulein Olga von Bruckmann, known as a
famous German secret agent, arrived at the tiny Arab hill-village
of El Awad, it was in a drizzling rain, that made the dusk a
blinding curtain over the muddy town.</p>

<p>With her companion, an Arab named Ahmed, she rode into the muddy
street, and the villagers crept from their hovels to stare in awe
at the first white woman most of them had ever seen.</p>

<p>A few words from Ahmed and the <i>shaykh</i> salaamed and showed
her to the best mud hut in the village. The horses were led away to
feed and shelter, and Ahmed paused long enough to whisper to his
companion:</p>

<p>"El Awad is friendly to the Turks. Have no fear. I shall be
near, in any event."</p>

<p>"Try and get fresh horses," she urged. "I must push on as soon
as possible."</p>

<p>"The <i>shaykh</i> swears there isn't a horse in the village in
fit condition to be ridden. He may be lying. But at any rate our
own horses will be rested enough to go on by dawn. Even with fresh
horses it would be useless to try to go any farther tonight. We'd
lose our way among the hills, and in this region there's always the
risk of running into Lawrence's Bedouin raiders."</p>

<p>Olga knew that Ahmed knew she carried important secret documents
from Baghdad to Damascus, and she knew from experience that she
could trust his loyalty. Removing only her dripping cloak and
riding boots, she stretched herself on the dingy blankets that
served as a bed. She was worn out from the strain of the
journey.</p>

<p>She was the first white woman ever to attempt to ride from
Baghdad to Damascus. Only the protection accorded a trusted secret
agent by the long arm of the German-Turkish government, and her
guide's zeal and craft, had brought her thus far in safety.</p>

<p>She fell asleep, thinking of the long weary miles still to be
traveled, and even greater dangers, now that she had come into the
region where the Arabs were fighting their Turkish masters. The
Turks still held the country, that summer of 1917, but
lightninglike raids flashed across the desert, blowing up trains,
cutting tracks and butchering the inhabitants of isolated posts.
Lawrence was leading the tribes northward, and with him was the
mysterious American, <i>El Borak</i>, whose name was one to hush
children.</p>

<p>She never knew how long she slept, but she awoke suddenly and
sat up, in fright and bewilderment. The rain still beat on the
roof, but there mingled with it shrieks of pain or fear, yells and
the staccato crackling of rifles. She sprang up, lighted a candle
and was just pulling on her boots when the door was hurled open
violently.</p>

<p>Ahmed reeled in, his dark face livid, blood oozing through the
fingers that clutched his breast.</p>

<p>"The village is attacked!" he cried chokingly. "Men in Turkish
uniform! There must be some mistake! They know El Awad is friendly!
I tried to tell their officer we are friends, but he shot me! We
must get away, quick!"</p>

<p>A shot cracked in the open door behind him and a jet of fire
spurted from the blackness. Ahmed groaned and crumpled. Olga cried
out in horror, staring wide-eyed at the figure who stood before
her. A tall, wiry man in Turkish uniform blocked the door. He was
handsome in a dark, hawklike way, and he eyed her in a manner that
brought the blood to her cheeks.</p>

<p>"Why did you kill that man?" she demanded. "He was a trusted
servant of your country."</p>

<p>"I have no country," he answered, moving toward her. Outside the
firing was dying away and women's voices were lifted piteously. "I
go to build one, as my ancestor Osman did."</p>

<p>"I don't know what you're talking about," she retorted. "But
unless you provide me with an escort to the nearest post, I shall
report you to your superiors, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>He laughed wildly at her. "I have no superiors, you little fool!
I am an empire builder, I tell you! I have a hundred armed men at
my disposal. I'll build a new race in these hills." His eyes blazed
as he spoke.</p>

<p>"You're mad!" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Mad? It's you who are mad not to recognize the possibilities as
I have! This war is bleeding the life out of Europe. When it's
over, no matter who wins, the nations will lie prostrate. Then it
will be Asia's turn!</p>

<p>"If Lawrence can build up an Arab army to fight for him, then
certainly I, an Ottoman, can build up a kingdom among my own
peoples! Thousands of Turkish soldiers have deserted to the
British. They and more will desert again to me, when they hear that
a Turk is building anew the empire of ancient Turan."</p>

<p>"Do what you like," she answered, believing he had been seized
by the madness that often grips men in time of war when the world
seems crumbling and any wild dream looks possible. "But at least
don't interfere with my mission. If you won't give me an escort,
I'll go on alone."</p>

<p>"You'll go with me!" he retorted, looking down at her with hot
admiration.</p>

<p>Olga was a handsome girl, tall, slender but supple, with a
wealth of unruly golden hair. She was so completely feminine that
no disguise would make her look like a man, not even the voluminous
robes of an Arab, so she had attempted none. She trusted instead to
Ahmed's skill to bring her safely through the desert.</p>

<p>"Do you hear those screams? My men are supplying themselves with
wives to bear soldiers for the new empire. Yours shall be the
signal honor of being the first to go into Sultan Osman's
<i>seraglio</i>!"</p>

<p>"You do not dare!" She snatched a pistol from her blouse.</p>

<p>Before she could level it he wrenched it from her with brutal
strength.</p>

<p>"Dare!" He laughed at her vain struggles. "What do I not dare? I
tell you a new empire is being born tonight! Come with me! There's
no time for love- making now. Before dawn we must be on the march
for Sulaiman's Walls. The star of the White Wolf rises!"</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="wolf3" name="wolf3">III. &mdash; THE CALL OF BLOOD</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">THE sun was not long risen over the saw-edged
mountains to the east, but already the heat was glazing the
cloudless sky to the hue of white-hot steel. Along the dim road
that split the immensity of the desert a single shape moved. The
shape grew out of the heat-hazes of the south and resolved itself
into a man on a camel.</p>

<p>The man was no Arab. His boots and khakis, as well as the
rifle-butt jutting from beneath his knee, spoke of the West. But
with his dark face and hard frame he did not look out of place,
even in that fierce land. He was Francis Xavier Gordon, El Borak,
whom men loved, feared or hated, according to their political
complexion, from the Golden Horn to the headwaters of the
Ganges.</p>

<p>He had ridden most of the night, but his iron frame had not yet
approached the fringes of weariness. Another mile, and he sighted a
yet dimmer trail straggling down from a range of hills to the east.
Something was coming along this trail&mdash;a crawling something
that left a broad dark smear on the hot flints.</p>

<p>Gordon swung his camel into the trail and a moment later bent
over the man who lay there gasping stertorously. It was a young
Arab, and the breast of his <i>abba</i> was soaked in blood.</p>

<p>"Yusef!" Gordon drew back the wet <i>abba</i>, glanced at the
bared breast, then covered it again. Blood oozed steadily from a
blue-rimmed bullet-hole. There was nothing he could do. Already the
Arab's eyes were glazing. Gordon stared up the trail, seeing
neither horse nor camel anywhere. But the dark smear stained the
stones as far as he could see.</p>

<p>"My God, man, how far have you crawled in this condition?"</p>

<p>"An hour&mdash;many hours&mdash;I do not know!" panted Yusef. "I
fainted and fell from the saddle. When I came to I was lying in the
trail and my horse was gone. But I knew you would be coming up from
the south, so I crawled&mdash;crawled! Allah, how hard are thy
stones!"</p>

<p>Gordon set a canteen to his lips and Yusef drank noisily, then
clutched Gordon's sleeve with clawing fingers.</p>

<p>"El Borak, I am dying and that is no great matter, but there is
the matter of vengeance&mdash;not for me, <i>ya sidi</i>, but for
innocent ones. You know I was on furlough to my village, El Awad. I
am the only man of El Awad who fights for Arabia. The elders are
friendly to the Turks. But last night the Turks burned El Awad!
They marched in before midnight and the people welcomed
them&mdash;while I hid in a shed.</p>

<p>"Then without warning they began slaying! The men of El Awad
were unarmed and helpless. I slew one soldier myself. Then they
shot me and I dragged myself away&mdash;found my horse and rode to
tell the tale before I died. Ah, Allah, I have tasted of perdition
this night!"</p>

<p>"Did you recognize their officer?" asked Gordon.</p>

<p>"I never saw him before. They called this leader of theirs Osman
Pasha. Their flag bore the head of a white wolf. I saw it by the
light of the burning huts. My people cried out in vain that they
were friends.</p>

<p>"There was a German woman and a man of Hauran who came to El
Awad from the east, just at nightfall. I think they were spies. The
Turks shot him and took her captive. It was all blood and
madness."</p>

<p>"Mad indeed!" muttered Gordon. Yusef lifted himself on an elbow
and groped for him, a desperate urgency in his weakening voice.</p>

<p>"El Borak, I fought well for the Emir Feisal, and for Lawrence
<i>effendi</i>, and for you! I was at Yenbo, and Wejh, and Akaba.
Never have I asked a reward! I ask now: justice and vengeance!
Grant me this plea: Slay the Turkish dogs who butchered my
people!"</p>

<p>Gordon did not hesitate.</p>

<p>"They shall die," he answered.</p>

<p>Yusef smiled fiercely, gasped: "<i>Allaho akbat!</i>" then sank
back dead.</p>

<p>Within the hour Gordon rode eastward. The vultures had already
gathered in the sky with their grisly foreknowledge of death, then
flapped sullenly away from the cairn of stones he had piled over
the dead man, Yusef.</p>

<p>Gordon's business in the north could wait. One reason for his
dominance over the Orientals was the fact that in some ways his
nature closely resembled theirs. He not only understood the cry for
vengeance, but he sympathized with it. And he always kept his
promise.</p>

<p>But he was puzzled. The destruction of a friendly village was
not customary, even by the Turks, and certainly they would not
ordinarily have mishandled their own spies. If they were deserters
they were acting in an unusual manner, for most deserters made
their way to Feisal. And that wolf's head banner?</p>

<p>Gordon knew that certain fanatics in the New Turks party were
trying to erase all signs of Arab culture from their civilization.
This was an impossible task, since that civilization itself was
based on Arabic culture; but he had heard that in Istambul the
radicals even advocated abandoning Islam and reverting to the
paganism of their ancestors. But he had never believed the
tale.</p>

<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>

<p>The sun was sinking over the mountains of Edom when Gordon came
to ruined El Awad, in a fold of the bare hills. For hours before he
had marked its location by black dots dropping in the blue. That
they did not rise again told him that the village was deserted
except for the dead.</p>

<p>As he rode into the dusty street several vultures flapped
heavily away. The hot sun had dried the mud, curdled the red pools
in the dust. He sat in his saddle a while, staring silently.</p>

<p>He was no stranger to the handiwork of the Turk. He had seen
much of it in the long fighting up from Jeddah on the Red Sea. But
even so, he felt sick. The bodies lay in the street, headless,
disemboweled, hewn asunder&mdash;bodies of children, old women and
men. A red mist floated before his eyes, so that for a moment the
landscape seemed to swim in blood. The slayers were gone; but they
had left a plain road for him to follow.</p>

<p>What the signs they had left did not show him, he guessed. The
slayers had loaded their female captives on baggage camels, and had
gone eastward, deeper into the hills. Why they were following that
road he could not guess, but he knew where it led&mdash;to the
long-abandoned Walls of Sulaiman, by way of the Well of Achmet.</p>

<p>Without hesitation he followed. He had not gone many miles
before he passed more of their work&mdash;a baby, its brains oozing
from its broken head. Some kidnapped woman had hidden her child in
her robes until it had been wrenched from her and brained on the
rocks, before her eyes.</p>

<p>The country became wilder as he went. He did not halt to eat,
but munched dried dates from his pouch as he rode. He did not waste
time worrying over the recklessness of his action&mdash;one lone
American dogging the crimson trail of a Turkish raiding party.</p>

<p>He had no plan; his future actions would depend on the
circumstances that arose. But he had taken the death-trail and he
would not turn back while he lived. He was no more foolhardy than
his grandfather who single-handedly trailed an Apache war-party for
days through the Guadalupes and returned to the settlement on the
Pecos with scalps hanging from his belt.</p>

<p>The sun had set and dusk was closing in when Gordon topped a
ridge and looked down on the plain whereon stands the Well of
Achmet with its straggling palm grove. To the right of that cluster
stood the tents, horse lines and camel lines of a well-ordered
force. To the left stood a hut used by travelers as a <i>khan</i>.
The door was shut and a sentry stood before it. While he watched, a
man came from the tents with a bowl of food which he handed in at
the door.</p>

<p>Gordon could not see the occupant, but he believed it was the
German girl of whom Yusef had spoken, though why they should
imprison one of their own spies was one of the mysteries of this
strange affair. He saw their flag, and could make out a splotch of
white that must be the wolf's head. He saw, too, the Arab women,
thirty-five or forty of them herded into a pen improvised from
bales and pack-saddles. They crouched together dumbly, dazed by
their misfortunes.</p>

<p>He had hidden his camel below the ridge, on the western slope,
and he lay concealed behind a clump of stunted bushes until night
had fallen. Then he slipped down the slope, circling wide to avoid
the mounted patrol, which rode leisurely about the camp. He lay
prone behind a boulder till it had passed, then rose and stole
toward the hut. Fires twinkled in the darkness beneath the palms
and he heard the wailing of the captive women.</p>

<p>The sentry before the door of the hut did not see the cat-footed
shadow that glided up to the rear wall. As Gordon drew close he
heard voices within. They spoke in Turkish.</p>

<p>One window was in the back wall. Strips of wood had been
fastened over it, to serve as both pane and bars. Peering between
them, Gordon saw a slender girl in a travel-worn riding habit
standing before a dark-faced man in a Turkish uniform. There was no
insignia to show what his rank had been. The Turk played with a
riding whip and his eyes gleamed with cruelty in the light of a
candle on a camp table.</p>

<p>"What do I care for the information you bring from Baghdad?" he
was demanding. "Neither Turkey nor Germany means anything to me.
But it seems you fail to realize your own position. It is mine to
command, you to obey! You are my prisoner, my captive, my slave!
It's time you learned what that means. And the best teacher I know
is the whip!"</p>

<p>He fairly spat the last word at her and she paled.</p>

<p>"You dare not subject me to this indignity!" she whispered
weakly.</p>

<p>Gordon knew this man must be Osman Pasha. He drew his heavy
automatic from its scabbard under his armpit and aimed at the
Turk's breast through the crack in the window. But even as his
finger closed on the trigger he changed his mind. There was the
sentry at the door, and a hundred other armed men, within hearing,
whom the sound of a shot would bring on the run. He grasped the
window bars and braced his legs.</p>

<p>"I see I must dispel your illusions," muttered Osman, moving
toward the girl who cowered back until the wall stopped her. Her
face was white. She had dealt with many dangerous men in her
hazardous career, and she was not easily frightened. But she had
never met a man like Osman. His face was a terrifying mask of
cruelty; the ferocity that gloats over the agony of a weaker thing
shone in his eyes.</p>

<p>Suddenly he had her by the hair, dragging her to him, laughing
at her scream of pain. Just then Gordon ripped the strips off the
window. The snapping of the wood sounded loud as a gun-shot and
Osman wheeled, drawing his pistol, as Gordon came through the
window.</p>

<p>The American hit on his feet, leveled automatic checking Osman's
move. The Turk froze, his pistol lifted shoulder high, muzzle
pointing at the roof. Outside the sentry called anxiously.</p>

<p>"Answer him!" grated Gordon below his breath. "Tell him
everything is all right. And drop that gun!"</p>

<p>The pistol fell to the floor and the girl snatched it up.</p>

<p>"Come here, <i>Fräulein!</i>"</p>

<p>She ran to him, but in her haste she crossed the line of fire.
In that fleeting moment when her body shielded his, Osman acted. He
kicked the table and the candle toppled and went out, and
simultaneously he dived for the floor. Gordon's pistol roared
deafeningly just as the hut was plunged into darkness. The next
instant the door crashed inward and the sentry bulked against the
starlight, to crumple as Gordon's gun crashed again and yet
again.</p>

<p>With a sweep of his arm Gordon found the girl and drew her
toward the window. He lifted her through as if she had been a
child, and climbed through after her. He did not know whether his
blind slug had struck Osman or not. The man was crouching silently
in the darkness, but there was no time to strike a match and see
whether he was living or dead. But as they ran across the shadowy
plain, they heard Osman's voice lifted in passion.</p>

<p>By the time they reached the crest of the ridge the girl was
winded. Only Gordon's arm about her waist, half dragging, half
carrying her, enabled her to make the last few yards of the steep
incline. The plain below them was alive with torches and shouting
men. Osman was yelling for them to run down the fugitives, and his
voice came faintly to them on the ridge.</p>

<p>"Take them alive, curse you! Scatter and find them! It's El
Borak!" An instant later he was yelling with an edge of panic in
his voice: "Wait. Come back! Take cover and make ready to repel an
attack! He may have a horde of Arabs with him!"</p>

<p>"He thinks first of his own desires, and only later of the
safety of his men," muttered Gordon. "I don't think he'll ever get
very far. Come on."</p>

<p>He led the way to the camel, helped the girl into the saddle,
then leaped up himself. A word, a tap of the camel wand, and the
beast ambled silently off down the slope.</p>

<p>"I know Osman caught you at El Awad," said Gordon. "But what's
he up to? What's his game?"</p>

<p>"He was a lieutenant stationed at El Ashraf," she answered. "He
persuaded his company to mutiny, kill their commander and desert.
He plans to fortify the Walls of Sulaiman, and build a new empire.
I thought at first he was mad, but he isn't. He's a devil."</p>

<p>"The Walls of Sulaiman?" Gordon checked his mount and sat for a
moment motionless in the starlight.</p>

<p>"Are you game for an all-night ride?" he asked presently.</p>

<p>"Anywhere! As long as it is far away from Osman!" There was a
hint of hysteria in her voice.</p>

<p>"I doubt if your escape will change his plans. He'll probably
lie about Achmet all night under arms expecting an attack. In the
morning he will decide that I was alone, and pull out for the
Walls.</p>

<p>"Well, I happen to know that an Arab force is there, waiting for
an order from Lawrence to move on to Ageyli. Three hundred Juheina
camel-riders, sworn to Feisal. Enough to eat Osman's gang.
Lawrence's messenger should reach them some time between dawn and
noon. There is a chance we can get there before the Juheina pull
out. If we can, we'll turn them on Osman and wipe him out, with his
whole pack.</p>

<p>"It won't upset Lawrence's plans for the Juheina to get to
Ageyli a day late, and Osman must be destroyed. He's a mad dog
running loose."</p>

<p>"His ambition sounds mad," she murmured. "But when he speaks of
it, with his eyes blazing, it's easy to believe he might even
succeed."</p>

<p>"You forget that crazier things have happened in the desert," he
answered, as he swung the camel eastward. "The world is being made
over here, as well as in Europe. There's no telling what damage
this Osman might do, if left to himself. The Turkish Empire is
falling to pieces, and new empires have risen out of the ruins of
old ones.</p>

<p>"But if we can get to Sulaiman before the Juheina march, we'll
check him. If we find them gone, we'll be in a pickle ourselves.
It's a gamble, our lives against his. Are you game?"</p>

<p>"Till the last card falls!" she retorted. His face was a blur in
the starlight, but she sensed rather than saw his grim smile of
approval.</p>

<p>The camel's hoofs made no sound as they dropped down the slope
and circled far wide of the Turkish camp. Like ghosts on a
ghost-camel they moved across the plain under the stars. A faint
breeze stirred the girl's hair. Not until the fires were dim behind
them and they were again climbing a hill-road did she speak.</p>

<p>"I know you. You're the American they call El Borak, the Swift.
You came down from Afghanistan when the war began. You were with
King Hussein even before Lawrence came over from Egypt. Do you know
who I am?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then what's my status?" she asked. "Have you rescued me or
captured me? Am I a prisoner?"</p>

<p>"Let us say companion, for the time being," he suggested. "We're
up against a common enemy. No reason why we shouldn't make common
cause, is there?"</p>

<p>"None!" she agreed, and leaning her blond head against his hard
shoulder, she went soundly to sleep.</p>

<p>A gaunt moon rose, pushing back the horizons, flooding craggy
slopes and dusty plains with leprous silver. The vastness of the
desert seemed to mock the tiny figures on their tiring camel, as
they rode blindly on toward what Fate they could not guess.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="wolf4" name="wolf4">IV. &mdash; WOLVES OF THE DESERT</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">OLGA awoke as dawn was breaking. She was cold and
stiff, in spite of the cloak Gordon had wrapped about her, and she
was hungry. They were riding through a dry gorge with rock-strewn
slopes rising on either hand, and the camel's gait had become a
lurching walk. Gordon halted it, slid off without making it kneel,
and took its rope.</p>

<p>"It's about done, but the Walls aren't far ahead. Plenty of
water there&mdash;food, too, if the Juheina are still there. There
are dates in that pouch."</p>

<p>If he felt the strain of fatigue he did not show it as he strode
along at the camel's head. Olga rubbed her chill hands and wished
for sunrise.</p>

<p>"The Well of Harith," Gordon indicated a walled enclosure ahead
of them. "The Turks built that wall, years ago, when the Walls of
Sulaiman were an army post. Later they abandoned both
positions."</p>

<p>The wall, built of rocks and dried mud, was in good shape, and
inside the enclosure there was a partly ruined hut. The well was
shallow, with a mere trickle of water at the bottom.</p>

<p>"I'd better get off and walk too," Olga suggested.</p>

<p>"These flints would cut your boots and feet to pieces. It's not
far now. Then the camel can rest all it needs."</p>

<p>"And if the Juheina aren't there&mdash;" She left the sentence
unfinished.</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Maybe Osman won't come up before the camel's rested."</p>

<p>"I believe he'll make a forced march," she said, not fearfully,
but calmly stating an opinion. "His beasts are good. If he drives
them hard, he can get here before midnight. Our camel won't be
rested enough to carry us, by that time. And we couldn't get away
on foot, in this desert."</p>

<p>He laughed, and respecting her courage, did not try to make
light of their position.</p>

<p>"Well," he said quietly, "let's hope the Juheina are still
there!"</p>

<p>If they were not, she and Gordon were caught in a trap of
hostile, waterless desert, fanged with the long guns of predatory
tribesmen.</p>

<p>Three miles further east the valley narrowed and the floor
pitched upward, dotted by dry shrubs and boulders. Gordon pointed
suddenly to a faint ribbon of smoke feathering up into the sky.</p>

<p>"Look! The Juheina are there!"</p>

<p>Olga gave a deep sigh of relief. Only then did she realize how
desperately she had been hoping for some such sign. She felt like
shaking a triumphant fist at the rocky waste about her, as if at a
sentient enemy, sullen and cheated of its prey.</p>

<p>Another mile and they topped a ridge and saw a large enclosure
surrounding a cluster of wells. There were Arabs squatting about
their tiny cooking fires. As the travelers came suddenly into view
within a few hundred yards of them, the Bedouins sprang up,
shouting. Gordon drew his breath suddenly between clenched
teeth.</p>

<p>"They're not Juheina! They're Rualla! Allies of the Turks!"</p>

<p>Too late to retreat. A hundred and fifty wild men were on their
feet, glaring, rifles cocked.</p>

<p>Gordon did the next best thing and went leisurely toward them.
To look at him one would have thought that he had expected to meet
these men here, and anticipated nothing but a friendly greeting.
Olga tried to imitate his tranquility, but she knew their lives
hung on the crook of a trigger finger. These men were supposed to
be her allies, but her recent experience made her distrust
Orientals. The sight of these hundreds of wolfish faces filled her
with sick dread.</p>

<p>They were hesitating, rifles lifted, nervous and uncertain as
surprised wolves, then:</p>

<p>"<i>Allah!</i>" howled a tall, scarred warrior. "It is El
Borak!"</p>

<p>Olga caught her breath as she saw the man's finger quiver on his
rifle- trigger. Only a racial urge to gloat over his victim kept
him from shooting the American then and there.</p>

<p>"El Borak!" The shout was a wave that swept the throng.</p>

<p>Ignoring the clamor, the menacing rifles, Gordon made the camel
kneel and lifted Olga off. She tried, with fair success, to conceal
her fear of the wild figures that crowded about them, but her flesh
crawled at the bloodlust burning redly in each wolfish eye.</p>

<p>Gordon's rifle was in its boot on the saddle, and his pistol was
out of sight, under his shirt. He was careful not to reach for the
rifle&mdash;a move which would have brought a hail of
bullets&mdash;but having helped the girl down, he turned and faced
the crowd casually, his hands empty. Running his glance over the
fierce faces, he singled out a tall stately man in the rich garb of
a <i>shaykh</i>, who was standing somewhat apart.</p>

<p>"You keep poor watch, Mitkhal ibn Ali," said Gordon. "If I had
been a raider your men would be lying in their blood by this
time."</p>

<p>Before the <i>shaykh</i> could answer, the man who had first
recognized Gordon thrust himself violently forward, his face
convulsed with hate.</p>

<p>"You expected to find friends here, El Borak!" he exulted. "But
you come too late! Three hundred Juheina dogs rode north an hour
before dawn! We saw them go, and came up after they had gone. Had
they known of your coming, perhaps they would have stayed to
welcome you!"</p>

<p>"It's not to you I speak, Zangi Khan, you Kurdish dog," retorted
Gordon contemptuously, "but to the Rualla&mdash;honorable men and
fair foes!"</p>

<p>Zangi Khan snarled like a wolf and threw up his rifle, but a
lean Bedouin caught his arm.</p>

<p>"Wait!" he growled. "Let El Borak speak. His words are not
wind."</p>

<p>A rumble of approval came from the Arabs. Gordon had touched
their fierce pride and vanity. That would not save his life, but
they were willing to listen to him before they killed him.</p>

<p>"If you listen he will trick you with cunning words!" shouted
the angered Zangi Khan furiously. "Slay him now, before he can do
us harm!"</p>

<p>"Is Zangi Khan <i>shaykh</i> of the Rualla that he gives
commands while Mitkhal stands silent?" asked Gordon with biting
irony.</p>

<p>Mitkhal reacted to his taunt exactly as Gordon knew he
would.</p>

<p>"Let El Borak speak!" he ordered. "I command here, Zangi Khan!
Do not forget that."</p>

<p>"I do not forget, <i>ya sidi</i>," the Kurd assured him, but his
eyes burned red at the rebuke. "I but spoke in zeal for your
safety."</p>

<p>Mitkhal gave him a slow, searching glance which told Gordon that
there was no love lost between the two men. Zangi Khan's reputation
as a fighting man meant much to the younger warriors. Mitkhal was
more fox than wolf, and he evidently feared the Kurd's influence
over his men. As an agent of the Turkish government Zangi's
authority was theoretically equal to Mitkhal's.</p>

<p>Actually this amounted to little, but Mitkhal's tribesmen took
orders from their <i>shaykh</i> only. But it put Zangi in a
position to use his personal talents to gain an ascendency&mdash;an
ascendency Mitkhal feared would relegate him to a minor
position.</p>

<p>"Speak, El Borak," ordered Mitkhal. "But speak swiftly. It may
be," he added, "Allah's will that the moments of your life are
few."</p>

<p>"Death marches from the west," said Gordon abruptly. "Last night
a hundred Turkish deserters butchered the people of El Awad."</p>

<p>"<i>Wallah!</i>" swore a tribesman. "El Awad was friendly to the
Turks!"</p>

<p>"A lie!" cried Zangi Khan. "Or if true, the dogs of deserters
slew the people to curry favor with Feisal."</p>

<p>"When did men come to Feisal with the blood of children on their
hands?" retorted Gordon. "They have foresworn Islam and worship the
White Wolf. They carried off the young women and the old women, the
men and the children they slew like dogs."</p>

<p>A murmur of anger rose from the Arabs. The Bedouins had a rigid
code of warfare, and they did not kill women or children. It was
the unwritten law of the desert, old when Abraham came up out of
Chaldea.</p>

<p>But Zangi Khan cried out in angry derision, blind to the
resentful looks cast at him. He did not understand that particular
phase of the Bedouins' code, for his people had no such inhibition.
Kurds in war killed women as well as men.</p>

<p>"What are the women of El Awad to us?" he sneered.</p>

<p>"Your heart I know already," answered Gordon with icy contempt.
"It is to the Rualla that I speak."</p>

<p>"A trick!" howled the Kurd. "A lie to trick us!"</p>

<p>"It is no lie!" Olga stepped forward boldly. "Zangi Khan, you
know that I am an agent of the German government. Osman Pasha,
leader of these renegades burned El Awad last night, as El Borak
has said. Osman murdered Ahmed ibn Shalaan, my guide, among others.
He is as much our enemy as he is an enemy of the British."</p>

<p>She looked to Mitkhal for help, but the <i>shaykh</i> stood
apart, like an actor watching a play in which he had not yet
received his cue.</p>

<p>"What if it is the truth?" Zangi Khan snarled, muddled by his
hate and fear of El Borak's cunning. "What is El Awad to us?"</p>

<p>Gordon caught him up instantly.</p>

<p>"This Kurd asks what is the destruction of a friendly village!
Doubtless, naught to him! But what does it mean to you, who have
left your herds and families unguarded? If you let this pack of mad
dogs range the land, how can you be sure of the safety of your
wives and children?"</p>

<p>"What would you have, El Borak?" demanded a grey-bearded
raider.</p>

<p>"Trap these Turks and destroy them. I'll show you how."</p>

<p>It was then that Zangi Khan lost his head completely.</p>

<p>"Heed him not!" he screamed. "Within the hour we must ride
northward! The Turks will give us ten thousand British pounds for
his head!"</p>

<p>Avarice burned briefly in the men's eyes, to be dimmed by the
reflection that the reward, offered for El Borak's head, would be
claimed by the <i>shaykh</i> and Zangi. They made no move and
Mitkhal stood aside with an air of watching a contest that did not
concern himself.</p>

<p>"Take his head!" screamed Zangi, sensing hostility at last, and
thrown into a panic by it.</p>

<p>His demoralization was completed by Gordon's taunting laugh.</p>

<p>"You seem to be the only one who wants my head, Zangi! Perhaps
you can take it!"</p>

<p>Zangi howled incoherently, his eyes glaring red, then threw up
his rifle, hip-high. Just as the muzzle came up, Gordon's automatic
crashed thunderously. He had drawn so swiftly not a man there had
followed his motion. Zangi Khan reeled back under the impact of hot
lead, toppled sideways and lay still.</p>

<p>In an instant a hundred cocked rifles covered Gordon. Confused
by varying emotions, the men hesitated for the fleeting instant it
took Mitkhal to shout:</p>

<p>"Hold! Do not shoot!"</p>

<p>He strode forward with the air of a man ready to take the center
of the stage at last, but he could not disguise the gleam of
satisfaction in his shrewd eyes.</p>

<p>"No man here is kin to Zangi Khan," he said offhandedly. "There
is no cause for blood feud. He had eaten the salt, but he attacked
our prisoner whom he thought unarmed."</p>

<p>He held out his hand for the pistol, but Gordon did not
surrender it.</p>

<p>"I'm not your prisoner," said he. "I could kill you before your
men could lift a finger. But I didn't come here to fight you. I
came asking aid to avenge the children and women of my enemies. I
risk my life for your families. Are you dogs, to do less?"</p>

<p>The question hung in the air unanswered, but he had struck the
right chord in their barbaric bosoms, that were always ready to
respond to some wild deed of reckless chivalry. Their eyes glowed
and they looked at their <i>shaykh</i> expectantly.</p>

<p>Mitkhal was a shrewd politician. The butchery at El Awad meant
much less to him than it meant to his younger warriors. He had
associated with so-called civilized men long enough to lose much of
his primitive integrity. But he always followed the side of public
opinion, and was shrewd enough to lead a movement he could not
check. Yet, he was not to be stampeded into a hazardous
adventure.</p>

<p>"These Turks may be too strong for us," he objected.</p>

<p>"I'll show you how to destroy them with little risk," answered
Gordon. "But there must be covenants between us, Mitkhal."</p>

<p>"These Turks must be destroyed," said Mitkhal, and he spoke
sincerely there, at least. "But there are too many blood feuds
between us, El Borak, for us to let you get out of our hands."</p>

<p>Gordon laughed.</p>

<p>"You can't whip the Turks without my help and you know it. Ask
your young men what they desire!"</p>

<p>"Let El Borak lead us!" shouted a young warrior instantly. A
murmur of approval paid tribute to Gordon's widespread reputation
as a strategist.</p>

<p>"Very well!" Mitkhal took the tide. "Let there be truce between
us&mdash;with conditions! Lead us against the Turks. If you win,
you and the woman shall go free. If we lose, we take your
head!"</p>

<p>Gordon nodded, and the warriors yelled in glee. It was just the
sort of a bargain that appealed to their minds, and Gordon knew it
was the best he could make.</p>

<p>"Bring bread and salt!" ordered Mitkhal, and a giant black slave
moved to do his bidding. "Until the battle is lost or won there is
truce between us, and no Rualla shall harm you, unless you spill
Rualla blood."</p>

<p>Then he thought of something else and his brow darkened as he
thundered:</p>

<p>"Where is the man who watched from the ridge?"</p>

<p>A terrified youth was pushed forward. He was a member of a small
tribe tributary to the more important Rualla.</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>shaykh</i>," he faltered, "I was hungry and stole away
to a fire for meat&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dog!" Mitkhal struck him in the face. "Death is thy portion for
failing in thy duty."</p>

<p>"Wait!" Gordon interposed. "Would you question the will of
Allah? If the boy had not deserted his post he would have seen us
coming up the valley, and your men would have fired on us and
killed us. Then you would not have been warned of the Turks, and
would have fallen prey to them before discovering they were
enemies. Let him go and give thanks to Allah Who sees all!"</p>

<p>It was the sort of sophistry that appeals to the Arab mind. Even
Mitkhal was impressed.</p>

<p>"Who knows the mind of Allah?" he conceded. "Live, Musa, but
next time perform the will of Allah with vigilance and a mind to
orders. And now, El Borak, let us discuss battle-plans while food
is prepared."</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a id="wolf5" name="wolf5">V. &mdash; TREACHERY</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">IT was not yet noon when Gordon halted the Rualla
beside the Well of Harith. Scouts sent westward reported no sign of
the Turks, and the Arabs went forward with the plans made before
leaving the Walls&mdash;plans outlined by Gordon and agreed to by
Mitkhal. First the tribesmen began gathering rocks and hurling them
into the well.</p>

<p>"The water's still beneath," Gordon remarked to Olga. "But it'll
take hours of hard work to clean out the well so that anybody can
get to it. The Turks can't do it under our rifles. If we win, we'll
clean it out ourselves, so the next travelers won't suffer."</p>

<p>"Why not take refuge in the <i>sangar</i> ourselves?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"Too much of a trap. That's what we're using it for. We'd have
no chance with them in open fight, and if we laid an ambush out in
the valley, they'd simply fight their way through us. But when a
man's shot at in the open, his first instinct is to make for the
nearest cover. So I'm hoping to trick them into going into the
<i>sangar</i>. Then we'll bottle them up and pick them off at our
leisure. Without water they can't hold out long. We shouldn't lose
a dozen men, if any."</p>

<p>"It seems strange to see you solicitous about the lives of these
Rualla, who are your enemies, after all," she laughed.</p>

<p>"Instinct, maybe. No man fit to lead wants to lose any more of
them then he can help. Just now these men are my allies, and it's
up to me to protect them as well as I can. I'll admit I'd rather be
fighting with the Juheina. Feisal's messenger must have started for
the Walls hours before I supposed he would."</p>

<p>"And if the Turks surrender, what then?"</p>

<p>"I'll try to get them to Lawrence&mdash;all but Osman Pasha."
Gordon's face darkened. "That man hangs if he falls into my
hands."</p>

<p>"How will you get them to Lawrence? The Rualla won't take
them."</p>

<p>"I haven't the slightest idea. But let's catch our hare before
we start broiling him. Osman may whip the daylights out of us."</p>

<p>"It means your head if he does," she warned with a shudder.</p>

<p>"Well, it's worth ten thousand pounds to the Turks," he laughed,
and moved to inspect the partly ruined hut. Olga followed him.</p>

<p>Mitkhal, directing the blocking of the well, glanced sharply at
them, then noted that a number of men were between them and the
gate, and turned back to his overseeing.</p>

<p>"<i>Hsss</i>, El Borak!" It was a tense whisper, just as Gordon
and Olga turned to leave the hut. An instant later they located a
tousled head thrust up from behind a heap of rubble. It was the boy
Musa who obviously had slipped into the hut through a crevice in
the back wall.</p>

<p>"Watch from the door and warn me if you see anybody coming,"
Gordon muttered to Olga. "This lad may have something to tell."</p>

<p>"I have, <i>effendi</i>!" The boy was trembling with excitement.
"I overheard the <i>shaykh</i> talking secretly to his black slave,
Hassan. I saw them walk away among the palms while you and the
woman were eating, at the Walls, and I crept after them, for I
feared they meant you mischief&mdash;and you saved my life.</p>

<p>"El Borak, listen! Mitkal means to slay you, whether you win
this battle for him or not! He was glad you slew the Kurd, and he
is glad to have your aid in wiping out these Turks. But he lusts
for the gold the other Turks will pay for your head. Yet he dares
not break his word and the covenant of the salt openly. So, if we
win the battle, Hassan is to shoot you, and swear you fell by a
Turkish bullet!"</p>

<p>The boy rushed on with his story:</p>

<p>"Then Mitkhal will say to the people: 'El Borak was our guest
and ate our salt. But now he is dead, through no fault of ours, and
there is no use wasting the reward. So we will take off his head
and take it to Damascus and the Turks will give us ten thousand
pounds.'"</p>

<p>Gordon smiled grimly at Olga's horror. That was typical Arab
logic.</p>

<p>"It didn't occur to Mitkhal that Hassan might miss his first
shot and not get a chance to shoot again, I suppose?" he
suggested.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, <i>effendi</i>, Mitkhal thinks of everything. If you
kill Hassan, Mitkhal will swear you broke the covenant yourself, by
spilling the blood of a Rualla, or a Rualla's servant, which is the
same thing, and will feel free to order you beheaded."</p>

<p>There was genuine humor in Gordon's laugh.</p>

<p>"Thanks, Musa! If I saved your life, you've paid me back. Better
get out now, before somebody sees you talking to us."</p>

<p>"What shall we do?" exclaimed Olga, pale to the lips.</p>

<p>"You're in no danger," he assured her.</p>

<p>She colored angrily.</p>

<p>"I wasn't thinking of that! Do you think I have less gratitude
than that Arab boy? That <i>shaykh</i> means to murder you, don't
you understand? Let's steal camels and run for it!"</p>

<p>"Run where? If we did, they'd be on our heels in no time,
deciding I'd lied to them about everything. Anyway, we wouldn't
have a chance. They're watching us too closely. Besides, I wouldn't
run if I could. I started to wipe out Osman Pasha, and this is the
best chance I see to do it. Come on. Let's get out in the
<i>sangar</i> before Mitkhal gets suspicious."</p>

<p>As soon as the well was blocked the men retired to the
hillsides. Their camels were hidden behind the ridges, and the men
crouched behind rocks and among the stunted shrubs along the
slopes. Olga refused Gordon's offer to send her with an escort back
to the Walls, and stayed with him taking up a position behind a
rock, Osman's pistol in her belt. They lay flat on the ground and
the heat of the sun-baked flints seeped through their garments.</p>

<p>Once she turned her head, and shuddered to see the blank black
countenance of Hassan regarding them from some bushes a few yards
behind them: The black slave, who knew no law but his master's
command, was determined not to let Gordon out of his sight.</p>

<p>She spoke of this in a low whisper to the American.</p>

<p>"Sure," he murmured. "I saw him. But he won't shoot till he
knows which way the fight's going, and is sure none of the men are
looking."</p>

<p>Olga's flesh crawled in anticipation of more horrors. If they
lost the fight the enraged Ruallas would tear Gordon to pieces,
supposing he survived the encounter. If they won, his reward would
be a treacherous bullet in the back.</p>

<p>The hours dragged slowly by. Not a flutter of cloth, no lifting
of an impudent head betrayed the presence of the wild men on the
slopes. Olga began to feel her nerves quiver. Doubts and
forebodings gnawed maddeningly at her.</p>

<p>"We took position too soon! The men will lose patience. Osman
can't get here before midnight. It took us all night to reach the
Well."</p>

<p>"Bedouins never lose patience when they smell loot," he
answered. "I believe Osman will get here before sundown. We made
poor time on a tiring camel for the last few hours of that ride. I
believe Osman broke camp before dawn and pushed hard."</p>

<p>Another thought came to torture her.</p>

<p>"Suppose he doesn't come at all? Suppose he has changed his
plans and gone somewhere else? The Rualla will believe you lied to
them!"</p>

<p>"Look!"</p>

<p>The sun hung low in the west, a fiery, dazzling ball. She
blinked, shading her eyes.</p>

<p>Then the head of a marching column grew out of the dancing
heat-waves: lines of horsemen, grey with dust, files of heavily
laden baggage camels, with the captive women riding them. The
standard hung loose in the breathless air; but once, when a vagrant
gust of wind, hot as the breath of perdition, lifted the folds, the
white wolf's head was displayed.</p>

<p>Crushing proof of idolatry and heresy! In their agitation the
Rualla almost betrayed themselves. Even Mitkhal turned pale.</p>

<p>"Allah! Sacrilege! Forgotten of God. Hell shall be thy
portion!"</p>

<p>"Easy!" hissed Gordon, feeling the semi-hysteria that ran down
the lurking lines. "Wait for my signal. They may halt to water
their camels at the Well."</p>

<p>Osman must have driven his people like a fiend all day. The
women drooped on the loaded camels; the dust-caked faces of the
soldiers were drawn. The horses reeled with weariness. But it was
soon evident that they did not intend halting at the Well with
their goal, the Walls of Sulaiman, so near. The head of the column
was even with the <i>sangar</i> when Gordon fired. He was aiming at
Osman, but the range was long, the sun-glare on the rocks dazzling.
The man behind Osman fell, and at the signal the slopes came alive
with spurting flame.</p>

<p>The column staggered. Horses and men went down and stunned
soldiers gave back a ragged fire that did no harm. They did not
even see their assailants save as bits of white cloth bobbing among
the boulders.</p>

<p>Perhaps discipline had grown lax during the grind of that
merciless march. Perhaps panic seized the tired Turks. At any rate
the column broke and men fled toward the <i>sangar</i> without
waiting for orders. They would have abandoned the baggage camels
had not Osman ridden among them. Cursing and striking with the flat
of his saber, he made them drive the beasts in with them.</p>

<p>"I hoped they'd leave the camels and women outside," grunted
Gordon. "Maybe they'll drive them out when they find there's no
water."</p>

<p>The Turks took their positions in good order, dismounting and
ranging along the wall. Some dragged the Arab women off the camels
and drove them into the hut. Others improvised a pen for the
animals with stakes and ropes between the back of the hut and the
wall. Saddles were piled in the gate to complete the barricade.</p>

<p>The Arabs yelled taunts as they poured in a hail of lead, and a
few leaped up and danced derisively, waving their rifles. But they
stopped that when a Turk drilled one of them cleanly through the
head. When the demonstrations ceased, the besiegers offered scanty
targets to shoot at.</p>

<p>However, the Turks fired back frugally and with no indication of
panic, now that they were under cover and fighting the sort of a
fight they understood. They were well protected by the wall from
the men directly in front of them, but those facing north could be
seen by the men on the south ridge, and vice versa. But the
distance was too great for consistently effective shooting at these
marks by the Arabs.</p>

<p>"We don't seem to be doing much damage," remarked Olga
presently.</p>

<p>"Thirst will win for us," Gordon answered. "All we've got to do
is to keep them bottled up. They probably have enough water in
their canteens to last through the rest of the day. Certainly no
longer. Look, they're going to the well now."</p>

<p>The well stood in the middle of the enclosure, in a
comparatively exposed area, as seen from above. Olga saw men
approaching it with canteens in their hands, and the Arabs, with
sardonic enjoyment, refrained from firing at them. They reached the
well, and then the girl saw the change come over them. It ran
through their band like an electric shock. The men along the walls
reacted by firing wildly. A furious yelling rose, edged with
hysteria, and men began to run madly about the enclosure. Some
toppled, hit by shots dropping from the ridges.</p>

<p>"What are they doing?" Olga started to her knees, and was
instantly jerked down again by Gordon. The Turks were running into
the hut. If she had been watching Gordon she would have sensed the
meaning of it, for his dark face grew suddenly grim.</p>

<p>"They're dragging the women out!" she exclaimed. "I see Osman
waving his saber. What? Oh, God! They're butchering the women!"</p>

<p>Above the crackle of shots rose terrible shrieks and the
sickening <i>chack</i> of savagely driven blows. Olga turned sick
and hid her face. Osman had realized the trap into which he had
been driven, and his reaction was that of a mad dog. Recognizing
defeat in the blocked well, facing the ruin of his crazy ambitions
by thirst and Bedouin bullets, he was taking this vengeance on the
whole Arab race.</p>

<p>On all sides the Arabs rose howling, driven to frenzy by the
sight of that slaughter. That these women were of another tribe
made no difference. A stern chivalry was the foundation of their
society, just as it was among the frontiersmen of early America.
There was no sentimentalism about it. It was real and vital as life
itself.</p>

<p>The Rualla went berserk when they saw women of their race
falling under the swords of the Turks. A wild yell shattered the
brazen sky, and recklessly breaking cover, the Arabs pelted down
the slopes, howling like fiends. Gordon could not check them, nor
could Mitkhal. Their shouts fell on deaf ears. The walls vomited
smoke and flame as withering volleys raked the oncoming hordes.
Dozens fell, but enough were left to reach the wall and sweep over
it in a wave that neither lead nor steel could halt.</p>

<p>And Gordon was among them. When he saw he could not stop the
storm he joined it. Mitkhal was not far behind him, cursing his men
as he ran. The <i>shaykh</i> had no stomach for this kind of
fighting, but his leadership was at stake. No man who hung back in
this charge would ever be able to command the Rualla again.</p>

<p>Gordon was among the first to reach the wall, leaping over the
writhing bodies of half a dozen Arabs. He had not blazed away
wildly as he ran like the Bedouins, to reach the wall with an empty
gun. He held his fire until the flame spurts from the barrier were
almost burning his face, and then emptied his rifle in a
point-blank fusilade that left a bloody gap where there had been a
line of fierce dark faces an instant before. Before the gap could
be closed he had swarmed over and in, and the Rualla poured after
him.</p>

<p>As his feet hit the ground a rush of men knocked him against the
wall and a blade, thrusting for his life, broke against the rocks.
He drove his shortened butt into a snarling face, splintering teeth
and bones, and the next instant a surge of his own men over the
wall cleared a space about him. He threw away his broken rifle and
drew his pistol.</p>

<p>The Turks had been forced back from the wall in a dozen places
now, and men were fighting all over the <i>sangar</i>. No quarter
was asked&mdash;none given. The pitiful headless bodies sprawled
before the blood-stained hut had turned the Bedouins into hot-eyed
demons. The guns were empty now, all but Gordon's automatic. The
yells had died down to grunts, punctuated by death-howls. Above
these sounds rose the chopping impact of flailing blades, the
crunch of fiercely driven rifle butts. So grimly had the Bedouins
suffered in that brainless rush, that now they were outnumbered,
and the Turks fought with the fury of desperation.</p>

<p>It was Gordon's automatic, perhaps, that tipped the balance. He
emptied it without haste and without hesitation, and at that range
he could not miss. He was aware of a dark shadow forever behind
him, and turned once to see black Hassan following him, smiting
methodically right and left with a heavy scimitar already dripping
crimson. Even in the fury of the strife, Gordon grinned. The
literal-minded Soudanese was obeying instructions to keep at El
Borak's heels. As long as the battle hung in doubt, he was Gordon's
protector&mdash;ready to become his executioner the instant the
tide turned in their favor.</p>

<p>"Faithful servant," called Gordon sardonically. "Have a care
lest these Turks cheat you of my head!"</p>

<p>Hassan grinned, speechless. Suddenly blood burst from his thick
lips and he buckled at the knees. Somewhere in that rush down the
hill his black body had stopped a bullet. As he struggled on all
fours a Turk ran in from the side and brained him with a
rifle-butt. Gordon killed the Turk with his last bullet. He felt no
grudge against Hassan. The man had been a good soldier, and had
obeyed orders given him.</p>

<p>The <i>sangar</i> was a shambles. The men on their feet were
less than those on the ground, and all were streaming blood. The
white wolf standard had been torn from its staff and lay trampled
under vengeful feet. Gordon bent, picked up a saber and looked
about for Osman. He saw Mitkhal, running toward the horse-pen, and
then he yelled a warning, for he saw Osman.</p>

<p>The man broke away from a group of struggling figures and ran
for the pen. He tore away the ropes and the horses, frantic from
the noise and smell of blood, stampeded into the <i>sangar</i>,
knocking men down and trampling them. As they thundered past,
Osman, with a magnificent display of agility, caught a handful of
flying mane and leaped on the back of the racing steed.</p>

<p>Mitkhal ran toward him, yelling furiously, and snapping a pistol
at him. The <i>shaykh</i>, in the confusion of the fighting, did
not seem to be aware that the gun was empty, for he pulled the
trigger again and again as he stood in the path of the oncoming
rider. Only at the last moment did he realize his peril and leap
back. Even so, he would have sprung clear had not his sandal heel
caught in a dead man's <i>abba</i>.</p>

<p>Mitkhal stumbled, avoided the lashing hoofs, but not the
down-flailing saber in Osman's hand. A wild cry went up from the
Rualla as Mitkhal fell, his turban suddenly crimson. The next
instant Osman was out of the gate and riding like the
wind&mdash;straight up the hillside to where he saw the slim figure
of the girl to whom he now attributed his overthrow.</p>

<p>Olga had come out from behind the rocks and was standing in
stunned horror watching the fight below. Now she awoke suddenly to
her own peril at the sight of the madman charging up the slope. She
drew the pistol Gordon had taken from him and opened fire. She was
not a very good shot. Three bullets missed, the fourth killed the
horse, and then the gun jammed. Gordon was running up the slope as
the Apaches of his native Southwest run, and behind him streamed a
swarm of Rualla. There was not a loaded gun in the whole horde.</p>

<p>Osman took a shocking fall when his horse turned a somersault
under him, but rose, bruised and bloody, with Gordon still some
distance away. But the Turk had to play hide-and-seek for a few
moments among the rocks with his prey before he was able to grasp
her hair and twist her screaming to her knees and then he paused an
instant to enjoy her despair and terror. That pause was his
undoing.</p>

<p>As he lifted his saber to strike off her head, steel clanged
loud on steel. A numbing shock ran through his arm and his blade
was knocked from his hand. His weapon rang on the hot flints. He
whirled to face the blazing slits that were El Borak's eyes. The
muscles stood out in cords and ridges on Gordon's sunburnt forearm
in the intensity of his passion.</p>

<p>"Pick it up, you filthy dog," he said between his teeth.</p>

<p>Osman hesitated, stooped, caught up the saber and slashed at
Gordon's legs without straightening. Gordon leaped back, then
sprang in again the instant his toes touched the earth. His return
was as paralyzingly quick as the death-leap of a wolf. It caught
Osman off balance, his sword extended. Gordon's blade hissed as it
cut the air, slicing through flesh, gritting through bone.</p>

<p>The Turk's head toppled from the severed neck and fell at
Gordon's feet, the headless body collapsing in a heap. With an
excess spasm of hate, Gordon kicked the head savagely down the
slope.</p>

<p>"Oh!" Olga turned away and hid her face. But the girl knew that
Osman deserved any fate that could have overtaken him. Presently
she was aware of Gordon's hand resting lightly on her shoulder and
she looked up, ashamed of her weakness. The sun was just dipping
below the western ridges. Musa came limping up the slope,
blood-stained but radiant.</p>

<p>"The dogs are all dead, <i>effendi</i>!" he cried, industriously
shaking a plundered watch, in an effort to make it run. "Such of
our warriors as still live are faint from strife, and many sorely
wounded. There is none to command now but thou."</p>

<p>"Sometimes problems settle themselves," mused Gordon. "But at a
ghastly price. If the Rualla hadn't made that rush, which was the
death of Hassan and Mitkhal&mdash;oh, well, such things are in the
hands of Allah, as the Arabs say. A hundred better men than I have
died today, but by the decree of some blind Fate, I live."</p>

<p>Gordon looked down on the wounded men. He turned to Musa.</p>

<p>"We must load the wounded on camels," he said, "and take them to
the camp at the Walls where there's water and shade. Come."</p>

<p>As they started down the slope he said to Olga, "I'll have to
stay with them till they're settled at the Walls, then I must start
for the coast. Some of the Rualla will be able to ride, though, and
you need have no fear of them. They'll escort you to the nearest
Turkish outpost."</p>

<p>She looked at him in surprise.</p>

<p>"Then I'm not your prisoner?"</p>

<p>He laughed.</p>

<p>"I think you can help Feisal more by carrying out your original
instructions of supplying misleading information to the Turks! I
don't blame you for not confiding even in me. You have my deepest
admiration, for you're playing the most dangerous game a woman
can."</p>

<p>"Oh!" She felt a sudden warm flood of relief and gladness that
he should know she was not really an enemy. Musa was well out of
ear-shot. "I might have known you were high enough in Feisal's
councils to know that I really am&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Gloria Willoughby, the cleverest, most daring secret agent the
British government employs," he murmured. The girl impulsively
placed her slender fingers in his, and hand in hand they went down
the slope together.</p>
