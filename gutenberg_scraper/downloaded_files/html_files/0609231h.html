<h2>The Beast With Five Fingers</h2>

<h4>by</h4>

<h3>W.F. Harvey</h3>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>The story, I suppose, begins with Adrian Borlsover, whom I met
when I was a little boy and he an old man. My father had called
to appeal for a subscription, and before he left, Mr. Borlsover
laid his right hand in blessing on my head. I shall never forget
the awe in which I gazed up at his face and realized for the
first time that eyes might be dark and beautiful and shining and
yet not able to see.</p>

<p>For Adrian Borlsover was blind.</p>

<p>He was an extraordinary man, who came of an eccentric stock.
Borlsover sons for some reason always seemed to marry very
ordinary women, which perhaps accounted for the fact that no
Borlsover had been a genius and only one Borlsover had been mad.
But they were great champions of little causes, generous patrons
of odd sciences, founders of querulous sects, trustworthy guides
to the bypath meadows of erudition.</p>

<p>Adrian was an authority on the fertilization of orchids. He
had held at one time the family living at Borlsover Conyers,
until a congenital weakness of the lungs obliged him to seek a
less rigorous climate in the sunny south-west watering-place
where I had seen him. Occasionally he would relieve one or other
of the local clergy. My father described him as a fine preacher,
who gave long and inspiring sermons from what many men would have
considered unprofitable texts. "An excellent proof," he would
add, "of the truth of the doctrine of direct verbal
inspiration."</p>

<p>Adrian Borlsover was exceedingly clever with his hands. His
penmanship was exquisite. He illustrated all his scientific
papers, made his own woodcuts, and carved the reredos that is at
present the chief feature of interest in the church at Borlsover
Conyers. He had an exceedingly clever knack in cutting
silhouettes for young ladies and paper pigs and cows for little
children, and made more than one complicated wind instrument of
his own devising.</p>

<p>When he was fifty years old Adrian Borlsover lost his sight.
In a wonderfully short time he adapted himself to the new
conditions of life. He quickly learn to read Braille. So
marvellous indeed was his sense of touch, that he was still able
to maintain his interest in botany. The mere passing of his long
supple fingers over a flower was sufficient means for its
identification, though occasionally he would use his lips. I have
found several letters of his among my father's correspondence; in
no case was there anything to show that he was afflicted with
blindness, and this in spite of the fact that he exercised undue
economy in the spacing of lines. Towards the close of his life
Adrian Borlsover was credited with powers of touch that seemed
almost uncanny. It has been said that he could tell at once the
colour of a ribbon placed between his fingers. My father would
neither confirm nor deny the story.</p>

<p>Adrian Borlsover was a bachelor. His elder brother, Charles,
had married late in life, leaving one son, Eustace, who lived in
the gloomy Georgian mansion at Borlsover Conyers, where he could
work undisturbed in collecting material for his great book on
heredity.</p>

<p>Like his uncle, he was a remarkable man. The Borlsovers had
always been born naturalists, but Eustace possessed in a special
degree the power of systematizing his knowledge. He had received
his university education in Germany; and then, after
post-graduate work in Vienna and Naples, had travelled for four
years in South America and the East, getting together a huge
store of material for a new study into the processes of
variation.</p>

<p>He lived alone at Borlsover Conyers with Saunders, his
secretary, a man who bore a somewhat dubious reputation in the
district, but whose powers as a mathematician, combined with his
business abilities, were invaluable to Eustace.</p>

<p>Uncle and nephew saw little of each other. The visits of
Eustace were confined to a week in the summer or
autumn&mdash;tedious weeks, that dragged almost as slowly as the
bath-chair in which the old man was drawn along the sunny
sea-front. In their way the two men were fond of each other,
though their intimacy would, doubtless, have been greater had
they shared the same religious views. Adrian held to the
old-fashioned evangelical dogmas of his early manhood; his nephew
for many years had been thinking of embracing Buddhism. Both men
possessed, too, the reticence the Borlsovers had always shown,
and which their enemies sometimes called hypocrisy. With Adrian
it was a reticence as to the things he had left undone; but with
Eustace it seemed that the curtain which he was so careful to
leave undrawn hid something more than a half-empty chamber.</p>

<p>Two years before his death Adrian Borlsover developed, unknown
to himself, the not uncommon power of automatic writing. Eustace
made the discovery by accident, Adrian was sitting reading in
bed, the forefinger of his left hand tracing the Braille
characters, when his nephew noticed that a pencil the old man
held in his right hand was moving slowly along the opposite page.
He left his seat in the window and sat down beside the bed. The
right had continued to move and now he could see plainly that
they were letters and words which it was forming.</p>

<p>"Adrian Borlsover," wrote the hand, "Eustace Borlsover,
Charles Borlsover, Francis Borlsover, Sigismund Borlsover, Adrian
Borlsover, Eustace Borlsover, Saville Borlsover. B for Borlsover.
Honesty is the Best Policy. Beautiful Belinda Borlsover."</p>

<p>"What curious nonsense!" said Eustace to himself.</p>

<p>"King George ascended the throne in 1760," wrote the hand.
"Crowd, a noun of multitude; a collection of individuals. Adrian
Borlsover, Eustace Borlsover."</p>

<p>"It seems to me," said his uncle, closing the book, "that you
had much better make the most of the afternoon sunshine and take
your walk now."</p>

<p>"I think perhaps I will," Eustace answered as he picked up the
volume. "I won't go far, and when I come back I can read to you
those articles in <i>Nature</i> about which we were
speaking."</p>

<p>He went along the promenade, but stopped at the first shelter
and, seating himself in the corner best protected from the wind,
he examined the book at leisure. Nearly every page was scored
with a meaningless jumble of pencil-marks; rows of capital
letters, short words, long words, complete sentences, copy-book
tags. The whole thing, in fact, had the appearance of a
copy-book, and, on a more careful scrutiny, Eustace thought that
there was ample evidence to show that the handwriting at the
beginning of the book, good though it was, was not nearly so good
as the handwriting at the end.</p>

<p>He left his uncle at the end of October with a promise to
return early in December. It seemed to him quite clear that the
old man's power of automatic writing was developing rapidly, and
for the first time he looked forward to a visit that would
combine duty with interest.</p>

<p>But on his return he was at first disappointed. His uncle, he
thought, looked older. He was listless, too, preferring others to
read to him and dictating nearly all his letters. Not until the
day before he left had Eustace an opportunity of observing Adrian
Borlsover's new-found faculty.</p>

<p>The old man, propped up in bed with pillows, had sunk into a
light sleep. His two hands lay on the coverlet, his left hand
tightly clasping his right. Eustace took an empty manuscript-book
and placed a pencil within reach of the fingers of the right
hand. They snatched at it eagerly, then dropped the pencil to
loose the left hand from its restraining grasp.</p>

<p>"Perhaps to prevent interference I had better hold that hand,"
said Eustace to himself, as he watched the pencil. Almost
immediately it began to write.</p>

<p>"Blundering Borlsovers, unnecessarily unnatural,
extraordinarily eccentric, culpably curious."</p>

<p>"Who are you?" asked Eustace in a low voice.</p>

<p>"Never you mind," wrote the hand of Adrian.</p>

<p>"Is it my uncle who is writing?"</p>

<p>"O my prophetic soul, mine uncle!"</p>

<p>"Is it anyone I know?"</p>

<p>"Silly Eustace, you'll see me very soon."</p>

<p>"When shall I see you?"</p>

<p>"When poor old Adrian's dead."</p>

<p>"Where shall I see you?"</p>

<p>"Where shall you not?"</p>

<p>Instead of speaking his next question, Eustace wrote it: "What
is the time?"</p>

<p>The fingers dropped the pencil and moved three or four times
across the paper. Then, picking up the pencil, they wrote: "Ten
minutes before four. Put your book away, Eustace. Adrian mustn't
find us working at this sort of thing. He doesn't know what to
make of it, and I won't have poor old Adrian disturbed. Au
revoir!"</p>

<p>Adrian Borlsover awoke with a start.</p>

<p>"I've been dreaming again," he said; "such queer dreams of
leaguered cities and forgotten towns. You were mixed up in this
one, Eustace, though I can't remember how. Eustace, I want to
warn you. Don't walk in doubtful paths. Choose your friends well.
Your poor grandfather..."</p>

<p>A fit of coughing put an end to what he was saying, but
Eustace saw that the hand was still writing. He managed unnoticed
to draw the book away. "I'll light the gas," he said, "and ring
for tea." On the other side of the bed-curtain he saw the last
sentences that had been written.</p>

<p>"It's too late, Adrian," he read. "We're friends already,
aren't we, Eustace Borlsover?"</p>

<p>On the following day Eustace left. He thought his uncle looked
ill when he said goodbye, and the old man spoke despondently of
the failure his life had been.</p>

<p>"Nonsense, uncle," said his nephew. "You have got over your
difficulties in a way not one in a hundred thousand would have
done. Everyone marvels at your splendid perseverance in teaching
your hands to take the place of your lost sight. To me it's been
a revelation of the possibilities of education."</p>

<p>"Education," said his uncle dreamily, as if the word had
started a new train of thought. "Education is good so long as you
know to whom and for what purpose you give it. But with the lower
orders of men, the baser and more sordid spirits, I have grave
doubts as to its results. Well, good-bye, Eustace; I may not see
you again. You are a true Borlsover, with all the Borlsover
faults. Marry, Eustace. Marry some good, sensible girl. And if by
any chance I don't see you again, my will is at my solicitor's.
I've not left you any legacy, because I know you're well provided
for; but I thought you might like to have my books. Oh, and
there's just one other thing. You know, before the end people
often lose control over themselves and make absurd requests.
Don't pay any attention to them, Eustace. Good-bye!" and he held
out his hand. Eustace took it. It remained in his a fraction of a
second longer than he had expected and gripped him with a
virility that was surprising. There was, too, in its touch a
subtle sense of intimacy.</p>

<p>"Why, uncle," he said, "I shall see you alive and well for
many long years to come."</p>

<h5>* * * * *</h5>

<p>Two months later Adrian Borlsover died.</p>

<p>Eustace Borlsover was in Naples at the time. He read the
obituary notice in the <i>Morning Post</i> on the day announced
for the funeral.</p>

<p>"Poor old fellow!" he said. "I wonder whether I shall find
room for all his books."</p>

<p>The question occurred to him again with greater force when,
three days later, he found himself standing in the library at
Borlsover Conyers, a huge room built for use and not for beauty
in the year of Waterloo by a Borlsover who was an ardent admirer
of the great Napoleon. It was arranged on the plan of many
college libraries, with tall projecting bookcases forming deep
recesses of dusty silence, fit graves for the old hates of
forgotten controversy, the dead passions of forgotten lives. At
the end of the room, behind the bust of some unknown
eighteenth-century divine, an ugly iron corkscrew stair led to a
shelf-lined gallery. Nearly every shelf was full.</p>

<p>"I must talk to Saunders about it," said Eustace. "I suppose
that we shall have to have the billiard-room fitted up with
bookcases."</p>

<p>The two men met for the first time after many weeks in the
dining-room that evening.</p>

<p>"Hallo!" said Eustace, standing before the fire with his hands
in his pockets. "How goes the world, Saunders? Why these dress
togs?" He himself was wearing an old shooting-jacket. He did not
believe in mourning, as he had told his uncle on his last visit;
and, though he usually went in for quiet-coloured ties, he wore
this evening one of an ugly red, in order to shock Morton, the
butler, and to make them thrash out the whole question of
mourning for themselves in the servants' hall. Eustace was a true
Borlsover. "The world," said Saunders, "goes the same as usual,
confoundedly slow. The dress togs are accounted for by an
invitation from Captain Lockwood to bridge."</p>

<p>"How are you getting there?"</p>

<p>"There's something the matter with the car, so I've told
Jackson to drive me round in the dogcart. Any objection?"</p>

<p>"Oh, dear me, no! We've had all things in common for far too
many years for me to raise objections at this hour of the
day."</p>

<p>"You'll find your correspondence in the library," went on
Saunders. "Most of it I've seen to. There are a few private
letters I haven't opened. There's also a box with a rat or
something inside it that came by the evening post. Very likely
it's the six-toed beast Terry was sending us to cross with the
four-toed albino. I didn't look because I didn't want to mess up
my things; but I should gather from the way it's jumping about
that it's pretty hungry."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll see to it," said Eustace, "while you and the captain
earn an honest penny."</p>

<p>Dinner over and Saunders gone, Eustace went into the library.
Though the fire had been lit, the room was by no means
cheerful.</p>

<p>"We'll have all the lights on, at any rate," he said, as he
turned the switches. "And, Morton," he added, when the butler
brought the coffee, "get me a screwdriver or something to undo
this box. Whatever the animal is, he's kicking up the deuce of a
row. What is it? Why are you dawdling?"</p>

<p>"If you please, sir, when the postman brought it, he told me
that they'd bored the holes in the lid at the post office. There
were no breathing holes in the lid, sir, and they didn't want the
animal to die. That is all, sir."</p>

<p>"It's culpably careless of the man, whoever he was," said
Eustace, as he removed the screws, "packing an animal like this
in a wooden box with no means of getting air. Confound it all! I
meant to ask Morton to bring me a cage to put it in. Now I
suppose I shall have to get one myself."</p>

<p>He placed a heavy book on the lid from which the screws had
been removed, and went into the billiard-room. As he came back
into the library with an empty cage in his hand, he heard the
sound of something falling, and then of something scuttling along
the floor.</p>

<p>"Bother it! The beast's got out. How in the world am I to find
it again in this library?"</p>

<p>To search for it did indeed seem hopeless. He tried to follow
the sound of the scuttling in one of the recesses, where the
animal seemed to be running behind the books in the shelves; but
it was impossible to locate it. Eustace resolved to go on quietly
reading. Very likely the animal might gain confidence and show
itself. Saunders seemed to have dealt in his usual methodical
manner with most of the correspondence. There were still the
private letters.</p>

<p>What was that? Two sharp clicks and the lights in the hideous
candelabras that hung from the ceiling suddenly went out.</p>

<p>"I wonder if something has gone wrong with the fuse," said
Eustace, as he went to the switches by the door. Then he stopped.
There was a noise at the other end of the room, as if something
was crawling up the iron corkscrew stair. "If it's gone into the
gallery," he said, "well and good." He hastily turned on the
lights, crossed the room, and climbed up the stair. But he could
see nothing. His grandfather had placed a little gate at the top
of the stair, so that children could run and romp in the gallery
without fear of accident. This Eustace closed, and, having
considerably narrowed the circle of his search, returned to his
desk by the fire.</p>

<p>How gloomy the library was! There was no sense of intimacy
about the room. The few busts that an eighteenth-century
Borlsover had brought back from the grand tour might have been in
keeping in the old library. Here they seemed out of place. They
made the room feel cold in spite of the heavy red damask curtain
and great gilt cornices.</p>

<p>With a crash two heavy books fell from the gallery to the
floor; then, as Borlsover looked, another, and yet another.</p>

<p>"Very well. You'll starve for this, my beauty!" he said.
"We'll do some little experiments on the metabolism of rats
deprived of water. Go on! Chuck them down! I think I've got the
upper hand." He turned once more to his correspondence. The
letter was from the family solicitor. It spoke of his uncle's
death, and of the valuable collection of books that had been left
to him in the will.</p>

<blockquote>There was one request [he read] which certainly came
as a surprise to me. As you know, Mr. Adrian Borlsover had left
instructions that his body was to be buried in as simple a manner
as possible at Eastbourne. He expressed a desire that there
should be neither wreaths nor flowers of any kind, and hoped that
his friends and relatives would not consider it necessary to wear
mourning. The day before his death we received a letter
cancelling these instructions. He wished the body to be embalmed
(he gave us the address of the man we were to
employ&mdash;Pennifer, Ludgate Hill), with orders that his right
hand should be sent to you stating that it was at your special
request. The other arrangements about the funeral remained
unaltered.</blockquote>

<p>"Good Lord," said Eustace, "what in the world was the old boy
driving at? And what in the name of all that's holy is that?"</p>

<p>Someone was in the gallery. Someone had pulled the cord
attached to one of the blinds, and it had rolled up with a snap.
Someone must be in the gallery, for a second blind did the same.
Someone must be walking round the gallery, for one after the
other the blinds sprang up, letting in the moonlight.</p>

<p>"I haven't got to the bottom of this yet," said Eustace, "but
I will do, before the night is very much older"; and he hurried
up the corkscrew stair. He had just got to the top, when the
lights went out a second time, and he heard again the scuttling
along the floor. Quickly he stole on tiptoe in the dim moonshine
in the direction of the noise, feeling, as he went, for one of
the switches. His fingers touched the metal knob at last. He
turned on the electric light.</p>

<p>About ten yards in front of him, crawling along the floor, was
a man's hand. Eustace stared at it in utter amazement. It was
moving quickly in the manner of a geometer caterpillar, the
fingers humped up one moment, flattened out the next; the thumb
appeared to give a crablike motion to the whole. While he was
looking, too surprised to stir, the hand disappeared round the
corner. Eustace ran forward. He no longer saw it, but he could
hear it, as it squeezed its way behind the books on one of the
shelves. A heavy volume had been displaced. There was a gap in
the row of books, where it had got in. In his fear lest it should
escape him again, he seized the first book that came to his hand
and plugged it into the hole. Then, emptying two shelves of their
contents, he took the wooden boards and propped them up in front
to make his barrier doubly sure.</p>

<p>"I wish Saunders was back," he said; "one can't tackle this
sort of thing alone." It was after eleven, and there seemed
little likelihood of Saunders returning before twelve. He did not
dare to leave the shelf unwatched, even to run downstairs to ring
the bell. Morton, the butler, often used to come round about
eleven to see that the windows were fastened, but he might not
come. Eustace was thoroughly unstrung. At last he heard steps
down below.</p>

<p>"Morton!" he shouted. "Morton!"</p>

<p>"Sir?"</p>

<p>"Has Mr. Saunders got back yet?"</p>

<p>"Not yet, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, bring me some brandy, and hurry up about it. I'm up in
the gallery, you duffer."</p>

<p>"Thanks," said Eustace, as he emptied the glass. "Don't go to
bed yet, Morton. There are a lot of books that have fallen down
by accident. Bring them up and put them back in their
shelves."</p>

<p>Morton had never seen Borlsover in so talkative a mood as on
that night. "Here," said Eustace, when the books had been put
back and dusted, "you might hold up these boards for me, Morton.
That beast in the box got out, and I've been chasing it all over
the place."</p>

<p>"I think I can hear it clawing at the books, sir. They're not
valuable, I hope? I think that's the carriage, sir; I'll go and
call Mr. Saunders."</p>

<p>It seemed to Eustace that he was away for five minutes, but it
could hardly have been more than one, when he returned with
Saunders. "All right, Morton, you can go now. I'm up here,
Saunders."</p>

<p>"What's all the row?" asked Saunders, as he lounged forward
with his hands in his pockets. The luck had been with him all the
evening. He was completely satisfied, both with himself and with
Captain Lockwood's taste in wines. "What's the matter? You look
to me to be in an absolutely blue funk."</p>

<p>"That old devil of an uncle of mine," began Eustace&mdash;"Oh,
I can't explain it all. It's his hand that's been playing Old
Harry all the evening. But I've got it cornered behind these
books. You've got to help me to catch it."</p>

<p>"What's up with you, Eustace? What's the game?"</p>

<p>"It's no game, you silly idiot! If you don't believe me, take
out one of those books and put your hand in and feel."</p>

<p>"All right," said Saunders; "but wait till I've rolled up my
sleeve. The accumulated dust of centuries, eh?" He took off his
coat, knelt down, and thrust his arm along the shelf.</p>

<p>"There's something there right enough," he said. "It's got a
funny, stumpy end to it, whatever it is, and nips like a crab.
Ah! No, you don't!" He pulled his hand out in a flash. "Shove in
a book quickly. Now it can't get out."</p>

<p>"What was it?" asked Eustace.</p>

<p>"Something that wanted very much to get hold of me. I felt
what seemed like a thumb and forefinger. Give me some
brandy."</p>

<p>"How are we to get it out of there?"</p>

<p>"What about a landing-net?"</p>

<p>"No good. It would be too smart for us. I tell you, Saunders,
it can cover the ground far faster than I can walk. But I think I
see how we can manage it. The two books at the ends of the shelf
are big ones, that go right back against the wall. The others are
very thin. I'll take out one at a time, and you slide the rest
along, until we have it squashed between the end two."</p>

<p>It certainly seemed to be the best plan. One by one as they
took out the books, the space behind grew smaller and smaller.
There was something in it that was certainly very much alive.
Once they caught sight of fingers feeling for a way of escape. At
last they had it pressed between the two big books.</p>

<p>"There's muscle there, if there isn't warm flesh and blood,"
said Saunders, as he held them together. "It seems to be a hand
right enough, too. I suppose this is a sort of infectious
hallucination. I've read about such cases before."</p>

<p>"Infectious fiddlesticks!" said Eustace, his face white with
anger; "bring the thing downstairs. We'll get it back into the
box."</p>

<p>It was not altogether easy, but they were successful at last.
"Drive in the screws," said Eustace; "we won't run any risks. Put
the box in this old desk of mine. There's nothing in it that I
want. Here's the key. Thank goodness there's nothing wrong with
the lock."</p>

<p>"Quite a lively evening," said Saunders. "Now let's hear more
about your uncle."</p>

<p>They sat up together until early morning. Saunders had no
desire for sleep. Eustace was trying to explain and to forget; to
conceal from himself a fear that he had never felt
before&mdash;the fear of walking alone down the long corridor to
his bedroom.</p>

<h5>* * * * *</h5>

<p>"Whatever it was," said Eustace to Saunders on the following
morning, "I propose that we drop the subject. There's nothing to
keep us here for the next ten days. We'll motor up to the Lakes
and get some climbing."</p>

<p>"And see nobody all day, and sit bored to death with each
other every night. Not for me, thanks. Why not run up to town?
Run's the exact word in this case, isn't it? We're both in such a
blessed funk. Pull yourself together, Eustace, and let's have
another look at the hand."</p>

<p>"As you like," said Eustace; "there's the key."</p>

<p>They went into the library and opened the desk. The box was as
they had left it on the previous night.</p>

<p>"What are you waiting for?" asked Eustace.</p>

<p>"I am waiting for you to volunteer to open the lid. However,
since you seem to funk it, allow me. There doesn't seem to be the
likelihood of any rumpus this morning at all events." He opened
the lid and picked out the hand.</p>

<p>"Cold?" asked Eustace.</p>

<p>"Tepid. A bit below blood heat by the feel. Soft and supple
too. If it's the embalming, it's a sort of embalming I've never
seen before. Is it your uncle's hand?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, it's his all right," said Eustace. "I should know
those long thin fingers anywhere. Put it back in the box,
Saunders. Never mind about the screws. I'll lock the desk, so
that there'll be no chance of its getting out. We'll compromise
by motoring up to town for a week. If we can get off soon after
lunch, we ought to be at Grantham or Stamford by night."</p>

<p>"Right," said Saunders, "and tomorrow&mdash;oh, well, by
tomorrow we shall have forgotten all about this beastly
thing."</p>

<p>If, when the morrow came, they had not forgotten, it was
certainly true that at the end of the week they were able to tell
a very vivid ghost-story at the little supper Eustace gave on
Hallow E'en.</p>

<p>"You don't want us to believe that it's true, Mr. Borlsover?
How perfectly awful!"</p>

<p>"I'll take my oath on it, and so would Saunders here; wouldn't
you, old chap?"</p>

<p>"Any number of oaths," said Saunders. "It was a long thin
hand, you know, and it gripped me just like that."</p>

<p>"Don't, Mr. Saunders! Don't! How perfectly horrid! Now tell us
another one, do! Only a really creepy one, please."</p>

<p>"Here's a pretty mess!" said Eustace on the following day, as
he threw a letter across the table to Saunders. "It's your
affair, though. Mrs. Merrit, if I understand it, gives a month's
notice."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's quite absurd on Mrs. Merrit's part," replied
Saunders. "She doesn't know what she's talking about. Let's see
what she says."</p>

<blockquote>Dear Sir [he read].     This is to let you know that
I must give you a month's notice as from Tuesday, the 13th. For a
long time I've felt the place too big for me; but when Jane
Parfit and Emma Laidlaw go off with scarcely as much as an "If
you please", after frightening the wits out of the other girls,
so that they can't turn out a room by themselves or walk alone
down the stairs for fear of treading on half-frozen toads or
hearing it run along the passages at night, all I can say is that
it's no place for me. So I must ask you, Mr. Borlsover, sir, to
find a new housekeeper, that has no objection to large and lonely
houses, which some people do say, not that I believe them for a
minute, my poor mother always having been a Wesleyan, are
haunted.

<div style="text-align: right; margin-right:20%">Yours
faithfully,</div>

<div style="text-align: right; margin-right:10%"><span class=
"smcap">Elizabeth Merrit</span></div>

P.S.&mdash;I should be obliged if you would give my respects to
Mr. Saunders. I hope that he won't run any risks with his
cold.</blockquote>

<p>"Saunders," said Eustace, "you've always had a wonderful way
with you in dealing with servants. You mustn't let poor old
Merrit go."</p>

<p>"Of course she shan't go," said Saunders. "She's probably only
angling for a rise in salary. I'll write to her this
morning."</p>

<p>"No. There's nothing like a personal interview. We've had
enough of town. We'll go back to-morrow, and you must work your
cold for all its worth. Don't forget that it's got on to the
chest, and will require weeks of feeding up and nursing."</p>

<p>"All right, I think I can manage Mrs. Merrit."</p>

<p>But Mrs. Merrit was more obstinate than he had thought. She
was very sorry to hear of Mr. Saunder's cold, and how he lay
awake all night in London coughing; very sorry indeed. She'd
change his room for him gladly and get the south room aired, and
wouldn't he have a hot basin of bread and milk last thing at
night? But she was afraid that she would have to leave at the end
of the month.</p>

<p>"Try her with an increase of salary," was the advice of
Eustace.</p>

<p>It was no use. Mrs. Merrit was obdurate, though she knew of a
Mrs. Goddard, who had been housekeeper to Lord Gargrave, who
might be glad to come at the salary mentioned.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with the servants, Morton?" asked Eustace
that evening, when he brought the coffee into the library.
"What's all this about Mrs. Merrit wanting to leave?"</p>

<p>"If you please, sir, I was going to mention it myself. I have
a confession to make, sir. When I found your note, asking me to
open that desk and take out the box with the rat, I broke the
lock as you told me, and was glad to do it, because I could hear
the animal in the box making a great noise, and I thought it
wanted food. So I took out the box, sir, and got a cage, and was
going to transfer it, when the animal got away."</p>

<p>"What in the world are you talking about? I never wrote any
such note."</p>

<p>"Excuse me, sir; it was the note I picked up here on the floor
on the day you and Mr. Saunders left. I have it in my pocket
now."</p>

<p>It certainly seemed to be in Eustace's handwriting. It was
written in pencil, and began somewhat abruptly.</p>

<p>"Get a hammer, Morton," he read "or some other tool and break
open the lock in the old desk in the library. Take out the box
that is inside. You need not do anything else. The lid is already
open.     Eustace Borlsover."</p>

<p>"And you opened the desk?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; and, as I was getting the cage ready, the animal
hopped out."</p>

<p>"What animal?"</p>

<p>"The animal inside the box, sir."</p>

<p>"What did it look like?"</p>

<p>"Well, sir, I couldn't tell you," said Morton, nervously. "My
back was turned, and it was half way down the room when I looked
up."</p>

<p>"What was its colour?" asked Saunders. "Black?"</p>

<p>"Oh no, sir; a greyish white. It crept along in a very funny
way, sir. I don't think it had a tail."</p>

<p>"What did you do then?"</p>

<p>"I tried to catch it; but it was no use. So I set the
rat-traps and kept the library shut. Then that girl, Emma
Laidlaw, left the door open when she was cleaning, and I think it
must have escaped."</p>

<p>"And you think it is the animal that's been frightening the
maids?"</p>

<p>"Well, no, sir, not quite. They said it was&mdash;you'll
excuse me, sir&mdash;a hand that they saw. Emma trod on it once
at the bottom of the stairs. She thought then it was a
half-frozen toad, only white. And then Parfit was washing up the
dishes in the scullery. She wasn't thinking about anything in
particular. It was close on dusk. She took her hands out of the
water and was drying them absent-minded like on the roller towel,
when she found she was drying someone else's hand as well, only
colder than hers."</p>

<p>"What nonsense!" exclaimed Saunders.</p>

<p>"Exactly, sir; that's what I told her; but we couldn't get her
to stop."</p>

<p>"You don't believe all this?" said Eustace, turning suddenly
towards the butler.</p>

<p>"Me, sir? Oh no, sir! I've not seen anything."</p>

<p>"Nor heard anything?"</p>

<p>"Well, sir, if you must know, the bells do ring at odd times,
and there's nobody there when we go; and when we go round to draw
the blinds of a night, as often as not somebody's been there
before us. But, as I says to Mrs. Merrit, a young monkey might do
wonderful things, and we all know that Mr. Borlsover has had some
strange animals about the place."</p>

<p>"Very well, Morton, that will do."</p>

<p>"What do you make of it?" asked Saunders, when they were
alone. "I mean of the letter he said you wrote."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's simple enough," said Eustace. "See the paper it's
written on? I stopped using that paper years ago, but there were
a few odd sheets and envelopes left in the old desk. We never
fastened up the lid of the box before locking it in. The hand got
out, found a pencil, wrote this note, and shoved it through the
crack on to the floor, where Morton found it. That's plain as
daylight."</p>

<p>"But the hand couldn't write!"</p>

<p>"Couldn't it? You've not seen it do the things I've seen." And
he told Saunders more of what had happened at Eastbourne.</p>

<p>"Well," said Saunders, "in that case we have at least an
explanation of the legacy. It was the hand which wrote, unknown
to your uncle, that letter to your solicitor bequeathing itself
to you. Your uncle had no more to do with that request than I. In
fact, it would seem that he had some idea of his automatic
writing and feared it."</p>

<p>"Then if it's not my uncle, what is it?"</p>

<p>"I suppose some people might say that a disembodied spirit had
got your uncle to educate and prepare a little body for it. Now
it's got into that little body and is off on its own."</p>

<p>"Well, what are we to do?"</p>

<p>"We'll keep our eyes open," said Saunders, "and try to catch
it. If we can't do that, we shall have to wait till the bally
clockwork runs down. After all, if it's flesh and blood, it can't
live for ever."</p>

<p>For two days nothing happened. Then Saunders saw it sliding
down the banister in the hall. He was taken unawares and lost a
full second before he started in pursuit, only to find that the
thing had escaped him. Three days later Eustace, writing alone in
the library at night, saw it sitting on an open book at the other
end of the room. The fingers crept over the page, as if it were
reading; but before he had time to get up from his seat, it had
taken the alarm, and was pulling itself up the curtains. Eustace
watched it grimly, as it hung on to the cornice with three
fingers and flicked thumb and forefinger at him in an expression
of scornful derision.</p>

<p>"I know what I'll do," he said. "If I only get it into the
open, I'll set the dogs on to it." He spoke to Saunders of the
suggestion.</p>

<p>"It's a jolly good idea," he said; "only we won't wait till we
find it out of doors. We'll get the dogs. There are the two
terriers and the under-keeper's Irish mongrel, that's on to rats
like a flash. Your spaniel has not got spirit enough for this
sort of game."</p>

<p>They brought the dogs into the house, and the keeper's Irish
mongrel chewed up the slippers, and the terriers tripped up
Morton, as he waited at table; but all three were welcome. Even
false security is better than no security at all.</p>

<p>For a fortnight nothing happened. Then the hand was caught,
not by the dogs, but by Mrs. Merrit's grey parrot. The bird was
in the habit of periodically removing the pins that kept its
seed- and water-tin in place, and of escaping through the holes
in the side of the cage. When once at liberty, Peter would show
no inclination to return, and would often be about the house for
days. Now, after six consecutive weeks of captivity, Peter had
again discovered a new way of unloosing his bolts and was at
large, exploring the tapestried forests of the curtains and
singing songs in praise of liberty from cornice and
picture-rail.</p>

<p>"It's no use your trying to catch him," said Eustace to Mrs.
Merrit, as she came into the study one afternoon towards dusk
with a step-ladder. "You'd much better leave Peter alone. Starve
him into surrender, Mrs. Merrit; and don't leave bananas and seed
about for him to peck at when he fancies he's hungry. You're far
too soft-hearted."</p>

<p>"Well, sir, I see he's right out of reach now on that
picture-rail; so, if you wouldn't mind closing the door, sir,
when you leave the room, I'll bring his cage in tonight and put
some meat inside it. He's that fond of meat, though it does make
him pull out his feathers to suck the quills. They <i>do</i> say
that if you cook&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never mind, Mrs. Merrit," said Eustace, who was busy writing;
"that will do; I'll keep an eye on the bird."</p>

<p>For a short time there was silence in the room.</p>

<p>"Scratch poor Peter," said the bird. "Scratch poor old
Peter!"</p>

<p>"Be quiet, you beastly bird!"</p>

<p>"Poor old Peter! Scratch poor Peter; do!"</p>

<p>"I'm more likely to wring your neck, if I get hold of you." He
looked up at the picture-rail, and there was the hand, holding on
to a hook with three fingers, and slowly scratching the head of
the parrot with the fourth. Eustace ran to the bell and pressed
it hard; then across to the window, which he closed with a bang.
Frightened by the noise, the parrot shook its wings preparatory
to flight, and, as it did so, the fingers of the hand got hold of
it by the throat. There was a shrill scream, from Peter, as he
fluttered across the room, wheeling round in circles that ever
descended, borne down under the weight that clung to him. The
bird dropped at last quite suddenly, and Eustace saw fingers and
feathers rolled into an inextricable mass on the floor. The
struggle abruptly ceased, as finger and thumb squeezed the neck;
the bird's eyes rolled up to show the whites, and there was a
faint, half-choked gurgle. But, before the fingers had time to
loose their hold, Eustace had them in his own.</p>

<p>"Send Mr. Saunders here at once," he said to the maid who came
in answer to the bell. "Tell him I want him immediately."</p>

<p>Then he went with the hand to the fire. There was a ragged
gash across the back, where the bird's beak had torn it, but no
blood oozed from the wound. He noted with disgust that the nails
had grown long and discoloured.</p>

<p>"I'll burn the beastly thing," he said. But he could not burn
it. He tried to throw it into the flames, but his own hands, as
if impelled by some old primitive feeling, would not let him. And
so Saunders found him, pale and irresolute, with the hand still
clasped tightly in his fingers.</p>

<p>"I've got it at last," he said, in a tone of triumph.</p>

<p>"Good, let's have a look at it."</p>

<p>"Not when it's loose. Get me some nails and a hammer and a
board of some sort."</p>

<p>"Can you hold it all right?"</p>

<p>"Yes, the thing's quite limp; tired out with throttling poor
old Peter, I should say."</p>

<p>"And now," said Saunders, when he returned with the things,
"what are we going to do?"</p>

<p>"Drive a nail through it first, so that it can't get away.
Then we can take our time over examining it."</p>

<p>"Do it yourself," said Saunders. "I don't mind helping you
with guinea-pigs occasionally, when there's something to be
learned, partly because I don't fear a guinea-pig's revenge. This
thing's different."</p>

<p>"Oh, my aunt!" he giggled hysterically, "look at it now." For
the hand was writhing in agonized contortions, squirming and
wriggling upon the nail like a worm upon the hook.</p>

<p>"Well," said Saunders, "you've done it now. I'll leave you to
examine it."</p>

<p>"Don't go, in heaven's name! Cover it up, man; cover it up!
Shove a cloth over it! Here!" and he pulled off the antimacassar
from the back of a chair and wrapped the board in it. "Now get
the keys from my pocket and open the safe. Chuck the other things
out. Oh, Lord, it's getting itself into frightful knots! Open it
quick!" He threw the thing in and banged the door.</p>

<p>"We'll keep it there till it dies," he said. "May I burn in
hell, if I ever open the door of that safe again."</p>

<h5>* * * * *</h5>

<p>Mrs. Merrit departed at the end of the month. Her successor,
Mrs. Handyside, certainly was more successful in the management
of the servants. Early in her rule she declared that she would
stand no nonsense, and gossip soon withered and died.</p>

<p>"I shouldn't be surprised if Eustace married one of these
days," said Saunders. "Well, I'm in no hurry for such an event. I
know him far too well for the future Mrs. Borlsover to like me.
It will be the same old story again; a long friendship slowly
made&mdash;marriage&mdash;and a long friendship quickly
forgotten."</p>

<p>But Eustace did not follow the advice of his uncle and marry.
Old habits crept over and covered his new experience. He was, if
anything, less morose, and showed a greater inclination to take
his natural part in country society.</p>

<p>Then came the burglary. The men, it was said, broke into the
house by way of the conservatory. It was really little more than
an attempt, for they only succeeded in carrying away a few pieces
of plate from the pantry. The safe in the study was certainly
found open and empty, but, as Mr. Borlsover informed the police
inspector, he had kept nothing of value in it during the last six
months.</p>

<p>"Then you're lucky in getting off so easily, sir," the man
replied. "By the way they have gone about their business I should
say they were experienced cracksmen. They must have caught the
alarm when they were just beginning their evening's work."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Eustace, "I suppose I am lucky."</p>

<p>"I've no doubt," said the inspector, "that we shall be able to
trace the men. I've said that they must have been old hands at
the game. The way they got in and opened the safe shows that. But
there's one little thing that puzzles me. One of them was
careless enough not to wear gloves, and I'm bothered if I know
what he was trying to do. I've traced his finger-marks on the new
varnish on the window-sashes in every one of the downstairs
rooms. They are very distinctive ones too."</p>

<p>"Right hand or left or both?" asked Eustace.</p>

<p>"Oh, right every time. That's the funny thing. He must have
been a foolhardy fellow, and I rather think it was him that wrote
that." He took out a slip of paper from his pocket. "That's what
he wrote, sir: 'I've got out, Eustace Borlsover, but I'll be back
before long.' Some jailbird just escaped, I suppose. It will make
it all the easier for us to trace him. Do you know the writing,
sir?"</p>

<p>"No," said Eustace. "It's not the writing of any one I
know."</p>

<p>"I'm not going to stay here any longer," said Eustace to
Saunders at luncheon. "I've got on far better during the last six
months than I expected, but I'm not going to run the risk of
seeing that thing again. I shall go up to town this afternoon.
Get Morton to put my things together, and join me with the car at
Brighton on the day after tomorrow. And bring the proofs of those
two papers with you. We'll run over them together."</p>

<p>"How long are you going to be away?"</p>

<p>"I can't say for certain, but be prepared to stay for some
time. We've stuck to work pretty closely through summer, and I
for one need a holiday. I'll engage the rooms at Brighton. You'll
find it best to break the journey at Hitchin. I'll wire to you
there at the 'Crown' to tell you the Brighton address."</p>

<p>The house he chose at Brighton was in a terrace. He had been
there before. It was kept by his old college gyp, a man of
discreet silence, who was admirably partnered by an excellent
cook. The rooms were on the first floor. The two bedrooms were at
the back, and opened out of each other. "Mr. Saunders can have
the smaller one, though it is the only one with a fire-place," he
said. "I'll stick to the larger of the two, since it's got a
bath-room adjoining. I wonder what time he'll arrive with the
car."</p>

<p>Saunders came about seven, cold and cross and dirty.</p>

<p>"We'll light the fire in the dining-room," said Eustace, "and
get Prince to unpack some of the things while we are at dinner.
What were the roads like?"</p>

<p>"Rotten. Swimming with mud, and a beastly cold wind against us
all day. And this is July. Dear Old England!"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Eustace, "I think we might do worse than leave Old
England for a few months."</p>

<p>They turned in soon after twelve.</p>

<p>"You oughtn't to feel cold, Saunders," said Eustace, "when you
can afford to sport a great fur-lined coat like this. You do
yourself very well, all things considered. Look at those gloves,
for instance. Who could possibly feel cold when wearing
them?"</p>

<p>"They are far too clumsy, though, for driving. Try them on and
see"; and he tossed them through the door on to Eustace's bed and
went on with his unpacking. A minute later he heard a shrill cry
of terror.</p>

<p>"Oh, Lord," he heard, "it's in the glove! Quick, Saunders,
quick!" Then came a smacking thud. Eustace had thrown it from
him.</p>

<p>"I've chucked it into the bath-room," he gasped; "it's hit the
wall and fallen into the bath. Come now, if you want to
help."</p>

<p>Saunders, with a lighted candle in his hand, looked over the
edge of the bath. There it was, old and maimed, dumb and blind,
with a ragged hole in the middle, crawling, staggering, trying to
creep up the slippery sides, only to fall back helpless.</p>

<p>"Stay there," said Saunders, "I'll empty a collar-box or
something, and we'll jam it in. It can't get out while I'm
away."</p>

<p>"Yes, it can," shouted Eustace. "It's getting out now; it's
climbing up the plug-chain.&mdash;No, you brute, you filthy
brute, you don't!&mdash;Come back, Saunders; it's getting away
from me. I can't hold it; it's all slippery. Curse its claws!
Shut the window, you idiot! It's got out!" There was the sound of
something dropping on to the hard flagstones below, and Eustace
fell back fainting.</p>

<h5>* * * * *</h5>

<p>For a fortnight he was ill.</p>

<p>"I don't know what to make of it," the doctor said to
Saunders. "I can only suppose that Mr. Borlsover has suffered
some great emotional shock. You had better let me send someone to
help you nurse him. And by all means indulge that whim of his
never to be left alone in the dark. I would keep a light burning
all night, if I were you. But he <i>must</i> have more fresh air.
It's perfectly absurd, this hatred of open windows."</p>

<p>Eustace would have no one with him but Saunders. "I don't want
the other man," he said. "They'd smuggle it in somehow. I know
they would."</p>

<p>"Don't worry about it, old chap. This sort of thing can't go
on indefinitely. You know I saw it this time as well as you. It
wasn't half so active. It won't go on living much longer,
especially after that fall. I heard it hit the flags myself. As
soon as you're a bit stronger, we'll leave this place, not bag
and baggage, but with only the clothes on our back, so that it
won't be able to hide anywhere. We'll escape it that way. We
won't give any address, and we won't have any parcels sent after
us. Cheer up, Eustace! You'll be well enough to leave in a day or
two. The doctor says I can take you out in a chair tomorrow."</p>

<p>"What have I done?" asked Eustace. "Why does it come after me?
I'm no worse than other men. I'm no worse than you, Saunders; you
know I'm not. It was you who was at the bottom of that dirty
business in San Diego, and that was fifteen years ago."</p>

<p>"It's not that, of course," said Saunders. "We are in the
twentieth century, and even the parsons have dropped the idea of
your old sins finding you out. Before you caught the hand in the
library, it was filled with pure malevolence&mdash;to you and all
mankind. After you spiked it through with that nail, it naturally
forgot about other people and concentrated its attention on you.
It was shut up in that safe, you know, for nearly six months.
That gives plenty of time for thinking of revenge."</p>

<p>Eustace Borlsover would not leave his room, but he thought
there might be something in Saunders's suggestion of a sudden
departure from Brighton. He began rapidly to regain his
strength.</p>

<p>"We'll go on the first of September," he said.</p>

<p>The evening of the thirty-first of August was oppressively
warm. Though at midday the windows had been wide open, they had
been shut an hour or so before dusk. Mrs. Prince had long since
ceased to wonder at the strange habits of the gentlemen on the
first floor. Soon after their arrival she had been told to take
down the heavy window curtains in the two bedrooms, and day by
day the rooms had seemed to grow more bare. Nothing was left
lying about.</p>

<p>"Mr. Borlsover doesn't like to have any place where dirt can
collect," Saunders had said as an excuse. "He likes to see into
all the corners of the room."</p>

<p>"Couldn't I open the window just a little?" he said to Eustace
that evening. "We're simply roasting in here, you know."</p>

<p>"No, leave well alone. We're not a couple of boarding-school
misses fresh from a course of hygiene lectures. Get the
chess-board out."</p>

<p>They sat down and played. At ten o'clock Mrs. Prince came to
the door with a note. "I am sorry I didn't bring it before," she
said, "but it was left in the letter-box."</p>

<p>"Open it, Saunders, and see if it wants answering."</p>

<p>It was very brief. There was neither address nor
signature.</p>

<p>"Will eleven o'clock tonight be suitable for our last
appointment?"</p>

<p>"Who is it from?" asked Borlsover.</p>

<p>"It was meant for me," said Saunders. "There's no answer, Mrs.
Prince," and he put the paper into his pocket.</p>

<p>"A dunning letter from a tailor; I suppose he must have got
wind of our leaving."</p>

<p>It was a clever lie, and Eustace asked no more questions. They
went on with their game.</p>

<p>On the landing outside Saunders could hear the grandfather's
clock whispering the seconds, blurting out the quarter-hours.</p>

<p>"Check," said Eustace. The clock struck eleven. At the same
time there was a gentle knocking on the door; it seemed to come
from the bottom panel.</p>

<p>"Who's there?" asked Eustace. There was no answer. "Mrs.
Prince, is that you?"</p>

<p>"She is up above," said Saunders; "I can hear her walking
about the room."</p>

<p>"Then lock the door; bolt it too. Your move, Saunders." While
Saunders sat with his eyes on the chess-board, Eustace walked
over to the window and examined the fastenings. He did the same
in Saunders's room, and the bathroom. There were no doors between
the three rooms, or he would have shut and locked them too.</p>

<p>"Now, Saunders," he said, "don't stay all night over your
move. I've had time to smoke one cigarette already. It's bad to
keep an invalid waiting. There's only one possible thing for you
to do. What was that?"</p>

<p>"The ivy blowing against the window. There, it's your move
now, Eustace."</p>

<p>"It wasn't the ivy, you idiot! It was someone tapping at the
window"; and he pulled up the blind. On the outer side of the
window, clinging to the sash, was the hand.</p>

<p>"What is it that it's holding?"</p>

<p>"It's a pocket-knife. It's going to try to open the window by
pushing back the fastener with the blade."</p>

<p>"Well, let it try," said Eustace. "Those fasteners screw down;
they can't be opened that way. Anyhow, we'll close the shutters.
It's your move, Saunders. I've played."</p>

<p>But Saunders found it impossible to fix his attention on the
game. He could not understand Eustace, who seemed all at once to
have lost his fear.</p>

<p>"What do you say to some wine?" he asked. "You seem to be
taking things coolly, but I don't mind confessing that I'm in a
blessed funk."</p>

<p>"You've no need to be. There's nothing supernatural about that
hand, Saunders. I mean, it seems to be governed by the laws of
time and space. It's not the sort of thing that vanishes into
thin air or slides through oaken doors. And since that's so, I
defy it to get in here. We'll leave the place in the morning. I
for one have bottomed the depths of fear. Fill your glass, man!
The windows are all shuttered; the door is locked and bolted.
Pledge me my Uncle Adrian! Drink, man! What are you waiting
for?"</p>

<p>Saunders was standing with his glass half raised. "It can get
in," he said hoarsely; "it can get in. We've forgotten. There's
the fire-place in my bed-room. It will come down the
chimney."</p>

<p>"Quick!" said Eustace, as he rushed into the other room; "we
haven't a minute to lose. What can we do? Light the fire,
Saunders. Give me a match, quick!"</p>

<p>"They must be all in the other room. I'll get them."</p>

<p>"Hurry, man, for goodness' sake! Look in the bookcase! Look in
the bath-room! Here, come and stand here; I'll look."</p>

<p>"Be quick!" shouted Saunders. "I can hear something!"</p>

<p>"Then plug a sheet from your bed up the chimney. No, here's a
match!" He had found one at last, that had slipped into a crack
in the floor.</p>

<p>"Is the fire laid? Good, but it may not burn. I know&mdash;the
oil from that old reading-lamp and this cotton-wool. Now the
match, quick! Pull the sheet away, you fool! We don't want it
now."</p>

<p>There was a great roar from the grate, as the flames shot up.
Saunders had been a fraction of a second too late with the sheet.
The oil had fallen on to it. It, too, was burning.</p>

<p>"The whole place will be on fire!" cried Eustace, as he tried
to beat out the flames with a blanket. "It's no good! I can't
manage it. You must open the door, Saunders, and get help."</p>

<p>Saunders ran to the door and fumbled with the bolts. The key
was stiff in the lock.</p>

<p>"Hurry," shouted Eustace, "or the heat will be too much for
me." The key turned in the lock at last. For half a second
Saunders stopped to look back. Afterwards he could never be quite
sure as to what he had seen, but at the time he thought that
something black and charred was creeping slowly, very slowly,
from the mass of flames towards Eustace Borlsover. For a moment
he thought of returning to his friend; but the noise and the
smell of the burning sent him running down the passage, crying:
"Fire! Fire!" He rushed to the telephone to summon help, and then
back to the bath-room&mdash;he should have thought of that
before&mdash;for water. As he burst into the bedroom there came a
scream of terror which ended suddenly, and then the sound of a
heavy fall.</p>

<h5>* * * * *</h5>

<p>This is the story which I heard on successive Saturday
evenings from the senior mathematical master at a second-rate
suburban school. For Saunders has had to earn a living in a way
which other men might reckon less congenial than his old manner
of life. I had mentioned by chance the name of Adrian Borlsover,
and wondered at the time why he changed the conversation with
such unusual abruptness. A week later Saunders began to tell me
something of his own history; sordid enough, though shielded with
a reserve I could well understand, for it had to cover not only
his failings, but those of a dead friend. Of the final tragedy he
was at first especially loath to speak; and it was only gradually
that I was able to piece together the narrative of the preceding
pages. Saunders was reluctant to draw any conclusions. At one
time he thought that the fingered beast had been animated by the
spirit of Sigismund Borlsover, a sinister eighteenth-century
ancestor, who, according to legend, built and worshipped in the
ugly pagan temple that overlooked the lake. At another time
Saunders believed the spirit to belong to a man whom Eustace had
once employed as a laboratory assistant, "a black-haired,
spiteful little brute", he said, "who died cursing his doctor,
because the fellow couldn't help him to live to settle some
paltry score with Borlsover".</p>

<p>From the point of view of direct contemporary evidence,
Saunders's story is practically uncorroborated. All the letters
mentioned in the narrative were destroyed, with the exception of
the last note which Eustace received, or rather which he would
have received, had not Saunders intercepted it. That I have seen
myself. The handwriting was thin and shaky, the handwriting of an
old man. I remember the Greek "e" was used in "appointment". A
little thing that amused me at the time was that Saunders seemed
to keep the note pressed between the pages of his Bible.</p>

<p>I had seen Adrian Borlsover once. Saunders I learnt to know
well. It was by chance, however, and not by design, that I met a
third person of the story, Morton, the butler. Saunders and I
were walking in the Zoological Gardens one Sunday afternoon, when
he called my attention to an old man who was standing before the
door of the Reptile House.</p>

<p>"Why, Morton," he said, clapping him on the back, "how is the
world treating you?"</p>

<p>"Poorly, Mr. Saunders," said the old fellow, though his face
lighted up at the greeting. "The winters drag terribly nowadays.
There don't seem no summers or springs."</p>

<p>"You haven't found what you were looking for, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, not yet; but I shall some day. I always told them
that Mr. Borlsover kept some queer animals."</p>

<p>"And what is he looking for?" I asked, when we had parted from
him.</p>

<p>"A beast with five fingers," said Saunders. "This afternoon,
since he has been in the Reptile House, I suppose it will be a
reptile with a hand. Next week it will be a monkey with
practically no body. The poor old chap is a born
materialist."</p>
