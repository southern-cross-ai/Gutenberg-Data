<hr>
<br>

<p class="first">THE shabby stores along lower Fourth Avenue are
somehow furtive despite the apparent frankness of their decrepit
outside-boxes of "Bargains in Used Books." A film of gritty dust
grimes these bedraggled offerings, smuts the unwashed
window-fronts, seeps into the gloomy interiors of the shops and
spreads gray haze over the absorbed browsers and somnolent
attendants within. Those who frequent the vicinity know, or think
they know, that its air of hangdog stealth cloaks neither sly
criminality nor high intrigue, that it is rather the pitiable
camouflage of outlived writings, and of men who have never known
life.</p>

<p>Nowhere, perhaps, is there a drowsier back-eddy of musty quiet
and stagnant uneventfulness than this. Yet, over one of the drab
shops in this sleepy row the scythe of Death is suspended by a
spider-filament taut to the breaking point. The merest whisper of
suspicion into the ear of one of a half-score thin-lipped,
stony-faced men sitting behind the guarded doors of secret rooms in
far-off capitals would map that thread. The slightest hint reaching
one of a hundred others; ghostly wraiths waging unacknowledged war
in the dim underways of a world ostensibly at peace; and eager
fingers would reach thousands of miles to sever its tenuous fibre.
For something more than the life of a man hangs by that easily
parted strand. A Nation's fate depends on its strength.</p>

<p>Death, and the fear of death are silent, invisible sentinels at
either side of the pamphlet-hung doorway in which Ford Duane folded
his lanky limbs into a broken-backed swivel chair. Beneath their
drooping lids his very blue eyes freeze suddenly to icy points and
the scalp tightens under his brown shock of unruly hair. The glance
of a passerby has lingered a fraction of a second too long on his
spare frame!</p>

<p>Lithe muscles coil like steel springs, thin nostrils flare
imperceptibly... but the paunchy man with the rusted-black derby
shambles on and Duane relaxes. He knows there is nothing to fear
from this particular individual; but how he <i>knows,</i> he cannot
tell you. There is a sixth sense common to a hunter and hunted by
which they recognize each other's presence. And as both hunter and
hunted, Ford Duane possesses that sense to a marked degree...</p>

<p>His head turns slowly to a tinny rattle from up the avenue. Its
source is revealed as a leisurely approaching pushcart, piled high
with gleaming kitchen utensils and shoved by a stocky,
shirt-sleeved and sweating man. As Duane spies the portable store a
raucous voice calls out: "Pails, axes, teenvare. Pails, axes,
teenvare." The corner of the bookseller's mouth quirks.</p>

<p>A bent old woman, Victorian bonnet fastened to the straggly gray
remnants of her hair by that almost obsolete instrument, a hat-pin,
appears from the interior of his shop. One almost transparent claw
grips a dog-eared volume of Jane Porter's <i>Thaddeus of Warsaw</i>
and a professional gleam comes into Duane's eye as he slouches
erect, scenting a sale. "I can let you have that for..." he begins,
but his face falls as the supposed customer squeaks, "Oh, I just
want to get a pail from the man; my old one sprang a leak this
morning."</p>

<p>"By Jove," the bookseller exclaims, "so did mine! Maybe we can
get them cheaper if one of us buys two at a time. Here, you wait
and let me get them."</p>

<p>"Pails, axes, teenvare," the peddler's shout is repeated. He has
other items in his cart, but his cry is unvarying. Does it convey
any meaning to Duane? Is it merely coincidence that the same
initial letters recur now in the pushcart man's shout?
<i>"P</i>ails, <i>a</i>xes, <i>t</i>eenvare." Perhaps. But the
shopkeeper's stroll to the curb is too nonchalant, too open to have
an ulterior meaning. Duane scarcely glances at the pails the
peddler hands him at last, certainly they are twins, and the one he
turns over to the old woman in exchange for her twenty-two cents is
taken at random.</p>
<br>

<p class="first">DUANE moves through his shop with no apparent
haste. He pauses to straighten a shelf and the shining bucket whose
bail he has thrust over his arm clangs against its edge. But,
veiled by the lax droop of their lids, Duane's eyes slide over the
idlers in the shadows, discreet challenge in their hazed depths.
Only the old, familiar figures lurk in the shadows. A tiny muscle
twitches in Duane's smooth cheek and he reaches the half-open
curtain swinging before the narrow alcove. There, only a rumpled
camp cot and a two-burner gas plate indicate his living quarters.
He turns to the right, is momentarily hidden from the store-room
beyond. A slender wall of tight-packed books moves suddenly on well
oiled hinges, swings back into place. The incident is
lightning-fast. The musty alcove is just as it was before. Except
that Ford Duane has vanished from it.</p>

<p>Behind that wall of shelved books is a cramped, windowless
cubicle, not more than a yard square. When Duane seats himself on a
high stool and sets the pail, top down, on a narrow wooden ledge
attached to the inner wall, a fair-sized rat would have trouble
finding room to squeeze in. A switch clicks and a powerful light,
high up in the ceiling, pours down its radiance. The man's
sharp-edged face is no longer impassive. His eyes are ablaze with
excitement and eagerness, his thin lips half parted. His
long-fingered hand trembles slightly as he pulls out a drawer
beneath the shelf and extracts from it a jeweler's magnifying
glass.</p>

<p>Fitting the lens into his right eye, Duane bends over the tin
bucket, and scrutinizes its upturned bottom. Faint breath hisses
from between his teeth and his hands tighten on the shelf edge. But
the powerful light beating down on the tin disk reveals only a
number of almost microscopic indentations, scattered at random over
its shiny surface, tiny, pointed scratches such as no polished
surface can escape, no matter how carefully it be handled.</p>

<p>The pseudo-bookman reaches for the drawer again, brings out a
pencil, a sheet of paper, and another object. It is a disk of
transparent celluloid, and as Duane places it on the pail bottom he
sees that it is engraved with a series of close, concentric circles
and radiating lines. Around the outermost circumference a series of
letters are etched, and a circular space at the center is blank,
except for three scratches very like those on the pail,
triangularly arranged. Strangely enough a little juggling of the
celluloid makes the three tiny markings in the center of tin
coincide with the trio on the transparent disk. Duane grunts with
satisfaction.</p>

<p>Each of the other scratches, seen through the engraved film,
falls exactly within one of the tiny arcs marked off by the whitish
circles and straight lines, and no two are between the same two
circles. Duane catches up his pencil and jots down letters,
swiftly.</p>

<p>In seconds, he is staring at this cabalistic line:</p>

<p>SBTRS * PLN * DSTRY * GSMSK * PLT * B * T</p>

<p class="first">and his face is suddenly bleak, his mouth a
straight, thin gash. His pencil moves again, swiftly, putting in
omitted vowels:</p>

<p>SABOTEURS PLAN DESTROY GASMASK PLANT B&mdash;T</p>

<p>Duane's lids narrow to hairline slits, and two white spots
appear either side his pinched nostrils. Why has the mysterious
individual known only as "T," head of the American
Counter-espionage Service, sent it to him?</p>

<p>For a long time there is no movement in the hidden chamber, no
slightest sound except the deep, even breathing of a man sunk in
deep thought. On the ancient continent that lies over the blue
curve of the earth and sea armies are on the march, their grim
weapons charged and ready, while the dictators who have set them
moving mouth-phrases about "usual maneuvers" that they do not
expect to be believed. The ranks are forming, but in each bristling
front there is a vacant space. Holocaust waits for America, and
America, remembering what Europe would have her forget, smiles with
veiled eyes and says quietly, "Not again. Once was enough!"</p>

<p>On a still more ancient continent another race waits with
inscrutable patience for the Day when the lowering Western sun
shall be bathed with the hue of blood. But some among them are not
content to wait...</p>
<br>

<p class="first">IN MOONLESS, misty darkness two figures paced the
lightless margin of Long Island Sound. High above them the vault of
a great bridge sprang in a soaring arch, behind them gigantic
cylindrical tanks loomed ominously. Squat buildings leered at them
from red-glowing windows, seeming somehow diabolical in the murk.
But those were only the huge containers for illuminating gas that
supply New York, the fires that encarnadined those windows only
distilled that gas in long iron retorts of heated coal. Why then
are blue-barreled rifles slanting across the shoulders of these
slow-moving sentries; why should the men peer so tensely into the
low-lying river haze? Why are soldiers on sentry going with loaded
guns in a land at peace with all the world?</p>

<p>"Gees, Sarge," one of the guards voiced this very question. "I'm
gettin' the gimmicks watchin' for somethin'&mdash;I don't know
what. What's the big idea, haulin' the battalion off Governor's
Island an' shippin' us over here? Labor trouble?"</p>

<p>"No. No-o-o." The free hand of the other rasped the graying
bristles on his square jaw. "I dunno as I ought to tell you, but if
you can keep your lips buttoned mebbe I will. You should ought to
know what you're looking for. Know what you're guardin',
Jenkins?"</p>

<p>"I'm askin' you."</p>

<p>The sergeant's voice was a hoarse whisper. "Gas-masks&mdash;six
million gas-masks!"</p>

<p>"Yeah! What would we do with six million gas-masks? Hell, that's
enough for every man, woman an' child in Noo Yawk."</p>

<p>"That's just who they're for."</p>

<p>The private chuckled. "Good stuff! But I ain't a rookie. C'm on,
what's th' straight dope?"</p>

<p>"I jest give it to yuh."</p>

<p>"But what th' hell would we want to be puttin' masks on civvies
for? Women an' kids ain't goin' to do no fightin'!..."</p>

<p>"But they're goin' to git gassed in the next war. Judas Priest,
wake up! Don't yuh read the papers?"</p>

<p>"Aw, those tabloids is all guff!"</p>

<p>"You'd know if you'd been on guard at staff meetings, like me.
I'm tellin' yuh the next war is goin' to see whole cities wiped out
by gas before we get a chance to shoot off a rifle. But Uncle Sam
ain't asleep. We've got gas-mask plants an' warehouses all along
both seaboards, an' at the first sign of trouble the masks gets put
out to everybody, damn quick. This Plant B's the biggest. Maybe
they got a tip-off that it's goin' to be blown up or somethin'
tonight. That's why we're here. Orders is take any suspicious
characters alive so that we can find out what country's trying the
stunt."</p>

<p>Jenkins was convinced. "Hell," he spat. "Any country pulls
anything like that, we're going to hop all over 'em. We ain't goin'
to take any more Black Toms layin' down!"</p>

<p>"Put my name on that detail too. I&mdash;<i>Hell! What's
that?"</i></p>

<p>The sergeant whirled, his rifle barrel slapping into his left
palm, its butt jerking to his shoulder. <i>"Who is there?"</i> he
challenged, the sharpness of his voice flatting at the
river-mist.</p>

<p>The private was taut, his gun also at the ready. "Whatja hear?"
he muttered from the corner of his mouth.</p>

<p>"Sounded like an oar. But I don't see nothin'. Guess mebbe it
was a water rat..."</p>

<p>"Or some sailor heaving garbage overboard from that Eyetalian
tramp over there by Ward's Island. Wonder to me they let her stay
there."</p>

<p>"We can't tip our hand by shyin' every boat away from here. That
would be a dead giveaway. Now, as I was sayin'...
<i>G-gaw..."</i></p>

<p>The sergeant choked suddenly; the rifle dropped; his hands came
up to claw at his throat, were reddened by a gush of blood from a
gaping hole where an instant before his neck had been. He slumped
to the gravel, the private's lifeless form thudded atop him. And
gray mist rolled over two twisted, gory corpses; a hazy mist-shroud
that hid them with a softness more merciful than that of the men
who had done this thing.</p>

<p>For an instant the night held its breath in shocked silence,
then stone grated against wood. The shadowy keel of a rowboat dug
into the gravelly beach. It rocked a bit, and two stocky figures
came over the gunwale, waded ashore. One slithered to the entangled
bodies, bent swiftly to them, rose as swiftly. "Both dead. That was
fine shooting, Dominic."</p>

<p>"And the silencer worked beautifully; the alarm has not been
given." The other hesitated a moment, then went on. "But I do not
like it, Angelo. I tell you I do not like it. There is no war
between our country and theirs. I am befouled with the murder of
two brave soldiers."</p>

<p>"Dominic!" Angelo's voice was sharp. "You forget yourself. It is
not for us to question orders, for us only to obey. Our leader, the
all-wise, has set this task for us. But hurry! We have ten minutes
to get our bombs from the boat, plant them and return to the
<i>Santa Maria."</i></p>

<p>Dominic still temporised. "There were two sentries, not one as
we were told. Perhaps there has been a leak, and the plant itself
is also more thoroughly guarded."</p>

<p>"Bah! If I had known that you were such a coward I should have
come alone. One of these is a sergeant, he but chanced to be here
at the crucial moment. Come."</p>

<p>The two saboteurs returned to grope in the dark bulk of their
boat. They straightened, each lifting a shadowy bag. And froze as
cold, hard words vibrated behind them.</p>

<p>"Stay just that way, you two." That sudden voice was keen-edged
with the threat of sudden death. "Put those bags down in the boat,
gently, and your guns beside them."</p>

<p>The prowlers dipped to obey, lifted again. "Now turn, slowly."
Oddly the speaker seemed as anxious to avoid being heard as they
themselves had been, to judge from the repression of his tone,
pitched so as to reach them and be heard no further. They came
around stiffly till they faced their captor.</p>
<br>

<p class="first">HE SEEMED at first a part of the swirling fog, so
blurred were his outlines. A shapeless gray felt was pulled low
over his forehead, a gray mask covered his face so that only the
glint of narrowed eyes were visible through its slits. His figure
was formless in a black cloak that fell from his shoulders to the
ground. But that which tightened the spies' scalps and bristled the
short hairs at the base of their skulls with superstitious fear was
the steady hand that held a revolver point-blank at their
heads.</p>

<p>It was black, that hand, black-gloved except for the long finger
that curled around the weapon's trigger. That was scarlet; even in
the misty dark they could see that glaring scarlet as if it had
been dipped in fresh blood. And a name dripped like blood from
Angelo's bloodless lips. "Red Finger!"</p>

<p>The mask head nodded, and it seemed almost as if the hidden
mouth smiled humorlessly. "Red Finger," it assented, savoring the
dread that name inspired among all who moved in the murky
underworld of international intrigue.</p>

<p>A second's silence intervened, accentuated by the greasy lap of
water along the rowboat's keel and the far-off melancholy hoot of a
ferry. Then, "Who gave you the orders for&mdash;this?"</p>

<p>"Capit&mdash;" Dominic began, his voice thinned by fear, but
Angelo's hard-driven elbow into his side choked off the words. "Try
and find out!" the more virulent of the two said. "We have failed,
and death is our reward, but we shall never talk. You will save
time by turning us over to your police."</p>

<p>Red Finger's black shoulders shrugged. "That, precisely, is what
I shall not do. But you are small fry; I have no more time to waste
on you." The scarlet digit twitched, twice. No report shattered the
river quiet, but two jets of fine spray spurted from the muzzle of
his gun, to become a vaporous cloud about the saboteurs' heads. The
spies collapsed like two ripped meal-bags, thudded to the ground,
lay motionless.</p>

<p>AT ONCE the counter-spy leaped into furious action. His lithe
figure sprang forward, in an instant he had heaved the unconscious
saboteurs into their tiny craft, and shoved it off and whipped into
it. He let it slide out into the Sound with the momentum of his
initial shove, let the current take it. The fog closed around the
boat. There was a dull plop into the water, then a second. Those
particular bombs would lie at the bottom of the East River till
Judgment Day. A tiny, hooded light flickered over a swarthy face;
touched ascetic lips, a close-trimmed, black mustache; went out. A
black cloak fluttered overside, a gray mask followed....</p>

<p>Minutes later a limp body, clad only in shirt and drawers,
bulked along the rowboat's gunwale. "God take your soul, Dominic
Liscio. You did your duty as you saw it."</p>

<p>The river chuckled gruesomely as it clasped yet another flaccid
bundle to its muddy bosom. Then muffled oars dipped softly into the
stream and the boat's bow turned toward the loom of the <i>Santa
Maria,</i> until the rowboat reached and thudded against its
rust-streaked hull.</p>

<p>From the deck of the tramp steamer a cautious voice called, in
Italian, "Who is it?"</p>

<p>"Liscio," the whispered reply came in perfect Piedmontese, and
in the voice of the man whose corpse now bobbed somewhere on the
Sound's scummed flood. "Dominic Liscio. Get us on board quickly.
Angelo has met with an accident, he's unconscious. Help me with
him."</p>

<p>An unintelligible exclamation came from above, feet thudded. The
man in the boat heard an authoritative rumble, curiously guttural
for an officer of an Italian vessel. Then a Jacob's ladder coiled
down, and he had fastened the boat to its end, had lifted Angelo to
reaching hands, toward a flashlight's glare above, and was himself
stepping on to the dim deck.</p>

<p>Shadowy forms were barely visible. One approached,
broad-shouldered, paunchy, the shape of his head unmistakably
Teutonic. Light flicked over the figure standing there in Dominic
Liscio's clothes, and fingering Dominic Liscio's close-clipped
black mustache so that his hand all but screened a swarthy face
that might have been Liscio's own. "Well, what happened?"</p>

<p>Liscio's reincarnation responded in English, taking the cue. "We
got the bombs planted, all right. Hell will break loose in half an
hour. We'd better get away from here. Someone&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait. Tell me in the cabin. Come." The other turned, waddled on
thick legs to a companionway. Warm light irradiated the mist as a
door opened, fanned out. The disguised Red Finger's eyes slid to a
face just revealed at the edge of the luminance; his lids narrowed.
But he followed the German into the cabin and the door shut behind
him.</p>
<br>

<p class="first">HE STOOD just within that door, watching his bulky
shaven-polled host, and his fingers hovered near the lapel of
Liscio's pea-jacket. The other heaved around, his flabby cheeks
quivered. He was just beyond a table on which were a pitcher and a
tall glass on the inside of which yellow foam still made dripping
rings. His hamlike arms hung straight down and his hands were
concealed by the edge of the table. "Now we can speak with more
comfort. Tell me about it."</p>

<p>"First you tell me something, Herr Gans. Tell me how it happens
that a Nazi spy is serving in the Italian Secret Service?"</p>

<p>The vast expanse of Gans' face was expressionless, but his
piglike eyes glittered. "Ach! Once more! I told already that I was
unjustly cashiered by von Goering when I reported that I had killed
that dangerous American, Red Finger, and afterwards it was proved I
was mistaken. Why must you ask that question again?"</p>

<p>"Because it just occurred to me that if our little expedition
had been tipped-off to the Americans and they had captured two
obvious Italians sabotaging their gas-mask plant, this country
would have been swept by a tempest of rage that would have forced
its leaders to throw the power of the United States on the side of
Hitler in the coming struggle."</p>

<p>The German's red mouth twisted. "True. But what of it? They were
not tipped-off."</p>

<p>The other's voice dropped a note, was thick with menace. "But
they were, Herr Gans. They were. And I think that fact will be of
great interest to my compatriots aboard." He half-twisted, got a
hand on the doorknob, then froze, held for an instant by a sudden
sound over his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Stop!" Gans barked. "Stop&mdash;<i>Red Finger!"</i></p>

<p>The American's eyes flicked back, saw the black tunnel-mouth of
a forty-five automatic snouting at him. He came fully around to
face that menace, his hands went above his head, and he smiled.</p>

<p>"Good, Herr Gans! Very good! Suspecting my imposture you got me
in here and you had that gun ready to flash on me at the proper
time. But how did you know?"</p>

<p>"Liscio was provided with a password to use when he returned,
though I knew he would not return. When you did not use it, I knew
you were not him. And who else could you be but&mdash;Red Finger?
Only you, Red Finger, would have defeated the plan to wreck the
gas-mask plant without the repercussion on which I counted, and
then have the skill and the nerve to come here made up as the man
you have killed."</p>

<p>"Thanks for the compliment." The counter-spy, at the mercy of
his archenemy, appeared as carefree as though the table between
them were set for a luncheon instead of being spread for death.
"But I must return it. Your whole scheme was clever, too clever, in
fact for you to have evolved it." The German's smirk was suddenly
replaced by a black scowl. "May I venture to guess that it was
suggested to you by&mdash;a certain Baron Odun, that suave,
brilliant chief-spy of&mdash;an Asiatic power."</p>

<p>The fury that leaped into the other's pink face rendered verbal
admission unnecessary. The American's eyebrows arched, and he went
smoothly on. "Perhaps it did not occur to you that he was making
you a catspaw to pull his country's chestnuts out of the fire?"</p>

<p>"A catspaw," the Nazi spluttered. "Ach! What nonsense. How a
catspaw?"</p>

<p>"Simply enough. With all Europe at each other's throats, and the
United States embroiled, how simple it would be for that Far
Eastern empire to wait till the nations of the white race were bled
white and then strike&mdash;surely, swiftly, with certainty of
success. Our Pacific Coast stripped of its man-power, our fleet
concentrated in the Atlantic... You see? In a week Odun's country
would be entrenched in North America, and then&mdash;world
domination!"</p>

<p>Fear flickered Gans' pig-eyes. Then they glazed over with red
hate. "You talk well, Red Finger. But it will not save you. I shall
not miss this time." His fat finger trembled on the trigger. "You
die&mdash;now!"</p>

<p>The American's long leg darted out, thudded against the
underside of the cabin table. It lifted, crashed against Gans'
rotund belly. The pistol crashed; the shot thudded into wood. Red
Finger was a streak of black action as he hurtled across the
room.</p>

<p>A knife flashed in yellow light from beyond Red Finger's
shoulder, and its gleam was quenched in fat flesh. Blood spurted
from a thick neck, but, uncannily, the crimson blood seemed to
catch only one finger of the counter-spy, the trigger finger of his
right hand, dyed that finger scarlet.</p>
<br>

<p class="first">"VERY good," an oily voice slid into the room. "I
could not have done better myself." The American gasped, lifted to
his feet.</p>

<p>A slender, saturnine sailor was inside the closed door, the
faintest of smiles twisting his tight lips. "But don't try anything
like that on me." The hands that held two flat automatics were
long-fingered, almost effeminate; their skin was oddly tinged, and
the crescents at the base of their queerly pointed nails were
deeply blue, strangely exotic.</p>

<p>"Odun!" Red Finger said quietly. "I might have guessed you'd be
here!"</p>

<p>"Unfortunately&mdash;for you&mdash;I came to the same conclusion
as he did, from the same premises. And Red Finger has put too many
spokes into my wheels for me to miss this opportunity to dispose of
him once and for all." Except for an almost imperceptible odd hiss
the man's English was precise, even stilted. "I regret exceedingly
the necessity of terminating the life of so gallant an
adversary."</p>

<p>Under the film of brown with which he had painted it Red
Finger's face was gray, drawn with defeat. "So you win at last,
Odun! But I wonder if you would grant me a favor."</p>

<p>The characteristic round eyes of his race in the saffron face
were wary. But Odun's tone was courteous, almost regretful. "If I
can, but..." he shrugged, deprecatingly. "I shall not take any
chances with you. You can hardly blame me." He nodded to the
quivering, jellylike mass that had once been the ace of the Nazi
secret agents.</p>

<p>"All I want is a puff at one last cigarette&mdash;yours if you
wish."</p>

<p>Odun's usually impassive countenance showed just a trace of
puzzlement, but his racial code of courtesy forbade refusal, as Red
Finger well knew. "I have none," he said, "but you may take out and
light your own, if you give me your word you will not draw a weapon
instead."</p>

<p>"Thank you," the American responded gravely. "I do give my
word." Then, at Odun's nod, his hand slipped into a pocket, came
out with a package of cigarettes and a lighter. The white tube in
his mouth, a little flame flared at the quick rasp of his thumb and
he inhaled gratefully. "You know," he said. "If America did nothing
else for the world her gift of tobacco entitles Columbus to
immortality."</p>

<p>"But you must admit that it was the East that brought that gift
to its perfection. Just so, when Asia conquers the world, we of the
East will make it a far better place in which to live, even for you
whites."</p>

<p>Red Finger's cigarette glowed redly. "That will be&mdash;"</p>

<p>With the last word a sudden puff sent the cigarette flying
across space into Odun's eyes. The arch-spy's instinctive gesture
to avoid it was uncontrollable, and Red Finger seized that split
second to catapult upon him.</p>

<p>His fists flailed, so fast that they were a mere blur, the spats
of their landing a single sound. Odun crashed against the bulkhead,
Red Finger twisted, had the door open and was through it and over
the rail before the startled seamen outside realized that the door
was open. Someone shouted; muddy water geysered; and the fog and
the night closed their impenetrable veil over the muddy water.</p>
<br>

<p class="first">A SKULKING figure found an alley between two
houses on Thirteenth Street in the block between Third and Fourth
Avenues, and vanished into its shadows. That same figure might have
been seen, had there been anyone to look, wearily climbing a
fire-escape ladder to a roof, flitting shadow-like over gravelled
tin, vanishing into the square, dawn-cast shadow of a brick
chimney. But when the sun's beams filtered across that roof,
minutes later, no human form marked its blank expanse.</p>

<p>Six stories below, the ceiling of Ford Duane's secret cubicle
opened like a trapdoor, and the bookseller's weary form dropped
through. The hook-lined wall open, shut again. And a perennially
weary, young-old man touched flame to his breakfast
gas-stove...</p>

<p>The web holding the Scythe of Death from its disastrous fall
seemed a trifle stronger this morning. But the two grim sentinels
still held their place at each doorpost of Ford Duane's Second-hand
Bookstore.</p>
