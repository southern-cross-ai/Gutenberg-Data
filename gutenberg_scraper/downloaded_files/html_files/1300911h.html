  <h2><a id="intro">INTRODUCTION</a></h2>

  <p class="first">APART from numerous novels, most of which are accessible
  on-line at Project Gutenberg Australia and Roy Glashan's Library, Fred M.
  White published some 300 short stories. Many of these were written in
  the form of series about the same character or group of characters.
  PGA/RGL has already published e-book editions of those series currently
  available in digital form.</p>

  <p>The present 17-volume edition of e-books is the first attempt to offer
  the reader a more-or-less comprehensive collection of Fred M. White's
  other short stories. These were harvested from a wide range of Internet
  resources and have already been published individually at Project Gutenberg
  Australia, in many cases with digitally-enhanced illustrations from the
  original medium of publication.</p>

  <p>From the bibliographic information preceding each story, the
  reader will notice that many of them were extracted from newspapers
  published in Australia and New Zealand. Credit for preparing e-texts
  of these and numerous other stories included in this collection goes
  to Lyn and Maurie Mulcahy, who contributed them to PGA in the course
  of a long and on-going collaboration.</p>

  <p>The stories included in the present collection are presented
  chronologically according to the publication date of the medium from
  which they were extracted. Since the stories from Australia and New
  Zealand presumably made their first appearance in British or American
  periodicals, the order in which they are given here does not correspond
  to the actual order of first publication.

  <p>This collection contains some 170 stories, but a lot more of
  Fred M. White's short fiction was still unobtainable at the time of
  compilation (March 2013). Information about the "missing stories" is
  given in a bibliographic note at the end of this volume. Perhaps they
  can be included in supplemental volumes at a later date.</p>

  <p>Good reading!</p>

  <h2><a id="story2"
     name="story2">2.&mdash;FOUND!</a></h2>

  <h3>Published in <i>The Gentleman's Magazine</i>, Sep 1890</h3>

  <p class="intro">The story is taken from the on-line version of the bound
  edition of <i>The Gentleman's Magazine</i>, Volume CCLXIX, July-December
  1890, at www.archive.org.</p><br>

  <p class="first">IT was getting late: the last omnibus had gone, and the few
  remaining pedestrians in the Euston Road were hurrying homeward, anxious to
  leave that dismal thoroughfare behind. The footsteps, gradually growing
  fainter, seemed to leave a greater desolation, though one man at least
  appeared to be in no hurry as he strode listessly along, as if space and time
  were of one accord to him. A tall, powerful figure, with bronzed features and
  a long brown beard, betrayed the traveller; and, in spite of the moody
  expression of face, there was a kindly gleam in the keen grey eyes&mdash;the
  air of one who, though he would have been a determined enemy, would doubtless
  have proved an equally staunch friend.</p>

  <p>A neighbouring clock struck twelve, and Lancelot Graham increased his
  pace; anything was better than the depressing gloom of this dismal
  thoroughfare, with its appearance of decayed gentility and desolate grimy
  pretentiousness. But at this moment a smart pull at the pedestrian's
  coat-tails caused him to turn round sharply, with all his thoughts upon
  pickpockets bent But what he saw was the figure of a child barring his path,
  as if intent upon obstructing further progress.</p>

  <p>"I'se lost," said the little one simply; "will you please find me."</p>

  <p>Graham bent down, so that his face was on a level with the tiny speaker.
  They were immediately beneath a gas-lamp, and the astonished man, as he gazed
  carefully at the child, found her regarding him with eyes of preternatural
  size and gravity. There was not one particle of fear in the small face, in
  its frame of bright, sunny hair&mdash;nothing but the calm resolute command
  of one who issues orders and expects them to be obeyed: a child quaintly but
  none the less handsomely dressed, and evidently well cared for and
  nourished.</p>

  <p>Graham pulled at his beard in some perplexity, and looked round with a
  faint anticipation of finding a policeman. Like most big men, he had a warm
  corner in his heart for children, and there was something in the tiny mite's
  imperiousness which attracted him strangely.</p>

  <p>"And whose httle girl are you?" he asked, gravely.</p>

  <p>"I'se mamma's, and I'se lost, and please will you find me"</p>

  <p>"But I have found you, my dear," Graham responded helplessly, but not
  without an inward laugh at the childish logic.</p>

  <p>"Yes, but you haven't found me prop'ly. I want to be found nice, and taked
  home to mamma, because I'se so dreffly hungry."</p>

  <p>The ingenuous speaker was without doubt the child of a refined mother, as
  her accent and general air betrayed. It was a nice quandary, nevertheless,
  for a single man, said Lance Graham to himself, considering the hour and the
  fact of being a prisoner in the hands of an imperious young lady, who not
  only insisted upon being found, but made a point of that desirable
  consummation being conducted in an orthodox manner.</p>

  <p>"Well, we will see what we can do for you," said Graham, becoming
  interested as well as amused. "But you must tell me where you live, little
  one."</p>

  <p>She looked at him with quiet scorn, as if such a question from a man was
  altogether illogical and absurd. But, out of consideration for such
  lamentable ignorance, the child vouchsafed the desired information.</p>

  <p>"Why"&mdash;with widely-open blue eyes&mdash;"I live with mamma!"</p>

  <p>"This is awful," groaned the questioner. "And where does mamma live?"</p>

  <p>"Why, she lives with me; we both live together."</p>

  <p>Graham leaned against the lamp-post and laughed outright. To a lonely man
  in London&mdash;and Alexander Selkirk in his solitude was no more excluded
  from his fellows than a stranger in town&mdash;the strange conversation was
  at once pleasant and piquant. When he recovered himself a little, he asked
  with becoming and respectful gravity for a little information concerning the
  joint-author of the little blue-eyed maiden's being.</p>

  <p>"He's runned away," she replied with a little extra solemnity. "He runned
  away just before I became a little girl."</p>

  <p>Lance became conscious of approaching symptoms of another fit of laughter,
  only something in the fearless violet eyes checked the rising mirth.</p>

  <p>"He must have been a very bad man, then," he observed.</p>

  <p>"He runned away," repeated the child, regarding her new-found friend with
  reproachful gravity, "and mamma loves him, she does."</p>

  <p>"And do you love him too, little one?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I love him too. And when I say my prayers I say, 'Please God, bless
  dear runaway papa, and bring him home again, for Jesus' sake, amen.'"</p>

  <p>Graham, hard cynical man of the world as he was, did not laugh again.</p>

  <p>A man must be far gone, indeed, if such simple earnestness and touching
  belief as this cannot move him to the core. All the warmth and love in his
  battered heart went out to the child in a moment.</p>

  <p>"I do not know what to do with you," he observed. "I do not know who your
  mamma is, but I must look after you, young lady."</p>

  <p>"I'se not a young lady; I'se Nelly. Take me home to mamma."</p>

  <p>"But I don't know where she is," said Graham forlornly.</p>

  <p>"Then take me home to your mamma."</p>

  <p>"Confiding," said Graham, laughing again, "not to say com- placent, only
  unfortunately I don't happen to have one."</p>

  <p>"I dess you're too big," said Nelly, with a little nod, and then, as if
  the whole matter was comfortably settled, "Carry me."</p>

  <p>"Suppose I take you home with me?" Graham observed, having quickly
  abandoned the idea of proceeding to the nearest police-station, "and then we
  can look for mamma in the morning. I think you had better come with me," he
  added, raising the light burden in his arms.</p>

  <p>"All right," Nelly replied, clasping him lovingly round the neck, and
  laying her smooth cheek comfortably against his bronzed face. "I fink that
  will be very nice. Then you can come and see mamma in the morning, and
  perhaps she will let you be my new papa."</p>

  <p>"What about the other one?" asked Graham.</p>

  <p>"Oh, then I can have two," replied the little lady, by no means abashed;
  "we can play at horses together. Where do you live?"</p>

  <p>The speaker put this latter question with great abruptness, as children
  will when they speak of matters quite foreign to the subject under
  discussion.</p>

  <p>"Not very far from here," Lance replied meekly.</p>

  <p>"I'se so glad. I'se <i>dreffly</i> hungry. And I like milk for
  supper."</p>

  <p>Mr. Graham smiled at this broad hint, and dutifully promised that the
  desired refreshment should be forthcoming at any cost.</p>

  <p>The walk, enlivened by quaint questions and scraps of childish philosophy,
  proved to be a short one, and, indeed, from Euston Road to Upper Bedford
  Place can scarcely be called a long journey. So Graham carried his tiny
  acquaintance to his room, and installed her in state before the fire, bidding
  her remain there quietly while he retired to consult his landlady upon the
  important question of supper.</p>

  <p>Little Nelly's remark was not beside the mark, when she confessed to the
  alarming extent of her appetite, for the bread and milk disappeared with
  considerable celerity, nor did the imperturbable young lady disdain a plate
  of biscuits suggested by Graham as a follower. Once the novelty of the
  situation had worn off, he began to enjoy ihf pleasant sensation, and to note
  with something deeper than pleasure his visitor's sage remarks and noticeable
  absence of anything like shyness. When she had concluded her repast, she
  climbed upon his knee in great content.</p>

  <p>"Tell me a tale," she commanded; "a nice one."</p>

  <p>"Yes, my darling, certainly," Graham replied, feeling as if he would have
  attempted to stand on his head, if she had called for that form of
  entertainment. "What shall I tell you about?"</p>

  <p>"Bears. The very, <i>very</i> long one about the three bears."</p>

  <p>"I am afraid I can't remember that," Lance returned meekly. "You see, my
  education has been neglected. If it had been tigers now&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well," said the imperious Nelly, with a sigh of resignation, and perhaps
  a little in deprecation of such deplorable ignorance, "I dess the bears will
  have to wait. Only it must be about a real tiger."</p>

  <p>Graham, obedient to this request, proceeded to relate a personal adventure
  in the simplest language at his command. That he should be so doing did not
  appear to be the least ludicrous. As if he had been a family man, and the
  child his own, he told the thrilling story.</p>

  <p>"I like tales," said Nelly, when at length the thrilling narrative
  concluded. "Did you ever see a real lion?"</p>

  <p>"Often. And now, isn't it time little girls were in bed?"</p>

  <p>"But I don't want to go to bed. And I never go till I'se said my
  prayers."</p>

  <p>"Well, say them now, then."</p>

  <p>"When I'se a bit gooder. I'se got a naughty think inside me." When the
  naughty think's gone, then I'll say my prayers."</p>

  <p>"But I want to go to bed myself."</p>

  <p>"You can't go till I'se gone," Nelly returned conclusivel&lt;. "Tell me
  all about lions."</p>

  <p>"Don't know anything about lions."</p>

  <p>"Then take me home to mamma."</p>

  <p>"My dear child," said Graham, with a gravity he was far from feeling,
  "can't you understand that you must wait till morning. They have made you a
  nice bed, and it's very late for little girls to be up."</p>

  <p>"Let me see it. Carry me."</p>

  <p>The imperious tones were growing very drowsy. When at length Graham's
  rubicund, good-natured landlady called him into the room, he stopped in the
  doorway in silent admiration of perhaps the prettiest picture he had ever
  seen. With her face fresh and rosy, her fair golden hair twisted round her
  head, she stood upon the bed and held out a pair of arms invitingly.</p>

  <p>"What, not asleep yet?" he asked, "and nearly morning, too."</p>

  <p>The old look of reproach crept into the child's sleepy eyes. "Not till I
  have said my prayers. Take me on your lap while I say them."</p>

  <p>Graham placed the little one on his knee, listening reverently to the
  broken medley of words uttered with the deepest solemnity. Yet every word was
  distinctly uttered, even to the plea for the absent father, till the listener
  found himself wondering what kind of man this recalcitrant parent might be.
  Presently Nelly concluded. "And God bless you," she exclaimed lovingly,
  accompanying her words with a kiss. "And now I will go to sleep."</p><br>

  <p style="text-align:center">* * * * *</p>

  <p class="first">WHEN Graham woke next morning he did so with a violent pain
  at his chest, and a general feeling that his beard was being forcibly torn
  from his chin. It was early yet, but his tiny visitor was abroad. She had
  established herself upon the bed, where she was engaged in some juvenile
  amusement, in which the victim's long beard apparently played an important
  part in the programme. As he opened his eyes the child laughed merrily.
  "Don't move," she exclaimed peremtorily; "I'se playing horses. You'se the
  horse, and these is the reins," and giving utterance to these words, she gave
  a sharp pull at his cherished hirsute appendage, and recommenced her
  recreation vigorously.</p>

  <p>A man may be passionately fond of children, but when it comes to healthy
  child lying upon his chest, and a pair of lusty little arms tugging at a
  sensitive portion of his anatomy, the time has arrived when a little
  admonition becomes almost necessary.</p>

  <p>"Nelly, you are hurting me," Graham cried sharply.</p>

  <p>She looked in his face a moment, apparently seeking to know if he spoke
  with a dual meaning, as children ofttimes do. Then, deciding that he spoke
  the truth, there came an affectionate reaction in his favour.</p>

  <p>"Poor, poor!" she said soothingly, rubbing her cheek against his. "Nelly
  is a naughty girl, and I'se so sorry."</p>

  <p>"You are a good little girl to say you are sorry."</p>

  <p>"Give me some sweeties then," Nelly answered promptly. "Whenever I tell
  mamma I'se sorry she says 'good little girl,' and gives me sweeties."</p>

  <p>"Presently, perhaps. And now run away while I dress."</p>

  <p>Obedient to this request, the child kissed him again, and after one
  regretful glance at the beard, and a sigh for the vanished equestrian
  exercise, jumped from the bed and disappeared. Graham was not, however,
  destined to be left long in peace over his toilet, which was not more than
  half completed when Nelly returned again, and seating herself in a chair,
  watched gravely every movement of this deeply interesting ceremony.</p>

  <p>"Isn't you going to shave?" she asked reproachfully, as Graham with a
  smile indicated that his labour was complete.</p>

  <p>"I never shave," he answered. "What would you have to play horses with if
  I did?"</p>

  <p>This practical logic seemed to confound Miss Nelly for a moment, but with
  the pertinacity worthy of a better cause she replied:</p>

  <p>"All <i>gentlemans</i> shave. There is one in our house, and I go to him
  every morning. I like to see him scrape the white stuff off&mdash;I'se
  <i>dreffly</i> hungry."</p>

  <p>But by this time Graham had grown quite accustomed to these startling
  changes in the flow of Miss Nelly's eloquence, though he could not fail to
  admit the practical drift of the concluding observation.</p>

  <p>"Nelly," he asked seriously, when the healthy appetite had been fully
  appeased. "Let us go to business. Now, what is mamma's name?"</p>

  <p>"Nelly, too," the child replied. "Pass the bread and butter please."</p>

  <p>"And you do not know where you live?"</p>

  <p>"No. But it isn't far from the stason, where the trains are. I can hear
  them all day when mamma is out."</p>

  <p>"Not a particularly good clue in a place like London," reflected the
  questioner. "What is mamma like?" he asked. "What does she do?"</p>

  <p>"She is very beautiful, beautifuller than me, ever so," she answered
  reverently. "And she goes out at night&mdash;And once she look me. There were
  a lot of people, whole crowds of them, and when mamma came in her beautiful
  dress they all seemed very glad to see her, I thought."</p>

  <p>Evidently an actress, Graham determined&mdash;and some clue, though still
  a very faint one. Still, by the time breakfast was concluded, he had matured
  his plan of action. He hailed a passing cab, and drove away with the
  intention in the first place of visiting the nearest police-station in the
  neighbourhood of the Euston Road, as the most likely place to glean the
  information of which he was in search.</p>

  <p>"Are we going back to mamma?" Nelly asked as they drove away.</p>

  <p>"Yes, darling, if we can find her," Graham replied gravely. He began to
  comprehend how much the involuntary little guest would be missed. "She must
  have been terribly anxious about you."</p>

  <p>"She will cry then," Nelly observed reflectively. "She often cries at
  night when I am in bed, and says such funny things. Did your mamma cry when
  she put you to bed?"</p>

  <p>"I can't remember," said Graham carelessly. "I dare say she did, I used to
  be very naughty at times."</p>

  <p>"But big people can't be naughty&mdash;only little boys and girls; mamma
  says so, and she is always right."</p>

  <p>"I hope so. What will she say to her naughty little girl?"</p>

  <p>"I know," came the confident reply: "she will look at me as if she is
  going to beat me, then she will cry, like she does when I ask about
  papa."</p>

  <p>But any further confidences were checked by the arrival of the cab at the
  police-station. The interview was not however entirely satisfactory. A
  stern-looking but kindly guardian of the peace, replying to Graham's
  questions, vouchsafed the information that no less than five people had
  visited the station during the previous night in search of lost children. It
  was a common occurrence enough, though usually the children were speedily
  found. In his perplexity Graham suggested that if the officer saw Miss Nelly
  he might perchance be able give some information; in answer to which the
  constable shook his head doubtfully. Directly he saw the child his stolid
  face lightened.</p>

  <p>"Bless me, of course I know her!" he exclaimed. "My wife keeps
  lodging-house, and this young lady's mother lives in the same street. I can
  give you the address if you like, sir, or I will take charge of her."</p>

  <p>Graham demurred to this proposal for two reasons: first, because he felt a
  strange reluctance in parting with his tiny friend; and, secondly, he felt
  some curiosity to see the mother.</p>

  <p>The house to which he found himself directed was by no means a
  striking-looking one, nor by any stretch of imagination could it be called
  aristocratic. There was about it a general air of pretentious
  seediness&mdash;dingy curtains and windows more or less grimy in contrast to
  a new red front: a house to be summed up in the expressive expression
  "shabby-genteel"&mdash;such an abode, in fact, as is usually affected by
  those who have "seen better days." In answer to the bell, and on inquiring
  for Mrs. Gray, a swarth domestic vouchsafed the information that she was in,
  coupled with a side-whisper to Miss Nelly conveying the dire intelligence
  that she would "catch it."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Gray was not yet down, Graham discovered, having been out very late
  the previous night in search of her child. In answer to an invitation, Graham
  followed the dusky maid up the innumerable stairs leading to Mrs. Gray's
  room.</p>

  <p>He had ample time to note the common hard furniture, the never-failing
  neutral-tinted Brussels carpet, and the dim-looking glass, termed by courtesy
  a mirror, above a mantel decorated with those impossible blue shepherdesses,
  without which no London lodging-house is complete. Some wax flowers under a
  glass-case and a few play-bills scattered about completed the adornment of an
  apartment calculated to engender suicidal feehngs in the refined spectator,
  Graham had time to take in all this; and at the moment when man's natural
  impatience began to assert itself, a rustle of drapery was heard, and Mrs.
  Gray entered.</p>

  <p>She was tall and fair, in age apparently not more than five-and-twenty
  years, with a fine open face, its natural sweetness chastened by the presence
  of some poignant sorrow. As she saw the child, a bright smile illuminated
  every feature, and she snatched Miss Nelly to her arms, covering her with
  kisses; indeed, so absorbed was she in this occupation that she failed to
  note Graham's presence until Nelly pointed in his direction. Then, and not
  till then, she looked up to him, her eyes filled with tears. His back being
  to the light, his features were to be seen but indistinctly.</p>

  <p>"I have to thank you deeply," she said, and her voice was very pleasant to
  the listener. "You will pardon a mother's selfishness. All night&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Graham, at first half-dazed, like a man in a dream, came quickly forward,
  and with one bound stood by the speaker's side. He had turned towards the
  light. She could distinguish every feature now.</p>

  <p>"Nelly!"</p>

  <p>"Lance!"</p>

  <p>For a few moments they stood in a kind of dazed fascination, the eyes of
  each fell upon each other's face. But gradually the dramatic instinct
  inherent in woman, and carefully trained in her instance, came to Mrs. Gray's
  assistance. With a little gesture of scorn, she drew her skirts a little
  closer round her, and as her coldness increased so did Graham's
  agitation.</p>

  <p>"Well, what have you to say to me?" she asked, with quiet scorn. "Have you
  any excuse to offer after all these years? What! no words, no apology even,
  for the woman you have wronged so cruelly?"</p>

  <p>"I did not wrong you&mdash;not intentionally, at least," said Graham, with
  an effort. "No, there has been no forgetfulness; my memory is as long as
  yours. It seems only yesterday that I returned from Paris to find my home
  empty, and proofs, strong as Holy Writ, of your flight."</p>

  <p>"And you believed? You actually believed that I&mdash; Shall I condescend
  to explain to you how I received a letter to say you were lying there at the
  point of death, and that I, in honour bound, came to you&mdash;only to find
  that a scoundrel had deceived us both."</p>

  <p>"But I wrote no letter. I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I know you did not&mdash;all too late. I know that I was lured to Paris
  by a vile schemer who called himself your friend. And when I returned, what
  did I find? That you had gone, never giving me a chance to clear myself.
  Deceived once, you must needs fancy deceit everywhere."</p>

  <p>"But I was ruined," cried Graham. "That scoundrel Leslie had disposed of
  every penny of our partnership money. I must have been mad. I followed him,
  but we never met till last May; out in California that was. He was dying when
  I found him; and before he died he told me everything. Nelly, I only did what
  any other man would have done. Put yourself in my place, and say how you
  would have acted."</p>

  <p>"How would I have acted?" came the scornful reply. "I would have trusted a
  little. Do you think, if they had come to me and shown me those proofs, I
  would have believed? Never!"</p>

  <p>"Helen, listen to me one moment. I mad then, mad with despair and
  jealousy, or perhaps I might hesitated. Let us forget the past and its
  trials, and be again as we were before. I was wrong, and bitterly have I
  atoned for my hasty judgment. I am rich now."</p>

  <p>"You are rich! Who cares for your riches?" Helen Graham answered
  passionately, conscious that his words had moved her deeply. "What is wealth
  when there is no love, or which has been killed by doubt? There would always
  be something between us, some intangible&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"My dear wife, for the sake of the little one." Graham had touched upon a
  sympathetic chord, and he continued, " It was no mere coincidence which led
  me to find her last night Nelly, never at any time during the last four
  miserable years have I forgotten you. By hard work I have found my lost
  fortune, but I have not found forgetfulness."</p>

  <p>He pointed to the wondering child, who stood regarding the speakers with
  eyes of deep intense astonishment. The tears rose unbidden to the mother's
  eyes, but she dashed them passionately away.</p>

  <p>"Do you think I have never suffered," she cried, "all this time, with a
  taint upon me, and the hard struggle I have had to live? As you stand there
  now you doubt my innocence."</p>

  <p>"As Heaven is my witness, no!" Graham answered brokenly. "I am no longer
  blind."</p>

  <p>"I thank you for those words, Lance," came the reply with a certain soft
  cadence. "I know you loved me once."</p>

  <p>"And I do now. I have never ceased to love you."</p>

  <p>"Do not interrupt me for a moment. For the sake of your kindness to my
  child I forgive you. Friends we may be, but nothing more. She is your child
  as well as mine. I cannot hinder you from seeing her, for the law gives you
  that power, I know."</p>

  <p>"The law! " Lance returned bitterly; "things are come to a fine pass when
  husband and wife, one in God's sight, can calmly discuss the narrow laws of
  man's making. In this little while the child has twined herself round my
  heart more than I dare confess. I cannot come to you as a friend, you know I
  cannot. I will not take the little one away from you, and there is no middle
  course for me to adopt."</p>

  <p>There was another and more painful silence than the last. All the dramatic
  scorn had melted from the injured wife's heart, and left nothing but a warm
  womanly feeling behind. Strive as she would, there was something magnetic in
  Graham's pleading tones, conjuring up a flood of happy memories from the
  forgotten past. Graham, throwing all pride to the winds and perfect in his
  self-abasement, spoke at length, speaking with a quiet tender earnestness,
  infinitely more dangerous than any wild exhortation could be.</p>

  <p>"Nelly, I must have the truth," said he; "I am alone in the world, nay
  more, for I am beginning to realise what I have lost. If you will look me in
  the face and tell me that all the old love is dead, I will go away and
  trouble you no more."</p>

  <p>"But as a friend, Lance. Surely if I might&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Graham beckoned the little Nelly to his side and took her on his knee.
  "Little sweetheart," he asked, "tell me all you told me last night about your
  wicked runaway father. Who taught you to say 'God bless dear papa and send
  him home again,' as you said to me last night?"</p>

  <p>"Mamma," said Nelly confidentially, "and she says so too." Graham looked
  up with a smile. There were tears in his wife's eyes beyond the power of
  control, and a broken smile upon her face. "Let the little one decide," she
  said.</p>

  <p>Lance leant down and kissed his child with quivering lips. Then with one
  of her imperious gestures, she pointed to her mother and bade him kiss her
  too. There was a momentary hesitation, a quick movement on either side, and
  Helen Graham was sobbing unrestrainedly in her husband's arms.</p>

  <p>"As if I could have let you go," she said at length. "Oh, I always knew
  you would find the truth some day, Lance."</p>

  <p>"Yes, thank Heaven," he said gravely. "Providence has been very good to
  us, darling."</p>

  <p>He turned to little Nelly. "Do you know who I am?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh yes, yes," she cried, clapping her hands gleefully, "You are my own
  dear runaway papa. Mamma, you mustn't let him run away any more."</p>

  <p>"You will find him if he does," said Helen, with a glorious smile. "but I
  am not afraid."</p><br>

  1890</h3>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p class="first">"SUNNY APRIL" of the poet's fancy had faded into May; and at
  length had succumbed to the warmth of early summer. Though the season had
  been a late one, hedges and sloping woodlands glowed with a tender mass of
  greenery against a snowy background of pear-blossom and pink-flushed
  apple-bloom. The fortunate "ten thousand," dragged captive behind the gilded
  chariot of Fashion, turned their faces from the fresh born beauty, now at its
  best and brightest, to slave and toil, to triumph and be triumphed over; for
  the first drawing-room was "ancient history," and the lilacs in the Park were
  fragrant with pink flowers. Town was very full&mdash;that is to say, the four
  odd thousands of suffering, struggling humanity were augmented by the handful
  of fellow-creatures who aspire to lead the world and make the most of life.
  The Academy had opened its door for nearly a month, and the
  <i>dilettante</i>, inspired by the critics, had stamped with the hall-marks
  of success the masterpieces of Orchardson and Solomon, had dwelt upon the
  vivid classicality of Alma Tadema, and listened in languid rapture on opera
  nights to Patti and Marie Roze. Already those who began to feel the heat and
  clamor of "the sweet shady side of Pall Mall" sighed in secret for the
  freshness of green fields, and were counting the days which intervened
  between them, and "royal Ascot."</p>

  <p>It is a fine thing, doubtless, to be one of Fortunatus's favorities, to
  rise upon gilded pinions, and to soar whither one listeth; to be in a
  position to transport the glorious freshness of the country into the stifled
  atmosphere of towns. Down the sacred streets, sun-blinds of fancy hues and
  artistic arrangement repelled the ardent heat, filtered the light through
  silken draperies of pink and mauve on to pyramids and banks of fragrant
  flowers, gardenias and orchids, and the deep-blue violets fresh and dewy from
  the balmy Riviera itself.</p>

  <p>A glorious day had been succeeded by a perfect night. Gradually the light
  deepened till the golden outlines of the mansions in Arlington street gave
  promise of the coming moon, rising gradually, a glowing saffron crescent,
  into the blue vault overhead. From every house there seemed to float the
  sound of revelry; a constant line of carriages filtered down the street; and
  many outcasts, drifting Heaven alone knows where, caught a passing glimpse of
  fairyland between the ferns and gleaming statuary, behind doors flung, with
  mocking hospitality, open.</p>

  <p>There was one loiterer there who took slight heed of those things. His
  shabby raiment might at one time have been well made, but now it was no
  longer presentable in such an aristocratic quarter; his boots, trodden down
  at heel, were a scant protection against the heat of the fiery pavement. The
  face was that of a man who had seen better days, a young face, not more than
  30 at the outside, a handsome countenance withal, but saddened by care and
  thought, and the hard lines of cultivated cynicism, peculiar to the
  individual who is out of suits with fortune. For a moment he stood idly
  watching an open door, before which stood a neatly-appointed brougham; and
  within the brilliantly lighted vestibule, half in shadow and half in the
  gloom, a tall graceful figure loitered, a haughty-looking woman, with a black
  lace mantilla twisted round her uplifted head. It was a striking
  picture&mdash; the dainty aristocrat within, the neglected wanderer without;
  he half shrinking in the shadows, she clear-cut as cameo against the blazing
  light, a background of flowers and ferns to show off her regal beauty. As she
  swept down, the steps at length towards the carriage, something bright and
  shining fell from her throat, and lay gleaming on the marble tiles at her
  feet. Apparently the loss was unnoticed, for the brougham door was closed
  behind her before the stranger stepped forward and raised the trinket from
  its perilous position.</p>

  <p>"I think you have dropped this," he said quietly, with a tone and ease of
  manner in startling contrast to his appearance. "May I be allowed to restore
  it to you?"</p>

  <p>The haughty beauty, disturbed in some pleasant reverie, looked up almost
  without catching the meaning of the words. She saw nothing more than a humble
  individual of a class as distinct from her own as the poles are apart, who,
  perhaps in the hope of a small reward, had hastened to restore the lost
  property to its rightful owner.</p>

  <p>"Oh, thank you," she replied, half turning in his direction, at the same
  time, taking the brooch, and placing a piece of money in the stranger's hand.
  "I should have been greatly distressed to have lost this."</p>

  <p>"The miniature, must be valuable," returned the stranger, mechanically
  regarding the coin in his hand. "But you will pardon me in calling attention
  to another mistake&mdash; You have given me a sovereign."</p>

  <p>"You scarcely deem it enough," said the girl, with a half-smile, as the
  strange anomaly of her position flashed across her mind. "If&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"On the contrary, madam, I am more than rewarded."</p>

  <p>"No," as she once more opened the little ivory purse.</p>

  <p>Again the palpable absurdity of her situation struck the listener. That
  she was speaking to a man of education there was no longer reason to doubt.
  And yet the fact of his accepting the sovereign severely militated against
  the fact of his being what his language implied.</p>

  <p>"You surely are a man of education, are you not?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Really, I can hardly tell you," he answered with some confusion. Then,
  suddenly pulling himself together, he said: "But I am presuming. It is so
  long since a lady spoke to me, that for a moment I have forgotten that I am
  what I am."</p>

  <p>He had lost himself for a moment, thinking himself back in the world
  again, till his eyes fell upon the silver harness glittering in the
  moonlight, and the marble statuary gleaming in the vestibule behind. But the
  listener drew herself up none the higher, and regarded him with a look of
  interest in her dark dreamy eyes.</p>

  <p>"I do not think so," she said, "and I-I am sorry for you if you need my
  pity. If I can do anything&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Some sudden thought seemed to strike her, for she turned half away, as if
  ashamed of her interest in the stranger, and motioned the servant to close
  the carriage door behind hor. The loiterer watched the brougham till it
  mingled with the stream of vehicles, and then, with a sigh, turned away.</p>

  <p>"281 Arlington street," he murmured to himself. "I must remember that. And
  they say there is no such thing as fate! Vere, Vere, if you had only known
  who the recipient of your charity was."</p>

  <p>He laid the glittering coin on his palm, so that the light streamed upon
  it, and gazed upon the little yellow disc as if it had been some priceless
  treasure. In his deep abstraction he failed to notice that standing by his
  side was another wayfarer, regarding the sovereign with hungry eyes.</p>

  <p>"Mate," exclaimed the mendicant eagerly, "that was very nigh being
  mine."</p>

  <p>The owner of the coin turned abruptly to the speaker. He beheld a short
  powerful-looking individual, dressed in rough cloth garments, his closely-
  cropped bullet-shaped head adorned by a greasy fur cap, shiny from long wear
  and exposure to all kinds of weather.</p>

  <p>"It might have been mine," he continued "only you. were too quick for me.
  With a sick wife and three children starvin" at home, it's hard."</p>

  <p>"Where do you live?" asked the fortunate one abruptly.</p>

  <p>"Mitre Court, Marchant street, over Westminster bridge. It's true what I'm
  telling you. And if you could spare a shillin'&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The questioner took five shillings from his pocket and laid them on his
  open palm. As he replied, he eyed his meaner brother in misfortune with a
  shady glance, in which sternness was not altogether innocent of humour.</p>

  <p>"I have seen you before," he observed, "and so, if I am not mistaken, have
  the police. You can have the five shillings, and welcome, which just leaves
  me this one sovereign. I am all the more sorry for you becouse I have the
  honor of residing in that desirable locality myself."</p>

  <p>So saying, and dropping the coins one by one into the mendicant's
  outstretched hand, and altogether ignoring his fervid thanks, John
  Winchester, to give the wanderer his proper name, walked on, every trace of
  cynicism passed from his face, leaving it soft and handsome. His head was
  drawn up proudly, for he was back with the past again, and but for his sorry
  dress, might have passed for one to the manner born.</p>

  <p>Gradually the streets became shabbier and more squalid as he walked along;
  the fine shops gave place to small retailers' place of business; even the
  types of humanity began to change. Westminster Bridge with its long lane of
  lights was passed, till at length the pedestrian turned down one of the dark
  unwholesome lines leading out of the main road, a street with low
  evil-looking houses, the inhabitants of which enjoyed a reputation by no
  means to be envied by those who aspired to be regarded as observers of the
  law. But adversity, which makes us acquainted with strange bedfellows, had
  inured the once fastidious Winchester to a company at once contemptible and
  uncongenial. He pursued his way quietly along till at length he turned into,
  one of the darkest houses, and walking cautiously up the rickety, uneven
  stairs, entered a room at the top of the house, a room devoted to both living
  and sleeping purposes, and illuminated by a solitary, oil-lamp.</p>

  <p>Lying on a bed was a man half asleep, who, as Winchester entered, looked
  round with sleepy eyes; fine gray eyes they might have been, but for their
  red hue and bloodshot tinge, which spoke only too plainly of a life of laxity
  and dissipation. In appearance he was little more, than a youth, a handsome
  youth but for the fretful expression of features and the extreme weakness of
  the mouth, not wholly disguised by a fair moustache.</p>

  <p>"What a time you have been!" he cried petulantly. "I almost go mad lying
  here contemplating these bare walls and listening to those screaming
  children. The mystery to me is where they all come from."</p>

  <p>Winchester glanced round the empty room, all the more naked and ghastly by
  reason of certain faint attempts to adorn its native hideousness, and smiled
  in contemptuous self-pity. The plaster was peeling from the walls, hidden
  here and there by unframed water-colors, grim in contrast; while in one
  corner an easel had been set up, on which a half-finished picture had been
  carelessly thrust. Through the open windows a faint fetid air percolated from
  the court below in unwholesome currents, ringing with the screams of
  children, or the sound of muffled curses in a deeper key.</p>

  <p>"'Tis sweet to know there is an eye will mark our coming, and grow
  brighter when we come.' Poverty calls for companionship, my dear Chris. Why
  not have come out with me and seen the great world enjoying itself? I have
  been up west doing Peri at the gates of Paradise."</p>

  <p>"How can I venture out?" exclaimed the younger man with irritation. "How
  can a man show himself in such miserable rags as these? It isn't every one
  who is blessed with your cosmopolitan instincts&mdash; But enough of this
  frivolity. The first great question is, have you had any luck? The second,
  and of no less importance, how much?"</p>

  <p>"In plain English, have I any money? <i>Voilà</i>!"</p>

  <p>Winchester drew the precious coin from his pocket and flung it playfully
  across to his companion. His eyes glittered, his face flushed till it grew
  almost handsome again then he turned to the speaker with a look nearly
  approaching gratitude, or as near that emotion as a weak selfish nature can
  approach. Winchester laughed, not altogether pleasantly, as he noticed
  Ashton's rapidly-changing expression of feature.</p>

  <p>"'Pon my word, Jack, you are a wonderful fellow and what I should do
  without you I dare not contemplate. Have you found any deserving
  picture-dealer who had sufficient discrimination to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Picture-dealer!" Winchester echoed scornfully. "Mark you, I have been
  doing what I never did before&mdash;something, I trust, I shall never be
  called to do again. I told you I had been up west, and so I have, hanging
  about the great houses in expectation of picking up a stray shilling; I, John
  Winchester, artist and gentleman. And yet, someway, I don't feel that I have
  quite forfeited my claim to the title."</p>

  <p>"You are a good fellow, Jack, the best friend I ever had," said Chris
  Ashton after a long eloquent pause. "I should have starved, I should have
  found a shelter in jail, or a grave in the river long ago, had it not been
  for you. And if it had not been for me, you would be a useful member of
  society still. And yet, I do not think I am naturally bad; there must be some
  taint in my blood, I fancy. What a fool I have been, and how happy I was till
  I met Wingate."</p>

  <p>The melancholy dreariness of retrospection, the contemplation of what
  might have been dimmed the gray eyes for a moment while Winchester, his
  thoughts far away, pulled his beard in silent rumination.</p>

  <p>"When you left the army three years ago&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"When I was cashiered three years ago," Ashton corrected. "Don't mince
  matters."</p>

  <p>"Very well. When you were cashiered for conduct unbecoming an officer and
  a gentleman, you came to me, and I saved you from serious consequences. You
  were pretty nearly at the end of your tether then, and Wingate was quite at
  the end of his; you had spent all your share of your grandfather's money, and
  your sister had helped you also. When Wingate stole that forged bill of
  yours, that I had redeemed, from my studio, you thought it was merely to have
  a hold upon you, in which you are partly mistaken. He kept it because he
  imagined that, by making a judicious use of the document, your sister might
  be induced to marry him to shield you."</p>

  <p>"At any rate, he profited little by that scheme. There was a time, Jack,
  when I thought you were in love with Vere."</p>

  <p>Winchester bent forward till his face rested on his hands.</p>

  <p>"I always was; I suppose I always shall. If it had not been for your
  grandfather's money&mdash; But there is nothing ito be gained by this idle
  talk. That is the only thing I have to regret in my past, that and my own
  fruitless idleness. Carelessly enough, I sacrificed all my happiness. Little
  Vere, poor child! What would she say if I were to remind her of a scertain
  promise now!"</p>

  <p>"Marry you!" Ashton replied with conviction. "Ay, in spite of
  everything."</p>

  <p>"Winchester laughed joylessly, bitterly, as he listened. He, a social
  outcast, beyond the pale of civilisation almost; she, with beauty and
  fortune, and if rumor spoke correctly, with the strawberry leaves at her
  feet, if she only cared to stoop and raise them to her brows. A sweet vision
  of a fair pleading face, lighted by a pair of dark brown eyes, looking
  trustingly into his own, rose up with faint comfort out of the dead mist of
  five years ago.</p>

  <p>"Some day I fancy you will come together again, you and she, Jack, when I
  am no longer a burden to you. If I could, rid, myself of my Frankstein, my
  old man of the sea, I wouid have one more try. But I cannot my nerve is gone,
  and I am, after all, a poor, pitiful coward&mdash; I must tell you, I must:
  Wingate has been here again."</p>

  <p>There is something very terrible in the spectacle of a strong man crushed
  by the weight of an overwhelming despair. Winchester crossed over and laid
  his hand in all kindness on his friend's shoulder, though his face was black
  and stern. For a moment it seemed that he would give way to the passion
  burning in every vein, but by a great effort he controlled himself.</p>

  <p>"And what is the latest piece of scoundrelism, may I ask?"</p>

  <p>Ashton's face was still turned away from the speaker. His reply came
  painfully, as if the words cost him an effort. "At first I refused, till he
  held that bill over my head and frightened me. It is bad this time, very bad,
  for, disguise it how he will, it is nothing but burglary. They want me to
  help them; they say I can if I will. And if not&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Ah, so it has come to that at last. You know something of the plans, of
  course. Where is the place they propose to honor with a visit?"</p>

  <p>Somewhere in the West End&mdash;Arlington street, I fancy anyway, it is
  some great house, the residence of a well-known heiress. Wingate did not say
  whose, but the number is 280 or 281."</p>

  <p>Winchester's face was very grave now, and almost solemn in its intensity.
  A dim glimmering of the vileness of the plot began to permeate his
  understanding. That Wingate, the before-mentioned scoundrel, knew well who
  the heiress was, he saw no reason to doubt.</p>

  <p>"Chris," said he, with quiet earnestness, "turn over and look me in the
  face;" which the unhappy youth did with a strange feeling of coming
  relief.</p>

  <p>"I told you I had been loitering in the streets to-night, and one of the
  streets I happened to choose was Arlington street&mdash; by chance, as some
  people would say. By the same chance, as I was waiting there, a beautiful
  girl came down the steps to her brougham, arrayed for some gaiety or another.
  In so doing she dropped a beautiful ornament and passed into her carriage
  without noticing her loss. I hastened to restore it to her; my back was to
  the light, so she could not recognise me. But I did recognise her. She gave
  me the sovereign lying there, and what was better, she gave the her sweet
  womanly sympathy. It was not out of any idle curiosity that I made a note of
  the number of the house. I hope you are listening to me, Chris?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, dear old fellow, I am listening."</p>

  <p>"It was 281, and she was the heiress Wingate mentioned. You think the
  coincidence ends here, but not quite. I said that I recognised her; I also
  said she could not recognise me. Can you guess who it was?'</p>

  <p>"Not-not Vere!" Ashton exclaimed brokenly&mdash;"my sister?"</p>

  <p>"It was Vere, changed, more beautiful, but the same Vere. Now, cannot you
  see the whole fiendishness of Wingate's plot? Cannot you see that if anything
  is discovered, he will get off scot-free, when you are implicated? My boy, I
  am going to play a bold stroke for your freedom. I am going to break the vow
  I made five years ago, in the hope that good may come o£ it. Treat Wingate
  for the present as if you are still his tool, and trust me, for beyond the
  darkness I see light at last."</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p class="first">THERE are some of us born and reared far enough beyond the
  contaminating influences of evil, who, nevertheless, take so naturally to
  rascality, that one is prone to ask a question as to whether it is not the
  outcome of some hereditary taint or mental disease. To this aberrant class,
  Anthony Wingate, late of Queen's Own Scarlets, naturally belonged.</p>

  <p>Commencing a promising career with every advantage conferred by birth,
  training, and education, to say nothing of the possession of a considerable
  fortune, he had quickly qualified himself for a prominent position amongst
  those cavaliers of fortune who hover on the debatable land between
  acknowledged vice and apparent respectability. In the language of certain
  contemporaries, he had once been a pigeon before his callow plumage had been
  stripped, and it became necessary to lay out his dearly-bought experience in
  the character of a hawk. Five years of army life had sufficed to dissipate a
  handsome patrimony; five years of racing and gambling, with their concomitant
  vices, at the end of which he awoke to find himself with an empty purse, and
  a large and varied assortment of worldly knowledge. Up to this point, he had
  merely been regarded as a companion to be avoided; as yet, nothing absolutely
  dishonorable had been laid to his charge, only that common report stated that
  Anthony Wingate was in difficulties; and unless he and his bosom friend Chris
  Ashton made a radical change, the Scarlets would speedily have cause to mourn
  their irreparable defection.</p>

  <p>But, unfortunately, neither of them contemplated so desirable a
  consummation. In every regiment there are always one or two fast young 'subs'
  with a passion for <i>ecarté</i> and unlimited loo, and who have no objection
  to paying for that enviable knowledge. For a time this pleasant condition of
  affairs lasted, till at length the crash came.</p>

  <p>One young officer, more astute than the rest, detected the cheats and
  promptly laid the matter before his brothers-in-arms. There was no very grave
  scandal, nothing near so bad as Ashton had suggested to Winchester, only that
  Captains Wingate and Ashton resigned their commissions, and their place knew
  them no more. There was a whisper of a forged bill, some hint of a
  prosecution, known only to the astute sub and his elder brother and
  adviser-in-chief, Lord Bearhaven, and to Vere Dene, Ashton's sister, who is
  reported to have gone down on her knees to his lordship and implored him to
  stay the proceedings. How far this was true, and how Vere Dene came to change
  her name, we shall learn presently, But that there was a forged bill there
  can be no doubt, for Wingate had stolen it from Winchester's studio while
  visiting Ashton, after the crash came and, moreover, he was using it now in a
  manner calculated to impress on Ashton the absolute necessity of becoming the
  greater scoundrel's tool and accomplice. Since that fatal day when he had
  flown to careless bohemian Jack Winchester with the story of his shame, and a
  fervid petition to beg, borrow, or steal the money necessary to redeem the
  fictitious acceptance bearing Bearhaven's name, he had not seen his sister,
  though she, would cheerfully have laid down all her fortune to save him. But
  all the manhood within him was not quite dead, and he shrank, as weak natures
  will, from a painful interview. Winchester had redeemed the bill, and Wingate
  had purloined it.</p>

  <p>Winchester had been brought up under the same roof as Vere Ashton, by the
  same prim puritanical relative, who would hold up her hands in horror at his
  boyish escapades, and predict future evil to arise from the lad's artistic
  passion. It was the old story of the flint and steel, fire and water; so,
  chafed at length by Miss Winchester's cold frigidity, he had shaken the dust
  from his feet, and vowed he would never return until he could bring fame and
  fortune in his train. There was a tender parting between the future Raphael
  and his girlish admirer under the shadow of the beeches, a solemn interchange
  of sentiments, and Jack Winchester started off to conquer the world with a
  heart as light and unburdened as his pocket.</p>

  <p>But man proposes. Vere's mother had been the only daughter of a wealthy
  <i>virtuoso</i>, who had literally turned his only daughter out of doors when
  she had dared to consult her own wishes in the choice of a husband and for
  years, long years after Vere and Chris had lost both parents, he made no
  sign. Then the world read that Vavasour Dene was dead, and had left the whole
  of his immense fortune to his grandchildren three-fourths to Vere on
  condition that she assumed the name of Dene, and the remainder to Chris,
  because, so the will ran, he was the son of his mother. Presently,
  Winchester, leading a jolly bohemian existence in Rome, heard the news, and
  decided, in the cynical fashion of the hour, that Vere would speedily forget
  him now. And so they drifted gradually apart. Winchester had been
  thoughtless, careless, and extravagant living from hand to mouth, in
  affluence one day, in poverty another but he was not without self-respect,
  and he had never been guilty of a dishonorable action. He hated Wingate with
  all the rancour a naturally generous nature was capable of feeling, and set
  his teeth close as he listened.</p>

  <p>"Of course it was only a matter of time to come to this," he said. "Well,
  of all the abandoned scoundrels&mdash; And that man once had the audacity to
  make love to Vere, you say. I wish I had known before."</p>

  <p>"That was a long time ago," Ashton replied, "before&mdash; before we left
  the army, when you were in Rome. Remember, Wingate was a very different man,
  in a very different position then. Do you suppose that he knows whose place
  it is that he contemplates&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"Knows! of course he knows. Now listen to me, Chris, my boy, and answer me
  truthfully. I believe, yes, I do, that if you had a chance you would end this
  miserable life. You say you are in Wingate's power. What I want to know is
  whether he carries that precious paper about with him?"</p>

  <p>"Always, always, Jack. With that he can compel me to anything; the only
  wonder is that I have never forced it from him before now. Still, I do not
  see what that has to do with the matter."</p>

  <p>Winchester smoked in profound silence for a time, ruminating deeply over,
  a scheme which had commenced to shape itself in his ready brain.</p>

  <p>"I don't suppose you do understand," he said dogmatically. "Do you think
  if I were to see Vere she would acknowledge me, knowing whom I am?"</p>

  <p>For answer Ashton laughed almost gaily. "Your modesty is refreshing. Do
  you think she has forgotten you, and the old days at Rose Bank? Never! There
  are better men than you; handsomer, cleverer by far; she meets daily good men
  and true, who would love her for her sweet self alone. She is waiting for
  you, she will wait for you till the end of time. Whatever her faults may be,
  Vere does not forget."</p>

  <p>A dull red flush mounted to the listener's checks, a passionate warmth
  flooded his heart almost to overflowing; but even the quick sangumeness of
  his mercurial disposition could not grasp the roseate vision in its entirety.
  Its very contemplation was too dangerous for ordinary peace of mind.</p>

  <p>"One more thing I wish to know," said he, reverting doggedly to the
  original topic. "Of course the dainty Wingate does not intend to soil his
  fingers by such an act as vulgar burglary. Who is the meaner rascal?"</p>

  <p>"So far as I can gather, a neighbor of ours, a very superior workman, I am
  told, who is suffering from an eclipse of fortune at present. The gentleman's
  name is Chivers&mdash; Benjamin CHivers. Is the name familiar?"</p>

  <p>"Why, yes," Winchester answered dryly, "which is merely what, for a better
  word, we must term another coincidence. The fellow has a most respectable
  wife and three children, who are distinguished from the other waifs in the
  street by a conspicuous absence of dirt. I thought I recognised the fellow's
  face."</p>

  <p>"Recognised his face? Have you seen him, then?"</p>

  <p>Winchester gave a brief outline of his interview with the individual he
  had chanced to encounter in Arlington street. A little circumstance in which
  one day he had been instrumental in saving a diminutive Chivers from condign
  chastisement had recalled the ex-convict's face to his recollection.
  Perhaps&mdash;but the hope was a wild one&mdash;a little judicious kindness,
  and a delicate hint at the late charitable demonstration, might sufficiently
  soften the thief's heart and cause him to betray Wingate's plans. That they
  would not be confided entirely to Ashton he was perfectly aware, and that the
  meaner confederate had been kept, in want of funds by his chief the fact of
  his begging from a stranger amply testified.</p>

  <p>"Which only shows you that truth is stranger than fiction," said he, as he
  rose to his feet and donned his hat. If I only dared to see her and even then
  she might&mdash; but I am dreaming. However, we will make a bold bid for
  freedom. And now you can amuse yourself by setting out the Queen Anne silver
  and the priceless Dresden for supper;" saying which, he felt his way down the
  creaky stairs into the street below.</p>

  <p>The 10 days succeeding the night upon which this important conversation
  was held were so hot that even Ashton, much as he shrank from showing himself
  out of doors in the daytime, could bear the oppressive warmth no longer, and
  had rambled away through Kennington Park Road, even as far as Clapham Common,
  in his desire to breathe a little clear fresh air. Winchester, tied to his
  easel by a commission which, if not much, meant at least board and lodging,
  looked at the blazing sky ahd shook his head longingly. Despite the
  oppressive, overpowering heat, the artist worked steadily on for the next
  three hours. There was less noise than usual in the street below, a temporary
  quiet in which Winchester inwardly, rejoiced. At the end of this time he rose
  and stretched himself, with the comfortable feeling of a man who has earned a
  temporary rest. In the easy <i>abandon</i> of shirt sleeves he leant out of
  the window, contemplating the limited horizon of life presented to his view.
  There were the usual complement of children indulging in some juvenile
  amusement, in which some broken pieces of oyster-shells formed an important
  item, and in this recreation Winchester, who had, like most warm-hearted men,
  a tender feeling towards children, became deeply engrossed. One or two street
  hawkers passed on, crying their wares, and presently round the corner there
  came the unmistakable figure of a lady, followed by a servant in undress
  livery, bearing a hamper in his arms, a burden which, from the expression of
  his face, he by no means cared for or enjoyed.</p>

  <p>"Some fashionable doing the Lady Bountiful," Winchester murmured. "Anyway,
  she has plenty of pluck to venture here. If she was a relation of
  mine&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He stopped abruptly and stared in blank amazement, for there was no
  mistaking the tall figure and graceful carriage of Vere Dene. She passed
  directly under him, and entered a house a little lower down the street with
  the air of one who was no stranger to the locality. In passing the group of
  children, she paused for a moment, and selecting one or two of the cleanest,
  divided between them the contents of a paper parcel she carried. Directly she
  had disappeared, a free fight for the spoils ensued. The interested spectator
  waited a moment to see which way the battle was going, and then hurried down
  the stairs and out into the street towards the combatants. The presence of
  the new ally was sorely needed. The three representatives of the house of
  Chivers were faring sorely in the hands of the common foe. In that
  commonwealth all signs of favor were sternly discountenanced.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean by that?" Winchester demanded, just in time to save the
  whole of the precious sweetmeats. "Don't you know it is stealing, you great
  girls, to rob those poor little children?"</p>

  <p>"They don't mean it, bless you." said a voice at the mediator's elbow,
  "and they don't know any better. It's part of their nature, that's wot it
  is."</p>

  <p>Winchester turned round, and encountered the thickset form and sullen
  features of his Arlington street acquaintance. As their eyes met, those of
  Chivers fell, and he muttered some incoherent form of thanks and
  acknowledgment for the past service. Presently he went on to explain.</p>

  <p>"You see, my wife is better brought up than most of them about here, and
  she do try to keep the childer neat and tidy; and that makes the others
  jealous. They ain't been so smart lately," he continued, with a glance half
  kindly, half shameful, at his now smiling offspring, "'cause mother has been
  poorly lately, and I've been out o' luck too."</p>

  <p>In spite of his shamefaced manner and the furtive look common to every
  criminal, there was something in the man's blunt candour that appealed to
  Winchester's better feelings. Besides, knowing something of the ex-convict
  and his doubtful connection with Wingate, it was to his interest to
  conciliate his companion with a view to possible future advantage.</p>

  <p>"It must be a miserable life, yours," he said not unkindly. "Better, far
  better, try something honest. You will not regret it by-and-bye."</p>

  <p>"Honest, sir Would to heaven I could get the chance! You are a gentleman,
  I can see that, though you do live here, and know what misfortune is. If I
  could only speak with you and get your advice. You have been kind to me, and
  good to my poor little ones, and I'm-I'm not ungrateful. If I could help
  you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Winchester laid his hand upon his companion's shoulder with his most
  winning manner. He began to feel hopeful. "You can help me a great deal,"
  said he; "come up to my room and talk the matter over."</p>

  <p>It was a very ordinary tale to which he had to listen.</p>

  <p>"I was a carpenter and joiner, with a fair knowledge of locksmith's work,
  before I came to London. I was married just before then, and came up here
  thinking to better myself. It wasn't long before I wished myself back at
  home. I did get some work at last, such as it was, a day here and a day there
  till I became sick and tired of it, and ready for anything almost. I needn't
  tell you how I got with a set of loose companions, and how I was persuaded to
  join them... I got 12 months, and only came out 10 weeks ago. I have tried to
  be honest. But it's no use, what with one temptation and another."</p>

  <p>"And so you have determined to try your hand again. You run all the risk,
  and your gentlemanly friend gets all the plunder."</p>

  <p>It was a bold stroke on Winchester's part; but the success was never for a
  moment in doubt. Chivers' coarse features relaxed into a perfect apathy of
  terror. He looked at the speaker in speechless terror and emotion.</p>

  <p>"We will waive that for the present," Winchester continued. "What I wish
  to know is how you have contrived to live for the past 10 weeks?"</p>

  <p>"I was coming to that, sir, when you stopped me. You see, when the trouble
  came, my poor wife didn't care to let her friends know of the disgrace, and
  tried hard to keep herself for a time. But illness came too, and she and the
  little ones were well-nigh starving. Mary, my wife, sir, remembered once that
  she was in service with an old lady, whose niece came into a large fortune.
  Well, she just wrote to her and told her everything. And what do you think
  that blessed young creature does? Why, comes straight down here into this
  den, of a place and brings a whole lot of dainty things along. And that's the
  very lady as is up in my bit of a room at this very minute."</p>

  <p>"I am quite aware of that," said Winchester quietly. "Miss Dene, as she is
  called now, and myself are old friends. I remember everything now. Your wife
  was once a housemaid at Rose Bank; and you are the son of old David Chivers,
  who kept the blacksmith's, shop at Weston village. &mdash;Ben, do you ever
  remember being caught birdnesting in Squire Lechmere's preserves with a
  ne'er-do-well fellow called Jack Winchester?"</p>

  <p>For answer, Chivers burst into tears. Presently, after wiping his eyes
  with the tattered fur cap, he ventured to raise his eyes to his host.</p>

  <p>"You don't mean to say it's Mr Winchester?" he asked brokenly.</p>

  <p>"Indeed, I am ashamed to say it is. This world of ours is a very small
  place, Ben, and this is a very strange situation for you and me to meet. But
  before we begin to say anything touching old times, there is something
  serious to be discussed between us. Remember, you are altogether in my hands.
  I might have waited my opportunity and caught you red-handed. Don't ask me
  for a moment what is my authority, but tell me"&mdash;and here the speaker
  bent forward, dropping his voice to an impressive whisper&mdash;"everything
  about the Arlington street robbery you have planned with that scoundrel
  Wingate."</p>

  <p>Once more, the old look of frightened terror passed like a spasm across
  the convict's heavy features. But taking heart of grace from Winchester's
  benign expression, he, after a long pause, proceeded.</p>

  <p>"I don't know how he found me out, or why he came to tempt me&mdash;not
  that I required much of that either. It seemed all simple enough, and I was
  very short of money just then, and desperate-like, though I won't make any
  excuse. I don't know all the plans&mdash;I don't know yet whose
  house&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Whose house you are going to rob," Winchester interrupted with a thrill
  of exultation at his heart. Then I will tell you as an additional reason why
  you should make a clean breast of it. Perhaps you may not know that Miss Dene
  lives in Arlington street and that Miss Dene, whose name, I see, puzzles you,
  is Miss Ashton, once of Rose Bank?"</p>

  <p>"I didn't know," Chivers exclaimed with sudden interest. "If it is the
  same&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It is the same. She changed her name when she inherited her grandfather's
  fortune. Come, you know enough of Wingate's plans to be able to tell me if
  No. 281, Arlington street, is the house?"</p>

  <p>"As sure as I am a living man, it is," said Chivers solemnly. Mr
  Winchester, I have been bad; I was on the road to be worse; but if I did
  this, I should be the most miserable scoundrel alive. If you want to know
  everything, if you want me to give it up this minute&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I want to know everything, and I certainly do not want you to give it up
  this minute. You must continue with Wingate as if you are still his
  confederate. And of this interview not a word. I think, I really think, that
  this will prove to be the best day's work you have ever done."</p>

  <p>Chivers answered nothing, but drew from a pocket a greasy scrap of paper
  cut from a cheap society paper, and placed it in Winchester's hand. As far as
  he could discern, the paragraph ran as follows</p>

  <p class="newspaper">"The delicate and refined fancy of a 'jewel ball,'
  designed by the Marchioness of Hurlingham, will be the means of displaying to
  an admiring world the finest gems of which our aristocracy can boast. Starr
  and Fortiter, <i>et hoc genus omne</i>, are busy setting and polishing for
  the important event, not the least valuable <i>parure</i> of brilliants in
  their hands being those of Miss Dene, the lovely Arlington street heiress,
  who, rumor says, intends to personify diamonds. Half a century ago the Vere
  diamonds had become quite a household word. Certainly they never had a more
  lovely mistress to display their matchless beauty."</p>

  <p>"That," explained the penitent criminal in a hoarse whisper, is about all
  I know at present. But if I made a guess, I should say it would be the night
  after the ball."</p>

  <h3>III</h3>

  <p class="first">IN POINT of artistic beauty and delicacy of floral
  arrangement throughout Arlington street, No. 281 certainly bore away the
  palm; for Miss Dene, like most country girls, had a positive passion for
  flowers&mdash;a graceful fancy she was fortunately in a position to gratify.
  Many an envious eye fell upon that cool facade with its wealth of glorious
  bloom; many a darling of fashion paused as he passed on his listless way, and
  forgot his betting-book and other mundane speculations to wonder lazily who
  might some day be the fortunate man to call that perfectly-appointed mansion
  and its beautiful mistress his own. For Vere Dene could have picked and
  chosen from the best of them, and graced their ancestrai homes; but now she
  was five-and-twenty; so they came at last to think it was hopeless, and that
  a heart of marble pulsed languidly in that beautiful bosom.</p>

  <p>The hall-door stood invitingly open&mdash;more, perhaps, in reality to
  catch the. faint summer breeze, for the afternoon was hot, and inside, the
  place looked cool, dim, and deliciously inviting. On a table there lay a pair
  of long slim gauntlets, thrown carelessly upon a gold-mounted riding-whip,
  and coming down the shallow stairs, against a background of feathery fern and
  pale gleaming statuary, was Miss Dene herself. A stray gleam of sunshine,
  streaming through a painted window, lighted up her face and dusky
  hair&mdash;a beautiful face, with creamy pallor, overlaid by a roseate flush
  of health. The dark-brown eyes were somewhat large&mdash; a trifle hard, too,
  a stern critic of beauty might have been justified in saying; the tall
  graceful figure drawn up perhaps too proudly.</p>

  <p>Vere Dene was, however, no blushing debutante, but a woman who knew her
  alphabet of life from alpha to omega who was fully conscious of her power,
  and the value of her position well enough to discern between honest
  admiration and studied flattery, and to gather up the scanty grains of truth
  without mistaking chaff for golden corn. There was no reflection of wistful
  memory on the heiress's face as she rode slowly down the street some time
  later, the cynosure of admiring eyes. There was a rush and glitter of
  carriages hurrying parkwards, as she rode on her way alone, bowing to one
  acquaintance or another, and dividing her favors impartially.</p>

  <p>"A beautiful face," murmured a bronzed soldierly-looking man to his
  companion as they lounged listlessly against the rails of the Row, watching
  the light tide of fashion sweeping by.</p>

  <p>"A perfect face, wanting only soul to make it peerless. Who is she,
  Leslie?"</p>

  <p>"Who is she?" laughed the other. "Is it possible you do not know Miss
  Dene?&mdash; But I forgot you had been so long in India. You remember old
  Vavasour Dene, of course, and his son, the poetical genius, who married some
  demure little country maiden, unknown to Debrett or Burke, and who was cut
  off with the traditional shilling accordingly. You can imagine the rest of
  the story a life-long fend between father and son, ending, as it usually
  does, in the parent's dying and cheating condemnation by an act of tardy
  justice. That handsome girl is old Dene's heiress, a woman with all London at
  her feet, a quarter of a million in her own right, and never a heart in the
  whole of her perfect anatomy."</p>

  <p>Wholly unconscious of this storiette, and apparently of the admiration she
  naturally excited, Miss Dene rode, on down the Mile, with many a shake of her
  shapely head as one gloved hand after another beckoned her to range alongside
  barouche or mail-phaeton till at length a slight crush brought her to a
  standstill. Almost in front of her was an open stanhope, wherein was seated a
  delicate fragile-looking lady, exquisitely dressed, and apparently serenely
  indifferent to the glances and smiles in her direction. By her side sat a
  child of six or seven, a diminutive counterpart of herself, to her fair
  golden hair and melting pansy-blue eyes. Vere would fain have pushed her way
  through the crowd and passed on but the child had seen her, and uttered her
  name with a cry of innocent delight and Vere, like many another who is
  credited with want of heart, had a tender love for children.</p>

  <p>"Really, I owe Violet my grateful thanks," murmured the owner of the
  stanhope as Vere ranged alongside. "Positively, I began to fear that you
  meant to cut me. I should never have forgiven my brother, if you had. My dear
  child, I warned him that it was useless; I did indeed. And now he says that
  his heart is broken, and that he shall never believe a woman any more."</p>

  <p>Vere looked down into the Marchioness of Hurlingham's fair demure face
  with a little smile.</p>

  <p>"So Lord Bearhaven has been abusing me?" she said. "I am disappointed. I
  did not think he would have carried his woes into the boudoir."</p>

  <p>"My dear Diana, he has done nothing of the kind. Surely a man might be
  allowed to bewail his hard lot with his only sister. &mdash;Violet, my
  darling child, do be careful how you cross the road."</p>

  <p>"This warning, addressed to the diminutive little lady, who had succeeded
  unseen, in opening the carriage door came too late; for by this time the
  volatile child had recognised some beloved acquaintance over the way, and
  indeed was already beyond the reach of warning. Vere watched the somewhat
  hazardous passage breathlessly, then, satisfied that her small favorite had
  made the dangerous journey in safety, turned to her companion again.</p>

  <p>"I have a genuine regard for Lord Bearhaven," said she, speaking with an
  effort, "too great a regard to take advantage of his friendship under false
  pretences. I shall never forget the kindness he once did me in the hour of my
  great trouble Will you tell him so, please? and say that perhaps for the
  present it will be well for us not to meet."</p>

  <p>"Now, that is so like both of you," Lady Hurlingham cried, fanning herself
  in some little heat. "Why will you both persist in making so serious a
  business. of life? At anyrate, you might have some consideration for us more
  frivolous-minded mortals. Vere, if you do not come to my Jewel Ball on
  Thursday, I&mdash;I&mdash; well, I will never speak to you again."</p>

  <p>"So, I am to be coerced, then. I am morally bound to be present, since the
  Society papers have promised the world a sight of the Vere diamonds; besides
  which, I simply dare not incur your ladyship's displeasure!"</p>

  <p>"I wonder if you have a heart at all," said the other musingly. "Sometimes
  I almost doubt it; and the times I generally doubt it most are immediately
  after those moments when I have flattered myself that I really have begun to
  detect symptoms of that organ. The romantic ones have been libelling again.
  Would you like to hear the latest story?"</p>

  <p>"You stopped me for this, I presume. Positively, you will not know a
  moment's peace till you have told me. I am all attention."</p>

  <p>"They are saying you have no heart, because it was given away long ago;
  they say there is a rustic lover somewhere in hobnails and gaiters who won
  your affections, and is afraid to speak since you became a great lady."</p>

  <p>Vere did not reply or glance for a moment into her friend's sparkling
  mischievous face. A deeper tinge of colour flushed the creamy whiteness of
  neck and brow, like the pink hue upon a snowy rose.</p>

  <p>"They do me too much honor." she replied. "Such a model of constancy in
  this world of ours would indeed be a peril amongst women. Pray, do they give
  a name to this bashful Corydon of mine?"</p>

  <p>"Naturally, nothing but the traditional second cousin, <i>ma chère</i>.
  Really, it is quite a pretty romance the struggling, artistic genius who is
  too proud to, speak, now you are in another sphere. Surely you are not
  offended?"</p>

  <p>In spite of her babyish affectations and infantine innocence, mere
  mannerisms overlaying a tender kindly heart, Helena, Marchioness of
  Hurlingham, was not entirely without an underlying vein of natural
  shrewdness. She was clever enough to see now that the innocently-directed
  shaft of a bow drawn at a venture had penetrated between the joints of Vere's
  armour, in spite of her reputation for being perhaps the most invulnerable
  woman in London.</p>

  <p>"I am not offended," Vere answered, recovering from her chill composure at
  length; "only such frivolity annoys one at times. What a lot of idle scandal
  poor womankind has to endure&mdash;What is that?"</p>

  <p>Gradually above the roll of carriages, the clatter of hoofs, the subdued
  murmur of voices, and light laughter, a louder, sterner hum arose. Borne down
  on the breeze came distant sounds of strife, and now and then a shriek in a
  woman's shrill notes; it seemed to swell as if some panic had stricken the
  heedless crowd further down the drive. Every face, restless and uneasy with
  the sudden consciousness of some coming danger, was turned in the direction
  whence the evidence of trouble arose, as a carriage and pair of horses,
  coming along at lightning speed, scattered pedestrians and riders right and
  left, like a flock of helpless sheep, in a wild medley of confusion.</p>

  <p>As if by magic, a lane seemed to have opened, and coming along the open
  space tore a pair of fiery chestnuts, drawing after them in their fear and
  fright a mail phaeton as if it had been matchwood. With a feeling of relief,
  the helpless spectators noticed that the vehicle was empty, save for its
  driver, who, with bare head and face white as death, essayed manfully to
  steer the maddened animals straight down the roadway, a task rendered doubly
  dangerous and difficult from the crowded state of the Row, and the inability
  of certain tyros to keep the path sufficiently clear.</p>

  <p>In the midst of the turmoil and confusion there arose another cry, a shout
  of fear and unheeded expostulation, for, crossing the roadway smilingly,
  without the semblance of a fear, came a little child, bearing in her hand a
  bunch of roses; a little girl with sunny golden curls and laughing blue eyes,
  standing like a butterfly before a sweeping avalanche. There was another
  shout, and again the tiny passenger failed to note her danger as nearer and
  nearer came the horses, till through the now paralysed, helpless crowd burst
  the figure of a man who without a moment's hesitation sprang forward and
  caught the child just as the pole of the carriage threatened to strike her to
  the ground. There was no longer time for an escape, a fact of which the
  heroic stranger was perfectly aware and grasping the laughing maiden with one
  powerful arm, with the other he made a grab for the off-horse's head, and
  clung to the bridle with the bulldog tenacity of despair. For a moment the
  animals, checked in their headlong career, swerved to the right; there was a
  crashing sound of broken panels, and a moment later child, rescuer, horses,
  and driver lay in an inextricable struggling confusion. For a second or two
  there followed a dread intense silence, as each butterfly of fashion
  contemplated in fascinated horror the struggling mass; then, before the
  nearest could interfere, it was seen that the stranger had risen to his feet,
  his garment soiled and stained, and a stream of ruddy crimson slowly
  trickling down his face. Just for a brief instant he reeled from very
  faintness, till, dashing the blinding blood from his eyes, he stooped
  swiftly, and at the imminent risk of his brains drew the now thoroughly
  frightened child right from those terrible hoofs, and taking her in his arms,
  staggered rather than walked to a seat.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Lady Hurlingham, beside herself with grief, and terror, the
  lady of fashion merged for the moment into the mother, had descended from her
  carriage, her face pale and haggard, and hurried with Vere to the seat where
  the stranger reclined. It was no time for ceremony or class distinction. With
  a gesture motherly and natural, as if she had been moulded of meaner clay,
  she snatched little Violet from the arms still mechanically holding her, with
  a great gush of thankfulness to find that, with the exception of the fright,
  not one single hair of that golden head had been injured.</p>

  <p>By this time the crowd had sufficiently recovered from the threatened
  realisation of sudden death, and, with regained wit, sufficient society
  veneer to murmur the usual polite condolences and congratulations to the now
  elated mother. Still the rescuer sat, his face buried in his hands, a
  whirling, maddening pain in his head, and a mist before his eyes as if the
  world had suddenly lost its sunshine. Vere, with tears in her eyes and a
  tremble in her voice, pushed her way through the too sympathetic crush and
  laid her hand gently oh the sufferer's arm.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid you are hurt," she said. "Can I do anything for you?"</p>

  <p>Winchester, for he it was, looked up vaguely, the words coming to his ears
  like the roar of the sea singing in a dream, a dream which was not all from
  the land of visions. He wondered dreamily where he had heard that voice
  before. With an effort, he looked up again. For the first time in five years
  their eyes met in the full light of day. She knew him now, recognised him in
  a moment. But it was scarcely the same Winchester who had restored her lost
  ornament a fortnight ago. The old shabby raiment had disappeared, giving
  place to a neat suit, such as no gentleman had been ashamed to wear. Fourteen
  days' steady work, inspired by a worthy object, had met an equal reward. It
  was no longer Winchester the outcast that Vere was addressing, but Winchester
  the gentleman, and in his heart he rejoiced that it was so. For a moment they
  were no longer the centre of a glittering host of fashion; their thoughts
  together had gone back to the vanished past, as they looked into each other's
  eyes, neither daring to trust to words.</p>

  <p>"Jack," said Vere at length, "Jack, is it really you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, dear, it is I," Winchester responded faintly. "You did not expect to
  meet me like this&mdash;if you ever expected to meet me at all."</p>

  <p>"Do you think I forget&mdash;as some people do? You did not always judge
  me so harshly. How could we meet better; how could I feel more proud of you
  than I do at this moment?"</p>

  <p>Gradually the crowd fell back. There was not much mischief done after
  all&mdash;nothing that a clothes-brush and a little warm water would not
  rectify. Besides, Miss Dene seemed to know the stranger, and from one or two
  expressions, would apparently prefer to be left alone. Winchester's answering
  smile had no trace of its accustomed bitterness. After all, there was
  something in the soft music of Vere's tones, a charm in the reckless
  abandonment of self which fell upon his troubled heart like balm in Gilead.
  There was something sweet also in the consciousness that he had played the
  man so recently in her sight, under the very eyes whose brightness alone he
  had only valued. There was a stimulant worth all the tonics in the
  pharmacopoeia.</p>

  <p>He would have spoken again, but he was suffering still from a great rush
  of pain and giddiness, as if the whole universe was slipping into space.
  Directly after, the feeling passed away, and he was himself once more. By
  this time Lady Hurlingham had driven away, while some one, more thoughtful
  than the rest, had remained to place his carriage at Winchester's
  disposal.</p>

  <p>"This gentleman is a friend of yours, Miss Dene?" he asked. "Allow me to
  suggest that your groom takes your horse, and that you drive likewise. You
  will pardon my sister's apparent heedlessness, but you see Violet is an only
  child, and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Vere looked gratefully into Lord Bearhaven's grave, handsome face, and
  extended her hand in an impulse of gratitude. The meeting she had so much
  dreaded was made smooth and pleasant by his kindly courtesy.</p>

  <p>"I might have expected this from you," she answered warmly. "Believe me, I
  am deeply obliged. Mr Winchester is not only a friend, but a relation."</p>

  <p>Lord Bearhaven gave Jack a handgrip which said more than the most
  carefully chosen words. But what an effort this magnanimity cost him, only
  Vere, who saw that he had heard everything, alone could tell.</p>

  <p>"I am forgiven, then?" asked Winchester as they drove along Oxford street.
  "Well, it is worth playing the poor part I have played to-day to hear that.
  Vere, Vere, what a sorry self-opinionated fool I have been. Do you know that
  for the last week I have been screwing up my courage to the sticking-point?
  But whenever I found myself near you, my pluck failed."</p>

  <p>"You do not deserve to be spoken to," Vere replied, her cheeks aflame, her
  eyes laden with unshed tears, though the thrilling tenderness of her voice
  robbed the words of their sting. "How dare you venture to treat me as if I
  should be ashamed of my old friends?"</p>

  <p>Up to this point Winchester had scarcely dared to analyse his sensations.
  Now that all the impenetrable barriers of restraint were broken down between
  them, he found himself talking in the old familiar strain, and wondering if
  the last five years were merely a phantasm of his own creation.</p>

  <p>"And Chris," Vere ventured at length, though the question had long been
  trembling on her tongue, "do you eyer hear anything of him?"</p>

  <p>Winchester told her everything, disguising nothing except the part of good
  Samaritan he himself had played towards the unfortunate Ashton. It must have
  been an interesting conversation, for Vere's face as she listened grew yery
  soft and tender, her eyes sweet and luminous. When at length the end of
  Arlington street was reached, Winchester stopped the coachman, and insisted
  upon alighting, a step which Vere vehemently opposed.</p>

  <p>"You are coming home with me," she said. "Have you any idea who you will
  find waiting there to welcome you?"</p>

  <p>"Not the slightest, unless you have persuaded&mdash; but that is
  impossible. Still, you must have a chaperon of some sort. Is it possible that
  you have our clear old Aunt Lucy at Arlington street?"</p>

  <p>"Not only possible, but an actual fact. Come; you cannot refuse now."</p>

  <p>Winchester hesitated for a moment, then, with a sudden impulse, complied.
  Of all his relations, the Aunt Lucy in question was the only one who kept a
  green spot in his recollections. A few moments later he passed a welcome
  guest through the very portals outside which so short a time before he stood
  a wretched outcast and useless member of society.</p>

  <p>Two hours later, when he descended the steps again, with a bright eager
  look of exultation on his face, a servant loitering in the hall saw and
  wondered if it was the same man whom his mistress had brought home so
  recently. He lingered for a moment for a few parting words with Vere.</p>

  <p>"So that is settled," he said, "and if you should feel afraid&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Afraid&mdash;I," she echoed scornfully. "I shall not be afraid."</p>

  <p>"I do not think you will. Now, remember you have promised. And above all
  things, Lord Bearhaven must know everything."</p>

  <p>"I promise," she answered. "If I could only see Chris&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But you can't do anything of the kind&mdash; for the present, at least.
  You must have perfect faith in me."</p>

  <p>"I have," Vere replied, looking into his glowing eyes. "Had I not
  always?"</p>

  <h3>IV</h3>

  <p class="first">THE HOUR was a little after 2 in the morning; a perfect
  silence, broken at intervals by the roll of some passing carriage, or faint
  echo of distant music, reigned in the streets of Vanity Fair. Vere Dene swept
  down the marble steps, with their coating of crimson cloth, which lay before
  the Marchioness of Hurlingham's residence in Park Lane, her head drawn up,
  the Vere diamonds flashing in the lamplight under her thin gossamer wrap.
  There had been some faint surprise, a little well-bred expostulation at her
  early departure and Lord Bearhaven, standing at the carriage door bare-headed
  and regretful, murmured against the fates. "Your presence is absolutely
  necessary?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Absolutely. You understand everything, and besides, I should be so
  miserably anxious all the time. Goodnight."</p>

  <p>"Good-night, Miss Dene or, rather, let us say <i>au revoir</i>."</p>

  <p>The carriage rolled away into the darkness, carrying with it no delicious
  whirl of thought, no sweet consciousness of a night of triumph. Lord
  Bearhaven threw a coat over his evening dress and hailed an empty cab
  crawling down the street. A moment later, he, too, was hurrying Arlington
  street way.</p>

  <p>There was a fitful gleam of light in some of the windows at No. 281 as the
  carriage drew up and the door opened. A few feet farther on was a hackney
  coach with the outline of a policeman on the box with the cabman, the
  conveyance from Starr and Fortiter's, in which their confidential agent had
  arrived to convey the Vere diamonds to safe custody.</p>

  <p>Under tbe subdued light of the shaded lamps, Vere waited, but for what she
  scarcely knew. The ancient butler, a faithful old servant of Vavasour Dene's,
  came forward with a poor attempt to conceal his agitation. "Some one has been
  inquiring for you, Miss," he said. "I did not know what to do. I had to hide
  him in the library. But&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Who is up, Semmes? Are all the servants in bed?"</p>

  <p>"Every one except myself and Miss Ashton, Miss. Your maid said you left
  orders for her not to wait for you. Mr Winchester has been here some time,
  but where he is now I know no more than&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And the agent from Starr's, where is he?"</p>

  <p>"In the breakfast-room. He has been here half-an-hour."</p>

  <p>Vere's heart was beating fast enough now; a curious choking in her throat
  checked her ready flow of speech for a moment. Then all the dominant courage
  of her nature seemed to come again, strengthening every nerve and limb, till
  she felt almost exulting in her audacity of purpose. She swept up the stairs
  leading to her dressingroom, her face calm and placid, as if she had no
  consciousness of danger, a profusion of soft wax-lights flashing upon the
  living fire of jewels gleaming on her dusky hair and round the full white
  throat. For a moment she stood contemplating her own perfect-loveliness, then
  she removed the glittering jewels from her wrists and throat and bosom and
  placed them one by one in their leathern cases. Taking the cases from the
  table, she walked down the stairs again. At the foot of the stairs stood
  Ashton, a smile of uneasy meaning upon his neat handsome face, a smile of
  uncertainty as to his welcome. They made a strange picture as they stood
  thus, this brother and sister, after a parting nearly five years old, as
  different now as light from darkness, as wide asunder as tbe poles.</p>

  <p>"Come with me," Vere whispered, conscious of the danger of being
  overheard, at the same time leading the way into a small room half-concealed
  behind a bank of gardenias and tube-roses, and where one dim light was
  burning. "You have chosen a strange time for your visit, Chris. You might
  have selected a more appropriate hour." Her eyes wandered over him from head
  to foot, over all the signs of pitiless poverty he bore, till her heart
  melted, and all the pure sisterly love came to the surface.</p>

  <p>"Chris, Chris, what have I done that you should treat me like this? Why do
  you keep away from me as you have done, when all mine is yours, and I would
  have sacrificed it all to help you."</p>

  <p>Ashton turned away his face as if the words had been tbe lashes of a whip;
  even the thickening folds of self-pity which the years of trouble and
  misfortune had wrapped around him were penetrable to one touch of Nature.</p>

  <p>"Do not grudge me the last embers of my manhood," said he with an
  imploring gesture. "Don't make it any harder, Vere."</p>

  <p>"I hate to hear you talk like this," Vere answered, her voice trembling.
  "You, a young man, with all the years before you; time enough to wipe out the
  stain and regain your honorable name."</p>

  <p>"An honorable name for me, with the recollection of the cowardly part I am
  playing at this moment! But cost what it will, I play the hypocrite no
  longer.&mdash;Do you guess what brings me here to- night?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Chris I know only too well what brings you here to-night."</p>

  <p>So utterly surprised was Ashton by the unexpected reply, that he could
  only cling to the back of the chair against which he was standing and regard
  the speaker with starting eyes. That Vere had been taken into Winchester's
  confidence he had not had the smallest conception.</p>

  <p>"Is it possible you can really know? And if you have discovered
  everything, why do you not ring the bell and order your servants to thrust me
  out into the street? What can you gain by keeping tne here?"</p>

  <p>"Much that I want&mdash; much that you need also. Chris, it is folly for
  you and me to stand here wasting bitter words. You came here because there
  was no help for it; you imagine yourself to be deserted. Even now, we are all
  doing our best to save you."</p>

  <p>Ashton laughed mirthlessly. "To save me?" he cried. "And how?"</p>

  <p>"How, another hour will prove. For the present, I am merely an instrument
  in cleverer hands than my own. Only wait and see."</p>

  <p>"Your patience will be tried no longer. &mdash;Vere, are you ready?"</p>

  <p>The suddenness of the interruption caused brother and sister to turn
  uneasily. In the dim light Winchester's tall figure was faintly visible,
  though the lamp shining on his face showed it illuminated by a smile of hope
  and pleasurable expectation. His very presence seemed to give them a fresh
  meed of comfort. Vere would have spoken, only that he laid a finger on her
  lip and pointed silently to the door. For a moment Vere hesitated, as if half
  afraid; but gathering up her,courage, somewhat shaken by the unexpected
  interview, without another word took up the jewel cases and left the room. A
  bright light was burning, in the breakfast room as she entered. There was
  still the consciousness of unseen danger, till beyond, in the darkness of an
  inner apartment, she discerned the outline of Winchester's figure as he came
  in noiselessly by another door. There was only one other person present, a
  tall, slim individual, with a small black moustache, and gleaming eyes, but
  little dimmed by the <i>pince-nez</i> he bore. He bowed, and brightened
  visibly as Vere laid the leathern cases upon the table.</p>

  <p>"You come from Starr and Fortiter's, I presume?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I have the honor to be their confidential clerk, madam," replied the
  agent smoothly. "If you will be good enough to read this letter, you will see
  thatI am what I represent. In such matters we usually take every
  precaution."</p>

  <p>Vere glanced through the letter carelessly, after which, at the clerk's
  direction, she initialled it. With almost suspicious alacrity he took up the
  cases, and with another profound bow, walked towards the door. As he did so,
  Winchester came out of the inner apartment and stopped him with a
  gesture.</p>

  <p>"I hardly think this is quite formal," he said. "Perhaps Miss Dene has no
  objection to my asking a few question? And you, sir, pray, be seated. If Miss
  Dene will do me the favor to retire for a moment&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Vere wanted no second bidding. Already her courage, high as it was, began
  to fail. It had been a trying night, and the sense of danger overpowering.
  Moreover, the evil had not been seen, but rather implied. Without waiting to
  hear more, she left the aparment and stepped across to a little room
  opposite, fearful lest Ashton might in a moment of rashness betray
  himself.</p>

  <p>Directly the last sound of her footsteps had died away, the patent
  politeness of Winchester's manner underwent a change.</p>

  <p>"Now, you scoundrel," he said grimly, "give me those jewels."</p>

  <p>"My good sir, I am quite at a loss to know who you are; but, representing
  as I do one of the first houses in town&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You are at no loss to know who I am," Winchester, returned, approaching
  the agent, and with a dexterous movement, removing wig, moustache, and
  glasses from tbe other's face. "My name is Winchester, and yours is Wingate
  There is not the least occasion to deny the fact."</p>

  <p>Wingate, for, he it was, dropped the cases and staggered into a seat. For
  a moment he measured his antagonist with his eye, and despairingly gave up
  the wild idea of a struggle as at once hopeless and perilous. An instant of
  wild baffled rage was followed by a cold trembling of the limbs. There
  remained only a last effort for freedom to be made, and as the detected thief
  remembered the forged acceptance in his pocket, his spirits rose to the
  encounter. "Perhaps you will be good enough to prove what my name is," he
  answered doggedly.</p>

  <p>"Prove it," Winchester echoed contemptuously; "yes, before a jury, if you
  like. Do Starr ancl Fortiter's agents generally do their business in
  disguise, with a cab waiting for them outside with a pantomine policeman
  alongside the driver The scheme was a very neat one but unfortunately for
  you, I happen to know everything."</p>

  <p>"<i>En après</i>," said Wingate with all the cool insolence at his
  command. "Upon my word, you carry matters with a high hand. Perhaps you
  forget that I hold an open sesame that will allow me to depart whether you
  like it or not."</p>

  <p>"'Pon my word, I am greatly obliged to you for mentioning it," Winchester
  returned. You are naturally alluding to tbe acceptance you stole from my
  studio&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Bearing the forged name of Lord Bearhaven."</p>

  <p>"Bearing the forged name of Lord Bearhaven. Exactly. For that reminder
  also allow me to tender you my most sincere thanks. You are an audacious
  rascal, Mr Wingate, a truism we both appreciate. If that bill was in my
  pocket, you would not feel so easy as you do."</p>

  <p>"Certainly. That, as you are perfectly aware, is my sheet anchor. Come
  what may, you dare not prosecute me and so far as I am concerned, I shall
  walk out of this room as freely as I came in."</p>

  <p>"That is very likely," Winchester returned dryly. "But if I may venture to
  prophesy, not without paying something for your freedom. You may rest assured
  of one thing, that unless that bill is in my posession, your exit will be
  accompanied by an official not altogether unconnected with Scotland
  Yard."</p>

  <p>"You would force it from me?" Wingate cried, tbe first real feeling of
  alarm getting the better of his matchless audacity. "You would never
  dare&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I would dare anything. Can't you see that you are completely in my power?
  However, I do not desire to use force; it would be bad for me, and a great
  deal worse for you. You are counting upon Lord Bearhaven's character for
  severity, and also how. you can be revenged upon Ashton for betraying you.
  Upon my word, when I think of everything, the cool villainy of this plot, now
  I have you in arm's length, I can scarcely refrain from thrashing you within
  an inch of your life and I should do so with the liveliest satisfaction."</p>

  <p>"You will treat me as a gentleman," Wingate faltered, shrinking back with
  blanched lips and chattering teeth. He was completely cowed; but the
  malignant cunning of his nature did not fail him quite yet. "I-I could do a
  lot of harm. If I sent to Lord Bearhaven and said to him&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Should you <i>like</i> to see him?" Winchester asked abruptly.</p>

  <p>Wingate's dark eyes- blazed with the intensity of impotent malice.</p>

  <p>"Like to see him!" he cried. I would give anything, five years of my life,
  if I could, for the opportunity of 10 minutes' conversation at this
  moment."</p>

  <p>Winchester touched the little silver bell on the table. "I am delighted to
  be in a position to accommodate you," he replied cheerfully, as Semmes
  entered. "Will you be kind enough to ask Lord Bearhaven to step this
  way."</p>

  <p>A moment later, Bearhaven entered, calm, cool, and slightly contemptuous
  in his immaculate evening dress, and looking down from his superior height
  upon the thoroughly bewildered Wingate, while Winchester, content to leave
  the matter in such competent hands, discreetly vanished.</p>

  <p>"You wished to speak to me," said the newcomer after a long pause. "I
  would advise you to be brief in your confidence, Mr Wingate."</p>

  <p>"Captain Wingate, if you have no objection," responded the discomfited
  rascal, with a fair assumption of ease. "Let us preserve the ordinary
  courtesies."</p>

  <p>"Pooh, my good fellow, a jury would not recognise so fine a distinction. I
  am sorry to disappoint you of your promised treat, but everything is known to
  me. Your confederate Chivers&mdash; Benjamin Chivers, to be correct&mdash;
  has disclosed everything. We know how you ingratiated yourself into the good
  graces of Starr and Fortiter's agent, how you stole his credentials from him,
  and where he lies drugged at this moment. What you are most desirous of
  mentioning is that forged bill bearing my signature. Will you be surprised to
  hear that I knew all about that three years ago?"</p>

  <p>"But if I liked" to disclose the facts, my lord," broke in Wingate, now
  thoroughly alarmed, "if I am presssd to do so&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You dare not," Lord Bearhaven sternly replied. "I am not going to argue
  with you one way or another. Let me bring myself down to your level. Try it
  and I will be prepared to acknowledge the signature, and Mr Winchester will
  be prepared to swear you stole the bill from his studio. And I think,"
  concluded the speaker, with stinging contempt, "I think you will be a long
  while in persuading a jury to give credence to your story. Lord Bearhaven's
  testimony, I presume, will go further than that of a well-known sharper and
  blackleg."</p>

  <p>Wingate's head fell lower and lower, till his face rested on his hands.
  The struggle, long and severe, had been too much for even his temerity. "I am
  quite in your power," he said. "I think, I hope you will not be hard upon me.
  Tell me what I must do, and it shall be done."</p>

  <p>"The acceptance you have at this moment in your possession&mdash; nay, do
  not prevaricate; it is your last chance so you may expect little mercy from
  me. Place it in my hands and trust to my discretion."</p>

  <p>"And supposing I agree&mdash; what then? I will make terms&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You will do nothing of the kind; it is I who will make terms. Hand it
  over without another word and you leave here a free man. I say no more."</p>

  <p>Slowly, grudgingly, Wingate drew from his breast-pocket a worn leather
  case, and taking therefrom a narrow slip of paper, handed it to Lord
  Bearhaven, as if it had been some precious treasure at which his soul
  recoiled from parting with. After a hasty glance at its contents, Lord
  Bearhaven held it over the flame of a lamp till nothing but a few blackened
  ashes remained in his fingers.</p>

  <p>"Now you may go," he said, with a motion towards the door. "Allow me to
  see you safely off the premises. Your cab is still at the door, I think. You
  must make your own peace with the cabman and the artificial policeman."</p>

  <p>Winchester was standing in the hall somewhat impatiently waiting for the
  termination of the interview. One glance at the detected scoundrel's face was
  sufficient evidence of the successful issue. As Wingate disappeared in the
  darkness, Bearhaven turned to the artist and held out his hand. "I think we
  can congratulate ourselves," he said. "The paper we spoke of no longer
  exists. And now I will retire, if you have no objection. Miss Dene will, not
  care to see me again to-night, especially as&mdash;you understand&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Winchester nodded; it would have been impossible to express his feelings
  in words. Once alone, he ran lightly upstairs to the drawing-room, where
  Chris and Vere together with Miss Ashton were awaiting him. As he entered,
  the light was falling full upon Vere's face, from which all the pride and
  haughtiness had gone, leaving it soft and tearful. There was a tremor of her
  limbs, her lips worked unsteadily as she tried to smile, in return for his
  bright face. For a moment all were silent, Ashton watching them without
  daring to speak.</p>

  <p>"It is done," he said gently, noting the dumb piteous appeal in Ashton's
  eyes. "Thank Heaven, you are free at last."</p>

  <p>There was another silence, at the end of which he told them all. Miss
  Ashton, weeping quietly, hung on every word with breathless admiration. To
  Winchester she firmly believed there was nothing impossible; this favorite
  erring nephew had always been the delight and terror of her simple life. Now
  the tale was told, the play was ended. With a passionate sigh, Winchester
  turned to go.</p>

  <p>"This Is no longer any place for us," he said. "Chris, are you coming with
  me?"</p>

  <p>"You will dp nothing of the kind!" cried Miss Ashton, firm for the only
  time in her amiable existence. "I will give Semmes orders to lock every door
  and bring me the keys. Jack, you ought to be ashamed of yourself."</p>

  <p>Winchester sighed again wistfully as Aunt Lucy bustled out of the room. He
  held out his hand to Vere, but she could not, or would not, see. At the door
  he lingered for a moment with a backward glance; and Vere, looking up at
  length, their eyes met, each telling their own tale in the same mute
  language. He was at her side in a moment. "What dare I say?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"What dare you say? Rather, what dare you not say? What did you promise
  years ago, and how have you fulfilled that promise? Do you think that I
  forget so easily; that, because riches and prosperity have come to me&mdash;
  Oh can't you see?&mdash;Can't you say something I may not?"</p>

  <p>"Is it that you care for me, darling that you still love <i>me</i>?"</p>

  <p>"I am weak and foolish but I cannot help it, Jack," Vere cried with her
  face aflame, "Oh, how blind you have been, and how unhappy I! Of course it
  is. What will people say? What do I care what people say, when I am the
  happiest girl in England. But, Jack, there is one thing 1 would not have them
  say, that I had actually to ask a man to&mdash; to marry <i>me</i>."</p>

  <p>There was a great glow of happiness upon Winchester's face, reflected in a
  measure on Ashton's pallid cheek. For a few moments he dared not trust
  himself to utter the words trembling on his lips.</p>

  <p>"You always had my love," he said presently. "Fate has been very good to
  me in spite of myself. My darling, if you are willing to brave the world, you
  shall never regret it so long as God gives me health and strength to shield
  you. Chris, have you nothing to say?"</p>

  <p>"Only that you may be as happy as you deserve to be. And what you have
  done for me to-night, with God's help, you shall be repaid for, all the days
  of your life.&mdash;And <i>now</i>, Vere may perhaps be persuaded to let us
  go."</p>

  <p>"I will," she whispered, "for I know you will come again to-morrow.
  To-morrow&mdash;rather to-day for, see, the sun has risen, and
  daylight</p><br>

  <h3>Published in <i>Reynolds's Newspaper</i>, London, 9 &amp; 16 Oct
  1892</h3>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p class="first">A GREAT DEAL of human misery is, unhappily, attributable to
  a lack of that worldly dross which everyone tells us is vain and empty, but
  which, nevertheless, everyone is extremely anxious to possess. There are
  various degrees of poverty, from the absolute want of a meal, to an
  occasional inability to meet an adverse balance at one's bankers; but the
  fine line between comfort and poverty is perilously close when it comes to
  parting with articles of 'bigotry and virtue,' such as personal ornaments,
  and the like.</p>

  <p>This uncomfortable truth had thrust itself unpleasantly upon pretty Mrs.
  Brassey more than once lately, though, to the casual observer, appearances
  did not denote such a desperate state of affairs. Dalebrook Lodge,
  Chislehurst, was prosperous looking enough, a 'cottage of gentility,'
  standing in its own neatly kept grounds. No element of refinement was
  lacking, and the fair chatelaine's graceful figure was clad in a costume
  bearing the unmistakable stamp of Redfern's handiwork.</p>

  <p>"I cannot understand it at all," she said, innocently, as she turned a
  pair of liquid blue eyes upon her consort, who stood in the typical British
  attitude before the blazing logs, pulling his moustache for inspiration. "I
  had no idea we were short of money, Reg."</p>

  <p>"Nor I, dearest," Reg replied, ruefully. "When my father died twelve
  months ago, just after we were married, he led me to understand that he was
  in comfortable circumstances. It was a near shave, you mind, but a lucky coup
  on the Stock Exchange pulled back all he lost, and enabled him to pay old
  Bartley the money borrowed from him on security of the Battiscombe property.
  That is worth £2,000 a year, and at that figure I naturally estimated my
  income. Of course, Bartley being left executor, and matters being a little
  complicated, I have not asked for any money, till this affair of poor Jack's
  turned up. You can imagine my surprise when, on asking for the last year's
  rents, I was informed that the £30,000 was never repaid to Bartley, and that
  no release was ever executed by him, as I have been informed it was."</p>

  <p>A puzzled frown settled down upon the young wife's fair face. The
  explanation was caviare to her to a certain extent, but she understood
  sufficient to grasp the fact that Septimus Bartley, whose word was worth
  something on 'Change, flatly denied receiving the money borrowed by
  Reginald's father, and that the release of the Battiscombe property was
  merely the chimera of an old man's imagination.</p>

  <p>"What does it all mean?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Unless I can prove that the document in question exists, it means that we
  are paupers," Reg replied, ruefully. "As executor, Bartley took possession of
  the papers when my father died, and naturally the mortgage to him is with the
  Battiscombe deeds. It would be easy enough for him to destroy the release and
  preserve the mortgage."</p>

  <p>"Are you certain that this release, as you call it, really existed."</p>

  <p>"My dear girl, I have had it in my hand. I never read a legal document,
  'for that way madness lies,' but I am prepared to stake my existence on the
  fact that such a document does or did exist, despite Bartley's denial. It
  looks uncommonly like an attempt at robbery."</p>

  <p>The conference paused and they regarded one another dismally. It seemed as
  if a bolt from the blue had fallen, burying in its descent all the happiness
  and comfort of that model little household. The bank people had heard
  something of the matter, as more than one local tradesman holding cheques
  marked with the mysterious legend 'N.C.' angrily testified. Nellie Brassy
  looked round her dainty drawing-room, at once the pride and plague of young
  matronhood, with a sigh of dismay. There were those pair of vases which
  Reggie had given her on her last birthday, the placing of which had caused so
  much anxious time and thought, still waiting a selection for a final resting
  place. There were other contemplated improvements, but now the very thought
  brought tears into the bright eyes. It was too hard.</p>

  <p>"We might just as well face the inevitable," Reg observed, the orthodox
  consolation being duly administered. "It will be bad enough when it comes,
  meanwhile it is imperative that we should have some ready money. There is
  some advantage after all in possessing some good jewellery, and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Reggie," Nell cried, stopping her pink ears, "don't be horrid."</p>

  <p>"That's what it must come to," Brassey replied, in what was intended for a
  matter-of-fact tone. "It doesn't matter much what you call it. A temporary
  loan on personal property is quite a common thing now-a-days."</p>

  <p>"What does Kitty say about it?"</p>

  <p>"I haven't told her. Let her enjoy herself while the sun shines."</p>

  <p>"You had better tell me now, for in any case I am certain to find out,"
  said a fresh, clear voice, as the speaker came in unobserved. "Is the
  drawing-room clock broken or has the Bank of England stopped payment? You
  look as grave as if you had the cares of Europe on your shoulders."</p>

  <p>Kitty Brassey looked from one to the other, with a gleam of mischief in
  her dark eyes. A small, vivacious looking girl, wilful, and somewhat
  headstrong; a generous heart and strong determination of purpose underlay the
  pleasing, but withal frivolous exterior.</p>

  <p>But Miss Kitty's face was grave enough as she returned to the garden, when
  at the end of a quarter of an hour she repaired to her favourite seat at the
  more secluded end of the garden. She felt no dismay. Her heart was too hot
  and angry for that. Her father had shared most of his secrets with his only
  daughter, before Reggie had sold out of the service on his marriage, and she
  alone knew how great the danger to the honourable house of Bainbridge,
  Brassey, and Co. had once been. She was perfectly well aware how the danger
  had been tided over, and that her elderly, admirer, Septimus Bartley, had
  been paid to the full.</p>

  <p>Mr. Bartley's business relationship with his own firm consisted of an
  occasional visit to town, though he had direct telephonic communication with
  the Gresham-street establishment, of which he availed himself whilst enjoying
  his dolce far niente at Chislehurst.</p>

  <p>She remembered, too, how disappointed the elderly Adonis had been when Mr.
  Brassey's last and most desperate speculation had freed him from the clutches
  of his quondam friend. And yet, strangely enough, the reputable stockbroker
  proved to be Brassey's executor, and that the said executor was playing a
  game of duplicity, Miss Kitty did not for a moment doubt.</p>

  <p>"What a shame it is!" she said, aloud. "I had a great mind go and have it
  out with him myself."</p>

  <p>She smiled at her own vehemence, and half rose from her recumbent position
  as the sound of footsteps disturbed her meditations. The new comer was a
  young man, under, rather than over, the average height; an exceedingly
  good-looking fellow, dressed in the most immaculate style, and wearing the
  now almost obsolete glass in his eye, as if it had taken root and grown
  there.</p>

  <p>"I am so glad to see you!" Kitty exclaimed. "Sit down and let us
  talk."</p>

  <p>"It is mutual," said the new comer, with almost provoking deliberation, as
  he hooked a chair with his cane, and sat down with the air of a man in the
  last stages of exhaustion. "I have been up to the Lodge, and heard that
  melancholy has marked you for her own. I immediately guessed the reason. I
  have not been stranded so often in my hot youth upon the bleak and desert
  shores of impecuniosity for nothing; and the cruel tale was unfolded."</p>

  <p>Charles Daintree did not add, as he might have done, that he had placed
  his assistance and cheque-book, figuratively at the feet of his friend
  Brassey.</p>

  <p>"Then you know everything?" Kitty asked.</p>

  <p>"As far as recent developments go, yes. I was never so surprised in my
  life!"</p>

  <p>"You don't say so!" Kitty exclaimed, with flattering interest. "I wish I
  had been there. Portrait of Mr. Charles Daintree as he appeared when
  surprised. It must have almost repaid Reg for all his anxiety."</p>

  <p>"I was surprised," Daintree returned, imperturbably; "and again, I was
  not. For some occult reason my late uncle insisted that for three years I
  should occupy a seat in his City office. The event created no sensation in
  London&mdash;in fact, I allowed matters to take their own course. But one
  could not keep altogether free from City jargon, and I remained there quite
  long enough to make a tolerably fair estimate of the virtues of the estimable
  Bartley."</p>

  <p>Kitty nodded approval. Much as she enjoyed the luxury of contradicting her
  companion upon most occasions, the point at issue was one upon which she felt
  in perfect accord with Daintree.</p>

  <p>"Have you thought of anything?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Nothing, save that my mind has turned feebly once or twice in the
  direction of governessing. It will be hard at first. I shall have a harsh,
  arbitrary employer, who has a number of marriageable daughters, all plain,
  who envy the superior charms of&mdash;in short&mdash;me. Then the hero will
  come upon the scene, and, after a few tribulations, all will end
  happily."</p>

  <p>"There is a certain element of risk attending such enterprises," Daintree
  observed, tranquilly. "I can show you a much better plan."</p>

  <p>"I wish you would," Kitty laughed. "The governess scheme ends my
  resources."</p>

  <p>"Why not marry me and thus reach the denouement at once?"</p>

  <p>"What an end to my cherished romance," Kitty answered, with a faint tinge
  of pink flushing her cheeks. "I never had a lover! but I am under the
  impression that upon such occasions&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Fiction," Daintree put in calmly, but more earnestly than usual. "Yes; I
  know all you are going to say. Nevertheless, I was never more serious in my
  life. I am not a good hand at making impassioned speeches and all that kind
  of thing; but I do love you honestly and truly, and I would do my best to
  make you a good husband and you a happy wife."</p>

  <p>All the mischievous sparkle died out of Kitty's eyes, as she glanced up at
  the speaker's calm, but none the less determined face. She had half-expected
  this, but hitherto the suggestion had always struck her as being somewhat
  ludicrous. Now, however, there was something comforting, almost happiness in
  the idea, as she replied with tender seriousness.</p>

  <p>"I think you mean it," she said; "and I&mdash;I do not know what to say.
  It seems almost selfish of us to be talking in this strain now, while Nell
  and Reggie are so unhappy. Oh, dear, if we were only people in a book, you
  would hit upon some clever scheme for recovering that horrid release,
  and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"We should all live happy ever afterwards. Were you going to say
  that?"</p>

  <p>"Something very like it," Kitty blushingly admitted. "But it is all
  nonsense."</p>

  <p>"And supposing I told you that I have a clever scheme to recover the
  missing parchment&mdash;what then?"</p>

  <p>"But you couldn't," Kitty answered, strategically. "The fated paper is
  concealed with others in Mr. Bartley's safe, not more than a mile from where
  we are at this moment. Only think of that, only think that, given a little
  bit of steel, you or I could walk up to Mr. Bartley's house some day when he
  was away, and in less than five minutes virtue would be triumphant and vice
  defeated. The thought is maddening!"</p>

  <p>"Then don't think of it," Daintree replied, soothingly. "However, we are
  wandering from the point. Kitty, be serious a moment. If I can recover that
  paper for Reg, will you be my wife?"</p>

  <p>"I think I would without that," Kitty murmured, without attempting to
  withdraw the fingers he had imprisoned. "But since you have thrown down a
  challenge, I will accept it, Charlie. Suppose I give you a formal answer when
  you bring me that dingy sheet of parchment?"</p>

  <p>Daintree raised the white finger-tips to his lips, and kissed them
  gallantly. There was a bright light of inspiration in his eyes, a light which
  seemed to warm Kitty's heart and fill her with trust and confidence. Had she
  known it, the great battalions of chance were fighting upon her side and on
  behalf of those she loved. Kitty was a bright, lovable little soul, and was
  strictly loyal to her friends; her happiness would not have been complete had
  not they been in a position to share it. Charlie Daintree was a gentleman,
  and, what is more in worldly eyes, a rich man; but Kitty seemed to have
  forgotten this in her eagerness for her brother and his wife, and Daintree,
  whose eyeglass saw most things, felt himself drawn nearer to her for this
  self-abnegation.</p>

  <p>"It is a challenge," he said. "If I do not bring you the precious document
  within a week, my head be the forfeit. But you were wrong as to the tiny tube
  of steel which is supposed to be like a barrier between our united happiness.
  Now, I happen to know that, since the burglary at Charleston Hall, our friend
  Bartley has had a very elaborate new safe constructed, one with a time lock,
  which opens itself at any hour to which it is set by the owner. It is the
  most ingenious of the recent American inventions, and the designer boasts
  that it is absolutely thief-proof. And yet I have an idea I know an 'open
  sesame,' even for that stronghold."</p>

  <p>"You are not going to do anything rash?" Kitty cried, in alarm.</p>

  <p>"Now, did I ever do anything rash?" Daintree asked. "I did contemplate
  such an act some time back; but fate kindly guided my steps into the lodge
  gates on my way to town, since when my project has been abandoned. My bounden
  duty is to punish two rascals; but I prefer to let them down easily, and use
  them as my instruments to confound a third."</p>

  <p>Daintree's mind was extremely active as he sauntered leisurely home,
  leaving the lady of his choice to construe the above sphinx-like remark as
  best she might. Apparently utterly indifferent to the world at large, he
  strolled along the broad avenue leading up to Bolitree, which envied spot
  constituted his home for the time being, when not engaged upon more distant
  pleasures. It was a fine old house, one of the best and noblest in the
  neighbourhood, and as yet secluded from the advent of the speculative
  builder, who has laboured so hard to ruin the picturesqueness of suburban
  London.</p>

  <p>He walked through a spacious hall and into a noble dining-room, wherein,
  as in the rest of the house, the evidences of wealth and lavish taste were
  discernible to the most indifferent eye. The late owner, a childless City
  man, with proverbially enough money to set the Leaning Tower of Pisa
  straight, had spared nothing to gratify his mania for art and kindred
  treasures; indeed, many of these were displayed with a carelessness
  sufficient to tempt the honesty of those in whose charge they were usually
  placed.</p>

  <p>Daintree ate his solitary dinner, waited upon by a solemn butler of
  stately mien&mdash;quite a prize in the way of a butler, he was wont to say,
  when complimented upon the latest addition to the Bolitree menage, and one
  who, under happier auspices, would certainly have graced a bishopric.</p>

  <p>"You will kindly take the claret and cigarette-box into the smoke-room,"
  Charles commanded, at length. "I shall not go out again this evening; and,
  Brace, see that all the doors are fastened early."</p>

  <p>"It shall be done as usual, sir," replied the solemn functionary. "One
  cannot be too careful with so many suspicious characters about, sir."</p>

  <p>When the immaculate guardian of his employer's property repaired presently
  to the smoke-room, he found his master already there. Daintree lay back in
  his chair, a cigarette between his teeth, and his eyeglass gleaming on Brace,
  who seemed almost uncomfortable under the keen scrutiny.</p>

  <p>"You were saying just now," he commenced, "that there are several
  suspicious characters about. Always look out for suspicious characters,
  Brace. I do."</p>

  <p>The butler coughed in deferential acknowledgment of his master's
  wisdom.</p>

  <p>"Always do that, Brace; for, really, you never know who you are dealing
  with. Now, for all you have been with me over twelve months&mdash;for all you
  have been with me that time, to say nothing of your excellent
  references&mdash;you might be a burglar's confederate in disguise; I mean,
  the old dishonest servant who plans the robbery for others to execute. I
  daresay that this strikes you as being a very comical idea, Brace?"</p>

  <p>"If it pleases you to think so," said Brace, uncomfortably.</p>

  <p>"Well, it does," Daintree replied, contemplating the irreproachable
  servant with grim irony. "Such things frequently happen. Now, supposing you
  were similarly tempted. You sleep with William in the butler's pantry, and
  the first thing is to get him out of the way&mdash;by the way, I understand
  William is away just now&mdash;and the rest of the servants being in the west
  wing, makes your task easier. You look offended, Brace, thinking of your
  references. But you might have forged a testimonial from your previous
  employer, Lord Kennington, knowing that his lordship and myself were not
  likely to meet&mdash;by the way, I was introduced to him yesterday morning,
  Brace&mdash;and as for the dogs, they are easily settled. And really, Brace,
  it is a strange, very strange, coincidence that both the mastiffs should have
  to be sent to the veterinary surgeon's this morning."</p>

  <p>With a sense of exquisite enjoyment, Daintree watched the gradual change
  passing over the countenance of his peerless servant. Anxiety, fear, and
  terror chased one another rapidly, till at length the immaculate solemnity
  collapsed to a flabby and absolute fright.</p>

  <p>"We merely suppose all this, Brace, and, to continue, we suppose a
  fast-running dogcart with Savernake wheels, and a blood mare shod with those
  now patent india-rubber horseshoes, to be waiting tonight, or, say, to-morrow
  night, at the Mother Goose, in the City-road, ready to run down here and back
  between midnight and daybreak. You see how easily it is done, Brace."</p>

  <p>Brace nodded; he could not have spoken to have saved his life.</p>

  <p>"We will carry our romance a little further. The man in the cart drives up
  the avenue, the gates being left open&mdash;by the way, they were unlocked,
  and someone has been oiling them lately, Brace&mdash;and you let him in. By
  you, of course, I mean an individual called, in the select profession to
  which the new-comer belongs, Solemn James. Did you ever know a man called
  Solemn James, Brace, a burglar's confederate, who by means of forged
  testimonials finds his way into&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Brace collapsed, and fell on his knees with a dismal cry. Daintree rose
  and approached him, speaking more sternly than the prostrate thief ever heard
  his easy-going employer speak before.</p>

  <p>"I am going to give you a chance," he said. "Listen to me."</p>

  <p>Brace did listen, as a criminal follows the evidence at his own trial. At
  the end of a quarter of an hour he left the smoking-room, white and cold, but
  with a sensation something like gratitude agitating that portion of his
  anatomy where the heart is supposed to be.</p>

  <p>"You know the alternative," Charlie said, curtly. "Penal servitude or
  strict obedience."</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p class="first">BURGLARY, like stockbroking, and such hazardous professions,
  is occasionally of a very precarious nature, add to which members of the body
  are prone to be lavish in moments of affluence, which moments, a member of
  the profession tells me, occur much less frequently than they used to do. In
  the good old days&mdash;i.e., before the advent of photography and mounted
  police&mdash;the same authority tells me, that in the exercise of his
  profession he has frequently plundered the house when the inmates were
  perfectly aware of his presence, and he was equally alive to the fact that
  they dared not raise an alarm.</p>

  <p>But if organization and science is fast killing the old school of
  burglary, the modern branch is quite equal to the advancement of thief-proof
  inventions and detective skill. Mr. William Jarvis, for instance, could, if
  his native modesty permitted, make such a display of rachet drills, plate
  cutters, braces, and bits as would put the finest efforts of Sheffield to the
  blush. The police have yet to discover where the majority of these perfect
  little instruments are manufactured, though William Jarvis, of 75,
  Pitt-street, City-road, would probably have refused to supply the
  information. These were only used on special occasions, such as when a
  collection of the aristocracy of crime clubbed forces and took a country
  house, or a jeweller's warehouse was marked down for plunder, for James was a
  shining light who kept his own horse and trap, and frequented Epping Forest
  with his wife and family on Sundays. He it was who collected the property (of
  others) in the still watches of the night, his confederate arranging date and
  time of collection, after which Jarvis visited the 'fences,' and divided the
  proceeds with the strictest integrity, for, strange as it may seem, he was an
  honest man, and his word was good for anything in certain circles. Members of
  other professions one could name possess equally irregular natures.</p>

  <p>The burglar is popularly supposed to be a thickset, bulldog-looking
  individual, who inclines to fur caps and belcher handkerchiefs, unlimited
  beer, and florid conversation. As a matter of fact, Jarvis was nothing of the
  kind. He was a slim, wiry man, approaching forty, with keen, dark eyes, and a
  resolute-looking mouth. He did not drink, as alcohol is apt to interfere with
  a profession above all calling for steady nerve, and he eschewed smoking, as,
  in his own words, a surreptitious pipe has often been the means of getting 'a
  pore bloke into trouble.' He had a tidy wife, to whom he was kind and
  affectionate, a home scrupulously clean and neat, and there were no children
  in the district better clad or cared for than those of William Jarvis.</p>

  <p>On the evening following the little episode between Charles Daintree and
  his butler, Jarvis was seated at supper, a meal of cold roast beef and
  pickles, to which, with one modest glass of beer, he was doing ample justice.
  A bright lamp lighted up a cheery apartment; the burglar's wife sat smiling
  opposite him over her work of darning stockings, while a huge great-coat and
  muffler were airing before the fire, warm as the evening was. Mr. Jarvis was
  more than usually amiable, as a man generally is who, after an enforced spell
  of idleness, returns to a congenial occupation.</p>

  <p>"You have everything you want, William?" asked the thoughtful wife. "Just
  one more glass of the beer before your long drive."</p>

  <p>"Not for me, lass," William replied, drawing on his coat and gloves. "Beer
  and business never mix, which is my motto, and allus will be. You make up the
  fire and fill the kettle, so as I can get a bit of breakfast when I comes
  home; I'm sure to be back before five."</p>

  <p>With this parting injunction, Jarvis stepped out into the dark and
  moonless night, and made his way into the City-road. It was nearly twelve,
  and the streets were thinning rapidly. A little way along he plunged into a
  deep court smelling strongly of the stable and, in a short space of time,
  returned leading a horse attached to a dogcart, the animal's hoofs clattering
  over the stones, whilst the wheels followed noiselessly behind. The patent
  horseshoes were not for the town&mdash;Jarvis was far too astute for
  that&mdash;they being reserved for the approach to Bolitree, which, as the
  reader has guessed, was Jarvis's destination, and the Bolitree plate the end
  in view.</p>

  <p>The gleaming lamps flashed along out into the open country turning now to
  the right and again to the left, for, like Sam Weller's knowledge of London,
  Jarvis's acquaintance with the suburbs was extreme and peculiar. The monument
  on Chislehurst Common being passed, the driver drew a deep breath, and softy
  descended at the lodge gates where the patent shoes were attached, and the
  well-oiled gates being opened, led his steed inside, and having closed the
  (to him) friendly portals, drove rapidly towards Bolitree with all the nerve
  and self-possession of an invited guest.</p>

  <p>He paused a moment on the broad gravel drive to tether his horse and throw
  a rug over her, for the merciful man is merciful to his beast; but this did
  not deter him from feeling in his pistol pocket for the one weapon without
  which no burglar's outfit is complete. He had never drawn his 'iron'
  hitherto, but was quite prepared to do so if necessary.</p>

  <p>He walked along the facade and round the domestic offices with the assured
  step of a man who knows his ground perfectly; as, indeed, considering the
  robbery in contemplation had effectually ripened for twelve months, he
  should. Trying a shutter gently, it yielded, as he expected, to his touch,
  and a minute later he was in the house. He listened with every nerve strained
  to its highest tension, but no sound came; whereupon he lighted his lantern
  and crept through the stone-flagged corridors to the front of the house.</p>

  <p>"That's all right," he said, sotto voce. "Let me see: third door to the
  right, next to the statue of Mercury." The light flashed for a moment on a
  still white statue, that appeared almost lifelike in the gleam. "This seems
  to be my gentleman. Mercury was the cove what took messengers to the gods, so
  I read somewhere. Well, Mr. Mercury, you'd better run upstairs and tell your
  master as a gent is a going to take away some of his valuables to get 'em
  cleaned. I wonder where Solemn James is? Pretendin' to be asleep most like.
  Cautious blade is Jim, but he might ha' given me a hand, and saved me two
  journeys."</p>

  <p>With the same noiseless, catlike step he crept into the dining-room, where
  he flashed his lamp round, and as the concentrated rays fell upon the huge
  oak sideboard, he gave a gasp of wonder and delight.</p>

  <p>All the most valuable treasures in the house had apparently been gathered
  together there. There was a dazzling flash of silver and gold plate, jewelled
  tazzas, rare ornaments, almost a king's ransom, enough to fill his cart, and,
  more important still to a practical mind, enough to render him independent of
  work for many a month to come.</p>

  <p>"Well!" he exclaimed, quite naturally and aloud, "I've pulled off a few
  good things in my time, but never anything to touch this. Two journeys! I
  shall have to make three. I never did believe in partnership jobs, but, for
  the first time in my professional career, strike me blind, if I don't regret
  as I didn't bring a pal."</p>

  <p>"Can I be of any assistance?"</p>

  <p>The words, slowly, calmly uttered, and coming apparently from space,
  struck the marauder with something like awe. It was not fear&mdash;he had
  never known that feeling&mdash;but the sensation was equally unpleasant.</p>

  <p>"That's funny," he muttered. "I could have sworn I heard a voice. Come out
  there, my man, or I'll shoot."</p>

  <p>Scarcely had he uttered the words when the room was instantly filled with
  what Jarvis feared more than all the policemen in London&mdash;a dazzling,
  blazing, searching light. Electricity he had only known in town, he never
  expected to encounter such an enemy here. And in the centre of the room was
  the lonely figure of a young man lounging back in an arm-chair, a solitary
  diamond flashing on the bosom of his dress shirt, and who was regarding his
  visitor calmly through his eyeglass.</p>

  <p>"I have been expecting you," said Daintree; "take a chair. No? You need
  not put your hand behind you, because I have the advantage, and before you
  can get out your weapon I can kill you. Now, turn your back to me, place your
  hand in your pocket, and throw your revolver towards me. Thank you."</p>

  <p>Jarvis obeyed reluctantly enough, but there was something in the cool,
  ringing tones, a vibration of calm, contemptuous mastery absolutely
  resistible.</p>

  <p>"What are you going to do with me?" he asked, sullenly.</p>

  <p>"That, my friend, altogether depends upon circumstances. I ought to hand
  you and Brace over to the police, but that point we will defer for a future
  occasion. What is you name?"</p>

  <p>"Find out," Jarvis retorted. "I wish I had that Brace here."</p>

  <p>"I wish you had, the interview would be exciting. But you may disabuse
  your mind of the idea that he has betrayed you. As a matter of fact, your
  pal, I think you call it, has shown towards you a faith which does honour to
  his early training. I am to blame for this little interruption, for which
  accept my sincere apologies. And now, sit down."</p>

  <p>Jarvis took the indicated seat, though sorely against his will. There was
  nothing to prevent him flying at the cool, insolent-looking face opposite
  him; but the very coolness of it seemed to freeze his headlong courage.</p>

  <p>"You will help yourself to wine. No? Well, perhaps you are wise not to
  drink; but I can recommend those cigars. An interesting conversation is
  always much more enjoyable over cigars, and I am sure it will be an
  interesting conversation, which is very complimentary to you, Mr. Jarvis,
  considering the lateness of the hour, and the fact that you are an uninvited
  guest."</p>

  <p>Jarvis pulled at his cigar uncomfortably. Afterwards he described that
  evening as one of the most uneasy in his life. There he was, completely at
  the mercy of his attentive host, though the house was quiet as death. But
  Jarvis was a thoughtful man; and, for all he knew, there might have been a
  score of constables concealed behind the heavy plush curtains.</p>

  <p>"You are a burglar by profession, I believe?" Daintree asked, with polite
  interest.</p>

  <p>"Amongst the best of 'em," answered Jarvis, with professional pride. "Go
  on, sir."</p>

  <p>"Certainly. I am going to ask you a few questions. For the nonce you shall
  be the teacher, and I will assume the role of a pupil. In the first place, is
  there such a thing as a burglar-proof house?"</p>

  <p>The listener shifted uneasily, and little beads of perspiration gathered
  on his forehead.</p>

  <p>Steeled as he was against surprises, there was something in the cold chill
  tones of the immaculately-dressed questioner that seemed to deprive him of
  all his boasted courage.</p>

  <p>"Look here, sir," he said, with a last desperate effort. "Give me your
  word as you don't mean no harm to me, and I'll tell you all you wants to
  know. A cove ain't made of iron to be stared at and cross-questioned, and him
  never knowing all the time what's going to happen to him arter all. Is it to
  be the fair thing between one man and another?"</p>

  <p>"So far as I am concerned, it is," Daintree replied. "You need fear no
  treachery. With the solitary exception of ourselves, a footman, and our
  mutual friend here, whom I took the precaution of locking in his room, there
  is probably not a soul awake in the house at the moment."</p>

  <p>Jarvis breathed more freely. He was about to be 'discharged with a
  caution,' after all&mdash;a decision with which he was tolerably
  familiar.</p>

  <p>"Very well, then," Daintree continued; "and, having satisfied you that
  your valuable person is in no jeopardy from the strong arm of the law, I will
  trouble you for a few particulars as to your calling. Now about the
  house."</p>

  <p>"There ain't no house ever made as 'ud keep me out," the burglar replied.
  "Stands to reason that anything you can get out of you can get into. Houses,
  safes. Take safes, now. As fast as ever they make new ones, we find out ways
  to open them. And why? Because we can afford to pay the best workmen such
  rates as the employers can't or won't. Suppose I need a drill warranted to
  cut the best plate ever tempered, I can get it. And who from? Why, the best
  workmen in the trade. He ain't supposed to know me or what I want it for so
  long as he gets his price. That's for safes."</p>

  <p>"You seem to speak from experience," Daintree observed carelessly.</p>

  <p>"Well, you are right about there, guv'nor," Jarvis said with modest pride.
  "One down, t'other come to take the old 'knob' safe, where the keyhole was
  found in one of the knobs, the safe being covered in knobs. Did we look for
  the knob? Not much. All there was to do was to drill a hole through the door,
  and fill it with powder. Not much noise? No; but it has tumbled in like a
  house of cards."</p>

  <p>"But that is a very old-fashioned kind of safe."</p>

  <p>"Not so old-fashioned as you'd think for," Jarvis stated. "The next one
  was goin' to be a puzzler; bolts in the door to be sprung into the framework
  on locking by a spindle connected with a T handle on the door. Yes, that was
  a werry clever contrivance; we knock off the handle with a hammer, soften the
  plate with a lamp and blowpipe, and, after drilling it, put in powder, and
  carry away the whole framework, was cleverer."</p>

  <p>"Designed to hurt the feelings of the inventor," Daintree put in,
  quietly.</p>

  <p>"Well, yes," laughed Jarvis, quite at his ease now. "The next dodge was to
  make a safe of alternate layers of boiler-plate and drill-proof steel. They
  thought they had us there. Ah, ah! One of our workmen invented a plate-cutter
  that went through the boiler plate like through rotten cheese; then we broke
  the chilled steel easily enough."</p>

  <p>"And after that? Surely there are more safes yet?"</p>

  <p>"They beat our plate cutter," Jarvis continued; "but we had an easier job
  than ever, after that. What do you think of filling up all the cracks with
  putty, except about two inches at the top, so as to insert a tube and exhaust
  the air, when by removing a little putty at the bottom, he could drive in
  enough powder for our purpose. Then the door had to give way, being weakest.
  Lor, bless you, sir, safes are child's play to a man as knows his work."</p>

  <p>Charlie toyed with his cigarette a moment before he resumed his
  questioning. He was coming to the point but scarcely knew how to approach his
  man without creating a suspicion of his real design in his mind.</p>

  <p>"There is one kind you seem to have forgotten," he said slowly, seeing
  that Jarvis had turned to him inquiringly; "I allude to the comparatively new
  time safes. You know what I mean&mdash;a lock invented to automatically open
  the doors at a certain time, according to the fancy of the owner. For
  instance, I have a safe here now which I close at three, previously putting
  the hands of the clock inside on to, say, half-past three when I wish it to
  open. There are no bolts, no handle, and nothing to get a leverage upon. How
  do we?"</p>

  <p>By way of a reply, a smile gradually dawned upon Jarvis's features,
  gradually widening to a broad grin. He had been partly expecting the
  question, and the smile was equally a tribute to his own skill and the
  quality of his questioner, for whom the burglar felt, if possible, a greater
  deference than before.</p>

  <p>"So they say," he replied; "but, up to the present, I haven't had an
  opportunity of trying. I'd half a mind to buy one, only things have been
  slack lately; and after all, it pays better to experiment on other peoples.
  And I've got it too, sir; I've got it, sure as you're sitting in that
  chair!"</p>

  <p>"Got what?" Charlie asked. "Let us hear your inspiration."</p>

  <p>In the excitement of the moment Jarvis rose and paced the room. He had
  almost forgotten that he was speaking to a gentleman who in his eyes was
  tantamount to an armed enemy of himself and all his creed.</p>

  <p>"The way to open those safes!" he exclaimed. "It came to me all of a
  moment since I've been sitting here. And simple, too; so simple, that a
  little child could do it. I'll just take a half-ounce of&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't let your modesty overcome you," he said. "You need not fear that I
  shall infringe upon your copyright."</p>

  <p>"It isn't that so much, sir," remarked Jarvis, with a seriousness which
  again threatened to overcome the man's gravity. "It isn't that so much, sir,
  as how I should like to be the first. The fust time you read in your paper as
  a time lock have been ax-picked, you'll know as William Jarvis done it."</p>

  <p>"There is no occasion to go out of the neighbourhood," Daintree replied.
  "I know of more than one city gentleman in this locality who has invested in
  one since the recent burglar scare. My immediate neighbour has recently had
  one erected. Come, here is an opportunity for you, while, for my part, I
  promise not to 'blow the gaff,' as you term it, in professional circles."</p>

  <p>Jarvis picked up his ears. The name of Mr. Daintree's neighbour was
  familiar enough to him, as indeed were the names of most suburban magnates.
  But, on the other hand, Chislehurst would hardly be safe ground for the
  present.</p>

  <p>Daintree rose to his feet, and moved towards the door as if to signify
  that the interview was ended. Jarvis stood behind him as he lighted a lamp,
  and followed his host to the door.</p>

  <p>"I give you your liberty as I promised," he said to the burglar, now only
  too anxious to be gone. "I have learnt something from you, and in return I
  shall say nothing of this visit. Neither, I think, will the individual whom
  you term Solemn James, who will also be at liberty to-morrow. And now, good
  night. Mind the steps. It would be a thousand pities if anything happened to
  a life so valuable as yours."</p>

  <p>"Thank you kindly, sir," Jarvis returned; "and I leave something in
  return. If I am the man I take myself for, you can leave your doors open, so
  far as the London lot are concerned, for many a day to come."</p>

  <p>Daintree extinguished his lamp, and calling to the servant who alone and
  remained up, to extinguish the electric light, walked slowly to his room. He
  has done something, certainly, but not so much as he had anticipated. But if
  the worst came to the worst, he had a secure hold on Mr. Jarvis, whose
  assistance, professionally, might with safety be relied upon for a pecuniary
  consideration.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile Mr. Jarvis drove homewards in meditative silence. He felt
  strangely elated, but withal cowed, humbled, and not a little disappointed,
  as the dazzling vision on the oak sideboard rose temptingly before his mental
  vision. He felt like a man who had disposed of an unprofitable gold mine,
  only to discover a few hours later that it had been a veritable Golconda.</p>

  <p>"And yet he wasn't a bad sort, and a plucky one, too," he ruminated.
  "Reg'lar took the steam out of me. I'd like to show him that I have some
  pluck too, and shan't be long either." Here a sudden resolution seemed to
  warm him like a fire. "I'll do it!" he cried. "Blest if I don't do it before
  this thing gets wed. Time-lock safes! And me with my knowledge!"</p>

  <h3>III</h3>

  <p class="first">MR. BRACE took himself away from Bolitree the morning
  following the collapse of his pet scheme, having wished his fellow servants a
  dignified farewell. He was sorry to leave them, he said, but there were
  private reasons, not wholly unconnected with a sudden change of fortune,
  which rendered any further menial work superfluous. Daintree kept his own
  council, he had good reason for doing so, and Brace was most sincere in his
  thanks for the kindness extended to him, a leniency he had cause to be
  thankful for.</p>

  <p>"This will be a warning to me, sir," he said, humbly. "I have had a
  lesson, and I mean to profit by it. From this time I intend to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That will do, Brace," Charlie interrupted. "There is no reason for
  gratitude, as I was actuated by anything but philanthropic motives. Give my
  compliments to Mr. Jarvis, and tell him I shall look out for the grand
  exploit; he will know what is meant. Now be off."</p>

  <p>Brace went off, somewhat hurt by this curt dismissal. He wanted an
  opportunity to display his penitent spirit, not that he was actuated by any
  feeling of the kind, but he had a natural eye for effect, and there were
  large possibilities in the present opportunity.</p>

  <p>By way of showing his gratitude, the recalcitrant butler carefully
  collected a few small articles of value, not forgetting some notepaper and
  envelopes bearing the Bolitree stamp, to say nothing of a few specimens of
  his late employer's handwriting, as previous experience taught him that such
  material proves extremely valuable upon occasion. These few souvenirs of a
  not unpleasant servitude being packed carefully away, Brace was driven from
  the house to the station at St. Mary Cray, from whence he proceeded direct to
  London, and once there, with some little fear and trembling, he walked to
  Pitt-street, with the intention of looking up Jarvis.</p>

  <p>He found that worthy in a frame of mind the reverse of seraphic. The
  feelings of admiration he had conceived for Daintree were swallowed up now by
  a sense of disappointment as his mind dwelt gloatingly upon the glittering
  heap of treasure which had so nearly been his own.</p>

  <p>He pointed to a seat, and Brace sat down noiselessly. With all his
  superior mental capacity, the soi-disant butler stood in considerable awe of
  his colleague's brute courage and reckless abandon.</p>

  <p>"You are a nice lot, ain't you?" sneered Jarvis, contemplating his
  companion with fine contempt. "You are a clever one to work out a thing for
  twelve months, and get done at last by a little dandy chap as got no mind for
  anything besides the fit of his boots and collars!"</p>

  <p>"And what were you doing all the time?" Brace asked, stung to retort. "The
  stuff was put out for you. Why didn't you take it? You, the pride of your
  profession, to be done by a gentleman who doesn't know the difference between
  a centre-bit and a plate drill! Why didn't you shoot him?"</p>

  <p>"It's no use crying over spilt milk," Jarvis replied; "and if I was done,
  it was by the coolest and pluckiest hand I ever came across. Lor', what a
  ornament he would be to the profession, surely!"</p>

  <p>It was a high compliment&mdash;the highest Jarvis could conceive.
  Presently he went on more quietly, and less aggressively.</p>

  <p>"What beats me is how he tumbled to it. He seemed to be so ready that it
  took all the steel out of me directly he spoke. And that electric light is
  the very mischief. You don't catch me on another lay where they've got that
  without cuttin' the wires first. However, it's no use sitting here snarlin'
  at one another when there's work to be done. I've taken things pretty easy
  lately, reckoning on this little job, till there's hardly a shiner in the
  place. Come, you ain't been down yonder all these months for nothing. Can't
  you put us on to a soft job, just to find the youngsters a bit of food till
  we can fix you up again."</p>

  <p>Brace smiled diplomatically, whilst a responsive grin of approbation
  illuminated Jarvis's features. Hope, the guiding star of every genius, was
  the presiding deity of his sanguine nature.</p>

  <p>"I've got a very pretty little plant, William," Brace whispered, dropping
  into the easy style of speech natural to him. "Very neat and very simple,
  provided you're as clever as you pretend to be with the tools. You can take
  it from me that last night's fiasco won't be known to a soul, and
  consequently the neighbourhood ain't likely to be alarmed. What do you say to
  a deaf housekeeper, a couple of maids, and an old gardener, who sleeps over
  the stables? There's a master, it's true&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Can't you get him out of the way?" asked Jarvis.</p>

  <p>"I can keep him in town for a night, if that's what you mean. Any way,
  it's best to be on the safe side. Now, look here."</p>

  <p>For a quarter of an hour Jarvis listened attentively, whilst his companion
  gradually unfolded a plan of masterly simplicity, combined with a minute
  attention to detail which, in themselves, paid a high tribute to Brace's
  mental grasp and power of observation.</p>

  <p>"Not that I would have thought of it, perhaps," he concluded, modestly,
  "but for a little observation as my late employer let drop. And mind you
  bring everything away, don't leave nothing, as papers, especially private
  ones, are useful enough sometimes. Remember that Eltree affair."</p>

  <p>"I do," Jarvis groaned. "Two days clear away before anybody tumbled to the
  plant, and a lot of wastepaper thrown away as turned out to be negotiable
  securities for £11,000. Don't mention it, James, the very idea makes me ill
  when I thinks on it."</p>

  <p>"It was a sin, that was," Brace sighed in company. "And now let me have a
  fine pen and some ink, so as I can bait the trap for the old gentleman. He'll
  rise fast enough; why, from all I can hear, he would get up on a frosty night
  to make a sixpence anytime."</p>

  <p>Brace was a smart penman, and one who possessed a singular talent for
  imitating handwritings, yet nearly a dozen of the thick embossed sheets
  bearing the Bolitree crest were destroyed before the artist was finally
  satisfied. At length the envelope was sealed, stamped, and despatched per a
  small edition of Jarvis, with the most careful instructions as to its
  disposal.</p>

  <p style="text-align:center">* * * * *</p>

  <p>Meanwhile things showed no signs of improvement at the Lodge. An interview
  between Brassey and his father's executor had resulted in a stormy scene, in
  which the old man had been roundly denounced as a thief and a swindler, a
  state of affairs which certainly had not tended to smooth matters for the
  young couple.</p>

  <p>"Your language is unpardonable," Bartley said, with wounded dignity. He
  was a large, expansive man, with a solemn, important mien, and his calm
  indignation sat well upon him; as Reginald grudgingly admitted. "Surely you
  cannot realize what you are saying. I enjoyed your father's confidence, sir,
  and, but for the respect I have for his memory, I would not tolerate such
  language. When you are in a calmer frame of mind, you may come to me again,
  when I shall, in spite of everything, be pleased to advise and assist you. My
  position is beyond your insinuations."</p>

  <p>Reg returned home, feeling that he had had the worst of the
  encounter&mdash;a fact freely admitted to Daintree in subsequently describing
  the scene. Charlie listened in his cool way, as they strolled round the
  garden the morning following the passage at arms with the outraged but
  virtuous stockbroker.</p>

  <p>"You should have kept your temper," Daintree observed. "I called this
  morning to see if I could pacify the old gentleman, but found that he had
  been detained in town overnight on important business. Depend upon it, there
  is something wrong there, old fellow, or I am much mistaken."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That Bartley is in Queer-street? Exactly. His confidential clerk came
  down by the first train to get some papers, and I met him coming out of the
  house as I went in, with a face as white as the ash on my cigar."</p>

  <p>Reginald Brassey laughed. As he looked round his own well-appointed
  domain, and realized the wrench it would be to leave the scene of so much
  happiness, as he shortly would be compelled to do, he experienced that
  sensation as to our neighbour's misfortunes so aptly described by
  Rochefoucauld. If the sardonic maxim applies to our friends, it loses no
  force as regards our enemies.</p>

  <p>"I am unfeignedly glad to hear it," he said, curtly.</p>

  <p>"Well, I don't know so much about that," said Daintree, who rarely spoke
  without thinking. "Bartley has had an unblemished reputation in the City for
  nearly forty years, which, taking all things into consideration, means a
  perfect concatenation of all the virtues. My theory is that he had suppressed
  that release in a moment of temptation, and that he has temporarily
  appropriated the money to his own use."</p>

  <p>"But I never asked him for the whole of the money," Brassey exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Certainly you didn't; but you had a sudden call for a large sum, and
  naturally you applied to him for it. He could not put his hand upon the
  amount you required, and consequently the danger had to be faced. He is a man
  of strong determination; he has a high reputation, and it is only his word
  against yours, which is merely unsubstantiated, after all. Farther than that,
  he holds the deeds of the Battiscombe property, and the original mortgage to
  him actually exists."</p>

  <p>"In which case, should he pull round, I shall be better off," Reggie said,
  ruefully. "He couldn't very well say that the release and repayment of
  £30,000 had been an oversight."</p>

  <p>"He won't pull round," Daintree replied. "I was in the City yesterday for
  my sins, where I was transacting a little business with my own firm, of which
  I am supposed to be head, and I heard quite enough to tell me that."</p>

  <p>"Just suppose he has destroyed the release altogether?"</p>

  <p>"That would be awkward. But the release has not been destroyed, take my
  word for that. Very few men destroy such papers while there is an off-chance
  of a proof of their execution. Bartley is no fool, and you may depend upon it
  that he carefully reviewed his position before acting as he has done. The
  time may come when you can corner him, and prove that such a deed was
  executed, in which case he will probably produce it, and thus, whilst
  incurring a deal of odium, keep outside the meshes of the law. Up to the
  present moment, the matter lies between the two of you, and there is no
  evidence of fraud. No, Reg, our astute friend has that precious parchment
  still."</p>

  <p>Brassey shook his head doubtfully. Daintree's deductions were logical
  enough, but a whole morning employed in interviewing angry and anxious
  creditors had not tended to fan the flame of hope to a dazzling radiance.
  Things had almost reached a crisis during the last twenty-four hours, more
  than one execution loomed in the near future, and every ring at the servant's
  bell sufficed to send Reggie's heart up in his mouth with sickening
  dread.</p>

  <p>As he contemplated his comforter gloomily, the front gate opened, and a
  suspicious-looking stranger entered. He had a half-diffident, half-swaggering
  air, to say nothing of a face whereon a free indulgence in strong waters' had
  told a plainly-written tale. He touched the brim of a veteran silk hat
  civilly enough, as he requested a few words with Mr. Brassey in private.</p>

  <p>"The plot thickens," said Daintree, sotto voce, as Brassey disappeared
  with his unwelcome visitor. "Were I in Reggie's unfortunate position, I
  should not feel comfortable till I knew that fellow's business."</p>

  <p>The thought that he carried his cheque book was some consolation, though
  the proffered assistance had been more than once firmly rejected. But
  Daintree had not studied the weaknesses of human nature in vain and after
  all, a man in possession is a wonderful factor in the destruction of a proud
  man's sternest resolution.</p>

  <p>"Why don't you come in?" asked Kitty, as she came towards him. "Though
  perhaps you are wise to remain where you are. I wonder whether there is a
  more miserable household anywhere just now than ours."</p>

  <p>"Lots," said Charlie, taking possession of the hand held out to him, and
  looking down tenderly into the girl's troubled eyes. "You don't mean to say
  that you are going to despair after my challenge? I am a selfish man, Kitty,
  and really, between ourselves I should have never made such a foolish
  reservation unless I felt tolerably sure of my ground."</p>

  <p>"There was no occasion to make it at all," Kitty replied, shyly. "I wonder
  why it is that one's misery and happiness is so curiously mingled! What a
  pleasant world it would be just now but for this!"</p>

  <p>She looked so sweet and subdued in her trouble that Daintree forgot his
  contract and the bond under which he had placed himself. The corner of the
  garden where they were was secluded, and the coolest of lovers is only
  mortal. He drew her head down upon his shoulder and kissed the trembling
  lips. There is no sympathy so sweet as the meeting of lips when the heart is
  too full for speech.</p>

  <p>"It is always darkest before the dawn," Charlie said, awkwardly.</p>

  <p>"I hope the light won't dazzle me when it comes, then," Kitty laughed,
  through her tears. "We ought to be all brave and resigned, I know; but,
  instead of face, I only feel wicked. Oh, dear, look at Reggie's hat! I wonder
  what new horror has happened now."</p>

  <p>The remark was warranted, as Brassey appeared with a countenance
  sufficiently agitated to convict him of any crime known in the penal
  calendar. His lips were white and trembling; the words seem to stick in his
  throat as he turned away from Daintree, whose very eyeglass beamed
  sympathetically.</p>

  <p>"I understand what it is," he said, as Kitty, obediently to a sign,
  disappeared. "My dear fellow, it isn't absolutely criminal, though poverty is
  accounted a deadly sin. There is nothing in it, after all. The suspicious
  stranger in the impossible hat has brought you an oblong slip of paper,
  containing the information that he must really trouble you to entertain him
  till you find it quite convenient to pay him. What is the amount?"</p>

  <p>"One hundred and eighteen seventeen and sixpence-halfpenny," Brassey
  replied, as he leant against a tree, and fairly groaned aloud. "It might be
  as many millions for any chance there is of its being paid."</p>

  <p>"Is there any pressing necessity for the halfpenny?" Daintree asked,
  striving to speak lightly, and signally failing; "because we might manage the
  rest. If you will permit me to try my fascinations&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Not for a moment, my dear fellow; I couldn't dream of it."</p>

  <p>"Now, look here, old chap," Daintree observed, calmly. "This is nonsense.
  I am going to be your brother-in-law&mdash;at least I hope so&mdash;and
  consequently I am as one of the family. In this capacity I do not choose for
  my future wife to be living under the same roof with a man in possession, and
  consequently I am going to pay him out. Good nature, my dear
  fellow&mdash;nonsense," as Brassey murmured some inaudible commonplace.
  "Pride, sir; foolish pride."</p>

  <p>Reg was fain to follow his self-willed friend, being too broken-down to
  make any determined resistance to his proposal. It seemed so absurdly simple,
  after all, when the dread emissary of the law came to be interviewed by
  Daintree, the mention of whose name appeared to have a powerful effect upon
  the seedy individual, who, after all, appeared to cherish no personal animus
  against the peace and happiness of the house of Brassey.</p>

  <p>"Business is business, gentlemen," he said, huskily, as he pocketed
  Daintree's cheque; "and, after all, I only do my dooty. It ain't a nice
  occupation, is mine; but it's hard to get a living, and I ain't so young as I
  used to be. Good afternoon, gents, and thank you."</p>

  <p>"And thank you," said Brassey, fervently, as he turned to his friend.
  "Without your assistance I don't know&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Now, don't," Daintree responded, wearily. "There is no emotion so
  exhaustive and less satisfactory than gratitude. So far as I am concerned,
  the matter is at an end. Are there any more expected?"</p>

  <p>"Not for a few days, at any rate, thank goodness," Reg replied. "By the
  way, I had forgotten all about Nellie, who was under the impression that I
  was in danger of immediate arrest."</p>

  <p>Any anxiety on this head was disposed of by the arrival of the lady in
  question, who regarded Daintree with such marked favour, that he took up the
  afternoon edition of the Globe, which, fortunately for him, a servant brought
  in at the moment, and hid himself behind that friendly sheet, as he conned
  the various 'full heads' with ludicrous haste.</p>

  <p>"Ah, how do you do, Mrs. Brassey?" he said. "Yes, you are looking much
  better; and, excuse me, I am rather interested in to-day's markets, having
  some tolerably heavy speculations on hand. Um! Mexicans better, Brighton A's
  firm. Do you know&mdash;Hullo! If you want news of your own locality always
  look in other papers for it. Listen to this."</p>

  <p>"He is actually excited," Kitty laughed. "It must be something strange,
  indeed."</p>

  <p>"It is," Daintree replied. "Don't interrupt as you love me."</p>

  <p>"'DARING BURGLARY AT CHISLEHURST.</p>

  <p>"'Information was received at Scotland Yard this morning concerning a most
  daring burglary in the above neighbourhood last night or early this morning.
  It appears that Mr. Septimus Bartley, the well-known stockbroker, received a
  communication yesterday afternoon, asking him to meet the writer, Mr. Charles
  Daintree (head of the firm of Daintree, Muir, and Co., Limited), at his town
  chambers shortly after midnight, on important business. Mr. Bartley
  accordingly called at the stipulated hour, and found that Mr. Daintree had
  not been there for some time, nor was he expected. Mr. Bartley thinking
  nothing of this, stayed the night at an hotel, repairing to his office the
  following morning. Happening to require some papers from his private house,
  he gave the keys to a confidential clerk, who journeyed down to Chislehurst,
  and, on arriving there, found, to his consternation, that the safe was open
  and the whole of the contents abstracted. This is all the more inexplicable,
  as the safe was fitted with one of the patent time locks of the latest
  burglar-proof design. The clock was broken, but otherwise there is no sign of
  violence.</p>

  <p>"'Just before going to press we learn that the letter from Mr. Daintree is
  supposed to be a clever forgery. The police are reported to have discovered
  an important clue to the mystery.'"</p>

  <p>"What do you think of that?" Brassey asked, at length. "Where are you
  going?"</p>

  <p>Daintree took up his hat, and hurried to the door. There was no longer any
  semblance of coolness and want of animation as he examined his watch with a
  careful scrutiny.</p>

  <p>"I am going to town," he said, smiling, curiously. "Don't you see that my
  character is at stake? Besides, I should like to know the meaning of this
  clue to the identity of the miscreant who dared to forgo my name."</p>

  <h3>IV</h3>

  <p class="first">DAINTREE contrived to catch the 4.15 up from Bromley
  arriving at Charing Cross shortly before six. Under his placid exterior there
  was a perfect tornado of excitement, such as he never remembered to have
  experienced before. It seemed an interminable time before the cab he had
  taken reached the City-road, the sorry steed pulling up at length at the
  corner of Pitt-street. Bidding the cabman to await his return, he arrived at
  length outside the residence of Jarvis, the number of which he ascertained
  from Brace before that enemy had departed from Bolitree.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry that my husband is not at home, sir," Mrs. Jarvis replied,
  civilly, to Daintree's question. "If you don't mind leaving a message?"</p>

  <p>"I must see him," he replied, "on a matter of urgent importance. You may
  have heard my name mentioned&mdash;Mr. Daintree, of Bolitree, Chislehurst. My
  good woman, all this mystery is very creditable to you, no doubt, but your
  husband I must and will see immediately, if I have to get all Scotland Yard
  to my assistance. And Jarvis would regret all that trouble, I am sure."</p>

  <p>"He might have come in by the back way," said the mistress, eyeing her
  visitor with flattering admiration. "Bless me if I don't hear his voice!"</p>

  <p>Charlie might have echoed this remark, as the high-pitched tomes of the
  burglar were palpable enough, but he remained discreetly silent. Without
  waiting for an invitation, the visitor followed his guide, and to his delight
  and surprise found himself face to face with Jarvis and Brace, the latter
  looking up with considerable alarm at the unexpected visitor.</p>

  <p>"I am fortunate," Daintree commenced. "Brace, you do not appear to be in
  any hurry to consummate your promised reformation. Oblige me by retiring to
  some convenient place whilst I have a little private conversation with
  Jarvis. Come, my time is limited."</p>

  <p>"It isn't a plant?" Jarvis asked, with palpable uneasiness. "'Cause if so
  you'll find me a different customer here, I promise."</p>

  <p>"I shall find you the same kind of customer, as you term it, always," said
  Daintree. "Neither is this what you figuratively term a plant. I am here to
  ask a question."</p>

  <p>"And blest is it sha'n't be granted," Jarvis responded heartily. "Say on,
  sir, and if I can do it the thing shall be done."</p>

  <p>"Ah! I thought we should understand one another. I dare say in your legal
  experience you have come across the term 'compounding a felony.' Now I need
  not tell you that I am not anxious to incur that epithet. Leaving that for a
  moment, an enthusiast in his calling like yourself must know that a burglary
  was committed in my neighbourhood last night."</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't wonder," Jarvis remarked, with transparent indifference.
  "There are a lot of shocking bad characters about, sir."</p>

  <p>"Well, you and I musn't be hard on them, Jarvis. The burglary in question
  consisted of robbing a safe&mdash;one of the new safes with time locks, you
  understand. It is a great pity that you should have been anticipated
  considering that, on your own showing, you are, so to speak, the sole
  patentee."</p>

  <p>Jarvis sighed pleasantly, perfectly understanding the allusion, and
  comprehending the necessity of keeping up the damning deception.</p>

  <p>"The best of us get anticipated at times," he said. "Still, the safe was
  forced, and I could have done it myself. So far, so good, and mum's the word
  between us. I can trust you, and you can trust me. Now sir?"</p>

  <p>"So far the ground is clear. The contents of that safe are in London?"</p>

  <p>"You can bet on that," Jarvis returned, confidentially. "I know that
  much."</p>

  <p>"Very good. I have a fancy to see one of the secret places where articles
  of an intrinsic value are hidden after a robbery. I want you to show me this,
  if you could yourself. And, Jarvis, if we came across the very place where
  the contents of last night's robbery are hidden, what an extremely curious
  coincidence it would be. I really should like to come across such a singular
  place today."</p>

  <p>"I understand stranger things than that have happened," Jarvis replied
  seriously. "Without any more being said, come with me."</p>

  <p>Daintree reinstated his hat, and followed his guide out into the street.
  They went along more than one dingy-looking thoroughfare till, at length,
  Jarvis paused before a respectable-looking clothier's shop, and passed
  quickly in. With a significant gesture to the amiable, elderly-looking woman
  who presided at the counter. He made his way upstairs into a fairly
  well-lighted room, the floor of which was littered with disorderly bags of
  second-hand garments of all descriptions. Hastily throwing aside a huge pile
  in one corner, he came to a heap of papers, some neatly folded and stacked,
  while others were littered in picturesque confusion.</p>

  <p>"Not a lot, sir, as you observe, and most if it rubbish," Jarvis
  explained. "Without boastin', and them sayin' too much, that's every blessed
  scrap as ever come out of one of those wonderful time-lock safes, and not so
  many hours ago either. The two parties they belonged to"&mdash;Daintree
  smiled&mdash;"were a-goin' to be goin' through this very night."</p>

  <p>It was an uncongenial, and not a very cleanly, task to wade through every
  paper in a close, evil-smelling room, but for nearly an hour Daintree
  searched the bag, while Jarvis looked on unconcernedly. There was absolutely
  nothing of value there, nothing save a few private memoranda, except at the
  very bottom of the accumulation, where a bundle of grimy parchments came to
  light. The seeker turned them over, till three parts of the way through, when
  his attention was arrested by one newer and cleaner than the rest, to which
  it was attached. They were both endorsed, the one being a date early in the
  last century, the other within two years of the present time.</p>

  <p>"I have seen all I want to see," Daintree said, with a strange thrill in
  his voice. "After all, it is not very interesting. Still, as a memento of my
  visit, I will keep this old piece of parchment, if you have no
  objection."</p>

  <p>"You can have the whole boiling if you like," Jarvis murmured with all the
  generosity of one bestowing another's goods. "If I'd ha' known&mdash;I mean
  if the man who went out of his way to get that rubbish had known as much as
  he does now, they would have been at Chisle&mdash;I mean where they came from
  still. It's a neat discovery wasted, that's what it is."</p>

  <p>Daintree felt more easy when the street was reached. Now that the first
  excitement had worn off, he began to realize the fact that his adventure
  might have had a far more dramatic conclusion.</p>

  <p>"You never told me how those time locks can be opened," he remarked, as he
  lingered for a moment by the burglar's door.</p>

  <p>"I ain't quite sure I know," Jarvis replied, cautiously; "but I don't mind
  telling you my idea. The clock inside is wound up to a certain hour when it
  runs out, and the safe doors open. Think of that now&mdash;nothing to work
  up, no purchase for bits, or drill, or plate cutters, and no cracks for the
  powder. Where are your burglars now? Beaten, of course, you say. But suppose
  we think of a way to make a clock run faster. Suppose we take a small, very
  small, dynamite cartridge, and explode that upon the top of the
  safe&mdash;what then. Why, away goes the the spring of your clock, the wheels
  run down, and in a minute the door is open. Leastways," concluded the
  speaker, with a grin so broad that his mouth almost reaches back to his ears,
  "leastways, that's how I should have gone to work if I had anything to do
  with that little job at Chislehurst."</p>

  <p>With a mind curiously exultant, Daintree was driven homeward, where he
  stopped at his club, and liberally paid the driver, who by this time had
  begun to regard his fare some considerable degree of suspicion. When there,
  he rapidly wrote out a letter and a telegram. The latter ran as
  follows:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Daintree, Oxford and Cambridge Club, to Brassey, Dalebrook Lodge,
  Chislehurst.</p>

  <p>"Be at Bolitree to-night, all of you, at seven sharp. Have news of great
  importance. Remind K. of my challenge."</p>

  <p>The letter was addressed to the City offices of Mr. Septimus Bartley, and
  was certainly calculated to relieve that gentleman's pressing
  anxiety:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"DEAR MR. BARTLEY,&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I have heard of your loss this afternoon, and tender you my condolences
  upon the annoyance to which you have been subjected. It is a little singular
  that, while my name being forged has been the cause of all the trouble, I
  should be fortunate enough to be able to throw an important light upon the
  robbery. If you can possibly walk up to Bolitree to-night, about nine, I
  shall be able to elaborate the mystery.</p>

  <p>"Yours faithfully,</p>

  <p>"CHARLES DAINTREE."</p>

  <p>"I think that will do," murmured the writer, as he blotted his neat
  signature. "By Jove, it is equal to any play I ever saw! One wants to be a
  Frenchman to enjoy the dramatic scene we shall have to-night."</p>

  <p>A little after eight o'clock the same evening, a small group were gathered
  round the fire in the Bolitree drawing-room, for the evening had turned
  chilly, and the flickering light shone gratefully upon the flushed,
  interested faces looking up to Daintree as he stood leaning on the
  mantelshelf. It was an interesting tale he had to tell, the recital of which
  had just commenced.</p>

  <p>"Do you mean to say you were alone with a real burglar here?" asked Kitty,
  her eyes sparkling with alarm. "All by yourself?"</p>

  <p>"All by myself. I had no idea of encountering the fellow myself, until I
  heard of your desperate state of affairs at the Lodge. When Kitty here and I
  talked the matter over, I had an inspiration. I determined to let Mr. Burglar
  come and take a few lessons from him, if possible."</p>

  <p>"I told you he had been committing burglary!" Kitty cried. "I knew that
  when he told us just now he had got the best of Mr. Bartley. I am dying to
  hear that part of the story."</p>

  <p>"All in good time," Brassey put in. "But you hav'n't made it clear yet how
  you know your house had been selected for a robbery."</p>

  <p>"William discovered it, as Brace was indiscreet enough to pick upon him
  for a confederate. I ordered him to say nothing, but to profess himself
  willing to be the tool, which, as a matter of fact, Brace was to cowardly to
  enact himself. From William I learnt all particulars. My first idea was to go
  up to town and put the police upon the alert, and take the burglar Jarvis
  red-handed. But I had a happier inspiration than that. With the assistance of
  William, who came home on purpose, I saw Jarvis myself; and a very enjoyable
  evening it proved to be."</p>

  <p>"Did he teach you how to open Mr. Bartley's safe?" Kitty asked,
  mischievously. "You appear to have learnt your lesson well, 'Burglar Bill's
  pupil.'"</p>

  <p>"I didn't go quite so far as that; but I certainly have learnt how these
  time locks can be manipulated," Daintree replied. "Indeed, I was also
  indiscreet enough to let him know that Mr. Bartley's safe was fitted with
  one, since he seemed so anxious to try. It certainly is a strange thing that
  it should have been done within so short a time."</p>

  <p>"I am absolutely mystified," Mrs. Brassey observed. "There seems to have
  been some wonderful plot, but I cannot understand whether or not it
  succeeded. You say Mr. Bartley&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Who is here to answer for himself," Daintree interpolated, as that
  individual was ushered in, to his extreme discomfiture. "We were just
  discussing your unfortunate loss, Mr. Bartley."</p>

  <p>"Ah, indeed!" that worthy stammered. "But I understood that you wished to
  see me on business&mdash;private business."</p>

  <p>"It affects us all," Daintree remarked, coolly. "The business upon which I
  wish to confer with you requires exactly the witnesses who are present.
  Pardon me if I refer to a painful subject, but I understand from my friend,
  Mr. Brassey, that you are under the impression that no release of the
  Battiscombe property was ever executed by you. City men are apt to forget
  such trifles, but I will ask you once more to consider carefully whether or
  not you are labouring under a mis-apprehension."</p>

  <p>"Really, this treatment is hardly fair," Bartley protested, his long,
  serious face aglow with indignation. "I certainly did not expect this, and
  again I shall not attempt to substantiate my emphatic denial that no release
  was ever executed by me. If you will allow me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You will certainly not leave this room till you have heard all I have to
  say," Daintree responded, with stern determination. "Your family lawyer, who
  drew up the document, is dead, and your affairs are now administered by
  another solicitor. But the witnesses are alive&mdash;one in America, where he
  obtained a situation on your recommendation; and the other, Saunders by name,
  who is employed in your office. Surely these circumstances may serve to
  refresh your memory, Mr. Bartley."</p>

  <p>"This is a conspiracy," returned the cheat, with faltering dignity.
  "Surely my reputation is worth something, and surely my word is worth more
  than that of a mere clerk, who will tell you that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That you signed that deed. You need not hope to coerce him, since he is
  under my roof at the present moment, ready to substantiate all I say. I will
  do Mr. Saunders the justice to remark that he knew little or nothing of your
  attempted fraud, but it is a little singular that you should have arranged to
  send him out to America also."</p>

  <p>The detected listener braced himself for the coming struggle. But, despite
  his fine assumption of outraged dignity, there was something in his
  questioner's calm face that seemed to chill his soul and damp all his natural
  courage.</p>

  <p>"Your proofs," he said. "You have made a challenge, and asserted that I am
  a trickster and a thief. My clerk remembers attesting a document purporting
  to be made between myself and Mr. Brassey. Where is the document you profess
  to have discovered?"</p>

  <p>"The document is here," said Daintree, as he drew the flat packet from his
  coat-pocket; "here, neatly tucked away inside an older parchment, so that it
  might escape discovery. A very pretty scheme, Mr. Bartley; but the game is
  over now, for even you are not bold enough to deny your own handwriting."</p>

  <p>As if fascinated by the sight of the crackling sheepskin, as if its red
  seal had been a snake to sting him, the detected imposter gazed in
  dumbfounded confusion upon the yellow sheet in Daintree's hand.</p>

  <p>"It has been stolen from me!" he cried. "It is a vile conspiracy to ruin
  me! Still, I shall be even with you yet! You have that, certainly: but even
  your hirelings cannot recover the Battiscombe deeds!"</p>

  <p>"Now, really, that is a very childish remark," Daintree observed,
  pitifully. "Of course, they are deposited with your bankers as security for a
  temporary loan; and when I show the senior partner in Brooks's this document,
  he will probably prosecute you for obtaining money by false pretences. And it
  shall be done, unless we have the deeds within a week."</p>

  <p>"Is there anything more you want me to do?" Bartley asked, humbly, when at
  length he found himself face to face in the hall with Daintree, without the
  faintest notion how he got there. "I&mdash;I&mdash;You don't know what I have
  suffered lately, and how I have been tortured."</p>

  <p>"We will leave all that to the imagination&mdash;where you found it,"
  Daintree replied, with lofty disgust. "Get those deeds back within the week,
  and rely upon us to say nothing. We are not afraid for our part. Here is your
  hat. In a week, mind. Good night!"</p>

  <p>The flickering firelight showed the tears in Mrs. Brassey's eyes, as
  Daintree did not fail to notice. Reggie caught him by the hand, while Kitty
  looked up with a glance in which pleasure, love, and admiration were all
  mingled. There was happiness enough and to spare, but no one spoke for a
  moment.</p>

  <p>"I declare I could kiss you!" Kitty whispered, as she laid her white arms
  on her lover's shoulders and looked into his eyes with rapture.</p>

  <p>"Don't restrain your feelings," Charlie laughed; but there was a catch in
  his voice, too. "It is always a bad thing for young people to do. At any
  rate, I think I have fairly earned my reward, as I have fairly redeemed my
  promise. And here is the proof of my assertion."</p>

  <p>He placed the paper, so insignificant-looking and yet meaning so much, in
  her hands, Brassey looking on in stolid astonishment.</p>

  <p>"But where on earth did you get that from?" he found words to ask.</p>

  <p>"Where do you imagine I got it from? Do you think I fired the imagination
  of my burglar friend for nothing? Why, when I told him where he could find
  scope for his zeal in the time-lock line, he rose to it directly. My real
  inspiration of genius came when I opened the Globe this afternoon, and read
  that Bartley had been robbed. I rushed straight to town, and, by diplomatic
  means, got a sight of the contents of the safe."</p>

  <p>"But how could you possibly know that the same thieves had been at each?"
  Mrs. Brassey asked. "That was not all guess work."</p>

  <p>"Not quite," Daintree admitted, candidly. "William was told off to watch
  Brace after the attempted burglary here, and he discovered the fact that that
  rascal had stolen some of my papers. When my name was chosen as the decoy, I
  felt absolutely certain."</p>

  <p>It was a merry, if a somewhat quiet, party who left Bolitree an hour
  later. Brassey and his wife in front, Daintree and Kitty lingering behind.
  The peaceful starlight night suited their mood, and for once Kitty was shy
  and constrained.</p>

  <p>"It was clever of you," she whispered, as she tightened her grasp on the
  arm upon which she was leaning. "But I shall always be afraid of you
  now."</p>

  <p>"Because I am a burglar?" Charles laughed. "There is only one thing more I
  want to steal, and that I must have, if it is not mine already."</p>

  <p>"And that?"</p>

  <p>"Your heart, darling. It was a promise, you remember."</p>

  <p>"Which was given before the promise was made," Kitty answered, shyly, as
  her lover stooped and pressed his lips to hers. "It was given before, so that
  you have had no reward after all. And to think," she continued, with her old
  gaiety&mdash;"to think, that with all my aspirations after the heroes of
  fiction who come with titles and riches galore to lay them at the feet of the
  impecunious but beautiful maiden, I should fall so low as to marry 'Burglar
  Bill's Pupil.'"</p><br>

  <h2><a id="story5"
     name="story5">5.&mdash;A CAPTIOUS CRITIC</a></h2>

  <h3>Published in <i>Chambers's Journal</i>, May(?) 1895<br>
  Reproduced from <i>The Geneva Advertiser</i>, New York, Vol. XV, No. 22, 28
  May 1895, p 1</h3>

  <p class="first">I AM NOT a great novelist, albeit a fairly popular one. It
  is far better to be popular than great and makes all the difference to one's
  material comfort A great author is rarely appreciated, at least until he is
  dead, whereas the popular one winters in the Riviera and has portraits of his
  drawing room furniture in <i>The Strand Magazine</i>. Anyway my work is in
  good demand. Commissions are plentiful, so plentiful that last summer I
  rather overdid the thing, the natural consequence being nervous irritability
  and a tendency to lie awake o' nights, and as a greater writer than myself
  says, "That way madness lies."</p>

  <p>"What you want," remarked my doctor, who is one of those charming
  practitioners who always precribe exactly what the patient most longs for,
  "is a thorough change. Give up work altogether for a month. Go to some quiet,
  breezy spot on the coast and simply live out of doors."</p>

  <p>I had no difficulty in summoning up enough will power to follow out this
  request. Solitude has no terrors for me. I packed up my bag and took the
  first train to Barnstaple, whence I drifted to a place called Morthoe, and
  there I pitched my tent&mdash;if the expression may be allowed&mdash;in a
  comfortable farmhouse, where the welcome was all that could possibly be
  expected for the money.</p>

  <p>I did not tell anyone what my profession was, and consequently I passed
  for an ordinary individual. After a time I naturally made
  acquaintances&mdash;the parson and the squire and that kind of thing. There
  was nobody with whom to talk shop, which was a drawback. But even that comes
  in time. I found my <i>fidus Achates</i> one morning on the sands, where I
  had gone in search of a bath. He was a tall, rather melancholy-looking man,
  with a restless eye. Being anything but a bold swimmer, and the coast being
  dangerous, I was naturally indisposed to try the briny deep, and my new
  acquaintance obligingly pointed out a perfect natural bath wherein I could
  disport myself.</p>

  <p>"Almost as if it were made on purpose," he remarked." I always come here
  myself. I've got a house behind the sand hills there. I shall be pleased to
  see you any evening that you care to drop in."</p>

  <p>I thanked the speaker, and for the time being we parted. Subsequent
  inquiry elicited the fact that my friend's name was Walter Wanless, and that
  he was a stranger who had taken a furnished house there for a year. Usually,
  I was informed, he preserved a reserved attitude. He was inclined to be
  eccentric, and all is housework, cooking, etc., was done for him by a
  solitary manservant, who, so the gossips hinted, was employed more In the
  capacity of a keeper than anything else.</p>

  <p>As a novelist this suggestion merely served to pique my curiosity. A
  writer looks unconsciousiy for copy even in moments of leisure. But I am
  bound to confess that I saw nothing peculiar in the behavior of Wanless when
  one day I lunched with him. The sole was done to the turn, a subsequent dish
  of curry left nothing to be desired, the sherry was really dry and not merely
  acid, and the lusty servitor waited in a manner which would have done credit
  to a professional. Yet at the same time I oould not help seeing that Wanless
  was very much afraid of his man Bellamy. For instance, when he attempted to
  help himself to a third. glass of sherry, Bellamy calmly removed the glass
  and placed the decanter at my end of the table. The thing was done so coolly
  that I could hardly restrain my astonishment. For a moment I saw a lurid
  light flash into the peculiar dark eyes of my host His hand clinched; then he
  laughed pleasantly. "Bellamy presumes, as all old servants do," Wanless said.
  "But he is right, all the same. I am a wretched drinker."</p>

  <p>Bellamy said nothing. He did not even smile. He handed round a box of
  cigars, from which Wanless selected one, and then he locked up the box and
  put the key in his pocket.</p>

  <p>"You don't want to sit here all day, sir," he said respectfully, but
  firmly. "You had better go for a walk, I think."</p>

  <p>Wanless rose obediently, and I followed. As we passed through the hall I
  caught a glimpse of a small but complete-looking library, which was lined
  with books. With the fascination that volumes of any kind possess for me, I
  was about to enter when Bellamy closed the door and locked it. "Sir," he said
  to his employer, "you are wasting the afternoon."</p>

  <p>Well, it wasn't for me to interfere if Wanless was disposed to put up with
  that kind of thing. We had a very pleasant afternoon upon the sands, when I
  found my friend to be a wonderfully entertaining companion, exceedingly well
  read, but shy, I thought, on speaking of modern writers of fiction. We parted
  at length with mutual regret.</p>

  <p>"I shall not see you for the next day or two," Wanless remarked, grasping
  my hand heartily, "as business calls me away, but I shall be delighted if you
  will dine with me on Thursday. Bellamy will not be present, as he has a day
  off, and I shall order dinner to be sent in from the hotel. And now good
  afternoon, my dear Gibson."</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact, my name is Osborne, but it is one of the weaknesses
  of human nature whenever a man is addressed by the wrong patronymic to allow
  the mistake to pass. It would have been far better for me had I corrected the
  mistake instead of allowing it to pass in my haste to accept the invitation
  to dinner.</p>

  <p>At half past 6 on the Thursday night I entered Wanless' dining-room. The
  dinner was not all that could be desired, but then Bellamy was absent, and
  the food was brought and served by a waiter from the hotel. The wines, which
  were my host's own, left nothing to be wanted. The peculiar sherry was there
  and some wonderful champagne of 1874 vintage to which we both did ample
  justice. By the time we had completed our repast Wanless' eyes were shining,
  and his manner had grown a little more boisterous.</p>

  <p>"And now no more wine," he said as he dismissed the waiter. "I shall
  suffer terribly in the morning from what I have had already, and Bellamy will
  bully me in his polite way for a week. Let us go into the library and smoke.
  We shall be quite alone and can have a cozy chat. It is not often that I have
  the nerve to face my books, much as I love them. Time was when things were
  very different, and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Wanless broke off abruptly and led the way to the library. A lamp was on
  the table. A little fire burned in the grate, and yet in that cheerful,
  book-lined apartment I felt singularly depressed. I tried to shake off the
  feeling. I tried to ignore the gleam that flashed in the dark, restless eyes
  of my companion. With as much ease as I could assume I carelessly examined
  the well-filled shelves. "You appear to have a good selection here," I
  remarked. "In so select a gathering I am flattered at seeing a volume of my
  own."</p>

  <p>Any writer will pardon the innocent vanity of the remark. I heard a short
  sharp exclamation break from my host. I saw his eyes blazing as he looked
  toward the book on which my hand lay lovingly.</p>

  <p>"Oh, so you are that Osborne," he said in a manner most uncomplimentary.
  "I had no idea that I was entertaining so great a man. Ah, ah!" The laugh was
  about the most unpleasant I have over heard.</p>

  <p>"Sit down," my host commanded. "Oh, I know your work very well indeed. In
  fact, I know the work of the whole gang of you. But I haven't read a line of
  that volume of short stories you have there. The stories are quite recent I
  suppose?"</p>

  <p>I replied as quietly as I could in the affirmative, at least as quietly as
  a man can when his host with eyes "in a fine frenzy rolling," locks the door
  and puts the key carefully away in his pocket.</p>

  <p>"Then of course you remember all the <i>dénouement</i>&mdash;hateful
  word," Wanless said as he opened my innocent book and glanced at the first
  story. "We will have a little mental amusement and you shall correct me if I
  am wrong. I see the first story is a ghost tale called 'The White Mystery.'
  And here, looking casually through, I find are two characters. They are
  brothers&mdash;one a brave military man, the other a nervous, imaginative
  youth who is scoffed at by the brother because he fears a ghost. Let me
  forecast the end of the story. The youngster sees the spook and dies of
  terror on the spot while the other fool can never speak afterwards without
  trembling when he recounts the story. Doesn't he say that he 'cannot speak of
  the nameless horror of that awful face'?"</p>

  <p>"You have guessed it" I said, with a stifled parody of a laugh. But
  Wanless did not appear to be at all elated by his success. He smiled with
  bitter, weary scorn and fluttered over the leaves to the next story. "I take
  no credit to myself for that discovery," he proceeded, "Here is another
  little thing, entitled 'My Uncle Dick.' Heavens, what awful memories does
  that hoary kind of title conjure up! Let me prophesy again. Uncle Dick is a
  man of money. He is crusty and curt. The hero of the story, written in the
  autobiographical style, wants to marry a cousin, and the old boy won't let
  him. Said old boy dies of apoplexy after a fit of passion and leaves nothing
  to the narrator but an old deed chest, in which are discovered securities of
  priceless value. So they get married and live happily ever after, eh?"</p>

  <p>"Your foresight is really wonderful," I replied. "Any one would think that
  you had been a writer of current fiction yourself."</p>

  <p>Wanless glared at me so threateningly that I involuntarily moved toward
  the poker. His eyes were filled with horror, hate and loathing.</p>

  <p>"Man, you don't know what I am. You cannot understand what has brought me
  to my present pitiable condition," he hissed. "Let us carry on the ghastly
  farce to the end. Here is another of your screeds. It is called 'The Black
  Bag.' I wonder how many thousands of tales have been written with the same
  title? Again let us pursue the psychological programme. The hero is a young
  man who gets into conversation with an engaging stranger in a railway
  carriage. The fascinating one has a black bag. When they change carriages,
  some one accosts the stranger, who informs his companion he is detained by
  business. Well, he delivers the bag at an address in Liverpool. It's always
  Liverpool, by the way. Well, the police arrest the courteous ass, and the bag
  contains an infernal machine. Man, can you deny that I am correct?"</p>

  <p>I couldn't. My head was bowed with shame. Viewing myself in the lurid
  mirror of those dark eyes, I saw myself as others see me. Never has an author
  been so at the mercy of a critic before.</p>

  <p>"I claim no marvelous foresight," Wanless said sternly. "Let us try again.
  Here is another story, called *A Strange Coincidence.' Need I say that it
  refers to a singular dream of a deserted wife which makes such an impression
  upon her that she telegraphs her husband not to go near a certain place at a
  time named. He disregards the warning and is murdered. Again, I will ask you
  to correct me if I am mistaken."</p>

  <p>"Well, you are this time," I said as cheerfully as possible. "The husband
  refrains, and some one mistaken for him is done to death."</p>

  <p>This little point in my favor rendered me more cheerful. I was about to
  give vent to some little <i>jeu d'esprit</i> when my companion gave a cry of
  rage and horror, at the same time dashing the book to the ground. "I knew
  it!" he shouted as he bounded to his feet. "I knew that I should come across
  it in that oursed volume. I cannot even get away from it in my solitary
  retreat. Is there no originality in the craft at all? Here it is in your
  volume called 'By Mental Telegraph.' The title explains the story. Oh, I know
  that mysterious, slender, beautiful maiden, with her visions and
  hallucinations, but too well&mdash;the psychological siren who has driven me
  to madness. She recovers when she gets a husband and becomes a model queen of
  the nursery ever afterward. But I shall always be the same. It is you and
  your class who are responsible for this. You must die."</p>

  <p>With the last word ringing on his lips Wanless flew at me and bore me to
  the ground. Strong as I was, I was powerless in his grasp, for the madman
  possessed the strength of a dozen beings at that moment. I could feel his hot
  breath upon my face as he bent over me.</p>

  <p>"You are one of the fiends who have robbed me of my reason," he hissed.
  "You are one of the successful hacks who dress up old tales and try to
  galvanize paralytic corpses into life until the gibbering dead faces mock us
  to insanity. Once I deemed the world to be fresh and bright, but the weary
  monotony of the novels I craved for made me what I am. Make the most of your
  time. You will never leave this room alive. As a duty to my fellow sufferers
  I am going to rid the world of one scribbling fiend tonight!"</p>

  <p>I tried to expostulate, but the words died on my lips. Wanless bent over
  me and gripped my throat vith convulsive force. The strength of despair came
  back to me as I realized that we were in that solitary place alone, and that
  my life depended upon my own efforts. We rolled over and over, but Wanless
  was always uppermost From time to time I compelled him to relinquish his
  grip. The sudden rush of air to m lung s caused m e to feel sick and dizzy.
  But the contest was bound to end in one way, for as I became weaker my
  antagonist gathered fresh vigor.</p>

  <p>"It is useless," he cried triumphantly. "You have got to die."</p>

  <p>I knew it, but would not despair. And then, as I commenced to fail, there
  came a sound welcome as a voice from heaven&mdash;the sound of Bellamy's step
  in the hall. He tried the door, only to find it fast. He shouted, and in
  response came a feeble gurgle from me. Bellamy wasted no further time.
  Something told him that he had arrived in time to prevent a terrible tragedy.
  As Bellamy's whole weight broke in the door Wanless gave me a squeeze that
  caused the countless Stars to dance and flicker before my eyes. Then sleep,
  peaceful and childlike.</p>

  <p>When I came to myself again, I was in bed. The windows were open to the
  breeze, a glorious sun was shining, and Bellamy stood respecfully before me,
  On the whole, I felt little the worse for my adventure.</p>

  <p>"I am extremely sorry for what has happened, sir," Bellamy said politely.
  "The people here know nothing, and I shall esteem it a personal favor if you
  will preserve our secret. I ought perhaps to have told you, sir."</p>

  <p>"But what on earth is the matter with Mr. Wanless?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, sir," Bellamy said deferentially, "my master's name is not Wanless
  at all. He is Mr. Cultshaw, the critic and essayist who used to be 'reader'
  to Messrs. Gilley, the great publishers. Of course you know him by name, sir.
  Two years ago the poor gentleman had brain fever from overwork, and he's
  never been the same since. If he has three glasses of wine, he's quite mad.
  Usually he is harmless enough, but when excited he has a perfectly morbid
  hatred of magazine writers. He attributes his malady to reading the same
  class of story with what he calls the same motif over and over again. He did
  not know you by sight and indeed mistook your name, but you he holds in
  especial detestation, sir. He would have killed you if he could."</p>

  <p>"I quite believe that Bellamy," I replied grimly. "But you may trust me to
  say nothing about what has happened. How is your patient?"</p>

  <p>"Perfectly well this morning and without a notion of what took place last
  night. But on the whole, sir, I would respectfully beg to suggest that you do
  not meet again. I don't suppose that you are specially attached to the place,
  and as it agrees with my poor master"&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Say no more, Bellamy," I replied. "I will get away today. I came out for
  quiet and rest and not for midnight adventures. And there's a £10 note for
  you, Bellamy, with my most grateful thanks."</p>

  <p>From that day to this I have seen nothing of Wanless, nor am I likely to
  now, for he died last week, and therefore I am at liberty to publish this
  singular story, the moral of which is obvious. People say that latterly my
  stories are less trite than they were. Have any of you noticed it, may I
  ask?</p>

     name="story6">6.&mdash;AN EASTERN PRINCESS</a></h2>

  <h3>Published in<i>The Kalgoorlie Western Argus</i>, West Australia, 6 Jan
  1898</h3>

  <p class="first">LADY CONWAY drew her cloak closer around her. Really, the
  weather was most annoying. Why are the elements so republican, and why do
  they disturb aristocratic picnics the same as they do the cottage of 'Arry
  and 'Arriet!</p>

  <p>"I hope that I am not causing you inconvenience," quoth her ladyship.</p>

  <p>The girl to whom Lady Conway spoke did not seem to be overcome by the
  greatness of her visitor, although the latter had confessed her rank and
  station. An aristocratic flavor and odor of wealth seemed to permeate the
  sitting-room of the cottage where Lady Conway was sheltering from the storm.
  Doubtless the other patrician revellers had found havens elsewhere.</p>

  <p>"You have not been living here long&mdash;er&mdash;Miss Anthony."</p>

  <p>Corona Anthony's cheek dimpled. An audacious observer might have said that
  she was laughing at the questioner. A feeling of annoyance possessed Lady
  Conway. People in cottages, especially in cottages contiguous to Sir Robert's
  estate, were not prone to treat her in this way.</p>

  <p>"I gather that you are not purely English?" the visitor proceeded.</p>

  <p>"Unfortunately, no. But your people are very kind to us."</p>

  <p>Lady Conway felt a little inclined to box Corona's ears. She was puzzled;
  and few of us enjoy that sensation. The whole thing savored of mystery. The
  cottage was small the kind of tenement which in the country produces about 10
  per annum, and yet the furniture was exquisite.</p>

  <p>There were few pictures on the walls, but they were gems. As the wife of
  an ex-Ambassador who knew the East well, Lady Conway was not blind to the
  fact that Conway Court contained nothing finer or more costly in the way of a
  carpet than the Persian square on the cottage floor. Those bronzes were
  beyond all question Cellinis.</p>

  <p>To a certain extent all this was a grievance. So was the beauty of Corona.
  A girl living in a 10 cottage had no business to be so lovely as Corona. Her
  features had the high patrician cast of the Greek; her hair was as the glory
  of the summer morning; she moved about the room with the grace and ease of a
  cat. With Marion Crawford and Turgeneff in her mind, Lady Conway found her
  thoughts gravitating in the direction of Nihilism. Some of these foreign
  desperadoes were fairly well born, and money was always ready for political
  crime. Being of a passing generation Lady Conway had, of course, read
  'Idalia.' Corona Anthony was Idalia revised, and brought up to date.</p>

  <p>On the whole, Lady Conway was by no means sorry when the passing
  thunder-cloud had spent its force, and she was free to seek her picnic party
  once more. The sun shone brightly upon the hanging woods beyond the river,
  already the short springy turf was drying fast under the warm rays. At the
  trysting-place the revellers had already foregathered.</p>

  <p>There were Sir Robert Conway, big and pompous; his son Robert, a natty
  young man, with a pleasant, handsome face and a frank smile. Most of the
  girls regarded Bob Conway tenderly&mdash;it is a way they have with
  good-looking youngsters who are heirs apparent to fat investments and ancient
  acres. There were nice-looking women, a few diplomats, and Ivan Lobanoff.</p>

  <p>The latter, an attache of the Liberian Embassy, came sliding up to Lady
  Conway, who spoke highly of the fascination of Lobanoff's manner. He had a
  slim waist, a sleek head, and a fearfully waxed moustache. Some people
  averred that he was not troubled with many scruples. They were wrong,
  inasmuch as he had no scruples at all.</p>

  <p>"We have missed you," he said. "We were beginning to get alarmed."</p>

  <p>"To tell the truth," Lady Conway remarked. "I have had an adventure.
  Robert, who are those people who have taken the Red Cottage?"</p>

  <p>"Really, I cannot say, my dear," Sir Robert replied. "Magness says they
  are foreigners. So long as they pay their rent regularly it doesn't matter.
  Why?"</p>

  <p>"Because there is a girl there. A most beautiful girl, who looks like a
  lady. But you must have seen her. Is she not lovely?"</p>

  <p>"Not bad," said Bob. "Dark, isn't she? I've almost forgotten."</p>

  <p>Lobanoff smiled. He sidled up to Bob like a cat. He never walked boldly up
  to anybody, like other people. He seemed to regard others as his mice.</p>

  <p>"You overdid that, mon cher," he whispered. "Oh, yes; I understand."</p>

  <p>But Corona Anthony was already forgotten. There were other things to
  occupy the general attention. And so the afternoon passed away until the
  carriages came and drove the Conway house party home to dinner. Sir Robert,
  who found picnics to be out of his line, crept into the library for a cigar
  before dressing. There he found Lord Maltravers, Envoy to the Court of
  Arsenia, now in England on leave, supposed to be connected with some
  important treaty.</p>

  <p>"Just the very man I wanted," said the latter. "Have you looked over the
  papers."</p>

  <p>"I have, my dear Mal; I congratulate you. The thing will be a great
  triumph for you; a fine thing, commercially speaking, for England. It will
  represent the first reversion of Paris or Vienna."</p>

  <p>"Not if Lobanoff knew," Maltravers smiled.</p>

  <p>"No, he would not hesitate to steal the papers. Just now the fellow's
  presence in the house constitutes a positive danger. I feel perfectly certain
  he was at the bottom of the disappearance of those precis notes in Berlin
  that caused so much trouble when I was there years ago. Why my wife asked him
  to come down just now I can't imagine."</p>

  <p>"My dear fellow, your wife said the same about yourself. The man seems to
  have actually invited himself. I wonder if he knows about those papers. But
  Vickers comes to-night and leaves with them tomorrow."</p>

  <p>"Good! Take my advice, and give Vickers a hint. You'd better have the
  papers now."</p>

  <p>Sir Robert proceeded to unlock the safe in a corner of a library. But the
  papers in question were not to be found. The pallor of Sir Robert's face was
  reflected by the dead whiteness of Maltravers'. In silence every paper was
  turned out, but no draft treaty was to be found amongst them.</p>

  <p>"I'll take my oath," Sir Robert remarked in trembling tones, "that I
  placed the documents there last night at eleven. I locked up the safe
  carefully, and put the key in my pocket. I had one cigar in the smoking-room
  afterwards."</p>

  <p>"Ah! That would be after all the rest of us had gone to bed. Were you
  alone."</p>

  <p>"No, Lobanoff was with me. I dropped to sleep for a few minutes over my
  cigar, and when I came to myself Lobanoff had gone. But the key of the safe
  was in my pocket. I found it there this morning."</p>

  <p>"Tell me, did you feel tired and heavy when you woke?"</p>

  <p>"Well, yes, come to think of it. But I fail to see&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Pshaw! Lobanoff's presence here is explained. Russia is at the bottom of
  it, of course. You were drugged with some potent yet transient poison. Don't
  look like that, my dear old friend; I cannot blame you. I am ruined."</p>

  <p>"Who speaks about ruin?"</p>

  <p>The two old men turned with a start. Bob stood there. Moved by the impulse
  of a sympathetic longing, Sir Robert told the story.</p>

  <p>"What an infernal shame!" Bob cried. "Of course, it is not for me to
  advise you, but if I were you I would go on just as if nothing had happened.
  Don't let Lobanoff see you have discovered your loss. We may hit upon some
  way of getting the document back. We might pay him off in his own coin."</p>

  <p>"Not in my house," Sir Robert said, sternly.</p>

  <p>"All the same the lad is right," Maltravers replied. "Heaven grant that
  there may be some way found out of the difficulty."</p>

  <p>Hearts may ache and eyes smart with tears restrained, but men must dine.
  Under the pools of light cast by shaded lamps the guests sat and chatted
  merrily. None were more gay than Sir Robert and Maltravers. Diplomacy formed
  the staple food for conversation. The State of Sparta gave a start to the
  discourse.</p>

  <p>"Depend upon it," Maltravers remarked, "that the late King Hugo did a wise
  and patriotic thing when he resigned the throne and went into voluntary
  exile. He had done the fighting and his exit soothed wounded pride, and made
  the way clear for the needed social reforms. A man in a million."</p>

  <p>Nobody seemed to combat this statement, and the meal proceeded. King
  Hugo's utter disappearance had created a profound impression three years
  before, but it had become ancient history by this time, and some of the
  younger men were playing with their cigarette cases impatiently. Lady Conway
  took the hint, taking a rustling train of silks and scents after her.</p>

  <p>One or two of the men drifted out on the terrace. Bob drifted further
  still, and that was out into the park. Once out of sight he began to slide
  along more quickly, until he came under the shadow of a spreading oak, where
  he he paused.</p>

  <p>A minute or two later and a girl joined him. It was Corona Anthony. A rare
  smile trembled on her lips, there was a proud, yet shy, welcome in her
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"How good of you!" Bob whispered.</p>

  <p>"Say rather how good of both of us," was the reply. "And how wrong of both
  of us."</p>

  <p>"Why? My dear Corona, if you only knew&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"My dear Bob, if your mother only knew!"</p>

  <p>She had him there. But youth is ever sanguine, and Bob had always been a
  spoilt boy from the early days.</p>

  <p>"My mother will come to love you yet," he cried.</p>

  <p>"Never so much as you do," Corona said decisively. "No, I shan't let you
  kiss me. I am not going to be kissed until&mdash;well, until your mother says
  you may. And now tell me all the news. I am always interested in the doings
  of great people."</p>

  <p>Almost before Bob was aware of the fact, he had told the story of the
  missing treaty. Corona surprised him by the intelligent interest she
  betrayed, and the comprehensive grasp of the whole question at issue.</p>

  <p>"I know the country well," she said. "My father&mdash;but never mind my
  father. The question is&mdash;whom do you suspect?"</p>

  <p>"Well," Bob replied, "there is a man called Lobanoff&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Lobanoff! Ivan Lobanoff! Did I hear the name aright?"</p>

  <p>Bob regarded the speaker with amazement. She seemed to have grown inches
  taller. She might have been a queen rebuking a criminous subject. With a ring
  of command in her voice, she turned to Bob.</p>

  <p>"Fetch that man to me at once," she said. "I will wait here. Go!"</p>

  <p>Bob went. He couldn't help it. Had Corona ordered him to burn down the
  court in the same ringing voice he felt that he must have obeyed. He found
  Lobanoff hanging over the terrace puffing rings of smoke into the amber
  air.</p>

  <p>"Come along with me," he said. "I want you."</p>

  <p>Lobanoff complied without wasting time in questions. But as Corona stepped
  from behind the tree his gay air vanished. He seemed to be framing words with
  his lips, but no sound came from them.</p>

  <p>"Leave us," said Corona to Bob. "You will please to retire out of hearing,
  but you need not go out of sight."</p>

  <p>Bob complied, wondering. He saw that Corona was speaking words of winged
  flame.</p>

  <p>"You miserable wretch," she was saying. "I am not going to spare you. A
  pretty servant of the Czar are you&mdash;taking his money and plotting for
  his life. A telegram to the Chief of Police at St. Petersburg, hinting at a
  search of your headquarters there, and your life is not worth a month's
  purchase. How do I know this. Your ally, Count Czarny, fell into my brother's
  hands a while ago, and the compromising papers found on him betrayed you all.
  False to the Czar as you are to us, why should I spare you?"</p>

  <p>"Ah, that accounts for Czarny's strange silence," Lobanoff cried.</p>

  <p>Corona smiled meaningly.</p>

  <p>"Spare me," Lobanoff went on; "have a little mercy. I admit that my
  treachery to the&mdash;to your father was great, but I have tried to atone.
  My new life&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You lie," Corona cried, "there is no new life for you. As well expect the
  sun to shine by night. Even here you are playing your vile part. Still, I am
  prepared to spare your life, for I do hold your life, on one condition."</p>

  <p>"Name it, and it is yours," Lobanoff cried eagerly.</p>

  <p>"Give me the papers you stole from Sir Robert Conway last night."</p>

  <p>The Russian's jaw dropped. He passionately denied the accusation.</p>

  <p>"They are in your pocket at the present moment," Corona said, as she
  prepared to move away; "you dare not trust them elsewhere. But as you seem to
  have made your choice, so you must abide by it."</p>

  <p>Lobanoff collapsed suddenly. He snatched the papers from his breast.</p>

  <p>"Take them," he whispered; "take them, and for ever hold your peace."</p>

  <p>"The word of an Anthony should suffice for a Lobanoff," Corona replied. "I
  have no wish to detain you any longer, sir. If you take my advice, you will
  endeavor to find a more suitable climate elsewhere."</p>

  <p>Lobanoff crept away, and presently disappeared. When Bob came eagerly up
  to Corona again, the ice had melted once more.</p>

  <p>"Here are the papers you required," she smiled. "Am I not clever?"</p>

  <p>"I am positively afraid of you," Bob replied. "It is like a wonderful
  romance. How did you manage to coerce that man?"</p>

  <p>"That must be my secret for the present, Bob. You may know all some day.
  Lobanoff once held service under my father. He was guilty of a dual treachery
  which, if exposed to the Czar, would cause him to end his days in Siberia. I
  used this threat as a lever, and you have the result in your hands. Lord
  Maltravers will sleep with an easy mind to-night."</p>

  <p>"You darling! And I may tell, then, that you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Corona had a sudden relapse into her regal manner.</p>

  <p>"You will do nothing of the kind," she said. "If you dare to betray me, I
  shall never speak to you again. I cannot use this thing as a passport to the
  good graces of your family. If you only knew my history&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Corona broke off suddenly. She saw how eagerly Bob was waiting for the
  rest. Then her lovely face broke into a rippling smile.</p>

  <p>"Go home," she said, "go home and ease the mind of that nice old
  gentleman. I used to know him once, but there is no occasion to recall the
  fact. Then you can meet me here the day after to-morrow and tell me what has
  happened. All your guests will be gone by that time, I understand."</p>

  <p>Bob found his father and Maltravers in the library. They were still
  discussing the impasse, and melancholy had marked them for her own. Bob drew
  the papers from his pocket, and held them aloft triumphantly.</p>

  <p>"Who speaks first?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Maltravers gave a hoarse cry. He could hardly believe his eyes. When he
  became a little more composed again he asked how the thing was managed.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I can't tell you," Bob replied. "Unfortunately the secret is
  not my own. Oh, yes, Lobanoff had the papers, and the&mdash;a&mdash;other
  person persuaded him to give them up. I congratulate you, my lord."</p>

  <p>With which Bob repaired to the billiard room, leaving the two men
  alone.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid this is going to cause you trouble," Maltravers observed.</p>

  <p>"I can't see it," replied Conway. "Why?"</p>

  <p>"Because there's a woman in the case. No man could have bested Lobanoff in
  that way. I'm very sorry, my dear fellow, because I'm the one most to
  blame."</p>

  <p>"Nonsense, old friend; this bother has affected your intellect."</p>

  <p>"Let us hope so," Maltravers responded. "Now I'll try one of these
  Partagas. I think I could appreciate the flavor to-night."</p><br>

     name="story7">7.&mdash;THE AZOFF DIAMONDS</a></h2>

  <h3>Published in <i>The Capricornian</i>, Rockhampton, Qeensland, Australia,
  30 Jul 1898</h3>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p class="first">PRINCE SERGIUS MARAZOFF looked at the letter in his hand,
  and frowned. A recent lion in London society, he had been voted charming. His
  manners reminded people of Chesterfield and D'Orsay, with a dash of Bayard
  and the Cid thrown in. Wealthy princes in a state of bachelorhood are
  proverbially more fascinating than other people.</p>

  <p>All the same the expression on the face of the Prince at this moment was
  anything but pleasant to see. The handsome features showed the wild Calmuc
  blood, the cruel Tartar strain. Under the thin veneer the tiger slept. The
  tiger looked out of Sergius's eyes at that moment.</p>

  <p>The Asiatic vim seemed strangely out of place in one of the Long's most
  perfectly appointed sitting rooms. One does not look to see a panther lying
  before the fireplace in my lady's boudoir.</p>

  <p>"A thousand curses on the woman," the Prince muttered. "Why does she
  worry, knowing that I am never likely to yield? And in any case, she is quite
  powerless to gain her ends."</p>

  <p>Prince Sergius read the letter again. Then he tore it in a thousand
  pieces.</p>

  <p>"Pshaw!" he went on. "What care I for her threats. Ten chances to one if I
  ever return to Russia again, and if I don't my estates are mortgaged to the
  last penny. The Czar will confiscate nothing there. The thing is a sham and
  delusion, to persuade people I have a stake in my own country. Personally, I
  prefer securities in London or Paris."</p>

  <p>A gigantic servant in livery flung open the door.</p>

  <p>"A lady to see your Excellency," he said.</p>

  <p>"To see me! She has been here before, Fritz?"</p>

  <p>"Even so, Prince. She left the letter last night. I said you were engaged,
  but she persisted. Your Excellency will instruct me."</p>

  <p>Fritz came no further than the door. He knew his noble master in his
  present mood. The Calmuc was uppermost. A lurid light flashed in the eyes of
  the Prince, the light of murder.</p>

  <p>"Throw her into the street," he said, hoarsely. "No, on second thoughts,
  you will show the lady up here, Fritz."</p>

  <p>Fritz disappeared with more alacrity than befits a person in his exalted
  station. Prince Sergius might charm a ballroom by his graceful leading a
  cotillion, but he could also keep a servant waiting with a match for a
  cigarette until the flame burnt out against his fingers. He paid for this
  kind of thing.</p>

  <p>Again Fritz flung open the door and a lady entered. That she had foreign
  blood in her veins was evident; that she was singularly beautiful was patent
  to the dimmest eye. Otherwise she could have passed for an Englishwoman of
  distinction. Sergius smiled as he indicated a chair.</p>

  <p>"So you have found me out, Marie?" he said.</p>

  <p>"I found you out long ago, Sergius," was the coolly contemptuous reply,
  rendered in the most excellent English. "I daresay you wonder what brings me
  here?"</p>

  <p>"I don't wonder at all. But you won't get it."</p>

  <p>"You have the diamonds here in England."</p>

  <p>"To be perfectly frank, I have. They are in my possession, locked safely
  away at the present moment. You see, I am quite open."</p>

  <p>"It mast be a novel sensation to you. I saw a paragraph in Truth to the
  effect that you had the Azoff diamonds here, also that you are to wear them
  to the Duchess of Grandsire's fancy dress ball on Friday."</p>

  <p>"Correct again. I am going as an Indian Rajah."</p>

  <p>The woman addressed as Marie laughed scornfully.</p>

  <p>"And yet those stones are mine," she said, "as surely as you are my
  cousin. My mother on her death-bed gave those diamonds into your possession,
  and charged you to find me out and hand them over to me."</p>

  <p>"Who told you so?"</p>

  <p>"My old nurse Urza, who was present at the time."</p>

  <p>"Then you accept her word in preference to mine?"</p>

  <p>"Sergius, I would accept the word of the vulgarist guttersnipe before
  yours."</p>

  <p>Prince Sergius's eyes grew lurid. Just for the moment he wished himself
  back in Russia again. But his voice rang steady enough.</p>

  <p>"Listen to me," he said. "You were a Marazoff; you might be a princess
  to-day if your head had not been filled with a lot of rubbish about 'liberty'
  and the like. Then you crowned your folly by running away with a poor English
  author and marrying him. I am right?"</p>

  <p>"Perfectly, and I have never regretted it."</p>

  <p>"Possibly not. You look as serenely beautiful as ever. But your dress,
  pardon me, does not point to affluent or even easy circumstances."</p>

  <p>"We are miserably poor," Marie Lorraine responded calmly. "My husband's
  profession never was a well-paid one. For the last three months he has been
  very ill. I have known the want of a meal. And all I ask now is that you will
  give to me what my mother intended I should have."</p>

  <p>"Diamonds worth at the very least £100,000!"</p>

  <p>"The value has nothing whatever to do with it. You know those jewels are
  mine. They were the personal property of my mother, and if she had not faded
  out of life so suddenly, I should have had them from her own hand."</p>

  <p>"If you can prove the fact, they are yours."</p>

  <p>"But I cannot. Otherwise you would not make the offer. Urza is dead also;
  and even if she were not, her word would weigh little against yours. At the
  present time I have just £27. When that is gone what will become of us heaven
  only knows."</p>

  <p>Sergius crossed the room, and from a travelling bag produced a
  cheque-hook. He slapped it open with an irritating smile upon his face.</p>

  <p>"A woman's conversation is like a woman's letter," he said. "All the gist
  comes in the postscript. Will £500 be enough?"</p>

  <p>Marie Lorraine responded nothing. The Prince filled in a cheque for the
  suggested amount, and passed it over to her. Without the slightest semblance
  of passion Mrs. Lorraine tore the pink slip into minute fragments and puffed
  them contemptuously in the face of her companion.</p>

  <p>"It is not charity I want," she said, "but my own."</p>

  <p>"Meaning the Azoff diamonds of course?"</p>

  <p>"Precisely. Once for all, are you going to continue to act the thief?"</p>

  <p>The wrath of the listener boiled over. The warmth seemed to melt off the
  varnish and the vile stuff beneath stood revealed. An impetuous torrent of
  Russian poured from Marazoff's lips, a stream of brutal blasphemy that caused
  Marie to cover her ears.</p>

  <p>"You coward!" she gasped indignantly. "You shall pay for this."</p>

  <p>Sergius smiled again. The fit of passion had burned away.</p>

  <p>"Don't talk nonsense," he said. "What can ye do to me."</p>

  <p>"I can obtain possession of my own&mdash;and I will."</p>

  <p>"Pshaw! You are full of your husband's romances. Revenge and Nemesis are
  all very well in books. In real life they go for nothing. Far better have
  taken my cheque and gone off as one of those sensible decadent heroines would
  do."</p>

  <p>Marie Lorraine drew her cloak around her.</p>

  <p>"I am going," she said. "Nor am I disappointed at the result of my errand.
  Why I really did come, you will learn later on."</p>

  <p>So saying, the speaker swept down the steps and into the street. In
  Piccadilly a resolute looking young man with a fair moustache accosted
  her.</p>

  <p>"Well, did you satisfy yourself, Mrs. Lorraine?" he asked eagerly.</p>

  <p>"Perfectly," was the reply. "There is no mistake this time. You have the
  key and your friends will be there at the proper time."</p>

  <p>"Oh, that's all right. You can safely leave the stage management of the
  farce to me. All you have to do is to see to the Amsterdam trip."</p>

  <p>"My ticket I have already, and my disguise also, thanks to you. How nice
  it is to have a lot of friends who are actors."</p>

  <p>Whereupon the two laughed, shook hands, and parted.</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p class="first">BY common consent the Duchess of Grandsire's fancy dress
  ball was looked forward to as the most brilliant function of an unusually
  brilliant season. The entertainments at Grandsire House, Grosvenor Square,
  were always on a most elaborate scale, but the present function bid fair to
  surpass them all.</p>

  <p>To say that Royalty would be present would be to use a mere figure of
  speech. A thousand invitations had gone out, and the fortunate ones enjoyed
  to the full the envy and malice of those outside the pale. The mere
  possession of a card was in itself a passport to Belgravia. A thousand lamps
  shone o'er fair women and brave men. It was a fairyland of electric light,
  costly flowers, and gorgeous dresses gathered from the remotest recesses of
  the earth.</p>

  <p>But there is no reason to attempt a description of such a pageant; nothing
  less than the gifted pen of a Morning Post reporter could do it justice. To
  be conspicuous amongst such a notable gathering was a distinction in itself,
  and it was given to few to obtain this cachet. It was universally awarded,
  however, to Prince Sergius Marazoff. His handsome and graceful form was seen
  to advantage in the gorgeous dress of an Eastern potentate, his turban and
  tunic fairly blazed with the famous Azoff diamonds. With the exception of a
  fortunate few American peeresses, Sergius Marazoff presented the greatest
  personal value from the auctioneer's point of view. If envious glances could
  have killed, Prince Sergius that night would have died five hundred deaths
  before as many pairs of gleaming eyes.</p>

  <p>But time and the hour runs through the roughest as well as the smoothest
  day, and the flowers began to droop on the walls of Grandsire House. The
  dusky morn was creeping up from the east as Prince Sergius stood on the
  marble vestibule impatiently waiting for his brougham.</p>

  <p>"Confusion to the fools," he muttered impatiently; "is there a cab to be
  got?"</p>

  <p>A night cab with a driver half-asleep was crawling by at the same moment.
  Into this Prince Sergius stepped, closed the door after a muttered direction,
  and despite his rage fell into a doze.</p>

  <p>He was aroused presently by the stopping of the cab, the throwing open of
  the door, and the glow of a lantern burning like some flaming eye inside. In
  a dreamy kind of way Prince Sergius became aware of the fact that he was in a
  narrow 'cul de sac,' and immediately opposite to a stone building, the
  windows of which were heavily barred with iron. Up a flight of steps was a
  substantial-looking door, beyond which could be seen a whitewashed passage.
  The holder of the lantern was dressed in blue, he had a row of pewter buttons
  on his coat and a helmet on his head. Outside the cab stood another officer
  of the law, similarly attired.</p>

  <p>"What does all this mean?" the Prince demanded, haughtily.</p>

  <p>"Your Highness is at Marlborough-street Police Station," was the gruff
  reply. "I have a warrant for your arrest."</p>

  <p>"A warrant for my arrest? Absurd!"</p>

  <p>"So it may be, your Highness; but I've got my duty to do all the same. You
  will have to get out, if you please."</p>

  <p>Fuming with rage, Prince Sergius complied. At a sign from the sergeant the
  cab drove away, and Marazoff was led up the steps into the station and the
  door clanged behind him. Inside everything was bare but clean. At a desk in a
  kind of office sat an inspector with a big book before him. He bowed
  respectfully to the Prince.</p>

  <p>"I greatly regret to put you to all this trouble," he said. "But my duty
  was to execute the warrant without delay."</p>

  <p>"And having done so," Sergius sneered; "will you be good enough to read
  the charge, and send for my carriage without delay."</p>

  <p>The inspector, politely, but none the less firmly, pointed out the
  impossibility of doing anything of the kind. Then he proceeded to read over
  the warrant received from the Russian police.</p>

  <p>Prince Sergius was startled. Like most men he had had his youthful
  political indiscretions, but he had regarded them as relegated to obscurity
  long ago. And who could have so faithfully and accurately reported these
  peccadilloes to the Government of his own country. And how wise had he been
  to remove as much property as possible from Russian soil.</p>

  <p>"They can't extradite me on that," he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"I am of the same opinion," responded the inspector. "But the legal forms
  will be complied with. You will be brought before the magistrates to-morrow,
  when doubtless an application for bail will be entertained."</p>

  <p>"And meanwhile I am to be imprisoned here?"</p>

  <p>Such appeared to be the case. In vain the haughty Russian stormed and
  raved. There were other indignities yet he had to suffer. All his money and
  papers were taken from him, his jewels and priceless sword, and when these
  were duly scheduled in a big ledger, Sergius had to feign the same as
  correct.</p>

  <p>"They will be perfectly secure in the safe here," said the polite
  inspector. "I am quite distressed to cause you all this bother, but my duty
  would compel me to do the same in the case of a prince of blood."</p>

  <p>With a bitter smile upon his lips and rage and fury in his heart, Sergius
  followed the inspector down a long passage. The latter opened a door with a
  key and displayed a cell with a truckle bed inside.</p>

  <p>"Am I to sleep here?" Sergius gasped.</p>

  <p>"Even so, your Highness," was the reply. "I regret the lack of
  accommodation. But we have so few distinguished prisoners."</p>

  <p>Without another word the Prince threw himself on the hard mattress.
  Somebody should suffer for this he told himself. And then the door clanged
  and the key turned, and all was silence.</p>

  <p>It was an hour later before the Prince slept. When he woke again it was
  broad daylight. The place seemed very still and deserted. After a long time a
  step was heard coming along the flagged corridor, and the door of the cell
  was opened after a long fumbling with the key. And then there appeared no
  blue coated policeman, but the Prince's own secretary, one Murray by
  name.</p>

  <p>"Thank goodness I have found you," said the latter. "I began to imagine
  that you were the victim of some foul play. A letter came to me this morning
  describing your whereabouts and enclosing this key."</p>

  <p>"But I am in Marlborough-street Police Station, Murray."</p>

  <p>"Nothing of the kind, your Highness. This place used to be a house of
  detention, but it has been empty for years. Somebody has got into the place,
  and made use of it with the intention of robbing you. Are your
  jewels&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You are right, Murray. Of course that warrant was all a sham. Quick,
  follow me to the office. The jewels were placed in the safe there."</p>

  <p>But, alas, those priceless diamonds were in the safe no longer. The safe
  was merely a deal cupboard, a 'property' affair. Inside was all Prince
  Sergius's papers, his watch, money, and sword intact, but the diamonds were
  gone.</p>

  <p>In the next half-hour it was vividly impressed upon Murray that he had
  fully earned his last quarter's salary. Fortunately, he had brought with him
  a change of clothing for his employer.</p>

  <p>"To Scotland Yard, quick," Sergius muttered, the veins standing out on his
  forehead like whipcord. "We'll have the miscreants yet."</p><br>

  <p style="text-align:center">* * * * *</p>

  <p>But even a Russian prince can't have all that he wants. Scotland Yard did
  take the matter up, but nothing came of it, for the simple reason that,
  Russian like, Prince Sergius kept his suspicions of Marie Lorraine to
  himself. To implicate her would have been to cause an inquiry into the whole
  question, and perhaps the loss of the jewels in any case. And thus it came
  about that before the week was out the diamonds had been altered beyond all
  recognition, and disposed of in the great jewel mart at Amsterdam. Marie had
  been as good as her word, she had got her own again. And as to the police and
  inspector and the cabman, they had all apparently vanished into thin air.</p>

  <p>There is one literary man in London with a beautiful wife who seems to
  thrive on letters amazingly, and that is Charles Lorraine. He frequently
  complains of being hard up for the plot of a story, but he is not the least
  likely ever to make public the true solution of the mystery of the Azoff
  diamonds.</p><br>

     name="story8">8.&mdash;THE PURPLE TERROR</a></h2>

  <h3>Published in <i>The Strand Magazine</i>, Sep 1898</h3>

  <h3>§ I</h3>

  <p class="first">LIEUTENANT Will Scarlett's instructions were devoid of
  problems, physical or otherwise. To convey a letter from Captain Driver of
  the Yankee Doodle, in Porto Rico Bay, to Admiral Lake on the other side of
  the isthmus, was an apparently simple matter.</p>

  <p>"All you have to do," the captain remarked, "is to take three or four men
  with you in case of accidents, cross the isthmus on foot, and simply give
  this letter into the hands of Admiral Lake. By so doing we shall save at
  least four days, and the aborigines are presumedly friendly."</p>

  <p>The aborigines aforesaid were Cuban insurgents. Little or no strife had
  taken place along the neck lying between Porto Rico and the north bay where
  Lake's flagship lay, though the belt was known to be given over to the
  disaffected Cubans.</p>

  <p>"It is a matter of fifty miles through practically unexplored country,"
  Scarlett replied; "and there's a good deal of the family quarrel in this
  business, sir. If the Spaniards hate us, the Cubans are not exactly enamoured
  of our flag."</p>

  <p>Captain Driver roundly denounced the whole pack of them.</p>

  <p>"Treacherous thieves to a man," he said. "I don't suppose your progress
  will have any brass bands and floral arches to it. And they tell me the
  forest is pretty thick. But you'll get there all the same. There is the
  letter, and you can start as soon as you like."</p>

  <p>"I may pick my own men, sir?"</p>

  <p>"My dear fellow, take whom you please. Take the mastiff, if you like."</p>

  <p>"I'd like the mastiff," Scarlett replied; "as he is practically my own, I
  thought you would not object."</p>

  <p>Will Scarlett began to glow as the prospect of adventure stimulated his
  imagination. He was rather a good specimen of West Point naval dandyism. He
  had brains at the back of his smartness, and his geological and botanical
  knowledge were going to prove of considerable service to a grateful country
  when said grateful country should have passed beyond the rudimentary stages
  of colonization. And there was some disposition to envy Scarlett on the part
  of others floating for the past month on the liquid prison of the sapphire
  sea.</p>

  <p>A warrant officer, Tarrer by name, plus two A.B.'s of thews and sinews, to
  say nothing of the dog, completed the exploring party. By the time that the
  sun kissed the tip of the feathery hills they had covered some six miles of
  their journey. From the first Scarlett had been struck by the absolute
  absence of the desolation and horror of civil strife. Evidently the fiery
  cross had not been carried here; huts and houses were intact; the villagers
  stood under sloping eaves, and regarded the Americans with a certain sullen
  curiosity.</p>

  <p>"We'd better stop for the night here," said Scarlett.</p>

  <p>They had come at length to a village that boasted some pretensions. An
  adobe chapel at one end of the straggling street was faced by a wine-house at
  the other. A padre, with hands folded over a bulbous, greasy gabardine, bowed
  gravely to Scarlett's salutation. The latter had what Tarrer called
  "considerable Spanish."</p>

  <p>"We seek quarters for the night," said Scarlett. "Of course, we are
  prepared to pay for them."</p>

  <p>The sleepy padre nodded towards the wine-house.</p>

  <p>"You will find fair accommodation there," he said. "We are friends of the
  Americanos."</p>

  <p>Scarlett doubted the fact, and passed on with florid thanks. So far,
  little signs of friendliness had been encountered on the march. Coldness,
  suspicion, a suggestion of fear, but no friendliness to be embarrassing.</p>

  <p>The keeper of the wine-shop had his doubts. He feared his poor
  accommodation for guests so distinguished. A score or more of picturesque,
  cut-throat-looking rascals with cigarettes in their mouths lounged sullenly
  in the bar. The display of a brace of gold dollars enlarged mine host's
  opinion of his household capacity.</p>

  <p>"I will do my best, senors," he said. "Come this way."</p>

  <p>So it came to pass that an hour after twilight Tarrer and Scarlett were
  seated in the open amongst the oleanders and the trailing gleam of the
  fire-flies, discussing cigars of average merit and a native wine that was not
  without virtues. The long bar of the wine-house was brilliantly illuminated;
  from within came shouts of laughter mingled with the ting, tang of the guitar
  and the rollicking clack of the castanets.</p>

  <p>"They seem to be happy in there," Tarrer remarked. "It isn't all daggers
  and ball in this distressful country."</p>

  <p>A certain curiosity came over Scarlett.</p>

  <p>"It is the duty of a good officer," he said, "to lose no opportunity of
  acquiring useful information. Let us join the giddy throng, Tarrer."</p>

  <p>Tarrer expressed himself with enthusiasm in favour of any amusement that
  might be going. A month's idleness on shipboard increases the appetite for
  that kind of thing wonderfully. The long bar was comfortable, and filled with
  Cubans who took absolutely no notice of the intruders. Their eyes were turned
  towards a rude stage at the far end of the bar, whereon a girl was gyrating
  in a dance with a celerity and grace that caused the wreath of flowers around
  her shoulders to resemble a trembling zone of purple flame.</p>

  <p>"A wonderfully pretty girl and a wonderfully pretty dance," Scarlett
  murmured, when the motions ceased and the girl leapt gracefully to the
  ground. "Largesse, I expect. I thought so. Well, I'm good for a
  quarter."</p><br>

  <p><a id="pic1"
     name="pic1"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1300911h-images/ThePurpleTerror1.jpg"
         title="The girl came forward, extending a shell prettily.">
  </div>

  <p class="caption">The girl came forward, extending a shell prettily</p><br>

  <p>The girl came forward, extending a shell prettily. She curtsied before
  Scarlett and fixed her dark, liquid eyes on his. As he smiled and dropped his
  quarter-dollar into the shell a coquettish gleam came into the velvety eyes.
  An ominous growl came from the lips of a bearded ruffian close by.</p>

  <p>"Othello's jealous," said Tarrer. "Look at his face."</p>

  <p>"I am better employed," Scarlett laughed. "That was a graceful dance,
  pretty one. I hope you are going to give us another one
  presently&mdash;-"</p>

  <p>Scarlett paused suddenly. His eyes had fallen on the purple band of
  flowers the girl had twined round her shoulder. Scarlett was an enthusiastic
  botanist; he knew most of the gems in Flora's crown, but he had never looked
  upon such a vivid wealth of blossom before.</p>

  <p>The flowers were orchids, and orchids of a kind unknown to collectors
  anywhere. On this point Scarlett felt certain. And yet this part of the world
  was by no means a difficult one to explore in comparison with New Guinea and
  Sumatra, where the rarer varieties had their homes.</p>

  <p>The blooms were immensely large, far larger than any flower of the kind
  known to Europe or America, of a deep pure purple, with a blood-red centre.
  As Scarlett gazed upon them he noticed a certain cruel expression on the
  flower. Most orchids have a kind of face of their own; the purple blooms had
  a positive expression of ferocity and cunning. They exhumed, too, a queer,
  sickly fragrance. Scarlett had smelt something like it before, after the
  Battle of Manila. The perfume was the perfume of a corpse.</p>

  <p>"And yet they are magnificent flowers," said Scarlett. "Won't you tell me
  where you got them from, pretty one?"</p>

  <p>The girl was evidently flattered by the attention bestowed upon her by the
  smart young American. The bearded Othello alluded to edged up to her
  side.</p>

  <p>"The senor had best leave the girl alone," he said, insolently.</p>

  <p>Scarlett's fist clenched as he measured the Cuban with his eyes. The
  Admiral's letter crackled in his breast-pocket, and discretion got the best
  of valour.</p>

  <p>"You are paying yourself a poor compliment, my good fellow," he said,
  "though I certainly admire your good taste. Those flowers interested me."</p>

  <p>The man appeared to be mollified. His features corrugated in a smile.</p>

  <p>"The senor would like some of those blooms?" he asked. "It was I who
  procured them for little Zara here. I can show you where they grow."</p>

  <p>Every eye in the room was turned in Scarlett's direction. It seemed to him
  that a kind of diabolical malice glistened on every dark face there, save
  that of the girl, whose features paled under her healthy tan.</p>

  <p>"If the senor is wise," she began, "he will not&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Listen to the tales of a silly girl," Othello put in, menacingly. He
  grasped the girl by the arm, and she winced in positive pain. "Pshaw, there
  is no harm where the flowers grow, if one is only careful. I will take you
  there, and I will be your guide to Port Anna, where you are going, for a gold
  dollar."</p>

  <p>All Scarlett's scientific enthusiasm was aroused. It is not given to every
  man to present a new orchid to the horticultural world. And this one would
  dwarf the finest plant hitherto discovered.</p>

  <p>"Done with you," he said; "we start at daybreak. I shall look to you to be
  ready. Your name is Tito? Well, good-night, Tito."</p>

  <p>As Scarlett and Tarrer withdrew the girl suddenly darted forward. A wild
  word or two fluttered from her lips. Then there was a sound as of a blow,
  followed by a little stifled cry of pain.</p>

  <p>"No, no," Tarrer urged, as Scarlett half turned. "Better not. They are ten
  to one, and they are no friends of ours. It never pays to interfere in these
  family quarrels. I daresay, if you interfered, the girl would be just as
  ready to knife you as her jealous lover."</p>

  <p>"But a blow like that, Tarrer!"</p>

  <p>"It's a pity, but I don't see how we can help it. Your business is the
  quick dispatch of the Admiral's letter, not the squiring of dames."</p>

  <p>Scarlett owned with a sigh that Tarrer was right.</p>

  <h3>§ II</h3>

  <p class="first">IT WAS quite a different Tito who presented himself at
  daybreak the following morning. His insolent manner had disappeared. He was
  cheerful, alert, and he had a manner full of the most winning politeness.</p>

  <p>"You quite understand what we want," Scarlett said. "My desire is to reach
  Port Anna as soon as possible. You know the way?"</p>

  <p>"Every inch of it, senor. I have made the journey scores of times. And I
  shall have the felicity of getting you there early on the third day from
  now."</p>

  <p>"Is it so far as that?"</p>

  <p>"The distance is not great, senor. It is the passage through the woods.
  There are parts where no white man has been before."</p>

  <p>"And you will not forget the purple orchids?"</p>

  <p>A queer gleam trembled like summer lightning in Tito's eyes. The next
  instant it had gone. A time was to come when Scarlett was to recall that
  look, but for the moment it was allowed to pass.</p>

  <p>"The senor shall see the purple orchid," he said; "thousands of them. They
  have a bad name amongst our people, but that is nonsense. They grow in the
  high trees, and their blossoms cling to long, green tendrils. These tendrils
  are poisonous to the flesh, and great care should be taken in handling them.
  And the flowers are quite harmless, though we call them the devil's
  poppies."</p>

  <p>To all of this Scarlett listened eagerly. He was all-impatient to see and
  handle the mysterious flower for himself. The whole excursion was going to
  prove a wonderful piece of luck. At the same time he had to curb his
  impatience. There would be no chance of seeing the purple orchid to-day.</p>

  <p>For hours they fought their way along through the dense tangle. A heat
  seemed to lie over all the land like a curse&mdash;a blistering sweltering,
  moist heat with no puff of wind to temper its breathlessness. By the time
  that the sun was sliding down, most of the party had had enough of it.</p>

  <p>They passed out of the underwood at length, and, striking upwards,
  approached a clump of huge forest trees on the brow of a ridge. All kinds of
  parasites hung from the branches; there were ropes and bands of green, and
  high up a fringe of purple glory that caused Scarlett's pulses to leap a
  little faster.</p>

  <p>"Surely that is the purple orchid?" he cried.</p>

  <p>Tito shrugged his shoulders contemptuously.</p>

  <p>"A mere straggler or two," he said, "and out of reach in any case. The
  senor will have all he wants and more to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"But it seems to me," said Scarlett, "that I could&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Then he paused. The sun like a great glowing shield was shining full
  behind the tree with its crown of purple, and showing up every green rope and
  thread clinging to the branches with the clearness of liquid crystal.
  Scarlett saw a network of green cords like a huge spider's web, and in the
  centre of it was not a fly, but a human skeleton!</p><br>

  <p><a id="pic2"
     name="pic2"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1300911h-images/ThePurpleTerror2.jpg"
         title="In the centre of it was a human skeleton">
  </div>

  <p class="caption">In the centre of it was not a fly, but a human
  skeleton!</p><br>

  <p>The arms and legs were stretched apart as if the victim had been
  crucified. The wrists and ankles were bound in the cruel web. Fragments of
  tattered clothing fluttered in the faint breath of the evening breeze.</p>

  <p>"Horrible," Scarlett cried, "absolutely horrible!"</p>

  <p>"You may well say that," Tarrer exclaimed, with a shudder. "Like the fly
  in the amber or the apple in the dumpling, the mystery is how he got
  there."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps Tito can explain the mystery," Scarlett suggested.</p>

  <p>Tito appeared to be uneasy and disturbed. He looked furtively from one to
  the other of his employers as a culprit might who feels he has been found
  out. But his courage returned as he noted the absence of suspicion in the
  faces turned upon him.</p>

  <p>"I can explain," he exclaimed, with teeth that chattered from some unknown
  terror or guilt. "It is not the first time that I have seen the skeleton.
  Some plant-hunter doubtless who came here alone. He climbed into the tree
  without a knife, and those green ropes got twisted round his limbs, as a
  swimmer gets entangled in the weeds. The more he struggled, the more the
  cords bound him. He would call in vain for anyone to assist him here. And so
  he must have died."</p>

  <p>The explanation was a plausible one, but by no means detracted from the
  horror of the discovery. For some time the party pushed their way on in the
  twilight, till the darkness descended suddenly like a curtain.</p>

  <p>"We will camp here," Tito said; "it is high, dry ground, and we have this
  belt of trees above us. There is no better place than this for miles around.
  In the valley the miasma is dangerous."</p>

  <p>As Tito spoke he struck a match, and soon a torch flamed up. The little
  party were on a small plateau, fringed by trees. The ground was dry and hard,
  and, as Scarlett and his party saw to their astonishment, littered with
  bones. There were skulls of animals and skulls of human beings, the skeletons
  of birds, the frames of beasts both great and small. It was a weird,
  shuddering sight.</p>

  <p>"We can't possibly stay here," Scarlett exclaimed.</p>

  <p>Tito shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"There is nowhere else," he replied. "Down in the valley there are many
  dangers. Further in the woods are the snakes and jaguars. Bones are nothing.
  Peuf, they can be easily cleared away."</p>

  <p>They had to be cleared away, and there was an end of the matter. For the
  most part the skeletons were white and dry as air and sun could make them.
  Over the dry, calcined mass the huge fringe of trees nodded mournfully. With
  the rest, Scarlett was busy scattering the mocking frames aside. A perfect
  human skeleton lay at his feet. On one finger something glittered&mdash;a
  signet ring. As Scarlett took it in his hand he started.</p>

  <p>"I know this ring!" he exclaimed; "it belonged to Pierre Anton, perhaps
  the most skilled and intrepid plant-hunter the Jardin des Plantes ever
  employed. The poor fellow was by way of being a friend of mine. He met the
  fate that he always anticipated."</p>

  <p>"There must have been a rare holocaust here," said Tarrer.</p>

  <p><a id="pic3"
     name="pic3"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1300911h-images/ThePurpleTerror3.jpg"
         title="There must have been a rare holocaust here.">
  </div>

  <p class="caption">"A rare holocaust"</p><br>

  <p>"It beats me," Scarlett responded. By this time a large circle had been
  shifted clear of human and other remains. By the light of the fire loathsome
  insects could be seen scudding and straddling away. "It beats me entirely.
  Tito, can you offer any explanation? If the bones were all human I could get
  some grip of the problem. But when one comes to birds and animals as well! Do
  you see that the skeletons lie in a perfect circle, starting from the centre
  of the clump of trees above us? What does it mean?"</p>

  <p>Tito professed utter ignorance of the subject. Some years before a small
  tribe of natives invaded the peninsula for religious rites. They came from a
  long way off in canoes, and wild stories were told concerning them. They
  burnt sacrifices, no doubt.</p>

  <p>Scarlett turned his back contemptuously on this transparent tale. His
  curiosity was aroused. There must be some explanation, for Pierre Anton had
  been seen of men within the last ten years.</p>

  <p>"There's something uncanny about this," he said, to Tarrer. "I mean to get
  to the bottom of it, or know why."</p>

  <p>"As for me," said Tarrer, with a cavernous yawn, "I have but one ambition,
  and that is my supper, followed by my bed."</p>

  <p class="first">SCARLETT lay in the light of the fire looking about him. He
  felt restless and uneasy, though he would have found it difficult to explain
  the reason. For one thing, the air trembled to strange noises. There seemed
  to be something moving, writhing in the forest trees above his head. More
  than once it seemed to his distorted fancy that he could see a squirming knot
  of green snakes in motion.</p>

  <p>Outside the circle, in a grotto of bones, Tito lay sleeping. A few moments
  before his dark, sleek head had been furtively raised, and his eyes seemed to
  gleam in the flickering firelight with malignant cunning. As he met
  Scarlett's glance he gave a deprecatory gesture and subsided.</p>

  <p>"What the deuce does it all mean?" Scarlett muttered. "I feel certain
  yonder rascal is up to some mischief. Jealous still because I paid his girl a
  little attention. But he can't do us any real harm. Quiet, there!"</p>

  <p>The big mastiff growled and then whined uneasily. Even the dog seemed to
  be conscious of some unseen danger. He lay down again, cowed by the stern
  command, but he still whimpered in his dreams.</p>

  <p>"I fancy I'll keep awake for a spell," Scarlett told himself.</p>

  <p>For a time he did so. Presently he began to slide away into the land of
  poppies. He was walking amongst a garden of bones which bore masses of purple
  blossoms. Then Pierre Anton came on the scene, pale and resolute as Scarlett
  had always known him; then the big mastiff seemed in some way to be mixed up
  with the phantasm of the dream, barking as if in pain, and Scarlett came to
  his senses.</p>

  <p>He was breathing short, a beady perspiration stood on his forehead, his
  heart hammered in quick thuds&mdash;all the horrors of nightmare were still
  upon him. In a vague way as yet he heard the mastiff howl, a real howl of
  real terror, and Scarlett knew that he was awake.</p>

  <p>Then a strange thing happened. In the none too certain light of the fire,
  Scarlett saw the mastiff snatched up by some invisible hand, carried far on
  high towards the trees, and finally flung to the earth with a crash. The big
  dog lay still as a log.</p>

  <p>A sense of fear born of the knowledge of impotence came over Scarlett;
  what in the name of evil did it all mean? The smart scientist had no faith in
  the occult, and yet what did it all mean?</p>

  <p>Nobody stirred. Scarlett's companions were soaked and soddened with
  fatigue; the rolling thunder of artillery would have scarce disturbed them.
  With teeth set and limbs that trembled, Scarlett crawled over to the dog.</p>

  <p>The great, black-muzzled creature was quite dead. The full chest was
  stained and soaked in blood; the throat had been cut apparently with some
  jagged, saw-like instrument, away to the bone. And, strangest thing of all,
  scattered all about the body was a score or more of the great purple orchid
  flowers broken off close to the head. A hot, pricking sensation travelled
  slowly up Scarlett's spine and seemed to pass out at the tip of his skull. He
  felt his hair rising.</p>

  <p>He was frightened. As a matter of honest fact, he had never been so
  horribly scared in his life before. The whole thing was so mysterious, so
  cruel, so bloodthirsty.</p>

  <p>Still, there must be some rational explanation. In some way the matter had
  to do with the purple orchid. The flower had an evil reputation. Was it not
  known to these Cubans as the devil's poppy?</p>

  <p>Scarlett recollected vividly now Zara's white, scared face when Tito had
  volunteered to show the way to the resplendent bloom; he remembered the cry
  of the girl and the blow that followed. He could see it all now. The girl had
  meant to warn him against some nameless horror to which Tito was leading the
  small party. This was the jealous Cuban's revenge.</p>

  <p>A wild desire to pay this debt to the uttermost fraction filled Scarlett,
  and shook him with a trembling passion. He crept along in the drenching dew
  to where Tito lay, and touched his forehead with the chill blue rim of a
  revolver barrel. Tito stirred slightly.</p>

  <p>"You dog!" Scarlett cried. "I am going to shoot you."</p>

  <p>Tito did not move again. His breathing was soft and regular. Beyond a
  doubt the man was sleeping peacefully. After all he might be innocent; and
  yet, on the other hand, he might be so sure of his quarry that he could
  afford to slumber without anxiety as to his vengeance.</p>

  <p>In favour of the latter theory was the fact that the Cuban lay beyond the
  limit of what had previously been the circle of dry bones. It was just
  possible that there was no danger outside that pale. In that case it would be
  easy to arouse the rest, and so save them from the horrible death which had
  befallen the mastiff. No doubt these were a form of upas tree, but that would
  not account for the ghastly spectacle in mid-air.</p>

  <p>"I'll let this chap sleep for the present," Scarlett muttered.</p>

  <p>He crawled back, not without misgivings, into the ring of death. He meant
  to wake the others and then wait for further developments. By now his senses
  were more alert and vigorous than they had ever been before. A preternatural
  clearness of brain and vision possessed him. As he advanced he saw suddenly
  falling a green bunch of cord that straightened into a long, emerald line. It
  was triangular in shape, fine at the apex, and furnished with hooked spines.
  The rope appeared to dangle from the tree overhead; the broad, sucker-like
  termination was evidently soaking up moisture.</p>

  <p>A natural phenomenon evidently, Scarlett thought. This was some plant new
  to him, a parasite living amongst the tree-tops and drawing life and vigour
  by means of these green, rope-like antennae designed by Nature to soak and
  absorb the heavy dews of night.</p>

  <p>For a moment the logic of this theory was soothing to Scarlett's
  distracted nerves, but only for a moment, for then he saw at regular
  intervals along the green rope the big purple blossoms of the devil's
  poppy.</p>

  <p>He stood gasping there, utterly taken aback for the moment. There must be
  some infernal juggling behind all this business. He saw the rope slacken and
  quiver, he saw it swing forward like a pendulum, and the next minute it had
  passed across the shoulders of a sleeping seaman.</p>

  <p>Then the green root became as the arm of an octopus. The line shook from
  end to end like the web of an angry spider when invaded by a wasp. It seemed
  to grip the sailor and tighten, and then, before Scarlett's, afrighted eyes,
  the sleeping man was raised gently from the ground.</p>

  </div>

  <p class="caption">The sleeping man was raised gently from the
  ground.</p><br>

  <p>Scarlett jumped forward with a desire to scream hysterically. Now that a
  comrade was in danger he was no longer afraid. He whipped a jack-knife from
  his pocket and slashed at the cruel cord. He half expected to meet with the
  stoutness of a steel strand, but to his surprise the feeler snapped like a
  carrot, bumping the sailor heavily on the ground.</p>

  <p>He sat up, rubbing his eyes vigorously.</p>

  <p>"That you, sir?" he asked. "What is the matter?"</p>

  <p>"For the love of God, get up at once and help me to arouse the others,"
  Scarlett said, hoarsely. "We have come across the devil's workshop. All the
  horrors of the inferno are invented here."</p>

  <p>The bluejacket struggled to his feet. As he did so, the clothing from his
  waist downwards slipped about his feet, clean cut through by the teeth of the
  green parasite. All around the body of the sailor blood oozed from a zone of
  teeth-marks.</p>

  <p>Two-o'clock-in-the-morning courage is a virtue vouchsafed to few. The tar,
  who would have faced an ironclad cheerfully, fairly shivered with fright and
  dismay.</p>

  <p>"What does it mean, sir?" he cried. "I've been&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Wake the others," Scarlett screamed; "wake the others."</p>

  <p>Two or three more green tangles of rope came tumbling to the ground,
  straightening and quivering instantly. The purple blossoms stood out like a
  frill upon them. Like a madman, Scarlett shouted, kicking his companions
  without mercy.</p>

  <p>They were all awake at last, grumbling and moaning for their lost
  slumbers. All this time Tito had never stirred.</p>

  <p>"I don't understand it at all," said Tarrer.</p>

  <p>"Come from under those trees," said Scarlett, "and I will endeavour to
  explain. Not that you will believe me for a moment. No man can be expected to
  believe the awful nightmare I am going to tell you."</p>

  <p>Scarlett proceeded to explain. As he expected, his story was followed with
  marked incredulity, save by the wounded sailor, who had strong evidence to
  stimulate his otherwise defective imagination.</p>

  <p>"I can't believe it," Tarrer said, at length. They were whispering
  together beyond earshot of Tito, whom they had no desire to arouse for
  obvious reasons. "This is some diabolical juggling of yonder rascally Cuban.
  It seems impossible that those slender green cords could&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Scarlett pointed to the centre of the circle.</p>

  <p>"Call the dog," he said grimly, "and see if he will come."</p>

  <p>"I admit the point as far as the poor old mastiff is concerned. But at the
  same time I don't&mdash;however, I'll see for myself."</p>

  <p>By this time a dozen or more of the slender cords were hanging pendent
  from the trees. They moved from spot to spot as if jerked up by some unseen
  hand and deposited a foot or two farther. With the great purple bloom
  fringing the stem, the effect was not unlovely save to Scarlett, who could
  see only the dark side of it. As Tarrer spoke he advanced in the direction of
  the trees.</p>

  <p>"What are you going to do?" Scarlett asked.</p>

  <p>"Exactly what I told you. I am going to investigate this business for
  myself."</p>

  <p>Without wasting further words Scarlett sprang forward. It was no time for
  the niceties of an effete civilization. Force was the only logical argument
  to be used in a case like this, and Scarlett was the more powerful man of the
  two.</p>

  <p>Tarrer saw and appreciated the situation.</p>

  <p>"No, no," he cried; "none of that. Anyway, you're too late."</p>

  <p>He darted forward and threaded his way between the slender emerald
  columns. As they moved slowly and with a certain stately deliberation there
  was no great danger to an alert and vigorous individual. As Scarlett entered
  the avenue he could hear the soak and suck as the dew was absorbed.</p>

  <p>"For Heaven's sake, come out of it," he cried.</p>

  <p>The warning came too late. A whip-like trail of green touched Tarrer from
  behind, and in a lightning flash he was in the toils. The tendency to draw up
  anything and everything gave the cords a terrible power. Tarrer evidently
  felt it, for his breath came in great gasps.</p>

  <p>"Cut me free," he said, hoarsely; "cut me free. I am being carried off my
  feet."</p>

  <p>He seemed to be doomed for a moment, for all the cords there were
  apparently converging in his direction. This, as a matter of fact, was a
  solution of the whole sickening, horrible sensation. Pulled here and there,
  thrust in one direction and another, Tarrer contrived to keep his feet.</p>

  <p>Heedless of possible danger to himself Scarlett darted forward, calling to
  his companions to come to the rescue. In less time than it takes to tell,
  four knives were at work ripping and slashing in all directions.</p>

  <p><a id="pic5"

         title="Four knives were at work...">
  </div>

  <p class="caption">Four knives were at work<br>
  ripping and slashing in all directions</p><br>

  <p>"Not all of you," Scarlett whispered. So tense was the situation that no
  voice was raised above a murmur. "You two keep your eyes open for fresh
  cords, and cut them as they fall, instantly. Now then."</p>

  <p>The horrible green spines were round Tarrer's body like snakes. His face
  was white, his breath came painfully, for the pressure was terrible. It
  seemed to Scarlett to be one horrible dissolving view of green, slimy cords
  and great weltering, purple blossoms. The whole of the circle was strewn with
  them. They were wet and slimy underfoot.</p>

  <p>Tarrer had fallen forward half unconscious. He was supported now by but
  two cords above his head. The cruel pressure had been relieved. With one
  savage sweep of his knife Scarlett cut the last of the lines, and Tarrer fell
  like a log unconscious to the ground. A feeling of nausea, a yellow
  dizziness, came over Scarlett as he staggered beyond the dread circle. He saw
  Tarrer carried to a place of safety, and then the world seemed to wither and
  leave him in the dark.</p>

  <p>"I feel a bit groggy and weak," said Tarrer an hour or so later: "but
  beyond that this idiot of a Richard is himself again. So far as I am
  concerned, I should like to get even with our friend Tito for this."</p>

  <p>"Something with boiling oil in it," Scarlett suggested, grimly. "The
  callous scoundrel has slept soundly through the whole of this business. I
  suppose he felt absolutely certain that he had finished with us."</p>

  <p>"Upon my word, we ought to shoot the beggar!" Tarrer exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"I have a little plan of my own," said Scarlett, "which I am going to put
  in force later on. Meanwhile we had better get on with breakfast. When Tito
  wakes a pleasant little surprise will await him."</p>

  <p>Tito roused from his slumbers in due course and looked around him. His
  glance was curious, disappointed, then full of a white and yellow fear. A
  thousand conflicting emotions streamed across his dark face. Scarlett read
  them at a glance as he called the Cuban over to him.</p>

  <p>"I am not going into any unnecessary details with you," he said. "It has
  come to my knowledge that you are playing traitor to us. Therefore we prefer
  to complete our journey alone. We can easily find the way now."</p>

  <p>"The senor may do as he pleases," he replied. "Give me my dollar and let
  me go."</p>

  <p>Scarlett replied grimly that he had no intention of doing anything of the
  kind. He did not propose to place the lives of himself and his comrades in
  the power of a rascally Cuban who had played false.</p>

  <p>"We are going to leave you here till we return," he said. "You will have
  plenty of food, you will be perfectly safe under the shelter of these trees,
  and there is no chance of anybody disturbing you. We are going to tie you up
  to one of these trees for the next four-and-twenty hours."</p>

  <p>All the insolence died out of Tito's face. His knees bowed, a cold dew
  came out over the ghastly green of his features. From the shaking of his
  limbs he might have fared disastrously with ague.</p>

  <p>"The trees," he stammered, "the trees, senor! There is danger from snakes,
  and&mdash;and from many things. There are other places&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"If this place was safe last night it is safe to-day," Scarlett said,
  grimly. "I have quite made up my mind."</p>

  <p>Tito fought no longer. He fell forward on his knees, he howled for mercy,
  till Scarlett fairly kicked him up again.</p>

  <p><a id="pic6"
     name="pic6"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1300911h-images/ThePurpleTerror6.jpg"
         title="He howled for mercy...">
  </div>

  <p class="caption">He howled for mercy...</p><br>

  <p>"Make a clean breast of it," he said, "or take the consequences. You know
  perfectly well that we have found you out, scoundrel."</p>

  <p>Tito's story came in gasps. He wanted to get rid of the Americans. He was
  jealous. Besides, under the Americanos would Cuba be any better off? By no
  means and assuredly not. Therefore it was the duty of every good Cuban to
  destroy the Americanos where possible.</p>

  <p>"A nice lot to fight for," Scarlett muttered. "Get to the point."</p>

  <p>Hastened to the point by a liberal application of stout shoe-leather, Tito
  made plenary confession. The senor himself had suggested death by medium of
  the devil's poppies. More than one predatory plant-hunter had been lured to
  his destruction in the same way. The skeleton hung on the tree was a Dutchman
  who had walked into the clutch of the purple terror innocently. And Pierre
  Anton had done the same. The suckers of the devil's poppy only came down at
  night to gather moisture; in the day they were coiled up like a spring. And
  anything that they touched they killed. Tito had watched more than one bird
  or small beast crushed and mauled by these cruel spines with their fringe of
  purple blossoms.</p>

  <p>"How do you get the blooms?" Scarlett asked.</p>

  <p>"That is easy," Tito replied. "In the daytime I moisten the ground under
  the trees. Then the suckers unfold, drawn by the water. Once the suckers
  unfold one cuts several of them off with long knives. There is danger, of
  course, but not if one is careful."</p>

  <p>"I'll not trouble the devil's poppy any further at present," said
  Scarlett, "but I shall trouble you to accompany me to my destination as a
  prisoner."</p>

  <p>Tito's eyes dilated.</p>

  <p>"They will not shoot me?" he asked, hoarsely.</p>

  <p>"I don't know," Scarlett replied. "They may hang you instead. At any rate,
  I shall be bitterly disappointed if they don't end you one way or the other.
  Whichever operation it is, I can look forward to it with perfect
  equanimity."</p><br>

  <h2><a id="story9"
     name="story9">9.&mdash;THE JOINVILLE TUNNEL</a></h2>

  <h3>Published in <i>The Cornhill Magazine</i>, Nov 1898</h3>

  <h3>§ I</h3>

  <p class="first">THE SERGEANT was obdurate. He had his orders, which were as
  Holy Writ in his eyes. They were cold grey eyes in a face hammered hard on
  the anvil of officialism. There were more important things than Red Cross
  stores.</p>

  <p>"Your stores cannot proceed by this train, Major," said the Bavarian.</p>

  <p>The whole of the cases consigned to Versailles lay piled up on one another
  on the narrow platform of St. Quentin station. It was all the more annoying
  because the horses and wagons had been sent on by Eustace to a point some
  thirty miles further along the line to Paris, and he had been promised a fair
  conveyance to Joinville by the general commanding the Prussian forces in the
  district.</p>

  <p>But General Deganfeld was not available at present. It was many miles over
  the frozen country to his base. A strong French force under General de la
  Jonge had pushed forward from Arras, and their advent was keeping Deganfeld's
  hands full. There were rumours that a smaller force of Frenchmen had forced
  the lines behind Joinville, and had thus obtained command of the railway line
  beyond the famous tunnel.</p>

  <p>But of this the Bavarian sergeant professed to know nothing. A train load
  of provisions strongly guarded had left for Joinville two hours ago. The
  sergeant was inclined to flout the idea that this same had fallen into the
  hands of the enemy.</p>

  <p>Another train would pass through shortly. This Eustace and Huddlestone had
  hoped to make use of. They could only sit on their cases now and bemoan their
  ill fortune. Scattered over the good-sheds beyond the station, a company of
  Bavarian Infantry held the line. If there were officers, they did not show
  themselves.</p>

  <p>"Nothing of the Chesterfield about these fellows," Huddlestone grumbled.
  "What on earth shall we do now?"</p>

  <p>Eustace was at a loss for a reply. Sad as it may seem, the Red Cross
  carried suspicion in its train. Doubtless the sacred cause had been abused by
  spies and others; indeed, the history of the war testifies to the fact. There
  was the ghost of a grin on the sergeant's face as he clanked away. Eustace
  looked along the blackness of the Orloy woods rising to the crest of the hill
  under which the great tunnel of Joinville bored its way.</p>

  <p>"Hang me if I know," he said. "We must leave the stores here and get them
  to pass us on to Joinville. Then we can send the wagons back&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Something came like the hum of a home-flying bee between the two men, and
  thudded into a wooden sentry box behind them. Along the dark belt of the
  bending woods a score of smoke jets puffed. Crack, crack, came the
  bullets.</p>

  <p>Then a bugle rang out, and from the goods-sheds the Bavarians poured forth
  like angry grey wasps. Hardly had they formed into line before a cloud of
  Francs-tireurs broke from under cover and dashed down upon the station. They
  were as two to one to the Germans.</p>

  <p>A raking volley barely served to check their headlong progress. They shot
  through the thin Bavarian line as if it had been so much brown paper. Then,
  as the Francs-tireurs came hurling down on the left flank of the doomed
  Bavarians, Eustace saw the big sergeant borne down and his skull shattered by
  the sweeping glance of a sword. Then the Bavarians broke like sheen, and ran
  for the upper spur of the woods, pursued by the victorious horse men.</p>

  <p>It was a mere affair of minutes. The affray was barely over before a heavy
  train came puffing into the station. In less time than it takes to tell,
  every German aboard, to the number of two score, were prisoners.</p>

  <p>"That was well done." said a gay voice as the French cavalry officer in
  command strode up. "Deganfeld has had the feather drawn over his eye this
  time. What have we here?"</p>

  <p>The speaker saluted Eustace and his comrade politely. Huddlestone
  explained.</p>

  <p>"Surely you are Captain Armand?" he concluded. "I recollect meeting you
  after the fall of Metz."</p>

  <p>"Ah, yes. Pardon that I did not recognise Captain Huddlestone. I owe you
  one good turn, which fortune has enabled me to return. Your stores shall go
  on to Joinville, and I will accompany them. Indeed, I have strong reasons for
  getting to Joinville myself. I may say that we only hold the line on
  sufferance. Deganfeld is closer up than those Bavarians imagine. There are
  four trains at Martay yonder bringing up supports for the German force beyond
  Joinville, and the first of these trains may follow on at any moment. So you
  see I am really between the devil and the deep sea. Still, if I can only get
  to Joinville&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Would it not be better to lose no further time?" Eustace suggested. "We
  have the train here all ready to proceed. With the assistance of your men we
  could get our stores aboard in a few minutes."</p>

  <p>Armand agreed. Anxious and worried as he was, nothing appeared to deprive
  him of his gay manner. It was more than possible that on emerging from the
  far side of Joinville tunnel he would find himself and his company of
  infantry prisoners. What had happened beyond the hills nobody knew. And
  Armand had his own urgent reasons for a flying visit there.</p>

  <p>Acting upon the instructions of their captain, the troop of cavalry
  deployed again under the cover of the wood. By this time the stores were
  aboard the train, together with the handful of infantry that Armand had at
  his command. Eustace felt his spirits rising.</p>

  <p>"What a slice of luck for us," he said, gleefully. "Personally, it doesn't
  matter a scrap to us what happens when we are on the other side of the
  tunnel. Once there, it is no far cry to our wagons."</p>

  <p>"Wish we were out of it all the same," Huddlestone muttered. "Tunnels in
  war time are best avoided. And there are four miles of this one."</p>

  <p>Armand swaggered up gaily. The adventure had found him in spirits.</p>

  <p>"May I ask what your object is?" said Eustace.</p>

  <p>"Who knows?" responded the volatile captain. "Joinville is my destination.
  Mayhap we shall steam into the hands of the Germans. If you had been waiting,
  waiting as I have been&mdash;driven from pillar to post&mdash;you would
  understand my thirst for action."</p>

  <p>"Meanwhile a train load of German troops may be up to us at any moment,"
  said Huddlestone. "This is a mere coup de maine of yours."</p>

  <p>Armand responded serenely that such was the fact. Even as he spoke the
  shrill note of a distant whistle cleft the frosty air. The railway was a
  winding one, and as the crow flies the approaching train was not distant more
  than a mile&mdash;twice that distance as the track went. A thin jet of steam
  trailed along the valley.</p>

  <p>"We must go on," Armand cried. "There are troops coming, I hear. All
  aboard there. We shall have a race for it yet. Laden down as we are, the
  other train will have the pull of us."</p>

  <p>A moment later, and the engine was jolting forward. Armand had spoken
  truly. His little strategy could not remain successful for long, added to
  which his knowledge told him that the approaching train was laden with German
  troops. But it was a race between a passenger and a goods train. Doubtless by
  this time one of the Bavarian fugitives had explained matters.</p>

  <p>Full speed ahead was the order of the day. Despite his gay air and
  careless smile, Armand gazed from time to time behind him. There were the
  most urgent reasons why he should reach Joinville without delay.</p>

  <p>"They are gaining on us," he cried.</p>

  <p>The Englishmen responded nothing. The truth was painfully apparent. And
  the jolt and rattle of the heavy goods trucks rendered conversation a
  difficulty. So far as Eustace and his colleagues were concerned, the ultimate
  issue mattered little, as long as they eventually cleared the tunnel.</p>

  <p>But this was anything but a certainty. A mile or more of line level as a
  billiard table and straight as a gunbarrel lay before them, ending in the
  small circular bore that meant the entrance to the tunnel. And by the time
  Armand and his party were half way to this, he could see behind them the
  buffers of the approaching engine.</p>

  <p>"A stern chase is a long chase,'" said Eustace.</p>

  <p>Armand smiled grimly. Gone was his butterfly manner; no longer did he
  cherish his moustache. There were enough soldiers on the approaching train to
  cut his little force to pieces ten times over.</p>

  <p>"They will be up to us before we are through," said Huddlestone.</p>

  <p>"You are fond of sport," Armand cut in swiftly. "You bet a little, of
  course&mdash;all Englishmen do. Then I will bet you what you call six to four
  if that yonder engine never catches us at all."</p>

  <p>"You can't prevent it," said Eustace.</p>

  <p>By way of reply Armand scrambled to the front of the truck where the three
  were standing. He gave a quick, crisp command to the engine driver, and the
  train immediately commenced to slacken speed. When finally it came to a
  standstill, its whole length was secreted in the blackness of the tunnel,
  like a worm underground.</p>

  <p>"Are you mad?" Eustace cried. "Man alive, in three minutes that other
  train will be on to us. To destroy them is very well, but why allow us to
  perish?"</p>

  <p>"Enough," Armand responded curtly, "I know my business. You will see what
  you shall see. Uncouple the last three trucks there."</p>

  <p>The situation looked desperate enough for anything. There was any odds on
  a fight between the two trains, with the balance faintly in favour of the
  Germans. To bring this matter to an issue in the black suffocation of a
  tunnel was horrible.</p>

  <p>The train stood fast inside the grim, smoky tunnel. Already, some eight
  hundred yards away, the pursuing engine forged steadily onward. Eustace would
  have interfered had he dared. In a wondering sort of way he watched a handful
  of sappers uncoupling the last three trucks, he felt the jolt and jerk as the
  locomotive slowly moved on, and then he saw a pair of rails with their
  sleepers wrenched away, leaving an ugly hole in the track.</p>

  <p>"Now do you understand?" Armand whispered, fiercely.</p>

  <p>Eustace held his breath in the excitement of the moment. He could
  distinctly hear the thud, thud of the coming train. Then its whistle shrieked
  hideously, there was a resounding crash as the two solid masses met, and in
  less time than it takes to tell the mouth of the tunnel was packed, jammed
  with hundreds of tons of wood and steel. There was a scream of escaping
  steam, the thud of an explosion, a few yells and groans, and all was still.
  Armand had left behind him a rampart welded into a solid mass like liquid
  iron is forged under a hammer. Many an hour would necessarily elapse before
  the way would be cleared again.</p>

  <p>"This is horrible!" Huddlestone cried.</p>

  <p>"It may not be war, perhaps," Armand said coolly; "but you will admit that
  this is no time for the exchange of social amenities. But for my little
  stratagem you would have been a long time getting your stores to
  Joinville."</p>

  <p>The train was jolting and pounding forward again. For some minutes nobody
  spoke. The Englishmen were peering somewhat anxiously ahead. Away down the
  line Eustace could see two lights travelling.</p>

  <p>"Surely there is something on the track," he cried. "The
  driver&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But the driver was already aware of the fact. Armand shortly demanded of
  him what was wrong.</p>

  <p>"A train backing along the tunnel," came the startling reply, "and on the
  same line of rails as ourselves. Mon Dieu, it&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The rest of the speech was drowned in the shrill whistle of the
  engine.</p>

  <h3>§ II</h3>

  <p class="first">FOR a brief space something like consternation reigned
  supreme. The peculiar horror of the situation struck home with full force.
  Armand had been hoist with his own petard: he had fallen headlong into the
  trap he had laid for another.</p>

  <p>"I don't understand it at all," he muttered.</p>

  <p>"I do," said Huddlestone grimly. "Less than an hour before you made your
  successful raid just now, a German train passed through. Without doubt she
  has been headed off by a force of your men, and has risked everything, to the
  extent of running back on her tracks, for assistance."</p>

  <p>Armand nodded moodily. The explanation seemed reasonable; indeed it was
  the only one possible under the circumstances.</p>

  <p>"We shall have to fight her," said the Frenchman, "since retreat is out of
  the question. There are troops aboard, of course?"</p>

  <p>"Not more than a score," Huddlestone replied. "Their goods are mainly camp
  stores for the garrison occupying Fort Bazan."</p>

  <p>"Ah! Then our task is lighter than I anticipated," said Armand.</p>

  <p>All this was a mere matter of moments. Already the lights on the
  approaching engine were growing more steady, plain proof of the fact that the
  other train was coming to a standstill. When, finally, the two trains pulled
  up, not more than five yards separated them.</p>

  <p>"Back there," a guttural German voice smote out into the smoky darkness.
  "You cannot get through. A force of French infantry with two guns holds the
  valley below Joinville."</p>

  <p>"That is good hearing, indeed," Armand cried in the same language. "Learn
  that we too are French, and that we have not the same objection to
  proceeding. You oblige us by showing the way."</p>

  <p>The German officer in charge of the other train wasted no time in idle
  questions. He knew enough of the game of war to be surprised at nothing. A
  response came in the shape of a score of bullets fired haphazard in the thick
  darkness. Nothing loth, the French replied. For some minutes the desultory
  and useless war of small arms continued. Ever and anon a bullet would thud
  into a case or the side of a truck&mdash;it would tinkle against the masonry
  of the tunnel. But, on the whole, the fusilade was absolutely futile.</p>

  <p>Still, the situation was thrilling enough in all conscience. To retreat
  was out of the question; to proceed, for the present at any rate, was equally
  impossible. Add to the inky darkness of the tunnel, its horror solely
  illuminated by the sudden flash of the rifles, and an atmosphere of burnt
  paper and smoke that tasted acrid on the tongue, and stung the eyes and nose
  like needles.</p>

  <p>Standing behind the shelter of a big packing case, Eustace and Huddlestone
  took no part in the affray. What the end of this alarming adventure would be
  it was impossible to say. And as the moments passed the atmosphere grew thick
  and oppressive. Eustace was conscious of an unusual moisture on his
  forehead.</p>

  <p>"This is stifling," he said. "I can hardly breathe."</p>

  <p>"Same here," gasped Huddlestone. "My nose is dripping with blood."</p>

  <p>Gradually the firing slackened and died sullenly away. Perhaps the utter
  uselessness of it appealed to both sets of combatants simultaneously.
  Doubtless they, too, were fearsome of the deadly poisonous atmosphere. More
  or less, the meaning of this was a mystery. The tunnel contained two lines of
  rails, the roof was fairly high, and generally a strong current of air passed
  through.</p>

  <p>But not now. The seal of wood and iron brought about by Armand's ingenuity
  at the far end of the tunnel had prevented the free ingress of pure air, and
  the dense volumes of acrid smoke had done the rest.</p>

  <p>Armand fairly sobbed and struggled for his breath. He fought his way over
  to the cab of the engine, and in a hoarse whisper asked for a piece of cotton
  waste. This he proceeded to soak in the oil from the stoker's can. Then he
  placed the mass upon the boiler and applied a light.</p>

  <p>A flaring yellow flame flashed out. Within its ring of radiance could be
  seen the engines and leading trucks of both trains. On the fore part of
  either the troops had gathered. Numerically, the proportion was greatly on
  the side of the French.</p>

  <p>"Rush them," Armand cried, "rush them whilst the flare lasts."</p>

  <p>Like rats, the nimble little Gauls leapt on the metals. A few shots at
  short range were exchanged, in the midst of which the yellow light suddenly
  died away. By the time Armand had replenished it, his men were cheering
  hoarsely in possession of the German train. A dead body or two lay on the
  track; from a truck here and there came the gurgle and groan of the
  wounded.</p>

  <p>"This is worse than murder," said the stripling officer in charge of the
  German train. "There is reason in all things, Captain. Pray command me.
  Circumstances place me entirely at your service."</p>

  <p>"You will recollect that you brought this entirely upon yourself," Armand
  replied dryly. "Meanwhile, we may pay too highly for the time wasted in the
  interchange of politeness. We shall be asphyxiated. Pray precede us, so that
  we may get out of this without delay."</p>

  <p>No time was lost in getting under way again. The mere motions of the
  trains fanned up a slight breeze, which, languid as it was, came sweetly and
  soothingly to breasts literally bursting for the want of it. Armand's spirits
  rose, a soft whistle escaped his lips.</p>

  <p>"Eh, bien," he said, "but this is something to remember, something to tell
  one's friends in after life and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Be received with polite incredulity," said Huddlestone. "This is
  literally the hottest place I have ever been in. The air is better, but not
  much less stifling than it was before. Captain, I trust your friends have not
  been trying on a little amateur sapping of their own at the other end of this
  confounded tunnel."</p>

  <p>The melodious lilt faded suddenly from Armand's lips. "I don't quite
  understand you," he said.</p>

  <p>"Don't you," said Huddlestone. "Supposing your friends towards Joinville
  are not particularly strong in numbers. They appear to be masters of the
  situation for the time being, but their position would be immensely
  strengthened by possession of the railway. And how would they proceed to make
  sure of the railway? Why, by blowing up the mouth of the tunnel directly they
  had driven back the train."</p>

  <p>"Then you mean to suggest&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"That the thing is un fait accompli. I feel certain that what I say is
  correct, and that we are literally sealed up here like sardines in a tin.
  Otherwise, the atmosphere would not be so insufferably close. You see the
  gravity of the situation?"</p>

  <p>Armand shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"It is not lost upon me," he said. "Fortunately, the suspense will not be
  unduly prolonged. We shall soon know."</p>

  <p>Both trains were moving slowly on. Calculating by moments, the cars should
  not have been remote from the exit over against Joinville. And yet, hanging
  anxiously over the side, the two Englishmen could discern nothing beyond the
  purple, shot darkness.</p>

  <p>There was no circular focus of light, no welcome rays penetrating the exit
  from the tunnel. Either some calamity had happened, or they were the victims
  of a cruel misfortune.</p>

  <p>"The exit is assuredly blocked up," Eustace muttered.</p>

  <p>Armand's reply was unheard. The pilot train, forging slowly ahead, bumped
  and clattered, the trucks came thudding together along its entire length, and
  then suddenly came to a standstill.</p>

  <p>"For heaven's sake shut off steam there, or you will be into us," came a
  harsh voice from the pioneers. "There is something on the line."</p>

  <p>The second train also came to its brakes. Armand hastened to the scene of
  the trouble. The young German in charge of the other transport was already
  examining his surroundings with the aid of a lantern.</p>

  <p>"What has happened?" Armand asked, anxiously.</p>

  <p>"The whole line is strewn with masonry," was the reply. "Look for
  yourself, and see if it is not so, Monsieur le Capitaine."</p>

  <p>Armand took the lantern which the other proffered, and flashed its sickly
  yellow rays upwards. Not only was the line strewn with masses of rock and
  earth and twisted brickwork, but the serried mass rose upward till roof and
  floor came together. Huddlestone had guessed it. Both exits from the tunnel
  had been destroyed.</p>

  <p>"A most amazing thing," Armand cried. "A marvellous coincidence."</p>

  <p>The young German smiled somewhat grimly.</p>

  <p>"I guessed this," he said, "though I had no need to tell you. It becomes
  necessary to go back in the direction of Orloy."</p>

  <p>"Into the hands of your countrymen, who have doubtless regained the lost
  ground there," Armand said, dryly. "My friend, to prevent accidents I
  contrived to seal up the entrance of this tunnel after my train entered."</p>

  <p>"Then we are caught like rats in a pipe."</p>

  <p>"So it seems. But can you inform me how my brilliant scheme came to be so
  speedily pirated as this?"</p>

  <p>"That is merely conjecture," the youthful German replied. "I only know
  that my train was headed back by troops two miles this side of Joinville.
  They were in force, and I feared derailment. For the time, at any rate, the
  valley seemed to have fallen into your hands. The enemy bore me back into the
  tunnel, and that is all I know. The position is anything but a pleasing
  one."</p>

  <p>Armand agreed sullenly. He understood perfectly what had happened. A body
  of troops had made a dash for Joinville, and they had destroyed a portion of
  the tunnel, with a view of checking any advance on the part of General
  Deganfeld. By an amazing chance both exits had gone simultaneously.</p>

  <p>Apparently there was nothing to be done but sit down and endure it. Sooner
  or later the Bavarian advance from Marlay must result in communications being
  opened up again. But Deganfeld was by no means over strong, and a large
  French force&mdash;the force Armand was so anxious to touch&mdash;hovered
  menacingly in the country about Joinville.</p>

  <p>Under these circumstances, many days might elapse before the tunnel was
  cleared. That Deganfeld would make desperate efforts to do so was certain.
  That the French would do their best to prevent him was inevitable. To force
  the obstacle from within, aided by a mere handful of men without tools was
  practically impossible.</p>

  <p>"And we are without stores," said Armand. "We might hold out for a couple
  of days. Major, your cases are&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Not mine," Eustace said, hurriedly. "Besides, we cannot get much
  nourishment out of surgical appliances. In any case we shall perish miserably
  ere long for want of air. The atmosphere is insufferable."</p>

  <p>Eustace spoke truly. The air was hot and heavy, a sense of languor and
  fatigue lay upon every man there. As yet, they hardly realised the full
  extent of the danger. Unless relief came speedily, a horrible death lay
  before them. The black darkness was in itself a terror.</p>

  <p>"Something must be done," Armand said, hoarsely. "Come, is there not one
  of you that can suggest anything?"</p>

  <p>The young German officer touched Armand's elbow.</p>

  <p>"There is one desperate chance," he said. "If you follow me, I will show
  you the way."</p>

  <p>"Lead on," said Armand. "Nothing can be more desperate than this."</p>

  <h3>§ III</h3>

  <p class="first">LANTERN in hand, the German plunged forward. He was followed
  by Armand, together with the Englishmen. No word was spoken on either side,
  the journey being undertaken in grim silence. At some distance from the
  trains and the troops the air was a little less vitiated, and oppressed lungs
  drew breath more freely. At the end of a mile the guide paused.</p>

  <p>"Do you notice anything?" he asked.</p>

  <p>They all had, almost at the same moment. They noticed a purer, cooler air,
  like champagne to their jaded senses.</p>

  <p>"And there seems to be an absolute draught," said Huddlestone.</p>

  <p>"Hardly that," said the German. "It has gone again. Half a dozen men might
  manage to exist here for a time, but no more."</p>

  <p>"I can't understand whence comes the air," said Armand.</p>

  <p>"It seems to me that we Germans know your country better than you know it
  yourselves," said the other, with a dryness that brought the blood to
  Armand's cheek. "But that is by the way. As a matter of fact, we are exactly
  under the ventilating shaft of the tunnel. It passes through the hill, rising
  to a round tower of stone beyond&mdash;a capital landmark."</p>

  <p>"You are right," Armand cried, eagerly. "I remember now."</p>

  <p>"Very good, Captain. I saw that we had one desperate chance, and that is a
  fact. It may be just possible for us to climb up the shaft and seek
  assistance. There is no other way."</p>

  <p>Armand was eager for the attempt, and the Englishmen were nothing loth to
  follow. The German proceeded, lantern in hand.</p>

  <p>"How did you learn this?" Armand asked.</p>

  <p>"We left nothing to chance," was the reply. "Do you suppose an important
  detail like this would be overlooked?"</p>

  <p>"Never mind that," Armand growled. "How do you propose to ascend?"</p>

  <p>By way of reply, the German flashed his lantern along the slimy walls of
  the tunnel. Presently he found what he wanted&mdash;a square wooden trap,
  which he proceeded to pull away from the wall. This done, a hole barely large
  enough for a man to squeeze into was disclosed.</p>

  <p>"More charming than it seems," the German explained. "The semi-circular
  pipe leads on to the roof of the tunnel. There is an iron grating above us,
  if you will take the trouble to look."</p>

  <p>Sure enough, as the Lantern's rays flashed on the roof, a rusty, sooty
  grating came in the line of the light. Like a cat, the German wriggled
  himself into the hole, pushing his lantern before him, the others
  following.</p>

  <p>It was a dusty, dingy, horrible, choky business, resulting in hands and
  faces being smothered in soot and cinders, but it was accomplished at last.
  When, finally, the four adventurers stood on the grating, they could see the
  brilliant shield of the blue sky far above them as a cerulean circle clear
  cut by the funnel, and they could breathe again.</p>

  <p>The pure frosty air ran like quicksilver along Armand's veins. "It is good
  to live, after all," he cried. "Still, there is much to be done. Herr
  Lieutenant, how do you propose to reach the summit?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing easier," said the other. "The way is provided, sir." A flight of
  iron ladders led upwards. It was a long and tedious business, for the shaft
  was many hundreds of feet through the heart of the hill, and the ladders were
  of iron and absolutely perpendicular.</p>

  <p>The intense cold struck, even down there. Each of the adventurers could
  feel the chill grip of the metal as it struck through their gloves. As they
  toiled up, foot by foot, the pace gradually slackened. It was fortunate,
  perhaps, that darkness reigned supreme, and thus veiled the real danger of
  the undertaking.</p>

  <p>"I'm glad I can't see anything," Huddlestone panted. "Looking down from a
  height always makes me confoundedly giddy. And we must be up&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't think of it," Eustace replied. "I'm trying not to, and I never was
  in such a blue funk in all my life. Sebastopol was nothing to this."</p>

  <p>All things come to an end, and the weary climb was over at last. When the
  four reached the top of the shaft a brief terror awaited them. Over the
  entire surface a network of iron completed the semblance of a cage.</p>

  <p>"Good heavens!" Huddlestone groaned. "Have we come all this way to be
  baffled like this? How maddening!"</p>

  <p>Armand swore volubly. Then annoyance took the place of anger, as the
  German reached up and lifted the centre of the grill. The latter seemed to
  know perfectly well that the grill possessed a swinging doorway.</p>

  <p>"It is the way we have beaten you all along," he said. "We know
  everything, you know nothing&mdash;except how to fight."</p>

  <p>Armand turned away bitterly mortified. The truth stung like a whiplash.
  Ere he could think of a suitable reply, the boom of a gun, followed by the
  quick rattle of musketry fire, smote on the air. Evidently, sharp work was in
  progress down in the valley towards Joinville.</p>

  <p>A risky jump of some fifteen feet, on to snow frozen as hard as granite,
  made a fitting termination to the hazardous side of the adventure. The
  volatile Armand burst out laughing as he surveyed his companions.</p>

  <p>"Did one ever see four such disreputable scarecrows?" he cried. "Still, we
  can afford to smile at our misfortunes now. Forward, mes amis."</p>

  <p>A brisk run of some twenty minutes brought the quartette on the scene of
  action. A miniature pitched battle between a Prussian regiment, hurried up by
  General Deganfeld and a cloud of Francs-tireurs was in full blast. Armand ran
  forward to an eminence, and waved aloft his handkerchief, which he had tied
  to his sword. The German lieutenant followed his example.</p>

  <p>At the unexpected spectacle of a French and Prussian officer standing
  amicably side by sire, and waving miniature flags of truce, the firing
  ceased. Then, by mutual consent, Armand and the German respectively returned
  to their own lines. A few minutes later, and a hurried conference between the
  leaders of both forces had taken place.</p>

  <p>The scene which followed was not the least strange incident of that
  marvellous campaign. Amongst the wreckage at the mouth of the tunnel,
  hundreds of French and German troops worked side by side. From either set of
  rails their respective officers watched them in silence. Up the slopes the
  arms were piled.</p>

  <p>At the end of two hours the way was practically clear. A rousing cheer
  went up as the last block of brickwork was rolled aside, and then there
  staggered from the tunnel four score of men, grim and pallid, and gasping in
  the pure air of the afternoon. There was nothing for it now but to bring out
  the trains, which was done accordingly.</p>

  <p>"Whom do they belong to?" asked the German leader.</p>

  <p>"The problem is not yet solved, Colonel," responded the French commander.
  "Let them form part of the stake we were playing for when we were so
  strangely interrupted two hours ago."</p>

  <p>The German saluted grimly. He desired nothing better. Within two minutes
  of this polite interchange of courtesies, the roar of conflict had
  recommenced. From a snug vantage ground, Eustace and Huddlestone watched the
  progress of the fray. They saw the tide of victory ebb and flow, they saw the
  Germans gradually beaten back and retire sullenly to the cover of the woods.
  Then, a little time later, Armand came up with a gay smile upon his face.</p>

  <p>"Ah," he cried, "we have to be grateful for small mercies in these dark
  days. Your sympathy was with us, I am sure."</p>

  <p>"You," said Eustace. "I was thinking of my stores, you know."</p>

  <p>"Quite so. Then you are fortunate, for these two trains are going right
  through to Joinville at once. We are well out of the adventure, my
  friends."</p>

  <p>And Eustace heartily concurred.</p><br>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p class="first">THE sound of a banjo badly played carried on the river air.
  It was just possible to glean the fact that the unseen musician had desires
  in the direction of 'Tommy Atkins.' The audience consisted of two people in a
  boat&mdash;a man and a woman.</p>

  <p>"Fred, what does it all mean?" said the latter.</p>

  <p>"It means," returned the man grimly, "that we are unexpectedly returning
  to the house-boat a full hour before our time. It means that the servants are
  entertaining company, Ella."</p>

  <p>Fred Galton swished the dinghy along under the side of the houseboat
  Diana, and assisted his wife to gain the deck. Then he strode along to the
  liliputian kitchen, and threw the door open wide.</p>

  <p>"I should like to know what all this means," he demanded.</p>

  <p>Neither of the four listeners responded to the conundrum. Two of the party
  were black-gowned and smartly cuffed and collared. The soiree was completed
  by two gentlemen in scarlet.</p>

  <p>"If you please, sir," Cook commenced, defiantly falsetto, "we did not
  think you were coming back for some time."</p>

  <p>"I believe that," Galton interrupted, grimly. "Turn these two blackguards
  out at once, and put those supper things away. How dare you take my banjo
  from the cabin. Your mistress will settle with you presently."</p>

  <p>"Very well, sir," Cook responded, with a strained politeness that would
  have alarmed a more seasoned householder than Galton. "I daresay me and Hemly
  will know what to do, sir."</p>

  <p>The two sons of Mars sneaked out of the kitchen and over the side into the
  boat awaiting them. Then they splashed off in the darkness, cursing each
  other with mutual heartiness.</p>

  <p>"You'd better go and see those girls," Galton remarked to his wife. "Put
  your foot down, Ella, and don't stand any nonsense."</p>

  <p>Galton swung into the cabin and lighted a cigarette. For the first time
  during his tenancy of the 'Diana' he felt a little disenchanted. When Jones,
  his rich stockbroker friend, had offered him the loan of the boat for a
  couple of months he had accepted almost with rapture. A life like that on the
  broad bosom of the river in leafy June and languid July was an ideal one for
  a novelist just making his way to the front. There was another reason also
  why the offer was accepted with alacrity. There is no exchequer that
  fluctuates more than that of the average literary man, and a 'slump' in
  letters had brought Galton to a sense of the folly of living up to the top of
  his income.</p>

  <p>Therefore the pretty little house at Crouch End had been let furnished for
  a time, and cook and Emily transferred to the Diana. There were scores of
  other house-boats close by, and many attractions chez Pangbourne, which
  accounted for the backsliding of the domestics and the feasting of Her
  Majesty's soldiery. Galton began to wish himself well out of it.</p>

  <p>"If I and Beck come to terms," he muttered, "I'll chuck this. I'm getting
  tired of sleeping with my feet in the river and my head in the bookcase."</p>

  <p>A great deal depended upon this 'if.' Galton had begun to realise the
  uncertainty of ephemeral literature, and to look out for something in the way
  of an editorship, where he could have a good fixed income and plenty of time
  to write besides. And when fortune threw Jossa J. Beck across his path hope
  beat high.</p>

  <p>Mr. Beck was an American millionaire with a taste for literature. A man of
  culture and education, he had settled down in England, where he had purchased
  a big newspaper or two plus a trio of magazines, over which he was delighted
  to lose no more than 500 a month. Certes, no journals were better served or
  'got up' than his. Beck was a queer, cranky kind of man, whose plentiful milk
  of human kindness was soured by the polluting stream of chronic dyspepsia,
  but where he took, Beck was a friend indeed.</p>

  <p>Galton had great hopes in this quarter. Beck had told him personally that
  the editorship of the 'British Monthly' would soon be vacant, and
  incidentally that Simes, the present man, got 800 a year. Galton asked boldly
  for the appointment. But Beck could promise nothing. "I'll see," he
  responded, playing, as he did incessantly, with the big intaglio ring on his
  little finger. "No time wasted. Ain't you at Pangbourne? On the 'Diana?' Tell
  you what, I'll come there and lunch with you on Friday, and we will try and
  fix up things."</p>

  <p>Needless to say, Galton jumped at the suggestion. A few hours from the
  present moment and he would know his fate. To-morrow was the pregnant Friday.
  He forgot all about Ella and the recreant domestics in the dwarf kitchen. The
  dainty little luncheon, the mayonnaise, the chicken cutlets, the pomard and
  salad, were all gathered for the coming of the lion from the west. Then Ella
  swept in. Her pretty face was pale, something like a tear dimmed her blue
  eye. Napoleon had lost her domestic Waterloo.</p>

  <p>"Well?" Galton asked impatiently.</p>

  <p>"It is anything but well," Ella replied with the calmness of despair.
  "They were both extremely insolent, and I had to be quite firm. The
  consequence is that they are both going the first thing in the morning."</p>

  <p>Galton groaned. Many husbands would have promptly laid the blame upon the
  wife; but the glamour of the honeymoon was still upon them both.</p>

  <p>"And Beck is coming," Galton concluded. "What shall we do? Can you get
  anybody else? To put him off would be a most successful form of suicide."</p>

  <p>"I quite see that, dear; and as to getting servants here within a week of
  Henley the thing is utterly impossible."</p>

  <p>"Don't you think," Galton suggested, meekly, "that you might ask the
  girls&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No, I don't," Ella said crisply, "especially after the way they spoke to
  me. If you'd been there you would have sent them away now."</p>

  <p>Galton advanced no further in that direction. He had a poor idea of using
  other people at the sacrifice of personal pride. There was only one thing to
  do under the circumstances and that he did&mdash;he laughed. Ella smiled
  also. She had a pretty sense of humour and a sweet audacity which was by no
  means the least of her charms.</p>

  <p>"Fred," she said presently, "does Mr. Beck know you are married?"</p>

  <p>"Upon my word I can't say. Why?"</p>

  <p>"Because I have a plan. The more I think it over the easier it seems. And
  it would be a great deal off my mind. You won't say no?"</p>

  <p>"My dearest girl, I won't say no to any way out of the difficulty. Once we
  get to-morrow over I don't care. If necessary, we could do the work of the
  boat ourselves. And if Beck turns out trumps, why we shall have to give up
  the 'Diana' in any case."</p>

  <p>"Then make your mind easy," Ella laughed. "Everything shall go as merrily
  as the proverbial marriage bell."</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p class="first">BY slow degrees the cabin of the 'Diana' had been reduced to
  order. True, breakfast had not been exactly a function, neither did Galton's
  ideas of dusting tally with the views on that important task held by
  Ella.</p>

  <p>"You're as black as a tinker," said the man of letters.</p>

  <p>"I shall be blacker still," Ella responded, cheerfully, "before I have
  finished. If you will get out of my way I shall be so glad."</p>

  <p>By the time Galton had consumed three cigarettes on the roof, the table in
  the cabin had been laid and decked with flowers. The luncheon had been spread
  out, and very nice and dainty it looked, Galton thought.</p>

  <p>"No show or ostentation," he said, "and yet quite sufficient. If only we
  had a decent parlour-maid, the thing would be complete. But I say!"</p>

  <p>"What is the matter now?"</p>

  <p>"Why, you have only laid covers for two."</p>

  <p>"Quite right. Don't ask any foolish questions. And now I am going to
  dress. Come down here again when I call you."</p>

  <p>Half-an-hour passed before the summons came.</p>

  <p>As Galton passed into the cabin, his eyes dilated with astonishment.
  Before him stood Ella, but no longer the idol of his dreams. The golden
  glossy hair had been pushed back under a snowy cap, the long strings of which
  dangled behind. Round Ella's throat was a deep white collar, her wrists were
  surrounded by turned-back cuffs. As to her dress, it was black, both rigid
  and plain. A daintier, more graceful little parlour-maid never handed round a
  dish. The half-bold, half-fearsome look in her eyes made the charm
  complete.</p>

  <p>"How did you manage it?" Galton gasped.</p>

  <p>"Petty larceny." Ella laughed. "I opened the box left by Emily till called
  for, and took the liberty of borrowing these things. You're not angry,
  Fred?"</p>

  <p>"I couldn't be if I were to try," Galton responded. "Mind you, I don't
  like it. But when a girl shows pluck like that&mdash;and you look so deuced
  pretty, you know."</p>

  <p>"Silly boy! You have knocked my cap all on one side. Now get away to
  Pangbourne and meet your tame millionaire, or you will be late. Nervous!
  Really, nothing to speak of."</p>

  <p>Wherein Ella prevaricated; which was excusable under the circumstances. In
  due course Mr. Beck emerged from a first-class carriage at Pangbourne, and
  received a respectful greeting from his host. The man who can meet a
  millionaire on terms of equality has yet to be discovered. The lean shambling
  figure lounged along by Galton's side. Beck was less melancholy than usual,
  and Galton had tact enough not to mention business. They reached the
  house-boat at length, and a few cigarettes were consumed on the roof ere came
  the welcome announcement of luncheon.</p>

  <p>Ella waited deftly and noiselessly. She managed to exchange a word or two
  with Galton when the plutocrat was washing his hands in the lavatory.
  Fortunately for Ella's peace of mind the visitor did not appear to notice her
  at all. Like most of his countrymen he had a good and rabid appetite, and at
  the end of the repast he was fain to confess that he had lunched well.</p>

  <p>"One gets so tired of these big feeds," he said, lighting a cigar costing
  something like half-a-crown per inch. "Upon my word, Galton, you're better
  off than I am."</p>

  <p>"If I could persuade my creditors the same thing," Galton said, dryly, "it
  would be a source of mutual happiness."</p>

  <p>"Money does not mean happiness," Beck remarked, sententiously.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps not; but you can have precious little fun without it. I don't
  suppose you would like to live upon 400 a year, earned fitfully as I do."</p>

  <p>"Well, it don't amount to a pile, and that's a fact. A smart fellow like
  you ought to do a great deal better than that."</p>

  <p>"I dare say I ought to, but I don't."</p>

  <p>"And that's why you require an editorship?"</p>

  <p>"Precisely. A regular income relieves one from a deal of anxiety, and that
  means better work. It's all very well for fools to talk about the spur of
  adversity, but what's the use of spurring a laden horse?"</p>

  <p>Beck nodded. This kind of philosophy was after his own heart.</p>

  <p>"I have been making a good many inquiries about ye," he said, "and ye seem
  to be just the man I want. Simes isn't. He's groovy and intolerant of new
  ideas. I'm not going to promise anything definite yet. In the course of a few
  weeks you shall hear from me."</p>

  <p>Galton smiled as pleasantly as possible. All the same, he didn't like it.
  Also he knew that Simes was leaving Beck almost immediately. And he had
  counted upon this appointment more than he knew. Then Beck took up the thread
  of conversation again.</p>

  <p>"I daresay you have often heard me spoken of as a peculiar man," he said.
  "Well, I am. People in my position see a good deal of the sordid side of
  life, and we could form a 'corner' in human nature if necessary. If I figure
  a man up and like him, I'm his friend till he passes the tape, you bet. For
  all I say it, perhaps, who shouldn't, it's no bad thing for a young man to
  come to me."</p>

  <p>"That is why I am so anxious to come," Galton responded.</p>

  <p>"At 800 a year," Beck said drily. "Now where the deuce&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The speaker paused, and looked helplessly at his right hand. Galton
  noticed that the big intaglio was no longer there.</p>

  <p>"Guess I've lost my ring," Beck said resignedly. "I couldn't have done
  such a thing for a thousand. That ring, sir, belonged to Francis the First of
  France, and was given by him to Victoria Colonna. I knew that it would slip
  off my finger one of these days, and now it has."</p>

  <p>"Then it's on the boat," Galton exclaimed, "because I'm prepared to swear
  that it was on your finger when we were smoking our cigarettes before
  luncheon. I noticed how plainly the head showed up in the sunshine."</p>

  <p>"That's a fact, Mr. Galton?"</p>

  <p>"I'm prepared take my oath to it anywhere."</p>

  <p>Beck considered a moment, and then a shrewd smile crossed his face. He
  looked like a man who was having a joke at his own expense.</p>

  <p>"I guess you are right," he said. "I could tell you the price that
  'Centrals' stood this day twelve months, but for other things I've no memory
  to speak of. I remember now taking the ring off in the lavatory. I expect I
  left it there."</p>

  <p>And Beck stepped away, covering with one stride the yard and a half that
  lay between the cabin and the lavatory. In a moment or two he had returned
  with the information that it was not there. Ella, in the act of removing the
  plates stood to listen.</p>

  <p>"Young woman," Beck demanded, "have you been in there?"</p>

  <p>Ella blushed to the roots of her hair. She had almost forgotten her role,
  and for an instant resented the tone of the speaker.</p>

  <p>"Certainly I have," she retorted. "And I saw no ring there."</p>

  <p>Beck appeared to be by no means satisfied. And his suspicions were
  aroused.</p>

  <p>"I'll make an affidavit I left it there," he declared, "and nobody has
  been in the place but you. Now you look here, young woman, I guess you found
  that ring, and in the press of business forgot all about it."</p>

  <p>"Do you dare to insinuate," Ella cried, "that I have stolen&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Simmer down. We'll leave all that to the police."</p>

  <p>Instances of millionaires being the object of cases of assault and battery
  are happily rare. But no plutocrat ever came so measurably near a sound
  thrashing as Beck stood at that moment.</p>

  <p>"I don't want to do anything unpleasant," he said, "but unless I get my
  intaglio, there's going to be trouble somewhere. Guess I'll fetch the
  police."</p>

  <p>Ella dropped into a chair and promptly burst into tears. Galton laid a
  grip on Beck's arm that promptly checked further action.</p>

  <p>"There's some diabolical mistake here," the author said, hoarsely. "Mr.
  Beck, the girl you take for a servant is my wife."</p>

  <p>With his hands plunged into his waistcoat pockets Beck whistled. As he
  struck this attitude his face grew hot, his air was one of distress and
  shame. For a moment Galton did not see this.</p>

  <p>"Our servants left us in the lurch last night," Galton explained. "We
  could not see our way to put you off. Hence my wife masquerading like this.
  But as to Ella stealing your ring, why I'd as soon accuse you of doing it
  yourself."</p>

  <p>"Well, you'd be quite right to do so," said Beck, with a queer smile, "for
  the blamed thing is in my waistcoat pocket all the time. I've only just
  discovered the fact, and properly ashamed of myself I am. And if the lady
  will forget the gross insult&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't say any more, please," Ella implored.</p>

  <p>"But I must," Beck replied. "I always make it a point to be especially
  polite to those in my employ. And to think that I should have so vilely
  treated the wife of the editor of 'The British Monthly' makes me feel hot all
  over."</p>

  <p>A thrill of joy shot down Galton's spine. The threatened misfortune was a
  veritable blessing in disguise.</p>

  <p>"Do you really mean that, sir?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Really and truly. Never more serious in my life. And if ye are as
  successful in life as ye are in the choice of a wife you'll rise to not only
  magazine editor but owner into the bargain."</p>
