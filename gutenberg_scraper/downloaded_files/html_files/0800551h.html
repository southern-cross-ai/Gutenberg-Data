  <h2><a name="ch01"
     id="ch01"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

  <p class="first">GRANT paused with his foot on the lowest step, and listened
  to the shrieking from the floor above. As well as the shrieks there was a
  dull continuous roar; an elemental sound, like a forest fire or a river in
  spate. As his reluctant legs bore him upwards he arrived at the inevitable
  deduction: the party was being a success.</p>

  <p>He was not going to the party. Literary sherry parties, even distinguished
  ones, were not Grant's cup of tea. He was going to collect Marta Hallard and
  take her out to dinner. Policemen, it is true, do not normally take out to
  dinner leading actresses who gravitate between the Haymarket and the Old Vic;
  not even when the policemen are Detective-Inspectors at Scotland Yard. There
  were three reasons for his privileged position, and Grant was aware of all
  three. In the first place he was a presentable escort, in the second place he
  could afford to dine at Laurent's, and in the third place Marta Hallard did
  not find it easy to obtain escort. For all her standing, and her chic, men
  were a little afraid of Marta. So when Grant, a mere Detective-Sergeant then,
  appeared in her life over a matter of stolen jewellery, she had seen to it
  that he did not entirely fade out of it again. And Grant had been glad to
  stay. If he was useful to Marta as a cavalier when she needed one, she was
  even more useful to him as a window on the world. The more windows on the
  world a policeman has the better he is likely to be at his job, and Marta was
  Grant's 'leper's squint' on the theatre.</p>

  <p>The roar of the party's success came flooding out through the open doors
  on to the landing, and Grant paused to look at the yelling crowd
  asparagus-packed into the long Georgian room and to wonder how he was going
  to pry Marta out of it.</p>

  <p>Just inside the door, baffled apparently by the solid wall of talking and
  drinking humanity, was a young man, looking lost. He still had his hat in his
  hand, and had therefore just arrived.</p>

  <p>'In difficulties?' Grant said, catching his eye.</p>

  <p>'I've forgotten my megaphone,' the young man said.</p>

  <p>He said it in a gentle drawl, not bothering to compete with the crowd. The
  mere difference in pitch made the words more audible than if he had shouted.
  Grant glanced at him again, approvingly. He was a very good-looking young man
  indeed, now that he took notice. Too blond to be entirely English. Norwegian,
  perhaps?</p>

  <p>Or American. There was something in the way he said 'forgotten' that was
  transatlantic.</p>

  <p>The early spring afternoon was already blue against the windows and the
  lamps were lit. Across the haze of cigarette smoke Grant could see Marta at
  the far end of the room listening to Tullis the play-wright telling her about
  his royalties. He did not have to hear what Tullis was talking about to know
  that he was talking about his royalties; that is all Tullis ever talked
  about. Tullis could tell you, off-hand, what the Number Two company of his
  <i>Supper for Three</i> took on Easter Monday in Blackpool in 1938. Marta had
  given up even a pretence of listening, and her mouth drooped at the corners.
  Grant thought that if that D.B.E. did not come along soon Marta would be
  disappointed into the need for a face-lifting. He decided to stay where he
  was until he could catch her eye. They were both tall enough to see over the
  heads of a normal crowd.</p>

  <p>With a policeman's ingrained habit of inspection he let his eye run over
  the crowd between them, but found nothing of interest. It was the usual
  collection. The very prosperous firm of Ross and Cromarty were celebrating
  the publication of Lavinia Fitch's twenty-first book, and since it was
  largely due to Lavinia that the firm was prosperous the drinks were plentiful
  and the guests were distinguished. Distinguished in the sense of being
  well-dressed and well-known, that is to say. The distinguished in achievement
  did not celebrate the birth of <i>Maureen's Lover</i>, nor drink the sherry
  of Messrs Ross and Cromarty. Even Marta, that inevitable Dame, was here
  because she was a neighbour of Lavinia's in the country. And Marta, bless her
  black-and-white chic and her disgruntled look, was the nearest thing to real
  distinction in the room.</p>

  <p>Unless, of course, this young man whom he did not know brought more than
  good looks to the party. He wondered what the stranger did for a living. An
  actor? But an actor would not stand baffled at the edge of a crowd. And there
  was something in the implied comment of his remark about the megaphone, in
  the detachment with which he was watching the scene, that divorced him from
  his surroundings. Was it possible, Grant wondered, that those cheekbones were
  being wasted in a stockbroker's office? Or was it perhaps that the soft light
  of Messrs Ross and Cromarty's expensive lamps flattered that nice straight
  nose and the straight blond hair and that the young man was less beautiful in
  the daylight?</p>

  <p>'Perhaps you can tell me,' said the young man, still not raising his voice
  in emulation, 'which is Miss Lavinia Fitch?'</p>

  <p>Lavinia was the sandy little woman by the middle window. She had bought
  herself a fashionable hat for the occasion, but had done nothing to
  accommodate it; so that the hat perched on her bird's-nest of ginger hair as
  if it had dropped there from an upper window as she walked along the street.
  She was wearing her normal expression of pleased bewilderment and no
  make-up.</p>

  <p>Grant pointed her out to the young man.</p>

  <p>'Stranger in town?' he said, borrowing a phrase from all good Westerns.
  The polite formality of 'Miss Lavinia Fitch' could have come only from the
  U.S.A.</p>

  <p>'I'm really looking for Miss Fitch's nephew. I looked him up in the book
  and he isn't there, but I hoped he'd be here. Do you happen to know him,
  Mr&mdash;?</p>

  <p>'Grant.'</p>

  <p>'Mr Grant?'</p>

  <p>'I know him by sight, but he isn't here. Walter Whitmore, you mean?'</p>

  <p>'Yes. Whitmore. I don't know him at all, but I want very much to meet him
  because we have&mdash;had, I mean&mdash;a great friend in common. I was sure
  he'd be here. You're quite sure he isn't? After all, it's quite a party.'</p>

  <p>'He isn't in this room; I know that, because Whitmore is as tall as I am.
  But he may still be around somewhere. Look, you had better come and meet Miss
  Fitch. I suppose we can get through the barricade if we have the
  determination.'</p>

  <p>'You lean and I'll squirm,' said the young man, referring to their
  respective build. 'This is very kind of you, Mr Grant,' he said as they came
  up for air half-way, wedged tightly together between the hedged elbows and
  shoulders of their fellows; and he laughed up at the helpless Grant. And
  Grant was suddenly disconcerted. So disconcerted that he turned immediately
  and continued his struggle through the jungle to the clearing at the middle
  window where Lavinia Fitch was standing.</p>

  <p>'Miss Fitch,' he said, 'here is a young man who wants to meet you. He is
  trying to get in touch with your nephew.'</p>

  <p>'With Walter?' said Lavinia, her peaked little face losing its muzzy
  expression of general benevolence and sharpening to real interest.</p>

  <p>'My name is Searle, Miss Fitch. I'm over from the States on holiday and I
  wanted to meet Walter because Cooney Wiggin was a friend of mine too.'</p>

  <p>'Cooney! You are a friend of Cooney's? Oh, Walter will be delighted, my
  dear, simply delighted. Oh, what a nice surprise in the middle of
  this&mdash;I mean, so unexpected. Walter <i>will</i> be pleased. Searle, did
  you say?'</p>

  <p>'Yes. Leslie Searle. I couldn't find Walter in the book&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'No, he has just a pied-à-terre in town. He lives down at Salcott St Mary
  like the rest of us. Where he has the farm, you know. The farm he broadcasts
  about. At least it's my farm but he runs it and talks about it and&mdash;.
  He's broadcasting this afternoon, that is why he isn't coming to the party.
  But you must come down and stay. Come down this weekend. Come back with us
  this afternoon.'</p>

  <p>'But you don't know if Walter&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'You don't have any engagements for the weekend, do you?'</p>

  <p>'No. No, I haven't. But&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Well, then. Walter is going straight back from the studio, but you can
  come with Liz and me in our car and we'll surprise him. Liz! Liz, dear, where
  are you? Where are you staying, Mr Searle?'</p>

  <p>'I'm at the Westmorland.'</p>

  <p>'Well, what could be handier. Liz! Where <i>is</i> Liz?'</p>

  <p>'Here, Aunt Lavinia.'</p>

  <p>'Liz, dear, this is Leslie Searle, who is coming back with us for the
  weekend. He wants to meet Walter because they were both friends of Cooney's.
  And this is Friday, and we are all going to be at Salcott over the weekend
  recovering from this&mdash;being nice and quiet and peaceful, so what could
  be more appropriate. So, Liz dear, you take him round to the Westmorland and
  help him pack and then come back for me, will you? By that time
  this&mdash;the party will surely be over, and you can pick me up and we'll go
  back to Salcott together and surprise Walter.'</p>

  <p>Grant saw the interest in the young man's face as he looked at Liz
  Garrowby, and wondered a little. Liz was a small plain girl with a sallow
  face. True, she had remarkable eyes; speedwell blue and surprising; and she
  had the kind of face a man might want to live with; she was a nice girl, Liz.
  But she was not the type of girl at whom young men look with instant
  attention. Perhaps it was just that Searle had heard rumours of her
  engagement, and was identifying her as Walter Whitmore's fiancée.</p>

  <p>He lost interest in the Fitch ménage as he saw that Marta had spotted him.
  He indicated that he would meet her at the door, and plunged once more into
  the suffocating depths. Marta, being the more ruthless of the two, did the
  double distance in half the time and was waiting for him in the doorway.</p>

  <p>'Who is the beautiful young man?' she asked, looking backwards as they
  moved to the stairs.</p>

  <p>'He came looking for Walter Whitmore. He says he's a friend of Cooney
  Wiggin.'</p>

  <p>'<i>Says?</i>' repeated Marta, being caustic not about the young man but
  about Grant.</p>

  <p>'The police mind,' Grant said apologetically.</p>

  <p>'And who is Cooney Wiggin, anyhow?'</p>

  <p>'Cooney was one of the best-known press photographers in the States. He
  was killed while photographing one of those Balkan flare-ups a year or two
  ago.'</p>

  <p>'You know everything, don't you.'</p>

  <p>It was on the tip of Grant's tongue to say: 'Anyone but an actress would
  have known that,' but he liked Marta. Instead he said: 'He is going down to
  Salcott for the weekend, I understand.'</p>

  <p>'The beautiful young man? Well, well. I hope Lavinia knows what she is
  doing.'</p>

  <p>'What is wrong with having him down?'</p>

  <p>'I don't know, but it seems to me to be taking risks with their luck.'</p>

  <p>'Luck?'</p>

  <p>'Everything has worked out the way they wanted it to, hasn't it? Walter
  saved from Marguerite Merriam and settling down to marry Liz; all family
  together in the old homestead and too cosy for words. No time to go
  introducing disconcertingly beautiful young men into the ménage, it seems to
  me.'</p>

  <p>'Disconcerting,' murmured Grant, wondering again what had disconcerted him
  about Searle. Mere good looks could not have been responsible. Policemen are
  not impressed by good looks.</p>

  <p>'I wager that Emma takes one look at him and gets him out of the house
  directly after breakfast on Monday morning,' Marta said. 'Her darling Liz is
  going to marry Walter, and nothing is going to stop that if Emma has anything
  to do with it.'</p>

  <p>'Liz Garrowby doesn't look very impressionable to me. I don't see why Mrs
  Garrowby should worry.'</p>

  <p>'Don't you indeed. That boy was making an impression on me in thirty
  seconds flat and a range of twenty yards, and I'm considered practically
  incombustible. Besides, I never believed that Liz really fell in love with
  that stick. She just wanted to bind up his broken heart.'</p>

  <p>'Was it badly broken?'</p>

  <p>'Considerably shaken, I should say. Naturally.'</p>

  <p>'Did you ever act with Marguerite Merriam?'</p>

  <p>'Oh, yes. More than once. We were together for quite a lengthy run in
  <i>Walk in Darkness</i>. There's a taxi coming.'</p>

  <p>'<i>Taxi!</i> What did you think of her?'</p>

  <p>'Marguerite? Oh, she was mad, of course.'</p>

  <p>'How mad?'</p>

  <p>'Ten tenths.'</p>

  <p>'In what way?'</p>

  <p>'You mean how did it take her? Oh, a complete indifference to everything
  but the thing she wanted at the moment.'</p>

  <p>'That isn't madness; that is merely the criminal mind at its
  simplest.'</p>

  <p>'Well, you ought to know, my dear. Perhaps she was a criminal manqué. What
  is quite certain is that she was as mad as a hatter and I wouldn't wish even
  Walter Whitmore a fate like being married to her.'</p>

  <p>'Why do you dislike the British Public's bright boy so much?'</p>

  <p>'My dear, I hate the way he <i>yearns</i>. It was bad enough when he was
  yearning over the thyme on an Aegean hillside with the bullets zipping past
  his ears&mdash;he never failed to let us hear the bullets: I always suspected
  that he did it by cracking a whip&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Marta, you shock me.'</p>

  <p>'I don't, my dear; not one little bit. You know as well as I do. When we
  were <i>all</i> being shot at, Walter took care that he was safe in a nice
  fuggy office fifty feet underground. Then when it was once more unique to be
  in danger, up comes Walter from his little safe office and sits himself on a
  thymey hillside with a microphone and a whip to make bullet noises with.'</p>

  <p>'I see that I shall have to bail you out, one of these days.'</p>

  <p>'Homicide?'</p>

  <p>'No; criminal libel.'</p>

  <p>'Do you need bail for that? I thought it was one of those nice gentlemanly
  things that you are just summonsed for.'</p>

  <p>Grant thought how independable Marta's ignorances were.</p>

  <p>'It might still be homicide, though,' Marta said, in the cooing,
  considering voice that was her trade-mark on the stage. 'I could just stand
  the thyme and the bullets, but now that he has taken a ninety-nine years'
  lease of the spring corn, and the woodpeckers, and things, he amounts to a
  public menace.'</p>

  <p>'Why do you listen to him?'</p>

  <p>'Well, there's a dreadful fascination about it, you know. One thinks:
  Well, that's the absolute sky-limit of awfulness, than which <i>nothing</i>
  could be worse. And so next week you listen to see if it really <i>can</i> be
  worse. It's a snare. It's so awful that you can't even switch off. You wait
  fascinated for the next piece of awfulness, and the next. And you are still
  there when he signs off.'</p>

  <p>'It couldn't be, could it, Marta, that this is mere professional
  jealousy?'</p>

  <p>'Are you suggesting that the creature is a <i>professional</i>?' asked
  Marta, dropping her voice a perfect fifth, so that it quivered with the
  reflection of repertory years, and provincial digs, and Sunday trains, and
  dreary auditions in cold dark theatres.</p>

  <p>'No, I'm suggesting that he is an actor. A quite natural and unconscious
  actor, who has made himself a household word in a few years without doing any
  noticeable work to that end. I could forgive you for not liking that. What
  did Marguerite find so wonderful about him?'</p>

  <p>'I can tell you that. His devotion. Marguerite liked picking the wings off
  flies. Walter would let her take him to pieces and then come back for
  more.'</p>

  <p>'There was one time that he didn't come back.'</p>

  <p>'Yes.'</p>

  <p>'What was the final row about, do you know?'</p>

  <p>'I don't think there was one. I think he just told her he was through. At
  least that is what he said at the inquest. Did you read the obituaries, by
  the way?'</p>

  <p>'I suppose I must have at the time. I don't remember them
  individually.'</p>

  <p>'If she had lived another ten years she would have got a tiny par in among
  the "ads" on the back page. As it was she got better notices than Duse. "A
  flame of genius has gone out and the world is the poorer." "She had the
  lightness of a blown leaf and the grace of a willow in the wind." That sort
  of thing. One was surprised that there were no black edges in the Press. The
  mourning was practically of national dimensions.'</p>

  <p>'It's a far cry from that to Liz Garrowby.'</p>

  <p>'Dear, nice Liz. If Marguerite Merriam was too bad even for Walter
  Whitmore, then Liz is too good for him. Much too good for him. I should be
  delighted if the beautiful young man took her from under his nose.'</p>

  <p>'Somehow I can't see your "beautiful young man" in the rôle of husband,
  whereas Walter will make a very good one.'</p>

  <p>'My good man, Walter will broadcast about it. All about their children,
  and the shelves he has put up in the pantry, and how the little woman's bulbs
  are coming along, and the frost patterns on the nursery window. She'd be much
  safer with&mdash;what did you say his name was?'</p>

  <p>'Searle. Leslie Searle.' Absentmindedly he watched the pale yellow neon
  signature of <i>Laurent's</i> coming nearer.</p>

  <p>'I don't think safe is the adjective I would apply to Searle, somehow,' he
  said reflectively; and from that moment forgot all about Leslie Searle until
  the day when he was sent down to Salcott St Mary to search for the young
  man's body.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch02"
     id="ch02"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

  <p class="first">'DAYLIGHT!' said Liz, coming out on to the pavement. 'Good
  clean daylight.' She sniffed the afternoon air with pleasure. 'The car is
  round the corner in the square. Do you know London well, Mr&mdash;Mr
  Searle?'</p>

  <p>'I've been in England for holidays quite often, yes. Not often as early in
  the year as this, though.'</p>

  <p>'You haven't seen England at all unless you have seen it in the
  spring.'</p>

  <p>'So I've heard.'</p>

  <p>'Did you fly over?'</p>

  <p>'Just from Paris, like a good American. Paris is fine in the spring
  too.'</p>

  <p>'So I've heard,' she said, returning his phrase and his tone. And then,
  finding the eye he turned on her intimidating, went on: 'Are you a
  journalist? Is that how you knew Cooney Wiggin?'</p>

  <p>'No, I'm in the same line as Cooney was.'</p>

  <p>'Press photography?'</p>

  <p>'Not Press. Just photography. I spend most of the winter on the Coast,
  doing people.'</p>

  <p>'The Coast?'</p>

  <p>'California. That keeps me on good terms with my bank manager. And the
  other half of the year I travel and photograph the things I want to
  photograph.'</p>

  <p>'It sounds a good sort of life,' Liz said, as she unlocked the car door
  and got in.</p>

  <p>'It's a very good life.'</p>

  <p>The car was a two-seater Rolls; a little old-fashioned in shape as Rolls
  cars, which last for ever, are apt to be. Liz explained it as they drove out
  of the square into the stream of the late afternoon traffic.</p>

  <p>'The first thing Aunt Lavinia did when she made money was to buy herself a
  sable scarf. She had always thought a sable scarf the last word in good
  dressing. And the second thing she wanted was a Rolls. She got that with her
  next book. She never wore the scarf at all because she said it was a dreadful
  nuisance to have something dangling about her all the time, but the Rolls was
  a great success so we still have it.'</p>

  <p>'What happened to the sable scarf?'</p>

  <p>'She swopped it for a pair of Queen Anne chairs and a lawn-mower.'</p>

  <p>As they came to rest in front of the hotel she said: 'They won't let me
  wait here. I'll go over to the parking place and wait for you.'</p>

  <p>'But aren't you going to pack for me?'</p>

  <p>'Pack for you? Certainly not.'</p>

  <p>'But your aunt said you were to.'</p>

  <p>'That was a mere figure of speech.'</p>

  <p>'Not the way I figure it. Anyhow, come up and watch while I pack. Lend me
  your advice and countenance. It's a nice countenance.'</p>

  <p>In the end it was actually Liz who packed the things into his two cases,
  while he took them out of the drawers and tossed them over to her. They were
  all very expensive things, she observed; custom-made of the best
  materials.</p>

  <p>'Are you very rich, or just very extravagant?' she asked.</p>

  <p>'Fastidious, let us say.'</p>

  <p>By the time they left the hotel the first street lamps were decorating the
  daylight.</p>

  <p>'This is when I think lights look best,' Liz said. 'While it is still
  daylight. They are daffodil yellow and magic. Presently when it grows dark
  they will go white and ordinary.'</p>

  <p>They drove back to Bloomsbury only to find that Miss Fitch had gone. The
  Ross part of the firm, sprawled in large exhaustion in a chair and
  thoughtfully consuming what was left of the sherry, roused himself to a
  shadow of his professional bonhomie to say that Miss Fitch had decided that
  there would be more room in Mr Whitmore's car and had gone over to the studio
  to pick him up when he had finished his half-hour. Miss Garrowby and Mr
  Searle were to follow them down to Salcott St Mary.</p>

  <p>Searle was silent as they made their way out of London; from deference to
  the driver, Liz supposed, and liked him for it. It was not until green fields
  appeared on either hand that he began to talk about Walter. Cooney, it
  seemed, had thought a lot of Walter.</p>

  <p>'You weren't in the Balkans with Cooney Wiggin, then?'</p>

  <p>'No, I knew Cooney back in the States. But he wrote me a lot in letters
  about your cousin.'</p>

  <p>'That was nice of him. But Walter isn't my cousin, you know.'</p>

  <p>'Not? But Miss Fitch is your aunt, isn't she?'</p>

  <p>'No. I'm no relation to any of them. Lavinia's
  sister&mdash;Emma&mdash;married my father when I was little. That's all.
  Mother&mdash;Emma, that is&mdash;practically surrounded him, if the truth
  must be told. He didn't have a chance. You see, she brought up Lavinia, and
  it was a frightful shock to her when Vinnie upped and did something on her
  own. Especially anything so outré as becoming a best-seller. Emma looked
  round to see what else she could lay hands on that would do to go broody
  about, and there was Father, stranded with a baby daughter, and simply asking
  to be arrested. So she became Emma Garrowby, and my mother. I never think of
  her as my "step", because I don't remember any other. When my father died,
  mother came to live at Trimmings with Aunt Lavinia, and when I left school I
  took over the job of her secretary. Hence the line about packing for
  you.'</p>

  <p>'And Walter? Where does he come in?'</p>

  <p>'He is the eldest sister's son. His parents died in India and Aunt Lavinia
  has brought him up since then. I mean, since he was fifteen, or so.'</p>

  <p>He was silent for a little, evidently disentangling this in his mind.</p>

  <p>Why had she told him that, she wondered? Why had she told him that her
  mother was possessive; even if she had made it clear that she was possessive
  in the very nicest way? Was it possible that she was nervous? She, who was
  never nervous and never chattered. What was there to be nervous about? There
  was surely nothing disconcerting in the presence of a good-looking young man.
  Both as Liz Garrowby and as Miss Lavinia Fitch's secretary she had
  entertained a great many good-looking young men in her time, and had not been
  (as far as she could remember) greatly impressed.</p>

  <p>She turned from the black polished surface of the arterial road into a
  side one. The last raw scar of new development had faded behind them, and
  they were now in an altogether country world. The little lanes ran in and out
  of each other, anonymous and irrelevant, and Liz picked the ones she wanted
  without hesitation.</p>

  <p>'How do you choose?' Searle asked. 'All these little dirt roads look alike
  to me.'</p>

  <p>'They look alike to me too. But I have done this trip so often that my
  hands do it for me, the way my fingers know the keys of a typewriter. I
  couldn't repeat the keys of a typewriter by trying to visualise them, but my
  fingers know where each key is. Do you know this part of the world?'</p>

  <p>'No, this is new to me.'</p>

  <p>'It's a dull county, I think. Quite featureless. Walter says that it is a
  constant permutation of the same seven "props": six trees and a haystack.
  Indeed he says that there is a phrase in the county regiment's official march
  that says quite plainly: Six trees and a <i>hay</i>-stack!' She sang the
  phrase for him. 'But where you see the bump in the road is the beginning of
  Orfordshire, and that is much more satisfying.'</p>

  <p>Orfordshire was in truth a satisfactory stretch of territory. In the
  growing dusk its lines flowed together in ever-changing combinations that
  were dream-like in their perfection. Presently they paused on the lip of a
  shallow valley and looked down on the dark smudge of roofs and the scattered
  lights of a village.</p>

  <p>'Salcott St Mary,' Liz said, introducing it. 'A once beautiful English
  village that is now occupied territory.'</p>

  <p>'Occupied by whom?'</p>

  <p>'By what the remaining natives call "they artist folk". It is very sad for
  them, poor things. They took Aunt Lavinia in their stride, because she was
  the owner of the "big house" and not part of their actual lives at all. And
  she has been here so long that she is almost beginning to belong. The big
  house has never been part of the village in the last hundred years, anyhow,
  so it didn't matter much who lived in it. The rot started when the mill house
  fell vacant, and some firm was going to buy it for a factory. I mean: to turn
  it into a factory. Then Marta Hallard heard about it and bought it to live
  in, right under the various lawyers' noses, and everyone was delighted and
  thought they were saved. They didn't much want an actress creature living in
  the mill house, but at least they weren't after all to have a factory in
  their nice village. Poor darlings, if they could only have foreseen.'</p>

  <p>She set the car in motion, and drove slowly along the slope, parallel with
  the village.</p>

  <p>'I take it there was a sheep-track from London to here in about six
  months,' Searle said.</p>

  <p>'How did you know?'</p>

  <p>'I see it all the time on the Coast. Someone finds a good quiet spot, and
  before they've got the plumbing fixed they're being asked to vote for
  mayor.'</p>

  <p>'Yes. Every third cottage in the place has an alien in it. All degrees of
  wealth, from Toby Tullis&mdash;the play-wright, you know&mdash;who has a
  lovely Jacobean house in the middle of the village street, to Serge Ratoff
  the dancer who lives in a converted stable. All degrees of living in sin,
  from Deenie Paddington who never has the same weekend guest twice, to poor
  old Atlanta Hope and Bart Hobart who have been living in sin, bless them, for
  the best part of thirty years. All degrees of talent from Silas Weekley, who
  writes those dark novels of country life, all steaming manure and slashing
  rain, to Miss Easton-Dixon who writes a fairy-tale book once a year for the
  Christmas trade.'</p>

  <p>'It sounds lovely,' Searle said.</p>

  <p>'It's obscene,' Liz said, more hotly than she intended; and then wondered
  again why she should be so on edge this evening. 'And talking of the
  obscene,' she said, pulling herself together, 'I'm afraid it is too dark for
  you to appreciate Trimmings, but the full flavour of it can keep till the
  morning. You can just get the general effect against the sky.'</p>

  <p>She waited while the young man took in the frieze of dark pinnacles and
  crenellations against the evening sky. 'The special gem is the Gothic
  conservatory, which you can't see in this light.'</p>

  <p>'Why did Miss Fitch choose this?' Searle asked in wonder.</p>

  <p>'Because she thought it was grand,' Liz said, her voice warm with
  affection. 'She was brought up in a rectory, you know; the kind of rectory
  that was built circa 1850; so her eye became conditioned to Victorian Gothic.
  Even now, you know, she doesn't honestly see what is wrong with it. She knows
  people laugh at it, and she is quite philosophical about it, but she doesn't
  really know why they laugh. When she first brought Cormac Ross, her
  publisher, here, he complimented her on the appropriateness of the name, and
  she had no idea what he was talking about.'</p>

  <p>'Well, I'm in no mood to be critical, even of Victorian Gothic,' the young
  man said. 'It was extraordinarily nice of Miss Fitch to have me down here
  without even stopping to look me up in the reference books. Somehow over in
  the States we expect more caution from the English.'</p>

  <p>'It isn't a matter of caution with the English; it's a matter of domestic
  calculation. Aunt Lavinia asked you down on the spur of the moment because
  she didn't have to do any domestic reckoning. She knows that there is enough
  spare linen to furnish a spare bed, and enough food in the house to feed a
  guest, and enough "labour" to provide for his comfort, and so she has no need
  to hesitate. Do you mind if we go straight round to the garage and take your
  things in through the side door. It's a day's march to the front door from
  the domestics' quarters, the baronial hall unfortunately intervening.'</p>

  <p>'Who built this and why?' Searle asked, looking up at the bulk of the
  house as they skirted it.</p>

  <p>'A man from Bradford, I understand. There was a very pleasant early
  Georgian house on the spot&mdash;there is a print of it in the
  gun-room&mdash;but he thought it a poor-looking object and pulled it
  down.'</p>

  <p>So it was through ugly passages, dimly lit, that Searle carried his
  luggage; passages that Liz said always reminded her of boarding-school.</p>

  <p>'Just drop them there,' she said, indicating a service stair, 'and someone
  will take them up presently. Come through now to comparative civilisation and
  get warm and have a drink and meet Walter.'</p>

  <p>She pushed open a baize door and led him into the front of the house.</p>

  <p>'Do you roller-skate?' he asked, as they crossed the meaningless spaces of
  the hall.</p>

  <p>Liz said that she hadn't thought of it, but that the place was, of course,
  useful for dances. 'The local hunt use it once a year,' she said. 'Though you
  mightn't think it, it's less draughty than the Corn Exchange in Wickham.'</p>

  <p>She opened a door and they went from the grey spaces of Orfordshire and
  the dreary dim corridors of the house into warmth and firelight and the
  welcome of a lived-in room full of well-used furniture and scented with
  burning logs and narcissi. Lavinia was sunk in a chair with her neat little
  feet on the edge of the steel fender and her untidy mop of hair escaping from
  its pins all over the cushions. Facing her, with his elbow on the mantelpiece
  and one foot on the fender in his favourite attitude, was Walter Whitmore,
  and Liz saw him with a rush of affection and relief.</p>

  <p>Why relief? she asked herself, as she listened to the greetings. She had
  known Walter would be here. Why relief?</p>

  <p>Was it just that she could now hand over the social burden to Walter?</p>

  <p>But social duties were her daily task and she took them in her stride. Nor
  could Searle be justly considered a burden. She had rarely met anyone so easy
  or so undemanding. Why this gladness to see Walter, this absurd feeling that
  now it would be all right? Like a child coming back from strangeness to a
  familiar room.</p>

  <p>She watched the pleasure on Walter's face as he welcomed Searle; and loved
  him. He was human, and imperfect, and his face was already growing lined, and
  his hair showed signs of growing back above the temples, but he was Walter,
  and real; not&mdash;not something of inhuman beauty that had walked out of
  some morning of the world beyond our remembering.</p>

  <p>She took pleasure in remarking that, face to face with Walter's tallness,
  the newcomer looked nearly short. And his shoes, for all their expensiveness
  were, from an English point of view, distinctly regrettable.</p>

  <p>'After all, he's only a photographer,' she said to herself, and was caught
  up by her own absurdity.</p>

  <p>Was she so impressed by Leslie Searle that she needed protection against
  him? Surely not.</p>

  <p>It was not uncommon to find that morning-of-the-world beauty among
  northern peoples; nor was it to be wondered at that it made one think of
  tales of the seal people and their strangeness. The young man was just a
  good-looking Scandinavian-American with a deplorable taste in shoes and a
  talent for using the right kind of lens. There was not the slightest need for
  her to cross herself, or utter charms against him.</p>

  <p>Even so, when her mother asked him at dinner whether he had any family in
  England, she was conscious of a vague surprise that he should be possessed of
  anything so mundane as relations.</p>

  <p>He had a girl cousin, he said; that was all.</p>

  <p>'We don't like each other. She paints.'</p>

  <p>'Is the painting a non-sequitur?' Walter asked.</p>

  <p>'Oh, I like her painting well enough&mdash;what I've seen of it. It's just
  that we annoy each other, so we don't bother with one another.'</p>

  <p>Lavinia asked what she painted; was it portraits?</p>

  <p>Liz wondered, while they talked, if she had ever painted her cousin. It
  must be nice to be able to take a brush and a box of paints and put on record
  for one's own pleasure and satisfaction a beauty that could otherwise never
  belong to one. To have it to keep and look at whenever one wanted to until
  one died.</p>

  <p>'Elizabeth Garrowby!' she said to herself. 'In no time at all you will be
  hanging up actor's photographs.'</p>

  <p>But no; it wasn't like that at all. It was no more reprehensible than
  loving a&mdash;than admiring a work of Praxiteles. If Praxiteles had ever
  decided to immortalise a hurdler, the hurdler would have looked just like
  Leslie Searle. She must ask him sometime where he went to school, and if he
  had ever run races over hurdles.</p>

  <p>She was a little sorry to see that her mother did not like Searle. No one
  would ever suspect it, of course; but Liz knew her mother very well and could
  gauge with micrometer accuracy her secret reactions to any given situation.
  She was aware now of the distrust that seethed and bubbled behind that bland
  front, as lava seethes and bubbles behind the smiling slopes of Vesuvius.</p>

  <p>In that she was, of course, right. When Walter had borne his guest away to
  show him his room, and Liz had gone to tidy for dinner, Mrs Garrowby had
  catechised her sister about this unknown quantity that she had unloaded on
  the household.</p>

  <p>'How do you know that he ever knew Cooney Wiggin at all?' she asked.</p>

  <p>'If he didn't, Walter will soon find out,' Lavinia said reasonably. 'Don't
  bother me, Em. I'm tired. It was an awful party. Everyone screaming their
  heads off.'</p>

  <p>'If his little plan is to burgle Trimmings, it will be too late tomorrow
  morning for Walter to find out that he didn't know Cooney at all. Anyone
  could say they knew Cooney. If it comes to that, anyone could say they knew
  Cooney and get away with it. There was practically no part of Cooney Wiggin's
  life that wasn't public property.'</p>

  <p>'I can't think why you should be so suspicious about him. We have often
  had people we didn't know anything about down here at a moment's
  notice&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Indeed we have,' Emma said grimly.</p>

  <p>'And so far they have always been what they said they were. Why pick on Mr
  Searle for your suspicions?'</p>

  <p>'He is much too personable to be wholesome.'</p>

  <p>It was typical of Emma to shy at the word 'beauty', and to substitute a
  bastard compromise like 'personable'.</p>

  <p>Lavinia pointed out that since Mr Searle was staying only till Monday the
  amount of unwholesomeness he could manage to disseminate was necessarily
  small.</p>

  <p>'And if it is burglary you are thinking of, he's going to have a sad shock
  when he goes through Trimmings. I can't think, off-hand, of anything that is
  worth lugging as far as Wickham.'</p>

  <p>'There's the silver.'</p>

  <p>'Somehow I can't believe that anyone went to all the trouble of appearing
  at Cormac's party, and pretending to know Cooney, and asking for Walter, just
  to obtain possession of a couple of dozen forks, some spoons, and a salver.
  Why not just force a lock one dark night?'</p>

  <p>Mrs Garrowby looked unconvinced.</p>

  <p>'It must be very useful to have someone who is dead when you want to be
  introduced to a family.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, Em,' Lavinia had said, breaking into laughter as much at the sentence
  as at the sentiment.</p>

  <p>So Mrs Garrowby sat and brooded darkly behind her gracious exterior. She
  was not afraid for the Trimmings silver, of course. She was afraid of what
  she called the young man's 'personableness.' She distrusted it for itself,
  and hated it as a potential threat to her house.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch03"
     id="ch03"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

  <p class="first">BUT Emma did not, as Marta Hallard had prophesied, get the
  young man out of the house first thing on Monday morning. By Monday morning
  it was incredible to the inhabitants of Trimmings&mdash;all but Emma
  herself&mdash;that on the previous Friday they had never heard of Leslie
  Searle. There had never been any guest at Trimmings who had merged himself
  with the household as Searle did. Nor had there ever been anyone who
  intensified the life of each one of them to the same extent.</p>

  <p>He walked round the farm with Walter, admiring the new brick paths, the
  piggery, and the separator. He had spent his school holidays on a farm, and
  was knowledgeable as well as receptive. He stood patiently in green lanes
  while Walter recorded in his little notebook a hedgerow sprout or a bird-note
  that would do for his broadcast next Friday. He photographed with equal
  enthusiasm the seventeenth-century honesty of the little farmhouse, and the
  surrealist irrelevance of Trimmings, and contrived to convey the essential
  quality of each. Indeed, his photographic comment on Trimmings was so witty
  that Walter after his involuntary laughter had a moment of discomfort. This
  amiable young man had more sides to him than were apparent in a discussion on
  husbandry. He had so taken for granted the boy's discipleship that it was as
  disconcerting to look at these photographs as if his shadow had suddenly
  spoken to him.</p>

  <p>But he forgot the moment almost before it had passed. He was not an
  introspective person.</p>

  <p>For the introspective Liz, on the other hand, life had become all of a
  sudden a sort of fun-fair. A kaleidoscope. A place where no surface ever
  stayed still or horizontal for more than a few seconds together. Where one
  was plunged into swift mock danger and whirled about in coloured lights. Liz
  had been falling in and out of love more or less regularly since the age of
  seven, but she had never wanted to marry anyone but Walter. Who was Walter,
  and different. But never in that long progression from the baker's roundsman
  to Walter had she been aware of anyone as she was aware of Searle. Even with
  Tino Tresca, of the yearning eyes and the tenor that dissolved one's heart
  like a melting ice, even with Tresca, craziest of all her devotions, it was
  possible to forget for minutes together that she was in the same room with
  him. (With Walter, of course, there was nothing remarkable in the fact that
  they should be sharing the same air: he was just there and it was nice.) But
  it was never possible to forget that Searle was in a room.</p>

  <p>Why? she kept asking herself. Or rather, why not?</p>

  <p>It had nothing to do with falling in love, this interest; this excitement.
  If, on Sunday night, after two days in his company, he had turned to her and
  said: 'Come away with me, Liz,' she would have laughed aloud at so absurd a
  notion. She had no desire to go away with him.</p>

  <p>But a light went out of the room with him, and sprang up again when he
  came back. She was aware of every movement of his, from the small mallet of
  his forefinger as it flicked the radio switch, to the lift of his foot as it
  kicked a log in the fireplace.</p>

  <p>Why?</p>

  <p>She had gone walking with him through the woods, she had shown him the
  village and the church, and always the excitement had been there; in his
  gentle drawling courtesy, and in those disconcerting grey eyes that seemed to
  know too much about her. For Liz, all American men were divided into two
  classes: those who treated you as if you were a frail old lady, and those who
  treated you as if you were just frail. Searle belonged to the first class. He
  helped her over stiles, and shielded her from the crowding dangers of the
  village street; he deferred to her opinion and flattered her ego; and, as a
  mere change from Walter, Liz found it pleasant. Walter took it for granted
  that she was adult enough to look after herself, but not quite adult enough
  to be consulted by Walter Whitmore, Household Word Throughout the British
  Isles and a Large Part of Overseas. Searle's was a charming reversal of
  form.</p>

  <p>She had thought, watching him move slowly round the interior of the
  church, what a perfect companion he would have made if it were not for this
  pricking excitement; this sense of wrongness.</p>

  <p>Even the unimpressionable Lavinia, always but semi-detached from her
  current heroine, was, Liz noticed, touched by this strange attraction. Searle
  had sat with her on the terrace after dinner on Saturday night, while Walter
  and Liz walked in the garden and Emma attended to household matters. As they
  passed below the terrace each time on their round of the garden, Liz could
  hear her aunt's light childlike voice babbling happily, like a little stream
  in the half-dark of the early moonrise. And on Sunday morning Lavinia had
  confided to Liz that no one had ever made her feel so <i>abandoned</i> as Mr
  Searle. 'I am sure that he was something very wicked in Ancient Greece,' she
  said. And had added with a giggle: 'But don't tell your mother that I said
  so!'</p>

  <p>Against the entrenched opposition of her sister, her nephew, and her
  daughter, Mrs Garrowby would have found it difficult to rid Trimmings of the
  young man's presence; but her final undoing came at the hands of Miss
  Easton-Dixon.</p>

  <p>Miss Easton-Dixon lived in a tiny cottage on the slope behind the village
  street. It had three windows, asymmetrical in their own right and in relation
  to each other, a thatched roof, and a single chimney, and it looked as if one
  good sneeze would bring the whole thing round the occupant's ears; but its
  aspect of disintegration was equalled only by its spick and span condition.
  The cream wash of the plaster, the lime-green paint of door and windows, the
  dazzling crispness of the muslin curtains, the swept condition of the
  red-brick path, together with the almost conscientious crookedness of
  everything that normally would be straight, made a picture that belonged by
  right to one of Miss Easton-Dixon's own fairy-tale books for Christmas.</p>

  <p>In the intervals of writing her annual story, Miss Easton-Dixon indulged
  in handcrafts. In the schoolroom she had tortured wood with red-hot pokers.
  When pen-painting came in she had pen-painted with assiduity, and had
  graduated from that to barbola work. After a spell of sealing-wax, she had
  come to raffia, and thence to hand-weaving. She still weaved now and then,
  but her ingrained desire was not to create but to transform. No plain surface
  was safe against Miss Easton-Dixon. She would take a cold cream jar and
  reduce its functional simplicity to a nightmare of mock-Meissen. In times
  which have seen the disappearance of both the attic and the boxroom, she was
  the scourge of her friends; who, incidentally, loved her.</p>

  <p>As well as being a prop of the Women's Rural Institute, a lavish provider
  of goods for bazaars, a devoted polisher of Church plate, Miss Easton-Dixon
  was also an authority on Hollywood and all its ramifications. Every Thursday
  she took the one o'clock bus into Wickham and spent the afternoon having
  one-and-ninepence-worth at the converted Followers of Moses hall that did
  duty as a cinema. If the week's film happened to be something of which she
  did not approve&mdash;ukelele opus, for instance, or the tribulations of some
  blameless housemaid&mdash;she put the one-and-ninepence, together with the
  eight-penny bus fare, into the china pig on the mantelpiece, and used the
  fund to take her to Crome, when some film that she specially looked forward
  to was being shown in that comparative metropolis.</p>

  <p>Every Friday she collected her <i>Screen Bulletin</i> from the newsagent
  in the village, read through the releases for the week, marked those she
  intended to view, and put away the paper for future reference. There was no
  bit player in two hemispheres that Miss Easton-Dixon could not give chapter
  and verse for. She could tell you why the make-up expert at Grand Continental
  had gone over to Wilhelm's, and the exact difference that had made to
  Madeleine Rice's left profile.</p>

  <p>So that poor Emma, walking up the spotless brick path to hand in a basket
  of eggs on her way to Evensong, was walking all unaware into her
  Waterloo.</p>

  <p>Miss Easton-Dixon asked about the party to celebrate the birth of
  <i>Maureen's Lover</i> and Lavinia Fitch's literary coming-of-age. Had it
  been a success?</p>

  <p>Emma supposed so. Ross and Cromarty's parties always were. A sufficiency
  of drink was all that was ever necessary to make a party a success.</p>

  <p>'I hear that you have a very good-looking guest this weekend,' Miss
  Easton-Dixon said, less because she was curious than because it was against
  her idea of good manners to have gaps in the conversation.</p>

  <p>'Yes. Lavinia brought him back from the party. A person called
  Searle.'</p>

  <p>'Oh,' said Miss Easton-Dixon in absentminded encouragement, while she
  transferred the eggs to a tenpenny white bowl that she had painted with
  poppies and corn.</p>

  <p>'An American. He says that he is a photographer. Anyone who takes
  photographs can say that he is a photographer and there is no one to deny it.
  It is a very useful profession. Almost as useful as "nurse" used to be before
  it became a matter of registration and reference books.'</p>

  <p>'Searle?' Miss Easton-Dixon said, pausing with an egg in her hand. 'Not
  <i>Leslie</i> Searle, by any chance?'</p>

  <p>'Yes,' said Emma, taken aback. 'His name is Leslie. At least that is what
  he says. Why?'</p>

  <p>'You mean Leslie Searle is <i>here</i>? In Salcott St Mary? How simply
  unbelievable!'</p>

  <p>'What is unbelievable about it?' Emma said, on the defensive.</p>

  <p>'But he is <i>famous</i>.'</p>

  <p>'So are half the residents of Salcott St Mary,' Emma reminded her
  tartly.</p>

  <p>'Yes, but they don't photograph the most exclusive people in the world. Do
  you know that Hollywood stars go down on their knees to get Leslie Searle to
  photograph them? It is something that they can't buy. A privilege. An
  honour.'</p>

  <p>'And, I take it, an advertisement,' said Emma. 'Are we talking about the
  same Leslie Searle, do you think?'</p>

  <p>'But of course! There can hardly be two Leslie Searles who are American
  and photographers.'</p>

  <p>'I see nothing impossible in that,' said Emma, a last-ditcher by
  nature.</p>

  <p>'But of course it must be <i>the</i> Leslie Searle. If it won't make you
  late for Evensong we can settle the matter here and now.'</p>

  <p>'How?'</p>

  <p>'I have a photograph of him somewhere.'</p>

  <p>'Of Leslie Searle!'</p>

  <p>'Yes. In a <i>Screen Bulletin</i>. Just let me look it out; it won't take
  a moment. This really is exciting. I can't think of anyone more&mdash;more
  exotic&mdash;to find in Salcott of all places.' She opened the door of a
  yellow-painted cupboard (decorated Bavarian-fashion with scrolls of stylised
  flowers) and disclosed the neat stacks of hoarded <i>Bulletins</i>. 'Let me
  see. It must be eighteen months ago&mdash;or perhaps two years.' With a
  practised hand she thumbed down the edges of the pile, so that the date in
  the corner of each was visible for a moment, and picked two or three from the
  pile. 'There is a "contents" list on the outside of each,' she pointed out,
  shuffling them on the table, 'so it doesn't take a moment to find what one
  wants. So useful.' And then, as the required issue did not turn up at once:
  'But if this is going to make you late, do leave it and come in on your way
  home. I shall look it out while you are in church.'</p>

  <p>But nothing would now have moved Emma from the house until she had seen
  that photograph.</p>

  <p>'Ah, here it is!' said Miss Easton-Dixon at last. '"Lovelies And The Lens"
  it was called. I suppose one cannot expect style <i>and</i> information for
  threepence a week. However, if I remember rightly the article was more
  respect-worthy than the title. Here it is. These are samples of his
  work&mdash;that is a <i>very</i> clever one of Lotta Marlow, isn't
  it&mdash;and here, over the page, you see, is a self-portrait. Isn't that
  your weekend guest?'</p>

  <p>It was a photograph taken at an odd angle and full of odd shadows; a
  composition rather than a 'likeness' in the old sense. But it was
  unmistakably Leslie Searle. The Leslie Searle who was occupying the 'tower'
  bedroom at Trimmings. Unless, of course, there were twins, both called
  Leslie, both called Searle, both Americans, and both photographers; which was
  something at which even Emma baulked.</p>

  <p>She skimmed through the article, which, as Miss Easton-Dixon had
  indicated, was a perfectly straight-forward account of the young man and his
  work and might equally well have come out of <i>Theatre Arts Monthly</i>. The
  article welcomed him back to the Coast for his annual stay, envied him being
  free of the world for the rest of the year, and commended his new portraits
  of the stars, more especially that of Danny Minsky in Hamlet clothes. 'The
  tears of laughter that Danny has wrung from us have no doubt blinded us to
  that Forbes-Robertson profile. It took Searle to show us that,' they
  said.</p>

  <p>'Yes,' said Emma, 'that's&mdash;' She had nearly said 'the creature' but
  stopped herself in time; 'that is the same person.'</p>

  <p>No, she said cautiously, she did not know how long he was staying&mdash;he
  was Lavinia's guest&mdash;but Miss Easton-Dixon should certainly meet him
  before he left if that were humanly possible.</p>

  <p>'If not,' said Miss Easton-Dixon, 'do please tell him how much I admire
  his work.'</p>

  <p>But that, of course, Emma had no intention of doing. She was not going to
  mention this little matter at home at all. She went to Evensong and sat in
  the Trimmings pew looking placid and benevolent and being thoroughly
  miserable. The creature was not only 'personable', he was a personality, and
  by that much more dangerous. He had a reputation that for all she knew might
  vie with Walter's in worldly worth. He no doubt had money, too. It was bad
  enough when she had only his 'personableness' to fear; now it turned out that
  he was eligible as well. He had everything on his side.</p>

  <p>If it had been possible to call up the powers of darkness against him, she
  would have done it. But she was in church and must use the means to hand. So
  she invoked God and all his angels to guard her Liz against the evils in her
  path; that is to say, against not inheriting Lavinia's fortune when the time
  came. 'Keep her true to Walter,' she prayed, 'and I'll&mdash;.' She tried to
  think of some bribe or penance that she could offer, but could think of none
  at the moment, so she merely repeated: 'Keep her true to Walter,' with no
  inducement added and left it to the unselfish goodness of the Deity.</p>

  <p>It did nothing to reassure her nor to bolster her faith in the Deity, to
  come on her daughter and Searle leaning on the little side gate into the
  Trimmings garden and laughing together like a pair of children. She came up
  behind them along the field path from the church, and was dismayed by some
  quality of loveliness, of youth, that belonged to their gaiety. A quality
  that was not apparent in any communion between Liz and Walter.</p>

  <p>'What I like best is the yard or two of Renaissance before the bit of
  Border peel,' Liz was saying. They were evidently at their favourite game of
  making fun of the Bradford magnate's folly.</p>

  <p>'How did he forget a moat, do you think?' Searle asked.</p>

  <p>'Perhaps he started life digging ditches and didn't want to be reminded of
  them.'</p>

  <p>'It's my guess he didn't want to spend money on digging a hole just to put
  water in it. They're Yankees, aren't they, up there?'</p>

  <p>Liz 'allowed' that north-country blood had probably much in common with
  New England. Then Searle saw Emma and greeted her, and they walked up to the
  house with her, not self-conscious in her presence or stopping their game,
  but drawing her into it and sharing their delight with her.</p>

  <p>She looked at Liz's sallow little countenance and tried to remember when
  she had last seen it so alive; so full of the joy of life. After a little she
  remembered. It was on a Christmas afternoon long ago, and Liz had experienced
  in the short space of an hour her first snow and her first Christmas
  tree.</p>

  <p>So far she had hated only Leslie Searle's beauty. Now she began to hate
  Leslie Searle.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch04"
     id="ch04"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

  <p class="first">IT was Emma's hope that Searle would go quietly away before
  any further evidences of desirableness were revealed to the family; but in
  that too she was bound to be frustrated. Searle had avowedly come to England
  for a holiday, he had no relations or intimate friends to visit, he had a
  camera and every intention of using it, and there seemed no reason why he
  should not stay at Trimmings and use it. His expressed intention, once he had
  seen the largely unspoiled loveliness of Orfordshire, was to find a good
  hotel in Crome and make that a centre for photographic foraging among the
  cottages and country houses of the neighbourhood. But that, as Lavinia
  swiftly pointed out, was absurd. He could stay at Trimmings, among his
  friends, and forage just as far afield and with as good results as he could
  at Crome. Why should he come back each night to a hotel room and the company
  of casual acquaintances in a hotel lounge, when he could return to a home and
  the comfort of his own room in the tower?</p>

  <p>Searle would no doubt have accepted the invitation in any case, but the
  final makeweight was the suggestion that he and Walter might do a book
  together. No one could remember afterwards who first made the suggestion, but
  it was one that anyone might have made. It was from journalism that Walter
  had graduated to the eminence of radio commentator, and an alliance between
  one of Britain's best-known personalities and one of America's most admired
  photographers would produce a book that might, with luck, have equal interest
  for Weston-super-Mare and Lynchburg, Va. In partnership they could clean
  up.</p>

  <p>So there was no question of Searle's departing on Monday morning, nor on
  Tuesday, nor on any specific day in a foreseeable future. He was at Trimmings
  to stay, it seemed. And no one but Emma found any fault with that
  arrangement. Lavinia offered him the use of her Rolls two-seater to take him
  round the country&mdash;it did nothing but lie in the garage, she said, when
  she was working&mdash;but Searle preferred to hire a small cheap car from
  Bill Maddox, who kept the garage at the entrance to the village. 'If I'm
  going nosing up lanes that are not much better than the bed of a stream, some
  of them, I want a car I don't have to hold my breath about,' he said. But Liz
  felt that this was merely a way of declining Lavinia's offer gracefully, and
  liked him for it.</p>

  <p>Bill Maddox reported well of him to the village&mdash;'no airs at all and
  can't be fooled neither; upped with the bonnet and went over her as if he was
  bred to the trade'&mdash;so that by the time he appeared in the Swan with
  Walter of an evening Salcott St Mary knew all about him and were prepared to
  accept him in spite of his reprehensible good looks. The Salcott aliens, of
  course, had no prejudice against good looks and no hesitation whatever in
  accepting him. Toby Tullis took one look at him and straightway forgot his
  royalties, the new comedy he had just finished, the one he had just begun,
  and the infidelity of Christopher Hatton (how had he ever been such a
  half-wit as to trust a creature of a vanity so pathological that he could
  take to himself a name like that!) and made a bee-line for the bench where
  Walter had deposited Searle while he fetched the beer.</p>

  <p>'I think I saw you at Lavinia's party in town,' he said, in his best
  imitation-tentative manner. 'My name is Tullis. I write plays.' The modesty
  of this phrase always enchanted him. It was as if the owner of a
  transcontinental railroad were to say: 'I run trains.'</p>

  <p>'How do you do, Mr Tullis,' said Leslie Searle. 'What kind of plays do you
  write?'</p>

  <p>There was a moment of silence while Tullis got his breath back, and while
  he was still searching for words Walter came up with the beer.</p>

  <p>'Well,' he said, 'I see you have introduced yourselves.'</p>

  <p>'Walter,' said Tullis, deciding on his line and leaning towards Walter
  with empressement, 'I have met him!'</p>

  <p>'Met whom?' asked Walter who always remembered his accusatives.</p>

  <p>'The man who never heard of me. I have met him at last!'</p>

  <p>'And how does it feel?' asked Walter, glancing at Searle and deciding yet
  once again that there was more in Leslie Searle than met the eye.</p>

  <p>'Wonderful, my boy, wonderful. A unique sensation.'</p>

  <p>'If you care, his name is Searle. Leslie Searle. A friend of Cooney
  Wiggin.'</p>

  <p>Walter saw a shadow of doubt cross the fish-grey eye of Toby Tullis and
  followed the thought quite clearly. If this beautiful young man had been a
  friend of the very-international Cooney, then was it possible that he had
  never heard of the even-more-international Toby Tullis? Was it possible that
  the young man was taking him for a ride?</p>

  <p>Walter set the beer mugs down, slid into the seat beside Searle, and
  prepared to enjoy himself.</p>

  <p>Across the room he could see Serge Ratoff glaring at this new piece of
  grouping. Ratoff had at one time been the raison d'être and prospective star
  of an embryo play of Toby Tullis's which was to be called <i>Afternoon</i>
  and was all about a faun. Unfortunately it had suffered considerable changes
  in the processes of birth and had eventually become something called
  <i>Crépuscule</i>, which was all about a little waiter in the Bois, and was
  played by a newcomer with an Austrian name and a Greek temperament. Ratoff
  had never recovered from this 'betrayal'. At first he had drunk himself into
  scintillations of self-pity; then he had drunk to avoid the ache of self-pity
  that filled him when he was sober; then he was sacked because he had become
  independable both at rehearsals and performance; then he reached the ultimate
  stage of a ballet dancer's downfall and ceased even to practise. So that now,
  vaguely but surely, the fatty tissue was blurring the spare tautness. Only
  the furious eyes still had the old life and fire. The eyes still had meaning
  and purpose.</p>

  <p>When Toby ceased to invite him to the house at Salcott, Ratoff had bought
  the old stable next the village shop; a mere lean-to against the shop's gable
  end; and made it into a dwelling for himself. This had proved in a quite
  unexpected way his salvation, for his point of vantage next the only shop in
  the place had turned him from a mere reject of Toby's into a general purveyer
  of gossip to the community, and therefore a person in his own right. The
  villagers, lured by the childish quality in his make-up, treated him without
  the reservation that they used to the other aliens, employing to him the same
  tolerance that they used to their own 'innocents'. He was therefore the only
  person in the village who was equally free of both communities. No one knew
  what he lived on, or if he ever ate, as opposed to drinking. At almost any
  hour of the day he could be found draped in incorrigible grace against the
  post-office counter of the shop, and in the evenings he drank at the Swan
  like the rest of the community.</p>

  <p>In the last few months a rapprochement had taken place between him and
  Toby, and there were rumours that he was even beginning to practise again.
  Now he was glaring at this newcomer to Salcott, this unsmirched unblurred
  radiant newcomer, who had taken Toby's interest. In spite of 'betrayal' and
  downfall, Toby was still his property and his god. Walter thought with a mild
  amusement how scandalised poor Serge would be if he could witness the
  treatment to which his adored Toby was being subjected. Toby had by now
  discovered that Leslie Searle was a fellow who photographed the world's
  celebrities, and was therefore confirmed in his suspicion that Searle had
  known quite well who he was. He was puzzled, not to say wounded. No one had
  been rude to Toby Tullis for at least a decade. But his actor's need to be
  liked was stronger than his resentment, and he was putting forth all his
  charm in an effort to win over this so-unexpected antagonist.</p>

  <p>Sitting watching the charm at work, Walter thought how ineradicable was
  the 'bounder' in a man's personality. When he was a child his friends at
  school had used the word 'bounder' loosely to describe anyone who wore the
  wrong kind of collar. But of course it was not at all like that. What made a
  man a bounder was a quality of mind. A crassness. A lack of sensitivity. It
  was something that was quite incurable; a spiritual astigmatism. And Toby
  Tullis, after all those years, stayed unmistakably a bounder. It was a very
  odd thing. With the possible exception of the Court of St James's, there was
  no door in the world that was not wide open to Toby Tullis. He travelled like
  royalty and was given almost diplomatic privileges; he was dressed by the
  world's best tailors and had acquired the social tricks of the world's best
  people; in everything but essence he was the well-bred man of the world. In
  essence he remained a bounder. Marta Hallard had once said: 'Everything that
  Toby does is just a little off-key,' and that described it very well.</p>

  <p>Looking sideways to see how Searle was taking this odd wooing, Walter was
  delighted to observe a sort of absentmindedness in Searle as he consumed his
  beer. The degree of absentmindedness was beautifully graded, Walter noticed;
  any more would have laid him open to the charge of rudeness and so put him in
  the wrong, any less might not have been obvious enough to sting Tullis. As it
  was, Toby was baffled into trying far too hard and making a fool of himself.
  He did everything but juggle with plates. That anyone should be unimpressed
  by Toby Tullis was a state of affairs not to be borne. He sweated. And Walter
  smiled into his beer, and Leslie Searle was gentle and polite and a little
  absentminded.</p>

  <p>And Serge Ratoff continued to glare from the other side of the room.</p>

  <p>Walter reckoned that he was two drinks short of making a scene, and
  wondered if they should drink up and go, before Serge joined them in a
  torrent of unintelligible English and unfathomable accusations. But the
  person who joined them was not Serge but Silas Weekley.</p>

  <p>Weekley had been watching them from the bar for some time, and now brought
  his beer over to their table and greeted them. He came, as Walter knew, for
  two reasons: because he had a woman's curiosity, and because everything
  beautiful had for him the attraction of the repulsive. Weekley resented
  beauty, and it was not entirely to be held against him that he made a very
  large income indeed out of that resentment. His resentment was quite genuine.
  The world he approved of was, as Liz had said, 'all steaming manure and
  slashing rain'. And not even the clever parodies of his individual style had
  sufficed to ruin his vogue. His lecture tours in America were wild successes,
  not so much because his earnest readers in Peoria and Paduca loved steaming
  manure but because Silas Weekley looked the part so perfectly. He was
  cadaverous, and dark, and tall, and his voice was slow and sibilant and
  hopeless, and all the good ladies of Peoria and Paduca longed to take him
  home and feed him up and give him a brighter outlook on life. In which they
  were a great deal more generous than his English colleagues; who considered
  him an unmitigated bore and a bit of an ass. Lavinia always referred to him
  as 'that tiresome man who always tells you that he was at a board school',
  and held that he was just a little mad. (He, on his part, referred to her as
  'the woman Fitch', as one speaking of a criminal.)</p>

  <p>Weekley had come over to them because he could not keep away from the
  hateful beauty of Leslie Searle, and Walter caught himself wondering if
  Searle knew it. For Searle, who had been all gentle indifference with the
  eager Toby, was now engaged in throwing a rope over the antagonistic Silas.
  Walter, watching the almost feminine dexterity of it, was willing to bet that
  in about fifteen minutes Searle would have Silas roped and hog-tied. He
  glanced at the big bland clock behind the bar and decided to time him.</p>

  <p>Searle did it with five minutes to spare. In ten minutes he had Weekley,
  resentful and struggling, a prisoner in his toils. And the bewilderment in
  Weekley's sunken eyes was greater than ever the bewilderment in Toby's
  fish-scale ones had been. Walter nearly laughed aloud.</p>

  <p>And then Searle put the final touch of comedy to the act. At a moment when
  both Silas and Toby were doing their rival best to be entertaining, Searle
  said in his quiet drawl: 'Do forgive me, won't you, but I see a friend of
  mine,' and got up without haste and walked away to join the friend at the
  bar. The friend was Bill Maddox, the garage keeper.</p>

  <p>Walter buried his face in his beer mug and enjoyed the faces of his
  friends.</p>

  <p>It was only afterwards, rolling it over in his mind to savour it, that a
  vague discomfort pricked him. The fun had been so bland, so lightly handled,
  that its essential quality, its ruthlessness, had not been apparent.</p>

  <p>At the moment he was merely amused by the typical reactions of Searle's
  two victims. Silas Weekley gulped down what was left of his beer, pushed the
  mug away from him with a gesture of self-disgust, and went out of the pub
  without a word. He was like a man fleeing from the memory of some frowsy
  back-room embrace; a man sickened by his own succumbing. Walter wondered for
  a moment if Lavinia could possibly be right, and Weekley was after all a
  little mad.</p>

  <p>Toby Tullis, on the other hand, had never known either retreat or
  self-disgust. Toby was merely deploying his forces for further
  campaigning.</p>

  <p>'A little farouche, your young friend,' he remarked, his eye on Searle as
  he talked to Bill Maddox at the bar.</p>

  <p>Farouche was the last word that Walter would have used of Leslie Searle
  but he understood that Toby must justify his temporary overthrow.</p>

  <p>'You must bring him to see Hoo House.'</p>

  <p>Hoo House was the beautiful stone building that stood so unexpectedly in
  Salcott's row of pink and cream and yellow gables. It had once been an inn;
  and before that, it was said, its stones had been part of an abbey farther
  down the valley. Now it was a show-piece of a quality so rare that Toby, who
  normally changed his dwelling-place (one could hardly say his home) every
  second year, had refused all offers for it for several years now.</p>

  <p>'Is he staying long with you?'</p>

  <p>Walter said that he and Searle planned to do a book together. They had not
  yet decided on the form of it.</p>

  <p>'Gipsying Through Orfordshire?'</p>

  <p>'Something like that. I do the spiel and Searle does the illustrations. We
  haven't thought of a good central theme yet.'</p>

  <p>'A little early in the year to go gipsying.'</p>

  <p>'Good for photography, though. Before the county becomes clotted with
  greenery.'</p>

  <p>'Perhaps your young friend would like to photograph Hoo House,' Toby said,
  picking up the two mugs and moving with admirable casualness to the bar with
  them.</p>

  <p>Walter stayed where he was and wondered how many drinks Serge Ratoff had
  had since last he noticed him. He had been only two short of a row then, he
  had reckoned. Now he must be almost at explosion point.</p>

  <p>Toby put the mugs on the counter, entered first into conversation with the
  landlord, then with Bill Maddox, and so quite naturally with Searle again. It
  was dexterously done.</p>

  <p>'You must come and see Hoo House,' Walter heard him say presently. 'It is
  very beautiful. You might even like to photograph it.'</p>

  <p>'Has it not been photographed?' asked Searle, surprised. It was quite an
  innocent surprise; an astonishment that a thing so beautiful should be
  unrecorded. But what it conveyed to his hearers was: 'Is it possible that any
  facet of Toby Tullis's life has remained unpublicised?'</p>

  <p>This was the spark that ignited Serge.</p>

  <p>'<i>Yes</i>!' he shrieked, shooting out of his corner like a squib and
  sticking his furious small face within an inch of Searle's, 'it has been
  photographed! It has been photographed ten thousand times by the greatest
  photographers in the world and it does not need to be made cheap by any
  stupid amateur from a country that was stolen from the Indians even if he has
  a profile and dyed hair and no morals and a&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Serge!' said Toby, 'shut up!'</p>

  <p>But the wild babble poured out of Serge's ravaged face without a
  pause.</p>

  <p>'Serge! Do you hear! Stop it!' Toby said, and pushed Ratoff lightly on the
  shoulder so as to urge him away from Searle.</p>

  <p>This was the final touch, and Serge's voice rose into one high continuous
  stream of vituperation, most of it couched in mercifully unintelligible
  English but spattered liberally with phrases in French or Spanish and studded
  here and there with epithets and descriptions of a freshness that was
  delightful. 'You middle-west Lucifer!' was one of the better ones.</p>

  <p>As Toby's hand took him by the back of the collar to drag him away from
  Searle by force, Serge's arm shot out to where Toby's new-filled beer mug was
  waiting on the counter. He reached it a split second before Reeve, the
  landlord, could save it, grabbed it, and launched the whole contents into
  Searle's face. Searle's head moved sideways by instinct, so that the beer
  streamed over his neck and shoulder. Screaming with baffled rage, Serge
  lifted the heavy mug above his head to fling it, but Reeve's large hand
  closed on his wrist, the mug was prised out of his convulsive clutch, and
  Reeve said: 'Arthur!'</p>

  <p>There was no chucker-out at the Swan, since there had never been any need
  for one. But when any persuading had to be done, Arthur Tebbetts did it.
  Arthur was cattleman up at Silverlace Farm, and he was a large, slow, kind
  creature who would go out of his way to avoid treading on a worm.</p>

  <p>'Come now, Mr Ratoff,' Arthur said, enveloping with his Saxon bulk the
  small struggling cosmopolitan. 'There's no call to get fussed over little
  things. It's that there gin, Mr Ratoff. I've told you afore. That ain't no
  drink for a man, Mr Ratoff. Now you come with me, and see if you don't feel
  the better of a dose of fresh air. See if you don't.'</p>

  <p>Serge had no intention of going anywhere with anyone. He wanted to stay
  and murder this newcomer to Salcott. But there was never any successful
  argument against Arthur's methods. Arthur just put a friendly arm round one
  and leaned. The arm was like a limb of a beech tree, and the pressure was
  that of a landslide. Serge went with him to the door under pressure, and they
  went out together. Not for one moment had Serge stopped his torrent of
  accusation and offence, and not once as far as anyone knew had he repeated
  himself.</p>

  <p>As the high babbling voice died into the outer air, the onlookers stirred
  into relief and conversation again.</p>

  <p>'Gentlemen,' said Toby Tullis, 'I apologise on behalf of the Theatre.'</p>

  <p>But it was not said lightly enough. Instead of being an actor's gay
  smoothing over of an awkward moment, it was Toby Tullis reminding them that
  he spoke for the English Theatre. As Marta had said: everything that Toby did
  was a little off-key. There was a murmur of amusement, but if anything his
  speech added to the village's embarrassment.</p>

  <p>The landlord mopped Searle's shoulder with a glass-cloth, and begged him
  to come in behind and his missus would take some clean water to his suit and
  get the smell of the beer off it before it dried in. But Searle refused. He
  was quite amiable about it but seemed to want to get out of the place. Walter
  thought that he was looking a little sick.</p>

  <p>They said good-evening to Toby, who was still explaining Serge's
  temperament in terms of the Theatre, and went out into the sweet evening.</p>

  <p>'Does he often sound off like that?' Searle asked.</p>

  <p>'Ratoff? He has made scenes before, yes, but never such a violent one.
  I've never known him use physical means before.'</p>

  <p>They met Arthur, returning to his interrupted beer, and Walter asked what
  had become of the disturber.</p>

  <p>'He run away home,' Arthur said with his large smile. 'Went off like an
  arrow from a bow. He could beat a hare, that one.' And went back to his
  drink.</p>

  <p>'It's early for dinner yet,' Walter said. 'Let us walk home by the river
  and up by the field-path. I am sorry about the row, but I expect that in your
  job you are used to temperaments.'</p>

  <p>'Well, I have been called things, of course, but so far nothing has
  actually been flung at me.'</p>

  <p>'I dare swear no one ever thought of calling you a middle-west Lucifer
  before. Poor Serge.' Walter paused to lean on the bridge below the Mill
  House, and look at the reflection of the afterglow in the waters of the
  Rushmere. 'Perhaps the old saying is true and it is not possible to love and
  be wise. When you are as devoted to anyone as Serge is to Toby Tullis, I
  expect you cease to be sane about the matter.'</p>

  <p>'Sane,' said Searle sharply.</p>

  <p>'Yes; things lose their proper proportions. Which, I take it, is a loss of
  sanity.'</p>

  <p>Searle was quiet for a long time, staring at the smooth water as it
  flooded so slowly towards the bridge and then was flicked under it with the
  sudden hysteria of water sucked round obstacles in its path.</p>

  <p>'Sane,' he repeated, watching the place where the water lost control and
  was sucked under the culvert.</p>

  <p>'I'm not suggesting the fellow is mad,' Walter said. 'He has just lost
  hold of common sense.'</p>

  <p>'And is common sense so desirable a quality?'</p>

  <p>'An admirable quality.'</p>

  <p>'Nothing great ever came out of common sense,' Searle said.</p>

  <p>'On the contrary. Lack of common sense is responsible for practically
  every ill in life. Everything from wars to not moving up in the bus. I see
  there is a light in the Mill House. Marta must be back.'</p>

  <p>They looked up at the pale bulk of the house glowing in the half-dark as a
  pale flower glows. A single light, still bright yellow in what was left of
  the daylight, starred the side that looked on the river.</p>

  <p>'A light the way Liz likes them,' Searle said.</p>

  <p>'Liz?'</p>

  <p>'She likes them golden like that in the daylight. Before the dark turns
  them white.'</p>

  <p>For the first time Walter was forced into considering Searle in relation
  to Liz. It had not crossed his mind until now to consider them in relation to
  each other at all, since he was not in the least possessive about Liz. This
  unpossessiveness might have been accounted to him for virtue if it had not
  sprung directly from the fact that he took her for granted. If by some method
  of hypnotism the last dregs of Walter's subconscious could have been dragged
  to the surface, it would have been found that he thought that Liz was doing
  very well for herself. Even the shadow of such a thought would have shocked
  Walter's conscious mind, of course; but since he was entirely
  unself-analytical and largely unselfconscious (a quality that enabled him to
  perpetrate the broadcasts which so revolted Marta and endeared him to the
  British public), the farthest his conscious mind went was to hold it
  gratifying and proper that Liz should love him.</p>

  <p>He had known Liz so long that she had no surprises for him. He took it for
  granted that he knew everything about Liz. But he had not known a simple
  little fact like her pleasure in lights in the daytime.</p>

  <p>And Searle, the newcomer, had learned that.</p>

  <p>And, what was more, remembered it.</p>

  <p>A faint ripple stirred the flat waters of Walter's self-satisfaction.</p>

  <p>'Have you met Marta Hallard?' he asked.</p>

  <p>'No.'</p>

  <p>'We must remedy that.'</p>

  <p>'I have seen her act, of course.'</p>

  <p>'Oh. In what?'</p>

  <p>'A play called <i>Walk in Darkness</i>.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, yes. She was good in that. One of her best parts, I think,' Walter
  said, and dropped the subject. He did not want to talk about <i>Walk in
  Darkness</i>. <i>Walk in Darkness</i> might be a Hallard memory, but it was
  one that held also Marguerite Merriam.</p>

  <p>'I suppose we couldn't drop in now?' Searle said, looking up at the
  light.</p>

  <p>'It's a little too near dinner time, I think. Marta isn't the kind of
  person you drop in on very easily. That, I suspect, is why she chose the
  isolated Mill House.'</p>

  <p>'Perhaps Liz could take me down and present me tomorrow.'</p>

  <p>Walter had nearly said: 'Why Liz?' when he remembered that tomorrow was
  Friday, and that he would be away all day in town. Friday was broadcast day.
  Searle had remembered that he would not be here tomorrow although he himself
  had forgotten. Another ripple stirred.</p>

  <p>'Yes. Or we might ask her up to dinner. She likes good food. Well, I
  suppose we had better be getting along.'</p>

  <p>But Searle did not move. He was looking up the avenue of willows that
  bordered the flat pewter surface of the darkening water.</p>

  <p>'I've got it!' he said.</p>

  <p>'Got what?'</p>

  <p>'The theme. The connecting link. The motif.'</p>

  <p>'For the book, you mean?'</p>

  <p>'Yes. The river. The Rushmere. Why didn't we think of that before?'</p>

  <p>'The river! Yes! Why didn't we? I suppose because it isn't entirely an
  Orfordshire river. But of course it is the perfect solution. It has been done
  repeatedly for the Thames, and for the Severn. I don't see why it shouldn't
  work with the smaller Rushmere.'</p>

  <p>'Would it give us the variety we need for the book?'</p>

  <p>'Indubitably,' said Walter. 'It couldn't be better. It rises in that hilly
  country, all sheep and stone walls and sharp outlines; then there's the
  pastoral bit with beautiful farm houses, and great barns, and English trees
  at their best, and village churches like cathedrals; and then Wickham, the
  essence of English market towns, where the villein that marched from the town
  cross to speak to King Richard in London is the same man that prods today's
  heifer on to the train on its way to the Argentine.' Walter's hand stole up
  to the breast pocket where he kept his notebook, but fell away again. 'Then
  the marshes. You know: skeins of geese against an evening sky. Great
  cloudscapes and shivering grasses. Then the port: Mere Harbour. Almost Dutch.
  A complete contrast to the county at its back. A town full of lovely
  individual building, and a harbour full of fishing and coastwise traffic.
  Gulls, and reflections, and gables. Searle, it's perfect!'</p>

  <p>'When do we start?'</p>

  <p>'Well, first, how do we do it?'</p>

  <p>'Will this thing take a boat?'</p>

  <p>'Only a punt. Or a skiff where it widens below the bridge.'</p>

  <p>'A punt,' Searle said doubtfully. 'That's one of those flat duck-shooting
  things.'</p>

  <p>'Approximately.'</p>

  <p>'That doesn't sound very handy. It had better be canoes.'</p>

  <p>'Canoes!'</p>

  <p>'Yes. Can you manage one?'</p>

  <p>'I've paddled one round an ornamental pond when I was a child. That's
  all.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, well, at least you've got the hang of it. You'll soon remember the
  drill. How far up could we start, with canoes? Man, it's a wonderful idea. It
  even gives us our title. "<i>Canoes on the Rushmere.</i>" A title with a nice
  swing to it. Like "<i>Drums Along the Mohawk.</i>" Or "<i>Oil for the Lamps
  of China</i>".'</p>

  <p>'We shall have to tramp the first bit of it. The sheep-country bit. Down
  to about Otley. I expect the stream will take a canoe at Otley. Though, God
  help me, I don't anticipate being much at home in a canoe. We can carry a
  small pack from the source of the river&mdash;it's a spring in the middle of
  a field, I've always understood&mdash;down to Otley or Capel, and from there
  to the sea we canoe. "<i>Canoes on the Rushmere</i>". Yes, it sounds all
  right. When I go up to town tomorrow I'll go and see Cormac Ross and put the
  proposition to him and see what he is moved to offer. If he doesn't like it,
  I have half a dozen more who will jump at it. But Ross is in Lavinia's
  pocket, so we might as well make use of him if he will play.'</p>

  <p>'Of course he will,' Searle said. 'You're practically royalty in this
  country, aren't you!'</p>

  <p>If there was any feeling in the gibe it was not apparent.</p>

  <p>'I should really offer it to Debham's,' Walter said. 'They did my book
  about farm life. But I quarrelled with them about the illustrations. They
  were dreadful, and the book didn't sell.'</p>

  <p>'That was before you took to the air, I infer.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, yes.' Walter pushed himself off the bridge and began to walk towards
  the field-path and dinner. 'They did refuse my poems, after the farm book, so
  I can use that as a get-out.'</p>

  <p>'You write poems too?'</p>

  <p>'Who doesn't?'</p>

  <p>'I for one.'</p>

  <p>'Clod!' said Walter amiably.</p>

  <p>And they went back to discussing the ways and means of their progress down
  the Rushmere.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch05"
     id="ch05"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

  <p class="first">'COME up to town with me and see Ross,' Walter said at
  breakfast next morning.</p>

  <p>But Searle wanted to stay in the country. It was blasphemy, he said, to
  spend even one day in London with the English countryside bursting into its
  first green. Besides, he did not know Ross. It would be better if Walter put
  the proposition to Ross first, and brought him into the business later.</p>

  <p>And Walter, though disappointed, did not stop to analyse the exact quality
  of his disappointment.</p>

  <p>But as he drove up to town his mind was much less occupied than usual with
  the matter of his broadcast, and a great deal oftener than usual it strayed
  back to Trimmings.</p>

  <p>He went to see Ross and laid before him the plans for <i>Canoes on the
  Rushmere</i>. Ross professed himself delighted and allowed himself to be
  beaten up an extra 2½ per cent on a provisional agreement. But of course
  nothing could be settled, he pointed out, until he had consulted
  Cromarty.</p>

  <p>It was popularly supposed that Ross had taken Cromarty into partnership
  for the fun of it; as a matter of euphony. He had been doing quite well for
  himself as Cormac Ross, as far as anyone could judge, and there seemed on the
  surface no reason to rope in a partner; more especially a partner as
  colourless as Cromarty. But Cormac Ross had sufficient West Highland blood in
  him to find it difficult to say no. He liked to be liked. So he engaged
  Cromarty as his smoke-screen. When an author could be received with open
  arms, the open arms were Cormac Ross's. When an author had regretfully to be
  turned down it was on account of Cromarty's intransigeance. Cromarty had once
  said to Ross in a fit of temper: 'You might at least let me <i>see</i> the
  books I turn down!' But that was an extreme case. Normally Cromarty did read
  the books that he was going to be responsible for rejecting.</p>

  <p>Now, faced with the offer of a book by the British Public's current
  darling, Ross used the automatic phrase about consulting his partner; but his
  round pink face shone with satisfaction, and he bore Walter off to lunch and
  bought him a bottle of Romanée-Conti; which was wasted on Walter, who liked
  beer.</p>

  <p>So, full of good burgundy and the prospect of cheques to come, Walter went
  on to the studio and his mind once more began to play tricks on him and run
  away back to Salcott instead of staying delightedly in the studio as was its
  habit.</p>

  <p>For half of his weekly time on the air Walter always had a guest. Someone
  connected with the Open Air; a commodity in which Walter had lately taken so
  much stock as to make it a virtual Whitmore monopoly. Walter compèred the
  Open Air in the shape of a poacher, a sheep farmer from the back blocks of
  Australia, a bird watcher, a keeper from Sutherland, an earnest female who
  went round pushing acorns into roadside banks, a young dilettante who hunted
  with a hawk, and anyone else who happened to be both handy and willing. For
  the latter half of his time Walter merely talked.</p>

  <p>Today his guest was a child who kept a tame fox, and Walter was dismayed
  to find himself disliking the brat. Walter loved his guests. He felt warm and
  protective and all-brothers-together about them; he never loved mankind so
  largely or so well as when he and his guests were talking together in his
  Half Hour. He loved them to the point of tears. And now it upset him to feel
  detached and critical about Harold Dibbs and his silly fox. Harold had a
  sadly under-developed jaw, he noticed, and looked regrettably like a fox
  himself. Perhaps the fox had stayed with him because it had felt at home. He
  felt guilty about having had this thought and tried to compensate by giving
  his voice more warmth than it would carry, so that his interest had a forced
  note. Harold and his fox were Walter's first failure.</p>

  <p>Nor was the talk successful enough to blot out the memory of Harold. The
  talk was about 'What Earthworms do for England'. The 'for England' was a
  typical Whitmore touch. Other men might speak on the place of the Earthworm
  in Nature, and no one cared two hoots either about Nature or earthworms. But
  Walter pinned his worm on to a Shakespearean hook and angled gently with it,
  so that his listeners saw the seething legions of blind purpose turning the
  grey rock in the western sea into the green Paradise that was England. There
  would be fifty-seven letters tomorrow morning by the first available post
  from north of the Border, of course, to point out that Scotland too had her
  earthworms. But this was just so much additional evidence of Walter's
  drawing-power.</p>

  <p>It was Walter's secret habit to speak to one particular person when
  broadcasting; a trick which helped him to achieve that unselfconscious
  friendliness which was his trade-mark. It was never a real person; nor did he
  ever visualise his imaginary hearer in detail. He merely decided that today
  he would talk to 'an old lady in Leeds', or 'a little girl in hospital in
  Bridgwater', or 'a lighthouse-keeper in Scotland'. Today for the first time
  he thought of speaking to Liz. Liz always listened to his broadcast, and he
  took it for granted that she would listen, but his imaginary listener was so
  much a part of his act that it had never occurred to him before to use Liz as
  the person he talked to. Now, today, some obscure need to bind Liz closely to
  him, to make sure that she was there, blotted out his 'pretence' listener,
  and he talked to Liz.</p>

  <p>But it was not the success it should have been. The mere recollection of
  Liz wooed his mind from the script, so that he remembered last night by the
  river, and the darkening willows, and the single golden star in the side of
  the Mill House. A daffodil-pale light, 'the way Liz liked them'. And his
  attention wandered from the worms and from England and he stumbled over the
  words, so that the illusion of spontaneity was lost.</p>

  <p>Puzzled and a little annoyed, but still not greatly disturbed, he signed
  the autograph books that had been sent to the studio for that purpose,
  decided what was to be done in the case of (<i>a</i>) a request for his
  presence at a christening, (<i>b</i>) a request for one of his ties,
  (<i>c</i>) nineteen requests to appear on his programme, and (<i>d</i>) seven
  requests for financial loans; and turned his face homewards. As an
  afterthought he turned back and bought a pound boot of chocolate dragées for
  Liz. As he tucked it into the glove compartment it occurred to him that it
  must be some time since he took Liz something on his way home. It was a
  pleasant habit; he must do it more often.</p>

  <p>It was only when the traffic dropped behind him, and the Roman directness
  of the arterial highway stretched uneventful in front of him that his mind
  went past Liz to the thing her image was hiding: Searle. Searle. Poor Serge's
  'middle-west Lucifer'. Why Lucifer, he wondered? Lucifer, Prince of the
  Morning. He had always pictured Lucifer as a magnificent, burning figure
  six-and-a-half feet tall. Not at all like Searle. What in Searle had
  suggested Lucifer to Ratoff's accusing mind?</p>

  <p>Lucifer. A fallen glory. A beauty turned evil.</p>

  <p>He saw in his mind a picture of the Searle who walked round the farm with
  him; his hatless blond hair blown into untidy ends by the wind, his hands
  pushed deep into very English flannels. Lucifer. He nearly laughed aloud.</p>

  <p>But there was, of course, a strangeness in Searle's good looks.
  A&mdash;what was it?&mdash;an unplaceable quality. Something not quite of the
  world of men.</p>

  <p>Perhaps that was what had suggested fallen angels to Serge's fertile
  mind.</p>

  <p>Anyhow, Searle seemed a good chap, and they were going to do a book
  together; and Searle knew that he was engaged to marry Liz, so that he would
  not&mdash;</p>

  <p>He did not finish the thought, even to himself. Nor did it occur to him to
  wonder how a beauty that made one think of fallen angels was likely to affect
  a young woman engaged to a B.B.C. commentator.</p>

  <p>He drove home at a better speed than normally, put away the car, took
  Liz's favourite sweets out of their place in the glove compartment, and went
  in to present them and be kissed for his forethought. He was also the bearer
  of the good news that Cormac Ross liked the idea of the book and was prepared
  to pay them well for it. He could hardly wait to reach the drawing-room.</p>

  <p>The baronial hall was very silent and cold as he crossed it, and it
  smelled, in spite of anachronistic baize doors, of sprouts and stewed
  rhubarb. In the drawing-room, which as usual was warm and gay, there was no
  one but Lavinia, who was sitting with her feet on the fender and her lap
  covered with that day's issue of the highbrow weeklies.</p>

  <p>'It's a strange thing,' said Lavinia, taking her nose out of the
  <i>Watchman</i>, 'how immoral it is to make money out of writing.'</p>

  <p>'Hullo, Aunt Vin. Where are the others?'</p>

  <p>'This rag used to worship Silas Weekley until he went and made himself a
  fortune. Em is upstairs, I think. The others aren't back yet.'</p>

  <p>'Back? Back from where?'</p>

  <p>'I don't know. They went out in that dreadful little car of Bill Maddox's
  after lunch.'</p>

  <p>'After <i>lunch</i>.'</p>

  <p>'"The slick repetition of a technique as lacking in subtlety as a poster."
  Don't they make you sick! Yes, I didn't need Liz this afternoon, so they went
  out. It has been a glorious day, hasn't it?'</p>

  <p>'But it is only ten minutes till dinner time!'</p>

  <p>'Yes. Looks as though they're going to be late,' said Lavinia, her eyes
  pursuing the slaughter of Silas.</p>

  <p>So Liz hadn't heard the broadcast! He had been talking to her and she
  hadn't even been listening. He was dumbfounded. The fact that the old lady in
  Leeds, and the child in the hospital in Bridgwater, and the lighthouse-keeper
  in Scotland hadn't been listening either made no difference. Liz
  <i>always</i> listened. It was her business to listen. He was Walter, her
  fiancé, and if he spoke to the world it was right that she should listen. And
  now she had gone out gaily with Leslie Searle and left him talking into thin
  air. She had gone out gadding without a thought, on a Friday, on his
  broadcast afternoon, gone out God knew where, with Searle, with a fellow she
  had known only seven days, and they stayed out to the very last minute. She
  wasn't even there to have chocolates given her when he had gone out of his
  way to get them for her. It was monstrous.</p>

  <p>Then the vicar arrived. No one had remembered that he was coming to
  dinner. He was that kind of man. And Walter had to spend another fifteen
  minutes with earthworms when he had already had more than enough of them. The
  vicar had listened to his broadcast and was enchanted by it; he could talk of
  nothing else.</p>

  <p>Mrs Garrowby came in, greeted the vicar with commendable presence of mind,
  and went away to arrange for a supplement of tinned peas to the entrée and a
  pastry covering for the stewed rhubarb.</p>

  <p>By the time that the missing pair were twenty minutes late and Mrs
  Garrowby had decided not to wait for them, Walter had changed his attitude
  and decided that Liz was dead. She would never be late for dinner. She was
  lying dead in a ditch somewhere. Perhaps with the car on top of her. Searle
  was an American and it was well-known that all Americans were reckless
  drivers and had no patience with English lanes. They had probably gone round
  a corner slap into something.</p>

  <p>He played with his soup, his heart black with dread, and listened to the
  vicar on demonology. He had heard at one time or another everything that the
  vicar had to say on the subject of demonology, but at least it was a relief
  to get away from worms.</p>

  <p>Just when his heart had blackened and shrunk to the state of a very old
  mushroom, the gay voices of Searle and Liz could be heard in the hall. They
  came in breathless and radiant. Full of off-hand apology for their lateness
  and commendation for the family in that they had not kept dinner back for
  them. Liz presented Searle to the vicar but did not think of casting any
  special word to Walter before falling on her soup like a starving refugee.
  They had been all over the place, they said; first they had viewed Twells
  Abbey, and adjacent villages; then they had met Peter Massie and had gone to
  look at his horses and given him a lift into Crome; then they had had tea at
  the Star and Garter in Crome, and they had been on the way home out of Crome
  when they found a cinema which was showing <i>The Great Train Robbery</i>,
  and it was of course not in anyone's power to refuse a chance of viewing
  <i>The Great Train Robbery</i>. They had had to sit through several modern
  exhibits before <i>The Great Train Robbery</i> appeared&mdash;which was what
  had made them late&mdash;but it had been worth waiting for.</p>

  <p>An account of <i>The Great Train Robbery</i> occupied most of the fish
  course.</p>

  <p>'How was the broadcast, Walter?' Liz said, reaching for some bread.</p>

  <p>It was bad enough that she did not say: 'I am desolated to have missed
  your broadcast, Walter'; but that she should spare for the broadcast only the
  part of her mind that was not occupied with the replenishing of her bread
  plate was the last straw.</p>

  <p>'The vicar will tell you,' said Walter. '<i>He</i> listened.'</p>

  <p>The vicar told them, <i>con amore</i>. Neither Liz nor Leslie Searle,
  Walter noticed, really listened. Once, during the recital, Liz met Searle's
  glance as she passed him something and gave him her quick friendly smile.
  They were very pleased with themselves, with each other, and with the day
  they had had.</p>

  <p>'What did Ross say about the book?' Searle asked, when the vicar had at
  last run down.</p>

  <p>'He was delighted with the idea,' Walter said, wishing passionately that
  he had never begun this partnership with Searle.</p>

  <p>'Have you heard what they plan, Vicar?' Mrs Garrowby said. 'They are going
  to write a book about the Rushmere. From its source to the sea. Walter is
  going to write it and Mr Searle to illustrate it.'</p>

  <p>The vicar approved of the idea and pointed out its classic form. Was it to
  be on shanks's mare or with a donkey, he asked.</p>

  <p>'On foot down to Otley, or thereabouts,' Walter said. 'And by water from
  there.'</p>

  <p>'By water? But the Rushmere is full of snags in its early reaches,' the
  vicar said.</p>

  <p>They told him about the canoes. The vicar thought canoes a sensible craft
  for a river like the Rushmere, but wondered where they could be got.</p>

  <p>'I talked to Cormac Ross about that today,' Walter said, 'and he suggested
  that Kilner's, the small craft builders at Mere Harbour, might have some.
  They build for all over the world. It was Joe Kilner who designed that
  collapsible raft-boat-tent that Mansell took up the Orinoco on his last trip,
  and then said afterwards that if he had thought in time he could have made it
  a glider too. I was going to suggest that Searle and I should go over to Mere
  Harbour tomorrow and see Kilner&mdash;if he has no other plans.'</p>

  <p>'Fine,' Searle said. 'Fine.'</p>

  <p>Then the vicar asked Searle if he fished. Searle did not, but the vicar
  did. The vicar's other interest, a short head behind demonology, was the dry
  fly. So for the rest of dinner they listened to the vicar on flies, with the
  detached interest that they might bring to cement-mixing, or gum-chewing, or
  turning the heel of a sock; a subject of academic interest only. And each of
  them used the unoccupied half of their minds in their own fashion.</p>

  <p>Walter decided that he would leave the little white packet of chocolates
  on the hall table, where he had dropped it as he went in to dinner, until Liz
  asked about it; when he would tell her casually what it was. She would be
  full of compunction, he decided, that he had thought of her while she had
  entirely forgotten him.</p>

  <p>As they walked out of the dining-room he glanced sideways to make sure
  that the little packet was still there. It certainly was. But Liz, too, it
  seemed, had dropped something on the table on her way in to dinner. A great
  flat box of candy from the most expensive confectioners in Crome. Four pounds
  weight at the very least. 'Confits,' it said in dull gold freehand across its
  cream surface, and it was tied up with yards of broad ribbon finished in a
  most extravagant bow. Walter considered the 'confits' affected and the ribbon
  deplorably ostentatious. The whole thing was in the worst of taste. So like
  an American to buy something large and showy. It made him quite sick to look
  at it.</p>

  <p>What made him sick, of course, was not the box of candy.</p>

  <p>He was sick of an emotion that was old before candy was invented.</p>

  <p>As he poured brandy for Searle, the vicar and himself to drink with their
  coffee he looked round in his mind for comfort, and found it.</p>

  <p>Searle might give her boxes of expensive sweetmeats, but it was he,
  Walter, who knew what her favourite sweets were.</p>

  <p>Or&mdash;did Searle know that too? Perhaps the Crome confectioner didn't
  happen to have dragées.</p>

  <p>He tilted the brandy bottle again. He needed an extra spot tonight.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch06"
     id="ch06"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

  <p class="first">IF Emma Garrowby could ever be said to be glad of any
  connection of Leslie Searle with Trimmings, she was glad of the plan for the
  book. It would take him away from the household for the rest of his stay in
  Orfordshire; and once the Rushmere trip was over he would go away and they
  would see no more of him. No harm had been done so far, that she could see.
  Liz liked being with the creature, of course, because they were both young
  and because they seemed to laugh at the same things and because, naturally,
  he was attractive to look at. But she showed no signs of being seriously
  attracted. She never looked at Searle unless she had something to say to him;
  never followed him with her eyes as girls in love did, never sat near him in
  a room.</p>

  <p>For all her apprehensiveness, Emma Garrowby was an imperceptive woman.</p>

  <p>It was the semi-detached Lavinia, oddly enough, who observed and was
  troubled. The trouble welled up and overflowed into words, almost against her
  will, some seven days later. She was dictating as usual to Liz, but was
  making heavy weather of it. This was so rare that Liz was puzzled. Lavinia
  wrote her books with great ease, being genuinely interested in the fate of
  her current heroine. She might not remember afterwards whether it was Daphne
  or Valerie who had met her lover when she was gathering violets in the dawn
  on Capri, but while Daphne (or Valerie) had been in the process of that
  meeting and that gathering Lavinia Fitch watched over her like a godmother.
  Now, contrary to all precedent, she was distrait and had great difficulty in
  remembering even what Sylvia looked like.</p>

  <p>'Where was I, Liz, where was I?' she said, striding up and down the room;
  a pencil stuck through the bird's-nest mop of sandy hair and another being
  chewed to pulp between her sharp little teeth.</p>

  <p>'Sylvia is coming in from the garden. Through the French window.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, yes. "Sylvia paused in the window, her slim form outlined against the
  light, her large blue eyes wary and doubtful&mdash;"'</p>

  <p>'Brown,' said Liz.</p>

  <p>'What?'</p>

  <p>'Her eyes.' Liz flipped back some pages of the script. 'Page 59. "Her
  brown eyes, limpid as rainpools lying on autumn leaves&mdash;"'</p>

  <p>'All right, all right. "&mdash;her large brown eyes wary and doubtful.
  With a graceful movement of resolution she stepped into the room, her tiny
  heels tapping lightly on the parquet floor&mdash;"'</p>

  <p>'No heels.'</p>

  <p>'What d'you say?'</p>

  <p>'No heels.'</p>

  <p>'Why not?'</p>

  <p>'She has just been playing tennis.'</p>

  <p>'She could have changed, couldn't she?' Lavinia said with a touch of
  asperity that was foreign to her.</p>

  <p>'I don't think so,' Liz said patiently. 'She is still carrying her racket.
  She came along the terrace "swinging her racket lightly".'</p>

  <p>'Oh. <i>Did</i> she!' Lavinia said explosively. 'I bet she can't even
  <i>play</i>! Where was I? "She stepped into the room&mdash;she stepped into
  the room, her white frock fluttering"&mdash;no; no, wait&mdash;"she stepped
  into the room"&mdash;Oh, <i>damn</i> Sylvia!' she burst out, flinging her
  chewed pencil on to the desk. 'Who cares what the silly moron does! Let her
  stay in the blasted window and starve!'</p>

  <p>'What is the matter, Aunt Vin?'</p>

  <p>'I can't concentrate.'</p>

  <p>'Are you worried about something?'</p>

  <p>'No. Yes. No. At least, yes, I suppose I am, in a way.'</p>

  <p>'Can I help?'</p>

  <p>Lavinia ran her fingers through the bird's-nest, found the pencil there,
  and looked gratified. 'Why, <i>there's</i> my yellow pencil.' She put it back
  again in her hair-do. 'Liz, dear, don't think me interfering or anything,
  will you, but you're not by any chance getting a little&mdash;a little
  <i>smitten</i> with Leslie Searle, are you?'</p>

  <p>Liz thought how like her aunt it was to use an out-of-date Edwardianism
  like 'smitten'. She was always having to modernise Lavinia's slang for
  her.</p>

  <p>'If by "smitten" you mean in love with him, be comforted. I'm not.'</p>

  <p>'I don't know that that's what I do mean. You don't love a magnet, if it
  comes to that.'</p>

  <p>'A what! What are you talking about?'</p>

  <p>'It isn't a falling in love, so much. It's an attraction. He fascinates
  you, doesn't he.' She made it a statement, not a question.</p>

  <p>Liz looked up at the troubled childish eyes, and hedged. 'Why should you
  think that?' she asked.</p>

  <p>'I suppose because I feel it too,' Lavinia said.</p>

  <p>This was so unexpected that Liz had no words.</p>

  <p>'I wish now I had never asked him down to Trimmings,' Lavinia said
  miserably. 'I know it isn't his fault&mdash;it isn't anything he
  <i>does</i>&mdash;but there's no denying that he is an upsetting person.
  There's Serge and Toby Tullis not on speaking terms&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'That is nothing new!'</p>

  <p>'No, but they <i>had</i> become friends again, and Serge was behaving
  quite well and working, and now&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'You can hardly blame Leslie Searle for that. It would have happened
  inevitably. You know it would.'</p>

  <p>'And it <i>was</i> very odd the way Marta took him back with her after
  dinner the other night and kept him till all hours. I mean the way she
  <i>appropriated</i> him as her escort, without waiting to see what the others
  were doing.'</p>

  <p>'But the vicar was there to see Miss Easton-Dixon home. Marta knew that.
  It was natural that he should go with Miss Dixon; they live in the same
  direction.'</p>

  <p>'It wasn't what she did, it was the way she did it. She&mdash;she
  <i>grabbed</i>.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, that is just Marta's lordly way.'</p>

  <p>'Nonsense. She felt it too. The&mdash;the fascination.'</p>

  <p>'Of course, he is exceedingly attractive,' Liz said; and thought how
  utterly the cliché failed to convey any quality of Leslie Searle's.</p>

  <p>'He is&mdash;uncanny,' Lavinia said, unhappily. 'There is no other word.
  You wait and watch for the next thing he is going to do, as if it
  were&mdash;as if it were a sign, or a portent, or a revelation, or
  something.' She used the 'you' impersonally, but caught Liz's eye and said
  challengingly: 'Well, you <i>do</i>, don't you!'</p>

  <p>'Yes,' Liz said. 'Yes, I suppose it is like that. As if&mdash;as if the
  smallest thing he does had significance.'</p>

  <p>Lavinia picked up the chewed pencil from the desk and doodled with it on
  the blotter. Liz noticed that she was making figures-of-eight. Lavinia must
  be very troubled indeed. When she was happy she made herring-bones.</p>

  <p>'It's very odd, you know,' Lavinia said, mulling it over in her mind. 'I
  get the same "kick" out of being in a room with him that I would get out of
  being in a room with a famous criminal. Only nicer, of course. But the same
  feeling of&mdash;of wrongness.' She made several furious figures-of-eight.
  'If he were to disappear tonight, and someone told me that he was just a
  beautiful demon and not a human being at all, I would believe them. So help
  me, I would.'</p>

  <p>Presently she flung the pencil back on to the desk, and said with a little
  laugh: 'And yet it's all so absurd. You look at him and try to find out what
  is so extraordinary about him, and what is there? Nothing. Nothing that can't
  be matched elsewhere, is there? That radiant fairness and that skin like a
  baby; that Norwegian correspondent of the <i>Clarion</i> that Walter used to
  bring down had those. He is extraordinarily graceful for a man; but so is
  Serge Ratoff. He has a nice gentle voice and an engaging drawl; but so have
  half the inhabitants of Texas and a large part of the population of Ireland.
  You catalogue his attractions and what do they add up to? I can tell you what
  they <i>don't</i> add up to. They don't add up to Leslie Searle.'</p>

  <p>'No,' said Liz soberly. 'No. They don't.'</p>

  <p>'The&mdash;the <i>exciting</i> thing is left out. <i>What</i> is it that
  makes him different? Even Emma feels it, you know.'</p>

  <p>'Mother?'</p>

  <p>'Only it takes her the opposite way. She hates it. She quite often
  disapproves of the people I bring down, sometimes she even dislikes them. But
  she <i>loathes</i> Leslie Searle.'</p>

  <p>'Has she told you so?'</p>

  <p>'No. She didn't have to.'</p>

  <p>No, thought Liz. She did not have to. Lavinia Fitch&mdash;dear, kind,
  abstracted Lavinia&mdash;manufacturer of fiction for the permanently
  adolescent, had after all a writer's intuition.</p>

  <p>'I wondered for a while if it was that he was a little mad,' Lavinia
  said.</p>

  <p>'Mad!'</p>

  <p>'Only nor-nor-west, of course. There is an unholy attraction about people
  who are stark crazy in one direction but quite sane every other way.'</p>

  <p>'Only if you know about their craziness,' Liz pointed out. 'You would have
  to know about their mental kink before you suffered any unholy
  attraction.'</p>

  <p>Lavinia considered that. 'Yes, I suppose you are right. But it doesn't
  matter, because I decided for myself that the "mad" theory didn't work. I
  have never met anyone saner than Leslie Searle. Have <i>you</i>?'</p>

  <p>Liz hadn't.</p>

  <p>'You don't think, do you,' Lavinia said, taking to doodling again and
  avoiding her niece's eye, 'that Walter is beginning to resent Leslie?'</p>

  <p>'Walter,' Liz said, startled. 'No, of course not. They are the greatest
  friends.'</p>

  <p>Lavinia, having with seven neat strokes erected a house, put the door in
  it.</p>

  <p>'Why should you think that about Walter?' Liz said, challenging.</p>

  <p>Lavinia added four windows and a chimney-stack, and considered the
  effect.</p>

  <p>'Because he is so considerate to him.'</p>

  <p>'Considerate! But Walter is <i>always</i>&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'When Walter likes people he takes them for granted,' Lavinia said, making
  smoke. 'The more he likes them the more he takes them for granted. He even
  takes you for granted&mdash;as you have no doubt observed before now. Until
  lately he took Leslie Searle for granted. He doesn't any more.'</p>

  <p>Liz considered this in silence.</p>

  <p>'If he didn't like him,' she said at length, 'he wouldn't be doing the
  Rushmere with him, or the book. Well, would he?' she added, as Lavinia seemed
  wholly absorbed in the correct placing of a doorknob.</p>

  <p>'The book is going to be very profitable,' Lavinia said, with only a hint
  of dryness.</p>

  <p>'Walter would never collaborate with someone he didn't like,' Liz said
  stoutly.</p>

  <p>'And Walter might find it difficult to explain why he didn't want to do
  the book after all,' Lavinia said as if she had not spoken.</p>

  <p>'Why are you telling me this?' Liz said, half angry.</p>

  <p>Lavinia stopped doodling and said disarmingly: 'Liz darling, I don't quite
  know, except perhaps that I was hoping you would find some way of reassuring
  Walter. In your own clever way. Which is to say, without dotting any I's or
  crossing any T's.' She caught Liz's glance, and said: 'Oh, yes, you are
  clever. A great deal cleverer than Walter will ever be. He is not very
  clever, poor Walter. The best thing that ever happened to him was that you
  should love him.' She pushed the defaced blotter away from her and smiled
  suddenly, 'I don't think, you know, that it is entirely a Bad Thing that he
  should have a rival to contend with. As long as there is no chance of the
  contention becoming serious.'</p>

  <p>'Of <i>course</i> it isn't serious,' Liz said.</p>

  <p>'Then suppose we get that moron out of the window, and finish the chapter
  before lunch,' Lavinia said, and, picking up the pencil, began to chew on it
  again.</p>

  <p>But a sense of shock stayed with Liz while she recorded, for the ultimate
  benefit of the lending libraries and the Inland Revenue, the doings of Sylvia
  the moron. It had not occurred to her that her awareness of Searle could be
  known to anyone but herself. Now it seemed that not only did Lavinia know
  very accurately how she felt about him, but she hinted that Walter too might
  know. But that surely was impossible. How could he know? Lavinia knew
  because, as she so frankly said, she too was a victim of the Searle charm.
  But Walter would have no such pointer to her emotions.</p>

  <p>And yet Lavinia had been so right. Walter's first easy taking-for-granted
  attitude to the visitor <i>had</i> changed to a host and guest relationship.
  It had changed imperceptibly and yet almost overnight. When and why had it
  changed? There was the unfortunate coinciding of the two so-different boxes
  of sweets; but that could hardly have rankled in any adult mind. The buying
  of candy for a girl was an automatic reflex with Americans; of no more
  significance than letting her go first through a doorway. Walter could hardly
  have resented that. How then could Walter have guessed the secret that was
  shared only by her fellow sufferer, Lavinia?</p>

  <p>Her mind went on to consider Lavinia and her perceptions. She considered
  the one count that Lavinia had left out of the indictment&mdash;the snubbing
  of Toby Tullis&mdash;and wondered whether Lavinia had not mentioned it
  because she did not know, or whether she was merely indifferent to any
  suffering that Toby might be subjected to. Toby, as the whole village knew,
  was enduring the finest tortures of frustration since Tantalus. Searle had
  refused, with the most unimaginably kind indifference, to go to see Hoo
  House, or to take part in any of the other activities that Toby was eager to
  arrange for him. He had even failed to show any interest when Toby offered to
  take him over to Stanworth and present him. This had never happened to Toby
  before. His freedom to trot in and out of the ducal splendours of Stanworth
  was his trump card. He had never before played it in vain. With Americans
  especially it took the trick. But not with this American. Searle wanted no
  part of Toby Tullis, and made it clear with the most charming good manners.
  He stonewalled with a grace that for all its mordant quality was delightful
  to watch. Intellectual Salcott watched it with open delight.</p>

  <p>And it was that that excoriated Toby.</p>

  <p>To be snubbed by Leslie Searle was bad enough; to have it known that he
  was snubbed was torture.</p>

  <p>Truly, thought Liz, the advent of Leslie Searle had not been a
  particularly fortunate happening for Salcott St Mary. Of all the people whose
  lives he touched, only Miss Easton-Dixon, perhaps, was wholly glad of his
  coming. He had been lovely with Miss Dixon; as kind and patient with her
  endless questions as though he had been a woman himself and interested in the
  small talk of the film world. He had trotted out for her benefit all the
  light gossip of studio politics, and had exchanged with her reminiscences of
  films good and films bad until Lavinia had said that they were like a couple
  of housewives swapping recipes.</p>

  <p>That was the night that Marta had come to dinner; and there had been a
  moment during that evening, when Liz, watching him with Miss Dixon, was
  seized with a terrible fear that she might after all be falling in love with
  Leslie Searle. She was still grateful to Marta for reassuring her. For it was
  when Marta commandeered him and carried him off with her into the night, and
  she felt no slightest pang at seeing them go, that she knew that, however
  strongly she felt Searle's attraction, she was in no bondage to him.</p>

  <p>Now, recording the doings of Sylvia the moron, she decided that she would
  take Lavinia's advice and find some way of reassuring Walter, so that he went
  away on this trip happy and with no grudge against Searle in his heart. When
  they came back from Mere Harbour, where they were taking possession of the
  two canoes and arranging for their transport to Otley to await them there,
  she would think up some small exclusive thing to do with Walter; something
  that would be tête-à-tête. It had been too often a triangle lately.</p>

  <p>Or too often, perhaps, the wrong tête-à-tête.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch07"
     id="ch07"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

  <p class="first">WALTER had welcomed the idea of progression by canoe, not
  because he looked forward to folding himself into an inadequate small boat,
  but, because it would give him his 'story'. If the book was to be a success
  he must have 'adventures', and an unusual method of locomotion was the
  easiest way of providing them. It is difficult to garner quaint experience
  when being borne along comfortably in a car. And walking has lost face since
  it became universal in the form of an activity called hiking. Walter, who had
  walked over a great part of Europe with a toothbrush and a spare shirt in his
  burberry pocket, would have been glad to do the Rushmere valley on foot, but
  felt that he could not hope to satisfy any modern devotee. His
  toothbrush-and-spare-shirt technique would merely puzzle the masochistic
  enthusiasts who plodded, packed and hobnailed, to the horizon their glazed
  eye was fixed on, more Atlas than Odysseus. And to do the valley as an
  incidental accompaniment to puppets or a Punch and Judy might be productive
  of copy but was a little infra dig in one whose holding in the Open Air was
  of almost proprietorial dimensions.</p>

  <p>So Walter welcomed the idea of a canoe. And in the last week or so he had
  begun to welcome the idea for a different reason altogether.</p>

  <p>In a car or on foot he would be cheek by jowl with Leslie Searle day after
  day; in a canoe he would be virtually free of him. Walter had reached the
  stage when the very sound of Searle's quiet drawl annoyed him into the need
  for momentary self-control. And a dim awareness that he was being a little
  ridiculous did nothing to soothe his annoyance. The last straw had been when
  Liz started being kind to him. He had never analysed Liz's attitude to him,
  which had always seemed an appropriate one. That is to say that Liz supplied
  the undemanding devotion that he considered ideal in a woman after eight
  months of Marguerite Merriam. And now Liz had gone kind on him.
  'Condescending' was his private word for it. But for his new awareness of Liz
  he might not have noticed the change, but Liz had moved to the very forefront
  of his thoughts and he analysed her lightest word, her most fleeting
  expression. And so he caught her being kind to him. Kind! To <i>him</i>. To
  Walter Whitmore.</p>

  <p>Nothing so revolutionary or so unbecoming could have happened but for the
  presence of Leslie Searle. Walter needed a great deal of self-control when he
  thought of Leslie Searle.</p>

  <p>They had planned to camp out each night, weather permitting; and of this
  too Walter was glad. Not only would it give him opportunities for tangling
  the Great Bear in the branches of some oak, or describing the night life of
  field and stream, but it would excuse him from the close quarters of night in
  some tiny inn. You can stroll away by yourself from a bivouac, but not,
  without remark, from a pub.</p>

  <p>The canoes were dubbed Pip and Emma&mdash;the Rushmere, according to
  Searle, being a place where it was always afternoon&mdash;and Mrs Garrowby
  was unreasonably annoyed to find that Searle owned the Emma one. But what
  dismayed her far more was a dawning realisation that she might not, after
  all, be getting rid of Searle. There was to be one piece of comparative
  cheating about the trip, it seemed. To photograph the larger pieces of
  landscape needed more apparatus than could conveniently be carried in a canoe
  that was already occupied by a sleeping-bag and groundsheet, so Searle was to
  come back later and photograph the set-pieces at his leisure.</p>

  <p>But for all the subterranean tremors that agitated
  Trimmings&mdash;Lavinia's misgiving, Walter's resentment, Liz's feeling of
  guilt, Emma's hatred&mdash;life on the surface was smooth. The sun shone with
  the incongruous brilliance so common in England before the last trees are in
  leaf; the nights were windless and warm as summer. Indeed Searle, standing on
  the stone terrace after dinner one night, had pointed out that This England
  might very well be That France.</p>

  <p>'Reminds you of Villefranche on a summer night,' he said. 'Until now that
  has been my measuring rod for magic. The lights on the water, and the warm
  air smelling of geranium, and the last boat out to the ship between one and
  two in the morning.'</p>

  <p>'What ship?' someone had asked.</p>

  <p>'Any ship,' Searle said lazily. 'I had no idea that Perfidious Albion had
  the magic too.'</p>

  <p>'Magic!' Lavinia had said. 'Why, we're the original firm.'</p>

  <p>And they laughed a little and were all friendly together.</p>

  <p>And nothing disturbed that friendliness up to the moment when Walter and
  Searle departed together into the English landscape late on a Friday night.
  Walter had given his usual talk, had come home for dinner (always put back an
  hour and a half on 'talks' day) and they had all drunk to the success of
  <i>Canoes on the Rushmere</i>. Then Liz drove them through the sweet spring
  evening, up the valley of the Rushmere, to their starting-point twenty miles
  away. They were going to spend the night in Grim's House; a cave that
  overlooked the high pastures where the river originated. Walter said that it
  was apt and fitting that they should begin their tale in prehistoric England,
  but Searle doubted if the domestic arrangements were likely to be any more
  prehistoric than some he had already sampled. A lot of England, he said,
  didn't seem to have come far from Grim, whoever he was.</p>

  <p>However, he was all for sleeping in a cave. He had slept, in his time, on
  the floor of a truck, on the open desert, in a bath, on a billiard table, in
  a hammock, and inside the cabin of a Giant Wheel at a fair, but so far he had
  not sampled a cave. He was all for the cave.</p>

  <p>Liz took them to where the track ended, and walked up the hundred yards of
  grassy path with them to inspect their shelter for the night. They were all
  very gay, full of good food and good drink and a little drunk with the magic
  of the night. They dumped their food and sleeping bags, and walked Liz back
  to the car. When they stopped talking for a moment the quiet pressed against
  their ears, so that they stayed their steps to listen for some sound.</p>

  <p>'I wish I wasn't going home to a roof,' Liz said into the silence. 'It's a
  night for the prehistoric.'</p>

  <p>But she went away down the rutted track to the road, her headlights making
  metallic green stains on the dark grass, and left them to the silence and the
  prehistoric.</p>

  <p>After that the two explorers became mere voices on the telephone.</p>

  <p>Each evening they rang up Trimmings from some pub or call-box to report
  progress. They had walked successfully down to Otley and found their canoes
  waiting for them. They took to the river and were delighted with their craft.
  Walter's first notebook was already full, and Searle was lyrical on the
  beauty of this England in its first light powdering of blossom. From Capel he
  called specially for Lavinia to tell her that she had been right about the
  magic; England did really have the original blue-print.</p>

  <p>'They sound very happy,' Lavinia said in a half-doubtful, half-relieved
  way as she hung up. She longed to go and see them, but the compact was that
  they were to be as strangers in a strange land, passing down the river and
  through Salcott St Mary as though they had never seen it before.</p>

  <p>'You spoil my perspective if you bring Trimmings into it,' Walter had
  said. 'I must see it as if I had never seen it before; the countryside, I
  mean; see it fresh and new.'</p>

  <p>So Trimmings waited each night for their telephoned report; mildly amused
  at this make-believe gulf.</p>

  <p>And then on Wednesday evening, five days after they had set out, they
  walked into the Swan and were hailed as the Stanleys of the Rushmere and
  treated to drinks by all and sundry. They were tied up at Pett's Hatch, they
  said, and were sleeping there; but they had not been able to resist walking
  across the fields to Salcott. By water it was two miles down river from
  Pett's Hatch to Salcott, but thanks to the loop of the Rushmere it was only a
  mile over the fields from one to the other. There was no inn at Pett's Hatch,
  so they had walked by the field-path to Salcott and the familiar haven of the
  Swan.</p>

  <p>Talk was general at first as each newcomer inquired as to how they did.
  But presently Walter took his beer to his favourite table in the corner, and
  after a little Searle followed him. Several times from then on one or other
  of the loungers at the bar made a movement towards the two to engage them
  once more in conversation, only to pause and change his mind as something in
  the attitude of the two men to each other struck him as odd. They were not
  quarrelling; it was just that something personal and urgent in their
  intercourse kept the others, almost unconsciously, from joining them.</p>

  <p>And then, quite suddenly, Walter was gone.</p>

  <p>He went without noise and without a goodnight. Only the bang of the door
  called their attention to his exit. It was an eloquent slam, furious and
  final; a very pointed exit.</p>

  <p>They looked in a puzzled fashion from the door to the unfinished beer at
  Walter's empty place, and decided in spite of that angry sound that Walter
  was coming back. Searle was sitting at his ease, relaxed against the wall,
  smiling faintly; and Bill Maddox, encouraged by the easing of that secret
  tension that had hung like a cloud in the corner, moved over and joined him.
  They talked outboard-motors and debated clinker versus carvel until their
  mugs were empty. As Maddox got up to refill them he caught sight of the flat
  liquid in Walter's mug and said: 'I'd better get another for Mr Whitmore;
  that stuff's stale.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, Walter has gone to bed,' Searle said.</p>

  <p>'But it's only&mdash;' Maddox was beginning, and realised that he was
  about to be tactless.</p>

  <p>'Yes, I know; but he thought it would be safer.'</p>

  <p>'Is he sickening for something?'</p>

  <p>'No, but if he stayed any longer he was liable to throttle me,' Searle
  said amiably. 'And at the school Walter went to they take a poor view of
  throttling. He is putting temptation behind him. Literally.'</p>

  <p>'You been annoying poor Mr Whitmore?' said Bill, who felt that he knew
  this young American much better than he knew Walter Whitmore.</p>

  <p>'Horribly,' Searle said lightly, matching a smile with Bill's.</p>

  <p>Maddox clicked his tongue and went away to get the beer.</p>

  <p>After that, conversation became general. Searle stayed until closing time,
  said goodnight to Reeve, the landlord, as he locked the door behind them, and
  walked down the village street with the others. At the narrow lane that led
  between the houses to the fields he turned off, pelted by their
  mock-condolences on his lack of a snug bed, and throwing back in his turn
  accusations of frowst and ageing arteries.</p>

  <p>'Goodnight!' he called, from far down the lane.</p>

  <p>And that was the last that anyone in Salcott St Mary ever saw of Leslie
  Searle.</p>

  <p>Forty-eight hours later Alan Grant stepped back into the affairs of the
  Trimmings household.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch08"
     id="ch08"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

  <p class="first">GRANT had just come back from Hampshire, where a case had
  ended unhappily in suicide, and his mind was still reviewing the thing,
  wondering how he might have managed things differently to a different end; so
  that he listened with only an ear-and-a-half to what his superior was saying
  to him until a familiar name caught his whole attention.</p>

  <p>'Salcott St Mary!' said Grant.</p>

  <p>'Why?' said Bryce, stopping his account. 'Do you know the place?'</p>

  <p>'I've never been there, but I know of it, of course.'</p>

  <p>'Why of course?'</p>

  <p>'It's a sort of artistic thieves'-kitchen. There's been a migration of
  intelligentsia to the place. Silas Weekley lives there, and Marta Hallard,
  and Lavinia Fitch. Tullis has a house there too. It isn't Toby Tullis who is
  missing, by any chance?' he asked hopefully.</p>

  <p>'No, unfortunately. It's a chap called Searle. Leslie Searle. A young
  American, it seems.'</p>

  <p>For a moment Grant was back in the crowded doorway of Cormac Ross's room,
  listening to a voice saying: 'I've forgotten my megaphone.' So the beautiful
  young man had disappeared.</p>

  <p>'Orfordshire say they want to put it in our laps not because they think
  the problem is insoluble but because it's a kid-glove affair. They think it
  would be easier for us than for them to pursue inquiries among the local
  bigwigs, and if there is any arresting to be done they would rather that we
  did it.'</p>

  <p>'Arresting? Are they suggesting that it was murder?'</p>

  <p>'They have a strong leaning to that theory, I understand. But, as the
  local inspector said to me, it sounds so absurd when you say it aloud that
  they shrink from uttering the name, even.'</p>

  <p>'What name?'</p>

  <p>'Walter Whitmore.'</p>

  <p>'<i>Walter Whitmore!</i>' Grant let out his breath in a soundless whistle.
  'I don't wonder they don't like saying it aloud. Walter Whitmore! What is he
  supposed to have done to Searle?'</p>

  <p>'They don't know. All they've got is some suggestion of a quarrel before
  the disappearance. It seems that Walter Whitmore and Searle were travelling
  down the Rushmere in canoes, and&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Canoes?'</p>

  <p>'Yes, a kind of stunt. Whitmore was going to write about it and this chap
  Searle was going to supply the illustrations.'</p>

  <p>'Is he an artist, then?'</p>

  <p>'No. A photographer. They camped out each night, and on Wednesday night
  they were sleeping on the river bank about a mile from Salcott. They both
  came to the pub at Salcott for a drink that evening. Whitmore left
  early&mdash;in some sort of pet, it is alleged. Searle stayed till
  closing-time and was seen to start off down the track to the river. After
  that he was not seen by anyone.'</p>

  <p>'Who reported the disappearance?'</p>

  <p>'Whitmore did next morning. When he woke and found that Searle had not
  occupied his sleeping-bag.'</p>

  <p>'He didn't see Searle at all on Wednesday night after leaving the
  pub?'</p>

  <p>'No, he says he fell asleep, and though he woke in the night he took it
  for granted that Searle had come back and was sleeping; it was too dark to
  see anything. It was only when daylight came that he realised that Searle had
  not been to bed.'</p>

  <p>'The theory is that he fell into the river, I suppose.'</p>

  <p>'Yes. The Wickham people took charge and dragged for a body. But it's a
  bad, muddy stream, there, between Capel and Salcott St Mary, the Wickham
  people say, so they weren't unbearably surprised not to find one.'</p>

  <p>'I don't wonder they don't want to touch the business,' Grant said
  dryly.</p>

  <p>'No. It's a delicate affair. No real suggestion of anything but accident.
  And yet&mdash;one big question mark.'</p>

  <p>'But&mdash;but <i>Walter Whitmore</i>!' Grant said. 'There <i>is</i>
  something inherently absurd about it, you know. What would that lover of
  little bunnies have to do with murder?'</p>

  <p>'You've been in the Force long enough to know that it is just those lovers
  of little bunnies that commit murder,' his chief said snappily. 'Anyhow, it
  is going to be your business to sift this artistic thieves'-kitchen of yours
  through a fine-mesh riddle until you're left with something that won't go
  through the mesh. You had better take a car. Wickham say it is four miles
  from a station, with a change at Crome anyhow.'</p>

  <p>'Very good. Do you mind if I take Sergeant Williams with me?'</p>

  <p>'As chauffeur, or what?'</p>

  <p>'No,' Grant said amiably. 'Just so that he knows the lay-out. Then if you
  pull me off this for something more urgent&mdash;as you will at any
  moment&mdash;Williams can carry on.'</p>

  <p>'You do think up the most convincing excuses for snoozing in a car.'</p>

  <p>Grant took this, rightly, as capitulation, and went away to collect
  Williams. He liked Williams and liked working with him. Williams was his
  opposite and his complement. He was large and pink and slow-moving, and he
  rarely read anything but an evening paper; but he had terrier qualities that
  were invaluable in a hunt. No terrier at a rat hole ever displayed more
  patience or more pertinacity than Williams did when introduced to a quarry.
  'I would hate to have you on my tail,' Grant had said to him more than once
  in their years of working together.</p>

  <p>To Williams, on the other hand, Grant was everything that was brilliant
  and spontaneous. He admired Grant with passion, and envied him without
  malice; Williams had no ambition, and coveted no man's shoes. 'You've no idea
  how lucky you are, sir,' Williams would say, 'not looking like a policeman.
  Me, I go into a pub, and they take one look at me and think: Copper! But with
  you, they just cast an eye over you and think: Army in plain clothes; and
  they don't think another thing about you. It's a great advantage in a job
  like ours, sir.'</p>

  <p>'But you have advantages that I lack, Williams,' Grant had once pointed
  out.</p>

  <p>'As what, for instance?' Williams had said, unbelieving.</p>

  <p>'You have only to say: "Hop it!" and people just dissolve. When I say "Hop
  it!" to anyone, they are as likely as not to say: "Who do you think you're
  talking to?"'</p>

  <p>'Lord love you, sir,' Williams had said. 'You don't even have to say: "Hop
  it!" You just look at them, and they begin to recollect appointments.'</p>

  <p>Grant had laughed and said: 'I must try that sometime!' But he enjoyed
  Williams's mild hero-worship; and still more he enjoyed his reliability and
  his persistence.</p>

  <p>'Do you listen to Walter Whitmore, Williams?' he asked, as Williams drove
  him down the unswerving road that the Legions had first surveyed two thousand
  years ago.</p>

  <p>'Can't say I do, sir. I'm not one for the country, much. Being born and
  brought up in it is a drawback.'</p>

  <p>'A drawback?'</p>

  <p>'Yes. You know just how workaday it really is.'</p>

  <p>'More Silas Weekley than Walter Whitmore.'</p>

  <p>'I don't know about the Silas bloke, but it certainly isn't like anything
  Walter Whitmore makes of it.' He thought of it for a little. 'He's a
  dresser-upper,' he said. 'Look at this Rushmere trip.'</p>

  <p>'I'm looking.'</p>

  <p>'I mean, there wasn't anything to prevent him staying at home with his
  aunt and doing the river valley like a Christian, in a car. The Rushmere
  isn't all that long. But no, he has to frill it up with a canoe and
  things.'</p>

  <p>Mention of Walter's aunt prompted Grant to another question.</p>

  <p>'I suppose you don't read Lavinia Fitch?'</p>

  <p>'No, but Nora does.'</p>

  <p>Nora was Mrs Williams, and the mother of Angela and Leonard.</p>

  <p>'Does she like them?'</p>

  <p>'Loves them. She says three things make her feel cosy in advance. A
  hot-water bottle, a quarter-pound of chocolates, and a new Lavinia
  Fitch.'</p>

  <p>'If Miss Fitch did not exist, it seems, it would be necessary to invent
  her,' Grant said.</p>

  <p>'Must make a fortune,' said Williams. 'Is Whitmore her heir?'</p>

  <p>'Her presumptive heir, at any rate. But it isn't Lavinia who has
  disappeared.'</p>

  <p>'No. What could Whitmore have against this Searle chap?'</p>

  <p>'Perhaps he just objects to fauns on principle.'</p>

  <p>'To what, sir?'</p>

  <p>'I saw Searle once.'</p>

  <p>'You did!'</p>

  <p>'I spoke to him in passing at a party about a month ago.'</p>

  <p>'What was he like, sir?'</p>

  <p>'A very good-looking young man indeed.'</p>

  <p>'Oh,' Williams said, in a thoughtful way.</p>

  <p>'No,' said Grant.</p>

  <p>'No?'</p>

  <p>'American,' Grant said irrelevantly. And then, remembering that party,
  added: 'He seemed to be interested in Liz Garrowby, now that I remember.'</p>

  <p>'Who is Liz Garrowby?'</p>

  <p>'Walter Whitmore's fiancée.'</p>

  <p>'He was? Well!'</p>

  <p>'But don't go making five of it until we get some evidence. I can't
  believe that Walter Whitmore ever had enough red blood in him to conk anyone
  on the head and push them into a river.'</p>

  <p>'No,' Williams said, considering it. 'Come to think of it, he's more of a
  push-ee.'</p>

  <p>Which put Grant in a good mood for the rest of the journey.</p>

  <p>At Wickham they were welcomed by the local inspector, Rodgers; a thin,
  anxious individual who looked as though he slept badly. He was alert,
  however, and informative and full of forethought. He had even booked two
  rooms at the Swan in Salcott and two at the White Hart in Wickham, so that
  Grant could have his choice. He bore them off to lunch at the White Hart,
  where Grant confirmed the room-booking and caused the Salcott booking to be
  cancelled. There was to be no suggestion yet that Scotland Yard were
  interested in the matter of Leslie Searle's disappearance; and it was not
  possible to conduct inquiries from the Swan without creating a sensation in
  Salcott.</p>

  <p>'I'd like to see Whitmore, though,' Grant said. 'I suppose he is back
  at&mdash;what do you call it: Miss Fitch's place.'</p>

  <p>'Trimmings. But he's up in town today giving his broadcast.'</p>

  <p>'In London?' said Grant, a little surprised.</p>

  <p>'It was arranged like that before they set out on this trip. Mr Whitmore's
  contract calls for a month off in August, when broadcasting has its "off"
  season; so there was no question, it seems, of passing up this week's
  broadcast just because he was canoeing on the Rushmere. They had arranged to
  be in Wickham today and to spend the night there. They had booked two rooms
  at the Angel. It's the olde-worlde show-place in Wickham. Very photogenic.
  Then this happened. But since there was nothing Mr Whitmore could do here, he
  went up to do his half-hour, just as he would have if they had reached
  Wickham.'</p>

  <p>'I see. And he is coming back tonight?'</p>

  <p>'If he doesn't vanish into thin air.'</p>

  <p>'About this vanishing: did Whitmore agree that there had been disagreement
  between them?'</p>

  <p>'I didn't put it to him. That's what&mdash;' The Inspector broke off.</p>

  <p>'That's what I'm here for,' Grant said, finishing the sentence for
  him.</p>

  <p>'That's about it, sir.'</p>

  <p>'Where did the "disagreement" story come from?'</p>

  <p>'The Swan. Everyone who was there on Wednesday night had the impression
  that there was some kind of tension between them.'</p>

  <p>'No overt quarrel?'</p>

  <p>'No, nothing like that. If there had been anything like that I could have
  taxed him with it. All that happened was that Mr Whitmore left early without
  saying goodnight, and Searle said he was angry about something.'</p>

  <p>'<i>Searle</i> said! To whom?'</p>

  <p>'To the local garage-keeper. A chap called Maddox. Bill Maddox.'</p>

  <p>'Have you talked to Maddox?'</p>

  <p>'I talked to them all. I was in the Swan last night. We spent the day
  dragging the river in case he had fallen in, and making inquiries all round
  the neighbourhood in case he had lost his memory and was just wandering. We
  couldn't find any body, and no one had seen him or anyone answering his
  description. So I finished up at the Swan, and saw most of the people who had
  been there on Wednesday night. It's the only pub in the place, and a very
  nice respectable little house run by a Joey; an ex-sergeant of Marines; and
  it's the meeting-place for the whole village. None of them was exactly
  anxious to involve Mr Whitmore&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Popular, is he?'</p>

  <p>'Well, popular enough. He probably shines by comparison. There's a very
  odd crew lives here, I don't know if you know.'</p>

  <p>'Yes, I've heard.'</p>

  <p>'So they didn't want to get Walter Whitmore into trouble, but they had to
  explain why the two friends didn't go back to their camp together. And once
  they broke down and talked they were unanimous that there was some sort of
  trouble between them.'</p>

  <p>'Did this Maddox volunteer his story?'</p>

  <p>'No, the local butcher did. Maddox had told them about it on the way home
  on Wednesday. After they had seen Searle go away by himself down the lane.
  Maddox confirmed it, though.'</p>

  <p>'Well, I'll go and see Whitmore when he comes back tonight, and ask for
  his story. Meanwhile we'll go and see the place where they camped on
  Wednesday night.'</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch09"
     id="ch09"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>

  <p class="first">'I DON'T want to appear in Salcott just yet,' Grant said as
  they drove out of Wickham. 'Is there some other way to the river bank?'</p>

  <p>'There's no way at all to the river bank, properly speaking. There's about
  a mile of field-path from Salcott to where they were. But we could reach the
  place just as easily from the main Wickham-Crome road, across the fields. Or
  we could turn off the road by a lane that goes to Pett's Hatch, and walk down
  the river bank from there. They were moored about a quarter mile below Pett's
  Hatch.'</p>

  <p>'On the whole, I'd rather walk across the fields from the main road. It
  would be interesting to see how much of a walk it is. What kind of a village
  is Pett's Hatch?'</p>

  <p>'It isn't a village at all. Just a ruined mill and the few cottages that
  used to house the workers there. That is why Whitmore and Searle walked into
  Salcott for their evening drink.'</p>

  <p>'I see.'</p>

  <p>The ever-efficient Rodgers pulled a one-inch Survey map out of the pocket
  of his car, and studied it. The field opposite which they had stopped looked
  to Grant's urban eye exactly like any other field that they had passed since
  leaving Wickham, but the Inspector said: 'It should be about opposite here, I
  think. Yes; there's where they were; and here is us.'</p>

  <p>He showed the lay-out to Grant. North and south ran the road from Wickham
  south to Crome. West of it lay the Rushmere, out of sight in its valley,
  running north-east to meet the road at Wickham. At a point level with where
  they were now halted, the river ran back on itself in a wide loop over the
  flat bed of the valley. At the point where it first curved back, Whitmore and
  Searle had made their camp. On the farther side of the valley, where the
  river came back level with them, was Salcott St Mary. Both their camp and the
  village of Salcott were on the right bank of the river, so that only a short
  mile of alluvial land lay between their camp and the village.</p>

  <p>As the three men reached the third field from the road, the countryside
  opened below them, so that the relevant section of the Rushmere valley was
  laid out for them as it had been on Rodgers's map: the flat green floor with
  the darker green scarf of the Rushmere looped across it, the huddle of roofs
  and gardens on the far side where Salcott St Mary stood in its trees; the
  lonely cluster, back up the river to the south, that was Pett's Hatch.</p>

  <p>'Where is the railway from here?' Grant asked.</p>

  <p>'There is no railway nearer than Wickham. No station, that is. The line
  runs the other side of the Wickham-Crome road; not in the valley at all.'</p>

  <p>'Plenty of buses on the Wickham-Crome road?'</p>

  <p>'Oh, yes. But you're not suggesting that the fellow just ducked, are
  you?'</p>

  <p>'I'm keeping the possibility in mind. After all, we know nothing about
  him. I'll admit there are more likely possibilities.'</p>

  <p>Rodgers led them down the long slope to the river bank. Where the river
  turned away south-west two large trees broke the line of pollarded willows: a
  tall willow and an ash. Under the ash were moored two canoes. The grass still
  had a trampled look.</p>

  <p>'This is the place,' Rodgers said. 'Mr Whitmore spread his sleeping-bag
  under that big willow, and Searle put his round the other side of the ash
  where there is a hollow between the roots that makes a natural shelter. So
  that it was quite natural that Mr Whitmore should not know that he wasn't
  there.'</p>

  <p>Grant moved over to where Searle's bed had been, and considered the
  water.</p>

  <p>'How much current is there? If he had tripped over those roots in the dark
  and taken a header into the river, what would happen?'</p>

  <p>'It's a horrid stream, the Rushmere, I admit. All pot-holes and
  under-tows. And a bottom of what the Chief Constable calls "immemorial mud".
  But Searle could swim. Or so Walter Whitmore says.'</p>

  <p>'Was he sober?'</p>

  <p>'Cold, stone sober.'</p>

  <p>'Then if he went into the water unconscious, where would you expect to
  find his body?'</p>

  <p>'Between here and Salcott. Depends on the amount of rain. We've had so
  little lately that you'd normally find the river low, but they had a
  cloudburst at Tunstall on Tuesday&mdash;out of the blue in the good old
  English fashion&mdash;and the Rushmere came down like a mill-race.'</p>

  <p>'I see. What became of the camp stuff?'</p>

  <p>'Walter Whitmore had it taken up to Trimmings.'</p>

  <p>'I take it that Searle's normal belongings are still at Trimmings.'</p>

  <p>'I expect so.'</p>

  <p>'Perhaps I had better take a look through them tonight. If there was
  anything interesting to us among them it will have gone by now, but they may
  be suggestive. Had Searle been on good terms with the other inhabitants of
  Salcott, do you know?'</p>

  <p>'Well, I hear there was a scene about a fortnight ago. A dancer chap flung
  a mug of beer over him.'</p>

  <p>'Why?' asked Grant, identifying the 'dancer chap' without difficulty.
  Marta was a faithful recorder of Salcott history.</p>

  <p>'He didn't like the attentions that Toby Tullis was paying to Searle, so
  they say.'</p>

  <p>'Did Searle?'</p>

  <p>'No, if all reports are true,' Rodgers said, his anxious face relaxing to
  a moment's amusement.</p>

  <p>'So Tullis wouldn't love him very much either?'</p>

  <p>'Perhaps not.'</p>

  <p>'You haven't had time, I suppose, to get round to alibis.'</p>

  <p>'No. It wasn't until early evening that we found it might be more than a
  simple case of missing. Up till then it was a simple matter of drag and
  search. When we found what was turning up we wanted outside help and sent for
  you.'</p>

  <p>'I'm glad you sent so soon. It's a great help to be there when the tapes
  go up. Well, I don't think there is anything else we can do here. We had
  better get back to Wickham, and I'll take over.'</p>

  <p>Rodgers dropped them at the White Hart, and left them with assurances of
  any help that was within his power.</p>

  <p>'Good man, that,' Grant said, as they climbed the stairs to inspect their
  rooms under the roof&mdash;rooms with texts in wools and flowered
  wall-paper&mdash;'he ought to be at the Yard.'</p>

  <p>'It's a queer set-up, isn't it?' Williams said, firmly taking the pokier
  of the two rooms. 'The rope trick in an English meadow. What do you think
  happened to him, sir?'</p>

  <p>'I don't know about "rope trick", but it does smell strongly of
  sleight-of-hand. Now you see it, now you don't. The old conjurer's trick of
  the distracted attention. Ever seen a lady sawn in half, Williams?'</p>

  <p>'Many's the time.'</p>

  <p>'There's a strong aroma of sawn lady about this. Or don't you smell
  it?'</p>

  <p>'I haven't got your nose, sir. All I see is a very queer set-up. A spring
  night in England, and a young American goes missing in the mile between the
  village and the river. You really think he <i>might</i> have ducked,
  sir?'</p>

  <p>'I can't think of any adequate reason why he should, but perhaps Whitmore
  can.'</p>

  <p>'I expect he will be very anxious to,' Williams said dryly.</p>

  <p>But oddly enough Walter Whitmore showed no anxiety to put forward any such
  theory. On the contrary, he scorned it. It was absurd, he said, manifestly
  absurd, to suggest that Searle should have left of his own accord. Quite
  apart from the fact that he was very happy, he had a very profitable deal to
  look forward to. He had been enormously enthusiastic about the book they were
  doing together, and it was fantastic to suggest that he would just walk out
  like that.</p>

  <p>Grant had come to Trimmings after dinner, tactfully allowing for the fact
  that dinner at Trimmings must be very late on broadcast day. He had sent in
  word to ask if Mr Whitmore would see Alan Grant, and had not mentioned his
  business until he was face to face with Walter.</p>

  <p>His first thought on seeing Walter Whitmore in the flesh was how much
  older he looked than he had expected; and then wondered whether it was that
  Walter looked much older than he had done on Wednesday. He looked
  disorientated, Grant thought; adrift. Something had happened to him that did
  not belong to the world he knew and recognised.</p>

  <p>But he took Grant's announcement of his identity calmly.</p>

  <p>'I was almost expecting you,' he said, offering cigarettes. 'Not you
  personally, of course. Just a representative of what has come to be known as
  the Higher Levels.'</p>

  <p>Grant had asked about their trip down the Rushmere, so as to set him
  talking; if you got a man to talk enough he lost his defensive quality.
  Whitmore was drawing too hard on his cigarette but talking quite freely.
  Before he had actually reached their Wednesday evening visit to the Swan,
  Grant deflected him. It was too early yet to ask him about that night.</p>

  <p>'You don't really know much about Searle, do you,' he pointed out. 'Had
  you heard of him at all before he turned up at that party of Ross's?'</p>

  <p>'No, I hadn't. But that isn't strange. Photographers are two a penny.
  Almost as common as journalists. There was no reason why I should have heard
  of him.'</p>

  <p>'You have no reason to believe that he may not be what he represented
  himself to be?'</p>

  <p>'No, certainly not. I may never have heard of him, but Miss Easton-Dixon
  certainly had.'</p>

  <p>'Miss Easton-Dixon?'</p>

  <p>'One of our local authors. She writes fairy-tales, and is a film addict.
  Not only did she know about Searle but she has a photograph.'</p>

  <p>'A photograph?' Grant said, startled and pleased.</p>

  <p>'In one of those film magazines. I haven't seen it myself. She talked
  about it one night when she came to dinner.'</p>

  <p>'And she met Searle when she came to dinner? And identified him?'</p>

  <p>'She did. They had a wonderful get-together. Searle had photographed some
  of her pet actors, and she had reproductions of them too.'</p>

  <p>'So there is no doubt in your mind that Searle is what he says he is.'</p>

  <p>'I notice you use the present tense, Inspector. That cheers me.' But he
  sounded more ironic than cheered.</p>

  <p>'Have you yourself any theory as to what could have happened, Mr
  Whitmore?'</p>

  <p>'Short of fiery chariots or witches' broomsticks, no. It is the most
  baffling thing.'</p>

  <p>Grant caught himself thinking that Walter Whitmore, too, was moved to
  think of sleight-of-hand.</p>

  <p>'The most reasonable explanation, I suppose,' Walter went on, 'is that he
  lost his way in the dark and fell into the river at some other spot, where no
  one would hear him.'</p>

  <p>'And why don't you approve of that theory?' Grant asked, answering the
  tone that Whitmore used.</p>

  <p>'Well, for one thing, Searle had eyes like a cat. I had slept out with him
  for four nights, and I know. He was wonderful in the dark. Secondly he had an
  extra-good bump of locality. Thirdly he was by all accounts cold sober when
  he left the Swan. Fourthly it is a bee-line from Salcott to the river-bank
  where we were camped, by the hedges all the way. You can't stray, because if
  you walk away from the hedge you walk into plough or crop of some kind. And
  lastly, though this is hearsay evidence, Searle could swim very well
  indeed.'</p>

  <p>'There is a suggestion, Mr Whitmore, that you and Searle were on bad terms
  on Wednesday evening. Is there any truth in that?'</p>

  <p>'I thought we should get to that sooner or later,' Walter said. He pressed
  the half-smoked cigarette into the ashtray until it was a misshapen
  wreck.</p>

  <p>'Well?' Grant prompted, as he seemed to have nothing more to say.</p>

  <p>'We had what might be called a&mdash;a "spat", I suppose. I
  was&mdash;annoyed. Nothing more than that.'</p>

  <p>'He annoyed you so much that you left him at the pub and walked back by
  yourself.'</p>

  <p>'I like being by myself.'</p>

  <p>'And you went to sleep without waiting for his return.'</p>

  <p>'Yes. I didn't want to talk to him any more that night. He annoyed me, I
  tell you. I thought that I might be in a better humour and he in a less
  provocative mood in the morning.'</p>

  <p>'He was provocative?'</p>

  <p>'I think that is the word.'</p>

  <p>'About what?'</p>

  <p>'I don't have to tell you that.'</p>

  <p>'You don't have to tell me anything, Mr Whitmore.'</p>

  <p>'No, I know I don't. But I want to be as helpful as I can. God knows I
  want this thing cleared up as soon as possible. It is just that what
  we&mdash;disagreed about is something personal and irrelevant. It has no
  bearing whatever on anything that happened to Searle on Wednesday night. I
  certainly didn't lie in wait for him on the way home, or push him into the
  river, or subject him to violence.'</p>

  <p>'Do you know of anyone who would be likely to want to?'</p>

  <p>Whitmore hesitated; presumably with Serge Ratoff in his mind.</p>

  <p>'Not that kind of violence,' he said at length.</p>

  <p>'Not what kind?'</p>

  <p>'Not that waiting-in-the-dark kind.'</p>

  <p>'I see. Just the ordinary sock-in-the-jaw kind. There was a scene with
  Serge Ratoff, I understand.'</p>

  <p>'Anyone who gets through life in close proximity to Serge Ratoff and
  doesn't have a scene with him must be abnormal,' Walter said.</p>

  <p>'You don't know of anyone who might have a grudge against Searle?'</p>

  <p>'No one in Salcott. I don't know anything of his friends or enemies
  elsewhere.'</p>

  <p>'Have you any objection to my looking through Searle's belongings?'</p>

  <p>'I haven't, but Searle might. What do you expect to find, Inspector?'</p>

  <p>'Nothing specific. A man's belongings are very revealing, I find. I am
  merely looking for suggestion of some sort; help of any kind in a very
  puzzling situation.'</p>

  <p>'I'll take you up now, then&mdash;unless there is anything else you want
  to ask me.'</p>

  <p>'No, thank you. You have been very helpful. I wish you could have trusted
  me far enough to tell me what the quarrel was about&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'There was no quarrel!' Whitmore said sharply.</p>

  <p>'I beg your pardon. I mean, in what way Searle riled you. It would tell me
  even more about Searle than it would about you; but perhaps it is too much to
  expect you to see that.'</p>

  <p>Whitmore stood by the door, considering this. 'No,' he said slowly. 'No, I
  do see what you mean. But to tell you involves&mdash; No, I don't think I can
  tell you.'</p>

  <p>'I see you can't. Let us go up.'</p>

  <p>As they emerged into the baronial hall from the library where the
  interview had taken place, Liz had just come out of the drawing-room and was
  crossing to the stairs. When she saw Grant she paused and her face lighted
  with joy.</p>

  <p>'Oh!' she said, 'you've come with news of him!'</p>

  <p>When Grant said no, that he had no news, she looked puzzled.</p>

  <p>'But it was you who introduced him,' she insisted. 'At that party.'</p>

  <p>This was news to Walter and Grant could feel his surprise. He could also
  feel his resentment at that flash of overwhelming joy on Liz's face.</p>

  <p>'This, Liz dear,' he said in a cool, faintly malicious tone, 'is Detective
  Inspector Grant from Scotland Yard.'</p>

  <p>'From the Yard! But&mdash;you <i>were</i> at that party!'</p>

  <p>'It is not unheard of for policemen to be interested in the arts,' Grant
  said, amused. 'But&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Oh, please! I didn't mean it that way.'</p>

  <p>'I had only looked in at the party to pick up a friend. Searle was
  standing by the door looking lost because he didn't know Miss Fitch by sight.
  So I took him over and introduced them. That is all.'</p>

  <p>'And now you've come down here to&mdash;to investigate&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'To investigate his disappearance. Have you any theories, Miss
  Garrowby?'</p>

  <p>'I? No. Not even a rudimentary one. It just doesn't make sense. It's
  <i>fantastically</i> senseless.'</p>

  <p>'If it isn't too late may I talk to you for a little when I have been
  through Searle's belongings?'</p>

  <p>'No, of course it isn't too late. It isn't ten o'clock yet.' She sounded
  weary. 'Since this happened time stretches out and out. It's like
  having&mdash;hashish, is it? Are you looking for anything in particular,
  Inspector?'</p>

  <p>'Yes,' Grant said. 'Inspiration. But I doubt if I shall find it.'</p>

  <p>'I shall be in the library when you come down. I hope you will find
  something that will help. It is very dreadful being suspended from a spider's
  thread this way.'</p>

  <p>As he went through Searle's belongings Grant thought about Liz
  Garrowby&mdash;Marta's 'dear nice Liz'&mdash;and her relations with William's
  'push-ee'. There was never any saying what a woman saw in any man, and
  Whitmore was of course a celebrity as well as a potentially good husband. He
  had said as much to Marta, coming away from the party that day. But how right
  had Marta been about Searle's power to upset? How much had Liz Garrowby felt
  Searle's charm? How much of that eager welcome of hers in the hall had been
  joy at Searle's imagined safety and how much mere relief from the burden of
  suspicion and gloom?</p>

  <p>His hands turned over Searle's things with automatic efficiency, but his
  mind was busy deciding how much or how little to ask Liz Garrowby when he
  went downstairs again.</p>

  <p>Searle had occupied a first-floor room in the battlemented tower that
  stuck out to the left of the Tudor front door, so that it had windows on
  three sides of it. It was large and high, and was furnished in very superior
  Tottenham Court Road, a little too gay and coy for its Victorian amplitude.
  It was an impersonal room and Searle had evidently done nothing to stamp it
  with his personality. This struck Grant as odd. He had rarely seen a room,
  occupied for so long, so devoid of atmosphere. There were brushes on the
  table, and books by the bedside, but of their owner there was no trace. It
  might have been a room in a shop window.</p>

  <p>Of course it had been swept and tidied since last it was occupied six days
  ago. But still. But still.</p>

  <p>The feeling was so strong that Grant paused to look round and consider. He
  thought of all the rooms he had searched in his time. They had all&mdash;even
  the hotel rooms&mdash;been redolent of their late occupier. But here was
  nothing but emptiness. An impersonal blank. Searle had kept his personality
  to himself.</p>

  <p>Grant noticed, as Liz had noticed on that first day, how expensive his
  clothes and luggage were. As he turned over the handkerchiefs in the top
  drawer he noticed that they had no laundry mark, and wondered a little. Done
  at home, perhaps. The shirts and linen were marked but the mark was old and
  probably American.</p>

  <p>As well as the two leather suitcases, there was a japanned tin case like a
  very large paint-box, with the name 'L. Searle' in white letters on the lid.
  It was fitted with a lock but was unfastened and Grant lifted the lid with
  some curiosity, only to find that it was filled with Searle's photographic
  material. It was built on the lines of a paint-box, with a top tray that was
  made to lift out. Grant hooked out the top tray with his forefingers and
  surveyed the deeper compartment below it. The lower compartment was full
  except for an oblong of empty space where something had been taken out. Grant
  put down the tray he was holding and went to unroll the camp outfit that had
  been brought back from the river-bank. He wanted to know what fitted into
  that oblong space.</p>

  <p>But there was nothing that fitted.</p>

  <p>There were two small cameras in the pack and some rolls of film. Neither
  separately nor together did they fit into the space in the tin box. Nor did
  anything else in the pack.</p>

  <p>Grant came back and stood for some time considering that empty space.
  Something roughly 10 inches by 3½ by 4 had been taken out. And it had been
  taken out when the box was in its present position. Any heaving about of the
  box would have dislodged the other objects from their packed position and
  obliterated the empty space.</p>

  <p>He would have to ask about that when he went downstairs.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, having given the room a quick going-over, he now went over it
  in detail. Even so, he nearly missed the vital thing. He had run through the
  rather untidy handkerchief-and-ties drawer and was in the act of closing it,
  when something among the ties caught his attention and he picked it out.</p>

  <p>It was a woman's glove. A very small woman's glove.</p>

  <p>A glove about Liz Garrowby's size.</p>

  <p>Grant looked for its mate but there was none. It was the usual lover's
  trophy.</p>

  <p>So the beautiful young man had been sufficiently attracted to steal one of
  his beloved's gloves. Grant found it oddly endearing. An almost Victorian
  gesture. Nowadays fetish-worship took much more sinister forms.</p>

  <p>Well, whatever the glove proved, it surely proved that Searle had meant to
  come back. One does not leave stolen love-objects in one's tie-drawer to be
  exposed to the unsympathetic gaze of the stranger.</p>

  <p>The question to be decided was: whose glove, and how much or how little
  did it mean?</p>

  <p>Grant put it in his pocket and went downstairs. Liz was waiting for him in
  the library as she had promised, but he noticed that she had had company. No
  one person could have smoked so many cigarettes as the ends in the ashtray
  indicated. Grant deduced that Walter Whitmore had been in consultation with
  her over this affair of police interrogation.</p>

  <p>But Liz had not forgotten that she was also a secretary and official
  receptionist for Trimmings, and she had caused drinks to be brought. Grant
  refused them because he was on duty, but approved of her effort on his
  behalf.</p>

  <p>'I suppose this is only a beginning,' Liz said, indicating the <i>Wickham
  Times</i> (once weekly every Friday) which was lying open on the table. YOUNG
  MAN MISSING, said a modest headline in an inconspicuous position. And Walter
  was referred to as Mr Walter Whitmore, of Trimmings, Salcott St Mary, the
  well-known commentator.</p>

  <p>'Yes,' Grant said. 'The daily Press will have it tomorrow.'</p>

  <p>WHITMORE'S COMPANION DROWNED, they would say tomorrow, on the front page.
  WHITMORE MYSTERY. FRIEND OF WHITMORE DISAPPEARS.</p>

  <p>'It is going to be very bad for Walter.'</p>

  <p>'Yes. Publicity is suffering from a sort of inflation. Its power is out of
  all proportion to its worth.'</p>

  <p>'What do you think happened to him, Inspector? To Leslie?'</p>

  <p>'Well, for a time I had a theory that he might have disappeared of his own
  accord.'</p>

  <p>'Voluntarily! But <i>why</i>?'</p>

  <p>'That I wouldn't know without knowing more about Leslie Searle. You don't
  think, for instance, that he was the type to play a practical joke?'</p>

  <p>'Oh, <i>no</i>. Quite definitely not. He wasn't that kind at all. He was
  very quiet and&mdash;and had excellent taste. He wouldn't see anything funny
  in practical joking. Besides, where could he disappear to with all his
  belongings left behind? He would have only what he stood up in.'</p>

  <p>'About those belongings. Did you ever happen to see inside the japanned
  tin box that belongs to him?'</p>

  <p>'The photographic box. I think I must have once. Because I remember
  thinking how neatly packed everything was.'</p>

  <p>'Something has been taken out of the lower compartment, and I can't find
  anything that fits the space. Would you be able to tell what is missing, do
  you think?'</p>

  <p>'I'm sure I shouldn't. I don't remember anything in detail. Only the
  neatness. It was chemical stuff, and slides, and things like that.'</p>

  <p>'Did he keep it locked?'</p>

  <p>'It <i>did</i> lock, I know. Some of the stuff was poisonous. But I don't
  think it was kept permanently locked. Is it locked now?'</p>

  <p>'No. Otherwise I shouldn't have known about the empty space.'</p>

  <p>'I thought policemen could open anything.'</p>

  <p>'They <i>can</i>, but they <i>may</i> not.'</p>

  <p>She smiled a little and said: 'I was always in trouble with that at
  school.'</p>

  <p>'By the way,' he said, 'do you recognise this glove?' And produced it from
  his pocket.</p>

  <p>'Yes,' she said, mildly interested. 'It looks like one of mine. Where did
  you find it?'</p>

  <p>'In Searle's handkerchief drawer.'</p>

  <p>It was exactly like touching a snail, he thought. The instant closing-up
  and withdrawal. One moment she was frank and unselfconscious. The next moment
  she was startled and defensive.</p>

  <p>'How odd,' she said, through a tight throat. 'He must have picked it up
  and meant to give it back to me. I keep a spare pair in the pocket of the
  car, a respectable pair, and drive in old ones. Perhaps one of my respectable
  pair dropped out one day.'</p>

  <p>'I see.'</p>

  <p>'That one, certainly, is one of the kind I keep in the car pocket.
  Presentable enough to go calling or shopping with but not too grand for
  everyday wear.'</p>

  <p>'Do you mind if I keep it for a little?'</p>

  <p>'No, of course not. Is it an "exhibit"?' It was a gallant effort to sound
  light.</p>

  <p>'Not exactly. But anything that was in Searle's room is of potential value
  at the moment.'</p>

  <p>'I think that glove is more likely to mislead you than help you,
  Inspector. But keep it by all means.'</p>

  <p>He liked the touch of spirit, and was glad of her quick recovery. He had
  never enjoyed teasing snails.</p>

  <p>'Would Mr Whitmore be able to tell what is missing from that case?'</p>

  <p>'I doubt it, but we can see.' She made for the door to summon Walter.</p>

  <p>'Or anyone else in the household?'</p>

  <p>'Well, Aunt Lavinia wouldn't. She never knows even what is in her own
  drawers. And Mother wouldn't, because she never goes near the tower room
  except to put her head in to see that the bed had been done and the place
  dusted. But we can ask the staff.'</p>

  <p>Grant took them up to the tower bedroom and showed them what he meant
  about the empty space. What had lain in that oblong gap?</p>

  <p>'Some chemical that he has already used up?' Walter suggested.</p>

  <p>'I thought of that, but all the necessary chemicals are still there and
  hardly used at all. You can't think of anything that you have seen him with
  that would fill that gap?'</p>

  <p>They could not; and neither could Alice the housemaid.</p>

  <p>No one did Mr Searle's room but her, she said. A Mrs Clamp came from the
  village every day to help, but she did not do bedrooms. Just stairs and
  corridors and offices and that.</p>

  <p>Grant watched their faces and speculated. Whitmore was poker-faced; Liz
  half interested by the puzzle, half troubled; Alice apprehensive that she
  might be held responsible for whatever was missing from the case.</p>

  <p>He was getting nowhere.</p>

  <p>Whitmore came to the front door with him, and peering into the dark said:
  'Where is your car?'</p>

  <p>'I left it down the avenue,' Grant said, 'Goodnight, and thank you for
  being so helpful.'</p>

  <p>He moved away into the darkness and waited while Walter closed the door.
  Then he walked round the house to the garage. It was still open, and it held
  three cars. He tried the pockets of all three, but none of them held an odd
  glove. None of them held any gloves whatever.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch10"
     id="ch10"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

  <p class="first">WILLIAMS was sitting in the corner of the coffee-room at the
  White Hart, consuming a late supper; and the landlord greeted Grant and went
  away to bring supper for him too. Williams, with the aid of the local police,
  had spent a long, tiring, and unproductive afternoon and evening on Grant's
  theory that Searle might have, for reasons of his own, disappeared. At ten
  o'clock, having interviewed his twenty-third bus conductor, and the last
  available railway porter, he had called it a day, and was now relaxed over
  beer and sausage-and-mashed.</p>

  <p>'Not a thing,' he said, in answer to Grant's question. 'No one even
  remotely like him. Any luck with you, sir?'</p>

  <p>'Nothing that makes the situation any clearer.'</p>

  <p>'No letters among his belongings?'</p>

  <p>'Not one. They must be all in his wallet, if he has any at all. Nothing
  but packets of photographs.'</p>

  <p>'Photographs?' Williams's ears pricked.</p>

  <p>'Local ones that he has taken since he came here.'</p>

  <p>'Oh. Any of Walter Whitmore's girl, by any chance?'</p>

  <p>'A very great number indeed.'</p>

  <p>'Yes? Posed ones?'</p>

  <p>'No, Williams, no. Romantic. Her head against a sunlit sky with a spray of
  almond blossom across it. That kind of thing.'</p>

  <p>'Is she photogenic, would you say? A blonde?'</p>

  <p>'No, she is a small, dark, plainish creature with a nice face.'</p>

  <p>'Oh. What does he want to go on photographing her for? Must be in love
  with her.'</p>

  <p>'I wonder,' Grant said; and was silent while food was put in front of
  him.</p>

  <p>'You really ought, just for once, to try those pickles, sir,' Williams
  said. 'They're wonderful.'</p>

  <p>'For the five hundred and seventh time, I do not eat pickles. I have a
  palate, Williams. A precious possession. And I have no intention of
  prostituting it to pickles. There was something among Searle's things that
  was a great deal more suggestive than any photograph.'</p>

  <p>'What, sir?'</p>

  <p>'One of the girl's gloves,' Grant said; and told him where it had been
  found.</p>

  <p>'Well, well,' Williams said, and chewed the information over in silence
  for a little. 'Doesn't sound as if it had gone very far.'</p>

  <p>'What?'</p>

  <p>'The affair. If he was still at the stage of stealing her glove. Honestly,
  sir, in this day and age I didn't imagine that anyone was driven to making do
  with a glove.'</p>

  <p>Grant laughed. 'I told you. She is a nice girl. Tell me, Williams, what
  kind of object would fit a space 10 inches by 3½ by 4?'</p>

  <p>'A bar of soap,' said Williams without hesitation.</p>

  <p>'Unlikely. What else?'</p>

  <p>'Box of cigarettes?'</p>

  <p>'No. Not a smoker.'</p>

  <p>'Food of some kind? Processed cheese is that shape.'</p>

  <p>'No.'</p>

  <p>'Revolver? Revolver in a case, I mean.'</p>

  <p>'I wonder. Why should he have a revolver?'</p>

  <p>'What space are you trying to fill, sir?' Williams asked, and Grant
  described the photographic box, and the gap in the neatly fitted
  compartment.</p>

  <p>'Whatever had been there was something solid, so that the outline was hard
  and clear. Nothing that was still available among his belongings fitted the
  gap. So either he took it out and got rid of it, or it was removed for some
  reason after he had disappeared.'</p>

  <p>'That would mean that someone at Trimmings is suppressing evidence. You
  still think Whitmore not the type, sir?'</p>

  <p>'Type?'</p>

  <p>'Not the bumping-off type.'</p>

  <p>'I think Whitmore would be more liable to get into a pet than to see
  red.'</p>

  <p>'But he wouldn't need to see red to drown Searle. A shove when he was in a
  pet would have done it, and he mightn't have been able to do anything about
  rescue in the dark. Then he might lose his head and pretend he knew nothing
  about it. Heaven knows that happens often enough.'</p>

  <p>'You think Whitmore did it but did it in half-accident?'</p>

  <p>'I don't know who did it. But it's my firm conviction that Searle is still
  in the river, sir.'</p>

  <p>'But Inspector Rodgers says he dragged it thoroughly.'</p>

  <p>'The sergeant in charge at Wickham Police Station says the mud in the bed
  of the Rushmere goes half-way to Australia.'</p>

  <p>'Yes. I know. The Chief Constable, I understand, made the same observation
  in a less vivid phrase.'</p>

  <p>'After all,' Williams said not listening, 'what <i>could</i> have become
  of him if he didn't drown? If all reports are true he wasn't a type you look
  at and never remember.'</p>

  <p>No. That was true. Grant thought of the young man who had stood in Cormac
  Ross's doorway, and reflected how little the official description of the
  missing man conveyed the individual they were looking for.</p>

  <p>A man, in his early twenties, five feet eight-and-a-half or nine inches,
  slim build, very fair, grey eyes, straight nose, cheek bones rather high,
  wide mouth; hatless; wearing belted mackintosh over grey tweed jacket, grey
  pullover, blue sports shirt, and grey flannels, brown American shoes with
  instep buckle instead of lacing; low voice with American accent.</p>

  <p>No one reading that description would visualise the actuality that was
  Leslie Searle. On the other hand, as Williams pointed out, no one could set
  eyes on the actual Searle and not look back for a second glance. No one would
  see him and not remember.</p>

  <p>'Besides, what could he want to disappear <i>for</i>?' persisted
  Williams.</p>

  <p>'That I can't guess without knowing much more of his background. I must
  get the Yard on to it first thing tomorrow. There's a female cousin somewhere
  in England, but it is his American background that I want to know about. I
  can't help feeling that the bumping-off trade is more native to California
  than it is to the B.B.C.'</p>

  <p>'No one from California took whatever it was from Searle's case,' Williams
  pointed out.</p>

  <p>'No,' Grant said, contemplative; and went over the inhabitants of
  Trimmings in his mind. Tomorrow he would have to begin the collection of
  alibis. Williams was of course right. It was unlikely to the point of fantasy
  that Searle should have disappeared in such a manner of his own accord. He
  had suggested to Liz Garrowby that Searle might have planned a practical joke
  for Walter's discomfiture, and Liz had scorned the suggestion. But even if
  Liz had been wrong in her estimate, how could Searle have done it?</p>

  <p>'There is still your passing motorist,' he said aloud.</p>

  <p>'What's that, sir?'</p>

  <p>'We have interviewed the people on the regular transport services, but we
  have had no way yet of reaching the casual motorist who might have given him
  a lift.'</p>

  <p>Williams, dilated with sausage and beer, smiled benevolently on him. 'You
  make the Fifty-seventh look like a girl's school, sir.'</p>

  <p>'The Fifty-seventh?'</p>

  <p>'You die awfully hard. You still in love with that theory about his
  ducking of his own accord?'</p>

  <p>'I still think that he could have walked on from the river bend, up across
  the fields, to the main Wickham-Crome road and got a lift there. I'll ask
  Bryce in the morning if we could have a radio S.O.S. about it.'</p>

  <p>'And after he got the lift, sir? What then? All his luggage is at
  Trimmings.'</p>

  <p>'We don't know that. We don't know anything about him before he walked
  into that party of Ross's. He is a photographer; that is all we know for
  certain. He says he has only a female cousin in England but he may have half
  a dozen homes and a dozen wives for all we know.'</p>

  <p>'Maybe, but why not go in a natural fashion when this trip was finished?
  After all, he would want to collect on that book they were doing, surely? Why
  all the mumbo-jumbo?'</p>

  <p>'To make things awkward for Walter, perhaps.'</p>

  <p>'Yes? You think that? Why?'</p>

  <p>'Perhaps because I wouldn't mind making things awkward for Walter myself,'
  Grant said with a half smile. 'Perhaps after all it is just wishful-thinking
  on my part.'</p>

  <p>'It certainly is going to be very uncomfortable for Whitmore,' Williams
  said, without any noticeable regret.</p>

  <p>'Very. Shouldn't wonder if it leads to civil war.'</p>

  <p>'War?'</p>

  <p>'The Faithful Whitmorites versus the Doubters.'</p>

  <p>'Is he taking it hard?'</p>

  <p>'I don't think he quite realises yet what has hit him. He won't, I think,
  until he sees the daily Press tomorrow morning.'</p>

  <p>'Haven't the Press been at him already?'</p>

  <p>'They haven't had time. The <i>Clarion</i> arrived on the doorstep at five
  this afternoon, I understand, and went away to get information at the Swan
  when he failed to get it at Trimmings.'</p>

  <p>'Trust the <i>Clarion</i> to be first. Whitmore would have done better to
  see whoever it was. Why didn't he?'</p>

  <p>'Waiting for his lawyer to arrive from town, so he said.'</p>

  <p>'Who was it, do you know? The <i>Clarion</i>.'</p>

  <p>'Jammy Hopkins.'</p>

  <p>'Jammy! I'd as soon have a flame-thrower on my tail as Jammy Hopkins. He
  has no conscience whatever. He'll make up a story out of whole cloth if he
  doesn't get an interview. You know, I begin to be sorry for Walter Whitmore.
  He couldn't really have given a thought to Jammy, or he wouldn't have been so
  quick to shove Searle into the river.'</p>

  <p>'And who is being Die-Hard now?' Grant said.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch11"
     id="ch11"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>

  <p class="first">IN the morning Grant telephoned to his chief, but he had no
  sooner begun his story than Bryce interrupted him.</p>

  <p>'That you, Grant? You send back that Man Friday of yours straight away.
  Benny Skoll cleaned out Poppy Plumtre's bedroom safe last night.'</p>

  <p>'I thought all Poppy's valuables were with Uncle.'</p>

  <p>'Not since she got herself a new daddy.'</p>

  <p>'Are you sure that it's Benny?'</p>

  <p>'Quite sure. It has all his trade-marks. The telephone call to get the
  hall porter out of the way, the lack of fingerprints, the bread-and-jam and
  milk meal, the exit by the service entrance. Short of signing his name in the
  visitors' book, he couldn't have written his signature more clearly over
  it.'</p>

  <p>'Ah, well; the day criminals learn to vary their technique we go out of
  business.'</p>

  <p>'I need Williams to pick up Benny. Williams knows Benny like a book. So
  send him back. How are you doing?'</p>

  <p>'Not too well.'</p>

  <p>'No? How?'</p>

  <p>'We have no corpse. So we have two possibilities: Searle is dead, either
  by accident or by design; or he has just disappeared for ends of his
  own.'</p>

  <p>'What sort of ends?'</p>

  <p>'Practical joke, perhaps.'</p>

  <p>'He had better not try that stuff with us.'</p>

  <p>'It might, of course, be plain amnesia.'</p>

  <p>'It had better be.'</p>

  <p>'There are two things I need, sir. A radio S.O.S. is one. And the other is
  some information from the San Francisco police about Searle. We are working
  in the dark, knowing nothing about him. His only relation in England is a
  cousin; a woman artist, with whom he had no contact. Or says he hadn't. She
  will probably get in touch with us when she sees the papers this morning. But
  she will probably know very little about him.'</p>

  <p>'And you think the San Francisco police will know more?'</p>

  <p>'Well, San Francisco was his headquarters, I understand, when he spent the
  winter months on the Coast, and they can no doubt dig up something about him
  there. Let us know whether he ever was in any bother and if anyone was liable
  to kill him for any reason.'</p>

  <p>'A lot of people would like to kill a photographer, I should think. Yes,
  we'll do that.'</p>

  <p>'Thank you, sir. And about the S.O.S.?'</p>

  <p>'The B.B.C. don't like their nice little radio cluttered up with police
  messages. What did you want to say?'</p>

  <p>'I want to ask anyone who gave a lift to a young man between Wickham and
  Crome on Wednesday night to get in touch with us.'</p>

  <p>'Yes, I'll see to that. I suppose you have covered all the regular
  services?'</p>

  <p>'Everything, sir. Not a sign of him anywhere. And he is hardly
  inconspicuous. Short of his having a rendezvous with a waiting
  plane&mdash;which only happens in boys' stories, as far as I'm
  aware&mdash;the only way he could have got away from the district is by
  walking over the fields and getting a lift on the main road.'</p>

  <p>'No evidence of homicide?'</p>

  <p>'None so far. But I shall see what alibis the locals have, this
  morning.'</p>

  <p>'You push Williams off before you do anything else. I'll send the San
  Francisco information to the Wickham Station when it comes through.'</p>

  <p>'Very good, sir. Thank you.'</p>

  <p>Grant hung up and went to tell Williams.</p>

  <p>'Damn Benny,' Williams said. 'Just when I was beginning to like this bit
  of country. It's no day to wrestle with Benny anyhow.'</p>

  <p>'Is he tough?'</p>

  <p>'Benny? No! He's a horror. He'll cry and carry on and say that we are
  hounding him, and that he is no sooner out of stir and trying to make
  good&mdash;"make good"! Benny!&mdash;than we are down on him to come and be
  questioned, and what chance has he in the circs, and so on. He turns my
  stomach. If Benny saw an honest day's work coming his way he'd run for his
  life. He's a wonderful cryer, though. He once got a question asked in
  Parliament. You'd wonder how some of those M.P.s ever had brains enough to
  ask for a railway ticket from their home towns. Have I got to take a
  <i>train</i> to town?'</p>

  <p>'I expect Rodgers will give you a car to Crome and you can get a fast
  train there,' Grant said, smiling at the horror on his colleague's face at
  the thought of train travel. He himself went back to the telephone and called
  Marta Hallard at the Mill House in Salcott St Mary.</p>

  <p>'Alan!' she said. 'How nice. Where are you?'</p>

  <p>'At the White Hart in Wickham.'</p>

  <p>'You poor dear!'</p>

  <p>'Oh, it isn't too bad.'</p>

  <p>'Don't be so noble. You know it is primitive to the point of being
  penitential. Have you heard about our latest sensation, by the way?'</p>

  <p>'I have. That is why I am in Wickham.'</p>

  <p>There was a complete silence at that.</p>

  <p>Then Marta said: 'You mean the <i>Yard</i> are interested in Leslie
  Searle's drowning?'</p>

  <p>'In Searle's disappearance, let us say.'</p>

  <p>'You mean, that there is some truth in this rumour of a quarrel with
  Walter?'</p>

  <p>'I'm afraid I can't discuss it over the telephone. What I wanted to ask
  you was whether you would be at home this evening if I came along.'</p>

  <p>'But you must come and stay, of course. You can't stay at that dreary
  place. I'll tell Mrs&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Thank you with all my heart, but I can't do that. I must be here in
  Wickham at the centre of things. But if you like to give me
  dinner&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Of course I shall give you dinner. You shall have a beautiful meal, my
  dear. With one of my omelets and one of Mrs Thrupp's chickens, and a bottle
  from the cellar that will take the taste of the White Hart beer out of your
  mouth.'</p>

  <p>So, a little heartened at the prospect of civilisation at the end of the
  day, Grant went out on his day's task, and he began with Trimmings. If there
  was to be a reckoning of alibis it was fitting that the inhabitants of
  Trimmings should be the first to give an account of themselves.</p>

  <p>It was a fine blue morning, growing soft after an early frost, and no day,
  as Williams had pointed out, to waste on the Bennys of this life; but the
  sight of Trimmings standing up unblushingly in the bright sunlight restored
  Grant's wavering good humour. Last night it had been a lighted doorway in the
  dark. Today it stood revealed, extravagantly monstrous, in all its smug
  detail, and Grant was so enraptured that his foot came down on the brake and
  he brought the car to a standstill at the curve of the drive, and sat there
  gazing.</p>

  <p>'I know just how you are feeling,' a voice said at his elbow. And there
  was Liz; a little heavy-eyed, he noticed, but otherwise calm and
  friendly.</p>

  <p>'Good morning,' he said. 'I was a little dashed this morning because I
  couldn't drop everything and go fishing. But I feel better now.'</p>

  <p>'It is a beauty, isn't it,' she agreed. 'You don't quite believe it is
  there at all. You feel that no one could possibly have thought it up; it just
  appeared.'</p>

  <p>Her thoughts shifted from the house to his presence, and he saw the
  question coming.</p>

  <p>'I am sorry to be a nuisance, but I am busy this morning getting rid of
  the undergrowth in this case.'</p>

  <p>'Undergrowth?'</p>

  <p>'I want to get rid of all the people who can't possibly enter into the
  case at all.'</p>

  <p>'I see. You are collecting alibis.'</p>

  <p>'Yes.' He opened the car door, so that she might ride the short distance
  to the house.</p>

  <p>'Well, I hope we have good ones. I regret to say that I haven't one at
  all. It was the first thing I thought of when I knew who you were. It's very
  odd, isn't it, how guilty an innocent person feels when he can't account for
  himself on the umpteenth inst. Do you want everyone's alibi? Aunt Lavinia's
  and mother's and all?'</p>

  <p>'And those of the staff, too. Of everyone who had any connection with
  Leslie Searle.'</p>

  <p>'Well, you had better start with Aunt Vin. Before she begins her morning
  chore. She dictates for two hours every morning, and she likes to begin
  punctually.'</p>

  <p>'Where were you, Miss Garrowby?' he asked as they arrived at the door.</p>

  <p>'At the material time?' He thought she was being deliberately cold-blooded
  about it; the 'material time' was when Leslie Searle had presumably lost his
  life, and he did not think that she was forgetting that fact.</p>

  <p>'Yes. On Wednesday night.'</p>

  <p>'I had what they call in detective stories "retired to my room". And don't
  tell me that it was "early to retire", either. I know it was. I like going
  upstairs early. I like being alone at the end of the day.'</p>

  <p>'Do you read?'</p>

  <p>'Don't tell, Inspector, but I write.'</p>

  <p>'You too?'</p>

  <p>'Do I disappoint you?'</p>

  <p>'You interest me. What do you write&mdash;or shouldn't I ask?'</p>

  <p>'I write innocuous heroines out of my system, that's all.'</p>

  <p>'Tilda the tweeny with the hare-lip and the homicidal tendencies, as
  antidote to Maureen.'</p>

  <p>She looked at him for a long moment and then said: 'You are a very odd
  sort of policeman.'</p>

  <p>'I suspect that it is your idea of policemen that is odd,' Grant said
  briskly. 'Will you tell your aunt that I am here?'</p>

  <p>But there was no need to announce him. Miss Fitch was in the hall as Liz
  ran up the steps, and she said in tones more surprised than grieved:</p>

  <p>'Liz, you are five minutes late!' Then she saw the Inspector, and said:
  'Well, well, they were right. They said that no one would ever take you for a
  policeman. Come in, Inspector. I have wanted so much to meet you. Officially,
  as it were. Our last encounter could hardly be termed a meeting, could it.
  Come into the morning-room. That is where I work.'</p>

  <p>Grant apologised for keeping her from her morning's dictation, but she
  professed herself glad to postpone for at least ten minutes her business with
  'the tiresome girl'. Grant took the 'tiresome girl' to be the current Fitch
  heroine.</p>

  <p>Miss Fitch, too, it seemed, had retired early on Wednesday night. At
  half-past nine, to be exact.</p>

  <p>'When a family are in each other's pocket all day long, as we are,' she
  said, 'they tend to go to their rooms early at night.' She had watched a
  radio play, and had lain awake a little, half-listening for her sister coming
  in, but had fallen asleep quite early after all.</p>

  <p>'Coming in?' Grant said. 'Was Mrs Garrowby out, then?'</p>

  <p>'Yes. She was at a W.R.I. meeting.'</p>

  <p>He asked her about Searle, then. What she had thought of him, and what in
  her opinion he was liable to do or not to do. She was surprisingly guarded
  about Searle, he thought; as if she were picking her steps; and he wondered
  why.</p>

  <p>When he said: 'Did Searle, in your opinion, show signs of being in love
  with your niece?' she looked startled, and said 'No, of course not!' too
  quickly and too emphatically.</p>

  <p>'He did not pay her attentions?'</p>

  <p>'My dear man,' Miss Fitch said, '<i>any</i> American pays a girl
  attentions. It is a conditioned reflex. As automatic as breathing.'</p>

  <p>'You think he was not seriously interested in her?'</p>

  <p>'I am sure that he wasn't.'</p>

  <p>'Your nephew told me last night that he and Searle had telephoned to you
  each night on their way down the river.'</p>

  <p>'Yes.'</p>

  <p>'Did everyone in the household know about the message on Wednesday night?
  I mean, know where the two men were camped?'</p>

  <p>'I expect so. The family certainly did; and the staff were always anxious
  to hear about their progress so I suppose everyone knew.'</p>

  <p>'Thank you very much, Miss Fitch. You have been very kind.'</p>

  <p>She called Liz in, and Liz took him to her mother and went back to the
  morning-room to record the doings of the latest Maureen.</p>

  <p>Mrs Garrowby was another person without an alibi. She had been at the
  W.R.I. meeting at the village hall, had left there when the meeting broke up
  at half-past nine, had accompanied Miss Easton-Dixon part of the way home and
  had left her where their roads branched. She had come in about ten; or later,
  perhaps: she had strolled home because it was a lovely night; and had locked
  up the front of the house. The back door was always locked by Mrs Brett, the
  cook-housekeeper.</p>

  <p>Emma Garrowby did not fool Grant for a moment. He had met her counterpart
  too often; that ruthless maternalism masquerading in a placid exterior. Had
  Searle got in the way of plans she had made for her daughter?</p>

  <p>He asked her about Searle, and there was no step-picking at all. He had
  been a charming young man, she said. Quite exceptionally charming. They all
  liked him enormously, and were shattered by this tragedy.</p>

  <p>Grant caught himself receiving this mentally with an expressive
  monosyllable.</p>

  <p>He felt a little suffocated by Mrs Garrowby, and was glad when she went
  away to find Alice for him.</p>

  <p>Alice had been walked-out on Wednesday night by the under-gardener, and
  had come in at a quarter past ten, whereupon the door had been locked behind
  her by Mrs Brett, and they had gone up together, after having a cup of cocoa,
  to their rooms in the back wing. Alice really was shattered by the fate that
  had overtaken Leslie Searle. Never, she said, had she had to do for a nicer
  young man. She had met dozens of young men, gentlemen <i>and</i> others, who
  considered a girl's ankles, but Mr Searle was the only one she had ever met
  who considered a girl's feet.</p>

  <p>'<i>Feet?</i>'</p>

  <p>She had said as much to Mrs Brett, and to Edith, the parlourmaid. He would
  say: 'You can do this or that, and that will save you coming up again, won't
  it.' And she could only conclude that this was an American characteristic,
  because no Englishman she had ever come across had ever cared two hoots
  whether you had to come up again or not.</p>

  <p>Edith, too, it seemed, mourned for Leslie Searle; not because he
  considered her feet but because he was so good-looking. Edith proved to be
  very superior and refayned. Much too refayned to be walked out by an
  under-gardener. She had gone to her room to watch the same play that her
  mistress was watching. She heard Mrs Brett and Alice come up to bed, but the
  wing bedrooms were too far away to hear anyone come into the main block, so
  she did not know when Mrs Garrowby had come in.</p>

  <p>Neither did Mrs Brett. After dinner, Mrs Brett said, the family did not
  worry the staff at all. Edith laid out the bed-time drinks, and after that
  the baize door in the hall was not normally opened again until the following
  morning. Mrs Brett had been nine years with Miss Fitch, and Miss Fitch could
  trust her to manage the staff and the staff premises.</p>

  <p>When Grant went to the front door on his way to the car he found Walter
  Whitmore propped against the terrace wall. He bade Grant good morning and
  hoped that the alibis had been satisfactory.</p>

  <p>It seemed to Grant that Walter Whitmore was visibly deteriorating. Even
  the few hours since last night had made a difference. He wondered how much a
  reading of this morning's papers had contributed to the slackening of
  Walter's facial structure.</p>

  <p>'Have the Press been hounding you yet?' he asked.</p>

  <p>'They were here just after breakfast.'</p>

  <p>'Did you talk to them?'</p>

  <p>'I saw them, if that is what you mean. There wasn't much I could say.
  They'll get far more copy down at the Swan.'</p>

  <p>'Did your lawyer come?'</p>

  <p>'Yes. He's asleep.'</p>

  <p>'Asleep!'</p>

  <p>'He left London at half-past five, and saw me through the interview. He
  had to leave things in a hurry so he didn't get to bed last night till two
  this morning. If you take my meaning.'</p>

  <p>Grant left him with an illogical feeling of relief and went down to the
  Swan. He ran his car into the paved brick yard at the rear of it and knocked
  at the side door.</p>

  <p>A bolt was drawn with noisy impatience, and Reeve's face appeared in the
  gap. 'It's not a bit of use,' he said. 'You'll have to wait till opening
  time.'</p>

  <p>'As a policeman, I appreciate that snub at its true value,' Grant said.
  'But I'd like to come in and talk to you for a moment.'</p>

  <p>'You look more Service than Police, if you ask me,' said the ex-Marine,
  amused, as he led the way into the bar parlour. 'You're the spit of a Major
  we had with us Up The Straights once. Vandaleur was his name. Ever come
  across him?'</p>

  <p>Grant had not come across Major Vandaleur.</p>

  <p>'Well, what can I do for you, sir? It's about this Searle affair, I take
  it.'</p>

  <p>'Yes. You can do two things for me. I want your considered
  opinion&mdash;and I mean considered&mdash;on the relations between Whitmore
  and Searle on Wednesday evening. And I should like a list of all the people
  in the bar that night and the times they left.'</p>

  <p>Reeve had all a service man's objective attitude to a happening. He had no
  desire to dress it up, or to make it reflect his own personality as an artist
  did. Grant felt himself relaxing. It was almost like listening to the report
  of one of his own men. There was no obvious ill-feeling between the men,
  Reeve said. He would not have noticed them at all, if they had not been
  isolated by the fact that no one moved away from the bar to join them.
  Normally, someone or other would have moved over to resume a conversation
  that had begun when they were at the bar together. But on Wednesday there was
  something in their unconsciousness of the rest that kept people from
  intruding.</p>

  <p>'They were like two dogs walking round each other,' Reeve said. 'No row,
  but a sort of atmosphere. The row might burst out any minute, if you see what
  I mean.'</p>

  <p>'Did you see Whitmore go?'</p>

  <p>'No one did. The boys were having an argument about who played cricket for
  Australia in what year. They paused when the door banged, that was all. Then
  Bill Maddox, seeing that Searle was alone, went over and talked to him.
  Maddox keeps the garage at the end of the village.'</p>

  <p>'Thanks. And now the list of those in the bar.'</p>

  <p>Grant wrote the list down; county names, most of them, unchanged since
  Domesday Book. As he went out to get his car he said: 'Have you any Press
  staying in the house?'</p>

  <p>'Three,' Reeve said. 'The <i>Clarion</i>, the <i>Morning News</i>, and the
  <i>Post</i>. They're all out now, sucking the village dry.'</p>

  <p>'Also ran: Scotland Yard,' Grant said wryly, and drove away to see Bill
  Maddox.</p>

  <p>At the end of the village was a high clapboarded structure on which faded
  paint said: WILLIAM MADDOX AND SON, CARPENTERS AND BOATBUILDERS. At one
  corner of this building a bright black and yellow sign pointed into the yard
  at the side and said simply: GARAGE.</p>

  <p>'You manage to make the best of both worlds, I see,' he said to Bill
  Maddox when he had introduced himself, and tilted his head at the sign.</p>

  <p>'Oh, MADDOX AND SON is Father, not me.'</p>

  <p>'I thought that perhaps you were "SON".'</p>

  <p>Bill looked amused. 'Oh, no; my <i>grandfather</i> was SON. That's my
  greatgrandfather's business. And still the best woodworkers this side of the
  county, though it's me that says it. You looking for information,
  Inspector?'</p>

  <p>Grant got all the information Maddox could give him, and as he was going
  away Maddox said: 'You happen to know a newspaper-man called Hopkins, by any
  chance?'</p>

  <p>'Hopkins of the <i>Clarion</i>? We have met.'</p>

  <p>'He was round here for hours this morning, and do you know what that bloke
  actually believes? He believes that the whole thing is just a publicity stunt
  to sell that book they planned to write.'</p>

  <p>The combination of this typically Hopkins reaction and Bill's bewildered
  face was too much for Grant. He leant against the car and laughed.</p>

  <p>'It's a debasing life, a journalist's,' he said. 'And Jammy Hopkins is a
  born debase-ee, as a friend of mine would say.'</p>

  <p>'Oh,' said Bill, still puzzled. 'Silly, I call it. Plain silly.'</p>

  <p>'Do you know where I can find Serge Ratoff, by the way?'</p>

  <p>'I don't suppose he's out of bed yet, but if he is you'll find him
  propping up the counter of the post-office. The post-office is in the shop.
  Half-way up the street. Serge lives in the lean-to place next door to
  it.'</p>

  <p>But Serge had not yet reached his daily stance by the post-office counter.
  He was coming down the street from the newsagent's with a paper under his
  arm. Grant had never seen him before, but he knew the occupational signs well
  enough to spot a dancer in a village street. The limp clothes covering an
  apparently weedy body, the general air of undernourishment, the wilting
  appearance that made one feel that the muscles must be flabby as tired
  elastic. It was a never-ceasing amazement to Grant that the flashing
  creatures who tossed ballerinas about with no more effort than a slight
  gritting of teeth, went out of the stage door looking like under-privileged
  barrow boys.</p>

  <p>He brought the car to a halt at the pavement as he came level with Serge,
  and greeted him.</p>

  <p>'Mr Ratoff?'</p>

  <p>'That is me.'</p>

  <p>'I'm Detective-Inspector Grant. May I speak to you for a moment?'</p>

  <p>'Everyone speaks to me,' Serge said complacently. 'Why not you?'</p>

  <p>'It is about Leslie Searle.'</p>

  <p>'Ah, yes. He has become drowned. Delightful.'</p>

  <p>Grant offered some phrases on the virtue of discretion.</p>

  <p>'Ah, <i>discretion</i>!' said Serge, making five syllables of it. 'A
  bourgeois quality.'</p>

  <p>'I understand that you had a quarrel with Searle.'</p>

  <p>'Nothing of the sort.'</p>

  <p>'But&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'I fling a mug of beer in his face, that is all.'</p>

  <p>'And you don't call that a quarrel?'</p>

  <p>'Of <i>course</i> not. To quarrel is to be on a level, equal, how do you
  say, of the same rank. One does not quarrel with <i>canaille</i>. My
  grandfather in Russia would have taken a whip to him. This is England and
  decadent, and so I fling beer over him. It is a gesture, at least.'</p>

  <p>When Grant recounted this conversation to Marta, she said: 'I can't think
  what Serge would do without that grandfather in Russia. His father left
  Russia when he was three&mdash;Serge can't speak a word of Russian and he is
  half Neapolitan anyhow&mdash;but all his fantasies are built on that
  grandfather in Russia.'</p>

  <p>'You will understand,' Grant said patiently, 'that it is necessary for the
  police to ask all those who knew Searle for an account of their movements on
  Wednesday night.'</p>

  <p>'Is it? How tiresome for you. It is a sad life, a policeman's. The
  movements. So limited, so rudimentary.' Serge made himself into a semaphore,
  and worked his arms marionette-wise in a travesty of point-duty signals.
  'Tiresome. Very tiresome. Lucid, of course, but without subtlety.'</p>

  <p>'Where were you on Wednesday night from nine o'clock onwards?' Grant said,
  deciding that an indirect approach was just a waste of time.</p>

  <p>'I was dancing,' Serge said.</p>

  <p>'Oh. At the village hall?'</p>

  <p>Serge looked as if he were going to faint.</p>

  <p>'You suggest that <i>I</i>, that I, <i>Serge Ratoff</i>, was taking part
  in a '<i>op</i>?'</p>

  <p>'Then where were you dancing?'</p>

  <p>'By the river.'</p>

  <p>'<i>What?</i>'</p>

  <p>'I work out the choreography for a new ballet. I burst with ideas there by
  the river on a spring night. They rise up in me like fountains. There is so
  much atmosphere there that I get drunk on it. I can do anything. I work out a
  very charming idea to go with the river music of Mashako. It begins with
  a&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'What part of the river?'</p>

  <p>'What?'</p>

  <p>'What <i>part</i> of the river?'</p>

  <p>'How should I know? The atmosphere is the same over all.'</p>

  <p>'Well, did you go up river or down, from Salcott?'</p>

  <p>'Oh, up, most certainly.'</p>

  <p>'Why "most certainly"?'</p>

  <p>'I need the wide flat spaces to dance. Up river they are there. Down river
  from the village it is all steep banks and tiresome root crops. Roots.
  Clumsy, obscene things. They&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Could you identify the place where you were dancing on Wednesday
  night?'</p>

  <p>'Identify?'</p>

  <p>'Point it out to me.'</p>

  <p>'How can I? I don't even remember where it was.'</p>

  <p>'Can you remember if you saw anyone while you were there?'</p>

  <p>'No one who was memorable?'</p>

  <p>'Memorable?'</p>

  <p>'I trip over lovers in the grass now and then, but they&mdash;how you say,
  go with the house. They are part of the&mdash;the set-up. Not memorable.'</p>

  <p>'Do you remember, then, what time you left the river bank on Wednesday
  night?'</p>

  <p>'Ah, yes, that I remember perfectly.'</p>

  <p>'When was it that you left?'</p>

  <p>'When the shooting star fell.'</p>

  <p>'What time was that?'</p>

  <p>'How should I know? I dislike shooting stars. They make butterflies in my
  stomach. Though I did think that it would be a very fine ending to my ballet
  to have a shooting star. A <i>Spectre de la Rose</i> leap, you know, that
  would set the town talking, and show them that I can still&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Mr Ratoff, can you suggest how Leslie Searle came to be in the
  river?'</p>

  <p>'Came to be? He fell in, I suppose. Such a pity. Pollution. The river is
  so beautiful it should be kept for beautiful things. Ophelia. Shallott. Do
  you think Shallott would make a ballet? All the things she sees in the
  mirror? It is an idea, that, isn't it?'</p>

  <p>Grant gave up.</p>

  <p>He left his car where it was and walked up the street to where the flat
  stone front of Hoo House broke the pinks and chromes and limes of the
  village's plastered gables. The house stood on the pavement like the other
  cottages, but three steps to the front door raised the ground floor of the
  house above street level. It withdrew itself a little, in a dignity entirely
  natural, from everyday affairs. As Grant pulled the Victorian bell in its
  bright brass circle he spared a thought to bless the man, whoever he was, who
  had been responsible for restoring the place. He had preserved the structure
  but had made no attempt to turn it back into its original form and so make a
  museum piece of it; the tale of the centuries was there, from the worn
  mounting-block to the brass bell. A great amount of money had obviously been
  spent to bring it to its present condition of worthiness, and Grant wondered
  if perhaps the saving of Hoo House was sufficient to justify Toby Tullis's
  existence.</p>

  <p>The door was opened by a manservant who might have walked out of one of
  Toby's plays. He stood in the doorway, polite but impenetrable; a one-man
  road-block.</p>

  <p>'Mr Tullis does not see anyone before lunch,' he said in answer to Grant's
  inquiry. 'He works in the morning. The appointment with the Press is for two
  o'clock.' He began to move his hand towards the door.</p>

  <p>'Do I look like Press?' Grant said tartly.</p>

  <p>'Well&mdash;no, I can't say that you do&mdash;sir.'</p>

  <p>'Shouldn't you have a little tray?' Grant said, suddenly silky.</p>

  <p>The man turned submissively and took a silver card tray from the Jacobean
  chest in the hall.</p>

  <p>Grant dropped a piece of pasteboard on to the tray and said: 'Present my
  compliments to Mr Tullis and say that I would be grateful for three minutes
  of his time.'</p>

  <p>'Certainly, sir,' said the man, not allowing his eyes to stray even to the
  vicinity of the card. 'Will you be kind enough to step into the hall and
  wait.'</p>

  <p>He disappeared into a room at the rear of the house, and closed the door
  behind him on some very unworkmanlike sounds of chatter. But he was back in a
  moment. Would Inspector Grant come this way, please. Mr Tullis would be very
  pleased to see him.</p>

  <p>The room at the back, Grant found, looked into a large garden sloping down
  to the river-bank; it was another world altogether from the village street
  that he had just left. It was a sitting-room, furnished with the most perfect
  'pieces' that Grant had ever seen out of a museum. Toby, in a remarkable
  dressing-gown, was sitting behind an array of silver coffee things; and
  behind him, in still more remarkable day clothes, hovered a callow and eager
  young man clutching a notebook. The notebook, from its virgin condition,
  appeared to be more a badge of office than the implement of a craft.</p>

  <p>'You are modest, Inspector!' Toby said, greeting him.</p>

  <p>'Modest?'</p>

  <p>'Three minutes! Even the Press expect ten.'</p>

  <p>It had been meant as a compliment to Grant, but the effect was merely a
  reminder that Toby was the most-interviewed individual in the
  English-speaking world and that his time was priceless. As always, what Toby
  did was a little 'off-key'.</p>

  <p>He presented the young man as Giles Verlaine, his secretary, and offered
  Grant coffee. Grant said that it was at once too late and too early for him,
  but would Mr Tullis go on with his breakfast; and Toby did.</p>

  <p>'I am investigating the disappearance of Leslie Searle,' Grant said. 'And
  that involves, I'm afraid, some disturbance of people who are only remotely
  connected with Searle. We have to ask everyone at Salcott who knew Searle to
  account for their time, as far as they can, on Wednesday night.'</p>

  <p>'Inspector, you offer me a felicity I had never hoped to enjoy. I have
  always been madly desirous of being asked what I was doing at nine-thirty
  p.m. on the night of Friday the 13th, but I never really dared to hope that
  it would happen to me.'</p>

  <p>'Now that it has happened, I hope your alibi is worthy of the
  occasion.'</p>

  <p>'It has the virtue of simplicity, at least. Giles and I spent the hours of
  that lovely midnight discussing Act II, Scene 1. Pedestrian, Inspector, but
  necessary. I am a business man.'</p>

  <p>Grant glanced from the business man to Giles, and decided that in his
  present stage of discipleship the young man would probably confess to the
  murder if it would pleasure Toby. A little thing like providing an alibi
  would be merely routine.</p>

  <p>'And Mr Verlaine corroborates that, of course,' Grant said.</p>

  <p>'Yes, oh yes, of course; of course I do; yes,' said Giles, squandering
  affirmatives in the service of his patron.</p>

  <p>'It is a tragic thing indeed, this drowning,' Toby said, sipping coffee.
  'The sum total of the world's beauty is not so great that we can afford to
  waste any. A Shelleyan end, of course, and to that extent fitting. Do you
  know the Shelley Memorial at Oxford, Inspector?'</p>

  <p>Grant knew the Memorial and it reminded him of an overboiled chicken, but
  he refrained from saying so. Nor did Toby expect an answer.</p>

  <p>'A lovely thing. Drowning is surely the ideal way of going out of this
  life.'</p>

  <p>'After a close acquaintance with a great variety of corpses taken from the
  water, I can't say that I agree with you.'</p>

  <p>Toby cocked a fish-scale eye at him, and said: 'Don't shatter my
  illusions, Inspector. You are worse than Silas Weekley. Silas is always
  pointing out the nastiness of life. Have you got Silas's alibi, by the
  way?'</p>

  <p>'Not yet. I understand that he hardly knew Mr Searle.'</p>

  <p>'That wouldn't stop Silas. I shouldn't wonder if he did it as a bit of
  local colour.'</p>

  <p>'Local colour?'</p>

  <p>'Yes. According to Silas country existence is one cesspool of rape,
  murder, incest, abortion, and suicide, and perhaps Silas thinks that it is
  time that Salcott St Mary lived up to his idea of it. Do you read our Silas,
  Inspector?'</p>

  <p>'I'm afraid not.'</p>

  <p>'Don't apologise. It's an acquired taste. Even his wife hasn't acquired it
  yet, if all reports are true. But then, poor woman, she is so busy suckling
  and suffering that she probably has no time to spare for the consideration of
  the abstract. No one seems to have indicated to her the possibilities of
  contraception. Of course, Silas has a "thing" about fertility. He holds that
  the highest function of a woman is the manufacture of progeny. So
  disheartening for a woman, don't you feel, to be weighed against a rabbit,
  and to know that she will inevitably be found wanting. Life, by Fertility out
  of Ugliness. That is how Silas sees it. He hates beauty. Beauty is an
  offence. He must mash it down and make it fertile. Make mulch of it. Of
  course he is just a little crazy, poor sweet, but it is a very profitable
  kind of craziness, so one need not drench oneself in tears about it. One of
  the secrets of a successful life is to know how to be a little profitably
  crazy.'</p>

  <p>Grant wondered whether this was merely a normal sample of Toby's chatter,
  or whether it was designed to edge him on to Silas Weekley. Where a man's
  personality is entirely façade, as in the case of Toby Tullis, it was
  difficult to decide how much of the façade was barricade and how much was
  mere poster-hoarding.</p>

  <p>'You didn't see Searle at all on Wednesday evening?' he said.</p>

  <p>No, Toby had not seen him. His time for the pub was before dinner, not
  after.</p>

  <p>'I don't want to be intrusive, Inspector, but there seems to me a needless
  furore over a simple drowning.'</p>

  <p>'Why drowning?'</p>

  <p>'Why not?'</p>

  <p>'We have no evidence at all that Searle was drowned, and some fairly
  conclusive evidence that he wasn't.'</p>

  <p>'That he wasn't? What evidence have you that he wasn't?'</p>

  <p>'The river has been dragged for his body.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, that!'</p>

  <p>'What we are investigating, Mr Tullis, is the disappearance of a man in
  Salcott St Mary on Wednesday night.'</p>

  <p>'You really ought to see the vicar, Inspector. He has the perfect solution
  for you.'</p>

  <p>'And what is that?'</p>

  <p>'The dear vicar believes that Searle was never really here at all. He
  holds that Searle was merely a demon who took human shape for a little, and
  disappeared when the joke grew stale or the&mdash;the juice ran dry, so to
  speak.'</p>

  <p>'Very interesting.'</p>

  <p>'I suppose you never saw Searle, Inspector?'</p>

  <p>'Oh, yes. I have met him.'</p>

  <p>This surprised Toby so much that Grant was amused.</p>

  <p>'The demon attended a party in Bloomsbury, just before he came to
  Salcott,' he said.</p>

  <p>'My dear Inspector, you <i>must</i> see the vicar. This contribution to
  the predilections of demons is of inestimable value to research.'</p>

  <p>'Why did you ask me if I had ever seen Searle?'</p>

  <p>'Because he was so perfectly what one would imagine a materialised demon
  to be.'</p>

  <p>'His good-looks, you mean?'</p>

  <p>'Was it only a question of good-looks?' Toby said, half quizzing half in
  challenge.</p>

  <p>'No,' said Grant. 'No.'</p>

  <p>'Do you think Searle was a wrong 'un?' Toby said, forgetting the façade
  for a moment and dropping into the vernacular.</p>

  <p>'There is no evidence whatever on that score.'</p>

  <p>'Ah, me,' Toby said, resuming the façade with a small mock-sigh. 'The
  blank wall of bureaucratic caution. I have few ambitions left in life,
  Inspector, but one of them is a passionate desire to know what made Leslie
  Searle tick.'</p>

  <p>'If I ever find out, bureaucratic caution will crack sufficiently to let
  you know,' Grant said, getting up to go.</p>

  <p>He stood for a moment looking out at the bright garden with the gleam of
  the river at the far end.</p>

  <p>'This might be a country house, miles from anywhere,' he said.</p>

  <p>Toby said that that was one of the charms of Hoo House, but that, of
  course, most of the cottages on the river side of the street had gardens that
  ran to the river, but most of them were broken into allotments or market
  gardens of some sort. It was the keeping of the Hoo House grounds as lawns
  and trees that made it spacious seeming.</p>

  <p>'And the river makes a boundary without breaking the view. It is a sadly
  mixed blessing, the river.'</p>

  <p>'Mosquitoes?'</p>

  <p>'No; every now and then it has an overwhelming desire to get into the
  house. About once in every six winters it succeeds. My caretaker woke one
  morning last winter to find the boat knocking against his bedroom
  window.'</p>

  <p>'You keep a boat?'</p>

  <p>'Just as a prop. A punt affair that is pleasant to lie in on summer
  afternoons.'</p>

  <p>Grant thanked him for being so helpful, apologised once more for having
  intruded on his breakfast, and took his leave. Toby showed signs of wanting
  to show him the house, but Grant avoided that for three reasons: he had work
  to do, he had already seen most of the house in the illustrated press, and he
  had an odd reluctance to be shown the world's finest craftsmanship by a slick
  little operator like Toby Tullis.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch12"
     id="ch12"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>

  <p class="first">SILAS WEEKLEY lived in a cottage down the lane that led to
  the far bend of the river. Or rather, that started off towards the river. The
  lane, where it met the fields, turned at right-angles along the back of the
  village, only to turn up again and rejoin the village street. It was an
  entirely local affair. In the last cottage before the fields lived Silas
  Weekley, and Grant, 'proceeding' there police-fashion, was surprised to find
  it so poor a dwelling. It was not only that Weekley was a best-seller and
  could therefore afford a home that was more attractive than this, but there
  had been no effort to beautify the place; no generosity of paint and wash
  such as the other cottagers had used to make the street of Salcott St Mary a
  delight to the eye. No window plants, no trim curtains. The place had a slum
  air that was strange in its surroundings.</p>

  <p>The cottage door was open and the combined howls of an infant and a child
  poured out into the sunny morning. An enamel basin of dirty water stood in
  the porch, the soap bubbles on it bursting one by one in slow resignation. An
  animal toy of soft fur, so worn and grubby as to be unidentifiable as any
  known species, lay on the floor. The room beyond was unoccupied for the
  moment, and Grant stood observing it in a kind of wonder. It was poorly
  furnished and untidy beyond belief.</p>

  <p>The crying continued to come from some room in the rear, so Grant knocked
  loudly on the front door. At his second knock, a woman's voice called: 'Just
  leave it there, thank you.' At his third knock supplemented with a call, she
  came from the darkness at the back and moved forward to inspect him.</p>

  <p>'Mrs Weekley?' Grant said doubtfully.</p>

  <p>'Yes, I'm Mrs Weekley.'</p>

  <p>She must have been pretty once. Pretty and intelligent; and independent.
  Grant remembered hearing somewhere that Weekley had married an elementary
  school teacher. She was wearing a sacking apron over a print wrapper, and the
  kind of old shoes that a woman all too easily gets used to as good enough to
  do chores in. She had not bothered to put on stockings, and the shoes had
  left smudges on her bare insteps. Her unwaved hair was pulled back into a
  tight desperate knot, but the front strands were too short to be confined
  there for long and now hung down on either side of her face. It was a rather
  long face and very tired.</p>

  <p>Grant said that he would like to see her husband for a moment.</p>

  <p>'Oh.' She took it in slowly, as if her mind were still with the crying
  children. 'I'm sorry things are so untidy,' she said vaguely. 'My girl from
  the village didn't come today. She often doesn't. It just depends on how she
  is feeling. And with the children it is difficult&mdash;. I don't think I can
  disturb my husband in the middle of the morning.' Grant wondered whether she
  considered the children were making no disturbance at all. 'He writes in the
  morning, you see.'</p>

  <p>'I see. But if you would give him my card I think he will see me.'</p>

  <p>'Are you from the publishers?'</p>

  <p>'No, I'm&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Because I think it would be better to wait, and not interrupt him. He
  could meet you at the Swan, couldn't he? Just before lunch, perhaps.'</p>

  <p>'No, I'm afraid that I must see him. You see, it is a matter&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'It is very important that he shouldn't be disturbed. It interrupts his
  train of thought, and then he finds it difficult to&mdash;to get back. He
  writes very slowly&mdash;carefully, I mean&mdash;sometimes only a paragraph a
  day, so you see it is&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Mrs Weekley,' Grant said, bluntly, 'please give that card to your husband
  and say that I must see him, whatever he happens to be doing.'</p>

  <p>She stood with the card in her fingers, not even glancing at it, her mind
  obviously busy with the search for some excuse that would convince him. And
  he was all of a sudden aware that she was afraid to take that card to her
  husband. Afraid to interrupt him.</p>

  <p>To help her, he said that surely there would be no interruption where the
  children had been making so much noise. Her husband could hardly be
  concentrating very hard.</p>

  <p>'Oh, he doesn't work here,' she said. 'In the house, I mean. He has a
  little house of his own at the end of the garden.'</p>

  <p>Grant took back the card she was holding, and said grimly: 'Will you show
  me the way, Mrs Weekley?'</p>

  <p>Dumbly she led him through a dark kitchen where a toddler sat splay-legged
  on the floor enjoying his tears, and an infant in a perambulator sobbed in
  elemental fury. Beyond, in the bright sunshine of the garden, a boy of three
  or so was throwing stones from the pebble path against the wooden door of an
  outhouse, an unproductive occupation which nevertheless made a satisfying
  noise.</p>

  <p>'Stop that, Freddy,' she said automatically, and Freddy as automatically
  went on throwing the stones against the door.</p>

  <p>The back garden was a long thin strip of ground that ran along the side of
  the back lane, and at the very end of it, a long way from the house, was a
  wooden shed. Mrs Weekley pointed it out and said:</p>

  <p>'Perhaps you would just go and introduce yourself, would you? The children
  will be coming in from school for their midday meal and it isn't ready.'</p>

  <p>'Children?' Grant said.</p>

  <p>'Yes, the three eldest. So if you don't mind.'</p>

  <p>'No, of course I don't mind,' Grant said. Indeed, few things would please
  him like interrupting the great Silas Weekley this morning, but he refrained
  from saying so to Silas Weekley's wife.</p>

  <p>He knocked twice on the door of the wooden hut&mdash;a very trim wooden
  hut&mdash;without getting an answer, and so opened the door.</p>

  <p>Silas Weekley swung round from the table at which he was writing and said:
  'How <i>dare</i> you walk into my&mdash;' and then stopped as he saw Grant.
  He had quite obviously expected the intruder to be his wife.</p>

  <p>'Who are you?' he said rudely. 'If you are a journalist you will find that
  rudeness doesn't pay. This is private ground and you are trespassing.'</p>

  <p>'I am Detective-Inspector Grant from Scotland Yard,' Grant said and
  watched the news sink home.</p>

  <p>After a moment or two Silas got his lower jaw under control again and
  said: 'And what do you want, may I ask?' It was an attempt at truculence and
  it was not convincing.</p>

  <p>Grant said his regulation piece about investigating the disappearance of
  Leslie Searle and accounting for the movements of all those who knew Searle,
  and noted with the unoccupied half of his mind that the ink on the script
  that Weekley was working on was not only dry but dark. It was yesterday's
  ink. Weekley had done not a line this morning although it was now past
  noon.</p>

  <p>At the mention of Searle Weekley began a diatribe against moneyed
  dilettantes which&mdash;in view of Weekley's income and the sum total of his
  morning's work&mdash;Grant thought inappropriate. He cut him short and asked
  what he had been doing on Wednesday night.</p>

  <p>'And if I do not choose to tell you?'</p>

  <p>'I record your refusal and go away.'</p>

  <p>Weekley did not like the sound of this, so he muttered something about
  being badgered by the police.</p>

  <p>'All that I am doing,' Grant pointed out, 'is asking for your co-operation
  as a citizen. As I have pointed out, it is within your right to refuse
  co-operation.'</p>

  <p>Silas said sulkily that he had been writing on Wednesday night from
  supper-time onwards.</p>

  <p>'Any witnesses to that?' Grant asked, wasting no frills on Silas.</p>

  <p>'My wife, of course.'</p>

  <p>'She was here with you?'</p>

  <p>'No, of course not. She was in the house.'</p>

  <p>'And you were here alone?'</p>

  <p>'I was.'</p>

  <p>'Thank you and good-morning,' Grant said walking out of the hut and
  shutting the door crisply behind him.</p>

  <p>The morning smelt very fresh and sweet. The sour smell of vomited milk and
  rough-dried dish-cloths that had hung about the house was nothing to the
  smell of soured humanity that filled the place where Silas Weekley worked. As
  he walked back to the house he remembered that it was from this joyless and
  distorted mind that the current English 'masterpieces' came. The thought did
  nothing to reassure him. He avoided the joyless house, where the agitated
  clattering of pans (an appropriate orchestration, he couldn't help thinking)
  conveyed the preoccupation of its mistress, and walked round the side of it
  to the front gate, accompanied by Freddy.</p>

  <p>'Hullo, Freddy,' he said, sorry for the bored brat.</p>

  <p>'Hullo,' Freddy said without enthusiasm.</p>

  <p>'Isn't there a more exciting game than flinging stones at a door?'</p>

  <p>'No,' said Freddy.</p>

  <p>'Couldn't you find one if you looked about you?'</p>

  <p>'No,' said Freddy, with cold finality.</p>

  <p>Grant stood for a moment contemplating him.</p>

  <p>'There will never be any doubt about <i>your</i> paternity, Frederick,' he
  said, and walked away up the lane to the spot where he had left his car.</p>

  <p>It was down this lane that Leslie Searle had walked on Wednesday night,
  calling farewells to the group in the village street. He had walked past the
  Weekley cottage to where a stile led into the first of the fields that lay
  between the village and the river bend.</p>

  <p>At least that is what one took for granted that he did.</p>

  <p>He could have walked along the back lane and come to the village street
  again. But there would have been little point, surely, in that. He was never
  seen again in the village. He had walked into the darkness of the lane and
  disappeared.</p>

  <p>A little crazy, Tullis had said of Silas Weekley. But Silas Weekley didn't
  strike Grant as being crazy. A sadist, perhaps. A megalomaniac almost
  certainly. A man sick of a twisted vanity. But actually crazy no.</p>

  <p>Or would an alienist think differently?</p>

  <p>One of the most famous alienists in the country had once said to him that
  to write a book was to give oneself away. (Someone else had said the same
  thing more wittily and more succinctly, but he could not think at the moment
  who it was.) There was unconscious betrayal in every line, said the alienist.
  What, wondered Grant, would the alienist's verdict be after reading one of
  Silas Weekley's malignant effusions? That it was the outpouring of a petty
  mind, a mere fermentation of vanity? Or that it was a confession of
  madness?</p>

  <p>He thought for a moment of going back to the Swan and ringing up Wickham
  police station from there, but the Swan would be busy just now and the
  telephone a far from confidential affair. He decided to go back to Wickham
  and have lunch there, so that he could see Inspector Rodgers at his leisure
  and pick up any messages that might be waiting for him from Headquarters.</p>

  <p>In Wickham he found the higher orders at the police station preparing to
  retire into the peace of the weekend, and the lower ranks preparing for the
  weekly liveliness of Saturday night. Rodgers had little to say&mdash;he was
  never a talkative man&mdash;and nothing to report. The disappearance of
  Searle was the talk of Wickham, he said, now that the morning papers had made
  it general news; but no one had come in to suggest that they had seen
  him.</p>

  <p>'Not even a "nut" to confess to the murder,' he said dryly.</p>

  <p>'Well, that is a nice change,' Grant said.</p>

  <p>'He'll be along, he'll be along,' Rodgers said resignedly, and invited
  Grant home to lunch.</p>

  <p>But Grant preferred to eat at the White Hart.</p>

  <p>He was sitting in the dining-room of the White Hart eating the
  unpretentious but ample lunch that they provided, when the radio music in the
  kitchen ceased, and presently, oddly urbane among the castanet racket, came
  the voice of the announcer.</p>

  <p>'Before the news, here is a police message. Would anyone who gave a lift
  to a young man on Wednesday night on the road between Wickham and Crome, in
  Orfordshire, or anywhere in that vicinity, please communicate with Scotland
  Yard&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Telephone Whitehall One Two One Two,' chanted the kitchen staff
  happily.</p>

  <p>And then there was a rush of high-pitched conversation as the staff fell
  to on this latest tit-bit of news.</p>

  <p>Grant ate the very good roly-poly without relish and went out again into
  the sunlight. The streets, which had been teeming with Saturday shoppers when
  he came in to lunch, were deserted, the shops shut. He drove out of town
  wishing once more that he was going fishing. How had he ever chosen a
  profession where he could not count on a Saturday afternoon holiday? Half the
  world was free to sit back and enjoy itself this sunny afternoon, but he had
  to spend it pottering about asking questions that led nowhere.</p>

  <p>He drove back to Salcott in a state of mental dyspepsia, being only
  slightly cheered by Dora Siggins. He picked up Dora in the long straight of
  dull hedged lane that ran for a mile or more parallel to the river just
  outside the town. In the distance he had taken the plodding figure to be a
  youth carrying a kit of tools, but as he came nearer and slowed in answer to
  the raised thumb, he found that it was a girl in dungarees carrying a
  shopping bag. She grinned cheekily at him and said:</p>

  <p>'Saved my life, you have! I missed the bus because I was buying slippers
  for the dance tonight.'</p>

  <p>'Oh,' said Grant, looking at the parcel that had evidently refused to go
  into the overflowing bag. 'Glass ones?'</p>

  <p>'Not me,' she said, banging the door shut behind her and wriggling
  comfortably into the seat. 'None of that home-by-midnight stuff about me.
  'Sides, it wasn't a glass slipper at all, you know. It was fur. French, or
  something. We learned that at school.'</p>

  <p>Grant wondered privately if modern youth had been left any illusions at
  all. What would a world without fantasy be like? Or did the charming illusion
  that he was all-important fill for the modern child the place of earlier and
  more impersonal fantasies? The thought improved his temper considerably.</p>

  <p>At least they were quick of wit, these modern children. The cinema, he
  supposed. It was always the one-and-tuppennys&mdash;the regulars&mdash;who
  got the point while the front balcony were still groping. His passenger had
  got his reference to dance slippers without a second for consideration.</p>

  <p>She was a gay child, even after a week's work and missing the bus on a
  Saturday half-holiday, and poured out her history without any encouragement.
  Her name was Dora Siggins and she worked at a laundry, but she had a boy
  friend in a garage at Salcott, and they were going to get married as soon as
  the boy friend got a rise, which would be at Christmas, if all went as they
  expected.</p>

  <p>When, long afterwards, Grant sent Dora Siggins a box of chocolates as an
  anonymous tribute to the help she had been to him, he hoped heartily that it
  would lead to no misunderstanding with the boy friend who was so sure of his
  rise at Christmas.</p>

  <p>'You a commercial?' she asked presently, having exhausted her personal
  story.</p>

  <p>'No,' said Grant. 'I'm a policeman.'</p>

  <p>'Go on!' she said, and then, struck by the possibility that he might be
  telling the truth, took a more careful look at the interior of the car.
  'Coo!' she said at length. 'Blamed if you aren't, at that!'</p>

  <p>'What convinced you?' Grant said curiously.</p>

  <p>'Spit and polish,' she said. 'Only the fire service and the police have
  the spare time to keep a car shiny this way. I thought the police were
  forbidden to give lifts?'</p>

  <p>'You're thinking of the Post Office, aren't you. Here is Salcott on the
  horizon. Where do you live?'</p>

  <p>'The cottage with the wild cherry tree. My, I can't tell you how glad I am
  I didn't have to walk those four miles. You got the car out on the fly?'</p>

  <p>'No,' Grant said, and asked why she should think that.</p>

  <p>'Oh, the plain clothes and all. Thought maybe you were out for the day on
  your little own. There's one thing you ought to have that the American police
  have.'</p>

  <p>'What is that?' Grant asked bringing the car to a halt opposite the
  cottage with the cherry tree.</p>

  <p>'Sirens to go yelling along the roads with.'</p>

  <p>'God forbid,' Grant said.</p>

  <p>'I've always wanted to go tearing along the streets behind a siren, seeing
  people scattering every way.'</p>

  <p>'Don't forget your shoes,' Grant said, unsympathetically, indicating the
  parcel she was leaving on the seat.</p>

  <p>'Oh, gee, no; thanks! Thanks a million for everything. I'll never say a
  word against the police as long as I live.'</p>

  <p>She ran up the cottage path, paused to wave to him, and disappeared.</p>

  <p>Grant moved on into the village to resume his questioning.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch13"
     id="ch13"></a>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

  <p class="first">WHEN GRANT walked into the Mill House at a quarter to seven
  he felt that he had riddled Salcott St Mary through a small-meshed sieve, and
  what he had left in the sieve was exactly nothing. He had had a very fine
  cross-section of life in England, and he was by that much the richer. But
  towards solving the problem that had been entrusted to him he had advanced
  not one foot.</p>

  <p>Marta greeted him with her best contralto coo and drew him in to peace and
  refreshment. The living-room of the Mill House stood over the water, and in
  the daytime its furnishings swam in the wavering light; a green sub-aqueous
  light. But this evening Marta had drawn the curtains over the last of the
  sunset, and shut out the river light; she had prepared a refuge of warmth and
  reassurance, and Grant, tired and perplexed, was grateful to her.</p>

  <p>'I am so glad that it is not Walter who has disappeared,' she said,
  wafting him to a chair with one of her favourite gestures and beginning to
  pour sherry.</p>

  <p>'Glad?' Grant said, remembering Marta's expressed opinion of Walter.</p>

  <p>'If it was Walter who had disappeared, I should be a suspect, instead of a
  sleeping partner.'</p>

  <p>Grant thought that Marta as sleeping partner must have much in common with
  sleeping dogs.</p>

  <p>'As it is I can sit at the side of the law and see the wheels go round.
  Are you being brilliant, my dear?'</p>

  <p>'I'm flummoxed,' Grant said brutally, but Marta took it in her stride.</p>

  <p>'You feel that way only because you are tired and hungry; and probably
  suffering from dyspepsia, anyhow, after having to eat at the White Hart for
  two days. I'm going to leave you with the sherry decanter and go down and get
  the wine. Cellar-cooled Moselle. The kitchen is under this room, and the
  cellar is under the kitchen, and the wine comes up as cold as running water.
  Oh dear, I promised myself I wasn't going to think of running water any more
  today. I drew the curtains to shut out the river; I'm not so stuck on the
  river as I used to be. Perhaps we'll both feel better after the Moselle. When
  I've brought the wine up from the cellar I'm going to cook you an omelet as
  only I can cook one, and then we'll settle down. So relax for a little and
  get back your appetite. If the sherry isn't dry enough for you there's some
  Tio Pepe in the cupboard; but me, I think it is over-rated stuff.'</p>

  <p>She went away, and Grant blessed her that she had not plagued him with the
  questions that must have been crowding her mind. She was a woman who not only
  appreciated good food and good drink but was possessed of that innate good
  sense that is half-way to kindness. He had never seen her to better advantage
  than in this unexpected country home of hers.</p>

  <p>He lay back in the lamplight, his feet to the whickering logs, and
  relaxed. It was warm and very quiet. There was no river song: the Rushmere
  was a silent stream. No sound at all except the small noises of the fire. On
  the couch opposite him lay a newspaper, and behind it stood a book-case, but
  he was too tired to fetch either paper or book. At his elbow was a shelf of
  reference books. Idly he read the titles till he came to the London telephone
  book. The sight of those familiar volumes sent his mind flying down a new
  channel. They had said this evening, when he talked to the Yard, that so far
  Searle's cousin had not bothered to get in touch with them. They were not
  surprised by that, of course; the news had broken only that morning, and the
  artist cousin might live anywhere from the Scilly Isles to a farm in
  Cumberland; she might never read newspapers anyway; she might, if it came to
  that, be entirely indifferent to any fate that might overtake her cousin.
  After all, Searle had said quite frankly that they did not care for each
  other.</p>

  <p>But Grant still wanted to talk to someone who knew Searle's background; or
  at least a little of that background. Now, relaxed and at leisure for the
  first time in two days, he put out his hand for the S volume, and, on the
  chance that she lived in London and that she and Searle were the children of
  two brothers, turned up the Searles. There was a Miss Searle who lived in
  Holly Pavement, he noticed. Holly Pavement was in Hampstead and was a
  well-known artist's colony. On an impulse he picked up the telephone and
  asked for the London number.</p>

  <p>'One hour's delay. Call you back,' said the triumphant voice at the other
  end.</p>

  <p>'Priority,' Grant said. And gave his credentials.</p>

  <p>'Oh,' said the voice, disappointed but game. 'Oh, well, I'll see what I
  can do.'</p>

  <p>'On the contrary,' Grant said, '<i>I'll</i> see what you can do,' and hung
  up.</p>

  <p>He put the telephone book back in its place, and pulled out <i>Who's Who
  in the Theatre</i> to amuse himself with while he waited. Some of it made him
  feel very old. Actors and actresses he had never heard of already had long
  lists of successes to their credit. The ones he knew had pages of achievement
  stretching back into the already-quaint past. He began to look up the people
  he knew, as one does in the index of an autobiography. Toby Tullis, son of
  Sydney Tullis and his wife Martha (Speke). It was surprising to think that a
  national institution like Toby Tullis had ever been subjected to the
  processes of conception and brought into this world by the normal method. He
  observed that Toby's early days as an actor were decently shrouded under:
  'Was at one time an actor.' His one-time colleagues, Grant knew, would deny
  with heat that he had ever been even approximately an actor. On the other
  hand, Grant thought, remembering this morning, his whole life was an 'act'.
  He had created a part for himself and had played it ever since.</p>

  <p>It was surprising, too, to find that Marguerite Merriam (daughter of
  Geoffrey Merriam and his wife Brenda (Mattson)) had been considerably older
  than her adolescent fragility had led one to believe. Perhaps if she had
  lived that adolescent quality would have worn thin, and her power to break
  the public heart would have declined. That was, no doubt, what Marta had
  meant when she said that if she had lived another ten years her obituaries
  would have been back-page stuff.</p>

  <p>Marta (daughter of Gervase Wing-Strutt, M.R.C.S., L.R.C.P. and his wife
  Anne (Hallard)) was, of course, entirely orthodox. She had been educated at
  the best schools and had sneaked her way on to the stage by the back-door of
  elocution like so many of her well-bred predecessors. Grant hoped that when
  in the next edition&mdash;or at most the next after&mdash;the letters D.B.E.
  followed Marta's name, it would comfort Gervase Wing-Strutt and his wife Anne
  for being fooled by their daughter a quarter of a century ago.</p>

  <p>He had not even taken the cream off the possible entertainment provided by
  this enchanting volume when the telephone rang.</p>

  <p>'Your call to London is through. Will you go ahead, please,' the voice
  said.</p>

  <p>'Hullo,' Grant said. 'Could I speak to Miss Searle?'</p>

  <p>'Miss Searle speaking,' said a pleasant voice, a shade on the efficient
  side.</p>

  <p>'Miss Searle, I'm truly sorry to bother you, but have you, by any chance,
  a cousin called Leslie Searle?'</p>

  <p>'I have, and if he has borrowed money from you you are wasting your time
  if you think that I will pay it back.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, no. It is nothing like that. Your cousin has disappeared while
  staying with friends in the country and we hoped that you might help us to
  trace him. My name is Grant. I'm a Detective-Inspector at Scotland Yard.'</p>

  <p>'Oh,' said the voice, considering but not apparently dismayed. 'Well, I
  don't see what help I can be to you. Leslie and I never had much to do with
  each other. He wasn't my cup of tea, and I certainly am not his.'</p>

  <p>'It would be some help if I could come and talk to you about him. Would
  you, perhaps, be at home tomorrow afternoon if I called?'</p>

  <p>'Well, tomorrow afternoon I was going to a concert at the Albert
  Hall.'</p>

  <p>'Oh. Then I might manage it just before lunch if that is any better for
  you.'</p>

  <p>'You are very accommodating for a policeman,' she remarked.</p>

  <p>'Criminals don't find us that way,' he said.</p>

  <p>'I thought providing accommodation for criminals was the end and object of
  Scotland Yard. It's all right, Inspector. I won't go to the concert. It is
  not a very good one anyhow.'</p>

  <p>'You'll be in if I call?'</p>

  <p>'Yes, I'll be here.'</p>

  <p>'That is very kind of you.'</p>

  <p>'That over-rated photographer didn't take the family jewels with him when
  he left, did he?'</p>

  <p>'No. Oh, no. He has just disappeared.'</p>

  <p>She gave a small snort. It was apparent that whatever Miss Searle had to
  tell him about her cousin there would be no suppression of facts or false
  modesty in her story.</p>

  <p>As Grant hung up, Marta came back preceded by a small boy carrying wood
  for the fire. The boy put the logs neatly in the hearth, and then eyed Grant
  with respectful awe.</p>

  <p>'Tommy has something he wants to ask you,' Marta said. 'He knows that you
  are a detective.'</p>

  <p>'What is it, Tommy?'</p>

  <p>'Will you show me your revolver, sir?'</p>

  <p>'I would if I had it with me. But it's in a drawer in Scotland Yard, I'm
  afraid.'</p>

  <p>Tommy looked cut to the heart. 'I thought you always carried one. The
  American cops do. You <i>can</i> shoot, can't you, sir?'</p>

  <p>'Oh, yes,' Grant said relieving the awful fear that was clearly dawning.
  'I'll tell you what, next time you come to London, you can come to Scotland
  Yard and I'll show you the revolver.'</p>

  <p>'I can come to the <i>Yard</i>? Oh, thank you. Thank you very much, sir.
  That would be just bonza.'</p>

  <p>He went, with a polite goodnight, in an aura of radiance a foot thick.</p>

  <p>'And parents think they can cure boys of liking lethal weapons by not
  giving them toy soldiers,' Marta said, as she set the omelet out on the
  table. 'Come and eat.'</p>

  <p>'I owe you for a trunk call to London.'</p>

  <p>'I thought that you were going to relax.'</p>

  <p>'I was but I got an idea, and it has taken me the first step forward in
  this case since I took it over.'</p>

  <p>'Good!' she said. 'Now you can feel happy and let your digestive juices do
  their work.'</p>

  <p>A small round table had been set near the fire, with candles for pleasure
  and decoration, and they ate together in a friendly quiet. Mrs Thrupp came up
  with the chicken, and was introduced, and was volubly grateful for Grant's
  invitation to Tommy. After that peace was uninterrupted. Over coffee the talk
  went to Silas Weekley and the oddness of the ménage in the lane.</p>

  <p>'Silas prides himself on living "working-class", whatever that may mean.
  None of his children is going to begin any better off than he did. He's a
  frightful bore about his elementary school origins. You would think he was
  the first elementary schoolboy to go to Oxford since the place was founded.
  He's the classic case of inverted snobbery.'</p>

  <p>'But what does he do with all the money he makes?'</p>

  <p>'God knows. Buries it under the floor of that little hut where he works,
  perhaps. No one is ever allowed to go inside that hut.'</p>

  <p>'I interviewed him in that hut this morning.'</p>

  <p>'Alan! How clever of you! What was inside?'</p>

  <p>'One well-known writer, doing very little work.'</p>

  <p>'I expect he sweats blood over his writing. He has no imagination, you
  know. I mean, he has no idea how another person's mind works. So his
  situations, and his characters' reaction to the situations, are all clichés.
  He sells because of his "earthiness", his "elemental strength", God save us
  all. Let us push back the table and get nearer the fire.'</p>

  <p>She opened a cupboard, and said in an excellent imitation of the boys who
  used to sell things off trays on railway platforms: 'Drambuie, Benedictine,
  Strega, Grand Marnier, Bols, Chartreuse, Slivovitz, Armagnac, Cognac, Rakia,
  Kümmel, Various French Sirops of Unspeakable Sweetness, and Mrs Thrupp's
  Ginger Cordial!'</p>

  <p>'Is it your intention to seduce official secrets from the Criminal
  Investigation Department?'</p>

  <p>'No, darling; I am offering homage to your palate. You are one of the few
  men I know who possesses such a thing.'</p>

  <p>She put the Chartreuse and the liqueur glasses on a tray and arranged her
  long legs in comfort on the couch.</p>

  <p>'Now tell me,' she said.</p>

  <p>'But I have nothing to tell,' he protested.</p>

  <p>'I don't mean that kind of tell. I mean talk at me. Pretend I'm your
  wife&mdash;which God forbid&mdash;and just make an audience of me. For
  instance, you don't really think that that poor stick Walter Whitmore ever
  got up enough red blood to tap the Searle boy on the head, do you?'</p>

  <p>'No, I don't think so. Sergeant Williams calls Walter a push-ee, and I
  think I agree with him.'</p>

  <p>'Calls him a what?'</p>

  <p>Grant explained, and Marta said: 'And how right your Sergeant Williams is!
  Walter's taking-off is long overdue.'</p>

  <p>'He may do his own taking-off if this affair isn't cleared up.'</p>

  <p>'Yes, I suppose he is having a bad time, poor silly creature. The gossip
  in a small country place is deadly. Have you had any answer to your police
  appeal, by the way? I heard it at one o'clock.'</p>

  <p>'No, not up to six-forty-five, when I last talked to the Yard. I gave them
  this number for the next two hours. I hope you don't mind.'</p>

  <p>'Why do you think he might have been given a lift?'</p>

  <p>'Because if he isn't in the river he must have walked away from it.'</p>

  <p>'Of his own accord? But that would be a very odd thing to do.'</p>

  <p>'He may be suffering from amnesia. There are five possibilities
  altogether.'</p>

  <p>'Five!'</p>

  <p>'On Wednesday night Searle walked away down that lane, healthy and sober;
  and he has not been near since. The possibilities are: one, that he fell into
  the water accidentally and was drowned; two, that he was murdered and thrown
  in the river; three, that he walked away for reasons of his own; four, that
  he wandered away because he forgot who he was and where he was going; five,
  that he was kidnapped.'</p>

  <p>'Kidnapped!'</p>

  <p>'We don't know anything about his American life; we have to make
  allowances for that. He may even have come to this country to get away from
  the States for a little. I shan't know about that until we have a report
  about him from the Coast&mdash;if then! Tell me, what did <i>you</i> think of
  Searle?'</p>

  <p>'In what way?'</p>

  <p>'Well, would you say he was a practical joker, for instance?'</p>

  <p>'Anything but.'</p>

  <p>'Yes. Liz Garrowby was against that too. She said he wouldn't think a
  practical joke funny. How impressed do you think he was with Liz Garrowby?
  You were there to dinner.'</p>

  <p>'Impressed enough to make Walter sick with jealousy.'</p>

  <p>'Really?'</p>

  <p>'They were nice together, Leslie and Liz. They were a natural pair,
  somehow. Something that Walter and Liz will never be. I don't think Walter
  knows anything about Liz; and I had an idea that Leslie Searle knew quite a
  lot.'</p>

  <p>'Did you like him when you met him? You took him back with you that night,
  after dinner.'</p>

  <p>'Yes. Yes to both. I liked him with reservations.'</p>

  <p>'What kind of reservations?'</p>

  <p>'It's difficult to describe. I could hardly take my eyes off him, and yet
  he never struck me as being&mdash;real. That sounds mad, doesn't it.'</p>

  <p>'You mean there was something phony about him?'</p>

  <p>'Not in the accepted sense. He was obviously what he said he was. In any
  case, our Miss Easton-Dixon bears witness to that, as you probably know.'</p>

  <p>'Yes, I was talking to Miss Easton-Dixon this afternoon about him. Her
  photograph of him may prove very useful. What did you and Searle talk about,
  the night you brought him back with you?'</p>

  <p>'Oh, cabbages and kings. People he had photographed. People we had both
  met. People he wanted to meet. We spent a long time in mutual adoring of
  Danny Minsky, and another long time in furious disagreement about Marguerite
  Merriam. Like everyone else he thought Marguerite the world's genius, and
  wouldn't hear a word against her. I got so annoyed with him that I told him a
  few home-truths about Marguerite. I was ashamed of myself afterwards. It's a
  mean thing to break children's toys.'</p>

  <p>'I expect it did him good. He was too old to have the facts of life kept
  from him.'</p>

  <p>'I hear you've been collecting alibis today.'</p>

  <p>'How did you hear?'</p>

  <p>'The way I hear everything. From Mrs Thrupp. Who are the unlucky people
  who have none?'</p>

  <p>'Practically the whole village, including Miss Easton-Dixon.'</p>

  <p>'Our Dixie is "out". Who else?'</p>

  <p>'Miss Lavinia Fitch.'</p>

  <p>'<i>Dear</i> Lavinia!' Marta said, laughing outright at the thought of
  Miss Fitch on murder bent.</p>

  <p>'Liz Garrowby?'</p>

  <p>'Poor Liz must be having a thin time over this. I think she was half in
  love with the boy.'</p>

  <p>'Mrs Garrowby?'</p>

  <p>Marta paused to consider this. 'Do you know, I wouldn't put it past the
  woman. She would do it and not turn a hair because she would persuade herself
  that it was the right thing to do. She'd even go to church afterwards and ask
  God's blessing on it.'</p>

  <p>'Toby Tullis?'</p>

  <p>'N-o, I hardly think so. Toby would find some other way of getting even.
  Something much less risky for Toby and just as satisfying. Toby is fertile in
  inventing small revenges. I don't think he would need to murder anyone.'</p>

  <p>'Silas Weekley?'</p>

  <p>'I wonder. I wonder. Yes, I think Silas would commit murder. Especially if
  the book he happened to be writing at the moment was not going well. The
  books are Silas's outlet for his hatred, you see. If that was dammed up he
  might kill someone. Someone who seemed to him rich and well-favoured and
  undeservedly fortunate.'</p>

  <p>'You think Weekley mad?'</p>

  <p>'Oh, yes. Not certifiable perhaps, but definitely unbalanced. Is there any
  truth, by the way, in the rumour of a quarrel between Walter and the Searle
  boy?'</p>

  <p>'Whitmore denies that it was a quarrel. He says it was "just a spat".'</p>

  <p>'So there <i>was</i> bad feeling between them?'</p>

  <p>'I don't know if we have even evidence for that. A temporary annoyance is
  hardly the same thing as bad feeling. Men can disagree quite fundamentally in
  a pub of an evening without any fundamental bad feeling on either side.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, you are maddening. Of course there was bad feeling, and of course we
  know why. It was about Liz.'</p>

  <p>'Having no connections in the Fourth Dimension, I couldn't say,' Grant
  said, mocking her jumped-to conclusion. 'Whitmore said Searle was
  "provocative". What, can you tell me from your point of vantage, would he be
  provocative about?'</p>

  <p>'He probably told Walter how little he appreciated Liz, and that if Walter
  didn't mend his ways he would take Liz from him, and if Walter thought he
  wasn't up to it he was wrong and he would get Liz to pack and walk away with
  him by a week next Tuesday, and there was five pounds that said he was right.
  And Walter said, very huffy and stiff, that in this country we did not bet on
  the possible bestowal of women's favours, at least gentlemen didn't, and to
  put five pounds on Liz was simply insulting (Walter has no sense of the
  ridiculous at all, you know; that is how he perpetrates those broadcasts and
  endears himself to old ladies who avoid the country like the plague and
  wouldn't know a wren if they saw one); and Leslie probably said that if he
  thought a fiver too little he was willing to make it ten, since if Liz had
  been engaged to a prig like Walter for nearly twelve months she was just ripe
  for a change and the ten would be just found money, and so then Walter got up
  and went out and banged the door behind him.'</p>

  <p>'How did you know about the banged door?'</p>

  <p>'My dear soul, everyone in Orfordshire knows about the banged door by this
  time. That is why Walter is suspect Number One. Is that all your list of
  Lacking Alibis, by the way?'</p>

  <p>'No, there is Serge Ratoff.'</p>

  <p>'Oh. What was Serge doing?'</p>

  <p>'Dancing on the greensward by the river in the dark.'</p>

  <p>'That has the ring of truth, anyhow.'</p>

  <p>'Why? Have you seen him?'</p>

  <p>'No. But it is just the kind of thing Serge would do. He is still full of
  the idea of a come-back, you know. Before the scene about Leslie Searle, he
  was planning the come-back as a way of pleasing Toby; now he is planning it
  just to "show" Toby.'</p>

  <p>'Where do you get all this inside knowledge?'</p>

  <p>'I haven't played parts for twenty-five years on just the producer's
  directions,' she said.</p>

  <p>He looked across at her, elegant and handsome in the firelight, and
  thought of all the different parts that he had seen her play: courtesans and
  frustrated hags, careerists and domestic doormats. It was true that actors
  had a perception, an understanding of human motive, that normal people
  lacked. It had nothing to do with intelligence, and very little to do with
  education. In general knowledge Marta was as deficient as a not very bright
  child of eleven; her attention automatically slid off anything that was alien
  to her own immediate interests and the result was an almost infantine
  ignorance. He had seen the same thing in hospital nurses, and sometimes in
  overworked G.P.s. But put a script in her hands, and from a secret and native
  store of knowledge she drew the wherewithal to build her characterisation of
  the author's creation.</p>

  <p>'Supposing that this really is a case of homicide,' he said. 'Judging
  entirely on looks and recent form, so to speak, who would you put your money
  on?'</p>

  <p>She considered this for a little, turning her empty liqueur glass in the
  firelight.</p>

  <p>'Emma Garrowby, I think,' she said at last. 'Could Emma have done it?
  Physically speaking, I mean.'</p>

  <p>'Yes. She left Miss Easton-Dixon where their ways parted on Wednesday
  night, and after that time was her own. No one knows what time she came back
  to Trimmings. The others had gone to bed; or rather, to their rooms. It is
  Mrs Garrowby who locks up the front of the house, anyhow.'</p>

  <p>'Yes. Ample time. It isn't so very far from Trimmings to that bend in the
  river. I do wonder what Emma's shoes were like on Thursday morning. Or did
  she clean them herself.'</p>

  <p>'Believe me, if there was any unwonted mud on the shoes she cleaned them
  herself. Mrs Garrowby looks to me a very methodical person. Why do you pick
  on Emma Garrowby?'</p>

  <p>'Well, I take it you commit murder because you are one-idead. Or have
  become one-idead. As long as you have a variety of interests you can't care
  about any one of them to the point of murder. It is when you have all your
  eggs in the same basket, or only one egg left in the basket, that you lose
  your sense of proportion. Do I make myself clear, Inspector Grant?'</p>

  <p>'Perfectly.'</p>

  <p>'Good. Have some more Chartreuse. Well, Emma seems to me the most
  concentrated of the possible suspects. No one could call Serge concentrated,
  except on the thing of the moment. Serge spends his life having flaring rows,
  and has never shown signs of killing anyone. The farthest he ever gets is to
  fling whatever happens to come handiest.'</p>

  <p>'Lacking a whip,' Grant said; and told her of his interview with Serge.
  'And Weekley?'</p>

  <p>'On form, to use your own excellent metaphor, Silas is only a pound or two
  behind Emma; but quite definitely behind. Silas has his own success, his
  family, the books he is going to write in the future (even if they are just
  the same old ones over again in different words); Silas's interest isn't
  <i>channelled</i> the way Emma's is. Short of having a brain-storm, some
  unreasoning hatred, Silas would have no urge to get rid of Leslie. Nor would
  Toby. Toby's life simply corruscates with variety. Toby would never think of
  killing anyone. As I told you, he has too many other ways of making the score
  even. But Emma. Emma has nothing but Liz.'</p>

  <p>She thought it over for a moment, and Grant let the silence lie
  uninterrupted.</p>

  <p>'You should have seen Emma when Walter and Liz announced their
  engagement,' she said at last. 'She&mdash;she positively <i>glittered</i>.
  She was a walking Christmas tree. It was what she had always wanted, and
  against all probability it had happened. Walter, who met all the clever and
  beautiful women of this generation, had fallen in love with Liz and they were
  going to be married. Walter would get Trimmings one day, and Lavinia's
  fortune, so even if his vogue went they would have as much of this world's
  goods as anyone could possibly want or use. It was a fairy-tale come true.
  She was floating just an inch or two off the ground. Then Leslie Searle
  came.' Marta, the actress, let the silence come back. And being also an
  artist she left it unbroken.</p>

  <p>The logs slipped and spluttered, sending up fresh jets of flame, and Grant
  lay still in his chair and thought about Emma Garrowby.</p>

  <p>And about the two things that Marta did not know.</p>

  <p>It was odd that Marta's chosen suspect should occupy the same area as the
  two unaccountables in this case: the glove in Searle's drawer, and the space
  in the photographic box.</p>

  <p>Emma. Emma Garrowby. The woman who had brought up a younger sister and
  when that sister moved out from under her wing married a widower with a young
  child. She channelled her interest as naturally as Toby Tullis spread his
  wide, didn't she? She had been radiant&mdash;'a walking Christmas
  tree'&mdash;over the engagement; and in the period since that engagement (it
  was five months, he happened to know, not twelve) her initial delight must
  have spread and amplified to something much more formidable; an acceptance; a
  sense of achievement, of security. The engagement had stood whatever small
  shocks it had encountered in these five months, and Emma must have got used
  to thinking of it as safe and immutable.</p>

  <p>And then, as Marta said, Leslie Searle.</p>

  <p>Searle with his charm and his fly-by-night life. Searle with his air of
  being not quite of this world. No one could view this modern shower of gold
  with more instant distrust than Emma Garrowby.</p>

  <p>'What would fit into a space 10½ inches, by 3½ by 4?' he asked.</p>

  <p>'A hair brush,' said Marta.</p>

  <p>There was a game played by psychologists, Grant remembered, where the
  victim said the first thing that occurred to him on hearing a given word. It
  must work out pretty well, all things considered. He had put this same
  proposition to Bill Maddox, and Maddox, as unhesitatingly as Marta had said
  'A hairbrush', had said 'A spanner'. He remembered that Williams had
  proffered a bar of soap.</p>

  <p>'Anything else?'</p>

  <p>'A set of dominoes. A box of envelopes? No, a shade on the small side.
  Packs of cards? Enough cards to set up on a desert island! Table cutlery. The
  family spoons. Someone been secreting the family silver?'</p>

  <p>'No. It is just something I wondered about.'</p>

  <p>'If it's the Trimmings silver, just let it go, my dear. It wouldn't fetch
  thirty shillings the lot at an auction sale.' Her eye went in unconscious
  satisfaction to the Georgian simplicity of her own implements on the table
  behind her. 'Tell me, Alan, it wouldn't be indiscreet or unprofessional,
  would it, to tell me who is your own favourite for the part?'</p>

  <p>'The part?'</p>

  <p>'The killer.'</p>

  <p>'It would be both unprofessional and indiscreet. But I don't think there
  is any wild indiscretion in telling you that I don't think there is one.'</p>

  <p>'What! You really think Leslie Searle is still alive? Why?'</p>

  <p>Why indeed, he asked himself. What was there in the set-up that gave him
  this feeling of being at a performance? Of being pushed into the stalls so
  that an orchestra pit intervened between him and reality. The Assistant
  Commissioner had once said to him in an unwonted moment of expansiveness that
  he had the most priceless of all attributes for his job: flair. 'But don't
  let it ride you, Grant,' he had said. 'Keep your eye on the evidence.' Was
  this a sample of letting his flair ride him? The chances were ninety-nine to
  one that Searle had fallen into the river. All the evidence pointed that way.
  If it hadn't been for the complication of the quarrel with Whitmore, he,
  Grant, would not have entered into the affair at all; it would have been a
  simple case of 'missing believed drowned'.</p>

  <p>And yet. And yet. Now you see it, now you don't. That old conjurer's
  phrase. It haunted him.</p>

  <p>Half consciously he said it aloud.</p>

  <p>Marta stared and said: 'A conjuring trick? By whom? For what?'</p>

  <p>'I don't know. I just have a strong feeling that I'm being taken for a
  ride!'</p>

  <p>'You think that Leslie just walked away somehow?'</p>

  <p>'Or someone planned it to look like that. Or something. I have a strong
  feeling of watching something being sawn in half.'</p>

  <p>'You're overworking,' Marta said. 'Where do you think Leslie could have
  disappeared to? Unless he just came back to the village and lay doggo
  somewhere.'</p>

  <p>Grant came wide awake and regarded her with admiration. 'Oddly enough,' he
  said, amused, 'I had never thought of that. Do you think Toby is hiding him
  to make things difficult for Walter?'</p>

  <p>'No, I know it doesn't make sense. But neither does your idea about his
  walking away. Where would he walk to in the middle of the night in nothing
  but flannels and a raincoat?'</p>

  <p>'I shall know more about that when I have seen his cousin tomorrow.'</p>

  <p>'He has a cousin? How surprising. It's like finding Mercury with an
  in-law. Who is he?'</p>

  <p>'It's a woman. A painter, I understand. A delightful creature who has
  given up an Albert Hall Sunday afternoon concert to be at home for me. I used
  your telephone to make an assignation with her.'</p>

  <p>'And you expect her to know why Leslie walked away in the middle of the
  night in nothing but flannels and a raincoat?'</p>

  <p>'I expect her to be able to suggest where Leslie might have been headed
  for.'</p>

  <p>'To borrow the callboy's immortal phrase: I hope it keeps fine for you,'
  Marta said.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch14"
     id="ch14"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

  <p class="first">GRANT drove back to Wickham through the spring night,
  cheered in body and soul.</p>

  <p>And Emma Garrowby sat beside him all the way.</p>

  <p>Flair might whisper soft seductions to him, but Emma was there in the
  middle of the picture, where Marta had set her, and she was much too solid to
  be conjured away. Emma made sense. Emma was example and precedent. The
  classic samples of ruthlessness were domestic. The Lizzie Bordons. Emma, if
  it came to that, was primordial. A female creature protecting its young. It
  required immense ingenuity to find a reason why Leslie Searle should have
  chosen to disappear. It needed no ingenuity at all to suggest why Emma
  Garrowby should have killed him.</p>

  <p>In fact, it was a sort of perversity to keep harking back to the idea that
  Searle might have ducked. He could just hear the A.C. if he ever came before
  him with a theory like that. Evidence, Grant, suggestive evidence. Common
  sense, Grant, common sense. Don't let your flair ride you, Grant, don't let
  your flair ride you. Disappear of his own accord? This happy young man who
  could pay his bills at the Westmorland, buy expensive clothes to wear and
  expensive sweets to give away, travel the world at other people's expense?
  This young man of such surprising good-looks that every head he encountered
  was turned either literally or metaphorically? This charming young man who
  liked plain little Liz so much that he kept a glove of hers? This
  professionally successful young man who was engaged in a deal that would
  bring him both money and kudos?</p>

  <p>Common sense, Grant. Evidence, Grant. Don't let your flair ride you.</p>

  <p>Consider Emma Garrowby, Grant. She had the opportunity. She had the
  motive. And, on form, she probably had the will. She knew where the camp was
  that night.</p>

  <p>But she didn't know that they had come in to Salcott for a drink.</p>

  <p>He wasn't drowned in Salcott.</p>

  <p>She couldn't have known that she would find him alone. It was sheer chance
  that they separated that night.</p>

  <p><i>Someone</i> found him alone. Why not Emma?</p>

  <p>How could it happen?</p>

  <p>Perhaps she arranged it.</p>

  <p>Emma! How?</p>

  <p>Has it struck you that Searle engineered that exit of Walter's?</p>

  <p>No. How?</p>

  <p>It was Searle who was provocative. He provoked Walter to the point where
  he couldn't stand it a minute longer, and had either to go or stay and have a
  row. Searle got rid of Walter that evening.</p>

  <p>Why should he?</p>

  <p>Because he had an appointment.</p>

  <p>An appointment! With whom?</p>

  <p>Liz Garrowby.</p>

  <p>That is absurd. There is no evidence whatever that the Garrowby girl had
  any serious interest in&mdash;</p>

  <p>Oh, it was not Liz who sent Searle the message to meet her.</p>

  <p>No? Who then?</p>

  <p>Emma.</p>

  <p>You mean that Searle went to meet someone he thought was Liz?</p>

  <p>Yes. He behaved like a lover, if you think about it.</p>

  <p>How?</p>

  <p>Do you remember how he took farewell of his acquaintances that night? The
  banter about going to their beds on so fine a spring night? The gaiety? The
  on-top-of-the-worldness?</p>

  <p>He had just had several beers.</p>

  <p>So had his companions. Some of them a great deal more than several. But
  were they singing metaphorical songs to the spring night? They were not. They
  were taking the shortest cut home to bed, even the youngest of them.</p>

  <p>Well, it's a theory.</p>

  <p>It is more than that. It is a theory in accordance with the evidence.</p>

  <p>Evidence, Grant, evidence.</p>

  <p>Don't let your flair ride you, Grant.</p>

  <p>All the way along the dark lanes between Salcott St Mary and Wickham, Emma
  Garrowby sat beside him. And when he went to bed he took her with him.</p>

  <p>Because he was tired, and had dined well, and had at last seen a path of
  some kind open in front of him, he slept well. And when his eyes opened in
  daylight on THE HOUR COMETH in purple wool cross-stitch, he regarded the text
  as a promise rather than a warning. He looked forward to going to town, if
  only as a mental bath after his plunge into Salcott St Mary. He could then
  come back and see it in proportion. You couldn't get the flavour of anything
  properly unless you cleaned your palate between times. He had wondered often
  how married men managed to combine their domestic lives with the absorbing
  demands of police work. It occurred to him now for the first time that
  married life must be the perfect palate-cleanser. There could be nothing like
  a spell of helping young Bobby with his algebra to bring you back with a
  fresh mind to the problem of the current crime.</p>

  <p>At least he would be able to get some clean shirts, he thought. He put his
  things into his bag, and turned to go down to breakfast. It was Sunday and
  still early, but they would manage to give him something. As he opened the
  door of his room the telephone rang.</p>

  <p>The White Hart's only concession to progress was to install bedside
  telephones. He crossed the room to the instrument and picked it up.</p>

  <p>'Inspector Grant?' said the voice of the landlord. 'Just a minute please;
  you're wanted on the phone.' There was a moment's silence, and then he said:
  'Go ahead, please; you're through.'</p>

  <p>'Hullo.'</p>

  <p>'Alan?' said Marta's voice. 'Is that you, Alan?'</p>

  <p>'Yes, it's me. You're awake early aren't you?'</p>

  <p>'Listen, Alan. Something has happened. You must come out straight
  away.'</p>

  <p>'Out? To Salcott, you mean?'</p>

  <p>'To the Mill House. Something has happened. It's very important or I
  wouldn't have called you so early.'</p>

  <p>'But what has happened? Can't you&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'You're on a hotel telephone, aren't you.'</p>

  <p>'Yes.'</p>

  <p>'I can't very well tell you, Alan. Something has turned up. Something that
  alters everything. Or rather, everything you&mdash;you believed in, so to
  speak.'</p>

  <p>'Yes. All right. I'll come at once.'</p>

  <p>'Have you had breakfast?'</p>

  <p>'Not yet.'</p>

  <p>'I'll have some ready for you.'</p>

  <p>What a woman, he thought as he put back the receiver. He had always
  thought that the first requisite in a wife was intelligence, and now he was
  sure of it. There was no room in his life for Marta, and none in her life for
  him; but it was a pity, all the same. A woman who could announce a surprising
  development in a homicide case without babbling on the telephone was a prize,
  but one who could in the same breath ask if he had had breakfast and arrange
  to supply him with the one he had not had was above rubies.</p>

  <p>He went to collect his car, full of speculation. What could Marta possibly
  have unearthed? Something that Searle had left the night he was there? Some
  piece of gossip that the milkman had brought?</p>

  <p>One thing was certain: it was not a body. If it had been a body Marta,
  being Marta, would have conveyed as much, so that he could bring out with him
  all the necessary paraphernalia and personnel to deal with such a
  discovery.</p>

  <p>It was a day of high wind and rainbows. The halcyon time of windless
  sunlight that comes each year to the English spring when the first dust lies
  on the roads was over. Spring was all of a sudden wild and robust. Glittering
  showers slanted across the landscape. Great clouds soared up over the horizon
  and swept in shrieking squalls across the sky. The trees cowered, and plumed
  themselves, and cowered again.</p>

  <p>The countryside was deserted. Not because of the weather but because it
  was Sunday. Some of the cottages, he observed, still had their blinds drawn.
  People who got up at the crack of dawn during the week, and had no animals to
  get them up on Sunday, must be glad to sleep late. He had grumbled often when
  his police duties had broken into his private life (a luxury grumble, since
  he could have retired years ago when his aunt left him her money), but to
  spend one's life in bondage to the predilections of animals must be a sad
  waste of a free man's time.</p>

  <p>As he brought the car up to the landward side of the Mill House, where the
  door was, Marta came out to greet him. Marta never 'dressed the part' in the
  country as so many of her colleagues did. She looked on the country rather as
  the country people themselves did, as a place to be lived in; not something
  that one put on specially bright and casual clothes for. If her hands were
  cold she wore gloves. She did not feel that she must look like a gypsy just
  because she happened to live in the Mill House at Salcott St Mary. She was
  therefore looking as chic and sophisticated this morning as though she were
  receiving him on the steps of Stanworth. But he thought she had a shocked
  look. Indeed she looked as though she had quite lately been very sick.</p>

  <p>'Alan! You can't imagine how glad I was to hear your voice on the
  telephone. I was afraid that you might have gone to town, early as it
  was.'</p>

  <p>'What is this that has turned up so unexpectedly?' he asked making for the
  door. But she led him round and down to the kitchen door at the side of the
  house.</p>

  <p>'It was your follower, Tommy Thrupp, that found it. Tommy is mad on
  fishing. And he quite often goes out before breakfast to fish, because
  apparently that is a good time.' The 'apparently' was typically Marta, he
  thought. Marta had lived by the river for years and still had to take someone
  else's word about the proper time for fishing. 'On Sundays he usually takes
  something in his pocket and doesn't come back&mdash;something to eat, I
  mean&mdash;but this morning he came back inside an hour because he
  had&mdash;because he had caught something very odd.'</p>

  <p>She opened the bright green door and led him into the kitchen. In the
  kitchen were Tommy Thrupp and his mother. Mrs Thrupp was huddled over the
  stove as if she also was feeling not too well, but Tommy came to meet them in
  sparkling form. There was nothing sickly about Tommy. Tommy was transfigured.
  He was translated. He was six feet high and crowned with lightning.</p>

  <p>'Look, sir! Look what I fished up!' he said, before Marta could say
  anything, and drew Grant to the kitchen table. On the table, carefully placed
  on several thicknesses of newspaper so as to preserve the scrubbed perfection
  of the wood, was a man's shoe.</p>

  <p>'I'll never be able to bake on that table again,' moaned Mrs Thrupp, not
  looking round.</p>

  <p>Grant glanced at the shoe and remembered the police description of the
  missing man's clothes.</p>

  <p>'It's Searle's, I take it,' he said.</p>

  <p>'Yes,' Marta said.</p>

  <p>It was a brown shoe, and instead of being laced it was tied with a buckle
  and strap across the instep. It was water-logged and very muddy.</p>

  <p>'Where did you fish it up, Tommy?'</p>

  <p>'Bout a hundred yards down-stream from the big bend.'</p>

  <p>'I suppose you didn't think of marking the place?'</p>

  <p>'A course I marked it!' Tommy said, hurt.</p>

  <p>'Good for you. Presently you'll have to show me the place. Meanwhile wait
  here, will you. Don't go out and talk about this.'</p>

  <p>'No, sir, I won't. No one's in on this but me and the police.'</p>

  <p>A little brightened by this version of the situation, Grant went upstairs
  to the telephone in the living-room and called Inspector Rodgers. After some
  delay, since the station had to connect him to the Rodgers's home, he was put
  through to him, and broke the news that the river would have to be dragged
  again and why.</p>

  <p>'Oh, lord!' groaned Rodgers. 'Did the Thrupp boy say where he fished it
  up?'</p>

  <p>'About a hundred yards down from the big bend, if that conveys anything to
  you.'</p>

  <p>'Yes. That's about two hundred yards down-stream from where they had their
  bivouac. We did that stretch with a small-tooth comb. You don't think that
  perhaps&mdash;? Does the shoe look as if it had been in the water since
  Wednesday night?'</p>

  <p>'It does indeed.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, well. I'll make arrangements. It would happen on a Sunday, wouldn't
  it?'</p>

  <p>'Do it as quietly as you can, will you? We don't want more spectators than
  we can help.'</p>

  <p>As he hung up Marta came in with a tray and began to put his breakfast on
  the table.</p>

  <p>'Mrs Thrupp is still what she calls "heaving", so I judged it better to do
  your breakfast myself. How do you like your eggs? Sunny side up?'</p>

  <p>'If you really want to know, I like them broken when they are half cooked
  and rummelled up with a fork.'</p>

  <p>'<i>Panaché!</i>' Marta said, delighted. 'That is one I have not met
  before. We are growing intimate, aren't we! I am probably the only woman
  alive except your housekeeper who knows that you like your breakfast eggs
  streaky. Or&mdash;am I?'</p>

  <p>'Well, there's a woman in a village near Amiens that I once confessed it
  to. But I doubt if she would remember.'</p>

  <p>'She is probably making a fortune out of the idea. Eggs <i>à
  l'Anglaise</i> probably has a totally new meaning in France nowadays. Brown
  bread or white?'</p>

  <p>'Brown, please. I'm going to have to owe you for another trunk call.' He
  picked up the telephone again and called Williams's home address in London.
  While he waited for the connection he called Trimmings and asked to speak to
  the housekeeper. When Mrs Brett a little breathless, arrived on the wire he
  asked who was in the habit of cleaning the shoes at Trimmings and was told
  that it was the kitchen girl, Polly.</p>

  <p>'Could you find out from Polly whether Mr Searle was in the habit of
  taking off his brown buckled shoes without unbuckling them, or if he always
  unbuckled them first?'</p>

  <p>Yes, Mrs Brett would do that, but wouldn't the Inspector like to speak to
  Polly himself?</p>

  <p>'No, thank you. I'll confirm anything she says, later on, of course. But I
  think she is less likely to get flustered if you ask her a quite ordinary
  question than if she was brought to the telephone to be questioned by a
  stranger. I don't want her to be agitated into thinking about the question at
  all. I want her first natural reaction to the question. Were the shoes
  buckled or unbuckled when she cleaned them?'</p>

  <p>Mrs Brett understood, and would the Inspector hang on?</p>

  <p>'No. I'm expecting an important call. But I shall call you back in a very
  short time.'</p>

  <p>Then London came on the wire, and Williams's not-too-pleased voice could
  be heard telling the Exchange: 'All right, all right, I've been ready any
  time this last five minutes.'</p>

  <p>'That you, Williams? This is Grant. Listen. I was coming up to town today
  to interview Leslie Searle's cousin. Yes, I found out where she lived. Her
  name is Searle. Miss Searle. And she lives at 9 Holly Pavement, in Hampstead.
  It's a sort of coagulation of artists. I talked to her last night on the
  telephone and I arranged to see her this afternoon about three. Now I can't.
  A boy has just fished a shoe belonging to Leslie Searle out of the river.
  Yes, all right, crow! So we have to start dragging all over again, and I have
  to be here. Are you free to go and see Miss Searle for me, or shall I get
  someone else from the Yard?'</p>

  <p>'No, I'll go, sir. What do you want me to ask her?'</p>

  <p>'Get everything she knows about Leslie Searle. When she saw him last. What
  friends he had in England. Everything she can give you about him.'</p>

  <p>'Very good. What time shall I call you back?'</p>

  <p>'Well, you ought to be there at a quarter to three, and leaving an hour
  clear&mdash;four o'clock, perhaps.'</p>

  <p>'At the Wickham station?'</p>

  <p>'Well, no, perhaps not. In view of the slowness of dragging, perhaps you
  had better call me at the Mill House at Salcott. It is Salcott 5.'</p>

  <p>It was only when he had hung up that he realised that he had not asked
  Williams how his mission to Benny Skoll had turned out.</p>

  <p>Marta came in with his breakfast, and as she poured his coffee he talked
  to Trimmings again.</p>

  <p>Mrs Brett had talked to Polly, and Polly had no doubt about the matter at
  all. The straps on Mr Searle's brown shoes had always been undone when he put
  them out for cleaning. She knew because she used to rebuckle them so as to
  keep the straps from banging about when she cleaned them. She buckled them to
  keep the straps still and unbuckled them when she had finished.</p>

  <p>So that was that.</p>

  <p>He began to eat his breakfast, and Marta poured out a cup of coffee for
  herself and sat sipping it. She looked cold and pale, but he could not resist
  the question:</p>

  <p>'Did you notice anything odd about the shoe?'</p>

  <p>'Yes. It hadn't been unfastened.'</p>

  <p>A marvellous woman. He supposed that she must have vices to counterbalance
  so many excellences but he couldn't imagine what they could be.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch15"
     id="ch15"></a>CHAPTER XV</h2>

  <p class="first">IT was very cold by the river. The willows shivered, and the
  water was pewter colour, its surface alternately wrinkled by the wind and
  pitted by the passing showers. As the slow hours went by Rodgers's normally
  anxious face slipped into a settled melancholy, and the tip of his nose
  peering out from the turned-up collar of his waterproof was pink and sad. So
  far no intruders had come to share their vigil. The Mill House had been sworn
  to secrecy and had not found the secrecy any strain; Mrs Thrupp had retired
  to bed, still 'heaving'; and Tommy, as police ally, was part of the dragging
  party. The wide sweep of the river across the alluvial land was far from road
  or path and devoid of dwellings, so there were no passers-by to stop and
  stare, to pause for a little and then go on to spread the news.</p>

  <p>They were in a world by themselves down there by the river. A timeless
  world, and comfortless.</p>

  <p>Grant and Rodgers had exhausted professional post-mortems long ago, and
  had got no further. Now they were just two men alone in a meadow on a chilly
  spring day. They sat together on the stump of a fallen willow, Grant watching
  the slow sweep of the questing drag, Rodgers looking out across the wide
  flats of the valley floor.</p>

  <p>'This is all flooded in winter,' he said. 'Looks quite lovely, too, if you
  could forget the damage it's doing.'</p><br>

  <p class="verse">'"Swift beauty come to pass<br>
  Has drowned the blades that strove",'</p>

  <p class="first">Grant said.</p>

  <p>'What is that?'</p>

  <p>'What an army friend of mine wrote about floods.</p><br>

  <p class="verse">"Where once did wake and move<br>
  The slight and ardent grass.<br>
  Swift beauty come to pass<br>
  Has drowned the blades that strove."'</p><br>

  <p>'Nice,' Rodgers said.</p>

  <p>'Sadly old-fashioned,' Grant said. 'It <i>sounds</i> like poetry. A fatal
  defect, I understand.'</p>

  <p>'Is it long?'</p>

  <p>'Just two verses and the moral.'</p>

  <p>'What is the moral?'</p><br>

  <p class="verse">'"O Final Beauty, found<br>
  In many a drownèd place,<br>
  We love not less thy face<br>
  For lesser beauties drowned."'</p><br>

  <p>Rodgers thought it over. 'That's good, that is,' he said. 'Your army
  friend knew what he was talking about. I was never one for reading poems in
  books&mdash;I mean collections, but magazines sometimes put verses in to fill
  up the space when a story doesn't come to the bottom of the page. You
  know?'</p>

  <p>'I know.'</p>

  <p>'I read a lot of these, and every now and then one of them rings a bell. I
  remember one of them to this day. It wasn't poetry properly speaking, I mean
  it didn't rhyme, but it got me where I lived. It said:</p><br>

  <p class="verse">"My lot is cast in inland places,<br>
  Far from sounding beach<br>
  And crying gull,<br>
  And I<br>
  Who knew the sea's voice from my babyhood<br>
  Must listen to a river purling<br>
  Through green fields,<br>
  And small birds gossiping<br>
  Among the leaves."</p><br>

  <p>'Now, you see, I was bred by the sea, over at Mere Harbour, and I've never
  quite got used to being away from it. You feel hedged in, suffocated. But I
  never found the words for it till I read that. I know exactly how that bloke
  felt. "Small birds gossiping!"'</p>

  <p>The scorn and exasperation in his voice amused Grant, but something amused
  him much more and he began to laugh.</p>

  <p>'What's funny?' Rodgers asked, a shade defensively.</p>

  <p>'I was just thinking how shocked the writers of slick detective stories
  would be if they could witness two police inspectors sitting on a willow tree
  swapping poems.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, them!' Rodgers said, in the tone that in lower circles is followed by
  a spit. 'Ever read any of these things?'</p>

  <p>'Oh, yes. Now and then.'</p>

  <p>'My sergeant makes a hobby of it. Collects the howlers. His record so far
  is ninety-two to a book. In a thing called <i>Gods to the Rescue</i> by some
  woman or other.' He stopped to watch something and added: 'There's a woman
  coming now. Pushing a bike.'</p>

  <p>Grant took a look and said: 'That's not a woman. It's a goddess to the
  rescue.'</p>

  <p>It was the unconquerable Marta, with vacuum flasks of hot coffee and
  sandwiches for all.</p>

  <p>'The bicycle was the only way I could think of for carrying them,' she
  explained, 'but it is difficult because most of the gates don't open.'</p>

  <p>'How did you get through them, then?'</p>

  <p>'I unloaded the bicycle, lifted the thing over, and loaded it again the
  other side.'</p>

  <p>'The spirit that made the Empire.'</p>

  <p>'That's as may be, but Tommy must come with me on the way back, and help
  me.'</p>

  <p>'Sure I will, Miss Hallard,' Tommy said, his mouth full of sandwich.</p>

  <p>The men came up from the river and were presented to Marta. It amused
  Grant to notice the <i>cameraderie</i> of those who quite patently had never
  heard of her, and the awed good manners of those who had.</p>

  <p>'I think the news has leaked out,' Marta said. 'Toby rang me up and asked
  if it was true that the river was being dragged again.'</p>

  <p>'You didn't tell him why?'</p>

  <p>'No. Oh, no,' she said, her face going a little bleak again at the memory
  of the shoe.</p>

  <p>By two o'clock in the afternoon they had a large attendance. And by three
  o'clock the place was like a fair, with the local constable making valiant
  efforts to preserve some kind of decency.</p>

  <p>At half-past three, when they had dragged the river almost as far as
  Salcott itself and had still turned up nothing. Grant went back to the Mill
  House and found Walter Whitmore there.</p>

  <p>'It was kind of you to send us the message, Inspector,' he said. 'I should
  have come to the river, but somehow I couldn't.'</p>

  <p>'There was not the slightest need for you to come.'</p>

  <p>'Marta said that you were coming back here at teatime, so I waited here.
  Any&mdash;results?'</p>

  <p>'Not so far.'</p>

  <p>'Why did you want to know about the shoe, this morning?'</p>

  <p>'Because it was fastened when found. I wanted to know if Searle normally
  pulled off those shoes without unbuckling them. Apparently he always
  unbuckled them.'</p>

  <p>'Then why&mdash;how could the shoe be fastened now?'</p>

  <p>'Either it was sucked off by the current, or he kicked it off to make
  swimming easier.'</p>

  <p>'I see,' Walter said, drearily.</p>

  <p>He refused tea, and went away looking more disorientated than ever.</p>

  <p>'I do wish I could be as sorry for him as I should be,' Marta said. 'China
  or Indian?'</p>

  <p>Grant had had three large cups of scalding tea ('<i>So</i> bad for your
  inside!' Marta said) and was beginning to feel human again, when Williams
  rang to report.</p>

  <p>The report, in spite of Williams's best endeavours, was meagre. Miss
  Searle didn't like her cousin and made no bones about it. She, too, was an
  American, but they had been born at opposite sides of the United States and
  had never met until they were grown up. They had fought at sight, apparently.
  He sometimes rang her up when he came to England, but not this time. She had
  not known that he was in England.</p>

  <p>Williams had asked her if she was out a lot, and if she thought it
  possible that Searle could have called, or telephoned, and not found her. She
  said that she had been in the Highlands, painting, and that Searle might have
  called her many times without her knowledge. When she was away the studio was
  empty and there was no one to take telephone messages.</p>

  <p>'Did you see the paintings?' Grant asked. 'The ones of Scotland.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, yes. The place was full of them.'</p>

  <p>'What were they like?'</p>

  <p>'Very like Scotland.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, orthodox.'</p>

  <p>'I wouldn't know. The west of Sutherland and Skye, mostly.'</p>

  <p>'And about his friends in this country?'</p>

  <p>'She said she was surprised to hear that he had any friends anywhere.'</p>

  <p>'She didn't suggest to you that Searle was a wrong 'un?'</p>

  <p>'No, sir. Nothing like that.'</p>

  <p>'And she couldn't suggest any reason why he should suddenly disappear, or
  where he could disappear to?'</p>

  <p>'No, she couldn't. He has no people, she did tell me that. Parents dead,
  apparently; and he was an only child. But about his friends she seemed to
  know nothing. What he said about having only a cousin in England was true,
  anyhow.'</p>

  <p>'Well, thank you very much, Williams. I quite forgot to ask you this
  morning if you found Benny?'</p>

  <p>'Benny? Oh, yes. Quite easily.'</p>

  <p>'And did he cry?'</p>

  <p>Grant heard Williams laugh.</p>

  <p>'No. He pulled a new one this time. He pretended to faint.'</p>

  <p>'What did that get him?'</p>

  <p>'It got him three free brandies and the sympathy of the multitude. We were
  in a pub, I need hardly say. After the second brandy he began to come to and
  moan about the way he was being persecuted, so they gave him a third. I was
  very unpopular.'</p>

  <p>Grant considered this a fine sample of understatement.</p>

  <p>'Luckily it was a West End pub,' Williams said. This, being translated,
  meant that there was no actual interference with his performance of his
  duty.</p>

  <p>'Did he agree to go with you for questioning?'</p>

  <p>'He said he would go if I let him telephone first. I said he knew quite
  well that he was free to telephone anyone at any hour of the day or
  night&mdash;that was a Post Office arrangement&mdash;but if his call was
  innocent I supposed he didn't mind my being the fly on the telephone-booth
  wall.'</p>

  <p>'And did he agree?'</p>

  <p>'He practically dragged me into the box. And who do you think that little
  bastard was telephoning to?'</p>

  <p>'His M.P.?'</p>

  <p>'No. I think M.P.s are a bit shy of him nowadays. He overstayed his
  welcome last time. No, he rang up some bloke he knows who writes for the
  <i>Watchman</i> and told him the tale. Said he was no sooner "out" than some
  policeman or other was on his tail wanting him to go to Scotland Yard for
  questioning, and how was a man to go straight if he was having an innocent
  drink with his friends who didn't know anything about him, and an obvious
  plain-clothes tec came up and wanted to speak to him, and so on and go on.
  Then he came with me, quite pleased with himself.'</p>

  <p>'Was he any help to the Yard?'</p>

  <p>'No, but his girl was.'</p>

  <p>'Did she blab?'</p>

  <p>'No, she was wearing Poppy's earrings. Poppy Plumtre's.'</p>

  <p>'No!'</p>

  <p>'If we didn't happen to be taking Benny out of circulation for a little, I
  think his girl would put him out of it for good. She's raving mad. He hasn't
  had her very long, and it seems she was thinking of leaving him, so Benny
  "bought" her a pair of diamond earrings. The amount of intelligence Benny has
  wouldn't inconvenience a ladybird.'</p>

  <p>'Did you get the rest of Poppy's stuff?'</p>

  <p>'Yes. Benny coughed up. He hadn't had time to get to a fence with
  them.'</p>

  <p>'Good work. What about the <i>Watchman</i>?'</p>

  <p>'Well, I did want to let that <i>Watchman</i> bit of silliness stew in his
  own juice. But the Super wouldn't let me. Said it was no good having trouble
  that we could avoid even if we had the pleasure of seeing the <i>Watchman</i>
  making a fool of itself. So I had to ring him up and tell him.'</p>

  <p>'At least you must have got something back out of that.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, yes. Yes. I don't deny I got some kick out of that. I said: "Mr
  Ritter, I'm Detective-Sergeant Williams. I was present when Benny Skoll rang
  you up a few hours ago." "You were <i>present</i>?" he said. "But he was
  lodging a complaint against you!" "Oh, yes," I said. "It's a free country you
  know." "I don't call it so free for some," he said. "You were dragging him
  away to be questioned at Scotland Yard." I said I invited him to accompany
  me, and he didn't have to if he didn't want to.</p>

  <p>'Then he gave me the old spiel about hounding criminals, and Benny Skoll
  having paid his debt to Society, and that we had no right to hound him now
  that he was a free man again, and so forth. "You have shamed him before his
  friends," says Mr Ritter, "and pushed him back to hopelessness. How much the
  better is Scotland Yard for having badgered poor little Benny Skoll this
  afternoon?"</p>

  <p>'"Two thousand pounds worth," I said.</p>

  <p>'"What?" he said. "What are you talking about?"</p>

  <p>'"That is the amount of jewellery he stole from Poppy Plumtre's flat on
  Friday night."</p>

  <p>'"How do you know it was Benny?" he asked.</p>

  <p>'I said Benny had handed over the loot in person, with the exception of
  two large single diamond earrings which were gracing the ears of his current
  lady friend. Then I said: "<i>Good</i> night, sir", very sweet and low, the
  way they do in the Children's Hour, and hung up. You know, I think he had
  already written that letter about poor innocent Benny. He was so dashed.
  Writers must feel very flat when they've written something that no one can
  use.'</p>

  <p>'Wait till Mr Ritter's flat is burgled,' Grant said. 'He'll come to us
  screaming for the criminal's blood.'</p>

  <p>'Yes, sir. Funny, isn't it? They're always the worst when it happens to
  themselves. Any word from San Francisco?'</p>

  <p>'Not yet, but it may come any minute. It doesn't seem so important
  now.'</p>

  <p>'No. When I think of the whole notebook I filled interviewing bus
  conductors in Wickham! No good for anything but the wastepaper basket.'</p>

  <p>'<i>Never</i> throw notes away, Williams.'</p>

  <p>'Keep them for seven years and find a use for them?'</p>

  <p>'Keep them for your autobiography, if you like, but keep them. I would
  like to have you back here, but at the moment the work doesn't warrant it. It
  is just a matter of standing about in the cold.'</p>

  <p>'Well, I hope something turns up before sunset, sir.'</p>

  <p>'I hope it does. Literally.'</p>

  <p>Grant hung up and went back to the river-bank. The crowd had thinned a
  little as people began to go home to their Sunday high-tea, but the solid
  core who would happily starve in order to see a man's dead body dragged from
  the river were still there. Grant looked at their blue moronic faces and
  speculated for the thousandth time since he became a policeman about what
  made them tick. One thing was certain; if we revived public executions
  tomorrow, the 'gate' would be of cup-tie proportions.</p>

  <p>Rodgers had gone back to Wickham, but it seemed that the Press had
  arrived; both the local man and the Crome correspondent of the London dailies
  wanted to know why the river was being re-dragged. There was also the Oldest
  Inhabitant. The Oldest Inhabitant had a nose and chin that approximated so
  closely that Grant wondered how he shaved. He was a vain old party but he was
  the representative in this gathering of something more powerful than any of
  them: Race Memory; and as such was to be respected.</p>

  <p>'No use you draggin' any furner'n the village,' he said to Grant, as one
  giving the under-gardener instructions.</p>

  <p>'No?'</p>

  <p>'No. No use. She lets everything down, there. Down into the mud.'</p>

  <p>'She' was evidently the river.</p>

  <p>'Why?'</p>

  <p>'She go slow there. Tired, like. Drops everything. Then when she be round
  the turn, half-way to Wickham there, she go tearing off agin all light and
  happy. Ah. That is what she do. Drops everything she be carrying into the
  mud, and then she go quiet for a little, lookin' round t'see if people notice
  what she done, then woops! she be off to Wickham at the tear.' He cocked a
  surprisingly clear blue eye at Grant. 'Sly,' he said. 'That's what she be.
  Sly!'</p>

  <p>Rodgers had said, when first he had talked to him, that it was no use
  dragging below Salcott St Mary, and he had accepted the local man's verdict
  without asking for an explanation. Now here was Race Memory offering him the
  explanation.</p>

  <p>'Not much use you draggin' anyway,' said Race Memory, wiping the drop from
  its nose with a gesture that was subtly contemptuous.</p>

  <p>'Why? Don't you believe there is a body there?'</p>

  <p>'Oh, ah! Body there all right. But that mud there, it don't give up
  nothin' 'cept in its own time.'</p>

  <p>'And when is that likely to be, would you say?'</p>

  <p>'Oh! Any time 'tween a thousand years and tomorrow. Powerful sticky that
  mud be. Quicksand mud. When my great-grandfer were a little boy he had a
  barra run down the bank, like, into the water. Quite shallow it were there.
  He could see the barra but he were frightened, see, to wade in for it. So he
  run to the cottage. No more'n a few yards. And brung his father out to reach
  the barra for him. But the mud had it. Ah. The mud had it in the time you'd
  turn yer back. Not a blink of the barra left. Not even when they got a rake
  and dragged for it. The mud had it, see. Cannibal mud, that is, I tell ee,
  cannibal mud.'</p>

  <p>'But you say it does give up its victims sometimes.'</p>

  <p>'Oh. Ah. Happen.'</p>

  <p>'When? In flood?'</p>

  <p>'Nah! In flood she just spread herself. Go broody and drop more mud'n
  ever. Nah. But sometime she be taken aback. Then she let go in surprise.'</p>

  <p>'Taken aback?'</p>

  <p>'Ah. Same as she were a week since. Cloud come and hit the high country
  above Otley and burst there, and pour water into the river like someone
  pouring bathwater away. She have no time to spread out decent and quiet. The
  water come down channel like a scouring brush and churn her up. Then happen
  sometimes she loose something from the mud.'</p>

  <p>It was a poor outlook, Grant felt, if he had to wait until the next
  cloudburst to recover Searle's body. The gathering greyness of the day
  depressed him; in a couple of hours they would have to call it off. By that
  time, moreover, they would have reached Salcott, and if they had found
  nothing, what hope was there? He had had a horrible feeling all day that they
  were merely scratching the surface of that 'immemorial mud'. If this second
  dragging proved useless, what then? No inquest. No case. No nothing.</p>

  <p>By the time a watery sunset was bathing the scene in pallid light they
  were within fifty yards of the end of their beat. And at that moment Rodgers
  reappeared and produced an envelope from the pocket of his coat.</p>

  <p>'This came for you when I was at the station. It's the report from the
  States.'</p>

  <p>There was no urgency about it now, but he opened it and read it
  through.</p>

  <p>The San Francisco police had no record against Leslie Searle, and knew of
  none. He was in the habit of coming to the Coast for the winter months. For
  the rest of the year he travelled and photographed abroad. He lived well but
  very quietly, and there was no record of expensive parties or other
  extravagances of conduct. He had no wife with him and no history of emotional
  entanglements. The San Francisco police had no record of his origins but they
  had applied to the Publicity department at Grand Continental, for which
  studio Searle had photographed Lotta Marlow and Danny Minsky, the reigning
  stars of the moment. According to Grand Continental, Searle had been born in
  Jobling, Conn. Only child of Durfey Searle and Christina Mattson. Police at
  Jobling, Conn., asked about the Searles, said they left town more than twenty
  years ago and went South somewhere. Searle was a chemist, with a passion for
  photography, but that is all anyone remembered about them.</p>

  <p>Well, it was a dull enough report. An uninspiring collection of unhelpful
  facts. No clue to the thing he had wanted most; Searle's intimates in the
  States. No illumination on Searle himself. But something in the report rang a
  bell in his head.</p>

  <p>He read it over again, waiting for that warning click in his mind that was
  like the sound a clock makes when it is preparing to strike. But this time
  there was no reaction.</p>

  <p>Puzzled, he read it through again, slowly. What was it that had made that
  warning sound in his mind? He could find nothing. Still puzzled, he folded up
  the paper and put it away in his pocket.</p>

  <p>'We're finished, I suppose you know?' Rodgers said. 'We'll find nothing
  now. Nothing has ever been taken back from the river at Salcott. In this part
  of the country they have a proverb. When they want to say: Give a thing up,
  or: Put it out of your mind for good, they say: "Throw it over the bridge at
  Salcott".'</p>

  <p>'Why don't they dredge the channel instead of letting all this stuff silt
  up on them,' Grant said, out of temper. 'If they did they wouldn't have the
  river flooding their houses every second winter.'</p>

  <p>Rodgers's long face shortened into amusement and kindliness. 'If you'd
  ever smelt a bucket of Rushmere mud, you'd think a long time before you'd
  willingly arrange for it to be dragged up in wagon loads and carted through
  the street. Shall I stop them now?'</p>

  <p>'No,' said Grant, mulishly. 'Let them go on dragging as long as the light
  lasts. Who knows, we may make history and be the first to take something back
  from the river at Salcott. I never did believe in those country
  superstitions, anyhow.'</p>

  <p>They did go on dragging till the light went, but the river gave nothing
  back.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch16"
     id="ch16"></a>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

  <p class="first">'SHALL I give you a lift back to Wickham,' Rodgers asked
  Grant, but Grant said no, that he had his own car up at the Mill House and
  would walk up and fetch it.</p>

  <p>Marta came out into the windy twilight to meet him, and put her arm
  through his.</p>

  <p>'No?' she said.</p>

  <p>'No.'</p>

  <p>'Come in and get warm.'</p>

  <p>She walked beside him in silence into the house and poured him an outsize
  whisky. The thick walls shut out the sound of the wind, and the room was
  quiet and warm as it had been last night. A faint smell of curry came up from
  the kitchen.</p>

  <p>'Do you smell what I am cooking for you?'</p>

  <p>'Curry. But you can't be expected to feed the Department.'</p>

  <p>'Curry is what you need after a whole day of our English spring glories.
  You can, of course, go back to the White Hart and have the usual Sunday
  evening supper of cold tinned beef, two slices of tomato, three cubes of
  beetroot, and a wilting lettuce leaf.'</p>

  <p>Grant shivered unaffectedly. The thought of the White Hart on a Sunday
  evening was death.</p>

  <p>'Besides, tomorrow I shan't be here to give you dinner. I am going back to
  town. I can't stand the Mill House any more at the moment. I'll stay in town
  till <i>Faint Heart</i> goes into rehearsal.'</p>

  <p>'Having you here has practically saved my life,' Grant said. He pulled the
  American report from his pocket and said: 'Read that, would you, and tell me
  if anything rings a bell for you.'</p>

  <p>'No,' she said, having read. 'No bells. Should it?'</p>

  <p>'I don't know. It seemed to me when I read it first that it rang a bell in
  my mind.' He puzzled over it again for a moment and then put it away.</p>

  <p>'When we are both back in town,' Marta said, 'I want to be introduced to
  your Sergeant Williams. Perhaps you would bring him to dinner one night?'</p>

  <p>'But of course,' Grant said, pleased and amused. 'Why this sudden passion
  for the unknown Williams?'</p>

  <p>'Well, I have actually two different reasons. The first is that anyone who
  has the mother-wit to see that Walter Whitmore is a "push-ee" is worth
  meeting. And the second is that the only time I have seen you look happy
  today was after talking to Sergeant Williams on the telephone.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, that!' he said; and told her about Benny Skoll, and the
  <i>Watchman</i>, and Williams rebuking virtue. And so they were gay after all
  over their Sunday supper, with Marta supplying libellous stories of the
  <i>Watchman's</i> theatre critic. So that it was not until he was going that
  she asked what he was going to do now that the search for Searle had
  failed.</p>

  <p>'I tidy up some ends here in Salcott tomorrow morning,' he said, 'and then
  I go back to London to report to my chief.'</p>

  <p>'And what happens then?'</p>

  <p>'There is a conference to decide what action, if any, is to be taken.'</p>

  <p>'I understand. Well, when you have got things straightened out ring me up
  and tell me, won't you. And then we can arrange a night when Sergeant
  Williams is free.'</p>

  <p>How admirable, he thought as he drove away; how truly admirable. No
  questions, no hints, no little feminine probings. In her acceptance of a
  situation she was extraordinarily masculine. Perhaps it was this lack of
  dependence that men found intimidating.</p>

  <p>He went back to the White Hart, called the police station to know if there
  were any messages, picked the menu off the dining-room sideboard to verify
  Marta's prognostication as to supper (she had forgotten the stewed rhubarb
  and custard, he must tell her) and for the last time went to bed in the
  little room under the roof. The text was no promise tonight. THE HOUR COMETH,
  indeed. What a lot of leisure women seemed to have had once. Now they had
  everything in cans and had no leisure at all.</p>

  <p>But no, it wasn't that, of course. It was that they didn't spend their
  leisure making texts in coloured wools any more. They went to see Danny
  Minsky and laughed themselves sick for one-and-tuppence, and if you asked him
  it was a better way of recovering from the day's work than making meaningless
  patterns in purple cross-stitch. He glared at the text, tilted the lamp until
  the shadow blotted out his vision of it, and took his notebooks to bed with
  him.</p>

  <p>In the morning he paid his bill, and pretended not to see the landlord's
  surprise. Everyone knew that the river-dragging had been unsuccessful, and
  everyone knew that a piece of clothing recovered from the river had caused
  that dragging (there, were various accounts of which particular piece of
  clothing), so the landlord hardly expected Scotland Yard to be taking its
  departure at this juncture. Unless there was a clue that no one knew
  about?</p>

  <p>'Coming back, sir?'</p>

  <p>'Not immediately,' Grant said, reading his mind like a book and not
  particularly liking the stigma of failure that was being tacked on to his
  name at this moment.</p>

  <p>And he headed for Trimmings.</p>

  <p>The morning had an air of bland apology. It was smiling wetly and the wind
  had died. The leaves glittered and the roads steamed in the sun. 'Just my
  fun, dears,' the English spring was saying to the soaked and shivering
  mortals who had trusted her.</p>

  <p>As the car purred along the slope, towards Trimmings, he looked down at
  Salcott St Mary in the valley, and thought how odd it was that three days ago
  it was just a name that Marta used occasionally in conversation. Now it was
  part of his mind.</p>

  <p>And God send it wasn't going to be a burr stuck there for good!</p>

  <p>At Trimmings he was received by the refayned Edith, who broke down enough
  to look humanly scared for a moment when she saw him, and asked to see
  Walter. She showed him into the fireless library; from which Walter rescued
  him.</p>

  <p>'Come into the drawing-room,' he said. 'We use it as a living-room and
  there is a fire there'; and Grant caught himself wondering ungratefully
  whether it was his own comfort that Walter was considering or his guest's.
  Walter did affect one that way, he observed.</p>

  <p>'I am going back to town this morning,' Grant said, 'and there are one or
  two small points I want to clear up before I make my report to my
  superiors.'</p>

  <p>'Yes?' Walter was nervous and looked as if he had not slept.</p>

  <p>'When I asked you about your journey down the Rushmere, you said that you
  had picked up mail at arranged post-offices.'</p>

  <p>'Yes.'</p>

  <p>'On Monday there would have been nothing to pick up, but on Tuesday and
  Wednesday you presumably picked up what there was. Did Searle have any
  letters on either of those two days, can you remember?'</p>

  <p>'There's no difficulty in remembering. Inspector, Searle <i>never</i> had
  <i>any</i> mail.'</p>

  <p>'Never? You mean Searle had no letters at all while he was at
  Trimmings?'</p>

  <p>'None that I ever knew about. But Liz would tell you. She deals with the
  post when it comes in.'</p>

  <p>How had he missed this small item of information, he wondered.</p>

  <p>'Not even forwarded from his hotel or bank?'</p>

  <p>'Not that I know of. He may have been letting it mount up. Some people are
  constitutionally indifferent to letters.'</p>

  <p>That was true; and Grant left it there.</p>

  <p>'Then about this daily telephoning,' he said. 'You telephoned from
  Tunstall on Sunday night, from Capel on Monday night, from Friday Street on
  Tuesday, and from where on Wednesday?'</p>

  <p>'There's a call-box at Pett's Hatch. We had meant to camp actually at
  Pett's Hatch, but that ruined mill looked dreary somehow, and I remembered
  the sheltered bit farther on where the river turns south, so we went on to
  there.'</p>

  <p>'And you told Trimmings about this proposed camp.'</p>

  <p>'Yes, I told you already that we did.'</p>

  <p>'I know you did. I don't mean to badger you. What I want to know now is
  who talked to whom during that call from Pett's Hatch?'</p>

  <p>Walter thought for a moment. 'Well, I talked to Miss Fitch first because
  she was always waiting for the call, then Searle talked to her. Then Aunt Em
  came&mdash;Mrs Garrowby&mdash;and talked to Searle for a little and then I
  finished up by talking to Mrs Garrowby myself. Liz hadn't come in from an
  errand in the village, so neither of us talked to her on Wednesday.'</p>

  <p>'I see. Thank you.' Grant waited, and then said: 'I suppose you don't feel
  able yet to tell me what the subject of your&mdash;disagreement was on
  Wednesday night?' And as Walter hesitated: 'Is it because it was about Miss
  Garrowby that you are reluctant to discuss it?'</p>

  <p>'I don't want her dragged into this,' Walter said, and Grant could not
  help feeling that this cliché was less the result of emotion than of a
  conviction that it was thus an Englishman behaved in the circumstances.</p>

  <p>'I ask, as I said before, more as a way of obtaining enlightenment on the
  subject of Leslie Searle than of pinning you down to anything. Was there
  anything in that conversation, apart from Miss Garrowby's entry into it, that
  you would rather I didn't know?'</p>

  <p>'No, of course not. It was just about Liz&mdash;about Miss Garrowby. It
  was an extremely silly conversation.'</p>

  <p>Grant smiled heartlessly. 'Mr Whitmore, a policeman has experienced the
  absolute in silliness before he has finished his third year in the force. If
  you are merely reluctant to put silliness on record, take heart. To me it
  will probably sound like something near wisdom.'</p>

  <p>'There was no wisdom about it. Searle had been in a very odd mood all the
  evening.'</p>

  <p>'Odd? Depressed?' Surely, thought Grant, we aren't going to have to
  consider suicide at this late stage.</p>

  <p>'No. He seemed to be invaded by an unwonted levity. And on the way from
  the river he began to twit me about&mdash;well, about my not being good
  enough for Liz. For my fiancée. I tried to change the subject, but he kept at
  it. Until I grew annoyed. He began enumerating all the things he knew about
  her that I didn't. He would trot out something and say: "I bet you didn't
  know that about her."'</p>

  <p>'Nice things?'</p>

  <p>'Oh, yes,' Walter said instantly. 'Yes, of course. Charming things. But it
  was all so needless and so provocative.'</p>

  <p>'Did he suggest that he would be more appreciative in your place?'</p>

  <p>'He did more. He said quite frankly that if he put his mind to it he could
  cut me out. He could cut me out in a fortnight, he said.'</p>

  <p>'He didn't offer to bet on it, I suppose?' Grant couldn't help asking.</p>

  <p>'No,' Walter said, looking a little surprised.</p>

  <p>Grant thought that some day he must tell Marta that she had slipped up in
  one particular.</p>

  <p>'It was when he said that,' Walter said, 'about cutting me out, that I
  felt I couldn't stand him any more that night. It wasn't the suggestion of my
  not being his equal that I resented, I hope you understand, Inspector; it was
  the implied reflection on Liz. On Miss Garrowby. The implication that she
  would succumb to anyone who used his charms on her.'</p>

  <p>'I understand,' said Grant gravely. 'Thank you very much for telling me.
  Do you think, then, that Searle was deliberately provoking a quarrel?'</p>

  <p>'I hadn't thought of it. I just thought he was in a provocative mood. That
  he was a little above himself.'</p>

  <p>'I see. Thank you. Could I speak to Miss Fitch for just one moment. I
  won't keep her.'</p>

  <p>Walter took him to the morning-room where Miss Fitch, with a yellow and a
  red pencil stuck in her ginger bird's-nest and another in her mouth, was
  prowling up and down like an enraged kitten. She relaxed when she saw Grant,
  and looked tired and a little sad.</p>

  <p>'Have you come with news, Inspector?' she asked, and Grant, looking past
  her, saw the fright in Liz's eyes.</p>

  <p>'No, I've come to ask you one question, Miss Fitch, and then I shan't
  bother you again. I apologise for bothering you as it is. On Wednesday night
  you were waiting for the evening call from your nephew with an account of
  their progress.'</p>

  <p>'Yes.'</p>

  <p>'So that you talked to him first. I mean first of the people at Trimmings.
  Will you go on from there?'</p>

  <p>'Tell you what we talked about, you mean?'</p>

  <p>'No; who talked to whom.'</p>

  <p>'Oh. Well, they were at Pett's Hatch&mdash;I suppose you know&mdash;and I
  talked to Walter and then to Leslie. They were both very happy.'</p>

  <p>Her voice wavered. 'Then I called Emma&mdash;my sister&mdash;and she spoke
  to them both.'</p>

  <p>'Did you wait while she spoke to them?'</p>

  <p>'No, I went up to my room to see Susie Sclanders's imitations. She does
  ten minutes on a Wednesday once a month, and she is wonderful, and of course
  I couldn't listen to her properly with Em talking.'</p>

  <p>'I see. And Miss Garrowby?'</p>

  <p>'Liz arrived back from the village just too late to talk to them.'</p>

  <p>'What time was this, do you remember?'</p>

  <p>'I don't remember the exact time, but it must have been about twenty
  minutes before dinner. We had dinner early that night because my sister was
  going out to a W.R.I. meeting. Dinner at Trimmings is always being put either
  back or forwards because someone is either going somewhere or coming from
  some place.'</p>

  <p>'Thank you very much, Miss Fitch. And now, if I might see Searle's room
  once more I won't bother you again.'</p>

  <p>'Yes, of course.'</p>

  <p>'I'll take the Inspector up,' Liz said, ignoring the fact that Walter, who
  was still hovering, was the normal person to escort him.</p>

  <p>She got up from the typewriter before Miss Fitch could intervene with any
  alternative proposal, and led the Inspector out.</p>

  <p>'Are you going away because you have come to a conclusion, Inspector, or
  because you haven't; or shouldn't I ask that?' she said as they went
  upstairs.</p>

  <p>'I am going as a matter of routine. To do what every officer is expected
  to do; to present his report to his seniors and let them decide what the
  facts add up to.'</p>

  <p>'But you do some adding first, surely.'</p>

  <p>'A lot of subtraction, too,' he said, dryly.</p>

  <p>The dryness was not lost on her. 'Nothing makes sense in this case, does
  it,' she agreed. 'Walter says he couldn't have fallen into the river
  accidentally. And yet he did fall in. Somehow.'</p>

  <p>She paused on the landing outside the tower room. There was a roof-light
  there and her face was clear in every detail as she turned to him and said:
  'The one certain thing in this mess is that Walter had nothing to do with
  Leslie's death. Please believe that, Inspector. I'm not defending Walter
  because he is Walter and I am going to marry him. I've known him all my life,
  and I know what he is capable of and what he is not capable of. And he is not
  capable of using physical violence to anyone. Do please believe me.
  He&mdash;he just hasn't the <i>guts</i>.'</p>

  <p>Even his future wife thought him a push-ee, Grant observed.</p>

  <p>'Don't be misled by that glove, either. Inspector. Do please believe that
  the most probable explanation is that Leslie picked it up and put it into his
  pocket meaning to give it back to me. I have looked for the other one of the
  pair in the car pocket and it isn't there, so the most likely explanation is
  that they fell out, and Leslie found one and picked it up.'</p>

  <p>'Why didn't he put it back in the car pocket?'</p>

  <p>'I don't know. Why does one do anything? Putting something in one's pocket
  is almost a reflex. The point is that he wouldn't have kept it for the sake
  of keeping it. Leslie didn't feel about me like that at all.'</p>

  <p>The point, Grant thought to himself, wasn't whether Leslie was in love
  with Liz, but whether Walter believed Liz to be in love with Leslie.</p>

  <p>He longed to ask Liz what happens to a girl when she is engaged to a
  push-ee and along comes a left-over from Eden, an escapee from Atlantis, a
  demon in plain clothes. But the question, though pertinent, would certainly
  be unproductive. Instead, he asked her if Searle had ever received letters
  during his stay at Trimmings and she said that as far as she knew he had had
  none. Then she went away downstairs, and he went into the tower room. The
  tidy room where Searle had left everything except his personality.</p>

  <p>He had not seen it in daylight before, and he spent a few moments having a
  look at the garden and the valley from the three huge windows. There was one
  advantage in not caring what your house looked like when it was finished; you
  could have your windows where they were likely to do most good. Then he
  turned once more to the task of going through Searle's belongings. Patiently,
  garment by garment, article by article, he went through them, vainly hoping
  for some sign, some revelation. He sat in a low chair with the photographic
  box open on the floor between his feet, and accounted for everything that a
  photographer might conceivably use. He could think of nothing&mdash;neither
  chemical nor gadget&mdash;that was missing from the collection. The box had
  not been moved since last he saw it, and the empty space still held the
  outline of what had been abstracted.</p>

  <p>It was an innocent space. Articles are abstracted every day from packed
  cases, leaving the outline of their presence. There was no reason whatever to
  suppose that what had been taken out was of any significance. But why, in
  heaven's name, couldn't anyone suggest what that thing might have been?</p>

  <p>Once more he tried the small cameras in the space, knowing quite well that
  they would not fit. He even clapped a pair of Searle's shoes together and
  tried to fit them into the space. They were half an inch too long and the
  soles protruded above the general level so that the tray would not fit home
  and the lid was prevented from shutting. Anyhow, why carry clothing in a
  photographic box when you had ample room in the appropriate cases? Whatever
  had occupied the space had not been put in at random or in haste. It had been
  a neat and methodical packing.</p>

  <p>Which suggested that the thing was put there because only Searle himself
  would have the unpacking of it.</p>

  <p>Well, this, in the elegant phrase, was where he got off.</p>

  <p>He put everything neatly back as he had found it; took another look at the
  Rushmere valley, and decided that he had had enough of it; and closed the
  door on the room where Leslie Searle had left everything but his
  personality.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch17"
     id="ch17"></a>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

  <p class="first">IT was grey in town, but it was a friendly grey and
  comforting after the rainy levels of the Rushmere. And the young green of the
  trees in Westminster was vivid as fire against the dark background. It was
  nice to be among his own kind again; to get into that mental undress that one
  wears among one's colleagues; to talk the allusive unexplanatory talk that
  constituted Headquarters' 'shop'.</p>

  <p>But it was not so nice to think of the coming interview with Bryce. Would
  it be one of Bryce's good days or one of his 'off' ones? The Superintendent's
  average was one off day to three good ones, so the odds were three to one in
  his favour. On the other hand it was damp weather and the Superintendent's
  rheumatism was always worst in damp weather.</p>

  <p>Bryce was smoking a pipe. So it was one of his good days. (On his off days
  he lit cigarettes and extinguished them in the ashtray five seconds after he
  had extinguished the match.)</p>

  <p>Grant wondered how to begin. He couldn't very well say: Four days ago you
  handed over a situation to me, and the situation as far as I'm concerned is
  in all essentials exactly what it was four days ago. But that, put brutally,
  was how the case stood.</p>

  <p>It was Bryce who saved him. Bryce examined him with his small shrewd eyes,
  and said: 'If ever I saw "Please, sir, it wasn't me" written on a man's face,
  it is on yours now,' and Grant laughed.</p>

  <p>'Yes, sir. It's a mess.' He laid his notebooks on the table and took the
  chair at the other side of the table that was known in the office as the
  Suspect's Seat.</p>

  <p>'You don't think that Bunny-Boy Whitmore did it, then?'</p>

  <p>'No, sir. I think it's unlikely to the point of absurdity.'</p>

  <p>'Accident?'</p>

  <p>'Bunny-Boy doesn't think so,' Grant said with a grin.</p>

  <p>'<i>Doesn't</i> he, indeed. Hasn't he even enough sense to come in out of
  the rain?'</p>

  <p>'He's a simple sort of creature, in some ways. He just doesn't believe
  that it was accident, and says so. The fact that it would be to his advantage
  to have it proved an accident is irrelevant in his view, apparently. He is
  wildly puzzled and troubled about the disappearance. I am quite sure he had
  nothing to do with it.'</p>

  <p>'Any alternative suggestion?'</p>

  <p>'Well, there is someone who had the opportunity, the motive, and the
  means.'</p>

  <p>'What are we waiting for?' Bryce said, flippant.</p>

  <p>'Unfortunately the fourth ingredient is missing.'</p>

  <p>'No evidence.'</p>

  <p>'Not one sliver of a tittle.'</p>

  <p>'Who is it?'</p>

  <p>'The mother of Walter Whitmore's fiancée. Stepmother actually. She brought
  Liz Garrowby up from babyhood and is fanatically maternal about her. I don't
  mean possessive, but&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'All the best for our Liz.'</p>

  <p>'Yes. She was enormously pleased about her stepdaughter marrying her
  nephew, and keeping everything in the family, and I think Searle looked like
  upsetting the apple-cart. That is a possible motive. She has no alibi for the
  night in question, and she could have reached the place where they were
  camped quite easily. She knew where it was because each evening the men
  telephoned Trimmings, the Fitch place, to report progress, and on Wednesday
  night they described the place where they were going to bivouac.'</p>

  <p>'But she couldn't know that the men would quarrel and go back to the river
  separately. How was she going to work it?'</p>

  <p>'Well, there's an odd thing about that quarrel. Searle from all accounts
  was a markedly equable person, but it was he who provoked that quarrel. At
  least Whitmore says so, and I have no reason to doubt him. He twitted
  Whitmore about not being good enough for Liz Garrowby and boasted that he
  could take her from him in a week. He was quite sober, so anything so
  completely out of character must have had an ulterior motive.'</p>

  <p>'You think he manufactured a parting with Searle that evening? Why?'</p>

  <p>'It <i>could</i> have been because he hoped to meet Liz Garrowby
  somewhere. The Garrowby girl was not at home that evening when the two men
  telephoned, so Mrs Garrowby did proxy. I suggest that she might also have
  done proxy in a more serious way.'</p>

  <p>'"Liz says will you meet her at the third oak past the old mill".'</p>

  <p>'Something like that.'</p>

  <p>'And then raging mother waits for him with a blunt instrument and tips the
  body into the river. I wish to heaven you had been able to recover that
  body.'</p>

  <p>'You don't wish it as badly as I do, sir. Without a corpse where are
  we?'</p>

  <p>'Even with a corpse you have no case.'</p>

  <p>'No. But it would be comforting, not to say illuminating, to know the
  state of the skull bones.'</p>

  <p>'Any evidence that Searle was interested in the girl?'</p>

  <p>'He had one of her gloves in his collar drawer.'</p>

  <p>Bryce grunted. 'I thought that sort of thing went out with valentines,' he
  said, unconsciously paraphrasing Sergeant Williams.</p>

  <p>'I showed it to her and she took it well. Said that he had probably picked
  it up and meant to give it back to her.'</p>

  <p>'And now I'll tell one,' commented the Superintendent.</p>

  <p>'She's a nice girl,' Grant said, mildly.</p>

  <p>'So was Madeleine Smith. Any second favourite in the suspect stakes?'</p>

  <p>'No. Just the field. The men who had no reason to love Searle, and had the
  opportunity and no satisfactory alibi.'</p>

  <p>'Are there many?' Bryce said, surprised by the plural.</p>

  <p>'There's Toby Tullis, who is still sick at the snubbing Searle
  administered. Tullis lives on the river-bank and has a boat. His alibi
  depends on the word of an infatuated follower. There's Serge Ratoff the
  dancer, who loathed Searle because of the attention Toby paid him. Serge,
  according to himself, was dancing on the greensward by the river's rim on
  Wednesday night. There's Silas Weekley, the distinguished English novelist,
  who lives in the lane down which Searle disappeared from human ken on
  Wednesday night. Silas has a thing about beauty; has a constant urge to
  destroy it. He was working in a hut at the end of the garden that night, so
  he says.'</p>

  <p>'No bets on the field?'</p>

  <p>'N-o. I think not. A saver on Weekley, perhaps. He is the type that might
  go over the borderline any day, and spend the rest of his life happily typing
  away in Broadmoor. But Tullis wouldn't jeopardise all he has built up by a
  silly murder like this. He is much too shrewd. As for Ratoff, I can imagine
  him setting off to do a murder, but long before he was half-way there he
  would have another fine idea and forget what he originally set out to
  do.'</p>

  <p>'Is this village entirely inhabited by crack-pots?'</p>

  <p>'It has been "discovered", unfortunately. The aborigines are sane
  enough.'</p>

  <p>'Well, I suppose there is nothing we can do until the body turns up.'</p>

  <p>'<i>If</i> it turns up.'</p>

  <p>'They usually do, in time.'</p>

  <p>'According to the local police, five people have been drowned in the
  Rushmere in the last forty years. That is, leaving Mere Harbour and the
  shipping part out of the reckoning. Two were drowned higher up than Salcott
  and three lower down. The three who were drowned lower down than Salcott all
  turned up within a day or two. The two who were drowned above the village
  have never turned up at all.'</p>

  <p>'It's a nice look-out for Walter Whitmore,' Bryce commented.</p>

  <p>'Yes,' Grant said, thinking it over. 'They weren't very kind to him this
  morning.'</p>

  <p>'The papers? No. Awfully good-mannered and discreet but they couldn't have
  made pleasant reading for Bunny-Boy. A nasty spot to be in. No accusation, so
  no possible defence. Not that he <i>has</i> any,' he added.</p>

  <p>He was silent for a little, tapping his teeth with his pipe as was his
  habit when cogitating.</p>

  <p>'Well, I suppose there is nothing we can do at the moment. You make a neat
  shipshape report and we'll see what the Commissioner says. But I don't see
  that there is anything more we can do. Death by drowning, no evidence so far
  to show whether accidental or otherwise. That's your conclusion, isn't
  it?'</p>

  <p>As Grant did not answer immediately, he looked up and said sharply: 'Isn't
  it?'</p>

  <p>Now you see it, now you don't.</p>

  <p>Something wrong in the set-up.</p>

  <p>Don't let your flair ride you, Grant.</p>

  <p>Something phoney somewhere.</p>

  <p>Now you see it, now you don't.</p>

  <p>Conjurer's patter.</p>

  <p>The trick of the distracted attention.</p>

  <p>You could get away with anything if you distracted the attention.</p>

  <p>Something phoney somewhere....</p>

  <p>'Grant!'</p>

  <p>He came back to the realisation of his chief's surprise. What was he to
  say? Acquiesce and let it go? Stick to the facts and the evidence, and stay
  on the safe side?</p>

  <p>With a detached regret he heard his own voice saying: 'Have you ever seen
  a lady sawn in half, sir?'</p>

  <p>'I have,' Bryce said, eyeing him with a wary disapproval.</p>

  <p>'It seems to me that there is a strong aroma of sawn-lady about this
  case,' Grant said; and then remembered that this was the metaphor he had used
  to Sergeant Williams.</p>

  <p>But Bryce's reaction was very different from the Sergeant's.</p>

  <p>'Oh, my <i>God</i>!' he groaned. 'You're <i>not</i> going to do a Lamont
  on us, are you, Grant?'</p>

  <p>Years ago Grant had gone into the farthest Highlands after a man and had
  brought him back; brought him back sewn up in a case so fault-proof that only
  the sentence remained to be said; and had handed him over with the remark
  that on the whole he thought they had got the wrong man. (They had.) The Yard
  had never forgotten it, and any wild opinion in contradiction to the evidence
  was still known as 'doing a Lamont'.</p>

  <p>The sudden mention of Jerry Lamont heartened Grant. It had been even more
  absurd to feel that Jerry Lamont was innocent, in the face of an unbreakable
  case, than it was to smell 'sawn-lady' in a simple drowning.</p>

  <p>'Grant!'</p>

  <p>'There's something very odd about the set-up,' Grant said stubbornly.</p>

  <p>'What is odd?'</p>

  <p>'If I knew that it would be down in my report. It isn't any one thing.
  It's the&mdash;the whole set-up. The atmosphere. The smell of it. It doesn't
  smell right.'</p>

  <p>'Couldn't you just explain to an ordinary hard-working policeman
  <i>what</i> smells so wrong about it?'</p>

  <p>Grant ignored the Superintendent's heavy-handedness, and said:</p>

  <p>'It's all wrong from the beginning, don't you see. Searle's walking in
  from nowhere, into the party. Yes, I know that we know about him. That he is
  who he says he is, and all that. We even know that he came to England just as
  he says he did. Via Paris. His place was booked by the American Express
  office at the Madeleine. But that doesn't alter the fact that the whole
  episode has something queer about it. <i>Was</i> it so likely that he would
  be all that keen to meet Walter just because they were both friends of Cooney
  Wiggin?'</p>

  <p>'Don't ask me! Was it?'</p>

  <p>'Why this need to meet Walter?'</p>

  <p>'Perhaps he had seen him broadcast and just couldn't wait.'</p>

  <p>'And he had no letters.'</p>

  <p>'Who hadn't?'</p>

  <p>'Searle. He had no letters all the time he was at Salcott.'</p>

  <p>'Perhaps he is allergic to the gum on envelopes. Or I <i>have</i> heard
  that people leave letters lying at their bank to be called for.'</p>

  <p>'That's another thing. None of the usual American banks or agencies has
  ever heard of him. And there is one tiny thing that seems odd to me out of
  all proportion to its actual value. Actual value to this case, I mean. He had
  a tin box, rather like an outsize paint-box, that he used to hold all his
  photographic stuff. Something is gone out of the box. Something roughly 9
  inches by 3½ by 4, that was packed in the lower compartment (it has a tray
  like a paint-box with a deeper space below). Nothing that is now among his
  belongings fits the space, and no one can suggest what the thing could have
  been.'</p>

  <p>'And what is so odd about that? There must be a hundred and one things
  that might have been packed in a space that size.'</p>

  <p>'As what, for instance, sir?'</p>

  <p>'Well&mdash;well, I can't think off-hand, but there must be dozens.'</p>

  <p>'There is ample space in his other cases for anything he wanted to pack.
  So it wouldn't be clothes, or ordinary possessions. Whatever was there, in
  the tin box, was something that he kept where only he would be likely to
  handle it.'</p>

  <p>Bryce's attention grew more sober at that.</p>

  <p>'Now it is missing. It is of no obvious importance in this case. No
  importance at all, perhaps. It is just an oddity and it sticks in my
  mind.'</p>

  <p>'What do you think he might have been after at Trimmings? Blackmail?'
  Bryce asked, with interest at last.</p>

  <p>'I don't know. I hadn't thought of blackmail.'</p>

  <p>'What could have been in the box that he could turn into cash? Not
  letters, that shape. Documents, perhaps? Documents in a roll.'</p>

  <p>'I don't know. Yes, perhaps. The thing against the blackmail idea is that
  he seemed to have ample means.'</p>

  <p>'Blackmailers usually have.'</p>

  <p>'Yes. But Searle had a profession that kept him very nicely. Only a hog
  would want more. And somehow he didn't look to me like a hog.'</p>

  <p>'Be your age, Grant. Just sit quiet for a moment and think of the
  blackmailers you have known.' He watched this shot go home, and said, dryly:
  'Exactly!' And then: 'Who would you say was the blackmailee at Trimmings? Mrs
  Garrowby got a past, do you think?'</p>

  <p>'Possibly,' Grant said, considering Emma Garrowby in a new light. 'Yes, I
  think it's quite possible.'</p>

  <p>'Well, the choice isn't very wide. I don't suppose Lavinia Fitch was ever
  out on the tiles?'</p>

  <p>Grant thought of kind, anxious little Miss Fitch, with the bristling
  pencils in her mop of hair, and smiled.</p>

  <p>'There isn't much choice, you see. I suppose if it was blackmail at all it
  must have been Mrs Garrowby. So your theory is that Searle was murdered for a
  reason that has nothing to do with Liz Garrowby.' And as Grant made no
  immediate answer to that, 'You believe that it <i>was</i> murder, don't
  you.'</p>

  <p>'No.'</p>

  <p>'No!'</p>

  <p>'I don't believe he's dead.'</p>

  <p>There was a moment of silence. Then Bryce leaned forward over the table
  and said with immense self-control: 'Now, look here, Grant. Flair's flair.
  And you're entitled to your whack of it. But when you take to throwing it
  about in chunks it becomes too much of a good thing. Have a little
  moderation, for Pete's sake. You've been dragging a river for a whole day
  yesterday trying to find a drowned man, and now you have the nerve to sit
  there and tell me you don't think he was drowned at all. What do you think he
  did? Walked away barefoot? Or hobbled away disguised as a one-legged man
  supported by crutches which he had tossed off in an idle moment from a couple
  of oak branches? Where do you think he went to? What is he going to live on
  from now on? Honestly, Grant, I think you must need a holiday. What, just
  tell me <i>what</i>, put this notion into your head? <i>How</i> does a
  trained detective mind jump from a straight-forward case of "missing believed
  drowned" into a wild piece of fantasy that has no connection with anything in
  the case at all?'</p>

  <p>Grant was silent.</p>

  <p>'Come on, Grant. I'm not ribbing you. I really want to know. How do you
  arrive at the conclusion that a man isn't drowned after finding his shoe in
  the river? How did the shoe get there?'</p>

  <p>'If I knew that, sir, I'd have my case.'</p>

  <p>'Did Searle have a spare pair of shoes with him?'</p>

  <p>'No. Just the ones he was wearing.'</p>

  <p>'The one that was found in the river.'</p>

  <p>'Yes, sir.'</p>

  <p>'And you still think he didn't drown?'</p>

  <p>'Yes.'</p>

  <p>There was a silence.</p>

  <p>'I don't know which to admire more, Grant: your nerve or your
  imagination.'</p>

  <p>Grant said nothing. There seemed to be nothing to say. He was bitterly
  aware that he had already said too much.</p>

  <p>'Can you think of any theory, however wild, that would fit your idea of
  his being alive?'</p>

  <p>'I can think of one. He could have been abducted, and the shoe tossed in
  the river as evidence of drowning.'</p>

  <p>Bryce regarded him with dramatised respect. 'You mistook your vocation,
  Grant. You're a very good detective, but as a writer of detective fiction
  you'd make a fortune.'</p>

  <p>'I was only answering your challenge and supplying a theory to fit the
  facts, sir,' Grant said mildly. 'I didn't say I believed in it.'</p>

  <p>This slowed Bryce down a little. 'Take them out of a hat like rabbits, do
  you. Theories in all sizes to fit any figure! No compulsion to buy! Walk up!
  Walk up!' He stopped and looked for a long moment at Grant's imperturbable
  face, sat slowly back in his chair, relaxed, and smiled. 'You damned
  poker-face, you!' he said amiably. He searched in his pocket for matches. 'Do
  you know what I envy about you, Grant? Your self-control. I'm always flying
  off the handle about something or other; and it doesn't do me or anyone else
  any good. My wife says that it is because I'm not sure of myself and I'm
  afraid I'm not going to get my way. She attended a course of six lectures on
  psychology at Morley College, and there is nothing about the human mind she
  doesn't know. I can only conclude that you must be damned sure of yourself
  behind that nice equable temper of yours.'</p>

  <p>'I don't know, sir,' Grant said, amused. 'I was anything but equable when
  I came in to report, and had nothing to show you but a situation that was
  exactly the same as it was when you handed it over to me four days ago.'</p>

  <p>'So you said: "How's the old man's rheumatism today? Is he approachable or
  do I go on all fours?"' His little elephant eyes twinkled for a moment.
  'Well, I suppose we present the Commissioner with your neat report of the
  facts as they exist, and leave him in ignorance of the finer flights of your
  imagination.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, yes, sir. I can't very well explain to the Commissioner that I have a
  feeling in the pit of my stomach.'</p>

  <p>'No. And if you'll take my advice, you'll stop paying so much attention to
  the rumblings of your stomach, and stick to what goes on in your head. There
  is a little phrase commonly used in police work that says, "in accordance
  with the evidence". You say that over six times a day as a grace before and
  after meals, and perhaps it will keep your feet on the ground and stop you
  ending up thinking you're Frederick the Great or a hedgehog or
  something.'</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch18"
     id="ch18"></a>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

  <p class="first">IN his schooldays Grant had learned that if he was stumped
  by a problem it paid to leave it alone for a while. A proposition that had
  seemed insoluble the night before was simple to the point of being obvious in
  the light of morning. This was a lesson that he learned for himself and
  consequently never forgot, and he took it with him both into his personal
  life and into his work. Whenever he reached deadlock he transferred his
  attention. So now, although he did not follow Bryce's advice about the daily
  ritual, he did give heed to his words about ignoring 'the rumblings of his
  stomach'. Where the Searle affair was concerned he had reached deadlock, so
  he withdrew his attention and thought upon Tom Thumb. The current Tom Thumb
  being an 'Arab' potentate who had lived at a Strand hotel for a fortnight,
  and had disappeared without the formality of paying his bill.</p>

  <p>The daily routine, a routine where there was always more work than men to
  do it, sucked him back into its vortex, and Salcott St Mary disappeared from
  the forefront of his mind.</p>

  <p>Then, on a morning six days later, his mind flung it back at him.</p>

  <p>He was walking along the south pavement of the Strand on his way to lunch
  in Maiden Lane, pleased with the report that he was going to give Bryce when
  he went back to the Yard, and wondering idly at the large display of women's
  shoes in a street as unpopular with women as the Strand. The thought of
  women's shoes reminded him of Dora Siggins and the slippers she had bought
  for the dance, and he smiled a little to himself as he began to cross the
  street, remembering her vitality and her chatter and her friendly sharpness.
  She had nearly left the shoes behind after all, he remembered; even after
  missing a bus home in order to buy them. They had been lying on the seat
  because they wouldn't fit into her packed shopping bag, and he had had to
  point them out to her. An untidy parcel in cheap brown paper, with the
  heels&mdash;</p>

  <p>He stopped dead.</p>

  <p>A taxi driver, his face contorted with rage and fright, yelled something
  into his ear. Brakes screamed as a lorry came to a halt at his elbow. A
  policeman, hearing the yelling brakes and the protests, made slow but
  purposeful movements in his direction. But Grant did not wait. He flung
  himself against the next approaching taxi, wrenched the door open, and said
  'Scotland Yard and quick' to the driver.</p>

  <p>'Exhibitionist!' said the driver, and chugged away to the Embankment.</p>

  <p>But Grant did not hear him. His mind was busy on the old sucked-dry
  problem that suddenly seemed so new and exciting now that he had taken it out
  again. At the Yard he looked for Williams and when he had found him he said:
  'Williams, remember saying on the telephone that all your Wickham notes were
  good for was the wastepaper basket? And I said never to destroy notes.'</p>

  <p>'I remember,' Williams said. 'When I was in town picking up Benny Skoll
  and you were at Salcott dragging the river.'</p>

  <p>'You didn't by any chance take my advice, did you?'</p>

  <p>'Of course I took your advice, sir. I <i>always</i> take your advice.'</p>

  <p>'You have those notes somewhere?'</p>

  <p>'I have them right here in my desk.'</p>

  <p>'May I see them?'</p>

  <p>'Certainly, sir. Though I don't know if you can read them.'</p>

  <p>It was certainly not easy. When Williams wrote a report it was in a
  faultless schoolboy script, but when making notes for his own use he indulged
  in a hieroglyphic shorthand of his own.</p>

  <p>Grant flipped over the pages looking for what he wanted.</p>

  <p>'"The 9.30 Wickham to Crome",' he murmured. '"The 10.5 Crome to Wickham.
  The 10.15 Wickham to Crome." 'M. 'M. "Farm lane: old"&mdash;old <i>what</i>
  and child?'</p>

  <p>'Old labourer and child. I didn't detail what they had in the buses to
  start with. Just what they picked up on the road.'</p>

  <p>'Yes, yes; I know; I understand. "Long Leat crossroads." Where is
  that?'</p>

  <p>'It's a "green" place, a sort of common, on the outskirts of Wickham,
  where there's a collection of Fair stuff. A merry-go-round and things.'</p>

  <p>'I remember. "Two roundabout men, known." Is it "known"?'</p>

  <p>'Yes; known to the conductor personally from other journeys.'</p>

  <p>'"Woman going to Warren Farm, known." What comes after that,
  Williams?'</p>

  <p>Williams translated to him what came after that.</p>

  <p>Grant wondered what Williams would think if he flung his arms round him
  and embraced him, after the fashion of Association Footballers to successful
  goal shooters.</p>

  <p>'May I keep this for the moment?' he asked.</p>

  <p>He could keep it for good, Williams said. It wasn't likely to be much good
  now. Unless&mdash;unless, of course&mdash;</p>

  <p>Grant could see the dawning realisation that this sudden interest in his
  notes must come from more than academic curiosity on Grant's part; but he did
  not wait to answer the coming question. He went to see Bryce.</p>

  <p>'It's my belief,' Bryce said, glaring at him, 'that the lower ranks in
  this institution prolong hotel cases so that they can sit in the back room
  with the manager and be given drinks on the house.'</p>

  <p>Grant ignored his libellous pleasantry.</p>

  <p>'Is this a routine report before you sit down to a nice leisurely lunch,
  or have you something to tell me?'</p>

  <p>'I think I've got something that will please you, sir.'</p>

  <p>'It will have to be very good to please me today, as perhaps you've
  noticed.'</p>

  <p>'I've discovered that he had a passion for cherry brandy.'</p>

  <p>'<i>Very</i> interesting, I must say. <i>Fascinatingly</i> interesting!
  And what good do you think&mdash;' A wonderful thought suddenly brightened
  the bleak small eye. He looked at Grant, as one colleague to another.
  '<i>No!</i>' he said. '<i>Not</i> Hamburg Willy!'</p>

  <p>'Looks like it, sir. It has all the earmarks; and he'd make a very good
  Arab with that Jewish profile of his.'</p>

  <p>'Hamburg! Well, well! What did he get out of it that was worth the
  risk?'</p>

  <p>'Soft living for a fortnight; and some fun.'</p>

  <p>'It's going to be expensive fun. I suppose you've no idea where he can
  have skipped to?'</p>

  <p>'Well, I remembered that he has been living with Mabs Hankey, and Mabs is
  doing a turn at the Acacias in Nice this spring; so I spent most of the
  morning on the telephone and I find that our Willy, or what I take to be our
  Willy, is staying there as Monsieur Goujon. What I came to ask, sir, was if,
  now that it is routine, someone else could take over the extradition and all
  that and leave me free for a day or two to do something else.'</p>

  <p>'What do you want to do?'</p>

  <p>'I've got a new idea about the Searle case.'</p>

  <p>'Now, Grant!' Bryce said, in warning.</p>

  <p>'It's too new'&mdash;'and too silly,' he added to himself&mdash;'to talk
  about, but I would very much like to spend a little time on it and see if it
  works out, sir.'</p>

  <p>'Well, I suppose, after the cherry brandy, you think I can't very well
  refuse you.'</p>

  <p>'Thank you, sir.'</p>

  <p>'But if it doesn't look like panning out, I hope you'll drop it. There's
  plenty of work right here without you running after rainbows and pots of
  gold.'</p>

  <p>So Grant walked out of the Superintendent's room in pursuit of his pot of
  gold, and the first thing he did was to go to his own room and take out the
  report that the San Francisco police had sent them about Searle. He studied
  it for a long time, and then sent a polite request to the police of Jobling,
  Conn.</p>

  <p>Then he remembered that he had not yet had lunch. He wanted quiet in which
  to think, so he put the precious sheet of paper into his wallet and went out
  to his favourite pub, where the rush would be over and they would manage to
  scrape up something for him. He still did not know what in that account of
  Searle's life in America had rung a bell in his mind when he had first read
  it. But he was beginning to have an idea as to what <i>kind</i> of thing it
  was that had rung that bell.</p>

  <p>As he was walking out of the pub after lunch he knew what it might have
  been.</p>

  <p>He went back to the Yard and consulted a reference book.</p>

  <p>Yes, it was that.</p>

  <p>He took out the San Francisco report and compared it with the entry in the
  reference book.</p>

  <p>He was jubilant.</p>

  <p>He had the important thing. The thing he needed to stand on. He had the
  connection between Searle and Walter Whitmore.</p>

  <p>He rang up Marta Hallard, and was told that she was rehearsing for
  <i>Faint Heart</i>. She would be at the Criterion this afternoon.</p>

  <p>Feeling ridiculously like a bubble&mdash;so help me, you could bounce me
  like a ball, he thought&mdash;he floated up to Piccadilly Circus. I feel just
  the way Tommy Thrupp looked last Sunday morning, he thought. Twice as large
  as life, with lightning shooting out of my head like toasting-forks.</p>

  <p>But the Criterion in the throes of a rehearsal afternoon soon reduced him
  to life-size and brought his feet back on to the ground.</p>

  <p>He walked in through the foyer, stepped over the symbolical barrier of a
  draped cord, and went down the stairs into the earth without interference
  from anyone. Perhaps they think I look like an author, he thought, and
  wondered who had written <i>Faint Heart</i>. No one ever did know who had
  written a play. Playwrights must lead blighted lives. Fifty to one, on an
  actuary's reckoning, against their play running more than three weeks; and
  then no one even noticed their name on the programme.</p>

  <p>And something like a thousand to one against any play ever getting as far
  as rehearsals even. He wondered whether the author of <i>Faint Heart</i> was
  aware that he was one in a thousand, or whether he was just sure of it.</p>

  <p>Somewhere in the bowels of the earth he came on the elegant little box
  that was the Criterion's auditorium; a little ghostly in the cold light of
  unshaded electrics, but reticent and well-bred. Various dim shapes lay about
  in the stalls, and no one made any move to ask his business.</p>

  <p>Marta, alone on the stage with a horse-hair sofa and a scared-looking
  young man, was saying: 'But I <i>must</i> lie on the sofa, Bobby darling.
  It's a waste of my legs if I just sit. Everyone looks the same from the knees
  down.'</p>

  <p>'Yes, Marta, you are right, of course,' said Bobby, who was the dim figure
  prowling up and down in front of the orchestra pit.</p>

  <p>'I don't want to alter your conception in any way, Bobby, but I do
  think&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Yes, Marta dear, you are right, of course, so right. No, of course it
  won't make any difference. No, I assure you. It really is all right. It'll
  look grand.'</p>

  <p>'Of course it may be difficult for Nigel&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'No, Nigel can come round behind you before he says his line. Try it,
  Nigel, will you.'</p>

  <p>Marta draped herself over the horse-hair and the scared-looking boy went
  away and made his entrance. He made his entrance nine times. 'Well, it's
  coming,' Bobby said, letting him away with the ninth.</p>

  <p>Someone in the stalls went out and came back with cups of tea.</p>

  <p>Nigel said his line above the sofa, to the right of the sofa, to the left
  of the sofa, and without relation to the sofa at all.</p>

  <p>Someone came into the stalls and collected the empty cups.</p>

  <p>Grant moved over to a lonely lounger and asked: 'When do you think I shall
  be able to speak to Miss Hallard?'</p>

  <p>'<i>No one</i> will be able to speak to her if she has much more of Nigel
  today.'</p>

  <p>'I have very important business with her.'</p>

  <p>'You the clothes man?'</p>

  <p>Grant said that he was a personal friend of Miss Hallard's and must talk
  to her for a few moments. He wouldn't keep her longer than that.</p>

  <p>'Oh.' The dim figure crawled away and consulted with another. It was like
  some muffled ritual.</p>

  <p>The consulted one detached himself from the group of shadows to which he
  belonged and came over to Grant. He introduced himself as the stage-manager,
  and asked what exactly it was that Grant wanted. Grant said that at the very
  first opportunity would someone tell Miss Hallard that Alan Grant was here
  and wanted to speak to her for a moment.</p>

  <p>This worked; and during the next pause, the stage-manager crept on to the
  stage and bending apologetically over Marta murmured something in a
  wood-pigeon undertone.</p>

  <p>Marta got up from the couch and came down to the edge of the stage,
  shading her eyes in an effort to see beyond the lights into the dark
  auditorium.</p>

  <p>'Are you there, Alan?' she said. 'Come through the pass door, will you?
  Show him where it is, someone.'</p>

  <p>She came to meet him at the pass door and was plainly glad to see him.
  'Come and have a cup of tea in the wings with me while the young lovers get
  on with it. Thank God that I shall never again have to be one of a pair of
  young lovers! The theatre's most boring convention. You've never come to
  rehearsal before, Alan! What moved you to it?'</p>

  <p>'I would like to say that it was intellectual curiosity, but I'm afraid it
  is just business. You can help me, I think.'</p>

  <p>She helped him enormously; and never once asked what these questions might
  mean.</p>

  <p>'We haven't had that dinner with your Sergeant Williams,' she said as she
  went away to make the young lovers look like amateurs and wish that they had
  gone on the land.</p>

  <p>'If you wait for a week or so, Sergeant Williams and I may have a story to
  tell you.'</p>

  <p>'Splendid. I've earned it, I feel. I've been so good and discreet.'</p>

  <p>'You've been wonderful,' he said, and went away out the back way into the
  lane with a slight recurrence of the jubilation that had floated him down the
  stairs at his entrance.</p>

  <p>Armed with the information Marta had given him, he went to Cadogan Gardens
  and interviewed the housekeeper of some furnished flats.</p>

  <p>'Oh, yes, I remember,' she said. 'They ran about a lot together. Oh, no,
  she didn't stay here. These are bachelor flats; I mean, flats for one. But
  she was around a lot.'</p>

  <p>And by that time London was shutting up shop for the night and there was
  nothing more he could do until the police of Jobling, Conn., supplied him
  with the information he had asked for. So he went home early for once, had a
  light supper, and went to bed. He lay for a long time working it out in his
  mind. Working out the details. Working out the wherefore.</p>

  <p>Toby Tullis had wanted to know what made Leslie Searle tick; and Grant,
  too, lying with his eyes on the ceiling, unmoving for an hour at a time, was
  looking for the mainspring of Leslie Searle's mind.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ch19"
     id="ch19"></a>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

  <p class="first">IT was forty-eight hours before word came from Jobling,
  Conn., and half a dozen times in those forty-eight hours Grant was on the
  brink of going to that woman in Hampstead and dragging the truth from her by
  main force. But he restrained himself. He would deal with her presently. Her
  lies would be neatly laid out on a plate, and presented to her when the time
  came.</p>

  <p>He would wait for that report.</p>

  <p>And the report when it came proved worth waiting for.</p>

  <p>Grant read it through in one swift eye movement, and then he sat back and
  laughed.</p>

  <p>'If anyone wants me for the rest of the day,' he said to Sergeant
  Williams, 'I'll be at Somerset House.'</p>

  <p>'Yes, sir,' Williams said, subdued.</p>

  <p>Grant glanced at Williams's unwontedly sober features&mdash;Williams was a
  little hurt that Grant was playing a lone hand over this&mdash;and was
  reminded of something.</p>

  <p>'By the way, Williams, Miss Hallard is very anxious to meet you. She has
  asked me if I would bring you to dinner one night.'</p>

  <p>'Me?' said Williams going pink. 'What on earth for?'</p>

  <p>'She has fallen a victim to your reported charms. She asked me to arrange
  a night when you were free. I feel in my bones this morning that by Saturday
  both you and I will be in a state for celebration; and it would be
  appropriate if we celebrated with Marta, I think. Saturday any good to
  you?'</p>

  <p>'Well, Nora and I usually go to the movies on Saturday, but when I'm on
  duty she goes with Jen. That's her sister. So I don't see why she shouldn't
  go with Jen this week.'</p>

  <p>'When she hears that you are going to dine with Marta Hallard she'll
  probably start divorce proceedings.'</p>

  <p>'Not her. She'll wait up for me so that she can ask me what Marta Hallard
  was wearing,' said Williams, the Benedict.</p>

  <p>Grant rang to ask Marta if he could bring Sergeant Williams to meet her on
  Saturday night, and then went away and buried himself in Somerset House.</p>

  <p>And that night he did not lie awake. He was like a child that goes to
  sleep because that way it will quickly be tomorrow. Tomorrow, the one small
  piece would fall into place and make the pattern whole.</p>

  <p>If the one small piece happened not to fit, of course, then the whole
  picture was wrong. But he was pretty sure that it would fit.</p>

  <p>In the short interval between putting out the lamp and falling asleep he
  ranged sleepily over the 'field'. When that one small piece fell into place
  tomorrow, life would be a great deal happier for a great many people. For
  Walter, naturally; Walter would have the shadow of suspicion lifted from him.
  For Emma Garrowby, with her Liz made safe. For Liz? Relief unspeakable for
  Liz. And relief for Miss Fitch&mdash;who might, he suspected, be a little
  sad, too. But she could always put it in a book. In a book was where the
  thing belonged.</p>

  <p>Toby would have quite special reasons for self-congratulation, Grant
  thought; and laughed. And Serge Ratoff would be comforted.</p>

  <p>Silas Weekley would not care at all.</p>

  <p>He remembered that Marta had remarked on how 'nice' Leslie and Liz had
  been together. ('A natural pair,' she said&mdash;but she could never have
  guessed <i>how</i> natural!) Was it just possible that Liz would be hurt when
  that one small piece fell into place tomorrow? He hoped not. He liked Liz
  Garrowby. He would like to think that Searle had meant nothing to her. That
  she would find nothing but happiness and relief in the vindication of her
  Walter.</p>

  <p>What was it Marta had said? 'I don't think Walter knows anything about
  Liz, and I have an idea that Leslie Searle knew quite a lot.' (Surprising,
  how Marta had seen that without any clue to the source of Searle's
  understanding.) But it did not matter very much, Grant thought, that Walter
  did not know very much about Liz. Liz, he was quite sure, knew all that was
  to be known about Walter; and that was a very good basis for a happy married
  life.</p>

  <p>He fell asleep wondering if being married to someone as nice and
  intelligent and lovable as Liz Garrowby would compensate a man for the loss
  of his freedom.</p>

  <p>A procession of his loves&mdash;romantic devotions most of
  them&mdash;trailed away into the distance as his mind blurred into
  unconsciousness.</p>

  <p>But in the morning he had thought for only one woman. That woman in
  Hampstead.</p>

  <p>Never, even at his most callow, had he gone to see any woman with an
  eagerness as great as the one that was taking him to Holly Pavement this
  morning. And he was a little shocked as he got off the bus and walked towards
  the Holly Pavement turning to find that his heart was thumping. It was a very
  long time indeed since Grant's heart had thumped for any but a purely
  physical reason.</p>

  <p>Damn the woman, he thought, damn the woman.</p>

  <p>Holly Pavement was a backwater filled with sunlight; a place so quiet that
  the strutting pigeons seemed almost rowdy. Number nine was a two-storey
  house, and the upper storey had been apparently converted into a studio.
  There were two push-buttons on the bell plaque with neat wooden labels
  alongside. 'Miss Lee Searle', said the upper one; 'Nat Gansage: Accessories',
  said the lower.</p>

  <p>Wondering what 'accessories' were, Grant pressed the upper button, and
  presently heard her coming down the wooden stairs to the door. The door
  opened, and she was standing there.</p>

  <p>'Miss Searle?' he heard himself say.</p>

  <p>'Yes,' she said, waiting there in the sunlight, unperturbed but
  puzzled.</p>

  <p>'I am Detective-Inspector Grant of the C.I.D.' Her puzzlement deepened at
  that, he noticed. 'A colleague of mine, Sergeant Williams, came to see you in
  my stead a week ago because I was otherwise engaged. I would like very much
  to talk to you myself, if it is convenient.'</p>

  <p>And it had better be convenient, blast you, he said in his mind; furious
  at his racing heart.</p>

  <p>'Yes, of course,' she said equably. 'Come in, won't you. I live
  upstairs.'</p>

  <p>She shut the door behind him and then led him up the wooden stairs to her
  studio. A strong smell of coffee&mdash;good coffee&mdash;pervaded the place
  and as she led him in she said: 'I've just been having my breakfast. I have
  made a bargain with the paper boy that he should leave a roll for me every
  morning with the paper, and that is my breakfast. But there is lots of
  coffee. Will you have some, Inspector?'</p>

  <p>They said at the Yard that Grant had two weaknesses: coffee, and coffee.
  And it smelt wonderful. But he wasn't going to drink anything with Lee
  Searle.</p>

  <p>'Thank you, but I have just had mine.'</p>

  <p>She poured another cup for herself, and he noticed that her hand was quite
  steady. Damn the woman, he was beginning to admire her. As a colleague she
  would be wonderful.</p>

  <p>She was a tall woman, and spare; very good-looking in her bony fashion and
  still quite young. She wore her hair in a thick plait, coronet-wise. The long
  housecoat she was wearing was made of some dull green stuff, rather like one
  Marta had; and she had the long legs that helped to give Marta her
  elegance.</p>

  <p>'Your resemblance to Leslie Searle is remarkable,' he said.</p>

  <p>'So we have been told,' she said shortly.</p>

  <p>He moved round the room to look at the Scottish pictures that were still
  propped up on view. They were orthodox impressions of orthodox scenes, but
  they were painted with a savage confidence, a fury, so that they shouted at
  one from the canvas. They didn't present themselves to one, they attacked.
  'Look, I'm Suilven!' shouted Suilven, looking odder and more individual than
  even that mountain had ever looked. The Cooling, a grape-blue rampart against
  a pale morning sky, were a whole barrier of arrogance. Even the calm waters
  of Kishorn were insolent.</p>

  <p>'Did it stay fine for you?' Grant asked, and then, feeling that that was
  too impudent, added: 'The West of Scotland is very wet.'</p>

  <p>'Not at this time of year. This is the best time.'</p>

  <p>'Did you find the hotels comfortable? I hear they are apt to be
  primitive.'</p>

  <p>'I didn't trouble the hotels. I camped out in my car.'</p>

  <p>Neat, he thought. Very neat.</p>

  <p>'What was it you wanted to talk to me about?'</p>

  <p>But he was in no hurry. She had caused him a lot of trouble, this woman.
  He would take his time.</p>

  <p>He moved from the pictures to the rows of books on the shelves, and
  considered the titles.</p>

  <p>'You have a liking for oddities, I see.'</p>

  <p>'Oddities?'</p>

  <p>'Poltergeists. Showers of fish. Stigmata. That sort of thing.'</p>

  <p>'I think all artists are attracted by the odd, whatever their medium,
  don't you?'</p>

  <p>'You don't seem to have anything on transvestism.'</p>

  <p>'What made you think of that?'</p>

  <p>'Then you know the term?'</p>

  <p>'Of course.'</p>

  <p>'It is something that doesn't interest you?'</p>

  <p>'The literature of the subject is very unsatisfactory, I understand.
  Nothing between learned pamphlets and <i>News of the World</i>.'</p>

  <p>'You ought to write a treatise on the subject.'</p>

  <p>'<i>I</i>?'</p>

  <p>'You like oddities,' he said smoothly.</p>

  <p>'I am a painter, Inspector, not a writer. Besides, no one is interested
  nowadays in female pirates.'</p>

  <p>'Pirates?'</p>

  <p>'They were all pirates or soldiers or sailors, weren't they?'</p>

  <p>'You think the fashion went out with Phoebe Hessel? Oh, by no means. The
  thing is continually turning up. Only the other day a woman died in
  Gloucestershire who had worked for more than twenty years hauling timber and
  coal, and even the doctor who attended her in her last illness had no idea
  that she was not a man. I knew a case personally, not long ago. A young man
  was charged in a London suburb with theft. Quite a normal popular young man.
  Played a good game of billiards, belonged to a men's club, and was walking
  out with one of the local beauties. But when medically examined he turned out
  to be quite a normal young woman. It happens somewhere or other every year or
  two. Glasgow. Chicago. Dundee. In Dundee a young woman shared a lodging-house
  ward with ten men and was never questioned. Am I boring you?'</p>

  <p>'Not at all. I was only wondering whether you considered them oddities in
  the sense that stigmata and poltergeists are.'</p>

  <p>'No; oh, no. Some, of course, are genuinely happier in men's things; but a
  great many do it from love of adventure, and a few from economic necessity.
  And some because it is the only way in which they can work out their
  schemes.'</p>

  <p>She sipped her coffee with polite interest, as one indulging an uninvited
  guest until he should reach the point of stating what he had come for.</p>

  <p>Yes, he thought, she would make a wonderful ally.</p>

  <p>His heart had slowed down to its proper rate. These were moves in a game
  that he had been playing a long time; the game of mind against mind. And now
  he was interested in her reaction to his moves. She had withstood
  undermining. How would she stand up to direct attack?</p>

  <p>He came away from the bookshelves and said: 'You were very devoted to your
  cousin, Miss Searle.'</p>

  <p>'Leslie? But I have already&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'No. Marguerite Merriam.'</p>

  <p>'Mar&mdash;. I don't know what you are talking about.'</p>

  <p>That was a mistake. If she had stopped to think for a moment, she would
  have realised that there was no reason at all to deny the connection with
  Marguerite. But the unexpectedness of that name on his lips had startled her,
  and she had fallen headlong.</p>

  <p>'So devoted that you couldn't think quite straight about her.'</p>

  <p>'I tell you&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'No, don't tell me anything. I'll tell you something. Something that ought
  to make confidences between us quite easy, Miss Searle. I encountered Leslie
  Searle at a party in Bloomsbury. One of those literary gatherings. He wanted
  to be introduced to Lavinia Fitch and I agreed to present him. As we pushed
  through the crowd we were flung together at very close quarters; in fact it
  was breathing-room only. A policeman is trained to observe, but I think even
  without that I would have noticed any variation in detail that was presented
  to me at that range. He had very fine grey eyes, Leslie Searle, and there was
  a small brown fleck in the iris of the left one. I have lately spent a good
  deal of time, and a great deal of labour and thought, trying to account for
  Leslie Searle's disappearance, and with native wit and considerable luck I
  got to the stage where I needed only one small thing to make my case
  complete. A small brown fleck. I found it on the doorstep down there.'</p>

  <p>There was complete silence. She was sitting with her coffee cup in her
  lap, looking down at it. The slow ticking of a wall clock sounded loud and
  ponderous in the quiet.</p>

  <p>'It's an odd thing, sex,' Grant said. 'When you laughed with me, caught in
  the crush that day, I had a moment of being suddenly out of countenance.
  Disconcerted. The way a dog is sometimes when it is laughed at. I knew it had
  nothing to do with your laughing, and I could not think why else I should
  have been disconcerted. About 12.45 last Monday I began the process of
  realising why; and was nearly run over by a taxi in consequence.'</p>

  <p>She had looked up at this; and now she said in a kind of detached
  interest: 'Are you the star turn at Scotland Yard?'</p>

  <p>'Oh, no,' Grant assured her. 'I come in bundles.'</p>

  <p>'You don't talk like something out of a bundle. Not any bundles I've been
  acquainted with. And no one out of a bundle could have&mdash;could have found
  out what happened to Leslie Searle.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, I'm not responsible for that.'</p>

  <p>'No?&mdash;Who is, then?'</p>

  <p>'Dora Siggins.'</p>

  <p>'Dora&mdash;? Who is she?'</p>

  <p>'She left her shoes on the seat of my car. Tied up in a neat parcel. At
  the time they were just Dora Siggins's shoes tied up in a parcel. But at
  12.45 last Monday, right in the path of a taxi, they became a parcel of the
  required dimensions.'</p>

  <p>'What dimensions?'</p>

  <p>'The dimensions of that empty space in your photographic box. I did try a
  pair of Searle's shoes in that space&mdash;you must allow me so
  much&mdash;but you'll admit that no run-of-the-mill hard-working
  one-of-a-bundle detective would think up anything so outré as a parcel
  containing one pair of women's shoes and a coloured silk head-square. By the
  way, my sergeant's recorded description of the woman who joined the bus at
  that crossroads where the fair is, says: Loose gaberdine raincoat.'</p>

  <p>'Yes. My burberry is a reversible one.'</p>

  <p>'Was that part of the preparation too?'</p>

  <p>'No; I got it years ago, so that I could travel light. I could camp out in
  it, and go to afternoon tea with the inside out.'</p>

  <p>'It is a little galling to think that it was I who paved the way for this
  practical joke of yours by my anxiety to be helpful to the stranger within
  the gates. I'll let strangers stand after this.'</p>

  <p>'Is that how it seems to you?' she said slowly. 'A practical joke?'</p>

  <p>'Let us not quibble about terms. I don't know what you call it to
  yourself. What it actually is, is a practical joke of particular brutality. I
  take it that your plan was either to make a fool of Walter Whitmore or to
  leave him in the soup.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, no,' she said simply. 'I was going to kill him.'</p>

  <p>Her sincerity was so patent that this brought Grant up all standing.</p>

  <p>'Kill him?' he said, all attention and his flippancy gone.</p>

  <p>'It seemed to me that he shouldn't be allowed to go on living,' she said.
  She took her coffee cup off her lap to put it on the table, but her hand was
  shaking so much that she could not lift it.</p>

  <p>Grant moved over and took it from her, gently, and set it down.</p>

  <p>'You hated him because of what you imagined he had done to Marguerite
  Merriam,' he said, and she nodded. Her hands were clasped in her lap in a
  vain effort to keep them steady.</p>

  <p>He was silent for a moment or two, trying to get used to the idea that all
  the ingenuity that he had taken to be her slick exit from a masquerade had
  been in reality a planned get-out to murder.</p>

  <p>'And what made you change your mind?'</p>

  <p>'Well&mdash;oddly enough, the first small thing was something Walter said.
  It was one evening after Serge Ratoff had made a scene in the pub.'</p>

  <p>'Yes?'</p>

  <p>'Walter said that when one was as devoted as Serge was to anyone one
  ceased to be quite sane about it. That made me think a bit.' She paused. 'And
  then, I liked Liz. She wasn't at all what I had pictured. You see, I had
  pictured her as the girl who had stolen Walter from Marguerite. And the real
  Liz wasn't like that at all. That sort-of bewildered me a little. But the
  real thing that stopped me was&mdash;was that&mdash;that&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'You found out that the person you loved had never existed,' Grant said
  quietly.</p>

  <p>She caught her breath and said: 'I don't know how you could have guessed
  that.'</p>

  <p>'But that is what happened, isn't it?'</p>

  <p>'Yes. Yes, I found out&mdash; People didn't know that I had any connection
  with her, you see, and they talked quite unguardedly. Marta, especially.
  Marta Hallard. I went back with her one night after dinner. She told me
  things that&mdash;shocked me. I had always known that she was wild
  and&mdash;and headstrong&mdash;Marguerite, I mean&mdash;but one expects that
  of genius, and she seemed so&mdash;so vulnerable that one forgave&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Yes, I understand.'</p>

  <p>'But the Marguerite that Marta and those other people knew was someone I
  didn't know at all. Someone I wouldn't even have liked if&mdash;. I remember
  when I said that at least she <i>lived</i>, Marta said: "The trouble was that
  she didn't allow anyone else to. The suction she created," Marta said, "was
  so great that her neighbours were left in a vacuum. They either expired from
  suffocation or they were dashed to death against the nearest large object."
  So you see, I didn't feel like killing Walter any more. But I still hated him
  for leaving her. I couldn't forget that. That he had walked out on her and
  she had killed herself because of it. Oh, I know, I know!' she added, as she
  saw his interruption coming. 'It was not that she loved him so much. I know
  that now. But if he had stayed with her she would be alive today, alive, with
  her genius and her beauty and her gay loveliness. He might have
  waited&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Till she tired?' Grant supplied, more dryly than he had intended, and she
  winced.</p>

  <p>'It wouldn't have been long,' she said, with sad honesty.</p>

  <p>'May I change my mind and have some of that coffee after all?' Grant
  said.</p>

  <p>She looked at her uncontrolled hands and said: 'Will you pour it out?'</p>

  <p>She watched him as he poured, and said: 'You are a very strange
  policeman.'</p>

  <p>'As I said to Liz Garrowby when she made the same remark: It may be your
  idea of policemen that's strange.'</p>

  <p>'If I had had a sister like Liz how different my life would have been. I
  had no one but Marguerite. And when I heard that she had killed herself I
  suppose I just went a little crazy for a spell. How did you find out about
  Marguerite and me?'</p>

  <p>'The police in San Francisco sent us an account of you, and in it your
  mother's name was given as Mattson. After much too long an interval I
  remembered that in <i>Who's Who in the Theatre</i>, which I had been using
  one night to pass the time while I waited for a telephone call, Marguerite
  Merriam's mother was also given as a Mattson. And since I had been looking
  for some connection between you and Walter, it seemed that I might have found
  it if you and Marguerite were cousins.'</p>

  <p>'Yes. We were more. We were both only children. Our mothers were
  Norwegian, but one married in Britain and one in America. And then, when I
  was fifteen, my mother took me to England, and I met Marguerite for the first
  time. She was nearly a year older than me, but she seemed younger. Even then
  she was brilliant. Everything she did had a&mdash;a <i>shining</i> quality.
  We wrote to each other every week from then on, and every year until my
  parents died we came to England in the summer, and I saw her.'</p>

  <p>'How old were you when your parents died?'</p>

  <p>'They died in a flu epidemic when I was seventeen. I sold the pharmacy but
  kept the photographic side, because I liked it and was good at it. But I
  wanted to travel. To photograph the world and everything that was beautiful
  in it. So I took the car and went West. I wore pants in those days just
  because they were comfortable and cheap, and because when you are five feet
  ten you don't look your best in girlish things. I hadn't thought of using
  them as&mdash;as camouflage until one day when I was leaning over the engine
  of the car a man stopped and said: "Got a match, bud?" and I gave him a
  light; and he looked at me and nodded and said: "Thanks, bud," and went away
  without a second glance. That made me think. A girl alone is always having
  trouble&mdash;at least in the States she is&mdash;even a girl of five feet
  ten. And a girl has a more difficult time getting an "in" in a racket. So I
  tried it out for a little. And it worked. It worked like a dream. I began to
  make money on the Coast. First photographing people who wanted to be movie
  actors, and then photographing actors themselves. But every year I came to
  England for a little. As me. My name actually is Leslie, but mostly they
  called me Lee. <i>She</i> always called me Lee.'</p>

  <p>'So your passport is a woman's one.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, yes. It is only in the States that I am Leslie Searle. And not all
  the time there.'</p>

  <p>'And all you did before going to the Westmorland was to hop over to Paris,
  and lay the track of Leslie Searle in case anyone proved inquisitive.'</p>

  <p>'Yes. I've been in England for some time. But I didn't actually think I'd
  need that track. I meant to do away with Leslie Searle too. To find some
  joint end for Walter and him. So that it would not be apparent that it was
  murder.'</p>

  <p>'Whether it was murder or just, as it turned out, leaving Whitmore in the
  soup, it was a pretty expensive amusement, wasn't it?'</p>

  <p>'Expensive?'</p>

  <p>'One very paying photographer's business, one complete gent's outfit in
  very expensive suitings, and assorted luggage from the best makers. Which
  reminds me, you didn't steal a glove of Liz Garrowby's, did you?'</p>

  <p>'No, I stole a pair. Out of the car pocket. I hadn't thought of gloves,
  but I suddenly realised how convincing women's gloves are. If there is any
  doubt, I mean, as to your sex. They are almost as good as lipstick. You
  forgot my lipstick, by the way&mdash;in the little parcel. So I took that
  pair of Liz's. They wouldn't go on, of course, but I meant to carry them. I
  grabbed them in a hurry out of my collar drawer because Walter was coming
  along the passage calling to know if I was ready, and later I found that I
  had only one. Was the other one still there in the drawer?'</p>

  <p>'It was. With the most misleading results.'</p>

  <p>'Oh!' she said, and looked amused and human for the first time. She
  thought for a little and then said: 'Walter will never take Liz for granted
  again. That is one good thing I have done. It is poetic justice that it
  should have been a woman who did that. It was clever of you to guess that I
  was a woman just from the outside of a little parcel.'</p>

  <p>'You do me too much honour. It never even crossed my mind that you might
  be a woman. I merely thought that Leslie Searle had gone away disguised as a
  woman. I thought they were probably your things, and that he had gone to you.
  But the giving up of the whole of Searle's life and belongings puzzled me. He
  wouldn't do that unless he had another personality to step into. It was only
  then that I began to wonder whether Searle was masquerading and wasn't a man
  at all. It didn't seem as wild an idea as it might have, because I had so
  lately seen that case of arrest for theft that turned out so surprisingly. I
  had seen how easily it could be done. And then there was you. Staring me in
  the face, so to speak. A personality all ready for Searle to dissolve into. A
  personality who had most conveniently been painting in Scotland while Searle
  was fooling the intelligentsia in Orfordshire.' His glance went to the art
  display. 'Did you hire these for the occasion, or did you paint them?'</p>

  <p>'Oh, I painted them. I spend my summers in Europe painting.'</p>

  <p>'Ever been in Scotland?'</p>

  <p>'No.'</p>

  <p>'You must go and see it sometime. It's grand. How did you know that
  Suilven had that "Look-at-me!" look?'</p>

  <p>'That is the way it looked on the postcard. Are you Scottish? Grant is a
  Scottish name, isn't it?'</p>

  <p>'A renegade Scot. My grandfather belonged to Strathspey.' He looked at the
  serried ranks of canvas evidence and smiled. 'As fine and wholesale and
  convincing an alibi as ever I saw.'</p>

  <p>'I don't know,' she said, doubtfully, considering them. 'I think to
  another painter they might be far more of a confession. They're
  so&mdash;arrogantly destructive. And angry. Aren't they. I would paint them
  all differently today now that I have known Liz, and&mdash;grown up, and
  Marguerite has died in my heart as well as in reality. It is very growing-up
  to find that someone you loved all your life never existed at all. Are you
  married, Inspector?'</p>

  <p>'No. Why?'</p>

  <p>'I don't know,' she said vaguely. 'I just wondered how you understood so
  quickly about what had happened to me over Marguerite. And I suppose one
  expects married people to be more sympathetic to emotional vagaries. Which is
  quite absurd, because they are normally far too cluttered up with their own
  emotional problems to have spare sympathy. It is the unattached person
  who&mdash;who helps. Won't you have some more coffee?'</p>

  <p>'You make coffee even better than you paint.'</p>

  <p>'You haven't come to arrest me, or you wouldn't be drinking my
  coffee.'</p>

  <p>'Quite right. I wouldn't. I wouldn't even drink the coffee of a practical
  joker.'</p>

  <p>'But you don't mind drinking with a woman who planned long and elaborately
  to kill someone?'</p>

  <p>'And changed her mind. There are quite a few people I would willingly have
  killed in my time. Indeed, with prison no more penitential than a not very
  good public school, and the death sentence on the point of being abolished, I
  think I'll make a little list, <i>á la</i> Gilbert. Then when I grow a little
  aged I shall make a total sweep&mdash;ten or so for the price of
  one&mdash;and retire comfortably to be well cared-for for the rest of my
  life.'</p>

  <p>'You are very kind,' she said irrelevantly. 'I haven't really committed
  any crime,' she said presently, 'so they can't prosecute me for anything, can
  they?'</p>

  <p>'My dear Miss Searle, you have committed practically every known crime in
  the book. The worst and most unforgivable being to waste the time of the
  overworked police forces of this country.'</p>

  <p>'But that isn't a crime, is it? That is what the police are there for. I
  don't mean: to have their time wasted, but to make sure that there has been
  nothing fishy about a happening. There isn't any law that can punish one for
  what you have called a practical joke, surely?'</p>

  <p>'There is always "breach of the peace". It is quite wonderful what a
  variety of things can be induced to come under the heading of breach of the
  peace.'</p>

  <p>'And what happens when you breach the peace?'</p>

  <p>'You are treated to a little homily and fined.'</p>

  <p>'Fined!'</p>

  <p>'A quite inappropriate sum, more often than not.'</p>

  <p>'Then I shan't be sent to prison?'</p>

  <p>'Not unless you have done something that I don't yet know about. And I
  wouldn't put it past you, as they say in Strathspey.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, no,' she said. 'No. You really do know all about me. I don't know how
  you know all you do, if it comes to that.'</p>

  <p>'Our policemen are wonderful. Hadn't you heard?'</p>

  <p>'You must have been pretty sure that you knew all about me before you came
  looking for that brown fleck in my iris.'</p>

  <p>'Yes. Your policemen are wonderful too. They looked up the births in
  Jobling, Conn., for me. The infant that Mr and Mrs Durfey Searle took with
  them when they left Jobling for points south, was, they reported, female.
  After that I would have been surprised to death if there had been no brown
  fleck.'</p>

  <p>'So you ganged up on me.' Her hands had stopped shaking, he noticed. He
  was glad that she had reached the stage of achieving a flippancy. 'Are you
  going to take me away with you now?'</p>

  <p>'On the contrary. This is my farewell to you.'</p>

  <p>'Farewell? You can't have come to take farewell of someone you don't
  know.'</p>

  <p>'Where our mutual acquaintance is concerned I, as they say, have the
  advantage of you. I may be quite new to you&mdash;or practically
  new&mdash;but you have been in my hair for the last fourteen days, and I
  shall be very glad to get you out.'</p>

  <p>'Then you don't take me to a police station or anything like that?'</p>

  <p>'No. Not unless you show any signs of beating it out of the country. In
  which case an officer would no doubt appear at your elbow with a pressing
  invitation to remain.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, I'm not going to run away. I am truly sorry for what I have done. I
  mean, for the trouble&mdash;and I suppose the&mdash;the misery I have
  caused.'</p>

  <p>'Yes. Misery is the appropriate word, I feel.'</p>

  <p>'I am sorry most of all for what Liz must have suffered.'</p>

  <p>'It was gratuitously wicked of you to stage that quarrel at the Swan,
  wasn't it?'</p>

  <p>'Yes. Yes, it was unforgivable. But he maddened me so. He was so smug. So
  unconsciously smug. Everything had always been easy for him.' She saw the
  comment in his face, and protested: 'Yes, even Marguerite's death! He went
  straight from that into Liz's arms. He never really knew desolation. Or fear.
  Or despair. Or any of the big, <i>grinding</i> things in life. He was quite
  convinced that nothing irretrievable would ever happen to him. If his
  "Marguerite" died there would always be a "Liz" there. I <i>wanted</i> him to
  suffer. To be caught in something that he couldn't get out of. To meet
  trouble and for once be stuck with it. And you can't say I wasn't right!
  He'll never be so smug again. Will he? Will he, then!'</p>

  <p>'No, I suppose not. Indeed, I'm sure not.'</p>

  <p>'I'm sorry Liz had to be hurt. I would go to prison if I could undo that.
  But I've given her a much better Walter than the one she was going to marry.
  She really is in love with that poor egotistical wretch of a creature, you
  know. Well, I've made him over for her. I'll be surprised if he isn't a new
  man from now on.'</p>

  <p>'If I don't go, you'll be proving to me that you are a public benefactor
  instead of an offender under breach-of-the-peace.'</p>

  <p>'What happens to me now? Do I just sit and wait?'</p>

  <p>'A constable will no doubt serve you solemnly with a summons to appear at
  a magistrate's court. Have you a lawyer, by the way?'</p>

  <p>'Yes, I have an old man in a funny little office who keeps my letters till
  I want them. He's called Bing, Parry, Parry, and Bing, but I don't think he
  is any of them, actually.'</p>

  <p>'Then you had better go and see him and tell him what you have done.'</p>

  <p>'All of it?'</p>

  <p>'The relevant bits. You can probably leave out the quarrel at the Swan,
  and anything else that you're particularly ashamed of.' She reacted to that,
  he noticed. 'But don't leave out too much. Lawyers like to know; and they are
  almost as unshockable as the police.'</p>

  <p>'Have I shocked you, Inspector?'</p>

  <p>'Not noticeably. You've been a pleasant change from the armed robberies
  and the blackmail and the confidence tricks.'</p>

  <p>'Shall I see you when I am charged?'</p>

  <p>'No. A lowly sergeant will be there to give evidence, I expect.'</p>

  <p>He took his hat and prepared to go, looking once more at the one-man show
  of the West Highlands.</p>

  <p>'I really ought to take a picture with me as a souvenir,' he said.</p>

  <p>'You can have any one you want. They are going to be obliterated anyhow.
  Which would you like?' It was obvious that she did not quite know whether he
  was serious or not.</p>

  <p>'I don't know. I like Kishorn, but I can't remember Kishorn being as
  aggressive as that. And if I took the Cooling there would be no room for me
  in the room too.'</p>

  <p>'But it's only thirty inches by&mdash;' she was beginning, and then
  understood. 'Oh. I see. Yes, it is intrusive.'</p>

  <p>'I don't think I have time to wait and choose. I must leave it, I'm
  afraid. But thank you for the offer.'</p>

  <p>'Come back one day when you have more time and choose at your leisure,'
  she said.</p>

  <p>'Thank you. I may do that.'</p>

  <p>'When the court has made an honest woman of me.' She went to the stairs
  with him. 'It's a bit of an anti-climax, isn't it? To set out to kill someone
  and end with breach of the peace.'</p>

  <p>The detachment in this caught his attention, and he stood for a long
  moment looking at her. After a little he said, as one giving judgment:
  'You're cured.'</p>

  <p>'Yes, I'm cured,' she said sadly. 'I shall never be green again. It was
  lovely while it lasted.'</p>

  <p>'It's nice grown-up, too,' Grant said comfortingly, and went away down the
  stairs. When he opened the door he looked back to find that she was still
  there watching him. 'By the way,' he said, 'what are accessories?'</p>

  <p>'What? Oh!' She laughed a little. 'Belts and bibs and bows and brash
  little bouquets for women to put in their hair.'</p>

  <p>'Goodbye,' Grant said.</p>

  <p>'Goodbye, Detective-Inspector Grant. I am grateful to you.'</p>

  <p>He went away into the sunlight, at peace with the world.</p>

  <p>As he walked down to the bus stop a lovely mad notion came to him. He
  would ring up Marta and ask her if she wanted another woman for Saturday
  night, and she would say yes, bring anyone you would like, and he would bring
  them Lee Searle.</p>

  <p>But of course he could not do that. It would be sadly unbecoming in an
  officer of the Criminal Investigation Department; indicating a lightness of
  mind, a frivolity, that could only be described as deplorable in the
  circumstances. It was all very well for the Lee Searles of this world, people
  who had not yet quite grown up, to indulge their notions, but for adults, and
  sober adults at that, there were the convenances.</p>

  <p>And of course there were compensations. Life was entirely constructed of
  compensations.</p>

  <p>The fantastical was for adolescents; for adults there were adult joys.</p>

  <p>And no joy of his 'green' years had ever filled his breast with a more
  tingling anticipation than the thought of Superintendent Bryce's face when he
  made his report this morning.</p>

  <p>It was a glorious and utterly satisfying prospect.</p>

  <p>He could hardly wait.</p>
