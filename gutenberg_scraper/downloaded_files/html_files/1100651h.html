<h2>MORE THAN SOMEWHAT</h2>


<h3><a name="Breach_of_Promise" id="Breach_of_Promise">Breach of Promise</a></h3>
<p>One day a certain party by the name of Judge Goldfobber, who is a lawyer by
trade, sends word to me that he wishes me to call on him at his office in lower
Broadway, and while ordinarily I do not care for any part of lawyers, it
happens that Judge Goldfobber is a friend of mine, so I go to see him.</p>

<p>Of course Judge Goldfobber is not a judge, and never is a judge, and he is
100 to 1 in my line against ever being a judge, but he is called Judge because
it pleases him, and everybody always wishes to please Judge Goldfobber, as he
is one of the surest-footed lawyers in this town, and beats more tough beefs
for different citizens than seems possible. He is a wonderful hand for keeping
citizens from getting into the sneezer, and better than Houdini when it comes
to getting them out of the sneezer after they are in.</p>

<p>Personally, I never have any use for the professional services of Judge
Goldfobber, as I am a law-abiding citizen at all times, and am greatly opposed
to guys who violate the law, but I know the Judge from around and about for
many years. I know him from around and about the night clubs, and other
deadfalls, for Judge Goldfobber is such a guy as loves to mingle with the
public in these spots, as he picks up much law business there, and sometimes a
nice doll.</p>

<p>Well, when I call on Judge Goldfobber, he takes me into his private office
and wishes to know if I can think of a couple of deserving guys who are out of
employment, and who will like a job of work, and if so, Judge Goldfobber says,
he can offer them a first-class position.</p>

<p>'Of course,' Judge Goldfobber says, 'it is not steady employment, and in
fact it is nothing but piece-work, but the parties must be extremely reliable
parties, who can be depended on in a pinch. This is out-of-town work that
requires tact, and,' he says, 'some nerve.'</p>

<p>Well, I am about to tell Judge Goldfobber that I am no employment agent, and
go on about my business, because I can tell from the way he says the parties
must be parties who can be depended on in a pinch, that a pinch is apt to come
up on the job any minute, and I do not care to steer any friends of mine
against a pinch.</p>

<p>But as I get up to go, I look out of Judge Goldfobber's window, and I can
see Brooklyn in the distance beyond the river, and seeing Brooklyn I get to
thinking of certain parties over there that I figure must be suffering terribly
from the unemployment situation. I get to thinking of Harry the Horse, and
Spanish John and Little Isadore, and the reason I figure they must be suffering
from the unemployment situation is because if nobody is working and making any
money, there is nobody for them to rob, and if there is nobody for them to rob,
Harry the Horse and Spanish John and Little Isadore are just naturally bound to
be feeling the depression keenly.</p>

<p>Anyway, I finally mention the names of these parties to Judge Goldfobber,
and furthermore I speak well of their reliability in a pinch, and of their
nerve, although I cannot conscientiously recommend their tact, and Judge
Goldfobber is greatly delighted, as he often hears of Harry the Horse, and
Spanish John and Little Isadore.</p>

<p>He asks me for their addresses, but of course nobody knows exactly where
Harry the Horse and Spanish John and Little Isadore live, because they do not
live anywhere in particular. However, I tell him about a certain spot in
Clinton Street where he may be able to get track of them, and then I leave
Judge Goldfobber for fear he may wish me to take word to these parties, and if
there is anybody in this whole world I will not care to take word to, or to
have any truck with in any manner, shape, or form, it is Harry the Horse, and
Spanish John and Little Isadore.</p>

<p>Well, I do not hear anything more of the matter for several weeks, but one
evening when I am in Mindy's restaurant on Broadway enjoying a little cold
borscht, which is a most refreshing matter in hot weather such as is going on
at the time, who bobs up but Harry the Horse, and Spanish John and Little
Isadore, and I am so surprised to see them that some of my cold borscht goes
down the wrong way, and I almost choke to death.</p>

<p>However, they seem quite friendly, and in fact Harry the Horse pounds me on
the back to keep me from choking, and while he pounds so hard that he almost
caves in my spine, I consider it a most courteous action, and when I am able to
talk again, I say to him as follows:</p>

<p>'Well, Harry,' I say, 'it is a privilege and a pleasure to see you again,
and I hope and trust you will all join me in some cold borscht, which you will
find very nice, indeed.'</p>

<p>'No,' Harry says, 'we do not care for any cold borscht. We are looking for
Judge Goldfobber. Do you see Judge Goldfobber round and about lately?'</p>

<p>Well, the idea of Harry the Horse and Spanish John and Little Isadore
looking for Judge Goldfobber sounds somewhat alarming to me, and I figure maybe
the job Judge Goldfobber gives them turns out bad and they wish to take Judge
Goldfobber apart, but the next minute Harry says to me like this:</p>

<p>'By the way,' he says, 'we wish to thank you for the job of work you throw
our way. Maybe some day we will be able to do as much for you. It is a most
interesting job,' Harry says, 'and while you are snuffing your cold borscht I
will give you the details, so you will understand why we wish to see Judge
Goldfobber.'</p>

<p>It turns out [Harry the Horse says] that the job is not for Judge Goldfobber
personally, but for a client of his, and who is this client but Mr. Jabez
Tuesday, the rich millionaire, who owns the Tuesday string of one-arm joints
where many citizens go for food and wait on themselves. Judge Goldfobber comes
to see us in Brooklyn in person, and sends me to see Mr. Jabez Tuesday with a
letter of introduction, so Mr. Jabez Tuesday can explain what he wishes me to
do, because Judge Goldfobber is too smart a guy to be explaining such matters
to me himself.</p>

<p>In fact, for all I know maybe Judge Goldfobber is not aware of what Mr.
Jabez Tuesday wishes me to do, although I am willing to lay a little 6 to 5
that Judge Goldfobber does not think Mr. Jabez Tuesday wishes to hire me as a
cashier in any of his one-arm joints.</p>

<p>Anyway, I go to see Mr. Tuesday at a Fifth Avenue hotel where he makes his
home, and where he has a very swell layout of rooms, and I am by no means
impressed with Mr. Tuesday, as he hems and haws quite a bit before he tells me
the nature of the employment he has in mind for me. He is a little guy,
somewhat dried out, with a bald head, and a small mouser on his upper lip, and
he wears specs, and seems somewhat nervous.</p>

<p>Well, it takes him some time to get down to cases, and tell me what is
eating him, and what he wishes to do, and then it all sounds very simple,
indeed, and in fact it sounds so simple that I think Mr. Jabez Tuesday is a
little daffy when he tells me he will give me ten G's for the job.</p>

<p>What Mr. Tuesday wishes me to do is to get some letters that he personally
writes to a doll by the name of Miss Amelia Bodkin, who lives in a house just
outside Tarrytown, because it seems that Mr. Tuesday makes certain cracks in
these letters that he is now sorry for, such as speaking of love and marriage
and one thing and another to Miss Amelia Bodkin, and he is afraid she is going
to sue him for breach of promise...</p>

<p>'Such an idea will be very embarrassing to me,' Mr. Jabez Tuesday says, 'as
I am about to marry a party who is a member of one of the most high-toned
families in this country. It is true,' Mr. Tuesday says, 'that the Scarwater
family does not have as much money now as formerly, but there is no doubt about
its being very, very high-toned, and my fiancée, Miss Valerie Scarwater, is one
of the high-tonedest of them all. In fact,' he says, 'she is so high-toned that
the chances are she will be very huffy about anybody suing me for breach of
promise, and cancel everything.'</p>

<p>Well, I ask Mr. Tuesday what a breach of promise is, and he explains to me
that it is when somebody promises to do something and fails to do this
something, although of course we have a different name for a proposition of
this nature in Brooklyn, and deal with it accordingly.</p>

<p>'This is a very easy job for a person of your standing,' Mr. Tuesday says.
'Miss Amelia Bodkin lives all alone in her house the other side of Tarrytown,
except for a couple of servants, and they are old and harmless. Now the idea
is,' he says, 'you are not to go to her house as if you are looking for the
letters, but as if you are after something else, such as her silverware, which
is quite antique and very valuable.</p>

<p>'She keeps the letters in a big inlaid box in her room,' Mr. Tuesday says,
'and if you just pick up this box and carry it away along with the silverware,
no one will ever suspect that you are after the letters, but that you take the
box thinking it contains valuables. You bring the letters to me and get your
ten G's,' Mr. Tuesday says, 'and,' he says, 'you can keep the silverware, too.
Be sure you get a Paul Revere teapot with the silverware,' he says. 'It is
worth plenty.'</p>

<p>'Well,' I say to Mr. Tuesday, 'every guy knows his own business best, and I
do not wish to knock myself out of a nice soft job, but,' I say, 'it seems to
me the simplest way of carrying on this transaction is to buy the letters off
this doll, and be done with it. Personally,' I say, 'I do not believe there is
a doll in the world who is not willing to sell a whole post-office full of
letters for ten G's, especially in these times, and throw in a set of
Shakespeare with them.'</p>

<p>'No, no,' Mr. Tuesday says. 'Such a course will not do with Miss Amelia
Bodkin at all. You see,' he says, 'Miss Bodkin and I are very, very friendly
for a matter of maybe fifteen or sixteen years. In fact, we are very friendly,
indeed. She does not have any idea at this time that I wish to break off this
friendship with her. Now,' he says, 'if I try to buy the letters from her, she
may become suspicious. The idea,' Mr. Tuesday says, 'is for me to get the
letters first, and then explain to her about breaking off the friendship, and
make suitable arrangements with her afterwards.</p>

<p>'Do not get Miss Amelia Bodkin wrong,' Mr. Tuesday says. 'She is an
excellent person, but,' he says, 'you know the saying, "Hell hath no fury like
a woman scorned." And maybe Miss Amelia Bodkin may figure I am scorning her if
she finds out I am going to marry Miss Valerie Scarwater, and furthermore,' he
says, 'if she still has the letters she may fall into the hands of unscrupulous
lawyers, and demand a very large sum, indeed. But,' Mr. Tuesday says, 'this
does not worry me half as much as the idea that Miss Valerie Scarwater may
learn about the letters and get a wrong impression of my friendship with Miss
Amelia Bodkin.'</p>

<p>Well, I round up Spanish John and Little Isadore the next afternoon, and I
find Little Isadore playing klob with a guy by the name of Educated Edmund, who
is called Educated Edmund because he once goes to Erasmus High school and is
considered a very fine scholar, indeed, so I invite Educated Edmund to go along
with us. The idea is, I know Educated Edmund makes a fair living playing klob
with Little Isadore, and I figure as long as I am depriving Educated Edmund of
a living for awhile, it is only courteous to toss something else his way.
Furthermore, I figure as long as letters are involved in this proposition it
may be a good thing to have Educated Edmund handy in case any reading becomes
necessary, because Spanish John and Little Isadore do not read at all, and I
read only large print.</p>

<p>We borrow a car off a friend of mine in Clinton Street, and with me driving
we start for Tarrytown, which is a spot up the Hudson River, and it is a very
enjoyable ride for one and all on account of the scenery. It is the first time
Educated Edmund and Spanish John and Little Isadore ever see the scenery along
the Hudson although they all reside on the banks of this beautiful river for
several years at Ossining. Personally, I am never in Ossining, although once I
make Auburn, and once Comstock, but the scenery in these localities is nothing
to speak of.</p>

<p>We hit Tarrytown about dark, and follow the main drag through this burg, as
Mr. Tuesday tells me, until finally we come to the spot I am looking for, which
is a little white cottage on a slope of ground above the river, not far off the
highway. This little white cottage has quite a piece of ground around it, and a
low stone wall, with a driveway from the highway to the house, and when I spot
the gate to the driveway I make a quick turn, and what happens but I run the
car slapdab into a stone gatepost, and the car folds up like an accordion.</p>

<p>You see, the idea is we are figuring to make this a fast stick-up job
without any foolishness about it, maybe leaving any parties we come across tied
up good and tight while we make a getaway, as I am greatly opposed to
housebreaking, or sneak jobs, as I do not consider them dignified. Furthermore,
they take too much time, so I am going to run the car right up to the front
door when this stone post gets in my way.</p>

<p>The next thing I know, I open my eyes to find myself in a strange bed, and
also in a strange bedroom, and while I wake up in many a strange bed in my
time, I never wake up in such a strange bedroom as this. It is all very soft
and dainty, and the only jarring note in my surroundings is Spanish John
sitting beside the bed looking at me.</p>

<p>Naturally I wish to know what is what, and Spanish John says I am knocked
snoring in the collision with the gatepost, although none of the others are
hurt, and that while I am stretched in the driveway with the blood running out
of a bad gash in my noggin, who pops out of the house but a doll and an old guy
who seems to be a butler, or some such, and the doll insists on them lugging me
into the house, and placing me in this bedroom.</p>

<p>Then she washes the blood off of me, Spanish John says, and wraps my head up
and personally goes to Tarrytown to get a croaker to see if my wounds are
fatal, or what, while Educated Edmund and Little Isadore are trying to patch up
the car. So, Spanish John says, he is sitting there to watch me until she comes
back, although of course I know what he is really sitting there for is to get
first search at me in case I do not recover.</p>

<p>Well, while I am thinking all this over, and wondering what is to be done,
in pops a doll of maybe forty odd, who is built from the ground up, but who has
a nice, kind-looking pan, with a large smile, and behind her is a guy I can see
at once is a croaker, especially as he is packing a little black bag, and has a
grey goatee. I never see a nicer-looking doll if you care for middling-old
dolls, although personally I like them young, and when she sees me with my eyes
open, she speaks as follows:</p>

<p>'Oh,' she says, 'I am glad you are not dead, you poor chap. But,' she says,
'here is Doctor Diffingwell, and he will see how badly you are injured. My name
is Miss Amelia Bodkin, and this is my house, and this is my own bedroom, and I
am very, very sorry you are hurt.'</p>

<p>Well, naturally I consider this a most embarrassing situation, because here
I am out to clip Miss Amelia Bodkin of her letters and her silverware,
including her Paul Revere teapot, and there she is taking care of me in
first-class style, and saying she is sorry for me.</p>

<p>But there seems to be nothing for me to say at this time, so I hold still
while the croaker looks me over, and after he peeks at my noggin, and gives me
a good feel up and down, he states as follows:</p>

<p>'This is a very bad cut,' he says. 'I will have to stitch it up, and then he
must be very quiet for a few days, otherwise,' he says, 'complications may set
in. It is best to move him to a hospital at once.'</p>

<p>But Miss Amelia Bodkin will not listen to such an idea as moving me to a
hospital. Miss Amelia Bodkin says I must rest right where I am, and she will
take care of me, because she says I am injured on her premises by her gatepost,
and it is only fair that she does something for me. In fact, from the way Miss
Amelia Bodkin takes on about me being moved, I figure it is the old sex appeal,
although afterwards I find out it is only because she is lonesome, and nursing
me will give her something to do.</p>

<p>Well, naturally I am not opposing her idea, because the way I look at it, I
will be able to handle the situation about the letters, and also the
silverware, very nicely as an inside job, so I try to act even worse off than I
am, although of course anybody who knows about the time I carry eight slugs in
my body from Broadway and Fiftieth Street to Brooklyn will laugh very heartily
at the idea of a cut on the noggin keeping me in bed.</p>

<p>After the croaker gets through sewing me up, and goes away, I tell Spanish
John to take Educated Edmund and Little Isadore and go back to New York, but to
keep in touch with me by telephone, so I can tell them when to come back, and
then I go to sleep, because I seem to be very tired. When I wake up later in
the night, I seem to have a fever, and am really somewhat sick, and Miss Amelia
Bodkin is sitting beside my bed swabbing my noggin with a cool cloth, which
feels very pleasant, indeed.</p>

<p>I am better in the morning, and am able to knock over a little breakfast
which she brings to me on a tray, and I am commencing to see where being an
invalid is not so bad, at that, especially when there are no coppers at your
bedside every time you open your eyes asking who does it to you.</p>

<p>I can see Miss Amelia Bodkin gets quite a bang out of having somebody to
take care of, although of course if she knows who she is taking care of at this
time, the chances are she will be running up the road calling for the
gendarmes. It is not until after breakfast that I can get her to go and grab
herself a little sleep, and while she is away sleeping the old guy who seems to
be the butler is in and out of my room every now and then to see how I am
getting along.</p>

<p>He is a gabby old guy, and pretty soon he is telling me all about Miss
Amelia Bodkin, and what he tells me is that she is the oldtime sweetheart of a
guy in New York who is at the head of a big business, and very rich, and of
course I know this guy is Mr. Jabez Tuesday, although the old guy who seems to
be the butler never mentions his name.</p>

<p>'They are together many years,' he says to me. 'He is very poor when they
meet, and she has a little money, and establishes him in business, and by her
management of this business, and of him, she makes it a very large business,
indeed. I know, because I am with them almost from the start,' the old guy
says. 'She is very smart in business, and also very kind, and nice, if anybody
asks you.'</p>

<p>'Now,' the old guy says, 'I am never able to figure out why they do not get
married, because there is no doubt she loves him, and he loves her, but Miss
Amelia Bodkin once tells me that it is because they are too poor at the start,
and too busy later on to think of such things as getting married, and so they
drift along the way they are, until all of a sudden he is rich. Then,' the old
guy says, 'I can see he is getting away from her, although she never sees it
herself, and I am not surprised when a few years ago he convinces her it is
best for her to retire from active work, and move out to this spot.'</p>

<p>'He comes out here fairly often at first,' the old guy says, 'but gradually
he stretches the time between his visits, and now we do not see him once in a
coon's age. Well,' the old guy says, 'it is just such a case as often comes up
in life. In fact, I personally know of some others. But Miss Amelia Bodkin
still thinks he loves her, and that only business keeps him away so much, so
you can see she either is not as smart as she looks or is kidding herself.
Well,' the old guy says, 'I will now bring you a little orange-juice, although
I do not mind saying you do not look to me like a guy who drinks orange-juice
as a steady proposition.'</p>

<p>Now I am taking many a gander around the bedroom to see if I can case the
box of letters that Mr. Jabez Tuesday speaks of, but there is no box such as he
describes in sight. Then in the evening, When Miss Amelia Bodkin is in the
room, and I seem to be dozing, she pulls out a drawer in the bureau, and hauls
out a big inlaid box, and sits down at a table under a reading-lamp, and opens
this box and begins reading some old letters. And as she sits there reading
those letters, with me watching her through my eyelashes, sometimes she smiles,
but once I see little tears rolling down her cheeks.</p>

<p>All of a sudden she looks at me, and catches me with my eyes wide open, and
I can see her face turn red, and then she laughs, and speaks to me, as follows:
'Old love-letters,' she says, tapping the box. 'From my old sweetheart,' she
says. 'I read some of them every night of my life. Am I not foolish and
sentimental to do such a thing?'</p>

<p>Well, I tell Miss Amelia Bodkin she is sentimental all right, but I do not
tell her just how foolish she is to be letting me in on where she plants these
letters, although of course I am greatly pleased to have this information. I
tell Miss Amelia Bodkin that personally I never write a love-letter, and never
get a love-letter and in fact, while I hear of these propositions, I never even
see a love-letter before, and this is all as true as you are a foot high. Then
Miss Amelia Bodkin laughs a little, and says to me as follows:</p>

<p>'Why,' she says, 'you are a very unusual chap, indeed, not to know what a
love-letter is like. Why,' she says, 'I think I will read you a few of the most
wonderful love-letters in this world. It will do no harm,' she says, 'because
you do not know the writer, and you must lie there and think of me, not old and
ugly, as you see me now, but as young, and maybe a little bit pretty.'</p>

<p>So Miss Amelia Bodkin opens a letter and reads it to me, and her voice is
soft and low as she reads, but she scarcely ever looks at the letter as she is
reading, so I can see she knows it pretty much by heart. Furthermore, I can see
that she thinks this letter is quite a masterpiece, but while I am no judge of
love-letters, because this is the first one I ever hear, I wish to say I
consider it nothing but great nonsense.</p>

<p>'Sweetheart mine,' this love-letter says, 'I am still thinking of you as I
see you yesterday standing in front of the house with the sunlight turning your
dark brown hair to wonderful bronze. Darling,' it says, 'I love the colour of
your hair. I am so glad you are not a blonde. I hate blondes, they are so
empty-headed, and mean, and deceitful. Also they are bad-tempered,' the letter
says. 'I will never trust a blonde any farther than I can throw a bull by the
tail. I never see a blonde in my life who is not a plumb washout,' it says.
'Most of them are nothing but peroxide, anyway. Business is improving,' it
says. 'Sausage is going up. I love you now and always, my baby doll.'</p>

<p>Well, there are others worse than this, and all of them speak of her as
sweetheart, or baby, or darlingest one, and also as loveykins, and precious,
and angel, and I do not know what all else, and several of them speak of how
things will be after they marry, and as I judge these are Mr. Jabez Tuesday's
letters, all right, I can see where they are full of dynamite for a guy who is
figuring on taking a run-out powder on a doll. In fact, I say something to this
general effect to Miss Amelia Bodkin, just for something to say.</p>

<p>'Why,' she says, 'what do you mean?'</p>

<p>'Well,' I say, 'documents such as these are known to bring large prices
under certain conditions.'</p>

<p>Now Miss Amelia Bodkin looks at me a moment as if wondering what is in my
mind, and then she shakes her head as if she gives it up, and laughs and speaks
as follows:</p>

<p>'Well,' she says, 'one thing is certain, my letters will never bring a
price, no matter how large, under any conditions, even if anybody ever wants
them. Why,' she says, 'these are my greatest treasure. They are my memories of
my happiest days. Why,' she says, 'I will not part with these letters for a
million dollars.'</p>

<p>Naturally I can see from this remark that Mr. Jabez Tuesday makes a very
economical deal with me at ten G's for the letters, but of course I do not
mention this to Miss Amelia Bodkin as I watch her put her love-letters back in
the inlaid box, and put the box back in the drawer of the bureau. I thank her
for letting me hear the letters, and then I tell her good night, and I go to
sleep, and the next day I telephone to a certain number in Clinton Street and
leave word for Educated Edmund and Spanish John and Little Isadore to come and
get me, as I am tired of being an invalid.</p>

<p>Now the next day is Saturday, and the day that comes after is bound to be
Sunday, and they come to see me on Saturday, and promise to come back for me
Sunday, as the car is now unravelled and running all right, although my friend
in Clinton Street is beefing no little about the way his fenders are bent. But
before they arrive Sunday morning, who is there ahead of them bright and early
but Mr. Jabez Tuesday in a big town car.</p>

<p>Furthermore, as he walks into the house, all dressed up in a cutaway coat,
and a high hat, he grabs Miss Amelia Bodkin in his arms, and kisses her
ker-plump right on the smush, which information I afterwards receive from the
old guy who seems to be the butler. From upstairs I can personally hear Miss
Amelia Bodkin crying more than somewhat, and then I hear Mr Jabez Tuesday speak
in a loud, hearty voice as follows:</p>

<p>'Now, now, now, 'Mely,' Mr. Tuesday says. 'Do not be crying, especially on
my new white vest. Cheer up,' Mr. Tuesday says, 'and listen to the arrangements
I make for our wedding to-morrow, and our honeymoon in Montreal. Yes, indeed,
'Mely,' Mr. Tuesday says, 'you are the only one for me, because you understand
me from A to Izzard. Give me another big kiss, 'Mely, and let us sit down and
talk things over.'</p>

<p>Well, I judge from the sound that he gets his kiss, and it is a very large
kiss, indeed, with the cut-out open, and then I hear them chewing the rag at
great length in the living-room downstairs. Finally I hear Mr. Jabez Tuesday
speak as follows:</p>

<p>'You know, 'Mely,' he says, 'you and I are just plain ordinary folks without
any lugs, and,' he says, 'this is why we fit each other so well. I am sick and
tired of people who pretend to be high-toned and mighty, when they do not have
a white quarter to their name. They have no manners whatever. Why, only last
night,' Mr. Jabez Tuesday says, 'I am calling on a high-toned family in New
York by the name of Scarwater, and out of a clear sky I am grossly insulted by
the daughter of the house, and practically turned out in the street. I never
receive such treatment in my life,' he says. 'Mely,' he says, 'give me another
kiss, and see if you feel a bump here on my head'. Of course, Mr. Jabez Tuesday
is somewhat surprised to see me present later on, but he never lets on he knows
me, and naturally I do not give Mr. Jabez any tumble whatever at the moment,
and by and by Educated Edmund and Spanish John and Little Isadore come for me
in the car, and I thank Miss Amelia Bodkin for her kindness to me, and leave
her standing on the lawn with Mr. Jabez Tuesday waving us good-bye.</p>

<p>And Miss Amelia Bodkin looks so happy as she snuggles up close to Mr. Jabez
Tuesday that I am glad I take the chance, which is always better than an
even-money chance these days, that Miss Valeria Scarwater is a blonde, and send
Educated Edmund to her to read her Mr. Tuesday's letter in which he speaks of
blondes. But of course I am sorry that this and other letters that I tell
Educated Edmund to read to her heats her up so far as to make her forget she is
a lady and causes her to slug Mr. Jabez Tuesday on the bean with an 18-carat
vanity case, as she tells him to get out of her life.</p>

<p>So [Harry the Horse says] there is nothing more to the story, except we are
now looking for Judge Goldfobber to get him to take up a legal matter for us
with Mr. Jabez Tuesday. It is true Mr. Tuesday pays us the ten G's, but he
never lets us take the silverware he speaks of, not even the Paul Revere
teapot, which he says is so valuable, and in fact when we drop around to Miss
Amelia Bodkin's house to pick up these articles one night not long ago, the old
guy who seems to be the butler lets off a double-barrelled shotgun at us, and
acts very nasty in general.</p>

<p>So [Harry says] we are going to see if we can get Judge Goldfobber to sue
Mr. Jabez Tuesday for breach of promise.</p>


<h3><a name="Romance_in_the_Roaring_Forties" id="Romance_in_the_Roaring_Forties">Romance in the Roaring Forties</a></h3>
<p>Only a rank sucker will think of taking two peeks at Dave the Dude's doll,
because while Dave may stand for the first peek, figuring it is a mistake, it
is a sure thing he will get sored up at the second peek, and Dave the Dude is
certainly not a man to have sored up at you.</p>

<p>But this Waldo Winchester is one hundred per cent. sucker, which is why he
takes quite a number of peeks at Dave's doll. And what is more, she takes quite
a number of peeks right back at him. And there you are. When a guy and a doll
get to taking peeks back and forth at each other, why, there you are
indeed.</p>

<p>This Waldo Winchester is a nice-looking young guy who writes pieces about
Broadway for the <i>Morning Item</i>. He writes about the goings-on in night clubs,
such as fights, and one thing and another, and also about who is running around
with who, including guys and dolls.</p>

<p>Sometimes this is very embarrassing to people who may be married and are
running around with people who are not married, but of course Waldo Winchester
cannot be expected to ask one and all for their marriage certificates before he
writes his pieces for the paper.</p>

<p>The chances are if Waldo Winchester knows Miss Billy Perry is Dave the
Dude's doll, he will never take more than his first peek at her, but nobody
tips him off until his second or third peek, and by this time Miss Billy Perry
is taking her peeks back at him and Waldo Winchester is hooked.</p>

<p>In fact, he is plumb gone, and being a sucker, like I tell you, he does not
care whose doll she is. Personally, I do not blame him much, for Miss Billy
Perry is worth a few peeks, especially when she is out on the floor of Miss
Missouri Martin's Sixteen Hundred Club doing her tap dance. Still, I do not
think the best tap-dancer that ever lives can make me take two peeks at her if
I know she is Dave the Dude's doll, for Dave somehow thinks more than somewhat
of his dolls.</p>

<p>He especially thinks plenty of Miss Billy Perry, and sends her fur coats,
and diamond rings, and one thing and another, which she sends back to him at
once, because it seems she does not take presents from guys. This is considered
most surprising all along Broadway, but people figure the chances are she has
some other angle.</p>

<p>Anyway, this does not keep Dave the Dude from liking her just the same, and
so she is considered his doll by one and all, and is respected accordingly
until this Waldo Winchester comes along.</p>

<p>It happens that he comes along while Dave the Dude is off in the Modoc on a
little run down to the Bahamas to get some goods for his business, such as
Scotch and champagne, and by the time Dave gets back Miss Billy Perry and Waldo
Winchester are at the stage where they sit in corners between her numbers and
hold hands.</p>

<p>Of course nobody tells Dave the Dude about this, because they do not wish to
get him excited. Not even Miss Missouri Martin tells him, which is most unusual
because Miss Missouri Martin, who is sometimes called 'Mizzoo' for short, tells
everything she knows as soon as she knows it, which is very often before it
happens.</p>

<p>You see, the idea is when Dave the Dude is excited he may blow somebody's
brains out, and the chances are it will be nobody's brains but Waldo
Winchester's, although some claim that Waldo Winchester has no brains or he
will not be hanging around Dave the Dude's doll.</p>

<p>I know Dave is very, very fond of Miss Billy Perry, because I hear him talk
to her several times, and he is most polite to her and never gets out of line
in her company by using cuss words, or anything like this. Furthermore, one
night when One-eyed Solly Abrahams is a little stewed up he refers to Miss
Billy Perry as a broad, meaning no harm whatever, for this is the way many of
the boys speak of the dolls.</p>

<p>But right away Dave the Dude reaches across the table and bops One-eyed
Solly right in the mouth, so everybody knows from then on that Dave thinks well
of Miss Billy Perry. Of course Dave is always thinking fairly well of some doll
as far as this goes, but it is seldom he gets to bopping guys in the mouth over
them.</p>

<p>Well, one night what happens but Dave the Dude walks into the Sixteen
Hundred Club, and there in the entrance, what does he see but this Waldo
Winchester and Miss Billy Perry kissing each other back and forth friendly.
Right away Dave reaches for the old equalizer to shoot Waldo Winchester, but it
seems Dave does not happen to have the old equalizer with him, not expecting to
have to shoot anybody this particular evening.</p>

<p>So Dave the Dude walks over and, as Waldo Winchester hears him corning and
lets go his strangle-hold on Miss Billy Perry, Dave nails him with a big right
hand on the chin. I will say for Dave the Dude that he is a fair puncher with
his right hand, though his left is not so good, and he knocks Waldo Winchester
bow-legged. In fact, Waldo folds right up on the floor.</p>

<p>Well, Miss Billy Perry lets out a screech you can hear clear to the Battery
and runs over to where Waldo Winchester lights, and falls on top of him
squalling very loud. All anybody can make out of what she says is that Dave the
Dude is a big bum, although Dave is not so big, at that, and that she loves
Waldo Winchester.</p>

<p>Dave walks over and starts to give Waldo Winchester the leather, which is
considered customary in such cases, but he seems to change his mind, and
instead of booting Waldo around, Dave turns and walks out of the joint looking
very black and mad, and the next anybody hears of him he is over in the Chicken
Club doing plenty of drinking.</p>

<p>This is regarded as a very bad sign indeed, because while everybody goes to
the Chicken Club now and then to give Tony Berzola, the owner, a friendly play,
very few people care to do any drinking there, because Tony's liquor is not
meant for anybody to drink except the customers.</p>

<p>Well, Miss Billy Perry gets Waldo Winchester on his pegs again, and wipes
his chin off with her handkerchief, and by and by he is all okay except for a
big lump on his chin. And all the time she is telling Waldo Winchester what a
big bum Dave the Dude is, although afterwards Miss Missouri Martin gets hold of
Miss Billy Perry and puts the blast on her plenty for chasing a two-handed
spender such as Dave the Dude out of the joint.</p>

<p>'You are nothing but a little sap,' Miss Missouri Martin tells Miss Billy
Perry. 'You cannot get the right time off this newspaper guy, while everybody
knows Dave the Dude is a very fast man with a dollar.'</p>

<p>'But I love Mr. Winchester,' says Miss Billy Perry. 'He is so romantic. He
is not a bootlegger and a gunman like Dave the Dude. He puts lovely pieces in
the paper about me, and he is a gentleman at all times.'</p>

<p>Now of course Miss Missouri Martin is not in a position to argue about
gentlemen, because she meets very few in the Sixteen Hundred Club and anyway,
she does not wish to make Waldo Winchester mad as he is apt to turn around and
put pieces in his paper that will be a knock to the joint, so she lets the
matter drop.</p>

<p>Miss Billy Perry and Waldo Winchester go on holding hands between her
numbers, and maybe kissing each other now and then, as young people are liable
to do, and Dave the Dude plays the chill for the Sixteen Hundred Club and
everything seems to be all right. Naturally we are all very glad there is no
more trouble over the proposition, because the best Dave can get is the worst
of it in a jam with a newspaper guy.</p>

<p>Personally, I figure Dave will soon find himself another doll and forget all
about Miss Billy Perry, because now that I take another peek at her, I can see
where she is just about the same as any other tap-dancer, except that she is
red-headed. Tap-dancers are generally blackheads, but I do not know why.</p>

<p>Moosh, the doorman at the Sixteen Hundred Club, tells me Miss Missouri
Martin keeps plugging for Dave the Dude with Miss Billy Perry in a quiet way,
because he says he hears Miss Missouri Martin make the following crack one
night to her: 'Well, I do not see any Simple Simon on your lean and
linger.'</p>

<p>This is Miss Missouri Martin's way of saying she sees no diamond on Miss
Billy Perry's finger, for Miss Missouri Martin is an old experienced doll, who
figures if a guy loves a doll he will prove it with diamonds. Miss Missouri
Martin has many diamonds herself, though how any guy can ever get himself
heated up enough about Miss Missouri Martin to give her diamonds is more than I
can see.</p>

<p>I am not a guy who goes around much, so I do not see Dave the Dude for a
couple of weeks, but late one Sunday afternoon little Johnny McGowan, who is
one of Dave's men, comes and says to me like this: 'What do you think? Dave
grabs the scribe a little while ago and is taking him out for an airing!'</p>

<p>Well, Johnny is so excited it is some time before I can get him cooled out
enough to explain. It seems that Dave the Dude gets his biggest car out of the
garage and sends his driver, Wop Joe, over to the <i>Item</i> office where Waldo
Winchester works, with a message that Miss Billy Perry wishes to see Waldo
right away at Miss Missouri Martin's apartment on Fifty-ninth Street.</p>

<p>Of course this message is nothing but the phonus bolonus, but Waldo drops in
for it and gets in the car. Then Wop Joe drives him up to Miss Missouri
Martin's apartment, and who gets in the car there but Dave the Dude. And away
they go.</p>

<p>Now this is very bad news indeed, because when Dave the Dude takes a guy out
for an airing the guy very often does not come back. What happens to him I
never ask, because the best a guy can get by asking questions in this man's
town is a bust in the nose.</p>

<p>But I am much worried over this proposition, because I like Dave the Dude,
and I know that taking a newspaper guy like Waldo Winchester out for an airing
is apt to cause talk, especially if he does not come back. The other guys that
Dave the Dude takes out for airings do not mean much in particular, but here is
a guy who may produce trouble, even if he is a sucker, on account of being
connected with a newspaper.</p>

<p>I know enough about newspapers to know that by and by the editor or somebody
will be around wishing to know where Waldo Winchester's pieces about Broadway
are, and if there are no pieces from Waldo Winchester, the editor will wish to
know why. Finally it will get around to where other people will wish to know,
and after a while many people will be running around saying: 'Where is Waldo
Winchester?'</p>

<p>And if enough people in this town get to running around saying where is
So-and-so, it becomes a great mystery and the newspapers hop on the cops and
the cops hop on everybody, and by and by there is so much heat in town that it
is no place for a guy to be.</p>

<p>But what is to be done about this situation I do not know. Personally, it
strikes me as very bad indeed, and while Johnny goes away to do a little
telephoning, I am trying to think up some place to go where people will see me,
and remember afterwards that I am there in case it is necessary for them to
remember.</p>

<p>Finally Johnny comes back, very excited, and says: 'Hey, the Dude is up at
the Woodcock Inn on the Pelham Parkway, and he is sending out the word for one
and all to come at once. Good Time Charley Bernstein just gets the wire and
tells me. Something is doing. The rest of the mob are on their way, so let us
be moving.'</p>

<p>But here is an invitation which does not strike me as a good thing at all.
The way I look at it, Dave the Dude is no company for a guy like me at this
time. The chances are he either does something to Waldo Winchester already, or
is getting ready to do something to him which I wish no part of.</p>

<p>Personally, I have nothing against newspaper guys, not even the ones who
write pieces about Broadway. If Dave the Dude wishes to do something to Waldo
Winchester, all right, but what is the sense of bringing outsiders into it? But
the next thing I know, I am in Johnny McGowan's roadster, and he is zipping
along very fast indeed, paying practically no attention to traffic lights or
anything else.</p>

<p>As we go busting out the Concourse, I get to thinking the situation over,
and I figure that Dave the Dude probably keeps thinking about Miss Billy Perry,
and drinking liquor such as they sell in the Chicken Club, until finally he
blows his topper. The way I look at it, only a guy who is off his nut will
think of taking a newspaper guy out for an airing over a doll, when dolls are a
dime a dozen in this man's town.</p>

<p>Still, I remember reading in the papers about a lot of different guys who
are considered very sensible until they get tangled up with a doll, and maybe
loving her, and the first thing anybody knows they hop out of windows, or shoot
themselves, or somebody else, and I can see where even a guy like Dave the Dude
may go daffy over a doll.</p>

<p>I can see that little Johnny McGowan is worried, too, but he does not say
much, and we pull up in front of the Woodcock Inn in no time whatever, to find
a lot of other cars there ahead of us, some of which I recognize as belonging
to different parties.</p>

<p>The Woodcock Inn is what is called a road house, and is run by Big Nig
Skolsky, a very nice man indeed, and a friend of everybody's. It stands back a
piece off the Pelham Parkway and is a very pleasant place to go to, what with
Nig having a good band and a floor show with a lot of fair-looking dolls, and
everything else a man can wish for a good time. It gets a nice play from nice
people, although Nig's liquor is nothing extra.</p>

<p>Personally, I never go there much, because I do not care for road houses,
but it is a great spot for Dave the Dude when he is pitching parties, or even
when he is only drinking single-handed. There is a lot of racket in the joint
as we drive up, and who comes out to meet us but Dave the Dude himself with a
big hello. His face is very red, and he seems heated up no little, but he does
not look like a guy who is meaning any harm to anybody, especially a newspaper
guy.</p>

<p>'Come in, guys!' Dave the Dude yells. 'Come right in!'</p>

<p>So we go in, and the place is full of people sitting at tables, or out on
the floor dancing, and I see Miss Missouri Martin with all her diamonds hanging
from her in different places, and Good Time Charley Bernstein, and Feet
Samuels, and Tony Bertazzola, and Skeets Boliver, and Nick the Greek, and
Rochester Red, and a lot of other guys and dolls from around and about.</p>

<p>In fact, it looks as if everybody from all the joints on Broadway are
present, including Miss Billy Perry, who is all dressed up in white and is
lugging a big bundle of orchids and so forth, and who is giggling and smiling
and shaking hands and going on generally. And finally I see Waldo Winchester,
the scribe, sitting at a ringside table all by himself, but there is nothing
wrong with him as far as I can see. I mean, he seems to be all in one piece so
far.</p>

<p>'Dave,' I say to Dave the Dude, very quiet, 'what is coming off here? You
know a guy cannot be too careful what he does around this town, and I will hate
to see you tangled up in anything right now.'</p>

<p>'Why,' Dave says, 'what are you talking about? Nothing is coming off here
but a wedding, and it is going to be the best wedding anybody on Broadway ever
sees. We are waiting for the preacher now.'</p>

<p>'You mean somebody is going to be married?' I ask, being now somewhat
confused.</p>

<p>'Certainly,' Dave the Dude says. 'What do you think? What is the idea of a
wedding, anyway?'</p>

<p>'Who is going to be married?' I ask.</p>

<p>'Nobody but Billy and the scribe,' Dave says. 'This is the greatest thing I
ever do in my life. I run into Billy the other night and she is crying her eyes
out because she loves this scribe and wishes to marry him, but it seems the
scribe has nothing he can use for money. So I tell Billy to leave it to me,
because you know I love her myself so much I wish to see her happy at all
times, even if she has to marry to be that way.</p>

<p>'So I frame this wedding party, and after they are married I am going to
stake them to a few G's so they can get a good running start,' Dave says. 'But
I do not tell the scribe and I do not let Billy tell him as I wish it to be a
big surprise to him. I kidnap him this afternoon and bring him out here and he
is scared half to death thinking I am going to scrag him.</p>

<p>'In fact,' Dave says, 'I never see a guy so scared. He is still so scared
nothing seems to cheer him up. Go over and tell him to shake himself together,
because nothing but happiness for him is coming off here.'</p>

<p>Well, I wish to say I am greatly relieved to think that Dave intends doing
nothing worse to Waldo Winchester than getting him married up, so I go over to
where Waldo is sitting. He certainly looks somewhat alarmed. He is all in a
huddle with himself, and he has what you call a vacant stare in his eyes. I can
see that he is indeed frightened, so I give him a jolly slap on the back and I
say: 'Congratulations, pal! Cheer up, the worst is yet to come!'</p>

<p>'You bet it is,' Waldo Winchester says, his voice so solemn I am greatly
surprised.</p>

<p>'You are a fine-looking bridegroom,' I say. 'You look as if you are at a
funeral instead of a wedding. Why do you not laugh ha-ha, and maybe take a dram
or two and go to cutting up some?'</p>

<p>'Mister,' says Waldo Winchester, 'my wife is not going to care for me
getting married to Miss Billy Perry.'</p>

<p>'Your wife?' I say, much astonished. 'What is this you are speaking of? How
can you have any wife except Miss Billy Perry? This is great foolishness.'</p>

<p>'I know,' Waldo says, very sad. 'I know. But I got a wife just the same, and
she is going to be very nervous when she hears about this. My wife is very
strict with me. My wife does not allow me to go around marrying people. My wife
is Lola Sapola, of the Rolling Sapolas, the acrobats, and I am married to her
for five years. She is the strong lady who juggles the other four people in the
act. My wife just gets back from a year's tour of the Interstate time, and she
is at the Marx Hotel right this minute. I am upset by this proposition.'</p>

<p>'Does Miss Billy Perry know about this wife?' I ask.</p>

<p>'No,' he says. 'No. She thinks I am single-o.'</p>

<p>'But why do you not tell Dave the Dude you are already married when he
brings you out here to marry you off to Miss Billy Perry?' I ask. 'It seems to
me a newspaper guy must know it is against the law for a guy to marry several
different dolls unless he is a Turk, or some such.'</p>

<p>'Well,' Waldo says, 'if I tell Dave the Dude I am married after taking his
doll away from him, I am quite sure Dave will be very much excited, and maybe
do something harmful to my health.'</p>

<p>Now there is much in what the guy says, to be sure. I am inclined to think,
myself, that Dave will be somewhat disturbed when he learns of this situation,
especially when Miss Billy Perry starts in being unhappy about it. But what is
to be done I do not know, except maybe to let the wedding go on, and then when
Waldo is out of reach of Dave, to put in a claim that he is insane, and that
the marriage does not count. It is a sure thing I do not wish to be around when
Dave the Dude hears Waldo is already married.</p>

<p>I am thinking that maybe I better take it on the lam out of here, when there
is a great row at the door and I hear Dave the Dude yelling that the preacher
arrives. He is a very nice-looking preacher, at that, though he seems somewhat
surprised by the goings-on, especially when Miss Missouri Martin steps up and
takes charge of him. Miss Missouri Martin tells him she is fond of preachers,
and is quite used to them, because she is twice married by preachers, and twice
by justices of the peace, and once by a ship's captain at sea.</p>

<p>By this time one and all present, except maybe myself and Waldo Winchester,
and the preacher and maybe Miss Billy Perry, are somewhat corned. Waldo is
still sitting at his table looking very sad and saying 'Yes' and 'No' to Miss
Billy Perry whenever she skips past him, for Miss Billy Perry is too much
pleasured up with happiness to stay long in one spot.</p>

<p>Dave the Dude is more corned than anybody else, because he has two or three
days' running start on everybody. And when Dave the Dude is corned I wish to
say that he is a very unreliable guy as to temper, and he is apt to explode
right in your face any minute. But he seems to be getting a great bang out of
the doings.</p>

<p>Well, by and by Nig Skolsky has the dance floor cleared, and then he moves
out on the floor a sort of arch of very beautiful flowers. The idea seems to be
that Miss Billy Perry and Waldo Winchester are to be married under this arch. I
can see that Dave the Dude must put in several days planning this whole
proposition, and it must cost him plenty of the old do-re-mi, especially as I
see him showing Miss Missouri Martin a diamond ring as big as a cough drop.</p>

<p>'It is for the bride,' Dave the Dude says. 'The poor loogan she is marrying
will never have enough dough to buy her such a rock, and she always wishes a
big one. I get it off a guy who brings it in from Los Angeles. I am going to
give the bride away myself in person, so how do I act, Mizzoo? I want Billy to
have everything according to the book.'</p>

<p>Well, while Miss Missouri Martin is trying to remember back to one of her
weddings to tell him, I take another peek at Waldo Winchester to see how he is
making out. I once see two guys go to the old warm squativoo up in Sing Sing,
and I wish to say both are laughing heartily compared to Waldo Winchester at
this moment.</p>

<p>Miss Billy Perry is sitting with him and the orchestra leader is calling his
men dirty names because none of them can think of how 'Oh, Promise Me' goes,
when Dave the Dude yells: 'Well, we are all set! Let the happy couple step
forward!'</p>

<p>Miss Billy Perry bounces up and grabs Waldo Winchester by the arm and pulls
him up out of his chair. After a peek at his face I am willing to lay 6 to 5 he
does not make the arch. But he finally gets there with everybody laughing and
clapping their hands, and the preacher comes forward, and Dave the Dude looks
happier than I ever see him look before in his life as they all get together
under the arch of flowers.</p>

<p>Well, all of a sudden there is a terrible racket at the front door of the
Woodcock Inn, with some doll doing a lot of hollering in a deep voice that
sounds like a man's, and naturally everybody turns and looks that way. The
doorman, a guy by the name of Slugsy Sachs, who is a very hard man indeed,
seems to be trying to keep somebody out, but pretty soon there is a heavy bump
and Slugsy Sachs falls down, and in comes a doll about four feet high and five
feet wide.</p>

<p>In fact, I never see such a wide doll. She looks all hammered down. Her face
is almost as wide as her shoulders, and makes me think of a great big full
moon. She comes in bounding-like, and I can see that she is all churned up
about something. As she bounces in, I hear a gurgle, and I look around to see
Waldo Winchester slumping down to the floor, almost dragging Miss Billy Perry
with him.</p>

<p>Well, the wide doll walks right up to the bunch under the arch and says in a
large bass voice: 'Which one is Dave the Dude?'</p>

<p>'I am Dave the Dude,' says Dave the Dude, stepping up. 'What do you mean by
busting in here like a walrus and gumming up our wedding?'</p>

<p>'So you are the guy who kidnaps my ever-loving husband to marry him off to
this little red-headed pancake here, are you?' the wide doll says, looking at
Dave the Dude, but pointing at Miss Billy Perry.</p>

<p>Well now, calling Miss Billy Perry a pancake to Dave the Dude is a very
serious proposition, and Dave the Dude gets very angry. He is usually rather
polite to dolls, but you can see he does not care for the wide doll's manner
whatever.</p>

<p>'Say, listen here,' Dave the Dude says, 'you better take a walk before
somebody clips you. You must be drunk,' he says. 'Or daffy,' he says. 'What are
you talking about, anyway?'</p>

<p>'You will see what I am talking about,' the wide doll yells. 'The guy on the
floor there is my lawful husband. You probably frighten him to death, the poor
dear. You kidnap him to marry this red-headed thing, and I am going to get you
arrested as sure as my name is Lola Sapola, you simple-looking tramp!'</p>

<p>Naturally, everybody is greatly horrified at a doll using such language to
Dave the Dude, because Dave is known to shoot guys for much less, but instead
of doing something to the wide doll at once, Dave says: 'What is this talk I
hear? Who is married to who? Get out of here!' Dave says, grabbing the wide
doll's arm.</p>

<p>Well, she makes out as if she is going to slap Dave in the face with her
left hand, and Dave naturally pulls his kisser out of the way. But instead of
doing anything with her left, Lola Sapola suddenly drives her right fist
smack-dab into Dave the Dude's stomach, which naturally comes forward as his
face goes back.</p>

<p>I wish to say I see many a body punch delivered in my life, but I never see
a prettier one than this. What is more, Lola Sapola steps in with the punch, so
there is plenty on it.</p>

<p>Now a guy who eats and drinks like Dave the Dude does cannot take them so
good in the stomach, so Dave goes 'oof,' and sits down very hard on the dance
floor, and as he is sitting there he is fumbling in his pants pocket for the
old equalizer, so everybody around tears for cover except Lola Sapola, and Miss
Billy Perry, and Waldo Winchester.</p>

<p>But before he can get his pistol out, Lola Sapola reaches down and grabs
Dave by the collar and hoists him to his feet. She lets go her hold on him,
leaving Dave standing on his pins, but teetering around somewhat, and then she
drives her right hand to Dave's stomach a second time.</p>

<p>The punch drops Dave again, and Lola steps up to him as if she is going to
give him the foot. But she only gathers up Waldo Winchester from off the floor
and slings him across her shoulder like he is a sack of oats, and starts for
the door. Dave the Dude sits up on the floor again and by this time he has the
old equalizer in his duke.</p>

<p>'Only for me being a gentleman I will fill you full of slugs,' he yells.</p>

<p>Lola Sapola never even looks back, because by this time she is petting Waldo
Winchester's head and calling him loving names and saying what a shame it is
for bad characters like Dave the Dude to be abusing her precious one. It all
sounds to me as if Lola Sapola thinks well of Waldo Winchester.</p>

<p>Well, after she gets out of sight, Dave the Dude gets up off the floor and
stands there looking at Miss Billy Perry, who is out to break all crying
records. The rest of us come out from under cover, including the preacher, and
we are wondering how mad Dave the Dude is going to be about the wedding being
ruined. But Dave the Dude seems only disappointed and sad.</p>

<p>'Billy,' he says to Miss Billy Perry, 'I am mighty sorry you do not get your
wedding. All I wish for is your happiness, but I do not believe you can ever be
happy with this scribe if he also has to have his lion tamer around. As Cupid I
am a total bust. This is the only nice thing I ever try to do in my whole life,
and it is too bad it does not come off. Maybe if you wait until we can drown
her, or something--'</p>

<p>'Dave,' says Miss Billy Perry, dropping so many tears that she seems to
finally wash herself right into Dave the Dude's arms, 'I will never, never be
happy with such a guy as Waldo Winchester. I can see now you are the only man
for me.'</p>

<p>'Well, well, well,' Dave the Dude says, cheering right up. 'Where is the
preacher? Bring on the preacher and let us have our wedding anyway.'</p>

<p>I see Mr. and Mrs. Dave the Dude the other day, and they seem very happy.
But you never can tell about married people, so of course I am never going to
let on to Dave the Dude that I am the one who telephones Lola Sapola at the
Marx Hotel, because maybe I do not do Dave any too much of a favour, at
that.</p>


<h3><a name="Dream_Street_Rose" id="Dream_Street_Rose">Dream Street Rose</a></h3>

<p>Of an early evening when there is nothing much doing anywhere else, I go
around to Good Time Charley's little speak in West Forty-seventh Street that he
calls the Gingham Shoppe, and play a little klob with Charley, because business
is quiet in the Gingham Shoppe at such an hour, and Charley gets very
lonesome.</p>

<p>He once has a much livelier spot in Forty-eighth Street that he calls the
Crystal Room, but one night a bunch of G-guys step into the joint and bust it
wide open, besides confiscating all of Charley's stock of merchandise. It seems
that these G-guys are members of a squad that comes on from Washington, and
being strangers in the city they do not know that Good Time Charley's joint is
not supposed to be busted up, so they go ahead and bust it, just the same as if
it is any other joint.</p>

<p>Well, this action causes great indignation in many quarters, and a lot of
citizens advise Charley to see somebody about it. But Charley says no. Charley
says if this is the way the government is going to treat him after the way he
walks himself bow-legged over in France with the Rainbow Division, making the
Germans hard to catch, why, all right. But he is not going to holler copper
about it, although Charley says he has his own opinion of Mr. Hoover, at
that.</p>

<p>Personally, I greatly admire Charley for taking the disaster so calmly,
especially as it catches him with very few potatoes. Charley is a great hand
for playing the horses with any dough he makes out of the Crystal Room, and
this particular season the guys who play the horses are being murdered by the
bookies all over the country, and are in terrible distress.</p>

<p>So I know if Charley is not plumb broke that he has a terrible crack across
his belly, and I am not surprised that I do not see him for a couple of weeks
after the government guys knock off the Crystal Room. I hear rumours that he is
at home reading the newspapers very carefully every day, especially the
obituary notices, for it seems that Charley figures that some of the G-guys may
be tempted to take a belt or two at the merchandise they confiscate, and
Charley says if they do, he is even for life.</p>

<p>Finally I hear that Charley is seen buying a bolt of gingham in
Bloomington's one day, so I know he will be in action again very soon, for all
Charley needs to go into action is a bolt of gingham and a few bottles of
Golden Wedding. In fact, I know Charley to go into action without the gingham,
but as a rule he likes to drape a place of business with gingham to make it
seem more homelike to his customers, and I wish to say that when it comes to
draping gingham, Charley can make a sucker of Joseph Urban, or anybody
else.</p>

<p>Well, when I arrive at the Gingham Shoppe this night I am talking about,
which is around ten o'clock, I find Charley in a very indignant state of mind,
because an old tomato by the name of Dream Street Rose comes in and tracks up
his floor, just after Charley gets through mopping it up, for Charley does his
mopping in person, not being able as yet to afford any help.</p>

<p>Rose is sitting at a table in a corner, paying no attention to Charley's
remarks about wiping her feet on the Welcome mat at the door before she comes
in, because Rose knows there is no Welcome mat at Charley's door, anyway, but I
can see where Charley has a right to a few beefs, at that, as she leaves a
trail of black hoofprints across the clean floor as if she is walking around in
mud somewhere before she comes in, although I do not seem to remember that it
is raining when I arrive.</p>

<p>Now this Dream Street Rose is an old doll of maybe fifty-odd, and is a very
well-known character around and about, as she is wandering through the Forties
for many a year, and especially through West Forty-seventh Street between Sixth
and Seventh Avenues, and this block is called Dream Street. And the reason it
is called Dream Street is because in this block are many characters of one kind
and another who always seem to be dreaming of different matters.</p>

<p>In Dream Street there are many theatrical hotels, and rooming houses, and
restaurants, and speaks, including Good Time Charley's Gingham Shoppe, and in
the summer time the characters I mention sit on the stoops or lean against the
railings along Dream Street, and the gab you hear sometimes sounds very dreamy
indeed. In fact, it sometimes sounds very pipe-dreamy.</p>

<p>Many actors, male and female, and especially vaudeville actors, live in the
hotels and rooming houses, and vaudeville actors, both male and female, are
great hands for sitting around dreaming out loud about how they will
practically assassinate the public in the Palace if ever they get a chance.</p>

<p>Furthermore, in Dream Street are always many hand-bookies and horse players,
who sit on the church steps on the cool side of Dream Street in the summer and
dream about big killings on the races, and there are also nearly always many
fight managers, and sometimes fighters, hanging out in front of the
restaurants, picking their teeth and dreaming about winning championships of
the world, although up to this time no champion of the world has yet come out
of Dream Street.</p>

<p>In this street you see burlesque dolls, and hoofers, and guys who write
songs, and saxophone players, and newsboys, and newspaper scribes, and taxi
drivers, and blind guys, and midgets, and blondes with Pomeranian pooches, or
maybe French poodles, and guys with whiskers, and night-club entertainers, and
I do not know what all else. And all of these characters are interesting to
look at, and some of them are very interesting to talk to, although if you
listen to several I know long enough, you may get the idea that they are
somewhat daffy, especially the horse players.</p>

<p>But personally I consider all horse players more or less daffy anyway. In
fact, the way I look at it, if a guy is not daffy he will not be playing the
horses.</p>

<p>Now this Dream Street Rose is a short, thick-set, square-looking old doll,
with a square pan, and square shoulders, and she has heavy iron-grey hair that
she wears in a square bob, and she stands very square on her feet. In fact,
Rose is the squarest-looking doll I ever see, and she is as strong and lively
as Jim Londos, the wrestler. In fact, Jim Londos will never be any better than
6 to 5 in my line over Dream Street Rose, if she is in any kind of shape.</p>

<p>Nobody in this town wishes any truck with Rose if she has a few shots of
grog in her, and especially Good Time Charley's grog, for she can fight like
the dickens when she is grogged up. In fact, Rose holds many a decision in this
town, especially over coppers, because if there is one thing she hates and
despises more than somewhat it is a copper, as coppers are always heaving her
into the old can when they find her jerking citizens around and cutting up
other didoes.</p>

<p>For many years Rose works in the different hotels along Dream Street as a
chambermaid. She never works in any one hotel very long, because the minute she
gets a few bobs together she likes to go out and enjoy a little recreation,
such as visiting around the speaks, although she is about as welcome in most
speaks as a G-guy with a search warrant. You see, nobody can ever tell when
Rose may feel like taking the speak apart, and also the customers.</p>

<p>She never has any trouble getting a job back in any hotel she ever works in,
for Rose is a wonderful hand for making up beds, although several times, when
she is in a hurry to get off, I hear she makes up beds with guests still in
them, which causes a few mild beefs to the management, but does not bother
Rose. I speak of this matter only to show you that she is a very quaint
character indeed, and full of zest.</p>

<p>Well, I sit down to play klob with Good Time Charley, but about this time
several customers come into the Gingham Shoppe, so Charley has to go and take
care of them, leaving me alone. And while I am sitting there alone I hear Dream
Street Rose mumbling to herself over in the corner, but I pay no attention to
her, although I wish to say I am by no means unfriendly with Rose.</p>

<p>In fact, I say hello to her at all times, and am always very courteous to
her, as I do not wish to have her bawling me out in public, and maybe
circulating rumours about me, as she is apt to do, if she feels I am snubbing
her.</p>

<p>Finally I notice her motioning to me to come over to her table, and I go
over at once and sit down, because I can see that Rose is well grogged up at
this time, and I do not care to have her attracting my attention by chucking a
cuspidor at me. She offers me a drink when I sit down, but of course I never
drink anything that is sold in Good Time Charley's, as a personal favour to
Charley. He says he wishes to retain my friendship.</p>

<p>So I just sit there saying nothing much whatever, and Rose keeps on mumbling
to herself, and I am not able to make much of her mumbling, until finally she
looks at me and says to me like this:</p>

<p>'I am now going to tell you about my friend,' Rose says.</p>

<p>'Well, Rose,' I say, 'personally I do not care to hear about your friend,
although,' I say, 'I have no doubt that what you wish to tell me about this
friend is very interesting. But I am here to play a little klob with Good Time
Charley, and I do not have time to hear about your friend.'</p>

<p>'Charley is busy selling his poison to the suckers,' Rose says. 'I am now
going to tell you about my friend. It is quite a story,' she says. 'You will
listen.'</p>

<p>So I listen.</p>

<p>It is a matter of thirty-five years ago [Dream Street Rose says] and the
spot is a town in Colorado by the name of Pueblo, where there are smelters and
one thing and another. My friend is at this time maybe sixteen or seventeen
years old, and a first-class looker in every respect. Her papa is dead, and her
mamma runs a boarding-house for the guys who work in the smelters, and who are
very hearty eaters. My friend deals them off the arm for the guys in her
mamma's boarding-house to save her mamma the expense of a waitress.</p>

<p>Now among the boarders in this boarding-house are many guys who are always
doing a little pitching to my friend, and trying to make dates with her to take
her places, but my friend never gives them much of a tumble, because after she
gets through dealing them off the arm all day her feet generally pain her too
much to go anywhere on them except to the hay.</p>

<p>Finally, however, along comes a tall, skinny young guy from the East by the
name of Frank something, who has things to say to my friend that are much more
interesting than anything that has been said to her by a guy before, including
such things as love and marriage, which are always very interesting subjects to
any young doll.</p>

<p>This Frank is maybe twenty-five years old, and he comes from the East with
the idea of making his fortune in the West, and while it is true that fortunes
are being made in the West at this time, there is little chance that Frank is
going to make any part of a fortune, as he does not care to work very hard. In
fact, he does not care to work at all, being much more partial to playing a
little poker, or shooting a few craps, or maybe hustling a sucker around Mike's
pool room on Santa Fe Avenue, for Frank is an excellent pool player, especially
when he is playing a sucker.</p>

<p>Now my friend is at this time a very innocent young doll, and a good doll in
every respect, and her idea of love includes a nice little home, and children
running here and there and around and about, and she never has a wrong thought
in her life, and believes that everybody else in the world is like herself. And
the chances are if this Frank does not happen along, my friend will marry a
young guy in Pueblo by the name of Higginbottom, who is very fond of her
indeed, and who is a decent young guy and afterwards makes plenty of potatoes
in the grocery dodge.</p>

<p>But my friend goes very daffy over Frank and cannot see anybody but him, and
the upshot of it all is she runs away with him one day to Denver, being dumb
enough to believe that he means it when he tells her that he loves her and is
going to marry her. Why Frank ever bothers with such a doll as my friend in the
first place is always a great mystery to one and all, and the only way anybody
can explain it is that she is young and fresh, and he is a heel at heart.</p>

<p>'Well, Rose,' I say, 'I am now commencing to see the finish of this story
about your friend, and,' I say, 'it is such a story as anybody can hear in a
speak at any time in this town, except,' I say, 'maybe your story is longer
than somewhat. So I will now thank you, and excuse myself, and play a little
klob with Good Time Charley.'</p>

<p>'You will listen,' Dream Street Rose says, looking me slap-dab in the
eye.</p>

<p>So I listen.</p>

<p>Moreover, I notice now that Good Time Charley is standing behind me, bending
in an ear, as it seems that his customers take the wind after a couple of slams
of Good Time Charley's merchandise, a couple of slams being about all that even
a very hardy customer can stand at one session.</p>

<p>Of course [Rose goes on] the chances are Frank never intends marrying my
friend at all, and she never knows until long afterward that the reason he
leads her to the parson is that the young guy from Pueblo by the name of
Higginbottom catches up with them at the old Windsor Hotel where they are
stopping and privately pokes a six-pistol against Frank's ribs and promises
faithfully to come back and blow a hole in Frank you can throw a watermelon
through if Frank tries any phenagling around with my friend.</p>

<p>Well, in practically no time whatever, love's young dream is over as far as
my friend is concerned. This Frank turns out to be a most repulsive character
indeed, especially if you are figuring him as an ever-loving husband. In fact,
he is no good. He mistreats my friend in every way any guy ever thought of
mistreating a doll, and besides the old established ways of mistreating a doll,
Frank thinks up quite a number of new ways, being really quite ingenious in
this respect.</p>

<p>Yes, this Frank is one hundred per cent heel.</p>

<p>It is not so much that he gives her a thumping now and then, because, after
all, a thumping wears off, and hurts heal up, even when they are such hurts as
a broken nose and fractured ribs, and once an ankle cracked by a kick. It is
what he does to her heart, and to her innocence. He is by no means a good
husband, and does not know how to treat an ever-loving wife with any respect,
especially as he winds up by taking my friend to San Francisco and hiring her
out to a very loose character there by the name of Black Emanuel, who has a
dance joint on the Barbary Coast, which, at the time I am talking about, is
hotter than a stove. In this joint my friend has to dance with the customers,
and get them to buy beer for her and one thing and another, and this occupation
is most distasteful to my friend, as she never cares for beer.</p>

<p>It is there Frank leaves her for good after giving her an extra big thumping
for a keepsake, and when my friend tries to leave Black Emanuel's to go looking
for her ever-loving husband, she is somewhat surprised to hear Black Emanuel
state that he pays Frank three C's for her to remain there and continue
working. Furthermore, Black Emanuel resumes the thumpings where Frank leaves
off, and by and by my friend is much bewildered and downhearted and does not
care what happens to her.</p>

<p>Well, there is nothing much of interest in my friend's life for the next
thirty-odd years, except that she finally gets so she does not mind the beer so
much, and, in fact, takes quite a fondness for it, and also for light wines and
Bourbon whisky, and that she comes to realize that Frank does not love her
after all, in spite of what he says. Furthermore, in later years, after she
drifts around the country quite some, in and out of different joints, she
realises that the chances are she will never have a nice little home, with
children running here and there, and she often thinks what a disagreeable
influence Frank has on her life.</p>

<p>In fact, this Frank is always on her mind more than somewhat. In fact, she
thinks of him night and day, and says many a prayer that he will do well. She
manages to keep track of him, which is not hard to do, at that, as Frank is in
New York, and is becoming quite a guy in business, and is often in the
newspapers. Maybe his success is due to my friend's prayers, but the chances
are it is more because he connects up with some guy who has an invention for
doing something very interesting in steel, and by grabbing an interest in this
invention Frank gets a shove toward plenty of potatoes. Furthermore, he is
married, and is raising up a family.</p>

<p>About ten or twelve years ago my friend comes to New York, and by this time
she is getting a little faded around the edges. She is not so old, at that, but
the air of the Western and Southern joints is bad on the complexion, and beer
is no good for the figure. In fact, my friend is now quite a haybag, and she
does not get any better-looking in the years she spends in New York as she is
practically all out of the old sex appeal, and has to do a little heavy lifting
to keep eating. But she never forgets to keep praying that Frank will continue
to do well, and Frank certainly does this, as he is finally spoken of
everywhere very respectfully as a millionaire and a high-class guy.</p>

<p>In all the years she is in New York my friend never runs into Frank, as
Frank is by no means accustomed to visiting the spots where my friend hangs
out, but my friend goes to a lot of bother to get acquainted with a doll who is
a maid for some time in Frank's town house in East Seventy-fourth Street, and
through this doll my friend keeps a pretty fair line on the way Frank lives. In
fact, one day when Frank and his family are absent, my friend goes to Frank's
house with her friend, just to see what it looks like, and after an hour there
my friend has the joint pretty well cased.</p>

<p>So now my friend knows through her friend that on very hot nights such as
to-night Frank's family is bound to be at their country place at Port
Washington, but that Frank himself is spending the night at his town house,
because he wishes to work on a lot of papers of some kind. My friend knows
through her friend that all of Frank's servants are at Port Washington, too,
except my friend's friend, who is in charge of the town house, and Frank's
valet, a guy by the name of Sloggins.</p>

<p>Furthermore, my friend knows through her friend that both her friend and
Sloggins have a date to go to a movie at 8.30 o'clock, to be gone a couple of
hours, as it seems Frank is very big-hearted about giving his servants time off
for such a purpose when he is at home alone; although one night he squawks no
little when my friend is out with her friend drinking a little beer, and my
friend's friend loses her door key and has to ring the bell to the servants'
entrance, and rousts Frank out of a sound sleep.</p>

<p>Naturally, my friend's friend will be greatly astonished if she ever learns
that it is with this key that my friend steps into Frank's house along about
nine o'clock to-night. An electric light hangs over the servants' entrance, and
my friend locates the button that controls this light just inside the door and
turns it off, as my friend figures that maybe Frank and his family will not
care to have any of their high-class neighbours, or anyone else, see an old
doll who has no better hat than she is wearing, entering or leaving their house
at such an hour.</p>

<p>It is an old-fashioned sort of house, four or five stories high, with the
library on the third floor in the rear, looking out through French windows over
a nice little garden, and my friend finds Frank in the library where she
expects to find him, because she is smart enough to figure that a guy who is
working on papers is not apt to be doing his work in the cellar.</p>

<p>But Frank is not working on anything when my friend moves in on him. He is
dozing in a chair by the window, and, looking at him, after all these years,
she finds something of a change, indeed. He is much heavier than he is
thirty-five years back, and his hair is white, but he looks pretty well to my
friend, at that, as she stands there for maybe five minutes watching him. Then
he seems to realize somebody is in the room, as sleeping guys will do, for his
regular breathing stops with a snort, and he opens his eyes, and looks into my
friend's eyes, but without hardly stirring. And finally my friend speaks to
Frank as follows:</p>

<p>'Well, Frank,' she says, 'do you know me?'</p>

<p>'Yes,' he says, after a while, 'I know you. At first I think maybe you are a
ghost, as I once hear something about your being dead. But,' he says, 'I see
now the report is a canard. You are too fat to be a ghost.'</p>

<p>Well, of course, this is a most insulting crack, indeed, but my friend
passes it off as she does not wish to get in any arguments with Frank at this
time. She can see that he is upset more than somewhat and he keeps looking
around the room as if he hopes he can see somebody else he can cut in on the
conversation. In fact, he acts as if my friend is by no means a welcome
visitor.</p>

<p>'Well, Frank,' my friend says, very pleasant, 'there you are, and here I am.
I understand you are now a wealthy and prominent citizen of this town. I am
glad to know this, Frank,' she says. 'You will be surprised to hear that for
years and years I pray that you will do well for yourself and become a big guy
in every respect, with a nice family, and everything else. I judge my prayers
are answered,' she says. 'I see by the papers that you have two sons at Yale,
and a daughter in Vassar, and that your ever-loving wife is getting to be very
high mucky-mucky in society. Well, Frank,' she says, 'I am very glad. I pray
something like all this will happen to you.'</p>

<p>Now, at such a speech, Frank naturally figures that my friend is all right,
at that, and the chances are he also figures that she still has a mighty soft
spot in her heart for him, just as she has in the days when she deals them off
the arm to keep him in gambling and drinking money. In fact, Frank brightens up
somewhat, and he says to my friend like this:</p>

<p>'You pray for my success?' he says. 'Why, this is very thoughtful of you,
indeed. Well,' he says, 'I am sitting on top of the world. I have everything to
live for.'</p>

<p>'Yes,' my friend says, 'and this is exactly where I pray I will find you. On
top of the world,' she says, 'and with everything to live for. It is where I am
when you take my life. It is where I am when you kill me as surely as if you
strangle me with your hands. I always pray you will not become a bum,' my
friend says, 'because a bum has nothing to live for, anyway. I want to find you
liking to live, so you will hate so much to die.'</p>

<p>Naturally, this does not sound so good to Frank, and he begins all of a
sudden to shake and shiver and to stutter somewhat.</p>

<p>'Why,' he says, 'what do you mean? Are you going to kill me?'</p>

<p>'Well,' my friend says, 'that remains to be seen. Personally,' she says, 'I
will be much obliged if you will kill yourself, but it can be arranged one way
or the other. However, I will explain the disadvantages of me killing you.</p>

<p>'The chances are,' my friend says, 'if I kill you I will be caught and a
very great scandal will result, because,' she says, 'I have on my person the
certificate of my marriage to you in Denver, and something tells me you never
think to get a divorce. So,' she says, 'you are a bigamist.'</p>

<p>'I can pay,' Frank says. 'I can pay plenty.'</p>

<p>'Furthermore,' my friend says, paying no attention to his remark, 'I have a
sworn statement from Black Emanuel about your transaction with him, for Black
Emanuel gets religion before he dies from being shivved by Johnny Mizzoo, and
he tries to round himself up by confessing all the sins he can think of, which
are quite a lot. It is a very interesting statement,' my friend says.</p>

<p>'Now then,' she says, 'if you knock yourself off you will leave an
unsullied, respected name. If I kill you, all the years and effort you have
devoted to building up your reputation will go for nothing. You are past
sixty,' my friend says, 'and any way you figure it, you do not have so very far
to go. If I kill you,' she says, 'you will go in horrible disgrace, and
everybody around you will feel the disgrace, no matter how much dough you leave
them. Your children will hang their heads in shame. Your ever-loving wife will
not like it,' my friend says.</p>

<p>'I wait on you a long time, Frank,' my friend says. 'A dozen times in the
past twenty years I figure I may as well call on you and close up my case with
you, but,' she says, 'then I always persuade myself to wait a little longer so
you would rise higher and higher and life will be a bit sweeter to you. And
there you are, Frank,' she says, 'and here I am.'</p>

<p>Well, Frank sits there as if he is knocked plumb out, and he does not answer
a word; so finally my friend outs with a large John Roscoe which she is packing
in the bosom of her dress, and tosses it in his lap, and speaks as follows:</p>

<p>'Frank,' she says, 'do not think it will do you any good to pot me in the
back when I turn around, because,' she says, 'you will be worse off than ever.
I leave plenty of letters scattered around in case anything happens to me. And
remember,' she says, 'if you do not do this job yourself, I will be back.
Sooner or later, I will be back.'</p>

<p>So [Dream Street Rose says] my friend goes out of the library and down the
stairs, leaving Frank sprawled out in his chair, and when she reaches the first
floor she hears what may be a shot in the upper part of the house, and then
again maybe only a door slamming. My friend never knows for sure what it is,
because a little later as she nears the servants' entrance she hears quite a
commotion outside, and a guy cussing a blue streak, and a doll tee-heeing, and
pretty soon my friend's friend, the maid, and Sloggins, the valet, come walking
in.</p>

<p>Well, my friend just has time to scroonch herself back in a dark corner, and
they go upstairs, the guy still cussing and the doll still giggling, and my
friend cannot make out what it is all about except that they come home earlier
than she figures. So my friend goes tippy-toe out of the servants' entrance, to
grab a taxi not far from the house and get away from this neighbourhood, and
now you will soon hear of the suicide of a guy who is a millionaire, and it
will be all even with my friend.</p>

<p>'Well, Rose: I say, 'it is a nice long story, and full of romance and all
this and that, and,' I say, 'of course I will never be ungentlemanly enough to
call a lady a liar, but,' I say, 'if it is not a lie, it will do until a lie
comes along.'</p>

<p>'All right,' Rose says. 'Anyway, I tell you about my friend. Now,' she says,
'I am going where the liquor is better, which can be any other place in town,
because,' she says, 'there is no chance of liquor anywhere being any
worse.'</p>

<p>So she goes out, making more tracks on Good Time Charley's floor, and
Charley speaks most impolitely of her after she goes, and gets out his mop to
clean the floor, for one thing about Charley, he is as neat as a pin, and maybe
neater.</p>

<p>Well, along toward one o'clock I hear a newsboy in the street outside
yelling something I cannot make out, because he is yelling as if he has a
mouthful of mush, as newsboys are bound to do. But I am anxious to see what
goes in the first race at Belmont, on account of having a first-class tip, so I
poke my noggin outside Good Time Charley's and buy a paper, and across the
front page, in large letters, it states that the wealthy Mr. Frank
Billingsworth McQuiggan knocks himself off by putting a slug through his own
noggin.</p>

<p>It says Mr. McQuiggan is found in a chair in his library as dead as a
door-nail with the pistol in his lap with which he knocks himself off, and the
paper states that nobody can figure what causes Mr. McQuiggan to do such a
thing to himself as he is in good health and has plenty of potatoes and is at
the peak of his career. Then there is a lot about his history.</p>

<p>When Mr. McQuiggan is a young fellow returning from a visit to the Pacific
Coast with about two hundred dollars in his pocket after paying his railroad
fare, he meets in the train Jonas Calloway, famous inventor of the Calloway
steel process. Calloway, also then young, is desperately in need of funds and
he offers Mr. McQuiggan a third interest in his invention for what now seems
the paltry sum of one hundred dollars. Mr. McQuiggan accepts the offer and thus
paves the way to his own fortune.</p>

<p>I am telling all this to Good Time Charley while he is mopping away at the
floor, and finally I come on a paragraph down near the finish which goes like
this: 'The body was discovered by Mr. McQuiggan's faithful valet, Thomas
Sloggins, at eleven o'clock. Mr. McQuiggan was then apparently dead a couple of
hours. Sloggins returned home shortly before ten o'clock with another servant
after changing his mind about going to a movie. Instead of going to see his
employer at once, as is his usual custom, Sloggins went to his own quarters and
changed his clothes.</p>

<p>'The light over the servants' entrance was out when I returned home,' the
valet said, 'and in the darkness I stumbled over some scaffolding and other
material left near this entrance by workmen who are to regravel the roof of the
house to-morrow, upsetting all over the entranceway a large bucket of tar, much
of which got on my apparel when I fell, making a change necessary before going
to see Mr. McQuiggan.'</p>

<p>Well, Good Time Charley keeps on mopping harder than ever, though finally he
stops a minute and speaks to me as follows:</p>

<p>'Listen,' Charley says, 'understand I do not say the guy does not deserve
what he gets, and I am by no means hollering copper, but,' Charley says, 'if he
knocks himself off, how does it come the rod is still in his lap where Dream
Street Rose says her friend tosses it? Well, never mind,' Charley says, 'but
can you think of something that will remove tar from a wood floor? It
positively will not mop off.'</p>

<h3><a name="The_Old_Dolls_House" id="The_Old_Dolls_House">The Old Doll's House</a></h3>

<p>Now it seems that one cold winter night, a party of residents of Brooklyn
comes across the Manhattan Bridge in an automobile wishing to pay a call on a
guy by the name of Lance McGowan, who is well known to one and all along
Broadway as a coming guy in the business world.</p>

<p>In fact, it is generally conceded that, barring accident, Lance will someday
be one of the biggest guys in this country as an importer, and especially as an
importer of such merchandise as fine liquors, because he is very bright, and
has many good connections throughout the United States and Canada.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Lance McGowan is a nice-looking young guy and he has plenty of
ticker, although some citizens say he does not show very sound business
judgment in trying to move in on Angie the Ox over in Brooklyn, as Angie the Ox
is an importer himself, besides enjoying a splendid trade in other lines,
including artichokes and extortion.</p>

<p>Of course Lance McGowan is not interested in artichokes at all, and very
little in extortion, but he does not see any reason why he shall not place his
imports in a thriving territory such as Brooklyn, especially as his line of
merchandise is much superior to anything handled by Angie the Ox.</p>

<p>Anyway, Angie is one of the residents of Brooklyn in the party that wishes
to call on Lance McGowan, and besides Angie the party includes a guy by the
name of Mockie Max, who is a very prominent character in Brooklyn, and another
guy by the name of The Louse Kid, who is not so prominent, but who is
considered a very promising young guy in many respects, although personally I
think The Louse Kid has a very weak face.</p>

<p>He is supposed to be a wonderful hand with a burlap bag when anybody wishes
to put somebody in such a bag, which is considered a great practical joke in
Brooklyn, and in fact The Louse Kid has a burlap bag with him on the night in
question, and they are figuring on putting Lance McGowan in the bag when they
call on him, just for the laugh. Personally, I consider this a very crude form
of humour, but then Angie the Ox and the other members of his party are very
crude characters, anyway.</p>

<p>Well, it seems they have Lance McGowan pretty well cased, and they know that
of an evening along toward ten o'clock he nearly always strolls through West
Fifty-fourth street on his way to a certain spot on Park Avenue that is called
the Humming Bird Club, which has a very high-toned clientele, and the reason
Lance goes there is because he has a piece of the joint, and furthermore he
loves to show off his shape in a tuxedo to the swell dolls.</p>

<p>So these residents of Brooklyn drive in their automobile along this route,
and as they roll past Lance McGowan, Angie the Ox and Mockie Max let fly at
Lance with a couple of sawed-offs, while The Louse Kid holds the burlap bag,
figuring for all I know that Lance will be startled by the sawed-offs and will
hop into the bag like a rabbit.</p>

<p>But Lance is by no means a sucker, and when the first blast of slugs from
the sawed-offs breezes past him without hitting him, what does he do but hop
over a brick wall alongside him and drop into a yard on the other side. So
Angie the Ox, and Mockie Max and The Louse Kid get out of their automobile and
run up close to the wall themselves because they commence figuring that if
Lance McGowan starts popping at them from behind this wall, they will be taking
plenty the worst of it, for of course they cannot figure Lance to be strolling
about without being rodded up somewhat.</p>

<p>But Lance is by no means rodded up, because a rod is apt to create a bump in
his shape when he has his tuxedo on, so the story really begins with Lance
McGowan behind the brick wall, practically defenceless, and the reason I know
this story is because Lance McGowan tells most of it to me, as Lance knows that
I know his real name is Lancelot, and he feels under great obligation to me
because I never mention the matter publicly.</p>

<p>Now, the brick wall Lance hops over is a wall around a pretty fair-sized
yard, and the yard belongs to an old two-story stone house, and this house is
well known to one and all in this man's town as a house of great mystery, and
it is pointed out as such by the drivers of sightseeing buses.</p>

<p>This house belongs to an old doll by the name of Miss Abigail Ardsley, and
anybody who ever reads the newspapers will tell you that Miss Abigail Ardsley
has so many potatoes that it is really painful to think of, especially to
people who have no potatoes whatever. In fact, Miss Abigail Ardsley has
practically all the potatoes in the world, except maybe a few left over for
general circulation.</p>

<p>These potatoes are left to her by her papa, old Waldo Ardsley, who
accumulates same in the early days of this town by buying corner real estate
very cheap before people realize this real estate will be quite valuable later
on for fruit-juice stands and cigar stores.</p>

<p>It seems that Waldo is a most eccentric old bloke, and is very strict with
his daughter, and will never let her marry, or even as much as look as if she
wishes to marry, until finally she is so old she does not care a cuss about
marrying, or anything else, and becomes very eccentric herself.</p>

<p>In fact, Miss Abigail Ardsley becomes so eccentric that she cuts herself off
from everybody, and especially from a lot of relatives who are wishing to live
off her, and any time anybody cuts themselves off from such characters they are
considered very eccentric, indeed, especially by the relatives. She lives in
the big house all alone, except for a couple of old servants, and it is very
seldom that anybody sees her around and about, and many strange stories are
told of her.</p>

<p>Well, no sooner is he in the yard than Lance McGowan begins looking for a
way to get out, and one way he does not wish to get out is over the wall again,
because he figures Angie the Ox and his sawed-offs are bound to be waiting for
him in Fifty-fourth Street. So Lance looks around to see if there is some way
out of the yard in another direction, but it seems there is no such way, and
pretty soon he sees the snozzle of a sawed-off come poking over the wall, with
the ugly kisser of Angie the Ox behind it, looking for him, and there is Lance
McGowan all cornered up in the yard, and not feeling so good, at that.</p>

<p>Then Lance happens to try a door on one side of the house, and the door
opens at once and Lance McGowan hastens in to find himself in the living-room
of the house. It is a very large living-room with very nice furniture standing
around and about, and oil paintings on the walls, and a big old grandfather's
clock as high as the ceiling, and statuary here and there. In fact, it is such
a nice, comfortable-looking room that Lance McGowan is greatly surprised, as he
is expecting to find a regular mystery-house room such as you see in the
movies, with cobwebs here and there, and everything all rotted up, and maybe
Boris Karloff wandering about making strange noises.</p>

<p>But the only person in this room seems to be a little old doll all dressed
in soft white, who is sitting in a low rocking-chair by an open fireplace in
which a bright fire is going, doing some tatting.</p>

<p>Well, naturally Lance McGowan is somewhat startled by this scene, and he is
figuring that the best thing he can do is to guzzle the old doll before she can
commence yelling for the gendarmes, when she looks up at him and gives him a
soft smile, and speaks to him in a soft voice, as follows:</p>

<p>'Good evening,' the old doll says.</p>

<p>Well, Lance cannot think of any reply to make to this at once, as it is
certainly not a good evening for him, and he stands there looking at the old
doll, somewhat dazed, when she smiles again and tells him to sit down.</p>

<p>So the next thing Lance knows, he is sitting there in a chair in front of
the fireplace chewing the fat with the old doll as pleasant as you please, and
of course the old doll is nobody but Miss Abigail Ardsley. Furthermore, she
does not seem at all alarmed, or even much surprised, at seeing Lance in her
house, but then Lance is never such a looking guy as is apt to scare old dolls,
or young dolls either, especially when he is all slicked up.</p>

<p>Of course Lance knows who Miss Abigail Ardsley is, because he often reads
stories in the newspapers about her the same as everybody else, and he always
figures such a character must be slightly daffy to cut herself off from
everybody when she has all the potatoes in the world, and there is so much fun
going on, but he is very courteous to her, because after all he is a guest in
her home.</p>

<p>'You are young,' the old doll says to Lance McGowan, looking him in the
kisser. 'It is many years since a young man comes through yonder door. 'Ah,
yes,' she says, 'so many years.'</p>

<p>And with this she lets out a big sigh, and looks so very sad that Lance
McGowan's heart is touched. 'Forty-five years now,' the old doll says in a low
voice, as if she is talking to herself. 'So young, so handsome, and so
good.'</p>

<p>And although Lance is in no mood to listen to reminiscences at this time,
the next thing he knows he is hearing a very pathetic love story, because it
seems that Miss Abigail Ardsley is once all hotted up over a young guy who is
nothing but a clerk in her papa's office.</p>

<p>It seems from what Lance McGowan gathers that there is nothing wrong with
the young guy that a million bobs will not cure, but Miss Abigail Ardsley's
papa is a mean old waffle, and he will never listen to her having any truck
with a poor guy, so they dast not let him know how much they love each
other.</p>

<p>But it seems that Miss Abigail Ardsley's ever-loving young guy has plenty of
moxie, and every night he comes to see her after her papa goes to the hay, and
she lets him in through the same side-door Lance McGowan comes through, and
they sit by the fire and hold hands, and talk in low tones, and plan what they
will do when the young guy makes a scratch.</p>

<p>Then one night it seems Miss Abigail Ardsley's papa has the stomach ache, or
some such, and cannot sleep a wink, so he comes wandering downstairs looking
for the Jamaica ginger, and catches Miss Abigail Ardsley and her ever-loving
guy in a clutch that will win the title for any wrestler that can ever learn
it.</p>

<p>Well, this scene is so repulsive to Miss Abigail Ardsley's papa that he is
practically speechless for a minute, and then he orders the young guy out of
his life in every respect, and tells him never to darken his door again,
especially the side-door. But it seems that by this time a great storm is
raging outside, and Miss Abigail Ardsley begs and pleads with her papa to let
the young guy at least remain until the storm subsides, but between being all
sored up at the clutching scene he witnesses, and his stomach ache, Mr. Ardsley
is very hard-hearted, indeed, and he makes the young guy take the wind.</p>

<p>The next morning the poor young guy is found at the side-door frozen as
stiff as a board, because it seems that the storm that is raging is the
blizzard of 1888, which is a very famous event in the history of New York,
although up to this time Lance McGowan never hears of it before, and does not
believe it until he looks the matter up afterwards. It seems from what Miss
Abigail Ardsley says that as near as anyone can make out, the young guy must
return to the door seeking shelter after wandering about in the storm a while,
but of course by this time her papa has the door all bolted up, and nobody
hears the young guy.</p>

<p>'And,' Miss Abigail Ardsley says to Lance McGowan, after giving him all
these details, 'I never speak to my papa again as long as he lives, and no
other man ever comes in or out of yonder door, or any other door of this house,
until your appearance to-night, although,' she says, 'this side-door is never
locked in case such a young man comes seeking shelter.'</p>

<p>Then she looks at Lance McGowan in such a way that he wonders if Miss
Abigail Ardsley hears the sawed-offs going when Angie the Ox and Mockie Max are
tossing slugs at him, but he is too polite to ask.</p>

<p>Well, all these old-time memories seem to make Miss Abigail Ardsley feel
very tough, and by and by she starts to weep, and if there is one thing Lance
McGowan cannot stand it is a doll weeping, even if she is nothing but an old
doll. So he starts in to cheer Miss Abigail Ardsley up, and he pats her on the
arm, and says to her like this:</p>

<p>'Why,' Lance says, 'I am greatly surprised to hear your statement about the
doors around here being so little used. Why, Sweetheart,' Lance says, 'if I
know there is a doll as good-looking as you in the neighbourhood, and a door
unlocked, I will be busting in myself every night. Come, come, come,' Lance
says, 'let us talk things over and maybe have a few laughs, because I may have
to stick around here a while. Listen, Sweetheart,' he says, 'do you happen to
have a drink in the joint?'</p>

<p>Well, at this Miss Abigail Ardsley dries her eyes, and smiles again, and
then she pulls a sort of rope near her, and in comes a guy who seems about
ninety years old, and who seems greatly surprised to see Lance there. In fact,
he is so surprised that he is practically tottering when he leaves the room
after hearing Miss Abigail Ardsley tell him to bring some wine and
sandwiches.</p>

<p>And the wine he brings is such wine that Lance McGowan has half a mind to
send some of the lads around afterwards to see if there is any more of it in
the joint, especially when he thinks of the unlocked side-door, because he can
sell this kind of wine by the carat.</p>

<p>Well, Lance sits there with Miss Abigail Ardsley sipping wine and eating
sandwiches, and all the time he is telling her stories of one kind and another,
some of which he cleans up a little when he figures they may be a little too
snappy for her, and by and by he has her laughing quite heartily indeed.</p>

<p>Finally he figures there is no chance of Angie and his sawed-offs being
outside waiting for him, so he says he guesses he will be going, and Miss
Abigail Ardsley personally sees him to the door, and this time it is the front
door, and as Lance is leaving he thinks of something he once sees a guy do on
the stage, and he takes Miss Abigail Ardsley's hand and raises it to his lips
and gives it a large kiss, all of which is very surprising to Miss Abigail
Ardsley, but more so to Lance McGowan when he gets to thinking about it
afterwards.</p>

<p>Just as he figures, there is no one in sight when he gets out in the street,
so he goes on over to the Humming Bird Club, where he learns that many citizens
are greatly disturbed by his absence, and are wondering if he is in The Louse
Kid's burlap bag, for by this time it is pretty well known that Angie the Ox
and his fellow citizens of Brooklyn are around and about.</p>

<p>In fact, somebody tells Lance that Angie is at the moment over in Good Time
Charley's little speak in West Forty-ninth Street, buying drinks for one and
all, and telling how he makes Lance McGowan hop a brick wall, which of course
sounds most disparaging of Lance.</p>

<p>Well, while Angie is still buying these drinks, and still speaking of making
Lance a brick-wall hopper, all of a sudden the door of Good Time Charley's
speak opens and in comes a guy with a Betsy in his hand and this guy throws
four slugs into Angie the Ox before anybody can say hello.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the guy throws one slug into Mockie Max, and one slug into The
Louse Kid, who are still with Angie the Ox, so the next thing anybody knows
there is Angie as dead as a door-nail, and there is Mockie Max even deader than
Angie, and there is The Louse making a terrible fuss over a slug in his leg,
and nobody can remember what the guy who plugs them looks like, except a couple
of stool pigeons who state that the guy looks very much like Lance McGowan.</p>

<p>So what happens but early the next morning Johnny Brannigan, the
plain-clothes copper, puts the arm on Lance McGowan for plugging Angie the Ox,
and Mockie Max and The Louse Kid, and there is great rejoicing in copper
circles generally because at this time the newspapers are weighing in the sacks
on the coppers quite some, claiming there is too much lawlessness going on
around and about and asking why somebody is not arrested for something.</p>

<p>So the collar of Lance McGowan is water on the wheel of one and all because
Lance is so prominent, and anybody will tell you that it looks as if it is a
sure thing that Lance will be very severely punished, and maybe sent to the
electric chair, although he hires Judge Goldstein, who is one of the
surest-footed lawyers in this town, to defend him. But even Judge Goldstein
admits that Lance is in a tough spot, especially as the newspapers are
demanding justice, and printing long stories about Lance, and pictures of him,
and calling him some very uncouth names.</p>

<p>Finally Lance himself commences to worry about his predicament, although up
to this time a little thing like being charged with murder in the first degree
never bothers Lance very much. And in fact he will not be bothering very much
about this particular charge if he does not find the D. A. very fussy about
letting him out on bail. In fact, it is nearly two weeks before he lets Lance
out on bail, and all this time Lance is in the sneezer, which is a most
mortifying situation to a guy as sensitive as Lance.</p>

<p>Well, by the time Lance's trial comes up, you can get 3 to 1 anywhere that
he will be convicted, and the price goes up to 5 when the prosecution gets
through with its case, and proves by the stool pigeons that at exactly twelve
o'clock on the night of January 5th, Lance McGowan steps into Good Time
Charley's little speak and plugs Angie the Ox, Mockie Max and The Louse
Kid.</p>

<p>Furthermore, several other witnesses who claim they know Lance McGowan by
sight testify that they see Lance in the neighbourhood of Good Time Charley's
around twelve o'clock, so by the time it comes Judge Goldstein's turn to put on
the defence, many citizens are saying that if he can do no more than beat the
chair for Lance he will be doing a wonderful job.</p>

<p>Well, it is late in the afternoon when Judge Goldstein gets up and looks all
around the courtroom, and without making any opening statement to the jury for
the defence, as these mouthpieces usually do, he says like this:</p>

<p>'Call Miss Abigail Ardsley,' he says.</p>

<p>At first nobody quite realizes just who Judge Goldstein is calling for,
although the name sounds familiar to one and all present who read the
newspapers, when in comes a little old doll in a black silk dress that almost
reaches the floor, and a black bonnet that makes a sort of a frame for her
white hair and face.</p>

<p>Afterwards I read in one of the newspapers that she looks like she steps
down out of an old-fashioned ivory miniature and that she is practically
beautiful, but of course Miss Abigail Ardsley has so many potatoes that no
newspaper dast to say she looks like an old chromo.</p>

<p>Anyway, she comes into the courtroom surrounded by so many old guys you will
think it must be recess at the Old Men's Home, except they are all dressed up
in claw-hammer coat tails, and high collars, and afterwards it turns out that
they are the biggest lawyers in this town, and they all represent Miss Abigail
Ardsley one way or another, and they are present to see that her interests are
protected, especially from each other.</p>

<p>Nobody ever sees so much bowing and scraping before in a courtroom. In fact,
even the judge bows, and although I am only a spectator I find myself bowing
too, because the way I look at it, anybody with as many potatoes as Miss
Abigail Ardsley is entitled to a general bowing. When she takes the
witness-stand, her lawyers grab chairs and move up as close to her as possible,
and in the street outside there is practically a riot as word goes around that
Miss Abigail Ardsley is in the court, and citizens come running from every
which way, hoping to get a peek at the richest old doll in the world.</p>

<p>Well, when all hands finally get settled down a little, Judge Goldstein
speaks to Miss Abigail Ardsley as follows:</p>

<p>'Miss Ardsley,' he says, 'I am going to ask you just two or three questions.
Kindly look at this defendant,' Judge Goldstein says, pointing at Lance
McGowan, and giving Lance the office to stand up. 'Do you recognize him?'</p>

<p>Well, the little old doll takes a gander at Lance, and nods her head yes,
and Lance gives her a large smile, and Judge Goldstein says:</p>

<p>'Is he a caller in your home on the night of January fifth?' Judge Goldstein
asks.</p>

<p>'He is,' Miss Abigail Ardsley says.</p>

<p>'Is there a clock in the living-room in which you receive this defendant?'
Judge Goldstein says.</p>

<p>'There is,' Miss Abigail Ardsley says. 'A large clock,' she says. 'A
grandfather's clock.'</p>

<p>'Do you happen to notice,' Judge Goldstein says, 'and do you now recall the
hour indicated by this clock when the defendant leaves your home?'</p>

<p>'Yes,' Miss Abigail Ardsley says, 'I do happen to notice. It is just twelve
o'clock by my clock,' she says. 'Exactly twelve o'clock,' she says.</p>

<p>Well, this statement creates a large sensation in the courtroom, because if
it is twelve o'clock when Lance McGowan leaves Miss Abigail Ardsley's house in
West Fifty-fourth Street, anybody can see that there is no way he can be in
Good Time Charley's little speak over five blocks away at the same minute
unless he is a magician, and the judge begins peeking over his specs at the
coppers in the courtroom very severe, and the cops begin scowling at the stool
pigeons, and I am willing to lay plenty of 6 to 5 that the stools will wish
they are never born before they hear the last of this matter from the
gendarmes.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the guys from the D. A.'s office who are handling the
prosecution are looking much embarrassed, and the jurors are muttering to each
other, and right away Judge Goldstein says he moves that the case against his
client be dismissed, and the judge says he is in favour of the motion, and he
also says he thinks it is high time the gendarmes in this town learn to be a
little careful who they are arresting for murder, and the guys from the D. A.'s
office do not seem to be able to think of anything whatever to say.</p>

<p>So there is Lance as free as anybody, and as he starts to leave the
courtroom he stops by Miss Abigail Ardsley, who is still sitting in the
witness-chair surrounded by her mouthpieces, and he shakes her hand and thanks
her, and while I do not hear it myself, somebody tells me afterwards that Miss
Abigail Ardsley says to Lance in a low voice, like this:</p>

<p>'I will be expecting you again some night, young man,' she says.</p>

<p>'Some night, Sweetheart,' Lance says, 'at twelve o'clock.'</p>

<p>And then he goes on about his business, and Miss Abigail Ardsley goes on
about hers; and everybody says it is certainly a wonderful thing that a doll as
rich as Miss Abigail Ardsley comes forward in the interests of justice to save
a guy like Lance McGowan from a wrong rap.</p>

<p>But of course it is just as well for Lance that Miss Abigail Ardsley does
not explain to the court that when she recovers from the shock of the finding
of her ever-loving young guy frozen to death, she stops all the clocks in her
house at the hour she sees him last, so for forty-five years it is always
twelve o'clock in her house.</p>

<h3><a name="Blood_Pressure" id="Blood_Pressure">Blood Pressure</a></h3>
<p>It is maybe eleven-thirty of a Wednesday night, and I am standing at the
corner of Forty-eighth Street and Seventh Avenue, thinking about my blood
pressure, which is a proposition I never before think much about.</p>

<p>In fact, I never hear of my blood pressure before this Wednesday afternoon
when I go around to see Doc Brennan about my stomach, and he puts a gag on my
arm and tells me that my blood pressure is higher than a cat's back, and the
idea is for me to be careful about what I eat, and to avoid excitement, or I
may pop off all of a sudden when I am least expecting it.</p>

<p>'A nervous man such as you with a blood pressure away up in the paint cards
must live quietly,' Doc Brennan says. 'Ten bucks, please,' he says.</p>

<p>Well, I am standing there thinking it is not going to be so tough to avoid
excitement the way things are around this town right now, and wishing I have my
ten bucks back to bet it on Sun Beau in the fourth race at Pimlico the next
day, when all of a sudden I look up, and who is in front of me but Rusty
Charley.</p>

<p>Now if I have any idea Rusty Charley is coming my way, you can go and bet
all the coffee in Java I will be somewhere else at once, for Rusty Charley is
not a guy I wish to have any truck with whatever. In fact, I wish no part of
him. Furthermore, nobody else in this town wishes to have any part of Rusty
Charley, for he is a hard guy indeed. In fact, there is no harder guy anywhere
in the world. He is a big wide guy with two large hard hands and a great deal
of very bad disposition, and he thinks nothing of knocking people down and
stepping on their kissers if he feels like it.</p>

<p>In fact, this Rusty Charley is what is called a gorill, because he is known
to often carry a gun in his pants pocket, and sometimes to shoot people down as
dead as door-nails with it if he does not like the way they wear their
hats--and Rusty Charley is very critical of hats. The chances are Rusty Charley
shoots many a guy in this man's town, and those he does not shoot he sticks
with his shiv--which is a knife--and the only reason he is not in jail is
because he just gets out of it, and the law does not have time to think up
something to put him back in again for.</p>

<p>Anyway, the first thing I know about Rusty Charley being in my neighbourhood
is when I hear him saying: 'Well, well, well, here we are!'</p>

<p>Then he grabs me by the collar, so it is no use of me thinking of taking it
on the lam away from there, although I greatly wish to do so.</p>

<p>'Hello, Rusty,' I say, very pleasant. 'What is the score?'</p>

<p>'Everything is about even,' Rusty says. 'I am glad to see you, because I am
looking for company. I am over in Philadelphia for three days on business.'</p>

<p>'I hope and trust that you do all right for yourself in Philly, Rusty,' I
say; but his news makes me very nervous, because I am a great hand for reading
the papers and I have a pretty good idea what Rusty's business in Philly is. It
is only the day before that I see a little item from Philly in the papers about
how Gloomy Gus Smallwood, who is a very large operator in the alcohol business
there, is guzzled right at his front door.</p>

<p>Of course, I do not know that Rusty Charley is the party who guzzles Gloomy
Gus Smallwood, but Rusty Charley is in Philly when Gus is guzzled, and I can
put two and two together as well as anybody. It is the same thing as if there
is a bank robbery in Cleveland, Ohio, and Rusty Charley is in Cleveland, Ohio,
or near there. So I am very nervous, and I figure it is a sure thing my blood
pressure is going up every second.</p>

<p>'How much dough do you have on you?' Rusty says. 'I am plumb broke.'</p>

<p>'I do not have more than a couple of bobs, Rusty,' I say. 'I pay a doctor
ten bucks to-day to find out my blood pressure is very bad. But of course you
are welcome to what I have.'</p>

<p>'Well, a couple of bobs is no good to high-class guys like you and me.'
Rusty says. 'Let us go to Nathan Detroit's crap game and win some money.'</p>

<p>Now, of course, I do not wish to go to Nathan Detroit's crap game; and if I
do wish to go there I do not wish to go with Rusty Charley, because a guy is
sometimes judged by the company he keeps, especially around crap games, and
Rusty Charley is apt to be considered bad company. Anyway, I do not have any
dough to shoot craps with, and if I do have dough to shoot craps with, I will
not shoot craps with it at all, but will bet it on Sun Beau, or maybe take it
home and pay off some of the overhead around my joint, such as rent.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I remember what Doc Brennan tells me about avoiding excitement,
and I know there is apt to be excitement around Nathan Detroit's crap game if
Rusty Charley goes there, and maybe run my blood pressure up and cause me to
pop off very unexpected. In fact, I already feel my blood jumping more than
somewhat inside me, but naturally I am not going to give Rusty Charley any
argument, so we go to Nathan Detroit's crap game.</p>

<p>This crap game is over a garage in Fifty-second Street this particular
night, though sometimes it is over a restaurant in Forty-seventh Street, or in
back of a cigar store in Forty-fourth Street. In fact, Nathan Detroit's crap
game is apt to be anywhere, because it moves around every night, as there is no
sense in a crap game staying in one spot until the coppers find out where it
is.</p>

<p>So Nathan Detroit moves his crap game from spot to spot, and citizens
wishing to do business with him have to ask where he is every night; and of
course almost everybody on Broadway knows this, as Nathan Detroit has guys
walking up and down, and around and about, telling the public his address, and
giving out the password for the evening.</p>

<p>Well, Jack the Beefer is sitting in an automobile outside the garage in
Fifty-second Street when Rusty Charley and I come along, and he says 'Kansas
City,' very low, as we pass, this being the password for the evening; but we do
not have to use any password whatever when we climb the stairs over the garage,
because the minute Solid John, the doorman, peeks out through his peep-hole
when we knock, and sees Rusty Charley with me, he opens up very quick indeed,
and gives us a big castor-oil smile, for nobody in this town is keeping doors
shut on Rusty Charley very long.</p>

<p>It is a very dirty room over the garage, and full of smoke, and the crap
game is on an old pool table; and around the table, and packed in so close you
cannot get a knitting-needle between any two guys with a mawl, are all the high
shots in town, for there is plenty of money around at this time, and many
citizens are very prosperous. Furthermore, I wish to say there are some very
tough guys around the table, too, including guys who will shoot you in the
head, or maybe the stomach, and think nothing whatever about the matter.</p>

<p>In fact, when I see such guys as Harry the Horse, from Brooklyn, and
Sleepout Sam Levinsky, and Lone Louie, from Harlem, I know this is a bad place
for my blood pressure, for these are very tough guys indeed, and are known as
such to one and all in this town.</p>

<p>But there they are wedged up against the table with Nick the Greek, Big Nig,
Grey John, Okay Okun, and many other high shots, and they all have big coarse G
notes in their hands which they are tossing around back and forth as if these G
notes are nothing but pieces of waste paper.</p>

<p>On the outside of the mob at the table are a lot of small operators who are
trying to cram their fists in between the high shots now and then to get down a
bet, and there are also guys present who are called Shylocks, because they will
lend you dough when you go broke at the table, on watches or rings, or maybe
cuff-links, at very good interest.</p>

<p>Well, as I say, there is no room at the table for as many as one more very
thin guy when we walk into the joint, but Rusty Charley lets out a big hello as
we enter, and the guys all look around, and the next minute there is space at
the table big enough not only for Rusty Charley but for me, too. It really is
quite magical the way there is suddenly room for us when there is no room
whatever for anybody when we come in.</p>

<p>'Who is the gunner?' Rusty Charley asks, looking all around.</p>

<p>'Why, you are, Charley,' Big Nig, the stick man in the game, says very
quick, handing Charley a pair of dice, although afterward I hear that his pal
is right in the middle of a roll trying to make nine when we step up to the
table. Everybody is very quiet, just looking at Charley. Nobody pays any
attention to me, because I am known to one and all as a guy who is just around,
and nobody figures me in on any part of Charley, although Harry the Horse looks
at me once in a way that I know is no good for my blood pressure, or for
anybody else's blood pressure as far as this goes.</p>

<p>Well, Charley takes the dice and turns to a little guy in a derby hat who is
standing next to him, scrooching back so Charley will not notice him, and
Charley lifts the derby hat off the little guy's head, and rattles the dice in
his hand and chucks them into the hat and goes 'Hah!' like crap shooters always
do when they are rolling the dice. Then Charley peeks into the hat and says
'Ten,' although he does not let anybody else look in the hat, not even me, so
nobody knows if Charley throws a ten, or what.</p>

<p>But, of course, nobody around is going to up and doubt that Rusty Charley
throws a ten, because Charley may figure it is the same thing as calling him a
liar, and Charley is such a guy as is apt to hate being called a liar.</p>

<p>Now Nathan Detroit's crap game is what is called a head-and-head game,
although some guys call it a fading game, because the guys bet against each
other rather than against the bank, or house. It is just the same kind of game
as when two guys get together and start shooting craps against each other, and
Nathan Detroit does not have to bother with a regular crap table and layout
such as they have in gambling houses. In fact, about all Nathan Detroit has to
do with the game is to find a spot, furnish the dice and take his percentage,
which is by no means bad.</p>

<p>In such a game as this there is no real action until a guy is out on a
point, and then the guys around commence to bet he makes this point, or that he
does not make this point, and the odds in any country in the world that a guy
does not make a ten with a pair of dice before he rolls seven, is 2 to 1.</p>

<p>Well, when Charley says he rolls ten in the derby hat nobody opens their
trap, and Charley looks all around the table, and all of a sudden he sees Jew
Louie at one end, although Jew Louie seems to be trying to shrink himself up
when Charley's eyes light on him.</p>

<p>'I will take the odds for five C's,' Charley says, 'and Louie, you get
it'--meaning he is letting Louie bet him $1000 to $500 that he does not make
his ten.</p>

<p>Now Jew Louie is a small operator at all times and more of a Shylock than he
is a player, and the only reason he is up there against the table at all at
this moment is because he moves up to lend Nick the Greek some dough; and
ordinarily there is no more chance of Jew Louie betting a thousand to five
hundred on any proposition whatever than there is of him giving his dough to
the Salvation Army, which is no chance at all. It is a sure thing he will never
think of betting a thousand to five hundred a guy will not make ten with the
dice, and when Rusty Charley tells Louie he has such a bet, Louie starts
trembling all over.</p>

<p>The others around the table do not say a word, and so Charley rattles the
dice again in his duke, blows on them, and chucks them into the derby hat and
says 'Hah!' But, of course, nobody can see in the derby hat except Charley, and
he peeks in at the dice and says 'Five.' He rattles the dice once more and
chucks them into the derby and says 'Hah!' and then after peeking into the hat
at the dice he says 'Eight.' I am commencing to sweat for fear he may heave a
seven in the hat and blow his bet, and I know Charley has no five C's to payoff
with, although, of course, I also know Charley has no idea of paying off, no
matter what he heaves.</p>

<p>On the next chuck, Charley yells 'Money!'--meaning he finally makes his ten,
although nobody sees it but him; and he reaches out his hand to Jew Louie, and
Jew Louie hands him a big fat G note, very, very slow. In all my life I never
see a sadder-looking guy than Louie when he is parting with his dough. If Louie
has any idea of asking Charley to let him see the dice in the hat to make sure
about the ten, he does not speak about the matter, and as Charley does not seem
to wish to show the ten around, nobody else says anything either, probably
figuring Rusty Charley isn't a guy who is apt to let anybody question his word,
especially over such a small matter as a ten.</p>

<p>'Well,' Charley says, putting Louie's G note in his pocket, 'I think this is
enough for me to-night,' and he hands the derby hat back to the little guy who
owns it and motions me to come on, which I am glad to do, as the silence in the
joint is making my stomach go up and down inside me, and I know this is bad for
my blood pressure. Nobody as much as opens his face from the time we go in
until we start out, and you will be surprised how nervous it makes you to be in
a big crowd with everybody dead still, especially when you figure it a spot
that is liable to get hot any minute. It is only just as we get to the door
that anybody speaks, and who is it but Jew Louie, who pipes up and says to
Rusty Charley like this:</p>

<p>'Charley,' he says, 'do you make it the hard way?'</p>

<p>Well, everybody laughs, and we go on out, but I never hear myself whether
Charley makes his ten with a six and a four, or with two fives--which is the
hard way to make a ten with the dice--although I often wonder about the matter
afterward.</p>

<p>I am hoping that I can now get away from Rusty Charley and go on home,
because I can see he is the last guy in the world to have around a blood
pressure, and, furthermore, that people may get the wrong idea of me if I stick
around with him, but when I suggest going to Charley, he seems to be hurt.</p>

<p>'Why,' Charley says, 'you are a fine guy to be talking of quitting a pal
just as we are starting out. You will certainly stay with me because I like
company, and we will go down to Ikey the Pig's and play stuss. Ikey is an old
friend of mine, and I owe him a complimentary play.'</p>

<p>Now, of course, I do not wish to go to Ikey the Pig's, because it is a place
away downtown, and I do not wish to play stuss, because this is a game which I
am never able to figure out myself, and, furthermore, I remember Doc Brennan
says I ought to get a little sleep now and then; but I see no use in hurting
Charley's feelings, especially as he is apt to do something drastic to me if I
do not go.</p>

<p>So he calls a taxi, and we start downtown for Ikey the Pig's, and the jockey
who is driving the short goes so fast that it makes my blood pressure go up a
foot to a foot and a half from the way I feel inside, although Rusty Charley
pays no attention to the speed. Finally I stick my head out of the window and
ask the jockey to please take it a little easy, as I wish to get where I am
going all in one piece, but the guy only keeps busting along.</p>

<p>We are at the corner of Nineteenth and Broadway when all of a sudden Rusty
Charley yells at the jockey to pull up a minute, which the guy does. Then
Charley steps out of the cab and says to the jockey like this:</p>

<p>'When a customer asks you to take it easy, why do you not be nice and take
it easy? Now see what you get.'</p>

<p>And Rusty Charley hauls off and clips the jockey a punch on the chin that
knocks the poor guy right off the seat into the street, and then Charley climbs
into the seat himself and away we go with Charley driving, leaving the guy
stretched out as stiff as a board. Now Rusty Charley once drives a short for a
living himself, until the coppers get an idea that he is not always delivering
his customers to the right address, especially such as may happen to be drunk
when he gets them, and he is a pretty fair driver, but he only looks one way,
which is straight ahead.</p>

<p>Personally, I never wish to ride with Charley in a taxicab under any
circumstances, especially if he is driving, because he certainly drives very
fast. He pulls up a block from Ikey the Pig's, and says we will leave the short
there until somebody finds it and turns it in, but just as we are walking away
from the short up steps a copper in uniform and claims we cannot park the short
in this spot without a driver.</p>

<p>Well, Rusty Charley just naturally hates to have coppers give him any
advice, so what does he do but peek up and down the street to see if anybody is
looking, and then haul off and clout the copper on the chin, knocking him
bow-legged. I wish to say I never see a more accurate puncher than Rusty
Charley, because he always connects with that old button. As the copper
tumbles, Rusty Charley grabs me by the arm and starts me running up a side
street, and after we go about a block we dodge into Ikey the Pig's.</p>

<p>It is what is called a stuss house, and many prominent citizens of the
neighbourhood are present playing stuss. Nobody seems any too glad to see Rusty
Charley, although Ikey the Pig lets on he is tickled half to death. This Ikey
the Pig is a short fat-necked guy who will look very natural at New Year's,
undressed, and with an apple in his mouth, but it seems he and Rusty Charley
are really old-time friends, and think fairly well of each other in spots.</p>

<p>But I can see that Ikey the Pig is not so tickled when he finds Charley is
there to gamble, although Charley flashes his G note at once, and says he does
not mind losing a little dough to Ikey just for old time's sake. But I judge
Ikey the Pig knows he is never going to handle Charley's G note, because
Charley puts it back in his pocket and it never comes out again even though
Charley gets off loser playing stuss right away.</p>

<p>Well, at five o'clock in the morning, Charley is stuck one hundred and
thirty G's, which is plenty of money even when a guy is playing on his muscle,
and of course Ikey the Pig knows there is no chance of getting one hundred and
thirty cents off of Rusty Charley, let alone that many thousands. Everybody
else is gone by this time and Ikey wishes to close up. He is willing to take
Charley's marker for a million if necessary to get Charley out, but the trouble
is in stuss a guy is entitled to get back a percentage of what he loses, and
Ikey figures Charley is sure to wish this percentage even if he gives a marker,
and the percentage will wreck Ikey's joint.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Rusty Charley says he will not quit loser under such
circumstances because Ikey is his friend, so what happens but Ikey finally
sends out and hires a cheater by the name of Dopey Goldberg, who takes to
dealing the game and in no time he has Rusty Charley even by cheating in Rusty
Charley's favour.</p>

<p>Personally, I do not pay much attention to the play, but grab myself a few
winks of sleep in a chair in a corner, and the rest seems to help my blood
pressure no little. In fact, I am not noticing my blood pressure at all when
Rusty Charley and I get out of Ikey the Pig's, because I figure Charley will
let me go home and I can go to bed. But although it is six o'clock, and coming
on broad daylight when we leave Ikey's, Charley is still full of zing, and
nothing will do him but we must go to a joint that is called the Bohemian
Club.</p>

<p>Well, this idea starts my blood pressure going again, because the Bohemian
Club is nothing but a deadfall where guys and dolls go when there is positively
no other place in town open, and it is run by a guy by the name of Knife
O'Halloran, who comes from down around Greenwich Village and is considered a
very bad character. It is well known to one and all that a guy is apt to lose
his life in Knife O'Halloran's any night, even if he does nothing more than
drink Knife O'Halloran's liquor.</p>

<p>But Rusty Charley insists on going there, so naturally I go with him; and at
first everything is very quiet and peaceful, except that a lot of guys and
dolls in evening clothes, who wind up there after being in night clubs all
night, are yelling in one corner of the joint. Rusty Charley and Knife
O'Halloran are having a drink together out of a bottle which Knife carries in
his pocket, so as not to get it mixed up with the liquor he sells his
customers, and are cutting up old touches of the time when they run with the
Hudson Dusters together, when all of a sudden in comes four coppers in plain
clothes.</p>

<p>Now these coppers are off duty and are meaning no harm to anybody, and are
only wishing to have a dram or two before going home, and the chances are they
will pay no attention to Rusty Charley if he minds his own business, although
of course they know who he is very well indeed and will take great pleasure in
putting the old sleeve on him if they only have a few charges against him,
which they do not. So they do not give him a tumble. But if there is one thing
Rusty Charley hates it is a copper, and he starts eyeing them from the minute
they sit down at a table, and by and by I hear him say to Knife O'Halloran like
this:</p>

<p>'Knife,' Charley says, 'what is the most beautiful sight in the world?' 'I
do not know, Charley,' Knife says. 'What is the most beautiful sight in the
world?' 'Four dead coppers in a row,' Charley says.</p>

<p>Well, at this I personally ease myself over toward the door, because I never
wish to have any trouble with coppers and especially with four coppers, so I do
not see everything that comes off. All I see is Rusty Charley grabbing at the
big foot which one of the coppers kicks at him, and then everybody seems to go
into a huddle, and the guys and dolls in evening dress start squawking, and my
blood pressure goes up to maybe a million.</p>

<p>I get outside the door, but I do not go away at once as anybody with any
sense will do, but stand there listening to what is going on inside, which
seems to be nothing more than a loud noise like ker-bump, ker-bump, ker-bump. I
am not afraid there will be any shooting, because as far as Rusty Charley is
concerned he is too smart to shoot any coppers, which is the worst thing a guy
can do in this town, and the coppers are not likely to start any blasting
because they will not wish it to come out that they are in a joint such as the
Bohemian Club off duty. So I figure they will all just take it out in pulling
and hauling.</p>

<p>Finally the noise inside dies down, and by and by the door opens and out
comes Rusty Charley, dusting himself off here and there with his hands and
looking very much pleased indeed, and through the door before it flies shut
again I catch a glimpse of a lot of guys stretched out on the floor.
Furthermore, I can still hear guys and dolls hollering.</p>

<p>'Well, well,' Rusty Charley says, 'I am commencing to think you take the
wind on me, and am just about to get mad at you, but here you are. Let us go
away from this joint, because they are making so much noise inside you cannot
hear yourself think. Let us go to my joint and make my old woman cook us up
some breakfast, and then we can catch some sleep. A little ham and eggs will
not be bad to take right now.'</p>

<p>Well, naturally ham and eggs are appealing to me no little at this time, but
I do not care to go to Rusty Charley's joint. As far as I am personally
concerned, I have enough of Rusty Charley to do me a long, long time, and I do
not care to enter into his home life to any extent whatever, although to tell
the truth I am somewhat surprised to learn he has any such life. I believe I do
once hear that Rusty Charley marries one of the neighbours' children, and that
he lives somewhere over on Tenth Avenue in the Forties, but nobody really knows
much about this, and everybody figures if it is true his wife must lead a
terrible dog's life.</p>

<p>But while I do not wish to go to Charley's joint, I cannot very well refuse
a civil invitation to eat ham and eggs, especially as Charley is looking at me
in a very much surprised way because I do not seem so glad, and I can see that
it is not everyone that he invites to his joint. So I thank him, and say there
is nothing I will enjoy more than ham and eggs such as his old woman will cook
for us, and by and by we are walking along Tenth Avenue up around Forty-fifth
Street.</p>

<p>It is still fairly early in the morning, and business guys are opening up
their joints for the day, and little children are skipping along the sidewalks
going to school and laughing tee-hee, and old dolls are shaking bedclothes and
one thing and another out of the windows of the tenement houses, but when they
spot Rusty Charley and me everybody becomes very quiet indeed, and I can see
that Charley is greatly respected in his own neighbourhood. The business guys
hurry into their joints, and the little children stop skipping and tee-heeing
and go tip-toeing along, and the old dolls yank in their noodles, and a great
quiet comes to the street. In fact, about all you can hear is the heels of
Rusty Charley and me hitting on the sidewalk.</p>

<p>There is an ice wagon with a couple of horses hitched to it standing in
front of a store, and when he sees the horses Rusty Charley seems to get a big
idea. He stops and looks the horses over very carefully, although as far as I
can see they are nothing but horses, and big and fat, and sleepy-looking
horses, at that. Finally Rusty Charley says to me like this:</p>

<p>'When I am a young guy,' he says, 'I am a very good puncher with my right
hand, and often I hit a horse on the skull with my fist and knock it down. I
wonder,' he says, 'if I lose my punch. The last copper I hit back there gets up
twice on me.'</p>

<p>Then he steps up to one of the ice-wagon horses and hauls off and biffs it
right between the eyes with a right-hand smack that does not travel more than
four inches, and down goes old Mister Horse to his knees looking very much
surprised indeed. I see many a hard puncher in my day including Dempsey when he
really can punch, but I never see a harder punch than Rusty Charley gives this
horse.</p>

<p>Well, the ice-wagon driver comes busting out of the store all heated up over
what happens to his horse, but he cools out the minute he sees Rusty Charley,
and goes on back into the store leaving the horse still taking a count, while
Rusty Charley and I keep walking. Finally we come to the entrance of a tenement
house that Rusty Charley says is where he lives, and in front of this house is
a wop with a push-cart loaded with fruit and vegetables and one thing and
another, which Rusty Charley tips over as we go into the house, leaving the
wop yelling very loud, and maybe cussing us in wop for all I know. I am very
glad, personally, we finally get somewhere, because I can feel that my blood
pressure is getting worse every minute I am with Rusty Charley.</p>

<p>We climb two flights of stairs, and then Charley opens a door and we step
into a room where there is a pretty little red-headed doll about knee high to a
flivver, who looks as if she may just get out of the hay, because her red hair
is flying around every which way on her head, and her eyes seem still gummed up
with sleep. At first I think she is a very cute sight indeed, and then I see
something in her eyes that tells me this doll, whoever she is, is feeling very
hostile to one and all.</p>

<p>'Hello, tootsie,' Rusty Charley says. 'How about some ham and eggs for me
and my pal here? We are all tired out going around and about.'</p>

<p>Well, the little red-headed doll just looks at him without saying a word.
She is standing in the middle of the floor with one hand behind her, and all of
a sudden she brings this hand around, and what does she have in it but a young
baseball bat, such as kids play ball with, and which cost maybe two bits; and
the next thing I know I hear something go ker-bap, and I can see she smacks
Rusty Charley on the side of the noggin with the bat.</p>

<p>Naturally I am greatly horrified at this business, and figure Rusty Charley
will kill her at once, and then I will be in a jam for witnessing the murder
and will be held in jail several years like all witnesses to anything in this
man's town; but Rusty Charley only falls into a big rocking-chair in a corner
of the room and sits there with one hand to his head, saying, 'Now hold on,
tootsie,' and 'Wait a minute there, honey.' I recollect hearing him say, 'We
have company for breakfast,' and then the little red-headed doll turns on me
and gives me a look such as I will always remember, although I smile at her
very pleasant and mention it is a nice morning.</p>

<p>Finally she says to me like this: 'So you are the trambo who keeps my
husband out all night, are you, you trambo?' she says, and with this she starts
for me, and I start for the door; and by this time my blood pressure is all out
of whack, because I can see Mrs. Rusty Charley is excited more than somewhat. I
get my hand on the knob and just then something hits me alongside the noggin,
which I afterward figure must be the baseball bat, although I remember having a
sneaking idea the roof caves in on me.</p>

<p>How I get the door open I do not know, because I am very dizzy in the head
and my legs are wobbling, but when I think back over the situation I remember
going down a lot of steps very fast, and by and by the fresh air strikes me,
and I figure I am in the clear. But all of a sudden I feel another strange
sensation back of my head and something goes plop against my noggin, and I
figure at first that maybe my blood pressure runs up so high that it squirts
out the top of my bean. Then I peek around over my shoulder just once to see
that Mrs. Rusty Charley is standing beside the wop peddler's cart snatching
fruit and vegetables of one kind and another off the cart and chucking them at
me.</p>

<p>But what she hits me with back of the head is not an apple, or a peach, or a
rutabaga, or a cabbage, or even a casaba melon, but a brickbat that the wop has
on his cart to weight down the paper sacks in which he sells his goods. It is
this brickbat which makes a lump on the back of my head so big that Doc Brennan
thinks it is a tumour when I go to him the next day about my stomach, and I
never tell him any different.</p>

<p>'But,' Doc Brennan says, when he takes my blood pressure again, 'your
pressure is down below normal now, and as far as it is concerned you are in no
danger whatever. It only goes to show what just a little bit of quiet living
will do for a guy,' Doc Brennan says. 'Ten bucks, please,' he says.</p>

<h3><a name="The_Bloodhounds_of_Broadway" id="The_Bloodhounds_of_Broadway">The Bloodhounds of Broadway</a></h3>
<p>One morning along about four bells, I am standing in front of Mindy's
restaurant on Broadway with a guy by the name of Regret, who has this name
because it seems he wins a very large bet the year the Whitney filly, Regret,
grabs the Kentucky Derby, and can never forget it, which is maybe because it is
the only very large bet he ever wins in his life.</p>

<p>What this guy's real name is I never hear, and anyway names make no
difference to me, especially on Broadway, because the chances are that no
matter what name a guy has, it is not his square name. So, as far as I am
concerned, Regret is as good a name as any other for this guy I am talking
about, who is a fat guy, and very gabby, though generally he is talking about
nothing but horses, and how he gets beat three dirty noses the day before at
Belmont, or wherever the horses are running.</p>

<p>In all the years I know Regret he must get beat ten thousand noses, and
always they are dirty noses, to hear him tell it. In fact, I never once hear
him say he is beat a clean nose, but of course this is only the way
horse-racing guys talk. What Regret does for a living besides betting on horses
I do not know, but he seems to do pretty well at it, because he is always
around and about, and generally well dressed, and with a lot of big cigars
sticking up out of his vest pocket.</p>

<p>It is generally pretty quiet on Broadway along about four bells in the
morning, because at such an hour the citizens are mostly in speakeasies, and
night clubs, and on this morning I am talking about it is very quiet, indeed,
except for a guy by the name of Marvin Clay hollering at a young doll because
she will not get into a taxicab with him to go to his apartment. But of course
Regret and I do not pay much attention to such a scene, except that Regret
remarks that the young doll seems to have more sense than you will expect to
see in a doll loose on Broadway at four bells in the morning, because it is
well known to one and all that any doll who goes to Marvin Clay's apartment
either has no brains whatever, or wishes to go there.</p>

<p>This Marvin Clay is a very prominent society guy, who is a great hand for
hanging out in night clubs, and he has plenty of scratch which comes down to
him from his old man, who makes it out of railroads and one thing and another.
But Marvin Clay is a most obnoxious character, being loud and ungentlemanly at
all times, on account of having all this scratch, and being always very rough
and abusive with young dolls such as work in night clubs, and who have to stand
for such treatment from Marvin Clay because he is a very good customer.</p>

<p>He is generally in evening clothes, as he is seldom around and about except
in the evening, and he is maybe fifty years old, and has a very ugly mugg,
which is covered with blotches, and pimples, but of course a guy who has so
much scratch as Marvin Clay does not have to be so very handsome, at that, and
he is very welcome indeed wherever he goes on Broadway. Personally, I wish no
part of such a guy as Marvin Clay, although I suppose in my time on Broadway I
must see a thousand guys like him, and there will always be guys like Marvin
Clay on Broadway as long as they have old men to make plenty of scratch out of
railroads to keep them going.</p>

<p>Well, by and by Marvin Clay gets the doll in the taxicab, and away they go,
and it is all quiet again on Broadway, and Regret and I stand there speaking of
this and that, and one thing and another, when along comes a very
strange-looking guy leading two very strange-looking dogs. The guy is so thin I
figure he must be about two pounds lighter than a stack of wheats. He has a
long nose, and a sad face, and he is wearing a floppy old black felt hat, and
he has on a flannel shirt, and baggy corduroy pants, and a seemore coat, which
is a coat that lets you see more hip pockets than coat.</p>

<p>Personally, I never see a stranger-looking guy on Broadway, and I wish to
say I see some very strange-looking guys on Broadway in my day. But if the guy
is strange-looking, the dogs are even stranger-looking because they have big
heads, and jowls that hang down like an old-time faro bank dealer's, and long
ears the size of bed sheets. Furthermore, they have wrinkled faces, and big,
round eyes that seem so sad I half expect to see them bust out crying.</p>

<p>The dogs are a sort of black and yellow in colour, and have long tails, and
they are so thin you can see their ribs sticking out of their hides. I can see
at once that the dogs and the guy leading them can use a few hamburgers very
nicely, but then so can a lot of other guys on Broadway at this time, leaving
out the dogs.</p>

<p>Well, Regret is much interested in the dogs right away, because he is a guy
who is very fond of animals of all kinds, and nothing will do but he must stop
the guy and start asking questions about what sort of dogs they are, and in
fact I am also anxious to hear myself, because while I see many a pooch in my
time I never see anything like these.</p>

<p>'They is bloodhounds,' the sad-looking guy says in a very sad voice, and
with one of these accents such as Southern guys always have. 'They is
man-tracking bloodhounds from Georgia.'</p>

<p>Now of course both Regret and me know what bloodhounds are because we see
such animals chasing Eliza across the ice in Uncle Tom's Cabin when we are
young squirts, but this is the first time either of us meet up with any
bloodhounds personally, especially on Broadway. So we get to talking quite a
bit to the guy, and his story is as sad as his face, and makes us both feel
very sorry for him.</p>

<p>In fact, the first thing we know we have him and the bloodhounds in Mindy's
and are feeding one and all big steaks, although Mindy puts up an awful squawk
about us bringing the dogs in, and asks us what we think he is running, anyway.
When Regret starts to tell him, Mindy says never mind, but not to bring any
more Shetland ponies into his joint again as long as we live.</p>

<p>Well, it seems that the sad-looking guy's name is John Wangle, and he comes
from a town down in Georgia where his uncle is the high sheriff, and one of the
bloodhounds' name is Nip, and the other Tuck, and they are both trained from
infancy to track down guys such as lags who escape from the county pokey, and
bad niggers, and one thing and another, and after John Wangle gets the kinks
out of his belly on Mindy's steaks, and starts talking good, you must either
figure him a high-class liar, or the hounds the greatest man-trackers the world
ever sees.</p>

<p>Now, looking at the dogs after they swallow six big sirloins apiece, and a
lot of matzoths, which Mindy has left over from the Jewish holidays, and a job
lot of goulash from the dinner bill, and some other odds and ends, the best I
can figure them is hearty eaters, because they are now lying down on the floor
with their faces hidden behind their ears, and are snoring so loud you can
scarcely hear yourself think.</p>

<p>How John Wangle comes to be in New York with these bloodhounds is quite a
story, indeed. It seems that a New York guy drifts into John's old home town in
Georgia when the bloodhounds are tracking down a bad nigger, and this guy
figures it will be a wonderful idea to take John Wangle and the dogs to New
York and hire them out to the movies to track down the villains in the
pictures. But when they get to New York, it seems the movies have other
arrangements for tracking down their villains, and the guy runs out of scratch
and blows away, leaving John Wangle and the bloodhounds stranded.</p>

<p>So here John Wangle is with Nip and Tuck in New York, and they are all
living together in one room in a tenement house over in West Forty-ninth
Street, and things are pretty tough with them, because John does not know how
to get back to Georgia unless he walks, and he hears the walking is no good
south of Roanoke.</p>

<p>When I ask him why he does not write to his uncle, the high sheriff down
there in Georgia, John Wangle says there are two reasons, one being that he
cannot write, and the other that his uncle cannot read.</p>

<p>Then I ask him why he does not sell the bloodhounds, and he says it is
because the market for bloodhounds is very quiet in New York, and furthermore
if he goes back to Georgia without the bloodhounds his uncle is apt to knock
his ears down. Anyway, John Wangle says he personally loves Nip and Tuck very
dearly, and in fact he says it is only his great love for them that keeps him
from eating one or the other and maybe both, the past week, when his hunger is
very great indeed.</p>

<p>Well, I never before see Regret so much interested in any situation as he is
in John Wangle and the bloodhounds, but personally I am getting very tired of
them, because the one that is called Nip finally wakes up and starts chewing on
my leg, thinking it is maybe more steak, and when I kick him in the snoot, John
Wangle scowls at me, and Regret says only very mean guys are unkind to dumb
animals.</p>

<p>But to show you that John Wangle and his bloodhounds are not so dumb, they
come moseying along past Mindy's every morning after this at about the same
time, and Regret is always there ready to feed them, although he now has to
take the grub out on the sidewalk, as Mindy will not allow the hounds in the
joint again. Naturally Nip and Tuck become very fond of Regret, but they are by
no means as fond of him as John Wangle, because John is commencing to fat up
very nicely, and the bloodhounds are also taking on weight.</p>

<p>Now what happens but Regret does not show up in front of Mindy's for several
mornings hand running, because it seems that Regret makes a very nice score for
himself one day against the horses, and buys himself a brand-new tuxedo, and
starts stepping out around the night clubs, and especially around Miss Missouri
Martin's Three Hundred Club, where there are many beautiful young dolls who
dance around with no more clothes on them than will make a pad for a crutch,
and it is well known that Regret dearly loves such scenes.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I hear reports around and about of Regret becoming very fond of
a doll by the name of Miss Lovey Lou, who works in Miss Missouri Martin's Three
Hundred Club, and of him getting in some kind of a jam with Marvin Clay over
this doll, and smacking Marvin Clay in the kisser, so I figure Regret is
getting a little simple, as guys who hang around Broadway long enough are bound
to do. Now, when John Wangle and Nip and Tuck come around looking for a
hand-out, there is nothing much doing for them, as nobody else around Mindy's
feels any great interest in bloodhounds, especially such interest as will cause
them to buy steaks, and soon Nip and Tuck are commencing to look very sad
again, and John Wangle is downcast more than somewhat.</p>

<p>It is early morning again, and warm, and a number of citizens are out in
front of Mindy's as usual, breathing the fresh air, when along comes a police
inspector by the name of McNamara, who is a friend of mine, with a bunch of
plain-clothes coppers with him, and Inspector McNamara tells me he is on his
way to investigate a situation in an apartment house over in West Fifty-fourth
Street, about three blocks away, where it seems a guy is shot; and not having
anything else to do, I go with them, although as a rule I do not care to
associate with coppers, because it arouses criticism from other citizens.</p>

<p>Well, who is the guy who is shot but Marvin Clay, and he is stretched out on
the floor of the living-room of his apartment in evening clothes, with his
shirt front covered with blood, and after Inspector McNamara takes a close peek
at him, he sees that Marvin Clay is plugged smack dab in the chest, and that he
seems to be fairly dead. Furthermore, there seems to be no clue whatever to who
does the shooting, and Inspector McNamara says it is undoubtedly a very great
mystery, and will be duck soup for the newspapers, especially as they do not
have a good shooting mystery for several days.</p>

<p>Well, of course all this is none of my business, but all of a sudden I
happen to think of John Wangle and his bloodhounds, and it seems to me it will
be a great opportunity for them, so I say to the Inspector as follows:</p>

<p>'Listen, Mac,' I say, 'there is a guy here with a pair of mantracking
bloodhounds from Georgia who are very expert in tracking down matters such as
this, and,' I say, 'maybe they can track down the rascal who shoots Marvin
Clay, because the trail must be hotter than mustard right now.'</p>

<p>Well, afterwards I hear there is much indignation over my suggestion,
because many citizens feel that the party who shoots Marvin Clay is entitled to
more consideration than being tracked with bloodhounds. In fact, some think the
party is entitled to a medal, but this discussion does not come up until
later.</p>

<p>Anyway, at first the Inspector does not think much of my idea, and the other
coppers are very sceptical, and claim that the best way to do under the
circumstances is to arrest everybody in sight and hold them as material
witnesses for a month or so, but the trouble is there is nobody in sight to
arrest at this time, except maybe me, and the Inspector is a broad-minded guy,
and finally he says all right, bring on the bloodhounds.</p>

<p>So I hasten back to Mindy's, and sure enough John Wangle and Nip and Tuck
are out on the sidewalk peering at every passing face in the hope that maybe
one of these faces will belong to Regret. It is a very pathetic sight, indeed,
but John Wangle cheers up when I explain about Marvin Clay to him, and hurries
back to the apartment house with me so fast that he stretches Nip's neck a
foot, and is pulling Tuck along on his stomach half the time.</p>

<p>Well, when we get back to the apartment, John Wangle leads Nip and Tuck up
to Marvin Clay, and they snuffle him all over, because it seems bloodhounds are
quite accustomed to dead guys. Then John Wangle unhooks their leashes, and
yells something at them, and the hounds begin snuffling all around and about
the joint, with Inspector McNamara and the other coppers watching with great
interest. All of a sudden Nip and Tuck go busting out of the apartment and into
the street, with John Wangle after them, and all the rest of us after John
Wangle. They head across Fifty-fourth Street back to Broadway, and the next
thing anybody knows they are doing plenty of snuffling around in front of
Mindy's.</p>

<p>By and by they take off up Broadway with their snozzles to the sidewalk, and
we follow them very excited, because even the coppers now admit that it seems
to be a sure thing they are red hot on the trail of the party who shoots Marvin
Clay. At first Nip and Tuck are walking, but pretty soon they break into a
lope, and there we are loping after them, John Wangle, the Inspector, and me,
and the coppers.</p>

<p>Naturally, such a sight as this attracts quite some attention as we go along
from any citizens stirring at this hour, and by and by milkmen are climbing
down off their wagons, and scavenger guys are leaving their trucks standing
where they are, and newsboys are dropping everything, and one and all joining
in the chase, so by the time we hit Broadway and Fifty-sixth there is quite a
delegation following the hounds with John Wangle in front, just behind Nip and
Tuck, and yelling at them now and then as follows:</p>

<p>'Hold to it, boys!'</p>

<p>At Fifty-sixth the hounds turn east off Broadway and stop at the door of
what seems to be an old garage, this door being closed very tight, and Nip and
Tuck seem to wish to get through this door, so the Inspector and the coppers
kick the door open, and who is in the garage having a big crap game but many
prominent citizens of Broadway. Naturally, these citizens are greatly
astonished at seeing the bloodhounds, and the rest of us, especially the
coppers, and they start running every which way trying to get out of the joint,
because crap shooting is quite illegal in these parts.</p>

<p>But the Inspector only says Ah-ha, and starts jotting down names in a
note-book as if it is something he will refer to later, and Nip and Tuck are
out of the joint almost as soon as they get in and are snuffling on down
Fifty-sixth. They stop at four more doors in Fifty-sixth Street along, and when
the coppers kick open these doors they find they are nothing but speakeasies,
although one is a hop joint, and the citizens in these places are greatly put
out by the excitement, especially as Inspector McNamara keeps jotting down
things in his note-book.</p>

<p>Finally the Inspector starts glaring very fiercely at the coppers with us,
and anybody can see that he is much displeased to find so much illegality going
on in this district, and the coppers are starting in to hate Nip and Tuck quite
freely, and one copper says to me like this:</p>

<p>'Why,' he says, 'these mutts are nothing but stool pigeons.'</p>

<p>Well, naturally, the noise of John Wangle's yelling, and the gabble of the
mob following the hounds makes quite a disturbance, and arouses many of the
neighbours in the apartment houses and hotels in the side streets, especially
as this is summer, and most everybody has their windows open.</p>

<p>In fact, we see many tousled heads poked out of windows, and hear guys and
dolls inquiring as follows:</p>

<p>'What is going on?'</p>

<p>It seems that when word gets about that bloodhounds are tracking down a
wrongdoer it causes great uneasiness all through the Fifties, and in fact I
afterwards hear that three guys are taken to the Polyclinic suffering with
broken ankles and several bruises from hopping out of windows in the hotels we
pass in the chase, or from falling off of fire-escapes.</p>

<p>Well, all of a sudden Nip and Tuck swing back into Seventh Avenue, and pop
into the entrance of a small apartment house, and go tearing up the stairs to
the first floor, and when we get there these bloodhounds are scratching
vigorously at the door of Apartment B-2, and going woofle-woofle, and we are
all greatly excited, indeed, but the door opens, and who is standing there but
a doll by the name of Maud Milligan, who is well known to one and all as the
ever-loving doll of Big Nig, the crap shooter, who is down in Hot Springs at
this time taking the waters, or whatever it is guys take in Hot Springs.</p>

<p>Now, Maud Milligan is not such a doll as I will care to have any part of,
being red-headed, and very stern, and I am glad Nip and Tuck do not waste any
more time in her apartment than it takes for them to run through her
living-room and across her bed, because Maud is commencing to put the old eye
on such of us present as she happens to know. But Nip and Tuck are in and out
of the joint before you can say scat, because it is only a two-room apartment,
at that, and we are on our way down the stairs and back into Seventh Avenue
again while Inspector McNamara is still jotting down something in his
note-book.</p>

<p>Finally, where do these hounds wind up, with about four hundred citizens
behind them, and everybody perspiring quite freely indeed from the exercise,
but at the door of Miss Missouri Martin's Three Hundred Club, and the doorman,
who is a guy by the name of Soldier Sweeney, tries to shoo them away, but Nip
runs between the Soldier's legs and upsets him, and Tuck steps in the Soldier's
eye in trotting over him, and most of the crowd behind the hounds tread on him
in passing, so the old Soldier is pretty well flattened out at the finish.</p>

<p>Nip and Tuck are now more excited than somewhat, and are going zoople-zoople
in loud voices as they bust into the Three Hundred Club with John Wangle and
the law, and all these citizens behind them. There is a very large crowd
present and Miss Missouri Martin is squatted on the back of a chair in the
middle of the dance floor when we enter, and is about to start her show when
she sees the mob surge in, and at first she is greatly pleased because she
thinks new business arrives, and if there is anything Miss Missouri Martin
dearly loves, it is new business.</p>

<p>But before she can say hello, sucker, or anything else whatever, Nip runs
under her chair, thinking maybe he is a dachshund, and dumps Miss Missouri
Martin on the dance floor, and she lays there squawking no little, while the
next thing anybody knows, Nip and Tuck are over in one corner of the joint, and
are eagerly crawling up and down a fat guy who is sitting there with a doll
alongside of him, and who is the fat guy but Regret!</p>

<p>Well, as Nip and Tuck rush at Regret he naturally gets up to defend himself,
but they both hit him at the same time, and over he goes on top of the doll who
is with him, and who seems to be nobody but Miss Lovey Lou. She is getting
quite a squashing with Regret's heft spread out over her, and she is screaming
quite some, especially when Nip lets out a foot of tongue and washes her
make-up off her face, reaching for Regret. In fact, Miss Lovey Lou seems to be
more afraid of the bloodhounds than she does of being squashed to death, for
when John Wangle and I hasten to her rescue and pull her out from under Regret
she is moaning as follows:</p>

<p>'Oh, do not let them devour me--I will confess.'</p>

<p>Well, as nobody but me and John Wangle seem to hear this crack, because
everybody else is busy trying to split out Regret and the bloodhounds, and as
John Wangle does not seem to understand what Miss Lovey Lou is mumbling about,
I shove her off into the crowd, and on back into the kitchen, which is now
quite deserted, what with all the help being out watching the muss in the
corner, and I say to her like this:</p>

<p>'What is it you confess?' I say. 'Is it about Marvin Clay?'</p>

<p>'Yes,' she says. 'It is about him. He is a pig,' she says. 'I shoot him, and
I am glad of it. He is not satisfied with what he does to me two years ago, but
he tries his deviltry on my baby sister. He has her in his apartment and when I
find it out and go to get her, he says he will not let her go. So I shoot him.
With my brother's pistol,' she says, 'and I take my baby sister home with me,
and I hope he is dead, and gone where he belongs.'</p>

<p>'Well, now,' I say, 'I am not going to give you any argument as to where
Marvin Clay belongs, but,' I say, 'you skip out of here and go on home, and
wait until we can do something about this situation, while I go back and help
Regret, who seems to be in a tough spot.'</p>

<p>'Oh, do not let these terrible dogs eat him up,' she says, and with this she
takes the breeze and I return to the other room to find there is much confusion
indeed, because it seems that Regret is now very indignant at Nip and Tuck,
especially when he discovers that one of them plants his big old paw right on
the front of Regret's shirt bosom, leaving a dirty mark. So when he struggles
to his feet, Regret starts letting go with both hands, and he is by no means a
bad puncher for a guy who does not do much punching as a rule.</p>

<p>In fact, he flattens Nip with a right-hand to the jaw, and knocks Tuck plumb
across the room with a left hook.</p>

<p>Well, poor Tuck slides over the slick dance floor into Miss Missouri Martin
just as she is getting to her feet again, and bowls her over once more, but
Miss Missouri Martin is also indignant by this time, and she gets up and kicks
Tuck in a most unladylike manner. Of course, Tuck does not know so much about
Miss Martin, but he is pretty sure his old friend Regret is only playing with
him, so back he goes to Regret with his tongue out, and his tail wagging, and
there is no telling how long this may go on if John Wangle does not step in and
grab both hounds, while Inspector McNamara puts the arm on Regret and tells him
he is under arrest for shooting Marvin Clay.</p>

<p>Well, of course everybody can see at once that Regret must be the guilty
party all right, especially when it is remembered that he once had trouble with
Marvin Clay, and one and all present are looking at Regret in great disgust,
and saying you can see by his face that he is nothing but a degenerate
type.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Inspector McNamara makes a speech to Miss Missouri Martin's
customers in which he congratulates John Wangle and Nip and Tuck on their
wonderful work in tracking down this terrible criminal and at the same time
putting in a few boosts for the police department, while Regret stands there
paying very little attention to what the Inspector is saying, but trying to
edge himself over close enough to Nip and Tuck to give them the old foot.</p>

<p>Well, the customers applaud what Inspector McNamara says, and Miss Missouri
Martin gets up a collection of over two C's for John Wangle and his hounds, not
counting what she holds out for herself. Also the chef comes forward and takes
John Wangle and Nip and Tuck back into the kitchen and stuffs them full of
food, although personally I will just as soon not have any of the food they
serve in the Three Hundred Club.</p>

<p>They take Regret to the jail-house, and he does not seem to understand why
he is under arrest, but he knows it has something to do with Nip and Tuck and
he tries to bribe one of the coppers to put the bloodhounds in the same cell
with him for awhile, though naturally the copper will not consider such a
proposition.</p>

<p>While Regret is being booked at the jail-house, word comes around that
Marvin Clay is not only not dead, but the chances are he will get well, which
he finally does, at that. Moreover, he finally bails Regret out, and not only
refuses to prosecute him but skips the country as soon as he is able to move,
although Regret lays in the sneezer for several weeks, at that, never letting
on after he learns the real situation that he is not the party who plugs Marvin
Clay. Naturally, Miss Lovey Lou is very grateful to Regret for his wonderful
sacrifice, and will no doubt become his ever-loving wife in a minute, if Regret
thinks to ask her, but it seems Regret finds himself brooding so much over the
idea of an ever-loving wife who is so handy with a Roscoe that he never really
asks.</p>

<p>In the meantime, John Wangle and Nip and Tuck go back to Georgia on the
dough collected by Miss Missouri Martin, and with a big reputation as
man-trackers. So this is all there is to the story, except that one night I run
into Regret with a suit-case in his hand, and he is perspiring very freely,
although it is not so hot, at that, and when I ask him if he is going away, he
says this is indeed his general idea. Moreover, he says he is going very far
away. Naturally, I ask him why this is, and Regret says to me as follows:</p>

<p>'Well,' he says, 'ever since Big Nig, the crap shooter, comes back from Hot
Springs, and hears how the bloodhounds track the shooter of Marvin Clay, he is
walking up and down looking at me out of the corner of his eye. In fact,'
Regret says, 'I can see that Big Nig is studying something over in his mind,
and while Big Nig is a guy who is not such a fast thinker as others, I am
afraid he may finally think himself to a bad conclusion.</p>

<p>'I am afraid,' Regret says, 'that Big Nig will think himself to the
conclusion that Nip and Tuck are tracking me instead of the shooter, as many
evil-minded guys are already whispering around and about, and that he may get
the wrong idea about the trail leading to Maud Milligan's door.'</p>

<h3><a name="Tobias_the_Terrible" id="Tobias_the_Terrible">Tobias the Terrible</a></h3>
<p>One night I am sitting in Mindy's restaurant on Broadway partaking heartily
of some Hungarian goulash which comes very nice in Mindy's, what with the chef
being personally somewhat Hungarian himself, when in pops a guy who is a
stranger to me and sits down at my table.</p>

<p>I do not pay any attention to the guy at first as I am busy looking over the
entries for the next day at Laurel, but I hear him tell the waiter to bring him
some goulash, too. By and by I hear the guy making a strange noise and I look
at him over my paper and see that he is crying. In fact, large tears are
rolling down his face into his goulash and going plop-plop as they fall.</p>

<p>Now it is by no means usual to see guys crying in Mindy's restaurant, though
thousands of guys come in there who often feel like crying, especially after a
tough day at the track, so I commence weighing the guy up with great interest.
I can see he is a very little guy, maybe a shade over five feet high and
weighing maybe as much as a dime's worth of liver, and he has a moustache like
a mosquito's whiskers across his upper lip, and pale blond hair and a very sad
look in his eyes.</p>

<p>Furthermore, he is a young guy and he is wearing a suit of clothes the
colour of French mustard, with slanting pockets, and I notice when he comes in
that he has a brown hat sitting jack-deuce on his noggin. Anybody can see that
this guy does not belong in these parts, with such a sad look and especially
with such a hat.</p>

<p>Naturally, I figure his crying is some kind of a dodge. In fact, I figure
that maybe the guy is trying to cry me out of the price of his Hungarian
goulash, although if he takes the trouble to ask anybody before he comes in, he
will learn that he may just as well try to cry Al Smith out of the Empire State
Building.</p>

<p>But the guy does not say anything whatever to me but just goes on shedding
tears into his goulash, and finally I get very curious about this proposition,
and I speak to him as follows:</p>

<p>'Listen, pally,' I say, 'if you are crying about the goulash, you better dry
your tears before the chef sees you, because,' I say, 'the chef is very
sensitive about his goulash, and may take your tears as criticism.'</p>

<p>'The goulash seems all right,' the guy says in a voice that is just about
his size. 'Anyway, I am not crying about the goulash. I am crying about my sad
life. Friend,' the guy says, 'are you ever in love?'</p>

<p>Well, of course, at this crack I know what is eating the guy. If I have all
the tears that are shed on Broadway by guys in love, I will have enough salt
water to start an opposition ocean to the Atlantic and Pacific, with enough
left over to run the Great Salt Lake out of business. But I wish to say I never
shed any of these tears personally, because I am never in love, and
furthermore, barring a bad break, I never expect to be in love, for the way I
look at it, love is strictly the old phedinkus, and I tell the little guy as
much. 'Well,' he says, 'you will not speak so harshly of love if you are
acquainted with Miss Deborah Weems.'</p>

<p>With this he starts crying more than somewhat, and his grief is such that it
touches my heart and I have half a notion to start crying with him as I am now
convinced that the guy is levelling with his tears.</p>

<p>Finally the guy slacks up a little in his crying, and begins eating his
goulash, and by and by he seems more cheerful, but then it is well known to one
and all that a fair dose of Mindy's goulash will cheer up anybody no matter how
sad they feel. Pretty soon the guy starts talking to me, and I make out that
his name is Tobias Tweeney, and that he comes from a spot over in Bucks County,
Pennsylvania, by the name of Erasmus, or some such.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I judge that this Erasmus is not such a large city, but very
pleasant, and that Tobias Tweeney is born and raised there and is never much of
any place else in his life, although he is now rising twenty-five.</p>

<p>Well, it seems that Tobias Tweeney has a fine position in a shoe store
selling shoes and is going along all right when he happens to fall in love with
a doll by the name of Miss Deborah Weems, whose papa owns a gas station in
Erasmus and is a very prominent citizen. I judge from what Tobias tells me that
this Miss Deborah Weems tosses him around quite some, which proves to me that
dolls in small towns are just the same as they are on Broadway.</p>

<p>'She is beautiful,' Tobias Tweeney says, speaking of Miss Deborah Weems. 'I
do not think I can live without her. But,' he says, 'Miss Deborah Weems will
have no part of me because she is daffy over desperate characters of the
underworld such as she sees in the movies at the Model Theatre in Erasmus.</p>

<p>'She wishes to know,' Tobias Tweeney says, 'why I cannot be a big gunman and
go around plugging people here and there and talking up to politicians and
policemen, and maybe looking picturesque and romantic like Edward G. Robinson
or James Cagney or even Georgie Raft. But, of course,' Tobias says, 'I am not
the type for such a character. Anyway,' he says, 'Constable Wendell will never
permit me to be such a character in Erasmus.</p>

<p>'So Miss Deborah Weems says I have no more nerve than a catfish,' Tobias
says, 'and she goes around with a guy by the name of Joe Trivett, who runs the
Smoke Shop, and bootlegs ginger extract to the boys in his back room and claims
Al Capone once says "Hello" to him, although,' Tobias says, 'personally, I
think Joe Trivett is nothing but a great big liar.'</p>

<p>At this, Tobias Tweeney starts crying again, and I feel very sorry for him
indeed, because I can see he is a friendly, harmless little fellow, and by no
means accustomed to being tossed around by a doll, and a guy who is not
accustomed to being tossed around by a doll always finds it most painful the
first time.</p>

<p>'Why,' I say, very indignant, 'this Miss Deborah Weems talks great
foolishness, because big gunmen always wind up nowadays with the score nine to
nought against them, even in the movies. In fact,' I say, 'if they do not wind
up this way in the movies, the censors will not permit the movies to be
displayed. Why do you not hit this guy Trivett a punch in the snoot,' I say,
'and tell him to go on about his business?'</p>

<p>'Well,' Tobias says, 'the reason I do not hit him a punch in the snoot is
because he has the idea of punching snoots first, and whose snoot does he punch
but mine. Furthermore,' Tobias says, 'he makes my snoot bleed with the punch,
and he says he will do it again if I keep hanging around Miss Deborah Weems.
And,' Tobias says, 'it is mainly because I do not return the punch, being too
busy stopping my snoot from bleeding, that Miss Deborah Weems renounces me for
ever.</p>

<p>'She says she can never stand for a guy who has no more nerve than me,'
Tobias says, 'but,' he says, 'I ask you if I am to blame if my mother is
frightened by a rabbit a few weeks before I am born, and marks me for life?</p>

<p>'So I leave town,' Tobias says. 'I take my savings of two hundred dollars
out of the Erasmus bank, and I come here, figuring maybe I will meet up with
some big gunmen and other desperate characters of the underworld, and get to
know them, and then I can go back to Erasmus and make Joe Trivett look sick. By
the way,' he says, 'do you know any desperate characters of the
underworld?'</p>

<p>Well, of course I do not know any such characters, and if I do know them I
am not going to speak about it, because the best a guy can get in this town if
he goes around speaking of these matters is a nice kick in the pants. So I say
no to Tobias Tweeney, and tell him I am more or less of a stranger myself, and
then he wishes to know if I can show him a tough joint, such as he sees in the
movies.</p>

<p>Naturally, I do not know of such a joint, but then I get to thinking about
Good Time Charley's little Gingham Shoppe over in Forty-seventh Street, and how
Charley is not going so good the last time I am in there, and here is maybe a
chance for me to steer a little trade his way, because, after all, guys with
two yards in their pocket are by no means common nowadays.</p>

<p>So I take Tobias Tweeney around to Good Time Charley's, but the moment we
get in there I am sorry we go, because who is present but a dozen parties from
different parts of the city, and none of these parties are any bargain at any
time. Some of these parties, such as Harry the Horse and Angie the Ox, are from
Brooklyn, and three are from Harlem, including Little Mitzi and Germany
Schwartz, and several are from the Bronx, because I recognize Joey Uptown, and
Joey never goes around without a few intimate friends from his own
neighbourhood with him.</p>

<p>Afterwards I learn that these parties are to a meeting on business matters
at a spot near Good Time Charley's, and when they get through with their
business they drop in to give Charley a little complimentary play, for Charley
stands very good with one and all in this town. Anyway, they are sitting around
a table when Tobias Tweeney and I arrive, and I give them all a big hello, and
they hello me back, and ask me and my friend to sit down as it seems they are
in a most hospitable frame of mind.</p>

<p>Naturally I sit down because it is never good policy to decline an
invitation from parties such as these, and I motion Tobias to sit down, too,
and I introduce Tobias all around, and we all have a couple of drinks, and then
I explain to those present just who Tobias is, and how his ever-loving doll
tosses him around, and how Joe Trivett punches him in the snoot.</p>

<p>Well, Tobias begins crying again, because no inexperienced guy can take a
couple of drinks of Good Time Charley's liquor and not bust out crying, even if
it is Charley's company liquor, and one and all are at once very sympathetic
with Tobias, especially Little Mitzi, who is just tossed around himself more
than somewhat by a doll. In fact, Little Mitzi starts crying with him.</p>

<p>'Why,' Joey Uptown says, 'I never hear of a greater outrage in my life,
although,' he says, 'I can see there is some puppy in you at that, when you do
not return this Trivett's punch. But even so,' Joey says, 'if I have time I
will go back to this town you speak of with you and make the guy hard to catch.
Furthermore,' he says, 'I will give this Miss Deborah Weems a piece of my
mind.'</p>

<p>Then I tell them how Tobias Tweeney comes to New York figuring he may meet
up with some desperate characters of the underworld, and they hear this with
great interest, and Angie the Ox speaks as follows: 'I wonder,' Angie says, 'if
we can get in touch with anybody who knows such characters and arrange to have
Mr. Tweeney meet them, although personally,' Angie says, 'I loathe and despise
characters of this nature.'</p>

<p>Well, while Angie is wondering this there comes a large knock at the front
door, and it is such a knock as only the gendarmes can knock, and everybody at
the table jumps up. Good Time Charley goes to the door and takes a quiet gander
through his peep-hole and we hear a loud, coarse voice speaking as follows:</p>

<p>'Open up, Charley,' the voice says. 'We wish to look over your guests.
Furthermore,' the voice says, 'tell them not to try the back door, because we
are there, too.'</p>

<p>'It is Lieutenant Harrigan and his squad,' Charley says as he comes back to
the table where we are all standing. 'Someone must tip him off you are here.
Well,' Charley says, 'those who have rods to shed will shed them now.'</p>

<p>At this, Joey Uptown steps up to Tobias Tweeney and hands him a large Betsy
and says to Tobias like this:</p>

<p>'Put this away on you somewhere,' Joey says, 'and then sit down and be
quiet. These coppers are not apt to bother with you,' Joey says, 'if you sit
still and mind your own business, but,' Joey says, 'it will be very tough on
any of us they find with a rod, especially any of us who owe the state any
time, and,' Joey says, 'I seem to remember I owe some.'</p>

<p>Now of course what Joey says is very true, because he is only walking around
and about on parole, and some of the others present are walking around the same
way, and it is a very serious matter for a guy who is walking around on parole
to be caught with a John Roscoe in his pocket. So it is a very ticklish
situation, and somewhat embarrassing.</p>

<p>Well, Tobias Tweeney is somewhat dazed by his couple of drinks of Good Time
Charley's liquor and the chances are he does not realize what is coming off, so
he takes Joey's rod and puts it in his hip kick. Then all of a sudden Harry the
Horse and Angie the Ox and Little Mitzi, and all the others step up to him and
hand him their Roscoes and Tobias Tweeney somehow manages to stow the guns away
on himself and sit down before Good Time Charley opens the door and in come the
gendarmes.</p>

<p>By this time Joey Uptown and all the others are scattered at different
tables around the room, with no more than three at any one table, leaving
Tobias Tweeney and me alone at the table where we are first sitting.
Furthermore, everybody is looking very innocent indeed, and all hands seem
somewhat surprised at the intrusion of the gendarmes, who are all young guys
belonging to Harrigan's Broadway squad, and very rude.</p>

<p>I know Harrigan by sight, and I know most of his men, and they know there is
no more harm in me than there is in a two-year-old baby, so they pay no
attention to me whatever, or to Tobias Tweeney, either, but go around making
Joey Uptown, and Angie the Ox, and all the others stand up while the gendarmes
fan them to see if they have any rods on them, because these gendarmes are
always laying for parties such as these hoping to catch them rodded up.</p>

<p>Naturally the gendarmes do not find any rods on anybody, because the rods
are all on Tobias Tweeney, and no gendarme is going to fan Tobias Tweeney
looking for a rod after one gander at Tobias, especially at this particular
moment, as Tobias is now half-asleep from Good Time Charley's liquor, and has
no interest whatever in anything that is going on. In fact, Tobias is nodding
in his chair.</p>

<p>Of course the gendarmes are greatly disgusted at not finding any rods, and
Angie the Ox and Joey Uptown are telling them that they are going to see their
aldermen and find out if law-abiding citizens can be stood up and fanned for
rods, and put in a very undignified position like this, but the gendarmes do
not seem disturbed by these threats, and Lieutenant Harrigan states as
follows:</p>

<p>'Well,' he says, 'I guess maybe I get a bum steer, but,' he says, 'for two
cents I will give all you wrong gees a good going-over just for luck.'</p>

<p>Of course this is no way to speak to parties such as these, as they are all
very prominent in their different parts of the city, but Lieutenant Harrigan is
a guy who seldom cares how he talks to anybody. In fact, Lieutenant Harrigan is
a very tough copper.</p>

<p>But he is just about to take his gendarmes out of the joint when Tobias
Tweeney nods a little too far forward in his chair, and then all of a sudden
topples over on the floor, and five large rods pop out of his pockets and go
sliding every which way around the floor, and the next thing anybody knows
there is Tobias Tweeney under arrest with all the gendarmes holding on to some
part of him.</p>

<p>Well, the next day the newspapers are plumb full of the capture of a guy
they call Twelve-Gun Tweeney, and the papers say the police state that this is
undoubtedly the toughest guy the world ever sees, because while they hear of
two-gun guys, and even three-gun guys, they never before hear of a guy going
around rodded up with twelve guns.</p>

<p>The gendarmes say they can tell by the way he acts that Twelve-Gun Tweeney
is a mighty bloodthirsty guy, because he says nothing whatever but only glares
at them with a steely glint in his eyes, although of course the reason Tobias
stares at them is because he is still too dumbfounded to think of anything to
say.</p>

<p>Naturally, I figure that when Tobias comes up for air he is a sure thing to
spill the whole business, and all the parties who are in Good Time Charley's
when he is arrested figure the same way, and go into retirement for a time. But
it seems that when Tobias finally realizes what time it is, he is getting so
much attention that it swells him all up and he decides to keep on being
Twelve-Gun Tweeney as long as he can, which is a decision that is a very nice
break for all parties concerned.</p>

<p>I sneak down to Judge Rascover's court the day Tobias is arraigned on a
charge of violation of the Sullivan law, which is a law against carrying rods,
and the courtroom is packed with citizens eager to see a character desperate
enough to lug twelve rods, and among these citizens are many dolls, pulling and
hauling for position, and some of these dolls are by no means crows. Many
photographers are hanging around to take pictures of Twelve-Gun Tweeney as he
is led in handcuffed to gendarmes on either side of him, and with other
gendarmes in front and behind him.</p>

<p>But one and all are greatly surprised and somewhat disappointed when they
see what a little squirt Tobias is, and Judge Rascover looks down at him once,
and then puts on his specs and takes another gander as if he does not believe
what he sees in the first place. After looking at Tobias awhile through his
specs, and shaking his head as if he is greatly puzzled, Judge Rascover speaks
to Lieutenant Harrigan as follows:</p>

<p>'Do you mean to tell this court,' Judge Rascover says, 'that this
half-portion here is the desperate Twelve-Gun Tweeney?'</p>

<p>Well, Lieutenant Harrigan says there is no doubt whatever about it, and
Judge Rascover wishes to know how Tobias carries all these rods, and
whereabouts, so Lieutenant Harrigan collects twelve rods from the gendarmes
around the courtroom, unloads these rods, and starts in putting the guns here
and there on Tobias as near as he can remember where they are found on him in
the first place, with Tobias giving him a little friendly assistance.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Harrigan puts two guns in each of the side pockets of Tobias's
coat, one in each hip pocket, one in the waistband of Tobias's pants, one in
each side pocket of the pants, one up each of Tobias's sleeves, and one in the
inside pocket of Tobias's coat. Then Lieutenant Harrigan states to the court
that he is all finished, and that Tobias is rodded up in every respect as when
they put the arm on him in Good Time Charley's joint, and Judge Rascover speaks
to Tobias as follows:</p>

<p>'Step closer to the bench,' Judge Rascover says. 'I wish to see for myself
just what kind of a villain you are.'</p>

<p>Well, Tobias takes a step forward, and over he goes on his snoot, so I see
right away what it is makes him keel over in Good Time Charley's joint, not
figuring in Charley's liquor. The little guy is naturally top-heavy from the
rods.</p>

<p>Now there is much confusion as he falls and a young doll who seems to be
fatter than somewhat comes shoving through the crowd in the courtroom yelling
and crying, and though the gendarmes try to stop her she gets to Tobias and
kneels at his side, and speaks as follows:</p>

<p>'Toby, darling,' she says, 'it is nobody but Deborah who loves you dearly,
and who always knows you will turn out to be the greatest gunman of them all.
Look at me, Toby,' she says, 'and tell me you love me, too. We never realize
what a hero you are until we get the New York papers in Erasmus last night, and
I hurry to you as quickly as possible. Kiss me, Toby,' the fat young doll says,
and Tobias raises up on one elbow and does same, and it makes a very pleasing
scene, indeed, although the gendarmes try to pull them apart, having no
patience whatever with such matters.</p>

<p>Now Judge Rascover is watching all this business through his specs, and
Judge Rascover is no sucker, but a pretty slick old codger for a judge, and he
can see that there is something wrong somewhere about Tobias Tweeney being a
character as desperate as the gendarmes make him out, especially when he sees
that Tobias cannot pack all these rods on a bet.</p>

<p>So when the gendarmes pick the fat young doll off of Tobias and take a few
pounds of rods off of Tobias, too, so he is finally able to get back on his
pins and stand there, Judge Rascover adjourns court, and takes Tobias into his
private room and has a talk with him, and the chances are Tobias tells him the
truth, for the next thing anybody knows Tobias is walking away as free as the
little birdies in the trees, except that he has the fat young doll clinging to
him like a porous plaster, so maybe Tobias is not so free, at that.</p>

<p>Well, this is about all there is to the story, except that there is
afterwards plenty of heat between the parties who are present in Good Time
Charley's joint when Tobias is collared, because it seems that the meeting they
all attend before going to Charley's is supposed to be a peace meeting of some
kind and nobody is supposed to carry any rods to this meeting just to prove
their confidence in each other, so everybody is very indignant when it comes
out that nobody has any confidence in anybody else at the meeting.</p>

<p>I never hear of Tobias Tweeney but once after all this, and it is some
months afterwards when Joey Uptown and Little Mitzi are over in Pennsylvania
inspecting a brewery proposition, and finding themselves near the town that is
called Erasmus, they decide it will be a nice thing to drop in on Tobias
Tweeney and see how he is getting along.</p>

<p>Well, it seems Tobias is all married up to Miss Deborah Weems, and is
getting along first class, as it seems the town elects him constable, because
it feels that a guy with such a desperate reputation as Tobias Tweeney's is
bound to make wrongdoers keep away from Erasmus if he is an officer of the law,
and Tobias's first official act is to chase Joe Trivett out of town.</p>

<p>But along Broadway Tobias Tweeney will always be considered nothing but an
ingrate for heaving Joey Uptown and Little Mitzi into the town sneezer and
getting them fined fifty bobs apiece for carrying concealed weapons.</p>

<h3><a name="The_Snatching_of_Bookie_Bob" id="The_Snatching_of_Bookie_Bob">The Snatching of Bookie Bob</a></h3>
<p>Now it comes on the spring of 1931, after a long hard winter, and times are
very tough indeed, what with the stock market going all to pieces, and banks
busting right and left, and the law getting very nasty about this and that, and
one thing and another, and many citizens of this town are compelled to do the
best they can.</p>

<p>There is very little scratch anywhere and along Broadway many citizens are
wearing their last year's clothes and have practically nothing to bet on the
races or anything else, and it is a condition that will touch anybody's
heart.</p>

<p>So I am not surprised to hear rumours that the snatching of certain parties
is going on in spots, because while snatching is by no means a high-class
business, and is even considered somewhat illegal, it is something to tide over
the hard times.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I am not surprised to hear that this snatching is being done by
a character by the name of Harry the Horse, who comes from Brooklyn, and who is
a character who does not care much what sort of business he is in, and who is
mobbed up with other characters from Brooklyn such as Spanish John and Little
Isadore, who do not care what sort of business they are in, either.</p>

<p>In fact, Harry the Horse and Spanish John and Little Isadore are very hard
characters in every respect, and there is considerable indignation expressed
around and about when they move over from Brooklyn into Manhattan and start
snatching, because the citizens of Manhattan feel that if there is any
snatching done in their territory, they are entitled to do it themselves.</p>

<p>But Harry the Horse and Spanish John and Little Isadore pay no attention
whatever to local sentiment and go on the snatch on a pretty fair scale, and by
and by I am hearing rumours of some very nice scores. These scores are not
extra large scores, to be sure, but they are enough to keep the wolf from the
door, and in fact from three different doors, and before long Harry the Horse
and Spanish John and Little Isadore are around the race-tracks betting on the
horses, because if there is one thing they are all very fond of, it is betting
on the horses.</p>

<p>Now many citizens have the wrong idea entirely of the snatching business.
Many citizens think that all there is to snatching is to round up the party who
is to be snatched and then just snatch him, putting him away somewhere until
his family or friends dig up enough scratch to pay whatever price the snatchers
are asking. Very few citizens understand that the snatching business must be
well organized and very systematic.</p>

<p>In the first place, if you are going to do any snatching, you cannot snatch
just anybody. You must know who you are snatching, because naturally it is no
good snatching somebody who does not have any scratch to settle with. And you
cannot tell by the way a party looks or how he lives in this town if he has any
scratch, because many a party who is around in automobiles, and wearing good
clothes, and chucking quite a swell is nothing but the phonus bolonus and does
not have any real scratch whatever.</p>

<p>So of course such a party is no good for snatching, and of course guys who
are on the snatch cannot go around inquiring into bank accounts, or asking how
much this and that party has in a safe-deposit vault, because such questions
are apt to make citizens wonder why, and it is very dangerous to get citizens
to wondering why about anything. So the only way guys who are on the snatch can
find out about parties worth snatching is to make a connection with some guy
who can put the finger on the right party.</p>

<p>The finger guy must know the party he fingers has plenty of ready scratch to
begin with, and he must also know that this party is such a party as is not apt
to make too much disturbance about being snatched, such as telling the
gendarmes. The party may be a legitimate party, such as a business guy, but he
will have reasons why he does not wish it to get out that he is snatched, and
the finger must know these reasons. Maybe the party is not leading the right
sort of life, such as running around with blondes when he has an ever-loving
wife and seven children in Mamaroneck, but does not care to have his habits
known, as is apt to happen if he is snatched, especially if he is snatched when
he is with a blonde.</p>

<p>And sometimes the party is such a party as does not care to have matches run
up and down the bottom of his feet, which often happens to parties who are
snatched and who do not seem to wish to settle their bill promptly, because
many parties are very ticklish on the bottom of the feet, especially if the
matches are lit. On the other hand maybe the party is not a legitimate guy,
such as a party who is running a crap game or a swell speakeasy, or who has
some other dodge he does not care to have come out, and who also does not care
about having his feet tickled.</p>

<p>Such a party is very good indeed for the snatching business, because he is
pretty apt to settle without any argument. And after a party settles one
snatching, it will be considered very unethical for anybody else to snatch him
again very soon, so he is not likely to make any fuss about the matter. The
finger guy gets a commission of twenty-five per cent. of the settlement, and
one and all are satisfied and much fresh scratch comes into circulation, which
is very good for the merchants. And while the party who is snatched may know
who snatches him, one thing he never knows is who puts the finger on him, this
being considered a trade secret.</p>

<p>I am talking to Waldo Winchester, the newspaper scribe, one night and
something about the snatching business comes up, and Waldo Winchester is trying
to tell me that it is one of the oldest dodges in the world, only Waldo calls
it kidnapping, which is a title that will be very repulsive to guys who are on
the snatch nowadays. Waldo Winchester claims that hundreds of years ago guys
are around snatching parties, male and female, and holding them for ransom, and
furthermore Waldo Winchester says they even snatch very little children and
Waldo states that it is all a very, very wicked proposition.</p>

<p>Well, I can see where Waldo is right about it being wicked to snatch dolls
and little children, but of course no guys who are on the snatch nowadays will
ever think of such a thing, because who is going to settle for a doll in these
times when you can scarcely even give them away? As for little children, they
are apt to be a great nuisance, because their mammas are sure to go running
around hollering bloody murder about them, and furthermore little children are
very dangerous, indeed, what with being apt to break out with measles and mumps
and one thing and another any minute and give it to everybody in the
neighbourhood.</p>

<p>Well, anyway, knowing that Harry the Horse and Spanish John and Little
Isadore are now on the snatch, I am by no means pleased to see them come along
one Tuesday evening when I am standing at the corner of Fiftieth and Broadway,
although of course I give them a very jolly hello, and say I hope and trust
they are feeling nicely.</p>

<p>They stand there talking to me a few minutes, and I am very glad indeed that
Johnny Brannigan, the strong-arm cop, does not happen along and see us, because
it will give Johnny a very bad impression of me to see me in such company, even
though I am not responsible for the company. But naturally I cannot haul off
and walk away from this company at once, because Harry the Horse and Spanish
John and Little Isadore may get the idea that I am playing the chill for them,
and will feel hurt.</p>

<p>'Well,' I say to Harry the Horse, 'how are things going, Harry?'</p>

<p>'They are going no good,' Harry says. 'We do not beat a race in four days.
In fact,' he says, 'we go overboard to-day. We are washed out. We owe every
bookmaker at the track that will trust us, and now we are out trying to raise
some scratch to pay off. A guy must pay his bookmaker no matter what.'</p>

<p>Well, of course this is very true, indeed, because if a guy does not pay his
bookmaker it will lower his business standing quite some, as the bookmaker is
sure to go around putting the blast on him, so I am pleased to hear Harry the
Horse mention such honourable principles.</p>

<p>'By the way,' Harry says, 'do you know a guy by the name of Bookie Bob?'</p>

<p>Now I do not know Bookie Bob personally, but of course I know who Bookie Bob
is, and so does everybody else in this town that ever goes to a race-track,
because Bookie Bob is the biggest bookmaker around and about, and has plenty of
scratch. Furthermore, it is the opinion of one and all that Bookie Bob will die
with this scratch, because he is considered a very close guy with his scratch.
In fact, Bookie Bob is considered closer than a dead heat.</p>

<p>He is a short fat guy with a bald head, and his head is always shaking a
little from side to side, which some say is a touch of palsy, but which most
citizens believe comes of Bookie Bob shaking his head 'No' to guys asking for
credit in betting on the races. He has an ever-loving wife, who is a very quiet
little old doll with grey hair and a very sad look in her eyes, but nobody can
blame her for this when they figure that she lives with Bookie Bob for many
years.</p>

<p>I often see Bookie Bob and his ever-loving wife eating in different joints
along in the Forties, because they seem to have no home except an hotel, and
many a time I hear Bookie Bob giving her a going-over about something or other,
and generally it is about the price of something she orders to eat, so I judge
Bookie Bob is as tough with his ever-loving wife about scratch as he is with
everybody else. In fact, I hear him bawling her out one night because she has
on a new hat which she says cost her six bucks, and Bookie Bob wishes to know
if she is trying to ruin him with her extravagances.</p>

<p>But of course I am not criticizing Bookie Bob for squawking about the hat,
because for all I know six bucks may be too much for a doll to pay for a hat,
at that. And furthermore, maybe Bookie Bob has the right idea about keeping
down his ever-loving wife's appetite, because I know many a guy in this town
who is practically ruined by dolls eating too much on him.</p>

<p>'Well,' I say to Harry the Horse, 'if Bookie Bob is one of the bookmakers
you owe, I am greatly surprised to see that you seem to have both eyes in your
head, because I never before hear of Bookie Bob letting anybody owe him without
giving him at least one of their eyes for security. In fact,' I say, 'Bookie
Bob is such a guy as will not give you the right time if he has two
watches.'</p>

<p>'No,' Harry the Horse says, 'we do not owe Bookie Bob. But,' he says, 'he
will be owing us before long. We are going to put the snatch on Bookie
Bob.'</p>

<p>Well, this is most disquieting news to me, not because I care if they snatch
Bookie Bob or not, but because somebody may see me talking to them who will
remember about it when Bookie Bob is snatched. But of course it will not be
good policy for me to show Harry the Horse and Spanish John and Little Isadore
that I am nervous, so I only speak as follows:</p>

<p>'Harry,' I say, 'every man knows his own business best, and I judge you know
what you are doing. But,' I say, 'you are snatching a hard guy when you snatch
Bookie Bob. A very hard guy, indeed. In fact,' I say, 'I hear the softest thing
about him is his front teeth, so it may be very difficult for you to get him to
settle after you snatch him.'</p>

<p>'No,' Harry the Horse says, 'we will have no trouble about it. Our finger
gives us Bookie Bob's hole card, and it is a most surprising thing, indeed.
But,' Harry the Horse says, 'you come upon many surprising things in human
nature when you are on the snatch. Bookie Bob's hole card is his ever-loving
wife's opinion of him.</p>

<p>'You see,' Harry the Horse says, 'Bookie Bob has been putting himself away
with his ever-loving wife for years as a very important guy in this town, with
much power and influence, although of course Bookie Bob knows very well he
stands about as good as a broken leg. In fact,' Harry the Horse says, 'Bookie
Bob figures that his ever-loving wife is the only one in the world who looks on
him as a big guy, and he will sacrifice even his scratch, or anyway some of it,
rather than let her know that guys have such little respect for him as to put
the snatch on him. It is what you call psychology,' Harry the Horse says.</p>

<p>Well, this does not make good sense to me, and I am thinking to myself that
the psychology that Harry the Horse really figures to work out nice on Bookie
Bob is tickling his feet with matches, but I am not anxious to stand there
arguing about it, and pretty soon I bid them all good evening, very polite, and
take the wind, and I do not see Harry the Horse or Spanish John or Little
Isadore again for a month.</p>

<p>In the meantime, I hear gossip here and there that Bookie Bob is missing for
several days, and when he finally shows up again he gives it out that he is
very sick during his absence, but I can put two and two together as well as
anybody in this town and I figure that Bookie Bob is snatched by Harry the
Horse and Spanish John and Little Isadore, and the chances are it costs him
plenty.</p>

<p>So I am looking for Harry the Horse and Spanish John and Little Isadore to
be around the race-track with plenty of scratch and betting them higher than a
cat's back, but they never show up, and what is more I hear they leave
Manhattan, and are back in Brooklyn working every day handling beer. Naturally
this is very surprising to me, because the way things are running beer is a
tough dodge just now, and there is very little profit in same, and I figure
that with the scratch they must make off Bookie Bob, Harry the Horse and
Spanish John and Little Isadore have a right to be taking things easy.</p>

<p>Now one night I am in Good Time Charley Bernstein's little speak in
Forty-eighth Street, talking of this and that with Charley, when in comes Harry
the Horse, looking very weary and by no means prosperous. Naturally I give him
a large hello, and by and by we get to gabbing together and I ask him whatever
becomes of the Bookie Bob matter, and Harry the Horse tells me as follows:</p>

<p>Yes [Harry the Horse says], we snatch Bookie Bob all right. In fact, we
snatch him the very next night after we are talking to you, or on a Wednesday
night. Our finger tells us Bookie Bob is going to a wake over in his old
neighbourhood on Tenth Avenue, near Thirty-eighth Street, and this is where we
pick him up.</p>

<p>He is leaving the place in his car along about midnight, and of course
Bookie Bob is alone as he seldom lets anybody ride with him because of the wear
and tear on his car cushions, and Little Isadore swings our flivver in front of
him and makes him stop. Naturally Bookie Bob is greatly surprised when I poke
my head into his car and tell him I wish the pleasure of his company for a
short time, and at first he is inclined to argue the matter, saying I must make
a mistake, but I put the old convincer on him by letting him peek down the
snozzle of my John Roscoe.</p>

<p>We lock his car and throw the keys away, and then we take Bookie Bob in our
car and go to a certain spot on Eighth Avenue where we have a nice little
apartment all ready. When we get there I tell Bookie Bob that he can call up
anybody he wishes and state that the snatch is on him and that it will require
twenty-five G's, cash money, to take it off, but of course I also tell Bookie
Bob that he is not to mention where he is or something may happen to him.</p>

<p>Well, I will say one thing for Bookie Bob, although everybody is always
weighing in the sacks on him and saying he is no good--he takes it like a
gentleman, and very calm and businesslike. Furthermore, he does not seem
alarmed, as many citizens are when they find themselves in such a situation. He
recognizes the justice of our claim at once, saying as follows:</p>

<p>'I will telephone my partner, Sam Salt,' he says. 'He is the only one I can
think of who is apt to have such it sum as twenty-five G's cash money. But,' he
says, 'if you gentlemen will pardon the question, because this is a new
experience to me, how do I know everything will be okay for me after you get
the scratch?'</p>

<p>'Why,' I say to Bookie Bob, somewhat indignant, 'it is well known to one and
all in this town that my word is my bond. There are two things I am bound to
do,' I say, 'and one is to keep my word in such a situation as this, and the
other is to pay anything I owe a bookmaker, no matter what, for these are
obligations of honour with me.'</p>

<p>'Well,' Bookie Bob says, 'of course I do not know you gentlemen, and, in
fact, I do not remember ever seeing any of you, although your face is somewhat
familiar, but if you pay your bookmaker you are an honest guy, and one in a
million. In fact,' Bookie Bob says, 'if I have all the scratch that is owing to
me around this town, I will not be telephoning anybody for such a sum as
twenty-five G's. I will have such a sum in my pants pocket for change.'</p>

<p>Now Bookie Bob calls a certain number and talks to somebody there but he
does not get Sam Salt, and he seems much disappointed when he hangs up the
receiver again.</p>

<p>'This is a very tough break for me,' he says. 'Sam Salt goes to Atlantic
City an hour ago on very important business and will not be back until
to-morrow evening, and they do not know where he is to stay in Atlantic City.
And,' Bookie Bob says, 'I cannot think of anybody else to call up to get this
scratch, especially anybody I will care to have know I am in this
situation.'</p>

<p>'Why not call your ever-loving wife?' I say. 'Maybe she can dig up this kind
of scratch.'</p>

<p>'Say,' Bookie Bob says, 'you do not suppose I am chump enough to give my
ever-loving wife twenty-five G's, or even let her know where she can get her
dukes on twenty-five G's belonging to me, do you? I give my ever-loving wife
ten bucks per week for spending money,' Bookie Bob says, 'and this is enough
scratch for any doll, especially when you figure I pay for her meals.'</p>

<p>Well, there seems to be nothing we can do except wait until Sam Salt gets
back, but we let Bookie Bob call his ever-loving wife, as Bookie Bob says he
does not wish to have her worrying about his absence, and tells her a big lie
about having to go to Jersey City to sit up with a sick Brother Elk.</p>

<p>Well, it is now nearly four o'clock in the morning, so we put Bookie Bob in
a room with Little Isadore to sleep, although, personally, I consider making a
guy sleep with Little Isadore very cruel treatment, and Spanish John and I take
turns keeping awake and watching out that Bookie Bob does not take the air on
us before paying us off. To tell the truth, Little Isadore and Spanish John are
somewhat disappointed that Bookie Bob agreed to settle so promptly, because
they are looking forward to tickling his feet with great relish.</p>

<p>Now Bookie Bob turns out to be very good company when he wakes up the next
morning, because he knows a lot of race-track stories and plenty of scandal,
and he keeps us much interested at breakfast. He talks along with us as if he
knows us all his life, and he seems very nonchalant indeed, but the chances are
he will not be so nonchalant if I tell him about Spanish John's thought.</p>

<p>Well, about noon Spanish John goes out of the apartment and comes back with
a racing sheet, because he knows Little Isadore and I will be wishing to know
what is running in different spots although we do not have anything to bet on
these races, or any way of betting on them, because we are overboard with every
bookmaker we know.</p>

<p>Now Bookie Bob is also much interested in the matter of what is running,
especially at Belmont, and he is bending over the table with me and Spanish
John and Little Isadore, looking at the sheet, when Spanish John speaks as
follows:</p>

<p>'My goodness,' Spanish John says, 'a spot such as this fifth race with
Questionnaire at four to five is like finding money in the street. I only wish
I have a few bobs to bet on him at such a price,' Spanish John says.</p>

<p>'Why,' Bookie Bob says, very polite, 'if you gentlemen wish to bet on these
races I will gladly book to you. It is a good way to pass away the time while
we are waiting for Sam Salt, unless you will rather play pinochle?'</p>

<p>'But,' I say, 'we have no scratch to play the races, at least not much.'</p>

<p>'Well,' Bookie Bob says, 'I will take your markers, because I hear what you
say about always paying your bookmaker, and you put yourself away with me as an
honest guy, and these other gentlemen also impress me as honest guys.'</p>

<p>Now what happens but we begin betting Bookie Bob on the different races, not
only at Belmont, but at all the other tracks in the country, for Little Isadore
and Spanish John and I are guys who like plenty of action when we start betting
on the horses. We write out markers for whatever we wish to bet and hand them
to Bookie Bob, and Bookie Bob sticks these markers in an inside pocket, and
along in the late afternoon it looks as if he has a tumour on his chest.</p>

<p>We get the race results by 'phone off a poolroom downtown as fast as they
come off, and also the prices, and it is a lot of fun, and Little Isadore and
Spanish John and Bookie Bob and I are all little pals together until all the
races are over and Bookie Bob takes out the markers and starts counting himself
up.</p>

<p>It comes out then that I owe Bookie Bob ten G's, and Spanish John owes him
six G's, and Little Isadore owes him four G's, as Little Isadore beats him a
couple of races out west.</p>

<p>Well, about this time, Bookie Bob manages to get Sam Salt on the 'phone, and
explains to Sam that he is to go to a certain safe-deposit box and get out
twenty-five G's, and then wait until midnight and hire himself a taxicab and
start riding around the block between Fifty-first and Fifty-second, from Eighth
to Ninth Avenues, and to keep riding until somebody flags the cab and takes the
scratch off him.</p>

<p>Naturally Sam Salt understands right away that the snatch is on Bookie Bob,
and he agrees to do as he is told, but he says he cannot do it until the
following night because he knows there is not twenty-five G's in the box, and
he will have to get the difference at the track the next day. So there we are
with another day in the apartment and Spanish John and Little Isadore and I are
just as well pleased because Bookie Bob has us hooked and we naturally wish to
wiggle off.</p>

<p>But the next day is worse than ever. In all the years I am playing the
horses I never have such a tough day, and Spanish John and Little Isadore are
just as bad. In fact, we are all going so bad that Bookie Bob seems to feel
sorry for us and often lays us a couple of points above the track prices, but
it does no good. At the end of the day, I am in a total of twenty G's, while
Spanish John owes fifteen, and Little Isadore fifteen, a total of fifty G's
among the three of us.</p>

<p>But we are never any hands to hold post-mortems on bad days, so Little
Isadore goes out to a delicatessen store and lugs in a lot of nice things to
eat, and we have a fine dinner, and then we sit around with Bookie Bob telling
stories, and even singing a few songs together until time to meet Sam Salt.</p>

<p>When it comes on midnight Spanish John goes out and lays for Sam, and gets a
little valise off of Sam Salt. Then Spanish John comes back to the apartment
and we open the valise and the twenty-five G's are there okay, and we cut this
scratch three ways.</p>

<p>Then I tell Bookie Bob he is free to go on about his business, and good luck
to him, at that, but Bookie Bob looks at me as if he is very much surprised,
and hurt, and says to me like this:</p>

<p>'Well, gentlemen, thank you for your courtesy, but what about the scratch
you owe me? What about these markers? Surely, gentlemen, you will pay your
bookmaker?'</p>

<p>Well, of course we owe Bookie Bob these markers, all right, and of course a
man must pay his bookmaker, no matter what, so I hand over my bit and Bookie
Bob puts down something in a little note-book that he takes out of his
kick.</p>

<p>Then Spanish John and Little Isadore hand over their dough, too, and Bookie
Bob puts down something more in the little note-book.</p>

<p>'Now,' Bookie Bob says, 'I credit each of your accounts with these payments,
but you gentlemen still owe me a matter of twenty-five G's over and above the
twenty-five I credit you with, and I hope and trust you will make arrangements
to settle this at once because,' he says, 'I do not care to extend such
accommodations over any considerable period.'</p>

<p>'But,' I say, 'we do not have any more scratch after paying you the
twenty-five G's on account.'</p>

<p>'Listen,' Bookie Bob says, dropping his voice down to a whisper, 'what about
putting the snatch on my partner, Sam Salt, and I will wait over a couple of
days with you and keep booking to you, and maybe you can pull yourselves out.
But of course,' Bookie Bob whispers, 'I will be entitled to twenty-five per
cent of the snatch for putting the finger on Sam for you.'</p>

<p>But Spanish John and Little Isadore are sick and tired of Bookie Bob and
will not listen to staying in the apartment any longer, because they say he is
a jinx to them and they cannot beat him in any manner, shape or form.
Furthermore, I am personally anxious to get away because something Bookie Bob
says reminds me of something. It reminds me that besides the scratch we owe
him, we forget to take out six G's two-fifty for the party who puts the finger
on Bookie Bob for us, and this is a very serious matter indeed, because anybody
will tell you that failing to pay a finger is considered a very dirty trick.
Furthermore, if it gets around that you fail to pay a finger, nobody else will
ever finger for you.</p>

<p>So [Harry the Horse says] we quit the snatching business because there is no
use continuing while this obligation is outstanding against us, and we go back
to Brooklyn to earn enough scratch to pay our just debts.</p>

<p>We are paying off Bookie Bob's IOU a little at a time, because we do not
wish to ever have anybody say we welsh on a bookmaker, and furthermore we are
paying off the six G's two-fifty commission we owe our finger.</p>

<p>And while it is tough going, I am glad to say our honest effort is doing
somebody a little good, because I see Bookie Bob's ever-loving wife the other
night all dressed up in new clothes and looking very happy, indeed.</p>

<p>And while a guy is telling me she is looking so happy because she gets a
large legacy from an uncle who dies in Switzerland, and is now independent of
Bookie Bob, I only hope and trust [Harry the Horse says] that it never gets out
that our finger in this case is nobody but Bookie Bob's ever-loving wife.</p>

<h3><a name="The_Lily_of_St_Pierre" id="The_Lily_of_St_Pierre">The Lily of St. Pierre</a></h3>
<p>There are four of us sitting in Good Time Charley Bernstein's little joint
in Forty-eighth Street one Tuesday morning about four o'clock, doing a bit of
quartet singing, very low, so as not to disturb the copper on the beat outside,
a very good guy by the name of Carrigan, who likes to get his rest at such an
hour.</p>

<p>Good Time Charley's little joint is called the Crystal Room, although of
course there is no crystal whatever in the room, but only twelve tables, and
twelve hostesses, because Good Time Charley believes in his customers having
plenty of social life.</p>

<p>So he has one hostess to a table, and if there are twelve different
customers, which is very seldom, each customer has a hostess to talk with. And
if there is only one customer, he has all twelve hostesses to gab with and buy
drinks for, and no customer can ever go away claiming he is lonesome in Good
Time Charley's.</p>

<p>Personally, I will not give you a nickel to talk with Good Time Charley's
hostesses, one at a time or all together, because none of them are anything
much to look at, and I figure they must all be pretty dumb or they will not be
working as hostesses in Good Time Charley's little joint. I happen to speak of
this to Good Time Charley, and he admits that I may be right, but he says it is
very difficult to get any Peggy Joyces for twenty-five bobs per week.</p>

<p>Of course I never buy any drinks in Good Time Charley's for hostesses, or
anybody else, and especially for myself, because I am a personal friend of Good
Time Charley's, and he will not sell me any drinks even if I wish to buy any,
which is unlikely, as Good Time Charley figures that anybody who buys drinks in
his place is apt to drink these drinks, and Charley does not care to see any of
his personal friends drinking drinks at his place. If one of his personal
friends wishes to buy a drink, Charley always sends him to Jack Fogarty's
little speak down the street, and in fact Charley will generally go with
him.</p>

<p>So I only go to Good Time Charley's to talk with him, and to sing in quartet
with him. There are very seldom any customers in Good Time Charley's until
along about five o'clock in the morning after all the other places are closed,
and then it is sometimes a very hot spot indeed, and it is no place to sing in
quartet at such hours, because everybody around always wishes to join in, and
it ruins the harmony. But just before five o'clock it is okay, as only the
hostesses are there, and of course none of them dast to join in our singing, or
Good Time Charley will run them plumb out of the joint.</p>

<p>If there is one thing I love to do more than anything else, it is to sing in
quartet. I sing baritone, and I wish to say I sing a very fine baritone, at
that. And what we are singing--this morning I am talking about--is a lot of
songs such as 'Little White Lies,' and 'The Old Oaken Bucket,' and 'My Dad's
Dinner Pail,' and 'Chloe,' and 'Melancholy Baby,' and I do not know what else,
including 'Home, Sweet Home,' although we do not go so good on this because
nobody remembers all the words, and half the time we are all just going
ho-hum-hum-ho-hum-hum, like guys nearly always do when they are singing 'Home,
Sweet Home.'</p>

<p>Also we sing 'I Can't Give You Anything but Love, Baby,' which is a very
fine song for quartet singing, especially when you have a guy singing a nice
bass, such as Good Time Charley, who can come in on every line with a big
bum-bum like this:</p>

<blockquote><i>I can't give you anything but luh-huh-vuh, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Bay-hay-bee! <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BUM-BUM!
</i></blockquote>

<p>I am the one who holds these last words, such as love, and baby, and you can
hear my fine baritone very far indeed, especially when I give a little extra
roll like bay-hay-ay-ay-BEE! Then when Good Time Charley comes in with his old
bum-bum, it is worth going a long way to hear.</p>

<p>Well, naturally, we finally get around to torch songs, as guys who are
singing in quartet are bound to do, especially at four o'clock in the morning,
a torch song being a song which guys sing when they have the big burnt-up
feeling inside themselves over a battle with their dolls.</p>

<p>When a guy has a battle with his doll, such as his sweetheart, or even his
ever-loving wife, he certainly feels burnt up inside himself, and can scarcely
think of anything much. In fact, I know guys who are carrying the torch to walk
ten miles and never know they go an inch. It is surprising how much ground a
guy can cover just walking around and about, wondering if his doll is out with
some other guy, and everybody knows that at four o'clock in the morning the
torch is hotter than at any other time of the day.</p>

<p>Good Time Charley, who is carrying a torch longer than anybody else on
Broadway, which is nearly a year, or ever since his doll, Big Marge, gives him
the wind for a rich Cuban, starts up a torch song by Tommy Lyman, which goes as
follows, very, very slow, and sad:</p>

<blockquote><i>Gee, but it's tough<br>
When the gang's gone home.<br>
Out on the corner<br>
You stand alone.</i></blockquote>

<p>Of course there is no spot in this song for Good Time Charley's bum-bum, but
it gives me a great chance with my fine baritone, especially when I come to the
line that says Gee, I wish I had my old gal back again.</p>

<p>I do not say I can make people bust out crying and give me money with this
song like I see Tommy Lyman do in night clubs, but then Tommy is a professional
singer, besides writing this song for himself, so naturally he figures to do a
little better with it than me. But I wish to say it is nothing for me to make
five or six of the hostesses in Good Time Charley's cry all over the joint when
I hit this line about Gee, I wish I had my old gal back again, and making five
or six hostesses out of twelve cry is a fair average anywhere, and especially
Good Time Charley's hostesses.</p>

<p>Well, all of a sudden who comes popping into Good Time Charley's by way of
the front door, looking here and there, and around and about, but Jack
O'Hearts, and he no sooner pokes his snozzle into the joint than a guy by the
name of Louie the Lug, who is singing a very fair tenor with us, jumps up and
heads for the back door.</p>

<p>But just as he gets to the door, Jack O'Hearts outs with the old equalizer
and goes whangity-whang-whang at Louie the Lug. As a general proposition, Jack
O'Hearts is a fair kind of a shot, but all he does to Louie the Lug is to knock
his right ear off. Then Louie gets the back door open and takes it on the lam
through an areaway, but not before Jack O'Hearts gets one more crack at him,
and it is this last crack which brings Louie down half an hour later on
Broadway, where a copper finds him and sends him to the Polyclinic.</p>

<p>Personally, I do not see Louie's ear knocked off, because by the second shot
I am out the front door, and on my way down Forty-eighth Street, but they tell
me about it afterwards.</p>

<p>I never know Jack O'Hearts is even mad at Louie, and I am wondering why he
takes these shots at him, but I do not ask any questions, because when a guy
goes around asking questions in this town people may get the idea he is such a
guy as wishes to find things out.</p>

<p>Then the next night I run into Jack O'Hearts in Bobby's chophouse, putting
on the hot meat, and he asks me to sit down and eat with him, so I sit down and
order a hamburger steak, with plenty of onions, and while I am sitting there
waiting for my hamburger, Jack O'Hearts says to me like this:</p>

<p>'I suppose,' he says, 'I owe you guys an apology for busting up your quartet
when I toss those slugs at Louie the Lug?'</p>

<p>'Well,' I say, 'some considers it a dirty trick at that, Jack, but I figure
you have a good reason, although I am wondering what it is.'</p>

<p>'Louie the Lug is no good,' Jack says.</p>

<p>Well, of course I know this much already, and so does everybody else in town
for that matter, but I cannot figure what it has to do with Jack shooting off
ears in this town for such a reason, or by and by there will be very few people
left with ears.</p>

<p>'Let me tell you about Louie the Lug,' Jack O'Hearts says. 'You will see at
once that my only mistake is I do not get my shots an inch to the left. I do
not know what is the matter with me lately.'</p>

<p>'Maybe you are letting go too quick,' I say, very sympathetic, because I
know how it annoys him to blow easy shots.</p>

<p>'Maybe,' he says. 'Anyway, the light in Charley's dump is no good. It is
only an accident I get Louie with the last shot, and it is very sloppy work all
around. But now I tell you about Louie the Lug.'</p>

<hr>

<p>It is back in 1924 [Jack O'Hearts says] that I go to St. Pierre for the
first time to look after some business matters for John the Boss, rest his
soul, who is at this time one of the largest operators in highgrade merchandise
in the United States, especially when it comes to Scotch. Maybe you remember
John the Boss, and the heat which develops around and about when he is scragged
in Detroit? John the Boss is a very fine character, and it is a terrible blow
to many citizens when he is scragged.</p>

<p>Now if you are never in St. Pierre, I wish to say you miss nothing much,
because what is it but a little squirt of a burg sort of huddled up alongside
some big rocks off Newfoundland, and very hard to get to, any way you go.
Mostly you go there from Halifax by boat, though personally I go there in 1924
in John the Boss's schooner by the name of the <i>Maude</i>, in which we load a
thousand cases of very nice merchandise for the Christmas trade. The first time
I see St. Pierre I will not give you eight cents for the whole layout, although
of course it is very useful to parties in our line of business. It does not
look like much, and it belongs to France, and nearly all the citizens speak
French, because most of them are French, and it seems it is the custom of the
French people to speak French no matter where they are, even away off up yonder
among the fish.</p>

<p>Well, anyway, it is on this trip to St. Pierre in 1924 that I meet an old
guy by the name of Doctor Armand Dorval, for what happens to me but I catch
pneumonia, and it looks as if maybe I am a gone gosling, especially as there is
no place in St. Pierre where a guy can have pneumonia with any comfort. But
this Doctor Armand Dorval is a friend of John the Boss, and he takes me into
his house and lets me be as sick there as I please, while he does his best to
doctor me up.</p>

<p>Now this Doctor Armand Dorval is an old Frenchman with whiskers, and he has
a little granddaughter by the name of Lily, who is maybe twelve years old at
the time I am talking about, with her hair hanging down her back in two braids.
It seems her papa, who is Doctor Armand's son, goes out one day looking for cod
on the Grand Banks when Lily is nothing but a baby, and never comes back, and
then her mamma dies, so old Doc raises up Lily and is very fond of her
indeed.</p>

<p>They live alone in the house where I am sick with this pneumonia, and it is
a nice, quiet little house and very old-fashioned, with a good view of the
fishing boats, if you care for fishing boats. In fact, it is the quietest place
I am ever in in my life, and the only place I ever know any real peace. A big
fat old doll who does not talk English comes in every day to look after things
for Doctor Armand and Lily, because it seems Lily is not old enough to keep
house as yet, although she makes quite a nurse for me.</p>

<p>Lily talks English very good, and she is always bringing me things, and
sitting by my bed and chewing the rag with me about this and that, and
sometimes she reads to me out of a book which is called <i>Alice in Wonderland</i>,
and which is nothing but a pack of lies, but very interesting in spots.
Furthermore, Lily has a big, blonde, dumb-looking doll by the name of Yvonne,
which she makes me hold while she is reading to me, and I am very glad indeed
that the <i>Maude</i> goes on back to the United States and there is no danger of any
of the guys walking in on me while I am holding this doll, or they will think I
blow my topper.</p>

<p>Finally, when I am able to sit up around the house of an evening I play
checkers with Lily, while old Doctor Armand Dorval sits back in a
rocking-chair, smoking a pipe and watching us, and sometimes I sing for her. I
wish to say I sing a first-class tenor, and when I am in the war business in
France with the Seventy-seventh Division I am always in great demand for
singing a quartet. So I sing such songs to Lily as 'There's a Long, Long
Trail,' and 'Mademoiselle from Armentieres,' although of course when it comes
to certain spots in this song I just go dum-dum-dee-dum and do not say the
words right out.</p>

<p>By and by Lily gets to singing with me, and we sound very good together,
especially when we sing the 'Long, Long Trail,' which Lily likes very much, and
even old Doctor Armand joins in now and then, although his voice is very
terrible. Anyway, Lily and me and Doctor Armand become very good pals indeed,
and what is more I meet up with other citizens of St. Pierre and become friends
with them, and they are by no means bad people to know, and it is certainly
nice to be able to walk up and down without being afraid every other guy you
meet is going to chuck a slug at you, or a copper put the old sleeve on you and
say that they wish to see you at headquarters.</p>

<p>Finally I get rid of this pneumonia and take the boat to Halifax, and I am
greatly surprised to find that Doctor Armand and Lily are very sorry to see me
go, because never before in my life do I leave a place where anybody is sorry
to see me go.</p>

<p>But Doctor Armand seems very sad and shakes me by the hand over and over
again, and what does Lily do but bust out crying, and the first thing I know I
am feeling sad myself and wishing that I am not going. So I promise Doctor
Armand I will come back some day to see him, and then Lily hauls off and gives
me a big kiss right in the smush and this astonishes me so much that it is half
an hour afterwards before I think to wipe it off.</p>

<p>Well, for the next few months I find myself pretty busy back in New York,
what with one thing and another, and I do not have time to think much of Doctor
Armand Dorval and Lily, and St. Pierre, but it comes along the summer of 1925,
and I am all tired out from getting a slug in my chest in the run-in with Jerk
Donovan's mob in Jersey, for I am now in beer and have no more truck with the
boats.</p>

<p>But I get to thinking of St. Pierre and the quiet little house of Doctor
Armand Dorval again, and how peaceful it is up there, and nothing will do but I
must pop off to Halifax, and pretty soon I am in St. Pierre once more. I take a
raft of things for Lily with me, such as dolls, and handkerchiefs, and perfume,
and a phonograph, and also a set of razors for Doctor Armand, although
afterwards I am sorry I take these razors because I remember the old Doc does
not shave and may take them as a hint I do not care for his whiskers. But as it
turns out the Doc finds them very useful in operations, so the razors are a
nice gift after all.</p>

<p>Well, I spend two peaceful weeks there again, walking up and down in the
daytime and playing checkers and singing with Lily in the evening, and it is
tough tearing myself away, especially as Doctor Armand Dorval looks very sad
again and Lily busts out crying, louder than before. So nearly every year after
this I can hardly wait until I can get to St. Pierre for a vacation, and Doctor
Armand Dorval's house is like my home, only more peaceful.</p>

<p>Now in the summer of 1928 I am in Halifax on my way to St. Pierre, when I
run across Louie the Lug, and it seems Louie is a lammister out of Detroit on
account of some job or other, and is broke, and does not know which way to
turn. Personally, I always figure Louie a petty-larceny kind of guy, with no
more moxie than a canary bird, but he always dresses well, and always has a
fair line of guff, and some guys stand for him. Anyway, here he is in trouble,
so what happens but I take him with me to St. Pierre, figuring he can lay dead
there until things blow over.</p>

<p>Well, Lily and old Doctor Armand Dorval are certainly glad to see me, and I
am just as glad to see them, especially Lily, for she is now maybe sixteen
years old and as pretty a doll as ever steps in shoe leather, what with her
long black hair, and her big black eyes, and a million dollars' worth of
personality. Furthermore, by this time she swings a very mean skillet, indeed,
and gets me up some very tasty fodder out of fish and one thing and
another.</p>

<p>But somehow things are not like they used to be at St. Pierre with this guy
Louie the Lug around, because he does not care for the place whatever, and goes
roaming about very restless, and making cracks about the citizens, and
especially the dolls, until one night I am compelled to tell him to keep his
trap closed, although at that the dolls in St. Pierre, outside of Lily, are no
such lookers as will get Ziegfeld heated up.</p>

<p>But even in the time when St. Pierre is headquarters for many citizens of
the United States who are in the business of handling merchandise out of there,
it is always sort of underhand that such citizens will never have any truck
with the dolls at St. Pierre. This is partly because the dolls at St. Pierre
never give the citizens of the United States a tumble, but more because we do
not wish to get in any trouble around there, and if there is anything apt to
cause trouble it is dolls.</p>

<p>Now I suppose if I have any brains I will see that Louie is playing the warm
for Lily, but I never think of Lily as anything but a little doll with her hair
in braids, and certainly not a doll such as a guy will start pitching to,
especially a guy who calls himself one of the mob.</p>

<p>I notice Louie is always talking to Lily when he gets a chance, and
sometimes he goes walking up and down with her, but I see nothing in this,
because after all any guy is apt to get lonesome at St. Pierre and go walking
up and down with anybody, even a little young doll. In fact, I never see Louie
do anything that strikes me as out of line, except he tries to cut in on the
singing between Lily and me, until I tell him one tenor at a time is enough in
any singing combination. Personally, I consider Louie the Lug's tenor very
flat, indeed.</p>

<p>Well, it comes time for me to go away, and I take Louie with me, because I
do not wish him hanging around St. Pierre alone, especially as old Doctor
Armand Dorval does not seem to care for him whatever, and while Lily seems as
sad as ever to see me go I notice that for the first time she does not kiss me
good-bye. But I figure this is fair enough, as she is now quite a young lady,
and the chances are a little particular about who she kisses.</p>

<p>I leave Louie in Halifax and give him enough dough to go on to Denver, which
is where he says he wishes to go, and I never see him again until the other
night in Good Time Charley's. But almost a year later, when I happen to be in
Montreal, I hear of him. I am standing in the lobby of the Mount Royal Hotel
thinking of not much, when a guy by the name of Bob the Bookie, who is a
hustler around the race-tracks, gets to talking to me and mentions Louie's
name. It brings back to me a memory of my last trip to St. Pierre, and I get to
thinking that this is the longest stretch I ever go in several years without a
visit there and of the different things that keep me from going.</p>

<p>I am not paying much attention to what Bob says, because he is putting the
blast on Louie for running away from an ever-loving wife and a couple of kids
in Cleveland several years before, which is something I do not know about
Louie, at that. Then I hear Bob saying like this:</p>

<p>'He is an awful rat any way you take him. Why, when he hops out of here two
weeks ago, he leaves a little doll he brings with him from St. Pierre dying in
a hospital without a nickel to her name. It is a sin and a shame.'</p>

<p>'Wait a minute, Bob,' I say, waking up all of a sudden. 'Do you say a doll
from St. Pierre? What-for looking kind of a doll, Bob?' I say.</p>

<p>'Why,' Bob says, 'she is black-haired, and very young, and he calls her
Lily, or some such. He is knocking around Canada with her for quite a spell.
She strikes me as a t. b., but Louie's dolls always look this way after he has
them a while. I judge,' Bob says, 'that Louie does not feed them any too
good.'</p>

<p>Well, it is Lily Dorval, all right, but never do I see such a change in
anybody as there is in the poor little doll I find lying on a bed in a charity
ward in a Montreal hospital. She does not look to weigh more than fifty pounds,
and her black eyes are sunk away back in her head, and she is in tough shape
generally. But she knows me right off the bat and tries to smile at me.</p>

<p>I am in the money very good at this time, and I have Lily moved into a
private room, and get her all the nurses the law allows, and the best croakers
in Montreal, and flowers, and one thing and another, but one of the medicos
tells me it is even money she will not last three weeks, and 7 to 5 she does
not go a month. Finally Lily tells me what happens, which is the same thing
that happens to a million dolls before and will happen to a million dolls
again. Louie never leaves Halifax, but cons her into coming over there to him,
and she goes because she loves him, for this is the way dolls are, and
personally I will never have them any other way.</p>

<p>'But,' Lily whispers to me, 'the bad, bad thing I do is to tell poor old
Grandfather I am going to meet you, Jack O'Hearts, and marry you, because I
know he does not like Louie and will never allow me to go to him. But he loves
you, Jack O'Hearts, and he is so pleased in thinking you are to be his son. It
is wrong to tell Grandfather this story, and wrong to use your name, and to
keep writing him all this time making him think I am your wife, and with you,
but I love Louie, and I wish Grandfather to be happy because he is very, very
old. Do you understand, Jack O'Hearts?'</p>

<p>Now of course all this is very surprising news to me, indeed, and in fact I
am quite flabbergasted, and as for understanding it, all I understand is she
gets a rotten deal from Louie the Lug and that old Doctor Armand Dorval is
going to be all busted up if he hears what really happens. And thinking about
this nice old man, and thinking of how the only place I ever know peace and
quiet is now ruined, I am very angry with Louie the Lug.</p>

<p>But this is something to be taken up later, so I dismiss him from my mind,
and go out and get me a marriage licence and a priest, and have this priest
marry me to Lily Dorval just two days before she looks up at me for the last
time, and smiles a little smile, and then closes her eyes for good and all. I
wish to say, however, that up to this time I have no more idea of getting
myself a wife than I have of jumping out the window, which is practically no
idea at all.</p>

<p>I take her body back to St. Pierre myself in person, and we bury her in a
little cemetery there, with a big fog around and about, and the siren moaning
away very sad, and old Doctor Armand Dorval whispers to me like this:</p>

<p>'You will please to sing the song about the long trail, Jack O' Hearts.' So
I stand there in the fog, the chances are looking like a big sap, and I sing as
follows:</p>

<blockquote><i>'There's a long, long trail a-winding <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the land of my dreams, <br>Where the
nightingale is singing, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And the white moon beams.'</i></blockquote>

<p>But I can get no farther than this, for something comes up in my throat, and
I sit down by the grave of Mrs. Jack O'Hearts, who was Lily Dorval, and for the
first time I remember I bust out crying.</p>

<p>So [he says] this is why I say Louie the Lug is no good.</p>

<p>Well, I am sitting there thinking that Jack O'Hearts is right about Louie,
at that, when in comes Jack's chauffeur, a guy by the name of Fingers, and he
steps up to Jack and says, very low:</p>

<p>'Louie dies half an hour ago at the Polyclinic.'</p>

<p>'What does he say before he goes?' Jack asks.</p>

<p>'Not a peep,' Fingers says.</p>

<p>'Well,' Jack O'Hearts says, 'it is sloppy work, at that. I ought to get him
the first crack. But maybe he had a chance to think a little of Lily
Dorval.'</p>

<p>Then he turns to me and says like this:</p>

<p>'You guys need not feel bad about losing your tenor, because,' he says, 'I
will be glad to fill in for him at all times.'</p>

<p>Personally I do not think Jack's tenor is as good as Louie the Lug's
especially when it comes to hitting the very high notes in such songs as Sweet
Adeline, because he does not hold them long enough to let Good Time Charley in
with his bum-bum.</p>

<p>But of course this does not go if Jack O'Hearts hears it, as I am never sure
he does not clip Louie the Lug just to get a place in our quartet, at that.</p>

<h3><a name="Hold_em_Yale" id="Hold_em_Yale">Hold 'em, Yale!</a></h3>
<p>What I am doing in New Haven on the day of a very large football game
between the Harvards and the Yales is something which calls for quite a little
explanation, because I am not such a guy as you will expect to find in New
Haven at any time, and especially on the day of a large football game.</p>

<p>But there I am, and the reason I am there goes back to a Friday night when I
am sitting in Mindy's restaurant on Broadway thinking of very little except how
I can get hold of a few potatoes to take care of the old overhead. And while I
am sitting there, who comes in but Sam the Gonoph, who is a ticket speculator
by trade, and who seems to be looking all around and about.</p>

<p>Well, Sam the Gonoph gets to talking to me, and it turns out that he is
looking for a guy by the name of Gigolo Georgie, who is called Gigolo Georgie
because he is always hanging around night clubs wearing a little moustache and
white spats, and dancing with old dolls. In fact, Gigolo Georgie is nothing but
a gentleman bum, and I am surprised that Sam the Gonoph is looking for him.</p>

<p>But it seems that the reason Sam the Gonoph wishes to find Gigolo Georgie is
to give him a good punch in the snoot, because it seems that Gigolo Georgie
promotes Sam for several duckets to the large football game between the
Harvards and the Yales to sell on commission, and never kicks back anything
whatever to Sam. Naturally Sam considers Gigolo Georgie nothing but a rascal
for doing such a thing to him, and Sam says he will find Gigolo Georgie and
give him a going-over if it is the last act of his life.</p>

<p>Well, then, Sam explains to me that he has quite a few nice duckets for the
large football game between the Harvards and the Yales and that he is taking a
crew of guys with him to New Haven the next day to hustle these duckets, and
what about me going along and helping to hustle these duckets and making a few
bobs for myself, which is an invitation that sounds very pleasant to me,
indeed.</p>

<p>Now of course it is very difficult for anybody to get nice duckets to a
large football game between the Harvards and the Yales unless they are
personally college guys, and Sam the Gonoph is by no means a college guy. In
fact, the nearest Sam ever comes to a college is once when he is passing
through the yard belonging to the Princetons, but Sam is on the fly at the time
as a gendarme is after him, so he does not really see much of the college.</p>

<p>But every college guy is entitled to duckets to a large football game with
which his college is connected, and it is really surprising how many college
guys do not care to see large football games even after they get their duckets,
especially if a ticket spec such as Sam the Gonoph comes along offering them a
few bobs more than the duckets are worth. I suppose this is because a college
guy figures he can see a large football game when he is old, while many things
are taking place around and about that it is necessary for him to see while he
is young enough to really enjoy them, such as the Follies.</p>

<p>Anyway, many college guys are always willing to listen to reason when Sam
the Gonoph comes around offering to buy their duckets, and then Sam takes these
duckets and sells them to customers for maybe ten times the price the duckets
call for, and in this way Sam does very good for himself.</p>

<p>I know Sam the Gonoph for maybe twenty years, and always he is speculating
in duckets of one kind and another. Sometimes it is duckets for the world's
series, and sometimes for big fights, and sometimes it is duckets for nothing
but lawn-tennis games, although why anybody wishes to see such a thing as lawn
tennis is always a very great mystery to Sam the Gonoph and everybody else.</p>

<p>But in all those years I see Sam dodging around under the feet of the crowds
at these large events, or running through the special trains offering to buy or
sell duckets, I never hear of Sam personally attending any of these events
except maybe a baseball game, or a fight, for Sam has practically no interest
in anything but a little profit on his duckets.</p>

<p>He is a short, chunky, black-looking guy with a big beezer, and he is always
sweating even on a cold day, and he comes from down around Essex Street, on the
lower East Side. Moreover, Sam the Gonoph's crew generally comes from the lower
East Side, too, for as Sam goes along he makes plenty of potatoes for himself
and branches out quite some, and has a lot of assistants hustling duckets
around these different events.</p>

<p>When Sam is younger the cops consider him hard to get along with, and in
fact his monicker, the Gonoph, comes from his young days down on the lower East
Side, and I hear it is Yiddish for thief, but of course as Sam gets older and
starts gathering plenty of potatoes, he will not think of stealing anything. At
least not much, and especially if it is anything that is nailed down.</p>

<p>Well, anyway, I meet Sam the Gonoph and his crew at the information desk in
Grand Central the next morning, and this is how I come to be in New Haven on
the day of the large football game between the Harvards and the Yales.</p>

<p>For such a game as this, Sam has all his best hustlers, including such as
Jew Louie, Nubbsy Taylor, Benny South Street and old Liverlips, and to look at
these parties you will never suspect that they are top-notch ducket hustlers.
The best you will figure them is a lot of guys who are not to be met up with in
a dark alley, but then ducket-hustling is a rough-and-tumble dodge and it will
scarcely be good policy to hire female impersonators.</p>

<p>Now while we are hustling these duckets out around the main gates of the
Yale Bowl I notice a very beautiful little doll of maybe sixteen or seventeen
standing around watching the crowd, and I can see she is waiting for somebody,
as many dolls often do at football games. But I can also see that this little
doll is very much worried as the crowd keeps going in, and it is getting on
toward game time. In fact, by and by I can see this little doll has tears in
her eyes and if there is anything I hate to see it is tears in a doll's
eyes.</p>

<p>So finally I go over to her, and I say as follows: 'What is eating you,
little Miss?'</p>

<p>'Oh,' she says, 'I am waiting for Elliot. He is to come up from New York and
meet me here to take me to the game, but he is not here yet, and I am afraid
something happens to him. Furthermore,' she says, the tears in her eyes getting
very large, indeed, 'I am afraid I will miss the game because he has my
ticket.'</p>

<p>'Why,' I say, 'this is a very simple proposition. I will sell you a choice
ducket for only a sawbuck, which is ten dollars in your language, and you are
getting such a bargain only because the game is about to begin, and the market
is going down.'</p>

<p>'But,' she says, 'I do not have ten dollars. In fact, I have only fifty
cents left in my purse, and this is worrying me very much, for what will I do
if Elliot does not meet me? You see,' she says, 'I come from Miss Peevy's
school at Worcester, and I only have enough money to pay my railroad fare here,
and of course I cannot ask Miss Peevy for any money as I do not wish her to
know I am going away.'</p>

<p>Well, naturally all this is commencing to sound to me like a hardluck story
such as any doll is apt to tell, so I go on about my business because I figure
she will next be trying to put the lug on me for a ducket, or maybe for her
railroad fare back to Worcester, although generally dolls with hard-luck
stories live in San Francisco.</p>

<p>She keeps on standing there, and I notice she is now crying more than
somewhat, and I get to thinking to myself that she is about as cute a little
doll as I ever see, although too young for anybody to be bothering much about.
Furthermore, I get to thinking that maybe she is on the level, at that, with
her story.</p>

<p>Well, by this time the crowd is nearly all in the Bowl, and only a few
parties such as coppers and hustlers of one kind and another are left standing
outside, and there is much cheering going on inside, when Sam the Gonoph comes
up looking very much disgusted, and speaks as follows:</p>

<p>'What do you think?' Sam says. 'I am left with seven duckets on my hands,
and these guys around here will not pay as much as face value for them, and
they stand me better than three bucks over that. Well,' Sam says, 'I am
certainly not going to let them go for less than they call for if I have to eat
them. What do you guys say we use these duckets ourselves and go in and see the
game? Personally,' Sam says, 'I often wish to see one of these large football
games just to find out what makes suckers willing to pay so much for
duckets.'</p>

<p>Well, this seems to strike one and all, including myself, as a great idea,
because none of the rest of us ever see a large football game either, so we
start for the gate, and as we pass the little doll who is still crying, I say
to Sam the Gonoph like this:</p>

<p>'Listen, Sam,' I say, 'you have seven duckets, and we are only six, and here
is a little doll who is stood up by her guy, and has no ducket, and no potatoes
to buy one with, so what about taking her with us?'</p>

<p>Well, this is all right with Sam the Gonoph, and none of the others object,
so I step up to the little doll and invite her to go with us, and right away
she stops crying and begins smiling, and saying we are very kind indeed. She
gives Sam the Gonoph an extra big smile, and right away Sam is saying she is
very cute, indeed, and then she gives old Liverlips an even bigger smile, and
what is more she takes old Liverlips by the arm and walks with him, and old
Liverlips is not only very much astonished, but very much pleased. In fact, old
Liverlips begins stepping out very spry, and Liverlips is not such a guy as
cares to have any part of dolls, young or old.</p>

<p>But while walking with old Liverlips, the little doll talks very friendly to
Jew Louie and to Nubbsy Taylor and Benny South Street, and even to me, and by
and by you will think to see us that we are all her uncles, although of course
if this little doll really knows who she is with, the chances are she will
start chucking faints one after the other.</p>

<p>Anybody can see that she has very little experience in this wicked old
world, and in fact is somewhat rattleheaded, because she gabs away very freely
about her personal business. In fact, before we are in the Bowl she lets it out
that she runs away from Miss Peevy's school to elope with this Elliot, and she
says the idea is they are to be married in Hartford after the game. In fact,
she says Elliot wishes to go to Hartford and be married before the game.</p>

<p>'But,' she says, 'my brother John is playing substitute with the Yales
to-day, and I cannot think of getting married to anybody before I see him play,
although I am much in love with Elliot. He is a wonderful dancer,' she says,
'and very romantic. I meet him in Atlantic City last summer. Now we are
eloping,' she says, 'because my father does not care for Elliot whatever. In
fact, my father hates Elliot, although he only sees him once, and it is because
he hates Elliot so that my father sends me to Miss Peevy's school in Worcester.
She is an old pill. Do you not think my father is unreasonable?' she says.</p>

<p>Well, of course none of us have any ideas on such propositions as this,
although old Liverlips tells the little doll he is with her right or wrong, and
pretty soon we are inside the Bowl and sitting in seats as good as any in the
joint. It seems we are on the Harvards' side of the field, although of course I
will never know this if the little doll does not mention it.</p>

<p>She seems to know everything about this football business, and as soon as we
sit down she tries to point out her brother playing substitute for the Yales,
saying he is the fifth guy from the end among a bunch of guys sitting on a
bench on the other side of the field all wrapped in blankets. But we cannot
make much of him from where we sit, and anyway it does not look to me as if he
has much of a job.</p>

<p>It seems we are right in the middle of all the Harvards and they are making
an awful racket, what with yelling, and singing, and one thing and another,
because it seems the game is going on when we get in, and that the Harvards are
shoving the Yales around more than somewhat. So our little doll lets everybody
know she is in favour of the Yales by yelling, 'Hold 'em, Yale!'</p>

<p>Personally, I cannot tell which are the Harvards and which are the Yales at
first, and Sam the Gonoph and the others are as dumb as I am, but she explains
the Harvards are wearing the red shirts and the Yales the blue shirts, and by
and by we are yelling for the Yales to hold 'em, too, although of course it is
only on account of our little doll wishing the Yales to hold 'em, and not
because any of us care one way or the other.</p>

<p>Well, it seems that the idea of a lot of guys and a little doll getting
right among them and yelling for the Yales to hold 'em is very repulsive to the
Harvards around us, although any of them must admit it is very good advice to
the Yales, at that, and some of them start making cracks of one kind and
another, especially at our little doll. The chances are they are very jealous
because she is outyelling them, because I will say one thing for our little
doll, she can yell about as loud as anybody I ever hear, male or female.</p>

<p>A couple of Harvards sitting in front of old Liverlips are imitating our
little doll's voice, and making guys around them laugh very heartily, but all
of a sudden these parties leave their seats and go away in great haste, their
faces very pale, indeed, and I figure maybe they are both taken sick at the
same moment, but afterwards I learn that Liverlips takes a big shiv out of his
pocket and opens it and tells them very confidentially that he is going to
carve their ears off.</p>

<p>Naturally, I do not blame the Harvards for going away in great haste, for
Liverlips is such a looking guy as you will figure to take great delight in
carving off ears. Furthermore, Nubbsy Taylor and Benny South Street and Jew
Louie and even Sam the Gonoph commence exchanging such glances with other
Harvards around us who are making cracks at our little doll that presently
there is almost a dead silence in our neighbourhood, except for our little doll
yelling, 'Hold 'em, Yale!' You see by this time we are all very fond of our
little doll because she is so cute looking and has so much zing in her, and we
do not wish anybody making cracks at her or at us either, and especially at
us.</p>

<p>In fact, we are so fond of her that when she happens to mention that she is
a little chilly, Jew Louie and Nubbsy Taylor slip around among the Harvards and
come back with four steamer rugs, six mufflers, two pairs of gloves, and a
thermos bottle full of hot coffee for her, and Jew Louie says if she wishes a
mink coat to just say the word. But she already has a mink coat. Furthermore,
Jew Louie brings her a big bunch of red flowers that he finds on a doll with
one of the Harvards, and he is much disappointed when she says it is the wrong
colour for her.</p>

<p>Well, finally the game is over, and I do not remember much about it,
although afterwards I hear that our little doll's brother John plays substitute
for the Yales very good. But it seems that the Harvards win, and our little
doll is very sad indeed about this, and is sitting there looking out over the
field, which is now covered with guys dancing around as if they all suddenly go
daffy, and it seems they are all Harvards, because there is really no reason
for the Yales to do any dancing.</p>

<p>All of a sudden our little doll looks toward one end of the field, and says
as follows:</p>

<p>'Oh, they are going to take our goal posts!'</p>

<p>Sure enough, a lot of Harvards are gathering around the posts at this end of
the field, and are pulling and hauling at the posts, which seem to be very
stout posts, indeed. Personally, I will not give you eight cents for these
posts, but afterwards one of the Yales tells me that when a football team wins
a game it is considered the proper caper for this team's boosters to grab the
other guys' goal posts. But he is not able to tell me what good the posts are
after they get them, and this is one thing that will always be a mystery to
me.</p>

<p>Anyway, while we are watching the goings-on around the goal posts, our
little doll says come on and jumps up and runs down an aisle and out on to the
field, and into the crowd around the goal posts, so naturally we follow her.
Somehow she manages to wiggle through the crowd of Harvards around the posts,
and the next thing anybody knows she shins up one of the posts faster than you
can say scat, and pretty soon is roosting out on the cross-bar between the
posts like a chipmunk.</p>

<p>Afterwards she explains that her idea is the Harvards will not be
ungentlemanly enough to pull down the goal posts with a lady roosting on them,
but it seems these Harvards are no gentlemen, and keep on pulling, and the
posts commence to teeter, and our little doll is teetering with them, although
of course she is in no danger if she falls because she is sure to fall on the
Harvards' noggins, and the way I look at it, the noggin of anybody who will be
found giving any time to pulling down goal posts is apt to be soft enough to
break a very long fall.</p>

<p>Now Sam the Gonoph and old Liverlips and Nubbsy Taylor and Benny South
Street and Jew Louie and I reach the crowd around the goal posts at about the
same time, and our little doll sees us from her roost and yells to us as
follows:</p>

<p>'Do not let them take our posts!'</p>

<p>Well, about this time one of the Harvards who seems to be about nine feet
high reaches over six other guys and hits me on the chin and knocks me so far
that when I pick myself up I am pretty well out of the way of everybody and
have a chance to see what is going on.</p>

<p>Afterwards somebody tells me that the guy probably thinks I am one of the
Yales coming to the rescue of the goal posts, but I wish to say I will always
have a very low opinion of college guys, because I remember two other guys
punch me as I am going through the air, unable to defend myself.</p>

<p>Now Sam the Gonoph and Nubbsy Taylor and Jew Louie and Benny South Street
and old Liverlips somehow manage to ease their way through the crowd until they
are under the goal posts, and our little doll is much pleased to see them,
because the Harvards are now making the posts teeter more than somewhat with
their pulling, and it looks as if the posts will go any minute.</p>

<p>Of course Sam the Gonoph does not wish any trouble with these parties, and
he tries to speak nicely to the guys who are pulling at the posts, saying as
follows:</p>

<p>'Listen,' Sam says, 'the little doll up there does not wish you to take
these posts.'</p>

<p>Well, maybe they do not hear Sam's words in the confusion, or if they do
hear them they do not wish to pay any attention to them, for one of the
Harvards mashes Sam's derby hat down over his eyes, and another smacks old
Liverlips on the left ear, while Jew Louie and Nubbsy Taylor and Benny South
Street are shoved around quite some.</p>

<p>'All right,' Sam the Gonoph says, as soon as he can pull his hat off his
eyes, 'all right, gentlemen, if you wish to play this way. Now, boys, let them
have it!'</p>

<p>So Sam the Gonoph and Nubbsy Taylor and Jew Louie and Benny South Street and
old Liverlips begin letting them have it, and what they let them have it with
is not only their dukes, but with the good old difference in their dukes,
because these guys are by no means suckers when it comes to a battle, and they
all carry something in their pockets to put in their dukes in case of a fight,
such as a dollar's worth of nickels rolled up tight.</p>

<p>Furthermore, they are using the old leather, kicking guys in the stomach
when they are not able to hit them on the chin, and Liverlips is also using his
noodle to good advantage, grabbing guys by their coat lapels and yanking them
into him so he can butt them between the eyes with his noggin, and I wish to
say that old Liverlips' noggin is a very dangerous weapon at all times.</p>

<p>Well, the ground around them is soon covered with Harvards, and it seems
that some Yales are also mixed up with them, being Yales who think Sam the
Gonoph and his guys are other Yales defending the goal posts, and wishing to
help out. But of course Sam the Gonoph and his guys cannot tell the Yales from
the Harvards, and do not have time to ask which is which, so they are just
letting everybody have it who comes along. And while all this is going on our
little doll is sitting up on the crossbar and yelling plenty of encouragement
to Sam and his guys.</p>

<p>Now it turns out that these Harvards are by no means soft touches in a
scrabble such as this, and as fast as they are flattened they get up and keep
belting away, and while the old experience is running for Sam the Gonoph and
Jew Louie and Nubbsy Taylor and Benny South Street and old Liverlips early in
the fight, the Harvards have youth in their favour.</p>

<p>Pretty soon the Harvards are knocking down Sam the Gonoph, then they start
knocking down Nubbsy Taylor, and by and by they are knocking down Benny South
Street and Jew Louie and Liverlips, and it is so much fun that the Harvards
forget all about the goal posts. Of course as fast as Sam the Gonoph and his
guys are knocked down they also get up, but the Harvards are too many for them,
and they are getting an awful shellacking when the nine-foot guy who flattens
me, and who is knocking down Sam the Gonoph so often he is becoming a great
nuisance to Sam, sings out:</p>

<p>'Listen,' he says, 'these are game guys, even if they do go to Yale. Let us
cease knocking them down,' he says, 'and give them a cheer.'</p>

<p>So the Harvards knock down Sam the Gonoph and Nubbsy Taylor and Jew Louie
and Benny South Street and old Liverlips just once more and then all the
Harvards put their heads together and say rah-rah-rah, very loud, and go away,
leaving the goal posts still standing, with our little doll still roosting on
the cross-bar, although afterwards I hear some Harvards who are not in the
fight get the posts at the other end of the field and sneak away with them. But
I always claim these posts do not count.</p>

<p>Well, sitting there on the ground because he is too tired to get up from the
last knockdown, and holding one hand to his right eye, which is closed tight,
Sam the Gonoph is by no means a well guy, and all around and about him is much
suffering among his crew. But our little doll is hopping up and down chattering
like a jaybird and running between old Liverlips, who is stretched out against
one goal post, and Nubbsy Taylor, who is leaning up against the other, and she
is trying to mop the blood off their kissers with a handkerchief the size of a
postage stamp.</p>

<p>Benny South Street is laying across Jew Louie and both are still snoring
from the last knockdown, and the Bowl is now pretty much deserted except for
the newspaper scribes away up in the press box, who do not seem to realize that
the Battle of the Century just comes off in front of them. It is coming on
dark, when all of a sudden a guy pops up out of the dusk wearing white spats
and an overcoat with a fur collar, and he rushes up to our little doll.</p>

<p>'Clarice,' he says, 'I am looking for you high and low. My train is stalled
for hours behind a wreck the other side of Bridgeport, and I get here just
after the game is over. But,' he says, 'I figure you will be waiting somewhere
for me. Let us hurry on to Hartford, darling,' he says.</p>

<p>Well, when he hears this voice, Sam the Gonoph opens his good eye wide and
takes a peek at the guy. Then all of a sudden Sam jumps up and wobbles over to
the guy and hits him a smack between the eyes. Sam is wobbling because his legs
are not so good from the shellacking he takes off the Harvards, and furthermore
he is away off in his punching as the guy only goes to his knees and comes
right up standing again as our little doll lets out a screech and speaks as
follows:</p>

<p>'Oo-oo!' she says. 'Do not hit Elliot! He is not after our goal posts!'</p>

<p>'Elliot?' Sam the Gonoph says. 'This is no Elliot. This is nobody but Gigolo
Georgie. I can tell him by his white spats,' Sam says, 'and I am now going to
get even for the pasting I take from the Harvards.'</p>

<p>Then he nails the guy again and this time he seems to have a little more on
his punch, for the guy goes down and Sam the Gonoph gives him the leather very
good, although our little doll is still screeching, and begging Sam not to hurt
Elliot. But of course the rest of us know it is not Elliot, no matter what he
may tell her, but only Gigolo Georgie.</p>

<p>Well, he rest of us figure we may as well take a little something out of
Georgie's hide, too, but as we start for him he gives a quick wiggle and hops
to his feet and tears across the field, and the last we see of him is his white
spats flying through one of the portals.</p>

<p>Now a couple of other guys come up out of the dusk, and one of them is a
tall, fine-looking guy with a white moustache and anybody can see that he is
somebody, and what happens but our little doll runs right into his arms and
kisses him on the white moustache and calls him daddy and starts to cry more
than somewhat, so I can see we lose our little doll then and there. And now the
guy with the white moustache walks up to Sam the Gonoph and sticks out his duke
and says as follows:</p>

<p>'Sir,' he says, 'permit me the honour of shaking the hand which does me the
very signal service of chastising the scoundrel who just escapes from the
field. And,' he says, 'permit me to introduce myself to you. I am J. Hildreth
Van Cleve, president of the Van Cleve Trust. I am notified early to-day by Miss
Peevy of my daughter's sudden departure from school, and we learn she purchases
a ticket for New Haven. I at once suspect this fellow has something to do with
it. Fortunately,' he says, 'I have these private detectives here keeping tab on
him for some time, knowing my child's schoolgirl infatuation for him, so we
easily trail him here. We are on the train with him, and arrive in time for
your last little scene with him. Sir,' he says, 'again I thank you.'</p>

<p>'I know who you are, Mr. Van Cleve,' Sam the Gonoph says. 'You are the Van
Cleve who is down to his last forty million. But,' he says, 'do not thank me
for putting the slug on Gigolo Georgie. He is a bum in spades, and I am only
sorry he fools your nice little kid even for a minute, although,' Sam says, 'I
figure she must be dumber than she looks to be fooled by such a guy as Gigolo
Georgie.'</p>

<p>'I hate him,' the little doll says. 'I hate him because he is a coward. He
does not stand up and fight when he is hit like you and Liverlips and the
others. I never wish to see him again.'</p>

<p>'Do not worry,' Sam the Gonoph says. 'I will be too close to Gigolo Georgie
as soon as I recover from my wounds for him to stay in this part of the
country.'</p>

<p>Well, I do not see Sam the Gonoph or Nubbsy Taylor or Benny South Street or
Jew Louie or Liverlips for nearly a year after this, and then it comes on fall
again and one day I get to thinking that here it is Friday and the next day the
Harvards are playing the Yales a large football game in Boston.</p>

<p>I figure it is a great chance for me to join up with Sam the Gonoph again to
hustle duckets for him for this game, and I know Sam will be leaving along
about midnight with his crew. So I go over to the Grand Central station at such
a time, and sure enough he comes along by and by, busting through the crowd in
the station with Nubbsy Taylor and Benny South Street and Jew Louie and old
Liverlips at his heels, and they seem very much excited.</p>

<p>'Well, Sam,' I say, as I hurry along with them, 'here I am ready to hustle
duckets for you again, and I hope and trust we do a nice business.'</p>

<p>'Duckets!' Sam the Gonoph says. 'We are not hustling duckets for this game,
although you can go with us, and welcome. We are going to Boston,' he says, 'to
root for the Yales to kick hell out of the Harvards and we are going as the
personal guests of Miss Clarice Van Cleve and her old man.'</p>

<p>'Hold 'em, Yale!' old Liverlips says, as he pushes me to one side and the
whole bunch goes trotting through the gate to catch their train, and I then
notice they are all wearing blue feathers in their hats with a little white Y
on these feathers such as college guys always wear at football games, and that
moreover Sam the Gonoph is carrying a Yale pennant.</p>

<h3><a name="Earthquake" id="Earthquake">Earthquake</a></h3>
<p>Personally, I do not care for coppers, but I believe in being courteous to
them at all times, so when Johnny Brannigan comes into Mindy's restaurant one
Friday evening and sits down in the same booth with me, because there are no
other vacant seats in the joint, I give him a huge hello.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I offer him a cigarette and say how pleased I am to see how
well he is looking, although as a matter of fact Johnny Brannigan looks very
terrible, what with big black circles under his eyes and his face thinner than
somewhat.</p>

<p>In fact, Johnny Brannigan looks as if he is sick, and I am secretly hoping
that it is something fatal, because the way I figure it there are a great many
coppers in this world, and a few less may be a good thing for one and all
concerned.</p>

<p>But naturally I do not mention this hope to Johnny Brannigan, as Johnny
Brannigan belongs to what is called the gunman squad and is known to carry a
black-jack in his pants pocket and furthermore he is known to boff guys on
their noggins with this jack if they get too fresh with him, and for all I know
Johnny Brannigan may consider such a hope about his health very fresh
indeed.</p>

<p>Now the last time I see Johnny Brannigan before this is in Good Time Charley
Bernstein's little joint in Forty-eighth Street with three other coppers, and
what Johnny is there for is to put the arm on a guy by the name of Earthquake,
who is called Earthquake because he is so fond of shaking things up.</p>

<p>In fact, at the time I am speaking of, Earthquake has this whole town shaken
up, what with shooting and stabbing and robbing different citizens, and
otherwise misconducting himself, and the law wishes to place Earthquake in the
electric chair, as he is considered a great knock to the community.</p>

<p>Now the only reason Brannigan does not put the arm on Earthquake at this
time is because Earthquake picks up one of Good Time Charley Bernstein's tables
and kisses Johnny Brannigan with same, and furthermore, Earthquake outs with
the old equalizer and starts blasting away at the coppers who are with Johnny
Brannigan, and he keeps them so busy dodging slugs that they do not have any
leisure to put the arm on him, and the next thing anybody knows, Earthquake
takes it on the lam out of there.</p>

<p>Well, personally, I also take it on the lam myself, as I do not wish to be
around when Johnny Brannigan comes to, as I figure Johnny may be somewhat
bewildered and will start boffing people over the noggin with his jack thinking
they are all Earthquake, no matter who they are, and I do not see Johnny again
until this evening in Mindy's.</p>

<p>But in the meantime I hear rumours that Johnny Brannigan is out of town
looking for Earthquake, because it seems that while misconducting himself
Earthquake severely injures a copper by the name of Mulcahy. In fact, it seems
that Earthquake injures him so severely that Mulcahy hauls off and dies, and if
there is one thing that is against the law in this town it is injuring a copper
in such a manner. In fact, it is apt to cause great indignation among other
coppers.</p>

<p>It is considered very illegal to severely injure any citizen in this town in
such a way as to make him haul off and die, but naturally it is not apt to
cause any such indignation as injuring a copper, as this town has more citizens
to spare than coppers.</p>

<p>Well, sitting there with Johnny Brannigan, I get to wondering if he ever
meets up with Earthquake while he is looking for him, and if so how he comes
out, for Earthquake is certainly not such a guy as I will care to meet up with,
even if I am a copper.</p>

<p>Earthquake is a guy of maybe six foot three, and weighing a matter of two
hundred and twenty pounds, and all these pounds are nothing but muscle. Anybody
will tell you that Earthquake is one of the strongest guys in this town,
because it seems he once works in a foundry and picks up much of his muscle
there. In fact, Earthquake likes to show how strong he is at all times, and one
of his ways of showing this is to grab a full-sized guy in either duke and hold
them straight up in the air over his head.</p>

<p>Sometimes after he gets tired of holding these guys over his head, he will
throw them plumb away, especially if they are coppers, or maybe knock their
noggins together and leave them with their noggins very sore indeed. When he is
in real good humour, Earthquake does not think anything of going into a night
club and taking it apart and chucking the pieces out into the street, along
with he owner and the waiters and maybe some of the customers, so you can see
Earthquake is a very high-spirited guy, and full of fun.</p>

<p>Personally, I do not see why Earthquake does not get a job in a circus as a
strong guy, because there is no percentage in wasting all this strength for
nothing, but when I mention this idea to Earthquake one time, he says he cannot
bear to think of keeping regular hours such as a circus might wish.</p>

<p>Well, Johnny Brannigan does not have anything to say to me at first as we
sit there in Mindy's, but by and by he looks at me and speaks as follows:</p>

<p>'You remember Earthquake?' he says. 'You remember he is very strong?'</p>

<p>'Strong?' I say to Johnny Brannigan. 'Why, there is nobody stronger than
Earthquake. Why,' I say, 'Earthquake is strong enough to hold up a
building.'</p>

<p>'Yes,' Johnny Brannigan says, 'what you say is very true. He is strong
enough to hold up a building. Yes,' he says, 'Earthquake is very strong indeed.
Now I will tell you about Earthquake.'</p>

<p>It is maybe three months after Earthquake knocks off Mulcahy [Johnny
Brannigan says] that we get a tip he is in a town by the name of New Orleans,
and because I am personally acquainted with him, I am sent there to put the arm
on him. But when I get to this New Orleans, I find Earthquake blows out of
there and does not leave any forwarding address.</p>

<p>Well, I am unable to get any trace of him for some days, and it looks as if
I am on a bust, when I happen to run into a guy by the name of Saul the
Soldier, from Greenwich Village. Saul the Soldier winds up in New Orleans
following the horse races, and he is very glad indeed to meet a friend from his
old home town, and I am also glad to meet Saul, because I am getting very
lonesome in New Orleans. Well, Saul knows New Orleans pretty well, and he takes
me around and about, and finally I ask him if he can tell me where Earthquake
is, and Saul speaks as follows:</p>

<p>'Why,' Saul says, 'Earthquake sails away on a ship for Central America not
long ago with a lot of guys that are going to join a revolution there. I
think,' Saul says, 'they are going to a place by the name of Nicaragua.'</p>

<p>Well, I wire my headquarters and they tell me to go after Earthquake no
matter where he is, because it seems the bladders back home are asking what
kind of a police force do we have, anyway, and why is somebody not arrested for
something.</p>

<p>I sail on a fruit steamer, and finally I get to this Nicaragua, and to a
town that is called Managua.</p>

<p>Well, for a week or so I knock around here and there looking for Earthquake,
but I cannot find hide or hair of him, and I am commencing to think that Saul
the Soldier gives me a bum steer.</p>

<p>It is pretty hot in this town of Managua, and of an afternoon when I get
tired of looking for Earthquake I go to a little park in the centre of the town
where there are many shade trees. It is a pretty park, although down there they
call it a plaza, and across from this plaza there is a big old two-story stone
building that seems to be a convent, because I see many nuns and small female
kids popping in and out of a door on one side of the building, which seems to
be the main entrance.</p>

<p>One afternoon I am sitting in the little plaza when a big guy in sloppy
white clothes comes up and sits down on another bench near me, and I am greatly
surprised to see that this guy is nobody but Earthquake.</p>

<p>He does not see me at first, and in fact he does not know I am present until
I step over to him and out with my jack and knock him bow-legged; because,
knowing Earthquake, I know there is no use starting out with him by shaking
hands. I do not boff him so very hard, at that, but just hard enough to make
him slightly insensible for a minute, while I put the handcuffs on him.</p>

<p>Well, when he opens his eyes, Earthquake looks up at the trees, as if he
thinks maybe a coconut drops down and beans him, and it is several minutes
before he sees me, and then he leaps up and roars, and acts as if he is greatly
displeased. But then he discovers that he is handcuffed, and he sits down again
and speaks as follows:</p>

<p>'Hello, copper,' Earthquake says. 'When do you get in!'</p>

<p>I tell him how long I am there, and how much inconvenience he causes me by
not being more prominent, and Earthquake says the fact of the matter is he is
out in the jungles with a lot of guys trying to rig up a revolution, but they
are so slow getting started they finally exasperate him, and he comes into
town.</p>

<p>Well, finally we get to chatting along very pleasant about this and that,
and although he is away only a few months, Earthquake is much interested in
what is going on in New York and asks me many questions, and I tell him that
the liquor around town is getting better.</p>

<p>'Furthermore, Earthquake,' I say, 'they are holding a nice warm seat for you
up at Ossining.'</p>

<p>'Well, copper,' Earthquake says, 'I am sorry I scrag Mulcahy, at that. In
fact,' he says, 'it really is an accident. I do not mean to scrag him. I am
aiming at another guy, copper,' he says. 'In fact,' he says, 'I am aiming at
you.'</p>

<p>Now about this time the bench seems to move from under me, and I find myself
sitting on the ground, and the ground also seems to be trying to get from under
me, and I hear loud crashing noises here and there, and a great roaring, and at
first I think maybe Earthquake takes to shaking things up, when I see him laid
out on the ground about fifty feet from me.</p>

<p>I get to my pins, but the ground is still wobbling somewhat and I can
scarcely walk over to Earthquake, who is now sitting up very indignant, and
when he sees me he says to me like this:</p>

<p>'Personally,' he says, 'I consider it a very dirty trick for you to boff me
again when I am not looking.'</p>

<p>Well, I explain to Earthquake that I do not boff him again, and that as near
as I can figure out what happens is that we are overtaken by what he is named
for, which is an earthquake, and looking around and about, anybody can see that
this is very true, as great clouds of dust are rising from piles of stone and
timber where fair-sized buildings stand a few minutes before, and guys and
dolls are running every which way.</p>

<p>Now I happens to look across at the convent, and I can see that it is
something of a wreck and is very likely to be more so any minute, as the walls
are teetering this way and that, and mostly they are teetering inward.
Furthermore, I can hear much screeching from inside the old building.</p>

<p>Then I notice the door in the side of the building that seems to be the main
entrance to the convent is gone, leaving the doorway open, and now I must
explain to you about this doorway, as it figures quite some in what later comes
off. It is a fairly wide doorway in the beginning with a frame of heavy timber
set in the side of the stone building, with a timber arch at the top, and the
wall around this doorway seems to be caving in from the top and sides, so that
the doorway is now shaped like the letter V upside down, with the timber
framework bending, instead of breaking.</p>

<p>As near as I can make out, this doorway is the only entrance to the convent
that is not closed up by falling stone and timber, and it is a sure thing that
pretty soon this opening will be plugged up, too, so I speak to Earthquake as
follows:</p>

<p>'Earthquake,' I say, 'there are a lot of nuns and kids in this joint over
here, and I judge from the screeching going on inside that some of them are
very much alive. But,' I say, 'they will not be alive in a few minutes, because
the walls are going to tip over and make jelly of them.'</p>

<p>'Why, yes,' Earthquake says, taking a peek at the convent, 'what you say
seems reasonable. Well, copper,' he says, 'what is to be done in this
situation?'</p>

<p>'Well,' I say, 'I see a chance to snatch a few of them out of there if you
will help me. Earthquake,' I say, 'I understand you are a very strong guy?'</p>

<p>'Strong?' Earthquake says. 'Why,' he says, 'you know I am maybe the
strongest guy in the world.'</p>

<p>'Earthquake,' I say, 'you see the doorway yonder? Well, Earthquake, if you
are strong enough to hold this doorway apart and keep it from caving in, I will
slip in through it and pass out any nuns and kids that may be alive.'</p>

<p>'Why,' Earthquake says, 'this is as bright an idea as I ever hear from a
copper. Why,' he says, 'I will hold this doorway apart until next Pancake
Tuesday.'</p>

<p>Then Earthquake holds out his dukes and I unlock the cuffs. Then he runs
over to the doorway of the convent, and I run after him.</p>

<p>This doorway is now closing in very fast indeed, from the weight of tons of
stones pressing against the timber frame, and by the time we get there the
letter V upside down is so very narrow from top to bottom that Earthquake has a
tough time wedging himself into what little opening is left.</p>

<p>But old Earthquake gets in, facing inward, and once in, he begins pushing
against the door-frame on either side of him, and I can see at once how he gets
his reputation as a strong guy. The doorway commences to widen, and as it
widens Earthquake keeps spraddling his legs apart, so that pretty soon there is
quite a space between his legs. His head is bent forward so far his chin is
resting on his wishbone, as there is plenty of weight on Earthquake's neck and
shoulders, and in fact he reminds me of pictures I see of a guy by the name of
Atlas holding up the world.</p>

<p>It is through the opening between his spraddled-out legs that I pop, looking
for the nuns and the kids. Most of them are in a big room on the ground floor
of the building, and they are all huddled up close together screeching in
chorus.</p>

<p>I motion them to follow me, and I lead them back over the wreckage, and
along the hall to the spot where Earthquake is holding the doorway apart, and I
wish to state at this time he is doing a very nice job of same.</p>

<p>But the weight on Earthquake's shoulders must be getting very hefty indeed;
because his shoulders are commencing to stoop under it, and his chin is now
almost down to his stomach, and his face is purple.</p>

<p>Now through Earthquake's spraddled-out legs, and into the street outside the
convent wall, I push five nuns and fifteen female kids. One old nun refuses to
be pushed through Earthquake's legs, and I finally make out from the way she is
waving her hands around and about that there are other kids in the convent, and
she wishes me to get them, too.</p>

<p>Well, I can see that any more delay is going to be something of a strain on
Earthquake, and maybe a little irritating to him, so I speak to him as
follows:</p>

<p>'Earthquake,' I say, 'you are looking somewhat peaked to me, and plumb tired
out. Now then,' I say, 'if you will step aside, I will hold the doorway apart
awhile, and you can go with this old nun and find the rest of the kids.'</p>

<p>'Copper,' Earthquake says, speaking from off his chest because he cannot get
his head up very high, 'I can hold this doorway apart with my little fingers if
one of them is not sprained, so go ahead and round up the rest.'</p>

<p>So I let the old nun lead me back to another part of the building, where I
judge she knows there are more kids, and in fact the old nun is right, but it
only takes one look to show me there is no use taking these kids out of the
place.</p>

<p>Then we go back to Earthquake, and he hears us coming across the rubhish and
half-raises his head from off his chest and looks at me, and I can see the
sweat is dribbling down his kisser and his eyes are bugging out, and anybody
can see that he is quite upset. As I get close to him he speaks to me as
follows:</p>

<p>'Get her out quick,' he says. 'Get the old doll out.'</p>

<p>So I push the old nun through Earthquake's spraddled-out legs into the open,
and I notice there is not as much space between these legs as formerly, so I
judge the old mumblety-pegs are giving out. Then I say to Earthquake like
this:</p>

<p>'Well, Earthquake,' I say, 'it is now time for you and me to be going. I
will go outside first,' I say, 'and then you can ease yourself out, and we will
look around for a means of getting back to New York, as headquarters will be
getting worried.'</p>

<p>'Listen, copper,' Earthquake says, 'I am never going to get out of this
spot. If I move an inch forward or an inch backward, down comes this whole
shebang. But, copper,' he says, 'I see before I get in here that it is a
hundred to one against me getting out again, so do not think I am trapped
without knowing it. The way I look at it,' Earthquake says, 'it is better than
the chair, at that. I can last a few minutes longer,' he says, 'and you better
get outside.'</p>

<p>Well, I pop out between Earthquake's spraddled-out legs, because I figure I
am better off outside than in, no matter what, and when I am outside I stand
there looking at Earthquake and wondering what I can do about him. But I can
see that he is right when he tells me that if he moves one way or another the
cave-in will come, so there seems to be nothing much I can do.</p>

<p>Then I hear Earthquake calling me, and I step up close enough to hear him
speak as follows:</p>

<p>'Copper,' he says, 'tell Mulcahy's people I am sorry. And do not forget that
you owe old Earthquake whatever you figure your life is worth. I do not know
yet why I do not carry out my idea of letting go all holds the minute you push
the old nun out of here, and taking you with me wherever I am going. Maybe,' he
says, 'I am getting soft-hearted. Well, good-bye, copper,' he says.</p>

<p>'Good-bye, Earthquake,' I say, and I walk away.</p>

<p>So [Johnny Brannigan says], now you know about Earthquake.</p>

<p>'Well,' I say, 'this is indeed a harrowing story, Johnny. But,' I say, 'if
you leave Earthquake holding up anything maybe he is still holding it up,
because Earthquake is certainly a very strong guy.'</p>

<p>'Yes,' Johnny Brannigan says, 'he is very strong indeed. But,' he says, 'as
I am walking away another shock hits, and when I get off the ground again and
look at the convent, I can see that not even Earthquake is strong enough to
stand off this one.'</p>

<h3><a name="Gentlemen_the_King" id="Gentlemen_the_King">'Gentlemen, the King!'</a></h3>
<p>On Tuesday evening I always go to Bobby's Chop House to get myself a beef
stew, the beef stews in Bobby's being very nourishing, indeed, and quite
reasonable. In fact, the beef stews in Bobby's are considered a most
fashionable dish by one and all on Broadway on Tuesday evenings.</p>

<p>So on this Tuesday evening I am talking about, I am in Bobby's wrapping
myself around a beef stew and reading the race results in the Journal, when who
comes into the joint but two old friends of mine from Philly, and a third guy I
never see before in my life, but who seems to be an old sort of guy, and very
fierce looking.</p>

<p>One of these old friends of mine from Philly is a guy by the name of Izzy
Cheesecake, who is called Izzy Cheesecake because he is all the time eating
cheesecake around delicatessen joints, although of course this is nothing
against him, as cheesecake is very popular in some circles, and goes very good
with java. Anyway, this Izzy Cheesecake has another name, which is Morris
something, and he is slightly Jewish, and has a large beezer, and is considered
a handy man in many respects.</p>

<p>The other old friend of mine from Philly is a guy by the name of Kitty
Quick, who is maybe thirty-two or three years old, and who is a lively guy in
every way. He is a great hand for wearing good clothes, and he is mobbed up
with some very good people in Philly in his day, and at one time has plenty of
dough, although I hear that lately things are not going so good for Kitty
Quick, or for anybody else in Philly, as far as that is concerned.</p>

<p>Now of course I do not rap to these old friends of mine from Philly at once,
and in fact I put the Journal up in front of my face, because it is never good
policy to rap to visitors in this town, especially visitors from Philly, until
you know why they are visiting. But it seems that Kitty Quick spies me before I
can get the Journal up high enough, and he comes over to my table at once,
bringing Izzy Cheesecake and the other guy with him, so naturally I give them a
big hello, very cordial, and ask them to sit down and have a few beef stews
with me, and as they pull up chairs, Kitty Quick says to me like this:</p>

<p>'Do you know Jo-jo from Chicago?' he says, pointing his thumb at the third
guy.</p>

<p>Well, of course I know Jo-jo by his reputation, which is very alarming, but
I never meet up with him before, and if it is left to me, I will never meet up
with him at all, because Jo-jo is considered a very uncouth character, even in
Chicago.</p>

<p>He is an Italian, and a short wide guy, very heavy set, and slow moving, and
with jowls you can cut steaks off of, and sleepy eyes, and he somehow reminds
me of an old lion I once see in a cage in Ringling's circus. He has a black
moustache, and he is an old-timer out in Chicago, and is pointed out to
visitors to the city as a very remarkable guy because he lives as long as he
does, which is maybe forty years.</p>

<p>His right name is Antonio something, and why he is called Jo-jo I never
hear, but I suppose it is because Jo-jo is handier than Antonio. He shakes
hands with me, and says he is pleased to meet me, and then he sits down and
begins taking on beef stew very rapidly while Kitty Quick says to me as
follows:</p>

<p>'Listen,' he says, 'do you know anybody in Europe?'</p>

<p>Well, this is a most unexpected question, and naturally I am not going to
reply to unexpected questions by guys from Philly without thinking them over
very carefully, so to gain time while I think, I say to Kitty Quick:</p>

<p>'Which Europe do you mean?'</p>

<p>'Why,' Kitty says, greatly surprised, 'is there more than one Europe? I mean
the big Europe on the Atlantic Ocean. This is the Europe where we are going,
and if you know anybody there we will be glad to go around and say hello to
them for you. We are going to Europe on the biggest proposition anybody ever
hears of,' he says. 'In fact,' he says, 'it is a proposition which will make us
all rich. We are sailing to-night.'</p>

<p>Well, offhand I cannot think of anybody I know in Europe, and if I do know
anybody there I will certainly not wish such parties as Kitty Quick, and Izzy
Cheesecake, and Jo-jo going around saying hello to them, but of course I do not
mention such a thought out loud. I only say I hope and trust that they have a
very good Bon Voyage and do not suffer too much from seasickness. Naturally I
do not ask what their proposition is, because if I ask such a question they may
think I wish to find out, and will consider me a very nosey guy, but I figure
the chances are they are going to look after some commercial matter, such as
Scotch, or maybe cordials.</p>

<p>Anyway, Kitty Quick and Izzy Cheesecake and Jo-jo eat up quite a few beef
stews, and leave me to pay the check, and this is the last I see or hear of any
of them for several months. Then one day I am in Philly to see a prizefight,
and I run into Kitty Quick on Broad Street, looking pretty much the same as
usual, and I ask him how he comes out in Europe.</p>

<p>'It is no good,' Kitty says. 'The trip is something of a bust, although we
see many interesting sights, and have quite a few experiences. Maybe,' Kitty
says, 'you will like to hear why we go to Europe? It is a very unusual story,
indeed, and is by no means a lie, and I will be pleased to tell it to someone I
think will believe it.'</p>

<p>So we go into Walter's restaurant, and sit down in a corner, and order up a
little java, and Kitty Quick tells me the story as follows:</p>

<p>It all begins [Kitty says] with a certain big lawyer coming to me here in
Philly, and wishing to know if I care to take up a proposition which will make
me rich, and naturally I say I can think of nothing that will please me more,
because at this time things are very bad indeed in Philly, what with
investigations going on here and there, and plenty of heat around and about,
and I do not have more than a few bobs in my pants pocket, and can think of no
way to get any more.</p>

<p>So this lawyer takes me to the Ritz-Carlton hotel, and there he introduces
me to a guy by the name of Count Saro, and the lawyer says he will okay
anything Saro has to say to me 100 per cent., and then he immediately takes the
wind as if he does not care to hear what Saro has to say. But I know this
mouthpiece is not putting any proposition away as okay unless he knows it is
pretty much okay, because he is a smart guy at his own dodge, and everything
else, and has plenty of coconuts.</p>

<p>Now this Count Saro is a little guy with an eyebrow moustache, and he wears
striped pants, and white spats, and a cutaway coat, and a monocle in one eye,
and he seems to be a foreign nobleman, although he talks English first rate. I
do not care much for Count Saro's looks, but I will say one thing for him he is
very businesslike, and gets down to cases at once.</p>

<p>He tells me that he is the representative of a political party in his home
country in Europe which has a King, and this country wishes to get rid of the
King, because Count Saro says Kings are out of style in Europe, and that no
country can get anywhere with a King these days. His proposition is for me to
take any assistants I figure I may need and go over and get rid of this King,
and Count Saro says he will pay two hundred G's for the job in good old
American scratch, and will lay twenty-five G's on the line at once, leaving the
balance with the lawyer to be paid to me when everything is finished.</p>

<p>Well, this is a most astonishing proposition, indeed, because while I often
hear of propositions to get rid of other guys, I never before hear of a
proposition to get rid of a King. Furthermore, it does not sound reasonable to
me, as getting rid of a King is apt to attract plenty of attention, and
criticism, but Count Saro explains to me that his country is a small,
out-of-the-way country, and that his political party will take control of the
telegraph wires and everything else as soon as I get rid of the King, so nobody
will give the news much of a tumble outside the country.</p>

<p>'Everything will be done very quietly, and in good order,' Count Saro says,
'and there will be no danger to you whatever.'</p>

<p>Well, naturally I wish to know from Count Saro why he does not get somebody
in his own country to do such a job, especially if he can pay so well for it,
and he says to me like this:</p>

<p>'Well,' he says, 'in the first place there is no one in our country with
enough experience in such matters to be trusted, and in the second place we do
not wish anyone in our country to seem to be tangled up with getting rid of the
King. It will cause internal complications,' he says. 'An outsider is more
logical,' he says, 'because it is quite well known that in the palace of the
King there are many valuable jewels, and it will seem a natural play for
outsiders, especially Americans, to break into the palace to get these jewels,
and if they happen to get rid of the King while getting the jewels, no one will
think it is anything more than an accident, such as often occurs in your
country.'</p>

<p>Furthermore, Count Saro tells me that everything will be laid out for me in
advance by his people, so I will have no great bother getting into the palace
to get rid of the King, but he says of course I must not really take the
valuable jewels, because his political party wishes to keep them for
itself.</p>

<p>Well, I do not care much for the general idea at all, but Count Saro whips
out a bundle of scratch, and weeds off twenty-five large coarse notes of a G
apiece, and there it is in front of me, and looking at all this dough, and
thinking how tough times are, what with banks busting here and there, I am very
much tempted indeed, especially as I am commencing to think this Count Saro is
some kind of a nut, and is only speaking through his hat about getting rid of a
King.</p>

<p>'Listen,' I say to Count Saro, as he sits there watching me, 'how do you
know I will not take this dough off of you and then never do anything whatever
for it?'</p>

<p>'Why,' he says, much surprised, 'you are recommended to me as an honest man,
and I accept your references. Anyway,' he says, 'if you do not carry out your
agreement with me, you will only hurt yourself, because you will lose a hundred
and seventy-five G's more and the lawyer will make you very hard to catch.'</p>

<p>Well, the upshot of it is I shake hands with Count Saro, and then go out to
find Izzy Cheesecake, although I am still thinking Count Saro is a little
daffy, and while I am looking for Izzy, who do I see but Jo-jo, and Jo-jo tells
me that he is on vacation from Chicago for awhile, because it seems somebody
out there claims he is a public enemy, which Jo-jo says is nothing but a big
lie, as he is really very fond of the public at all times.</p>

<p>Naturally I am glad to come across a guy such as Jo-jo, because he is most
trustworthy, and naturally Jo-jo is very glad to hear of a proposition that
will turn him an honest dollar while he is on his vacation. So Jo-jo and Izzy
and I have a meeting, and we agree that I am to have a hundred G's for finding
the plant, while Izzy and Jo-jo are to get fifty G's apiece, and this is how we
come to go to Europe.</p>

<p>Well, we land at a certain spot in Europe, and who is there to meet us but
another guy with a monocle, who states that his name is Baron von Terp, or some
such, and who says he is representing Count Saro, and I am commencing to wonder
if Count Saro's country is filled with one-eyed guys. Anyway, this Baron von
Terp takes us travelling by trains and automobiles for several days, until
finally after an extra long hop in an automobile we come to the outskirts of a
nice-looking little burg, which seems to be the place we are headed for.</p>

<p>Now Baron von Terp drops us in a little hotel on the outskirts of the town,
and says he must leave us because he cannot afford to be seen with us, although
he explains he does not mean this as a knock to us. In fact, Baron von Terp
says he finds us very nice travelling companions, indeed, except for Jo-jo
wishing to engage in target practice along the route with his automatic Roscoe,
and using such animals as stray dogs and chickens for his targets. He says he
does not even mind Izzy Cheesecake's singing, although personally I will always
consider this one of the big drawbacks to the journey.</p>

<p>Before he goes, Baron von Terp draws me a rough diagram of the inside of the
palace where we are to get rid of the King, giving me a layout of all the rooms
and doors. He says usually there are guards in and about this palace, but that
his people arrange it so these guards will not be present around nine o'clock
this night, except one guy who may be on guard at the door of the King's
bedroom, and Baron von Terp says if we guzzle this guy it will be all right
with him, because he does not like the guy, anyway.</p>

<p>But the general idea, he says, is for us to work fast and quietly, so as to
be in and out of there inside of an hour or so, leaving no trail behind us, and
I say this will suit me and Izzy Cheesecake and Jo-jo very well, indeed, as we
are getting tired of travelling, and wish to go somewhere and take a long
rest.</p>

<p>Well, after explaining all this, Baron von Terp takes the wind, leaving us a
big fast car with an ugly-looking guy driving it who does not talk much
English, but is supposed to know all the routes, and it is in this car that we
leave the little hotel just before nine o'clock as per instructions, and head
for the palace, which turns out to be nothing but a large square old building
in the middle of a sort of park, with the town around and about, but some
distance off.</p>

<p>Ugly-face drives right into this park and up to what seems to be the front
door of the building, and the three of us get out of the car, and Ugly-face
pulls the car off into the shadow of some trees to wait for us.</p>

<p>Personally, I am looking for plenty of heat when we start to go into the
palace, and I have the old equalizer where I can get at it without too much
trouble, while Jo-jo and Izzy Cheesecake also have their rods handy. But just
as Baron von Terp tells us, there are no guards around, and in fact there is
not a soul in sight as we walk into the palace door, and find ourselves in a
big hall with paintings, and armour, and old swords, and one thing and another
hanging around and about, and I can see that this is a perfect plant,
indeed.</p>

<p>I out with my diagram and see where the King's bedroom is located on the
second floor, and when we get there, walking very easy, and ready to start
blasting away if necessary, who is at the door but a big tall guy in a uniform,
who is very much surprised at seeing us, and who starts to holler something or
other, but what it is nobody will ever know, because just as he opens his
mouth, Izzy Cheesecake taps him on the noggin with the butt of a forty-five,
and knocks him cock-eyed.</p>

<p>Then Jo-jo grabs some cord off a heavy silk curtain which is hanging across
the door, and ties the guy up good and tight, and wads a handkerchief into his
kisser in case the guy comes to, and wishes to start hollering again, and when
all this is done, I quietly turn the knob of the door to the King's bedroom,
and we step into a room that looks more like a young convention hall than it
does a bedroom, except that it is hung around and about with silk drapes, and
there is much gilt furniture here and there.</p>

<p>Well, who is in this room but a nice-looking doll, and a little kid of maybe
eight or nine years old, and the kid is in a big bed with a canopy over it like
the entrance to a night club, only silk, and the doll is sitting alongside the
bed reading to the kid out of a book. It is a very homelike scene, indeed, and
causes us to stop and look around in great surprise, for we are certainly not
expecting such a scene at all.</p>

<p>As we stand there in the middle of the room somewhat confused the doll turns
and looks at us, and the little kid sits up in bed. He is a fat little guy with
a chubby face, and a lot of curly hair, and eyes as big as pancakes, and maybe
bigger. The doll turns very pale when she sees us, and shakes so the book she
is reading falls to the floor, but the kid does not seem scared, and he says to
us in very good English like this:</p>

<p>'Who are you?' he says. Well, this is a fair question, at that, but
naturally we do not wish to state who we are at this time, so I say: 'Never
mind who we are, where is the King?'</p>

<p>'The King?' the kid says, sitting up straight in the bed, 'why, I am the
King.'</p>

<p>Now of course this seems a very nonsensical crack to us, because we have
brains enough to know that Kings do not come as small as this little squirt,
and anyway we are in no mood to dicker with him, so I say to the doll as
follows:</p>

<p>'Listen,' I say, 'we do not care for any kidding at this time, because we
are in a great hurry. Where is the King?'</p>

<p>'Why,' she says, her voice trembling quite some, 'this is indeed the King,
and I am his governess. Who are you, and what do you want? How do you get in
here?' she says. 'Where are the guards?'</p>

<p>'Lady,' I say, and I am greatly surprised at myself for being so patient
with her, 'this kid may be a King, but we want the big King. We want the head
King himself,' I say.</p>

<p>'There is no other,' she says, and the little kid chips in like this:</p>

<p>'My father dies two years ago, and I am the King in his place,' he says.
'Are you English like Miss Peabody here?' he says. 'Who is the funny looking
old man back there?'</p>

<p>Well, of course Jo-jo is funny looking, at that, but no one ever before is
impolite enough to speak of it to his face, and Jo-jo begins growling quite
some, while Izzy Cheesecake speaks as follows:</p>

<p>'Why,' Izzy says, 'this is a very great outrage. We are sent to get rid of a
King, and here the King is nothing but a little punk. Personally,' Izzy says,
'I am not in favour of getting rid of punks, male or female.'</p>

<p>'Well,' Jo-jo says, 'I am against it myself as a rule, but this is a pretty
fresh punk.'</p>

<p>'Now,' I say, 'there seems to be some mistake around here, at that. Let us
sit down and talk things over quietly, and see if we cannot get this matter
straightened out. It looks to me,' I say, 'as if this Count Saro is nothing but
a swindler.'</p>

<p>'Count Saro,' the doll says, getting up and coming over to me, and looking
very much alarmed. 'Count Saro, do you say? Oh, sir, Count Saro is a very bad
man. He is the tool of the Grand Duke Gino of this country, who is this little
boy's uncle. The Grand Duke will be King himself if it is not for this boy, and
we suspect many plots against the little chap's safety. Oh, gentlemen,' she
says, 'you surely do not mean any harm to this poor orphan child?'</p>

<p>Well, this is about the first time in their lives that Jo-jo and Izzy
Cheesecake are ever mentioned by anybody as gentlemen, and I can see that it
softens them up quite some, especially as the little kid is grinning at them
very cheerful, although of course he will not be so cheerful if he knows who he
is grinning at.</p>

<p>'Why,' Jo-jo says, 'the Grand Duke is nothing but a rascal for wishing harm
to such a little guy as this, although of course,' Jo-jo says, 'if he is a
grown-up King it will be a different matter.'</p>

<p>'Who are you?' the little kid says again.</p>

<p>'We are Americans,' I say, very proud to mention my home country. 'We are
from Philly and Chicago, two very good towns, at that.'</p>

<p>Well, the little kid's eyes get bigger than ever, and he climbs right out of
bed and walks over to us looking very cute in his blue silk pyjamas, and his
bare feet.</p>

<p>'Chicago?' he says. 'Do you know Mr. Capone?'</p>

<p>'Al?' says Jo-jo. 'Do I know Al? Why, Al and me are just like this,' he
says, although personally I do not believe Al Capone will know Jo-jo if he
meets him in broad daylight. 'Where do you know Al from?' he asks.</p>

<p>'Oh, I do not know him,' the kid says. 'But I read about him in the
magazines, and about the machine guns, and the pineapples. Do you know about
the pineapples?' he says.</p>

<p>'Do I know about the pineapples?' Jo-jo says, as if his feelings are hurt by
the question. 'He asks me do I know about the pineapples. Why,' he says, 'look
here.'</p>

<p>And what does Jo-jo do but out with a little round gadget which I recognize
at once as a bomb such as these Guineas like to chuck at people they do not
like, especially Guineas from Chicago. Of course I never know Jo-jo is packing
this article around and about with him, and Jo-jo can see I am much astonished,
and by no means pleased, because he says to me like this:</p>

<p>'I bring this along in case of a bear fight,' he says. 'They are very handy
in a bear fight.'</p>

<p>Well, the next thing anybody knows we are all talking about this and that
very pleasant, especially the little kid and Jo-jo, who is telling lies faster
than a horse can trot, about Chicago and Mr. Capone, and I hope and trust that
Al never hears some of the lies Jo-jo tells, or he may hold it against me for
being with Jo-jo when these lies come off.</p>

<p>I am talking to the doll, whose name seems to be Miss Peabody, and who is
not so hard to take, at that, and at the same time I am keeping an eye on Izzy
Cheesecake, who is wandering around the room looking things over. The chances
are Izzy is trying to find a few of the valuable jewels such as I mention to
him when telling him about the proposition of getting rid of the King, and in
fact I am taking a stray peek here and there myself, but I do not see anything
worth while.</p>

<p>This Miss Peabody is explaining to me about the politics of the country, and
it seems the reason the Grand Duke wishes to get rid of the little kid King and
be King himself is because he has a business deal on with a big nation near by
which wishes to control the kid King's country. I judge from what Miss Peabody
tells me that this country is no bigger than Delaware county, Pa., and it seems
to me a lot of bother about no more country than this, but Miss Peabody says it
is a very nice little country, at that.</p>

<p>She says it will be very lovely indeed if it is not for the Grand Duke Gino,
because the little kid King stands okay with the people, but it seems the old
Grand Duke is pretty much boss of everything, and Miss Peabody says she is
personally long afraid that he will finally try to do something very drastic
indeed to get rid of the kid King on account of the kid seeming so healthy.
Well, naturally I do not state to her that our middle name is drastic, because
I do not wish Miss Peabody to have a bad opinion of us.</p>

<p>Now nothing will do but Jo-jo must show the kid his automatic, which is as
long as your arm, and maybe longer, and the kid is greatly delighted, and takes
the rod and starts pointing it here and there and saying boom-boom, as kids
will do. But what happens but he pulls the trigger, and it seems that Jo-jo
does not have the safety on, so the Roscoe really goes boom-boom twice before
the kid can take his finger off the trigger.</p>

<p>Well, the first shot smashes a big jar over in one corner of the room, which
Miss Peabody afterwards tells me is worth fifteen G's if it is worth a dime,
and the second slug knocks off Izzy Cheesecake's derby hat, which serves Izzy
right, at that, as he is keeping his hat on in the presence of a lady.
Naturally these shots are very disturbing to me at the moment, but afterwards I
learn they are a very good thing indeed, because it seems a lot of guys who are
hanging around outside, including Baron von Terp, and several prominent
politicians of the country, watching and listening to see what comes off, hurry
right home to bed, figuring the King is got rid of as per contract, and wishing
to be found in bed if anybody comes around asking questions.</p>

<p>Well, Jo-jo is finally out of lies about Chicago and Mr. Capone, when the
little kid seems to get a new idea and goes rummaging around the room looking
for something, and just as I am hoping he is about to donate the valuable
jewels to us he comes up with a box, and what is in this box but a baseball
bat, and a catcher's mitt, and a baseball, and it is very strange indeed to
find such homelike articles so far away from home, especially as Babe Ruth's
name is on the bat.</p>

<p>'Do you know about these things?' the little kid asks Jo-jo. 'They are from
America, and they are sent to me by one of our people when he is visiting
there, but nobody here seems to know what they are for.'</p>

<p>'Do I know about them?' Jo-jo says, fondling them very tenderly, indeed. 'He
asks me do I know about them. Why,' he says, 'in my time I am the greatest
hitter on the West Side Blues back in dear old Chi.'</p>

<p>Well, now nothing will do the kid but we must show him how these baseball
articles work, so Izzy Cheesecake, who claims he is once a star back-stopper
with the Vine Streets back in Philly, puts on a pad and mask, and Jo-jo takes
the bat and lays a small sofa pillow down on the floor for a home plate, and
insists that I pitch to him. Now it is years since I handle a baseball,
although I wish to say that in my day I am as good an amateur pitcher as there
is around Gray's Ferry in Philly, and the chances are I will be with the A's if
I do not have other things to do.</p>

<p>So I take off my coat, and get down to the far end of the room, while Jo-jo
squares away at the plate, with Izzy Cheesecake behind it. I can see by the way
he stands that Jo-jo is bound to be a sucker for a curve, so I take a good
windup, and cut loose with the old fadeaway, but of course my arm is not what
it used to be, and the ball does not break as I expect, so what happens but
Jo-jo belts the old apple right through a high window in what will be right
field if the room is laid off like Shibe Park.</p>

<p>Well Jo-jo starts running as if he is going to first, but of course there is
no place in particular for him to run, and he almost knocks his brains out
against a wall, and the ball is lost, and the game winds up right there, but
the little kid is tickled silly over this business, and even Miss Peabody
laughs, and she does not look to me like a doll who gets many laughs out of
life, at that.</p>

<p>It is now nearly ten o'clock, and Miss Peabody says if she can find anybody
around she will get us something to eat, and this sounds very reasonable,
indeed, so I step outside the door and bring in the guy we tie up there, who
seems to be wide awake by now and very much surprised, and quite indignant, and
Miss Peabody says something to him in a language which I do not understand.
When I come to think it all over afterwards, I am greatly astonished at the way
I trust Miss Peabody, because there is no reason why she shall not tell the guy
to get the law, but I suppose I trust her because she seems to have an honest
face.</p>

<p>Anyway, the guy in the uniform goes away rubbing his noggin, and pretty soon
in comes another guy who seems to be a butler, or some such, and who is also
greatly surprised at seeing us, and Miss Peabody rattles off something to him
and he starts hustling in tables, and dishes, and sandwiches, and coffee, and
one thing and another in no time at all.</p>

<p>Well, there we are, the five of us sitting around the table eating and
drinking, because what does the butler do but bring in a couple of bottles of
good old pre-war champagne, which is very pleasant to the taste, although Izzy
Cheesecake embarrasses me no little by telling Miss Peabody that if she can dig
up any considerable quantity of this stuff he will make her plenty of bobs by
peddling it in our country, and will also cut the King in.</p>

<p>When the butler fills the wine-glasses the first time, Miss Peabody picks
hers up, and looks at us, and naturally we have sense enough to pick ours up,
too, and then she stands up on her feet and raises her glass high above her
head, and says like this:</p>

<p>'Gentlemen, the King!'</p>

<p>Well, I stand up at this, and Jo-jo and Izzy Cheesecake stand up with me,
and we say, all together:</p>

<p>'The King!'</p>

<p>And then we swig our champagne, and sit down again and the little kid laughs
all over and claps his hands and seems to think it is plenty of fun, which it
is, at that, although Miss Peabody does not let him have any wine, and is
somewhat indignant when she catches Jo-jo trying to slip him a snort under the
table.</p>

<p>Well, finally the kid does not wish us to leave him at all, especially
Jo-jo, but Miss Peabody says he must get some sleep, so we tell him we will be
back some day, and we take our hats and say good-bye, and leave him standing in
the bedroom door with Miss Peabody at his side, and the little kid's arm is
around her waist, and I find myself wishing it is my arm, at that.</p>

<p>Of course we never go back again, and in fact we get out of the country this
very night, and take the first boat out of the first seaport we hit and return
to the United States of America, and the gladdest guy in all the world to see
us go is Ugly-face, because he has to drive us about a thousand miles with the
muzzle of a rod digging into his ribs.</p>

<p>So [Kitty Quick says] now you know why we go to Europe.</p>

<p>Well, naturally, I am greatly interested in his story, and especially in
what Kitty says about the pre-war champagne, because I can see that there may
be great business opportunities in such a place if a guy can get in with the
right people, but one thing Kitty will never tell me is where the country is
located, except that it is located in Europe.</p>

<p>'You see,' Kitty says, 'we are all strong Republicans here in Philly, and I
will not get the Republican administration of this country tangled up in any
international squabble for the world. You see,' he says, 'when we land back
home I find a little item of cable news in a paper which says the Grand Duke
Gino dies as a result of injuries received in an accident in his home some
weeks before.</p>

<p>'And,' Kitty says, 'I am never sure but what these injuries may be caused by
Jo-jo insisting on Ugly-face driving us around to the Grand Duke's house the
night we leave and popping his pineapple into the Grand Duke's bedroom
window.'</p>

<h3><a name="A_Nice_Price" id="A_Nice_Price">A Nice Price</a></h3>
<p>One hot morning in June, I am standing in front of the Mohican Hotel in the
city of New London, Conn., and the reason I am in such a surprising spot is
something that makes a long story quite a bit longer.</p>

<p>It goes back to a couple of nights before, when I am walking along Broadway
and I run into Sam the Gonoph, the ticket speculator, who seems to have a very
sour expression on his puss, although, even when Sam the Gonoph is looking
good-natured his puss is nothing much to see.</p>

<p>Now Sam the Gonoph is an old friend of mine, and in fact I sometimes join up
with him and his crew to hustle duckets to one thing and another when he is
short-handed, so I give him a big hello, and he stops and the following
conversation ensues:</p>

<p>'How is it going with you, Sam?' I say to Sam the Gonoph, although of course
I do not really care two pins how it is going with him. 'You look as if you are
all sored up at somebody.'</p>

<p>'No,' Sam says, 'I am not sored up at anybody. I am never sored up at
anybody in my life, except maybe Society Max, and of course everybody knows I
have a perfect right to be sored up at Society Max, because look at what he
does to me.'</p>

<p>Well, what Sam the Gonoph says is very true, because what Society Max does
to Sam is to steal Sam's fiancée off of him a couple of years before this, and
marry her before Sam has time to think. This fiancée is a doll by the name of
Sonia, who resides up in the Bronx, and Sam the Gonoph is engaged to her since
the year of the Dempsey--Firpo fight, and is contemplating marrying her almost
any time, when Society Max bobs up.</p>

<p>Many citizens afterwards claim that Max does Sam the Gonoph a rare favour,
because Sonia is commencing to fat up in spots, but it breaks Sam's heart just
the same, especially when he learns that Sonia's papa gives the happy young
couple twenty big G's in old-fashioned folding money that nobody ever knows the
papa has, and Sam figures that Max must get an inside tip on this dough and
that he takes an unfair advantage of the situation.</p>

<p>'But,' Sam the Gonoph says, 'I am not looking sored up at this time because
of Society Max, although of course it is well known to one and all that I am
under oath to knock his ears down the first time I catch up with him. As a
matter of fact, I do not as much as think of Society Max for a year or more,
although I hear he deserts poor Sonia out in Cincinnati after spending her
dough and leading her a dog's life, including a few off-hand pastings--not that
I am claiming Sonia may not need a pasting now and then.</p>

<p>'What I am looking sored up about,' Sam says, 'is because I must get up into
Connecticut to-morrow to a spot that is called New London to dispose of a line
of merchandise.'</p>

<p>'Why, Sam,' I say, 'what can be doing in such a place?'</p>

<p>'Oh,' Sam says, 'a large boat race is coming up between the Harvards and the
Yales. It comes up at New London every year, and is quite an interesting event
from what I read in the papers about it, but the reason I am sored up about
going to-morrow is because I wish to spend the week-end on my farm in New
Jersey to see how my onions are doing. Since I buy this farm in New Jersey, I
can scarcely wait to get over there on weekends to watch my onions grow.</p>

<p>'But,' Sam the Gonoph says, 'this is an extra large boat race this year, and
I am in possession of many choice duckets, and am sure to make plenty of black
ink for myself, and business before pleasure is what I always say. By the way,'
Sam says, 'do you ever see a boat race?'</p>

<p>Well, I say that the only boat races I ever see are those that come off
around the race tracks, such a race being a race that is all fixed up in
advance, and some of them are pretty raw, if you ask me, and I am by no means
in favour of things of this kind unless I am in, but Sam the Gonoph says these
races are by no manner of means the same thing as the boat races he is talking
about.</p>

<p>'I never personally witness one myself,' Sam says, 'but the way I understand
it is a number of the Harvards and the Yales, without any clothes on, get in
row boats and row, and row, and row until their tongues hang out, and they are
all half-dead. Why they tucker themselves out in this fashion I do not know
and,' Sam says, 'I am too old to start trying to find out why these college
guys do a lot of things to themselves.</p>

<p>'But,' Sam says, 'boat racing is a wonderful sport, and I always have a nice
trade at New London, Conn., and if you wish to accompany me and Benny South
Street and Liverlips and maybe collect a few bobs for yourself, you are as
welcome as the flowers in May.'</p>

<p>So there I am in front of the Mohican Hotel in New London, Conn., with Sam
the Gonoph and Benny South Street and old Liverlips, who are Sam the Gonoph's
best hustlers, and all around and about is a very interesting sight, to be
sure, as large numbers of the Harvards and the Yales are passing in and out of
the hotel and walking up and down and back and forth, and making very merry,
one way and another.</p>

<p>Well, after we are hustling our duckets for a couple of hours and it is
coming on noon, Benny South Street goes into the hotel lobby to buy some
cigarettes, and by and by he comes out looking somewhat excited, and states as
follows:</p>

<p>'Say,' Benny says, 'there's a guy inside with his hands full of money
offering to lay three to one that the Yales win the boat race. He says he has
fifteen G's cash with him to wager at the price stated.'</p>

<p>'Are there any takers?' Sam the Gonoph asks.</p>

<p>'No, not many,' Benny says. 'From all I hear, the Yales figure. In fact, all
the handicappers I speak with have them on top, so the Harvards do not care for
any part of the guy's play. But,' Benny says, 'there he is, offering three to
one.'</p>

<p>'Three to one?' Sam the Gonoph says, as if he is mentioning these terms to
himself. 'Three to one, eh? It is a nice price.'</p>

<p>'It is a lovely price,' old Liverlips puts in.</p>

<p>Well, Sam the Gonoph stands there as if he is thinking, and Benny South
Street seems to be thinking, too, and even old Liverlips seems to be thinking,
and by and by I even find myself thinking, and finally Sam the Gonoph says like
this:</p>

<p>'I do not know anything about boat races,' Sam says, 'and the Yales may
figure as you say, but nothing between human beings is one to three. In fact,'
Sam the Gonoph says, 'I long ago come to the conclusion that all life is six to
five against. And anyway,' he says, 'how can anybody let such odds as these get
away from them? I think I will take a small nibble at this proposition. What
about you, Benny?'</p>

<p>'I will also nibble,' Benny South Street says. 'I will never forgive myself
in this world if I let this inviting offer go and it turns out the Harvards
win.'</p>

<p>Well, we all go into the hotel lobby, and there is a big, grey-haired guy in
a white cap and white pants standing in the centre of a bunch of other guys,
and he has money in both hands. I hear somebody say he is one of the real
old-time Yales, and he is speaking in a loud voice as follows:</p>

<p>'Why,' he says, 'what is the matter, Harvards, are you cowards, or are you
just broke? If you are broke, I will take your markers and let you pay me on
the instalment plan. But,' he says, 'bet me. That is all, just bet me.'</p>

<p>Personally, I have a notion to let on I am one of the Harvards and slip the
guy a nice marker, but I am afraid he may request some identification and I do
not have anything on me to prove I am a college guy, so I stand back and watch
Sam the Gonoph shove his way through the crowd with a couple of C notes in his
hand, and Benny South Street is right behind him.</p>

<p>'I will take a small portion of the Harvards at the market,' Sam the Gonoph
says, as he offers the grey-haired guy his dough.</p>

<p>'Thank you, my friend,' the guy says, 'but I do not think we are
acquainted,' he says. 'Who do you wish to hold the stakes?'</p>

<p>'You hold them yourself, Mr. Campbell,' Sam the Gonoph says. 'I know you,
although you do not know me, and I will gladly trust you with my dough.
Furthermore, my friend here, who also wishes a portion of the Harvards, will
trust you.'</p>

<p>So the grey-haired guy says that both Sam the Gonoph and Benny South Street
are on at 3 to 1, and thanks again to them, at that, and when we get outside,
Sam explains that he recognizes the guy as nobody but Mr. Hammond Campbell, who
is a very important party in every respect and who has more dough than Uncle
Sam has bad debts. In fact, Sam the Gonoph seems to feel that he is greatly
honoured in getting to bet with Mr. Hammond Campbell, although from the way Mr.
Campbell takes their dough, I figure he thinks that the pleasure is all
his.</p>

<p>Well, we go on hustling our duckets but neither Sam the Gonoph nor Benny
South Street seem to have much heart in their work, and every now and then I
see one or the other slip into the hotel lobby, and it comes out that they are
still nibbling at the 3 to 1, and finally I slip in myself and take a little
teensy nibble for twenty bobs myself, because the way I look at it, anything
that is good enough for Sam the Gonoph is good enough for me.</p>

<p>Now Sam the Gonoph always carries quite a little ready money on his body,
and nobody will deny that Sam will send it along if he likes a proposition, and
by and by he is down for a G on the Harvards, and Benny South Street has four
C's going for him, and there is my double saw, and even old Liverlips weakens
and goes for a pound note, and ordinarily Liverlips will not bet a pound that
he is alive.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Mr. Hammond Campbell says we are about the only guys in town
that do bet him and that we ought to get degrees off the Harvards for our
loyalty to them, but of course what we are really loyal to is the 3 to 1.
Finally, Mr. Cambell says he has to go to lunch, but that if we feel like
betting him any more we can find him on board his yacht, the Hibiscus, out in
the river and maybe he will boost the price up to 3 1/2 to 1.</p>

<p>So I go into the hotel and get a little lunch myself, and when I am coming
out a nice-looking young doll who is walking along in front of me accidentally
drops her poke from under her arm, and keeps right on walking. Naturally, I
pick it up, but several parties who are standing around in the lobby see me do
it, so I call to the young doll and when she turns around I hand her the poke,
and she is very grateful to me, to be sure. In fact, she thanks me several
times, though once will do, and then all of a sudden she says to me like
this:</p>

<p>'Pardon me,' the young doll says, 'but are you not one of the gentlemen I
see wagering with my papa that the Harvards will win the boat race?'</p>

<p>'Yes,' I say, 'and what is more, we may keep on wagering him. In fact,' I
say, 'a friend of mine by the name of Sam the Gonoph is just now contemplating
wiring home for another G to accept your papa's generous offer of
three-and-a-half to one.'</p>

<p>'Oh,' the young doll says, 'do not do it. You are only throwing your money
away. The Harvards have no chance whatever of winning the boat race. My papa is
never wrong on boat races. I only wish he is to-day.'</p>

<p>And with this she sits down in a chair in the lobby and begins crying
boo-hoo until her mascara is running down her cheeks, and naturally I am
greatly embarrassed by this situation, as I am afraid somebody may come along
and think maybe she is my step-child and that I am just after chastising
her.</p>

<p>'You see,' the young doll says, 'a boy I like a very, very great deal
belongs to the Harvards' crew and when I tell him a couple of weeks ago that my
papa says the Yales are bound to win, he grows very angry and says what does my
papa know about it, and who is my papa but an old money-bags, anyway, and to
the dickens with my papa. Then when I tell him my papa always knows about these
things, Quentin grows still angrier, and we quarrel and he says all right, if
the Harvards lose he will never, never, never see me again as long as he lives.
And Quentin is a very obstinate and unreasonable boy, and life is very sad for
me.'</p>

<p>Well, who comes along about now but Sam the Gonoph and naturally he is
somewhat surprised by the scene that is presented to his eyes, so I explain to
him, and Sam is greatly touched and very sympathetic, for one thing about Sam
is he is very tender-hearted when it comes to dolls who are in trouble.</p>

<p>'Well,' Sam says, 'I will certainly be greatly pleased to see the Harvards
win the boat race myself, and in fact,' he says, 'I am just making a few
cautious inquiries around here and there to see if there is any chance of
stiffening a couple of the Yales, so we can have a little help in the race.
'But,' Sam says, 'one great trouble with these college propositions is they are
always levelling, though I cannot see why it is necessary. Anyway,' he says,
'it looks as if we cannot hope to do any business with the Yales, but you dry
your eyes, little miss, and maybe old Sam can think up something.'</p>

<p>At this the young doll stops her bawling and I am very glad of it, as there
is nothing I loathe and despise so much as a doll bawling, and she looks up at
Sam with a wet smile and says to him like this:</p>

<p>'Oh, do you really think you can help the Harvards win the boat race?'</p>

<p>Well, naturally Sam the Gonoph is not in a position to make any promises on
this point, but he is such a guy as will tell a doll in distress anything
whatever if he thinks it will give her a little pleasure for a minute, so he
replies as follows:</p>

<p>'Why, who knows?' Sam says. 'Who knows, to be sure? But anyway do not bawl
any more, and old Sam will give this matter further consideration.'</p>

<p>And with this Sam pats the young doll on the back so hard he pats all the
breath out of her and she cannot bawl any more even if she wishes to, and she
gets up and goes away looking very happy, but before she goes she says:</p>

<p>'Well, I hear somebody say that from the way you gentlemen are betting on
the Harvards you must know something and,' she says, 'I am very glad I have the
courage to talk to you. It will be a wonderful favour to Quentin and me if you
help the Harvards win, even though it costs my papa money. Love is more than
gold,' she says.</p>

<p>Personally, I consider it very wrong for Sam the Gonoph to be holding out
hope to a young doll that he is unable to guarantee, but Sam says he does not
really promise anything and that he always figures if he can bring a little joy
into any life, no matter how, he is doing a wonderful deed, and that anyway we
will never see the young doll again, and furthermore, what of it?</p>

<p>Well, I cannot think what of it just off-hand, and anyway I am glad to be
rid of the young doll, so we go back to disposing of the duckets we have
left.</p>

<p>Now the large boat race between the Harvards and the Yales takes place in
the early evening, and when it comes on time for the race one and all seem to
be headed in the direction of the river, including all the young guys with the
stir haircuts, and many beautiful young dolls wearing blue and red flowers, and
old guys in sports pants and flat straw hats, and old dolls who walk as if
their feet hurt them, and the chances are they do, at that.</p>

<p>Well, nothing will do Sam the Gonoph but we must see the boat race, too, so
we go down to the railroad station to take the very train for which we are
hustling duckets all day, but by the time we get there the race train is
pulling out, so Benny South Street says the next best thing for us to do is to
go down to the dock and hire a boat to take us out on the river.</p>

<p>But when we get to the dock, it seems that all the boats around are hired
and are already out on the river, but there is an old pappy guy with a chin
whisker sitting in a rickety-looking little motor-boat at the dock, and this
old guy says he will take us out where we can get a good peek at the race for a
buck apiece.</p>

<p>Personally, I do not care for the looks of the boat, and neither does Benny
South Street nor old Liverlips, but Sam the Gonoph is so anxious to see the
race that finally we all get into the boat and the old guy heads her out into
the river, which seems to be filled with all kinds of boats decorated with
flags and one thing and another, and with guys and dolls walking back and forth
on these boats.</p>

<p>Anybody must admit that it is quite a sight, and I am commencing to be glad
I am present, especially when Benny South Street tells me that these guys and
dolls on the boats are very fine people and worth plenty of money. Furthermore,
Benny South Street points out many big white boats that he says are private
yachts, and he tells me that what it costs to keep up these private yachts is a
sin and a shame when you start to figure out the number of people in the world
who are looking for breakfast money. But then Benny South Street is always
talking of things of this kind, and sometimes I think maybe he is a dynamiter
at heart.</p>

<p>We go putt-putting along under a big bridge and into a sort of lane of
boats, and Benny South Street says we are now at the finish line of the large
boat race and that the Harvards and the Yales row down this lane from away up
the river, and that it is here that they have their tongues hanging out and are
nearly all half-dead.</p>

<p>Well, it seems that we are in the way, because guys start yelling at us from
different boats and shaking their fists at us, and it is a good thing for some
of them that they are not close enough for us to get a pop at them, but the old
pappy guy keeps the motor-boat putt-putting and sliding in and out among the
boats until we come to a spot that he says is about a hundred yards above the
finish and a great spot to see the best part of the race.</p>

<p>We are slipping alongside of a big white boat that Benny South Street says
is a private yacht and that has a little set of stair steps running down one
side almost into the water, when all of a sudden Sam the Gonoph notices his
feet are wet, and he looks down and sees that the motor-boat is half-full of
water and furthermore that the boat is commencing to sink.</p>

<p>Now this is quite a predicament, and naturally Sam the Gonoph lets out a
slight beef and wishes to know what kind of accommodations we are paying for,
anyway, and then the old pappy guy notices the water and the sinking, and he
seems somewhat put out about the matter, especially as the water is getting up
around his chin whiskers.</p>

<p>So he steers the boat up against the stair steps on the yacht and all of us,
including the old pappy guy, climb out on to the stairs just as the motor-boat
gives a last snort and sinks from sight. The last I see of the motor-boat is
the hind end sticking up in the air a second before it disappears, and I
remember the name that is painted on the hind end. The name is <i>Baby Mine.</i></p>

<p>Well, Sam the Gonoph leads the way up the stairs to the deck of the yacht,
and who meets us at the head of the stairs but Mr. Hammond Campbell in person,
and who is right behind him but the young doll I am talking with in the hotel
lobby, and at first Mr. Campbell thinks that we come out to his yacht to pick
up a little of his 3 1/2 to 1, and he is greatly disappointed when he learns that
such is by no means our purpose and that we are merely the victims of
disaster.</p>

<p>As for the young doll, whose name turns out to be Clarice, she gazes at Sam
the Gonoph and me with her eyes full of questions, but we do not get a chance
to talk to her as things begin occurring at once.</p>

<p>There are quite a number of guys and dolls on the yacht, and it is a very
gay scene to be sure, as they walk around laughing and chatting, when all of a
sudden I see Sam the Gonoph staring at a guy and doll who are leaning over the
rail talking very earnestly and paying no attention to what is going on around
and about them.</p>

<p>The guy is a tall, dark-complected young guy with a little moustache, and he
is wearing white flannel pants and a blue coat with brass buttons, and white
shoes, and he is a very foreign-looking guy, to be sure. The doll is not such a
young doll, being maybe around middle age, giving her a few points the best of
it, but she is a fine-looking doll, at that, especially if you like dolls with
grey hair, which personally I am not so much in favour of.</p>

<p>I am close enough to Sam the Gonoph to hear him breathing heavily as he
stares at this guy and doll, and finally the dark-complected young guy looks up
and sees Sam and at the same instant Sam starts for him, and as Sam starts the
young guy turns and takes to running in the other direction from Sam along the
deck, but before he takes to running I can see that it is nobody but Society
Max.</p>

<p>Naturally, I am somewhat surprised at seeing Society Max at a boat-race
between the Harvards and the Yales, because I never figure him such a guy as
will be interested in matters of this kind, although I remember that Society
Max is once a life guard at Coney Island, and in fact it is at Coney Island
that Sonia gets her first peek at his shape and is lost for ever to Sam the
Gonoph, so I get to thinking that maybe Society Max is fond of all aquatic
events.</p>

<p>Now of course the spectacle of Sam the Gonoph pursuing Society Max along the
deck is quite surprising to one and all, except Benny South Street and old
Liverlips and myself, who are aware of the reason, and Mr. Hammond Campbell
wishes to know what kind of game they are playing, especially after they round
the deck twice, with Society Max showing much foot, but none of us feel called
on to explain. Finally the other guys and dolls on the yacht enter into the
spirit of the chase, even though they do not know what it is all about, and
they shout encouragement to both Sam the Gonoph and Society Max, although Max
is really the favourite.</p>

<p>There is no doubt but what Society Max is easily best in a sprint,
especially as Sam the Gonoph's pants legs are wet from the sinking motor-boat
and he is carrying extra weight, but Sam is a wonderful doer over a route, and
on the third trip around the deck, anybody can see that he is cutting down
Max's lead.</p>

<p>Well, every time they pass the grey-haired doll that Society Max is talking
to when we come on the yacht she asks what is the matter, Max, and where are
you going, Max, and other questions that seem trivial at such a time, but Max
never has an opportunity to answer, as he has to save all his breath to keep
ahead of Sam the Gonoph, and in fact Sam the Gonoph stops talking, too, and
just keeps plugging along with a very determined expression on his puss.</p>

<p>Well, now all the whistles on the boats in the river around us start
blowing, and it seems this is because the large boat race between the Harvards
and the Yales is now approaching the finish, and one and all on our yacht rush
to the side of the yacht to see it, forgetting about everything else, and the
side they rush to is the same side the stair steps are on.</p>

<p>But I am too much interested in Sam the Gonoph's pursuit of Society Max to
pay any attention to the boat race, and as they come around the deck the fifth
or sixth time, I can see that Sam will have Max in the next few jumps, when all
of a sudden Society Max runs right down the stairs and dives off into the
river, and he does it so fast that nobody seems to notice him except Sam the
Gonoph and me and the grey-haired doll, and I am the only one that notices her
fall in a big faint on the deck as Max dives.</p>

<p>Naturally, this is not a time to be bothering with fainting dolls, so Sam
the Gonoph and me run to the side of the yacht and watch the water to see where
Society Max comes up, but he does not appear at once, and I remember hearing he
is a wonderful diver when he is a life guard, so I figure he is going to keep
under water until he is pretty sure he is too far away for Sam the Gonoph to
hit him with anything, such as maybe a slug from a Betsy.</p>

<p>Of course Sam the Gonoph does not happen to have a Betsy on him, but Society
Max can scarcely be expected to know this, because the chances are he remembers
that Sam often has such an article in his pants pocket when he is around New
York, so I suppose Society Max plays it as safe as possible.</p>

<p>Anyway, we do not see hide or hair of him and in the meantime the excitement
over the large boat race between the Harvards and the Yales is now so terrific
that I forget Society Max and try to get a peek at it.</p>

<p>But all I remember is seeing the young doll, Clarice, kissing Sam the Gonoph
smack-dab on his homely puss, and jumping up and down in considerable glee, and
stating that she knows all along that Sam will figure out some way for the
Harvards to win, although she does not know yet how he does it, and hearing Mr.
Hammond Campbell using language even worse than Sam the Gonoph employs when he
is pursuing Society Max, and saying he never sees such a this-and-that boat
race in all his born days.</p>

<p>Then I get to thinking about the grey-haired doll, and I go over and pick
her up and she is still about two-thirds out and is saying to herself, as
follows:</p>

<p>'Max, oh, my dear, dear Max.'</p>

<p>Well, by and by Mr. Hammond Campbell takes Sam the Gonoph into a room on the
yacht and pays him what is coming to all of us on the race, and then he takes
to asking about Society Max, and when Sam the Gonoph explains how Max is a
terrible fink and what he does to Sonia and all, Mr. Hammond Campbell hands Sam
five large G's extra, and states to him as follows:</p>

<p>'This,' he says, 'is for preventing my sister, Emma, from making a fool of
herself. She picks this Max up somewhere in Europe and he puts himself away
with her as a Russian nobleman, and she is going to marry him next week,
although from what you tell me it will be bigamy on his part. By the way,' Mr.
Hammond Campbell says, 'not that it makes any difference, but I wonder whatever
becomes of the guy?'</p>

<p>I am wondering this somewhat myself, not that I really care what becomes of
Society Max, but I do not find out until later in the evening when I am at the
Western Union office in New London, Conn., sending a telegram for Sam the
Gonoph to the guy who runs his farm in New Jersey telling the guy to be sure
and watch the onions, and I hear a newspaper scribe talking about the large
boat race.</p>

<p>'Yes,' the newspaper scribe says, 'the Yales are leading by a boat length up
to the last hundred yards and going easy, and they seem to be an absolute cinch
to win, when No.6 man in their boat hits something in the water and breaks his
oar, throwing the rest of the crew out of kilter long enough for the Harvards
to slip past and win. It is the most terrible upset of the dope in history,' he
says.</p>

<p>'Now,' the scribe says, 'of course a broken oar is not unheard of in a boat
race, but what No. 6 says he hits is a guy's head which pops out of the water
all of a sudden right alongside the Yales' boat, and which disappears again as
the oar hits it.</p>

<p>'Personally,' the scribe says, 'I will say No.6 is seeing things but for the
fact that a Coast Guard boat which is laying away down the river below the
finish just reports that it picks up a guy out of the river who seems to be
alive and all right except he has a lump on his noggin a foot high.'</p>

<p>I do not see Sam the Gonoph again until it comes on fall, when I run into
him in Mindy's restaurant on Broadway, and Sam says to me like this:</p>

<p>'Say,' he says, 'do you remember what a hit I make with the little doll
because she thinks I have something to do with the Harvards winning a large
boat-race? Well,' Sam the Gonoph says, 'I just get a note from her asking me if
I can do anything about a football game that the Harvards have coming up with
the Dartmouths next month.'</p>

<h3><a name="Broadway_Financier" id="Broadway_Financier">Broadway Financier</a></h3>
<p>Of all the scores made by dolls on Broadway the past twenty-five years,
there is no doubt but what the very largest score is made by a doll who is
called Silk, when she knocks off a banker by the name of Israel Ib, for the
size of Silk's score is three million one hundred bobs and a few odd cents.</p>

<p>It is admitted by one and all who know about these matters that the record
up to this time is held by a doll by the name of Irma Teak, who knocks off a
Russian duke back in 1911 when Russian dukes are considered very useful by
dolls, although of course in these days Russian dukes are about as useful as
dandruff. Anyway, Irma Teak's score off this Russian duke is up around a
million, and she moves to London with her duke and chucks quite a swell around
there for a time. But finally Irma Teak goes blind, which is a tough break for
her as she can no longer see how jealous she is making other dolls with her
diamonds and sables and one thing and another, so what good are they to her,
after all?</p>

<p>I know Irma Teak when she is a show doll at the old Winter Garden, and I
also know the doll by the name of Mazie Mitz, who is in a Florodora revival, and
who makes a score of maybe three hundred G's off a guy who has a string of
ten-cent stores, and three hundred G's is by no means hay. But Mazie Mitz
finally hauls off and runs away with a saxophone player she is in love with and
so winds up back of the fifteen ball.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I know Clara Simmons, the model from Rickson's, who gets a
five-story town house and a country place on Long Island off a guy in Wall
Street for birthday presents, and while I never meet this guy personally, I
always figure he must be very dumb because anybody who knows Clara Simmons
knows she will be just as well satisfied with a bottle of perfume for a
birthday present. For all I know, Clara Simmons may still own the town house
and the country place, but she must be shoving on toward forty now, so
naturally nobody on Broadway cares what becomes of her.</p>

<p>I know a hundred other dolls who run up different scores, and some of them
are very fair scores, indeed, but none of these scores are anything much
alongside Silk's score off Israel Ib, and this score is all the more surprising
because Silk starts out being greatly prejudiced against bankers. I am no
booster for bankers myself, as I consider them very stony-hearted guys, but I
am not prejudiced against them. In fact, I consider bankers very necessary,
because if we do not have bankers many citizens will not be able to think of
anybody to give a cheque on.</p>

<p>It is quite a while before she meets Israel Ib that Silk explains to me why
she is prejudiced against bankers. It is when she is nothing but a chorus doll
in Johnny Oakley's joint on Fifty-third Street, and comes into Mindy's after
she gets through work, which is generally along about four o'clock in the
morning.</p>

<p>At such an hour many citizens are sitting around Mindy's resting from the
crap games and one thing and another, and dolls from the different joints
around and about, including chorus dolls and hostesses, drop in for something
to eat before going home, and generally these dolls are still in their make-up
and very tired.</p>

<p>Naturally they come to know the citizens who are sitting around, and say
hello, and maybe accept the hospitality of these citizens, such as java and
Danish pastry, or maybe a few scrambled eggs, and it is all very pleasant and
harmless, because a citizen who is all tuckered out from shooting craps is not
going to get any high blood pressure over a tired chorus doll or a hostess, and
especially a hostess.</p>

<p>Well, one morning Silk is sitting at my table guzzling a cup of java and a
piece of apple pie, when in comes The Greek looking very weary, The Greek being
a high shot who is well known far and wide. He drops into a chair alongside me
and orders a Bismarck herring with sliced onions to come along, which is a dish
that is considered most invigorating, and then The Greek mentions that he is
playing the bank for twenty-four hours hand running, so right away Silk speaks
up as follows:</p>

<p>'I hate banks,' she says. 'Furthermore,' she says, 'I hate bankers. If it is
not for a banker maybe I will not be slaving in Johnny Oakley's dirty little
drum for thirty bobs per week. Maybe my mamma will still be alive, and I will
be living at home with her instead of in a flea bag in Forty-seventh
Street.</p>

<p>'My mamma once saves up three hundred bobs from scrubbing floors in an
office building to send me to school,' Silk says, 'and a banker in one of the
buildings where she does this scrubbing tells her to put her dough in his bank,
and what happens but the bank busts and it is such a terrible blow to my mamma
that she ups and dies. I am very small at the time,' Silk says, 'but I can
remember standing in front of the busted bank with my mamma, and my mamma
crying her eyes out.'</p>

<p>Well, personally, I consider Silk's crack about Johnny Oakley's joint
uncalled for, as it is by no means little, but I explain to her that what The
Greek is talking about is a faro bank, and not a bank you put your money in, as
such a bank is called a jug, and not a bank at all, while faro bank is a
gambling game, and the reason I explain this to Silk is because everybody
always explains things to her.</p>

<p>The idea is everybody wishes Silk to be well smartened up, especially
everybody who hangs out around Mindy's because she is an orphan and never has a
chance to go to school, and we do not wish her to grow up dumb like the average
doll, as one and all are very fond of Silk from the first minute she bobs up
around Mindy's.</p>

<p>Now at this time Silk is maybe seventeen years old and weighs maybe ninety
pounds, sopping wet, and she is straight up and down like a boy. She has soft
brown hair and brown eyes that seem too big for her face, and she looks right
at you when she talks to you and she talks to you like one guy to another guy.
In fact, I always claim there is more guy in Silk than there is doll, as she
finally gets so she thinks like a guy, which is maybe because she associates
more with guys than she does with other dolls and gets a guy's slant on things
in general.</p>

<p>She loves to sit around Mindy's in the early morning gabbing with different
citizens, although she does more listening than gabbing herself, and she loves
to listen to gab about horse-racing and baseball and fights and crap-shooting
and to guys cutting up old touches and whatever else is worth gabbing about,
and she seldom sticks in her oar, except maybe to ask a question. Naturally a
doll who is willing to listen instead of wishing to gab herself is bound to be
popular because if there is anything most citizens hate and despise it is a
gabby doll.</p>

<p>So then many citizens take a real interest in Silk's education, including
Regret, the horse-player, who explains to her how to build up a sucker to
betting on a hot horse, although personally I do not consider such knowledge of
any more value to a young doll just starting out in the world than the lesson
Big Nig, the crapshooter, gives her one night on how to switch in a pair of
tops on a craps game.</p>

<p>Then there is Doc Daro, who is considered one of the highest-class operators
that ever rides the tubs in his day, being a great hand for travelling back and
forth across the ocean and outplaying other passengers at bridge and poker and
one thing and another, but who finally gets rheumatism in his hands so bad he
can no longer shuffle the cards. And of course if Doc Daro cannot shuffle the
cards there is no sense whatever in him trying to play games of skill any
more.</p>

<p>Doc Daro is always telling Silk what rascals guys are and explaining to her
the different kinds of business they will try to give her, this being the same
kind of business the Doc gives dolls himself in his time. The Doc has an idea
that a young doll who is battling Broadway needs plenty of education along such
lines, but Silk tells me privately that she is jerry to the stuff Doc is
telling her when she is five years old.</p>

<p>The guy I figure does Silk the most good is an old pappy guy by the name of
Professor D, who is always reading books when he is not busy doping the horses.
In fact, Professor D is considered somewhat daffy on the subject of reading
books, but it seems he gets the habit from being a teacher in a college out in
Ohio before he becomes a horse-player. Anyway, Professor D takes to giving Silk
books to read, and what is more she reads them and talks them over afterward
with the professor, who is greatly pleased by this.</p>

<p>'She is a bright little doll,' Professor D says to me one day.
'Furthermore,' the professor says, 'she has soul.'</p>

<p>'Well,' I say, 'Big Nig claims she can palm a pair of dice as good as
anybody he ever sees.'</p>

<p>But the professor only says heigh-ho, and goes along, and I can see he does
not consider me a character worth having much truck with, even though I am as
much interested in Silk's education as anybody else.</p>

<p>Well, what happens one night but the regular singer in Johnny Oakley's
joint, a doll by the name of Myrtle Marigold, hauls off and catches the measles
from her twelve-year-old son, and as Johnny has enough trouble getting
customers into his joint without giving them the measles after getting them
there he gives Myrtle Marigold plenty of wind at once.</p>

<p>But there he is without anybody to sing 'Stacker Lee' to his customers,
'Stacker Lee' being a ditty with which Myrtle Marigold panics the customers, so
Johnny looks his chorus over and finally asks Silk if she can sing. And Silk
says she can sing all right, but that she will not sing 'Stacker Lee,' because
she considers it a low-down lullaby, at best. She says she will sing something
classical and, being desperate for singing, Johnny Oakley says go ahead. So
what does Silk do but sing a very old song called 'Annie Laurie,' which she
learns from her mamma, and she sings this song so loud that sobs are heard all
over the joint.</p>

<p>Of course if anybody investigates they will learn that the sobbing is being
done by Professor D and Big Nig and The Greek, who happen to be in the joint at
the time, and what they are sobbing about is the idea of Silk singing at all,
but Johnny Oakley considers her a big hit and keeps her singing 'Annie Laurie'
right along, and one night Harry Fitz, the booking agent, drops in and hears
her singing and tells Ziegfeld he discovers a doll with a brand-new style.</p>

<p>Naturally Ziggie signs her up at once for the Follies, because he has great
faith in Harry Fitz's judgment but after Ziggie hears Silk sing he asks her if
she can do anything else, and is greatly relieved when he learns she can
dance.</p>

<p>So Silk becomes a Ziegfeld dancer, and she is quite a sensation with the
dramatic critics on the night she opens because she dances with all her clothes
on, which is considered a very great novelty indeed. The citizens around
Mindy's chip in and send Silk a taxicab full of orchids, and a floral pillow,
and Professor D contributes a book called <i>The Outline of History</i>, and Silk is
the happiest doll in town.</p>

<p>A year goes by, and what a year in the Follies does for Silk is most
astonishing. Personally, I never see a lot of change in her looks, except her
figure fills out so it has bumps here and there where a doll is entitled to
have bumps, and her face grows to fit her eyes more, but everybody else claims
she becomes beautiful, and her picture is always in the papers and dozens of
guys are always hanging around after her and sending her flowers and one thing
and another.</p>

<p>One guy in particular starts sending her jewellery, which Silk always brings
around to Mindy's for Jewellery Joe to look at, this Jewellery Joe being a guy
who peddles jewellery along Broadway for years, and who can tell you in a
second what a piece of jewellery is worth.</p>

<p>Jewellery Joe finds that the jewellery Silk brings around is nothing much
but slum, and naturally he advises her to have no further truck with any party
who cannot send in anything better than this, but one morning she shows up in
Mindy's with an emerald ring the size of a cake of soap, and the minute
Jewellery Joe sees the emerald he tells Silk that whoever donates this is
worthy of very careful consideration.</p>

<p>Now it seems that the party who sends the emerald is nobody but Israel Ib,
the banker who owns the jug down on the lower East Side that is called the Bank
of the Bridges, and the way Silk comes to connect with him is most unusual. It
is through a young guy by the name of Simeon Slotsky, who is a teller in Israel
Ib's jug, and who sees Silk dancing one night in the Follies and goes right off
his ka-zip about her.</p>

<p>It is this Simeon Slotsky who is sending the jewellery that Silk first
brings around, and the way he is buying this jewellery is by copping a little
dough out of the jug now and then which does not belong to him. Naturally this
is a most dishonest action, and by and by they catch up with Simeon Slotsky in
the jug, and Israel Ib is going to place him in the pokey.</p>

<p>Well, Simeon Slotsky does not wish to be placed in the pokey and not knowing
what else to do, what does he do but go to Silk and tell her his story,
explaining that he commits his dishonest business only because he is daffy
about her, even though Silk never gives him a tumble, and in fact never says as
much as two words to him before.</p>

<p>He tells her that he comes of respectable old parents down on the lower East
Side, who will be very sad if he is placed in the pokey, especially his mamma,
but Israel Ib is bound and determined to put him away, because Israel Ib is
greatly opposed to anybody copping dough out of his jug. Simeon Slotsky says
his mamma cries all over Israel Ib's vest trying to cry him out of the idea of
placing her son in the pokey, but that Israel Ib is a very hardhearted guy and
will not give in no matter what, and furthermore he is very indignant because
Simeon's mamma's tears spot up his vest. So Simeon says it looks as if he must
go to the pokey unless Silk can think of something.</p>

<p>Now Silk is very young herself and very tender hearted and she is sorry for
Simeon Slotsky, because she can see he is nothing but a hundred-per-cent chump,
so she sits down and writes a letter to Israel Ib asking him to call on her
backstage at the Follies on a matter of great importance. Of course Silk does
not know that it is not the proper caper to be writing a banker such a letter,
and ordinarily it is a thousand to one, according to the way The Greek figures
the odds, that a banker will pay no attention to such a letter except maybe to
notify his lawyer.</p>

<p>But it seems that the letter tickles Israel Ib, as he always secretly wishes
to get a peek backstage at the Follies to see if the dolls back there wear as
few clothes as he hears, so he shows up the very same night, and in five
minutes Silk has him all rounded up as far as Simeon Slotsky is concerned.
Israel Ib says he will straighten out everything and send Simeon to a job in a
jug out West.</p>

<p>So the next day Simeon Slotsky comes around and thanks Silk for all she does
for him, and bawls quite some, and gets a photograph off her with her name
signed to it which he says he will give to his mamma so she can stick it up on
her wall on the East Side to always remember the doll who saves her son, and
then Simeon Slolsky goes on about his business, and for all I know becomes a
very honest and useful citizen. And forty-eight hours later, Silk is wearing
the emerald from Israel lb.</p>

<p>Now this Israel Ib is by no means a Broadway character, and in fact few ever
hear of him before he bobs up sending Silk an emerald ring. In fact, it seems
that Israel Ib is a quiet, industrious guy, who has nothing on his mind but
running his jug and making plenty of scratch until the night he goes to see
Silk.</p>

<p>He is a little short fat guy of maybe forty-odd at this time with a little
round stomach sticking out in front of him and he always wears a white vest on
his stomach, with a pair of gold-rimmed cheaters hanging on a black ribbon
across the vest. He has a large snozzle and is as homely as a mud fence, anyway
you take him, but it is well known to one and all that he is a coming guy in
the banking dodge.</p>

<p>Silk is always making jokes about Israel Ib, because naturally she cannot
see much to such a looking guy, but every morning she comes into Mindy's with
all kinds of swag, such as bracelets and rings and brooches, and Jewellery Joe
finally speaks to her very severely and tells her that a guy who can send her
such merchandise is no joking matter.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that Israel Ib is dizzy about her, and personally I
consider it very sad that a guy as smart as he must be lets himself get tangled
up in such a situation. But then I remember that guys ten thousand times
smarter than Israel Ib let themselves get tangled up the same way, so it is all
even.</p>

<p>The upshot of the whole business is that Silk begins to pay a little serious
attention to Israel Ib, and the next thing anybody knows she quits the Follies
and takes to living in a large apartment on Park Avenue and riding around in a
big car with a guy in uniform driving her, and she has enough fur coats for a
tribe of Eskimos, including a chinchilla flogger that moves Israel back thirty
G's.</p>

<p>Furthermore, it comes out that the apartment house she is living in is in
her own name, and some citizens are greatly surprised, as they do not figure a
doll just off Broadway smart enough to get anything in her own name, except
maybe a traffic summons. But Professor D says he is not surprised because he
once makes Silk read a book entitled <i>The Importance of Property</i>.</p>

<p>We do not see much of Silk any more these days, but every now and then we
hear rumours of her getting more apartment houses and business buildings in her
own name, and the citizens around Mindy's are greatly pleased because they
figure it proves that the trouble they take educating Silk is by no means
wasted. Finally we hear Silk goes to Europe, and for nearly two years she is
living in Paris and other spots, and some say the reason she sticks around
Europe is because she finds out all of a sudden that Israel Ib is a married
guy, although personally I figure Silk must know this all along, because it
certainly is no mystery. In fact, Israel Ib is very much married, indeed, and
his ever-loving wife is a big fat old doll whose family has plenty of
potatoes.</p>

<p>The chances are Silk is sick and tired of looking at Israel Ib, and stays
abroad so she will not have to look at his ugly kisser more than two or three
times a year, which is about as often as Israel Ib can think up excuses to go
over and see her. Then one winter we hear that Silk is coming home to stay, and
it is the winter of 1930 when things are very tough, indeed.</p>

<p>It is close to Christmas when Silk lands one morning around eleven o'clock
from the steamship, and it seems she is expecting Israel Ib to meet her at the
dock, but Israel Ib is not present, and nobody else is there to tell her why
Israel Ib is absent.</p>

<p>It seems that some of Silk's luggage is being held up by the customs guys,
as she brings over enough merchandise of one kind and another to stock a
department store, and she wishes to see Israel Ib to get this matter
straightened out, so she hires a taxi and tells the jockey to take her to
Israel Ib's jug, figuring to stop in a minute and give Israel Ib his
instructions, and maybe a good rousting around for not meeting her.</p>

<p>Now Silk never before goes to Israel Ib's jug, which is deep down on the
lower East Side where many citizens wear long whiskers and do not speak much
English, and where there always seems to be a smell of herring around and
about, and she is greatly surprised and much disgusted by her surroundings as
she approaches the corner where Israel Ib's jug stands.</p>

<p>Furthermore, she is much surprised to find a big crowd in front of the jug,
and this crowd is made up of many whiskers and old dolls wearing shawls over
their heads, and kids of all sizes and shapes, and everybody in the crowd seems
much excited, and there is plenty of moaning and groaning from one and all, and
especially from an old doll who is standing in the doorway of a little store a
couple of doors from the jug.</p>

<p>In fact, this old doll is making more racket than all the rest of the crowd
put together, and at times is raising her voice to a scream and crying out in a
strange language words that sound quite hostile.</p>

<p>Silk's taxi cannot get through the mob and a copper steps up and tells the
driver he better make a detour, so Silk asks the copper why these people are
raising such a rumpus in the street, instead of being home keeping warm, for it
is colder than a blonde's heart, and there is plenty of ice around about.</p>

<p>'Why,' the copper says, 'do you not hear? This jug busts this morning and
the guy who runs it, Israel Ib, is over in the Tombs, and the people are
nervous because many of them have their potatoes in the jug. In fact,' the
copper says, 'some of them, including the old doll over there in front of the
store who is doing all the screeching, have their lifetime savings in this jug,
and it looks as if they are ruined. It is very sad,' he says, 'because they are
very, very poor people.'</p>

<p>And then tears come to his eyes, and he boffs an old guy with whiskers over
the skull with his club because the old guy is moaning so loud the copper can
scarcely make himself heard.</p>

<p>Now naturally all this is most surprising news to Silk, and while she is
pretty much sored up because she cannot see Israel Ib to get her merchandise
out of the customs, she has the taxi jockey take her away from these scenes
right away, and up to her apartment in Park Avenue, which she has ready for her
coming home. Then she sends out for the early editions of the evening papers
and reads all about what a rapscallion Israel Ib is for letting his jug bust
right in the poor people's faces.</p>

<p>It seems that Israel Ib is placed in the Tombs because somebody suspects
something illegal about the busting, but of course nobody figures Israel Ib
will be kept in the Tombs long on account of being a banker, and in fact there
is already some talk that the parties who placed him there in the first place
may find themselves in plenty of heat later on, because it is considered most
discourteous to a banker to place him in the Tombs where the accommodations are
by no means first class.</p>

<p>One of the papers has a story about Israel Ib's ever-loving wife taking it
on the lam as soon as the news gets out about the jug busting and Israel Ib
being in the Tombs, and about her saying he can get out of this predicament the
best way he can, but that she will never help with as much as a thin dime of
her dough and hinting pretty strong that Israel Ib's trouble is on account of
him squandering the jug's scratch on a doll.</p>

<p>The story says she is going back to her people, and from the way the story
reads it sounds as if the scribe who writes it figures this is one good break,
at least, for Israel lb.</p>

<p>Now these hints let out by Israel Ib's ever-loving wife about him
squandering the jug's scratch on a doll are printed as facts in the morning
papers the next morning, and maybe if Silk bothers to read these morning sheets
she will think better of going down to Israel Ib's jug again, because her name
is mentioned right out, and there are big pictures of her in the papers from
her old days in the Follies.</p>

<p>But there Silk is in a taxi in front of the Bank of the Bridges at nine
o'clock the next morning, and it seems her brain is buzzing with quite a large
idea, although this idea does not come out until later.</p>

<p>There is already quite a crowd around the jug again, as it is always very
difficult to make people who live on the lower East Side and wear whiskers and
shawls understand about such matters as busted jugs. They are apt to hang
around a busted jug for days at a time with their bank-books in their hands,
and sometimes it takes as much as a week to convince such people that their
potatoes are gone for good, and make them disperse to their homes and start
saving more.</p>

<p>There is still much moaning and groaning, though not as much as the day
before, and every now and then the old doll pops out of the little store and
stands in the doorway and shakes her fist at the busted jug and hollers in a
strange language. A short, greasy-looking guy with bristly whiskers and an old
black derby hat jammed down over his ears is standing with a morning paper
spread out in his hands, and a bunch of other guys are around him listening to
him read what the paper has to say about the situation.</p>

<p>Just one copper is walking up and down now, and it is the copper who speaks
to Silk the day before, and he seems to remember her as she gets out of the
taxi and he walks over to her, while a lot of people stop moaning and groaning
to take a gander at her, for it is by no means a common sight to see such a
looking doll in this neighbourhood.</p>

<p>The copper no more than says good morning to Silk when the guy who is
reading the paper stops reading and takes a peek at her, and then at her
picture which is on the page in front of him. Then he points at the picture and
points at Silk, and begins jabbering a blue streak to the guys around him.
About this time the old doll peeps out of the store to shake her fist at Israel
Ib's jug again and, hearing the jabbering, she joins the bunch around the guy
with the paper.</p>

<p>She listens to the jabbering a while, peeking over the guy's shoulder at the
picture, and then taking a good long look at Silk, and then all of a sudden the
old doll turns and pops back into the store.</p>

<p>Now all the shawls and whiskers start gathering around Silk and the copper,
and anybody can tell from the way they are looking that they are all sored up,
and what they are sored up at is Silk, because naturally they figure out that
she is the doll whose picture is in the morning paper and is therefore the doll
who is responsible for Israel Ib's jug busting.</p>

<p>But of course the copper does not know that they are sored up at Silk, and
figures they are gathering around just out of curiosity, as people will do when
they see a copper talking to anybody. He is a young copper and naturally he
does not wish to have an audience when he is speaking to such a looking doll as
Silk, even if most of the audience cannot understand English, so as the crowd
nudges closer he gets his club ready to boff a few skulls.</p>

<p>Just about then half a brickbat hits him under the right ear, and he begins
wobbling about very loose at the hinges, and at the same minute all the shawls
and whiskers take to pulling and hauling at Silk. There are about a hundred of
the shawls and whiskers to begin with and more are coming-up from every-which
direction, and they are all yelling and screaming and punching and scratching
at Silk.</p>

<p>She is knocked down two or three times, and many shawls and whiskers are
walking up and down her person while she is on the ground, and she is bleeding
here and there, and the chances are they will kill her as dead as a door-nail
in their excitement if the old doll from the little store near the jug does not
bob up all of a sudden with a mop handle in her duke and starts boffing the
shawls and whiskers on their noggins.</p>

<p>In fact, the old doll plays a regular tune on these noggins with the mop
handle, sometimes knocking a shawl or whiskers quite bow-legged, and soon
clearing a path through the crowd to Silk and taking hold of Silk and dragging
her off into the store just as the reserves and an ambulance arrive.</p>

<p>The young copper is still wobbling about from the brickbat and speaking of
how he hears the birdies singing in the trees, although of course there are no
birdies in this neighbourhood at such a time of year, and no trees either, and
there are maybe half a dozen shawls and whiskers sitting on the pavement
rubbing their noggins, and others are diving into doorways here and there, and
there is much confusion generally.</p>

<p>So the ambulance takes Silk and some of the shawls and whiskers to a
hospital and Professor D and Doc Daro visit her there a couple of hours later,
finding her in bed somewhat plastered up in spots but in no danger, and
naturally Professor D and Doc Daro wish to know what she is doing around Israel
Ib's jug, anyway.</p>

<p>'Why,' Silk says, 'I am not able to sleep a wink all last night thinking of
these poor people suffering on account of me taking Israel Ib's dough,
although,' Silk says, 'of course I do not know it is wrong dough when I receive
it. I do not know Israel Ib is clipping these poor people. But seeing them
around the jug yesterday morning, I remember what happens to my poor mamma when
the jug busts on her. I see her standing in front of the busted jug with me
beside her, crying her eyes out, and my heart is very heavy,' Silk says. 'So I
get to thinking,' she says, 'that it will be a very nice thing, indeed, if I am
first to tell the poor souls who have their dough in Israel Ib's jug that they
are going to get it back.'</p>

<p>'Wait a minute,' Doc Daro says. 'What do you mean--they are going to get
their dough back?'</p>

<p>'Why,' Silk says, 'I consult with Judge Goldstein, who is my tongue, and a
very good guy, at that, and fairly honest, last night, and Judge Goldstein
tells me that I am worth in negotiable securities and real estate and
jewellery, and one thing and another, about three million one hundred bobs, and
a few odd cents.</p>

<p>'Judge Goldstein tells me,' Silk says, 'that such a sum will more than pay
off all the depositors in Israel Ib's jug. In fact, Judge Goldstein tells me
that what I have probably represents most of the deposits in the jug, and,' she
says, 'I sign everything I own in this world over to Judge Goldstein to do
this, although Judge Goldstein says there is no doubt I can beat any attempt to
take my dough away from me if I wish to keep it.</p>

<p>'So,' Silk says, 'I am so happy to think these poor people will get their
dough back that I cannot wait for Judge Goldstein to let it out. I wish to
break the news to them myself, but,' Silk says, 'before I can say a word they
hop on me and start giving me a pasting, and if it is not for the old doll with
the mop handle maybe you will have to chip in to bury me, because I certainly
do not have enough dough left to bury myself.'</p>

<p>Well, this is about all there is to this story, except that the Bank of the
Bridges pays off one hundred per cent. on the dollar, and what is more Israel
Ib is running it again, and doing very well, indeed, and his ever-loving wife
returns to him, and everything is hotsy-totsy between them.</p>

<p>As for Silk, she is back on Broadway, and the last time I see her she is in
love with a very legitimate guy who is in the hotel business, and while he does
not strike me as having much brains, he has plenty of youth running for him,
and Silk says it is the best break she ever gets in her life when Israel Ib's
jug busts.</p>

<p>But anybody will tell you that the best break Silk ever gets is when the old
doll on the lower East Side recognizes her from the photograph she has stuck up
on the wall in the little store near Israel Ib's jug as the doll who once saves
her son, Simeon Slotsky, from being placed in the pokey.</p>

<h3><a name="The_Brain_Goes_Home" id="The_Brain_Goes_Home">The Brain Goes Home</a></h3>
<p>One night The Brain is walking me up and down Broadway in front of Mindy's
Restaurant, and speaking of this and that, when along comes a red-headed
raggedy doll selling apples at five cents per copy, and The Brain, being very
fond of apples, grabs one out of her basket and hands her a five-dollar
bill.</p>

<p>The red-headed raggedy doll, who is maybe thirty-odd and is nothing but a
crow as far as looks are concerned, squints at the finnif, and says to The
Brain like this:</p>

<p>'I do not have change for so much money,' she says, 'but I will go and get
it in a minute.'</p>

<p>'You keep the change,' The Brain says, biting a big hunk out of the apple
and taking my arm to start me walking again.</p>

<p>Well, the raggedy doll looks at The Brain again, and it seems to me that all
of a sudden there are large tears in her eyes as she says:</p>

<p>'Oh, thank you, sir! Thank you, thank you, and God bless you, sir!'</p>

<p>And then she goes on up the street in a hurry, with her hands over her eyes
and her shoulders shaking, and The Brain turns around very much astonished, and
watches her until she is out of sight.</p>

<p>'Why, my goodness!' The Brain says. 'I give Doris Clare ten G's last night,
and she does not make half as much fuss over it as this doll does over a pound
note.'</p>

<p>'Well,' I say 'maybe the apple doll needs a pound note more than Doris needs
ten G's.'</p>

<p>'Maybe so,' The Brain says. 'And of course, Doris gives me much more in
return than just an apple and a God bless me. Doris gives me her love. I
guess,' The Brain says, 'that love costs me about as much dough as any guy that
ever lives.'</p>

<p>'I guess it does,' I say, and the chances are we both guess right, because
off-hand I figure that if The Brain gets out on three hundred G's per year for
love, he is running his love business very economically indeed, because it is
well known to one and all that The Brain has three different dolls, besides an
ever-loving wife.</p>

<p>In fact, The Brain is sometimes spoken of by many citizens as the 'Love
King,' but only behind his back, because The Brain likes to think his love
affairs are a great secret to all but maybe a few, although the only guy I ever
see in this town who does not know all about them is a guy who is deaf, dumb,
and blind.</p>

<p>I once read a story about a guy by the name of King Solomon who lives a long
time ago and who has a thousand dolls all at once, which is going in for dolls
on a very large scale indeed, but I guarantee that all of King Solomon's dolls
put together are not as expensive as anyone of The Brain's dolls. The overhead
on Doris Clare alone will drive an ordinary guy daffy, and Doris is practically
frugal compared to Cynthia Harris and Bobby Baker.</p>

<p>Then there is Charlotte, who is The Brain's ever-loving wife and who has a
society bug and needs plenty of coconuts at all times to keep her a going
concern. I once hear The Brain tell Bobby Baker that his ever-loving wife is a
bit of an invalid, but as a matter of fact there is never anything the matter
with Charlotte that a few bobs will not cure, although of course this goes for
nearly every doll in this world who is an invalid.</p>

<p>When a guy is knocking around Broadway as long as The Brain, he is bound to
accumulate dolls here and there, but most guys accumulate one at a time, and
when this one runs out on him, as Broadway dolls will do, he accumulates
another, and so on, and so on, until he is too old to care about such matters
as dolls, which is when he is maybe a hundred and four years old, although I
hear of several guys who beat even this record.</p>

<p>But when The Brain accumulates a doll he seems to keep her accumulated, and
none of them ever run out on him, and while this will be a very great nuisance
to the average guy, it pleases The Brain no little because it makes him think
he has a very great power over dolls.</p>

<p>'They are not to blame if they fall in love with me,' The Brain says to me
one night. 'I will not cause one of them any sorrow for all the world.'</p>

<p>Well, of course, it is most astonishing to me to hear a guy as smart as The
Brain using such language, but I figure he may really believe it, because The
Brain thinks very good of himself at all times. However, some guys claim that
the real reason The Brain keeps all his dolls is because he is too selfish to
give them away, although personally I will not take any of them if The Brain
throws in a cash bonus, except maybe Bobby Baker.</p>

<p>Anyway, The Brain keeps his dolls accumulated, and furthermore he spends
plenty of dough on them, what with buying them automobiles and furs and
diamonds and swell places to live in -- especially swell places to live in. One
time I tell The Brain he will save himself plenty if he hires a house and
bunches his dolls together in one big happy family, instead of having them
scattered all over town, but The Brain says this idea is no good.</p>

<p>'In the first place,' he says, 'they do not know about each other, except
Doris and Cynthia and Bobby know about Charlotte, although she does not know
about them. They each think they are the only one with me. So if I corral them
all together they will be jealous of each other over my love. Anyway,' The
Brain says, 'such an arrangement will be very immoral and against the law. No,'
he says, 'it is better to have them in different spots, because think of the
many homes it gives me to go to in case I wish to go home. In fact,' The Brain
says, 'I guess I have more homes to go to than any other guy on Broadway.'</p>

<p>Well, this may be true, but what The Brain wants with a lot of different
homes is a very great mystery on Broadway, because he seldom goes home, anyway,
his idea in not going home being that something may happen in this town while
he is at home that he is not in on. The Brain seldom goes anywhere in
particular. He never goes out in public with anyone of his dolls, except maybe
once or twice a year with Charlotte, his ever-loving wife, and finally he even
stops going with her because Doris Clare says it does not look good to Doris's
personal friends.</p>

<p>The Brain marries Charlotte long before he becomes the biggest guy in
gambling operations in the East, and a millionaire two or three times over, but
he is never much of a hand to sit around home and chew the fat with his
ever-loving wife, as husbands often do. Furthermore, when he is poor he has to
live in a neighbourhood which is too far away for it to be convenient for him
to go home, so finally he gets out of the habit of going there.</p>

<p>But Charlotte is not such a doll as cares to spend more than one or two
years looking at the pictures on the wall, because it seems the pictures on the
wall are nothing but pictures of cows in the meadows and houses covered with
snow, so she does not go home any more than necessary, either, and has her own
friends and is very happy indeed, especially after The Brain gets so he can
send in right along.</p>

<p>I will say one thing about The Brain and his dolls: he never picks a crow.
He has a very good eye for faces and shapes, and even Charlotte, his
ever-loving wife, is not a crow, although she is not as young as she used to
be. As for Doris Clare, she is one of the great beauties on the Ziegfeld roof
in her day, and while her day is by no means yesterday, or even the day before,
Doris holds on pretty well in the matter of looks. Giving her a shade the best
of it, I will say that Doris is thirty-two or -three, but she has plenty of
zing left in her, at that, and her hair remains very blonde, no matter
what.</p>

<p>In fact, The Brain does not care much if his dolls are blonde or brunette,
because Cynthia Harris's hair is as black as the inside of a wolf, while Bobby
Baker is betwixt and between, her hair being a light brown. Cynthia Harris is
more of a Johnny-come-lately than Doris, being out of Mr. Earl Carroll's
'Vanities,' and I hear she first comes to New York as Miss Somebody in one of
these beauty contests which she will win hands down if one of the judges does
not get a big wink from a Miss Somebody Else.</p>

<p>Of course, Cynthia is doing some winking herself at this time, but it seems
that she picks a guy to wink at thinking he is one of the judges, when he is
nothing but a newspaperman and has no say whatever about the decision.</p>

<p>Well, Mr. Earl Carroll feels sorry for Cynthia, so he puts her in the
'Vanities' and lets her walk around raw, and The Brain sees her, and the next
thing anybody knows she is riding in a big foreign automobile the size of a rum
chaser, and is chucking a terrible swell.</p>

<p>Personally, I always consider Bobby Baker the smartest of all The Brain's
dolls, because she is just middling as to looks and she does not have any of
the advantages of life like Doris Clare and Cynthia Harris, such as jobs on the
stage where they can walk around showing off their shapes to guys such as The
Brain. Bobby Baker starts off as nothing but a private secretary to a guy in
Wall Street, and naturally she is always wearing clothes, or anyway, as many
clothes as an ordinary doll wears nowadays, which is not so many, at that.</p>

<p>It seems that The Brain once has some business with the guy Bobby works for
and happens to get talking to Bobby, and she tells him how she always wishes to
meet him, what with hearing and reading about him, and how he is just as
handsome and romantic-looking as she always pictures him to herself.</p>

<p>Now I wish to say I will never call any doll a liar, being at all times a
gentleman, and for all I know, Bobby Baker may really think The Brain is
handsome and romantic-looking, but personally I figure if she is not lying to
him, she is at least a little excited when she makes such a statement to The
Brain. The best you can give The Brain at this time is that he is very well
dressed.</p>

<p>He is maybe forty years old, give or take a couple of years, and he is
commencing to get a little bunchy about the middle, what with sitting down at
card-tables so much and never taking any exercise outside of walking guys such
as me up and down in front of Mindy's for a few hours every night. He has a
clean-looking face, always very white around the gills, and he has nice teeth
and a nice smile when he wishes to smile, which is never at guys who owe him
dough.</p>

<p>And I will say for The Brain he has what is called personality. He tells a
story well, although he is always the hero of any story he tells, and he knows
how to make himself agreeable to dolls in many ways. He has a pretty fair sort
of education, and while dolls such as Cynthia and Doris and maybe Charlotte,
too, will rather have a charge account at Cartier's than all the education in
Yale and Harvard put together, it seems that Bobby Baker likes highbrow gab, so
naturally she gets plenty of same from The Brain.</p>

<p>Well, pretty soon Bobby is riding around in a car bigger than Cynthia's,
though neither is as big as Doris's car, and all the neighbours' children over
in Flatbush, which is where Bobby hails from, are very jealous of her and
running around spreading gossip about her, but keeping their eyes open for big
cars themselves. Personally, I always figure The Brain lowers himself socially
by taking up with a doll from Flatbush, especially as Bobby Baker soon goes in
for literary guys, such as newspaper scribes and similar characters around
Greenwich Village.</p>

<p>But there is no denying Bobby Baker is a very smart little doll, and in the
four or five years she is one of The Brain's dolls, she gets more dough out of
him than all the others put together, because she is always telling him how
much she loves him, and saying she cannot do without him, while Doris Clare and
Cynthia Harris sometimes forget to mention this more than once or twice a
month.</p>

<p>Now what happens early one morning but a guy by the name of Daffy Jack hauls
off and sticks a shiv in The Brain's left side. It seems that this is done at
the request of a certain party by the name of Homer Swing, who owes The Brain
plenty of dough in a gambling transaction, and who becomes very indignant when
The Brain presses him somewhat for payment. It seems that Daffy Jack, who is
considered a very good shiv artist, aims at The Brain's heart, but misses it by
a couple of inches, leaving The Brain with a very bad cut in his side which
calls for some stitching.</p>

<p>Big Nig, the crap shooter, and I are standing at Fifty-second Street and
Seventh Avenue along about 2 a.m. speaking of not much, when The Brain comes
stumbling out of Fifty-second Street, and falls in Big Nig's arms, practically
ruining a brand-new topcoat which Big Nig pays sixty bucks for a few days back
with the blood that is coming out of the cut. Naturally, Big Nig is indignant
about this, but we can see that it is no time to be speaking to The Brain about
such matters. We can see that The Brain is carved up quite some, and is in a
bad way.</p>

<p>Of course, we are not greatly surprised at seeing The Brain in this
condition, because for years he is practically no price around this town, what
with this guy and that being anxious to do something or other to him, but we
are never expecting to see him carved up like a turkey. We are expecting to see
him with a few slugs in him, and both Big Nig and me are very angry to think
that there are guys around who will use such instruments as a knife on
anybody.</p>

<p>But while we are thinking it over, The Brain says to me like this: 'Call
Hymie Weissberger, and Doc Frisch,' he says, 'and take me home.'</p>

<p>Naturally, a guy such as The Brain wishes his lawyer before he wishes his
doctor, and Hymie Weissberger is The Brain's mouthpiece, and a very sure-footed
guy, at that.</p>

<p>'Well,' I say, 'we better take you to a hospital where you can get good
attention at once.'</p>

<p>'No,' The Brain says. 'I wish to keep this secret. It will be a bad thing
for me right now to have this get out, and if you take me to a hospital they
must report it to the coppers. Take me home.'</p>

<p>Naturally, I say which home, being somewhat confused about The Brain's
homes, and he seems to study a minute as if this is a question to be well
thought out.</p>

<p>'Park Avenue,' The Brain says finally, so Big Nig stops a taxicab, and we
help The Brain into the cab and tell the jockey to take us to the apartment
house on Park Avenue near Sixty-fourth where The Brain's ever-loving wife
Charlotte lives.</p>

<p>When we get there, I figure it is best for me to go up first and break the
news gently to Charlotte, because I can see what a shock it is bound to be to
any ever-loving wife to have her husband brought home in the early hours of the
morning all shivved up.</p>

<p>Well, the door man and the elevator guy in the apartment house give me an
argument about going up to The Brain's apartment, saying a blow-out of some
kind is going on there, but after I explain to them that The Brain is sick,
they let me go. A big fat butler comes to the door of the apartment when I
ring, and I can see there are many dolls and guys in evening clothes in the
apartment, and somebody is singing very loud.</p>

<p>The butler tries to tell me I cannot see Charlotte, but I finally convince
him it is best, so by and by she comes to the door, and a very pleasant sight
she is, at that, with jewellery all over her. I stall around awhile, so as not
to alarm her too much, and then I tell her The Brain meets with an accident and
that we have him outside in a cab, and ask her where we shall put him.</p>

<p>'Why,' she says, 'put him in a hospital, of course. I am entertaining some
very important people to-night, and I cannot have them disturbed by bringing in
a hospital patient. Take him to hospital, and tell him I will come and see him
to-morrow and bring him some broth.'</p>

<p>I try to explain to her that The Brain does not need any broth, but a nice
place to lie down in, but finally she gets very testy with me and shuts the
door in my face, saying as follows:</p>

<p>'Take him to a hospital, I tell you. This is a ridiculous hour for him to be
coming home, anyway. It is twenty years since he comes home so early.'</p>

<p>Then as I am waiting for the elevator, she opens the door again just a
little bit and says:</p>

<p>'By the way, is he hurt bad?'</p>

<p>I say we do not know how bad he is hurt, and she shuts the door again, and I
go back to the cab again, thinking what a heartless doll she is, although I can
see where it will be very inconvenient for her to bust up her party, at
that.</p>

<p>The Brain is lying back in the corner of the cab, his eyes half closed, and
by this time it seems that Big Nig stops the blood somewhat with a
handkerchief, but The Brain acts somewhat weak to me. He sort of rouses himself
when I climb in the cab, and when I tell him his ever-loving wife is not home
he smiles a bit and whispers:</p>

<p>'Take me to Doris.'</p>

<p>Now Doris lives in a big apartment house away over on West Seventy-second
Street near the Drive, and I tell the taxi jockey to go there while The Brain
seems to slide off into a doze. Then Big Nig leans over to me and says to me
like this:</p>

<p>'No use taking him there,' Big Nig says. 'I see Doris going out tonight all
dressed up in her ermine coat with this actor guy, Jack Walen, she is struck
on. It is a very great scandal around and about the way they carry on. Let us
take him to Cynthia,' Nig says. 'She is a very large-hearted doll who will be
very glad to take him in.'</p>

<p>Now Cynthia Harris has a big suite of rooms that cost fifteen G's a year in
a big hotel just off Fifth Avenue, Cynthia being a doll who likes to be
downtown so if she hears of anything coming off anywhere she can get there very
rapidly. When we arrive at the hotel I call her on the house 'phone and tell
her I must see her about something very important, so Cynthia says for me to
come up.</p>

<p>It is now maybe three-fifteen, and I am somewhat surprised to find Cynthia
home, at that, but there she is, and looking very beautiful indeed in a
negligee with her hair hanging down, and I can see that The Brain is no chump
when it comes to picking them. She gives me a hello pleasant enough, but as
soon as I explain what I am there for, her kisser gets very stern and she says
to me like this:</p>

<p>'Listen,' she says, 'I got trouble enough around this joint, what with two
guys getting in a fight over me at a little gathering I have here last night
and the house copper coming to split them out, and I do not care to have any
more. Suppose it gets out that The Brain is here? What will the newspapers
print about me? Think of my reputation!'</p>

<p>Well, in about ten minutes I can see there is no use arguing with her,
because she can talk faster than I can, and mostly she talks about what a knock
it will be to her reputation if she takes The Brain in, so I leave her standing
at the door in her negligee, still looking very beautiful, at that.</p>

<p>There is now nothing for us to do but take The Brain to Bobby Baker, who
lives in a duplex apartment in Sutton Place over by the East River, where the
swells set up a colony of nice apartments in the heart of an old tenement-house
neighbourhood, and as we are on our way there with The Brain lying back in the
cab just barely breathing, I say to Big Nig like this:</p>

<p>'Nig,' I say, 'when we get to Bobby's, we will carry The Brain in without
asking her first and just dump him on her so she cannot refuse to take him in,
although,' I say, 'Bobby Baker is a nice little doll, and I am pretty sure she
will do anything she can for him, especially,' I say, 'since he pays fifty G's
for this apartment we are going to.'</p>

<p>So when the taxicab stops in front of Bobby's house, Nig and I take The
Brain out of the cab and lug him between us up to the door of Bobby's
apartment, where I ring the bell. Bobby opens the door herself, and I happen to
see a guy's legs zip into a room in the apartment behind her, although of
course there is nothing wrong in such a sight, even though the guy's legs are
in pink pyjamas.</p>

<p>Naturally, Bobby is greatly astonished to see us with The Brain dangling
between us, but she does not invite us in as I explain to her that The Brain is
stabbed and that his last words are for us to take him to his Bobby.
Furthermore, she does not let me finish my story which will be very sad indeed,
if she keeps on listening.</p>

<p>'If you do not take him away from here at once,' Bobby says, before I am
down to the pathetic part, 'I will call the cops and you guys will be arrested
on suspicion that you know something about how he gets hurt.'</p>

<p>Then she slams the door on us, and we lug The Brain back down the stairs
into the street, because all of a sudden it strikes us that Bobby is right, and
if The Brain is found in our possession all stabbed up, and he happens to
croak, we are in a very tough spot, because the cops just naturally love to
refuse to believe guys like Big Nig and me, no matter what we say.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the same idea must hit the taxicab jockey after we lift The
Brain out of the cab, because he is nowhere to be seen, and there we are away
over by the East River in the early morning, with no other taxis in sight, and
a cop liable to happen along any minute.</p>

<p>Well, there is nothing for us to do but get away from there, so Big Nig and
I start moving, with me carrying The Brain's feet, and Big Nig his head. We get
several blocks away from Sutton Place, going very slow and hiding in dark
doorways when we hear anybody coming, and now we are in a section of tenement
houses, when all of a sudden up out of the basement of one of these tenements
pops a doll.</p>

<p>She sees us before we can get in a dark place, and she seems to have plenty
of nerve for a doll, because she comes right over to us and looks at Big Nig
and me, and then looks at The Brain, who loses his hat somewhere along the
line, so his pale face is plain to be seen by even the dim street light.</p>

<p>'Why,' the doll says, 'it is the kind gentleman who gives me the five
dollars for the apple--the money that buys the medicine that saves my Joey's
life. What is the matter?'</p>

<p>'Well,' I say to the doll, who is still raggedy and still red-headed, 'there
is nothing much the matter except if we do not get him somewhere soon, this guy
will up and croak on us.'</p>

<p>'Bring him into my house,' she says, pointing to the joint she just comes
out of. 'It is not much of a place, but you can let him rest there until you
get help. I am just going over here to a drug store to get some more medicine
for Joey, although he is out of danger now, thanks to this gentleman.'</p>

<p>So we lug The Brain down the basement steps with the doll leading the way,
and we follow her into a room that smells like a Chinese laundry and seems to
be full of kids sleeping on the floor. There is only one bed in the room, and
it is not much of a bed any way you take it, and there seems to be a kid in
this bed, too, but the red-headed doll rolls this kid over to one side of the
bed and motions us to lay The Brain alongside of the kid. Then she gets a wet
rag and stars bathing The Brain's noggin.</p>

<p>He finally opens his eyes and looks at the red-headed raggedy doll, and she
grins at him very pleasant. When I think things over afterwards, I figure The
Brain is conscious of much of what is going on when we are packing him around,
although he does not say anything, maybe because he is too weak. Anyway, he
turns his head to Big Nig, and says to him like this:</p>

<p>'Bring Weissberger and Frisch as quick as you can,' he says. 'Anyway, get
Weissberger. I do not know how bad I am hurt, and I must tell him some
things.'</p>

<p>Well, The Brain is hurt pretty bad, as it turns out, and in fact he never
gets well, but he stays in the basement dump until he dies three days later,
with the red-headed raggedy doll nursing him alongside her sick kid Joey,
because the croaker, old Doc Frisch, says it is no good moving The Brain, and
may only make him pop off sooner. In fact, Doc Frisch is much astonished that
The Brain lives at all, considering the way we lug him around.</p>

<p>I am present at The Brain's funeral at Wiggins's Funeral Parlours, like
everybody else on Broadway, and I wish to say I never see more flowers in all
my life. They are all over the casket and knee-deep on the floor, and some of
the pieces must cost plenty, the price of flowers being what they are in this
town nowadays. In fact, I judge it is the size and cost of the different pieces
that makes me notice a little bundle of faded red carnations not much bigger
than your fist that is laying alongside a pillow of violets the size of a horse
blanket.</p>

<p>There is a small card tied to the carnations, and it says on this card, as
follows: 'To a kind gentleman,' and it comes to my mind that out of all the
thousands of dollars' worth of flowers there, these faded carnations represent
the only true sincerity. I mention this to Big Nig, and he says the chances are
I am right, but that even true sincerity is not going to do The Brain any good
where he is going.</p>

<p>Anybody will tell you that for off-hand weeping at a funeral The Brain's
ever-loving wife Charlotte does herself very proud indeed, but she is not
one-two-seven with Doris Clare, Cynthia Harris, and Bobby Baker. In fact, Bobby
Baker weeps so loud that there is some talk of heaving her out of the funeral
altogether.</p>

<p>However, I afterwards hear that loud as they are at the funeral, it is
nothing to the weep they all put on when it comes out that The Brain has Hymie
Weissberger draw up a new will while he is dying and leaves all his dough to
the red-headed raggedy doll, whose name seems to be O'Halloran, and who is the
widow of a bricklayer and has five kids.</p>

<p>Well, at first all the citizens along Broadway say it is a wonderful thing
for The Brain to do, and serves his ever-loving wife and Doris and Cynthia and
Bobby just right; and from the way one and all speaks you will think they are
going to build a monument to The Brain for his generosity to the red-headed
raggedy doll.</p>

<p>But about two weeks after he is dead, I hear citizens saying the chances are
the red-headed raggedy doll is nothing but one of The Brain's old-time dolls,
and that maybe the kids are his and that he leaves them the dough because his
conscience hurts him at the finish, for this is the way Broadway is. But
personally I know it cannot be true, for if there is one thing The Brain never
has it is a conscience.</p>


<h2>FURTHERMORE</h2>


<h3><a name="Madame_La_Gimp" id="Madame_La_Gimp">Madame La Gimp</a></h3>
<p>One night I am passing the corner of Fiftieth Street and Broadway, and what
do I see but Dave the Dude standing in a doorway talking to a busted-down old
Spanish doll by the name of Madame La Gimp. Or rather Madame La Gimp is talking
to Dave the Dude, and what is more he is listening to her, because I can hear
him say yes, yes, as he always does when he is really listening to anybody,
which is very seldom.</p>

<p>Now this is a most surprising sight to me, because Madame La Gimp is not
such an old doll as anybody will wish to listen to, especially Dave the Dude.
In fact, she is nothing but an old haybag, and generally somewhat ginned up.
For fifteen years, or maybe sixteen, I see Madame La Gimp up and down Broadway,
or sliding along through the Forties, sometimes selling newspapers, and
sometimes selling flowers, and in all these years I seldom see her but what she
seems to have about half a heat on from drinking gin.</p>

<p>Of course, nobody ever takes the newspapers she sells, even after they buy
them off of her, because they are generally yesterday's papers, and sometimes
last week's, and nobody ever wants her flowers, even after they pay her for
them, because they are flowers such as she gets off an undertaker over in Tenth
Avenue, and they are very tired flowers, indeed.</p>

<p>Personally, I consider Madame La Gimp nothing but an old pest, but
kind-hearted guys like Dave the Dude always stake her to a few pieces of silver
when she comes shuffling along putting on the moan about her tough luck. She
walks with a gimp in one leg, which is why she is called Madame La Gimp, and
years ago I hear somebody say Madame La Gimp is once a Spanish dancer, and a
big shot on Broadway, but that she meets up with an accident which puts her out
of the dancing dodge, and that a busted romance makes her become a
gin-head.</p>

<p>I remember somebody telling me once that Madame La Gimp is quite a beauty in
her day, and has her own servants, and all this and that, but I always hear the
same thing about every bum on Broadway, male and female, including some I know
are bums, in spades, right from taw, so I do not pay any attention to these
stories.</p>

<p>Still, I am willing to allow that maybe Madame La Gimp is once a fair
looker, at that, and the chances are has a fair shape, because once or twice I
see her when she is not ginned up, and has her hair combed, and she is not so
bad-looking, although even then if you put her in a claiming race I do not
think there is any danger of anybody claiming her out of it.</p>

<p>Mostly she is wearing raggedy clothes, and busted shoes, and her grey hair
is generally hanging down her face, and when I say she is maybe fifty years old
I am giving her plenty the best of it. Although she is Spanish, Madame La Gimp
talks good English, and in fact she can cuss in English as good as anybody I
ever hear, barring Dave the Dude.</p>

<p>Well, anyway, when Dave the Dude sees me as he is listening to Madame La
Gimp, he motions me to wait, so I wait until she finally gets through gabbing
to him and goes gimping away. Then Dave the Dude comes over to me looking much
worried.</p>

<p>'This is quite a situation,' Dave says. 'The old doll is in a tough spot. It
seems that she once has a baby which she calls by the name of Eulalie, being it
is a girl baby, and she ships this baby off to her sister in a little town in
Spain to raise up, because Madame La Gimp figures a baby is not apt to get much
raising-up off of her as long as she is on Broadway. Well, this baby is on her
way here. In fact,' Dave says, 'she will land next Saturday and here it is
Wednesday already.'</p>

<p>'Where is the baby's papa?' I ask Dave the Dude.</p>

<p>'Well,' Dave says, 'I do not ask Madame La Gimp this, because I do not
consider it a fair question. A guy who goes around this town asking where
babies' papas are, or even who they are, is apt to get the name of being nosey.
Anyway, this has nothing whatever to do with the proposition, which is that
Madame La Gimp's baby, Eulalie, is arriving here.</p>

<p>'Now,' Dave says, 'it seems that Madame La Gimp's baby, being now eighteen
years old, is engaged to marry the son of a very proud old Spanish nobleman who
lives in this little town in Spain, and it also seems that the very proud old
Spanish nobleman, and his ever-loving wife, and the son, and Madame La Gimp's
sister, are all with the baby. They are making a tour of the whole world, and
will stop over here a couple of days just to see Madame La Gimp.'</p>

<p>'It is commencing to sound to me like a movie such as a guy is apt to see at
a midnight show,' I say.</p>

<p>'Wait a minute,' Dave says, getting impatient: 'You are too gabby to suit
me. Now it seems that the proud old Spanish nobleman does not wish his son to
marry any lob, and one reason he is coming here is to look over Madame La Gimp,
and see that she is okay. He thinks that Madame La Gimp's baby's own papa is
dead, and that Madame La Gimp is now married to one of the richest and most
aristocratic guys in America.'</p>

<p>'How does the proud old Spanish nobleman get such an idea as this?' I ask.
'It is a sure thing he never sees Madame La Gimp, or even a photograph of her
as she is at present.'</p>

<p>'I will tell you how,' Dave the Dude says. 'It seems Madame La Gimp gives
her baby the idea that such is the case in her letters to her. It seems Madame
La Gimp does a little scrubbing business around a swell apartment hotel in Park
Avenue that is called the Marberry, and she cops stationery there and writes
her baby in Spain on this stationery, saying this is where she lives, and how
rich and aristocratic her husband is. And what is more, Madame La Gimp has
letters from her baby sent to her care of the hotel and gets them out of the
employees' mail.'</p>

<p>'Why,' I say, 'Madame La Gimp is nothing but an old fraud to deceive people
in this manner, especially a proud old Spanish nobleman. And,' I say, 'this
proud old Spanish nobleman must be something of a chump to believe a mother
will keep away from her baby all these years, especially if the mother has
plenty of dough, although of course I do not know just how smart a proud old
Spanish nobleman can be.'</p>

<p>'Well,' Dave says, 'Madame La Gimp tells me the thing that makes the biggest
hit of all with the proud old Spanish nobleman is that she keeps her baby in
Spain all these years because she wishes her raised up a true Spanish baby in
every respect until she is old enough to know what time it is. But I judge the
proud old Spanish nobleman is none too bright, at that,' Dave says, 'because
Madame La Gimp tells me he always lives in his little town which does not even
have running water in the bathrooms.</p>

<p>'But what I am getting at is this,' Dave says. 'We must have Madame La Gimp
in a swell apartment in the Marberry with a rich and aristocratic guy for a
husband by the time her baby gets here, because if the proud old Spanish
nobleman finds out Madame La Gimp is nothing but a bum, it is a hundred to one
he will cancel his son's engagement to Madame La Gimp's baby and break a lot of
people's hearts, including his son's.</p>

<p>'Madame La Gimp tells me her baby is daffy about the young guy, and he is
daffy about her, and there are enough broken hearts in this town as it is. I
know how I will get the apartment, so you go and bring me Judge Henry G. Blake
for a rich and aristocratic husband, or anyway for a husband.'</p>

<p>Well, I know Dave the Dude to do many a daffy thing, but never a thing as
daffy as this. But I know there is no use arguing with him when he gets an
idea, because if you argue with Dave the Dude too much he is apt to reach over
and lay his Sunday punch on your snoot, and no argument is worth a punch on the
snoot, especially from Dave the Dude.</p>

<p>So I go out looking for Judge Henry G. Blake to be Madame La Gimp's husband,
although I am not so sure Judge Henry G. Blake will care to be anybody's
husband, and especially Madame La Gimp's after he gets a load of her, for Judge
Henry G. Blake is kind of a classy old guy.</p>

<p>To look at Judge Henry G. Blake, with his grey hair, and his nose glasses,
and his stomach, you will think he is very important people, indeed. Of course,
Judge Henry G. Blake is not a judge, and never is a judge, but they call him
Judge because he looks like a judge, and talks slow, and puts in many long
words, which very few people understand.</p>

<p>They tell me Judge Blake once has plenty of dough, and is quite a guy in
Wall Street, and a high shot along Broadway, but he misses a few guesses at the
market, and winds up without much dough, as guys generally do who miss guesses
at the market. What Judge Henry G. Blake does for a living at this time nobody
knows, because he does nothing much whatever, and yet he seems to be a producer
in a small way at all times.</p>

<p>Now and then he makes a trip across the ocean with such as Little Manuel,
and other guys who ride the tubs, and sits in with them on games of bridge, and
one thing and another, when they need him. Very often when he is riding the
tubs, Little Manuel runs into some guy he cannot cheat, so he has to call in
Judge Henry G. Blake to outplay the guy on the level, although of course Little
Manuel will much rather get a guy's dough by cheating him than by outplaying
him on the level. Why this is, I do not know, but this is the way Little Manuel
is.</p>

<p>Anyway, you cannot say Judge Henry G. Blake is a bum, especially as he wears
good clothes, with a wing collar, and a derby hat, and most people consider him
a very nice old man. Personally I never catch the judge out of line on any
proposition whatever, and he always says hello to me, very pleasant.</p>

<p>It takes me several hours to find Judge Henry G. Blake, but finally I locate
him in Derle's billiards-room playing a game of pool with a guy from
Providence, Rhode Island. It seems the judge is playing the guy from Providence
for five cents a ball, and the judge is about thirteen balls behind when I step
into the joint, because naturally at five cents a ball the judge wishes the guy
from Providence to win, so as to encourage him to play for maybe twenty-five
cents a ball, the judge being very cute this way.</p>

<p>Well, when I step in I see the judge miss a shot anybody can make
blindfolded, but as soon as I give him the office I wish to speak to him, the
judge hauls off and belts in every ball on the table, bingity-bing, the last
shot being a bank that will make Al de Oro stop and think, because when it
comes to pool, the old judge is just naturally a curly wolf.</p>

<p>Afterwards he tells me he is very sorry I make him hurry up this way,
because of course after the last shot he is never going to get the guy from
Providence to play him pool even for fun, and the judge tells me the guy sizes
up as a right good thing, at that.</p>

<p>Now Judge Henry G. Blake is not so excited when I tell him what Dave the
Dude wishes to see him about, but naturally he is willing to do anything for
Dave, because he knows that guys who are not willing to do things for Dave the
Dude often have bad luck. The judge tells me that he is afraid he will not make
much of a husband because he tries it before several times on his own hook and
is always a bust, but as long as this time it is not to be anything serious, he
will tackle it. Anyway, Judge Henry G. Blake says, being aristocratic will come
natural to him.</p>

<p>Well, when Dave the Dude starts out on any proposition, he is a wonder for
fast working. The first thing he does is to turn Madame La Gimp over to Miss
Billy Perry, who is now Dave's ever-loving wife which he takes out of
tap-dancing in Miss Missouri Martin's Sixteen Hundred Club, and Miss Billy
Perry calls in Miss Missouri Martin to help.</p>

<p>This is water on Miss Missouri Martin's wheel, because if there is anything
she loves it is to stick her nose in other people's business, no matter what it
is, but she is quite a help at that, although at first they have a tough time
keeping her from telling Waldo Winchester, the scribe, about the whole cat-hop,
so he will put a story in the Morning Item about it, with Miss Missouri
Martin's name in it. Miss Missouri Martin does not believe in ever overlooking
any publicity bets on the layout.</p>

<p>Anyway, it seems that between them Miss Billy Perry and Miss Missouri Martin
get Madame La Gimp dolled up in a lot of new clothes, and run her through one
of these beauty joints until she comes out very much changed, indeed.
Afterwards I hear Miss Billy Perry and Miss Missouri Martin have quite a few
words, because Miss Missouri Martin wishes to paint Madame La Gimp's hair the
same colour as her own, which is a high yellow, and buy her the same kind of
dresses which Miss Missouri Martin wears herself, and Miss Missouri Martin gets
much insulted when Miss Billy Perry says no, they are trying to dress Madame La
Gimp to look like a lady.</p>

<p>They tell me Miss Missouri Martin thinks some of putting the slug on Miss
Billy Perry for this crack, but happens to remember just in time that Miss
Billy Perry is now Dave the Dude's everloving wife, and that nobody in this
town can put the slug on Dave's ever-loving wife, except maybe Dave
himself.</p>

<p>Now the next thing anybody knows, Madame La Gimp is in a swell eight-or
nine-room apartment in the Marberry, and the way this comes about is as
follows: It seems that one of Dave the Dude's most important champagne
customers is a guy by the name of Rodney B. Emerson, who owns the apartment,
but who is at his summer home in Newport, with his family, or anyway with his
ever-loving wife.</p>

<p>This Rodney B. Emerson is quite a guy along Broadway, and a great hand for
spending dough and looking for laughs, and he is very popular with the mob.
Furthermore, he is obliged to Dave the Dude, because Dave sells him good
champagne when most guys are trying to hand him the old phonus bolonus, and
naturally Rodney B. Emerson appreciates this kind treatment.</p>

<p>He is a short, fat guy, with a round, red face, and a big laugh, and the
kind of a guy Dave the Dude can call up at his home in Newport and explain the
situation and ask for the loan of the apartment, which Dave does. Well, it
seems Rodney B. Emerson gets a big bang out of the idea, and he says to Dave
the Dude like this: 'You not only can have the apartment, Dave, but I will come
over and help you out. It will save a lot of explaining around the Marberry if
I am there.'</p>

<p>So he hops right over from Newport, and joins in with Dave the Dude, and I
wish to say Rodney B. Emerson will always be kindly remembered by one and all
for his co-operation, and nobody will ever again try to hand him the phonus
bolonus when he is buying champagne, even if he is not buying it off of Dave
the Dude.</p>

<p>Well, it is coming on Saturday and the boat from Spain is due, so Dave the
Dude hires a big town car, and puts his own driver, Wop Sam, on it, as he does
not wish any strange driver tipping off anybody that it is a hired car. Miss
Missouri Martin is anxious to go to the boat with Madame La Gimp, and take her
jazz band, the Hi Hi Boys, from her Sixteen Hundred Club with her to make it a
real welcome, but nobody thinks much of this idea. Only Madame La Gimp and her
husband Judge Henry G. Blake, and Miss Billy Perry go, though the judge holds
out for some time for Little Manuel, because Judge Blake says he wishes
somebody around to tip him off in case there are any bad cracks made about him
as a husband in Spanish, and Little Manuel is very Spanish.</p>

<p>The morning they go to meet the boat is the first time Judge Henry G. Blake
gets a load of his ever-loving wife, Madame La Gimp, and by this time Miss
Billy Perry and Miss Missouri Martin give Madame La Gimp such a going-over that
she is by no means the worst looker in the world. In fact, she looks
first-rate, especially as she is off gin and says she is off it for good.</p>

<p>Judge Henry G. Blake is really quite surprised by her looks, as he figures
all along she will turn out to be a crow. In fact, Judge Blake hurls a couple
of shots into himself to nerve himself for the ordeal, as he explains it,
before he appears to go to the boat. Between these shots, and the nice clothes,
and the good cleaning-up Miss Billy Perry and Miss Missouri Martin give Madame
La Gimp, she is really a pleasant sight to the judge.</p>

<p>They tell me the meeting at the dock between Madame La Gimp and her baby is
very affecting indeed, and when the proud old Spanish nobleman and his wife,
and their son, and Madame La Gimp's sister, all go into action, too, there are
enough tears around there to float all the battleships we once sink for Spain.
Even Miss Billy Perry and Judge Henry G. Blake do some first-class crying,
although the chances are the judge is worked up to the crying more by the shots
he takes for his courage than by the meeting.</p>

<p>Still, I hear the old judge does himself proud, what with kissing Madame La
Gimp's baby plenty, and duking the proud old Spanish nobleman, and his wife,
and son, and giving Madame La Gimp's sister a good strong hug that squeezes her
tongue out.</p>

<p>It turns out that the proud old Spanish nobleman has white sideburns, and is
entitled Conte de Something, so his ever-loving wife is the Contesa, and the
son is a very nice-looking quiet young guy any way you take him, who blushes
every time anybody looks at him. As for Madame La Gimp's baby, she is as pretty
as they come, and many guys are sorry they do not get Judge Henry G. Blake's
job as stepfather, because he is able to take a kiss at Madame La Gimp's baby
on what seems to be very small excuse. I never see a nicer-looking young
couple, and anybody can see they are very fond of each other, indeed.</p>

<p>Madame La Gimp's sister is not such a doll as I will wish to have sawed off
on me, and is up in the paints as regards to age, but she is also very quiet.
None of the bunch talk any English, so Miss Billy Perry and Judge Henry G.
Blake are pretty much outsiders on the way uptown. Anyway, the judge takes the
wind as soon as they reach the Marberry, because the judge is now getting a
little tired of being a husband. He says he has to take a trip out to
Pittsburgh to buy four or five coal-mines, but will be back the next day.</p>

<p>Well, it seems to me that everything is going perfect so far, and that it is
good judgment to let it lay as it is, but nothing will do Dave the Dude but to
have a reception the following night. I advise Dave the Dude against this idea,
because I am afraid something will happen to spoil the whole cat-hop, but he
will not listen to me, especially as Rodney B. Emerson is now in town and is a
strong booster for the party, as he wishes to drink some of the good champagne
he has planted in his apartment.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Miss Billy Perry and Miss Missouri Martin are very indignant at
me when they hear about my advice, as it seems they both buy new dresses out of
Dave the Dude's bank-roll when they are dressing up Madame La Gimp, and they
wish to spring these dresses somewhere where they can be seen. So the party is
on.</p>

<p>I get to the Marberry around nine o'clock and who opens the door of Madame
La Gimp's apartment for me but Moosh, the door man from Miss Missouri Martin's
Sixteen Hundred Club. Furthermore, he is in his Sixteen Hundred Club uniform,
except he has a clean shave. I wish Moosh a hello, and he never raps to me but
only bows, and takes my hat.</p>

<p>The next guy I see is Rodney B. Emerson in evening clothes, and the minute
he sees me he yells out, 'Mister O. O. McIntyre.' Well, of course, I am not
Mister O. O. McIntyre, and never put myself away as Mister O. O. McIntyre, and
furthermore there is no resemblance whatever between Mister O. O. McIntyre and
me, because I am a fairly good-looking guy, and I start to give Rodney B.
Emerson an argument, when he whispers to me like this:</p>

<p>'Listen,' he whispers, 'we must have big names at this affair, so as to
impress these people. The chances are they read the newspapers back there in
Spain, and we must let them meet the folks they read about, so they will see
Madame La Gimp is a real big shot to get such names to a party.'</p>

<p>Then he takes me by the arm and leads me to a group of people in a corner of
the room, which is about the size of the Grand Central waiting-room.</p>

<p>'Mister O. O. McIntyre, the big writer!' Rodney B. Emerson says, and the
next thing I know I am shaking hands with Mr. and Mrs. Conte, and their son,
and with Madame La Gimp and her baby, and Madame La Gimp's sister, and finally
with Judge Henry G. Blake, who has on a swallowtail coat, and does not give me
much of a tumble. I figure the chances are Judge Henry G. Blake is getting a
swelled head already, not to tumble up a guy who helps him get his job, but
even at that I wish to say the old judge looks immense in his swallowtail coat,
bowing and giving one and all the old castor-oil smile.</p>

<p>Madame La Gimp is in a low-neck black dress and is wearing a lot of Miss
Missouri Martin's diamonds, such as rings and bracelets, which Miss Missouri
Martin insists on hanging on her, although I hear afterwards that Miss
Missouri Martin has Johnny Brannigan, the plain-clothes copper, watching these
diamonds. I wonder at the time why Johnny is there, but figure it is because he
is a friend of Dave the Dude's. Miss Missouri Martin is no sucker, even if she
is kind-hearted.</p>

<p>Anybody looking at Madame La Gimp will bet you all the coffee in Java that
she never lives in a cellar over in Tenth Avenue, and drinks plenty of gin in
her day. She has her grey hair piled up high on her head, with a big Spanish
comb in it, and she reminds me of a picture I see somewhere, but I do not
remember just where. And her baby, Eulalie, in a white dress is about as pretty
a little doll as you will wish to see, and nobody can blame Judge Henry G.
Blake for copping a kiss off of her now and then.</p>

<p>Well, pretty soon I hear Rodney B. Emerson bawling, 'Mister Willie K.
Vanderbilt,' and in comes nobody but Big Nig, and Rodney B. Emerson leads him
over to the group and introduces him.</p>

<p>Little Manuel is standing alongside Judge Henry G. Blake, and he explains in
Spanish to Mr. and Mrs. Conte and the others that 'Willie K. Vanderbilt' is a
very large millionaire, and Mr. and Mrs. Conte seem much interested, anyway,
though naturally Madame La Gimp and Judge Henry G. Blake are jerry to Big Nig,
while Madame La Gimp's baby and the young guy are interested in nobody but each
other.</p>

<p>Then I hear, 'Mister Al Jolson,' and in comes nobody but Tony Bertazzola,
from the Chicken Club, who looks about as much like Al as I do like O. O.
McIntyre, which is not at all. Next comes 'the Very Reverend John Roach
Straton,' who seems to be Skeets Bolivar to me, then 'the Honourable Mayor
James J. Walker,' and who is it but Good Time Charley Bernstein.</p>

<p>'Mister Otto H. Kahn,' turns out to be Rochester Red, and 'Mister Heywood
Broun' is Nick the Greek, who asks me privately who Heywood Broun is, and gets
very sore at Rodney B. Emerson when I describe Heywood Broun to him.</p>

<p>Finally there is quite a commotion at the door and Rodney B. Emerson
announces, 'Mister Herbert Bayard Swope' in an extra loud voice which makes
everybody look around, but it is nobody but the Pale Face Kid. He gets me to
one side, too, and wishes to know who Herbert Bayard Swope is, and when I
explain to him, the Pale Face Kid gets so swelled up he will not speak to Death
House Donegan, who is only 'Mister William Muldoon.'</p>

<p>Well, it seems to me they are getting too strong when they announce,
'Vice-President of the United States, the Honourable Charles Curtis,' and in
pops Guinea Mike, and I say as much to Dave the Dude, who is running around
every which way looking after things, but he only says, 'Well, if you do not
know it is Guinea Mike, will you know it is not Vice-President Curtis?'</p>

<p>But it seems to me all this is most disrespectful to our leading citizens,
especially when Rodney B. Emerson calls, 'The Honourable Police Commissioner,
Mister Grover A. Whalen,' and in pops Wild William Wilkins, who is a very hot
man at this time, being wanted in several spots for different raps. Dave the
Dude takes personal charge of Wild William and removes a rod from his pants
pocket, because none of the guests are supposed to come rodded up, this being
strictly a social matter.</p>

<p>I watch Mr. and Mrs. Conte, and I do not see that these names are making any
impression on them, and I afterwards find out that they never get any
newspapers in their town in Spain except a little local bladder which only
prints the home news. In fact, Mr. and Mrs. Conte seem somewhat bored, although
Mr. Conte cheers up no little and looks interested when a lot of dolls drift
in. They are mainly dolls from Miss Missouri Martin's Sixteen Hundred Club, and
the Hot Box, but Rodney B. Emerson introduces them as 'Sophie Tucker,' and
'Theda Bara,' and 'Jeanne Eagels,' and 'Helen Morgan,' and 'Aunt Jemima,' and
one thing and another.</p>

<p>Well, pretty soon in comes Miss Missouri Martin's jazz band, the Hi Hi Boys,
and the party commences getting up steam, especially when Dave the Dude gets
Rodney B. Emerson to breaking out the old grape. By and by there is dancing
going on, and a good time is being had by one and all, including Mr. and Mrs.
Conte. In fact, after Mr. Conte gets a couple of jolts of the old grape, he
turns out to be a pretty nice old skate, even if nobody can understand what he
is talking about.</p>

<p>As for Judge Henry G. Blake, he is full of speed, indeed. By this time
anybody can see that the judge is commencing to believe that all this is on the
level and that he is really entertaining celebrities in his own home. You put a
quart of good grape inside the old judge and he will believe anything. He soon
dances himself plumb out of wind, and then I notice he is hanging around Madame
La Gimp a lot.</p>

<p>Along about midnight, Dave the Dude has to go out into the kitchen and
settle a battle there over a crap game, but otherwise everything is very
peaceful. It seems that 'Herbert Bayard Swope,' 'Vice-President Curtis,' and
'Grover Whalen' get a little game going, when 'the Reverend John Roach Straton'
steps up and cleans them in four passes, but it seems they soon discover that
'the Reverend John Roach Straton' is using tops on them, which are very
dishonest dice, and so they put the slug on 'the Reverend John Roach Straton'
and Dave the Dude has to split them out.</p>

<p>By and by I figure on taking the wind, and I look for Mr. and Mrs. Conte to
tell them good night, but Mr. Conte and Miss Missouri Martin are still dancing,
and Miss Missouri Martin is pouring conversation into Mr. Conte's ear by the
bucketful, and while Mr. Conte does not savvy a word she says, this makes no
difference to Miss Missouri Martin. Let Miss Missouri Martin do all the
talking, and she does not care a whoop if anybody understands her.</p>

<p>Mrs. Conte is over in a corner with 'Herbert Bayard Swope,' or the Pale Face
Kid, who is trying to find out from her by using hog Latin and signs on her if
there is any chance for a good twenty-one dealer in Spain, and of course Mrs.
Conte is not able to make heads or tails of what he means, so I hunt up Madame
La Gimp.</p>

<p>She is sitting in a darkish corner off by herself and I really do not see
Judge Henry G. Blake leaning over her until I am almost on top of them, so I
cannot help hearing what the judge is saying.</p>

<p>'I am wondering for two days,' he says, 'if by any chance you remember me.
Do you know who I am?'</p>

<p>'I remember you,' Madame La Gimp says. 'I remember you--oh, so very well,
Henry. How can I forget you? But I have no idea you recognize me after all
these years.'</p>

<p>'Twenty of them now,' Judge Henry G. Blake says. 'You are beautiful then.
You are still beautiful.'</p>

<p>Well, I can see the old grape is working first-class on Judge Henry G. Blake
to make such remarks as this, although at that, in the half-light, with the
smile on her face, Madame La Gimp is not so bad. Still, give me them carrying a
little less weight for age.</p>

<p>'Well, it is all your fault,' Judge Henry G. Blake says. 'You go and marry
that chile con carne guy, and look what happens!'</p>

<p>I can see there is no sense in me horning in on Madame La Gimp and Judge
Henry G. Blake while they are cutting up old touches in this manner, so I think
I will just say good-bye to the young people and let it go at that, but while I
am looking for Madame La Gimp's baby, and her guy, I run into Dave the
Dude.</p>

<p>'You will not find them here,' Dave says. 'By this time they are being
married over at Saint Malachy's with my ever-loving wife and Big Nig standing
up with them. We get the licence for them yesterday afternoon. Can you imagine
a couple of young saps wishing to wait until they go plumb around the world
before getting married?'</p>

<p>Well, of course, this elopement creates much excitement for a few minutes,
but by Monday Mr. and Mrs. Conde and the young folks and Madame La Gimp's
sister take a train for California to keep on going around the world, leaving
us nothing to talk about but about old Judge Henry G. Blake and Madame La Gimp
getting themselves married, too, and going to Detroit where Judge Henry G.
Blake claims he has a brother in the plumbing business who will give him a job,
although personally I think Judge Henry G. Blake figures to do a little booting
on his own hook in and out of Canada. It is not like Judge Henry G. Blake to
tie himself up to the plumbing business.</p>

<p>So there is nothing more to the story, except that Dave the Dude is around a
few days later with a big sheet of paper in his duke and very, very
indignant.</p>

<p>'If every single article listed here is not kicked back to the owners of the
different joints in the Marberry that they are taken from by next Tuesday
night, I will bust a lot of noses around this town,' Dave says. 'I am greatly
mortified by such happenings at my social affairs, and everything must be
returned at once. Especially,' Dave says, 'the baby grand piano that is removed
from Apartment 9D.'</p>

<h3><a name="Dancing_Dans_Christmas" id="Dancing_Dans_Christmas">Dancing Dan's Christmas</a></h3>
<p>Now one time it comes on Christmas, and in fact it is the evening before
Christmas, and I am in Good Time Charley Bernstein's little speakeasy in West
Forty-seventh Street, wishing Charley a Merry Christmas and having a few hot
Tom and Jerrys with him.</p>

<p>This hot Tom and Jerry is an old-time drink that is once used by one and all
in this country to celebrate Christmas with, and in fact it is once so popular
that many people think Christmas is invented only to furnish an excuse for hot
Tom and Jerry, although of course this is by no means true.</p>

<p>But anybody will tell you that there is nothing that brings out the true
holiday spirit like hot Tom and Jerry, and I hear that since Tom and Jerry goes
out of style in the United States, the holiday spirit is never quite the
same.</p>

<p>The reason hot Tom and Jerry goes out of style is because it is necessary to
use rum and one thing and another in making Tom and Jerry, and naturally when
rum becomes illegal in this country Tom and Jerry is also against the law,
because rum is something that is very hard to get around town these days.</p>

<p>For a while some people try making hot Tom and Jerry without putting rum in
it, but somehow it never has the same old holiday spirit, so nearly everybody
finally gives up in disgust, and this is not surprising, as making Tom and
Jerry is by no means child's play. In fact, it takes quite an expert to make
good Tom and Jerry, and in the days when it is not illegal a good hot Tom and
Jerry maker commands good wages and many friends.</p>

<p>Now of course Good Time Charley and I are not using rum in the Tom and Jerry
we are making, as we do not wish to do anything illegal. What we are using is
rye whisky that Good Time Charley gets on a doctor's prescription from a drug
store, as we are personally drinking this hot Tom and Jerry and naturally we
are not foolish enough to use any of Good Time Charley's own rye in it.</p>

<p>The prescription for the rye whisky comes from old Doc Moggs, who prescribes
it for Good Time Charley's rheumatism in case Charley happens to get any
rheumatism, as Doc Maggs says there is nothing better for rheumatism than rye
whisky, especially if it is made up in a hot Tom and Jerry. In fact, old Doc
Moggs comes around and has a few seidels of hot Tom and Jerry with us for his
own rheumatism.</p>

<p>He comes around during the afternoon, for Good Time Charley and I start
making this Tom and Jerry early in the day, so as to be sure to have enough to
last us over Christmas, and it is now along towards six o'clock, and our
holiday spirit is practically one hundred per cent.</p>

<p>Well, as Good Time Charley and I are expressing our holiday sentiments to
each other over our hot Tom and Jerry, and I am trying to think up the poem
about the night before Christmas and all through the house, which I know will
interest Charley no little, all of a sudden there is a big knock at the front
door, and when Charley opens the door who comes in carrying a large package
under one arm but a guy by the name of Dancing Dan.</p>

<p>This Dancing Dan is a good-looking young guy, who always seems well-dressed,
and he is called by the name of Dancing Dan because he is a great hand for
dancing around and about with dolls in night clubs, and other spots where there
is any dancing. In fact, Dan never seems to be doing anything else, although I
hear rumours that when he is not dancing he is carrying on in a most illegal
manner at one thing and another. But of course you can always hear rumours in
this town about anybody, and personally I am rather fond of Dancing Dan as he
always seems to be getting a great belt out of life.</p>

<p>Anybody in town will tell you that Dancing Dan is a guy with no Barnaby
whatever in him, and in fact he has about as much gizzard as anybody around,
although I wish to say I always question his judgment in dancing so much with
Miss Muriel O'Neill, who works in the Half Moon night club. And the reason I
question his judgment in this respect is because everybody knows that Miss
Muriel O'Neill is a doll who is very well thought of by Heine Schmitz, and
Heine Schmitz is not such a guy as will take kindly to anybody dancing more
than once and a half with a doll that he thinks well of.</p>

<p>This Heine Schmitz is a very influential citizen of Harlem, where he has
large interests in beer, and other business enterprises, and it is by no means
violating any confidence to tell you that Heine Schmitz will just as soon blow
your brains out as look at you. In fact, I hear sooner. Anyway, he is not a guy
to monkey with and many citizens take the trouble to advise Dancing Dan that he
is not only away out of line in dancing with Miss Muriel O'Neill, but that he
is knocking his own price down to where he is no price at all.</p>

<p>But Dancing Dan only laughs ha-ha, and goes on dancing with Miss Muriel
O'Neill any time he gets a chance, and Good Time Charley says he does not blame
him, at that, as Miss Muriel O'Neill is so beautiful that he will be dancing
with her himself no matter what, if he is five years younger and can get a
Roscoe out as fast as in the days when he runs with Paddy the Link and other
fast guys.</p>

<p>Well, anyway, as Dancing Dan comes in he weighs up the joint in one quick
peek, and then he tosses the package he is carrying into a corner where it goes
plunk, as if there is something very heavy in it, and then he steps up to the
bar alongside of Charley and me and wishes to know what we are drinking.</p>

<p>Naturally we start boosting hot Tom and Jerry to Dancing Dan, and he says he
will take a crack at it with us, and after one crack, Dancing Dan says he will
have another crack, and Merry Christmas to us with it, and the first thing
anybody knows it is a couple of hours later and we are still having cracks at
the hot Tom and Jerry with Dancing Dan, and Dan says he never drinks anything
so soothing in his life. In fact, Dancing Dan says he will recommend Tom and
Jerry to everybody he knows, only he does not know anybody good enough for Tom
and Jerry, except maybe Miss Muriel O'Neill, and she does not drink anything
with drugstore rye in it.</p>

<p>Well, several times while we are drinking this Tom and Jerry, customers come
to the door of Good Time Charley's little speakeasy and knock, but by now
Charley is commencing to be afraid they will wish Tom and Jerry, too, and he
does not feel we will have enough for ourselves, so he hangs out a sign which
says 'Closed on Account of Christmas,' and the only one he will let in is a guy
by the name of Ooky, who is nothing but an old rum-dum, and who is going around
all week dressed like Santa Claus and carrying a sign advertising Moe
Lewinsky's clothing joint around in Sixth Avenue.</p>

<p>This Ooky is still wearing his Santa Claus outfit when Charley lets him in,
and the reason Charley permits such a character as Ooky in his joint is because
Ooky does the porter work for Charley when he is not Santa Claus for Moe
Lewinsky, such as sweeping out, and washing the glasses, and one thing and
another.</p>

<p>Well, it is about nine-thirty when Ooky comes in, and his puppies are
aching, and he is all petered out generally from walking up and down and here
and there with his sign, for any time a guy is Santa Claus for Moe Lewinsky he
must earn his dough. In fact, Ooky is so fatigued, and his puppies hurt him so
much, that Dancing Dan and Good Time Charley and I all feel very sorry for him,
and invite him to have a few mugs of hot Tom and Jerry with us, and wish him
plenty of Merry Christmas.</p>

<p>But old Ooky is not accustomed to Tom and Jerry, and after about the fifth
mug he folds up in a chair, and goes right to sleep on us. He is wearing a
pretty good Santa Claus make-up, what with a nice red suit trimmed with white
cotton, and a wig, and false nose, and long white whiskers, and a big sack
stuffed with excelsior on his back, and if I do not know Santa Claus is not apt
to be such a guy as will snore loud enough to rattle the windows, I will think
Ooky is Santa Claus sure enough.</p>

<p>Well, we forget Ooky and let him sleep, and go on with our hot Tom and
Jerry, and in the meantime we try to think up a few songs appropriate to
Christmas, and Dancing Dan finally renders My Dad's Dinner Pail in a nice
baritone and very loud, while I do first-rate with Will You Love Me in December
As You Do in May? But personally I always think Good Time Charley Bernstein is
a little out of line trying to sing a hymn in Jewish on such an occasion, and
it causes words between us.</p>

<p>While we are singing many customers come to the door and knock, and then
they read Charley's sign, and this seems to cause some unrest among them, and
some of them stand outside saying it is a great outrage, until Charley sticks
his noggin out the door and threatens to bust somebody's beezer if they do not
go on about their business and stop disturbing peaceful citizens.</p>

<p>Naturally the customers go away, as they do not wish their beezers busted,
and Dancing Dan and Charley and I continue drinking our hot Tom and Jerry, and
with each Tom and Jerry we are wishing one another a very Merry Christmas, and
sometimes a very Happy New Year, although of course this does not go for Good
Time Charley as yet, because Charley has his New Year separate from Dancing Dan
and me.</p>

<p>By and by we take to waking Ooky up in his Santa Claus outfit and offering
him more hot Tom and Jerry, and wishing him Merry Christmas, but Ooky only gets
sore and calls us names, so we can see he does not have the right holiday
spirit in him, and let him alone until along about midnight when Dancing Dan
wishes to see how he looks as Santa Claus.</p>

<p>So Good Time Charley and I help Dancing Dan pull off Ooky's outfit and put
it on Dan, and this is easy as Ooky only has this Santa Claus outfit on over
his ordinary clothes, and he does not even wake up when we are undressing him
of the Santa Claus uniform.</p>

<p>Well, I wish to say I see many a Santa Claus in my time, but I never see a
better-looking Santa Claus than Dancing Dan, especially after he gets the wig
and white whiskers fixed just right, and we put a sofa pillow that Good Time
Charley happens to have around the joint for the cat to sleep on down his pants
to give Dancing Dan a nice fat stomach such as Santa Claus is bound to
have.</p>

<p>In fact, after Dancing Dan looks at himself in a mirror awhile he is greatly
pleased with his appearance, while Good Time Charley is practically hysterical,
although personally I am commencing to resent Charley's interest in Santa
Claus, and Christmas generally, as he by no means has any claim on these
matters. But then I remember Charley furnishes the hot Tom and Jerry, so I am
more tolerant towards him.</p>

<p>'Well,' Charley finally says, 'it is a great pity we do not know where there
are some stockings hung up somewhere, because then,' he says, 'you can go
around and stuff things in these stockings, as I always hear this is the main
idea of a Santa Claus. But,' Charley says, 'I do not suppose anybody in this
section has any stockings hung up, or if they have,' he says, 'the chances are
they are so full of holes they will not hold anything. Anyway,' Charley says,
'even if there are any stockings hung up we do not have anything to stuff in
them, although personally,' he says, 'I will gladly donate a few pints of
Scotch.'</p>

<p>Well, I am pointing out that we have no reindeer and that a Santa Claus is
bound to look like a terrible sap if he goes around without any reindeer, but
Charley's remarks seem to give Dancing Dan an idea, for all of a sudden he
speaks as follows:</p>

<p>'Why,' Dancing Dan says, 'I know where a stocking is hung up. It is hung up
at Miss Muriel O'Neill's flat over here in West Forty-ninth Street. This
stocking is hung up by nobody but a party by the name of Gammer O'Neill, who is
Miss Muriel O'Neill's grandmamma,' Dancing Dan says. 'Gammer O'Neill is going
on ninety-odd,' he says, 'and Miss Muriel O'Neill tells me she cannot hold out
much longer, what with one thing and another, including being a little childish
in spots.</p>

<p>'Now,' Dancing Dan says, 'I remember Miss Muriel O'Neill is telling me just
the other night how Gammer O'Neill hangs up her stocking on Christmas Eve all
her life, and,' he says, 'I judge from what Miss Muriel O'Neill says that the
old doll always believes Santa Claus will come along some Christmas and fill
the stocking full of beautiful gifts. But,' Dancing Dan says, 'Miss Muriel
O'Neill tells me Santa Claus never does this, although Miss Muriel O'Neill
personally always takes a few gifts home and pops them into the stocking to
make Gammer O'Neill feel better.</p>

<p>'But, of course,' Dancing Dan says, 'these gifts are nothing much because
Miss Muriel O'Neill is very poor, and proud, and also good, and will not take a
dime off of anybody, and I can lick the guy who says she will, although,'
Dancing Dan says, 'between me, and Heine Schmitz, and a raft of other guys I
can mention, Miss Muriel O'Neill can take plenty.'</p>

<p>Well, I know that what Dancing Dan states about Miss Muriel O'Neill is quite
true, and in fact it is a matter that is often discussed on Broadway, because
Miss Muriel O'Neill cannot get more than twenty bobs per week working in the
Half Moon, and it is well known to one and all that this is no kind of dough
for a doll as beautiful as Miss Muriel O'Neill.</p>

<p>'Now,' Dancing Dan goes on, 'it seems that while Gammer O'Neill is very
happy to get whatever she finds in her stocking on Christmas morning, she does
not understand why Santa Claus is not more liberal, and,' he says, 'Miss Muriel
O'Neill is saying to me that she only wishes she can give Gammer O'Neill one
real big Christmas before the old doll puts her checks back in the rack.</p>

<p>'So,' Dancing Dan states, 'here is a job for us. Miss Muriel O'Neill and her
grandmamma live all alone in this flat over in West Forty-ninth Street, and,'
he says, 'at such an hour as this Miss Muriel O'Neill is bound to be working,
and the chances are Gammer O'Neill is sound asleep, and we will just hop over
there and Santa Claus will fill up her stocking with beautiful gifts.'</p>

<p>Well, I say, I do not see where we are going to get any beautiful gifts at
this time of night, what with all the stores being closed, unless we dash into
an all-night drug store and buy a few bottles of perfume and a bum toilet set
as guys always do when they forget about their ever-loving wives until after
store hours on Christmas Eve, but Dancing Dan says never mind about this, but
let us have a few more Tom and Jerrys first.</p>

<p>So we have a few more Tom and Jerrys, and then Dancing Dan picks up the
package he heaves into the corner, and dumps most of the excelsior out of
Ooky's Santa Claus sack, and puts the bundle in, and Good Time Charley turns
out all the lights but one, and leaves a bottle of Scotch on the table in front
of Ooky for a Christmas gift, and away we go.</p>

<p>Personally, I regret very much leaving the hot Tom and Jerry, but then I am
also very enthusiastic about going along to help Dancing Dan play Santa Claus,
while Good Time Charley is practically overjoyed, as it is the first time in
his life Charley is ever mixed up in so much holiday spirit. In fact, nothing
will do Charley but that we stop in a couple of spots and have a few drinks to
Santa Claus's health, and these visits are a big success, although everybody is
much surprised to see Charley and me with Santa Claus, especially Charley,
although nobody recognizes Dancing Dan.</p>

<p>But of course there are no hot Tom and Jerrys in these spots we visit, and
we have to drink whatever is on hand, and personally I will always believe that
the noggin I have on me afterwards comes of mixing the drinks we get in these
spots with my Tom and Jerry.</p>

<p>As we go up Broadway, headed for Forty-ninth Street, Charley and I see many
citizens we know and give them a large hello, and wish them Merry Christmas,
and some of these citizens shake hands with Santa Claus, not knowing he is
nobody but Dancing Dan, although later I understand there is some gossip among
these citizens because they claim a Santa Claus with such a breath on him as
our Santa Claus has is a little out of line.</p>

<p>And once we are somewhat embarrassed when a lot of little kids going home
with their parents from a late Christmas party somewhere gather about Santa
Claus with shouts of childish glee, and some of them wish to climb up Santa
Claus's legs. Naturally, Santa Claus gets a little peevish, and calls them a
few names, and one of the parents comes up and wishes to know what is the idea
of Santa Claus using such language, and Santa Claus takes a punch at the
parent, all of which is no doubt most astonishing to the little kids who have
an idea of Santa Claus as a very kindly old guy. But of course they do not know
about Dancing Dan mixing the liquor we get in the spots we visit with his Tom
and Jerry, or they will understand how even Santa Claus can lose his
temper.</p>

<p>Well, finally we arrive in front of the place where Dancing Dan says Miss
Muriel O'Neill and her grandmamma live, and it is nothing but a tenement house
not far back of Madison Square Garden, and furthermore it is a walk-up, and at
this time there are no lights burning in the joint except a gas jet in the main
hall, and by the light of this jet we look at the names on the letter-boxes,
such as you always find in the hall of these joints, and we see that Miss
Muriel O'Neill and her grandmamma live on the fifth floor.</p>

<p>This is the top floor, and personally I do not like the idea of walking up
five flights of stairs, and I am willing to let Dancing Dan and Good Time
Charley go, but Dancing Dan insists we must all go, and finally I agree because
Charley is commencing to argue that the right way for us to do is to get on the
roof and let Santa Claus go down a chimney, and is making so much noise I am
afraid he will wake somebody up.</p>

<p>So up the stairs we climb and finally we come to a door on the top floor
that has a little card in a slot that says O'Neill, so we know we reach our
destination. Dancing Dan first tries the knob, and right away the door opens,
and we are in a little two- or three-room flat, with not much furniture in it,
and what furniture there is is very poor. One single gas jet is burning near a
bed in a room just off the one the door opens into, and by this light we see a
very old doll is sleeping on the bed, so we judge this is nobody but Gammer
O'Neill.</p>

<p>On her face is a large smile, as if she is dreaming of something very
pleasant. On a chair at the head of the bed is hung a long black stocking, and
it seems to be such a stocking as is often patched and mended, so I can see
what Miss Muriel O'Neill tells Dancing Dan about her grandmamma hanging up her
stocking is really true, although up to this time I have my doubts.</p>

<p>Well, I am willing to pack in after one gander at the old doll, especially
as Good Time Charley is commencing to prowl around the flat to see if there is
a chimney where Santa Claus can come down, and is knocking things over, but
Dancing Dan stands looking down at Gammer O'Neill for a long time.</p>

<p>Finally he unslings the sack on his back, and takes out his package, and
unties this package, and all of a sudden out pops a raft of big diamond
bracelets, and diamond rings, and diamond brooches, and diamond necklaces, and
I do not know what all else in the way of diamonds, and Dancing Dan and I begin
stuffing these diamonds into the stocking and Good Time Charley pitches in and
helps us.</p>

<p>There are enough diamonds to fill the stocking to the muzzle, and it is no
small stocking, at that, and I judge that Gammer O'Neill has a pretty fair set
of bunting sticks when she is young. In fact, there are so many diamonds that
we have enough left over to make a nice little pile on the chair after we fill
the stocking plumb up, leaving a nice diamond-studded vanity case sticking out
the top where we figure it will hit Gammer O'Neill's eye when she wakes up.</p>

<p>And it is not until I get out in the fresh air again that all of a sudden I
remember seeing large headlines in the afternoon papers about a
five-hundred-G's stick-up in the afternoon of one of the biggest diamond
merchants in Maiden Lane while he is sitting in his office, and I also recall
once hearing rumours that Dancing Dan is one of the best lone-hand git-'em-up
guys in the world.</p>

<p>Naturally I commence to wonder if I am in the proper company when I am with
Dancing Dan, even if he is Santa Claus. So I leave him on the next corner
arguing with Good Time Charley about whether they ought to go and find some
more presents somewhere, and look for other stockings to stuff, and I hasten on
home, and go to bed.</p>

<p>The next day I find I have such a noggin that I do not care to stir around,
and in fact I do not stir around much for a couple of weeks.</p>

<p>Then one night I drop around to Good Time Charley's little speakeasy, and
ask Charley what is doing. 'Well,' Charley says, 'many things are doing, and
personally,' he says, 'I am greatly surprised I do not see you at Gammer
O'Neill's wake. You know Gammer O'Neill leaves this wicked old world a couple
of days after Christmas,' Good Time Charley says, 'and,' he says, 'Miss Muriel
O'Neill states that Doc Moggs claims it is at least a day after she is entitled
to go, but she is sustained,' Charley says, 'by great happiness on finding her
stocking filled with beautiful gifts on Christmas morning.</p>

<p>'According to Miss Muriel O'Neill,' Charley says, 'Gammer O'Neill dies
practically convinced that there is a Santa Claus, although of course,' he
says, 'Miss Muriel O'Neill does not tell her the real owner of the gifts, an
all-right guy by the name of Shapiro, leaves the gifts with her after Miss
Muriel O'Neill notifies him of the finding of same.</p>

<p>'It seems,' Charley says, 'this Shapiro is a tender-hearted guy, who is
willing to help keep Gammer O'Neill with us a little longer when Doc Moggs says
leaving the gifts with her will do it.</p>

<p>'So,' Charley says, 'everything is quite all right, as the coppers cannot
figure anything except that maybe the rascal who takes the gifts from Shapiro
gets conscience stricken, and leaves them the first place he can, and Miss
Muriel O'Neill receives a ten-G's reward for finding the gifts and returning
them. And,' Charley says, 'I hear Dancing Dan is in San Francisco and is
figuring on reforming and becoming a dancing teacher, so he can marry Miss
Muriel O'Neill, and of course,' he says, 'we all hope and trust she never
learns any details of Dancing Dan's career.'</p>

<p>Well, it is Christmas Eve a year later that I run into a guy by the name of
Shotgun Sam, who is mobbed up with Heine Schmitz in Harlem, and who is a very,
very obnoxious character indeed.</p>

<p>'Well, well, well,' Shotgun says, 'the last time I see you is another
Christmas Eve like this, and you are coming out of Good Time Charley's joint,
and,' he says, 'you certainly have your pots on.'</p>

<p>'Well, Shotgun,' I say, 'I am sorry you get such a wrong impression of me,
but the truth is,' I say, 'on the occasion you speak of, I am suffering from a
dizzy feeling in my head.'</p>

<p>'It is all right with me,' Shotgun says. 'I have a tip this guy Dancing Dan
is in Good Time Charley's the night I see you, and Mockie Morgan and Gunner
Jack and me are casing the joint, because,' he says, 'Heine Schmitz is all
sored up at Dan over some doll, although of course,' Shotgun says, 'it is all
right now, as Heine has another doll.</p>

<p>'Anyway,' he says, 'we never get to see Dancing Dan. We watch the joint from
six-thirty in the evening until daylight Christmas morning, and nobody goes in
all night but old Ooky the Santa Claus guy in his Santa Claus make-up, and,'
Shotgun says, 'nobody comes out except you and Good Time Charley and Ooky.</p>

<p>'Well,' Shotgun says, 'it is a great break for Dancing Dan he never goes in
or comes out of Good Time Charley's, at that, because,' he says, 'we are
waiting for him on the second-floor front of the building across the way with
some nice little sawed-offs, and are under orders from Heine not to miss.'</p>

<p>'Well, Shotgun,' I say, 'Merry Christmas.'</p>

<p>'Well, all right,' Shotgun says, 'Merry Christmas.'</p>

<h3><a name="Sense_of_Humour" id="Sense_of_Humour">Sense of Humour</a></h3>
<p>One night I am standing in front of Mindy's restaurant on Broadway, thinking
of practically nothing whatever, when all of a sudden I feel a very terrible
pain in my left foot. In fact, this pain is so very terrible that it causes me
to leap up and down like a bullfrog, and to let out loud cries of agony, and to
speak some very profane language, which is by no means my custom, although of
course I recognize the pain as coming from a hot foot, because I often
experience this pain before.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I know Joe the Joker must be in the neighbourhood, as Joe the
Joker has the most wonderful sense of humour of anybody in this town, and is
always around giving people the hot foot, and gives it to me more times than I
can remember. In fact, I hear Joe the Joker invents the hot foot, and it
finally becomes a very popular idea all over the country.</p>

<p>The way you give a hot foot is to sneak up behind some guy who is standing
around thinking of not much, and stick a paper match in his shoe between the
sole and the upper along about where his little toe ought to be, and then light
the match. By and by the guy will feel a terrible pain in his foot, and will
start stamping around, and hollering, and carrying on generally, and it is
always a most comical sight and a wonderful laugh to one and all to see him
suffer.</p>

<p>No one in the world can give a hot foot as good as Joe the Joker, because it
takes a guy who can sneak up very quiet on the guy who is to get the hot foot,
and Joe can sneak up so quiet many guys on Broadway are willing to lay you odds
that he can give a mouse a hot foot if you can find a mouse that wears shoes.
Furthermore, Joe the Joker can take plenty of care of himself in case the guy
who gets the hot foot feels like taking the matter up, which sometimes happens,
especially with guys who get their shoes made to order at forty bobs per copy
and do not care to have holes burned in these shoes.</p>

<p>But Joe does not care what kind of shoes the guys are wearing when he feels
like giving out hot foots, and furthermore, he does not care who the guys are,
although many citizens think he makes a mistake the time he gives a hot foot to
Frankie Ferocious. In fact, many citizens are greatly horrified by this action,
and go around saying no good will come of it.</p>

<p>This Frankie Ferocious comes from over in Brooklyn, where he is considered a
rising citizen in many respects, and by no means a guy to give hot foots to,
especially as Frankie Ferocious has no sense of humour whatever. In fact, he is
always very solemn, and nobody ever sees him laugh, and he certainly does not
laugh when Joe the Joker gives him a hot foot one day on Broadway when Frankie
Ferocious is standing talking over a business matter with some guys from the
Bronx.</p>

<p>He only scowls at Joe, and says something in Italian, and while I do not
understand Italian, it sounds so unpleasant that I guarantee I will leave town
inside of the next two hours if he says it to me.</p>

<p>Of course Frankie Ferocious's name is not really Ferocious, but something in
Italian like Feroccio, and I hear he originally comes from Sicily, although he
lives in Brooklyn for quite some years, and from a modest beginning he builds
himself up until he is a very large operator in merchandise of one kind and
another, especially alcohol. He is a big guy of maybe thirty-odd, and he has
hair blacker than a yard up a chimney, and black eyes, and black eyebrows, and
a slow way of looking at people.</p>

<p>Nobody knows a whole lot about Frankie Ferocious, because he never has much
to say, and he takes his time saying it, but everybody gives him plenty of room
when he comes around, as there are rumours that Frankie never likes to be
crowded. As far as I am concerned, I do not care for any part of Frankie
Ferocious, because his slow way of looking at people always makes me nervous,
and I am always sorry Joe the Joker gives him a hot foot, because I figure
Frankie Ferocious is bound to consider it a most disrespectful action, and hold
it against everybody that lives on the Island of Manhattan.</p>

<p>But Joe the Joker only laughs when anybody tells him he is out of line in
giving Frankie the hot foot, and says it is not his fault if Frankie has no
sense of humour. Furthermore, Joe says he will not only give Frankie another
hot foot if he gets a chance, but that he will give hot foots to the Prince of
Wales or Mussolini, if he catches them in the right spot, although Regret, the
horse player, states that Joe can have twenty to one any time that he will not
give Mussolini any hot foots and get away with it.</p>

<p>Anyway, just as I suspect, there is Joe the Joker watching me when I feel
the hot foot, and he is laughing very heartily, and furthermore, a large number
of other citizens are also laughing heartily, because Joe the Joker never sees
any fun in giving people the hot foot unless others are present to enjoy the
joke.</p>

<p>Well, naturally when I see who it is gives me the hot foot I join in the
laughter, and go over and shake hands with Joe, and when I shake hands with him
there is more laughter, because it seems Joe has a hunk of Limburger cheese in
his duke, and what I shake hands with is this Limburger. Furthermore, it is
some of Mindy's Limburger cheese, and everybody knows Mindy's Limburger is very
squashy, and also very loud.</p>

<p>Of course I laugh at this, too, although to tell the truth I will laugh much
more heartily if Joe the Joker drops dead in front of me, because I do not like
to be made the subject of laughter on Broadway. But my laugh is really quite
hearty when Joe takes the rest of the cheese that is not on my fingers and
smears it on the steering-wheels of some automobiles parked in front of
Mindy's, because I get to thinking of what the drivers will say when they start
steering their cars.</p>

<p>Then I get talking to Joe the Joker, and I ask him how things are up in
Harlem, where Joe and his younger brother, Freddy, and several other guys have
a small organization operating in beer, and Joe says things are as good as can
be expected considering business conditions. Then I ask him how Rosa is getting
along, this Rosa being Joe the Joker's ever-loving wife, and a personal friend
of mine, as I know her when she is Rosa Midnight and is singing in the old Hot
Box before Joe hauls off and marries her.</p>

<p>Well, at this question Joe the Joker starts laughing, and I can see that
something appeals to his sense of humour, and finally he speaks as follows:</p>

<p>'Why,' he says, 'do you not hear the news about Rosa? She takes the wind on
me a couple of months ago for my friend Frankie Ferocious, and is living in an
apartment over in Brooklyn, right near his house, although,' Joe says, 'of
course you understand I am telling you this only to answer your question, and
not to holler copper on Rosa.'</p>

<p>Then he lets out another large ha-ha, and in fact Joe the Joker keeps
laughing until I am afraid he will injure himself internally. Personally, I do
not see anything comical in a guy's ever-loving wife taking the wind on him for
a guy like Frankie Ferocious, so when Joe the Joker quiets down a bit I ask him
what is funny about the proposition.</p>

<p>'Why,' Joe says, 'I have to laugh every time I think of how the big
greaseball is going to feel when he finds out how expensive Rosa is. I do not
know how many things Frankie Ferocious has running for him in Brooklyn,' Joe
says, 'but he better try to move himself in on the mint if he wishes to keep
Rosa going.'</p>

<p>Then he laughs again, and I consider it wonderful the way Joe is able to
keep his sense of humour even in such a situation as this, although up to this
time I always think Joe is very daffy indeed about Rosa, who is a little doll,
weighing maybe ninety pounds with her hat on and quite cute.</p>

<p>Now I judge from what Joe the Joker tells me that Frankie Ferocious knows
Rosa before Joe marries her and is always pitching to her when she is singing
in the Hot Box, and even after she is Joe's ever-loving wife, Frankie
occasionally calls her up, especially when he commences to be a rising citizen
of Brooklyn, although of course Joe does not learn about these calls until
later. And about the time Frankie Ferocious commences to be a rising citizen of
Brooklyn, things begin breaking a little tough for Joe the Joker, what with the
depression and all, and he has to economise on Rosa in spots, and if there is
one thing Rosa cannot stand it is being economised on.</p>

<p>Along about now, Joe the Joker gives Frankie Ferocious the hot foot, and
just as many citizens state at the time, it is a mistake, for Frankie starts
calling Rosa up more than somewhat, and speaking of what a nice place Brooklyn
is to live in--which it is, at that and between these boosts for Brooklyn and
Joe the Joker's economy, Rosa hauls off and takes a subway to Borough Hall,
leaving Joe a note telling him that if he does not like it he knows what he can
do.</p>

<p>'Well, Joe,' I say, after listening to his story, 'I always hate to hear of
these little domestic difficulties among my friends, but maybe this is all for
the best. Still, I feel sorry for you, if it will do you any good,' I say.</p>

<p>'Do not feel sorry for me,' Joe says. 'If you wish to feel sorry for
anybody, feel sorry for Frankie Ferocious, and,' he says, 'if you can spare a
little more sorrow, give it to Rosa.'</p>

<p>And Joe the Joker laughs very hearty again and starts telling me about a
little scatter that he has up in Harlem where he keeps a chair fixed up with
electric wires so he can give anybody that sits down in it a nice jolt, which
sounds very humorous to me, at that, especially when Joe tells me how they turn
on too much juice one night and almost kill Commodore Jake.</p>

<p>Finally Joe says he has to get back to Harlem, but first he goes to the
telephone in the corner cigar store and calls up Mindy's and imitates a doll's
voice, and tells Mindy he is Peggy Joyce, or somebody, and orders fifty dozen
sandwiches sent up at once to an apartment in West Seventy-second Street for a
birthday party, although of course there is no such number as he gives, and
nobody there will wish fifty dozen sandwiches if there is such a number.</p>

<p>Then Joe gets in his car and starts off, and while he is waiting for the
traffic lights at Fiftieth Street, I see citizens on the sidewalks making
sudden leaps, and looking around very fierce, and I know Joe the Joker is
plugging them with pellets made out of tin foil, which he fires from a rubber
band hooked between his thumb and forefinger.</p>

<p>Joe the Joker is very expert with this proposition, and it is very funny to
see the citizens jump, although once or twice in his life Joe makes a miscue
and knocks out somebody's eye. But it is all in fun, and shows you what a
wonderful sense of humour Joe has.</p>

<p>Well, a few days later I see by the papers where a couple of Harlem guys Joe
the Joker is mobbed up with are found done up in sacks over in Brooklyn, very
dead indeed, and the coppers say it is because they are trying to move in on
certain business enterprises that belong to nobody but Frankie Ferocious. But
of course the coppers do not say Frankie Ferocious puts these guys in the
sacks, because in the first place Frankie will report them to Headquarters if
the coppers say such a thing about him, and in the second place putting guys in
sacks is strictly a St. Louis idea and to have a guy put in a sack properly you
have to send to St. Louis for experts in this matter.</p>

<p>Now, putting a guy in a sack is not as easy as it sounds, and in fact it
takes quite a lot of practice and experience. To put a guy in a sack properly,
you first have to put him to sleep, because naturally no guy is going to walk
into a sack wide awake unless he is a plumb sucker. Some people claim the best
way to put a guy to sleep is to give him a sleeping powder of some kind in a
drink, but the real experts just tap the guy on the noggin with a blackjack,
which saves the expense of buying the drink.</p>

<p>Anyway, after the guy is asleep, you double him up like a pocket-knife, and
tie a cord or a wire around his neck and under his knees. Then you put him in a
gunny sack, and leave him some place, and by and by when the guy wakes up and
finds himself in the sack, naturally he wants to get out and the first thing he
does is to try to straighten out his knees. This pulls the cord around his neck
up so tight that after a while the guy is all out of breath.</p>

<p>So then when somebody comes along and opens the sack they find the guy dead,
and nobody is responsible for this unfortunate situation, because after all the
guy really commits suicide, because if he does not try to straighten out his
knees he may live to a ripe old age, if he recovers from the tap on the
noggin.</p>

<p>Well, a couple of days later I see by the papers where three Brooklyn
citizens are scragged as they are walking peaceably along Clinton Street, the
scragging being done by some parties in an automobile who seem to have a
machine gun, and the papers state that the citizens are friends of Frankie
Ferocious, and that it is rumoured the parties with the machine gun are from
Harlem.</p>

<p>I judge by this that there is some trouble in Brooklyn, especially as about
a week after the citizens are scragged in Clinton Street, another Harlem guy is
found done up in a sack like a Virginia ham near Prospect Park, and now who is
it but Joe the Joker's brother, Freddy, and I know Joe is going to be greatly
displeased by this.</p>

<p>By and by it gets so nobody in Brooklyn will open as much as a sack of
potatoes without first calling in the gendarmes, for fear a pair of No.8 shoes
will jump out at them.</p>

<p>Now one night I see Joe the Joker, and this time he is all alone, and I wish
to say I am willing to leave him all alone, because something tells me he is
hotter than a stove. But he grabs me as I am going past, so naturally I stop to
talk to him, and the first thing I say is how sorry I am about his brother.</p>

<p>'Well,' Joe the Joker says, 'Freddy is always a kind of a sap. Rosa calls
him up and asks him to come over to Brooklyn to see her. She wishes to talk to
Freddy about getting me to give her a divorce,' Joe says, 'so she can marry
Frankie Ferocious, I suppose. Anyway,' he says, 'Freddy tells Commodore Jake
why he is going to see her. Freddy always likes Rosa, and thinks maybe he can
patch it up between us. So,' Joe says, 'he winds up in a sack. They get him
after he leaves her apartment. I do not claim Rosa will ask him to come over if
she has any idea he will be sacked,' Joe says, 'but,' he says, 'she is
responsible. She is a bad-luck doll.'</p>

<p>Then he starts to laugh, and at first I am greatly horrified, thinking it is
because something about Freddy being sacked strikes his sense of humour, when
he says to me, like this:</p>

<p>'Say,' he says, 'I am going to play a wonderful joke on Frankie
Ferocious.'</p>

<p>'Well, Joe,' I say, 'you are not asking me for advice, but I am going to
give you some free, gratis, and for nothing. Do not play any jokes on Frankie
Ferocious, as I hear he has no more sense of humour than a nanny goat. I hear
Frankie Ferocious will not laugh if you have Al Jolson, Eddie Cantor, Ed Wynn
and Joe Cook telling him jokes all at once. In fact,' I say, 'I hear he is a
tough audience.'</p>

<p>'Oh,' Joe the Joker says, 'he must have some sense of humour somewhere to
stand for Rosa. I hear he is daffy about her. In fact, I understand she is the
only person in the world he really likes, and trusts. But I must play a joke on
him. I am going to have myself delivered to Frankie Ferocious in a sack.'</p>

<p>Well, of course I have to laugh at this myself, and Joe the Joker laughs
with me. Personally, I am laughing just at the idea of anybody having
themselves delivered to Frankie Ferocious in a sack, and especially Joe the
Joker, but of course I have no idea Joe really means what he says.</p>

<p>'Listen,' Joe says, finally. 'A guy from St. Louis who is a friend of mine
is doing most of the sacking for Frankie Ferocious. His name is Ropes
McGonnigle. In fact,' Joe says, 'he is a very dear old pal of mine, and he has
a wonderful sense of humour like me. Ropes McGonnigle has nothing whatever to
do with sacking Freddy,' Joe says, 'and he is very indignant about it since he
finds out Freddy is my brother, so he is anxious to help me play a joke on
Frankie.</p>

<p>'Only last night,' Joe says, 'Frankie Ferocious sends for Ropes and tells
him he will appreciate it as a special favour if Ropes will bring me to him in
a sack. I suppose,' Joe says, 'that Frankie Ferocious hears from Rosa what
Freddy is bound to tell her about my ideas on divorce. I have very strict ideas
on divorce,' Joe says, 'especially where Rosa is concerned. I will see her in
what's-this before I ever do her and Frankie Ferocious such a favour as giving
her a divorce.</p>

<p>'Anyway,' Joe the Joker says, 'Ropes tells me about Frankie Ferocious
propositioning him, so I send Ropes back to Frankie Ferocious to tell him he
knows I am to be in Brooklyn to-morrow night, and furthermore, Ropes tells
Frankie that he will have me in a sack in no time. And so he will,' Joe
says.</p>

<p>'Well,' I say, 'personally, I see no percentage in being delivered to
Frankie Ferocious in a sack, because as near as I can make out from what I read
in the papers, there is no future for a guy in a sack that goes to Frankie
Ferocious. What I cannot figure out,' I say, 'is where the joke on Frankie
comes in.'</p>

<p>'Why,' Joe the Joker says, 'the joke is, I will not be asleep in the sack,
and my hands will not be tied, and in each of my hands I will have a John
Roscoe, so when the sack is delivered to Frankie Ferocious and I pop out
blasting away, can you not imagine his astonishment?'</p>

<p>Well, I can imagine this, all right. In fact when I get to thinking of the
look of surprise that is bound to come to Frankie Ferocious's face when Joe the
Joker comes out of the sack I have to laugh, and Joe the Joker laughs right
along with me.</p>

<p>'Of course,' Joe says, 'Ropes McGonnigle will be there to start blasting
with me, in case Frankie Ferocious happens to have any company.'</p>

<p>Then Joe the Joker goes on up the street, leaving me still laughing, from
thinking of how amazed Frankie Ferocious will be when Joe bounces out of the
sack and starts throwing slugs around and about. I do not hear of Joe from that
time to this, but I hear the rest of the story from very reliable parties.</p>

<p>It seems that Ropes McGonnigle does not deliver the sack himself, after all,
but sends it by an expressman to Frankie Ferocious's home. Frankie Ferocious
receives many sacks such as this in his time, because it seems that it is a
sort of passion with him to personally view the contents of the sacks and check
up on them before they are distributed about the city, and of course Ropes
McGonnigle knows about this passion from doing so much sacking for Frankie.</p>

<p>When the expressman takes the sack into Frankie's house, Frankie personally
lugs it down into his basement, and there he outs with a big John Roscoe and
fires six shots into the sack, because it seems Ropes McGonnigle tips him off
to Joe the Joker's plan to pop out of the sack and start blasting.</p>

<p>I hear Frankie Ferocious has a very strange expression on his pan and is
laughing the only laugh anybody ever hears from him when the gendarmes break in
and put the arm on him for murder, because it seems that when Ropes McGonnigle
tells Frankie of Joe the Joker's plan, Frankie tells Ropes what he is going to
do with his own hands before opening the sack. Naturally, Ropes speaks to Joe
the Joker of Frankie's idea about filling the sack full of slugs, and Joe's
sense of humour comes right out again.</p>

<p>So, bound and gagged, but otherwise as right as rain in the sack that is
delivered to Frankie Ferocious, is by no means Joe the Joker, but Rosa.</p>

<h3><a name="Lillian" id="Lillian">Lillian</a></h3>
<p>What I always say is that Wilbur Willard is nothing but a very lucky guy,
because what is it but luck that has been teetering along Forty-ninth Street
one cold snowy morning when Lillian is merowing around the sidewalk looking for
her mamma?</p>

<p>And what is it but luck that has Wilbur Willard all mulled up to a million,
what with him having been sitting out a few seidels of Scotch with a friend by
the name of Haggerty in an apartment over in Fifty-ninth Street? Because if
Wilbur Willard is not mulled up he will see Lillian as nothing but a little
black cat, and give her plenty of room, for everybody knows that black cats are
terribly bad luck, even when they are only kittens.</p>

<p>But being mulled up like I tell you, things look very different to Wilbur
Willard, and he does not see Lillian as a little black kitten scrabbling around
in the snow. He sees a beautiful leopard, because a copper by the name of
O'Hara, who is walking past about then, and who knows Wilbur Willard, hears him
say:</p>

<p>'Oh, you beautiful leopard!'</p>

<p>The copper takes a quick peek himself, because he does not wish any leopards
running around his beat, it being against the law, but all he sees, as he tells
me afterwards, is this rumpot ham, Wilbur Willard, picking up a scrawny little
black kitten and shoving it in his overcoat pocket, and he also hears Wilbur
say:</p>

<p>'Your name is Lillian.'</p>

<p>Then Wilbur teeters on up to his room on the top floor of an old fleabag in
Eighth Avenue that is called the Hotel de Brussels, where he lives quite a
while, because the management does not mind actors, the management of the Hotel
de Brussels being very broad-minded, indeed.</p>

<p>There is some complaint this same morning from one of Wilbur's neighbours,
an old burlesque doll by the name of Minnie Madigan, who is not working since
Abraham Lincoln is assassinated, because she hears Wilbur going on in his room
about a beautiful leopard, and calls up the clerk to say that an hotel which
allows wild animals is not respectable. But the clerk looks in on Wilbur and
finds him playing with nothing but a harmless-looking little black kitten, and
nothing comes of the old doll's beef, especially as nobody ever claims the
Hotel de Brussels is respectable anyway, or at least not much.</p>

<p>Of course when Wilbur comes out from under the ether next afternoon he can
see Lillian is not a leopard, and in fact Wilbur is quite astonished to find
himself in bed with a little black kitten, because it seems Lillian is sleeping
on Wilbur's chest to keep warm. At first Wilbur does not believe what he sees,
and puts it down to Haggerty's Scotch, but finally he is convinced, and so he
puts Lillian in his pocket, and takes her over to the Hot Box night club and
gives her some milk, of which it seems Lillian is very fond.</p>

<p>Now where Lillian comes from in the first place of course nobody knows. The
chances are somebody chucks her out of a window into the snow, because people
are always chucking kittens, and one thing and another, out of windows in New
York. In fact, if there is one thing this town has plenty of, it is kittens,
which finally grow up to be cats, and go snooping around ash cans, and merowing
on roofs, and keeping people from sleeping good.</p>

<p>Personally, I have no use for cats, including kittens, because I never see
one that has any too much sense, although I know a guy by the name of Pussy
McGuire who makes a first-rate living doing nothing but stealing cats, and
sometimes dogs, and selling them to old dolls who like such things for company.
But Pussy only steals Persian and Angora cats, which are very fine cats, and of
course Lillian is no such cat as this. Lillian is nothing but a black cat, and
nobody will give you a dime a dozen for black cats in this town, as they are
generally regarded as very bad jinxes.</p>

<p>Furthermore, it comes out in a few weeks that Wilbur Willard can just as
well name her Herman, or Sidney, as not, but Wilbur sticks to Lillian, because
this is the name of his partner when he is in vaudeville years ago. He often
tells me about Lillian Withington when he is mulled up, which is more often
than somewhat, for Wilbur is a great hand for drinking Scotch, or rye, or
bourbon, or gin, or whatever else there is around for drinking, except water.
In fact, Wilbur Willard is a high-class drinking man, and it does no good to
tell him it is against the law to drink in this country, because it only makes
him mad, and he says to the dickens with the law, only Wilbur Willard uses a
much rougher word than dickens.</p>

<p>'She is like a beautiful leopard,' Wilbur says to me about Lillian
Withington. 'Black-haired, and black-eyed, and all ripply, like a leopard I see
in an animal act on the same bill at the Palace with us once. We are headliners
then,' he says, 'Willard and Withington, the best singing and dancing act in
the country.</p>

<p>'I pick her up in San Antonia, which is a spot in Texas,' Wilbur says. 'She
is not long out of a convent, and I just lose my old partner, Mary McGee, who
ups and dies on me of pneumonia down there. Lillian wishes to go on the stage,
and joins out with me. A natural-born actress with a great voice. But like a
leopard,' Wilbur says. 'Like a leopard. There is cat in her, no doubt of this,
and cats and women are both ungrateful. I love Lillian Withington. I wish to
marry her. But she is cold to me. She says she is not going to follow the stage
all her life. She says she wishes money, and luxury, and a fine home and of
course a guy like me cannot give a doll such things.</p>

<p>'I wait on her hand and foot,' Wilbur says. 'I am her slave. There is
nothing I will not do for her. Then one day she walks in on me in Boston very
cool and says she is quitting me. She says she is marrying a rich guy there.
Well, naturally it busts up the act and I never have the heart to look for
another partner, and then I get to belting that old black bottle around, and
now what am I but a cabaret performer?'</p>

<p>Then sometimes he will bust out crying, and sometimes I will cry with him,
although the way I look at it, Wilbur gets a pretty fair break, at that, in
getting rid of a doll who wishes things he cannot give her. Many a guy in this
town is tangled up with a doll who wishes things he cannot give her, but who
keeps him tangled up just the same and busting himself trying to keep her
quiet.</p>

<p>Wilbur makes pretty fair money as an entertainer in the Hot Box, though he
spends most of it for Scotch, and he is not a bad entertainer, either. I often
go to the Hot Box when I am feeling blue to hear him sing Melancholy Baby, and
Moonshine Valley and other sad songs which break my heart. Personally, I do not
see why any doll cannot love Wilbur, especially if they listen to him sing such
songs as Melancholy Baby when he is mulled up good, because he is a tall,
nice-looking guy with long eyelashes, and sleepy brown eyes, and his voice has
a low moaning sound that usually goes very big with the dolls. In fact, many a
doll does do some pitching to Wilbur when he is singing in the Hot Box, but
somehow Wilbur never gives them a tumble, which I suppose is because he is
thinking only of Lillian Withington.</p>

<p>Well, after he gets Lillian, the black kitten, Wilbur seems to find a new
interest in life, and Lillian turns out to be right cute, and not bad-looking
after Wilbur gets her fed up good. She is blacker than a yard up a chimney,
with not a white spot on her, and she grows so fast that by and by Wilbur
cannot carry her in his pocket any more, so he puts a collar on her and leads
her round. So Lillian becomes very well known on Broadway, what with Wilbur
taking her many places, and finally she does not even have to be led around by
Wilbur, but follows him like a pooch. And in all the Roaring Forties there is
no pooch that cares to have any truck with Lillian, for she will leap aboard
them quicker than you can say scat, and scratch and bite them until they are
very glad indeed to get away from her.</p>

<p>But of course the pooches in the Forties are mainly nothing but Chows, and
Pekes, and Poms, or little woolly white poodles, which are led around by blonde
dolls, and are not fit to take their own part against a smart cat. In fact,
Wilbur Willard is finally not on speaking terms with any doll that owns a pooch
between Times Square and Columbus Circle, and they are all hoping that both
Wilbur and Lillian will go lay down and die somewhere. Furthermore, Wilbur has
a couple of battles with guys who also belong to the dolls, but Wilbur is no
sucker in a battle if he is not mulled up too much and leg-weary.</p>

<p>After he is through entertaining people in the Hot Box, Wilbur generally
goes around to any speakeasies which may still be open, and does a little
off-hand drinking on top of what he already drinks down in the Hot Box, which
is plenty, and although it is considered very risky in this town to mix Hot Box
liquor with any other, it never seems to bother Wilbur. Along towards daylight
he takes a couple of bottles of Scotch over to his room in the Hotel de
Brussels and uses them for a nightcap, so by the time Wilbur Willard is ready
to slide off to sleep he has plenty of liquor of one kind and another inside
him, and he sleeps pretty.</p>

<p>Of course nobody on Broadway blames Wilbur so very much for being such a
rumpot, because they know about him loving Lillian Withington, and losing her,
and it is considered a reasonable excuse in this town for a guy to do some
drinking when he loses a doll, which is why there is so much drinking here, but
it is a mystery to one and all how Wilbur stands off all this liquor without
croaking. The cemeteries are full of guys who do a lot less drinking than
Wilbur, but he never even seems to feel extra tough, or if he does he keeps it
to himself and does not go around saying it is the kind of liquor you get
nowadays.</p>

<p>He costs some of the boys around Mindy's plenty of dough one winter, because
he starts in doing most of his drinking after hours in Good Time Charley's
speakeasy, and the boys lay a price of four to one against him lasting until
spring, never figuring a guy can drink very much of Good Time Charley's liquor
and keep on living. But Wilbur Willard does it just the same, so everybody says
the guy is naturally superhuman, and lets it go at that.</p>

<p>Sometimes Wilbur drops into Mindy's with Lillian following him on the
look-out for pooches, or riding on his shoulder if the weather is bad, and the
two of them will sit with us for hours chewing the rag about one thing and
another. At such times Wilbur generally has a bottle on his hip and takes a
shot now and then, but of course this does not come under the head of serious
drinking with him. When Lillian is with Wilbur she always lays as close to him
as she can get and anybody can see that she seems to be very fond of Wilbur,
and that he is very fond of her, although he sometimes forgets himself and
speaks of her as a beautiful leopard. But of course this is only a slip of the
tongue, and anyway if Wilbur gets any pleasure out of thinking Lillian is a
leopard, it is nobody's business but his own.</p>

<p>'I suppose she will run away from me some day,' Wilbur says, running his
hand over Lillian's back until her fur crackles. 'Yes, although I give her
plenty of liver and catnip, and one thing and another, and all my affection,
she will probably give me the shake. Cats are like women, and women are like
cats. They are both very ungrateful.'</p>

<p>'They are both generally bad luck,' Big Nig, the crap shooter, says.
'Especially cats, and most especially black cats.'</p>

<p>Many other guys tell Wilbur about black cats being bad luck, and advise him
to slip Lillian into the North River some night with a sinker on her, but
Wilbur claims he already has all the bad luck in the world when he loses
Lillian Withington, and that Lillian, the cat, cannot make it any worse, so he
goes on taking extra good care of her, and Lillian goes on getting bigger and
bigger, until I commence thinking maybe there is some St. Bernard in her.</p>

<p>Finally I commence to notice something funny about Lillian. Sometimes she
will be acting very loving towards Wilbur, and then again she will be very
unfriendly to him, and will spit at him, and snatch at him with her claws, very
hostile. It seems to me that she is all right when Willard is mulled up, but is
as sad and fretful as he is himself when he is only a little bit mulled. And
when Lillian is sad and fretful she makes it very tough indeed on the pooches
in the neighbourhood of the Brussels.</p>

<p>In fact, Lillian takes to pooch-hunting, sneaking off when Wilbur is getting
his rest, and running pooches bow-legged, especially when she finds one that is
not on a leash. A loose pooch is just naturally cherry pie for Lillian.</p>

<p>Well, of course, this causes great indignation among the dolls who own the
pooches, particularly when Lillian comes home one day carrying a Peke as big as
she is herself by the scruff of the neck, and with a very excited blonde doll
following her and yelling bloody murder outside Wilbur Willard's door when
Lillian pops into Wilbur's room through a hole he cuts in the door for her,
still lugging the Peke. But it seems that instead of being mad at Lillian and
giving her a pasting for such goings on, Wilbur is somewhat pleased, because he
happens to be still in a fog when Lillian arrives with the Peke, and is
thinking of Lillian as a beautiful leopard.</p>

<p>'Why,' Wilbur says, 'this is devotion, indeed. My beautiful leopard goes off
into the jungle and fetches me an antelope for dinner.'</p>

<p>Now of course there is no sense whatever to this, because a Peke is
certainly not anything like an antelope, but the blonde doll outside Wilbur's
door hears Wilbur mumble, and gets the idea that he is going to eat her Peke
for dinner and the squawk she puts up is very terrible. There is plenty of
trouble around the Brussels in chilling the blonde doll's beef over Lillian
snagging her Peke, and what is more the blonde doll's ever-loving guy, who
turns out to be a tough Ginney bootlegger by the name of Gregorio, shows up at
the Hot Box the next night and wishes to put the slug on Wilbur Willard.</p>

<p>But Wilbur rounds him up with a few drinks and by singing Melancholy Baby to
him, and before he leaves the Ginney gets very sentimental towards Wilbur, and
Lillian, too, and wishes to give Wilbur five bucks to let Lillian grab the Peke
again, if Lillian will promise not to bring it back. It seems Gregorio does not
really care for the Peke, and is only acting quarrelsome to please the blonde
doll and make her think he loves her dearly.</p>

<p>But I can see Lillian is having different moods, and finally I ask Wilbur if
he notices it.</p>

<p>'Yes,' he says, very sad, 'I do not seem to be holding her love. She is
getting very fickle. A guy moves on to my floor at the Brussels the other day
with a little boy, and Lillian becomes very fond of this kid at once. In fact,
they are great friends. Ah, well,' Wilbur says, 'cats are like women. Their
affection does not last.'</p>

<p>I happen to go over to the Brussels a few days later to explain to a guy by
the name of Crutchy, who lives on the same floor as Wilbur Willard, that some
of our citizens do not like his face and that it may be a good idea for him to
leave town, especially if he insists on bringing ale into their territory, and
I see Lillian out in the hall with a youngster which I judge is the kid Wilbur
is talking about. This kid is maybe three years old, and very cute, what with
black hair, and black eyes, and he is woolling Lillian around the hall in a way
that is most surprising, for Lillian is not such a cat as will stand for much
woolling around, not even from Wilbur Willard.</p>

<p>I am wondering how anybody comes to take such a kid to a joint like the
Brussels, but I figure it is some actor's kid, and that maybe there is no mamma
for it. Later I am talking to Wilbur about this, and he says:</p>

<p>'Well, if the kid's old man is an actor, he is not working at it. He sticks
close to his room all the time, and he does not allow the kid to go anywhere
but in the hall, and I feel sorry for the little guy, which is why I allow
Lillian to play with him.'</p>

<p>Now it comes on a very cold spell, and a bunch of us are sitting in Mindy's
along towards five o'clock in the morning when we hear fire engines
going past. By and by in comes a guy by the name of Kansas, who is named Kansas
because he comes from Kansas, and who is a crap shooter by trade.</p>

<p>'The old Brussels is on fire,' this guy Kansas says.</p>

<p>'She is always on fire,' Big Nig says, meaning there is always plenty of hot
stuff going on around the Brussels.</p>

<p>About this time who walks in but Wilbur Willard, and anybody can see he is
just naturally floating. The chances are he comes from Good Time Charley's, and
he is certainly carrying plenty of pressure. I never see Wilbur Willard mulled
up more. He does not have Lillian with him, but then he never takes Lillian to
Good Time Charley's, because Charley hates cats.</p>

<p>'Hey, Wilbur,' Big Nig says, 'your joint, the Brussels, is on fire.'</p>

<p>'Well,' Wilbur says, 'I am a little firefly, and I need a light. Let us go
where there is fire.'</p>

<p>The Brussels is only a few blocks from Mindy's, and there is nothing else to
do just then, so some of us walk over to Eighth Avenue with Wilbur teetering
along ahead of us. The old shack is certainly roaring good when we get in sight
of it, and the firemen are tossing water into it, and the coppers have the fire
lines out to keep the crowd back, although there is not much of a crowd at such
an hour in the morning.</p>

<p>'Is it not beautiful?' Wilbur Willard says, looking up at the flames. 'Is it
not like a fairy palace all lighted up this way?'</p>

<p>You see, Wilbur does not realize the joint is on fire, although guys and
dolls are running out of it every which way, most of them half dressed, or not
dressed at all, and the firemen are getting out the life nets in case anybody
wishes to hop out of the windows.</p>

<p>'It is certainly beautiful,' Wilbur says. 'I must get Lillian so she can see
this.'</p>

<p>And before anybody has time to think, there is Wilbur Willard walking into
the front door of the Brussels as if nothing happens. The firemen and the
coppers are so astonished all they can do is holler at Wilbur, but he pays no
attention whatever. Well, naturally everybody figures Wilbur is a gone gosling,
but in about ten minutes he comes walking out of this same door through the
fire and smoke as cool as you please, and he has Lillian in his arms.</p>

<p>'You know,' Wilbur says, coming over to where we are standing with our eyes
popping out, 'I have to walk all the way up to my floor because the elevators
seem to be out of commission. The service is getting terrible in this hotel. I
will certainly make a strong beef to the management about it as soon as I pay
something on my account.'</p>

<p>Then what happens but Lillian lets out a big mer-ow, and hops out of
Wilbur's arms and skips past the coppers and the firemen with her, back all
humped up, and the next thing anybody knows she is tearing through the front
door of the old hotel and making plenty of speed.</p>

<p>'Well, well,' Wilbur says, looking much surprised, 'there goes Lillian.'</p>

<p>And what does this daffy Wilbur Willard do but turn and go marching back
into the Brussels again, and by this time the smoke is pouring out of the front
doors so thick he is out of sight in a second. Naturally he takes the coppers
and firemen by surprise, because they are not used to guys walking in and out
of fires on them.</p>

<p>This time anybody standing around will lay you plenty of odds, two and a
half and maybe three to one that Wilbur never shows up again, because the old
Brussels is now just popping with fire and smoke from the lower windows,
although there does not seem to be quite so much fire in the upper story.
Everybody seems to be out of the joint, and even the firemen are fighting the
blaze from the outside because the Brussels is so old and ramshackly there is
no sense in them risking the floors.</p>

<p>I mean everybody is out of the joint except Wilbur Willard and Lillian, and
we figure they are getting a good frying somewhere inside, although Feet
Samuels is around offering to take thirteen to five for a few small bets that
Lillian comes out okay, because Feet claims that a cat has nine lives and that
is a fair bet at the price.</p>

<p>Well, up comes a swell-looking doll all heated up about something and
pushing and clawing her way through the crowd up to the ropes and screaming
until you can hardly hear yourself think, and about this same minute everybody
hears a voice going ai-lee-hihee-hoo, like a Swiss yodeller, which comes from
the roof of the Brussels, and looking up what do we see but Wilbur Willard
standing up there on the edge of the roof, high above the fire and smoke, and
yodelling very loud.</p>

<p>Under one arm he has a big bundle of some kind, and under the other he has
the little kid I see playing in the hall with Lillian. As he stands up there
going ai-lee-hi-hee-hoo, the swell-dressed doll near us begins yipping louder
than Wilbur is yodelling, and the firemen rush over under him with a life
net.</p>

<p>Wilbur lets go another ai-lee-hi-hee-hoo, and down he comes all spraddled
out, with the bundle and the kid, but he hits the net sitting down and bounces
up and back again for a couple of minutes before he finally settles. In fact,
Wilbur is enjoying the bouncing, and the chances are he will be bouncing yet if
the firemen do not drop their hold on the net and let him fall to the
ground.</p>

<p>Then Wilbur steps out of the net, and I can see the bundle is a rolled-up
blanket with Lillian's eyes peeking out of one end. He still has the kid under
the other arm with his head stuck out in front, and his legs stuck out behind,
and it does not seem to me that Wilbur is handling the kid as careful as he is
handling Lillian. He stands there looking at the firemen with a very sneering
look, and finally he says:</p>

<p>'Do not think you can catch me in your net unless I wish to be caught. I am
a butterfly, and very hard to overtake.'</p>

<p>Then all of a sudden the swell-dressed doll who is doing so much hollering,
piles on top of Wilbur and grabs the kid from him and begins hugging and
kissing it.</p>

<p>'Wilbur,' she says, 'God bless you, Wilbur, for saving my baby! Oh, thank
you, Wilbur, thank you! My wretched husband kidnaps and runs away with him, and
it is only a few hours ago that my detectives find out where he is.'</p>

<p>Wilbur gives the doll a funny look for about half a minute and starts to
walk away, but Lillian comes wiggling out of the blanket, looking and smelling
pretty much singed up, and the kid sees Lillian and begins hollering for her,
so Wilbur finally hands Lillian over to the kid. And not wishing to leave
Lillian, Wilbur stands around somewhat confused, and the doll gets talking to
him, and finally they go away together, and as they go Wilbur is carrying the
kid, and the kid is carrying Lillian, and Lillian is not feeling so good from
her burns.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Wilbur is probably more sober than he ever is before in years
at this hour in the morning, but before they go I get a chance to talk some to
Wilbur when he is still rambling somewhat, and I make out from what he says
that the first time he goes to get Lillian he finds her in his room and does
not see hide or hair of the little kid and does not even think of him, because
he does not know what room the kid is in, anyway, having never noticed such a
thing.</p>

<p>But the second time he goes up, Lillian is sniffing at the crack under the
door of a room down the hall from Wilbur's and Wilbur says he seems to remember
seeing a trickle of something like water coming out of the crack.</p>

<p>'And,' Wilbur says, 'as I am looking for a blanket for Lillian, and it will
be a bother to go back to my room, I figure I will get one out of this room. I
try the knob but the door is locked, so I kick it in, and walk in to find the
room full of smoke, and fire is shooting through the windows very lovely, and
when I grab a blanket off the bed for Lillian, what is under the blanket but
the kid?</p>

<p>'Well,' Wilbur says, 'the kid is squawking, and Lillian is merowing, and
there is so much confusion generally that it makes me nervous, so I figure we
better go up on the roof and let the stink blow off us, and look at the fire
from there. It seems there is a guy stretched out on the floor of the room
alongside an upset table between the door and the bed. He has a bottle in one
hand, and he is dead. Well, naturally there is no percentage in lugging a dead
guy along, so I take Lillian and the kid and go up on the roof, and we just
naturally fly off like humming birds. Now I must get a drink,' Wilbur says, 'I
wonder if anybody has anything on their hip?'</p>

<p>Well, the papers are certainly full of Wilbur and Lillian the next day,
especially Lillian, and they are both great heroes.</p>

<p>But Wilbur cannot stand the publicity very long, because he never has any
time to himself for his drinking, what with the scribes and the photographers
hopping on him every few minutes wishing to hear his story, and to take more
pictures of him and Lillian, so one night he disappears, and Lillian disappears
with him.</p>

<p>About a year later it comes out that he marries his old doll, Lillian
Withington-Harmon, and falls into a lot of dough, and what is more he cuts out
the liquor and becomes quite a useful citizen one way and another. So everybody
has to admit that black cats are not always bad luck, although I say Wilbur's
case is a little exceptional because he does not start out knowing Lillian is a
black cat, but thinking she is a leopard.</p>

<p>I happen to run into Wilbur one day all dressed up in good clothes and
jewellery and chucking quite a swell.</p>

<p>'Wilbur,' I say to him, 'I often think how remarkable it is the way Lillian
suddenly gets such an attachment for the little kid and remembers about him
being in the hotel and leads you back there a second time to the right room. If
I do not see this come off with my own eyes, I will never believe a cat has
brains enough to do such a thing, because I consider cats extra dumb.'</p>

<p>'Brains nothing,' Wilbur says. 'Lillian does not have brains enough to
grease a gimlet. And what is more, she has no more attachment for the kid than
a jack rabbit. The time has come,' Wilbur says, 'to expose Lillian. She gets a
lot of credit which is never coming to her. I will now tell you about Lillian,
and nobody knows this but me.</p>

<p>'You see,' Wilbur says, 'when Lillian is a little kitten I always put a
little Scotch in her milk, partly to help make her good and strong, and partly
because I am never no hand to drink alone, unless there is nobody with me.
Well, at first Lillian does not care so much for this Scotch in her milk, but
finally she takes a liking to it, and I keep making her toddy stronger until in
the end she will lap up a good big snort without any milk for a chaser, and
yell for more. In fact, I suddenly realize that Lillian becomes a rumpot, just
like I am in those days, and simply must have her grog, and it is when she is
good and rummed up that Lillian goes off snatching Pekes, and acting tough
generally.</p>

<p>'Now,' Wilbur says, 'the time of the fire is about the time I get home every
morning and give Lillian her schnapps. But when I go into the hotel and get her
the first time I forget to Scotch her up, and the reason she runs back into the
hotel is because she is looking for her shot. And the reason she is sniffing at
the kid's door is not because the kid is in there but because the trickle that
is coming through the crack under the door is nothing but Scotch that is
running out of the bottle in the dead guy's hand. I never mention this before
because I figure it may be a knock to a dead guy's memory,' Wilbur says.
'Drinking is certainly a disgusting thing, especially secret drinking.'</p>

<p>'But how is Lillian getting along these days?' I ask Wilbur Willard.</p>

<p>'I am greatly disappointed in Lillian,' he says. 'She refuses to reform when
I do, and the last I hear of her she takes up with Gregorio, the Ginney
bootlegger, who keeps her well Scotched up all the time so she will lead his
blonde doll's Peke a dog's life.'</p>

<h3><a name="Little_Miss_Marker" id="Little_Miss_Marker">Little Miss Marker</a></h3>
<p>One evening along toward seven o'clock, many citizens are standing out on
Broadway in front of Mindy's restaurant, speaking of one thing and another, and
particularly about the tough luck they have playing the races in the afternoon,
when who comes up the street with a little doll hanging on to his right thumb
but a guy by the name of Sorrowful.</p>

<p>This guy is called Sorrowful because this is the way he always is about no
matter what, and especially about the way things are with him when anybody
tries to put the bite on him. In fact, if anybody who tries to put the bite on
Sorrowful can listen to him for two minutes about how things are with him and
not bust into tears, they must be very hard-hearted, indeed.</p>

<p>Regret, the horse player, is telling me that he once tries to put the bite
on Sorrowful for a sawbuck, and by the time Sorrowful gets through explaining
how things are with him, Regret feels so sorry for him that he goes out and
puts the bite on somebody else for the saw and gives it to Sorrowful, although
it is well known to one and all that Sorrowful has plenty of potatoes hid away
somewhere.</p>

<p>He is a tall, skinny guy with a long, sad, mean-looking kisser, and a
mournful voice. He is maybe sixty years old, give or take a couple of years,
and for as long as I can remember he is running a handbook over in Forty-ninth
Street next door to a chop-suey joint. In fact, Sorrowful is one of the largest
handbook makers in this town.</p>

<p>Any time you see him he is generally by himself, because being by himself is
not apt to cost him anything, and it is therefore a most surprising scene when
he comes along Broadway with a little doll.</p>

<p>And there is much speculation among the citizens as to how this comes about,
for no one ever hears of Sorrowful having any family, or relations of any kind,
or even any friends.</p>

<p>The little doll is a very little doll indeed, the top of her noggin only
coming up to Sorrowful's knee, although of course Sorrowful has very high
knees, at that. Moreover, she is a very pretty little doll, with big blue eyes
and fat pink cheeks, and a lot of yellow curls hanging down her back, and she
has fat little legs and quite a large smile, although Sorrowful is lugging her
along the street so fast that half the time her feet are dragging the sidewalk
and she has a licence to be bawling instead of smiling.</p>

<p>Sorrowful is looking sadder than somewhat, which makes his face practically
heart-rending, so he pulls up in front of Mindy's and motions us to follow him
in. Anybody can see that he is worried about something very serious, and many
citizens are figuring that maybe he suddenly discovers all his potatoes are
counterfeit, because nobody can think of anything that will worry Sorrowful
except money.</p>

<p>Anyway, four or five of us gather around the table where Sorrowful sits down
with the little doll beside him, and he states a most surprising situation to
us.</p>

<p>It seems that early in the afternoon a young guy who is playing the races
with Sorrowful for several days pops into his place of business next door to
the chop-suey joint, leading the little doll, and this guy wishes to know how
much time he has before post in the first race at Empire.</p>

<p>Well, he only has about twenty-five minutes, and he seems very down-hearted
about this, because he explains to Sorrowful that he has a sure thing in this
race, which he gets the night before off a guy who is a pal of a close friend
of Jockey Workman's valet.</p>

<p>The young guy says he is figuring to bet himself about a deuce on this sure
thing, but he does not have such a sum as a deuce on him when he goes to bed,
so he plans to get up bright and early in the morning and hop down to a spot on
Fourteenth Street where he knows a guy who will let him have the deuce.</p>

<p>But it seems he oversleeps, and here it is almost post time, and it is too
late for him to get to Fourteenth Street and back before the race is run off,
and it is all quite a sad story indeed, although of course it does not make
much impression on Sorrowful, as he is already sadder than somewhat himself
just from thinking that somebody may beat him for a bet during the day, even
though the races do not start anywhere as yet.</p>

<p>Well, the young guy tells Sorrowful he is going to try to get to Fourteenth
Street and back in time to bet on the sure thing, because he says it will be
nothing short of a crime if he has to miss such a wonderful opportunity.</p>

<p>'But,' he says to Sorrowful, 'to make sure I do not miss, you take my marker
for a deuce, and I will leave the kid here with you as security until I get
back.'</p>

<p>Now, ordinarily, asking Sorrowful to take a marker will be considered great
foolishness, as it is well known to one and all that Sorrowful will not take a
marker from Andrew Mellon. In fact, Sorrowful can almost break your heart
telling you about the poorhouses that are full of bookmakers who take markers
in their time.</p>

<p>But it happens that business is just opening up for the day, and Sorrowful
is pretty busy, and besides the young guy is a steady customer for several
days, and has an honest pan, and Sorrowful figures a guy is bound to take a
little doll out of hock for a deuce. Furthermore, while Sorrowful does not know
much about kids, he can see the little doll must be worth a deuce, at least,
and maybe more.</p>

<p>So he nods his head, and the young guy puts the little doll on a chair and
goes tearing out of the joint to get the dough, while Sorrowful marks down a
deuce bet on Cold Cuts, which is the name of the sure thing. Then he forgets
all about the proposition for a while, and all the time the little doll is
sitting on the chair as quiet as a mouse, smiling at Sorrowful's customers,
including the Chinks from the chop-suey joint who come in now and then to play
the races.</p>

<p>Well, Cold Cuts blows, and in fact is not even fifth, and along late in the
afternoon Sorrowful suddenly realizes that the young guy never shows up again,
and that the little doll is still sitting in the chair, although she is now
playing with a butcher knife which one of the Chinks from the chop-suey joint
gives her to keep her amused.</p>

<p>Finally it comes on Sorrowful's closing time, and the little doll is still
there, so he can think of nothing else to do in this situation, but to bring
her around to Mindy's and get a little advice from different citizens, as he
does not care to leave her in his place of business alone, as Sorrowful will
not trust anybody in there alone, not even himself.</p>

<p>'Now,' Sorrowful says, after giving us this long spiel, 'what are we to do
about this proposition?'</p>

<p>Well, of course, up to this minute none of the rest of us know we are being
cut in on any proposition, and personally I do not care for any part of it, but
Big Nig, the crap shooter, speaks up as follows:</p>

<p>'If this little doll is sitting in your joint all afternoon,' Nig says, 'the
best thing to do right now is to throw a feed into her, as the chances are her
stomach thinks her throat is cut.'</p>

<p>Now this seems to be a fair sort of an idea, so Sorrowful orders up a couple
of portions of ham hocks and sauerkraut, which is a very tasty dish in Mindy's
at all times, and the little doll tears into it very enthusiastically, using
both hands, although a fat old doll who is sitting at the next table speaks up
and says this is terrible fodder to be tossing into a child at such an hour,
and where is her mamma?</p>

<p>'Well,' Big Nig says to the old doll, 'I hear of many people getting a bust
in the snoot for not minding their own business in this town, but you give off
an idea, at that. Listen,' Big Nig says to the little doll, 'where is your
mamma?'</p>

<p>But the little doll does not seem to know, or maybe she does not wish to
make this information public, because she only shakes her head and smiles at
Big Nig, as her mouth is too full of ham hocks and sauerkraut for her to
talk.</p>

<p>'What is your name?' Big Nig asks, and she says something that Big Nig
claims sounds like Marky, although personally I think she is trying to say
Martha. Anyway it is from this that she gets the name we always call her
afterward, which is Marky.</p>

<p>'It is a good monicker,' Big Nig says. 'It is short for marker, and she is
certainly a marker unless Sorrowful is telling us a large lie. Why,' Big Nig
says, 'this is a very cute little doll, at that, and pretty smart. How old are
you, Marky?'</p>

<p>She only shakes her head again, so Regret, the horse player, who claims he
can tell how old a horse is by its teeth, reaches over and sticks his finger in
her mouth to get a peek at her crockery, but she seems to think Regret's finger
is a hunk of ham hock and shuts down on it so hard Regret lets out an awful
squawk. But he says that before she tries to cripple him for life he sees
enough of her teeth to convince him she is maybe three, rising four, and this
seems reasonable, at that. Anyway, she cannot be much older.</p>

<p>Well, about this time a guinea with a hand organ stops out in front of
Mindy's and begins grinding out a tune while his ever-loving wife is passing a
tambourine around among the citizens on the sidewalk and, on hearing this
music, Marky slides off of her chair with her mouth still full of ham hock and
sauerkraut, which she swallows so fast she almost chokes, and then she speaks
as follows:</p>

<p>'Marky dance,' she says.</p>

<p>Then she begins hopping and skipping around among the tables, holding her
little short skirt up in her hands and showing a pair of white panties
underneath. Pretty soon Mindy himself comes along and starts putting up a beef
about making a dance hall of his joint, but a guy by the name of Sleep-out, who
is watching Marky with much interest, offers to bounce a sugar bowl off of
Mindy's sconce if he does not mind his own business.</p>

<p>So Mindy goes away, but he keeps muttering about the white panties being a
most immodest spectacle, which of course is great nonsense, as many dolls older
than Marky are known to do dances in Mindy's, especially on the late watch,
when they stop by for a snack on their way home from the night clubs and the
speaks, and I hear some of them do not always wear white panties, either.</p>

<p>Personally, I like Marky's dancing very much, although of course she is no
Pavlova, and finally she trips over her own feet and falls on her snoot. But
she gets up smiling and climbs back on her chair and pretty soon she is sound
asleep with her head against Sorrowful.</p>

<p>Well, now there is much discussion about what Sorrowful ought to do with
her. Some claim he ought to take her to a police station, and others say the
best thing to do is to put an ad. in the Lost and Found columns of the morning
bladders, the same as people do when they find Angora cats, and Pekes, and
other animals which they do not wish to keep, but none of these ideas seems to
appeal to Sorrowful.</p>

<p>Finally he says he will take her to his own home and let her sleep there
while he is deciding what is to be done about her, so Sorrowful takes Marky in
his arms and lugs her over to a fleabag in West Forty-ninth Street where he has
a room for many years, and afterward a bell hop tells me Sorrowful sits up all
night watching her while she is sleeping.</p>

<p>Now what happens but Sorrowful takes on a great fondness for the little
doll, which is most surprising, as Sorrowful is never before fond of anybody or
anything, and after he has her overnight he cannot bear the idea of giving her
up.</p>

<p>Personally, I will just as soon have a three-year-old baby wolf around me as
a little doll such as this, but Sorrowful thinks she is the greatest thing that
ever happens. He has a few inquiries made around and about to see if he can
find out who she belongs to, and he is tickled silly when nothing comes of
these inquiries, although nobody else figures anything will come of them
anyway, as it is by no means uncommon in this town for little kids to be left
sitting in little chairs, or on doorsteps, to be chucked into orphan asylums by
whoever finds them.</p>

<p>Anyway, Sorrowful says he is going to keep Marky, and his attitude causes
great surprise, as keeping Marky is bound to be an expense, and it does not
seem reasonable that Sorrowful will go to any expense for anything. When it
commences to look as if he means what he says, many citizens naturally figure
there must be an angle, and soon there are a great many rumours on the
subject.</p>

<p>Of course one of these rumours is that the chances are Marky is Sorrowful's
own offspring which is tossed back on him by the wronged mamma, but this rumour
is started by a guy who does not know Sorrowful, and after he gets a gander at
Sorrowful, the guy apologizes, saying he realizes that no wronged mamma will be
daffy enough to permit herself to be wronged by Sorrowful. Personally, I always
say that if Sorrowful wishes to keep Marky it is his own business, and most of
the citizens around Mindy's agree with me.</p>

<p>But the trouble is Sorrowful at once cuts everybody else in on the
management of Marky, and the way he talks to the citizens around Mindy's about
her, you will think we are all personally responsible for her. As most of the
citizens around Mindy's are bachelors, or are wishing they are bachelors, it is
most inconvenient to them to suddenly find themselves with a family.</p>

<p>Some of us try to explain to Sorrowful that if he is going to keep Marky it
is up to him to handle all her play, but right away Sorrowful starts talking so
sad about all his pals deserting him and Marky just when they need them most
that it softens all hearts, although up to this time we are about as pally with
Sorrowful as a burglar with a copper. Finally every night in Mindy's is meeting
night for a committee to decide something or other about Marky.</p>

<p>The first thing we decide is that the fleabag where Sorrowful lives is no
place for Marky, so Sorrowful hires a big apartment in one of the swellest
joints on West Fifty-ninth Street, overlooking Central Park, and spends plenty
of potatoes furnishing it, although up to this time Sorrowful never sets
himself back more than about ten bobs per week for a place to live and
considers it extravagance, at that. I hear it costs him five G's to fix up
Marky's bedroom alone, not counting the solid gold toilet set that he buys for
her. Then he gets her an automobile and he has to hire a guy to drive it for
her, and finally when we explain to Sorrowful that it does not look right for
Marky to be living with nobody but him and a chauffeur, Sorrowful hires a
French doll with bobbed hair and red cheeks by the name of Mam'selle Fifi as a
nurse for Marky, and this seems to be quite a sensible move, as it insures
Marky plenty of company.</p>

<p>In fact, up to the time that Sorrowful hires Mam'selle Fifi, many citizens
are commencing to consider Marky something of a nuisance and are playing the
duck for her and Sorrowful, but after Mam'selle Fifi comes along you can
scarcely get in Sorrowful's joint on Fifty-ninth Street, or around his table in
Mindy's when he brings Marky and Mam'selle Fifi in to eat. But one night
Sorrowful goes home early and catches Sleep-out guzzling Mam'selle Fifi, and
Sorrowful makes Mam'selle Fifi take plenty of breeze, claiming she will set a
bad example to Marky.</p>

<p>Then he gets an old tomato by the name of Mrs. Clancy to be Marky's nurse,
and while there is no doubt Mrs. Clancy is a better nurse than Mam'selle Fifi
and there is practically no danger of her setting Marky a bad example, the play
at Sorrowful's joint is by no means as brisk as formerly.</p>

<p>You can see that from being closer than a dead heat with his potatoes,
Sorrowful becomes as loose as ashes. He not only spends plenty on Marky, but he
starts picking up checks in Mindy's and other spots, although up to this time
picking up checks is something that is most repulsive to Sorrowful.</p>

<p>He gets so he will hold still for a bite, if the bite is not too savage and,
what is more, a great change comes over his kisser. It is no longer so sad and
mean looking, and in fact it is almost a pleasant sight at times, especially as
Sorrowful gets so he smiles now and then, and has a big hello for one and all,
and everybody says the Mayor ought to give Marky a medal for bringing about
such a wonderful change.</p>

<p>Now Sorrowful is so fond of Marky that he wants her with him all the time,
and by and by there is much criticism of him for having her around his handbook
joint among the Chinks and the horse players, and especially the horse players,
and for taking her around night clubs and keeping her out at all hours, as some
people do not consider this a proper bringing-up for a little doll.</p>

<p>We hold a meeting in Mindy's on this proposition one night, and we get
Sorrowful to agree to keep Marky out of his joint, but we know Marky is so fond
of night clubs, especially where there is music, that it seems a sin and a
shame to deprive her of this pleasure altogether, so we finally compromise by
letting Sorrowful take her out one night a week to the Hot Box in Fifty-fourth
Street, which is only a few blocks from where Marky lives, and Sorrowful can
get her home fairly early. In fact, after this Sorrowful seldom keeps her out
any later than 2 a.m.</p>

<p>The reason Marky likes night clubs where there is music is because she can
do her dance there, as Marky is practically daffy on the subject of dancing,
especially by herself, even though she never seems to be able to get over
winding up by falling on her snoot, which many citizens consider a very
artistic finish, at that.</p>

<p>The Choo-Choo Boys' band in the Hot Box always play a special number for
Marky in between the regular dances, and she gets plenty of applause,
especially from the Broadway citizens who know her, although Henri, the manager
of the Hot Box, once tells me he will just as soon Marky does not do her
dancing there, because one night several of his best customers from Park
Avenue, including two millionaires and two old dolls, who do not understand
Marky's dancing, bust out laughing when she falls on her snoot, and Big Nig
puts the slug on the guys, and is trying to put the slug on the old dolls, too,
when he is finally headed off.</p>

<p>Now one cold, snowy night, many citizens are sitting around the tables in
the Hot Box, speaking of one thing and another and having a few drams, when
Sorrowful drops in on his way home, for Sorrowful has now become a guy who is
around and about, and in and out. He does not have Marky with him, as it is not
her night out and she is home with Mrs. Clancy.</p>

<p>A few minutes after Sorrowful arrives, a party by the name of Milk Ear
Willie from the West Side comes in, this Milk Ear Willie being a party who is
once a prize fighter and who has a milk ear, which is the reason he is called
Milk Ear Willie, and who is known to carry a John Roscoe in his pants pocket.
Furthermore, it is well known that he knocks off several guys in his time, so
he is considered rather a suspicious character.</p>

<p>It seems that the reason he comes into the Hot Box is to shoot Sorrowful
full of little holes, because he has a dispute with Sorrowful about a parlay on
the races the day before, and the chances are Sorrowful will now be very dead
if it does not happen that, just as Milk Ear outs with the old equalizer and
starts taking dead aim at Sorrowful from a table across the room, who pops into
the joint but Marky.</p>

<p>She is in a long nightgown that keeps getting tangled up in her bare feet as
she runs across the dance floor and jumps into Sorrowful's arms, so if Milk Ear
Willie lets go at this time he is apt to put a slug in Marky, and this is by no
means Willie's intention. So Willie puts his rod back in his kick, but he is
greatly disgusted and stops as he is going out and makes a large complaint to
Henri about allowing children in a night club.</p>

<p>Well, Sorrowful does not learn until afterward how Marky saves his life, as
he is too much horrified over her coming four or five blocks through the snow
bare-footed to think of anything else, and everybody present is also horrified
and wondering how Marky finds her way there. But Marky does not seem to have
any good explanation for her conduct, except that she wakes up and discovers
Mrs. Clancy asleep and gets to feeling lonesome for Sorrowful.</p>

<p>About this time, the Choo-Choo Boys start playing Marky's tune, and she
slips out of Sorrowful's arms and runs out on the dance floor.</p>

<p>'Marky dance,' she says.</p>

<p>Then she lifts her nightgown in her hands and starts hopping and skipping
about the floor until Sorrowful collects her in his arms again, and wraps her
in an overcoat and takes her home.</p>

<p>Now what happens but the next day Marky is sick from being out in the snow
bare-footed and with nothing on but her nightgown, and by night she is very
sick indeed, and it seems that she has pneumonia, so Sorrowful takes her to the
Clinic hospital, and hires two nurses and two croakers, and wishes to hire
more, only they tell him these will do for the present.</p>

<p>The next day Marky is no better, and the next night she is worse, and the
management of the Clinic is very much upset because it has no place to put the
baskets of fruit and candy and floral horseshoes and crates of dolls and toys
that keep arriving every few minutes. Furthermore, the management by no means
approves of the citizens who are tiptoeing along the hall on the floor where
Marky has her room, especially such as Big Nig, and Sleep-out, and Wop Joey,
and the Pale Face Kid and Guinea Mike and many other prominent characters,
especially as these characters keep trying to date up the nurses.</p>

<p>Of course I can see the management's point of view, but I wish to say that
no visitor to the Clinic ever brings more joy and cheer to the patients than
Sleep-out, as he goes calling in all the private rooms and wards to say a
pleasant word or two to the inmates, and I never take any stock in the rumour
that he is looking around to see if there is anything worth picking up. In
fact, an old doll from Rockville Centre, who is suffering with yellow jaundice,
puts up an awful holler when Sleep-out is heaved from her room, because she
says he is right in the middle of a story about a travelling salesman and she
wishes to learn what happens.</p>

<p>There are so many prominent characters in and around the Clinic that the
morning bladders finally get the idea that some well-known mob guy must be in
the hospital full of slugs, and by and by the reporters come buzzing around to
see what is what. Naturally they find out that all this interest is in nothing
but a little doll, and while you will naturally think that such a little doll
as Marky can scarcely be worth the attention of the reporters, it seems they
get more heated up over her when they hear the story than if she is Jack
Diamond.</p>

<p>In fact, the next day all the bladders have large stories about Marky, and
also about Sorrowful and about how all these prominent characters of Broadway
are hanging around the Clinic on her account. Moreover, one story tells about
Sleep-out entertaining the other patients in the hospital, and it makes
Sleep-out sound like a very large-hearted guy.</p>

<p>It is maybe three o'clock on the morning of the fourth day Marky is in the
hospital that Sorrowful comes into Mindy's looking very sad, indeed. He orders
a sturgeon sandwich on pumpernickel, and then he explains that Marky seems to
be getting worse by the minute and that he does not think his doctors are doing
her any good, and at this Big Nig, the crap shooter, speaks up and states as
follows:</p>

<p>'Well,' Big Nig says, 'if we are only able to get Doc Beerfeldt, the great
pneumonia specialist, the chances are he will cure Marky like breaking sticks.
But of course,' Nig says, 'it is impossible to get Doc Beerfeldt unless you are
somebody like John D. Rockefeller, or maybe the President.'</p>

<p>Naturally, everybody knows that what Big Nig says is very true, for Doc
Beerfeldt is the biggest croaker in this town, but no ordinary guy can get
close enough to Doc Beerfeldt to hand him a ripe peach, let alone get him to go
out on a case. He is an old guy, and he does not practise much any more, and
then only among a few very rich and influential people. Furthermore, he has
plenty of potatoes himself, so money does not interest him whatever, and anyway
it is great foolishness to be talking of getting Doc Beerfeldt out at such an
hour as this.</p>

<p>'Who do we know who knows Doc Beerfeldt?' Sorrowful says. 'Who can we call
up who may have influence enough with him to get him to just look at Marky? I
will pay any price,' he says. 'Think of somebody,' he says.</p>

<p>Well, while we are all trying to think, who comes in but Milk Ear Willie,
and he comes in to toss a few slugs at Sorrowful, but before Milk Ear can start
blasting Sleep-out sees him and jumps up and takes him off to a corner table,
and starts Whispering in Milk Ear's good ear.</p>

<p>As Sleep-out talks to him Milk Ear looks at Sorrowful in great surprise, and
finally he begins nodding his head, and by and by he gets up and goes out of
the joint in a hurry, while Sleep-out comes back to our table and says like
this:</p>

<p>'Well,' Sleep-out says, 'let us stroll over to the Clinic. I just send Milk
Ear Willie up to Doc Beerfeldt's house on Park Avenue to get the old Doc and
bring him to the hospital. But, Sorrowful,' Sleep-out says, 'if he gets him,
you must pay Willie the parlay you dispute with him, whatever it is. The
chances are,' Sleep-out says, 'Willie is right. I remember once you out-argue
me on a parlay when I know I am right.'</p>

<p>Personally, I consider Sleep-out's talk about sending Milk Ear Willie after
Doc Beerfeldt just so much nonsense, and so does everybody else, but we figure
maybe Sleep-out is trying to raise Sorrowful's hopes, and anyway he keeps Milk
Ear from tossing these slugs at Sorrowful, which everybody considers very
thoughtful of Sleep-out, at least, especially as Sorrowful is under too great a
strain to be dodging slugs just now.</p>

<p>About a dozen of us walk over to the Clinic, and most of us stand around the
lobby on the ground floor, although Sorrowful goes up to Marky's floor to wait
outside her door. He is waiting there from the time she is first taken to the
hospital, never leaving except to go over to Mindy's once in a while to get
something to eat, and occasionally they open the door a little to let him get a
peek at Marky.</p>

<p>Well, it is maybe six o'clock when we hear a taxi stop outside the hospital
and pretty soon in comes Milk Ear Willie with another character from the West
Side by the name of Fats Finstein, who is well known to one and all as a great
friend of Willie's, and in between them they have a little old guy with a
Vandyke beard, who does not seem to have on anything much but a silk
dressing-gown and who seems somewhat agitated, especially as Milk Ear Willie
and Fats Finstein keep prodding him from behind.</p>

<p>Now it comes out that this little old guy is nobody but Doc Beerfeldt, the
great pneumonia specialist, and personally I never see a madder guy, although I
wish to say I never-blame him much for being mad when I learn how Milk Ear
Willie and Fats Finstein boff his butler over the noggin when he answers their
ring, and how they walk right into old Doc Beerfeldt's bedroom and haul him out
of the hay at the point of their Roscoes and make him go with them.</p>

<p>In fact, I consider such treatment most discourteous to a prominent croaker,
and if I am Doc Beerfeldt I will start hollering copper as soon as I hit the
hospital, and for all I know maybe Doc Beerfeldt has just such an idea, but as
Milk Ear Willie and Fats Finstein haul him into the lobby who comes downstairs
but Sorrowful. And the minute Sorrowful sees Doc Beerfeldt he rushes up to him
and says like this:</p>

<p>'Oh Doc,' Sorrowful says, 'do something for my little girl. She is dying,
Doc,' Sorrowful says. 'Just a little bit of a girl, Doc. Her name is Marky. I
am only a gambler, Doc, and I do not mean anything to you or to anybody else,
but please save the little girl.'</p>

<p>Well, old Doc Beerfeldt sticks out his Vandyke beard and looks at Sorrowful
a minute, and he can see there are large tears in old Sorrowful's eyes, and for
all I know maybe the Doc knows it has been many and many a year since there are
tears in these eyes, at that. Then the Doc looks at Milk Ear Willie and Fats
Finstein and the rest of us, and at the nurses and internes who are commencing
to come running up from every which way. Finally, he speaks as follows:</p>

<p>'What is this?' he says. 'A child? A little child? Why,' he says, 'I am
under the impression that these gorillas are kidnapping me to attend to some
other sick or wounded gorilla. A child? This is quite different. Why do you not
say so in the first place? Where is the child?' Doc Beerfeldt says, 'and,' he
says, 'somebody get me some pants.'</p>

<p>We all follow him upstairs to the door of Marky's room and we wait outside
when he goes in, and we wait there for hours, because it seems that even old
Doc Beerfeldt cannot think of anything to do in this situation no matter how he
tries. And along toward ten-thirty in the morning he opens the door very
quietly and motions Sorrowful to come in, and then he motions all the rest of
us to follow, shaking his head very sad.</p>

<p>There are so many of us that we fill the room around a little high narrow
bed on which Marky is lying like a flower against a white wall, her yellow
curls spread out over her pillow. Old Sorrowful drops on his knees beside the
bed and his shoulders heave quite some as he kneels there, and I hear Sleep-out
sniffing as if he has a cold in his head. Marky seems to be asleep when we go
in, but while we are standing around the bed looking down at her, she opens her
eyes and seems to see us and, what is more, she seems to know us, because she
smiles at each guy in turn and then tries to hold out one of her little hands
to Sorrowful.</p>

<p>Now very faint, like from far away, comes a sound of music through a
half-open window in the room, from a jazz band that is rehearsing in a hall
just up the street from the hospital, and Marky hears this music because she
holds her head in such a way that anybody can see she is listening, and then
she smiles again at us and whispers very plain, as follows:</p>

<p>'Marky dance.'</p>

<p>And she tries to reach down as if to pick up her skirt as she always does
when she dances, but her hands fall across her breast as soft and white and
light as snowflakes, and Marky never again dances in this world.</p>

<p>Well, old Doc Beerfeldt and the nurses make us go outside at once, and while
we are standing there in the hall outside the door, saying nothing whatever, a
young guy and two dolls, one of them old, and the other not so old, come along
the hall much excited. The young guy seems to know Sorrowful, who is sitting
down again in his chair just outside the door, because he rushes up to
Sorrowful and says to him like this:</p>

<p>'Where is she?' he says. 'Where is my darling child? You remember me?' he
says. 'I leave my little girl with you one day while I go on an errand, and
while I am on this errand everything goes blank, and I wind up back in my home
in Indianapolis with my mother and sister here, and recall nothing about where
I leave my child, or anything else.'</p>

<p>'The poor boy has amnesia,' the old doll says. 'The stories that he
deliberately abandons his wife in Paris and his child in New York are
untrue.'</p>

<p>'Yes,' the doll who is not old puts in. 'If we do not see the stories in the
newspapers about how you have the child in this hospital we may never learn
where she is. But everything is all right now. Of course we never approve of
Harold's marriage to a person of the stage, and we only recently learn of her
death in Paris soon after their separation there and are very sorry. But
everything is all right now. We will take full charge of the child.'</p>

<p>Now while all this gab is going on, Sorrowful never glances at them. He is
just sitting there looking at Marky's door. And now as he is looking at the
door a very strange thing seems to happen to his kisser, for all of a sudden it
becomes the sad, mean-looking kisser that it is in the days before he ever sees
Marky, and furthermore it is never again anything else.</p>

<p>'We will be rich,' the young guy says. 'We just learn that my darling child
will be sole heiress to her maternal grand papa's fortune, and the old guy is
only a hop ahead of the undertaker right now. I suppose,' he says, 'I owe you
something?'</p>

<p>And then Sorrowful gets up off his chair, and looks at the young guy and at
the two dolls, and speaks as follows:</p>

<p>'Yes,' he says, 'you owe me a two-dollar marker for the bet you blow on Cold
Cuts, and,' he says, 'I will trouble you to send it to me at once, so I can
wipe you off my books.'</p>

<p>Now he walks down the hall and out of the hospital, never looking back
again, and there is a very great silence behind him that is broken only by the
sniffing of Sleep-out, and by some first-class sobbing from some of the rest of
us, and I remember now that the guy who is doing the best job of sobbing of all
is nobody but Milk Ear Willie.</p>

<h3><a name="Pick_the_Winner" id="Pick_the_Winner">Pick the Winner</a></h3>
<p>What I am doing in Miami associating with such a character as Hot Horse
Herbie is really quite a long story, and it goes back to one cold night when I
am sitting in Mindy's restaurant on Broadway thinking what a cruel world it is,
to be sure, when in comes Hot Horse Herbie and his ever-loving fiancée, Miss
Cutie Singleton.</p>

<p>This Hot Horse Herbie is a tall, skinny guy with a most depressing kisser,
and he is called Hot Horse Herbie because he can always tell you about a horse
that is so hot it is practically on fire, a hot horse being a horse that is all
readied up to win a race, although sometimes Herbie's hot horses turn out to be
so cold they freeze everybody within fifty miles of them.</p>

<p>He is following the races almost since infancy, to hear him tell it. In
fact, old Captain Duhaine, who has charge of the Pinkertons around the race
tracks, says he remembers Hot Horse Herbie as a little child, and that even
then Herbie is a hustler, but of course Captain Duhaine does not care for Hot
Horse Herbie, because he claims Herbie is nothing but a tout, and a tout is
something that is most repulsive to Captain Duhaine and all other
Pinkertons.</p>

<p>A tout is a guy who goes around a race track giving out tips on the races,
if he can find anybody who will listen to his tips, especially suckers, and a
tout is nearly always broke. If he is not broke, he is by no means a tout, but
a handicapper, and is respected by one and all, including the Pinkertons, for
knowing so much about the races.</p>

<p>Well, personally, I have nothing much against Hot Horse Herbie, no matter
what Captain Duhaine says he is, and I certainly have nothing against Herbie's
ever-loving fiancée, Miss Cutie Singleton. In fact, I am rather in favour of
Miss Cutie Singleton, because in all the years I know her, I wish to say I
never catch Miss Cutie Singleton out of line, which is more than I can say of
many other dolls I know.</p>

<p>She is a little, good-natured blonde doll, and by no means a crow, if you
care for blondes, and some people say that Miss Cutie Singleton is pretty
smart, although I never can see how this can be, as I figure a smart doll will
never have any truck with a guy like Hot Horse Herbie, for Herbie is by no
means a provider.</p>

<p>But for going on ten years, Miss Cutie Singleton and Hot Horse Herbie are
engaged, and it is well known to one and all that they are to be married as
soon as Herbie makes a scratch. In fact, they are almost married in New Orleans
in 1928, when Hot Horse Herbie beats a good thing for eleven C's, but the tough
part of it is the good thing is in the first race, and naturally Herbie bets
the eleven C's right back on another good thing in the next race, and this good
thing blows, so Herbie winds up with nothing but the morning line and is unable
to marry Miss Cutie Singleton at this time.</p>

<p>Then again in 1929 at Churchill Downs, Hot Horse Herbie has a nice bet on
Naishapur to win the Kentucky Derby, and he is so sure Naishapur cannot miss
that the morning of the race he sends Miss Cutie Singleton out to pick a
wedding ring. But Naishapur finishes second, so naturally Hot Horse Herbie is
unable to buy the ring, and of course Miss Cutie Singleton does not wish to be
married without a wedding ring.</p>

<p>They have another close call in 1931 at Baltimore when Hot Horse Herbie
figures Twenty Grand a stand-out in the Preakness, and in fact is so sure of
his figures that he has Miss Cutie Singleton go down to the city hall to find
out what a marriage licence costs. But of course Twenty Grand does not win the
Preakness, so the information Miss Cutie Singleton obtains is of no use to them
and anyway Hot Horse Herbie says he can beat the price on marriage licences in
New York.</p>

<p>However, there is no doubt but what Hot Horse Herbie and Miss Cutie
Singleton are greatly in love, although I hear rumours that for a couple of
years past Miss Cutie Singleton is getting somewhat impatient about Hot Horse
Herbie not making a scratch as soon as he claims he is going to when he first
meets up with her in Hot Springs in 1923.</p>

<p>In fact, Miss Cutie Singleton says if she knows Hot Horse Herbie is going to
be so long delayed in making his scratch she will never consider becoming
engaged to him, but will keep her job as a manicurist at the Arlington Hotel,
where she is not doing bad, at that.</p>

<p>It seems that the past couple of years Miss Cutie Singleton is taking to
looking longingly at the little houses in the towns they pass through going
from one race track to another, and especially at little white houses with
green shutters and yards and vines all around and about, and saying it must be
nice to be able to live in such places instead of in a suitcase.</p>

<p>But of course Hot Horse Herbie does not put in with her on these ideas,
because Herbie knows very well if he is placed in a little white house for more
than fifteen minutes the chances are he will lose his mind, even if the house
has green shutters.</p>

<p>Personally, I consider Miss Cutie Singleton somewhat ungrateful for thinking
of such matters after all the scenery Hot Horse Herbie lets her see in the past
ten years. In fact, Herbie lets her see practically all the scenery there is in
this country, and some in Canada, and all she has to do in return for all this
courtesy is to occasionally get out a little crystal ball and deck of cards and
let on she is a fortune teller when things are going especially tough for
Herbie.</p>

<p>Of course Miss Cutie Singleton cannot really tell fortunes, or she will be
telling Hot Horse Herbie's fortune, and maybe her own, too, but I hear she is
better than a raw hand at making people believe she is telling their fortunes,
especially old maids who think they are in love, or widows who are looking to
snare another husband and other such characters.</p>

<p>Well, anyway, when Hot Horse Herbie and his ever-loving fiancée come into
Mindy's, he gives me a large hello, and so does Miss Curie Singleton, so I
hello them right back, and Hot Horse Herbie speaks to me as follows:</p>

<p>'Well,' Herbie says, 'we have some wonderful news for you. We are going to
Miami,' he says, 'and soon we will be among the waving palms, and revelling in
the warm waters of the Gulf Stream.'</p>

<p>Now of course this is a lie, because while Hot Horse Herbie is in Miami many
times, he never revels in the warm waters of the Gulf Stream, because he never
has time for such a thing, what with hustling around the race tracks in the
daytime, and around the dog tracks and the gambling joints at night, and in
fact I will lay plenty of six to five Hot Horse Herbie cannot even point in the
direction of the Gulf Stream when he is in Miami, and I will give him three
points, at that.</p>

<p>But naturally what he says gets me to thinking how pleasant it is in Miami
in the winter, especially when it is snowing up north, and a guy does not have
a flogger to keep himself warm, and I am commencing to feel very envious of Hot
Horse Herbie and his ever-loving fiancée when he says like this:</p>

<p>'But,' Herbie says, 'our wonderful news for you is not about us going. It is
about you going,' he says. 'We already have our railroad tickets,' he says, 'as
Miss Cutie Singleton, my ever-loving fiancée here, saves up three C's for her
hope chest the past summer, but when it comes to deciding between a hope chest
and Miami, naturally she chooses Miami, because,' Herbie says, 'she claims she
does not have enough hope left to fill a chest. Miss Cutie Singleton is always
kidding,' he says.</p>

<p>'Well, now,' Herbie goes on, 'I just run into Mr. Edward Donlin, the
undertaker, and it seems that he is sending a citizen of Miami back home
to-morrow night, and of course you know,' he says, 'that Mr. Donlin must
purchase two railroad tickets for this journey, and as the citizen has no one
else to accompany him, I got to thinking of you. He is a very old and respected
citizen of Miami,' Herbie says, 'although of course,' he says, 'he is no longer
with us, except maybe in spirit.'</p>

<p>Of course such an idea is most obnoxious to me, and I am very indignant that
Hot Horse Herbie can even think I will travel in this manner, but he gets to
telling me that the old and respected citizen of Miami that Mr. Donlin is
sending back home is a great old guy in his day, and that for all anybody knows
he will appreciate having company on the trip, and about this time Big Nig, the
crap shooter, comes into Mindy's leaving the door open behind him so that a
blast of cold air hits me, and makes me think more than somewhat of the waving
palms and the warm waters of the Gulf Stream.</p>

<p>So the next thing I know, there I am in Miami with Hot Horse Herbie, and it
is the winter of 1931, and everybody now knows that this is the winter when the
suffering among the horse players in Miami is practically horrible. In fact, it
is worse than it is in the winter of 1930. In fact, the suffering is so intense
that many citizens are wondering if it will do any good to appeal to Congress
for relief for the horse players, but The Dander says he hears Congress needs a
little relief itself.</p>

<p>Hot Horse Herbie and his ever-loving fiancée, Miss Cutie Singleton, and me
have rooms in a little hotel on Flagler Street, and while it is nothing but a
fleabag, and we are doing the landlord a favour by living there, it is
surprising how much fuss he makes any time anybody happens to be a little short
of the rent. In fact, the landlord hollers and yells so much any time anybody
is a little short of the rent that he becomes a very great nuisance to me, and
I have half a notion to move, only I cannot think of any place to move to.
Furthermore, the landlord will not let me move unless I pay him all I owe him,
and I am not in a position to take care of this matter at the moment.</p>

<p>Of course I am not very dirty when I first come in as far as having any
potatoes is concerned, and I start off at once having a little bad luck. It
goes this way a while, and then it gets worse, and sometimes I wonder if I will
not be better off if I buy myself a rope and end it all on a palm tree in the
park on Biscayne Boulevard. But the only trouble with the idea is I do not have
the price of a rope, and anyway I hear most of the palm trees in the park are
already spoken for by guys who have the same notion.</p>

<p>And bad off as I am, I am not half as bad off as Hot Horse Herbie, because
he has his ever-loving fiancée, Miss Cutie Singleton, to think of, especially
as Miss Cutie Singleton is putting up quite a beef about not having any
recreation, and saying if she only has the brains God gives geese she will
break off their engagement at once and find some guy who can show her a little
speed, and she seems to have no sympathy whatever for Hot Horse Herbie when he
tells her how many tough snoots he gets beat at the track.</p>

<p>But Herbie is very patient with her, and tells her it will not be long now,
because the law of averages is such that his luck is bound to change, and he
suggests to Miss Cutie Singleton that she get the addresses of a few preachers
in case they wish to locate one in a hurry. Furthermore, Hot Horse Herbie
suggests to Miss Cutie Singleton that she get out the old crystal ball and her
deck of cards, and hang out her sign as a fortune teller while they are waiting
for the law of averages to start working for him, although personally I doubt
if she will be able to get any business telling fortunes in Miami at this time
because everybody in Miami seems to know what their fortune is already.</p>

<p>Now I wish to say that after we arrive in Miami I have very little truck
with Hot Horse Herbie, because I do not approve of some of his business
methods, and furthermore I do not wish Captain Duhaine and his Pinkertons at my
hip all the time, as I never permit myself to get out of line in any respect,
or anyway not much. But of course I see Hot Horse Herbie at the track every
day, and one day I see him talking to the most innocent-looking guy I ever see
in all my life.</p>

<p>He is a tall, spindling guy with a soft brown Vandyke beard, and soft brown
hair, and no hat, and he is maybe forty-odd, and wears rumpled white flannel
pants, and a rumpled sports coat, and big horn cheaters, and he is smoking a
pipe that you can smell a block away. He is such a guy as looks as if he does
not know what time it is, and furthermore he does not look as if he has a
quarter, but I can see by the way Hot Horse Herbie is warming his ear that
Herbie figures him to have a few potatoes.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I never know Hot Horse Herbie to make many bad guesses in this
respect, so I am not surprised when I see the guy pull out a long flat leather
from the inside pocket of his coat and weed Herbie a bank-note. Then I see
Herbie start for the mutuels windows, but I am quite astonished when I see that
he makes for a two-dollar window. So I follow Hot Horse Herbie to see what this
is all about, because it is certainly not like Herbie to dig up a guy with a
bank roll and then only promote him for a deuce.</p>

<p>When I get hold of Herbie and ask him what this means, he laughs, and says
to me like this:</p>

<p>'Well,' he says, 'I am just taking a chance with the guy. He may be a
prospect, at that,' Herbie says. 'You never can tell about people. This is the
first bet he ever makes in his life, and furthermore,' Herbie says, 'he does
not wish to bet. He says he knows one horse can beat another, and what of it?
But,' Herbie says, 'I give him a good story, so he finally goes for the deuce.
I think he is a college professor somewhere,' Herbie says, 'and he is only
wandering around the track out of curiosity. He does not know a soul here.
Well,' Herbie says, 'I put him on a real hot horse, and if he wins maybe he can
be developed into something. You know,' Herbie says, 'they can never rule you
off for trying.'</p>

<p>Well, it seems that the horse Herbie gives the guy wins all right and at a
fair price, and Herbie lets it go at that for the time being, because he gets
hold of a real good guy, and cannot be bothering with guys who only bet deuces.
But every day the professor is at the track and I often see him wandering
through the crowds, puffing at his old stinkaroo and looking somewhat
bewildered.</p>

<p>I get somewhat interested in the guy myself, because he seems so much out of
place, but I wish to say I never think of promoting him in any respect, because
this is by no means my dodge, and finally one day I get to talking to him and
he seems just as innocent as he looks. He is a professor at Princeton, which is
a college in New Jersey, and his name is Woodhead, and he has been very sick,
and is in Florida to get well, and he thinks the track mob is the greatest show
he ever sees, and is sorry he does not study this business a little earlier in
life.</p>

<p>Well, personally, I think he is a very nice guy, and he seems to have quite
some knowledge of this and that and one thing and another, although he is so
ignorant about racing that it is hard to believe he is a college guy.</p>

<p>Even if I am a hustler, I will just as soon try to hustle Santa Claus as
Professor Woodhead, but by and by Hot Horse Herbie finds things getting very
desperate indeed, so he picks up the professor again and starts working on him,
and one day he gets him to go for another deuce, and then for a fin, and both
times the horses Herbie gives him are winners, which Herbie says just goes to
show you the luck he is playing in, because when he has a guy who is willing to
make a bet for him, he cannot pick one to finish fifth.</p>

<p>You see, the idea is when Hot Horse Herbie gives a guy a horse he expects
the guy to bet for him, too, or maybe give him a piece of what he wins, but of
course Herbie does not mention this to Professor Woodhead as yet, because the
professor does not bet enough to bother with, and anyway Herbie is building him
up by degrees, although if you ask me, it is going to be slow work, and finally
Herbie himself admits as much, and says to me like this:</p>

<p>'It looks as if I will have to blast,' Herbie says. 'The professor is a nice
guy, but,' he says, 'he does not loosen so easy. Furthermore,' Herbie says, 'he
is very dumb about horses. In fact,' he says, 'I never see a guy so hard to
educate, and if I do not like him personally, I will have no part of him
whatever. And besides liking him personally,' Herbie says, 'I get a gander into
that leather he carries the other day, and what do I see,' he says, 'but some
large, coarse notes in there back to back.'</p>

<p>Well, of course this is very interesting news, even to me, because large,
coarse notes are so scarce in Miami at this time that if a guy runs into one he
takes it to a bank to see if it is counterfeit before he changes it, and even
then he will scarcely believe it.</p>

<p>I get to thinking that if a guy such as Professor Woodhead can be going
around with large, coarse notes in his possession, I make a serious mistake in
not becoming a college professor myself, and naturally after this I treat
Professor Woodhead with great respect.</p>

<p>Now what happens one evening, but Hot Horse Herbie and his ever-loving
fiancée, Miss Cutie Singleton, and me are in a little grease joint on Second
Street putting on the old hot tripe a la Creole, which is a very pleasant dish,
and by no means expensive, when who wanders in but Professor Woodhead.</p>

<p>Naturally Herbie calls him over to our table and introduces Professor
Woodhead to Miss Cutie Singleton, and Professor Woodhead sits there with us
looking at Miss Cutie Singleton with great interest, although Miss Cutie
Singleton is at this time feeling somewhat peevish because it is the fourth
evening hand running she has to eat tripe a la Creole, and Miss Cutie Singleton
does not care for tripe under any circumstances.</p>

<p>She does not pay any attention whatever to Professor Woodhead, but finally
Hot Horse Herbie happens to mention that the professor is from Princeton, and
then Miss Cutie Singleton looks at the professor, and says to him like
this:</p>

<p>'Where is this Princeton?' she says. 'Is it a little town?'</p>

<p>'Well,' Professor Woodhead says, 'Princeton is in New Jersey, and it is by
no means a large town, but,' he says, 'it is thriving.'</p>

<p>'Are there any little white houses in this town?' Miss Cutie Singleton asks.
'Are there any little white houses with green shutters and vines all around and
about?'</p>

<p>'Why,' Professor Woodhead says, looking at her with more interest than
somewhat, 'you are speaking of my own house,' he says. 'I live in a little
white house with green shutters and vines all around and about, and,' he says,
'it is a nice place to live in, at that, although it is sometimes a little
lonesome, as I live there all by myself, unless,' he says, 'you wish to count
old Mrs. Bixby, who keeps house for me. I am a bachelor,' he says.</p>

<p>Well, Miss Cutie Singleton does not have much to say after this, although it
is only fair to Miss Cutie Singleton to state that for a doll, and especially a
blonde doll, she is never so very gabby, at that, but she watches Professor
Woodhead rather closely, as Miss Cutie Singleton never before comes in contact
with anybody who lives in a little white house with green shutters.</p>

<p>Finally we get through with the hot tripe ala Creole and walk around to the
fleabag where Hot Horse Herbie and Miss Cutie Singleton and me are residing,
and Professor Woodhead walks around with us. In fact, Professor Woodhead walks
with Miss Cutie Singleton, while Hot Horse Herbie walks with me, and Hot Horse
Herbie is telling me that he has the very best thing of his entire life in the
final race at Hialeah the next day, and he is expressing great regret that he
does not have any potatoes to bet on this thing, and does not know where he can
get any potatoes.</p>

<p>It seems that he is speaking of a horse by the name of Breezing Along, which
is owned by a guy by the name of Moose Tassell, who is a citizen of Chicago,
and who tells Hot Horse Herbie that the only way Breezing Along can lose the
race is to have somebody shoot him at the quarter pole, and of course nobody is
shooting horses at the quarter pole at Hialeah, though many citizens often feel
like shooting horses at the half.</p>

<p>Well, by this time we get to our fleabag, and we all stand there talking
when Professor Woodhead speaks as follows: 'Miss Cutie Singleton informs me,'
he says, 'that she dabbles somewhat in fortune telling. Well,' Professor
Woodhead says, 'this is most interesting to me, because I am by no means
sceptical of fortune telling. In fact,' he says, 'I make something of a study
of the matter, and there is no doubt in my mind that certain human beings do
have the faculty of foretelling future events with remarkable accuracy.'</p>

<p>Now I wish to say one thing for Hot Horse Herbie, and this is that he is a
quick-thinking guy when you put him up against a situation that calls for quick
thinking, for right away he speaks up and says like this:</p>

<p>'Why, Professor,' he says, 'I am certainly glad to hear you make this
statement, because,' he says, 'I am a believer in fortune telling myself. As a
matter of fact, I am just figuring on having Miss Cutie Singleton look into her
crystal ball and see if she can make out anything on a race that is coming up
to-morrow, and which has me greatly puzzled, what with being undecided between
a couple of horses.'</p>

<p>Well, of course, up to this time Miss Cutie Singleton does not have any idea
she is to look into any crystal ball for a horse, and furthermore, it is the
first time in his life Hot Horse Herbie ever asks her to look into the crystal
ball for anything whatever, except to make a few bobs for them to eat on,
because Herbie by no means believes in matters of this nature.</p>

<p>But naturally Miss Cutie Singleton is not going to display any astonishment,
and when she says she will be very glad to oblige, Professor Woodhead speaks up
and says he will be glad to see this crystal gazing come off, which makes it
perfect for Hot Horse Herbie.</p>

<p>So we all go upstairs to Miss Cutie Singleton's room, and the next thing
anybody knows there she is with her crystal ball, gazing into it with both
eyes.</p>

<p>Now Professor Woodhead is taking a deep interest in the proceedings, but of
course Professor Woodhead does not hear what Hot Horse Herbie tells Miss Cutie
Singleton in private, and as far as this is concerned neither do I, but Herbie
tells me afterwards that he tells her to be sure and see a breeze blowing in
the crystal ball. So by and by, after gazing into the ball a long rime, Miss
Cutie Singleton speaks in a low voice as follows:</p>

<p>'I seem to see trees bending to the ground under the force of a great wind,'
Miss Cutie Singleton says. 'I see houses blown about by the wind,' she says.
'Yes,' Miss Cutie Singleton says, 'I see pedestrians struggling along and
shivering in the face of this wind, and I see waves driven high on a beach and
boats tossed about like paper cups. In fact,' Miss Singleton says, 'I seem to
see quite a blow.'</p>

<p>Well, then, it seems that Miss Cutie Singleton can see no more, but Hot
Horse Herbie is greatly excited by what she sees already, and he says like
this:</p>

<p>'It means this horse Breezing Along,' he says. 'There can be no doubt about
it. Professor,' he says, 'here is the chance of your lifetime. The horse will
be not less than six to one,' he says. 'This is the spot to bet a gob, and,' he
says, 'the place to bet it is downtown with a bookmaker at the opening price,
because there will be a ton of money for the horse in the machines. Give me
five C's,' Hot Horse Herbie says, 'and I will bet four for you, and one for
me.'</p>

<p>Well, Professor Woodhead seems greatly impressed by what Miss Cutie
Singleton sees in the crystal ball, but of course taking a guy from a finnif to
five C's is carrying him along too fast, especially when Herbie explains that
five C's is five hundred dollars, and naturally the professor does not care to
bet any such money as this. In fact, the professor does not seem anxious to bet
more than a sawbuck, tops, but Herbie finally moves him up to bet a yard, and
of this yard twenty-five bobs is running for Hot Horse Herbie, as Herbie
explains to the professor that a remittance he is expecting from his New York
bankers fails him.</p>

<p>The next day Herbie takes the hundred bucks and bets it with Gloomy Gus
downtown, for Herbie really has great confidence in the horse.</p>

<p>We are out to the track early in the afternoon and the first guy we run into
is Professor Woodhead, who is very much excited. We speak to him, and then we
do not see him again all day.</p>

<p>Well, I am not going to bother telling you the details of the race, but this
horse Breezing Along is nowhere. In fact, he is so far back that I do not
recollect seeing him finish, because by the time the third horse in the field
crosses the line, Hot Horse Herbie and me are on our way back to town, as
Herbie does not feel that he can face Professor Woodhead at such a time as
this. In fact, Herbie does not feel that he can face anybody, so we go to a
certain spot over on Miami Beach and remain there drinking beer until a late
hour, when Herbie happens to think of his ever-loving fiancée, Miss Cutie
Singleton, and how she must be suffering from lack of food, so we return to our
fleabag so Herbie can take Miss Cutie Singleton to dinner.</p>

<p>But he does not find Miss Cutie Singleton. All he finds from her is a note,
and in this note Miss Cutie Singleton says like this: 'Dear Herbie,' she says,
'I do not believe in long engagements any more, so Professor Woodhead and I are
going to Palm Beach to be married to-night, and are leaving for Princeton, New
Jersey, at once, where I am going to live in a little white house with green
shutters and vines all around and about. Good-bye, Herbie,' the note says. 'Do
not eat any bad fish. Respectfully, Mrs. Professor Woodhead.'</p>

<p>Well, naturally this is most surprising to Hot Horse Herbie, but I never
hear him mention Miss Cutie Singleton or Professor Woodhead again until a
couple of weeks later when he shows me a letter from the professor.</p>

<p>It is quite a long letter, and it seems that Professor Woodhead wishes to
apologize, and naturally Herbie has a right to think that the professor is
going to apologize for marrying his ever-loving fiancée, Miss Cutie Singleton,
as Herbie feels he has an apology coming on this account.</p>

<p>But what the professor seems to be apologising about is not being able to
find Hot Horse Herbie just before the Breezing Along race to explain a certain
matter that is on his mind.</p>

<p>'It does not seem to me,' the professor says, as near as I can remember the
letter, 'that the name of your selection is wholly adequate as a description of
the present Mrs. Professor Woodhead's wonderful vision in the crystal ball,
so,' he says, 'I examine the programme further, and finally discover what I
believe to be the name of the horse meant by the vision, and I wager two
hundred dollars on this horse, which turns out to be the winner at ten to one,
as you may recall. It is in my mind,' the professor says, 'to send you some
share of the proceeds, inasmuch as we are partners in the original arrangement,
but the present Mrs. Woodhead disagrees with my view, so all I can send you is
an apology, and best wishes.'</p>

<p>Well, Hot Horse Herbie cannot possibly remember the name of the winner of
any race as far back as this, and neither can I, but we go over to the Herald
office and look at the files, and what is the name of the winner of the
Breezing Along race but Mistral, and when I look in the dictionary to see what
this word means, what does it mean but a violent, cold and dry northerly
wind.</p>

<p>And of course I never mention to Hot Horse Herbie or anybody else that I am
betting on another horse in this race myself, and the name of the horse I am
betting on is Leg Show, for how do I know for certain that Miss Cutie Singleton
is not really seeing in the crystal ball just such a blow as she describes?</p>

<h3><a name="Undertaker_Song" id="Undertaker_Song">Undertaker Song</a></h3>
<p>Now this story I am going to tell you is about the game of football, a very
healthy pastime for the young, and a great character builder from all I hear,
but to get around to this game of football I am compelled to bring in some most
obnoxious characters, beginning with a guy by the name of Joey Perhaps, and all
I can conscientiously say about Joey is you can have him.</p>

<p>It is a matter of maybe four years since I see this Joey Perhaps until I
notice him on a train going to Boston, Mass., one Friday afternoon. He is
sitting across from me in the dining-car, where I am enjoying a small portion
of baked beans and brown bread, and he looks over to me once, but he does not
rap to me.</p>

<p>There is no doubt but what Joey Perhaps is bad company, because the last I
hear of him he is hollering copper on a guy by the name of Jack Ortega, and as
a result of Joey Perhaps hollering copper, this Jack Ortega is taken to the
city of Ossining, N.Y., and placed in an electric chair, and given a very,
very, very severe shock in the seat of his pants.</p>

<p>It is something about plugging a most legitimate business guy in the city of
Rochester, N.Y., when Joey Perhaps and Jack Ortega are engaged together in a
little enterprise to shake the guy down, but the details of this transaction
are dull, sordid, and quite uninteresting, except that Joey Perhaps turns
state's evidence and announces that Jack Ortega fires the shot which cools the
legitimate guy off, for which service he is rewarded with only a small
stretch.</p>

<p>I must say for Joey Perhaps that he looks good, and he is very well dressed,
but then Joey is always particular about clothes, and he is quite a handy guy
with the dolls in his day and, to tell the truth, many citizens along Broadway
are by no means displeased when Joey is placed in the state institution,
because they are generally pretty uneasy about their dolls when he is
around.</p>

<p>Naturally, I am wondering why Joey Perhaps is on this train going to Boston,
Mass., but for all I know maybe he is wondering the same thing about me,
although personally I am making no secret about it. The idea is I am en route
to Boston, Mass., to see a contest of skill and science that is to take place
there this very Friday night between a party by the name of Lefty Ledoux and
another party by the name of Pile Driver, who are very prominent
middleweights.</p>

<p>Now ordinarily I will not go around the corner to see a contest of skill and
science between Lefty Ledoux and Pile Driver, or anybody else, as far as that
is concerned, unless they are using blackjacks and promise to hurt each other,
but I am the guest on this trip of a party by the name of Meyer Marmalade, and
I will go anywhere to see anything if I am a guest.</p>

<p>This Meyer Marmalade is really a most superior character, who is called
Meyer Marmalade because nobody can ever think of his last name, which is
something like Marmalodowski, and he is known far and wide for the way he likes
to make bets on any sporting proposition, such as baseball, or horse races, or
ice hockey, or contests of skill and science, and especially contests of skill
and science.</p>

<p>So he wishes to be present at this contest in Boston, Mass., between Lefty
Ledoux and Pile Driver to have a nice wager on Driver, as he has reliable
information that Driver's manager, a party by the name of Koons, has both
judges and the referee in the satchel.</p>

<p>If there is one thing Meyer Marmalade dearly loves, it is to have a bet on a
contest of skill and science of this nature, and so he is going to Boston,
Mass. But Meyer Marmalade is such a guy as loathes and despises travelling all
alone, so when he offers to pay my expenses if I will go along to keep him
company, naturally I am pleased to accept, as I have nothing on of importance
at the moment and, in fact, I do not have anything on of importance for the
past ten years.</p>

<p>I warn Meyer Marmalade in advance that if he is looking to take anything off
of anybody in Boston, Mass., he may as well remain at home, because everybody
knows that statistics show that the percentage of anything being taken off of
the citizens of Boston, Mass., is less per capita than anywhere else in the
United States, especially when it comes to contests of skill and science, but
Meyer Marmalade says this is the first time they ever had two judges and a
referee running against the statistics, and he is very confident.</p>

<p>Well, by and by I go from the dining-car back to my seat in another car,
where Meyer Marmalade is sitting reading a detective magazine, and I speak of
seeing Joey Perhaps to him. But Meyer Marmalade does not seem greatly
interested, although he says to me like this:</p>

<p>'Joey Perhaps, eh?' he says. 'A wrong gee. A dead wrong gee. He must just
get out. I run into the late Jack Ortega's brother, young Ollie, in Mindy's
restaurant last week,' Meyer Marmalade says, 'and when we happen to get to
talking of wrong gees, naturally Joey Perhaps's name comes up, and Ollie
remarks he understands Joey Perhaps is about due out, and that he will be
pleased to see him some day. Personally,' Meyer Marmalade says, 'I do not care
for any part of Joey Perhaps at any price.'</p>

<p>Now our car is loaded with guys and dolls who are going to Boston, Mass., to
witness a large football game between the Harvards and the Yales at Cambridge,
Mass., the next day, and the reason I know this is because they are talking of
nothing else.</p>

<p>So this is where the football starts getting into this story.</p>

<p>One old guy that I figure must be a Harvard from the way he talks seems to
have a party all his own, and he is getting so much attention from one and all
in the party that I figure he must be a guy of some importance, because they
laugh heartily at his remarks, and although I listen very carefully to
everything he says he does not sound so very humorous to me.</p>

<p>He is a heavy-set guy with a bald head and a deep voice, and anybody can see
that he is such a guy as is accustomed to plenty of authority. I am wondering
out loud to Meyer Marmalade who the guy can be, and Meyer Marmalade states as
follows:</p>

<p>'Why,' he says, 'he is nobody but Mr. Phillips Randolph, who makes the
automobiles. He is the sixth richest guy in this country,' Meyer says, 'or
maybe it is the seventh. Anyway, he is pretty well up with the front runners. I
spot his monicker on his suitcase, and then I ask the porter, to make sure. It
is a great honour for us to be travelling with Mr. Phillips Randolph,' Meyer
says, 'because of him being such a public benefactor and having so much dough,
especially having so much dough.'</p>

<p>Well, naturally everybody knows who Mr. Phillips Randolph is, and I am
surprised that I do not recognize his face myself from seeing it so often in
the newspapers alongside the latest model automobile his factory turns out, and
I am as much pleasured up as Meyer Marmalade over being in the same car with
Mr. Phillips Randolph.</p>

<p>He seems to be a good-natured old guy, at that, and he is having a grand
time, what with talking, and laughing, and taking a dram now and then out of a
bottle, and when old Crip McGonnigle comes gimping through the car selling his
football souvenirs, such as red and blue feathers, and little badges and
pennants, and one thing and another, as Crip is doing around the large football
games since Hickory Slim is a two-year-old, Mr. Phillips Randolph stops him and
buys all of Crip's red feathers, which have a little white H on them to show
they are for the Harvards.</p>

<p>Then Mr. Phillips Randolph distributes the feathers around among his party,
and the guys and dolls stick them in their hats, or pin them on their coats,
but he has quite a number of feathers left over, and about this time who comes
through the car but Joey Perhaps, and Mr. Phillips Randolph steps out in the
aisle and stops Joey and politely offers him a red feather, and speaks as
follows:</p>

<p>'Will you honour us by wearing our colours?'</p>

<p>Well, of course Mr. Phillips Randolph is only full of good spirits, and
means no harm whatever, and the guys and dolls in his party laugh heartily as
if they consider his action very funny, but maybe because they laugh, and maybe
because he is just naturally a hostile guy, Joey Perhaps knocks Mr. Phillips
Randolph's hand down, and says like this:</p>

<p>'Get out of my way,' Joey says. 'Are you trying to make a sucker out of
somebody?'</p>

<p>Personally, I always claim that Joey Perhaps has a right to reject the red
feather, because for all I know he may prefer a blue feather, which means the
Yales, but what I say is he does not need to be so impolite to an old guy such
as Mr. Phillips Randolph, although of course Joey has no way of knowing at this
time about Mr. Phillips Randolph having so much dough.</p>

<p>Anyway, Mr. Phillips Randolph stands staring at Joey as if he is greatly
startled, and the chances are he is, at that, for the chances are nobody ever
speaks to him in such a manner in all his life, and Joey Perhaps also stands
there a minute staring back at Mr. Phillips Randolph, and finally Joey speaks
as follows:</p>

<p>'Take a good peek,' Joey Perhaps says. 'Maybe you will remember me if you
ever see me again.'</p>

<p>'Yes,' Mr. Phillips Randolph says, very quiet. 'Maybe I will. They say I
have a good memory for faces. I beg your pardon for stopping you, sir. It is
all in fun, but I am sorry,' he says.</p>

<p>Then Joey Perhaps goes on, and he does not seem to notice Meyer Marmalade
and me sitting there in the car, and Mr. Phillips Randolph sits down, and his
face is redder than somewhat, and all the joy is gone out of him, and out of
his party, too. Personally, I am very sorry Joey Perhaps comes along, because I
figure Mr. Phillips Randolph will give me one of his spare feathers, and I will
consider it a wonderful keepsake.</p>

<p>But now there is not much more talking, and no laughing whatever in Mr.
Phillips Randolph's party, and he just sits there as if he is thinking, and for
all I know he may be thinking that there ought to be a law against a guy
speaking so disrespectfully to a guy with all his dough as Joey Perhaps speaks
to him.</p>

<p>Well, the contest of skill and science between Lefty Ledoux and Pile Driver
turns out to be something of a disappointment, and, in fact, it is a stinkeroo,
because there is little skill and no science whatever in it, and by the fourth
round the customers are scuffling their feet, and saying throw these bums out,
and making other derogatory remarks, and furthermore it seems that this Koons
does not have either one of the judges, or even as much as the referee, in the
satchel, and Ledoux gets the duke by unanimous vote of the officials.</p>

<p>So Meyer Marmalade is out a couple of C's, which is all he can wager at the
ringside, because it seems that nobody in Boston, Mass., cares a cuss about who
wins the contest, and Meyer is much disgusted with life, and so am I, and we go
back to the Copley Plaza Hotel, where we are stopping, and sit down in the
lobby to meditate on the injustice of everything.</p>

<p>Well, the lobby is a scene of gaiety, as it seems there are a number of
football dinners and dances going on in the hotel, and guys and dolls in
evening clothes are all around and about, and the dolls are so young and
beautiful that I get to thinking that this is not such a bad old world, after
all, and even Meyer Marmalade begins taking notice.</p>

<p>All of a sudden, a very, very beautiful young doll who is about forty per
cent. in and sixty per cent. out of an evening gown walks right up to us
sitting there, and holds out her hand to me, and speaks as follows:</p>

<p>'Do you remember me?'</p>

<p>Naturally, I do not remember her, but naturally I am not going to admit it,
because it is never my policy to discourage any doll who wishes to strike up an
acquaintance with me, which is what I figure this doll is trying to do; then I
see that she is nobody but Doria Logan, one of the prettiest dolls that ever
hits Broadway, and about the same time Meyer Marmalade also recognizes her.</p>

<p>Doria changes no little since last I see her, which is quite some time back,
but there is no doubt the change is for the better, because she is once a very
rattle-headed young doll, and now she seems older, and quieter, and even
prettier than ever. Naturally, Meyer Marmalade and I are glad to see her
looking so well, and we ask her how are tricks, and what is the good word, and
all this and that, and finally Doria Logan states to us as follows:</p>

<p>'I am in great trouble,' Doria says. 'I am in terrible trouble, and you are
the first ones I see that I can talk to about it.'</p>

<p>Well, at this, Meyer Marmalade begins to tuck in somewhat, because he
figures it is the old lug coming up, and Meyer Marmalade is not such a guy as
will go for the lug from a doll unless he gets something more than a story. But
I can see Doria Logan is in great earnest.</p>

<p>'Do you remember Joey Perhaps?' she says.</p>

<p>'A wrong gee,' Meyer Marmalade says. 'A dead wrong gee.'</p>

<p>'I not only remember Joey Perhaps,' I say, 'but I see him on the train
to-day.'</p>

<p>'Yes,' Doria says, 'he is here in town. He hunts me up only a few hours ago.
He is here to do me great harm. He is here to finish ruining my life.'</p>

<p>'A wrong gee,' Meyer Marmalade puts in again. 'Always a hundred per cent.
wrong gee.' Then Doria Logan gets us to go with her to a quiet corner of the
lobby, and she tells us a strange story, as follows, and also to wit:</p>

<p>It seems that she is once tangled up with Joey Perhaps, which is something I
never know before, and neither does Meyer Marmalade, and, in fact, the news
shocks us quite some. It is back in the days when she is just about sixteen and
is in the chorus of Earl Carroll's Vanities, and I remember well what a
stand-out she is for looks, to be sure.</p>

<p>Naturally, at sixteen, Doria is quite a chump doll, and does not know which
way is south, or what time it is, which is the way all dolls at sixteen are
bound to be, and she has no idea what a wrong gee Joey Perhaps is, as he is
good-looking, and young, and seems very romantic, and is always speaking of
love and one thing and another.</p>

<p>Well, the upshot of it all is the upshot of thousands of other cases since
chump dolls commence coming to Broadway, and the first thing she knows, Doria
Logan finds herself mixed up with a very bad character, and does not know what
to do about it.</p>

<p>By and by, Joey Perhaps commences mistreating her no little, and finally he
tries to use her in some nefarious schemes of his, and of course everybody
along Broadway knows that most of Joey's schemes are especially nefarious,
because Joey is on the shake almost since infancy.</p>

<p>Well, one day Doria says to herself that if this is love, she has all she
can stand, and she hauls off and runs away from Joey Perhaps. She goes back to
her people, who live in the city of Cambridge, Mass., which is the same place
where the Harvards have their college, and she goes there because she does not
know of any other place to go.</p>

<p>It seems that Doria's people are poor, and Doria goes to a business school
and learns to be a stenographer, and she is working for a guy in the real
estate dodge by the name of Poopnoodle, and doing all right for herself, and in
the meantime she hears that Joey Perhaps gets sent away, so she figures her
troubles are all over as far as he is concerned.</p>

<p>Now Doria Logan goes along quietly through life, working for Mr. Poopnoodle,
and never thinking of love, or anything of a similar nature, when she meets up
with a young guy who is one of the Harvards, and who is maybe twenty-one years
old, and is quite a football player, and where Doria meets up with this guy is
in a drug store over a banana split.</p>

<p>Well, the young Harvard takes quite a fancy to Doria and, in fact, he is
practically on fire about her, but by this time Doria is going on twenty, and
is no longer a chump doll, and she has no wish to get tangled up in love
again.</p>

<p>In fact, whenever she thinks of Joey Perhaps, Doria takes to hating guys in
general, but somehow she cannot seem to get up a real good hate on the young
Harvard, because, to hear her tell it, he is handsome, and noble, and has
wonderful ideals.</p>

<p>Now as time goes on, Doria finds she is growing pale, and is losing her
appetite, and cannot sleep, and this worries her no little, as she is always a
first-class feeder, and finally she comes to the conclusion that what ails her
is that she is in love with the young Harvard, and can scarcely live without
him, so she admits as much to him one night when the moon is shining on the
Charles River, and everything is a dead cold set-up for love.</p>

<p>Well, naturally, after a little off-hand guzzling, which is quite
permissible under the circumstances, the young guy wishes her to name the happy
day, and Doria has half a notion to make it the following Monday, this being a
Sunday night, but then she gets to thinking about her past with Joey Perhaps,
and all, and she figures it will be bilking the young Harvard to marry him
unless she has a small talk with him first about Joey, because she is well
aware that many young guys may have some objection to wedding a doll with a
skeleton in her closet, and especially a skeleton such as Joey Perhaps.</p>

<p>But she is so happy she does not wish to run the chance of spoiling
everything by these narrations right away, so she keeps her trap closed about
Joey, although she promises to marry the young Harvard when he gets out of
college, which will be the following year, if he still insists, because Doria
figures that by then she will be able to break the news to him about Joey very
gradually, and gently, and especially gently.</p>

<p>Anyway, Doria says she is bound and determined to tell him before the
wedding, even if he takes the wind on her as a consequence, and personally I
claim this is very considerate of Doria, because many dolls never tell before
the wedding, or even after. So Doria and the young Harvard are engaged, and
great happiness prevails, when, all of a sudden, in pops Joey Perhaps.</p>

<p>It seems that Joey learns of Doria's engagement as soon as he gets out of
the state institution, and he hastens to Boston, Mass., with an inside coat
pocket packed with letters that Doria writes him long ago, and also a lot of
pictures they have taken together, as young guys and dolls are bound to do, and
while there is nothing much out of line about these letters and pictures, put
them all together they spell a terrible pain in the neck to Doria at this
particular time.</p>

<p>'A wrong gee,' Meyer Marmalade says. 'But,' he says, 'he is only going back
to his old shakedown dodge, so all you have to do is to buy him off.'</p>

<p>Well, at this, Doria Logan laughs one of these little short dry laughs that
go 'hah,' and says like this:</p>

<p>'Of course he is looking to get bought off, but,' she says, 'where will I
get any money to buy him off? I do not have a dime of my own, and Joey is
talking large figures, because he knows my fiancée's papa has plenty. He wishes
me to go to my fiancée and make him get the money off his papa, or he threatens
to personally deliver the letters and pictures to my fiancée's papa.</p>

<p>'You can see the predicament I am in,' Doria says, 'and you can see what my
fiancée's papa will think of me if he learns I am once mixed up with a
blackmailer such as Joey Perhaps.</p>

<p>'Besides,' Doria says, 'it is something besides money with Joey Perhaps, and
I am not so sure he will not double-cross me even if I can pay him his price.
Joey Perhaps is very angry at me. I think,' she says, 'if he can spoil my
happiness, it will mean more to him than money.'</p>

<p>Well, Doria states that all she can think of when she is talking to Joey
Perhaps is to stall for time, and she tells Joey that, no matter what, she
cannot see her fiancée until after the large football game between the Harvards
and the Yales as he has to do a little football playing for the Harvards, and
Joey asks her if she is going to see the game, and naturally she is.</p>

<p>And then Joey says he thinks he will look up a ticket speculator, and buy a
ticket and attend the game himself, as he is very fond of football, and where
will she be sitting, as he hopes and trusts he will be able to see something of
her during the game, and this statement alarms Doria Logan no little, for who
is she going with but her fiancée's papa, and a party of his friends, and she
feels that there is no telling what Joey Perhaps may be up to.</p>

<p>She explains to Joey that she does not know exactly where she will be
sitting, except that it will be on the Harvards' side of the field, but Joey is
anxious for more details than this.</p>

<p>'In fact,' Doria says, 'he is most insistent, and he stands at my elbow
while I call up Mr. Randolph at this very hotel, and he tells me the exact
location of our seats. Then Joey says he will endeavour to get a seat as close
to me as possible, and he goes away.'</p>

<p>'What Mr. Randolph?' Meyer says. 'Which Mr. Randolph?' he says. 'You do not
mean Mr. Phillips Randolph, by any chance, do you?'</p>

<p>'Why, to be sure,' Doria says. 'Do you know him?'</p>

<p>Naturally, from now on Meyer Marmalade gazes at Doria Logan with deep
respect, and so do I, although by now she is crying a little, and I am by no
means in favour of crying dolls. But while she is crying, Meyer Marmalade seems
to be doing some more thinking, and finally he speaks as follows: 'Kindly see
if you can recall these locations you speak of.'</p>

<p>So here is where the football game comes in once more. Only I regret to
state that personally I do not witness this game, and the reason I do not
witness it is because nobody wakes me up the next day in time for me to witness
it, and the way I look at it, this is all for the best, as I am scarcely a
football enthusiast. So from now on the story belongs to Meyer Marmalade, and I
will tell it to you as Meyer tells it to me.</p>

<p>It is a most exciting game [Meyer says]. The place is full of people, and
there are bands playing, and much cheering, and more lovely dolls than you can
shake a stick at, although I do not believe there are any lovelier present than
Doria Logan.</p>

<p>It is a good thing she remembers the seat locations, otherwise I will never
find her, but there she is surrounded by some very nice-looking people,
including Mr. Phillips Randolph, and there I am two rows back of Mr. Phillips
Randolph, and the ticket spec I get my seat off of says he cannot understand
why everybody wishes to sit near Mr. Phillips Randolph to-day when there are
other seats just as good, and maybe better, on the Harvards' side.</p>

<p>So I judge he has other calls similar to mine for this location, and a sweet
price he gets for it, too, and I judge that maybe at least one call is from
Joey Perhaps, as I see Joey a couple of rows on back up of where I am sitting,
but off to my left on an aisle, while I am almost in a direct line with Mr.
Phillips Randolph.</p>

<p>To show you that Joey is such a guy as attracts attention, Mr. Phillips
Randolph stands up a few minutes before the game starts, peering around and
about to see who is present that he knows, and all of a sudden his eyes fall on
Joey Perhaps, and then Mr. Phillips Randolph proves he has a good memory for
faces, to be sure, for he states as follows:</p>

<p>'Why,' he says, 'there is the chap who rebuffs me so churlishly on the train
when I offer him our colours. Yes,' he says, 'I am sure it is the same
chap.'</p>

<p>Well, what happens in the football game is much pulling and hauling this way
and that, and to and fro, between the Harvards and the Yales without a tally
right down to the last five minutes of play, and then all of a sudden the Yales
shove the football down to within about three-eighths of an inch of the
Harvards' goal line.</p>

<p>At this moment quite some excitement prevails. Then the next thing anybody
knows, the Yales out-shove the Harvards, and now the game is over, and Mr.
Phillips Randolph gets up out of his seat, and I hear Mr. Phillips Randolph say
like this:</p>

<p>'Well,' he says, 'the score is not so bad as it might be, and it is a
wonderful game, and,' he says, 'we seem to make one convert to our cause,
anyway, for see who is wearing our colours.'</p>

<p>And with this he points to Joey Perhaps, who is still sitting down, with
people stepping around him and over him, and he is still smiling a little
smile, and Mr. Phillips Randolph seems greatly pleased to see that Joey Perhaps
has a big, broad crimson ribbon where he once wears his white silk muffler.</p>

<p>But the chances are Mr. Phillips Randolph will be greatly surprised if he
knows that the crimson ribbon across Joey's bosom comes of Ollie Ortega
planting a short knife in Joey's throat, or do I forget to mention before that
Ollie Ortega is among those present?</p>

<p>I send for Ollie after I leave you last night, figuring he may love to see a
nice football game. He arrives by 'plane this morning, and I am not wrong in my
figuring. Ollie thinks the game is swell.</p>

<p>Well, personally, I will never forget this game, it is so exciting. Just
after the tally comes off, all of a sudden, from the Yales in the stand across
the field from the Harvards, comes a long-drawn-out wail that sounds so
mournful it makes me feel very sad, to be sure. It starts off something like
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, with all the Yales Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-ing at once, and I ask a guy
next to me what it is all about.</p>

<p>'Why,' the guy says, 'it is the Yales' "Undertaker Song." They always sing
it when they have the other guy licked. I am an old Yale myself, and I will now
personally sing this song for you.'</p>

<p>And with this the guy throws back his head, and opens his mouth wide and
lets out a yowl like a wolf calling to its mate.</p>

<p>Well, I stop the guy, and tell him it is a very lovely song, to be sure, and
quite appropriate all the way around, and then I hasten away from the football
game without getting a chance to say goodbye to Doria, although afterwards I
mail her the package of letters and pictures that Ollie gets out of Joey
Perhaps's inside coat pocket during the confusion that prevails when the Yales
make their tally, and I hope and trust that she will think the crimson streaks
across the package are just a little touch of colour in honour of the
Harvards.</p>

<p>But the greatest thing about the football game [Meyer Marmalade says] is I
win two C's off of one of the Harvards sitting near me, so I am now practically
even on my trip.</p>

<h3><a name="Butch_Minds_the_Baby" id="Butch_Minds_the_Baby">Butch Minds the Baby</a></h3>
<p>One evening along about seven o'clock I am sitting in Mindy's restaurant
putting on the gefüllte fish, which is a dish I am very fond of, when in come
three parties from Brooklyn wearing caps as follows: Harry the Horse, Little
Isadore, and Spanish John.</p>

<p>Now these parties are not such parties as I will care to have much truck
with, because I often hear rumours about them that are very discreditable, even
if the rumours are not true. In fact, I hear that many citizens of Brooklyn
will be very glad indeed to see Harry the Horse, Little Isadore and Spanish
John move away from there, as they are always doing something that is
considered a knock to the community, such as robbing people, or maybe shooting
or stabbing them, and throwing pineapples, and carrying on generally.</p>

<p>I am really much surprised to see these parties on Broadway, as it is well
known that the Broadway coppers just naturally love to shove such parties
around, but there they are in Mindy's, and there I am, so of course I give them
a very large hello, as I never wish to seem inhospitable, even to Brooklyn
parties. Right away they come over to my table and sit down, and Little Isadore
reaches out and spears himself a big hunk of my gefüllte fish with his fingers,
but I overlook this, as I am using the only knife on the table.</p>

<p>Then they all sit there looking at me without saying anything, and the way
they look at me makes me very nervous indeed. Finally I figure that maybe they
are a little embarrassed being in a high-class spot such as Mindy's, with
legitimate people around and about, so I say to them, very polite:</p>

<p>'It is a nice night.'</p>

<p>'What is nice about it?' asks Harry the Horse, who is a thin man with a
sharp face and sharp eyes.</p>

<p>Well, now that it is put up to me in this way, I can see there is nothing so
nice about the night, at that, so I try to think of something else jolly to
say, while Little Isadore keeps spearing at my gefüllte fish with his fingers,
and Spanish John nabs one of my potatoes.</p>

<p>'Where does Big Butch live?' Harry the Horse asks.</p>

<p>'Big Butch?' I say, as if I never hear the name before in my life, because
in this man's town it is never a good idea to answer any question without
thinking it over, as some time you may give the right answer to the wrong guy,
or the wrong answer to the right guy. 'Where does Big Butch live?' I ask them
again.</p>

<p>'Yes, where does he live?' Harry the Horse says, very impatient. 'We wish
you to take us to him.'</p>

<p>'Now wait a minute, Harry,' I say, and I am now more nervous than somewhat.
'I am not sure I remember the exact house Big Butch lives in, and furthermore I
am not sure Big Butch will care to have me bringing people to see him,
especially three at a time, and especially from Brooklyn. You know Big Butch
has a very bad disposition, and there is no telling what he may say to me if he
does not like the idea of me taking you to him.'</p>

<p>'Everything is very kosher,' Harry the Horse says. 'You need not be afraid
of anything whatever. We have a business proposition for Big Butch. It means a
nice score for him, so you take us to him at once, or the chances are I will
have to put the arm on somebody around here.'</p>

<p>Well, as the only one around there for him to put the arm on at this time
seems to be me, I can see where it will be good policy for me to take these
parties to Big Butch especially as the last of my gefüllte fish is just going
down Little Isadore's gullet, and Spanish John is finishing up my potatoes, and
is donking a piece of rye bread in my coffee, so there is nothing more for me
to eat.</p>

<p>So I lead them over into West Forty-ninth Street, near Tenth Avenue, where
Big Butch lives on the ground floor of an old brownstone-front house, and who
is sitting out on the stoop but Big Butch himself. In fact, everybody in the
neighbourhood is sitting out on the front stoops over there, including women
and children, because sitting out on the front stoops is quite a custom in this
section.</p>

<p>Big Butch is peeled down to his undershirt and pants, and he has no shoes on
his feet, as Big Butch is a guy who loves his comfort. Furthermore, he is
smoking a cigar, and laid out on the stoop beside him on a blanket is a little
baby with not much clothes on. This baby seems to be asleep, and every now and
then Big Butch fans it with a folded newspaper to shoo away the mosquitoes that
wish to nibble on the baby. These mosquitoes come across the river from the
Jersey side on hot nights and they seem to be very fond of babies.</p>

<p>'Hello, Butch,' I say, as we stop in front of the stoop.</p>

<p>'Sh-h-h-h!' Butch says, pointing at the baby, and making more noise with his
shush than an engine blowing off steam. Then he gets up and tiptoes down to the
sidewalk where we are standing, and I am hoping that Butch feels all right,
because when Butch does not feel so good he is apt to be very short with one
and all. He is a guy of maybe six foot two and a couple of feet wide, and he
has big hairy hands and a mean look.</p>

<p>In fact, Big Butch is known all over this man's town as a guy you must not
monkey with in any respect, so it takes plenty of weight off me when I see that
he seems to know the parties from Brooklyn, and nods at them very friendly,
especially at Harry the Horse. And right away Harry states a most surprising
proposition to Big Butch.</p>

<p>It seems that there is a big coal company which has an office in an old
building down in West Eighteenth Street, and in this office is a safe, and in
this safe is the company pay roll of twenty thousand dollars cash money. Harry
the Horse knows the money is there because a personal friend of his who is the
paymaster for the company puts it there late this very afternoon.</p>

<p>It seems that the paymaster enters into a dicker with Harry the Horse and
Little Isadore and Spanish John for them to slug him while he is carrying the
pay roll from the bank to the office in the afternoon, but something happens
that they miss connections on the exact spot, so the paymaster has to carry the
sugar on to the office without being slugged, and there it is now in two fat
bundles.</p>

<p>Personally it seems to me as I listen to Harry's story that the paymaster
must be a very dishonest character to be making deals to hold still while he is
being slugged and the company's sugar taken away from him, but of course it is
none of my business, so I take no part in the conversation.</p>

<p>Well, it seems that Harry the Horse and Little Isadore and Spanish John wish
to get the money out of the safe, but none of them knows anything about opening
safes, and while they are standing around over in Brooklyn talking over what is
to be done in this emergency Harry suddenly remembers that Big Butch is once in
the business of opening safes for a living.</p>

<p>In fact, I hear afterwards that Big Butch is considered the best safe-opener
east of the Mississippi River in his day, but the law finally takes to sending
him to Sing Sing for opening these safes, and after he is in and out of Sing
Sing three different times for opening safes Butch gets sick and tired of the
place especially as they pass what is called the Baumes Law in New York, which
is a law that says if a guy is sent to Sing Sing four times hand running, he
must stay there the rest of his life, without any argument about it.</p>

<p>So Big Butch gives up opening safes for a living, and goes into business in
a small way, such as running beer, and handling a little Scotch now and then,
and becomes an honest citizen. Furthermore, he marries one of the neighbours'
children over on the West Side by the name of Mary Murphy, and I judge the baby
on this stoop comes of this marriage between Big Butch and Mary because I can
see that it is a very homely baby, indeed. Still, I never see many babies that
I consider rose geraniums for looks, anyway.</p>

<p>Well, it finally comes out that the idea of Harry the Horse and Little
Isadore and Spanish John is to get Big Butch to open the coal company's safe
and take the pay-roll money out, and they are willing to give him fifty per
cent. of the money for his bother, taking fifty per cent. for themselves for
finding the plant, and paying all the overhead, such as the paymaster, out of
their bit, which strikes me as a pretty fair sort of deal for Big Butch. But
Butch only shakes his head.</p>

<p>'It is old-fashioned stuff,' Butch says. 'Nobody opens pete boxes for a
living any more. They make the boxes too good, and they are all wired up with
alarms and are a lot of trouble generally. I am in a legitimate business now
and going along. You boys know I cannot stand another fall, what with being
away three times already, and in addition to this I must mind the baby. My old
lady goes to Mrs. Clancy's wake to-night up in the Bronx, and the chances are
she will be there all night, as she is very fond of wakes, so I must mind
little John Ignatius Junior.'</p>

<p>'Listen, Butch,' Harry the Horse says, 'this is a very soft pete. It is
old-fashioned, and you can open it with a toothpick. There are no wires on it,
because they never put more than a dime in it before in years. It just happens
they have to put the twenty G's in it tonight because my pal the paymaster
makes it a point not to get back from the jug with the scratch in time to
pay-off to-day, especially after he sees we miss out on him. It is the softest
touch you will ever know, and where can a guy pick up ten G's like this?'</p>

<p>I can see that Big Butch is thinking the ten G's over very seriously, at
that, because in these times nobody can afford to pass up ten G's, especially a
guy in the beer business, which is very, very tough just now. But finally he
shakes his head again and says like this:</p>

<p>'No,' he says, 'I must let it go, because I must mind the baby. My old lady
is very, very particular about this, and I dast not leave little John Ignatius
Junior for a minute. If Mary comes home and finds I am not minding the baby she
will put the blast on me plenty. I like to turn a few honest bobs now and then
as well as anybody, but,' Butch says, 'John Ignatius Junior comes first with
me.'</p>

<p>Then he turns away and goes back to the stoop as much as to say he is
through arguing, and sits down beside John Ignatius Junior again just in time
to keep a mosquito from carrying off one of John's legs. Anybody can see that
Big Butch is very fond of this baby, though personally I will not give you a
dime for a dozen babies, male and female.</p>

<p>Well, Harry the Horse and Little Isadore and Spanish John are very much
disappointed, and stand around talking among themselves, and paying no
attention to me, when all of a sudden Spanish John, who never has much to say
up to this time, seems to have a bright idea. He talks to Harry and Isadore,
and they get all pleasured up over what he has to say, and finally Harry goes
to Big Butch.</p>

<p>'Sh-h-h-h!' Big Butch says, pointing to the baby as Harry opens his mouth.
'Listen, Butch,' Harry says in a whisper, 'we can take the baby with us, and
you can mind it and work, too.'</p>

<p>'Why,' Big Butch whispers back, 'this is quite an idea indeed. Let us go
into the house and talk things over.'</p>

<p>So he picks up the baby and leads us into his joint, and gets out some
pretty fair beer, though it is needled a little, at that, and we sit around the
kitchen chewing the fat in whispers. There is a crib in the kitchen, and Butch
puts the baby in this crib, and it keeps on snoozing away first rate while we
are talking. In fact, it is sleeping so sound that I am commencing to figure
that Butch must give it some of the needled beer he is feeding us, because I am
feeling a little dopey myself.</p>

<p>Finally Butch says that as long as he can take John Ignatius Junior with him
he sees no reason why he shall not go and open the safe for them, only he says
he must have five per cent. more to put in the baby's bank when he gets back,
so as to round himself up with his ever-loving wife in case of a beef from her
over keeping the baby out in the night air. Harry the Horse says he considers
this extra five per cent. a little strong, but Spanish John, who seems to be a
very square guy, says that after all it is only fair to cut the baby in if it
is to be with them when making the score, and Little Isadore seems to think
this is all right, too. So Harry the Horse gives in, and says five per cent. it
is.</p>

<p>Well, as they do not wish to start out until after midnight, and as there is
plenty of time, Big Butch gets out some more needled beer, and then he goes
looking for the tools with which he opens safes, and which he says he does not
see since the day John Ignatius Junior is born and he gets them out to build
the crib.</p>

<p>Now this is a good time for me to bid one and all farewell, and what keeps
me there is something I cannot tell you to this day, because personally I never
before have any idea of taking part in a safe opening, especially with a baby,
as I consider such actions very dishonourable. When I come to think over things
afterwards, the only thing I can figure is the needled beer, but I wish to say
I am really very much surprised at myself when I find myself in a taxicab along
about one o'clock in the morning with these Brooklyn parties and Big Butch and
the baby.</p>

<p>Butch has John Ignatius Junior rolled up in a blanket, and John is still
pounding his ear. Butch has a satchel of tools, and what looks to me like a big
flat book, and just before we leave the house Butch hands me a package and
tells me to be very careful with it. He gives Little Isadore a smaller package,
which Isadore shoves into his pistol pocket, and when Isadore sits down in the
taxi something goes wa-wa, like a sheep, and Big Butch becomes very indignant
because it seems Isadore is sitting on John Ignatius Junior's doll, which says
'Mamma' when you squeeze it.</p>

<p>It seems Big Butch figures that John Ignatius Junior may wish something to
play with in case he wakes up, and it is a good thing for Little Isadore that
the mamma doll is not squashed so it cannot say 'Mamma' any more, or the
chances are Little Isadore will get a good bust in the snoot.</p>

<p>We let the taxicab go a block away from the spot we are headed for in West
Eighteenth Street, between Seventh and Eighth Avenues, and walk the rest of the
way two by two. I walk with Big Butch carrying my package, and Butch is lugging
the baby and his satchel and the flat thing that looks like a book. It is so
quiet down in West Eighteenth Street at such an hour that you can hear yourself
think, and in fact I hear myself thinking very plain that I am a big sap to be
on a job like this, especially with a baby, but I keep going just the same,
which shows you what a very big sap I am, indeed.</p>

<p>There are very few people in West Eighteenth Street when we get there, and
one of them is a fat guy who is leaning against a building almost in the centre
of the block, and who takes a walk for himself as soon as he sees us. It seems
that this fat guy is the watchman at the coal company's office and is also a
personal friend of Harry the Horse, which is why he takes the walk when he sees
us coming.</p>

<p>It is agreed before we leave Big Butch's house that Harry the Horse and
Spanish John are to stay outside the place as lookouts, while Big Butch is
inside opening the safe, and that Little Isadore is to go with Butch. Nothing
whatever is said by anybody about where I am to be at any time, and I can see
that, no matter where I am, I will still be an outsider, but, as Butch gives me
the package to carry, I figure he wishes me to remain with him.</p>

<p>It is no bother at all getting into the office of the coal company, which is
on the ground floor, because it seems the watchman leaves the front door open,
this watchman being a most obliging guy, indeed. In fact, he is so obliging
that by and by he comes back and lets Harry the Horse and Spanish John tie him
up good and tight, and stick a handkerchief in his mouth and chuck him in an
areaway next to the office, so nobody will think he has anything to do with
opening the safe in case anybody comes around asking.</p>

<p>The office looks out on the street, and the safe that Harry the Horse and
Little Isadore and Spanish John wish Big Butch to open is standing up against
the rear wall of the office facing the street windows. There is one little
electric light burning very dim over the safe so that when anybody walks past
the place outside, such as a watchman, they can look in through the window and
see the safe at all times, unless they are blind. It is not a tall safe, and it
is not a big safe, and I can see Big Butch grin when he sees it, so I figure
this safe is not much of a safe, just as Harry the Horse claims.</p>

<p>Well, as soon as Big Butch and the baby and Little Isadore and me get into
the office, Big Butch steps over to the safe and unfolds what I think is the
big flat book, and what is it but a sort of screen painted on one side to look
exactly like the front of a safe. Big Butch stands this screen up on the floor
in front of the real safe, leaving plenty of space in between, the idea being
that the screen will keep anyone passing in the street outside from seeing
Butch while he is opening the safe, because when a man is opening a safe he
needs all the privacy he can get.</p>

<p>Big Butch lays John Ignatius Junior down on the floor on the blanket behind
the phony safe front and takes his tools out of the satchel and starts to work
opening the safe, while little Isadore and me get back in a corner where it is
dark, because there is not room for all of us back of the screen. However, we
can see what Big Butch is doing, and I wish to say while I never before see a
professional safe-opener at work, and never wish to see another, this Butch
handles himself like a real artist.</p>

<p>He starts drilling into the safe around the combination lock, working very
fast and very quiet, when all of a sudden what happens but John Ignatius Junior
sits up on the blanket and lets out a squall. Naturally this is most
disquieting to me, and personally I am in favour of beaning John Ignatius
Junior with something to make him keep still, because I am nervous enough as it
is. But the squalling does not seem to bother Big Butch. He lays down his tools
and picks up John Ignatius Junior and starts whispering, 'There, there, there,
my itty oddleums. Da-dad is here.'</p>

<p>Well, this sounds very nonsensical to me in such a situation, and it makes
no impression whatever on John Ignatius Junior. He keeps on squalling, and I
judge he is squalling pretty loud because I see Harry the Horse and Spanish
John both walk past the window and look in very anxious. Big Butch jiggles John
Ignatius Junior up and down and keeps whispering baby talk to him, which sounds
very undignified coming from a high-class safe-opener, and finally Butch
whispers to me to hand him the package I am carrying.</p>

<p>He opens the package, and what is in it but a baby's nursing bottle full of
milk. Moreover, there is a little tin stew pan, and Butch hands the pan to me
and whispers to me to find a water tap somewhere in the joint and fill the pan
with water. So I go stumbling around in the dark in a room behind the office
and bark my shins several times before I find a tap and fill the pan. I take it
back to Big Butch, and he squats there with the baby on one arm, and gets a tin
of what is called canned heat out of the package, and lights this canned heat
with his cigar lighter, and starts heating the pan of water with the nursing
bottle in it.</p>

<p>Big Butch keeps sticking his finger in the pan of water while it is heating,
and by and by he puts the rubber nipple of the nursing bottle in his mouth and
takes a pull at it to see if the milk is warm enough, just like I see dolls who
have babies do. Apparently the milk is okay, as Butch hands the bottle to John
Ignatius Junior, who grabs hold of it with both hands, and starts sucking on
the business end. Naturally he has to stop squalling, and Big Butch goes to
work on the safe again, with John Ignatius Junior sitting on the blanket,
pulling on the bottle and looking wiser than a treeful of owls.</p>

<p>It seems the safe is either a tougher job than anybody figures, or Big
Butch's tools are not so good, what with being old and rusty and used for
building baby cribs, because he breaks a couple of drills and works himself up
into quite a sweat without getting anywhere. Butch afterwards explains to me
that he is one of the first guys in this country to open safes without
explosives, but he says to do this work properly you have to know the safes so
as to drill to the tumblers of the lock just right, and it seems that this
particular safe is a new type to him, even if it is old, and he is out of
practice.</p>

<p>Well, in the meantime, John Ignatius Junior finishes his bottle and starts
mumbling again, and Big Butch gives him a tool to play with, and finally Butch
needs this tool and tries to take it away from John Ignatius Junior, and the
baby lets out such a squawk that Butch has to let him keep it until he can
sneak it away from him, and this causes more delay.</p>

<p>Finally Big Butch gives up trying to drill the safe open, and he whispers to
us that he will have to put a little shot in it to loosen up the lock, which is
all right with us, because we are getting tired of hanging around and listening
to John Ignatius junior's glug-glugging. As far as I am personally concerned, I
am wishing I am home in bed.</p>

<p>Well, Butch starts pawing through his satchel looking for something and it
seems that what he is looking for is a little bottle of some kind of explosive
with which to shake the lock on the safe up some, and at first he cannot find
this bottle, but finally he discovers that John Ignatius Junior has it and is
gnawing at the cork, and Butch has quite a battle making John Ignatius Junior
give it up.</p>

<p>Anyway, he fixes the explosive in one of the holes he drills near the
combination lock on the safe, and then he puts in a fuse, and just before he
touches off the fuse Butch picks up John Ignatius Junior and hands him to
Little Isadore, and tells us to go into the room behind the office. John
Ignatius Junior does not seem to care for Little Isadore, and I do not blame
him, at that, because he starts to squirm around quite some in Isadore's arms
and lets out a squall, but all of a sudden he becomes very quiet indeed, and,
while I am not able to prove it, something tells me that Little Isadore has his
hand over John Ignatius Junior's mouth.</p>

<p>Well, Big Butch joins us right away in the back room, and sound comes out of
John Ignatius Junior again as Butch takes him from Little Isadore, and I am
thinking that it is a good thing for Isadore that the baby cannot tell Big
Butch what Isadore does to him.</p>

<p>'I put in just a little bit of a shot,' Big Butch says, 'and it will not
make any more noise than snapping your fingers.'</p>

<p>But a second later there is a big whoom from the office, and the whole joint
shakes, and John Ignatius laughs right out loud. The chances are he thinks it
is the Fourth of July.</p>

<p>'I guess maybe I put in too big a charge,' Big Butch says, and then he
rushes into the office with Little Isadore and me after him, and John Ignatius
Junior still laughing very heartily for a small baby. The door of the safe is
swinging loose, and the whole joint looks somewhat wrecked, but Big Butch loses
no time in getting his dukes into the safe and grabbing out two big bundles of
cash money, which he sticks inside his shirt.</p>

<p>As we go into the street Harry the Horse and Spanish John come running up
much excited, and Harry says to Big Butch like this:</p>

<p>'What are you trying to do,' he says, 'wake up the whole town?'</p>

<p>'Well,' Butch says, 'I guess maybe the charge is too strong, at that, but
nobody seems to be coming, so you and Spanish John walk over to Eighth Avenue,
and the rest of us will walk to Seventh, and if you go along quiet, like people
minding their own business, it will be all right.'</p>

<p>But I judge Little Isadore is tired of John Ignatius Junior's company by
this time, because he says he will go with Harry the Horse and Spanish John,
and this leaves Big Butch and John Ignatius Junior and me to go the other way.
So we start moving, and all of a sudden two cops come tearing around the corner
toward which Harry and Isadore and Spanish John are going. The chances are the
cops hear the earthquake Big Butch lets off and are coming to investigate.</p>

<p>But the chances are, too, that if Harry the Horse and the other two keep on
walking along very quietly like Butch tells them to, the coppers will pass them
up entirely, because it is not likely that coppers will figure anybody to be
opening safes with explosives in this neighbourhood. But the minute Harry the
Horse sees the coppers he loses his nut, and he outs with the old equalizer and
starts blasting away, and what does Spanish John do but get his out, too, and
open up.</p>

<p>The next thing anybody knows, the two coppers are down on the ground with
slugs in them, but other coppers are coming from every which direction, blowing
whistles and doing a little blasting themselves, and there is plenty of
excitement, especially when the coppers who are not chasing Harry the Horse and
Little Isadore and Spanish John start poking around the neighbourhood and find
Harry's pal, the watchman, all tied up nice and tight where Harry leaves him,
and the watchman explains that some scoundrels blow open the safe he is
watching.</p>

<p>All this time Big Butch and me are walking in the other direction toward
Seventh Avenue, and Big Butch has John Ignatius in his arms, and John Ignatius
is now squalling very loud indeed. The chances are he is still thinking of the
big whoom back there which tickles him so and is wishing to hear some more
whooms. Anyway, he is beating his own best record for squalling, and as we go
walking along Big Butch says to me like this:</p>

<p>'I dast not run,' he says, 'because if any coppers see me running they will
start popping at me and maybe hit John Ignatius Junior, and besides running
will joggle the milk up in him and make him sick. My old lady always warns me
never to joggle John Ignatius Junior when he is full of milk.'</p>

<p>'Well, Butch,' I say, 'there is no milk in me, and I do not care if I am
joggled up, so if you do not mind, I will start doing a piece of running at the
next corner.'</p>

<p>But just then around the corner of Seventh Avenue toward which we are headed
comes two or three coppers with a big fat sergeant with them, and one of the
coppers, who is half-out of breath as if he has been doing plenty of sprinting,
is explaining to the sergeant that somebody blows a safe down the street and
shoots a couple of coppers in the getaway.</p>

<p>And there is Big Butch, with John Ignatius Junior in his arms and twenty G's
in his shirt front and a tough record behind him, walking right up to them.</p>

<p>I am feeling very sorry, indeed, for Big Butch, and very sorry for myself,
too, and I am saying to myself that if I get out of this I will never associate
with anyone but ministers of the gospel as long as I live. I can remember
thinking that I am getting a better break than Butch, at that, because I will
not have to go to Sing Sing for the rest of my life, like him, and I also
remember wondering what they will give John Ignatius Junior, who is still
tearing off these squalls, with Big Butch saying, 'There, there, there, Daddy's
itty woogleums.' Then I hear one of the coppers say to the fat sergeant:</p>

<p>'We better nail these guys. They may be in on this.'</p>

<p>Well, I can see it is good-bye to Butch and John Ignatius Junior and me, as
the fat sergeant steps up to Big Butch, but instead of putting the arm on
Butch, the fat sergeant only points at John Ignatius Junior and asks very
sympathetic:</p>

<p>'Teeth?'</p>

<p>'No,' Big Butch says. 'Not teeth. Colic. I just get the doctor here out of
bed to do something for him, and we are going to a drug store to get some
medicine.'</p>

<p>Well, naturally I am very much surprised at this statement, because of
course I am not a doctor, and if John Ignatius Junior has colic it serves him
right, but I am only hoping they do not ask for my degree, when the fat
sergeant says:</p>

<p>'Too bad. I know what it is. I got three of them at home. But,' he says, 'it
acts more like it is teeth than colic.'</p>

<p>Then as Big Butch and John Ignatius Junior and me go on about our business I
hear the fat sergeant say to the copper, very sarcastic:</p>

<p>'Yes, of course a guy is out blowing safes with a baby in his arms! You will
make a great detective, you will!'</p>

<p>I do not see Big Butch for several days after I learn that Harry the Horse
and Little Isadore and Spanish John get back to Brooklyn all right, except they
are a little nicked up here and there from the slugs the coppers toss at them,
while the coppers they clip are not damaged so very much. Furthermore, the
chances are I will not see Big Butch for several years, if it is left to me,
but he comes looking for me one night, and he seems to be all pleasured up
about something.</p>

<p>'Say,' Big Butch says to me, 'you know I never give a copper credit for
knowing any too much about anything, but I wish to say that this fat sergeant
we run into the other night is a very, very smart duck. He is right about it
being teeth that is ailing John Ignatius Junior, for what happens yesterday but
John cuts his first tooth.'</p>

<h3><a name="The_Hottest_Guy_in_the_World" id="The_Hottest_Guy_in_the_World">The Hottest Guy in the World</a></h3>
<p>I wish to say I am very nervous indeed when Big Jule pops into my hotel room
one afternoon, because anybody will tell you that Big Jule is the hottest guy
in the whole world at the time I am speaking about.</p>

<p>In fact, it is really surprising how hot he is. They wish to see him in
Pittsburgh, Pa., about a matter of a mail truck being robbed, and there is
gossip about him in Minneapolis, Minn., where somebody takes a fifty-G pay roll
off a messenger in cash money, and slugs the messenger around somewhat for not
holding still.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the Bankers' Association is willing to pay good dough to talk
to Big Jule out in Kansas City, Mo., where a jug is knocked off by a stranger,
and in the confusion the paying teller and the cashier, and the second
vice-president are clouted about, and the day watchman is hurt, and two coppers
are badly bruised, and over fifteen G's is removed from the counters, and never
returned.</p>

<p>Then there is something about a department store in Canton, 0., and a
flour-mill safe in Toledo, and a grocery in Spokane, Wash., and a branch post
office in San Francisco, and also something about a shooting match in Chicago,
but of course this does not count so much, as only one party is fatally
injured. However, you can see that Big Jule is really very hot, what with the
coppers all over the country looking for him high and low. In fact, he is
practically on fire.</p>

<p>Of course I do not believe Big Jule does all the things the coppers say,
because coppers always blame everything no matter where it happens on the most
prominent guy they can think of, and Big Jule is quite prominent all over the
U.S.A. The chances are he does not do more than half these things, and he
probably has a good alibi for the half he does do, at that, but he is certainly
hot, and I do not care to have hot guys around me, or even guys who are only
just a little bit warm.</p>

<p>But naturally I am not going to say this to Big Jule when he pops in on me,
because he may think I am inhospitable, and I do not care to have such a rap
going around and about on me, and furthermore, Jule may become indignant if he
thinks I am inhospitable, and knock me on my potato, because Big Jule is quick
to take offence.</p>

<p>So I say hello to Big Jule, very pleasant, and ask him to have a chair by
the window where he can see the citizens walking to and fro down in Eighth
Avenue and watch the circus wagons moving into Madison Square Garden by way of
the Forty-ninth Street side, for the circus always shows in the Garden in the
spring before going out on the road. It is a little warm, and Big Jule takes
off his coat, and I can see he has one automatic slung under his arm, and
another sticking down in the waist-band of his pants, and I hope and trust that
no copper steps into the room while Big Jule is there because it is very much
against the law for guys to go around rodded up this way in New York City.</p>

<p>'Well, Jule,' I say, 'this is indeed a very large surprise to me, and I am
glad to see you, but I am thinking maybe it is very foolish for you to be
popping into New York just now, what with all the heat around here, and the
coppers looking to arrest people for very little.'</p>

<p>'I know,' Jule says. 'I know. But they do not have so very much on me around
here, no matter what people say, and a guy gets homesick for his old home town,
especially a guy who is stuck away where I am for the past few months. I get
homesick for the lights and the crowds on Broadway, and for the old
neighbourhood. Furthermore, I wish to see my Maw. I hear she is sick and may
not live, and I wish to see her before she goes.'</p>

<p>Well, naturally anybody will wish to see their Maw under such circumstances,
but Big Jule's Maw lives over in West Forty-ninth Street near Eleventh Avenue,
and who is living in the very same block but Johnny Brannigan, the strong-arm
copper, and it is a hundred to one if Big Jule goes nosing around his old
neighbourhood, Johnny Brannigan will hear of it, and if there is one guy Johnny
Brannigan does not care for, it is Big Jule, although they are kids
together.</p>

<p>But it seems that even when they are kids they have very little use for each
other, and after they grow up and Johnny gets on the strong-arm squad, he never
misses a chance to push Big Jule around, and sometimes trying to boff Big Jule
with his blackjack, and it is well known to one and all that before Big Jule
leaves town the last time, he takes a punch at Johnny Brannigan, and Johnny
swears he will never rest until he puts Big Jule where he belongs, although
where Big Jule belongs, Johnny does not say.</p>

<p>So I speak of Johnny living in the same block with Big Jule's Maw to Big
Jule, but it only makes him mad. 'I am not afraid of Johnny Brannigan,' he
says. 'In fact,' he says, 'I am thinking for some time lately that maybe I will
clip Johnny Brannigan good while I am here. I owe Johnny Brannigan a clipping.
But I wish to see my Maw first, and then I will go around and see Miss Kitty
Clancy. I guess maybe she will be much surprised to see me, and no doubt very
glad.'</p>

<p>Well, I figure it is a sure thing Miss Kitty Clancy will be surprised to see
Big Jule, but I am not so sure about her being glad, because very often when a
guy is away from a doll for a year or more, no matter however-loving she may
be, she may get to thinking of someone else, for this is the way dolls are,
whether they live on Eleventh Avenue or over on Park. Still, I remember hearing
that this Miss Kitty Clancy once thinks very well of Big Jule, although her old
man, Jack Clancy, who runs a speak-easy, always claims it is a big knock to the
Clancy family to have such a character as Big Jule hanging around.</p>

<p>'I often think of Miss Kitty Clancy the past year or so,' Big Jule says, as
he sits there by the window, watching the circus wagons, and the crowds. 'I
especially think of her the past few months. In fact,' he says, 'thinking of
Miss Kitty Clancy is about all I have to do where I am at, which is in an old
warehouse on the Bay of Fundy outside of a town that is called St. John's, or
some such, up in Canada, and thinking of Miss Kitty Clancy all this time, I
find out I love her very much indeed.</p>

<p>'I go to this warehouse,' Big Jule says, 'after somebody takes a jewellery
store in the town, and the coppers start in blaming me. This warehouse is not
such a place as I will choose myself if I am doing the choosing, because it is
an old fur warehouse, and full of strange smells, but in the excitement around
the jewellery store, somebody puts a slug in my hip, and Leon Pierre carries me
to the old warehouse, and there I am until I get well.</p>

<p>'It is very lonesome,' Big Jule says. 'In fact, you will be surprised how
lonesome it is, and it is very, very cold, and all I have for company is a lot
of rats. Personally, I never care for rats under any circumstances because they
carry disease germs, and are apt to bite a guy when he is asleep, if they are
hungry, which is what these rats try to do to me.</p>

<p>'The warehouse is away off by itself,' Jule says, 'and nobody ever comes
around there except Leon Pierre to bring me grub and dress my hip, and at night
it is very still, and all you can hear is the wind howling around outside, and
the rats running here and there. Some of them are very, very large rats. In
fact, some of them seem about the size of rabbits, and they are pretty fresh,
at that. At first I am willing to make friends with these rats, but they seem
very hostile, and after they take a few nips at me, I can see there is no use
trying to be nice to them, so I have Leon Pierre bring me a lot of ammunition
for my rods every day and I practise shooting at the rats.</p>

<p>'The warehouse is so far off there is no danger of anybody hearing the
shooting,' Big Jule says, 'and it helps me pass the time away. I get so I can
hit a rat sitting, or running, or even flying through the air, because these
warehouse rats often leap from place to place like mountain sheep, their idea
being generally to take a good nab at me as they fly past.</p>

<p>'Well, sir,' Jule says, 'I keep score on myself one day, and I hit fifty
rats hand running without a miss, which I claim makes me the champion rat
shooter of the world with a forty-five automatic, although of course,' he says,
'if anybody wishes to challenge me to a rat shooting match I am willing to take
them on for a side bet. I get so I can call my shots on the rats, and in fact
several times I say to myself, I will hit this one in the right eye, and this
one in the left eye, and it always turns out just as I say, although sometimes
when you hit a rat with a forty-five up close it is not always possible to tell
afterwards just where you hit him, because you seem to hit him all over.</p>

<p>'By and by,' Jule says, 'I seem to discourage the rats somewhat, and they
get so they play the chill for me, and do not try to nab me even when I am
asleep. They find out that no rat dast poke his whiskers out at me or he will
get a very close shave. So I have to look around for other amusement, but there
is not much doing in such a place, although I finally find a bunch of doctor's
books which turn out to be very interesting reading. It seems these books are
left there by some croaker who retires there to think things over after
experimenting on his ever-loving wife with a knife. In fact, it seems he cuts
his ever-loving wife's head off, and she does not continue living, so he takes
his books and goes to the warehouse and remains there until the law finds him,
and hangs him up very high, indeed.</p>

<p>'Well, the books are a great comfort to me, and I learn many astonishing
things about surgery, but after I read all the books there is nothing for me to
do but think, and what I think about is Miss Kitty Clancy, and how much
pleasure we have together walking around and about and seeing movie shows, and
all this and that, until her old man gets so tough with me. Yes, I will be very
glad to see Miss Kitty Clancy, and the old neighbourhood, and my Maw
again.'</p>

<p>Well, finally nothing will do Big Jule but he must take a stroll over into
his old neighbourhood, and see if he cannot see Miss Kitty Clancy, and also
drop in on his Maw, and he asks me to go along with him. I can think of a
million things I will rather do than take a stroll with Big Jule, but I do not
wish him to think I am snobbish, because as I say, Big Jule is quick to take
offence. Furthermore, I figure that at such an hour of the day he is less
likely to run into Johnny Brannigan or any other coppers who know him than at
any other time, so I say I will go with him, but as we start out, Big Jule puts
on his rods.</p>

<p>'Jule,' I say, 'do not take any rods with you on a stroll, because somebody
may happen to see them, such as a copper, and you know they will pick you up
for carrying a rod in this town quicker than you can say Jack Robinson, whether
they know who you are or not. You know the Sullivan law is very strong against
guys carrying rods in this town.'</p>

<p>But Big Jule says he is afraid he will catch cold if he goes out without his
rods, so we go down into Forty-ninth Street and start west toward Madison
Square Garden, and just as we reach Eighth Avenue and are standing there
waiting for the traffic to stop, so we can cross the street, I see there is
quite some excitement around the Garden on the Forty-ninth Street side, with
people running every which way, and yelling no little, and looking up in the
air.</p>

<p>So I look up myself, and what do I see sitting up there on the edge of the
Garden roof but a big ugly-faced monkey. At first I do not recognize it as a
monkey, because it is so big I figure maybe it is just one of the prize-fight
managers who stand around on this side of the Garden all afternoon waiting to
get a match for their fighters, and while I am somewhat astonished to see a
prize-fight manager in such a position, I figure maybe he is doing it on a bet.
But when I take a second look I see that it is indeed a big monk, and an
exceptionally homely monk at that, although personally I never see any monks I
consider so very handsome, anyway.</p>

<p>Well, this big monk is holding something in its arms, and what it is I am
not able to make out at first, but then Big Jule and I cross the street to the
side opposite the Garden, and now I can see that the monk has a baby in its
arms. Naturally I figure it is some kind of advertising dodge put on by the
Garden to ballyhoo the circus, or maybe the fight between Sharkey and Risko
which is coming off after the circus, but guys are still yelling and running up
and down, and dolls are screaming until finally I realize that a most
surprising situation prevails.</p>

<p>It seems that the big monk up on the roof is nobody but Bongo, who is a
gorilla belonging to the circus, and one of the very few gorillas of any
account in this country, or anywhere else, as far as this goes, because good
gorillas are very scarce, indeed. Well, it seems that while they are shoving
Bongo's cage into the Garden, the door becomes unfastened, and the first thing
anybody knows, out pops Bongo, and goes bouncing along the street where a lot
of the neighbours' children are playing games on the sidewalk, and a lot of
Mammas are sitting out in the sun alongside baby buggies containing their
young. This is a very common sight in side streets such as West Forty-ninth on
nice days, and by no means unpleasant, if you like Mammas and their young.</p>

<p>Now what does this Bongo do but reach into a baby buggy which a Mamma is
pushing past on the sidewalk on the Garden side of the street, and snatch out a
baby, though what Bongo wants with this baby nobody knows to this day. It is a
very young baby, and not such a baby as is fit to give a gorilla the size of
Bongo any kind of struggle, so Bongo has no trouble whatever in handling it.
Anyway, I always hear a gorilla will make a sucker out of a grown man in a
battle, though I wish to say I never see a battle between a gorilla and a grown
man. It ought to be a first-class drawing card, at that.</p>

<p>Well, naturally the baby's Mamma puts up quite a squawk about Bongo grabbing
her baby, because no Mamma wishes her baby to keep company with a gorilla, and
this Mamma starts in screaming very loud, and trying to take the baby away from
Bongo, so what does Bongo do but run right up on the roof of the Garden by way
of a big electric sign which hangs down on the Forty-ninth Street side. And
there old Bongo sits on the edge of the roof with the baby in his arms, and the
baby is squalling quite some, and Bongo is making funny noises, and showing his
teeth as the folks commence gathering in the street below.</p>

<p>There is a big guy in his shirt-sleeves running through the crowd waving his
hands, and trying to shush everybody, and saying 'Quiet, please' over and over,
but nobody pays any attention to him. I figure this guy has something to do
with the circus, and maybe with Bongo, too. A traffic copper takes a peek at
the situation, and calls for the reserves from the Forty-seventh Street
station, and somebody else sends for the fire truck down the street, and pretty
soon cops are running from every direction, and the fire-engines are coming,
and the big guy in his shirt-sleeves is more excited than ever.</p>

<p>'Quiet, please,' he says. 'Everybody keep quiet, because if Bongo becomes
disturbed by the noise he will throw the baby down in the street. He throws
everything he gets his hands on,' the guy says. 'He acquires this habit from
throwing coco-nuts back in his old home country. Let us get a life net, and if
you all keep quiet we may be able to save the baby before Bongo starts heaving
it like a coco-nut.'</p>

<p>Well, Bongo is sitting up there on the edge of the roof about seven stories
above the ground peeking down with the baby in his arms, and he is holding this
baby just like a Mamma would, but anybody can see that Bongo does not care for
the row below, and once he lifts the baby high above his head as if to bean
somebody with it. I see Big Nig, the crap shooter, in the mob, and afterwards I
hear he is around offering to lay seven to five against the baby, but everybody
is too excited to bet on such a proposition, although it is not a bad price, at
that.</p>

<p>I see one doll in the crowd on the sidewalk on the side of the street
opposite the Garden who is standing perfectly still staring up at the monk and
the baby with a very strange expression on her face, and the way she is looking
makes me take a second gander at her, and who is it but Miss Kitty Clancy. Her
lips are moving as she stands there staring up, and something tells me Miss
Kitty Clancy is saying prayers to herself, because she is such a doll as will
know how to say prayers on an occasion like this.</p>

<p>Big Jule sees her about the same time I do, and Big Jule steps up beside
Miss Kitty Clancy, and says hello to her, and though it is over a year since
Miss Kitty Clancy sees Big Jule she turns to him and speaks to him as if she is
talking to him just a minute before. It is very strange indeed the way Miss
Kitty Clancy speaks to Big Jule as if he has never been away at all.</p>

<p>'Do something, Julie,' she says. 'You are always the one to do something.
Oh, please do something, Julie.'</p>

<p>Well, Big Jule never answers a word, but steps back in the clear of the
crowd and reaches for the waistband of his pants, when I grab him by the arm
and say to him like this:</p>

<p>'My goodness, Jule,' I say, 'what are you going to do?'</p>

<p>'Why,' Jule says, 'I am going to shoot this thieving monk before he takes a
notion to heave the baby on somebody down here. For all I know,' Jule says, 'he
may hit me with it, and I do not care to be hit with anybody's baby.'</p>

<p>'Jule,' I say, very earnestly, 'do not pull a rod in front of all these
coppers, because if you do they will nail you sure, if only for having the rod,
and if you are nailed you are in a very tough spot, indeed, what with being
wanted here and there. Jule,' I say, 'you are hotter than a forty-five all over
this country, and I do not wish to see you nailed. Anyway,' I say, 'you may
shoot the baby instead of the monk, because anybody can see it will be very
difficult to hit the monk up there without hitting the baby. Furthermore, even
if you do hit the monk it will fall into the street, and bring the baby with
it.'</p>

<p>'You speak great foolishness,' Jule says. 'I never miss what I shoot at. I
will shoot the monk right between the eyes, and this will make him fall
backwards, not forwards, and the baby will not be hurt because anybody can see
it is no fall at all from the ledge to the roof behind. I make a study of such
propositions,' Jule says, 'and I know if a guy is in such a position as this
monk sitting on a ledge looking down from a high spot, his defensive reflexes
tend backwards, so this is the way he is bound to fall if anything unexpected
comes up on him, such as a bullet between the eyes. I read all about it in the
doctor's books,' Jule says.</p>

<p>Then all of a sudden up comes his hand, and in his hand is one of his rods,
and I hear a sound like ker-bap. When I come to think about it afterwards, I do
not remember Big Jule even taking aim like a guy will generally do if he is
shooting at something sitting, but old Bongo seems to lift up a little bit off
the ledge at the crack of the gun, and then he keels over backwards, the baby
still in his arms, and squalling more than somewhat, and Big Jule says to me
like this:</p>

<p>'Right between the eyes, and I will bet on it,' he says, 'although it is not
much of a target, at that.'</p>

<p>Well, nobody can figure what happens for a minute, and there is much silence
except from the guy in his shirtsleeves who is expressing much indignation with
Big Jule and saying the circus people will sue him for damages sure if he has
hurt Bongo, because the monk is worth $100,000, or some such. I see Miss Kitty
Clancy kneeling on the sidewalk with her hands clasped, and looking upwards,
and Big Jule is sticking his rod back in his waistband again.</p>

<p>By this time some guys are out on the roof getting through from the inside
of the building with the idea of heading Bongo off from that direction, and
they let out a yell, and pretty soon I see one of them holding the baby up so
everyone in the street can see it. A couple of other guys get down near the
edge of the roof and pick up Bongo and show him to the crowd, as dead as a
mackerel, and one of the guys puts a finger between Bongo's eyes to show where
the bullet hits the monk, and Miss Kitty Clancy walks over to Big Jule and
tries to say something to him, but only busts out crying very loud.</p>

<p>Well, I figure this is a good time for Big Jule and me to take a walk,
because everybody is interested in what is going on up on the roof, and I do
not wish the circus people to get a chance to serve a summons in a damage suit
on Big Jule for shooting the valuable monk. Furthermore, a couple of coppers in
harness are looking Big Jule over very critically, and I figure they are apt to
put the old sleeve on Jule any second.</p>

<p>All of a sudden a slim young guy steps up to Big Jule and says to him like
this: 'Jule,' he says, 'I want to see you,' and who is it but Johnny Brannigan.
Naturally Big Jule starts reaching for a rod, but Johnny starts him walking
down the street so fast Big Jule does not have time to get in action just
then.</p>

<p>'No use getting it out, Jule,' Johnny Brannigan says. 'No use, and no need.
Come with me, and hurry.'</p>

<p>Well, Big Jule is somewhat puzzled because Johnny Brannigan is not acting
like a copper making a collar, so he goes along with Johnny, and I follow after
him, and half-way down the block Johnny stops a Yellow short, and hustles us
into it and tells the driver to keep shoving down Eighth Avenue.</p>

<p>'I am trailing you ever since you get in town, Jule,' Johnny Brannigan says.
'You never have a chance around here. I am going over to your Maw's house to
put the arm on you, figuring you are sure to go there, when the thing over by
the Garden comes off. Now I am getting out of this cab at the next corner, and
you go on and see your Maw, and then screw out of town as quick as you can,
because you are red hot around here, Jule.</p>

<p>'By the way,' Johnny Brannigan says, 'do you know it is my kid you save,
Jule? Mine and Kitty Clancy's? We are married a year ago to-day.'</p>

<p>Well, Big Jule looks very much surprised for a moment, and then he laughs,
and says like this: 'Well, I never know it is Kitty Clancy's, but I figure it
for yours the minute I see it because it looks like you.'</p>

<p>'Yes,' Johnny Brannigan says, very proud, 'everybody says he does.'</p>

<p>'I can see the resemblance even from a distance,' Big Jule says. 'In fact,'
he says, 'it is remarkable how much you look alike. But,' he says, 'for a
minute, Johnny, I am afraid I will not be able to pick out the right face
between the two on the roof, because it is very hard to tell the monk and your
baby apart.'</p>

<h3><a name="The_Lemon_Drop_Kid" id="The_Lemon_Drop_Kid">The Lemon Drop Kid</a></h3>
<p>I am going to take you back a matter of four or five years ago to an August
afternoon and the race track at Saratoga, which is a spot in New York state
very pleasant to behold, and also to a young guy by the name of The Lemon Drop
Kid, who is called The Lemon Drop Kid because he always has a little sack of
lemon drops in the side pocket of his coat, and is always munching at same, a
lemon drop being a breed of candy that is relished by many, although personally
I prefer peppermints.</p>

<p>On this day I am talking about, The Lemon Drop Kid is looking about for
business, and not doing so good for himself, at that, as The Lemon Drop Kid's
business is telling the tale, and he is finding it very difficult indeed to
discover citizens who are willing to listen to him tell the tale.</p>

<p>And of course if a guy whose business is telling the tale cannot find
anybody to listen to him, he is greatly handicapped, for the tale such a guy
tells is always about how he knows something is doing in a certain race, the
idea of the tale being that it may cause the citizen who is listening to it to
make a wager on this certain race, and if the race comes out the way the guy
who is telling the tale says it will come out, naturally the citizen is bound
to be very grateful to the guy, and maybe reward him liberally.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the citizen is bound to listen to more tales, and a guy whose
business is telling the tale, such as The Lemon Drop Kid, always has tales to
tell until the cows come home, and generally they are long tales, and sometimes
they are very interesting and entertaining, according to who is telling them,
and it is well known to one and all that nobody can tell the tale any better
than The Lemon Drop Kid.</p>

<p>But old Cap Duhaine and his sleuths at the Saratoga track are greatly
opposed to guys going around telling the tale, and claim that such guys are
nothing but touts, and they are especially opposed to The Lemon Drop Kid,
because they say he tells the tale so well that he weakens public confidence in
horse racing. So they are casing The Lemon Drop Kid pretty close to see that he
does not get some citizen's ear and start telling him the tale, and finally The
Lemon Drop Kid is greatly disgusted and walks up the lawn towards the head of
the stretch.</p>

<p>And while he is walking, he is eating lemon drops out of his pocket, and
thinking about how much better off he will be if he puts in the last ten years
of his life at some legitimate dodge, instead of hop-scotching from one end of
the country to the other telling the tale, although just off-hand The Lemon
Drop Kid cannot think of any legitimate dodge at which he will see as much of
life as he sees around the race tracks since he gets out of the orphan asylum
in Jersey City where he is raised.</p>

<p>At the time this story starts out, The Lemon Drop Kid is maybe twenty-four
years old, and he is a quiet little guy with a low voice, which comes of
keeping it confidential when he is telling the tale, and he is nearly always
alone. In fact, The Lemon Drop Kid is never known to have a pal as long as he
is around telling the tale, although he is by no means an unfriendly guy, and
is always speaking to everybody, even when he is in the money.</p>

<p>But it is now a long time since The Lemon Drop Kid is in the money, or seems
to have any chance of being in the money, and the landlady of the
boarding-house in Saratoga where he is residing is becoming quite hostile, and
making derogatory cracks about him, and also about most of her other boarders,
too, so The Lemon Drop Kid is unable to really enjoy his meals there,
especially as they are very bad meals to start with.</p>

<p>Well, The Lemon Drop Kid goes off by himself up the lawn and stands there
looking out across the track, munching a lemon drop from time to time, and
thinking what a harsh old world it is, to be sure, and how much better off it
will be if there are no sleuths whatever around and about.</p>

<p>It is a day when not many citizens are present at the track, and the only
one near The Lemon Drop Kid seems to be an old guy in a wheel chair, with a
steamer rug over his knees, and a big, sleepy-looking stove lid who appears to
be in charge of the chair.</p>

<p>This old guy has a big white mouser, and big white bristly eyebrows, and he
is a very fierce-looking old guy, indeed, and anybody can tell at once that he
is nothing but a curmudgeon, and by no means worthy of attention. But he is a
familiar spectacle at the race track at Saratoga, as he comes out nearly every
day in a limousine the size of a hearse, and is rolled out of the limousine in
his wheel chair on a little runway by the stove lid, and pushed up to this spot
where he is sitting now, so he can view the sport of kings without being
bothered by the crowds.</p>

<p>It is well known to one and all that his name is Rarus P. Griggsby, and that
he has plenty of potatoes, which he makes in Wall Street, and that he is closer
than the next second with his potatoes, and furthermore, it is also well known
that he hates everybody in the world, including himself, so nobody goes
anywhere near him if they can help it.</p>

<p>The Lemon Drop Kid does not realize he is standing so close to Rarus P.
Griggsby, until he hears the old guy growling at the stove lid, and then The
Lemon Drop Kid looks at Rarus P. Griggsby very sympathetic and speaks to him in
his low voice as follows:</p>

<p>'Gout?' he says.</p>

<p>Now of course The Lemon Drop Kid knows who Rarus P. Griggsby is, and under
ordinary circumstances The Lemon Drop Kid will not think of speaking to such a
character, but afterwards he explains that he is feeling so despondent that he
addresses Rarus P. Griggsby just to show he does not care what happens. And
under ordinary circumstances, the chances are Rarus P. Griggsby will start
hollering for the gendarmes if a stranger has the gall to speak to him, but
there is so much sympathy in The Lemon Drop Kid's voice and eyes, that Rarus P.
Griggsby seems to be taken by surprise, and he answers like this:</p>

<p>'Arthritis,' Rarus P. Griggsby says. 'In my knees,' he says. 'I am not able
to walk a step in three years.'</p>

<p>'Why,' The Lemon Drop Kid says, 'I am greatly distressed to hear this. I
know just how you feel, because I am troubled from infancy with this same
disease.'</p>

<p>Now of course this is strictly the old ackamarackus, as The Lemon Drop Kid
cannot even spell arthritis, let alone have it, but he makes the above
statement just by way of conversation; and furthermore he goes on to state as
follows:</p>

<p>'In fact,' The Lemon Drop Kid says, 'I suffer so I can scarcely think, but
one day I find a little remedy that fixes me up as right as rain, and I now
have no trouble whatsoever.'</p>

<p>And with this, he takes a lemon drop out of his pocket and pops it into his
mouth, and then he hands one to Rarus P. Griggsby in a most hospitable manner,
and the old guy holds the lemon drop between his thumb and forefinger and looks
at it as if he expects it to explode right in his pan, while the stove lid
gazes at The Lemon Drop Kid with a threatening expression.</p>

<p>'Well,' Rarus P. Griggsby says, 'personally I consider all cures fakes. I
have a standing offer of five thousand dollars to anybody that can cure me of
my pain, and nobody even comes close so far. Doctors are also fakes,' he says.
'I have seven of them, and they take out my tonsils, and all my teeth, and my
appendix, and they keep me from eating anything I enjoy, and I only get worse.
The waters here in Saratoga seem to help me some, but,' he says, 'they do not
get me out of this wheel chair, and I am sick and tired of it all.'</p>

<p>Then, as if he comes to a quick decision, he pops the lemon drop into his
mouth, and begins munching it very slow, and after a while he says it tastes
just like a lemon drop to him, and of course it is a lemon drop all along, but
The Lemon Drop Kid says this taste is only to disguise the medicine in it.</p>

<p>Now, by and by, The Lemon Drop Kid commences telling Rarus P. Griggsby the
tale, and afterwards The Lemon Drop Kid says he has no idea Rarus P. Griggsby
will listen to the tale, and that he only starts telling it to him in a spirit
of good clean fun, just to see how he will take it, and he is greatly surprised
to note that Rarus P. Griggsby is all attention.</p>

<p>Personally, I find nothing unusual in this situation, because I often see
citizens around the race tracks as prominent as Rarus P. Griggsby, listening to
the tale from guys who do not have as much as a seat in their pants, especially
if the tale has any larceny in it, because it is only human nature to be deeply
interested in larceny.</p>

<p>And the tale The Lemon Drop Kid tells Rarus P. Griggsby is that he is a
brother of Sonny Saunders, the jock, and that Sonny tells him to be sure and be
at the track this day to bet on a certain horse in the fifth race, because it
is nothing but a boat race, and everything in it is as stiff as a plank, except
this certain horse.</p>

<p>Now of course this is all a terrible lie, and The Lemon Drop Kid is taking a
great liberty with Sonny Saunders's name, especially as Sonny does not have any
brothers, anyway, and even if Sonny knows about a boat race the chances are he
will never tell The Lemon Drop Kid, but then very few guys whose business is
telling the tale ever stop to figure they may be committing perjury.</p>

<p>So The Lemon Drop Kid goes on to state that when he arrives at the track he
has fifty bobs pinned to his wishbone to bet on this certain horse, but
unfortunately he gets a tip on a real good thing in the very first race, and
bets his fifty bobs right then and there, figuring to provide himself with a
larger taw to bet on the certain horse in the fifth, but the real good thing
receives practically a criminal ride from a jock who does not know one end of a
horse from the other, and is beat a very dirty snoot, and there The Lemon Drop
Kid is with the fifth race coming up, and an absolute cinch in it, the way his
tale goes, but with no dough left to bet on it.</p>

<p>Well, personally I do not consider this tale as artistic as some The Lemon
Drop Kid tells, and in fact The Lemon Drop Kid himself never rates it among his
masterpieces, but old Rarus P. Griggsby listens to the tale quite intently
without saying a word, and all the time he is munching the lemon drop and
smacking his lips under his big white mouser, as if he greatly enjoys this
delicacy, but when The Lemon Drop Kid concludes the tale, and is standing there
gazing out across the track with a very sad expression on his face, Rarus P.
Griggsby speaks as follows:</p>

<p>'I never bet on horse races,' Rarus P. Griggsby says. 'They are too
uncertain. But this proposition you present sounds like finding money, and I
love to find money. I will wager one hundred dollars on your assurance that
this certain horse cannot miss.'</p>

<p>And with this, he outs with a leather so old that The Lemon Drop Kid half
expects a cockroach to leap out at him, and produces a C note which he hands to
The Lemon Drop Kid, and as he does so, Rarus P. Griggsby inquires:</p>

<p>'What is the name of this certain horse?'</p>

<p>Well, of course this is a fair question, but it happens that The Lemon Drop
Kid is so busy all afternoon thinking of the injustice of the sleuths that he
never even bothers to look up this particular race beforehand, and afterwards
he is quite generally criticised for slovenliness in this matter, for if a guy
is around telling the tale about a race, he is entitled to pick out a horse
that has at least some kind of a chance.</p>

<p>But of course The Lemon Drop Kid is not expecting the opportunity of telling
the tale to arise, so the question finds him unprepared, as off-hand he cannot
think of the name of a horse in the race, as he never consults the scratches,
and he does not wish to mention the name of some plug that may be scratched
out, and lose the chance to make the C note. So as he seizes the C note from
Rarus P. Griggsby and turns to dash for the bookmakers over in front of the
grandstand, all The Lemon Drop Kid can think of to say at this moment is the
following:</p>

<p>'Watch Number Two,' he says.</p>

<p>And the reason he says No.2, is he figures there is bound to be a No.2 in
the race, while he cannot be so sure about a No.7 or a No. 9 until he looks
them over, because you understand that all The Lemon Drop Kid states in telling
the tale to Rarus P. Griggsby about knowing of something doing in this race is
very false.</p>

<p>And of course The Lemon Drop Kid has no idea of betting the C note on
anything whatever in the race. In the first place, he does not know of anything
to bet on, and in the second place he needs the C note, but he is somewhat
relieved when he inquires of the first bookie he comes to, and learns that No.2
is an old walrus by the name of The Democrat, and anybody knows that The
Democrat has no chance of winning even in a field of mud turtles.</p>

<p>So The Lemon Drop Kid puts the C note in his pants pocket, and walks around
and about until the horses are going to the post, and you must not think there
is anything dishonest in his not betting this money with a bookmaker, as The
Lemon Drop Kid is only taking the bet himself, which is by no means unusual,
and in fact it is so common that only guys like Cap Duhaine and his sleuths
think much about it.</p>

<p>Finally The Lemon Drop Kid goes back to Rarus P. Griggsby, for it will be
considered most ungenteel for a guy whose business is telling the tale to be
absent when it comes time to explain why the tale does not stand up, and about
this time the horses are turning for home, and a few seconds later they go
busting past the spot where Rarus P. Griggsby is sitting in his wheel chair,
and what is in front to the wire by a Salt Lake City block but The Democrat
with No.2 on his blanket.</p>

<p>Well, old Rarus P. Griggsby starts yelling and waving his hands, and making
so much racket that he is soon the centre of attention, and when it comes out
that he bets a C note on the winner, nobody blames him for cutting up these
didoes, for the horse is a twenty to one shot, but all this time The Lemon Drop
Kid only stands there looking very, very sad and shaking his head, until
finally Rarus P. Griggsby notices his strange attitude.</p>

<p>'Why are you not cheering over our winning this nice bet?' he says. 'Of
course I expect to declare you in,' he says. 'In fact I am quite grateful to
you.'</p>

<p>'But,' The Lemon Drop Kid says, 'we do not win. Our horse runs a jolly
second.'</p>

<p>'What do you mean, <i>second</i>?' Rarus P. Griggsby says. 'Do you not tell me to
watch Number Two, and does not Number Two win?'</p>

<p>'Yes,' The Lemon Drop Kid says, 'what you state is quite true, but what I
mean when I say watch Number Two is that Number Two is the only horse I am
afraid of in the race, and it seems my fear is well founded.'</p>

<p>Now at this, old Rarus P. Griggsby sits looking at The Lemon Drop Kid for as
long as you can count up to ten, if you count slow, and his mouser and eyebrows
are all twitching at once, and anybody can see that he is very much perturbed,
and then all of a sudden he lets out a yell and to the great amazement of one
and all he leaps right out of his wheel chair and makes a lunge at The Lemon
Drop Kid.</p>

<p>Well, there is no doubt that Rarus P. Griggsby has murder in his heart, and
nobody blames The Lemon Drop Kid when he turns and starts running away at great
speed, and in fact he has such speed that finally his feet are throwing back
little stones off the gravel paths of the race track with such velocity that a
couple of spectators who get hit by these stones think they are shot.</p>

<p>For a few yards, old Rarus P. Griggsby is right at The Lemon Drop Kid's
heels, and furthermore Rarus P. Griggsby is yelling and swearing in a most
revolting manner. Then some of Cap Duhaine's sleuths come running up and they
take after The Lemon Drop Kid too, and he has to have plenty of early foot to
beat them to the race-track gates, and while Rarus P. Griggsby does not figure
much in the running after the first few jumps, The Lemon Drop Kid seems to
remember hearing him cry out as follows:</p>

<p>'Stop, there! Please stop!' Rarus P. Griggsby cries. 'I wish to see
you.'</p>

<p>But of course The Lemon Drop Kid is by no means a chump, and he does not
even slacken up, let alone stop, until he is well beyond the gates, and the
sleuths are turning back, and what is more, The Lemon Drop Kid takes the road
leading out of Saratoga instead of going back to the city, because he figures
that Saratoga may not be so congenial to him for a while.</p>

<p>In fact, The Lemon Drop Kid finds himself half-regretting that he ever tells
the tale to Rarus P. Griggsby as The Lemon Drop Kid likes Saratoga in August,
but of course such a thing as happens to him in calling a winner the way he
does is just an unfortunate accident, and is not apt to happen again in a
lifetime.</p>

<p>Well, The Lemon Drop Kid keeps on walking away from Saratoga for quite some
time, and finally he is all tuckered out and wishes to take the load off his
feet. So when he comes to a small town by the name of Kibbsville, he sits down
on the porch of what seems to be a general store and gas station, and while he
is sitting there thinking of how nice and quiet and restful this town seems to
be, with pleasant shade trees, and white houses all around and about, he sees
standing in the doorway of a very little white house across the street from the
store, in a gingham dress, the most beautiful young doll that ever lives, and I
know this is true, because The Lemon Drop Kid tells me so afterwards.</p>

<p>This doll has brown hair hanging down her back, and her smile is so
wonderful that when an old pappy guy with a goatee comes out of the store to
sell a guy in a flivver some gas, The Lemon Drop Kid hauls off and asks him if
he can use a clerk.</p>

<p>Well, it seems that the old guy can, at that, because it seems that a former
clerk, a guy by the name of Pilloe, recently lays down and dies on the old guy
from age and malnutrition, and so this is how The Lemon Drop Kid comes to be
planted in Kibbsville, and clerking in Martin Potter's store for the next
couple of years, at ten bobs per week.</p>

<p>And furthermore, this is how The Lemon Drop Kid meets up with Miss Alicia
Deering, who is nobody but the beautiful little doll that The Lemon Drop Kid
sees standing in the doorway of the little house across the street.</p>

<p>She lives in this house with her papa, her mamma being dead a long time, and
her papa is really nothing but an old bum who dearly loves his applejack, and
who is generally around with a good heat on. His first name is Jonas, and he is
a house painter by trade, but he seldom feels like doing any painting, as he
claims he never really recovers from a terrible backache he gets when he is in
the Spanish-American War with the First New York, so Miss Alicia Deering
supports him by dealing them off her arm in the Commercial Hotel.</p>

<p>But although The Lemon Drop Kid now works for a very great old skinflint who
even squawks about The Lemon Drop Kid's habit of filling his side pocket now
and then with lemon drops out of a jar on the shelf in the store, The Lemon
Drop Kid is very happy, for the truth of the matter is he loves Miss Alicia
Deering, and it is the first time in his life he ever loves anybody, or
anything. And furthermore, it is the first time in his life The Lemon Drop Kid
is living quietly, and in peace, and not losing sleep trying to think of ways
of cheating somebody.</p>

<p>In fact, The Lemon Drop Kid now looks back on his old life with great
repugnance, for he can see that it is by no means the proper life for any guy,
and sometimes he has half a mind to write to his former associates who may
still be around telling the tale, and request them to mend their ways, only The
Lemon Drop Kid does not wish these old associates to know where he is.</p>

<p>He never as much as peeks at a racing sheet nowadays, and he spends all his
spare time with Miss Alicia Deering, which is not so much time, at that, as old
Martin Potter does not care to see his employees loafing between the hours of 6
a.m. and 10 p.m., and neither does the Commercial Hotel. But one day in the
spring, when the apple blossoms are blooming in these parts, and the air is
chock-a-block with perfume, and the grass is getting nice and green, The Lemon
Drop Kid speaks of his love to Miss Alicia Deering, stating that it is such a
love that he can scarcely eat.</p>

<p>Well, Miss Alicia Deering states that she reciprocates this love one hundred
per cent., and then The Lemon Drop Kid suggests they get married up
immediately, and she says she is in favour of the idea, only she can never
think of leaving her papa, who has no one else in all this world but her, and
while this is a little more extra weight than The Lemon Drop Kid figures on
picking up, he says his love is so terrific he can even stand for her papa,
too.</p>

<p>So they are married, and go to live in the little house across the street
from Martin Potter's store with Miss Alicia Deering's papa. When he marries
Miss Alicia Deering, The Lemon Drop Kid has a bank roll of one hundred and
eighteen dollars, including the C note he takes off of Rarus P. Griggsby, and
eighteen bobs that he saves out of his salary from Martin Potter in a year, and
three nights after the marriage, Miss Alicia Deering's papa sniffs out where
The Lemon Drop Kid plants his roll and sneezes same.</p>

<p>Then he goes on a big applejack toot, and spends all the dough.</p>

<p>But in spite of everything, including old man Deering, The Lemon Drop Kid
and Miss Alicia Deering are very, very happy in the little house for about a
year, especially when it seems that Miss Alicia Deering is going to have a
baby, although this incident compels her to stop dealing them off the arm at
the Commercial Hotel, and cuts down their resources.</p>

<p>Now one day, Miss Alicia Deering comes down with a great illness, and it is
such an illness as causes old Doc Abernathy, the local croaker, to wag his
head, and to state that it is beyond him, and that the only chance for her is
to send her to a hospital in New York City where the experts can get a crack at
her. But by this time, what with all his overhead, The Lemon Drop Kid is as
clean as a jaybird, and he has no idea where he can get his dukes on any money
in these parts, and it will cost a couple of C's, for low, to do what Doc
Abernathy suggests.</p>

<p>Finally, The Lemon Drop Kid asks old Martin Potter if he can see his way
clear to making him an advance on his salary, which still remains ten bobs per
week, but Martin Potter laughs, and says he not only cannot see his way clear
to doing such a thing, but that if conditions do not improve he is going to cut
The Lemon Drop Kid off altogether. Furthermore, about this time the guy who
owns the little house drops around and reminds The Lemon Drop Kid that he is
now in arrears for two months' rent, amounting in all to twelve bobs, and if
The Lemon Drop Kid is not able to meet this obligation shortly, he will have to
vacate.</p>

<p>So one way and another The Lemon Drop Kid is in quite a quandary, and Miss
Alicia Deering is getting worse by the minute, and finally The Lemon Drop Kid
hoofs and hitch-hikes a matter of maybe a hundred and fifty miles to New York
City, with the idea of going out to Belmont Park, where the giddy-aps are now
running, figuring he may be able to make some kind of a scratch around there,
but he no sooner lights on Broadway than he runs into a guy he knows by the
name of Short Boy, and this Short Boy pulls him into a doorway, and says to him
like this:</p>

<p>'Listen, Lemon Drop,' Short Boy says, 'I do not know what it is you do to
old Rarus P. Griggsby, and I do not wish to know, but it must be something
terrible, indeed, as he has every elbow around the race tracks laying for you
for the past couple of years. You know Rarus P. Griggsby has great weight
around these tracks, and you must commit murder the way he is after you. Why,'
Short Boy says, 'only last week over in Maryland, Whitey Jordan, the track
copper, asks me if ever I hear of you, and I tell him I understand you are in
Australia. Keep away from the tracks,' Short Boy says, 'or you will wind up in
the clink.'</p>

<p>So The Lemon Drop Kid hoofs and hitch-hikes back to Kibbsville, as he does
not wish to become involved in any trouble at this time, and the night he gets
back home is the same night a masked guy with a big six pistol in his duke
steps into the lobby of the Commercial Hotel and sticks up the night clerk and
half a dozen citizens who are sitting around in the lobby, including old Jonas
Deering, and robs the damper of over sixty bobs, and it is also the same night
that Miss Alicia Deering's baby is born dead, and old Doc Abernathy afterwards
claims that it is all because the experts cannot get a crack at Miss Alicia
Deering a matter of about twelve hours earlier.</p>

<p>And it is along in the morning after this night, around four bells, that
Miss Alicia Deering finally opens her eyes, and see The Lemon Drop Kid sitting
beside her bed in the little house, crying very hard, and it is the first time
The Lemon Drop Kid is levelling with his crying since the time one of the
attendants in the orphans' asylum in Jersey City gives him a good belting years
before.</p>

<p>Then Miss Alicia Deering motions to The Lemon Drop Kid to bend down so she
can whisper to him, and what Miss Alicia Deering whispers, soft and low, is the
following:</p>

<p>'Do not cry, Kid,' she whispers. 'Be a good boy after I am gone, Kid, and
never forget I love you, and take good care of poor papa.'</p>

<p>And then Miss Alicia Deering closes her eyes for good and all, and The Lemon
Drop Kid sits there beside her, watching her face until some time later he
hears a noise at the front door of the little house, and he opens the door to
find old Sheriff Higginbotham waiting there, and after they stand looking at
each other a while, the sheriff speaks as follows:</p>

<p>'Well, son,' Sheriff Higginbotham says, 'I am sorry, but I guess you will
have to come along with me. We find the vinegar barrel spigot wrapped in tin
foil that you use for a gun in the back yard here where you throw it last
night.'</p>

<p>'All right,' The Lemon Drop Kid says. 'All right, Sheriff. But how do you
come to think of me in the first place?'</p>

<p>'Well,' Sheriff Higginbotham says, 'I do not suppose you recall doing it,
and the only guy in the hotel lobby that notices it is nobody but your
papa-in-law, Jonas Deering, but,' he says, 'while you are holding your
home-made pistol with one hand last night, you reach into the side pocket of
your coat with the other hand and take out a lemon drop and pop it into your
mouth.'</p>

<p>I run into The Lemon Drop Kid out on the lawn at Hialeah in Miami last
winter, and I am sorry to see that the twoer he does in Auburn leaves plenty of
lines in his face, and a lot of grey in his hair.</p>

<p>But of course I do not refer to this, nor do I mention that he is the
subject of considerable criticism from many citizens for turning over to Miss
Alicia Deering's papa a purse of three C's that we raise to pay a mouthpiece
for his defence.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I do not tell The Lemon Drop Kid that he is also criticised in
some quarters for his action while in the sneezer at Auburn in sending the old
guy the few bobs he is able to gather in by making and selling knick-knacks of
one kind and another to visitors, until finally Jonas Deering saves him any
more bother by up and passing away of too much applejack.</p>

<p>The way I look at it, every guy knows his own business best, so I only duke
The Lemon Drop Kid, and say I am glad to see him, and we are standing there
carving up a few old scores, when all of a sudden there is a great commotion
and out of the crowd around us on the lawn comes an old guy with a big white
mouser, and bristly white eyebrows, and as he grabs The Lemon Drop Kid by the
arm, I am somewhat surprised to see that it is nobody but old Rarus P.
Griggsby, without his wheel chair, and to hear him speak as follows:</p>

<p>'Well, well, well, well, well!' Rarus P. Griggsby says to The Lemon Drop
Kid. 'At last I find you,' he says. 'Where are you hiding all these years? Do
you not know I have detectives looking for you high and low because I wish to
pay you the reward I offer for anybody curing me of my arthritis? Yes,' Rarus
P. Griggsby says, 'the medicine you give me at Saratoga which tastes like a
lemon drop, works fine, although,' he says, 'my seven doctors all try to tell
me it is nothing but their efforts finally getting in their work, while the
city of Saratoga is attempting to cut in and claim credit for its waters.</p>

<p>'But,' Rarus P. Griggsby says, 'I know it is your medicine, and if it is not
your medicine, it is your scallawaggery that makes me so hot that I forget my
arthritis, and never remember it since, so it is all one and the same thing.
Anyway, you now have forty-nine hundred dollars coming from me, for of course I
must hold out the hundred out of which you swindle me,' he says.</p>

<p>Well, The Lemon Drop Kid stands looking at Rarus P. Griggsby and listening
to him, and finally The Lemon Drop Kid begins to laugh in his low voice,
ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, but somehow there does not seem to be any laughter in the
laugh, and I cannot bear to hear it, so I move away leaving Rarus P. Griggsby
and The Lemon Drop Kid there together.</p>

<p>I look back only once, and I see The Lemon Drop Kid stop laughing long
enough to take a lemon drop out of the side pocket of his coat and pop it into
his mouth, and then he goes on laughing, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.</p>

<h3><a name="What_No_Butler" id="What_No_Butler">What, No Butler?</a></h3>
<p>To look at Ambrose Hammer, the newspaper scribe, you will never suspect that
he has sense enough to pound sand in a rat hole, but Ambrose is really a pretty
slick guy. In fact, Ambrose is a great hand for thinking, and the way I find
this out makes quite a story.</p>

<p>It begins about seven o'clock one May morning when I am standing at the
corner of Fiftieth Street and Broadway, and along comes Ambrose with his neck
all tied up as if he has a sore throat, and he gives me a large hello in a
hoarse tone of voice.</p>

<p>Then we stand there together, speaking of the beautiful sunrise, and one
thing and another, and of how we wish we have jobs that will let us enjoy the
daylight more, although personally I do not have any job to begin with, and if
there is one thing I hate and despise it is the daylight, and the chances are
this goes for Ambrose, too.</p>

<p>In fact, in all the years I know Ambrose, I never catch him out in the
daylight more than two or three times, and then it is when we are both on our
way home and happen to meet up as we do this morning I am talking about. And
always Ambrose is telling me what a tough life he leads, and how his nerves are
all shot to pieces, although I hear the only time Ambrose's nerves really
bother him is once when he goes to Florida for a vacation, and has a nervous
breakdown from the quiet that is around and about those parts.</p>

<p>This Ambrose Hammer is a short, chubby guy, with big, round, googly eyes,
and a very innocent expression, and in fact it is this innocent expression that
causes many guys to put Ambrose away as slightly dumb, because it does not seem
possible that a guy who is around Broadway as long as Ambrose can look so
innocent unless he is dumb.</p>

<p>He is what is called a dramatic critic by trade, and his job is to write
pieces for the paper about the new plays that somebody is always producing on
Broadway, and Ambrose's pieces are very interesting, indeed, as he loves to
heave the old harpoon into actors if they do not act to suit him, and as it
will take a combination of Katherine Cornell, Jimmy Durante and Lillian Gish to
really suit Ambrose, he is generally in there harpooning away very good.</p>

<p>Well, while we are standing on the corner boosting the daylight, who comes
along but a plain-clothes copper by the name of Marty Kerle, and he stops to
give us a big good morning. Personally, I have no use for coppers, even if they
are in plain clothes, but I believe in being courteous to them at all times, so
I give Marty a big good morning right back at him, and ask him what he is doing
out and about at such an hour, and Marty states as follows:</p>

<p>'Why,' Marty says, 'some doll who claims she is housekeeper for Mr. Justin
Veezee just telephones the station that she finds Mr. Justin Veezee looking as
if he is very dead in his house over here in West Fifty-sixth Street, and I am
going there to investigate this rumour. Maybe,' Marty says, 'you will wish to
come along with me.'</p>

<p>'Mr. Justin Veezee?' Ambrose Hammer says. 'Why, my goodness gracious, this
cannot be true, because I hear he is in the Club Soudan only a few hours ago
watching the Arabian acrobatic dancer turn flip-flops, and one thing and
another, although personally,' Ambrose says, 'I do not think she is any more
Arabian than Miss Ethel Barrymore.'</p>

<p>But of course if Mr. Justin Veezee is dead, it is a nice item of news for
Ambrose Hammer to telephone in to his paper, so he tells Marty he will be
delighted to go with him, for one, and I decide to go too, as I will rather be
looking at a dead guy than at guys hurrying to work at such an hour.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I am secretly hoping that the housekeeper does not make any
mistake, as I can think of nothing nicer than seeing Mr. Justin Veezee dead,
unless maybe it is two or three Mr. Justin Veezees dead, for personally I
consider Mr. Justin Veezee nothing but an old stinker.</p>

<p>In fact, everybody in this town considers Mr. Justin Veezee nothing but an
old stinker, because for many years he is along Broadway, in and out, and up
and down, and always he is on the grab for young dolls such as work in night
clubs and shows, and especially young dolls who do not have brains enough to
realize that Mr. Justin Veezee is nothing but an old stinker. And of course
there is always a fresh crop of such dolls coming to Broadway every year, and
in fact it is getting so nowadays that there are several crops per year.</p>

<p>But although it is well known to one and all that Mr. Justin Veezee is
nothing but an old stinker, nobody ever dasts speak of this matter out loud, as
Mr. Justin Veezee has plenty of potatoes, which come down to him from his papa,
and it is considered very disrespectful along Broadway to speak of a guy with
plenty of potatoes as an old stinker, even if he is as tight with his potatoes
as Mr. Justin Veezee, which is very, very, very, very tight, indeed.</p>

<p>Now, the house in West Fifty-sixth Street where Mr. Justin Veezee lives is
between Fifth and Sixth Avenues, and is once the private home of the Veezee
family when there is quite a raft of Veezees around, but it seems that these
Veezees all die off one by one, except Mr. Justin Veezee, and so he finally
turns the old home into an apartment house.</p>

<p>It is a very nice-looking building, maybe four or five stories high, with
apartments on each floor, and Mr. Justin Veezee's apartment is on the first
floor above the street, and takes in the whole floor, although this does not
mean so much space at that, as the house is very narrow.</p>

<p>It is one of these apartment houses where you push a button at the front
door on the street floor, and this push rings a bell in the apartment you are
after, and then somebody in the apartment pushes a button up there, and this
unlocks the front door, and you walk up the stairs to where you are going, as
there is no elevator, and no doorman, either.</p>

<p>Well, anyway, it is in the front room of Mr. Justin Veezee's apartment that
we see Mr. Justin Veezee himself. He is sitting straight up in a big easy-chair
beside a table on which there is a stack of these pictures called etchings, and
he has on evening clothes, and his eyes are wide open and bugging out of his
head, as if he is totally amazed at something he sees, and the chances are he
is, at that.</p>

<p>There is no doubt whatever but that Mr. Justin Veezee is very dead, indeed,
and Marty Kerle says we are not to touch anything until the medical examiner
has a peek, although by the time he says this, Ambrose Hammer is looking the
etchings over with great interest, as Ambrose is such a guy as dearly loves to
look at works of art.</p>

<p>The housekeeper who calls up the station is present when we arrive, but she
turns out to be nothing but an old tomato by the name of Mrs. Swanson, who does
not live in Mr. Justin Veezee's house, but who comes every morning at an early
hour to clean up the joint. And this Mrs. Swanson states that she finds Mr.
Justin Veezee just as he is when she comes in on this particular morning,
although she says that usually he is in the hay pounding his ear at such an
hour.</p>

<p>She thinks maybe he falls asleep in the chair, and tries to roust him out,
but as Mr. Justin Veezee does not say aye, yes, or no, she figures the chances
are he is dead, and so she gives the gendarmes a buzz.</p>

<p>'Well,' I say to Ambrose Hammer, 'this is a most ghastly scene, indeed. In
fact, Mr. Justin Veezee looks worse dead than he does alive, which I will never
consider possible. The chances are this guy dies of old age. He must be fifty,
if he is a day,' I say.</p>

<p>'No,' Ambrose says, 'he does not die of old age. The way I look at it, this
is a case of homicide. Somebody gets in here and cools off Mr. Justin Veezee,
and it is a very dirty trick if you ask me, because,' Ambrose says, 'they do
not give Mr. Justin Veezee a chance to change into something more comfortable
than a dinner jacket.'</p>

<p>Well, Ambrose says he will look around and see if he can locate any clues,
and while he is snooping around the joint in comes a guy from the medical
examiner's office and takes a gander at Mr. Justin Veezee. And the guy states
at once that Mr. Justin Veezee is positively dead, although nobody is giving
him any argument on this point, and he further states that what kills Mr.
Justin Veezee is nothing but a broken neck.</p>

<p>Right away this broken neck becomes a very great mystery, because it does
not stand to reason that a guy can break his own neck sitting down, unless
maybe he is practising to be a contortionist, and nobody figures it possible
that Mr. Justin Veezee is practising to be a contortionist at his age.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the medical guy finds certain marks on Mr. Justin Veezee's neck
which he claims show that somebody grabs Mr. Justin Veezee by the guzzle and
cracks his neck for him as if he is nothing but a goose, and the medical guy
says it must be somebody with very strong dukes to play such a prank on Mr.
Justin Veezee.</p>

<p>Well, Ambrose Hammer seems to be all heated up about this whole matter,
although personally I cannot see where it is any of his put-in. The way I look
at it, Mr. Justin Veezee is no price any way you take him when he is alive and
kicking, and his death does not change the betting any as far as I am
concerned, because I know from the things I see of Mr. Justin Veezee, and the
things I hear of him, that he is still an old stinker, in spades.</p>

<p>Ambrose tells me that he is certainly going to solve this mystery in the
interests of justice, and I tell him that the only way to solve a murder
mystery is to suspect everybody in town, beginning with the old tomato who
discovers the remains of Mr. Justin Veezee, and winding up with the gendarmes
who investigate the case.</p>

<p>'But,' I say to Ambrose Hammer, 'you do not pin the foul deed on any of
these parties, but on the butler, because this is the way these things are done
in all the murder-mystery movies and plays I ever see, and also in all the
murder-mystery books I ever read.'</p>

<p>Well, at this Marty Kerle, the plain-clothes copper, states that the only
trouble with my idea is that there is no butler connected with Mr. Justin
Veezee's establishment in any way, shape, manner, or form, and when I tell
Ambrose that maybe we can hire a butler to double in murder for us, Ambrose
becomes very indignant, and speaks to me as follows:</p>

<p>'No butler commits this murder,' Ambrose says, 'and, furthermore, I do not
consider your remarks in good taste, no matter if you are joking, or what. I am
convinced that this crime is the work of nobody but a doll, because of certain
clues I encounter in my survey of the premises.'</p>

<p>But Ambrose will not tell me what these clues are, and personally I do not
care, because the way I look at it, even if some doll does give Mr. Justin
Veezee the business, it is only retribution for what Mr. Justin Veezee does to
other dolls in his time.</p>

<p>Well, the scragging of Mr. Justin Veezee is a very great sensation, and the
newspapers make quite a lot of it, because there is no doubt but what it is the
greatest mystery in this town in several weeks. Furthermore, anybody that ever
as much as speaks to Mr. Justin Veezee in the past twenty years becomes very
sorry for it when the newspapers commence printing their names and pictures,
and especially any dolls who have any truck with Mr. Justin Veezee in the past,
for naturally the newspaper scribes and the gendarmes are around asking them
where they are at such and such an hour on such and such a date, and it is
quite amazing how few guys and dolls can remember this off-hand, especially
dolls.</p>

<p>In fact, pretty soon the scragging of Mr. Justin Veezee becomes one of the
most embarrassing propositions that ever comes off east of the Mississippi
River, and many citizens are thinking of going out and scragging somebody else
just to take the attention of the scribes and the gendarmes away from Mr.
Justin Veezee.</p>

<p>As near as anybody can find out, the last party to see Mr. Justin Veezee
alive the morning he is scragged is a red-headed doll at the Club Soudan by the
name of Sorrel-top, and who is by no means a bad-looking doll, if you like them
red-headed. This Sorrel-top is in charge of the check-room where one and all
are supposed to check their hats and coats on entering the Club Soudan, and to
tip Sorrel-top a shilling or two when they go out for keeping cases on these
articles.</p>

<p>It seems that Sorrel-top always remembers when Mr. Justin Veezee leaves the
Club Soudan, because he never stakes her to as much as a thin dime when he
calls for his kady, and naturally Sorrel-top is bound to remember such a guy,
especially as he is the only guy in the United States of America who dasts pass
up Sorrel-top in this manner.</p>

<p>So she remembers that Mr. Justin Veezee leaves the Club Soudan on the
morning in question around three bells, and the chances are he walks home, as
none of the taxi jockeys who hang out in front of the Club Soudan remember
seeing him, and, anyway, it is only a few blocks from the club to Mr. Justin
Veezee's house, and it is a cinch he is never going to pay money to ride in a
taxi just a few blocks.</p>

<p>Now it comes out that there are only two entrances to Mr. Justin Veezee's
apartment, and one entrance is the front door, but the other entrance is a back
door, but the back door is locked and barred on the inside when Mr. Justin
Veezee is found, while the front door is locked with a patent snap lock, and
Mrs. Swanson, the old tomato who does the housekeeping for Mr. Justin Veezee,
states that she and Mr. Justin Veezee have the only two keys in the world to
this lock that she knows of, although of course the parties who live in the
other apartments in the house have keys to the street door, and so has the old
tomato.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the windows of Mr. Justin Veezee's apartment are all locked on
the inside, and there seems to be no way whatever that anybody except Mr.
Justin Veezee and the old tomato can get in this apartment, and the gendarmes
begin looking at the old tomato very suspiciously, indeed, until she digs up a
milkman by the name of Schmalz, who sees her going into the apartment house
about six-thirty in the morning, and then sees her a few minutes later come
tearing out of the joint yelling watch, murder, police, and the medical guys
say there is no chance she can guzzle Mr. Justin Veezee in this time, unless
she is a faster worker than anybody they ever hear of in all their days.</p>

<p>Anyway, nobody can figure a motive for the old tomato to guzzle Mr. Justin
Veezee, although a couple of the newspaper scribes try to make out that maybe
she is an ever-loving sweetheart of Mr. Justin Veezee in the long ago, and that
he does her dirt. Personally, I consider this proposition reasonable enough,
because it is a sure thing that if the old tomato is ever Mr. Justin Veezee's
sweetheart, he is just naturally bound to do her dirt. But the old tomato seems
so depressed over losing a customer for her housekeeping that finally nobody
pays any more attention to her, and one and all go looking around for someone
else who may have a motive for giving Mr. Justin Veezee the business.</p>

<p>Well, it comes out that there are a large number of parties, including both
male and female, in this part of the country who figure to have a motive for
giving Mr. Justin Veezee the business, but they are all able to prove they are
some place else when this matter comes off, so the mystery keeps getting more
mysterious by the minute, especially as the gendarmes say there is no chance
that robbery is the motive, because Mr. Justin Veezee has all his jewellery on
him and plenty of potatoes in his pockets when he is found, and nothing in the
apartment seems disturbed.</p>

<p>Furthermore, they find no finger-prints around and about, except some that
turn out to belong to Ambrose Hammer, and at that Ambrose has a tough time
explaining that he makes these fingerprints after Mr. Justin Veezee is found,
and not before. They find most of Ambrose's finger-prints on the etchings, and
personally I am glad I am not around fingering anything while I am in the
joint, as the gendarmes may not listen to my explanations as easy as they
listen to Ambrose.</p>

<p>Well, I do not see Ambrose for several nights, but it seems that this is
because there are some shows opening around town and Ambrose is busy harpooning
the actors. Finally one night he comes looking for me, and he states that as I
am with him when he starts working on the mystery of who gives Mr. Justin
Veezee the business, it is only fair that I be present when he exposes the
party who commits this dastardly deed. And, Ambrose says, the hour now arrives,
and although I do my best to show Ambrose that there can be no percentage for
him in hollering copper on anybody in this matter, nothing will do but I must
go with him.</p>

<p>And where does he take me but to the Club Soudan, and as it is early in the
evening there are very few customers in the joint when we arrive, as the Club
Soudan does not heat up good until along about midnight. Furthermore, I judge
that the customers are strangers in the city, as they seem to be partaking of
food, and nobody who is not a stranger in the city will think of partaking of
food in the Club Soudan, although the liquor there is by no means bad.</p>

<p>Well, Ambrose and I get to talking to a character by the name of Flat-wheel
Walter, who has a small piece of the joint, and who is called by this name
because he walks with a gimp on one side, and by and by Ambrose asks for the
Arabian acrobatic dancer, and Flat-wheel says she is at this time in her
dressing-room making up for her dance. So Ambrose takes me up a flight of
stairs to a little room, which is one of several little rooms along a hallway,
and sure enough, there is this Arabian acrobatic dancer making up.</p>

<p>And the way she is making up is by taking off her clothes, because it seems
that an Arabian acrobatic dancer cannot dance with anything on except maybe a
veil or two, and personally I am somewhat embarrassed by the spectacle of a
doll taking off her clothes to make up, especially an Arabian. But Ambrose
Hammer does not seem to mind, as he is greatly calloused to such scenes because
of his experience with the modern stage, and, anyway, the Arabian manages to
get a few veils around her before I can really find any grounds for complaint.
But I wish to say that I am greatly surprised when I hear this Arabian dancer
speak in very good English, and in fact with a Brooklyn accent, and as
follows:</p>

<p>'Oh, Ambrose,' she says, 'I am so glad to see you again.'</p>

<p>With this she makes out as if to put her arms around Ambrose Hammer, but
then she remembers just in time that if she does this she will have to let go
her hold of the veils and, anyway, Ambrose pulls away from her and stands
looking at her with a very strange expression on his kisser.</p>

<p>Well, I will say one thing for Ambrose Hammer, and this is that he is at all
times very gentlemanly, and he introduces me to the Arabian acrobatic dancer,
and I notice that he speaks of her as Miss Cleghorn, although I remember that
they bill her in lights in front of the Club Soudan as Illah-Illah, which is
maybe her first name.</p>

<p>Now Ambrose gazes at Miss Cleghorn most severely, and then he speaks:</p>

<p>'The game is up,' Ambrose says. 'If you wish to confess to me and this
party, well and good, otherwise you will tell your story to the gendarmes. I
know you kill Mr. Justin Veezee, and,' Ambrose says, 'while you may have an
excellent excuse, it is against the law.'</p>

<p>Well, at this Miss Cleghorn turns very pale, indeed, and begins trembling so
she almost forgets to hold on to her veils, and then she sits down in a chair
and breathes so hard you will think she just finishes a tough tenth round.
Naturally, I am somewhat surprised by Ambrose's statement, because up to this
time I am not figuring Miss Cleghorn as such a doll as will harm a flea,
although of course I will never lay a price against this proposition on any
doll without having something of a line on her.</p>

<p>'Yes,' Ambrose says, speaking very severely, indeed, to Miss Cleghorn, 'you
make an appointment to go to Mr. Justin Veezee's apartment the other morning
after you get through with your Arabian acrobatic dancing here, to look at his
etchings. I am surprised you fall for etchings, but I am glad you do, at that,
because it gives me my first clue. No guy is hauling out etchings at four
o'clock in the morning to look at them by himself,' Ambrose says. 'It is one of
the oldest build-ups of a doll in the world,' he says.</p>

<p>'Well,' Ambrose goes on, 'you look at Mr. Justin Veezee's etchings. They are
very bad. In fact, they are terrible. But never mind this. Presently you
struggle. You are very strong on account of your Arabian acrobatic dancing.
Yes,' Ambrose says, 'you are very, very, very strong. In this struggle you
break Mr. Justin Veezee's neck, and now he is extremely dead. It is all very
sad,' Ambrose says.</p>

<p>Now, I wish to state that I am greatly mortified at being present at this
scene, because if I know what Ambrose Hammer says he knows about Miss Cleghorn,
I will keep my trap closed, especially as there is no reward offered for any
information leading to the apprehension of the party who gives Mr. Justin
Veezee the business, but Ambrose is undoubtedly a very law-abiding guy, and the
chances are he feels he is only doing his duty in this matter, and,
furthermore, he may get a nice item for his paper out of it.</p>

<p>But when he tells Miss Cleghorn that she is guilty of this unladylike
conduct toward Mr. Justin Veezee, she gets up out of her chair, still holding
on to her veils, and speaks to Ambrose Hammer like this:</p>

<p>'No, Ambrose,' she says, 'you are wrong. I do not kill Mr. Justin Veezee. I
admit I go to his apartment, but not to see his etchings. I go there to have a
bite to eat with him, because Mr. Justin Veezee swears to me that his
housekeeper will be present, and I do not know he is deceiving me until after I
arrive there. Mr. Justin Veezee gets out his etchings later when he can think
of nothing else. But even Mr. Justin Veezee is not so old-fashioned as to
believe any doll will go to his apartment just to look at etchings nowadays. I
admit we struggle, but,' Miss Cleghorn says, 'I do not kill him.'</p>

<p>'Well,' Ambrose says, 'if you do not think Mr. Justin Veezee is dead, a
dollar will win you a trip around the world.'</p>

<p>'Yes,' Miss Cleghorn says, 'I know he is dead. He is dead when I leave the
apartment. I am very, very sorry for this, but I tell you again I do not kill
him.'</p>

<p>'Well,' Ambrose says, 'then who does kill Mr. Justin Veezee?'</p>

<p>'This I will never, never tell,' Miss Cleghorn says.</p>

<p>Now, naturally, Ambrose Hammer becomes very indignant at this statement, and
he tells Miss Cleghorn that if she will not tell him she will have to tell the
gendarmes, and she starts in to cry like I do not know what, when all of a
sudden the door of the dressing-room opens, and in comes a big, stout-built,
middle-aged-looking guy, who does not seem any too well dressed, and who speaks
as follows:</p>

<p>'Pardon the intrusion, gentlemen,' the guy says, 'but I am waiting in the
next room and cannot help overhearing your conversation. I am waiting there
because Miss Cleghorn is going to draw enough money off her employers to get me
out of this part of the country. My name,' the guy says, 'is Riggsby. I am the
party who kills Mr. Justin Veezee.'</p>

<p>Well, naturally Ambrose Hammer is greatly surprised by these remarks, and so
am I, but before either of us can express ourselves, the guy goes on like
this:</p>

<p>'I am a roomer in the humble home of Mrs. Swanson in Ninth Avenue,' he says.
'I learn all about Mr. Justin Veezee from her. I sneak her key to the street
door of Mr. Justin Veezee's house, and her key to the door of Mr. Justin
Veezee's apartment one day and get copies of them made, and put the originals
back before she misses them. I am hiding in Mr. Justin Veezee's apartment the
other morning waiting to stick him up.</p>

<p>'Well,' the guy says, 'Mr. Justin Veezee comes in alone, and I am just about
to step out on him and tell him to get them up, when in comes Miss Cleghorn,
although of course I do not know at the time who she is. I can hear everything
they say, and I see at once from their conversation that Miss Cleghorn is there
under false pretences. She finally wishes to leave, and Mr. Justin Veezee
attacks her. She fights valiantly, and in just a straightaway hand-to-hand
struggle, I will relish a small bet on her against Mr. Justin Veezee, or any
other guy. But Mr. Justin Veezee picks up a bronze statuette and is about to
bean her with it, so,' the middle-aged guy says, 'I step into it.</p>

<p>'Well,' he says, 'I guess maybe I am a little rougher with Mr. Justin Veezee
than I mean to be, because I find myself putting a nice flying-mare hold on him
and hurling him across the room. I fear the fall injures him severely. Anyway,
when I pick him up he seems to be dead. So I sit him up in a chair, and take a
bath towel and wipe out any chance of finger-prints around and about, and then
escort Miss Cleghorn to her home.</p>

<p>'I do not intend to kill Mr. Justin Veezee,' the middle-aged-looking guy
says. 'I only intend to rob him, and I am very sorry he is no longer with us,
especially as I cannot now return and carry out my original plan. But,' he
says, 'I cannot bear to see you hand Miss Cleghorn over to the law, although I
hope and trust she will never be so foolish as to go visiting the apartments of
such characters as Mr. Justin Veezee again.'</p>

<p>'Yes,' Ambrose Hammer says to Miss Cleghorn, 'why do you go there in the
first place?' Well, at this Miss Cleghorn begins crying harder than ever, and
between sobs she states to Ambrose Hammer as follows:</p>

<p>'Oh, Ambrose,' she says, 'it is because I love you so. You do not come
around to see me for several nights, and I accept Mr. Justin Veezee's
invitation hoping you will hear of it, and become jealous.'</p>

<p>So of course there is nothing for Ambrose Hammer to do but take her in his
arms and start whispering to her in such terms as guys are bound to whisper
under these circumstances, and I motion the middle-aged-looking guy to go
outside, as I consider this scene far too sacred for a stranger to witness.</p>

<p>Then about this time, Miss Cleghorn gets a call to go downstairs and do a
little Arabian acrobatic dancing for the customers of the Club Soudan, and so
she leaves us without ever once forgetting in all this excitement to keep a
hold on her veils, although I am watching at all times to remind her in case
her memory fails her in this respect.</p>

<p>And then I ask Ambrose Hammer something that is bothering me no little, and
this is how he comes to suspect in the first place that Miss Cleghorn may know
something about the scragging of Mr. Justin Veezee, even allowing that the
etchings give him a clue that a doll is present when the scragging comes off.
And I especially wish to know how he can ever figure Miss Cleghorn even as much
as an outside chance of scragging Mr. Justin Veezee in such a manner as to
break his neck.</p>

<p>'Why,' Ambrose Hammer says, 'I will gladly tell you about this, but only in
strict confidence. The last time I see Miss Cleghorn up to to-night is the
night I invite her to my own apartment to look at etchings, and they are better
etchings than Mr. Justin Veezee shows her, at that. And,' Ambrose says, 'maybe
you remember I am around with my neck tied up for a week.'</p>

<p>Well, the middle-aged-looking guy is waiting for us outside the Club Soudan
when we come out, and Ambrose Hammer stakes him to half a C and tells him to go
as far as he can on this, and I shake hands with him, and wish him luck, and as
he is turning to go, I say to him like this:</p>

<p>'By the way, Mr. Riggsby,' I say, 'what is your regular occupation, anyway,
if I am not too nosey?'</p>

<p>'Oh,' he says, 'until the depression comes on, I am for years rated one of
the most efficient persons in my line in this town. In fact, I have many
references to prove it. Yes,' he says, 'I am considered an exceptionally
high-class butler.'</p>

<h3><a name="The_Three_Wise_Guys" id="The_Three_Wise_Guys">The Three Wise Guys</a></h3>
<p>One cold winter afternoon I am standing at the bar in Good Time Charley's
little drum in West Forty-ninth Street, partaking of a mixture of rock candy
and rye whisky, and this is a most surprising thing for me to be doing, as I am
by no means a rum-pot, and very seldom indulge in alcoholic beverages in any
way, shape, manner, or form.</p>

<p>But when I step into Good Time Charley's on the afternoon in question, I am
feeling as if maybe I have a touch of grippe coming on, and Good Time Charley
tells me that there is nothing in this world as good for a touch of grippe as
rock candy and rye whisky, as it assassinates the germs at once.</p>

<p>It seems that Good Time Charley always keeps a stock of rock candy and rye
whisky on hand for touches of the grippe, and he gives me a few doses
immediately, and in fact Charley takes a few doses with me, as he says there is
no telling but what I am scattering germs of my touch of the grippe all around
the joint, and he must safeguard his health. We are both commencing to feel
much better when the door opens, and who comes in but a guy by the name of
Blondy Swanson.</p>

<p>This Blondy Swanson is a big, six-foot-two guy, with straw-coloured hair,
and pink cheeks, and he is originally out of Harlem, and it is well known to
one and all that in his day he is the largest puller on the Atlantic seaboard.
In fact, for upwards of ten years, Blondy is bringing wet goods into New York
from Canada, and one place and another, and in all this time he never gets a
fall, which is considered a phenomenal record for an operator as extensive as
Blondy.</p>

<p>Well, Blondy steps up alongside me at the bar, and I ask him if he cares to
have a few doses of rock candy and rye whisky with me and Good Time Charley,
and Blondy says he will consider it a privilege and a pleasure, because, he
says, he always has something of a sweet tooth. So we have these few doses, and
I say to Blondy Swanson that I hope and trust that business is thriving with
him.</p>

<p>'I have no business,' Blondy Swanson says, 'I retire from business.'</p>

<p>Well, if J. Pierpont Morgan, or John D. Rockefeller, or Henry Ford step up
and tell me they retire from business, I will not be more astonished than I am
by this statement from Blondy Swanson, and in fact not as much. I consider
Blondy's statement the most important commercial announcement I hear in many
years, and naturally I ask him why he makes such a decision, and what is to
become of thousands of citizens who are dependent on him for merchandise.</p>

<p>'Well,' Blondy says, 'I retire from business because I am one hundred per
cent American citizen. In fact,' he says, 'I am a patriot. I serve my country
in the late war. I am cited at Chateau Thierry. I always vote the straight
Democratic ticket, except,' he says, 'when we figure it better to elect some
Republican. I always stand up when the band plays the Star Spangled Banner. One
year I even pay an income tax,' Blondy says.</p>

<p>And of course I know that many of these things are true, although I remember
hearing rumours that if the draft officer is along half an hour later than he
is, he will not see Blondy for heel dust, and that what Blondy is cited for at
Chateau-Thierry is for not robbing the dead.</p>

<p>But of course I do not speak of these matters to Blondy Swanson, because
Blondy is not such a guy as will care to listen to rumours, and may become
indignant, and when Blondy is indignant he is very difficult to get along
with.</p>

<p>'Now,' Blondy says, 'I am a bootie for a long time, and supply very fine
merchandise to my trade, as everybody knows, and it is a respectable business,
because one and all in this country are in favour of it, except the
prohibitionists. But,' he says, 'I can see into the future, and I can see that
one of these days they are going to repeal the prohibition law, and then it
will be most unpatriotic to be bringing in wet goods from foreign parts in
competition with home industry. So I retire,' Blondy says.</p>

<p>'Well, Blondy,' I say, 'your sentiments certainly do you credit, and if we
have more citizens as high-minded as you are, this will be a better
country.'</p>

<p>'Furthermore,' Blondy says, 'there is no money in booting any more. All the
booties in this country are broke. I am broke myself,' he says. 'I just lose
the last piece of property I own in the world, which is the twenty-five-G home
I build in Atlantic City, figuring to spend the rest of my days there with Miss
Clarabelle Cobb, before she takes a runout powder on me. Well,' Blondy says,
'if I only listen to Miss Clarabelle Cobb, I will now be an honest clerk in a
gents' furnishing store, with maybe a cute little apartment up around One
Hundred and Tenth Street, and children running all around and about.'</p>

<p>And with this, Blondy sighs heavily, and I sigh with him, because the
romance of Blondy Swanson and Miss Clarabelle Cobb is well known to one and all
on Broadway.</p>

<p>It goes back a matter of anyway six years when Blondy Swanson is making
money so fast he can scarcely stop to count it, and at this time Miss
Clarabelle Cobb is the most beautiful doll in this town, and many citizens
almost lose their minds just gazing at her when she is a member of Mr. Georgie
White's 'Scandals,' including Blondy Swanson.</p>

<p>In fact, after Blondy Swanson sees Miss Clarabelle Cobb in just one
performance of Mr. Georgie White's 'Scandals,' he is never quite the same guy
again. He goes to a lot of bother meeting up with Miss Clarabelle Cobb, and
then he takes to hanging out around Mr. Georgie White's stage door, and sending
Miss Clarabelle Cobb ten-pound boxes of candy, and floral horseshoes, and
wreaths, and also packages of trinkets, including such articles as diamond
bracelets, and brooches, and vanity cases, for there is no denying that Blondy
is a fast guy with a dollar.</p>

<p>But it seems that Miss Clarabelle Cobb will not accept any of these
offerings, except the candy and the flowers, and she goes so far as to return a
sable coat that Blondy sends her one very cold day, and she is openly
criticised for this action by some of the other dolls in Mr. Georgie White's
'Scandals,' for they say that after all there is a limit even to
eccentricity.</p>

<p>But Miss Clarabelle Cobb states that she is not accepting valuable offerings
from any guy, and especially a guy who is engaged in trafficking in the demon
rum, because she says that his money is nothing but blood money that comes from
breaking the law of the land, although, as a matter of fact, this is a dead
wrong rap against Blondy Swanson, as he never handles a drop of rum in his
life, but only Scotch, and furthermore he keeps himself pretty well
straightened out with the law.</p>

<p>The idea is, Miss Clarabelle Cobb comes of very religious people back in
Akron, Ohio, and she is taught from childhood that rum is a terrible thing, and
personally I think it is myself, except in cocktails, and furthermore, the last
thing her mamma tells her when she leaves for New York is to beware of any guys
who come around offering her diamond bracelets and fur coats, because her mamma
says such guys are undoubtedly snakes in the grass, and probably on the
make.</p>

<p>But while she will not accept his offerings, Miss Clarabelle Cobb does not
object to going out with Blondy Swanson now and then, and putting on the
chicken Mexicaine, and the lobster Newburg, and other items of this nature, and
any time you put a good-looking young guy and a beautiful doll together over
the chicken Mexicaine and the lobster Newburg often enough, you are apt to have
a case of love on your hands.</p>

<p>And this is what happens to Blondy Swanson and Miss Clarabelle Cobb, and in
fact they become in love more than somewhat, and Blondy Swanson is wishing to
marry Miss Clarabelle Cobb, but one night over a batch of lobster Newburg, she
says to him like this:</p>

<p>'Blondy,' she says, 'I love you, and,' she says, 'I will marry you in a
minute if you get out of trafficking in rum. I will marry you if you are out of
the rum business, and do not have a dime, but I will never marry you as long as
you are dealing in rum, no matter if you have a hundred million.'</p>

<p>Well, Blondy says he will get out of the racket at once, and he keeps saying
this every now and then for a year or so, and the chances are that several
times he means it, but when a guy is in this business in those days as strong
as Blondy Swanson it is not so easy for him to get out, even if he wishes to do
so. And then one day Miss Clarabelle Cobb has a talk with Blondy, and says to
him as follows:</p>

<p>'Blondy,' she says, 'I still love you, but you care more for your business
than you do for me. So I am going back to Ohio,' she says. 'I am sick and tired
of Broadway, anyhow. Some day when you are really through with the terrible
traffic you are now engaged in, come to me.'</p>

<p>And with this, Miss Clarabelle Cobb takes plenty of outdoors on Blondy
Swanson, and is seen no more in these parts. At first Blondy thinks she is only
trying to put a little pressure on him, and will be back, but as the weeks
become months, and the months finally count up into years, Blondy can see that
she is by no means clowning with him. Furthermore, he never hears from her, and
all he knows is she is back in Akron, Ohio.</p>

<p>Well, Blondy is always promising himself that he will soon pack in on
hauling wet goods, and go look up Miss Clarabelle Cobb and marry her, but he
keeps putting it off, and putting it off, until finally one day he hears that
Miss Clarabelle Cobb marries some legitimate guy in Akron, and this is a
terrible blow to Blondy, indeed, and from this day he never looks at another
doll again, or anyway not much.</p>

<p>Naturally, I express my deep sympathy to Blondy about being broke, and I
also mention that my heart bleeds for him in his loss of Miss Clarabelle Cobb,
and we have a few doses of rock candy and rye whisky on both propositions, and
by this time Good Time Charley runs out of rock candy, and anyway it is a lot
of bother for him to be mixing it up with the rye whisky, so we have the rye
whisky without the rock candy, and personally I do not notice much
difference.</p>

<p>Well, while we are standing there at the bar having our rye whisky without
the rock candy, who comes in but an old guy by the name of The Dutchman, who is
known to one and all as a most illegal character in every respect. In fact, The
Dutchman has no standing whatever in the community, and I am somewhat surprised
to see him appear in Good Time Charley's, because The Dutchman is generally a
lammie from some place, and the gendarmes everywhere are always anxious to have
a chat with him. The last I hear of The Dutchman he is in college somewhere out
West for highway robbery, although afterwards he tells me it is a case of
mistaken identity. It seems he mistakes a copper in plain clothes for a
grocery-man.</p>

<p>The Dutchman is an old-fashioned-looking guy of maybe fifty-odd, and he has
grey hair, and a stubby grey beard, and he is short, and thickset, and always
good-natured, even when there is no call for it, and to look at him you will
think there is no more harm in him than there is in a preacher, and maybe not
as much.</p>

<p>As The Dutchman comes in, he takes a peek all around and about as if he is
looking for somebody in particular, and when he sees Blondy Swanson he moves up
alongside Blondy and begins whispering to Blondy until Blondy pulls away and
tells him to speak freely.</p>

<p>Now The Dutchman has a very interesting story, and it goes like this: It
seems that about eight or nine months back The Dutchman is mobbed up with a
party of three very classy heavy guys who make quite a good thing of going
around knocking off safes in small-town jugs, and post offices, and stores in
small towns, and taking the money, or whatever else is valuable in these safes.
This is once quite a popular custom in this country, although it dies out to
some extent of late years because they improve the brand of safes so much it is
a lot of bother knocking them off, but it comes back during the depression when
there is no other way of making money, until it is a very prosperous business
again. And of course this is very nice for old-time heavy guys, such as The
Dutchman, because it gives them something to do in their old age.</p>

<p>Anyway, it seems that this party The Dutchman is with goes over into
Pennsylvania one night on a tip from a friend and knocks off a safe in a
factory office, and gets a pay roll amounting to maybe fifty G's. But it seems
that while they are making their getaway in an automobile, the gendarmes take
out after them, and there is a chase, during which there is considerable
blasting back and forth.</p>

<p>Well, finally in this blasting, the three guys with The Dutchman get cooled
off, and The Dutchman also gets shot up quite some, and he abandons the
automobile out on an open road, taking the money, which is in a grip sack, with
him, and he somehow manages to escape the gendarmes by going across country,
and hiding here and there.</p>

<p>But The Dutchman gets pretty well petered out, what with his wounds, and
trying to lug the grip sack, and one night he comes to an old deserted barn,
and he decides to stash the grip sack in this barn, because there is no chance
he can keep lugging it around much longer. So he takes up a few boards in the
floor of the barn, and digs a nice hole in the ground underneath and plants the
grip sack there, figuring to come back some day and pick it up.</p>

<p>Well, The Dutchman gets over into New Jersey one way and another, and lays
up in a town by the name of New Brunswick until his wounds are healed, which
requires considerable time as The Dutchman cannot take it nowadays as good as
he can when he is younger.</p>

<p>Furthermore, even after The Dutchman recovers and gets to thinking of going
after the stashed grip sack, he finds he is about half out of confidence, which
is what happens to all guys when they commence getting old, and he figures that
it may be a good idea to declare somebody else in to help him, and the first
guy he thinks of is Blondy Swanson, because he knows Blondy Swanson is a very
able citizen in every respect.</p>

<p>'Now, Blondy,' The Dutchman says, 'if you like my proposition, I am willing
to cut you in for fifty per cent, and fifty per cent of fifty G's is by no
means pretzels in these times.'</p>

<p>'Well, Dutchman,' Blondy says, 'I will gladly assist you in this enterprise
on the terms you state. It appeals to me as a legitimate proposition, because
there is no doubt this dough is coming to you, and from now on I am strictly
legit. But in the meantime, let us have some more rock candy and rye whisky,
without the rock candy, while we discuss the matter further.'</p>

<p>But it seems that The Dutchman does not care for rock candy and rye whisky,
even without the rock candy, so Blondy Swanson and me and Good Time Charley
continue taking our doses, and Blondy keeps getting more enthusiastic about The
Dutchman's proposition until finally I become enthusiastic myself, and I say I
think I will go along as it is an opportunity to see new sections of the
country, while Good Time Charley states that it will always be the great regret
of his life that his business keeps him from going, but that he will provide us
with an ample store of rock candy and rye whisky, without the rock candy, in
case we run into any touches of the grippe.</p>

<p>Well, anyway, this is how I come to be riding around in an old can belonging
to The Dutchman on a very cold Christmas Eve with The Dutchman and Blondy
Swanson, although none of us happen to think of it being Christmas Eve until we
notice that there seems to be holly wreaths in windows here and there as we go
bouncing along the roads, and finally we pass a little church that is all lit
up, and somebody opens the door as we are passing, and we see a big Christmas
tree inside the church, and it is a very pleasant sight, indeed, and in fact it
makes me a little homesick, although of course the chances are I will not be
seeing any Christmas trees even if I am home.</p>

<p>We leave Good Time Charley's along mid-afternoon, with The Dutchman driving
this old can of his, and all I seem to remember about the trip is going through
a lot of little towns so fast they seem strung together, because most of the
time I am dozing in the back seat.</p>

<p>Blondy Swanson is riding in the front seat with The Dutchman and Blondy also
cops a little snooze now and then as we are going along, but whenever he
happens to wake up he pokes me awake, too, so we can take a dose of rock candy
and rye whisky, without the rock candy. So in many respects it is quite an
enjoyable journey.</p>

<p>I recollect the little church because we pass it right after we go busting
through a pretty fair-sized town, and I hear The Dutchman say the old barn is
now only a short distance away, and by this time it is dark, and colder than a
deputy sheriff's heart, and there is snow on the ground, although it is clear
overhead, and I am wishing I am back in Mindy's restaurant wrapping myself
around a nice T-bone steak, when I hear Blondy Swanson ask The Dutchman if he
is sure he knows where he is going, as this seems to be an untravelled road,
and The Dutchman states as follows:</p>

<p>'Why,' he says, 'I know I am on the right road. I am following the big star
you see up ahead of us, because I remember seeing this star always in front of
me when I am going along the road before.'</p>

<p>So we keep following the star, but it turns out that it is not a star at
all, but a light shining from the window of a ramshackle old frame building
pretty well off to one side of the road and on a rise of ground, and when The
Dutchman sees this light, he is greatly nonplussed, indeed, and speaks as
follows:</p>

<p>'Well,' he says, 'this looks very much like my barn, but my barn does not
call for a light in it. Let us investigate this matter before we go any
farther.'</p>

<p>So The Dutchman gets out of the old can, and slips up to one side of the
building and peeks through the window, and then he comes back and motions for
Blondy and me to also take a peek through this window, which is nothing but a
square hole cut in the side of the building with wooden bars across it, but no
windowpanes, and what we behold inside by the dim light of a lantern hung on a
nail on a post is really most surprising.</p>

<p>There is no doubt whatever that we are looking at the inside of a very old
barn, for there are several stalls for horses, or maybe cows, here and there,
but somebody seems to be living in the barn, as we can see a table, and a
couple of chairs, and a tin stove, in which there is a little fire, and on the
floor in one corner is what seems to be a sort of a bed.</p>

<p>Furthermore, there seems to be somebody lying on the bed and making quite a
fuss in the way of groaning and crying and carrying on generally in a loud tone
of voice, and there is no doubt that it is the voice of a doll, and anybody can
tell that this doll is in some distress.</p>

<p>Well, here is a situation, indeed, and we move away from the barn to talk it
over.</p>

<p>The Dutchman is greatly discouraged, because he gets to thinking that if
this doll is living in the barn for any length of time, his plant may be
discovered. He is willing to go away and wait a while, but Blondy Swanson seems
to be doing quite some thinking, and finally Blondy says like this:</p>

<p>'Why,' Blondy says, 'the doll in this barn seems to be sick, and only a
bounder and a cad will walk away from a sick doll, especially,' Blondy says, 'a
sick doll who is a total stranger to him. In fact, it will take a very large
heel to do such a thing. The idea is for us to go inside and see if we can do
anything for this sick doll,' Blondy says.</p>

<p>Well, I say to Blondy Swanson that the chances are the doll's ever-loving
husband, or somebody, is in town, or maybe over to the nearest neighbours
digging up assistance, and will be back in a jiffy, and that this is no place
for us to be found.</p>

<p>'No,' Blondy says, 'it cannot be as you state. The snow on the ground is
anyway a day old. There are no tracks around the door of this old joint, going
or coming, and it is a cinch if anybody knows there is a sick doll here, they
will have plenty of time to get help before this. I am going inside and look
things over,' Blondy says.</p>

<p>Naturally, The Dutchman and I go too, because we do not wish to be left
alone outside, and it is no trouble whatever to get into the barn, as the door
is unlocked, and all we have to do is walk in. And when we walk in with Blondy
Swanson leading the way, the doll on the bed on the floor half-raises up to
look at us, and although the light of the lantern is none too good, anybody can
see that this doll is nobody but Miss Clarabelle Cobb, although personally I
see some changes in her since she is in Mr. Georgie White's 'Scandals.'</p>

<p>She stays half-raised up on the bed looking at Blondy Swanson for as long as
you can count ten, if you count fast, then she falls back and starts crying and
carrying on again, and at this The Dutchman kneels down on the floor beside her
to find out what is eating her.</p>

<p>All of a sudden The Dutchman jumps up and speaks to us as follows:</p>

<p>'Why,' he says, 'this is quite a delicate situation, to be sure. In fact,'
he says, 'I must request you guys to step outside. What we really need for this
case is a doctor, but it is too late to send for one. However, I will endeavour
to do the best I can under the circumstances.'</p>

<p>Then The Dutchman starts taking off his overcoat, and Blondy Swanson stands
looking at him with such a strange expression on his kisser that The Dutchman
laughs out loud, and says like this: 'Do not worry about anything, Blondy,' The
Dutchman says. 'I am maybe a little out of practice since my old lady put her
checks back in the rack, but she leaves eight kids alive and kicking, and I
bring them all in except one, because we are seldom able to afford a
croaker.'</p>

<p>So Blondy Swanson and I step out of the barn and after a while The Dutchman
calls us and we go back into the barn to find he has a big fire going in the
stove, and the place nice and warm.</p>

<p>Miss Clarabelle Cobb is now all quieted down, and is covered with The
Dutchman's overcoat, and as we come in The Dutchman tiptoes over to her and
pulls back the coat and what do we see but a baby with a noggin no bigger than
a crab apple and a face as wrinkled as some old pappy guy's, and The Dutchman
states that it is a boy, and a very healthy one, at that.</p>

<p>'Furthermore,' The Dutchman says, 'the mamma is doing as well as can be
expected. She is as strong a doll as ever I see,' he says, 'and all we have to
do now is send out a croaker when we go through town just to make sure there
are no complications. But,' The Dutchman says, 'I guarantee the croaker will
not have much to do.'</p>

<p>Well, the old Dutchman is as proud of this baby as if it is his own, and I
do not wish to hurt his feelings, so I say the baby is a darberoo, and a great
credit to him in every respect, and also to Miss Clarabelle Cobb, while Blondy
Swanson just stands there looking at it as if he never sees a baby before in
his life, and is greatly astonished.</p>

<p>It seems that Miss Clarabelle Cobb is a very strong doll, just as The
Dutchman states, and in about an hour she shows signs of being wide awake, and
Blondy Swanson sits down on the floor beside her, and she talks to him quite a
while in a low voice, and while they are talking The Dutchman pulls up the
floor in another corner of the barn, and digs around underneath a few minutes,
and finally comes up with a grip sack covered with dirt, and he opens this grip
sack and shows me it is filled with lovely, large coarse banknotes.</p>

<p>Later Blondy Swanson tells The Dutchman and me the story of Miss Clarabelle
Cobb, and parts of this story are rather sad. It seems that after Miss
Clarabelle Cobb goes back to her old home in Akron, Ohio, she winds up marrying
a young guy by the name of Joseph Hatcher, who is a book-keeper by trade, and
has a pretty good job in Akron, so Miss Clarabelle Cobb and this Joseph Hatcher
are as happy as anything together for quite a spell.</p>

<p>Then about a year before the night I am telling about Joseph Hatcher is sent
by his firm to these parts where we find Miss Clarabelle Cobb, to do the
book-keeping in a factory there, and one night a few months afterwards, when
Joseph Hatcher is staying after hours in the factory office working on his
books, a mob of wrong gees breaks into the joint, and sticks him up, and blows
open the safe, taking away a large sum of money and leaving Joseph Hatcher tied
up like a turkey.</p>

<p>When Joseph Hatcher is discovered in this predicament the next morning, what
happens but the gendarmes put the sleeve on him, and place him in the pokey,
saying the chances are Joseph Hatcher is in and in with the safe-blowers, and
that he tips them off the dough is in the safe, and it seems that the guy who
is especially fond of this idea is a guy by the name of Ambersham, who is
manager of the factory, and a very hard-hearted guy, at that.</p>

<p>And now, although this is eight or nine months back, there is Joseph Hatcher
still in the pokey awaiting trial, and it is seven to five anywhere in town
that the judge throws the book at him when he finally goes to bat, because it
seems from what Miss Clarabelle Cobb tells Blondy Swanson that nearly everybody
figures Joseph Hatcher is guilty.</p>

<p>But of course Miss Clarabelle Cobb does not put in with popular opinion
about her ever-loving Joe, and she spends the next few months trying to spring
him from the pokey, but she has no potatoes, and no way of getting any
potatoes, so things go from bad to worse with Miss Clarabelle Cobb.</p>

<p>Finally, she finds herself with no place to live in town, and she happens to
run into this old barn, which is on an abandoned property owned by a doctor in
town by the name of Kelton, and it seems that he is a kind-hearted guy, and he
gives her permission to use it any way she wishes. So Miss Clarabelle moves
into the barn, and the chances are there is many a time when she wishes she is
back in Mr. Georgie White's 'Scandals.'</p>

<p>Now The Dutchman listens to this story with great interest, especially the
part about Joseph Hatcher being left tied up in the factory office, and finally
The Dutchman states as follows:</p>

<p>'Why, my goodness,' The Dutchman says, 'there is no doubt but what this is
the very same young guy we are compelled to truss up the night we get this grip
sack. As I recollect it, he wishes to battle for his employer's dough, and I
personally tap him over the coco with a blackjack.</p>

<p>'But,' he says, 'he is by no means the guy who tips us off about the dough
being there. As I remember it now, it is nobody but the guy whose name you
mention in Miss Clarabelle Cobb's story. It is this guy Ambersham, the manager
of the joint, and come to think of it, he is supposed to get his bit of this
dough for his trouble, and it is only fair that I carry out this agreement as
the executor of the estate of my late comrades, although,' The Dutchman says,
'I do not approve of his conduct towards this Joseph Hatcher. But,' he says,
'the first thing for us to do is to get a doctor out here to Miss Clarabelle
Cobb, and I judge the doctor for us to get is this Doc Kelton she speaks
of.'</p>

<p>So The Dutchman takes the grip sack and we get into the old can and head
back the way we come, although before we go I see Blondy Swanson bend down over
Miss Clarabelle Cobb, and while I do not wish this to go any farther, I will
take a paralysed oath I see him plant a small kiss on the baby's noggin, and I
hear Miss Clarabelle Cobb speak as follows:</p>

<p>'I will name him for you, Blondy,' she says. 'By the way, Blondy, what is
your right name?'</p>

<p>'Olaf,' Blondy says.</p>

<p>It is now along in the early morning and not many citizens are stirring as
we go through town again, with Blondy in the front seat again holding the grip
sack on his lap so The Dutchman can drive, but finally we find a guy in an
all-night lunch counter who knows where Doc Kelton lives, and this guy stands
on the running-board of the old can and guides us to a house in a side street,
and after pounding on the door quite a spell, we roust the Doc out and Blondy
goes inside to talk with him.</p>

<p>He is in there quite a spell, but when he comes out he says everything is
okay, and that Doc Kelton will go at once to look after Miss Clarabelle Cobb,
and take her to a hospital, and Blondy states that he leaves a couple of C's
with the Doc to make sure Miss Clarabelle Cobb gets the best of care.</p>

<p>'Well,' The Dutchman says, 'we can afford a couple of C's out of what we
have in this grip sack, but,' he says, 'I am still wondering if it is not my
duty to look up this Ambersham, and give him his bit.'</p>

<p>'Dutchman,' Blondy says, 'I fear I have some bad news for you. The grip sack
is gone. This Doc Kelton strikes me as a right guy in every respect,
especially,' Blondy says, 'as he states to me that he always half-suspects
there is a wrong rap in on Miss Clarabelle Cobb's ever-loving Joe, and that if
it is not for this guy Ambersham agitating all the time other citizens may
suspect the same thing, and it will not be so tough for Joe.</p>

<p>'So,' Blondy says, 'I tell Doc Kelton the whole story, about Ambersham and
all, and I take the liberty of leaving the grip sack with him to be returned to
the rightful owners, and Doc Kelton says if he does not have Miss Clarabelle
Cobb's Joe out of the sneezer, and this Ambersham on the run out of town in
twenty-four hours, I can call him a liar. But,' Blondy says, 'let us now
proceed on our way, because I only have Doc Kelton's word that he will give us
twelve hours' leeway before he does anything except attend to Miss Clarabelle
Cobb, as I figure you need this much time to get out of sight, Dutchman.'</p>

<p>Well, The Dutchman does not say anything about all this news for a while,
and seems to be thinking the situation over, and while he is thinking he is
giving his old can a little more gas than he intends, and she is fairly popping
along what seems to be the main drag of the town when a gendarme on a
motor-cycle comes up alongside us, and motions The Dutchman to pull over to the
kerb.</p>

<p>He is a nice-looking young gendarme, but he seems somewhat hostile as he
gets off his motor-cycle, and walks up to us very slow, and asks us where the
fire is.</p>

<p>Naturally, we do not say anything in reply, which is the only thing to say
to a gendarme under these circumstances, so he speaks as follows:</p>

<p>'What are you guys carrying in this old skillet, anyway?' he says. 'Stand
up, and let me look you guys over.'</p>

<p>And then as we stand up, he peeks into the front and back of the car, and
under our feet, and all he finds is a bottle which once holds some of Good Time
Charley's rock candy and rye whisky without the rock candy, but which is now
very empty, and he holds this bottle up, and sniffs at the nozzle, and asks
what is formerly in this bottle, and I tell him the truth when I tell him it is
once full of medicine, and The Dutchman and Blondy Swanson nod their heads in
support of my statement. But the gendarme takes another sniff, and then he says
like this:</p>

<p>'Oh,' he says, very sarcastic, 'wise guys, eh? Three wise guys, eh? Trying
to kid somebody, eh? Medicine, eh?' he says. 'Well, if it is not Christmas Day
I will take you in and hold you just on suspicion. But I will be Santa Claus to
you, and let you go ahead, wise guys.'</p>

<p>And then after we get a few blocks away, The Dutchman speaks as follows:
'Yes,' he says, 'that is what we are, to be sure. We are wise guys. If we are
not wise guys, we will still have the grip sack in this car for the copper to
find. And if the copper finds the grip sack, he will wish to take us to the
jail house for investigation, and if he wishes to take us there I fear he will
not be alive at this time, and we will be in plenty of heat around and about,
and personally,' The Dutchman says, 'I am sick and tired of heat.'</p>

<p>And with this The Dutchman puts a large Betsy back in a holster under his
left arm, and turns on the gas, and as the old can begins leaving the lights of
the town behind, I ask Blondy if he happens to notice the name of this
town.</p>

<p>'Yes,' Blondy says, 'I notice it on a signboard we just pass. It is
Bethlehem, Pa.'</p>

<h3><a name="A_Very_Honourable_Guy" id="A_Very_Honourable_Guy">A Very Honourable Guy</a></h3>
<p>Off and on I know Feet Samuels a matter of eight or ten years, up and down
Broadway, and in and out, but I never have much truck with him because he is a
guy I consider no dice. In fact, he does not mean a thing.</p>

<p>In the first place, Feet Samuels is generally broke, and there is no
percentage in hanging around brokers. The way I look at it, you are not going
to get anything off a guy who has not got anything. So while I am very sorry
for brokers, and am always willing to hope that they get hold of something, I
do not like to be around them. Long ago an old-timer who knows what he is
talking about says to me:</p>

<p>'My boy,' he says, 'always try to rub up against money, for if you rub up
against money long enough, some of it may rub off on you.'</p>

<p>So in all the years I am around this town, I always try to keep in with the
high shots and guys who carry these large coarse banknotes around with them,
and I stay away from small operators and chisellers and brokers. And Feet
Samuels is one of the worst brokers in this town, and has been such as long as
I know him.</p>

<p>He is a big heavy guy with several chins and very funny feet, which is why
he is called Feet. These feet are extra large feet, even for a big guy, and
Dave the Dude says Feet wears violin-cases for shoes. Of course this is not
true, because Feet cannot get either of his feet in a violin-case, unless it is
a case for a very large violin, such as a 'cello.</p>

<p>I see Feet one night in the Hot Box, which is a night club, dancing with a
doll by the name of Hortense Hathaway, who is in Georgie White's 'Scandals,'
and what is she doing but standing on Feet's feet as if she is on sled runners,
and Feet never knows it. He only thinks the old gondolas are a little extra
heavy to shove around this night, because Hortense is no invalid. In fact, she
is a good rangy welterweight.</p>

<p>She has blonde hair and plenty to say, and her square monicker is Annie
O'Brien, and not Hortense Hathaway at all. Furthermore, she comes from Newark,
which is in New Jersey, and her papa is a taxi jockey by the name of Skush
O'Brien, and a very rough guy, at that, if anybody asks you. But of course the
daughter of a taxi jockey is as good as anybody else for Georgie White's
'Scandals' as long as her shape is okay, and nobody ever hears any complaint
from the customers about Hortense on this proposition.</p>

<p>She is what is called a show girl, and all she has to do is to walk around
and about Georgie White's stage with only a few light bandages on, and
everybody considers her very beautiful, especially from the neck down, although
personally I never care much for Hortense because she is very fresh to people.
I often see her around the night clubs, and when she is in these deadfalls
Hortense generally is wearing quite a number of diamond bracelets and fur
wraps, and one thing and another, so I judge she is not doing bad for a doll
from Newark, New Jersey.</p>

<p>Of course Feet Samuels never knows why so many other dolls besides Hortense
are wishing to dance with him, but gets to thinking maybe it is because he has
the old sex appeal, and he is very sore indeed when Henri, the head waiter at
the Hot Box, asks him to please stay off the floor except for every tenth
dance, because Feet's feet take up so much room when he is on the floor that
only two other dancers can work out at the same time, it being a very small
floor.</p>

<p>I must tell you more about Feet's feet, because they are very remarkable
feet indeed. They go off at different directions under him, very sharp, so if
you see Feet standing on a corner it is very difficult to tell which way he is
going, because one foot will be headed one way, and the other foot the other
way. In fact, guys around Mindy's restaurant often make bets on the proposition
as to which way Feet is headed when he is standing still.</p>

<p>What Feet Samuels does for a living is the best he can, which is the same
thing many other guys in this town do for a living. He hustles some around the
race tracks and crap games and prize fights, picking up a few bobs here and
there as a runner for the bookmakers, or scalping bets, or steering suckers,
but he is never really in the money in his whole life. He is always owing and
always paying off, and I never see him but what he is troubled with the shorts
as regards to dough.</p>

<p>The only good thing you can say about Feet Samuels is he is very honourable
about his debts, and what he owes he pays when he can. Anybody will tell you
this about Feet Samuels, although of course it is only what any hustler such as
Feet must do if he wishes to protect his credit and keep in action. Still, you
will be surprised how many guys forget to pay.</p>

<p>It is because Feet's word is considered good at all times that he is nearly
always able to raise a little dough, even off The Brain, and The Brain is not
an easy guy for anybody to raise dough off of. In fact, The Brain is very tough
about letting people raise dough off of him.</p>

<p>If anybody gets any dough off of The Brain he wishes to know right away what
time they are going to pay it back, with certain interest, and if they say at
five-thirty Tuesday morning, they better not make it five-thirty-one Tuesday
morning, or The Brain will consider them very unreliable and never let them
have any money again. And when a guy loses his credit with The Brain he is in a
very tough spot indeed in this town, for The Brain is the only man who always
has dough.</p>

<p>Furthermore, some very unusual things often happen to guys who get money off
of The Brain and fail to kick it back just when they promise, such as broken
noses and sprained ankles and other injuries, for The Brain has people around
him who seem to resent guys getting dough off of him and not kicking it back.
Still, I know of The Brain letting some very surprising guys have dough,
because he has a bug that he is a wonderful judge of guys' characters, and that
he is never wrong on them, although I must say that no guy who gets dough off
of The Brain is more surprising than Feet Samuels.</p>

<p>The Brain's right name is Armand Rosenthal, and he is called The Brain
because he is so smart. He is well known to one and all in this town as a very
large operator in gambling, and one thing and another, and nobody knows how
much dough The Brain has, except that he must have plenty, because no matter
how much dough is around, The Brain sooner or later gets hold of all of it.
Some day I will tell you more about The Brain, but right now I wish to tell you
about Feet Samuels.</p>

<p>It comes on a tough winter in New York, what with nearly all hands who have
the price going to Miami and Havana and New Orleans, leaving the brokers
behind. There is very little action of any kind in town with the high shots
gone, and one night I run into Feet Samuels in Mindy's, and he is very sad
indeed. He asks me if I happen to have a finnif on me, but of course I am not
giving finnifs to guys like Feet Samuels, and finally he offers to compromise
with me for a deuce, so I can see things must be very bad with Feet for him to
come down from five dollars to two.</p>

<p>'My rent is away overdue for the shovel and broom,' Feet says, 'and I have a
hard-hearted landlady who will not listen to reason. She says she will give me
the wind if I do not lay something on the line at once. Things are never so bad
with me,' Feet says, 'and I am thinking of doing something very desperate.'</p>

<p>I cannot think of anything very desperate for Feet Samuels to do, except
maybe go to work, and I know he is not going to do such a thing no matter what
happens. In fact, in all the years I am around Broadway I never know any broker
to get desperate enough to go to work.</p>

<p>I once hear Dave the Dude offer Feet Samuels a job riding rum between here
and Philly at good wages, but Feet turns it down because he claims he cannot
stand the open air, and anyway Feet says he hears riding rum is illegal and may
land a guy in the pokey. So I know whatever Feet is going to do will be nothing
difficult.</p>

<p>'The Brain is still in town,' I say to Feet. 'Why do you not put the lug on
him? You stand okay with him.'</p>

<p>'There is the big trouble,' Feet says. 'I owe The Brain a C note already,
and I am supposed to pay him back by four o'clock Monday morning, and where I
am going to get a hundred dollars I do not know, to say nothing of the other
ten I must give him for interest.'</p>

<p>'What are you figuring on doing?' I ask, for it is now a Thursday, and I can
see Feet has very little time to get together such a sum.</p>

<p>'I am figuring on scragging myself,' Feet says, very sad. 'What good am I to
anybody? I have no family and no friends, and the world is packing enough
weight without me. Yes, I think I will scrag myself.'</p>

<p>'It is against the law to commit suicide in this man's town,' I say,
'although what the law can do to a guy who commits suicide I am never able to
figure out.'</p>

<p>'I do not care,' Feet says. 'I am sick and tired of it all. I am especially
sick and tired of being broke. I never have more than a few quarters to rub
together in my pants pocket. Everything I try turns out wrong. The only thing
that keeps me from scragging myself at once is the C note I owe The Brain,
because I do not wish to have him going around after I am dead and gone saying
I am no good. And the toughest thing of all,' Feet says, 'is I am in love. I am
in love with Hortense.'</p>

<p>'Hortense?' I say, very much astonished indeed. 'Why, Hortense is nothing
but a big--'</p>

<p>'Stop!' Feet says. 'Stop right here! I will not have her called a big
boloney or whatever else big you are going to call her, because I love her. I
cannot live without her. In fact,' Feet says, 'I do not wish to live without
her.'</p>

<p>'Well,' I say, 'what does Hortense think about you loving her?'</p>

<p>'She does not know it,' Feet says. 'I am ashamed to tell her, because
naturally if I tell her I love her, Hortense will expect me to buy her some
diamond bracelets, and naturally I cannot do this. But I think she likes me
more than somewhat, because she looks at me in a certain way. But,' Feet says,
'there is some other guy who likes her also, and who is buying her diamond
bracelets and what goes with them, which makes it very tough on me. I do not
know who the guy is, and I do not think Hortense cares for him so much, but
naturally any doll must give serious consideration to a guy who can buy her
diamond bracelets. So I guess there is nothing for me to do but scrag
myself.'</p>

<p>Naturally I do not take Feet Samuels serious, and I forget about his
troubles at once, because I figure he will wiggle out some way, but the next
night he comes into Mindy's all pleasured up, and I figure he must make a
scratch somewhere, for he is walking like a man with about sixty-five dollars
on him.</p>

<p>But it seems Feet only has a idea, and very few ideas are worth sixty-five
dollars.</p>

<p>'I am laying in bed thinking this afternoon,' Feet says, 'and I get to
thinking how I can raise enough dough to pay off The Brain, and maybe a few
other guys, and my landlady, and leave a few bobs over to help bury me. I am
going to sell my body.'</p>

<p>Well, naturally I am somewhat bewildered by this statement, so I ask Feet to
explain, and here is his idea: He is going to find some doctor who wishes a
dead body and sell his body to this doctor for as much as he can get, his body
to be delivered after Feet scrags himself, which is to be within a certain
time.</p>

<p>'I understand,' Feet says, 'that these croakers are always looking for
bodies to practise on, and that good bodies are not easy to get nowadays.'</p>

<p>'How much do you figure your body is worth?' I ask.</p>

<p>'Well,' Feet says, 'a body as big as mine ought to be worth at least a
G.'</p>

<p>'Feet,' I say, 'this all sounds most gruesome to me. Personally I do not
know much about such a proposition, but I do not believe if doctors buy bodies
at all that they buy them by the pound. And I do not believe you can get a
thousand dollars for your body, especially while you are still alive, because
how does a doctor know if you will deliver your body to him?'</p>

<p>'Why,' Feet says, very indignant, 'everybody knows I pay what I owe. I can
give The Brain for reference, and he will okay me with anybody for keeping my
word.'</p>

<p>Well, it seems to me that there is very little sense to what Feet Samuels is
talking about, and anyway I figure that maybe he blows his topper, which is
what often happens to brokers, so I pay no more attention to him. But on Monday
morning, just before four o'clock, I am in Mindy's, and what happens but in
walks Feet with a handful of money, looking much pleased.</p>

<p>The Brain is also there at the table where he always sits facing the door so
nobody can pop in on him without him seeing them first, because there are many
people in this town that The Brain likes to see first if they are coming in
where he is. Feet steps up to the table and lays a C note in front of the Brain
and also a sawbuck, and The Brain looks up at the clock and smiles and
says:</p>

<p>'Okay, Feet, you are on time.'</p>

<p>It is very unusual for The Brain to smile about anything, but afterwards I
hear he wins two C's off of Manny Mandelbaum, who bets him Feet will not pay
off on time, so The Brain has a smile coming.</p>

<p>'By the way, Feet,' The Brain says, 'some doctor calls me up today and asks
me if your word is good, and you may be glad to know I tell him you are one
hundred per cent. I put the okay on you because I know you never fail to
deliver on a promise. Are you sick, or something?'</p>

<p>'No,' Feet says, 'I am not sick. I just have a little business deal on with
the guy. Thanks for the okay.'</p>

<p>Then he comes over to the table where I am sitting, and I can see he still
has money left in his duke. Naturally I am anxious to know where he makes the
scratch, and by and by he tells me.</p>

<p>'I put over the proposition I am telling you about,' Feet says. 'I sell my
body to a doctor over on Park Avenue by the name of Bodeeker, but I do not get
a G for it as I expect. It seems bodies are not worth much right now because
there are so many on the market, but Doc Bodeeker gives me four C's on thirty
days' delivery.</p>

<p>'I never know it is so much trouble selling a body before,' Feet says.
'Three doctors call the cops on me when I proposition them, thinking I am
daffy, but Doc Bodeeker is a nice old guy and is glad to do business with me,
especially when I give The Brain as reference. Doc Bodeeker says he is looking
for a head shaped just like mine for years, because it seems he is a shark on
heads. But,' Feet says, 'I got to figure out some way of scragging myself
besides jumping out a window, like I plan, because Doc Bodeeker does not wish
my head mussed up.'</p>

<p>'Well,' I say, 'this is certainly most ghastly to me and does not sound
legitimate. Does The Brain know you sell your body?'</p>

<p>'No,' Feet says, 'Doc Bodeeker only asks him over the phone if my word is
good, and does not tell him why he wishes to know, but he is satisfied with The
Brain's okay. Now I am going to pay my landlady, and take up a few other
markers here and there, and feed myself up good until it is time to leave this
bad old world behind.'</p>

<p>But it seems Feet Samuels does not go to pay his landlady right away. Where
he goes is to Johnny Crackow's crap game downtown, which is a crap game with a
$500 limit where the high shots seldom go, but where there is always some
action for a small operator. And as Feet walks into the joint it seems that Big
Nig is trying to make four with the dice, and everybody knows that four is a
hard point for Big Nig, or anybody else, to make.</p>

<p>So Feet Samuels looks on a while watching Big Nig trying to make four, and a
guy by the name of Whitey offers to take two to one for a C note that Big Nig
makes this four, which is certainly more confidence than I will ever have in
Big Nig. Naturally Feet hauls out a couple of his C notes at once, as anybody
must do who has a couple of C notes, and bets Whitey two hundred to a hundred
that Big Nig does not make the four. And right away Big Nig outs with a seven,
so Feet wins the bet.</p>

<p>Well, to make a long story short, Feet stands there for some time betting
guys that other guys will not make four, or whatever it is they are trying to
make with the dice, and the first thing anybody knows Feet Samuels is six G's
winner, and has the crap game all crippled up. I see him the next night up in
the Hot Box, and this big first baseman, Hortense, is with him, sliding around
on Feet's feet, and a blind man can see that she has on at least three more
diamond bracelets than ever before.</p>

<p>A night or two later I hear of Feet beating Long George McCormack, a high
shot from Los Angeles, out of eighteen G's playing a card game that is called
low ball, and Feet Samuels has no more licence to beat a guy like Long George
playing low ball than I have to lick Jack Dempsey. But when a guy finally gets
his rushes in gambling nothing can stop him for a while, and this is the way it
is with Feet. Every night you hear of him winning plenty of dough at this or
that.</p>

<p>He comes into Mindy's one morning, and naturally I move over to his table at
once, because Feet is now in the money and is a guy anybody can associate with
freely. I am just about to ask him how things are going with him, although I
know they are going pretty good, when in pops a fierce-looking old guy with his
face all covered with grey whiskers that stick out every which way, and whose
eyes peek out of these whiskers very wild indeed. Feet turns pale as he sees
the guy, but nods at him, and the guy nods back and goes out.</p>

<p>'Who is the Whiskers?' I ask Feet. 'He is in here the other morning looking
around, and he makes people very nervous because nobody can figure who he is or
what his dodge may be.'</p>

<p>'It is old Doc Bodeeker,' Feet says. 'He is around checking up on me to make
sure I am still in town. Say, I am in a very hot spot one way and another.'</p>

<p>'What are you worrying about?' I ask. 'You got plenty of dough and about two
weeks left to enjoy yourself before this Doc Bodeeker forecloses on you.'</p>

<p>'I know,' Feet says, very sad. 'But now I get this dough things do not look
as tough to me as formerly, and I am very sorry I make the deal with the
doctor. Especially,' Feet says, 'on account of Hortense.'</p>

<p>'What about Hortense?' I ask.</p>

<p>'I think she is commencing to love me since I am able to buy her more
diamond bracelets than the other guy,' Feet says. 'If it is not for this thing
hanging over me, I will ask her to marry me, and maybe she will do it, at
that.'</p>

<p>'Well, then,' I say, 'why do you not go to old Whiskers and pay him his
dough back, and tell him you change your mind about selling your body, although
of course if it is not for Whiskers's buying your body you will not have all
this dough.'</p>

<p>'I do go to him,' Feet says, and I can see there are big tears in his eyes.
'But he says he will not cancel the deal. He says he will not take the money
back; what he wants is my body, because I have such a funny-shaped head. I
offer him four times what he pays me, but he will not take it. He says my body
must be delivered to him promptly on March first.'</p>

<p>'Does Hortense know about this deal?' I ask.</p>

<p>'Oh, no, no!' Feet says. 'And I will never tell her, because she will think
I am crazy, and Hortense does not care for crazy guys. In fact, she is always
complaining about the other guy who buys her the diamond bracelets, claiming he
is a little crazy, and if she thinks I am the same way the chances are she will
give me the breeze.'</p>

<p>Now this is a situation, indeed, but what to do about it I do not know. I
put the proposition up to a lawyer friend of mine the next day, and he says he
does not believe the deal will hold good in court, but of course I know Feet
Samuels does not wish to go to court, because the last time Feet goes to court
he is held as a material witness and is in the Tombs ten days.</p>

<p>The lawyer says Feet can run away, but personally I consider this a very
dishonourable idea after The Brain putting the okay on Feet with old Doc
Bodeeker, and anyway I can see Feet is not going to do such a thing as long as
Hortense is around. I can see that one hair of her head is stronger than the
Atlantic cable with Feet Samuels.</p>

<p>A week slides by, and I do not see so much of Feet, but I hear of him
murdering crap games and short card players, and winning plenty, and also going
around the night clubs with Hortense, who finally has so many bracelets there
is no more room on her arms, and she puts a few of them on her ankles, which
are not bad ankles to look at, at that, with or without bracelets.</p>

<p>Then goes another week, and it just happens I am standing in front of
Mindy's about four-thirty one morning and thinking that Feet's time must be up
and wondering how he makes out with old Doc Bodeeker, when all of a sudden I
hear a ploppity-plop coming up Broadway, and what do I see but Feet Samuels
running so fast he is passing taxis that are going thirty-five miles an hour
like they are standing still. He is certainly stepping along.</p>

<p>There are no traffic lights and not much traffic at such an hour in the
morning, and Feet passes me in a terrible hurry. And about twenty yards behind
him comes an old guy with grey whiskers, and I can see it is nobody but Doc
Bodeeker. What is more, he has a big long knife in one hand, and he seems to be
reaching for Feet at every jump with the knife.</p>

<p>Well, this seems to me a most surprising spectacle, and I follow them to see
what comes of it, because I can see at once that Doc Bodeeker is trying to
collect Feet's body himself. But I am not much of a runner, and they are out of
my sight in no time, and only that I am able to follow them by ear through
Feet's feet going ploppity-plop I will never trail them.</p>

<p>They turn east into Fifty-fourth Street off Broadway, and when I finally
reach the corner I see a crowd halfway down the block in front of the Hot Box,
and I know this crowd has something to do with Feet and Doc Bodeeker even
before I get to the door to find that Feet goes on in while Doc Bodeeker is
arguing with Soldier Sweeney, the door man, because as Feet passes the Soldier
he tells the Soldier not to let the guy who is chasing him in. And the Soldier,
being a good friend of Feet's, is standing the doc off.</p>

<p>Well, it seems that Hortense is in the Hot Box waiting for Feet, and
naturally she is much surprised to see him come in all out of breath, and so is
everybody else in the joint, including Henri, the head waiter, who afterwards
tells me what comes off there, because you see I am out in front.</p>

<p>'A crazy man is chasing me with a butcher knife,' Feet says to Hortense. 'If
he gets inside I am a goner. He is down at the door trying to get in.'</p>

<p>Now I will say one thing for Hortense, and this is she has plenty of nerve,
but of course you will expect a daughter of Skush O'Brien to have plenty of
nerve. Nobody ever has more moxie than Skush. Henri, the head waiter, tells me
that Hortense does not get excited, but says she will just have a little peek
at the guy who is chasing Feet.</p>

<p>The Hot Box is over a garage, and the kitchen windows look down into
Fifty-fourth Street, and while Doc Bodeeker is arguing with Soldier Sweeney, I
hear a window lift, and who looks out but Hortense. She takes one squint and
yanks her head in quick, and Henri tells me afterwards she shrieks:</p>

<p>'My Lord, Feet! This is the same daffy old guy who sends me all the
bracelets, and who wishes to marry me!'</p>

<p>'And he is the guy I sell my body to,' Feet says, and then he tells Hortense
the story of his deal with Doc Bodeeker.</p>

<p>'It is all for you, Horty,' Feet says, although of course this is nothing
but a big lie, because it is all for The Brain in the beginning. 'I love you,
and I only wish to get a little dough to show you a good time before I die. If
it is not for this deal I will ask you to be my ever-loving wife.'</p>

<p>Well, what happens but Hortense plunges right into Feet's arms, and gives
him a big kiss on his ugly mush, and says to him like this:</p>

<p>'I love you too, Feet, because nobody ever makes such a sacrifice as to hock
their body for me. Never mind the deal. I will marry you at once, only we must
first get rid of this daffy old guy downstairs.'</p>

<p>Then Hortense peeks out of the window again and hollers down at old Doc
Bodeeker. 'Go away,' she says. 'Go away, or I will chuck a moth in your
whiskers, you old fool.'</p>

<p>But the sight of her only seems to make old Doc Bodeeker a little wilder
than somewhat, and he starts struggling with Soldier Sweeney very ferocious, so
the Soldier takes the knife away from the doc and throws it away before
somebody gets hurt with it.</p>

<p>Now it seems Hortense looks around the kitchen for something to chuck out
the window at old Doc Bodeeker, and all she sees is a nice new ham which the
chef just lays out on the table to slice up for ham sandwiches. This ham is a
very large ham, such as will last the Hot Box a month, for they slice the ham
in their ham sandwiches very, very thin up at the Hot Box. Anyway, Hortense
grabs up the ham and runs to the window with it and gives it a heave without
even stopping to take aim.</p>

<p>Well, this ham hits the poor old Doc Bodeeker kerbowie smack dab on the
noggin. The doc does not fall down, but he commences staggering around with his
legs bending under him like he is drunk.</p>

<p>I wish to help him, because I feel sorry for a guy in such a spot as this,
and what is more I consider it a dirty trick for a doll such as Hortense to
slug anybody with a ham.</p>

<p>Well, I take charge of the old doc and lead him back down Broadway and into
Mindy's, where I set him down and get him a cup of coffee and a Bismarck
herring to revive him, while quite a number of citizens gather about him very
sympathetic.</p>

<p>'My friends,' the old doc says finally, looking around, 'you see in me a
broken-hearted man. I am not a crack-pot, although of course my relatives may
give you an argument on this proposition. I am in love with Hortense. I am in
love with her from the night I first see her playing the part of a sunflower in
"Scandals." I wish to marry her, as I am a widower of long standing, but
somehow the idea of me marrying anybody never appeals to my sons and
daughters.</p>

<p>'In fact,' the doc says, dropping his voice to a whisper, 'sometimes they
even talk of locking me up when I wish to marry somebody. So naturally I never
tell them about Hortense, because I fear they may try to discourage me. But I
am deeply in love with her and send her many beautiful presents, although I am
not able to see her often on account of my relatives. Then I find out Hortense
is carrying on with this Feet Samuels.</p>

<p>'I am desperately jealous,' the doc says, 'but I do not know what to do.
Finally Fate sends this Feet to me offering to sell his body. Of course, I am
not practising for years, but I keep an office on Park Avenue just for old
times' sake, and it is to this office he comes. At first I think he is crazy,
but he refers me to Mr. Armand Rosenthal, the big sporting man, who assures me
that Feet Samuels is all right.</p>

<p>'The idea strikes me that if I make a deal with Feet Samuels for his body as
he proposes, he will wait until the time comes to pay his obligation and run
away, and,' the doc says, 'I will never be troubled by his rivalry for the
affections of Hortense again. But he does not depart. I do not reckon on the
holding power of love.</p>

<p>'Finally in a jealous frenzy I take after him with a knife, figuring to
scare him out of town. But it is too late. I can see now Hortense loves him in
return, or she will not drop a scuttle of coal on me in his defence as she
does.</p>

<p>'Yes, gentlemen,' the old doc says, 'I am broken-hearted. I also seem to
have a large lump on my head. Besides, Hortense has all my presents, and Feet
Samuels has my money, so I get the worst of it all around. I only hope and
trust that my daughter Eloise, who is Mrs. Sidney Simmons Bragdon, does not
hear of this, or she may be as mad as she is the time I wish to marry the
beautiful cigarette girl in Jimmy Kelley's.'</p>

<p>Here Doc Bodeeker seems all busted up by his feelings and starts to shed
tears, and everybody is feeling very sorry for him indeed, when up steps The
Brain, who is taking everything in.</p>

<p>'Do not worry about your presents and your dough,' The Brain says. 'I will
make everything good, because I am the guy who okays Feet Samuels with you. I
am wrong on a guy for the first time in my life, and I must pay, but Feet
Samuels will be very, very sorry when I find him. Of course, I do not figure on
a doll in the case, and this always makes quite a difference, so I am really
not a hundred per cent. wrong on the guy, at that.</p>

<p>'But,' The Brain says, in a very loud voice so everybody can hear, 'Feet
Samuels is nothing but a dirty welsher for not turning in his body to you as
per agreement, and as long as he lives he will never get another dollar or
another okay off of me, or anybody I know. His credit is ruined for ever on
Broadway.'</p>

<p>But I judge that Feet and Hortense do not care. The last time I hear of them
they are away over in New Jersey where not even The Brain's guys dast to bother
them on account of Skush O'Brien, and I understand they are raising chickens
and children right and left, and that all of Hortense's bracelets are now in
Newark municipal bonds, which I am told are not bad bonds, at that.</p>

<h3><a name="Princess_OHara" id="Princess_OHara">Princess O'Hara</a></h3>
<p>Now of course Princess O'Hara is by no means a regular princess, and in fact
she is nothing but a little red-headed doll, with plenty of freckles, from over
in Tenth Avenue, and her right name is Maggie, and the only reason she is
called Princess O'Hara is as follows:</p>

<p>She is the daughter of King O'Hara, who is hacking along Broadway with one
of these old-time victorias for a matter of maybe twenty-five years, and every
time King O'Hara gets his pots on, which is practically every night, rain or
shine, he is always bragging that he has the royal blood of Ireland in his
veins, so somebody starts calling him King, and this is his monicker as long as
I can remember, although probably what King O'Hara really has in his veins is
about ninety-eight per cent. alcohol.</p>

<p>Well, anyway, one night about seven or eight years back, King O'Hara shows
up on his stand in front of Mindy's restaurant on Broadway with a
spindly-legged, little doll about ten years of age on the seat beside him, and
he says that this little doll is nobody but his daughter, and he is taking care
of her because his old lady is not feeling so good, and right away Last Card
Louie, the gambler, reaches up and dukes the little doll and says to her like
this:</p>

<p>'If you are the daughter of the King, you must be the princess.' Last Card
Louie says. 'How are you, Princess?'</p>

<p>So from this time on, she is Princess O'Hara, and afterwards for several
years she often rides around in the early evening with the King, and sometimes
when the King has his pots on more than somewhat, she personally drives
Goldberg, which is the King's horse, although Goldberg does not really need
much driving as he knows his way along Broadway better than anybody. In fact,
this Goldberg is a most sagacious old pelter, indeed, and he is called Goldberg
by the King in honour of a Jewish friend by the name of Goldberg, who keeps a
delicatessen store in Tenth Avenue.</p>

<p>At this time, Princess O'Hara is as homely as a mud fence, and maybe
homelier, what with the freckles, and the skinny gambs, and a few buck teeth,
and she does not weigh more than sixty pounds, sopping wet, and her red hair is
down her back in pigtails, and she giggles if anybody speaks to her, so finally
nobody speaks to her much, but old King O'Hara seems to think well of her, at
that.</p>

<p>Then by and by she does not seem to be around with the King any more, and
when somebody happens to ask about her, the King says his old lady claims the
Princess is getting too grown-up to be shagging around Broadway, and that she
is now going to public school. So after not seeing her for some years,
everybody forgets that King O'Hara has a daughter, and in fact nobody cares a
cuss.</p>

<p>Now King O'Hara is a little shrivelled-up old guy with a very red beezer,
and he is a most familiar spectacle to one and all on Broadway as he drives
about with a stove-pipe hat tipped so far over to one side of his noggin that
it looks as if it is always about to fall off, and in fact the King himself is
always tipped so far over to one side that it seems to be a sure thing that he
is going to fall off.</p>

<p>The way the King keeps himself on the seat of his victoria is really most
surprising, and one time Last Card Louie wins a nice bet off a gambler from St.
Louis by the name of Olive Street Oscar, who takes eight to five off of Louie
that the King cannot drive them through Central Park without doing a Brodie off
the seat. But of course Louie is betting with the best of it, which is the way
he always dearly loves to bet, because he often rides through Central Park with
King O'Hara, and he knows the King never falls off, no matter how far over he
tips.</p>

<p>Personally, I never ride with the King very much, as his victoria is so old
I am always afraid the bottom will fall out from under me, and that I will run
myself to death trying to keep up, because the King is generally so busy
singing Irish come-all-yeez up on his seat that he is not apt to pay much
attention to what his passengers are doing.</p>

<p>There are quite a number of these old victorias left in this town, a
victoria being a low-neck, four-wheeled carriage with seats for four or five
people, and they are very popular in the summer-time with guys and dolls who
wish to ride around and about in Central Park taking the air, and especially
with guys and dolls who may wish to do a little off-hand guzzling while taking
the air.</p>

<p>Personally, I consider a taxicab much more convenient and less expensive
than an old-fashioned victoria if you wish to get to some place, but of course
guys and dolls engaged in a little off-hand guzzling never wish to get any
place in particular, or at least not soon. So these victorias, which generally
stand around the entrances to the Park, do a fair business in the summer-time,
because it seems that no matter what conditions are, there are always guys and
dolls who wish to do a little off-hand guzzling.</p>

<p>But King O'Hara stands in front of Mindy's because he has many regular
customers among the citizens of Broadway, who do not go in for guzzling so very
much, unless a case of guzzling comes up, but who love to ride around in the
Park on hot nights just to cool themselves out, although at the time I am now
speaking of, things are so tough with one and all along Broadway that King
O'Hara has to depend more on strangers for his trade.</p>

<p>Well, what happens one night, but King O'Hara is seen approaching Mindy's,
tipping so far over to one side of his seat that Olive Street Oscar, looking to
catch even on the bet he loses before, is offering to take six to five off of
Last Card Louie that this time the King goes plumb off, and Louie is about to
give it to him, when the old King tumbles smack-dab into the street as dead as
last Tuesday, which shows you how lucky Last Card Louie is, because nobody ever
figures such a thing to happen to the King, and even Goldberg, the horse, stops
and stands looking at him very much surprised, with one hind hoof in the King's
stovepipe hat. The doctors state that King O'Hara's heart just naturally hauls
off and quits working on him, and afterwards Regret, the horse player, says the
chances are the King probably suddenly remembers refusing a drink
somewhere.</p>

<p>A few nights later, many citizens are out in front of Mindy's, and Big Nig,
the crap shooter, is saying that things do not look the same around there since
King O'Hara puts his checks back in the rack, when all of a sudden up comes a
victoria that anybody can see is the King's old rattletrap, especially as it is
being pulled by Goldberg.</p>

<p>And who is on the driver's seat, with King O'Hara's bunged-up old stovepipe
hat sitting jack-deuce on her noggin, but a red-headed doll of maybe eighteen
or nineteen with freckles all over her pan, and while it is years since I see
her, I can tell at once that she is nobody but Princess O'Hara, even though it
seems she changes quite some.</p>

<p>In fact, she is now about as pretty a little doll as anybody will wish to
see, even with the freckles, because the buck teeth seem to have disappeared,
and the gambs are now filled out very nicely, and so has the rest of her.
Furthermore, she has a couple of blue eyes that are most delightful to behold,
and a smile like six bits, and all in all, she is a pleasing scene.</p>

<p>Well, naturally, her appearance in this manner causes some comment, and in
fact some citizens are disposed to criticise her as being unladylike, until Big
Nig, the crap shooter, goes around among them very quietly stating that he will
knock their ears down if he hears any more cracks from them, because it seems
that Big Nig learns that when old King O'Hara dies, all he leaves in this world
besides his widow and six kids is Goldberg, the horse, and the victoria, and
Princess O'Hara is the eldest of these kids, and the only one old enough to
work, and she can think of nothing better to do than to take up her papa's
business where he leaves off.</p>

<p>After one peek at Princess O'Hara, Regret, the horse player, climbs right
into the victoria, and tells her to ride him around the Park a couple of times,
although it is well known to one and all that it costs two bobs per hour to
ride in anybody's victoria, and the only dough Regret has in a month is a pound
note that he just borrows off of Last Card Louie for eating money. But from
this time on, the chances are Regret will be Princess O'Hara's best customer if
he can borrow any more pound notes, but the competition gets too keen for him,
especially from Last Card Louie, who is by this time quite a prominent
character along Broadway, and in the money, although personally I always say
you can have him, as Last Card Louie is such a guy as will stoop to very sharp
practice, and in fact he often does not wait to stoop.</p>

<p>He is called Last Card Louie because in his youth he is a great hand for
riding the tubs back and forth between here and Europe and playing stud poker
with other passengers, and the way he always gets much strength from the last
card is considered quite abnormal, especially if Last Card Louie is dealing.
But of course Last Card Louie no longer rides the tubs as this occupation is
now very old-fashioned, and anyway Louie has more profitable interests that
require his attention, such as a crap game, and one thing and another.</p>

<p>There is no doubt but what Last Card Louie takes quite a fancy to Princess
O'Hara, but naturally he cannot spend all his time riding around in a victoria,
so other citizens get a chance to patronise her now and then, and in fact I
once take a ride with Princess O'Hara myself, and it is a very pleasant
experience, indeed, as she likes to sing while she is driving, just as old King
O'Hara does in his time.</p>

<p>But what Princess O'Hara sings is not Irish come-all-yeez but Kathleen
Mavourneen, and My Wild Irish Rose, and Asthore, and other such ditties, and
she has a loud contralto voice, and when she lets it out while driving through
Central Park in the early hours of the morning, the birds in the trees wake up
and go tweet-tweet, and the coppers on duty for blocks around stand still with
smiles on their kissers, and the citizens who live in the apartment houses
along Central Park West and Central Park South come to their windows to
listen.</p>

<p>Then one night in October, Princess O'Hara does not show up in front of
Mindy's, and there is much speculation among one and all about this absence,
and some alarm, when Big Nig, the crap shooter, comes around and says that what
happens is that old Goldberg, the horse, is down with colic, or some such, so
there is Princess O'Hara without a horse.</p>

<p>Well, this news is received with great sadness by one and all, and there is
some talk of taking up a collection to buy Princess O'Hara another horse, but
nobody goes very far with this idea because things are so tough with everybody,
and while Big Nig mentions that maybe Last Card Louie will be glad to do
something large in this matter, nobody cares for this idea, either, as many
citizens are displeased with the way Last Card Louie is pitching to Princess
O'Hara, because it is well known that Last Card Louie is nothing but a wolf
when it comes to young dolls, and anyway about now Regret, the horse player,
speaks up as follows:</p>

<p>'Why,' Regret says, 'it is great foolishness to talk of wasting money buying
a horse, even if we have any money to waste, when the barns up at Empire City
are packed at this time with crocodiles of all kinds. Let us send a committee
up to the track,' Regret says, 'and borrow a nice horse for Princess O'Hara to
use until Goldberg is back on his feet again.'</p>

<p>'But,' I say to Regret, 'suppose nobody wishes to lend us a horse?'</p>

<p>'Why,' Regret says, 'I do not mean to ask anybody to lend us a horse. I mean
let us borrow one without asking anybody. Most of these horse owners are so
very touchy that if we go around asking them to lend us a horse to pull a hack,
they may figure we are insulting their horses, so let us just get the horse and
say nothing whatever.'</p>

<p>Well, I state that this sounds to me like stealing, and stealing is
something that is by no means upright and honest, and Regret has to admit that
it really is similar to stealing, but he says what of it, and as I do not know
what of it, I discontinue the argument. Furthermore, Regret says it is clearly
understood that we will return any horse we borrow when Goldberg is hale and
hearty again, so I can see that after all there is nothing felonious in the
idea, or anyway, not much.</p>

<p>But after much discussion, it comes out that nobody along Broadway seems to
know anything about stealing a horse. There are citizens who know all about
stealing diamond necklaces, or hot stoves, but when it comes to horses,
everybody confesses themselves at a loss. It is really amazing the amount of
ignorance there is on Broadway about stealing horses.</p>

<p>Then finally Regret has a bright idea. It seems that a rodeo is going on at
Madison Square Garden at this time, a rodeo being a sort of wild west show with
bucking broncos, and cowboys, and all this and that, and Regret seems to
remember reading when he is a young squirt that stealing horses is a very
popular pastime out in the wild west.</p>

<p>So one evening Regret goes around to the Garden and gets to talking to a
cowboy in leather pants with hair on them, and he asks this cowboy, whose name
seems to be Laramie Pink, if there are any expert horse stealers connected with
the rodeo. Moreover, Regret explains to Laramie Pink just why he wants a good
horse stealer, and Pink becomes greatly interested and wishes to know if the
loan of a nice bucking bronco, or a first-class cow pony will be of any
assistance, and when Regret says he is afraid not, Laramie Pink says like
this:</p>

<p>'Well,' he says, 'of course horse stealing is considered a most antique
custom out where I come from, and in fact it is no longer practised in the best
circles, but,' he says, 'come to think of it, there is a guy with this outfit
by the name of Frying Pan Joe, who is too old to do anything now except mind
the cattle, but who is said to be an excellent horse stealer out in Colorado in
his day. Maybe Frying Pan Joe will be interested in your proposition,' Laramie
Pink says.</p>

<p>So he hunts up Frying Pan Joe, and Frying Pan Joe turns out to be a little
old pappy guy with a chin whisker, and a sad expression, and a wide-brimmed
cowboy hat, and when they explain to him that they wish him to steal a horse,
Frying Pan Joe seems greatly touched, and his eyes fill up with tears, and he
speaks as follows:</p>

<p>'Why,' Frying Pan Joe says, 'your idea brings back many memories to me. It
is a matter of over twenty-five years since I steal a horse, and the last time
I do this it gets me three years in the calabozo. Why,' he says, 'this is
really a most unexpected order, and it finds me all out of practice, and with
no opportunity to get myself in shape. But,' he says, 'I will put forth my best
efforts on this job for ten dollars, as long as I do not personally have to
locate the horse I am to steal. I am not acquainted with the ranges hereabouts,
and will not know where to go to find a horse.'</p>

<p>So Regret, the horse player, and Big Nig, the crap shooter, and Frying Pan
Joe go up to Empire this very same night, and it turns out that stealing a
horse is so simple that Regret is sorry he does not make the tenner himself,
for all Frying Pan Joe does is to go to the barns where the horses live at
Empire, and walk along until he comes to a line of stalls that do not seem to
have any watchers around in the shape of stable hands at the moment. Then
Frying Pan Joe just steps into a stall and comes out leading a horse, and if
anybody sees him, they are bound to figure he has a right to do this, because
of course not even Sherlock Holmes is apt to think of anybody stealing a horse
around this town.</p>

<p>Well, when Regret gets a good peek at the horse, he sees right away it is
not just a horse that Frying Pan Joe steals. It is Gallant Godfrey, one of the
greatest handicap horses in this country, and the winner of some of the biggest
stakes of the year, and Gallant Godfrey is worth twenty-five G's if he is worth
a dime, and when Regret speaks of this, Frying Pan Joe says it is undoubtedly
the most valuable single piece of horseflesh he ever steals, although he claims
that once when he is stealing horses along the Animas River in Colorado, he
steals two hundred horses in one batch that will probably total up more.</p>

<p>They take Gallant Godfrey over to Eleventh Avenue, where Princess O'Hara
keeps Goldberg in a little stable that is nothing but a shack, and they leave
Gallant Godfrey there alongside old Goldberg, who is groaning and carrying on
in a most distressing manner, and then Regret and Big Nig shake hands with
Frying Pan Joe and wish him good-bye.</p>

<p>So there is Princess O'Hara with Gallant Godfrey hitched up to her victoria
the next night, and the chances are it is a good thing for her that Gallant
Godfrey is a nice tame old dromedary, and does not mind pulling a victoria at
all, and in fact he seems to enjoy it, although he likes to go along at a
gallop instead of a slow trot, such as the old skates that pull these victorias
usually employ.</p>

<p>And while Princess O'Hara understands that this is a borrowed horse, and is
to be returned when Goldberg is well, nobody tells her just what kind of a
horse it is, and when she gets Goldberg's harness on Gallant Godfrey his
appearance changes so that not even the official starter is apt to recognize
him if they come face to face.</p>

<p>Well, I hear afterwards that there is great consternation around Empire when
it comes out that Gallant Godfrey is missing, but they keep it quiet as they
figure he just wanders away, and as he is engaged in certain large stakes later
on, they do not wish it made public that he is absent from his stall. So they
have guys looking for him high and low, but of course nobody thinks to look for
a high-class race-horse pulling a victoria.</p>

<p>When Princess O'Hara drives the new horse up in front of Mindy's, many
citizens are anxious to take the first ride with her, but before anybody has
time to think, who steps up but Ambrose Hammer, the newspaper scribe, who has a
foreign-looking young guy with him, and Ambrose states as follows:</p>

<p>'Get in, Georges,' Ambrose says. 'We will take a spin through the Park and
wind up at the Casino.'</p>

<p>So away they go, and from this moment begins one of the greatest romances
ever heard of on Broadway, for it seems that the foreign-looking young guy that
Ambrose Hammer calls Georges takes a wonderful liking to Princess O'Hara right
from taw, and the following night I learn from Officer Corbett, the motor-cycle
cop who is on duty in Central Park, that they pass him with Ambrose Hammer in
the back seat of the victoria, but with Georges riding on the driver's seat
with Princess O'Hara.</p>

<p>And moreover, Officer Corbett states that Georges is wearing King O'Hara's
old stovepipe hat, while Princess O'Hara is singing Kathleen Mavourneen in her
loud contralto in such a way as nobody ever hears her sing before.</p>

<p>In fact, this is the way they are riding along a little later in the week,
and when it is coming on four bells in the morning. But this time, Princess
O'Hara is driving north on the street that is called Central Park West because
it borders the Park on the west, and the reason she is taking this street is
because she comes up Broadway through Columbus Circle into Central Park West
figuring to cross over to Fifth Avenue by way of the transverse at Sixty-sixth
Street, a transverse being nothing but a roadway cut through the Park from
Central Park West to the Avenue.</p>

<p>There are several of these transverses, and why they do not call them roads,
or streets, instead of transverses, I do not know, except maybe it is because
transverse sounds more fancy. These transverses are really like tunnels without
any roofs, especially the one at Sixty-sixth Street, which is maybe a quarter
of a mile long and plenty wide enough for automobiles to pass each other going
in different directions, but once a car is in the transverse there is no way it
can get out except at one end or the other. There is no such thing as turning
off to one side anywhere between Central Park West and the Avenue, because the
Sixty-sixth Street transverse is a deep cut with high sides, or walls.</p>

<p>Well, just as Princess O'Hara starts to turn Gallant Godfrey into the
transverse, with the foreign-looking young guy beside her on the driver's seat,
and Ambrose Hammer back in the cushions, and half-asleep, and by no means
interested in the conversation that is going on in front of him, a big beer
truck comes rolling along Central Park West, going very slow.</p>

<p>And of course there is nothing unusual in the spectacle of a beer truck at
this time, as beer is now very legal, but just as this beer truck rolls
alongside Princess O'Hara's victoria, a little car with two guys in it pops out
of nowhere, and pulls up to the truck, and one of the guys requests the jockey
of the beer truck to stop.</p>

<p>Of course Princess O'Hara and her passengers do not know at the time that
this is one of the very first cases of histing a truckload of legal beer that
comes off in this country, and that they are really seeing history made,
although it all comes out later. It also comes out later that one of the
parties committing this historical deed is nobody but a guy by the name of Fats
O'Rourke, who is considered one of the leading characters over on the west
side, and the reason he is histing this truckload of beer is by no means a plot
against the brewing industry, but because it is worth several C's, and Fats
O'Rourke can use several C's very nicely at the moment.</p>

<p>It comes out that the guy with him is a guy by the name of Joe the Blow Fly,
but he is really only a fink in every respect, a fink being such a guy as is
extra nothing, and many citizens are somewhat surprised when they learn that
Fats O'Rourke is going around with finks.</p>

<p>Well, if the jockey of the beer truck does as he is requested without any
shilly-shallying, all that will happen is he will lose his beer. But instead of
stopping the truck, the jockey tries to keep right on going, and then all of a
sudden Fats O'Rourke becomes very impatient and outs with the old thing, and
gives it to the jockey, as follows: Bang, bang.</p>

<p>By the time Fats O'Rourke lets go, The Fly is up on the seat of the truck
and grabs the wheel just as the jockey turns it loose and falls back on the
seat, and Fats O'Rourke follows The Fly up there, and then Fats O'Rourke seems
to see Princess O'Hara and her customers for the first time, and he also
realizes that these parties witness what comes off with the jockey, although
otherwise Central Park West is quite deserted, and if anybody in the apartment
houses along there hears the shots the chances are they figure it must be
nothing but an automobile backfiring.</p>

<p>And in fact The Fly has the beer truck backfiring quite some at this moment
as Fats O'Rourke sees Princess O'Hara and her customers, and only somebody who
happens to observe the flashes from Fats O'Rourke's duke, or who hears the same
buzzes that Princess O'Hara, and the foreign-looking young guy, and Ambrose
Hammer hear, can tell that Fats is emptying that old thing at the victoria.</p>

<p>The chances are Fats O'Rourke will not mind anybody witnessing him histing a
legal beer truck, and in fact he is apt to welcome their testimony in later
years when somebody starts disputing his claim to being the first guy to hist
such a truck, but naturally Fats does not wish to have spectators spying on him
when he is giving it to somebody, as very often spectators are apt to go around
gossiping about these matters, and cause dissension.</p>

<p>So he takes four cracks at Princess O'Hara and her customers, and it is a
good thing for them that Fats O'Rourke is never much of a shot. Furthermore, it
is a good thing for them that he is now out of ammunition because of course
Fats O'Rourke never figures that it is going to take more than a few shots to
hist a legal beer truck, and afterwards there is little criticism of Fats'
judgment, as everybody realizes that it is a most unprecedented situation.</p>

<p>Well, by now, Princess O'Hara is swinging Gallant Godfrey into the
transverse, because she comes to the conclusion that it is no time to be
loitering in this neighbourhood, and she is no sooner inside the walls of the
transverse than she knows this is the very worst place she can go, as she hears
a rumble behind her, and when she peeks back over her shoulder she sees the
beer truck coming lickity-split, and what is more, it is coming right at the
victoria.</p>

<p>Now Princess O'Hara is no chump, and she can see that the truck is not
coming right at the victoria by accident, when there is plenty of room for it
to pass, so she figures that the best thing to do is not to let the truck catch
up with the victoria if she can help it, and this is very sound reasoning,
indeed, because Joe the Blow Fly afterwards says that what Fats O'Rourke
requests him to do is to sideswipe the victoria with the truck and squash it
against the side of the transverse, Fats O'Rourke's idea being to keep Princess
O'Hara and her customers from speaking of the transaction with the jockey of
the truck.</p>

<p>Well, Princess O'Hara stands up in her seat, and tells Gallant Godfrey to
giddap, and Gallant Godfrey is giddapping very nicely, indeed, when she looks
back and sees the truck right at the rear wheel of the victoria, and coming
like a bat out of what-is-this. So she grabs up her whip and gives Gallant
Godfrey a good smack across the vestibule, and it seems that if there is one
thing Gallant Godfrey hates and despises it is a whip. He makes a lunge that
pulls the victoria clear of the truck, just as The Fly drives it up alongside
the victoria and is bearing over for the squash, with Fats O'Rourke yelling
directions at him, and from this lunge, Gallant Godfrey settles down to
running.</p>

<p>While this is going on, the foreign-looking young guy is standing up on the
driver's seat of the victoria beside Princess O'Hara, whooping and laughing, as
he probably figures it is just a nice, friendly little race. But Princess
O'Hara is not laughing, and neither is Ambrose Hammer.</p>

<p>Now inside the next hundred yards, Joe the Blow Fly gets the truck up
alongside again, and this time it looks as if they are gone goslings when
Princess O'Hara gives Gallant Godfrey another smack with the whip, and the
chances are Gallant Godfrey comes to the conclusion that Westrope is working on
him in a stretch run, as he turns on such a burst of speed that he almost runs
right out of his collar and leaves the truck behind by anyway a length and a
half.</p>

<p>And it seems that just as Gallant Godfrey turns on, Fats O'Rourke personally
reaches over and gives the steering-wheel of the beer truck a good twist,
figuring that the squashing is now a cinch, and the next thing anybody knows
the truck goes smack-dab into the wall with a loud kuh-boom, and turns over all
mussed up, with beer kegs bouncing around very briskly, and some of them
popping open and letting the legal beer leak out.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Gallant Godfrey goes tearing out of the transverse into
Fifth Avenue and across Fifth Avenue so fast that the wheels of Princess
O'Hara's victoria are scarcely touching the ground, and a copper who sees him
go past afterwards states that what Gallant Godfrey is really doing is flying,
but personally I always consider this an exaggeration.</p>

<p>Anyway, Gallant Godfrey goes two blocks beyond Fifth Avenue before Princess
O'Hara can get him to whoa-up, and there is still plenty of run in him,
although by this time Princess O'Hara is plumb worn out, and Ambrose Hammer is
greatly fatigued, and only the foreign-looking young guy seems to find any
enjoyment in the experience, although he is not so jolly when he learns that
the coppers take two dead guys out of the truck, along with Joe the Blow Fly,
who lives just long enough to relate the story.</p>

<p>Fats O'Rourke is smothered to death under a stack of kegs of legal beer,
which many citizens consider a most gruesome finish, indeed, but what kills the
jockey of the truck is the bullet in his heart, so the smash-up of the truck
does not make any difference to him one way or the other, although of course if
he lives, the chances are his employers will take him to task for losing the
beer.</p>

<p>I learn most of the details of the race through the transverse from Ambrose
Hammer, and I also learn from Ambrose that Princess O'Hara and the
foreign-looking young guy are suffering from the worst case of love that
Ambrose ever witnesses, and Ambrose Hammer witnesses some tough cases of love
in his day. Furthermore, Ambrose says they are not only in love but are
planning to get themselves married up as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>'Well,' I say, 'I hope and trust this young guy is all right, because
Princess O'Hara deserves the best. In fact,' I say, 'a Prince is not too good
for her.'</p>

<p>'Well,' Ambrose says, 'a Prince is exactly what she is getting. I do not
suppose you can borrow much on it in a hock shop in these times, but the title
of Prince Georges Latour is highly respected over in France, although,' he
says, 'I understand the proud old family does not have as many potatoes as
formerly. But he is a nice young guy, at that, and anyway, what is money
compared to love?'</p>

<p>Naturally, I do not know the answer to this, and neither does Ambrose
Hammer, but the very same day I run into Princess O'Hara and the
foreign-looking young guy on Broadway, and I can see the old love light shining
so brightly in their eyes that I get to thinking that maybe money does not mean
so much alongside of love, at that, although personally, I will take a chance
on the money.</p>

<p>I stop and say hello to Princess O'Hara, and ask her how things are going
with her, and she says they are going first class.</p>

<p>'In fact,' she says, 'it is a beautiful world in every respect. Georges and
I are going to be married in a few days now, and are going to Paris, France, to
live. At first I fear we will have a long wait, because of course I cannot
leave my mamma and the rest of the children unprovided for. But,' Princess
O'Hara says, 'what happens but Regret sells my horse to Last Card Louie for a
thousand dollars, so everything is all right.</p>

<p>'Of course,' Princess O'Hara says, 'buying my horse is nothing but an act of
great kindness on the part of Last Card Louie as my horse is by no means worth
a thousand dollars, but I suppose Louie does it out of his old friendship for
my papa. I must confess,' she says, 'that I have a wrong impression of Louie,
because the last time I see him I slap his face thinking he is trying to get
fresh with me. Now I realize it is probably only his paternal interest in me,
and I am very sorry.'</p>

<p>Well, I know Last Card Louie is such a guy as will give you a glass of milk
for a nice cow, and I am greatly alarmed by Princess O'Hara's statement about
the sale, for I figure Regret must sell Gallant Godfrey, not remembering that
he is only a borrowed horse and must be returned in good order, so I look
Regret up at once and mention my fears, but he laughs and speaks to me as
follows:</p>

<p>'Do not worry,' he says. 'What happens is that Last Card Louie comes around
last night and hands me a G note and says to me like this: 'Buy Princess
O'Hara's horse off of her for me, and you can keep all under this G that you
get it for.'</p>

<p>'Well,' Regret says, 'of course I know that old Last Card is thinking of
Gallant Godfrey, and forgets that the only horse that Princess O'Hara really
owns is Goldberg, and the reason he is thinking of Gallant Godfrey is because
he learns last night about us borrowing the horse for her. But as long as Last
Card Louie refers just to her horse, and does not mention any names, I do not
see that it is up to me to go into any details with him. So I get him a bill of
sale for Princess O'Hara's horse, and I am waiting ever since to hear what he
says when he goes to collect the horse and finds it is nothing but old
Goldberg.'</p>

<p>'Well,' I say to Regret, 'it all sounds most confusing to me, because what
good is Gallant Godfrey to Last Card Louie when he is only a borrowed horse,
and is apt to be recognized anywhere except when he is hitched to a victoria?
And I am sure Last Card Louie is not going into the victoria business.'</p>

<p>'Oh,' Regret says, 'this is easy. Last Card Louie undoubtedly sees the same
ad. in the paper that the rest of us see, offering a reward of ten G's for the
return of Gallant Godfrey and no questions asked, but of course Last Card Louie
has no way of knowing that Big Nig is taking Gallant Godfrey home long before
Louie comes around and buys Princess O'Hara's horse.'</p>

<p>Well, this is about all there is to tell, except that a couple of weeks
later I hear that Ambrose Hammer is in the Clinic Hospital very ill, and I drop
around to see him because I am very fond of Ambrose Hammer no matter if he is a
newspaper scribe.</p>

<p>He is sitting up in bed in a nice private room, and he has on blue silk
pyjamas with his monogram embroidered over his heart, and there is a large vase
of roses on the table beside him, and a nice-looking nurse holding his hand,
and I can see that Ambrose Hammer is not doing bad, although he smiles very
feebly at me when I come in.</p>

<p>Naturally I ask Ambrose Hammer what ails him, and after he takes a sip of
water out of a glass that the nice-looking nurse holds up to his lips, Ambrose
sighs, and in a very weak voice he states as follows:</p>

<p>'Well,' Ambrose says, 'one night I get to thinking about what will happen to
us in the transverse if we have old Goldberg hitched to Princess O'Hara's
victoria instead of one of the fastest race horses in the world, and I am so
overcome by the thought that I have what my doctor claims is a nervous
breakdown. I feel terrible,' Ambrose says.</p>

<h3><a name="Social_Error" id="Social_Error">Social Error</a></h3>
<p>WHEN Mr. Ziegfeld picks a doll she is apt to be above the average when it
comes to looks, for Mr. Ziegfeld is by no means a chump at picking dolls. But
when Mr. Ziegfeld picks Miss Midgie Muldoon, he beats his own best record, or
anyway ties it. I never see a better-looking doll in my life, although she is
somewhat smaller than I like them. I like my dolls big enough to take a good
hold on, and Miss Midgie Muldoon is only about knee-high to a Pomeranian. But
she is very cute, and I do not blame Handsome Jack Maddigan for going daffy
about her.</p>

<p>Now most any doll on Broadway will be very glad indeed to have Handsome Jack
Maddigan give her a tumble, so it is very surprising to one and all when Miss
Midgie Muldoon plays the chill for Handsome Jack, especially when you figure
that Miss Midgie Muldoon is nothing but a chorus doll, while Handsome Jack is
quite a high shot in this town. But one night in the Hot Box when Handsome Jack
sends word to Miss Midgie Muldoon by Miss Billy Perry, who is Dave the Dude's
wife, that he will like to meet up with her, Miss Midgie Muldoon sends word
back to Handsome Jack that she is not meeting up with tough guys.</p>

<p>Well, naturally this crack burns Handsome Jack up quite some. But Dave the
Dude says never mind, and furthermore Dave says Miss Midgie Muldoon's crack
serves Handsome Jack right for sitting around shooting off his mouth, and
putting himself away as a tough guy, because if there is anything Dave hates it
is a guy letting on he is tough, no matter how tough he really is, and Handsome
Jack is certainly such a guy.</p>

<p>He is a big tall blond guy who comes up out of what they call Hell's Kitchen
over on the West Side, and if he has a little more sense the chances are he
will be as important a guy as Dave the Dude himself in time, instead of
generally working for Dave, but Handsome Jack likes to wear very good clothes,
and drink, and sit around a lot, and also do plenty of talking, and no matter
how much dough he makes he never seems able to bold much of anything.</p>

<p>Personally, I never care to have any truck with Handsome Jack because he
always strikes me as a guy who is a little too quick on the trigger to suit me,
and I always figure the best you are going to get out of being around guys who
are quick on the trigger is the worst of it, and so any time I see Handsome
Jack I give him the back of my neck. But there are many people in this world
such as Basil Valentine who love to be around these characters.</p>

<p>This Basil Valentine is a little guy who-wears horn cheaters and writes
articles for the magazines, and is personally a very nice little guy, and as
harmless as a water snake, but he cannot have a whole lot of sense, or he will
not be hanging out with Handsome Jack and other such characters.</p>

<p>If a guy hangs out with tough guys long enough he is to get to thinking
maybe he is tough himself, and by and other people may get the idea he is
tough, and the first thing you know along comes some copper in plain clothes,
such as Johnny Brannigan, of the strongarm squad, and biffs him on the noggin
with a blackjack just to see how tough he is. As I say, Basil Valentine is a
very harmless guy, but after he is hanging out with Handsome Jack a while, I
hear Basil talking very tough to a bus boy, and the chances are he is building
himself up to talk tough to a waiter, and then maybe to a head waiter, and
finally he may consider himself tough enough to talk tough to anybody.</p>

<p>I can show you many a guy who is supposed to be strictly legitimate sitting
around with guys who are figured as tough guys, and why this is I do not know,
but I am speaking to Waldo Winchester, the newspaper scribe, about the
proposition one night, and Waldo Winchester, who is a half-smart guy in many
respects, says it is what is called an underworld complex. Waldo Winchester
says many legitimate people are much interested in the doings of tough guys,
and consider them very romantic, and he says if I do not believe it look at all
the junk the newspapers print making heroes out of tough guys.</p>

<p>Waldo Winchester says the underworld complex is a very common complex and
that Basil Valentine has it, and so has Miss Harriet Mackyle, or she will not
be all the time sticking her snoot into joints where tough guys hang out. This
Miss Harriet Mackyle is one of these rich dolls who wears snaky-looking evening
clothes, and has her hair cut like a boy's, with her ears sticking out, and is
always around the night traps, generally with some guy with a little mustache,
and a way of talking like an Englishman, and come to think of it I do see her
in tough joints more than somewhat, saying hello to different parties such as
nobody in their right minds will say hello to, including such as Red Henry, who
is just back from Dannemora, after being away for quite a spell for taking
things out of somebody's safe and blowing the safe open to take these
things.</p>

<p>In fact, I see Miss Harriet Mackyle dancing one night in the Hearts and
Flowers club, which is a very tough joint, indeed, and who is she dancing with
but Red Henry, and when I ask Waldo Winchester what he makes of this
proposition, he says it is part of the underworld complex he is talking about.
He says Miss Harriet Mackyle probably thinks it smart to tell her swell friends
she dances with a safe blower, although personally if I am going to dance with
a safe blower at all, which does not seem likely, I will pick me out a nicer
safe blower than Red Henry, because he is such a guy as does not take a bath
since he leaves Dannemora, and he is back from Dannemora for several
months.</p>

<p>One party who does not seem to have much of Waldo Winchester's underworld
complex as far as I can see is Midgie Muldoon, because I never see her around
any night traps except such as the Hot Box and the Sixteen Hundred club, which
are considered very nice places, and reasonably safe for anybody who does not
get too far out of line, and Miss Midgie Muldoon is always with very legitimate
guy such as Buddy Donaldson, the song writer, or Walter Gumble, who plays the
trombone in Paul Whiteman's band, or maybe sometimes with Paul Hawley, the
actor.</p>

<p>Furthermore, when she is around such places, Miss Midgie Muldoon minds her
own business quite a bit, and always looks right past Handsome Jack Maddigan,
which burns Jack up all the more. It is the first time Handsome Jack ever runs
into a doll who does not seem excited about him, and he does not know what to
make of such a situation.</p>

<p>Well, what happens but Dave the Dude comes to me one day and says to me like
this: "Listen," Dave says, "this doll Miss Harriet Mackyle is one of my best
customers for high-grade merchandise and is as good as wheat in the bin, and
she is asking a favor of me. She is giving a party Sunday night in her joint
over on Park Avenue, and she wishes me to invite some of the mob, so go around
and tell about a dozen guys to be there all dressed, and not get too fresh,
because a big order of Scotch and champagne goes with the favor."</p>

<p>Now such a party is by no means unusual, although generally it is some swell
guy who gives it rather than a doll, and he gets Broadway guys to be there to
show his pals what a mixer he is. Waldo Winchester says it is to give color to
things, though where the color comes in I do not know, for Broadway guys, such
as will go to a party like this, are apt to just sit around and say nothing,
and act very gentlemanly, because they figure they are on exhibition like
freaks, and the only way you can get them to such parties in the first place is
through some such connection as Miss Harriet Mackyle has with Dave the
Dude.</p>

<p>Anyway, I go around and about and tell a lot of guys what Dave the Dude
wishes them to do, and among others I tell Handsome Jack, who is tickled to
death by the invitation, because if there is anything Jack loves more than
anything it is to be in a spot where he can show off some. Furthermore,
Handsome Jack has a sneaking idea Miss Harriet Mackyle is red hot for him
because she sometimes gives him the old eye when she sees him around the
Sixteen Hundred club, and other spots, but then she does the same thing to Big
Nig, and a lot of other guys I can mention, because that is just naturally the
way Miss Harriet Mackyle is. But of course I do not speak of this to Handsome
Jack. Basil Valentine is with Jack when I invite him, so I tell Basil to come
too, because I do not wish him to think I am a snob.</p>

<p>It turns out that Basil is one of the very first guys to show up Sunday
night at Miss Harriet Mackyle's apartment, where I am already on hand to help
get in the Scotch and champagne and to make Miss Harriet Mackyle acquainted
with such of the mob as I invite, although I find we are about lost in the shuffle
of guys with little mustaches, and dolls in evening clothes that leave plenty
of them sticking out here and there. It seems everybody on Broadway is there,
as well as a lot of Park Avenue, and Mr. Ziegfeld is especially well
represented and among his people I see Miss Midgie Muldoon, although I have to
stand on tiptoe to see her on account of the guys with little mustaches around
her, and their interest in Miss Midgie Muldoon proves that they are not such
saps as they look, even if they do wear little mustaches.</p>

<p>It is a very large apartment, and the first thing I notice is a big green
parrot swinging in a ring hung from the ceiling in a corner of what seems to be
the main room, and the reason I notice this parrot is because it is letting out
a squawk now and then, and yelling different words, such as Polly wants a
cracker. There are also a lot of canary birds hung around the joint, so I judge
Miss Harriet Mackyle loves animals, as well as peculiar people, such as she has
for guests. I am somewhat surprised to see Red Henry all dressed up in evening
clothes moving around among the guests. I do not invite Red Henry, so I suppose
Miss Harriet Mackyle invites him, or he hears rumours of the party, and just
crashes in, but personally I consider it very bad taste on Red's part to show
himself in such a spot, and so does everyone else that knows him, although he
seems to be minding his own business pretty well.</p>

<p>Finally when the serious drinking is under way, and a good time is being had
by one and all, Miss Harriet Mackyle comes over to me and says to me like this:
"Now tell me about your different friends, so I can tell my other guests. They
will be thrilled to death meeting these bad characters,"</p>

<p>"Well," I say, "you see the little guy over there staring at you as if you
are a ghost, or some such? Well, he is nobody but Bad Basil Valentine, who will
kill you quicker than you can say scat, and maybe quicker. He is undoubtedly
the toughest guy here tonight, or anywhere else in this man's town for that
matter. Yes, ma'am, Bad Basil Valentine is one dead tough mug," I say,
"although he is harmless looking at this time. Bad Basil kills many a guy in
his day. In fact, Miss Mackyle," I say, "Bad Basil can scarcely sleep good any
night he does not kill some guy."</p>

<p>"My goodness!" Miss Harriet Mackyle says, looking Basil over very carefully.
"He does not look so bad at first glance, although now that I examine him
closely I believe I do detect a sinister gleam in his eye."</p>

<p>Well, Miss Harriet Mackyle can hardly wait until she gets away from me, and
the next I see of her she has Basil Valentine surrounded and is almost chewing
his ear off as she gabs to him, and anybody can see that Basil is all pleasured
up by this attention. In fact, Basil is snagged if ever I see a guy snagged,
and personally I do not blame him because Miss Harriet Mackyle may not look a
million, but she has a couple, and you can see enough of her in her evening
clothes to know that nothing about her is phony.</p>

<p>The party is going big along toward one o' clock when all of a sudden in
comes Handsome Jack Maddigan with half a heat on, and in five minutes he is all
over the joint, drinking everything that is offered him, and making a fast play
for all the dolls, and talking very loud. He is sored up more than somewhat
when he finds Miss Harriet Mackyle does not give much of a tumble, because he
figures she will be calling him on top the minute he blows in, but Miss Harriet
Mackyle too busy with Basil Valentine finding out from Basil how he knocks off six
of Al Capone's mob out in Chicago one time when he is out there on a pleasure
trip.</p>

<p>Well, while feeling sored up about Miss Harriet Mackyle passing him up for
Basil Valentine, and not knowing how it comes Basil is in so stout with her,
Handsome Jack bumps into Red Henry, and Red Henry makes some fresh crack to
Jack about Basil moving in on him, which causes Handsome Jack to hit Red Henry
on the chin, and knock him half into the lap of Miss Midgie Muldoon, who is
sitting in a chair with a lot of little mustaches around her.</p>

<p>Naturally this incident causes some excitement for a moment. But the way
Miss Midgie Muldoon takes it is very surprising. She just sort of dusts Red
Henry off her, and stands up no bigger than a demi-tasse, and looks Handsome
Jack right in the eye very cool, and says, "Ah, a parlor tough guy." Then she
walks away, leaving Handsome Jack with his mouth open, because he does not know
up to this moment that Miss Midgie Muldoon is present.</p>

<p>Well, somebody heaves Red Henry out of the joint, and the party continues,
but I see Handsome Jack wandering around looking very lonesome, and with not
much speed left compared to what he brings in. Somehow I figure Handsome Jack
is looking for Miss Midgie Muldoon, but she keeps off among the little
mustaches, and finally Handsome Jack takes to belting the old grape right
freely to get his zing back. He gets himself pretty well organized, and when he
suddenly comes upon Miss Midgie Muldoon standing by herself for a moment, he is
feeling very brisk indeed, and he says to her like this:</p>

<p>"Hello, Beautiful, are you playing the hard-to-get for me?"</p>

<p>But Miss Midgie Muldoon only looks him in the eye again and says: "Ah, the
parlor tough guy! Go away, tough guy. I do not like tough guys."</p>

<p>Well, this is not so encouraging when you come to think of it, but Handsome
Jack is a guy who will never be ruled off not trying with the dolls, and he is
just about to begin giving her a little more work, when all of a sudden a voice goes
"Ha-ha-ha," and then it says: "Hello, you fool!"</p>

<p>Now of course it is nothing but the parrot talking, and it says again,
"Ha-ha-ha. Hello, you fool!" Of course the parrot, whose name turns out to be
Polly, does not mean Handsome Jack, but of course Handsome Jack does not know
the parrot does not mean him, and naturally he feels very much insulted.
Furthermore, he has plenty of champagne inside him. So all of a sudden he outs
with the old equalizer and lets go at Polly, and the next minute there are
green feathers flying all over the joint, and poor old Mister, or maybe Missus,
Polly is stretched out as dead as a doornail, and maybe deader.</p>

<p>Well, I never see a doll carry on like Miss Harriet Mackyle does when she
finds out her Polly is a goner, and what she says to Handsome Jack is really
very cutting, and quite extensive, and the chances are Handsome Jack will
finally haul off and smack Miss Harriet Mackyle in the snoot, only he realizes
he is already guilty of a very grave social error in shooting the parrot, and
he does not wish to make it any worse.</p>

<p>Anyway, Miss Midgie Muldoon is standing looking at Handsome Jack-out of her
great big round beautiful eyes with what Waldo Winchester, the scribe,
afterward tells me is plenty of scorn, and it looks to me as if Handsome Jack
feels worse about Miss Midgie Muldoon's looks than he does about what Miss
Harriet Mackyle is saying to him. But Miss Midgie Muldoon never opens her
mouth. She just keeps looking at him for quite a spell, and then finally walks
away, and it looks to me as if she is ready to bust out crying any minute,
maybe because she feels sorry for Polly.</p>

<p>Well, naturally Handsome Jack's error busts up the party, because Miss
Harriet Mackyle does not wish to take any chances on Handsome Jack starting in
to pot her canaries, so we all go away leaving Miss Harriet Mackyle weeping
over what she can find of Polly, and Basil Valentine crying with her, which I
consider very chummy of Basil, at that.</p>

<p>A couple of nights later Basil comes into Mindy's restaurant, where I happen
to be sitting with Handsome Jack, and anyone can tell that Basil is much
worried about something.</p>

<p>"Jack," he says, "Miss Harriet Mackyle is very, very, very angry about you
shooting Polly. In fact, she hates you, because Polly is a family
heirloom."</p>

<p>"Well," Jack says, "tell her I apologize, and will get her a new parrot as
soon as I get the price. You know I am broke now. Tell her I am very sorry,
although," Jack says, "her has no right to call me a fool, and I leave this to
anybody."</p>

<p>"Harriet Mackyle is after me every day to shoot you, Jack." Basil says. "She
thinks I am a very tough guy, and and that I will shoot anybody on short
notice, and she wishes me to shoot you. In fact, she is somewhat displeased
because I do not shoot you when you shoot poor Polly, but of course I explain
to her I do not have a gun at the moment. Now Miss Harriet Mackyle says if I do
not shoot you, she will not love me, and I greatly wish to have Miss Harriet
Mackyle love me, because I am practically daffy about her. So," Basil says, "I
am wondering bow much you will take to hold still and let me shoot you,
Jack?"</p>

<p>"Why," Handsome Jack says, very much astonished, "you must be screwy."</p>

<p>"Of course I do not mean to really shoot you, Jack," Basil says. "I mean to
maybe shoot you with a blank cartridge, so Miss Harriet Mackyle will think I am
shooting you sure enough, which will make her very grateful to me. I am
thinking that maybe I can pay you $1,500 for such a job although this sum
represents nearly my life savings."</p>

<p>"Why," Handsome Jack says, "your proposition sounds very reasonable, at
that. I am just wondering where I can get hold of a few bobs to send Miss
Midgie Muldoon a bar pin, or some such, and see if I cannot round myself up
with her. She is still playing plenty of chill for me. You better make it two
grand while you are about it."</p>

<p>Well, Basil Valentine finally agrees to pay the two grand. Furthermore,
Basil promises to put the dough up in advance with Dave the Dude, or some other
reliable party, as this is rather an unusual business deal, and naturally Jack
wishes to have his interests fully protected.</p>

<p>Well, the thing comes off a few nights later in the Hot Box, and it is all
pretty well laid out in advance. It is understood that Basil is to bring Miss
Harriet Mackyle into the Box after regular hours when there are not apt to be
any too many people around, and to find Handsome Jack there. Basil is to out
with a gun and take a crack at Handsome Jack, and Handsome Jack is to let on he
is hit, and Basil is to get Miss Harriet Mackyle out of the joint in the
confusion.</p>

<p>Handsome Jack promises to lay low a few weeks afterwards so it will look as
if he is dead, and Basil figures that in the meantime Miss Harriet Mackyle will
be so grateful to him that she will love him very much indeed, and maybe marry
him, which is really the big idea with Basil.</p>

<p>It is pretty generally known to one and all what is coming off, and quite a
number of guys drift into the Hot Box during the night, including Dave the
Dude, who seems to be getting quite a bang out of the situation. But who also
bobs up very unexpectedly but Miss Midgie Muldoon with Buddy Donaldson, the
song writer.</p>

<p>Handsome Jack is all upset by Miss Midgie Muldoon being there, but she never
as much as looks at him. So Handsome Jack takes to drinking Scotch more than
somewhat, and everybody commences to worry about whether he will hold still for
Basil Valentine to shoot him, even with a blank cartridge. The Hot Box closes
at 3 o'clock in the morning, and everybody is always turned out except the
regulars. So by 3:30 there are only about a dozen guys and dolls in the joint
when in comes Basil Valentine and Miss Harriet Mackyle.</p>

<p>Handsome Jack happens to be standing with his back to the door and not far
from the table where Miss Midgie Muldoon and this Buddy Donaldson are sitting
when Basil and Miss Harriet Mackyle come in, and right away Basil sings out,
his voice wobbling no little: "Handsome Jack Maddigan, your time has come!" At
this Handsome Jack turns around, and there is Basil Valentine tugging a big rod
out of the pocket of his pants.</p>

<p>The next thing anybody knows, there is a scream, and a voice cries: "Jack!
Look out, Jack!" and out of her seat and over to Handsome Jack Maddigan bounces
Miss Midgie Muldoon, and just as Basil finally raises the rod and turns it on,
Miss Midgie Muldoon plants herself right in front of Jack and stretches out her
arms on either side of her as if to shield him.</p>

<p>Well, the gun goes bingo in Basil's hand, but instead of falling like he is
supposed to do, Handsome Jack stands there with his mouth open looking at Miss
Midgie Muldoon, not knowing what to make of her jumping between him and the
gun, and it is a good thing he does not fall, at that, because he is able to
catch Miss Midgie Muldoon as she starts to keel over. At first we think maybe
it is only a faint, but she has on a low-neck dress, and across her left
shoulder there slowly spreads a red smear, and what is this red smear but
blood, and as Handsome Jack grabs her she says to him like this: "Hold me,
dear, I am hurt."</p>

<p>Now this is most unexpected, indeed, and is by no means a part of the play.
Basil Valentine is standing by the door with the rod in his duke looking quite
astonished, and making no move to get Miss Harriet Mackyle out of the joint as
he is supposed to the minute he fires, and Miss Harriet Mackyle is letting out
a few offhand screams which are very piercing, and saying she never thinks that
Basil will take her seriously and really plug anybody for her, although she
also says she appreciates his thoughtfulness, at that.</p>

<p>You can see Basil is standing there wondering what goes wrong, when Dave the
Dude, who is a fast thinker under all circumstances, takes a quick peek at Miss
Midgie Muldoon, and then jumps across the room and nails Basil. "Why," Dave
says to Basil, "you are nothing but a rascal. You mean to kill him after all.
You do not shoot a blank, you throw a slug, and you get Miss Midgie Muldoon
with it in the shoulder."</p>

<p>Well, Basil is a pretty sick-looking toad as Dave the Dude takes hold of
him, and Miss Harriet Mackyle is putting on a few extra yips when Basil says:
"My goodness, Dave," he says. "I never know this gun is really loaded. In fact,
I forget all about getting a gun of my own until the last minute, and I am
looking around for one when Red Henry comes along and says he will lend me his.
I explain to him how the whole proposition is a joke, and tell him I must have
blanks, and he kindly takes the lead out of the cartridges in front of my own
eyes and makes them blank."</p>

<p>"The chances are Red Henry works a quick change on you," Dave the Dude says.
"Red Henry is very angry at Jack for hitting him on the chin."</p>

<p>Then Dave takes the rod out of Basil's hand and breaks it open, and sure
enough there are enough real slugs in it to sink a rowboat and no blanks
whatever, which surprises Basil Valentine no little.</p>

<p>"Now," Dave says, "get away from here before Jack realizes what happens, and
keep out of sight until you hear from me, because if Miss Midgie Muldoon croaks
it may cause some gossip. Furthermore," Dave says, "take this squawking doll
with you."</p>

<p>Well, you can see that Dave the Dude is pretty much steamed up, and he
remains steamed up until it comes out that Miss Midgie Muldoon is only a little
bit shot, and is by no means in danger of dying. We take her over to the
Polyclinic Hospital, and a guy there digs the bullet out of her shoulder, and
we leave her there with Handsome Jack holding her tight in his arms, and
swearing he will never be tough again, but will get her a nice little home on
Basil Valentine's two grand, and find himself a job, and take no more part in
his old life, all of which seems to sound fair enough.</p>

<p>It is a couple of years before we hear of Miss Harriet Mackyle again, and
then she is Mrs. Basil Valentine, and is living in Naples over in Italy, and
the people there are very much surprised because Mrs. Basil Valentine never
lets Mr. Basil Valentine associate with guys over ten years old, and never lets
him handle anything more dangerous than a niblick.</p>

<p>So this is about all there is to the story, except that when Handsome Jack
Maddigan and Miss Midgie Muldoon stand to be married by Father Leonard, Dave
the Dude sizes them up a minute, and then turns to me and says like this:
"Look," Dave says, "and tell me where does Miss Midgie Muldoon's shoulder come
up to on Jack's left side."</p>

<p>"Well," I say, "her shoulder comes just up to Jack's heart."</p>

<p>"So you see," Dave says, "it is just as well for Jack she stops Basil's
bullet, at that."</p>


<h2>TAKE IT EASY</h2>

<h3><a name="Tight_Shoes" id="Tight_Shoes">Tight Shoes</a></h3>
<p>All this begins the day a young character by the name of Rupert Salsinger
sells Hymie Minsk, the horse player, a pair of shoes that are too tight.</p>

<p>This Rupert Salsinger works in Bilby's shoe store on Broadway, near Mindy's
restaurant, and Hymie stops in there on his way to the Belmont race track early
one afternoon, and buys the shoes.</p>

<p>Now Hymie is in pretty much of a hurry, as he knows of a right good thing in
the first race at Belmont, so he tells Rupert Salsinger to kindly get out a
pair of shoes, size 8 1/2D, and make haste about it.</p>

<p>Well, Rupert Salsinger takes one look at Hymie's dogs, and he can see that
Hymie can no more wear an 8 1/2D than he can fly, for Hymie has large, flat Bronx
feet that can cover as much ground as there is between second and third when
Hymie is just standing still.</p>

<p>So Rupert Salsinger gets out a measuring gadget, and puts one of Hymie's
feet in it, and tells Hymie that what he really needs is a 10 1/2EE, but Hymie
immediately becomes very indignant, as he is extremely sensitive about the size
of his feet, and he says he knows what size shoes he wears, and if Rupert
Salsinger does not care to give him what he wants, he will take his custom
elsewhere.</p>

<p>Now if old man Bilby is personally present, he will know enough to give
Hymie his usual 10 1/2EE's, and tell him they are 8 1/2D's and Hymie will go on about
his business, and think nothing more of it, but Rupert Salsinger is new to
Bilby's store, and furthermore he is a very honest and conscientious young
character, and does not believe in skullduggery even about a pair of shoes, so
he outs with some 8 1/2D's and shows Hymie the mark in them, and Hymie puts them
on, and says they are just the right size, and away he goes to the race
track.</p>

<p>Well, the good thing in the first race blows, and right away Hymie commences
to notice that his shoes seem full of feet, for there is nothing like a loser
in the first race for making a guy notice his feet. Then Hymie gets five more
losers in a row, so by the time the races are over his feet are almost killing
him.</p>

<p>In fact, anybody will tell you that six losers in a row will make a guy's
feet hurt, even if he is barefooted, so a pair of tight shoes on such an
occasion is practically murder in the first degree. Hymie has to take his shoes
off in the train going back to New York to rest his feet, and one and all are
most sympathetic with him, because they realize how keenly he must be suffering
between the tight shoes and the six losers, and especially the six losers.</p>

<p>Well, Hymie Minsk goes right up to Bilby's shoe store in the tight shoes,
and what does he do but use these shoes to kick Rupert Salsinger in the pants
all the way from Bilby's store to Fifty-third Street, three blocks away, and
the chances are he will be kicking Rupert Salsinger to this very day, if one
foot does not finally connect with a book by Karl Marx, which Rupert is wearing
in his hip pocket, and which almost breaks Hymie's big toe, it being a very
solid book.</p>

<p>But everybody agrees that Hymie does the right thing, especially when Hymie
explains that the shoes hurt his feet so at the track that he does not really
know what he is doing after the first race, and his pain causes him to bet on
horses that he has no right to consider in any manner, shape or form whatever.
In fact, everybody agrees that Rupert is a very dangerous character to have on
Broadway, as he may take to selling tight shoes to horse players generally, and
thus cause untold suffering among them, besides upsetting their figures on the
horse races.</p>

<p>Furthermore, when Rupert Salsinger gets back to the shoe store old man
Bilby pays him off and fires him, and also personally takes a few kicks at
Rupert Salsinger's pants himself as Rupert is going out the door, and old man
Bilby's aim is much better than Hymie's, and he does not hit the volume of
Karl Marx even once.</p>

<p>So there Rupert Salsinger is without a position, and with only half a week's
wages consisting of about seven slugs in his pocket, and as it is the first
position Rupert has since the depression sets in, he is downcast no little,
especially as he is hoping to save enough money in this position to justify him
in asking Miss Minnie Schultz, who lives over on Tenth Avenue, to be his
bride.</p>

<p>He is in love with Miss Minnie Schultz for several years, and expects to one
day ask her to marry him, but Rupert Salsinger is such a conscientious young
character that he will never think of making such a request until he becomes a
provider, and anyway, Miss Minnie Schultz's papa, who keeps a delicatessen
store, by no means approves of Rupert Salsinger, because Rupert is always so
thoughtful and studious, and also always so much out of a position.</p>

<p>In fact, Miss Minnie Schultz's papa considers Rupert nothing but a bum, and
he wishes his daughter to marry an entirely different character by the name of
Gus Schmelk, who runs a delicatessen store right across the street from the
Schultz store, and is giving Miss Minnie Schultz's papa such tough competition
that her papa figures it will be a nice business deal for her to marry Gus
Schmelk and combine the stores.</p>

<p>But Miss Minnie Schultz is rather fond of Rupert Salsinger, as he is tall
and thin, and has thick black hair, and a very serious expression, and wears
spectacles, and is really much better than a raw hand when it comes to making
love, even though he is so conservative about speaking of marriage.</p>

<p>Well, anyway, Rupert Salsinger goes up Broadway feeling very sad and blue,
and finally he stops in the Bridle Grill, and steps up to the bar and calls for
a glass of beer, and while he is drinking this beer, he gets to thinking what a
cruel world it is to be sure, so he calls for another beer, with a little rye
whisky on the side, for while Rupert Salsinger is by no means a rumdum, he
feels that this is an occasion that calls for a few drams, anyway.</p>

<p>It is now along about eight bells in the evening, and not many cash
customers are in the Bridle Grill, when all of a sudden in comes a tall,
good-looking young fellow in evening clothes, including a high hat, and an
opera cape, lined with white silk, and who is this young fellow but Calvin
Colby, who is known far and wide as a great pain in the neck to his loving
parents.</p>

<p>He is also known as a character who likes to get around and, in fact, Calvin
Colby's only occupation is getting around. His people are as rich as mud, and
to tell the truth, richer, and what is more they are in the Social Register
and, in fact, Calvin Colby is in the Social Register himself until the
publishers come upon his name one day and see that it is a typographical
error.</p>

<p>He is often in the newspapers, because it is really remarkable how Calvin
Colby's automobiles can spill dolls up against telegraph poles along the Boston
Post Road, when he happens to strike these obstacles, and the dolls are always
suing Calvin Colby for breaking their legs, or spoiling their complexions. It
finally gets so there is talk of taking Calvin's driving licence away from him
before he shatters all the telegraph poles along the Boston Post Road.</p>

<p>He is without doubt strictly a Hoorah Henry, and he is generally figured as
nothing but a lob as far as ever doing anything useful in this world is
concerned, although everybody admits that he has a nice disposition, and is as
good a right guard as ever comes out of Yale.</p>

<p>Calvin Colby is undoubtedly slightly mulled when he enters the Bridle Grill,
and he steps up to the bar alongside Rupert Salsinger, and calls for an
old-fashioned cocktail, and after he inhales this, he calls for three more of
the same, one right after the other, and about this time, Rupert Salsinger, who
is standing there thinking of the wrongs he suffers at the feet of Hymie Minsk
and old man Bilby, lets out a terrible sigh, as follows:</p>

<p>'Hah-ah-ah-hah.'</p>

<p>Well, at this, Calvin Colby gazes at Rupert Salsinger in surprise, as
Rupert's sigh sounds very much like wind escaping from a punctured tyre, and
Calvin speaks to Rupert like this:</p>

<p>'What is eating you?' Calvin says. 'Have a drink.' he says.</p>

<p>Naturally, Rupert has a drink, because it is very seldom in his life that he
gets a drink for nothing, and this time he calls for an old-fashioned, too, as
he is tired of beer and rye whisky, and moreover he figures it will be polite
to drink the same as his host, and then he says to Calvin Colby:</p>

<p>'Comrade,' he says, 'this is an awful world. There is no justice.'</p>

<p>'Well,' Calvin Colby says, 'I never give the matter much thought, because
personally I never have any occasion for justice. But,' he says, 'you may be
right. Have a drink.'</p>

<p>So they have this second drink, and also quite a few other drinks, and
presently they are as friendly as a new bride and groom, and Rupert Salsinger
tells Calvin Colby about the shoes, and Hymie Minsk, and old man Bilby, and
also about Miss Minnie Schultz, and when he gets to Miss Minnie Schultz, he
sheds tears all over Calvin Colby's white pique vest.</p>

<p>Well, Calvin Colby is practically petrified with horror to think of what
Rupert Salsinger suffers, although he does not consider Rupert's tears over
Miss Minnie Schultz quite manly, as Calvin Colby personally never experiences
love, and regards dolls as only plaintiffs, but he admits that his soul seethes
with indignation at the idea of Miss Minnie Schultz's papa wishing to force her
into a marriage with Gus Schmelk. In fact, Calvin Colby says that while he does
not know this Gus Schmelk he is willing to make a little wager that he is
nothing but a bounder and a cad.</p>

<p>Now it seems that Calvin Colby is all dressed up to go somewhere, but by
this time he cannot remember where, and he suggests to Rupert Salsinger that
they take a little stroll and see if the old fashioneds are up to standard in
other parts of the city.</p>

<p>So they leave the Bridle Grill, and the bartender is not sorry to see them
depart, at that, as they are making him work too hard, and they walk north on
Broadway, arm-in-arm, stopping here and there to have a few drinks, and all the
time Calvin Colby is talking about the great injustice that has been done
Rupert Salsinger.</p>

<p>By and by they come to Columbus Circle, and in Columbus Circle there are
many little groups of citizens, and each group is gathered around a guy
standing on a box making a speech, so there are maybe ten different groups, and
ten different guys making speeches, although each guy is only talking to his
own group, but they are all talking at once, so they make quite a racket.</p>

<p>Now of course all this is a very familiar scene to anybody that ever goes
through Columbus Circle in the evening, but it seems that Calvin Colby never
before witnesses such a thing, as he does not visit Columbus Circle since
infancy, and he is greatly astonished at what he beholds, and asks Rupert
Salsinger what is the meaning of this.</p>

<p>Well, it seems that Rupert Salsinger knows all about the matter, and in fact
it seems that Rupert Salsinger often takes part in these meetings personally
when he has nothing else to do, and he explains to Calvin Colby that each of
the speakers has a message of some kind to deliver to the people about one
thing and another, and they are delivering them in Columbus Circle because it
is a sort of public forum, and the coppers are not permitted to bother anybody
with a message here, although they may run them bow-legged if they try to
deliver any message anywhere else.</p>

<p>Now Calvin Colby becomes greatly interested in this proposition and he
listens in here and there on different groups, but he is unable to make heads
or tails of what the speakers are talking about, except that most of them are
weighing in the sacks on the rich, and on the government, and on this and that,
and finally Calvin Colby says to Rupert Salsinger, like this:</p>

<p>'Why,' Calvin Colby says, 'the trouble with these parties is they are all
over the layout. They are scattering their play too much. What we need here is
a little centralisation of ideas. Get me a box,' Calvin says.</p>

<p>Well, all the boxes around and about are occupied, but by this time, what
with the beer, and the old-fashioneds, and all, Rupert Salsinger is a character
of great determination, and he goes up to one speaker and yanks the box right
from under him without saying aye, yes, or no, and this action leaves the
speaker flat in Columbus Circle, but it seems that the speaker is about all out
of ideas, anyway, and cannot think of anything more to say, so he does not mind
losing his box as much as you might expect.</p>

<p>Then Rupert takes the box and plants it right in the centre of all the
groups, and Calvin Colby gets up on the box and begins letting out loud yells
to attract attention. Naturally Calvin Colby can out-yell any of the speakers
in Columbus Circle, because he is fresh, and furthermore he is full of
old-fashioneds, and it is well known that there is nothing like old-fashioneds
to help anybody yell.</p>

<p>Well, everyone in the Circle turns at once to see what the yelling is about
and when they see a party in evening clothes, with a high hat and a white-lined
opera cape on, naturally they are somewhat impressed, and they leave all the
other speakers and gather around Calvin Colby.</p>

<p>Some think at first that maybe he is selling a patent medicine, or
ballyhooing a dance hall with forty hostesses, and they expect to see his shirt
bosom light up with an ad on it, as they cannot figure any other reason for
anybody in such a make-up to be in Columbus Circle, but when Calvin Colby
finally gets a big crowd around him, including not only the citizens who are
listening to the other speakers, but many characters, male and female, who
happen to be passing along the sidewalks and hear his yells, he speaks to them
as follows, and to wit:</p>

<p>'Comrades,' Calvin Colby says, 'when I think of all the injustice in this
world it almost makes me bust right out crying. My heart bleeds. I am very sad.
All humanity cries out "Justice, justice," but what is the answer; Nothing,
comrades,' he says.</p>

<p>Now at this point somebody back in the crowd pegs an egg at Calvin Colby's
high hat, and cries out in a loud, coarse voice:</p>

<p>'Look at the daffydill.'</p>

<p>The egg just misses Calvin Colby's hat and continues on and strikes a member
of the Communist party on the chin, and the member of the Communist party is
slightly irritated, as he says he can use the egg for breakfast if it does not
break when it meets his chin.</p>

<p>Well, naturally this interruption annoys Calvin Colby no little, and he
stops a moment and tries to see who it is that is guilty of such uncouth
conduct, and then he says:</p>

<p>'Comrades,' he says, 'if the jerk who just hurls the aforesaid remark and
egg at me will kindly hold still until I reach him, I will guarantee to yank
one of his arms off and beat his brains out with it.'</p>

<p>At this the crowd cheers Calvin Colby quite some, and there are cries for
him to continue his address, although Calvin Colby has half a notion to stop
right there and go to work on the party who pegs the egg, because such a course
promises more fun for Calvin Colby than making a speech, but finally he resumes
as follows:</p>

<p>'No, comrades,' he says, 'there is no justice, and to prove it I wish to
present to you my friend, my pal, my comrade, Mr. Rupert Salsinger, who will
now address you.'</p>

<p>So he makes room for Rupert Salsinger on the box, and Rupert puts on a
really wonderful speech, because it seems that Rupert is not only a
natural-born speaker, but he knows extracts from great speeches by such
characters as Father Coughlin, Patrick Henry, F. D. Roosevelt, Abraham Lincoln
and Robert Ingersoll, and he drops in these extracts here and there as he goes
along, and they are very effective.</p>

<p>He tells of his own personal experiences with representatives of the
capitalistic system, and while he does not mention them by name, he undoubtedly
means Hymie Minsk and old man Bilby, and Rupert's remarks about his own
suffering touch every heart, and there are cries of pity and rage from all
parts of the crowd, although Rupert himself afterward admits that maybe he does
give Hymie and old man Bilby a shade the worst of it in his statements.</p>

<p>By the time Rupert finishes, his audience is greatly excited, and Calvin
Colby is sitting on the edge of the box half asleep, so Rupert wakes him up to
make some more remarks, but now Calvin Colby is slightly bored by his
surroundings and wishes to get away from this spot, and all he can think of to
say is as follows:</p>

<p>'Comrades,' he says, 'let us stop talking, and go into action. The cry,' he
says, 'is forward!'</p>

<p>And with this, Calvin Colby starts off down Broadway, walking in the middle
of the street, and all he is thinking of at the moment is to remove himself
from Columbus Circle, and Rupert starts off with him, but all the other
citizens present fall in behind them, so there they are leading a big march.
There are only a few hundred citizens behind them when they start, but before
they go two blocks this number increases to several thousand, because naturally
the spectacle of a character in a high hat and a white-lined opera cape leading
a procession down Broadway is most intriguing to one and all who behold same,
and everybody wishes to find out what it means.</p>

<p>Of course Calvin and Rupert Salsinger have no idea where they are going when
they start off, and when they arrive at Fiftieth and Broadway, Calvin Colby is
getting sick and tired of walking, and wishes one of his cars will come along
and pick him up, and furthermore he is yearning for a few old-fashioned
cocktails.</p>

<p>In fact, Calvin Colby is getting ready to cop a sneak on his followers, when
Rupert Salsinger points out old man Bilby's shoe store, which of course is
closed at this hour, as the seat of much of the injustice to him, and the
member of the Communist party, who is in the procession, still thinking about
the loss of the egg, hears what Rupert says, and steps over on the sidewalk and
kicks in old man Bilby's door.</p>

<p>Well, in five minutes old man Bilby's shoe store is a total wreck, and
everybody has a pair of shoes, including many characters who are never in the
procession at all, and are by no means entitled to same. There is great
confusion, and some of the shoes get all mixed up in this confusion, and in
fact for weeks afterward parties are around Broadway with odd shoes trying to
match them up.</p>

<p>Naturally the commotion brings out a number of officers of the law, who go
around inquiring what is coming off here, and when they are unable to learn
what is coming off, they start slapping citizens right and left with their
nightsticks, and the result is a great deal of new business for the near-by
hospitals.</p>

<p>But this part of it no longer interests Calvin Colby and Rupert Salsinger,
who retire from the scene and go elsewhere, but not before Rupert Salsinger
gets into the store and picks out a pair of shoes for himself and carries them
off under his arm.</p>

<p>Well, by and by the reporters from the newspapers arrive on the scene and
start getting interviews here and there about the goings on, and it seems from
the stories in the papers the next morning that the reporters learn that it is
all the upshot of a great new movement for social justice organized by Rupert
Salsinger, a famous young student of such matters, and supported by Calvin
Colby, the well-known young multimillionaire thinker, although of course it is
a big surprise to Rupert Salsinger to learn that he is famous, and a much
bigger surprise to Calvin Colby to hear that he is a thinker, and in fact this
sounds like libel to Calvin Colby, when he gets around to reading it.</p>

<p>But it seems that what the newspapers see in this movement for social
justice led by such young characters as Rupert Salsinger and Calvin Colby, more
than anything else, is a revolution of youth against the old order, and in fact
the papers make it a matter of great importance and by 8 a.m. the next morning
the reporters and photographers from the afternoon bladders are almost breaking
down the doors of Calvin Colby's apartment on Park Avenue to interview him and
take his picture.</p>

<p>Naturally, Calvin Colby is still in the hay at such an hour, and he does not
wake up until 1.30 p.m. and by this time he does not remember about the
movement for social justice, and in fact he will be greatly nonplussed to find
himself sleeping with such a character as Rupert Salsinger if it is not for the
fact that Calvin Colby is accustomed to finding himself sleeping with all kinds
of characters.</p>

<p>He wakes Rupert Salsinger up and asks him what about a little of the hair of
the dog that bites them, but Rupert is very ill, and all he can bear is a
little straight Scotch, and then Rupert commences to recall vaguely some of the
events of the night before, when Calvin Colby's butler brings in the morning
papers, and tells them that fifty reporters and photographers are still waiting
outside to see Calvin Colby, and that they are getting fretful, and that
moreover Calvin Colby's loving parents are calling up every few minutes,
wishing to know what he means by becoming a thinker.</p>

<p>Then Calvin Colby commences remembering a few things himself, and he worries
no little about how he is going to explain to his loving parents. Naturally he
cannot face reporters and photographers while he is in such a state of mind, so
he gives Rupert Salsinger a little more straight Scotch, and lends Rupert a
dressing-gown, and sends him out to see the reporters and photographers.</p>

<p>Well, Rupert Salsinger gives them quite an interview, and in fact he repeats
as much of the speech he makes in Columbus Circle as he can remember, including
the extracts from the speeches of F. D. Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln, and he
tells them that he and Calvin Colby will continue this movement for social
justice until the bad place freezes over, if necessary, because by now the
straight Scotch is working very good in Rupert Salsinger, and he is by no means
at any loss for words.</p>

<p>Now Rupert Salsinger is a very serious-minded young character and by no
means a chump, and he sees that all this publicity may lead somewhere, so what
does he do in the next few days but organise the American Amalgamation for
Social Justice, with himself as president, and Calvin Colby as treasurer, and
Calvin Colby's loving parents are so proud of their son becoming prominent at
something else besides spilling dolls out of his automobiles that they donate
five thousand slugs to the cause.</p>

<p>Furthermore, they settle with old man Bilby for the wrecking of his shoe
store, and the loss of his shoes, including the pair taken away by Rupert
Salsinger, although of course nobody but Rupert knows about these shoes, and he
does not mention the matter publicly.</p>

<p>But Calvin Colby is getting sick and tired of all this business, because the
reporters are always after him for interviews, and it is commencing to
interfere with his occupation of getting around, especially as Rupert Salsinger
is always after him, too, telling him to do this and that, and one thing and
another, and Calvin Colby is delighted when Rupert announces himself as a
candidate for Congress on the Social Justice ticket, because Calvin figures
that with Rupert in Congress he will not bother him any more, and he can resume
getting around just where he leaves off.</p>

<p>Well, it seems that about the time Rupert Salsinger makes his announcement,
Tammany Hall is greatly dissatisfied with the character who already represents
it in Congress from Rupert's district, because he often votes in a manner that
is by no means to the interest of this splendid organization, so somebody from
the Hall has a talk with Rupert Salsinger, and reports that he is an honest,
clean, upright young character, who is by no means sore at Tammany, or at least
not so sore that he can never get over it.</p>

<p>Then it seems that Tammany quietly passes the word around Rupert Salsinger's
district to vote for this honest, clean, upright young character, and such a
word means that Rupert is 1 to 20 in the betting to be elected, even on a
platform for social justice, and about this time Rupert begins thinking more
than somewhat of Miss Minnie Schultz, and of how much he loves her.</p>

<p>Rupert is so busy that it is quite a spell since he finds leisure to get
over to Tenth Avenue to see Miss Minnie Schultz and he requests Calvin Colby,
as a personal favour, to step over and explain to Miss Minnie Schultz why he
cannot appear before her in person.</p>

<p>So Calvin Colby goes over to Tenth Avenue and locates Miss Minnie Schultz at
her papa's delicatessen store, and explains to her about Rupert, and Calvin
Colby is greatly surprised to notice that Miss Minnie Schultz is very
beautiful.</p>

<p>He notices that she has taffy-coloured hair, and big blue eyes, and a lovely
speaking voice, and hands like the ears of little tiny white rabbits, and feet
like little tiny mice, and a complexion like Grade-A milk, and a shape that is
wonderful to behold, and great intelligence, and charm, and in fact Miss Minnie
Schultz is the first doll Calvin Colby ever beholds that he does not figure a
plaintiff.</p>

<p>He also notices a character skulking in the background of Miss Minnie
Schultz whose name seems to be Gus Schmelk, and whose features seem to be very
familiar to Calvin Colby, and also very distasteful, especially as this Gus
Schmelk seems to be on very friendly terms with Miss Minnie Schultz, and in
fact in the presence of Calvin Colby he gives her a pat on the pistol pocket,
causing Calvin Colby's blood to boil out of loyalty to Rupert Salsinger.</p>

<p>However, Miss Minnie Schultz seems quite interested in hearing about Rupert,
and says she hopes and trusts he is enjoying the best of health, and that he
will come to see her soon, though she realizes from what she reads in the
papers how busy he is, and she also says that she is personally as well and as
happy as can be expected, and that business in her papa's delicatessen store is
picking up.</p>

<p>Well, Calvin Colby reports much of the above situation to Rupert Salsinger,
especially about Gus Schmelk, and tells Rupert that Gus impresses him as a low,
degraded character, who will steal another's doll without any compunction of
conscience whatever, and in fact Calvin Colby says to Rupert like this:</p>

<p>'If I am you,' he says, 'I will dispense with this social justice for a while
and look after my interests with Miss Minnie Schultz. It is seldom in my
career,' Calvin says, 'that I see such a shape as Miss Minnie Schultz
possesses.'</p>

<p>Well, Rupert Salsinger sighs, and says he realizes that Calvin Colby's
statements are only too true, especially about Gus Schmelk, and also about Miss
Minnie Schultz's shape, but Rupert says he feels that social justice must come
first with him above all else, even Miss Minnie Schultz's shape.</p>

<p>Then Rupert says to Calvin Colby:</p>

<p>'Comrade,' he says, 'I realize that you loathe and despise all characters of
a female nature, but,' he says, 'I am going to ask you to make a great
sacrifice for me. I will deem it an act of fealty to our cause, and of personal
friendship,' Rupert says, 'if you will occasionally go over to Tenth Avenue and
do anything you can to protect me in that direction from vipers in my bosom and
snakes in the grass.'</p>

<p>There are tears in Rupert's eyes as he makes this request, and naturally
Calvin Colby promises to assist him in this emergency, and presently between
looking after Rupert's interests with Miss Minnie Schultz and signing cheques
as treasurer of the American Amalgamation for Social Justice for Rupert's
campaign, Calvin Colby finds little time for his occupation of getting
around.</p>

<p>Now in the meantime, in spite of being so busy, Rupert Salsinger finds
himself brooding no little over Miss Minnie Schultz and Gus Schmelk, and
finally one day he decides that he can spare a couple of hours to go over to
Tenth Avenue and see Miss Minnie Schultz and present his proposal of marriage
to her in person, so he calls her up and requests an interview with her, and it
seems she can tell by the tone of his voice what is on his chest, and she says
all right but to be sure and get over in an hour.</p>

<p>So Rupert Salsinger puts everything else aside, and dresses himself up in a
new suit of clothes which he purchases from the treasury of the Amalgamated
Association for Social Justice as part of his campaign expenses, and puts on
the new shoes that he secures at old man Bilby's shoe store, and starts out
from Calvin Colby's residence on Park Avenue, where Rupert is living ever since
the first night he lands there.</p>

<p>Well, Rupert is passing the corner of Fiftieth Street and Broadway when who
does he see standing in front of Mindy's restaurant but Hymie Minsk, the horse
player, and then Rupert suddenly remembers that while social justice is going
forward very nicely in most quarters that he never really gets justice from
Hymie Minsk.</p>

<p>So Rupert Salsinger steps up behind Hymie, and takes him by the nape of the
neck and kicks Hymie's pants up the street to Fifty-third, using his new shoes
for this purpose, and, what is more, doing a much better job on Hymie than
Hymie does on him, as Hymie has no books whatsoever in his hip pocket to slow
up Rupert's kicking.</p>

<p>When he finally lets Hymie go with a final kick in the pants, Rupert starts
across Fifty-third Street towards Tenth Avenue, but after he goes a couple of
blocks he notices that his feet are giving him great pain, and he realizes that
his new shoes must be too tight for him, and what with his walking, and the
extra exertion of kicking Hymie Minsk's pants, these shoes are commencing to
pinch his puppies quite some.</p>

<p>The pain finally becomes so great that Rupert sits down on the steps of a
school house and takes off his shoes to let his feet stop aching, and he sits
there for anyway fifteen minutes, when it occurs to him that the hour Miss
Minnie Schultz mentions is up, so he tries to put the shoes back on his feet
again, but it seems his feet swell up to such an extent that the shoes will not
go on again, so Rupert resumes his journey in his stocking feet, but carrying
the shoes in his hand.</p>

<p>When he arrives in sight of the delicatessen store conducted by Miss Minnie
Schultz's papa, he sees Miss Minnie Schultz standing on the sidewalk out in
front, and he also sees Gus Schmelk walking across the street, and disappearing
inside his own store, which is a scene that is most odious to Rupert Salsinger
although he does not see a large automobile with Calvin Colby in it just going
around the corner.</p>

<p>Well, Rupert Salsinger hastens forward with a glad smile, and he tips his
hat with the hand which is not carrying the shoes, and he says to Miss Minnie
Schultz like this:</p>

<p>'Minnie,' Rupert says, 'I love you with all my heart and soul, and now that
my future is open before me, bright and shining, I wish you to be my wife, and
never mind what your papa says to the contrary about Gus Schmelk. He is
strictly a wrong gee. I mean Gus Schmelk,' Rupert says. 'Let us be married at
once, and my friend, my pal, my comrade, Mr. Calvin Colby, will stand up with
us as my best man.'</p>

<p>'Rupert,' Miss Minnie Schultz says, 'if you are here fifteen minutes ago, I
will undoubtedly accept you. When you call me on the telephone and make an
appointment for an interview with me, I say to myself, I wait all these years
for Rupert to speak, and now I will give him just one more hour of my life, and
not one minute more, for another is requesting my hand. On the expiration of
the hour to the dot,' Miss Minnie Schultz says, 'I pledge myself to him.
Rupert,' she says, 'as far as I am personally concerned you are a goner.'</p>

<p>Naturally, Rupert Salsinger is greatly vexed to hear this news, and in fact
he is so vexed that he takes the tight shoes that are the cause of his
tardiness, and throws them as far as he can, and as straight as he can, which
is plumb across the street and through the plate-glass window of Gus Schmelk's
delicatessen store.</p>

<p>The next thing anybody knows, Rupert Salsinger is hastening up Tenth Avenue
in his stocking feet, and Gus Schmelk is right behind him calling him names of
such a crude nature that Miss Minnie Schultz retires to her papa's delicatessen
store, although this does not prevent her from seeing a character leave Gus
Schmelk's store with Rupert's tight shoes under his arm, and it does not
prevent her from recognizing this character as the member of the Communist
parry.</p>

<p>Well, I see in the papers that Congressman Rupert Salsinger is going to
marry some society doll in Washington, who is a widow with plenty of money left
to her by her late husband, but I do not believe Rupert will be any happier
than Calvin Colby, who is very busy at this time opening the twenty-second
branch of the Schultz-Colby Delicatessen Stores, Inc., and who is greatly
pleased over being married to Miss Minnie Schultz.</p>

<p>But although Gus Schmelk's store is in the new combination, and Gus himself
is a member of the Board of Directors of same, Calvin Colby never really
forgets that Gus Schmelk is the party who almost ruins his high hat with an egg
in Columbus Circle the night Calvin makes the public address.</p>

<h3><a name="Lonely_Heart" id="Lonely_Heart">Lonely Heart</a></h3>
<p>It seems that one spring day, a character by the name of Nicely-Nicely Jones
arrives in a ward in a hospital in the City of Newark, N.J., with such a severe
case of pneumonia that the attending physician, who is a horse player at heart,
and very absent-minded, writes 100, 40 and 10 on the chart over Nicely-Nicely's
bed.</p>

<p>It comes out afterward that what the physician means is that it is 100 to 1
in his line that Nicely-Nicely does not recover at all, 40 to 1 that he will
not last a week, and 10 to 1 that if he does get well he will never be the same
again.</p>

<p>Well, Nicely-Nicely is greatly discouraged when he sees this price against
him, because he is personally a chalk eater when it comes to price, a chalk
eater being a character who always plays the short-priced favourites, and he
can see that such a long shot as he is has very little chance to win. In fact,
he is so discouraged that he does not even feel like taking a little of the
price against him to show.</p>

<p>Afterward there is some criticism of Nicely-Nicely among the citizens around
Mindy's restaurant on Broadway, because he does not advise them of this marker,
as these citizens are always willing to bet that what Nicely-Nicely dies of
will be over-feeding and never anything small like pneumonia, for Nicely-Nicely
is known far and wide as a character who dearly loves to commit eating.</p>

<p>But Nicely-Nicely is so discouraged that he does not as much as send them
word that he is sick, let alone anything about the price. He just pulls the
covers up over his head and lies there waiting for the finish and thinking to
himself what a tough thing it is to pass away of pneumonia, and especially in
Newark, N.J., and nobody along Broadway knows of his predicament until
Nicely-Nicely appears in person some months later and relates this story to
me.</p>

<p>So now I will tell you about Nicely-Nicely Jones, who is called
Nicely-Nicely because any time anybody asks him how he is feeling, or how
things are going with him, he always says nicely, nicely, in a very pleasant
tone of voice, although generally this is by no means the gospel truth,
especially about how he is going.</p>

<p>He is a character of maybe forty-odd, and he is short, and fat, and very
good-natured, and what he does for a livelihood is the best he can, which is an
occupation that is greatly overcrowded at all times along Broadway.</p>

<p>Mostly, Nicely-Nicely follows the races, playing them whenever he has
anything to play them with, but anyway following them, and the reason he finds
himself in Newark, N.J., in the first place is because of a business
proposition in connection with the races. He hears of a barber in Newark, N.J.,
who likes to make a wager on a sure thing now and then, and Nicely-Nicely goes
over there to tell him about a sure thing that is coming up at Pimlico the very
next Tuesday.</p>

<p>Nicely-Nicely figures that the barber will make a wager on this sure thing
and cut him in on the profits, but it seems that somebody else gets to the
barber the week before with a sure thing that is coming up a Monday, and the
barber bets on this sure thing, and the sure thing blows, and now the barber
will have to shave half of Newark, N.J., to catch even.</p>

<p>Nicely-Nicely always claims that the frost he meets when he approaches the
barber with his sure thing gives him a cold that results in the pneumonia I am
speaking of, and furthermore that his nervous system is so disorganized by the
barber chasing him nine blocks with a razor in his hand that he has no vitality
left to resist the germs.</p>

<p>But at that it seems that he has enough vitality left to beat the pneumonia
by so far the attending physician is somewhat embarrassed, although afterward
he claims that he makes a mistake in chalking up the 100, 40 and 10 on
Nicely-Nicely's chart. The attending physician claims he really means the
character in the bed next to Nicely-Nicely, who passes away of lockjaw the
second day after Nicely-Nicely arrives.</p>

<p>Well, while he is convalescing in the hospital of this pneumonia,
Nicely-Nicely has a chance to do plenty of thinking, and what he thinks about
most is the uselessness of the life he leads all these years, and how he has
nothing to show for same except some high-class knowledge of race horses, which
at this time is practically a drug on the market.</p>

<p>There are many other patients in the same ward with Nicely-Nicely, and he
sees their ever-loving wives, and daughters, and maybe their sweet-peas
visiting them, and hears their cheerful chatter, and he gets to thinking that
here he is without chick or child, and no home to go to, and it just about
breaks his heart.</p>

<p>He gets to thinking of how he will relish a soft, gentle, loving hand on his
brow at this time, and finally he makes a pass at one of the nurses, figuring
she may comfort his lonely hours, but what she lays on his brow is a beautiful
straight right cross, and furthermore she hollers watch, murder, police, and
Nicely-Nicely has to pretend he has a relapse and is in a delirium to avoid
being mistreated by the internes.</p>

<p>As Nicely-Nicely begins getting some of his strength back, he takes to
thinking, too, of such matters as food, and when Nicely-Nicely thinks of food
it is generally very nourishing food, such as a nice double sirloin, smothered
with chops, and thinking of these matters, and of hamburgers, and wiener
schnitzel and goulash with noodles, and lamb stew, adds to his depression,
especially when they bring him the light diet provided for invalids by the
hospital.</p>

<p>He takes to reading to keep himself from thinking of his favourite dishes,
and of his solitary life, and one day in a bundle of old magazines and
newspapers that they give him to read, he comes upon a bladder that is called
the <i>Matrimonial Tribune</i>, which seems to be all about marriage, and in this
<i>Matrimonial Tribune</i> Nicely-Nicely observes an advertisement that reads as
follows:</p>

<center>LONELY HEART</center>

<p>Widow of middle age, no children, cheerful companion, neat,
excellent cook, owner of nice farm in Central New Jersey, wishes to meet
home-loving gentleman of not more than fifty who need not necessarily be
possessed of means but who will appreciate warm, tender companionship and
pleasant home. Object, matrimony. Address Lonely Heart, this paper.</p>

<p>Well, Nicely-Nicely feels romance stirring in his bosom as he reads these
lines, because he is never married, and has no idea that marriage is as
described in this advertisement. So what does he do but write a letter to
Lonely Heart in care of the <i>Matrimonial Tribune</i> stating that he is looking for
a warm, tender companionship, and a pleasant home, and an excellent cook,
especially an excellent cook, all his life, and the next thing he knows he is
gazing into what at first seems to be an old-fashioned round cheese, but which
he finally makes out as the face of a large Judy seated at his bedside.</p>

<p>She is anywhere between forty and fifty-five years of age, and she is as big
and raw-boned as a first baseman, but she is by no means a crow. In fact, she
is rather nice-looking, except that she has a pair of eyes as pale as hens'
eggs, and these eyes never change expression.</p>

<p>She asks Nicely-Nicely as many questions as an assistant district attorney,
and especially if he has any money, and does he have any relatives, and
Nicely-Nicely is able to state truthfully that he is all out of both, although
she does not seem to mind. She wishes to know about his personal habits, and
Nicely-Nicely says they are all good, but of course he does not mention his
habit of tapping out any time a 4-to-5 shot comes along, which is as bad a
habit as anybody can have, and finally she says she is well satisfied with him
and will be pleased to marry him when he is able to walk.</p>

<p>She has a short, sharp voice that reminds Nicely-Nicely of a tough starter
talking to the jockeys at the post, and she never seems to smile, and, take her
all around, the chances are she is not such a character as Nicely-Nicely will
choose as his ever-loving wife if he has the pick of a herd, but he figures
that she is not bad for an offhand draw.</p>

<p>So Nicely-Nicely and the Widow Crumb are married, and they go to live on her
farm in Central New Jersey, and it is a very nice little farm, to be sure, if
you care for farms, but it is ten miles from the nearest town, and in a very
lonesome country, and furthermore there are no neighbours handy, and the Widow
Crumb does not have a telephone or even a radio in her house.</p>

<p>In fact, about all she has on this farm are a couple of cows, and a horse,
and a very old joskin with a chin whisker and rheumatism and a mean look, whose
name seems to be Harley something, and who also seems to be the Widow Crumb's
hired hand. Nicely-Nicely can see at once that Harley has no use for him, but
afterward he learns that Harley has no use for anybody much, not even
himself.</p>

<p>Well, it comes on supper-time the first night. Nicely-Nicely is there and he
is delighted to observe that the Widow Crumb is making quite an uproar in the
kitchen with the pots and pans, and this uproar is music to Nicely-Nicely's
ears as by now he is in the mood to put on the hot meat very good, and he is
wondering if the Widow Crumb is as excellent a cook as she lets on in her
advertisement.</p>

<p>It turns out that she is even better. It turns out that she is as fine a
cook as ever straddles a skillet, and the supper she spreads for Nicely-Nicely
is too good for a king. There is round steak hammered flat and fried in a pan,
with thick cream gravy, and hot biscuits, and corn on the cob, and turnip
greens, and cottage-fried potatoes, and lettuce with hot bacon grease poured
over it, and apple-pie, and coffee, and I do not know what all else, and
Nicely-Nicely almost founders himself, because it is the first time since he
leaves the hospital that he gets a chance to move into real food.</p>

<p>Harley, the old joskin, eats with them, and Nicely-Nicely notices that there
is a fourth place set at the table, and he figures that maybe another hired
hand is going to show up, but nobody appears to fill the vacant chair, and at
first Nicely-Nicely is glad of it, as it gives him more room in which to
eat.</p>

<p>But then Nicely-Nicely notices that the Widow Crumb loads the plate at the
vacant place with even more food than she does any of the others, and all
through the meal Nicely-Nicely keeps expecting someone to come in and knock off
these victuals. Nobody ever appears, however, and when they are through eating,
the Widow Crumb clears up the extra place the same as the others, and scrapes
the food off the plate into a garbage pail.</p>

<p>Well, of course, Nicely-Nicely is somewhat perplexed by this proceeding, but
he does not ask any questions, because where he comes from only suckers go
around asking questions. The next morning at breakfast, and again at dinner,
and in fact at every meal put on the table the extra place is fixed, and the
Widow Crumb goes through the same performance of serving the food to this
place, and afterward throwing it away, and while Nicely-Nicely commences
thinking it is a great waste of excellent food, he keeps his trap closed.</p>

<p>Now being the Widow Crumb's husband is by no means a bad dodge, as she is
anything but a gabby Judy, and will go all day long without saying more than a
few words, and as Nicely-Nicely is a character who likes to chat this gives him
a chance to do all the talking, although she never seems to be listening to him
much. She seldom asks him to do any work, except now and then to help the old
joskin around the barn, so Nicely-Nicely commences to figure this is about as
soft a drop-in as anybody can wish.</p>

<p>The only drawback is that sometimes the Widow Crumb likes to sit on
Nicely-Nicely's lap of an evening, and as he does not have much lap to begin
with, and it is getting less every day under her feeding, this is quite a
handicap, but he can see that it comes of her affectionate nature, and he bears
up the best he can.</p>

<p>One evening after they are married several months, the Widow Crumb is
sitting on what is left of Nicely-Nicely's lap, and she puts her arms around
his neck, and speaks to him as follows:</p>

<p>'Nicely,' she says, 'do you love me?'</p>

<p>'Love you?' Nicely-Nicely says. 'Why, I love you like anything. Maybe more.
You are a wonderful cook. How can I help loving you?' he says.</p>

<p>'Well,' the Widow Crumb says, 'do you ever stop to consider that if anything
happens to you, I will be left here lone and lorn, because you do not have any
means with which to provide for me after you are gone?'</p>

<p>'What do you mean after I am gone?' Nicely-Nicely says. 'I am not going
anywhere.'</p>

<p>'Life is always a very uncertain proposition,' the Widow Crumb says. 'Who
can say when something is apt to happen to you and take you away from me,
leaving me without a cent of life insurance?'</p>

<p>Naturally, Nicely-Nicely has to admit to himself that what she says is very
true, and of course he never gives the matter a thought before, because he
figures from the way the Widow Crumb feeds him that she must have some scratch
of her own stashed away somewhere, although this is the first time the subject
of money is ever mentioned between them since they are married.</p>

<p>'Why,' Nicely-Nicely says, 'you are quite right, and I will get my life
insured as soon as I get enough strength to go out and raise a few dibs. Yes,
indeed,' Nicely-Nicely says, 'I will take care of this situation promptly.'</p>

<p>Well, the Widow Crumb says there is no sense in waiting on a matter as
important as this, and that she will provide the money for the payment of the
premiums herself, and for Nicely-Nicely to forget about going out to raise
anything, as she cannot bear to have him out of her sight for any length of
time, and then she gets to telling Nicely-Nicely what she is going to give him
for breakfast, and he forgets about the insurance business.</p>

<p>But the next thing Nicely-Nicely knows, a thin character with a nose like a
herring comes out from town, and there is another character with him who has
whiskers that smell of corn whisky, but who seems to be a doctor, and in
practically no time at all Nicely-Nicely's life is insured for five thousand
dollars, with double indemnity if he gets used up by accident, and
Nicely-Nicely is greatly pleased by this arrangement because he sees that he is
now worth something for the first time in his career, although everybody on
Broadway claims it is a terrible overlay by the insurance company when they
hear the story.</p>

<p>Well, several months more go by, and Nicely-Nicely finds life on the farm
very pleasant and peaceful as there is nothing much for him to do but eat and
sleep, and he often finds himself wondering how he ever endures his old life,
following the races and associating with the low characters of the turf.</p>

<p>He gets along first class with the Widow Crumb and never has a cross word
with her, and he even makes friends with the old joskin, Harley, by helping him
with his work, although Nicely-Nicely is really not fitted by nature for much
work, and what he likes best at the farm is the eating and sleeping, especially
the eating.</p>

<p>For a while he finds it difficult to get as much sleep as he requires,
because the Widow Crumb is a great hand for staying up late reading books in
their bedroom by kerosene lamp, and at the same time eating molasses candy
which she personally manufactures, and sometimes she does both in bed, and the
molasses candy bothers Nicely-Nicely no little until he becomes accustomed to
it.</p>

<p>Once he tries reading one of her books to put himself to sleep after she
dozes off ahead of him, but he discovers that it is all about nothing but
spiritualism, and about parties in this life getting in touch with characters
in the next world, and Nicely-Nicely has no interest whatever in matters of
this nature, although he personally knows a character by the name of Spooks
McGurk who claims to be a spiritualist, and who makes a nice thing of it in
connection with tips on the races, until a race-track fuzz catches up with
him.</p>

<p>Nicely-Nicely never discusses the books with the Widow Crumb, because in the
first place he figures it is none of his business, and in the second place, the
more she reads the better chance he has of getting to sleep before she starts
snoring, because it seems that as a snorer the Widow Crumb is really
all-America material, although of course Nicely-Nicely is too much of a
gentleman to make an issue of this.</p>

<p>She gives him three meals every day, and every meal is better than the last,
and finally Nicely-Nicely is as fat as a goose, and can scarcely wobble. But he
notices that the Widow Crumb never once fails to set the fourth place that
nobody ever fills, and furthermore he suddenly commences to notice that she
always puts the best cuts of meat, and the best of everything else on the plate
at this place, even though she throws it all away afterward.</p>

<p>Well, this situation preys on Nicely-Nicely's mind, as he cannot bear to see
all this good fodder going to waste, so one morning he gets hold of old Harley
and puts the siphon on him, because by this time Harley talks freely with
Nicely-Nicely, although Nicely-Nicely can see that Harley is somewhat simple in
spots and his conversation seldom makes much sense.</p>

<p>Anyway, he asks Harley what the Widow Crumb's idea is about the extra place
at the table, and Harley says like this: 'Why,' he says, 'the place is for
Jake.'</p>

<p>'Jake who?' Nicely-Nicely says.</p>

<p>'I do not recall his other name,' Harley says. 'He is her third or fourth
husband, I do not remember which. Jake is the only one the Widow Crumb ever
loves, although she does not discover this until after Jake departs. So,'
Harley says, 'in memory of Jake she always sets his place at the table, and
gives him the best she has. She misses Jake and wishes to feel that he is still
with her.'</p>

<p>'What happens to Jake?' Nicely-Nicely says.</p>

<p>'Arsenic,' Harley says. 'Jake departs ten years ago.'</p>

<p>Well, of course all this is news to Nicely-Nicely, and he becomes very
thoughtful to be sure, because in all the time he is married to her the Widow
Crumb does not crack to him about her other husbands, and in fact Nicely-Nicely
has no idea there is ever more than one.</p>

<p>'What happens to the others?' he says. 'Do they depart the same as
Jake?'</p>

<p>'Yes,' Harley says, 'they all depart. One by one. I remember Number Two
well. In fact, you remind me of him. Carbon monoxide,' Harley says. 'A charcoal
stove in his room. It is most ingenious. The coroner says Number Three commits
suicide by hanging himself with a rope in the barn loft. Number Three is small
and weak, and it is no trouble whatever to handle him.</p>

<p>'Then comes Jake,' Harley says, 'unless Jake is Number Three and the hanging
item is Number Four. I do not remember exactly. But the Widow Crumb never
employs arsenic or other matters of this nature again. It is too slow. Jake
lingers for hours. Besides,' Harley says, 'she realizes it may leave traces if
anybody happens to get nosy.</p>

<p>'Jake is a fine-looking character,' Harley says. 'But a ne'er-do-well. He is
a plumber from Salt Lake City, Utah, and has a hearty laugh. He is always
telling funny stories. He is a great eater, even better than you, and he loves
beans the way the Widow Crumb cooks them, with bacon and tomatoes. He suffers
no little from the arsenic. He gets it in his beans. Number Five comes upon a
black widow spider in his bed. He is no good. I mean Number Five.'</p>

<p>Well, by this time, Nicely-Nicely is very thoughtful to be sure, because
what Harley says is commencing to sound somewhat disquieting.</p>

<p>'Number Six steps on a plank in the doorway of the house that drops a
two-hundred-pound keystone on his head,' Harley says. 'The Widow Crumb
personally figures this out herself. She is very bright. It is like a figure-4
trap, and has to be very accurate. An inch one way or the other, and the stone
misses Number Six. I remember he has a big wen on the back of his neck. He is a
carpenter from Keokuk, Iowa,' Harley says.</p>

<p>'Why,' Nicely-Nicely says, 'do you mean to say that the Widow Crumb
purposely arranges to use up husbands in the manner you describe?'</p>

<p>'Oh, sure,' Harley says. 'Why do you suppose she marries them? It is a good
living to her because of the insurance,' he says, 'although,' he says, 'to show
you how bright she is, she does not insure Number Five for a dime, so people
can never say she is making a business of the matter. He is a total loss to
her, but it quiets talk. I am wondering,' Harley says, 'what she will think up
for you.'</p>

<p>Well, Nicely-Nicely now commences to wonder about this, too, and he hopes
and trusts that whatever she thinks up it will not be a black widow spider,
because if there is one thing Nicely-Nicely despises, it is insects.
Furthermore, he does not approve of hanging, or of dropping weights on
people.</p>

<p>After giving the matter much thought, he steps into the house and mentions
to the Widow Crumb that he will like to pay a little visit to town, figuring
that if he can get to town, she will never see him again for heel dust.</p>

<p>But he finds that the Widow Crumb is by no means in favour of the idea of
him visiting the town. In fact, she says it will bring great sorrow to her if
he absents himself from her side more than two minutes, and moreover, she
points out that it is coming on winter, and that the roads are bad, and she
cannot spare the horse for such a trip just now.</p>

<p>Well, Nicely-Nicely says he is a fair sort of walker and, in fact, he
mentions that he once walks from Saratoga Springs to Albany to avoid a
bookmaker who claims there is a slight difference between them, but the Widow
Crumb says she will not hear of him trying to walk to town because it may
develop varicose veins in his legs.</p>

<p>In fact, Nicely-Nicely can see that the subject of his leaving the farm is
very distasteful to her in every respect, and the chances are he will feel
quite flattered by her concern for him if he does not happen to go into the
house again a little later this same afternoon, and find her cleaning a
double-barrelled shotgun.</p>

<p>She says she is thinking of going rabbit hunting, and wishes him to keep her
company, saying it may take his mind off the idea of a visit to town; but she
goes out of the room for a minute, and Nicely-Nicely picks up one of the
shotgun shells she lays out on a table, and notices that it is loaded with
buckshot.</p>

<p>So he tells her he guesses he will not go, as he is not feeling so good, and
in fact he is not feeling so good, at that, because it seems that Nicely-Nicely
is a rabbit hunter from infancy, and he never before hears of anyone hunting
these creatures with buckshot. Then the Widow Crumb says all right, she will
postpone her hunting until he feels better, but Nicely-Nicely cannot help
noticing that she loads the shotgun and stands it in a corner where it is good
and handy.</p>

<p>Well, Nicely-Nicely now sits down and gives this general situation some
serious consideration, because he is now convinced that the Widow Crumb is
unworthy of his companionship as a husband. In fact, Nicely-Nicely makes up his
mind to take steps at his earliest convenience to sue her for divorce on the
grounds of incompatibility, but in the meantime he has to think up a means of
getting away from her, and while he is thinking of this phase of the problem,
she calls him to supper.</p>

<p>It is now coming on dark, and she has the lamps lit and the table set when
Nicely-Nicely goes into the dining-room, and a fire is going in the base
burner, and usually this is a pleasant and comforting scene to Nicely-Nicely,
but to-night he does not seem to find it as attractive as usual.</p>

<p>As he sits down at the table he notices that Harley is not present at the
moment, though his place at the table is laid, and as a rule Harley is
Johnny-at-the-rat-hole when it comes time to scoff, and moreover he is a pretty
good doer at that. The fourth place that nobody ever occupies is also laid as
usual, and now that he knows who this place is for, Nicely-Nicely notes that it
is more neatly laid than his own, and that none of the china at this place is
chipped, and that the bread and butter, and the salt and pepper, and the
vinegar cruet and the bottle of Worcestershire sauce are handier to it than to
any other place, and naturally his feelings are deeply wounded.</p>

<p>Then the Widow Crumb comes out of the kitchen with two plates loaded with
spare-ribs and sauerkraut, and she puts one plate in front of Nicely-Nicely,
and the other at Jake's place, and she says to Nicely-Nicely like this:</p>

<p>'Nicely,' she says, 'Harley is working late down at the barn, and when you
get through with your supper, you can go down and call him. But,' she says, 'go
ahead and eat first.'</p>

<p>Then she returns to the kitchen, which is right next to the dining-room with
a swinging door in between, and Nicely-Nicely now observes that the very
choicest spare-ribs are on Jake's plate, and also the most kraut, and this is
really more than Nicely-Nicely can bear, for if there is one thing he adores it
is spare-ribs, so he gets to feeling very moody to be sure about this
discrimination, and he turns to Jake's place, and in a very sarcastic tone of
voice he speaks out loud as follows:</p>

<p>'Well,' he says, 'it is pretty soft for you, you big lob, living on the fat
of the land around here.'</p>

<p>Now of course what Nicely-Nicely is speaking is what he is thinking, and he
does not realize that he is speaking out loud until the Widow Crumb pops into
the dining-room carrying a bowl of salad, and looking all around and about.</p>

<p>'Nicely,' she says, 'do I hear you talking to someone?'</p>

<p>Well, at first Nicely-Nicely is about to deny it, but then he takes another
look at the choice spare-ribs on Jake's plate, and he figures that he may as
well let her know that he is on to her playing Jake for a favourite over him,
and maybe cure her of it, for by this time Nicely-Nicely is so vexed about the
spare-ribs that he almost forgets about leaving the farm, and is thinking of
his future meals, so he says to the Widow Crumb like this:</p>

<p>'Why, sure,' he says. 'I am talking to Jake.'</p>

<p>'Jake?' she says. 'What Jake?'</p>

<p>And with this she starts looking all around and about again, and
Nicely-Nicely can see that she is very pale, and that her hands are shaking so
that she can scarcely hold the bowl of salad, and there is no doubt but what
she is agitated no little, and quite some.</p>

<p>'What Jake?' the Widow Crumb says again.</p>

<p>Nicely-Nicely points to the empty chair, and says:</p>

<p>'Why, Jake here,' he says. 'You know Jake. Nice fellow, Jake.'</p>

<p>Then Nicely-Nicely goes on talking to the empty chair as follows:</p>

<p>'I notice you are not eating much to-night, Jake,' Nicely-Nicely says. 'What
is the matter, Jake? The food cannot disagree with you, because it is all
picked out and cooked to suit you, Jake. The best is none too good for you
around here, Jake,' he says.</p>

<p>Then he lets on that he is listening to something Jake is saying in reply,
and Nicely-Nicely says is that so, and I am surprised, and what do you think of
that, and tut-tut, and my-my, just as if Jake is talking a blue streak to him,
although, of course, Jake is by no means present.</p>

<p>Now Nicely-Nicely is really only being sarcastic in this conversation for
the Widow Crumb's benefit, and naturally he does not figure that she will take
it seriously, because he knows she can see Jake is not there, but Nicely-Nicely
happens to look at her while he is talking, and he observes that she is still
standing with the bowl of salad in her hands, and looking at the empty chair
with a most unusual expression on her face, and in fact, it is such an unusual
expression that it makes Nicely-Nicely feel somewhat uneasy, and he readies
himself up to dodge the salad bowl at any minute.</p>

<p>He commences to remember the loaded shotgun in the corner, and what Harley
gives him to understand about the Widow Crumb's attitude towards Jake, and
Nicely-Nicely is sorry he ever brings Jake's name up, but it seems that
Nicely-Nicely now finds that he cannot stop talking to save his life with the
Widow Crumb standing there with the unusual expression on her face, and then he
remembers the books she reads in her bed at night, and he goes on as
follows:</p>

<p>'Maybe the pains in your stomach are just indigestion, Jake,' he says. 'I
have stomach trouble in my youth myself. You are suffering terribly, eh, Jake?
Well, maybe a little of the old bicarb will help you, Jake. Oh,' Nicely-Nicely
says, 'there he goes.'</p>

<p>And with this he jumps up and runs to Jake's chair and lets on that he is
helping a character up from the floor, and as he stoops over and pretends to be
lifting this character, Nicely-Nicely grunts no little, as if the character is
very heavy, and the grunts are really on the level with Nicely-Nicely as he is
now full of spare-ribs, because he never really stops eating while he is
talking, and stooping is not easy for him.</p>

<p>At these actions the Widow Crumb lets out a scream and drops the bowl of
salad on the floor.</p>

<p>'I will help you to bed, Jake,' he says. 'Poor Jake. I know your stomach
hurts, Jake. There now, Jake,' he says, 'take it easy. I know you are suffering
horribly, but I will get something for you to ease the pain. Maybe it is the
sauerkraut,' Nicely-Nicely says.</p>

<p>Then when he seems to get Jake up on his legs, Nicely-Nicely pretends to be
assisting him across the floor towards the bedroom and all the time he is
talking in a comforting tone to Jake, although you must always remember that
there really is no Jake.</p>

<p>Now, all of a sudden, Nicely-Nicely hears the Widow Crumb's voice, and it is
nothing but a hoarse whisper that sounds very strange in the room, as she says
like this:</p>

<p>'Yes,' she says, 'it is Jake. I see him. I see him as plain as day.'</p>

<p>Well, at this Nicely-Nicely is personally somewhat startled, and he starts
looking around and about himself, and it is a good thing for Jake that
Nicely-Nicely is not really assisting Jake or Jake will find himself dropped on
the floor, as the Widow Crumb says:</p>

<p>'Oh, Jake,' she says, 'I am so sorry. I am sorry for you in your suffering.
I am sorry you ever leave me. I am sorry for everything. Please forgive me,
Jake,' she says. 'I love you.'</p>

<p>Then the Widow Crumb screams again and runs through the swinging door into
the kitchen and out the kitchen door and down the path that leads to the barn
about two hundred yards away, and it is plain to be seen that she is very
nervous. In fact, the last Nicely-Nicely sees of her before she disappears in
the darkness down the path, she is throwing her hands up in the air, and
letting out little screams, as follows: eee-eee-eee, and calling out old
Harley's name.</p>

<p>Then Nicely-Nicely hears one extra loud scream, and after this there is much
silence, and he figures that now is the time for him to take his departure, and
he starts down the same path towards the barn, but figuring to cut off across
the fields to the road that leads to the town when he observes a spark of light
bobbing up and down on the path ahead of him, and presently he comes upon old
Harley with a lantern in his hand.</p>

<p>Harley is down on his knees at what seems to be a big, round hole in the
ground, and this hole is so wide it extends clear across the path, and Harley
is poking his lantern down the hole, and when he sees Nicely-Nicely, he
says:</p>

<p>'Oh,' he says, 'there you are. I guess there is some mistake here,' he says.
'The Widow Crumb tells me to wait in the barn until after supper and she will
send you out after me, and,' Harley says, 'she also tells me to be sure and
remove the cover of this old well as soon as it comes on dark. And,' Harley
says, 'of course, I am expecting to find you in the well at this time, but who
is in there but the Widow Crumb. I hear her screech as she drops in. I judge
she must be hastening along the path and forgets about telling me to remove the
cover of the well,' Harley says. 'It is most confusing,' he says.</p>

<p>Then he pokes his lantern down the well again, and leans over and shouts as
follows:</p>

<p>'Hello, down there,' Harley shouts. 'Hello, hello, hello.'</p>

<p>But all that happens is an echo comes out of the well like this: Hello. And
Nicely-Nicely observes that there is nothing to be seen down the well, but a
great blackness.</p>

<p>'It is very deep, and dark, and cold down there,' Harley says. 'Deep, and
dark, and cold, and half full of water. Oh, my poor baby,' he says.</p>

<p>Then Harley busts out crying as if his heart will break, and in fact he is
so shaken by his sobs that he almost drops the lantern down the well.</p>

<p>Naturally Nicely-Nicely is somewhat surprised to observe these tears because
personally he is by no means greatly distressed by the Widow Crumb being down
the well, especially when he thinks of how she tries to put him down the well
first, and finally he asks Harley why he is so downcast, and Harley speaks as
follows:</p>

<p>'I love her,' Harley says. 'I love her very, very, very much. I am her
Number One husband, and while she divorces me thirty years ago when it comes
out that I have a weak heart, and the insurance companies refuse to give me a
policy, I love her just the same. And now,' Harley says, 'here she is down a
well.'</p>

<p>And with this he begins hollering into the hole some more, but the Widow
Crumb never personally answers a human voice in this life again and when the
story comes out, many citizens claim this is a right good thing, to be
sure.</p>

<p>So Nicely-Nicely returns to Broadway, and he brings with him the sum of
eleven hundred dollars, which is what he has left of the estate of his late
ever-loving wife from the sale of the farm, and one thing and another, after
generously declaring old Harley in for fifty per cent of his bit when Harley
states that the only ambition he has left in life is to rear a tombstone to the
memory of the Widow Crumb, and Nicely-Nicely announces that he is through with
betting on horses, and other frivolity, and will devote his money to providing
himself with food and shelter, and maybe a few clothes.</p>

<p>Well, the chances are Nicely-Nicely will keep his vow, too, but what happens
the second day of his return, but he observes in the entries for the third race
at Jamaica a horse by the name of Apparition, at 10 to 1 in the morning line,
and Nicely-Nicely considers this entry practically a message to him, so he goes
for his entire bundle on Apparition.</p>

<p>And it is agreed by one and all along Broadway who knows Nicely-Nicely's
story that nobody in his right mind can possibly ignore such a powerful hunch
as this, even though it loses, and Nicely-Nicely is again around doing the best
he can.</p>

<h3><a name="The_Brakemans_Daughter" id="The_Brakemans_Daughter">The Brakeman's Daughter</a></h3>
<p>It is coming on spring in Newark, New Jersey, and one nice afternoon I am
standing on Broad Street with a guy from Cleveland, Ohio, by the name of The
Humming Bird, speaking of this and that, and one thing and another, when along
comes a very tasty-looking young doll.</p>

<p>In fact, she is a doll with black hair, and personally I claim there is
nothing more restful to the eye than a doll with black hair, because it is even
money, or anyway 9 to 10, that it is the natural colour of the hair, as it
seems that dolls will change the colour of their hair to any colour but black,
and why this is nobody knows, except that it is just the way dolls are.</p>

<p>Well, besides black hair, this doll has a complexion like I do not know
what, and little feet and ankles, and a way of walking that is very pleasant to
behold. Personally, I always take a gander at a doll's feet and ankles before I
start handicapping her, because the way I look at it, the feet and ankles are
the big tell in the matter of class, although I wish to state that I see some
dolls in my time who have large feet and big ankles, but who are by no means
bad.</p>

<p>But this doll I am speaking of is 100 per cent in every respect, and as she
passes, The Humming Bird looks at her, and she looks at The Humming Bird, and
it is just the same as if they hold a two hours' conversation on the telephone,
for they are both young, and it is spring, and the way language can pass
between young guys and young dolls in the spring without them saying a word is
really most surprising, and, in fact, it is practically uncanny.</p>

<p>Well, I can see that The Humming Bird is somewhat confused for a minute,
while the young doll seems to go right off into a trance, and she starts
crossing the street against the lights, which is not only unlawful in Newark,
New Jersey, but most indiscreet, and she is about to be run down and mashed
like a turnip by one of Big False Face's beer trucks when The Humming Bird hops
out into the street and yanks her out of danger, while the jockey looking back
and yelling words you will scarcely believe are known to anybody in Newark, New
Jersey.</p>

<p>Then The Humming Bird and the young doll stand on the sidewalk chewing the
fat for a minute or two, and it is plain to be seen that the doll is very much
obliged to The Humming Bird, and it is also plain to be seen that The Humming
Bird will give anyway four bobs to have the jockey of the beer truck where he
can talk to him quietly.</p>

<p>Finally the doll goes on across the street, but this time she keeps her head
up and watches where she is going, and The Humming Bird comes back to me, and I
ask him if he finds out who she is, and does he date her up, or what? But in
answer to my questions, The Humming Bird states to me as follows:</p>

<p>'To tell the truth,' The Humming Bird says, 'I neglect these details,
because,' he says, 'I am already dated up to go out with Big False Face
to-night to call on a doll who is daffy to meet me. Otherwise,' he says, 'I
will undoubtedly make arrangements to see more of this pancake I just save from
rack and ruin.</p>

<p>'But,' The Humming Bird says, 'Big Falsy tells me I am going to meet the
most wonderful doll in the world, and one that is very difficult to meet, so I
cannot be picking up any excess at this time. In fact,' he says, 'Big Falsy
tells me that every guy in this town will give his right leg for the privilege
of meeting the doll in question, but she will have no part of them. But it
seems that she sees me talking to Big Falsy on the street yesterday, and now
nothing will do but she must meet up with me personally. Is it not remarkable,'
The Humming Bird says, 'the way dolls go for me?'</p>

<p>Well, I say it is, for I can see that The Humming Bird is such a guy as
thinks he has something on the dolls, and for all I know maybe he has, at that,
for he has plenty of youth, and good looks, and good clothes, and a nice line
of gab, and all these matters are given serious consideration by the dolls,
especially the youth.</p>

<p>But I cannot figure any doll that Big False Face knows being such a doll as
the one The Humming Bird just yanks out the way of the beer truck, and in fact
I do not see how any doll whatever can have any truck with a guy as ugly as Big
False Face. But then of course Big False Face is now an important guy in the
business world, and has plenty of potatoes, and of course potatoes are also
something that is taken into consideration by the dolls.</p>

<p>Big False Face is in the brewery business, and he controls a number of
breweries in different spots on the Atlantic seaboard, and especially in New
Jersey, and the reason The Humming Bird is in Newark, New Jersey, at this time,
is because Big False Face gets a very huge idea in connection with these
breweries.</p>

<p>It seems that they are breweries that Big False Face takes over during the
past ten years when the country is trying to get along without beer, and the
plants are laying idle, and Big False Face opens up these plants and puts many
guys to work, and turns out plenty of beer, and thus becomes quite a
philanthropist in his way, especially to citizens who like their beer, although
up to the time he gets going good as a brewer, Big False Face is considered a
very humble character, indeed.</p>

<p>He comes from the lower East Side of New York, and he is called Big False
Face from the time he is very young, because he has a very large and a very
homely kisser, and on this kisser there is always a castor-oil smile that looks
as if it is painted on. But this smile is strictly a throw-off, and Big False
Face is often smiling when he is by no means amused at anything, though I must
say for him that he is generally a very light-hearted guy.</p>

<p>In his early youth, it is Big False Face's custom to stand chatting with
strangers to the city around the railroad stations and ferryboat landings, and
smiling very genially at them, and in this way Big False Face learns much about
other parts of the country. But it seems that while he is chatting with these
strangers, friends of Big False Face search the strangers' pockets, sometimes
removing articles from these pockets such as watches, and lucky pieces, and
keepsakes of one kind and another, including money.</p>

<p>Of course it is all in fun, but it seems that some of the strangers become
greatly annoyed when they find their pockets empty, and go out of their way to
mention the matter to the gendarmes. Well, after the gendarmes hear some little
mention from strangers about their pockets being searched while they are
chatting with a guy with a large, smiling kisser, the gendarmes take to looking
around for such a guy.</p>

<p>Naturally, they finally come upon Big False Face, for at the time I am
speaking of, it is by no means common to find guys with smiles on their kissers
on the lower East Side, and, especially, large smiles. So what happens but Big
False Face is sent to college in his youth by the gendarmes, and the place
where the college is located is Auburn, New York, where they teach him that it
is very, very wrong to smile at strangers while their pockets are being
searched.</p>

<p>After Big False Face is in college for several years, the warden sends for
him one day and gives him a new suit of clothes, and a railroad ticket, and a
few bobs, and plenty of sound advice, and tells him to go back home again, and
afterward Big False Face says he is only sorry he can never remember the
advice, as he has no doubt it will be of great value to him in his subsequent
career.</p>

<p>Well, later on, Big False Face takes a post-graduate course at Ossining, and
also at Dannemora, and by the time he is through with all this, he finds that
conditions change throughout the country, and that his former occupation is
old-fashioned, and by no means genteel, so Big False Face has to think up
something else to do. And while he is thinking, he drives a taxicab and has his
station in front of the Pekin restaurant on Broadway, which is a real hot spot
at this time.</p>

<p>Then one night a sailor off U.S. battleship hires Big False Face to take him
riding in Central Park, and it seems that somewhere on this ride the sailor
loses his leather containing a month's salary, and he hops out of the taxicab
and starts complaining to a gendarme, making quite a mountain out of nothing
but a molehill, for anybody knows that if the sailor does not lose his leather
in the taxicab he is bound to spend it at ten cents a clip dancing with the
dolls in the Flowerland dance hall, or maybe taking boat rides on the lagoon in
the park.</p>

<p>Well, Big False Face can see an argument coming up, and rather than argue,
he retires from the taxicab business at once, leaving his taxicab right there
in the park, and going over into New Jersey, and Big False Face always says
that one of the regrets of his life is he never collects the taxi fare off the
sailor.</p>

<p>In New Jersey, Big False Face secures a position with the late Crowbar
Connolly, riding loads down out of Canada, and then he is with the late Hands
McGovern, and the late Dark Tony de More, and also the late Lanky-lank Watson,
and all this time Big False Face is advancing step by step in the business
world, for he has a great personality and is well liked by one and all.</p>

<p>Naturally, many citizens are jealous of Big False Face, and sometimes when
they are speaking of him they speak of the days of his youth when he is on the
whiz, as if this is something against him, but I always say it is very
creditable of Big False Face to rise from such a humble beginning to a position
of affluence in the business world.</p>

<p>Personally, I consider Big False Face a remarkable character, especially
when he takes over the idle breweries, because it is at a time when everybody
is going around saying that if they can only have beer everything will be all
right. So Big False Face starts turning out beer that tastes very good indeed,
and if everything is not all right, it is by no means his fault.</p>

<p>You must remember that at the time he starts turning out his beer, and for
years afterward, Big False Face is being most illegal and quite against the
law, and I claim that the way he is able to hide several breweries, each
covering maybe half a block of ground, from the gendarmes all these years is
practically magical, and proves that what I say about Big False Face being a
remarkable character is very true.</p>

<p>Well, when Congress finally gets around to saying that beer is all right
again, Big False Face is a well-established, going concern, and has a fair
head-start on the old-fashioned brewers who come back into the business again,
but Big False Face is smart enough to know that he will be able to keep ahead
of them only by great enterprise and industry, because it seems that certain
parties are bound and determined to make it tough on the brewers who supply
this nation with beer when beer is illegal, such as Big False Face, forgetting
all the hardships and dangers that these brewers face through the years to give
the American people their beer, and all the bother they are put to in hiding
breweries from the gendarmes.</p>

<p>In fact, these certain parties are making it so tough that Big False Face
himself has to write twice before he can get permits for his breweries, and
naturally this annoys Big False Face no little, as he hates to write
letters.</p>

<p>Furthermore, he hears this condition prevails all over the country, so Big
False Face gets to thinking things over, and he decides that the thing to do is
to organise the independent brewers like himself into an association to protect
their interests.</p>

<p>So he calls a meeting in Newark, New Jersey, of all these brewers and this
is how it comes that The Humming Bird is present, for The Humming Bird
represents certain interests around Cleveland, Ohio, and furthermore The
Humming Bird is personally regarded as a very able young guy when it comes to
breweries.</p>

<p>Well, the only reason I am in Newark, New Jersey, at this time is because a
guy by the name of Abie Schumtzenheimer is a delegate representing a New York
brewery, and this Abie is a friend of mine, and after the meeting lasts three
days he sends for me to come over and play pinochle with him because he cannot
make heads or tails of what they are all talking about.</p>

<p>And anyway Abie does not care much, because the brewery he represents is
going along for nearly twelve years, and is doing all the business it can
handle, and any time it fails to do all the business it can handle, Abie will
be around asking a lot of people why.</p>

<p>So Abie's brewery does not care if it enters any association or not, but of
course Abie cannot disregard an invitation from such a guy as Big False Face.
So there he is, and by and by there I am, and in this way I meet up with The
Humming Bird, and, after watching the way he goes darting around and about,
especially if a doll happens to pop up in his neighbourhood, I can understand
why they call him The Humming Bird.</p>

<p>But, personally, I do not mind seeing a young guy displaying an interest in
dolls, and, in fact, if a young guy does not display such an interest in dolls,
I am apt to figure there is something wrong with him. And anyway what is the
use of being young if a guy does not display an interest in dolls?</p>

<p>Well, there are delegates to the meeting from as far west as Chicago, and
most of them seem to be greatly interested in Big False Face's proposition,
especially a delegate from South Chicago who keeps trying to introduce a
resolution to sue the government for libel for speaking of brewers who supply
the nation with beer after prohibition sets in as racket guys and
wildcatters.</p>

<p>The reason the meeting lasts so long is partly because Big False Face keeps
making motions for recesses so he can do a little entertaining, for if there is
one thing Big False Face loves, it is to entertain, but another reason is that
not all the delegates are willing to join Big False Face's association,
especially certain delegates who are operating in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>These delegates say it is nothing but a scheme on the part of Big False Face
to nab the business on them, and in fact it seems that there is much resentment
among these delegates against Big False Face, and especially on the part of a
guy by the name of Cheeks Sheracki, who comes from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,
and I wish to state that if there is one guy in the United States I will not
care to have around resenting me it is Cheeks Sheracki, for nobody knows how
many guys Cheeks cools off in his time, not even himself.</p>

<p>But Big False Face does not seem to notice anybody resenting him and he is
putting on entertainment for the delegates right and left, including a nice
steak dinner on the evening of the day I am speaking of, and it is at this
dinner that I state to Big False Face that I hear he is taking The Humming Bird
out in society.</p>

<p>'Yes,' Big False Face says, 'I am going to take The Humming Bird to call on
the brakeman's daughter.'</p>

<p>Well, when I hear this, I wish to say I am somewhat surprised, because the
brakeman's daughter is nothing but a practical joke, and, furthermore, it is a
practical joke that is only for rank suckers, and The Humming Bird does not
look to be such a sucker to me.</p>

<p>In fact, when Big False Face speaks of the brakeman's daughter, I take a
gander at The Humming Bird figuring to see some expression on his kisser that
will show he knows what the brakeman's daughter is, but instead The Humming
Bird is only looking quite eager, and then I get to thinking about what he
tells me in the afternoon about Big False Face taking him to see a doll who is
daffy to meet him, and I can see that Big False Face is working on him with the
brakeman's daughter for some time.</p>

<p>And I also get to thinking that a lot of smarter guys than The Humming Bird
will ever be, no matter how smart he gets, fall for the brakeman's daughter
joke, including Big False Face himself. In fact, Big False Face falls for it in
the spring of 1928 at Hot Springs, Arkansas, and ever since it is his favourite
joke, and it becomes part of his entertainment of all visitors to Newark, New
Jersey, unless of course they happen to be visitors who are jerry to the
brakeman's daughter into quite a well-known institution in Newark, New Jersey,
and the way the brakeman's daughter joke goes is as follows:</p>

<p>The idea is Big False Face picks out some guy that he figures is a little
doll-dizzy, and the way Big False Face can rap to a doll-dizzy guy is really
quite remarkable.</p>

<p>Then he starts telling this guy about the brakeman's daughter, who is the
most beautiful doll that ever steps in shoe leather, to hear Big False Face
tell it. In fact, I once hear Big False Face telling a sucker about how
beautiful the brakeman's daughter is, and I find myself wishing to see her,
although of course I know there is no such thing as the brakeman's
daughter.</p>

<p>Furthermore, everybody around Big False Face starts putting in a boost for
the brakeman's daughter, stating to the sucker that she is so lovely that guys
are apt to go silly just looking at her. But it seems that the brakeman's
daughter has a papa who is a brakeman on the Central, and who is the orneriest
guy in the world when it comes to his daughter, and who will not let anybody
get close enough to her to hand her a slice of fruit cake.</p>

<p>In fact, this brakeman is so ornery he will shoot you setting if he catches
you fooling around his daughter, the way Big False Face and other citizens of
Newark, New Jersey, state the situation to the sucker, and everybody is afraid
of the brakeman, including guys who are not supposed to be afraid of anything
in this world.</p>

<p>But it seems that Big False Face is acquainted with the brakeman's daughter,
and knows the nights the brakeman has to be out on his run, and on these nights
the brakeman's daughter is home alone, and on such a night Big False Face
occasionally calls on her, and sometimes takes a friend. But Big False Face and
everybody else says that it is a dangerous proposition, because if the brakeman
ever happens to come home unexpectedly and find callers with his daughter, he
is pretty sure to hurt somebody.</p>

<p>Well, the chances are the sucker wishes to call on the brakeman's daughter,
no matter what, especially as Big False Face generally lets on that the
brakeman's daughter sees the sucker somewhere and is very anxious to meet him,
just as he lets on to The Humming Bird, so finally some night Big Falsy takes
the sucker to the house where the brakeman's daughter lives, making their
approach to the house very roundabout, and mysterious, and sneaky.</p>

<p>Then the minute Big Falsy knocks on the door, out pops a guy from somewhere
roaring at them in a large voice, and Big False Face yells that it is the
brakeman's daughter's papa himself, and starts running, telling the sucker to
follow, although as a rule this is by no means necessary. And when the sucker
starts running, he commences to hear shots, and naturally he figures that the
old brakeman is popping at him with a Betsy, but what he really hears is
incandescent light bulbs going off around him and sometimes they hit him if the
bulb-thrower has good control.</p>

<p>Now, the house Big False Face generally uses is an old empty residence
pretty well out in a suburb of Newark, New Jersey, and it sits away off by
itself in a big yard near a piece of woods, and when he starts running, Big
False Face always runs into this woods, and naturally the sucker follows him.
And pretty soon Big False Face loses the sucker in the woods, and doubles back
and goes on downtown and leaves the sucker wandering around in the woods for
maybe hours.</p>

<p>Then when the sucker finally makes his way back to his hotel, he always
finds many citizens gathered to give him the ha-ha, and to make him buy
refreshments for one and all, and the sucker tries to make out that he is
greatly amused himself, although the chances are he is so hot you can fry an
egg on any part of him.</p>

<p>The biggest laugh that Big False Face ever gets out of the brakeman's
daughter joke is the time he leaves a guy from Brooklyn by the name of Rocco
Scarpati in the woods one cold winter night, and Rocco never does find his way
out, and freezes as stiff as a starched shirt. And of course Big False Face has
quite a time explaining to Rocco's Brooklyn friends that Rocco is not cooled
off by other means than freezing.</p>

<p>Well, now the way I tell it, you say to yourself how can anybody be sucker
enough to fall for such a plant as this? But Big False Face's record with the
brakeman's daughter joke in Newark, New Jersey, includes a congressman, a
justice of the peace, three G-guys, eighteen newspaper scribes, five prize
fighters, and a raft of guys from different parts of the country, who are such
guys as the ordinary citizen will hesitate about making merry with.</p>

<p>In fact, I hear Big False Face is putting the feel on Cheeks Sheracki with
reference to the brakeman's daughter until he finds out Cheeks knows this joke
as well as he does himself, and then Big False Face discovers The Humming Bird,
and no one is talking stronger for the brakeman's daughter with The Humming
Bird than Cheeks.</p>

<p>Well, anyway, along about nine o'clock on the night in question, Big False
Face tells The Humming Bird that the brakeman is now well out on his run on the
Central so they get in Big False Face's car and start out, and I notice that,
as they get in the car, Big False Face gives The Humming Bird a quick fanning,
as Big False Face does not care to take chances on a sucker having that certain
business on him.</p>

<p>The Humming Bird is all sharpened up for this occasion, and furthermore he
is quite excited, and one and all are telling him what a lucky guy he is to get
to call on the brakeman's daughter, but anybody can see from the way The
Humming Bird acts that he feels that it is really the brakeman's daughter who
is having the luck.</p>

<p>It seems that Cheeks Sheracki and a couple of his guys from Philadelphia go
out to the house in advance to heave the incandescent bulbs and do the yelling,
and personally I sit up playing pinochle with Abie Schumtzenheimer waiting to
hear what comes off, although Abie says it is all great foolishness, and by no
means worthy of grown guys. But Abie admits he will be glad to see the
brakeman's daughter himself, if she is as beautiful as Big False Face
claims.</p>

<p>Well, when they come within a couple of blocks of the empty house in the
suburbs of Newark, New Jersey, Big False Face tells his driver, a guy by the
name of Ears Acosta, who afterwards informs me on several points in this
transaction, to pull up and wait there, and then Big False Face and The Humming
Bird get out of the car and Big False Face leads the way up the street and into
the yard.</p>

<p>This yard is filled with big trees and shrubbery, but the moon is shining
somewhat, and it is easy enough to make out objects around and about, but there
are no lights in the house, and it is so quiet you can hear your watch tick in
your pocket, if you happen to have a watch.</p>

<p>Well, Big False Face has The Humming Bird by the coat sleeve, and he tiptoes
through the gate and up a pathway, and The Humming Bird tiptoes right with him,
and every now and then Big False Face stops and listens, and the way Big False
Face puts this on is really wonderful, because he does it so often he can get a
little soul into his work.</p>

<p>Now, The Humming Bird has plenty of moxie from all I hear, but naturally
seeing the way Big False Face is acting makes him feel a little nervous,
because The Humming Bird knows that Big False Face is as game as they come, and
he figures that any situation that makes Big False Face act as careful as all
this must be a very dangerous situation, indeed.</p>

<p>When they finally get up close to the house, The Humming Bird sees there is
a porch, and Big False Face tiptoes up on this porch, still leading The Humming
Bird by the coat sleeve, and then Big False Face knocks softly on the door, and
lets out a little low whistle, and, just as The Humming Bird is commencing to
notice that this place seems to be somewhat deserted, all of a sudden a guy
comes busting around the corner of the house.</p>

<p>This guy is making a terrible racket, what with yelling and swearing, and
among other things he yells as follows:</p>

<p>'Ah-ha!' the guy yells, 'now I have you dead to rights!'</p>

<p>And with this, something goes pop, and then something goes pop-pop, and Big
False Face says to The Humming Bird like this: 'My goodness,' Big False Face
says, 'it is the brakeman! Run!' he says. 'Run for your life!'</p>

<p>Then Big False Face turns and runs, and The Humming Bird is about to turn
and run with him because The Humming Bird figures if a guy like Big False Face
can afford to run there can be no percentage in standing still himself, but
before he can move the door of the house flies open and The Humming Bird feels
himself being yanked inside the joint, and he puts up his dukes and gets ready
to do the best he can until he is overpowered. Then he hears a doll's voice
going like this:</p>

<p>'Sh-h-h-h!' the doll's voice goes. 'Sh-h-h-h!'</p>

<p>So The Humming Bird sh-h-h-h's, and the racket goes on outside a while with
a guy still yelling, and much pop-pop-popping away. Then the noise dies out,
and all is still, and by the moonlight that is coming through a window on which
there is no curtain, The Humming Bird can see a lot of furniture scattered
around and about the room, but some of it is upside-down and none of it is
arranged in any order.</p>

<p>Furthermore, The Humming Bird can now also see that the doll who pulls him
into the house and gives him the sh-h-h-h is nobody but the black-haired doll
he hauls out of the way of the beer truck in the afternoon, and naturally The
Humming Bird is somewhat surprised to see her at this time.</p>

<p>Well, the black-haired doll smiles at The Humming Bird and finally he
forgets his nervousness to some extent, and in fact drops his dukes which he
still has up ready to sell his life dearly, and by and by the black-haired doll
says to him like this:</p>

<p>'I recognize you through the window in the moonlight,' she says. 'As I see
you coming up on the porch, I also see some parties lurking in the shrubbery,
and,' she says, 'I have a feeling they are seeking to do you harm, so I pull
you inside the house. I am glad to see you again,' she says.</p>

<p>Well, Big False Face does not show up in his accustomed haunts to laugh at
the joke on The Humming Bird, but Ears Acosta returns with disquieting news
such as causes many citizens to go looking for Big False Face, and they find
him face downward on the path just inside the gateway, and when they turn him
over the old castor-oil smile is still on his kisser, and even larger than
ever, as if Big False Face is greatly amused by some thought that hits him all
of a sudden.</p>

<p>And Big False Face is extremely dead when they find him, as it seems that
some of the incandescent bulbs that go pop-popping around him are really
sawed-off shotguns, and it also seems that Cheeks Sheracki and his guys from
Philadelphia are such careless shots that they tear off half the gate with
their slugs, so it is pretty lucky for The Humming Bird that he is not running
with Big False Face for this gate at the moment, or in fact anywhere near
him.</p>

<p>And back in the house, while they are lugging Big False Face away, The
Humming Bird and the black-haired doll are sitting on an overturned sofa in the
parlour with the moonlight streaming through the window on which there is no
curtain and spilling all over them as The Humming Bird is telling her how much
he loves her, and how he hopes and trusts she feels the same towards him, for
they are young, and it is spring in Newark, New Jersey.</p>

<p>'Well,' The Humming Bird says, 'so you are the brakeman's daughter, are you?
Well,' he says, 'I wish to state that they do not overboost you a nickel's
worth when they tell me you are the most beautiful doll in all this world, and
I am certainly tickled to find you.'</p>

<p>'But how do you learn my new address so soon?' the black-haired doll says.
'We just move in here this morning, although,' she says, 'I guess it is a good
thing for you we do not have time to put up any window shades. And what do you
mean,' the black-haired doll says, 'by calling me the brakeman's daughter? My
papa is one of the oldest and best known conductors anywhere on the Erie,' she
says.</p>

<h3><a name="Cemetery_Bait" id="Cemetery_Bait">Cemetery Bait</a></h3>
<p>One pleasant morning in early April, a character by the name of Gentleman
George wakes up to find himself in a most embarrassing predicament.</p>

<p>He wakes up to find himself in a cell in the state penitentiary at Trenton,
N.J., and while a cell in a state penitentiary is by no means a novelty to
George, and ordinarily will cause him no confusion whatever, the trouble is
this particular cell is what is known as the death house.</p>

<p>Naturally, George is very self-conscious about this, as it is only the
second time in his life he ever finds himself in such a house, and the first
time is so far back in his youth that it leaves scarcely any impression on him,
especially as he is commuted out of it in less than sixty days.</p>

<p>Well, George sits there on the side of the cot in his cell this pleasant
April morning, thinking what a humiliating circumstance this is to a proud
nature such as his, when all of a sudden he remembers that on the morrow he is
to be placed in Mister Edison's rocking-chair in the room adjoining his cell,
and given a very severe shock in the seat of his breeches.</p>

<p>On remembering this George becomes very thoughtful to be sure, and sighs to
himself as follows: Heigh-ho, heigh-ho, heigh-ho. And then he sends for me to
come and see him, although George is well aware that I have no use for
penitentiaries, or their environs, and consider them a most revolting
spectacle.</p>

<p>In fact, I have such a repugnance for penitentiaries that I never even
glance at them in passing, because I am afraid that peepings may be catchings,
but of course in a situation such as this I can scarcely deny the call of an
old friend.</p>

<p>They let me talk to George through the bars of his cell, and naturally I am
somewhat perturbed to observe him in this plight, although I can see that his
surroundings are clean and sanitary, and that the hacks seem kindly disposed
towards him, except one big doorknob who is inclined to be somewhat churlish
because George just beats him in a game of two-handed pinochle.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I can see that George is in pretty fair physical condition,
although a little stouter than somewhat, and that he looks as if he is getting
some rest.</p>

<p>He is at this time about forty-five years of age, is known far and wide as
the handsomest and most genteel character on Broadway. His brown hair now has
some grey in it along the edges, and there are lines of care in his face, and,
of course, George is not dressed as fashionably as usual.</p>

<p>In fact, his clothes need pressing, and he can stand a haircut, and a shave,
and when I mention this to George he says he understands they are going to give
him all the haircutting he requires before morning, and maybe a close shave,
too.</p>

<p>In the old days, Gentleman George is very prominent in the jewellery trade
with Tommy Entrata and his associates, and anybody will tell you that Tommy and
his crowd are the best in the country, because they pursue strictly business
methods, and are very high-principled.</p>

<p>They generally work with a character by the name of Lou Adolia, who is a
private fuzz often employed by big insurance companies that make a speciality
of insuring jewellery for wealthy female parties, a fuzz being a way of saying
a detective, although the chances are Lou Adolia cannot really find his hip
pocket with both hands.</p>

<p>But when Tommy Entrata and his associates come into possession of jewellery
belonging to these wealthy female parties, they notify Lou Adolia, and he
arranges with the insurance companies to pay a certain sum for the return of
the merchandise, and no beefs, and everybody is satisfied, especially the
insurance companies, because, of course, if they do not get the goods back, the
companies will have to pay the full amount of the insurance.</p>

<p>As Tommy Entrata is generally very reasonable in his fees on jewellery that
comes into his possession, it really is a most economical arrangement for the
insurance companies, and for everybody else concerned, and it is also very nice
for Lou Adolia, as he always gets a reward from the companies, and sometimes a
piece of what Tommy Entrata collects.</p>

<p>Then a piece always goes to the stout fellow in the city in which Tommy
Entrata and his associates are operating, the stout fellow being the local fix,
because, of course, you understand that in a business as large as this carried
on by Tommy Entrata it is necessary to take care of all angles. So the stout
fellow looks after the local law to see that it does not interfere with Tommy
Entrata any more than is absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>To tell the truth, when Tommy Entrata and his associates go into a town, it
is generally as well-organised from top to bottom as Standard Oil, and Tommy
not only has a complete roster of all the local jewellery owners, and what they
are insured for, from Lou Adolia, but also a few diagrams as to where this
jewellery is located, and Tommy never fails to make ample provision for one and
all in the town who may be concerned before he turns a wheel. In fact, I hear
that in a spot up in the North-west Tommy once even declares the mayor and the
commissioner of public safety in on one of his transactions, just out of the
goodness of his heart, and this unselfishness in his business operations makes
Tommy highly respected far and wide.</p>

<p>Anyway, Gentleman George is one of Tommy Entrata's experts in the matter of
coming into possession of jewellery, and Tommy appreciates George no little, as
George is strictly a lone hand at his work, and he never carries that thing on
him, and considers all forms of violence most revolting, so he never gets into
trouble, or at least not much.</p>

<p>I am telling you all this so you will understand that Tommy Entrata conducts
his business in a high-class, conservative manner, and personally I consider
him a great boon to a community, because he teaches people the value of
insurance, and now I will return to Gentleman George in his cell in the death
house in Trenton, N.J.</p>

<p>'Well,' George says, 'there you are, and here I am, and you are the only
friend that comes to see me since the judge mentions the date that now becomes
of some importance in my life, and which is in fact to-morrow. And now I wish
to tell you a story, which will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but
the truth, and the object of this story is to show that I once perform a great
service to the public.'</p>

<p>At this, I become uneasy, because I am afraid it may be a tedious story, and
I do not care to remain in such surroundings listening to reminiscence, so I
request George to epitomise as much as possible, and to omit all reference to
low characters and sordid situations, and then George states as follows, and to
wit, viz.:</p>

<p>In the winter of 1935, I am going southward by train on business bent, and
the reason I do not reveal my destination at this time is because I do not wish
to be recalled as ever hollering copper, even on a city, but I will say that it
is a certain winter resort spot about as far below the Mason &amp; Dixon's line
as you can get before you start swimming, and a very pleasant spot it is, at
that.</p>

<p>The first night out on the train, I go into the diner and partake of a fish
that is on the menu, because the steward of the diner weighs in with a strong
shill for this fish, and the next thing I know I am back in my compartment as
sick as anything, and maybe a little bit sicker.</p>

<p>To tell the truth, I am so sick that I think I am going to pass away, and
this thought disturbs me no little, as Tommy Entrata is looking forward to my
arrival with keen interest, and I know that he is apt to take my passing away
as a personal affront.</p>

<p>Well, while I am lying in my bench as sick as stated, all of a sudden the
door of my compartment opens, and a pair of specs and a short, scrubby, grey
tash appear, and behind the specs and the tash is a stern-looking character of
maybe fifty-odd who speaks to me in a gruff voice, as follows:</p>

<p>'See here, now,' he says, 'what is all this runting and grunting about? Are
you sick?'</p>

<p>'Well,' I say, 'if I am not sick, I will do until an invalid comes
along.'</p>

<p>And then I start retching again, and in between retches, I mention the
dining-car fish, and I tell the stern-looking character that if he will kindly
get the dining-car steward to step into my compartment for just one minute I
will die happy.</p>

<p>'You speak great nonsense,' the stern-looking character says. 'You are not
going to die, although,' he says, 'who knows but what you may be better off if
you do? Not enough people know when to die. What ails you is ptomaine
poisoning, and I will take charge of this situation myself because I will be
unable to sleep in this car with you scrooning and mooning all night.</p>

<p>'I once get the same thing myself in Gloucester, Mass.' he says. 'You will
expect fish to be all right in Gloucester, Mass. If I remember,' he says, 'it
is mackerel in my case.'</p>

<p>Then he rings for the porter, and pretty soon he has the train secretary,
and the Pullman conductor, and even a couple of other passengers running in and
out of my compartment getting him this, and that, and one thing and another,
and dosing me with I do not know what, and sick as I am, I can see that this
stern-looking character is accustomed to having people step around when he
speaks.</p>

<p>Well, for a while I am thinking that the best break I can get is to pass
away without any further lingering; then, by and by, I commence feeling better,
and finally I doze off to sleep. But I seem to remember the stern-looking
character mentioning that he is going to the same place that I am, and that he
is just returning from a hunting-trip in Canada, and I also seem to recall him
telling me what a wonderful shot he is with any kind of fire-arms.</p>

<p>Afterward, however, I figure I must dream all this because the next morning
the stern-looking character just glances in on me once and asks how I feel in a
tone of voice that indicates he does not care much one way or the other, and
after this I do not see hide or hair of him, and I can see that he does not
mean to make a friendship of the matter.</p>

<p>In fact, when I am getting off the train at my destination, I suddenly
remember that I do not even know the stern-looking character's name, and I am
sorry about this, as so few people in the world are ever good to me that I wish
to cherish the names of those who are. But, of course, I now have no time for
sentiment, as duty calls me, and I do not bother to inquire around and about
with reference to the stern-looking character.</p>

<p>I telephone Tommy Entrata, and make a meet with him for dinner in a
night-club that is called by the name of the Bath and Sail Club, although there
is no bathing connected with it whatever, and no sailing either, for that
matter, and while I am waiting there for Tommy, I observe at another table the
most beautiful Judy I see in many a day, and you know very well that few better
judges of beauty ever live than yours sincerely, G. George.</p>

<p>She is young, and has hair the colour of straw, and she is dressed in a
gorgeous white evening gown, and she has plenty of junk on her in the way of
diamonds, and she seems to be waiting for someone and I find myself regretting
that it is not me. I am so impressed by her that I call Emil, the head-waiter,
and question him, because Emil is an old friend of mine, and I know he always
has a fund of information on matters such as this.</p>

<p>'Emil,' I say, 'who is the lovely pancake over there by the window?'</p>

<p>'Cemetery bait,' Emil says, so I know he means she is married, and has a
husband who is selfish about her, and naturally I cast no sheep's eyes in her
direction, especially as Tommy Entrata comes in about now and takes me to a
private room where we have a nice dinner, and discuss my business in this
city.</p>

<p>It is in pursuit of this business, at the hour of 1 a.m. on a warm Sunday
morning, that I am making a call at the residence of a character by the name of
Colonel Samuel B. Venus, and am in the boudoir of his ever-loving wife, and a
beautiful room it is, at that, with the windows on one side looking out over
the sea waves, and the windows on the other side overlooking a patio of
whispering palm-trees.</p>

<p>The moon is shining down on this scene, and it is so lovely that I stand at
the front windows a few moments looking out over the water before I start
seeking the small can, or safe, that I know is concealed in a clothes closet in
the room unless the butler in the Venus house is telling a terrible falsehood
and accepting money from us under false pretences for this information and for
admitting me to the premises.</p>

<p>Of course, Colonel Samuel B. Venus's ever-loving wife is not present in her
boudoir at this hour, and neither is Colonel Samuel B. Venus, and in fact I
afterward learn that the only way Colonel Samuel B. Venus can get in there is
on a writ of habeas corpus, but this has nothing to do with my story.</p>

<p>My information is that Colonel Samuel B. Venus is a very wealthy character
of maybe sixty years of age, come next grass, and that his ever-loving wife is
less than half of that, and has some of the finest jewellery in this country,
including pearls, diamonds, star rubies, emeralds, and I do not know what all
else, and I am given to understand that Colonel Samuel B. Venus leaves the
night before on a fishing-trip, and that Mrs. Colonel Samuel B. Venus is out
somewhere wearing only a couple of pounds of her jewels, so the rest of her
stuff is bound to be in the little can in her boudoir.</p>

<p>Well, the little can is in the closet just where the butler reports, and I
observe that it is such a can as I will be able to open with a toothpick if
necessary, although, of course, I bring along my regular can-opener, which is a
tool for cutting open safes that I personally invent, as you perhaps remember,
although I never think to get a patent on it from the government, and I am
about to start operations when I hear voices, and two characters, male and
female, enter the boudoir.</p>

<p>So there I am in the closet among a lot of dresses and coats, and all this
and that, and, what is more, I leave the closet door open a little when I go
in, as I figure I may require a little air, and I am now afraid to close the
door for fear of making a noise, and the best I can make of this situation is
that I am a gone gosling. To tell the truth, it is one of the few times in my
life that I regret I do not have that thing on me, just for self-defence.</p>

<p>I can see right away from the way she talks that the female character must
be Mrs. Colonel Samuel B. Venus, but the character with her is by no means her
husband, and naturally I am greatly scandalised to think that a married broad
will bring a party not her husband into her boudoir with her at such an hour,
and I am wondering what on earth the world is coming to.</p>

<p>But although I listen keenly, there seems to be no goings-on, and in fact
all they are doing is talking, so I figure the character with Mrs. Colonel
Samuel B. Venus must be a character without any imagination whatever.</p>

<p>Finally, when I judge from their conversation that they are looking at the
view of the sad sea waves, I cop a quick peek, and I see that Mrs. Colonel
Samuel B. Venus is nobody but the blonde I admire at the Bath and Sail Club,
and while this surprises me no little, it does not surprise me half as much as
the fact that the character with her is a party by the name of Count Tomaso,
who is known far and wide as a most unworthy character. In fact, Count Tomaso
is regarded in some circles as a 22-carat fink, a fink being a character who is
lower than a mudcat's vest pocket.</p>

<p>He is a small, slim-built character, with dark hair greased down on his
head, and he wears a monocle, and seems very foreign in every respect. In fact,
Count Tomaso claims to belong to the Italian nobility, but he is no more a
count than I am, and to tell the truth, he is nothing but a ginzo out of
Sacramento, and his right name is Carfarelli.</p>

<p>For a matter of twenty years or more, this Count Tomaso is on the socket,
which is a way of saying his dodge is blackmail, and of course there is little
or no class to such a dodge as this. He generally pitches to foolish old
married Judys, and gets them wedged in with letters, and one thing and another,
and then puts the shake on them.</p>

<p>Personally, I rarely criticise anybody else's methods of earning a
livelihood, but I can never approve of the shake, although I must admit that
from what I hear of Count Tomaso, he really is an artist in his line, and can
nine those old phlugs in first-class style when he is knuckling.</p>

<p>I only hope and trust that his presence in Mrs. Colonel Samuel B. Venus's
boudoir does not mean that Count Tomaso is trespassing in any way upon my
affairs, as I can see where this will produce complications, and it is always
my policy to avoid complications, so I remain very quiet, with a firm grip on
my can-opener in case Mrs. Colonel Samuel B. Venus or Count Tomaso happens to
come to the closet.</p>

<p>But it seems to be nothing but a social visit, as I can hear her getting out
some liquor, and after a couple of drinks they begin speaking of nothing much
in particular, including the weather. Presently the conversation becomes quite
dull, for it is all about love and conversation about love always bores me no
little unless I am making the conversation myself, although I can see that Mrs.
Colonel Samuel B. Venus is better than a rare hand in conversation of this
nature.</p>

<p>I am so bored that I put down my can-opener and am about to doze off among
the dresses, when all of a sudden the conversation takes a very unusual turn,
to be sure, for Mrs. Colonel Samuel B. Venus says to Count Tomaso like
this:</p>

<p>'I know you love me,' she says, 'and I love you madly in return, but what
good will it do us? I am married to a character old enough to be my father and,
although he does not know it, I hate and despise him. But even if I tell him
this, I know he will never give me a divorce, and, besides, if I do get a
divorce, he is sure to put me off with a mere pittance. I am bound to him as
long as he lives,' she says. 'As long as he lives, Tomaso.'</p>

<p>Well, Count Tomaso says this is certainly a sad state of affairs, and seems
to be taking another drink, and she goes on as follows:</p>

<p>'Of course,' she says, 'if he passes away, Tomaso, I will marry you the next
day, or anyway' she says, 'as soon as my mourning goes out of style. Then we
can go all over the world and enjoy our love, because I know his will leaves me
all his vast fortune. I am afraid it is wicked,' she says, 'but sometimes I
wish an accident will befall him.'</p>

<p>Now I can see that what is coming off here is that Mrs. Colonel Samuel B.
Venus is giving Count Tomaso a hint in a roundabout way to cause an accident to
befall Colonel Samuel B. Venus, and thinks I to myself there in the closet, it
is a pretty how-do-you-do if such goings-on are tolerated in society circles,
and I am glad I am not in society. To tell the truth, I consider Mrs. Colonel
Samuel B. Venus's attitude most unbecoming.</p>

<p>Well, they converse at some length about various forms of accidents that
they hear of, but they seem unable to arrive at any definite conclusion, and I
am almost sorry I am unable to join in the discussion and offer a few original
ideas of my own, when Mrs. Colonel Samuel B. Venus says:</p>

<p>'Well,' she says, 'we are sailing next week on the <i>Castilla</i> for New York,
and you can come on the same ship. New York is a better place for accidents
than down here, because they are not apt to attract so much attention there.
But, Tomaso,' she says, 'be very careful the Colonel does not see you on the
trip, as he has been hearing things here, and he is terribly jealous, and has a
violent temper, and, furthermore, he always has deadly weapons around, and he
claims he is a wonderful marksman.</p>

<p>'Oh, Tomaso,' she says, 'is it not awful to be yoked to an old character who
thinks of nothing but hunting, and fishing, and business, when I love you so
much?'</p>

<p>Well, Tomaso says it is, indeed, and does she have a few dibs on her to tide
him over the week-end, and it seems she has, and then there is a little offhand
billing and cooing that I consider very bad taste in her under her own roof,
and finally they go out of the boudoir.</p>

<p>As soon as they depart, I turn to my own business of opening the little can
and removing the jewellery, which I deliver to Tommy Entrata, who gives it to
Lou Adolia, and this is the time that Lou Adolia gets eighty thousand dollars
from the insurance companies for the return of the goods, and then disappears
with all the sugar, and without as much as saying, aye, yes or no to
anybody.</p>

<p>But I am getting ahead of my story.</p>

<p>A couple of days later, I am reclining on the beach with Tommy Entrata,
taking a little sun for my complexion, when who comes along in a bathing-suit
which displays a really remarkable shape but Mrs. Colonel Samuel B. Venus, and
who is with her but the stern-looking character who doctors me up on the train,
and at first I have half a notion to jump up and say hello to him and thank him
for his kindness to me about the fish, but he looks right through me as if he
never sees me before in his life, and I can see that he does not remember me,
or if he does, he does not care to make anything of it.</p>

<p>So I do not give him a blow, because the way I look at it, the fewer people
you know in this world, the better you are off. But I ask Tommy Entrata who the
stern-looking character is, and I am somewhat surprised when Tommy says:</p>

<p>'Why,' he says, 'he is Colonel Samuel B. Venus, the party you knock off the
other night, but,' Tommy says, 'let us not speak of that now. Colonel Samuel B.
Venus is a most irascible character, and he is making quite a chirp about
matters, and it is very fortunate for us that he and his wife are sailing for
New York, because the stout fellow is getting nervous about the outcry.</p>

<p>'By the way,' Tommy says, 'I do not wish to seem inhospitable in suggesting
your departure from these pleasant scenes, but it may be a good idea for you to
take it on the Jesse Owens until the beef is chilled. There are many
nightingales in these parts,' he says, 'and they will sing to the law on very
slight provocation, for instance such a character as Count Tomaso. I notice him
around here nuzzling up to Mrs. Colonel Samuel B. Venus, and while the chances
are he is on a business mission of his own, Count Tomaso knows you, and it is
always my opinion that he is a singer, at heart.'</p>

<p>Well, I do not mention the incident in Mrs. Colonel Samuel B. Venus's
boudoir to Tommy Entrata, because in the first place I do not consider it any
of his business, and in the second place I know Tommy is not apt to be
interested in such a matter, but I get to thinking about the conversation
between Mrs. Colonel Samuel B. Venus and Count Tomaso, and I also get to
thinking about Colonel Samuel B. Venus being so nice to me in connection with
the bad fish.</p>

<p>And thinks I, as long as I must take my departure, anyway, a little sea
voyage may be beneficial to my health, and I will go on the <i>Castilla</i> myself,
and will look up Count Tomaso and admonish him that I will hold him personally
responsible if any accident happens to Colonel Samuel B. Venus, as I feel that
it is only fair to do what I can to discharge my debt of gratitude to Colonel
Samuel B. Venus concerning the fish.</p>

<p>So when the <i>Castilla</i> sails a few days later, I am a passenger, and,
furthermore, I have a nice cabin on the same deck as Colonel Samuel B. Venus
and his ever-loving wife, because I always believe in travelling with the best
people, no matter what.</p>

<p>I see Colonel Samuel B. Venus, and I also see Mrs. Colonel Samuel B. Venus
on the first day out, and I observe that Colonel Samuel B. Venus is looking
sterner than ever, and also that Mrs. Colonel Samuel B. Venus is growing
lovelier by the hour, but never do I see Count Tomaso, although I am pretty
sure he does not miss the boat.</p>

<p>I figure that he is taking Mrs. Colonel Samuel B. Venus's advice about
keeping out of sight of Colonel Samuel B. Venus.</p>

<p>I do not bother to go looking for Count Tomaso on the <i>Castilla</i> to admonish
him about Colonel Samuel B. Venus, because I figure I am bound to catch up with
him getting off the boat in New York, and that in the meantime Colonel Samuel
B. Venus is safe from accident, especially as it comes up stormy at sea after
we are a few hours out, and Colonel Samuel B. Venus and his ever-loving wife
seem to be keeping close to their cabin, and in fact so is everybody else.</p>

<p>Well, the storm keeps getting worse, and it is sleety and cold all around
and about, and the sea is running higher than somewhat, and now one night off
the Jersey coast when I am sleeping as peacefully as anything, I am awakened by
a great to-do and it seems that the <i>Castilla</i> is on fire.</p>

<p>Naturally, I do not care to be toasted in my cabin, so I don my clothes, and
pop out into the passageway and start for the nearest exit, when I remember
that in moments of confusion many characters, male and female, are apt to
forget articles of one kind and another that may come in handy to somebody
such as me later on, for instance bits of jewellery, and other portable
merchandise.</p>

<p>So I try various doors as I go along the passageway, and all of them are
open and unoccupied, as the <i>Castilla</i> is an old-time vessel with cabin doors
that lock with keys, and not with snap locks, and, just as I suspect, I find
numerous odds and ends in the way of finger-rings, and bracelets and clips and
pins and necklaces, and watches, and gold cigarette-cases, and even a few loose
bundles of ready scratch, so I am very glad, indeed, that I am gifted with
foresight.</p>

<p>Finally I come to one door that seems to be locked, and I remember that this
is the cabin occupied by Colonel Samuel B. Venus and his ever-loving wife, and
after first knocking at the door and receiving no reply, I figure they hastily
depart and carelessly lock the door after them, and I also figure that I am
bound to garner something of more than ordinary value there.</p>

<p>So I kick the door in, and who is in the cabin on a bed, all trussed up like
a goose, with a towel tied across his mouth to keep him from hollering out
loud, but Colonel Samuel B. Venus, in person.</p>

<p>Naturally, I am somewhat surprised at this spectacle, and also somewhat
embarrassed to have Colonel Samuel B. Venus find me kicking in his door, but of
course this is no time for apologies, so I take a quick swivel about the cabin
to see if there are any articles lying around that I may be able to use. I am
slightly disappointed to note that there appears to be nothing, and I am about
to take my departure, when all of a sudden I remember my debt of gratitude to
Colonel Samuel B. Venus, and I realize that it will be most unkind to leave him
in this predicament to be barbecued like a steer without being able to move
hand or foot.</p>

<p>So I out with my pocket chiv, and cut him loose, and I also remove the towel,
and as soon as he can talk, Colonel Samuel B. Venus issues a statement to me,
in a most severe tone of voice, as follows:</p>

<p>'They try to murder me,' he says. 'My own wife, Cora, and a character in a
white polo coat with a little cap to match. When the alarm of fire is sounded,'
Colonel Samuel B. Venus says, 'she starts screaming, and he comes banging up
against our door, and she unlocks it and lets him in before I have time to
think, and then he knocks me down with something, I do not know what.'</p>

<p>'The chances are,' I say, 'it is a blunt instrument.'</p>

<p>'You may be right,' Colonel Samuel B. Venus says. 'Anyway, after he knocks
me down, my own wife, Cora, picks up one of my shoes and starts belting me over
the head with the heel, and then she helps the character in the polo coat and
the little cap to match tie me up as you find me.'</p>

<p>'It is a scurvy trick,' I say.</p>

<p>'I am half unconscious,' Colonel Samuel B. Venus says, 'but I remember
hearing my own wife, Cora, remark that the fire is a wonderful break for them,
and will save them a lot of bother in New York. And then before they leave, she
hits me another belt on the head with the shoe. I fear,' Colonel Samuel B.
Venus says, 'that my own wife, Cora, is by no means the ever-loving helpmeet I
think. In fact,' he says, 'I am now wondering about the overdose of sleeping
powders she gives me in London, England, in 1931, and about the bomb in my
automobile in Los Angeles, Cal., in 1933.'</p>

<p>'Well, well, well,' I say, 'let us let bygones be bygones, and get off this
tub, as it seems to be getting hotter than a ninth-inning finish around
here.'</p>

<p>But Colonel Samuel B. Venus remains very testy about the incident he just
describes, and he fumbles around under a pillow on the bed on which I find him,
and outs with that thing, and opens the cylinder as if to make sure it is
loaded, and says to me like this:</p>

<p>'I will shoot him down like a dog,' he says. 'I mean the character in the
white polo coat and the little cap to match. He undoubtedly leads my poor
little wife, Cora, astray in this, although,' he says, 'I do not seem to recall
him anywhere in the background of the overdose and the bomb matters. But she is
scarcely more than a child and does not know right from wrong. He is the one
who must die,' Colonel Samuel B. Venus says. 'I wonder who he is?' he says.</p>

<p>Well, of course I know Colonel Samuel B. Venus must be talking about Count
Tomaso, but I can see that Count Tomaso is a total stranger to him, and while I
am by no means opposed to Colonel Samuel B. Venus's sentiments with reference
to Count Tomaso, I do not approve of his spirit of forgiveness towards Mrs.
Colonel Samuel B. Venus, because I figure that as long as she is around and
about, Colonel Samuel B. Venus will always be in danger of accidents.</p>

<p>But I do not feet that this is a time for argument, so I finally get him to
go up on the deck with me, and as soon as we are on deck, Colonel Samuel B.
Venus leaves me and starts running every which way as if he is looking for
somebody.</p>

<p>There seems to be some little agitation on deck, what with smoke and flame
coming out of the <i>Castilla</i> amidships, and many characters, male and female,
running up and down, and around and about, and small children crying.</p>

<p>Some of the crew are launching lifeboats, and then getting into these boats
themselves, and pulling away from the burning ship without waiting for any
passengers, which strikes me as most discourteous on the part of the sailors
and which alarms many passengers so they start chucking themselves over the
rail into the sea trying to catch up with the boats.</p>

<p>Well, this scene is most distasteful to me, so I retire from the general
melee, and go looking elsewhere about the ship, figuring I may find an
opportunity to ease myself quietly into a boat before all the seats are taken
by sailors, and finally I come upon a group trying to launch a big life raft
over the rail, and about this time I observe Colonel Samuel B. Venus standing
against the rail with that thing in his hand, and peering this way and
that.</p>

<p>And then I notice a boat pulling away from the ship, and in the stern of the
boat I see a character in a white polo coat, and a little cap to match, and I
call the attention of Colonel Samuel B. Venus to same.</p>

<p>The boat is so overcrowded that it is far down in the water, but the waves,
which are running very high, are carrying it away in long lunges, and it is
fully one hundred yards off, and is really visible to the naked eye by the
light of the flames from the <i>Castilla</i> only when it rises a moment to the top of
a wave, and Colonel Samuel B. Venus looks for some time before he sees what I
wish him to see.</p>

<p>'I spot him now,' he says. 'I recognize the white polo coat and the little
cap to match.'</p>

<p>And with this, he ups with that thing and goes tooty-toot-toot out across
the water three times, and the last I see of the white polo coat and the little
cap to match they are folding up together very gently just as a big wave washes
the boat off into the darkness beyond the light of the burning ship.</p>

<p>By this time the raft is in the water, and I take Colonel Samuel B. Venus
and chuck him down on to the raft, and then I jump after him, and as the raft
is soon overcrowded, I give the foot to a female character who is on the raft
before anybody else and ease her off into the water.</p>

<p>As this female character disappears in the raging sea, I am not surprised to
observe that she is really nobody but Count Tomaso, as I seem to remember
seeing Count Tomaso making Mrs. Colonel Samuel B. Venus change clothes with him
at the point of a knife.</p>

<p>Well, some of the boats get ashore, and some do not, and in one that does
arrive, they find the late Mrs. Colonel Samuel B. Venus, and everybody is
somewhat surprised to note that she is in male garments with a white polo coat
and a little cap to match.</p>

<p>I wish to call attention to the public service I render in easing Count
Tomaso off the raft, because here is a character who is undoubtedly a menace to
the sanctity of the American home. And I take pride in the fact that I
discharge my debt of gratitude to Colonel Samuel B. Venus, and it is not my
fault that he permits himself to be so overcome by his experience on the ship
and on the raft that he turns out to be a raving nut, and never has the
pleasure of learning that his aim is still so good that he can put three slugs
in a moving target within the span of a baby's hand.<br><br></p>

<p>'Why, George,' I say to Gentleman George, 'then you are the victim of a
great wrong, and I will see the governor, or somebody, in your behalf at once.
They cannot do this to you, when according to your own story, you are not
directly connected with the matter of Mrs. Colonel Samuel B. Venus, and it is
only a case of mistaken identity, at best.'</p>

<p>'Oh, pshaw!' Gentleman George says. 'They are not taking the severe measures
they contemplate with me because of anything that happens to Mrs. Colonel
Samuel B. Venus.</p>

<p>'They are vexed with me,' George says, 'because one night I take Lou
Adolia's automobile out on the salt meadows near Secaucus, N.J., and burn it to
a crisp, and it seems that I forget to remove Lou Adolia first from same.'</p>

<p>'Well, George,' I say, '<i>bon voyage</i>.'</p>

<p>'The same to you,' George says, 'and many of them.'</p>

<h3><a name="It_Comes_Up_Mud" id="It_Comes_Up_Mud">It Comes Up Mud</a></h3>
<p>Personally, I never criticise Miss Beulah Beauregard for breaking her
engagement to Little Alfie, because from what she tells me she becomes engaged
to him under false pretences, and I do not approve of guys using false
pretences on dolls, except, of course, when nothing else will do.</p>

<p>It seems that Little Alfie promises to show Miss Beulah Beauregard the life
of Riley following the races with him when he gets her to give up a first-class
job displaying her shape to the customers in the 900 Club, although Miss Beulah
Beauregard frankly admits that Little Alfie does not say what Riley, and
afterward Little Alfie states that he must be thinking of Four-eyes Riley when
he makes the promise, and everybody knows that Four-eyes Riley is nothing but a
bum, in spades.</p>

<p>Anyway, the life Little Alfie shows Miss Beulah Beauregard after they become
engaged is by no means exciting, according to what she tells me, as Little
Alfie is always going around the race tracks with one or two crocodiles that he
calls race horses, trying to win a few bobs for himself, and generally Little
Alfie is broke and struggling, and Miss Beulah Beauregard says this is no
existence for a member of a proud old Southern family such as the
Beauregards.</p>

<p>In fact, Miss Beulah Beauregard often tells me that she has half a mind to
leave Little Alfie and return to her ancestral home in Georgia, only she can
never think of any way of getting there without walking, and Miss Beulah
Beauregard says it always makes her feet sore to walk very far, although the
only time anybody ever hears of Miss Beulah Beauregard doing much walking is
the time she is shell-roaded on the Pelham Parkway by some Yale guys when she
gets cross with them.</p>

<p>It seems that when Little Alfie is first canvassing Miss Beulah Beauregard
to be his fiancée he builds her up to expect diamonds and furs and limousines
and one thing and another, but the only diamond she ever sees is an engagement
hoop that Little Alfie gives her as the old convincer when he happens to be in
the money for a moment, and it is a very small diamond, at that, and needs a
high north light when you look at it.</p>

<p>But Miss Beulah Beauregard treasures this diamond very highly just the same,
and one reason she finally breaks off her engagement to Little Alfie is because
he borrows the diamond one day during the Hialeah meeting at Miami without
mentioning the matter to her, and hocks it for five bobs which he bets on an
old caterpillar of his by the name of Governor Hicks to show.</p>

<p>Well, the chances are Miss Beulah Beauregard will not mind Little Alfie's
borrowing the diamond so much if he does not take the twenty-five bobs he wins
when Governor Hicks drops in there in the third hole and sends it to Colonel
Matt Winn in Louisville to enter a three-year-old of his by the name of Last
Hope in the Kentucky Derby, this Last Hope being the only other horse Little
Alfie owns at this time.</p>

<p>Such an action makes Miss Beulah Beauregard very indignant indeed, because
she says a babe in arms will know Last Hope cannot walk a mile and a quarter,
which is the Derby distance, let alone run so far, and that even if Last Hope
can run a mile and a quarter, he cannot run it fast enough to get up a
sweat.</p>

<p>In fact, Miss Beulah Beauregard and Little Alfie have words over this
proposition, because Little Alfie is very high on Last Hope and will not stand
for anybody insulting this particular horse, not even his fiancée, although he
never seems to mind what anybody says about Governor Hicks, and, in fact, he
often says it himself.</p>

<p>Personally, I do not understand what Little Alfie sees in Last Hope, because
the horse never starts more than once or twice since it is born, and then has a
tough time finishing last, but Little Alfie says the fifty G's that Colonel
Winn gives to the winner of the Kentucky Derby is just the same as in the jug
in his name, especially if it comes up mud on Derby Day, for Little Alfie
claims that Last Hope is bred to just naturally eat mud.</p>

<p>Well, Miss Beulah Beauregard says there is no doubt Little Alfie blows his
topper, and that there is no percentage in her remaining engaged to a
crack-pot, and many citizens put in with her on her statement because they
consider entering Last Hope in the Derby very great foolishness, no matter if
it comes up mud or what, and right away Tom Shaw offers 1,000 to 1 against the
horse in the future book, and everybody says Tom is underlaying the price at
that.</p>

<p>Miss Beulah Beauregard states that she is very discouraged by the way things
turn out, and that she scarcely knows what to do, because she fears her shape
changes so much in the four or five years she is engaged to Little Alfie that
the customers at the 900 Club may not care to look at it any more, especially
if they have to pay for this privilege, although personally I will pay any
reasonable cover charge to look at Miss Beulah Beauregard's shape any time, if
it is all I suspect. As far as I can see it is still a very nice shape indeed,
if you care for shapes.</p>

<p>Miss Beulah Beauregard is at this time maybe twenty-five or twenty-six, and
is built like a first baseman, being tall and rangy. She has hay-coloured hair,
and blue eyes, and lots of health, and a very good appetite. In fact, I once
see Miss Beulah Beauregard putting on the fried chicken in the Seven Seas
Restaurant in a way that greatly astonishes me, because I never knew before
that members of proud old Southern families are such hearty eaters.
Furthermore, Miss Beulah Beauregard has a very Southern accent, which makes her
sound quite cute, except maybe when she is a little excited and is putting the
zing on somebody, such as Little Alfie.</p>

<p>Well, Little Alfie says he regrets exceedingly that Miss Beulah Beauregard
sees fit to break their engagement, and will not be with him when he cuts up
the Derby dough, as he is planning a swell wedding for her at French Lick after
the race, and even has a list all made out of the presents he is going to buy
her, including another diamond, and now he has all this bother of writing out
the list for nothing.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Little Alfie says he is so accustomed to having Miss Beulah
Beauregard as his fiancée that he scarcely knows what to do without her, and he
goes around with a very sad puss, and is generally quite low in his mind,
because there is no doubt that Little Alfie loves Miss Beulah Beauregard more
than somewhat.</p>

<p>But other citizens are around stating that the real reason Miss Beulah
Beauregard breaks her engagement to Little Alfie is because a guy by the name
of Mr. Paul D. Veere is making a powerful play for her, and she does not wish
him to know that she has any truck with a character such as Little Alfie, for
of course Little Alfie is by no means anything much to look at, and,
furthermore, what with hanging out with his horses most of the time, he never
smells like any rose geranium.</p>

<p>It seems that this Mr. Paul D. Veere is a New York banker, and he has a
little moustache, and plenty of coco-nuts, and Miss Beulah Beauregard meets up
with him one morning when she is displaying her shape on the beach at the Roney
Plaza for nothing, and it also seems that there is enough of her shape left to
interest Mr. Paul D. Veere no little.</p>

<p>In fact, the next thing anybody knows, Mr. Paul D. Veere is taking Miss
Beulah Beauregard here and there, and around and about, although at this time
Miss Beulah Beauregard is still engaged to Little Alfie, and the only reason
Little Alfie does not notice Mr. Paul D. Veere at first is because he is busy
training Last Hope to win the Kentucky Derby, and hustling around trying to get
a few bobs together every day to stand off the overhead, including Miss Beulah
Beauregard, because naturally Miss Beulah Beauregard cannot bear the idea of
living in a fleabag, such as the place where Little Alfie resides, but has to
have a nice room at the Roney Plaza.</p>

<p>Well, personally, I have nothing against bankers as a class, and in fact I
never meet up with many bankers in my life, but somehow I do not care for Mr.
Paul D. Veere's looks. He looks to me like a stony-hearted guy, although, of
course, nobody ever sees any banker who does not look stony-hearted, because it
seems that being bankers just naturally makes them look this way.</p>

<p>But Mr. Paul D. Veere is by no means an old guy, and the chances are he
speaks of something else besides horses to Miss Beulah Beauregard, and
furthermore he probably does not smell like horses all the time, so nobody can
blame Miss Beulah Beauregard for going around and about with him, although many
citizens claim she is a little out of line in accepting Mr. Paul D. Veere's
play while she is still engaged to Little Alfie. In fact, there is great
indignation in some circles about this, as many citizens feel that Miss Beulah
Beauregard is setting a bad example to other fiancées.</p>

<p>But after Miss Beulah Beauregard formally announces that their engagement is
off, it is agreed by one and all that she has a right to do as she pleases, and
that Little Alfie himself gets out of line in what happens at Hialeah a few
days later when he finally notices that Miss Beulah Beauregard seems to be with
Mr. Paul D. Veere, and on very friendly terms with him, at that. In fact,
Little Alfie comes upon Mr. Paul D. Veere in the act of kissing Miss Beulah
Beauregard behind a hibiscus bush out near the paddock, and this scene is most
revolting to Little Alfie as he never cares for hibiscus, anyway.</p>

<p>He forgets that Miss Beulah Beauregard is no longer his fiancée, and tries
to take a punch at Mr. Paul D. Veere, but he is stopped by a number of
detectives, who are greatly horrified at the idea of anybody taking a punch at
a guy who has as many coco-nuts as Mr. Paul D. Veere, and while they are
expostulating with Little Alfie, Miss Beulah Beauregard disappears from the
scene and is observed no more in Miami. Furthermore, Mr. Paul D. Veere also
disappears, but of course nobody minds this very much, and, in fact, his
disappearance is a great relief to all citizens who have fiancées in Miami at
this time.</p>

<p>But it seems that before he disappears Mr. Paul D. Veere calls on certain
officials of the Jockey Club and weighs in the sacks on Little Alfie, stating
that he is a most dangerous character to have loose around a race track, and
naturally the officials are bound to listen to a guy who has as many coco-nuts
as Mr. Paul D. Veere.</p>

<p>So a day or two later old Cap Duhaine, the head detective around the race
track, sends for Little Alfie and asks him what he thinks will become of all
the prominent citizens such as bankers if guys go around taking punches at them
and scaring them half to death, and Little Alfie cannot think of any answer to
this conundrum off-hand, especially as Cap Duhaine then asks Little Alfie if it
will be convenient for him to take his two horses elsewhere.</p>

<p>Well, Little Alfie can see that Cap Duhaine is hinting in a polite way that
he is not wanted around Hialeah any more, and Little Alfie is a guy who can
take a hint as well as the next guy, especially when Cap Duhaine tells him in
confidence that the racing stewards do not seem able to get over the idea that
some scalawag slips a firecracker into Governor Hicks the day old Governor
Hicks runs third, because it seems from what Cap Duhaine says that the stewards
consider it practically supernatural for Governor Hicks to run third anywhere,
any time.</p>

<p>So there Little Alfie is in Miami, as clean as a jaybird, with two horses on
his hands, and no way to ship them to any place where horses are of any
account, and it is quite a predicament indeed, and causes Little Alfie to
ponder quite some. And the upshot of his pondering is that Little Alfie scrapes
up a few bobs here and there, and a few oats, and climbs on Governor Hicks one
day and boots him in the slats and tells him to giddyup, and away he goes out
of Miami, headed north, riding Governor Hicks and leading Last Hope behind him
on a rope.</p>

<p>Naturally, this is considered a most unusual spectacle by one and all who
witness it and, in fact, it is the first time anybody can remember a horse
owner such as Little Alfie riding one of his own horses off in this way, and
Gloomy Gus is offering to lay plenty of 5 to I that Governor Hicks never makes
Palm Beach with Little Alfie up, as it is well known that the old Governor has
bum legs and is half out of wind and is apt to pig it any time.</p>

<p>But it seems that Governor Hicks makes Palm Beach all right with Little
Alfie up and going so easy that many citizens are around asking Gloomy for a
price against Jacksonville. Furthermore, many citizens are now saying that
Little Alfie is a pretty smart guy, at that, to think of such an economical
idea, and numerous other horse owners are looking their stock over to see if
they have anything to ride up north themselves.</p>

<p>Many citizens are also saying that Little Alfie gets a great break when Miss
Beulah Beauregard runs out on him, because it takes plenty of weight off him in
the way of railroad fare and one thing and another; but it seems Little Alfie
does not feel this way about the matter at all. It seems that Little Alfie
often thinks about Miss Beulah Beauregard as he goes jogging along to the
north, and sometimes he talks to Governor Hicks and Last Hope about her, and
especially to Last Hope, as Little Alfie always considers Governor Hicks
somewhat dumb. Also Little Alfie sometimes sings sad love songs right out loud
as he is riding along, although the first time he starts to sing he frightens
Last Hope and causes him to break loose from the lead rope and run away, and
Little Alfie is an hour catching him.</p>

<p>But after this Last Hope gets so he does not mind Little Alfie's voice so
much, except when Little Alfie tries to hit high C. Well, Little Alfie has a
very nice ride, at that, because the weather is fine and the farmers along the
road feed him and his horses, and he has nothing whatever to worry about except
a few saddle galls, and about getting to Kentucky for the Derby in May, and
here it is only late in February, and anyway Little Alfie does not figure to
ride any farther than maybe Maryland where he is bound to make a scratch so he
can ship from there.</p>

<p>Now, one day Little Alfie is riding along a road through a stretch of piny
woods, a matter of maybe ninety-odd miles north of Jacksonville, which puts him
in the State of Georgia, when he passes a half-ploughed field on one side of
the road near a ramshackly old house and beholds a most unusual scene:</p>

<p>A large white mule hitched to a plough is sitting down in the field and a
tall doll in a sunbonnet and a gingham dress is standing beside the mule crying
very heartily.</p>

<p>Naturally, the spectacle of a doll in distress, or even a doll who is not in
distress, is bound to attract Little Alfie's attention, so he tells Governor
Hicks and Last Hope to whoa, and then he asks the doll what is eating her, and
the doll looks up at him out of her sunbonnet, and who is this doll but Miss
Beulah Beauregard.</p>

<p>Of course Little Alfie is somewhat surprised to see Miss Beulah Beauregard
crying over a mule, and especially in a sunbonnet, so he climbs down off of
Governor Hicks to inquire into this situation, and right away Miss Beulah
Beauregard rushes up to Little Alfie and chucks herself into his arms and
speaks as follows:</p>

<p>'Oh, Alfie,' Miss Beulah Beauregard says, 'I am so glad you find me. I am
thinking of you day and night, and wondering if you forgive me. Oh, Alfie, I
love you,' she says. 'I am very sorry I go away with Mr. Paul D. Veere. He is
nothing but a great rapscallion,' she says. 'He promises to make me his
ever-loving wife when he gets me to accompany him from Miami to his
shooting-lodge on the Altamaha River, twenty-five miles from here, although,'
she says, 'I never know before he has such a lodge in these parts.</p>

<p>'And,' Miss Beulah Beauregard says, 'the very first day I have to pop him
with a pot of cold cream and render him half unconscious to escape his
advances. Oh, Alfie,' she says, 'Mr. Paul D. Veere's intentions towards me are
by no means honourable. Furthermore,' she says, 'I learn he already has an
ever-loving wife and three children in New York.'</p>

<p>Well, of course Little Alfie is slightly perplexed by this matter and can
scarcely think of anything much to say, but finally he says to Miss Beulah
Beauregard like this:</p>

<p>'Well,' he says, 'but what about the mule?'</p>

<p>'Oh,' Miss Beulah Beauregard says, 'his name is Abimelech, and I am
ploughing with him when he hauls off and sits down and refuses to budge. He is
the only mule we own,' she says, 'and he is old and ornery, and nobody can do
anything whatever with him when he wishes to sit down. But,' she says, 'my papa
will be very angry because he expects me to get this field all ploughed up by
supper-time. In fact,' Miss Beulah Beauregard says, 'I am afraid my papa will
be so angry he will give me a whopping, because he by no means forgives me as
yet for coming home, and this is why I am shedding tears when you come
along.'</p>

<p>Then Miss Beulah Beauregard begins crying again as if her heart will break,
and if there is one thing Little Alfie hates and despises it is to see a doll
crying, and especially Miss Beulah Beauregard, for Miss Beulah Beauregard can
cry in a way to wake the dead when she is going good, so Little Alfie holds her
so close to his chest he ruins four cigars in his vest pocket, and speaks to
her as follows:</p>

<p>'Tut, tut,' Little Alfie says. 'Tut, tut, tut, tut, tut,' he says. 'Dry your
eyes and we will just hitch old Governor Hicks here to the plough and get this
field ploughed quicker than you can say scat, because,' Little Alfie says,
'when I am a young squirt, I am the best plougher in Columbia County, New
York.'</p>

<p>Well, this idea cheers Miss Beulah Beauregard up no little, and so Little
Alfie ties Last Hope to a tree and takes the harness off Abimelech, the mule,
who keeps right on sitting down as if he does not care what happens, and puts
the harness on Governor Hicks and hitches Governor Hicks to the plough, and the
way the old Governor carries on when he finds out they wish him to pull a
plough is really most surprising. In fact, Little Alfie has to get a club and
reason with Governor Hicks before he will settle down and start pulling the
plough.</p>

<p>It turns out that Little Alfie is a first-class plougher, at that, and while
he is ploughing, Miss Beulah Beauregard walks along with him and talks a blue
streak, and Little Alfie learns more things from her in half an hour than he
ever before suspects in some years, and especially about Miss Beulah Beauregard
herself.</p>

<p>It seems that the ramshackly old house is Miss Beulah Beauregard's ancestral
home, and that her people are very poor, and live in these piny woods for
generations, and that their name is Benson and not Beauregard at all, this
being nothing but a name that Miss Beulah Beauregard herself thinks up out of
her own head when she goes to New York to display her shape.</p>

<p>Furthermore, when they go to the house it comes out that Miss Beulah
Beauregard's papa is a tall, skinny old guy with a goatee, who can lie faster
than Little Alfie claims Last Hope can run. But it seems that the old skeezicks
takes quite an interest in Last Hope when Little Alfie begins telling him what
a great horse this horse is, especially in the mud, and how he is going to win
the Kentucky Derby.</p>

<p>In fact, Miss Beulah Beauregard's papa seems to believe everything Little
Alfie tells him, and as he is the first guy Little Alfie ever meets up with who
believes anything he tells about anything whatever, it is a privilege and a
pleasure for Little Alfie to talk to him. Miss Beulah Beauregard also has a
mamma who turns out to be very fat, and full of Southern hospitality, and quite
handy with a skillet.</p>

<p>Then there is a grown brother by the name of Jeff, who is practically a
genius, as he knows how to disguise skimmin's so it makes a person only a
little sick when they drink it, this skimmin's being a drink which is made from
skimmings that come to the top on boiling sugar cane, and generally it tastes
like gasoline, and is very fatal indeed.</p>

<p>Now, the consequences are Little Alfie finds this place very pleasant, and
he decides to spend a few weeks there, paying for his keep with the services of
Governor Hicks as a plough horse, especially as he is now practically engaged
to Miss Beulah Beauregard all over again and she will not listen to him leaving
without her. But they have no money for her railroad fare, and Little Alfie
becomes very indignant when she suggests she can ride Last Hope on north while
he is riding Governor Hicks, and wishes to know if she thinks a Derby candidate
can be used for a truck horse.</p>

<p>Well, this almost causes Miss Beulah Beauregard to start breaking the
engagement all over again, as she figures it is a dirty crack about her heft,
but her papa steps in and says they must remain until Governor Hicks get
through with the ploughing anyway, or he will know the reason why. So Little
Alfie stays and he puts in all his spare time training Last Hope and wondering
who he can write to for enough dough to send Miss Beulah Beauregard north when
the time comes.</p>

<p>He trains Last Hope by walking him and galloping him along the country roads
in person, and taking care of him as if he is a baby, and what with this work,
and the jog up from Miami, Last Hope fills out very strong and hearty, and
anybody must admit that he is not a bad-looking beetle, though maybe a little
more leggy than some like to see.</p>

<p>Now, it comes a Sunday, and all day long there is a very large storm with
rain and wind that takes to knocking over big trees, and one thing and another,
and no one is able to go outdoors much. So late in the evening Little Alfie and
Miss Beulah Beauregard and all the Bensons are gathered about the stove in the
kitchen drinking skimmin's, and Little Alfie is telling them all over again
about how Last Hope will win the Kentucky Derby, especially if it comes up mud,
when they hear a hammering at the door.</p>

<p>When the door is opened, who comes in but Mr. Paul D. Veere, sopping wet
from head to foot, including his little moustache, and limping so he can
scarcely walk, and naturally his appearance nonplusses Miss Beulah Beauregard
and Little Alfie, who can never forget that Mr. Paul D. Veere is largely
responsible for the saddle galls he gets riding up from Miami.</p>

<p>In fact, several times since he stops at Miss Beulah Beauregard's ancestral
home, Little Alfie thinks of Mr. Paul D. Veere, and every time he thinks of him
he is in favour of going over to Mr. Paul D. Veere's shooting-lodge on the
Altamaha and speaking to him severely.</p>

<p>But Miss Beulah Beauregard always stops him, stating that the proud old
Southern families in this vicinity are somewhat partial to the bankers and
other rich guys from the North who have shooting-lodges around and about in the
piny woods, and especially on the Altamaha, because these guys furnish a market
to the local citizens for hunting guides, and corn liquor, and one thing and
another.</p>

<p>Miss Beulah Beauregard says if a guest of the Bensons speaks to Mr. Paul D.
Veere severely, it may be held against the family, and it seems that the Benson
family cannot stand any more beefs against it just at this particular time. So
Little Alfie never goes, and here all of a sudden is Mr. Paul D. Veere right in
his lap.</p>

<p>Naturally, Little Alfie steps forward and starts winding up a large right
hand with the idea of parking it on Mr. Paul D. Veere's chin; but Mr. Paul D.
Veere seems to see that there is hostility afoot, and he backs up against the
wall, and raises his hand, and speaks as follows:</p>

<p>'Folks,' Mr. Paul D. Veere says, 'I just go into a ditch in my automobile
half a mile up the road. My car is a wreck,' he says, 'and my right leg seems
so badly hurt I am just barely able to drag myself here. Now, folks,' he says,
'it is almost a matter of life and death with me to get to the station at
Tillinghast in time to flag the Orange Blossom Special. It is the last train
to-night to Jacksonville, and I must be in Jacksonville before midnight so I
can hire an aeroplane and get to New York by the time my bank opens at ten
o'clock in the morning. It is about ten hours by plane from Jacksonville to New
York,' Mr. Paul D. Veere says, 'so if I can catch the Orange Blossom, I will be
able to just about make it!'</p>

<p>Then he goes on speaking in a low voice and states that he receives a
telephone message from New York an hour or so before at his lodge telling him
he must hurry home, and right away afterward, while he is trying to telephone
the station at Tillinghast to make sure they will hold the Orange Blossom until
he gets there, no matter what, all the telephone and telegraph wires around and
about go down in the storm.</p>

<p>So he starts for the station in his car, and just as it looks as if he may
make it, his car runs smack-dab into a ditch and Mr. Paul D. Veere's leg is
hurt so there is no chance he can walk the rest of the way to the station, and
there Mr. Paul D. Veere is.</p>

<p>'It is a very desperate case, folks,' Mr. Paul D. Veere says. 'Let me take
your automobile, and I will reward you liberally.' Well, at this Miss Beulah
Beauregard's papa looks at a clock on the kitchen wall and states as
follows:</p>

<p>'We do not keep an automobile, neighbour,' he says, 'and anyway,' he says,
'it is quite a piece from here to Tillinghast and the Orange Blossom is due in
ten minutes, so I do not see how you can possibly make it. Rest your hat,
neighbour,' Miss Beulah Beauregard's papa says, 'and have some skimmin's, and
take things easy, and I will look at your leg and see how bad you are bunged
up.'</p>

<p>Well, Mr. Paul D. Veere seems to turn as pale as a pillow as he hears this
about the time, and then he says: 'Lend me a horse and buggy,' he says. 'I must
be in New York in person in the morning. No one else will do but me,' he says,
and as he speaks these words he looks at Miss Beulah Beauregard and then at
Little Alfie as if he is speaking to them personally, although up to this time
he does not look at either of them after he comes into the kitchen.</p>

<p>'Why, neighbour,' Miss Beulah Beauregard's papa says, 'we do not keep a
buggy, and even if we do keep a buggy we do not have time to hitch up anything
to a buggy. Neighbour,' he says, 'you are certainly on a bust if you think you
can catch the Orange Blossom now.'</p>

<p>'Well, then,' Mr. Paul D. Veere says, very sorrowful, 'I will have to go to
jail.'</p>

<p>Then he flops himself down in a chair and covers his face with his hands,
and he is a spectacle such as is bound to touch almost any heart, and when she
sees him in this state Miss Beulah Beauregard begins crying because she hates
to see anybody as sorrowed up as Mr. Paul D. Veere, and between sobs she asks
Little Alfie to think of something to do about the situation.</p>

<p>'Let Mr. Paul D. Veere ride Governor Hicks to the station,' Miss Beauregard
says. 'After all,' she says, 'I cannot forget his courtesy in sending me
half-way here in his car from his shooting-lodge after I pop him with the pot
of cold cream, instead of making me walk as those Yale guys do the time they
red-light me.'</p>

<p>'Why,' Little Alfie says, 'it is a mile and a quarter from the gate out here
to the station. I know,' he says, 'because I get a guy in an automobile to
clock it on his meter one day last week, figuring to give Last Hope a workout
over the full Derby route pretty soon. The road must be fetlock deep in mud at
this time, and,' Little Alfie says, 'Governor Hicks cannot as much as stand up
in the mud. The only horse in the world that can run fast enough through this
mud to make the Orange Blossom is Last Hope, but,' Little Alfie says, 'of
course I'm not letting anybody ride a horse as valuable as Last Hope to catch
trains.'</p>

<p>Well, at this Mr. Paul D. Veere lifts his head and looks at Little Alfie
with great interest and speaks as follows: 'How much is this valuable horse
worth?' Mr. Paul D. Veere says.</p>

<p>'Why,' Little Alfie says, 'he is worth anyway fifty G's to me, because,' he
says, 'this is the sum Colonel Winn is giving to the winner of the Kentucky
Derby, and there is no doubt whatever that Last Hope will be this winner,
especially,' Little Alfie says, 'if it comes up mud.'</p>

<p>'I do not carry any such large sum of money as you mention on my person,'
Mr. Paul D. Veere says, 'but,' he says, 'if you are willing to trust me, I will
give you my IOU for same, just to let me ride your horse to the station. I am
once the best amateur steeplechase rider in the Hunts Club,' Mr. Paul D. Veere
says, 'and if your horse can run at all there is still a chance for me to keep
out of jail.'</p>

<p>Well, the chances are Little Alfie will by no means consider extending a
line of credit for fifty G's to Mr. Paul D. Veere or any other banker, and
especially a banker who is once an amateur steeplechase jock, because if there
is one thing Little Alfie does not trust it is an amateur steeplechase jock,
and furthermore Little Alfie is somewhat offended because Mr. Paul D. Veere
seems to think he is running a livery stable.</p>

<p>But Miss Beulah Beauregard is now crying so loud nobody can scarcely hear
themselves think, and Little Alfie gets to figuring what she may say to him if
he does not rent Last Hope to Mr. Paul D. Veere at this time and it comes out
later that Last Hope does not happen to win the Kentucky Derby after all. So he
finally says all right, and Mr. Paul D. Veere at once outs with a little gold
pencil and a notebook, and scribbles off a marker for fifty G's to Little
Alfie.</p>

<p>And the next thing anybody knows, Little Alfie is leading Last Hope out of
the barn and up to the gate with nothing on him but a bridle as Little Alfie
does not wish to waste time saddling, and as he is boosting Mr. Paul D. Veere
on to Last Hope Little Alfie speaks as follows:</p>

<p>'You have three minutes left,' Little Alfie says. 'It is almost a straight
course, except for a long turn going into the last quarter. Let this fellow
run,' he says. 'You will find plenty of mud all the way, but,' Little Alfie
says, 'this is a mud-running fool. In fact,' Little Alfie says, 'you are pretty
lucky it comes up mud.'</p>

<p>Then he gives Last Hope a smack on the hip and away goes Last Hope
lickity-split through the mud and anybody can see from the way Mr. Paul D.
Veere is sitting on him that Mr. Paul D. Veere knows what time it is when it
comes to riding. In fact, Little Alfie himself says he never sees a better seat
anywhere in his life, especially for a guy who is riding bareback.</p>

<p>Well, Little Alfie watches them go down the road in a gob of mud, and it
will always be one of the large regrets of Little Alfie's life that he leaves
his split-second super in hock in Miami, because he says he is sure Last Hope
runs the first quarter through the mud faster than any quarter is ever run
before in this world. But of course Little Alfie is more excited than somewhat
at this moment, and the chances are he exaggerates Last Hope's speed.</p>

<p>However, there is no doubt that Last Hope goes over the road very rapidly,
indeed, as a coloured party who is out squirrel hunting comes along a few
minutes afterward and tells Little Alfie that something goes past him on the
road so fast he cannot tell exactly what it is, but he states that he is pretty
sure it is old Henry Devil himself, because he smells smoke as it passes him,
and hears a voice yelling hi-yah. But of course the chances are this voice is
nothing but the voice of Mr. Paul D. Veere yelling words of encouragement to
Last Hope.</p>

<p>It is not until the station-master at Tillinghast, a guy by the name of
Asbury Potts, drives over to Miss Beulah Beauregard's ancestral home an hour
later that Little Alfie hears that as Last Hope pulls up at the station and Mr.
Paul D. Veere dismounts with so much mud on him that nobody can tell if he is a
plaster cast or what, the horse is gimping as bad as Mr. Paul D. Veere himself,
and Asbury Potts says there is no doubt Last Hope bows a tendon, or some such,
and that if they are able to get him to the races again he will eat his old
wool hat.</p>

<p>'But, personally,' Asbury Potts says as he mentions this sad news, 'I do not
see what Mr. Paul D. Veere's hurry is, at that, to be pushing a horse so hard.
He has fifty-seven seconds left by my watch when the Orange Blossom pulls in
right on time to the dot,' Asbury Potts says.</p>

<p>Well, at this Little Alfie sits down and starts figuring, and finally he
figures that Last Hope runs the mile and a quarter in around 2.03 in the mud,
with maybe one hundred and sixty pounds up, for Mr. Paul D. Veere is no feather
duster, and no horse ever runs a mile and a quarter in the mud in the Kentucky
Derby as fast as this, or anywhere else as far as anybody knows, so Little
Alfie claims that this is practically flying.</p>

<p>But of course few citizens ever accept Little Alfie's figures as strictly
official, because they do not know if Asbury Potts's watch is properly
regulated for timing race horses, even though Asbury Potts is 100 per cent
right when he says they will never be able to get Last Hope to the races
again.</p>

<p>Well, I meet up with Little Alfie one night this summer in Mindy's
Restaurant on Broadway, and it is the first time he is observed in these parts
in some time, and he seems to be looking very prosperous, indeed, and after we
get to cutting up old touches, he tells me the reason for this prosperity.</p>

<p>It seems that after Mr. Paul D. Veere returns to New York and puts back in
his bank whatever it is that it is advisable for him to put back, or takes out
whatever it is that seems best to take out, and gets himself all rounded up so
there is no chance of his going to jail, he remembers that there is a slight
difference between him and Little Alfie, so what does Mr. Paul D. Veere do but
sit down and write out a cheque for fifty G's to Little Alfie to take up his
IOU, so Little Alfie is nothing out on account of losing the Kentucky Derby,
and, in fact, he is stone rich, and I am glad to hear of it, because I always
sympathize deeply with him in his bereavement over the loss of Last Hope. Then
I ask Little Alfie what he is doing in New York at this time, and he states to
me as follows:</p>

<p>'Well,' Little Alfie says, 'I will tell you. The other day,' he says, 'I get
to thinking things over, and among other things I get to thinking that after
Last Hope wins the Kentucky Derby, he is a sure thing to go on and also win the
Maryland Preakness, because,' Little Alfie says, 'the Preakness is a sixteenth
of a mile shorter than the Derby, and a horse that can run a mile and a quarter
in the mud in around 2.03 with a brick house on his back is bound to make
anything that wears hair look silly at a mile and three-sixteenths,
especially,' Little Alfie says, 'if it comes up mud.</p>

<p>'So,' Little Alfie says, 'I am going to call on Mr. Paul D. Veere and see if
he does not wish to pay me the Preakness stake, too, because,' he says, 'I am
building the finest house in South Georgia at Last Hope, which is my stock farm
where Last Hope himself is on public exhibition, and I can always use a few
bobs here and there.'</p>

<p>'Well, Alfie,' I say, 'this seems to me to be a very fair proposition,
indeed, and,' I say, 'I am sure Mr. Paul D. Veere will take care of it as soon
as it is called to his attention, as there is no doubt you and Last Hope are of
great service to Mr. Paul D. Veere. By the way, Alfie,' I say, 'whatever
becomes of Governor Hicks?'</p>

<p>'Why,' Little Alfie says, 'do you know Governor Hicks turns out to be a
terrible disappointment to me as a plough horse? He learns how to sit down from
Abimelech, the mule, and nothing will make him stir, not even the same
encouragement I give him the day he drops down there third at Hialeah.</p>

<p>'But,' Little Alfie says, 'my ever-loving wife is figuring on using the old
Governor as a saddle-horse for our twins, Beulah and Little Alfie, Junior, when
they get old enough, although,' he says, 'I tell her the Governor will never be
worth a dime in such a way especially,' Little Alfie says, 'if it comes up
mud.'</p>

<h3><a name="The_Big_Umbrella" id="The_Big_Umbrella">The Big Umbrella</a></h3>
<p>Now No. 23 is a very high-class trap which is patronized only by the better
element of rumpots in New York, and what I am doing in these unusual
surroundings with Spider McCoy, the fight manager, is something that requires a
job of telling.</p>

<p>This No. 23 is a spot where wealthy characters assemble on an afternoon and
evening to sit around tables or stand at the bar guzzling old-fashioneds, and
Scotches, and other delicacies of this nature, and there are always many
swell-looking Judys present, so it is generally a scene of great gaiety, but it
is certainly about the last place you will ever expect to find Spider McCoy and
me.</p>

<p>But there we are, and the reason we are there starts in front of Mindy's
restaurant on Broadway, when I observe Spider McCoy walking along the street
following close behind a tall young character of most unique appearance in many
respects.</p>

<p>This tall young character cannot be more than twenty-one years of age, and
he is maybe six feet two inches tall and must weigh around one hundred and
ninety pounds. He has shoulders like the back of a truck, and he has blond
hair, and pink cheeks, and is without doubt as good-looking as any male
character has a right to be without causing comment.</p>

<p>He is wearing a pair of striped pants, and a cut-away coat, and a white
vest, and a high hat, and in fact he is dressed as if he just comes from a
high-toned wedding such as you see in pictures in the Sunday blats, and this is
by no means a familiar costume in front of Mindy's, so naturally the tall young
character attracts no little attention, and many citizens wonder what he is
advertising.</p>

<p>Well, as soon as he sees me, Spider McCoy beckons me to join him, and as I
fall into step with him behind the tall young character, Spider McCoy says to
me:</p>

<p>'Sh-h-h-h!' Spider McCoy says. 'Here is without doubt the next heavy-weight
champion of the whole world. I just see him kiss the jockey of a short down the
street with a right-hand shot that is positively a lily. It does not travel
more than three inches. The jockey takes a run at this party quite ferocious
and, bap, down he goes as still as a plank under his own cab. It is the best
natural right hand I ever see. He reminds me of Jack Dempsey,' Spider McCoy
says. 'Also Gene Tunney.'</p>

<p>Well, it is very seldom I see Spider McCoy but what he is speaking of some
guy who is the next heavy-weight champion of the world, and they nearly always
remind him of Jack Dempsey and Gene Tunney, and sometimes of Max Schmeling, so
I am about to go about my business when Spider grabs me by the arm and compels
me to accompany him.</p>

<p>'Who is the guy, Spider?' I say.</p>

<p>'What difference does it make who a guy is that can punch like he can?'
Spider says. 'All I know is he is the next heavy-weight champion of the world
if he gets in the proper hands, such as mine. The broads will go crazy about
his looks and the way he dresses. He will be a wonderful card,' Spider says.
'You can see by the way he carries himself that he is a natural fighter. He is
loose and light on his feet,' he says. 'Chances are there is plenty of animal
in him. I like my fighters to have plenty of animal in them, especially,'
Spider says, 'my heavy-weights.'</p>

<p>'Well, Spider,' I say, 'from the way your heavy-weights I see knock off that
hot meat on you, there is plenty of animal in them. But,' I say, 'how do you
know this party wishes to be a fighter, anyway? Maybe he has other plans in
life.'</p>

<p>'We will find out,' Spider McCoy says. 'We will tail him until we learn
where he hangs out so I can make a connection with him. Look at his chest
development,' Spider says. 'Look at his small waist-line,' he says. 'Look at
the shape of his head.'</p>

<p>So we follow the tall young character until he leads us into No. 23, and I
notice that Sammy the doorman gives him a very small hello, and I figure the
tall young character cannot be anybody much, because when anybody is anybody
much, Sammy the doorman gives them a very large hello, indeed. In fact, Sammy's
hello to the tall young character is almost as small as the hello he gives us,
and this is practically unnoticeable.</p>

<p>Well, I know Sammy the doorman from back down the years when he is not
working in a joint as classy as No. 23, and to tell the truth I know him when
he is nothing but a steer for a bust-out joint in West Forty-third, a bust-out
joint being a joint where they will cheat your eyeballs out at cards, and dice,
and similar devices. So I ask Sammy who the tall young character is, and Sammy
says:</p>

<p>'Oh,' he says, 'he is one of these ex-kings. He comes from some nickel
country over in Europe. A dictator gives him the foot off the throne and then
chases him out of the country and takes personal charge of matters. His name is
Jonas. I mean the ex-king,' Sammy says. 'They are getting to be quite a
nuisance around.'</p>

<p>'Is this ex-king holding anything?' I say.</p>

<p>'Nothing,' Sammy says. 'Not a quarter. The hotel where he is stopping
catches him out to a society tea the other afternoon and puts a hickey in his
keyhole and now he cannot get at his other clothes and has to go around the way
you see him. The chances are,' Sammy says, 'he is in here looking to cadge a
drink or a bite to eat.'</p>

<p>Well, Spider McCoy is looking the joint over to see if he can find anybody
he knows to introduce him to the ex-king, but when I tell him what Sammy says,
Spider at once eases himself up alongside the ex-king and begins talking to
him, because Spider knows that when guys are not holding anything they are
willing to talk to anybody.</p>

<p>He is somewhat surprised to find that the ex-king speaks English and seems
to be a nice, pleasant young character and the chances are he is by no means
high-toned even when he is holding something, so pretty soon Spider is buying
him Scotches, although this is by no means a dram that Spider approves of for
fighters unless they buy them themselves, and finally Spider says to him like
this:</p>

<p>'I see you tag that taxi jockey over on Broadway,' Spider says. 'I never see
a more beautiful right in my born days. It reminds me something of Georges
Carpentier's right, only,' Spider says, 'Georges always pulls his just a little
before shooting to get more leverage, and you just barely move yours. Why,'
Spider says, 'the more I think of it, the more I am amazed. What does the guy
do to vex you?'</p>

<p>'Why,' the ex-king says, 'he does not do anything to vex me. I am quite
unvexed at the time. It is almost inadvertent. The taxi-driver gets off his
seat and starts to run after a passenger that fails to settle his account with
him, and he is about to collide with me there on the sidewalk, so,' he says, 'I
just put out my right hand to ward him off, and he runs into it with his chin
and knocks himself unconscious. I must look him up some day and express my
regrets. But,' he says, 'I will never think of deliberately striking anybody
without serious provocation.'</p>

<p>Well, at this, Spider McCoy is somewhat nonplussed, because he can now see
that what he takes for the ex-king's natural punch is merely an accident that
may not happen if it is on purpose, and furthermore, the ex-king's expressions
are scarcely the expressions of anybody with much animal in them, and Spider is
commencing to regret the purchase of the Scotches for the ex-king. In fact, I
can see that Spider is reaching a state of mind that may cause him to take a
pop at the ex-king for grossly deceiving him.</p>

<p>But Spider McCoy cannot look at six feet two and one hundred and ninety
pounds of anybody under thirty without becoming most avaricious, and so after a
couple of more Scotches, he begins feeling the ex-king's muscles, which causes
the ex-king to laugh quite heartily, as it seems he is a little ticklish in
spots, and finally Spider says:</p>

<p>'Well,' he says, 'there is undoubtedly great natural strength here, and all
it needs is to be properly developed. Why,' Spider says, 'the more I think of
you knocking a guy out by just letting him run into your hand, the more
impressed I am. In fact,' he says, 'I can scarcely get over it. How do you feel
about becoming a professional?'</p>

<p>'A professional what?' the ex-king says.</p>

<p>'A professional boxer,' Spider says. 'It is a name we have in this country
for prize-fighters.'</p>

<p>'I never give such a matter a thought,' the ex-king says. 'What is the
idea?'</p>

<p>'The idea is money,' Spider McCoy says. 'I hear of other ideas for
professional boxing, but,' he says, 'I do not approve of them, your
Majesty.'</p>

<p>'Call me Jonas,' the ex-king says. 'Do you mean to tell me I can make money
out of boxing? Well, I will feel right kindly towards anything I can make money
out of. I find,' he says, 'that money seems to be somewhat necessary in this
country.'</p>

<p>So then Spider McCoy explains to him how he can make a ton of money by
winning the heavy-weight championship of the world and that all he requires to
do this is to have Spider for his manager. Furthermore, Spider explains that
all he will ask for being the manager is 33 1/3 per cent of the ex-king's earnings,
with the expenses off the top, which means before they cut up anything.</p>

<p>Well, the ex-king listens very intently and keeps nodding his head to show
that he understands, and finally he says:</p>

<p>'In the meantime,' he says, 'do I eat?'</p>

<p>'The best, your Majesty,' Spider says.</p>

<p>'Call me Jonas,' the ex-king says again. 'All right, then,' Jonas says, 'I
will become heavy-weight champion of the world as you say, and make a ton of
money, and then I snap my fingers at Dictator Poltafuss, the dirty rat.'</p>

<p>'The big heel,' Spider says.</p>

<p>So Spider McCoy takes Jonas to his home, which is an apartment in West
Fiftieth Street, where his orphan niece, Miss Margie Grogan, keeps house for
him, and bosses him around no little, and quite some, and I go with them to
lend moral support to Spider, because by this time he is slightly Scotched up,
and he always likes to have a little moral support when he goes home
Scotched.</p>

<p>His niece, Miss Margie Grogan, is a Judy of maybe twenty, and if you like
them small, and lively, and with huckleberry hair, and blue eyes, and freckles
on the nose, and plenty of temper, she is all right. In fact, I hear some say
that Margie is extra all right, but those who say this are younger than I am
and maybe not such good judges. Personally, I like them with more heft and less
temper.</p>

<p>It is not a large apartment where Spider McCoy lives, but it is a neat and
clean little joint, at that, for Margie is without doubt a good all-round
housekeeper. Furthermore, she is much better than a raw hand with a skillet,
and she comes flying out of the kitchen with her face red and her hair all
tousled up to meet Spider, but when she sees Jonas behind him she stops, and
speaks as follows:</p>

<p>'Good grief,' Margie says, 'another big umbrella.'</p>

<p>'What do you mean, umbrella?' Spider says.</p>

<p>'Why,' Margie says, 'something that folds up. I never know you to bring home
any other kind.'</p>

<p>'This is no umbrella,' Spider says. 'This is the next heavyweight champion
of the world.'</p>

<p>'No,' Margie says, 'it cannot be, for two months you tell me that somebody
called Ben Robbins is the next heavy-weight champion of the world.'</p>

<p>'Ben Robbins is nothing but a bum,' Spider says.</p>

<p>'So I find out,' Margie says. 'Well,' she says, 'come on in, you and your
next heavy-weight champion of the world. We are about to put on the corned beef
and.'</p>

<p>Then Spider introduces Jonas to her, and right away Jonas grabs her hand and
lifts it to his lips, and this astonishes Margie no little, and afterward she
tells me that she regrets for a moment that she just recently sticks her hand
in a pot of boiled onions, and the chances are Jonas does too.</p>

<p>But Miss Margie Grogan is by no means in favour of prize-fighters in any
manner, shape or form, because all they ever mean to her is an extra plate, and
more cooking, and it is plain to be seen that though he seems to be an expert
hand-kisser, Jonas is no more welcome than any of the others that Spider brings
home, and he brings them home too often to suit Margie.</p>

<p>The ones he brings home are always heavy-weight prospects, for while Spider
McCoy manages a number of fighters, he never gets excited about anything but a
heavy-weight, and this is the way all fight managers are. A fight manager may
have a light-weight champion of the world, but he will get more heated up about
some sausage who scarcely knows how to hold his hands up if he is a
heavy-weight.</p>

<p>Personally, I consider it most remarkable that Margie is able to spot Jonas
as one of Spider's heavy-weight prospects in a high hat and a cut-away coat,
but Margie says it is a sixth sense with her. She says Spider once brings home
a party with a beard half-way down to his waist, but that as soon as she opens
the door she pegs him as a heavy-weight prospect that Spider does not yet have
time to get shaved.</p>

<p>But she says she is so fond of Spider that she takes them all in, and feeds
them up good, and the only time she ever bars anybody on him is the time Spider
brings home a big widow he finds in Mickey Walker's bar and claims he is going
to make her the only female contender for the heavy-weight title in the world.
Miss Margie Grogan says she has to draw the line somewhere on Uncle Spider's
prospects.</p>

<p>Well, from now on, Spider has Jonas in the gymnasium for several hours every
day, teaching how to box, and anybody will tell you that Spider is as good a
teacher as there is in the world, especially of a punch that is called the
one-two, although this punch is really two punches. It is a left jab followed
through fast with a right cross, and it is considered quite a gravy punch if
properly put on.</p>

<p>Jonas lives in a spare room in Spider's apartment, and takes his meals
there, and Spider tells me everything will be very nice indeed for them all, if
Margie does not happen to take more of a dislike than somewhat to Jonas,
especially when she learns that he is once a king and gets the old
hoovus-groovus from a dictator.</p>

<p>Margie tells Spider McCoy that it proves there must be anyway a trace of
umbrella in a character who lets anybody run him out of his own country, and
Spider says the only reason he does not give her an argument on the matter is
that he is not sure but what she is right, though not because Jonas lets
himself get run out.</p>

<p>'I do not figure this in at all,' Spider says. 'I sometimes let myself get
run out of places, and I do not think there is umbrella in me, or anyway not
much. But,' he says, 'a young heavy-weight prospect is a peculiar proposition.
You can find out in the gymnasium if he can box, if he is fast, and if he can
punch, but you cannot find out if he can take a punch and if he is dead game
until you see him boffed around good in the ring.</p>

<p>'And,' Spider says, 'this is what you must find out before you know if you
have a heavy-weight contender, or just a heavyweight. This Jonas looks great in
the gym, but,' he says, 'sometimes I wonder about him. I do not know why I
wonder, but I remember I wonder the same way about Ben Robbins, who is such a
gymnasium marvel that I turn down twenty thousand for his contract. Then,'
Spider says, 'I put him with this punching-bag, Joe Grosher, in Newark, and my
guy geeks it the first good smack he gets. Somehow,' Spider says, 'Jonas has a
certain look in his eyes that reminds me of Ben Robbins.'</p>

<p>'Well,' I says, 'if you are not sure about him, why not chuck him in with
somebody the same as you do Ben, and find out if he can fight, or what?'</p>

<p>'Look,' Spider McCoy says, 'I will never find out anything more about this
guy than I know now, if the offers I am getting keep on coming in. I will not
have to find out,' he says. 'We must have a hundred propositions right now, and
I am going to commence taking some.'</p>

<p>Naturally the blats make quite an uproar when they discover that an ex-king
is training to be a fighter, and they are full of stories and pictures about
Jonas every day, and Spider of course does not discourage this publicity
because it is responsible for the offers of matches for Jonas from all over the
country.</p>

<p>But the matches Spider finally commences accepting are not the matches the
promoters offer, because the promoters offer opponents who may have no respect
for royalty, and may try to knock Jonas's brains out. The matches Spider
accepts have his own personal supervision, and they are much better for Jonas
than what the promoters might think up.</p>

<p>These matches are with sure-footed watermen, who plunge in swiftly and
smoothly when Jonas waves at them, and while everybody knows these matches are
strictly tank jobs, nobody cares, especially the customers who almost break
down the doors of the clubs where Jonas appears, trying to get in. The
customers are so greatly pleased to be permitted to observe an ex-king in short
pants that they scarcely pause for their change at the box-office windows.</p>

<p>Of course Spider does not tell Jonas that these contests are dipsydoos and
Jonas thinks he really is belting out these porter-houses, and as he is getting
pretty nice money for the work, he feels very well, indeed. Anybody will tell
you that it helps build up a young fighter's confidence to let him see a few
people take naps in front of him as he is coming along, though Jonas is
slightly bewildered the night at the Sun Casino when a generally very reliable
waterboy by the name of Charley Drunckley misses his cue and falls down before
Jonas can hit him.</p>

<p>The boxing commission is somewhat bewildered, too, and asks a few questions
that nobody tries to answer, and Spider McCoy explains to Jonas that he hits so
fast he cannot notice his punches landing himself, but even then Jonas
continues to look somewhat bewildered.</p>

<p>He continues living at Spider McCoy's apartment, because Spider is by no
means sucker enough to let Jonas get very far away from him, what with so many
unscrupulous characters around the boxing game who are always looking to steal
somebody's fighter, especially a fighter who is worth his weight in platinum,
like Jonas, but from what I hear Miss Margie Grogan continues to play plenty of
ice for him.</p>

<p>She goes to see him fight once, because everybody else in town is trying to
go, but Margie is pretty cute, and she can spot a tank job as far as anybody,
and while she knows very well that it is Spider McCoy and not Jonas who is
responsible for these half-gainers that are going on, she tells Spider that if
Jonas is not a big umbrella he will be fighting somebody who can really
fight.</p>

<p>'Over my dead body,' Spider says. 'If I ever hear of anybody that can really
fight trying to fight my Jonas, I will cause trouble. And Margie,' Spider says,
'do not call Jonas an umbrella in my presence. It hurts my feelings.'</p>

<p>But Jonas is a great disappointment to Spider in some respects, especially
about publicity angles. Spider wishes to get a tin crown made for him to wear
going into the ring, but Jonas will not listen to this, and what is more he
will not stand for as much as a monocle, because he claims he does not know how
to keep one in his eye.</p>

<p>Well, the dough is rolling in on Spider and Jonas just with tank acts, but
some of the boxing scribes are commencing to say Jonas ought to meet real
competition, and I tell Spider myself it may be a good idea to see if Jonas
really can fight.</p>

<p>'Yes,' Spider says, 'I am sometimes tempted myself. He shapes up so good
that I get to thinking maybe he is the makings, at that. But I think I will let
well enough alone.</p>

<p>'Anyway,' Spider says, 'what a sap I will be to throw him in with
competition as long as the suckers will pay to see him as he is. I can go on
with him indefinitely this way,' Spider says, 'but one smack on the chops may
finish us up for good. Yes,' he says, 'I think I will let well enough
alone.'</p>

<p>Now, one day a chunky guy with a big moustache and his hair cut short comes
to see Jonas and has a long talk with him, and Jonas tells Spider that this guy
is from his home country over in Europe, and that he is sent by the dictator
who runs Jonas off, and his cabinet, who wish Jonas to return home to talk to
them about certain matters, which may include a proposition for him to be king
again, and Jonas says it sounds like a fair sort of proposition, at that.</p>

<p>'Why,' Spider says, 'nobody can talk business with you now. I am your
manager, and all propositions must come to me first. Is there any chance of us
making any real dough out of your going back to being king?'</p>

<p>Well, Jonas says it is by no means definite that he is to be king again, but
that there is something in the air, and as he now has plenty of dough, and it
is safe for him to return, he wishes to go home a while if only to pick up a
few belongings that he does not have time to collect the last time he
departs.</p>

<p>Furthermore, nothing will do but Spider must go with him, and Spider says
this means Miss Margie Grogan will have to go, too, because she is practically
his right arm in business, and every other way, and Jonas says he thinks this
is an excellent idea. He says Margie looks to him as if a sea voyage will do
her good, and when Spider mentions this opinion to Margie, she says she wishes
the big umbrella will stop looking at her to see how she looks, but that she
will go just to spite him, and so they sail away.</p>

<p>Well, it is some months before I see Spider McCoy again, and then I run into
him on Broadway one afternoon, and he is all dressed up in striped pants, and
white spats, and a cut-away coat, and a high hat, and before I can start asking
questions he says to me like this:</p>

<p>'Come with me to number twenty-three,' he says. 'I am on a meet there with
somebody, and I will tell you all.' So from now on for a while this is Spider
McCoy's story:</p>

<p>Well [Spider says] we have a most satisfactory journey in every respect.
Going over on the boat, what happens what with the moon and the stars, and the
music, and dancing, and all this and that, but Margie and Jonas get so they are
on slightly better terms, and this makes things more pleasant for me, as they
are together quite a bit, and this gives me time to catch up on my drinking,
which I neglect no little when I am so busy looking after Jonas's
interests.</p>

<p>He gets a wonderful reception when we reach his old home country, what with
bands and soldiers, and one thing and another, but I am surprised to find that
none of the natives hear of me as his manager. In fact, it seems that his
reputation there rests entirely on once being king, and they never hear of his
accomplishments in the ring, which consist of eighteen consecutive k.o.'s. This
really hurts my feelings after all my work with him in the gym and the trouble
I go to in picking his opponents.</p>

<p>Personally, his country does not strike me as much of a country, and in fact
it strikes me as nothing but a sort of double Jersey City, and the natives
speak a language of their own, and the scenery is filled with high hills, and
take it all around, I do not consider it anything to get excited about, but it
is plain to be seen that Jonas is glad to get back there.</p>

<p>Well, we are not there more than a few hours before we get a line on what is
doing, and what is doing is that the people wish Jonas to be king again, and
they are making life a burden for this Dictator Poltafuss, and his cabinet, and
Poltafuss figures it will be a good scheme to put Jonas back, all right, but
first he wishes to discuss certain terms of his own with Jonas.</p>

<p>The very afternoon of the day we arrive there is a cabinet meeting in the
palace, which is a building quite similar to a county court-house, and Jonas is
invited to this meeting. They do not invite me, but naturally as Jonas's
manager, I insist on going to protect his interests, and in fact I consider it
quite unethical for them to be inviting my fighter to discuss terms of any kind
and not including me, and then Jonas requests Margie to also accompany him.</p>

<p>The cabinet meeting is in a big room with high windows overlooking a public
square and in this square a large number of natives of Jonas's country gather
while the meeting is in progress, and talk among themselves in their own
language.</p>

<p>There must be thirty characters of one kind and another sitting around a big
table when we enter the room, and I figure they are the cabinet, and it does
not take me long to pick Dictator Poltafuss. He is sitting at the head of the
table and he is wearing a uniform with about four pounds of medals on his
chest, and he has short black whiskers, and a fierce eye, and anybody can see
that he is built from the ground up.</p>

<p>He is as big as a Russian wrestler, and looks to me as if he may be a tough
character in every respect. A solid-looking Judy in a black dress is sitting in
a chair behind him with some knitting in her hands, and she does not seem to be
paying much attention to what is going on.</p>

<p>Well, as we enter the room and Jonas sees Poltafuss, a look comes into
Jonas's eyes that is without doubt the same look I sometimes see in the
gymnasium and in the ring, and which is the look that makes me wonder about him
and keeps me from ever putting him in without knowing his opponent's right name
and address, and, thinks I to myself, he is afraid of the guy with the
sassafras. Thinks I to myself, Margie is right He is a big umbrella.</p>

<p>Poltafuss begins talking very fast to Jonas, and in their own language, and
after he gets through, Jonas does a lot of talking in the same language, and
finally Jonas turns to us, and in our language he tells us what Poltafuss says
to him and what he says to Poltafuss, and what Poltafuss says is really
somewhat surprising.</p>

<p>'He says,' Jonas says, 'that I will be returned to the throne if I first
marry his sister. She is the chromo sitting behind him. I tell him she is older
than he is, and has a big nose, and a moustache.</p>

<p>He says,' Jonas says, 'that she is only a year older, which puts her shading
forty, and that a big horn indicates character, and a moustache is good
luck.</p>

<p>'Then,' Jonas says, 'I tell him the real reason I will not marry her, which
is because I am going to marry someone else.'</p>

<p>'Wait a minute, Jonas,' I say. 'You mustn't never tell a lie, even to be
king. You know you are not going to marry anybody. I do not permit my fighters
to marry,' I say. 'It takes their mind off their business.'</p>

<p>'Yes,' Jonas says, 'I am going to marry Miss Margie Grogan. We fix it up on
the ship.' Then all of a sudden Poltafuss jumps up and says to Margie in
English like this: 'Why,' he says, 'the idea is ridiculous. He cannot marry
you. He is of royal blood. You are of common stock,' he says. 'Look, Jonas,'
Margie says, 'are you going to stand here and hear me insulted? If you are, I
am leaving right now,' she says. Then she starts for the door, and Jonas runs
after her and grabs her by the arm and says:</p>

<p>'But, Margie,' he says, 'what can I do?'</p>

<p>'Well,' Margie says, 'you can boff this big ape for one thing, as any
gentleman is bound to do, unless,' she says, 'there is even more umbrella in
you than ever I suspect.'</p>

<p>'Why, yes,' Jonas says. 'To be sure, and certainly,' he says.</p>

<p>And with this he walks over to Poltafuss; but old Polty hears what Margie
says, and as Jonas gets near him, he lets go a big right hand that starts down
around China and bangs Jonas on the chin, and Jonas goes down.</p>

<p>Well, I thinks to myself, I am only glad this does not occur at the Garden
some night when the joint is packed. Then I hear Margie's voice saying like
this:</p>

<p>'Get up, Jonas,' Margie says. 'Get up and steady yourself.'</p>

<p>'It is no use, Margie,' I say. 'You are right, he is an umbrella.'</p>

<p>'You are a liar,' Margie says.</p>

<p>'Margie,' I say, 'remember you are speaking to your Uncle Spider.'</p>

<p>I am still thinking of how disrespectfully Margie addresses me, when I
notice that Jonas is up on his feet, and as he gets up he sticks out his left
in time to drive it through Poltafuss's whiskers, as Poltafuss rushes at him.
This halts Polty for an instant, then he comes on again swinging both hands. He
is strictly a wild thrower, but he hits like a steer kicking when he lands, and
he has Jonas down three times in as many minutes, and every time I figure Jonas
will remain there and doze off, but Margie says get up, and Jonas gets up, and
when he gets up he has sense enough to stick his left in Poltafuss's beard.</p>

<p>There seems to be some slight confusion among the members of the cabinet as
the contest opens, and I take a good strong grip on a big chair, just in case
of fire or flood, but I wish to say I never witness a finer spirit of fair play
than is exhibited by the members of the cabinet. They stand back against the
wall and give Jonas and Poltafuss plenty of elbow-room, and they seem to be
enjoying the affair no little. In fact, the only spectator present who does not
seem to be enjoying it is Poltafuss's sister, who does not get up out of her
chair to get a better view, and furthermore does not stop her knitting, so I
can see she is by no means a fight fan.</p>

<p>Pretty soon Jonas's left-hand sticking has Poltafuss's nose bleeding and
then one eye begins to close, and I find myself getting very much interested,
because I now see what I am looking for all my life, which is a dead game
heavy-weight, and I can see that I will no longer have to be worrying about who
I put Jonas in with. I see the next heavy-weight champion of the world as sure
as I am standing there, and I now begin coaching Jonas in person.</p>

<p>'Downstairs, Jonas,' I say. 'In the elly-bay, Jonas,' I say. So Jonas hits
Poltafuss a left hook in the stomach, and Polty goes oof.</p>

<p>'The old one-two, Jonas,' I say, and Jonas stabs Poltafuss's nose with a
long left, then follows through with a right cross, just as I educate him to
do, and this right-hand cross lands on Polty's chin, among the whiskers, and
down he goes as stiff as a board on his face, and when they fall in this
manner, you may proceed at once to the pay-off window.</p>

<p>The next thing I know, Margie is in Jonas's arms, dabbing at his bloody face
with a little handkerchief, and shedding tears, and a member of the cabinet
that I afterward learn is the secretary of war is at one of the windows yelling
down to the natives in the square and they are yelling back at him, and later
someone tells me that what he yells is that the king just flattens Poltafuss
and what they are yelling back is long live the king.</p>

<p>'Spider,' Jonas says, 'I never have any real confidence in myself before,
but I have now. I just lick the party who can lick any six guys in my country
all at once and with one hand tied behind him. Spider,' he says, 'I know now I
will be heavy-weight champ on of the world.'</p>

<p>Well, Poltafuss is sitting up on the floor holding his nose with both hands,
and looking somewhat dishevelled, but at this he puts his hands down long
enough to speak as follows:</p>

<p>'No,' he says, 'you will be king, and your sweetheart there will be
queen.'</p>

<p>And this is the way it turns out [Spider says] and Jonas and Poltafuss get
along very nicely indeed together afterward, except once at a cabinet meeting
when King Jonas has to flatten Poltafuss again to make him agree to some
unemployment measure.</p>

<p>'But, Spider,' I say, as Spider McCoy finishes his story, 'you do not state
what becomes of the dictator's sister.'</p>

<p>'Well,' Spider says, 'I will tell you. It seems to me that the dictator's
sister gets a rough deal, one way and another, especially,' he says, 'as her
beezer is by no means as big as some people think.</p>

<p>'So,' Spider says, 'while I will always regret blowing the next heavy-weight
champion of the world, I console myself with the thought that I get a wonderful
and ever-loving wife, and if you will wait a few minutes longer, I will
introduce you to the former Miss Sofia Poltafuss, now Mrs. Spider McCoy.'</p>

<h3><a name="For_a_Pal" id="For_a_Pal">For a Pal</a></h3>
<p>For a matter of maybe fifteen years or more, Little Yid and Blind Benny are
pals, and this is considered a very good thing for Benny because he is as blind
as a bat, and maybe blinder, while Yid can see as good as anybody and sometimes
better.</p>

<p>So Little Yid does the seeing for Benny, explaining in his own way to Benny
just what he sees, such as a horse race or a baseball game or a prize fight or
a play or a moving picture or anything else, for Yid and Blind Benny are great
hands for going around and about wherever anything is coming off, no matter
what, and up to the time this doll Mary Marble comes into their lives they are
as happy as two pups in a basket.</p>

<p>How Benny comes to go blind I do not know, and nobody else along Broadway
seems to know either, and in fact nobody cares, although I once hear Regret,
the horse player, say it is probably in sympathy with the judges at the race
track, Regret being such a guy as claims all these judges are very blind
indeed. But of course Regret is sore at these race-track judges because they
always call the wrong horse for him in the close finishes.</p>

<p>Little Yid tells me that Blind Benny is once a stick man in a gambling joint
in Denver, and a very good stick man, at that, and one night a fire comes off
in a flop house on Larimer Street, and Blind Benny, who is not blind at this
time, runs into the fire to haul out an old guy who has more smoke in him than
somewhat, and a rush of flames burns Benny's eyes so bad he loses his
sight.</p>

<p>Well, this may be the true story of how Benny comes to go blind, but I know
Little Yid likes Benny so much that he is not going to give Benny the worst of
any story he tells about him, and for all anybody knows maybe Benny really goes
into the fire to search for the old guy. Personally, I do not believe in taking
too much stock in any story you hear on Broadway about anything.</p>

<p>But there is no doubt about Blind Benny being blind. His eyelids are tacked
down tight over his eyes, and there is no chance that he is faking, because
many guys keep close tab on him for years and never catch him peeping once.</p>

<p>Furthermore, several guys send Benny to eye specialists at different times
to see if they can do anything about his eyes, and all these specialists say he
is one of the blindest guys they ever examine. Regret says maybe it is a good
thing, at that, because Benny is so smart as a blind guy that the chances are
if he can see he will be too smart to live.</p>

<p>He is especially smart when it comes to playing such games as pinochle. In
fact, Benny is about as good a single-handed pinochle player as there is in
this town, and there are many first-rate pinochle players in this town, if
anybody asks you.</p>

<p>Benny punches little holes in the cards so he can tell which is which by
feeling them, and the only way anybody can beat him is to cheat him, and it is
considered most discourteous to cheat a blind guy, especially as Benny is
always apt to catch a guy at cheating and put up an awful beef.</p>

<p>He is a tall, skinny guy with a thin face, and is by no means bad-looking,
while Little Yid is about knee high to a snake, and they look like a father and
his little boy as they go along the street with Little Yid hanging on to Blind
Benny's arm and giving him the right steer.</p>

<p>Of course it is by no means an uncommon thing on Broadway for citizens to
steer these blind guys across the street, although if the blind guys have any
sense they will keep their dukes on their tin cups while they are being
steered, but it is a most unusual proposition in this town for anybody to go
steering a blind guy around for fifteen years the way Little Yid steers Blind
Benny, as Blind Benny is a guy who takes plenty of steering.</p>

<p>In fact, one time Yid has to be away from business for a week, and he leaves
Blind Benny with a committee of guys, and every day one of these guys has to
steer Benny around wherever he wishes to go, which is wherever there is
anything going on, and Benny wears the whole committee plumb out before Yid
gets back, as Benny is certainly a guy who likes to go around and about.
Furthermore, he is so unhappy while Yid is away that he becomes a great
nuisance, because it seems that none of the committee can see things as good as
Yid for him, or explain them so he can understand them.</p>

<p>Personally, I will not care to have Little Yid do my seeing for me, even if
I am blind, because I listen to him telling what he sees to Blind Benny many
times, and it seems to me Little Yid is often somewhat cock-eyed in his
explanations.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I will hate to be explaining things to Blind Benny, because he
is always arguing about what is taking place, and giving you his opinions of
it, even though he cannot see. In fact, although he cannot see a lick, Blind
Benny is freer with his opinions than guys who can see from here to Europe.</p>

<p>It is a very interesting sight to watch Little Yid and Blind Benny at the
race track, for they are both great hands for playing the horses and, in fact,
Benny is a better handicapper than a lot of guys who have two good eyes and a
pair of spectacles to do their handicapping with.</p>

<p>At night they get the form sheet and sit up in their room with Yid reading
off the past performances and the time trials, and all this and that, and with
Blind Benny doping the horses from what Yid reads, and picking the ones he
figures ought to win the next day. They always have a big argument over each
horse, and Yid will tell Blind Benny he is daffy to be picking whatever horse
it is he picks, and Benny will tell Yid he is out of his mind to think anything
else can beat this horse, and they will holler and yell at each other for
hours.</p>

<p>But they always wind up very friendly, and they always play the horse Benny
picks, for Yid has much confidence in Benny's judgment, although he hollers and
yells at him more than somewhat when one of his picks loses. They sit up in the
grandstand during every race and Yid will explain to Benny what is doing in the
race, and generally he manages to mention that the horse they are betting on is
right up there and going easy, even though it may be laying back of the nine
ball, for Yid believes in making Blind Benny feel good at all times.</p>

<p>But when a horse they are betting on is really in the running, especially in
the stretch, Yid starts to root him home, and Benny roots right along with him
as if he can see, and rocks back and forth in his seat, and pounds with his
cane, and yells, 'Come on with him, Jock,' the same as anybody with two good
eyes.</p>

<p>I am telling you all this about Little Yid and Benny to show you that they
are very close friends indeed. They live together and eat together and argue
together, and nobody ever hears of a nicer friendship on Broadway, although
naturally some citizens figure for a while that one or the other must have some
angle in this friendship, as it is practically uncanny for a friendship to last
all these years on Broadway.</p>

<p>Blind Benny has some kind of an income from his people out West who are
sorry about him being blind, and Little Yid has a piece of a small factory run
by a couple of his brothers over in Hoboken where they make caps such as some
citizens wear on their heads, and it seems this factory does very well, and the
brothers are willing to send Little Yid his piece without him being around the
factory very much, as they do not seem to consider him any boost to a cap
factory.</p>

<p>So Yid and Blind Benny have all the money they need to go along, what with
making a little scratch now and then on the races, and they never seem to care
for any company but their own and are very happy and contented with each other.
In all the years they are together Yid is never known to more than say hello to
a doll, and of course Blind Benny cannot see dolls, anyway, which many citizens
claim is a great break for Benny, so Yid and Benny are carrying no weight in
this respect.</p>

<p>Now one night it seems that Ike Jacobs, the ticket spec, has a pair of
Chinese duckets on the opening of a new play by the name of Red Hot Love, a
Chinese ducket being a complimentary ducket that is punched full of holes like
Chinese money, and which you do not have to pay for, and Ike gives these
duckets to Little Yid and Blind Benny, which is considered very large-hearted
of Ike, at that.</p>

<p>So when the curtain goes up on Red Hot Love, Yid and Benny are squatted
right down in front among many well-known citizens who are all dressed up in
evening clothes, because this Red Hot Love has a bunch of swell actors in it,
and is expected to be first-class.</p>

<p>Naturally, when the play begins, Yid has to give Blind Benny a little
information about what is doing, otherwise Benny cannot appreciate the thing.
So Yid starts off in a whisper, but any time Yid starts explaining anything to
Benny he always winds up getting excited, and talking so loud you can hear him
down at the Battery.</p>

<p>Of course Blind Benny can follow the play as good as anybody if there is
plenty of gab on the stage, but he likes to know what actors are doing the
gabbing, and what they look like, and what the scenery looks like, and other
details that he cannot see, and Little Yid is telling him in such a voice as
causes some of the citizens around to say shush-shush. But Little Yid and Blind
Benny are accustomed to being shushed in theatres, so they do not pay much
attention.</p>

<p>Well, Red Hot Love is one of these problem plays, and neither Little Yid nor
Blind Benny can make much of it, although they are no worse off than anybody
else around them, at that. But Little Yid tries to explain to Blind Benny what
it is all about, and Benny speaks out loud as follows:</p>

<p>'It sounds to me like a rotten play.'</p>

<p>'Well,' Little Yid says, 'maybe the play is not so rotten, but the acting
is.'</p>

<p>There is much shushing from one and all around them, and the actors are
giving them the bad eye from the stage, because the actors can hear what they
say, and are very indignant, especially over this crack about acting.</p>

<p>Well, the next thing anybody knows down the aisle come a couple of big guys
who put the arm on Little Yid and Blind Benny and give them the old heave-o out
of the joint, as you are not supposed to speak out loud in a theatre about any
bad acting that is going on there, no matter how bad it is.</p>

<p>Anyway, as Little Yid and Blind Benny are being prodded up the aisle by the
big guys, Blind Benny states as follows:</p>

<p>'I still claim,' he says, 'that it sounds like a rotten play.'</p>

<p>'Well,' Little Yid says, 'the acting certainly is.'</p>

<p>There is much applause as Yid and Benny are getting the heave-o, and many
citizens claim it is because the customers are glad to see them heaved, but
afterward it comes out that what many of the customers are really applauding is
the statements by Little Yid and Benny.</p>

<p>Well, Yid and Benny do not mind getting the heave-o so much, as they are
heaved out of many better theatres than this in their time, but they are very
indignant when the box office refuses to give them back the admission price,
although of course their duckets do not cost them anything in the first place
and they are a little out of line in trying to collect.</p>

<p>They are standing on the sidewalk saying what an outrage it is when all of a
sudden out of the theatre pops this doll by the name of Mary Marble, and her
face is very red, and she is also very indignant, because it seems that in the
second act of the play there are some very coarse cracks led out on the stage,
and it seems that Mary Marble is such a doll as believes that cracks of this
nature are only fit for married people to hear, and she is by no means
married.</p>

<p>Of course Little Yid and Blind Benny do not know at the time that she is
Mary Marble, and in fact they do not know her from Adam's off ox as she marches
up to them and speaks as follows:</p>

<p>'Gentlemen,' she says, 'I wish to compliment you on your judgment of the
affair inside. I hear what you say as you are getting ejected,' she says, 'and
I wish to state that you are both right. It is a rotten play, and the acting is
rotten.'</p>

<p>Now off this meeting, what happens but Mary Marble gets to going around with
Little Yid and Blind Benny whenever she can spare time from her job, which is
managing a little joint on Broadway where they sell stockings such as dolls
wear on their legs, except in summer-time, although even when they wear these
stockings you cannot tell if a doll has anything on her legs unless you pinch
them, the stockings that dolls wear nowadays being very thin, indeed.</p>

<p>Furthermore, whenever she is with them, it is now Mary Marble who does most
of the explaining to Blind Benny of what is going on, because Mary Marble is
such a doll as is just naturally bound to do all the explaining necessary when
she is around.</p>

<p>When it comes to looks, Mary Marble is practically no dice. In fact, if she
is not the homeliest doll on Broadway, I will guarantee she is no worse than a
dead-heat with the homeliest. She has a large beezer and large feet, and her
shape is nothing whatever to speak of, and Regret, the horse player, says they
never need to be afraid of entering Mary Marble in a claiming race at any
price. But of course Regret is such a guy as will not give you a counterfeit
dime for any doll, no matter what she looks like.</p>

<p>Mary Marble is maybe twenty-five years old--although Regret says he will lay
6 to 5 against her being any better than twenty-eight--and about all she has
running for her, anyway you take her, is a voice that is soft and gentle and
very nice, indeed, except that she is fond of using it more than somewhat.</p>

<p>She comes from a little town over in Pennsylvania, and is pretty well
educated, and there is no doubt whatever that she is unusually respectable,
because such a looking doll as Mary Marble has no excuse for being anything but
respectable on Broadway. In fact, Mary Marble is so respectable that many
citizens figure there must be an angle, but it is agreed by one and all that
she is perfectly safe with Little Yid and Blind Benny, no matter what.</p>

<p>And now at night instead of always doping the horse, Little Yid and Blind
Benny will often sit up in their room talking about nothing much but Mary
Marble, and Benny asks Yid a million questions over and over again.</p>

<p>'Tell me, Yid,' Blind Benny will say, 'what does Mary look like?'</p>

<p>'She is beautiful,' Yid always says.</p>

<p>Well, of course, this is practically perjury, and many citizens figure that
Yid tells Blind Benny this very large lie because he has an idea Benny wishes
to hear only the best about Mary Marble, although it comes out afterward that
Little Yid thinks Mary Marble beautiful, at that.</p>

<p>'She is like an angel,' he says.</p>

<p>'Yes, yes,' Blind Benny says, 'tell me more.'</p>

<p>And Little Yid keeps on telling him, and if Mary Marble is only one-eighth
as good-looking as Yid tells, Ziegfeld and Georgie White and Earl Carroll will
be breaking each other's legs trying to get to her first.</p>

<p>'Well,' Blind Benny often says, after Little Yid gets through telling him
about Mary Marble, 'she is just as I picture her to myself, Yid,' he says. 'I
never care so much about not being able to see until now, and even now all I
wish to see is Mary.'</p>

<p>The idea seems to be that Blind Benny is in love with Mary Marble, and the
way Little Yid is always boosting her it is no wonder. In fact, the chances are
a lot of other citizens will be in love with Mary Marble if they listen to Yid
telling Blind Benny about her, and never get a gander at her personally.</p>

<p>But Blind Benny does not mention right out that he is in love with Mary
Marble, and it may be that he does not really know what is eating him, which is
often the case with guys who are in love. All Blind Benny knows is that he
likes to be with Mary Marble and to listen to her explaining things to him,
and, what is more, Mary Marble seems to like to be with Blind Benny, and to
explain things to him, although as far as this goes Mary Marble is such a doll
as likes to be explaining things to anybody any time she gets a chance.</p>

<p>Now Little Yid and Blind Benny are still an entry at all times, even when
Mary Marble is with them, but many citizens see that Little Yid is getting all
sorrowed up, and they figure it is because he feels Blind Benny is gradually
drifting away from him after all these years, and everybody sympathises with
Little Yid no little, and there is some talk of getting him another blind guy
to steer around in case Blind Benny finally leaves him for good.</p>

<p>Then it comes on a Saturday night when Little Yid says he must go over to
Hoboken to see his brothers about the cap business and, as Mary Marble has to
work in the stocking joint Saturday nights, Little Yid asks Blind Benny to go
with him.</p>

<p>Of course Blind Benny does not care two cents about the cap business, but
Little Yid explains to him that he knows a Dutchman's in Hoboken where there is
some very nice real beer, and if there is one thing Blind Benny likes more than
somewhat it is nice real beer, especially as it seems that since they become
acquainted with Mary Marble he seldom gets nice real beer, as Mary Marble is a
terrible knocker against such matters as nice real beer.</p>

<p>So they start for Hoboken, and Little Yid sees his brothers about the cap
business, and then he takes Blind Benny to a Dutchman's to get the nice real
beer, only it turns out that the beer is not real, and by no means nice, being
all needled up with alky, and full of headaches, and one thing and another. But
of course Little Yid and Blind Benny are not going around complaining about
beer even if it is needled, as, after all, needled beer is better than no beer
whatever.</p>

<p>They sit around the Dutchman's quite a while, although it turns out that the
Dutchman is nothing but a Polack, and then they nab a late ferryboat for home,
as Little Yid says he wishes to ride on a ferryboat to get the breeze. As far
as Blind Benny is concerned, he does not care how they go as long as he can get
back to New York to meet up with Mary Marble when she is through work.</p>

<p>There are not many citizens on the ferryboat with them, because it is
getting on towards midnight, and at such an hour anybody who lives in Jersey is
home in bed. In fact, there are not over four or five other passengers on the
ferryboat with Little Yid and Blind Benny, and these passengers are all dozing
on the benches in the smoking-room with their legs stuck out in front of
them.</p>

<p>Now if you know anything about a ferryboat you know that they always hook
big gates across each end of such a boat to keep automobiles and trucks and
citizens and one thing and another from going off these ends into the water
when the ferryboat is travelling back and forth, as naturally it will be a
great nuisance to other boats in the river to have things falling off the
ferryboats and clogging up the stream.</p>

<p>Well, Little Yid is away out on the end of the ferryboat up against the gate
enjoying the breeze, and Blind Benny is leaning against the rail just outside
the smoking-room door where Little Yid plants him when they get on the boat,
and Blind Benny is smoking a big heater that he gets at the Dutchman's and
maybe thinking of Mary Marble, when all of a sudden Little Yid yells like
this:</p>

<p>'Oh, Benny,' he yells, 'come here.'</p>

<p>Naturally Benny turns and goes in the direction of the voice and Little
Yid's voice comes from the stern, and Blind Benny keeps following his beezer in
the direction of the voice, expecting to feel Little Yid's hand stopping him
any minute, and the next thing he knows he is walking right off the ferryboat
into the river.</p>

<p>Of course Blind Benny cannot continue walking after he hits the water, so he
sinks at once, making a sound like glug-glug as he goes down. It is in the fall
of the year, and the water is by no means warm, so as Benny comes up for air he
naturally lets out a loud squawk, but by this time the ferryboat is quite some
jumps away from him, and nobody seems to see him, or even hear him.</p>

<p>Now Blind Benny cannot swim a lick, so he sinks again with a glug-glug. He
comes up once more, and this time he does not squawk so loud, but he sings out,
very distinct, as follows: 'Goodbye, Pal Yid.'</p>

<p>All of a sudden there is quite a splash in the water near the ferryboat, and
Little Yid is swimming for Blind Benny so fast the chances are he will make a
sucker of Johnny Weissmuller if Johnny happens to be around, for Little Yid is
a regular goldfish when it comes to water, although he is not much of a hand
for going swimming without provocation.</p>

<p>He has to dive for Blind Benny, for by this time Blind Benny is going down
for the third time, and everybody knows that a guy is only allowed three downs
when he is drowning. In fact, Blind Benny is almost down where the crabs live
before Little Yid can get a fistful of his collar. At first Little Yid's idea
is to take Blind Benny by the hair, but he remembers in time that Benny does
not have much hair, so he compromises on the collar.</p>

<p>And being a little guy, Yid has quite a job getting Benny to the top and
keeping him there. By this time the ferryboat is almost at its dock on the New
York side, and nobody on board seems to realize that it is shy a couple of
passengers, although of course the ferryboat company is not going to worry
about that as it collects the fares in advance.</p>

<p>But it is a pretty lucky break for Little Yid and Blind Benny that a tugboat
happens along and picks them up, or Yid may be swimming around the North River
to this day with Blind Benny by the nape of the neck going glug-glug.</p>

<p>The captain of the tugboat is a kind old guy with whiskers by the name of
Deusenberg, and he is very sorry indeed to see them in such a situation, so
after he hauls them on board the tugboat, and spreads them out on bunks to let
them dry, he throws a couple of slugs of gin into Little Yid and Blind Benny,
it being gin of such a nature that they are half sorry they do not go ahead and
drown before they meet up with it.</p>

<p>Then the captain unloads them at Forty-second Street on the New York side,
and by this time, between the water and the gin, Blind Benny is very much
fagged out, indeed, and in bad shape generally, so Little Yid puts him in a cab
and takes him to a hospital.</p>

<p>Well, for several days Blind Benny is not better than even money to get
well, because after they get the water out of him they still have to contend
with the gin, and Mary Marble is around carrying on quite some, and saying she
does not see how Little Yid can be so careless as to let Benny walk off the end
of a ferryboat when there are gates to prevent such a thing, or how he can let
Benny drink tugboat gin, and many citizens do not see either, especially about
the gin.</p>

<p>As for Little Yid, he is looking very sad, and is at the hospital at all
times, and finally, one day when Blind Benny is feeling all right again, Little
Yid sits down beside his bed, and speaks to him as follows:</p>

<p>'Benny,' Little Yid says, 'I will now make a confession to you, and I will
then go away somewhere and knock myself off. Benny,' he says, 'I let you fall
into the river on purpose. In fact,' Little Yid says, 'I unhook the gate across
the passageway and call you, figuring you will follow the sound of my voice and
walk on off the boat into the water.</p>

<p>'I am very sorry about this,' Little Yid says, 'but, Benny,' he says, 'I
love Mary Marble more than somewhat, although I never before mention this to a
soul. Not even to Mary Marble, because,' Little Yid says, 'I know she loves
you, as you love her. I love her,' Little Yid says, 'from the night we first
meet, and this love winds up by making me a little daffy.</p>

<p>'I get to thinking,' Little Yid says, 'that with you out of the way Mary
Marble will turn to me and love me instead. But,' he says, starting to shed
large tears, 'when I hear your voice from the water saying "Good-bye, Pal Yid,"
my heart begins to break, and I must jump in after you. So now you know, and I
will go away and shoot myself through the head if I can find somebody to lend
me a Roscoe, because I am no good.'</p>

<p>'Why,' Blind Benny says, 'Pal Yid, what you tell me about leading me into
the river is no news to me. In fact,' he says, 'I know it the minute I hit the
water because, although I am blind, I see many things as I am going down, and I
see very plain that you must do this thing on purpose, because I know you are
close enough around to grab me if you wish.</p>

<p>'I know, of course,' Blind Benny says, 'that there is bound to be a gate
across the end of the boat because I often fix this gate when we are leaving
Hoboken. So,' he says, 'I see that you must unhook this gate. I see that for
some reason you wish to knock me off, although I do not see the reason, and the
chances are I will never see it unless you tell me now, so I do not put up more
of a holler and maybe attract the attention of the other guys on the boat. I am
willing to let it all go as it lays.'</p>

<p>'My goodness,' Little Yid says, 'this is most surprising to me, indeed. In
fact,' he says, 'I scarcely know what to say, Benny. In fact,' he says, 'I
cannot figure out why you are willing to go without putting up a very large
beef.'</p>

<p>'Well, Pal Yid,' Benny says, reaching out and taking Little Yid by the hand,
'I am so fond of you that I figure if my being dead is going to do you any
good, I am willing to die, even though I do not know why. Although,' Benny
says, 'it seems to me you can think up a nicer way of scragging me than by
drowning, because you know I loathe and despise water. Now then,' he says, 'as
for Mary Marble, if you--'</p>

<p>But Little Yid never lets Blind Benny finish this, because he cuts in and
speaks as follows:</p>

<p>'Benny,' he says, 'if you are willing to die for me, I can certainly afford
to give up a doll for you, especially,' he says, 'as my people tell me only
yesterday that if I marry anybody who is not of my religion, which is slightly
Jewish, they will chop me off at the pants' pocket. You take Mary Marble,' he
says, 'and I will stake you to my blessing, and maybe a wedding present.'</p>

<p>So the upshot of the whole business is Mary Marble is now Mrs. Blind Benny,
and Blind Benny seems to be very happy, indeed, although some citizens claim
the explanations he gets nowadays of whatever is going on are much shorter than
when he is with Little Yid, while Little Yid is over in Hoboken in the cap
racket with his brothers, and he never sees Blind Benny any more, as Mary
Marble still holds the gin against him.</p>

<p>Personally, I always consider Little Yid's conduct in this matter very
self-sacrificing, and furthermore I consider him a very great hero for rescuing
Blind Benny from the river, and I am saying as much only the other day to
Regret the horse player.</p>

<p>'Yes,' Regret says, 'it sounds very self-sacrificing, indeed, and maybe
Little Yid is a hero, at that, but,' Regret says, 'many citizens are
criticizing him no little for sawing off such a crow as Mary Marble on a poor
blind guy.'</p>

<h3><a name="Big_Shoulders" id="Big_Shoulders">Big Shoulders</a></h3>
<p>One night I am sitting in Mindy's Restaurant on Broadway partaking of some
delicious gefüllte fish when a very beautiful young Judy comes in and sits down
at my table and starts in sobbing as if her little heart will break.</p>

<p>I am about to call a waiter and have her chucked out of the place as her
sobbing interferes with my enjoyment of the gefüllte fish, when I observe that
she is nobody but Zelma Bodinski, the daughter of BIooch Bodinski, a character
who is well known to one and all along Broadway as a small operator in betting
matters.</p>

<p>Well, every time I see Zelma Bodinski, she always makes me think I am
looking at a ghost, because she is a dead ringer for her mama, Zelma O'Dare,
who once does a hot wiggle in the old Garden Cafe on Seventh Avenue a matter of
some twenty-odd years back, and who confirms a general suspicion that she is
none too bright by marrying Blooch Bodinski and going to live in the Bronx.</p>

<p>However, as near as anybody can figure out, they get along together pretty
well down through the years, because all Zelma O'Dare ever says is yes and no,
and this is enough for Blooch, who does not understand many longer words,
anyway, and when Zelma finally dies of influenza, she leaves him this daughter,
who looks so much like her the chances are Blooch never misses the
original.</p>

<p>This Blooch Bodinski is a short, fat, scary-looking little character who
wears a derby hat and loud clothes when he marries Zelma O'Dare, and who always
has a sad expression, and he does not change much in appearance as he grows
older, except maybe to look sadder.</p>

<p>He comes up out of Essex Street to Broadway, and he does this and that, and
one thing and another, to make a living, until finally he gets to taking bets
on prize fights and baseball games, and scalping the bets. That is, if somebody
gives Blooch a bet on a proposition, right away he hustles around and gets
somebody else to take it off his hands, generally at a shade better price than
Blooch gives in the first place.</p>

<p>Besides, he knocks off five per cent on a winning bet as his commission for
his trouble, so he really is nothing but a sort of middleman, or broker, though
what he calls himself is a betting commissioner. He never risks anything on his
own account, no matter what, because Blooch is a very careful character by
nature, and about as loose as concrete with his money.</p>

<p>So it gets around that you can always place a bet on almost any proposition
through Blooch Bodinski, and that he is an honest character and always pays
off, and by and by Blooch opens an office and goes grinding and chiselling
along in a modest way for quite a spell, making a few dibs here and there, and
having Zelma O'Dare stash them away in a jug uptown against a rainy day.</p>

<p>I hear Blooch has quite a package planted when the jug fails and he is
knocked out and has to start all over again, and there is a rumour around and
about that things are none too good for Blooch at the time I am speaking of. He
still has his office, and his credit remains A1 with the trade all over the
country, and anybody will accept a commission from Blooch because they know he
never offers any bets he cannot guarantee, but the trouble is most of his old
customers are also pretty well out of money, and new customers are scarce.</p>

<p>Anyway, here is Blooch Bodinski's daughter sobbing in Mindy's Restaurant, so
naturally I ask her what ails her, and Zelma looks at me out of her big, black,
wet eyes that are blacker than ever, what with the tears making the mascara
run, and she says to me like this:</p>

<p>'It is Poppa,' she says. 'Poppa wishes me to marry Jake Applebaum, the
druggist, and I hate druggists, especially when they are Jake Applebaum. Poppa
wishes me to marry Jake because he owes Jake ten thousand dollars borrowed
money, and Jake is getting tough about it.'</p>

<p>'Jake Applebaum already has ten thousand dollars,' I say. 'Twice,' I say.
'Maybe five or ten times. Jake Applebaum is fatter than a goose when it comes
to money. Besides,' I say, 'Jake Applebaum is not hard to take. He is by no
means bad-looking. He has a kind heart, unless you are asking him for dough. In
fact, somebody tells me that you and Jake are almost an entry.'</p>

<p>'Yes,' she says, 'I promised to marry him six months back. This is why he
lends Poppa the ten thousand, which Poppa needs for the overhead. Up to
yesterday, I practically love Jake Applebaum. Then I meet Charley.'</p>

<p>Well, I do not ask her Charley who, as I figure it may be one of those
knock-knock things, and anyway, I can see that if I just let her talk I will
get the whole story. I am thinking of the difference between her and her mama,
Zelma O'Dare, who never makes a longer speech than to say she will have another
rye high, but who foals a chatter-box.</p>

<p>'Charley is a Yale,' Zelma says. 'He is very handsome and full of fun and
not like Jake Applebaum, who only thinks of betting on something when he is not
thinking of his drugstore.'</p>

<p>'Jake makes a nice bet, at that,' I say. 'But where do you meet this Charley
and what happens?'</p>

<p>'He comes into Poppa's office yesterday,' Zelma says. 'You know I am working
in Poppa's office since last summer because Poppa cannot afford a regular
office girl just now. I wish you could see his eyes. They are blue-grey. I am
glad the baseball season is over because I get sick and tired of sitting there
all day long telephoning bets on the Giants and the Yankees and the Cubs and
Joe Louis, to Brad Cross in Fort Worth, and Dutch Ambrose in Omaha, and Izzy
Harter in Indianapolis. They get awfully fresh with you. I mean the people in
Izzy Harter's office.'</p>

<p>'You are speaking of Charley's eyes,' I say.</p>

<p>'Oh, yes,' Zelma says. 'He wishes to make a small bet on the Yales to beat
the Princetons to-morrow. Somebody sends him to Poppa's office thinking we take
football bets. Poppa is not there, so he talks to me. I tell him we not only do
not take football bets but that it makes Poppa mad to even mention them,
because he thinks football is silly. Poppa says football is nothing but a lot
of big shoulders, and zing-boom-bah, and that anybody who bets on such a matter
is a sucker.</p>

<p>'Well,' Zelma says, 'Charley says Poppa is wrong, and that he is making a
big mistake not to take football bets. He says football is the coming
big-betting proposition of this country. He talks to me four hours. He is a
poor boy and works his way through college. This is his last year. He says I
look like Mona Lisa, and he likes my shape.'</p>

<p>'Well,' I say, 'the bloke is no chump about some things, anyway, although I
cannot say much for his idea of betting on the Yales to beat the Princetons.
The Princetons are one-to-four favourites in the betting.'</p>

<p>'Yes,' Zelma says, 'Charley says it is a wonderful opportunity for everybody
to get rich betting on the Yales. He says he is only sorry he does not have
more than ten dollars to bet on them. He says they cannot possibly lose. He
says he personally dopes the game for the Yales to win. I ask him if he is
certain, and he crosses his heart and hopes to die if it is not the truth. I am
going to tell Poppa about it as soon as I get back to the office. Just think,'
Zelma says, 'Poppa can win enough money on this game to pay Jake Applebaum back
and then give me some so Charley and I can get married and go into
business.'</p>

<p>'Just a minute,' I say. 'Does Charley ask you to marry him already?' 'Why,
sure,' Zelma says. 'Do I not tell you we talk four hours? What else is there to
talk about so long? He goes on to Princeton to the game, and he is coming back
here as soon as he can and take me to dinner. He plays substitute in the game,
and he simply has to be there. But now I must go back to the office and tell
Poppa what a wonderful opportunity this is for him.'</p>

<p>Well, I figure that listening to Blooch Bodinski when he is propositioned to
bet his own money on something, and especially a football game, will make
Broadway history, so I tell Zelma I wish to see her papa about a little
business matter, and I go with her to Blooch's office, which at this time is a
rat-hole in an old building in West Forty-ninth Street, with just a desk and a
couple of chairs and only one telephone in it, and as we come in, Blooch is
slamming the receiver back on the hook and talking out loud to himself.</p>

<p>'Big shoulders!' Blooch is saying to himself. 'Zing-boom-bah, eight to
five.' Then he sees me, and he says to me like this: 'Baseball, yes,' Blooch
says. 'Prize fights, yes. Hockey, yes. Elections, yes. Big shoulders, no. Fifty
times a day they call asking for prices on Mr. Minnesota, or Mr. Wisconsin, or
somebody. I am about crazy. What do I know about prices on the big
shoulders?'</p>

<p>'Why, Poppa,' Zelma says, 'Charley says it is your duty to hire college
parties who can handicap the games for you, and get out your own prices and
make your own book. Charley says most of the betting figures on the football
games are a joke, and that if he is in the business he can get rich taking bets
at his own prices and then catching the other fellows out of line and laying
the bets off to them at their odds.'</p>

<p>Well, Blooch Bodinski looks at her for a minute without saying a word, and
Zelma goes right ahead as follows:</p>

<p>'Charley says football betting is in its infancy,' she says. 'But the big
thing is about the Yales to-morrow,' she says. 'Charley says they cannot
possibly lose to the Princetons, and you can make yourself well off for life by
betting on them.'</p>

<p>'Charley?' Blooch says. 'Charley what?'</p>

<p>At this Zelma pauses to think, but she is never much of a hand at thinking,
just like her mama, Zelma O'Dare, so she soon gives it up and says like this:
'I forget what,' she says. 'Maybe he never tells me. Anyway, you are to bet on
the Yales. Charley says they are like wheat in the bin.'</p>

<p>Well, Blooch finally shakes his head and looks at me and says:</p>

<p>'Yes, I am crazy. The big shoulders get me at last. What are the Yales?' he
says.</p>

<p>'They are four to one,' I say.</p>

<p>Well, at this, Blooch drops his head on the desk and groans, and I can see
that he is overcome at the idea that anybody in this whole world thinks he will
bet on a 4-to-l shot, but Zelma pays no attention to him and goes right on
gabbing.</p>

<p>'Charley says college football and Presidential elections are the only
things it is safe to bet on,' she says. 'Charley says they are the only
propositions that give you a dead-square rattle. Charley says nobody can cheat
you in college football or Presidential elections.'</p>

<p>Blooch raises his head and sits there looking at her as if he never sees her
before in his life, and moreover he acts as if he does not hear a word she says
for a while. But finally, when Zelma has to stop for breath, he holds up one
hand to keep her from starting off again and says like this:</p>

<p>'My own daughter,' he says, 'she wishes me to bet my own dough on something.
The whole world is crazy. Listen,' Blooch says. 'For nearly thirty years I
grind along in this town and never do I risk a single dib of my own on a bet. I
take it off the top, or I take it off the bottom. Always something for nothing
is my motto. And if ever I do bet it will not be on the big shoulders, and what
is more, Jake Applebaum is in here a little while ago about you standing him up
last night, so,' Blooch says, 'never you mind about somebody called
Charley.'</p>

<p>'He loves me,' Zelma says.</p>

<p>'So he tells me,' Blooch says.</p>

<p>'I mean Charley loves me,' Zelma says.</p>

<p>Then all of a sudden Zelma begins sobbing again, and I wish to say that when
it comes to a job of sobbing she is much better than a raw hand, and between
sobs she says she works hard all summer in this dirty old office, taking the
insults of people over the telephone, and she never gets to go anywhere or see
anything, and she wishes she is dead, and if her poppa loves her as he claims
he does, he will take her to see the Yales and the Princetons play, even if he
refuses a chance to bet on an absolutely sure thing like the Yales.</p>

<p>Well, I can see that these tears make Blooch Bodinski very uneasy, and he
says there, there, and now, now, and my, my to Zelma, but she only sobs all the
harder, and says for two cents she will pitch herself off the new Tri-Boro
bridge, and finally Blooch is almost crying himself, and he pats Zelma on the
head with his hand and says to her like this:</p>

<p>'Why,' Blooch says, 'I remember hearing Jake Applebaum say he is going to
this very game, and I know he will be glad to take you. I will call Jake up at
once if you will just stop crying.'</p>

<p>Now I claim Zelma is sobbing right up there around the record from the
beginning, but when Blooch says this she turns on a notch higher and says it
shows her that her poppa does not love her at all to wish to shove her off on
Jake Applebaum when she has only one desire in the world and this is to be with
her only parent, so finally Blooch says all right, he will go around to Jack's
ticket office and see if he can buy some tickets to the game, on condition that
I go along.</p>

<p>Well, naturally, Zelma has no reason to bar me, so there we are the next
morning taking a special train to Princeton, and I remember seeing Jake
Applebaum at a distance in the Pennsylvania Station before we start, but he
does not see us, and I also remember that Zelma seems to manoeuvre us around so
we do not make the same train that Jake does, or connect with him when we hit
Princeton.</p>

<p>Blooch dozes most of the way, because it seems he is awake most of the night
worrying about the way Zelma is acting towards Jake Applebaum, and I sit in a
seat with Zelma and listen to her talk about Charley. I also listen to what
some of the other characters in our Pullman are saying, and although most of
them seem to be Yales, I judge that they figure this game is just a breeze for
the Princetons, and I say as much to Zelma.</p>

<p>'No,' she says, 'they are wrong. Charley says the Yales are a cinch. Charley
says the handicapping of football teams so you can determine the winner of a
game is an exact science and not mere guesswork as many people may think, and,'
Zelma says, 'Charley says he applies scientific methods to handicapping this
game, and he makes it close but certain for the Yales.'</p>

<p>She places so much faith in what Charley says that I am wondering if maybe I
am making a mistake in not taking advantage of the price, for if there is
anything I dearly love it is a long shot, and in football 4 to 1 is a very long
shot indeed, and they do not often get down there in front. Then I remember
that some handicappers who are maybe about as smart as Charley make this price,
so I decide I am just as well off keeping my dough in my kick, although I do
not speak of this to Zelma.</p>

<p>Blooch wakes up when our special pulls into Princeton, and we get off and
start walking to the football yard with the rest of the crowd, and I am
thinking that these scenes must be quite a novelty to him, when we pass a bunch
of characters who are offering to buy or sell tickets to the game, and who are
what is known as ticket hustlers, and a couple of old characters among them
give Blooch a blow, and he stops to talk to them. When he joins us again,
Blooch is smiling, and he says to me like this:</p>

<p>'I hustle duckets with those parties among these same crowds over twenty
years ago,' he says. 'They remember old Blooch. I am a champion in those days,
too.'</p>

<p>He livens up quite some after this and begins taking an interest in his
surroundings and talking about the good old days, but as near as I can make
out, Blooch's good old days are about the same as everybody else's good old
days, and most of the time he is half starving.</p>

<p>Well, by this time Zelma is paying no attention whatever to us, but is
looking all around and about, and I can see that she is hoping she may get a
swivel at Charley, but naturally he is not to be seen, so she does the next
best thing and takes to looking at other young characters who are quite
numerous all over the place, and they look right back at her, if anybody asks
you, and personally I do not blame them. She is the prettiest thing that ever
steps in shoe leather this particular day, what with her eyes shining, and her
cheeks red with excitement, and all this and that.</p>

<p>Our seats in the football stadium are not so good because they are right
behind the goal-posts at one end of the field, and close to the ground, and we
are not able to see a whole lot of the game, especially when the ball is in the
middle of the field or down towards the other end, and Zelma is disappointed no
little and Blooch is saying he will see Jack when he gets home about this, but
personally I do not care where we are as long as we are at a football game,
because football is one of my favourite dishes. Even Blooch partakes of the
general excitement when we get settled down, and the bands play, and the young
characters in the stands begin letting out cheers.</p>

<p>Zelma keeps watching the Yales' bench trying to locate Charley, but we are
too far away for her to see good, and anyway, the game gets going and takes her
attention, especially as right away the Princetons start running all over the
Yales in a most disquieting manner.</p>

<p>I can see in about two plays why the Princetons are 1-to-4 favourites, and I
say to Zelma like this:</p>

<p>'I am afraid Charley is wrong,' I say. 'This looks as if it may be
murder.'</p>

<p>'Never fear,' Zelma says. 'Charley gives me his word the Yales will
win.'</p>

<p>'Where are the big shoulders?' Blooch says. 'These parties are a lot of
midgets.'</p>

<p>Well, all of a sudden the Yales commence playing better football, and
instead of running over them, the Princetons now have a tough time keeping from
getting run over themselves, and the game goes this way and that way, and
nothing happens in the way of a score, and the Yales in the stands are in quite
a hubbub, and are singing Boola-boola and I do not know what all else, and
Zelma is jumping up and down and shrieking, 'Charley is right!'</p>

<p>All the time she is trying to locate Charley on the field or on the side
lines, but there seems to be no Charley, and I am commencing to wonder if some
character does not play a joke on her.</p>

<p>She is somewhat downhearted when the second half starts and Charley remains
invisible, although she is still confident that the Yales will win. Personally,
I figure a tie is about the answer.</p>

<p>Well, it is getting on towards the end of the game, and the goal in front of
us belongs at this time to the Princetons, and the Yales start a march that
winds up with them losing the ball on downs on the Princetons' one-inch line,
and everybody is half insane, especially Zelma, and even Blooch Bodinski is
saying out loud to the Yales: 'Come on, big shoulders!'</p>

<p>But it is no go, and it is coming on dark when the Yales lose the ball, and
one of the Yales gets hurt on the last play, and there is a substitution, and
when they line up again one of the Princetons goes back behind his own goal to
kick out of danger, and he is standing just a short distance from where we are
sitting waiting for the pass.</p>

<p>Then, just as the ball is flipped to the Princeton back of the line, Zelma
Bodinski lets out a shriek like a steam whistle, because it seems that she just
spots the last Yale substitute, and she screams as follows: 'Char-lee!'</p>

<p>Well, afterward I read what the reporters say about the darkness and the
slippery ball and all this and that, but it seems to me that I see the
Princeton character back of the line jump at the scream and half turn his head,
and the next thing anybody knows he drops the football out of his hands, and
then as all the Yales are coming at him, he falls on it behind his own goal for
what is called a safety, and this means two points against the Princetons.</p>

<p>And a few seconds later the whistle blows, and there the Princetons are,
licked by the Yales by a score of two to nothing, which is very discouraging to
the Princetons, to be sure. Naturally, there are some great goings-on over this
business among the Yales, and nobody is more delighted than Zelma Bodinski, and
I hear her saying to Blooch like this:</p>

<p>'Well,' Zelma says, 'now everything is all right. Jake Applebaum is paid
off, and we have all the money we need. I am glad, because it proves Charley is
right.'</p>

<p>'What do you mean Jake Applebaum is paid off?' Blooch says. 'And what do you
mean we have all the money we need? If you do not marry Jake, we will be on
relief in a month.'</p>

<p>'Oh,' Zelma says, 'I forget to tell you. This morning before we leave New
York, I go to the office and call up Dutch Ambrose and Brad Cross and Izzy
Harter and bet them two thousand dollars each in your name on Yale at four to
one. Then I happen to have a date with Jake Applebaum the night before, and I
tell him you have a commission of two thousand dollars from out of town to
place on the Yales at the best price you can get, and Jake says he will lay
five to one, because it is just the same as finding the two thousand in the
street.</p>

<p>'So,' Zelma says, 'we pay off Jake and win twenty-four thousand in cash.
Even if we lose,' she says, 'the most we can lose is eight thousand dollars,
but I know that Charley says there is no chance of our losing. I will always
believe Charley all my life, no matter what.'</p>

<p>Well, Blooch stands there as if he is thinking this over, and there is a
very strange expression on his face, and about this time who comes up but Jake
Applebaum, and it is plain to be seen that Jake is very angry, and he shakes
his finger in Zelma Bodinski's beautiful face and says to her like this:</p>

<p>'See here,' Jake says. 'I hear all about you this morning when I am at
breakfast in Mindy's. I hear all about you being in love with a Yale by the
name of Charley, and now I know why you are jerking me around. But do not
forget your old man owes me plenty, and I will make him hard to catch.'</p>

<p>Naturally, Jake's statement is most uncouth, and Zelma is starting to turn
on the sobs, when a large young character in football clothes approaches, and I
can see that he is nobody but the Princeton who fumbles the ball, and I can
also see that he seems to be slightly perturbed as he says to us like this:</p>

<p>'Where is the pancake who sings out Charley over here? My name is
Charley.'</p>

<p>Well, personally, I do not care for his attitude, and I do not think it
shows proper college training for him to be speaking of pancakes, but before I
can decide what to do about the situation, Jake Applebaum steps forward and
says:</p>

<p>'Oh, so you are Charley, are you, you snake in the grass? Well, my lady
friend here that you try to steal from me is the one who sings out. Why?' Jake
says. 'What do you wish to make of it?'</p>

<p>'Only this!' the football character says, and then he lets go as neat a left
hook as ever I could wish to behold and stretches Jake as flat as a pancake,
and immediately disappears in the dusk.</p>

<p>We leave Jake there and start walking back to the railroad, and all this
time Blooch never says a word but seems to be thinking of something, and
finally he turns to Zelma and speaks as follows:</p>

<p>'You mean to say I stand to lose eight thousand of my own money on a
four-to-one shot in this game?' Blooch says. 'Yes, Poppa,' Zelma says, 'you can
figure it in such a way. But Charley says--'</p>

<p>Then without finishing she lets out a scream, because Blooch falls in a dead
faint and starts rolling down a little hill, and the chances are he will be
rolling yet if a big blond young character does not come leaping out of the
dusk to grab him and set him on his pins again and shake him out of his faint.
At the sight of this young character Zelma lets out another scream and says
like this:</p>

<p>'Char-lee!'</p>

<p>So now Blooch Bodinski has a big suite of offices, and fifty telephones, and
he calls himself the Flannagan Brokerage Company and makes the biggest football
book in this country, and everybody along Broadway is pretty jealous about
this, although Mindy, the restaurant man, says: 'Well, you must give Blooch
credit for digging up Charley Flannagan, the best football handicapper in the
world, for a son-in-law.'</p>

<p>And every time Blooch looks at Charley he nods his head to show he approves
him, and sometimes Blooch says out loud: 'Big shoulders!'</p>

<h3><a name="That_Ever-Loving_Wife_of_Hymies" id="That_Ever-Loving_Wife_of_Hymies">That Ever-Loving Wife of Hymie's</a></h3>

Mahogany and Hymie Banjo Eyes to sleep with, I will take Mahogany every time,
even though Mahogany snores more than somewhat when he is sleeping. But
Mahogany is by no means as offensive to sleep with as Hymie Banjo Eyes, as
Hymie not only snores when he is sleeping, but he hollers and kicks around and
takes on generally.</p>

<p>He is a short, pudgy little guy who is called Hymie Banjo Eyes because his
eyes bulge out as big and round as banjos, although his right name is
Weinstein, or some such, and he is somewhat untidy-looking in spots, for Hymie
Banjo Eyes is a guy who does not care if his breakfast gets on his vest, or
what. Furthermore, he gabs a lot and thinks he is very smart, and many citizens
consider him a pest, in spades. But personally I figure Hymie Banjo Eyes as
very harmless, although he is not such a guy as I will ordinarily care to have
much truck with.</p>

<p>But there I am one morning waking up to find myself sleeping with both
Mahogany and Hymie, and what are we sleeping in but a horse car bound for
Miami, and we are passing through North Carolina in a small-time blizzard when
I wake up, and Mahogany is snoring and shivering, because it seems Hymie cops
the poor horse's blanket to wrap around himself, and I am half frozen and
wishing I am back in Mindy's Restaurant on Broadway, where all is bright and
warm, and that I never see either Mahogany or Hymie in my life.</p>

<p>Of course it is not Mahogany's fault that I am sleeping with him and Hymie,
and in fact, for all I know, Mahogany may not consider me any bargain whatever
to sleep with. It is Hymie's fault for digging me up in Mindy's one night and
explaining to me how wonderful the weather is in Miami in the winter-time, and
how we can go there for the races with his stable and make plenty of potatoes
for ourselves, although of course I know when Hymie is speaking of his stable
he means Mahogany, for Hymie never has more than one horse at anyone time in
his stable.</p>

<p>Generally it is some broken-down lizard that he buys for about the price of
an old wool hat and patches up the best he can, as Hymie Banjo Eyes is a horse
trainer by trade, and considering the kind of horses he trains he is not a bad
trainer, at that. He is very good indeed at patching up cripples and sometimes
winning races with them until somebody claims them on him or they fall down
dead, and then he goes and gets himself another cripple and starts all over
again.</p>

<p>I hear he buys Mahogany off a guy by the name of O'Shea for a hundred bucks,
although the chances are if Hymie waits a while the guy will pay him at least
two hundred to take Mahogany away and hide him, for Mahogany has bad legs and
bum feet, and is maybe nine years old, and does not win a race since the summer
of 1924, and then it is an accident. But anyway, Mahogany is the stable Hymie
Banjo Eyes is speaking of taking to Miami when he digs me up in Mindy's.</p>

<p>'And just think,' Hymie says, 'all we need to get there is the price of a
drawing-room on the Florida Special.'</p>

<p>Well, I am much surprised by this statement, because it is the first time I
ever hear of a horse needing a drawing-room, especially such a horse as
Mahogany, but it seems the drawing-room is not to be for Mahogany, or even for
Hymie or me. It seems it is to be for Hymie's ever-loving wife, a blonde doll
by the name of 'Lasses, which he marries out of some night-club where she is
what is called an adagio dancer.</p>

<p>It seems that when 'Lasses is very young somebody once says she is just as
sweet as Molasses, and this is how she comes to get the name of 'Lasses,
although her right name is Maggie Something, and I figure she must change quite
a lot since they begin calling her 'Lasses because at the time I meet her she
is sweet just the same as green grapefruit.</p>

<p>She has a partner in the adagio business by the name of Donaldo, who picks
her up and heaves her around the night-club as if she is nothing but a
baseball, and it is very thrilling indeed to see Donaldo giving 'Lasses a sling
as if he is going to throw her plumb away, which many citizens say may not be a
bad idea, at that, and then catching her by the foot in mid-air and hauling her
back to him.</p>

<p>But one night it seems that Donaldo takes a few slugs of gin before going
into this adagio business, and he muffs 'Lasses' foot, although nobody can see
how this is possible, because 'Lasses' foot is no more invisible than a box
car, and 'Lasses keeps on sailing through the air. She finally sails into Hymie
Banjo Eyes' stomach as he is sitting at a table pretty well back, and this is
the way Hymie and 'Lasses meet, and a romance starts, although it is nearly a
week before Hymie recovers enough from the body beating he takes off 'Lasses to
go around and see her.</p>

<p>The upshot of the romance is 'Lasses and Hymie get married, although up to
the time Donaldo slings her into Hymie's stomach, 'Lasses is going around with
Brick McCloskey, the bookmaker, and is very loving with him indeed, but they
have a row about something and are carrying the old torch for each other when
Hymie happens along.</p>

<p>Some citizens say the reason 'Lasses marries Hymie is because she is all
sored up on Brick and that she acts without thinking, as dolls often do,
especially blonde dolls, although personally I figure Hymie takes all the worst
of the situation, as 'Lasses is not such a doll as any guy shall marry without
talking it over with his lawyer. 'Lasses is one of these little blondes who is
full of short answers, and personally I will just as soon marry a porcupine.
But Hymie loves her more than somewhat, and there is no doubt Brick McCloskey
is all busted up because 'Lasses takes this run-out powder on him, so maybe
after all 'Lasses has some kind of appeal which I cannot notice off-hand.</p>

<p>'But,' Hymie explains to me when he is speaking to me about this trip to
Miami, ''Lasses is not well, what with nerves and one thing and another, and
she will have to travel to Miami along with her Pekingese dog, Sooey-pow,
because,' Hymie says, 'it will make her more nervous than somewhat if she has
to travel with anybody else. And of course,' Hymie says, 'no one can expect
'Lasses to travel in anything but a drawing-room on account of her health.'</p>

<p>Well, the last time I see 'Lasses she is making a sucker of a big sirloin in
Bobby's Restaurant, and she strikes me as a pretty healthy doll, but of course
I never examine her close, and anyway, her health is none of my business.</p>

<p>'Now,' Hymie says, 'I get washed out at Empire, and I am pretty much in hock
here and there and have no dough to ship my stable to Miami, but,' he says, 'a
friend of mine is shipping several horses there and he has a whole car, and he
will kindly let me have room in one end of the car for my stable, and you and I
can ride in there, too.</p>

<p>'That is,' Hymie says, 'we can ride in there if you will dig up the price of
a drawing-room and the two tickets that go with it so 'Lasses' nerves will not
be disturbed. You see,' Hymie says, 'I happen to know you have two hundred and
fifty bucks in the jug over here on the corner, because one of the tellers in
the jug is a friend of mine, and he tips me off you have this sugar, even
though,' Hymie says, 'you have it in there under another name.'</p>

<p>Well, a guy goes up against many daffy propositions as he goes along through
life, and the first thing I know I am waking up, like I tell you, to find
myself sleeping with Mahogany and Hymie, and as I lay there in the horse car
slowly freezing to death, I get to thinking of 'Lasses in a drawing-room on the
Florida Special, and I hope and trust that she and the Peke are sleeping nice
and warm.</p>

<p>The train finally runs out of the blizzard and the weather heats up
somewhat, so it is not so bad riding in the horse car, and Hymie and I pass the
time away playing two-handed pinochle. Furthermore, I get pretty well
acquainted with Mahogany, and I find he is personally not such a bad old pelter
as many thousands of citizens think.</p>

<p>Finally we get to Miami, and at first it looks as if Hymie is going to have
a tough time finding a place to keep Mahogany, as all the stable room at the
Hialeah track is taken by cash customers, and Hymie certainly is not a cash
customer and neither is Mahogany. Personally, I am not worried so much about
stable room for Mahogany as I am about stable room for myself, because I am now
down to a very few bobs and will need same to eat on.</p>

<p>Naturally, I figure Hymie Banjo Eyes will be joining his ever-loving wife
'Lasses, as I always suppose a husband and wife are an entry, but Hymie tells
me 'Lasses is parked in the Roney Plaza over on Miami Beach, and that he is
going to stay with Mahogany, because it will make her very nervous to have
people around her, especially people who are training horses every day, and who
may not smell so good.</p>

<p>Well, it looks as if we will wind up camping out with Mahogany under a
palm-tree, although many of the palm-trees are already taken by other guys
camping out with horses, but finally Hymie finds a guy who has a garage back of
his house right near the race track, and having no use for this garage since
his car blows away in the hurricane of 1926, the guy is willing to let Hymie
keep Mahogany in the garage. Furthermore, he is willing to let Hymie sleep in
the garage with Mahogany, and pay him now and then.</p>

<p>So Hymie borrows a little hay and grain, such as horses love to eat, off a
friend who has a big string at the track, and moves into the garage with
Mahogany, and about the same time I run into a guy by the name of Pottsville
Legs, out of Pottsville, Pa., and he has a room in a joint downtown, and I move
in with him, and it is no worse than sleeping with Hymie Banjo Eyes and
Mahogany, at that.</p>

<p>I do not see Hymie for some time after this, but I hear of him getting
Mahogany ready for a race. He has the old guy out galloping on the track every
morning, and who is galloping him but Hymie himself, because he cannot get any
stable-boys to do the galloping for him, as they do not wish to waste their
time. However, Hymie rides himself when he is a young squirt, so galloping
Mahogany is not such a tough job for him, except that it gives him a terrible
appetite, and it is very hard for him to find anything to satisfy this appetite
with, and there are rumours around that Hymie is eating most of Mahogany's hay
and grain.</p>

<p>In the meantime, I am going here and there doing the best I can, and this is
not so very good, at that, because never is there such a terrible winter in
Miami or so much suffering among the horse players. In the afternoon I go out
to the race track, and in the evening I go to the dog tracks, and later to the
gambling joints trying to pick up a few honest bobs, and wherever I go I seem
to see Hymie's ever-loving wife 'Lasses, and she is always dressed up more than
somewhat, and generally she is with Brick McCloskey, for Brick shows up in
Miami figuring to do a little business in bookmaking at the track.</p>

<p>When they turn off the books there and put in the mutuels, Brick still does
a little booking to big betters who do not wish to put their dough in the
mutuels for fear of ruining a price, for Brick is a very large operator at all
times. He is not only a large operator, but he is a big, good-looking guy, and
how 'Lasses can ever give him the heave-o for such a looking guy as Hymie Banjo
Eyes is always a great mystery to me. But then this is the way blondes are.</p>

<p>Of course Hymie probably does not know 'Lasses is running around with Brick
McCloskey, because Hymie is too busy getting Mahogany ready for a race to make
such spots as 'Lasses and Brick are apt to be, and nobody is going to bother to
tell him, because so many ever-loving wives are running around with guys who
are not their ever-loving husbands in Miami this winter that nobody considers
it any news.</p>

<p>Personally, I figure 'Lasses' running around with Brick is a pretty fair
break for Hymie, at that, as it takes plenty of weight off him in the way of
dinners, and maybe breakfasts for all I know, although it seems to me 'Lasses
cannot love Hymie as much as Hymie thinks to be running around with another
guy. In fact, I am commencing to figure 'Lasses does not care for Hymie Banjo
Eyes whatever.</p>

<p>Well, one day I am looking over the entries, and I see where Hymie has old
Mahogany in a claiming race at a mile and an eighth, and while it is a cheap
race, there are some pretty fair hides in it. In fact, I can figure at least
eight out of the nine that are entered to beat Mahogany by fourteen
lengths.</p>

<p>Well, I go out to Hialeah very early, and I step around to the garage where
Mahogany and Hymie are living, and Hymie is sitting out in front of the garage
on a bucket looking very sad, and Mahogany has his beezer stuck out through the
door of the garage, and he is looking even sadder than Hymie.</p>

<p>'Well,' I say to Hymie Banjo Eyes, 'I see the big horse goes today.'</p>

<p>'Yes,' Hymie says, 'the big horse goes to-day if I can get ten bucks for the
jockey fee, and if I can get a jock after I get the fee. It is a terrible
situation,' Hymie says. 'Here I get Mahogany all readied up for the race of his
life in a spot where he can win by as far as from here to Palm Beach and grab a
purse worth six hundred fish, and me without as much as a sawbuck to hire one
of these hop-toads that are putting themselves away as jocks around here.'</p>

<p>'Well,' I say, 'why do you not speak to 'Lasses, your ever-loving wife,
about this situation? I see 'Lasses playing the wheel out at Hollywood last
night,' I say, 'and she has a stack of cheques in front of her a greyhound
cannot hurdle, and,' I say, 'it is not like 'Lasses to go away from there
without a few bobs off such a start.'</p>

<p>'Now there you go again,' Hymie says, very impatient indeed. 'You are always
making cracks about 'Lasses, and you know very well it will make the poor
little doll very nervous if I speak to her about such matters as a sawbuck,
because 'Lasses needs all the sawbucks she can get hold of to keep herself and
Sooey-pow at the Roney Plaza. By the way,' Hymie says, 'how much scratch do you
have on your body at this time?'</p>

<p>Well, I am never any hand for telling lies, especially to an old friend such
as Hymie Banjo Eyes, so I admit I have a ten-dollar note, although naturally I
do not mention another tenner which I also have in my pocket, as I know Hymie
will wish both of them. He will wish one of my tenners to pay the jockey fee,
and he will wish the other to bet on Mahogany, and I am certainly not going to
let Hymie throw my dough away betting it on such an old crocodile as Mahogany,
especially in a race which a horse by the name of Side Burns is a sure thing to
win.</p>

<p>In fact, I am waiting patiently for several days for a chance to bet on Side
Burns. So I hold out one sawbuck on Hymie, and then I go over to the track and
forget all about him and Mahogany until the sixth race is coming up, and I see
by the jockey board that Hymie has a jock by the name of Scroon riding
Mahogany, and while Mahogany is carrying only one hundred pounds, which is the
light-weight of the race, I will personally just as soon have Paul Whiteman up
as Scroon. Personally I do not think Scroon can spell 'horse,' for he is
nothing but a dizzy little guy who gets a mount about once every pancake
Tuesday. But of course Hymie is not a guy who can pick and choose his jocks,
and the chances are he is pretty lucky to get anybody to ride Mahogany.</p>

<p>I see by the board where it tells you the approximate odds that Mahogany is
40 to 1, and naturally nobody is paying any attention to such a horse, because
it will not be good sense to pay any attention to Mahogany in this race, what
with it being his first start in months, and Mahogany not figuring with these
horses, or with any horses, as far as this is concerned. In fact, many citizens
think Hymie Banjo Eyes is either crazy, or is running Mahogany in this race for
exercise, although nobody who knows Hymie will figure him to be spending dough
on a horse just to exercise him.</p>

<p>The favourite in the race is this horse named Side Burns, and from the way
they are playing him right from taw you will think he is Twenty Grand. He is
even money on the board, and I hope and trust that he will finally pay as much
as this, because at even money I consider him a very sound investment, indeed.
In fact, I am willing to take 4 to 5 for my dough, and will consider it money
well found, because I figure this will give me about eighteen bobs to bet on
Tony Joe in the last race, and anybody will tell you that you can go to sleep
on Tony Joe winning, unless something happens.</p>

<p>There is a little action on several other horses in the race, but of course
there is none whatever for Mahogany and the last time I look he is up to fifty.
So I buy my ticket on Side Burns, and go out to the paddock to take a peek at
the horses, and I see Hymie Banjo Eyes in there saddling Mahogany with his
jockey, this dizzy Scroon, standing alongside him in Hymie's colours of red,
pink and yellow, and making wise-cracks to the guys in the next stall about
Mahogany.</p>

<p>Hymie Banjo Eyes sees me and motions me to come into the paddock, so I go in
and give Mahogany a pat on the snoot, and the old guy seems to remember me
right away, because he rubs his beezer up and down my arm and lets out a little
snicker. But it seems to me the old plug looks a bit peaked, and I can see his
ribs very plain indeed, so I figure maybe there is some truth in the rumour
about Hymie sharing Mahogany's hay and grain, after all.</p>

<p>Well, as I am standing there, Hymie gives this dizzy Scroon his riding
instructions, and they are very short, for all Hymie says is as follows:</p>

<p>'Listen,' Hymie says, 'get off with this horse and hurry right home.'</p>

<p>And Scroon looks a little dizzier than somewhat and nods his head, and then
turns and tips a wink to Kurtsinger, who is riding the horse in the next
stall.</p>

<p>Well, finally the post bugle goes, and Hymie walks back with me to the lawn
as the horses are coming out on the track, and Hymie is speaking about nothing
but Mahogany.</p>

<p>'It is just my luck,' Hymie says, 'not to have a bob or two to bet on him.
He will win this race as far as you can shoot a rifle, and the reason he will
win this far,' Hymie says, 'is because the track is just soft enough to feel
nice and soothing to his sore feet. Furthermore,' Hymie says, 'after lugging my
one hundred and forty pounds around every morning for two weeks, Mahogany will
think it is Christmas when he finds nothing but this Scroon's one hundred
pounds on his back.</p>

<p>'In fact,' Hymie says, 'if I do not need the purse money, I will not let him
run to-day, but will hide him for a bet. But,' he says, 'Lasses must have five
yards at once, and you know how nervous she will be if she does not get the
five yards. So I am letting Mahogany run,' Hymie says, 'and it is a pity.'</p>

<p>'Well,' I say, 'why do you not promote somebody to bet on him for you?'</p>

<p>'Why,' Hymie says, 'if I ask one guy I ask fifty. But they all think I am
out of my mind to think Mahogany can beat such horses as Side Burns and the
rest. Well,' he says, 'they will be sorry. By the way,' he says, 'do you have a
bet down of any kind?'</p>

<p>Well, now, I do not wish to hurt Hymie's feelings by letting him know I bet
on something else in the race, so I tell him I do not play this race at all,
and he probably figures it is because I have nothing to bet with after giving
him the sawbuck. But he keeps on talking as we walk over in front of the
grandstand, and all he is talking about is what a tough break it is for him not
to have any dough to bet on Mahogany. By this time the horses are at the post a
little way up the track, and as we are standing there watching them, Hymie
Banjo Eyes goes on talking, half to me and half to himself, but out loud.</p>

<p>'Yes,' he says, 'I am the unluckiest guy in all the world. Here I am,' he
says, 'with a race that is a kick in the pants for my horse at fifty to one,
and me without a quarter to bet. It is certainly a terrible thing to be poor,'
Hymie says. 'Why,' he says, 'I will bet my life on my horse in this race, I am
so sure of winning. I will bet my clothes. I will bet all I ever hope to have.
In fact,' he says, 'I will even bet my ever-loving wife, this is how sure I
am.'</p>

<p>Now of course this is only the way horse players rave when they are good and
heated up about the chances of a horse, and I hear such conversations as this
maybe a million times, and never pay any attention to it whatever, but as Hymie
makes this crack about betting his ever-loving wife, a voice behind us says as
follows:</p>

<p>'Against how much?'</p>

<p>Naturally, Hymie and I look around at once, and who does the voice belong to
but Brick McCloskey. Of course I figure Brick is kidding Hymie Banjo Eyes, but
Brick's voice is as cold as ice as he says to Hymie like this:</p>

<p>'Against how much will you bet your wife your horse wins this race?' he
says. 'I hear you saying you are sure this old buzzard meat you are running
will win,' Brick says, 'so let me see how sure you are. Personally,' Brick
says, 'I think they ought to prosecute you for running a broken-down hound like
Mahogany on the ground of cruelty to animals, and furthermore,' Brick says, 'I
think they ought to put you in an insane asylum if you really believe your old
dog has a chance. But I will give you a bet,' he says. 'How much do you wish me
to lay against your wife?'</p>

<p>Well, this is very harsh language indeed, and I can see that Brick is
getting something off his chest he is packing there for some time. The chances
are he is putting the blast on poor Hymie Banjo Eyes on account of Hymie
grabbing 'Lasses from him, and of course Brick McCloskey never figures for a
minute that Hymie will take his question seriously. But Hymie answers like
this:</p>

<p>'You are a price-maker,' he says. 'What do you lay?'</p>

<p>Now this is a most astonishing reply, indeed, when you figure that Hymie is
asking what Brick will bet against Hymie's everloving wife 'Lasses, and I am
very sorry to hear Hymie ask, especially as I happen to turn around and find
that nobody but 'Lasses herself is listening in on the conversation, and the
chances are her face will be very white, if it is not for her make-up, 'Lasses
being a doll who goes in for make-up more than somewhat.</p>

<p>'Yes,' Brick McCloskey says, 'I am a price-maker, all right, and I will lay
you a price. I will lay you five C's against your wife that your plug does not
win,' he says.</p>

<p>Brick looks at 'Lasses as he says this, and 'Lasses looks at Brick, and
personally I will probably take a pop at a guy who looks at my ever-loving wife
in such a way, if I happen to have any ever-loving wife, and maybe I will take
a pop at my ever-loving wife, too, if she looks back at a guy in such a way,
but of course Hymie is not noticing such things as looks at this time, and in
fact he does not see 'Lasses as yet. But he does not hesitate in answering
Brick.</p>

<p>'You are a bet,' says Hymie. 'Five hundred bucks against my ever-loving wife
'Lasses. It is a chiseller's price such as you always lay,' he says, 'and the
chances are I can do better if I have time to go shopping around but as it is,'
he says, 'it is like finding money and I will not let you get away. But be
ready to pay cash right after the race, because I will not accept your
paper.'</p>

<p>Well, I hear of many a strange bet on horse races, but never before do I
hear of a guy betting his ever-loving wife, although to tell you the truth I
never before hear of a guy getting the opportunity to bet his wife on a race.
For all I know, if bookmakers take wives as a steady thing there will be much
action in such matters at every track.</p>

<p>But I can see that both Brick McCloskey and Hymie Banjo Eyes are in dead
earnest, and about this time 'Lasses tries to cop a quiet sneak, and Hymie sees
her and speaks to her as follows:</p>

<p>'Hello, Baby,' Hymie says. 'I will have your five yards for you in a few
minutes and five more to go with it, as I am just about to clip a sucker. Wait
here with me, Baby,' Hymie says.</p>

<p>'No,' 'Lasses says, 'I am too nervous to wait here. I am going down by the
fence to root your horse in,' she says, but as she goes away I see another look
pass between her and Brick McCloskey.</p>

<p>Well, all of a sudden Cassidy gets the horses in a nice line and lets them
go, and as they come busting down past the stand the first time who is right
there on top but old Mahogany, with this dizzy Scroon kicking at his skinny
sides and yelling in his ears. As they make the first turn, Scroon has Mahogany
a length in front, and he moves him out another length as they hit the back
side.</p>

<p>Now I always like to watch the races from a spot away up the lawn, as I do
not care to have anybody much around me when the tough finishes come along in
case I wish to bust out crying, so I leave Hymie Banjo Eyes and Brick McCloskey
still glaring at each other and go to my usual place, and who is standing
there, too, all by herself but 'Lasses. And about this time the horses are
making the turn into the stretch and Mahogany is still on top, but something is
coming very fast on the outside. It looks as if Mahogany is in a tough spot,
because halfway down the stretch the outside horse nails him and looks him
right in the eye, and who is it but the favourite, Side Burns.</p>

<p>They come on like a team, and I am personally giving Side Burns a great ride
from where I am standing, when I hear a doll yelling out loud, and who is the
doll but 'Lasses, and what is she yelling but the following:</p>

<p>'Come on with him, jock!'</p>

<p>Furthermore, as she yells, 'Lasses snaps her fingers like a crap shooter and
runs a couple of yards one way and then turns and runs a couple of yards back
the other way, so I can see that 'Lasses is indeed of a nervous temperament,
just as Hymie Banjo Eyes is always telling me, although up to this time I
figure her nerves are the old alzo.</p>

<p>'Come on!' 'Lasses yells again. 'Let him roll!' she yells. 'Ride him, boy!'
she yells. 'Come on with him, Frankie!'</p>

<p>Well, I wish to say that 'Lasses' voice may be all right if she is selling
tomatoes from door to door, but I will not care to have her using it around me
every day for any purpose whatever, because she yells so loud I have to move
off a piece to keep my ear-drums from being busted wide open. She is still
yelling when the horses go past the finish line, the snozzles of old Mahogany
and Side Burns so close together that nobody can hardly tell which is
which.</p>

<p>In fact, there is quite a wait before the numbers go up, and I can see
'Lasses standing there with her programme all wadded up in her fist as she
watches the board, and I can see she is under a very terrible nervous strain
indeed, and I am very sorry I go around thinking her nerves are the old alzo.
Pretty soon the guy hangs out No.9, and No. 9 is nobody but old Mahogany, and
at this I hear 'Lasses screech, and all of a sudden she flops over in a faint,
and somebody carries her under the grandstand to revive her, and I figure her
nerves bog down entirely, and I am sorrier than ever for thinking bad thoughts
of her.</p>

<p>I am also very, very sorry I do not bet my sawbuck on Mahogany, especially
when the board shows he pays $102, and I can see where Hymie Banjo Eyes is
right about the weight and all, but I am glad Hymie wins the purse and also the
five C's off of Brick McCloskey and that he saves his ever-loving wife, because
I figure Hymie may now pay me back a few bobs.</p>

<p>I do not see Hymie or Brick or 'Lasses again until the races are over, and
then I hear of a big row going on under the stand, and go to see what is doing,
and who is having the row but Hymie Banjo Eyes and Brick McCloskey. It seems
that Hymie hits Brick a clout on the beezer that stretches Brick out, and it
seems that Hymie hits Brick this blow because as Brick is paying Hymie the five
C's he makes the following crack:</p>

<p>'I do not mind losing the dough to you, Banjo Eyes,' Brick says, 'but I am
sore at myself for overlaying the price. It is the first time in all the years
I am booking that I make such an overlay. The right price against your wife,'
Brick says, 'is maybe two dollars and a half.'</p>

<p>Well, as Brick goes down with a busted beezer from Hymie's punch, and
everybody is much excited, who steps out of the crowd around them and throws
her arms around Hymie Banjo Eyes but his ever-loving wife 'Lasses, and as she
kisses Hymie smack-dab in the mush, 'Lasses says as follows:</p>

<p>'My darling Hymie,' she says, 'I hear what this big flannel-mouth says about
the price on me, and,' she says, 'I am only sorry you do not cripple him for
life. I know now I love you, and only you, Hymie,' she says, 'and I will never
love anybody else. In fact,' 'Lasses says, 'I just prove my love for you by
almost wrecking my nerves in rooting Mahogany home. I am still weak,' she says,
'but I have strength enough left to go with you to the Sunset Inn for a nice
dinner, and you can give me my money then. Furthermore,' 'Lasses says, 'now
that we have a few bobs, I think you better find another place for Mahogany to
stay, as it does not look nice for my husband to be living with a horse.'</p>

<p>Well, I am going by the jockey house on my way home, thinking how nice it is
that Hymie Banjo Eyes will no longer have to live with Mahogany, and what a
fine thing it is to have a loyal, ever-loving wife such as 'Lasses, who risks
her nerves rooting for her husband's horse, when I run into this dizzy Scroon
in his street clothes, and wishing to be friendly, I say to him like this:</p>

<p>'Hello, Frankie,' I say. 'You put up a nice ride to-day.'</p>

<p>'Where do you get this "Frankie"?' Scroon says. 'My name is Gus.'</p>

<p>'Why,' I say, commencing to think of this and that, 'so it is, but is there
a jock called Frankie in the sixth race with you this afternoon?'</p>

<p>'Sure,' Scroon says. 'Frankie Madeley. He rides Side Burns, the favourite;
and I make a sucker of him in the stretch run.'</p>

<p>But of course I never mention to Hymie Banjo Eyes that I figure his
ever-loving wife roots herself into a dead faint for the horse that will give
her to Brick McCloskey, because for all I know she may think Scroon's name is
Frankie, at that.</p>

<h3><a name="Neat_Strip" id="Neat_Strip">Neat Strip</a></h3>
<p>Now this Rose Viola is twenty years old and is five feet five inches tall in
her high-heeled shoes, and weighs one hundred and twenty pounds, net, and has a
twenty-six waist, and a thirty-six bust, and wears a four and one-half
shoe.</p>

<p>Moreover, she has a seven-inch ankle, and an eleven-inch calf, and the
reason I know all these intimate details is because a friend of mine by the
name of Rube Goldstein has Rose Viola in a burlesque show and advertises her as
the American Venus, and he always prints these specifications in his ads.</p>

<p>But of course Rube Goldstein has no way of putting down in figures how
beautiful Rose Viola is, because after all any pancake may have the same
specifications and still be a rutabaga. All Rube can do is to show photographs
of Rose Viola and after you see these photographs and then see Rose Viola
herself you have half a mind to look the photographer up and ask him what he
means by so grossly underestimating the situation.</p>

<p>She has big blue eyes, and hair the colour of sun-up, and furthermore this
colour is as natural as a six and five. Her skin is as white and as smooth as
ivory and her teeth are like rows of new corn on the cob and she has a smile
that starts slow and easy on her lips and in her eyes and seems to sort of flow
over the rest of her face until any male characters observing same are wishing
there is a murder handy that they can commit for her.</p>

<p>Well, I suppose by this time you are saying to yourself what is such a
darberoo doing in a burlesque turkey, for burlesque is by no means an
intellectual form of entertainment, and the answer to this question is that
Rube Goldstein pays Rose Viola four hundred dollars per week, and this is by no
means tin.</p>

<p>And the reason Rube Goldstein pays her such a sum is not because Rube is any
philanthropist but because Rose Viola draws like a flaxseed poultice, for
besides her looks she has that certain something that goes out across the
footlights and hits every male character present smack-dab in the kisser and
makes him hate to go home and gaze upon his ever-loving wife. In fact, I hear
that for three weeks after Rose Viola plays a town the percentage of missing
husbands appals the authorities.</p>

<p>It seems that the first time Rube Goldstein sees Rose Viola is in the city
of Baltimore, Md., where his show is playing the old Gaiety, and one of Rube's
chorus Judys, a sod widow who is with him nearly thirteen years and raises up
three sons to manhood under him, runs off and marries a joskin from over on the
eastern shore.</p>

<p>Naturally, Rube considers this a dirty trick, as he is so accustomed to
seeing this Judy in his chorus that he feels his show will never look the same
to him again; but the same night the widow is missing, Rose Viola appears
before him asking for a situation. Rube tells me he is greatly surprised at
such a looking Judy seeking a place in a burlesque show and he explains to Rose
Viola that it is a very tough life, to be sure, and that the pay is small, and
that she will probably do better for herself if she gets a job dealing them off
her arm in a beanery, or some such, but she requests Rube to kindly omit the
alfalfa and give her a job, and Rube can see at once by the way she talks that
she has personality.</p>

<p>So he hires her at twenty-five slugs per week to start with and raises her
to half a C and makes her a principal the second night when he finds eighteen
blokes lined up at the stage door after the show looking to date her up. In
three weeks she is his star and he is three-sheeting her as if she is Katherine
Cornell.</p>

<p>She comes out on the stage all dressed up in a beautiful evening gown and
sings a little song, and as soon as she begins singing you wonder, unless you
see her before, what she really is, as you can see by her voice that she is
scarcely a singer by trade.</p>

<p>Her voice is not at all the same as Lily Pons's and in fact it is more like
an old-fashioned coffee grinder, and about the time you commence to figure that
she must be something like a magician and will soon start pulling rabbits out
of a hat, Rose Viola begins to dance.</p>

<p>It is not a regular dance, to be sure. It is more of a hop and a skip and a
jump back and forth across the stage, and as she is hopping and skipping and
jumping, Rose Viola is also feeling around for zippers here and there about her
person, and finally the evening gown disappears and she seems to be slightly
dishabille but in a genteel manner, and then you can see by her shape that she
is indeed a great artist.</p>

<p>Sometimes she will come down off the stage and work along the centre aisle,
and this is when the audience really enjoys her most, as she will always stop
before some bald-headed old character in an aisle seat where bald-headed
characters are generally found, and will pretend to make a great fuss over him,
singing to him, and maybe kissing him on top of the bald head and leaving the
print of her lips in rouge there, which sometimes puts bald-headed characters
to a lot of bother explaining when they get home.</p>

<p>She has a way of laughing and talking back to an audience and keeping it in
good humour while she is working, although outside the theatre Rose Viola is
very serious, and seldom has much to say. In fact, Rose Viola has so little to
say that there are rumours in some quarters that she is a trifle dumb, but
personally I would not mind being dumb myself at four hundred boffoes per
week.</p>

<p>Well, it seems that a character by the name of Newsbaum, who runs a spot
called the Pigeon Club, hears of Rose Viola, and he goes to see her one night
at the old Mid Theatre on Broadway where Rube's show is playing a New York
engagement, and this Newsbaum is such a character as is always looking for
novelties for his club and he decides that Rose Viola will go good there.</p>

<p>So he offers her a chance to double at his club, working there after she
gets through with her regular show, and Rube Goldstein advises her to take it,
as Rube is very fond of Rose and he says this may be a first step upward in her
career because the Pigeon Club is patronized only by very high-class
rumpots.</p>

<p>So Rose Viola opens one night at the Pigeon Club, and she is working on the
dance floor close to the tables, and doing the same act she does in burlesque,
when a large young character who is sitting at one of the front tables with a
bunch of other young characters, including several nice-looking Judys, reaches
out and touches Rose Viola with the end of a cigarette in a spot she just
unzippers.</p>

<p>Now of course this is all in a spirit of fun, but it is something that never
happens in a burlesque house, and naturally Rose is startled no little, and
quite some, and in addition to this she is greatly pained, as it seems that it
is the lighted end of the cigarette that the large young character touches her
with.</p>

<p>So she begins letting out screams, and these screams attract the attention
of Rube Goldstein, who is present to see how she gets along at her opening, and
although Rube is nearly seventy years old, and is fat and slow and
sleepy-looking, he steps forward and flattens the large young character with a
dish of chicken a la king, which he picks up off a near-by table.</p>

<p>Well, it seems that the large young character is nobody but a character by
the name of Mr. Choicer, who has great sums of money, and a fine social
position, and this incident creates some little confusion, especially as old
Rube Goldstein also flattens Newsbaum with another plate, this one containing
lobster Newberg, when Newsbaum comes along complaining about Rube ruining his
chinaware and also one of his best-paying customers.</p>

<p>Then Rube puts his arm around Rose Viola and makes her get dressed and leads
her out of the Pigeon Club and up to Mindy's Restaurant on Broadway, where I am
personally present to observe much of what follows.</p>

<p>They sit down at my table and order up a couple of oyster stews, and Rose
Viola is still crying at intervals, especially when she happens to rub the spot
where the lighted cigarette hits, and Rube Goldstein is saying that for two
cents he will go back to the Pigeon Club and flatten somebody again, when all
of a sudden the door opens and in comes a young character in dinner
clothes.</p>

<p>He is without a hat, and he is looking rumpled up no little, and on
observing him, Rose Viola lets out a small cry, and Rube Goldstein picks up his
bowl of oyster stew and starts getting to his feet, for it seems that they both
recognize the young character as one of the characters at Mr. Choicer's table
in the Pigeon Club.</p>

<p>This young character rushes up in great excitement, and grabs Rube's arm
before Rube can let fly with the oyster stew, and he holds Rube down in his
chair, and looks at Rose Viola and speaks to her as follows:</p>

<p>'Oh,' he says, 'I search everywhere for you after you leave the Pigeon Club.
I wish to beg your pardon for what happens there. I am ashamed of my friend Mr.
Choicer. I will never speak to him again as long as I live. He is a scoundrel.
Furthermore, he is in bad shape from the chicken a la king. Oh,' the young
character says, 'please forgive me for ever knowing him.'</p>

<p>Well, all the time he is talking, he is holding Rube Goldstein down and
looking at Rose Viola, and she is looking back at him, and in five minutes more
they do not know Rube Goldstein and me are in the restaurant, and in fact they
are off by themselves at another table so the young character can make his
apologies clearer, and Rube Goldstein is saying to me that after nearly seventy
years he comes to the conclusion that the Judys never change.</p>

<p>So, then, this is the beginning of a wonderful romance, and in fact it is
love at first sight on both sides, and very pleasant to behold, at that.</p>

<p>It seems that the name of the young character is Daniel Frame, and that he
is twenty-six years of age, and in his last year in law school at Yale, and
that he comes to New York for a week-end visit and runs into his old college
chum, Mr. Choicer, and now here he is in love.</p>

<p>I learn these details afterward from Rose Viola, and I also learn that this
Daniel Frame is an only child, and lives with his widowed mother in a two-story
white colonial house with ivy on the walls, and a yard around it, just outside
the city of Manchester, N.H.</p>

<p>I learn that his mother has an old poodle dog by the name of Rags, and three
servants, and that she lives very quietly, and never goes anywhere much except
maybe to church and that the moonlight is something wonderful up around
Manchester, N.H.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I learn that Daniel Frame comes of the best people in New
England, and that he likes ski-ing, and Benny Goodman's band, and hates
mufflers around his neck, and is very fond of pop-overs for breakfast, and that
his eyes are dark brown, and that he is six feet even and weighs one hundred
and eighty pounds and that he never goes to a dentist in his life.</p>

<p>I also learn that the ring he wears on the little finger of his left hand is
his family crest, and that he sings baritone with a glee club, and the chances
are I will learn plenty more about Daniel Frame if I care to listen any further
to Rose Viola.</p>

<p>'He wishes to marry me,' Rose says. 'He wishes to take me to the white
colonial house outside of Manchester, N.H., where we can raise Sealyham
terriers, and maybe children. I love Sealyham terriers,' she says. 'They are
awfully cute. Daniel wishes me to quit burlesque entirely. He sees me work at
the Mid the other night and he thinks I am wonderful, but,' Rose says, 'he says
it worries him constantly to think of me out there on that stage running the
risk of catching colds.</p>

<p>'Another thing,' Rose Viola says, 'Daniel wishes me to meet his mother, but
he is afraid she will be greatly horrified if she finds out the way I am
exposed to the danger of catching colds. He says,' Rose says, 'that his mother
is very strict about such things.'</p>

<p>Personally, I consider Daniel Frame a very wishy-washy sort of character,
and by no means suitable to a strong personality such as Rose Viola, but when I
ask Rube Goldstein what he thinks about it, Rube says to me like this:</p>

<p>'Well,' he says, 'I think it will be a fine thing for her to marry this
young character, although,' Rube says, 'from what he tells her of his mother, I
do not see how they are going to get past her. I know these old New England
broads,' he says. 'They consider burlesque anything but a worthy amusement.
Still,' he says, 'I have no kick coming about the male characters of New
England. They are always excellent customers of mine.'</p>

<p>'Why,' I say, 'Rose Viola is a fine artist, and does not need such a thing
as marriage.'</p>

<p>'Yes,' Rube says, 'she is the finest artist in her line I ever see but one.
Laura Legayo is still tops with me. She retires on me away back yonder before
you ever see one of my shows. But,' he says, 'if Rose marries this young
character, she will have a home, and a future. Rose needs a future.</p>

<p>'This burlesque business is about done around here for a while,' Rube says.
'I can see the signs. The blats are beefing, and the cops are complaining about
this and that, and one thing and another. They have no soul for art, and
besides we are the easiest marks around when the reformers start rousing the
cops for anything whatever.</p>

<p>'It is always this way with burlesque,' Rube says. 'It is up and down. It is
on the way down now, and Rose may not still be young enough by the time it goes
up again. Yes,' he says, 'Rose needs a future.'</p>

<p>Well, it seems that old Rube is a pretty good guesser, because a couple of
nights later he gets an order from the police commissioner that there must be
no more of this and that, and one thing and another, in his show, and what is
more the police commissioner puts cops in all the burlesque houses to see that
his order is obeyed.</p>

<p>At first Rube Goldstein figures that he may as well close down his New York
run at once, and move to some city that is more hospitable to art, but he is
wedged in at the Mid on a contract to pay rent for a few weeks longer, so while
he is trying to think what is the best thing to do, he lets the show go on just
the same, but omitting this and that, and one thing and another, so as not to
offend the police commissioner in case he comes around looking for offence, or
the cop the commissioner places on duty in the Mid, who is a character by the
name of Halligan.</p>

<p>So there is Rose Viola out on the stage of the Mid doing her number in full
costume without ever reaching for as much as a single zipper, and I can see
what Rube Goldstein means when he says Rose needs a future, because looking at
Rose in full costume really becomes quite monotonous after a while.</p>

<p>To tell the truth, the only one who seems to appreciate Rose in full costume
is Daniel Frame when he comes down from Yale one week-end and finds her in this
condition. In fact, Daniel Frame is really quite delighted with her.</p>

<p>'It is wonderful,' he says. 'It is especially wonderful because I tell my
mother all about you, and she is talking of coming down from Manchester, N.H.,
to see you perform, and I have been worrying myself sick over her beholding you
out there in danger of catching colds. I know she will be greatly pleased with
you now, because,' he says, 'you look so sweet and modest and so well
dressed.'</p>

<p>Naturally, as long as he is pleased, Rose Viola is pleased too, except that
she suffers somewhat from the heat, for there is no doubt but what Rose is
greatly in love with him and she scarcely ever talks about anything else, and
does not seem to care if her art suffers from the change.</p>

<p>Now it comes on another Saturday night and I am backstage at the Mid talking
to Rube Goldstein and he is telling me that he is greatly surprised to find
business holding up so good. The house is packed to the doors, and I tell Rube
that maybe he is wrong all these years and that the public appreciates art even
when it has clothes on, but Rube says he thinks not. He says he thinks it is
more likely that the customers are just naturally optimists.</p>

<p>Rose Viola is on the stage in full costume singing her song when all of a
sudden somebody in the back of the audience lets out a yell of fire and this is
an alarming cry in any theatre, to be sure, and especially in a spot like the
Mid as it is an old house, and about as well fixed to stand off a fire as a
barrel of grease. Then a duty fireman by the name of Rossoffsky, who is always
on duty in the Mid when a show is on, comes rushing backstage and says it is a
fire all right.</p>

<p>It seems that a cafeteria next door to the Mid is blazing inside and the
flames are eating their way through the theatre wall at the front of the house
by the main entrance, and in fact when the alarm is raised the whole wall is
blazing on both sides, and it is a most disturbing situation, to be sure.</p>

<p>Well, the audience in the Mid is composed mostly of male characters, because
male characters always appreciate burlesque much more than females or children,
and these male characters now rise from their seats and start looking for the
exits nearest to them, but by now they are shut off from the main entrance by
the fire.</p>

<p>So they commence looking for other exits, and there are several of these,
but it seems from what Rossoffsky says afterward that these exits are not used
for so long that nobody figures it will ever be necessary to use them again,
and the doors do not come open so easy, especially with so many trying to open
them at once.</p>

<p>Then the male characters begin fighting with each other for the privilege of
opening the doors, and also of getting out through the doors after they are
opened, and this results in some confusion. In fact, it is not long before the
male characters are fighting all over the premises, and knocking each other
down, and stepping on each other's faces in a most discourteous manner.</p>

<p>While it is well known to one and all that a burlesque theatre is no place
to take an ever-loving wife to begin with, it seems that some of these male
characters have their wives with them, and these wives start screaming, but of
course they are among the first knocked down and stepped on, so not much is
heard of them until afterward.</p>

<p>A few of the male characters are smart enough to leap up on the stage and
high-tail it out of there by the back way, but most of them are so busy
fighting on the floor of the theatre that they do not think of this means of
exit, and it is just as well that they do not think of it all at once, at that,
as there is but one narrow stage door, and a rush will soon pile them up like
jack-rabbits there.</p>

<p>The orchestra quits playing and the musicians are dropping their instruments
and getting ready to duck under the stage and Rose Viola is standing still in
the centre of the stage with her mouth open, looking this way and that in some
astonishment and alarm, when all of a sudden a tall, stern-looking old Judy
with white hair, and dressed in grey, stands up on a seat in the front row
right back of the orchestra leader, and says to Rose Viola like this:</p>

<p>'Quick,' she says. 'Go into your routine.'</p>

<p>Well, Rose Viola still stands there as if she cannot figure out what the old
Judy is talking about, and the old Judy makes motions at her with her hands,
and then slowly unbuttons a little grey jacket she is wearing, and tosses it
aside, and Rose gets the idea.</p>

<p>Now the stern-looking old Judy looks over to the orchestra leader, who is a
character by the name of Butwell, and who is with Rube Goldstein's burlesque
show since about the year one, and says to him:</p>

<p>'Hit 'er, Buttsy.'</p>

<p>Well, old Buttsy takes a look at her, and then he takes another look, and
then he raises his hand, and his musicians settle back in their chairs, and as
Buttsy lets his hand fall, they start playing Rose Viola's music, and the tall,
stern-looking old Judy stands there on the seat in the front row pointing at
the stage and hollering so loud her voice is heard above all the confusion of
the male characters at their fighting.</p>

<p>'Look, boys,' she hollers.</p>

<p>And there on the stage is Rose Viola doing her hop, skip and a jump back and
forth and feeling for the zippers here and there about her person, and finding
same.</p>

<p>Now, on hearing the old Judy's voice, and on observing the scene on the
stage, the customers gradually stop fighting with each other and begin easing
themselves back into the seats, and paying strict attention to Rose Viola's
performance, and all this time the wall behind them is blazing, and it is
hotter than one hundred and six in the shade, and smoke is pouring into the
Mid, and anybody will tell you that Rose Viola's feat of holding an audience
against a house fire is really quite unsurpassed in theatrical history.</p>

<p>The tall, stern-looking old Judy remains standing on the seat in the front
row until there are cries behind her to sit down, because it seems she is
obstructing the view of some of those back of her, so finally she takes her
seat, and Rose Viola keeps right on working.</p>

<p>By this time the fire department arrives and has the situation in the
cafeteria under control, and the fire in the wall extinguished, and a fire
captain and a squad of men come into the Mid, because it seems that rumours are
abroad that a great catastrophe takes place in the theatre. In fact, the
captain and his men are greatly alarmed because they cannot see a thing inside
the Mid when they first enter on account of the smoke, and the captain sings
out as follows:</p>

<p>'Is everybody dead in here?'</p>

<p>Then he sees through the smoke what is going on there on the stage, and he
stops and begins enjoying the scene himself, and his men join him, and a good
time is being had by one and all until all of a sudden Rose Viola keels over in
a faint from her exertions. Rube orders the curtain down but the audience,
including the firemen, remain for some time afterward in the theatre, hoping
they may get an encore.</p>

<p>While I am standing near the stage door in readiness to take it on the Jesse
Owens out of there in case the fire gets close, who comes running up all out of
breath but Daniel Frame.</p>

<p>'I just get off the train from New Haven,' he says. 'I run all the way from
the station on hearing a report that the Mid is on fire. Is anybody hurt?' he
says. 'Is Rose safe?'</p>

<p>Well, I suggest that the best way to find out about this is to go inside and
see, so we enter together, and there among the scenery we find Rube Goldstein
and a bunch of actors still in their make-ups gathered about Rose Viola, who is
just getting to her feet and looking somewhat nonplussed.</p>

<p>At this same moment, Halligan, the cop stationed in the Mid, comes
backstage, and pushes his way through the bunch around Rose Viola and taps her
on the shoulder and says to her: 'You are under arrest,' Halligan says. 'I
guess I will have to take you, too, Mr. Goldstein,' he says.</p>

<p>'My goodness,' Daniel Frame says. 'What is Miss Viola under arrest for?'</p>

<p>'For putting on that number out there just now,' Halligan says. 'It's a
violation of the police commissioner's order.'</p>

<p>'Heavens and earth,' Daniel Frame says. 'Rose, do not tell me you are out
there to-night running the risk of catching cold, as before?'</p>

<p>'Yes,' Rose says.</p>

<p>'Oh, my goodness,' Daniel Frame says, 'and all the time my mother is sitting
out there in the audience. I figure this week is a great time for her to see
you perform, Rose,' he says. 'I cannot get down from New Haven in time to go
with her, but I send her alone to see you, and I am to meet her after the
theatre with you and introduce you to her. What will she think?'</p>

<p>'Well,' Halligan says, 'I have plenty of evidence against this party. In
fact, I see her myself. Not bad,' he says. 'Not bad.'</p>

<p>Rose Viola is standing there looking at Daniel Frame in a sad way, and
Daniel Frame is looking at Rose Viola in even a sadder way, when Rossoffsky,
the fireman, shoves his way into the gathering, and says to Halligan:</p>

<p>'Copper,' he says, 'I overhear your remarks. Kindly take a walk,' he says.
'If it is not for this party putting on that number out there, the chances are
there will be a hundred dead in the aisles from the panic. In fact,' he says,
'I remember seeing you yourself knock over six guys trying to reach an exit
before she starts dancing. She is a heroine,' he says. 'That is what she is,
and I will testify to it in court.'</p>

<p>At this point who steps in through the stage door but the tall,
stern-looking old Judy in grey, and when he sees her, Daniel Frame runs up to
her and says:</p>

<p>'Oh, Mother,' he says, 'I am so mortified. Still,' he says, 'I love her just
the same.'</p>

<p>But the old Judy scarcely notices him because by this time Rube Goldstein is
shaking both of her hands and then over Rube's shoulder she sees Rose Viola,
and she says to Rose like this:</p>

<p>'Well, miss,' she says, 'that is a right neat strip you do out there just
now, although,' she says, 'you are mighty slow getting into it. You need
polishing in spots, and then you will be okay. Rube,' she says, 'speaking of
neat strips, who is the best you ever see?'</p>

<p>'Well,' Rube Goldstein says, 'if you are talking of the matter as art, I
will say that thirty years ago, if they happen to be holding any competitions
anywhere, I will be betting on you against the world, Laura.'</p>

<h3><a name="Bred_for_Battle" id="Bred_for_Battle">Bred for Battle</a></h3>
<p>One night a guy by the name of Bill Corum, who is one of these sport
scribes, gives me a Chinee for a fight at Madison Square Garden, a Chinee being
a ducket with holes punched in it like old-fashioned Chink money, to show that
it is a free ducket, and the reason I am explaining to you how I get this
ducket is because I do not wish anybody to think I am ever simple enough to
pay out my own potatoes for a ducket to a fight, even if I have any
potatoes.</p>

<p>Personally, I will not give you a bad two-bit piece to see a fight anywhere,
because the way I look at it, half the time the guys who are supposed to do the
fighting go in there and put on the old do-se-do, and I consider this a great
fraud upon the public, and I do not believe in encouraging dishonesty.</p>

<p>But of course I never refuse a Chinee to such events, because the way I
figure it, what can I lose except my time, and my time is not worth more than a
bob a week the way things are. So on the night in question I am standing in the
lobby of the Garden with many other citizens, and I am trying to find out if
there is any skullduggery doing in connection with the fight, because any time
there is any skullduggery doing I love to know it, as it is something worth
knowing in case a guy wishes to get a small wager down.</p>

<p>Well, while I am standing there, somebody comes up behind me and hits me an
awful belt on the back, knocking my wind plumb out of me, and making me very
indignant indeed. As soon as I get a little of my wind back again, I turn
around figuring to put a large blast on the guy who slaps me, but who is it but
a guy by the name of Spider McCoy, who is known far and wide as a manager of
fighters.</p>

<p>Well, of course I do not put the blast on Spider McCoy, because he is an old
friend of mine, and furthermore, Spider McCoy is such a guy as is apt to let a
left hook go at anybody who puts the blast on him, and I do not believe in
getting in trouble, especially with good left-hookers.</p>

<p>So I say hello to Spider, and am willing to let it go at that, but Spider
seems glad to see me, and says to me like this:</p>

<p>'Well, well, well, well, well!' Spider says.</p>

<p>'Well,' I say to Spider McCoy, 'how many wells does it take to make a
river?'</p>

<p>'One, if it is big enough,' Spider says, so I can see he knows the answer
all right. 'Listen,' he says, 'I just think up the greatest proposition I ever
think of in my whole life, and who knows but what I can interest you in
same.'</p>

<p>'Well, Spider,' I say, 'I do not care to hear any propositions at this time,
because it may be a long story, and I wish to step inside and see the impending
battle. Anyway,' I say, 'if it is a proposition involving financial support, I
wish to state that I do not have any resources whatever at this time.'</p>

<p>'Never mind the battle inside,' Spider says. 'It is nothing but a tank job,
anyway. And as for financial support,' Spider says, 'this does not require more
than a pound note, tops, and I know you have a pound note because I know you
put the bite on Overcoat Obie for this amount not an hour ago. Listen,' Spider
McCoy says, 'I know where I can place my hands on the greatest heavy-weight
prospect in the world to-day, and all I need is the price of car-fare to where
he is.'</p>

<p>Well, off and on, I know Spider McCoy twenty years, and in all this time I
never know him when he is not looking for the greatest heavy-weight prospect in
the world. And as long as Spider knows I have the pound note, I know there is
no use trying to play the duck for him, so I stand there wondering who the
stool pigeon can be who informs him of my financial status.</p>

<p>'Listen,' Spider says, 'I just discover that I am all out of line in the way
I am looking for heavy-weight prospects in the past. I am always looking for
nothing but plenty of size,' he says. 'Where I make my mistake is not looking
for blood lines. Professor D just smartens me up,' Spider says.</p>

<p>Well, when he mentions the name of Professor D, I commence taking a little
interest, because it is well known to one and all that Professor D is one of
the smartest old guys in the world. He is once a professor in a college out in
Ohio, but quits this dodge to handicap the horses, and he is a first-rate
handicapper, at that. But besides knowing how to handicap the horses, Professor
D knows many other things, and is highly respected in all walks of life,
especially on Broadway.</p>

<p>'Now then,' Spider says, 'Professor D calls my attention this afternoon to
the fact that when a guy is looking for a race horse, he does not take just any
horse that comes along, but he finds out if the horse's papa is able to run in
his day, and if the horse's mamma can get out of her own way when she is young.
Professor D shows me how a guy looks for speed in a horse's breeding away back
to its great-great-great-great-grandpa and grand-mamma,' Spider McCoy says.</p>

<p>'Well,' I say, 'anybody knows this without asking Professor D. In fact,' I
say, 'you even look up a horse's parents to see if they can mud before betting
on a plug to win in heavy going.'</p>

<p>'All right,' Spider says, 'I know all this myself, but I never think much
about it before Professor D mentions it. Professor D says if a guy is looking
for a hunting dog he does not pick a Pekingese pooch, but he gets a dog that is
bred to hunt from away back yonder, and if he is after a game chicken he does
not take a Plymouth Rock out of the back-yard.</p>

<p>'So then,' Spider says, 'Professor D wishes to know if when I am looking for
a fighter, if I do not look for one who comes of fighting stock. Professor D
wishes to know,' Spider says, 'why I do not look for some guy who is bred to
fight, and when I think this over, I can see the professor is right.</p>

<p>'And then all of a sudden,' Spider says, 'I get the largest idea I ever have
in all my life. Do you remember a guy I have about twenty years back by the
name of Shamus Mulrooney, the Fighting Harp?' Spider says. 'A big, rough, tough
heavy-weight out of Newark?'</p>

<p>'Yes,' I say, 'I remember Shamus very well indeed. The last time I see him
is the night Pounder Pat O'Shea almost murders him in the old Garden,' I say.
'I never see a guy with more ticker than Shamus, unless maybe it is Pat.'</p>

<p>'Yes,' Spider says, 'Shamus has plenty of ticker. He is about through the
night of the fight you speak of, otherwise Pat will never lay a glove on him.
It is not long after this fight that Shamus packs in and goes back to
brick-laying in Newark, and it is also about this same time,' Spider says,
'that he marries Pat O'Shea's sister, Bridget.</p>

<p>'Well, now,' Spider says, 'I remember they have a boy who must be around
nineteen years old now, and if ever a guy is bred to fight it is a boy by
Shamus Mulrooney out of Bridget O'Shea, because,' Spider says, 'Bridget herself
can lick half the heavy-weights I see around nowadays if she is half as good as
she is the last time I see her. So now you have my wonderful idea. We will go
to Newark and get this boy and make him heavy-weight champion of the
world.'</p>

<p>'What you state is very interesting indeed, Spider,' I say. 'But,' I say,
'how do you know this boy is a heavy-weight?'</p>

<p>'Why,' Spider says, 'how can he be anything else but a heavyweight, what
with his papa as big as a house, and his mamma weighing maybe a hundred and
seventy pounds in her step-ins? Although of course,' Spider says, 'I never see
Bridget weigh in in such manner.</p>

<p>'But,' Spider says, 'even if she does carry more weight than I will
personally care to spot a doll, Bridget is by no means a pelican when she
marries Shamus. In fact,' he says, 'she is pretty good-looking. I remember
their wedding well, because it comes out that Bridget is in love with some
other guy at the time, and this guy comes to see the nuptials, and Shamus runs
him all the way from Newark to Elizabeth, figuring to break a couple of legs
for the guy if he catches him. But,' Spider says, 'the guy is too speedy for
Shamus, who never has much foot anyway.'</p>

<p>Well, all that Spider says appeals to me as a very sound business
proposition, so the upshot of it is I give him my pound note to finance his
trip to Newark.</p>

<p>Then I do not see Spider McCoy again for a week, but one day he calls me up
and tells me to hurry over to the Pioneer gymnasium to see the next
heavy-weight champion of the world, Thunderbolt Mulrooney.</p>

<p>I am personally somewhat disappointed when I see Thunderbolt Mulrooney, and
especially when I find out his first name is Raymond and not Thunderbolt at
all, because I am expecting to see a big, fierce guy with red hair and a chest
like a barrel, such as Shamus Mulrooney has when he is in his prime. But who do
I see but a tall, pale-looking young guy with blond hair and thin legs.</p>

<p>Furthermore, he has pale blue eyes, and a far-away look in them, and he
speaks in a low voice, which is nothing like the voice of Shamus Mulrooney. But
Spider seems satisfied with Thunderbolt, and when I tell him Thunderbolt does
not look to me like the next heavy-weight champion of the world, Spider says
like this:</p>

<p>'Why,' he says, 'the guy is nothing but a baby, and you must give him time
to fill out. He may grow to be bigger than his papa. But you know,' Spider
says, getting indignant as he thinks about it, 'Bridget Mulrooney does not wish
to let this guy be the next heavyweight champion of the world. In fact,' Spider
says, 'she kicks up an awful row when I go to get him, and Shamus finally has
to speak to her severely. Shamus says he does not know if I can ever make a
fighter of this guy because Bridget coddles him until he is nothing but a
mush-head, and Shamus says he is sick and tired of seeing the guy sitting
around the house doing nothing but reading and playing the zither.'</p>

<p>'Does he play the zither yet?' I ask Spider McCoy.</p>

<p>'No,' Spider says, 'I do not allow my fighters to play zithers. I figure it
softens them up. This guy does not play anything at present. He seems to be in
a daze most of the time, but of course everything is new to him. He is bound to
come out okay, because,' Spider says, 'he is certainly bred right. I find out
from Shamus that all the Mulrooneys are great fighters back in the old
country,' Spider says, 'and furthermore he tells me Bridget's mother once licks
four Newark cops who try to stop her from pasting her old man, so,' Spider
says, 'this lad is just naturally steaming with fighting blood.'</p>

<p>Well, I drop around to the Pioneer once or twice a week after this, and
Spider McCoy is certainly working hard with Thunderbolt Mulrooney. Furthermore,
the guy seems to be improving right along, and gets so he can box fairly well
and punch the bag, and all this and that, but he always has that far-away look
in his eyes, and personally I do not care for fighters with far-away looks.</p>

<p>Finally one day Spider calls me up and tells me he has Thunderbolt Mulrooney
matched in a four-round preliminary bout at the St. Nick with a guy by the name
of Bubbles Browning, who is fighting almost as far back as the first battle of
Bull Run, so I can see Spider is being very careful in matching Thunderbolt. In
fact I congratulate Spider on his carefulness.</p>

<p>'Well,' Spider says, 'I am taking this match just to give Thunderbolt the
feel of the ring. I am taking Bubbles because he is an old friend of mine, and
very deserving, and furthermore,' Spider says, 'he gives me his word he will
not hit Thunderbolt very hard and will become unconscious the instant
Thunderbolt hits him. You know,' Spider says, 'you must encourage a young
heavy-weight, and there is nothing that encourages one so much as knocking
somebody unconscious.'</p>

<p>Now of course it is nothing for Bubbles to promise not to hit anybody very
hard because even when he is a young guy, Bubbles cannot punch his way out of a
paper bag, but I am glad to learn that he also promises to become unconscious
very soon, as naturally I am greatly interested in Thunderbolt's career, what
with owning a piece of him, and having an investment of one pound in him
already.</p>

<p>So the night of the fight, I am at the St. Nick very early, and many other
citizens are there ahead of me, because by this time Spider McCoy gets plenty
of publicity for Thunderbolt by telling the boxing scribes about his wonderful
fighting blood lines, and everybody wishes to see a guy who is bred for battle,
like Thunderbolt.</p>

<p>I take a guest with me to the fight by the name of Harry the Horse, who
comes from Brooklyn, and as I am anxious to help Spider McCoy all I can, as
well as to protect my investment in Thunderbolt, I request Harry to call on
Bubbles Browning in his dressing-room and remind him of his promise about
hitting Thunderbolt.</p>

<p>Harry the Horse does this for me, and furthermore he shows Bubbles a large
revolver and tells Bubbles that he will be compelled to shoot his ears off if
Bubbles forgets his promise, but Bubbles says all this is most unnecessary, as
his eyesight is so bad he cannot see to hit anybody, anyway.</p>

<p>Well, I know a party who is a friend of the guy who is going to referee the
preliminary bouts, and I am looking for this party to get him to tell the
referee to disqualify Bubbles in case it looks as if he is forgetting his
promise and is liable to hit Thunderbolt, but before I can locate the party,
they are announcing the opening bout, and there is Thunderbolt in the ring
looking very far away indeed, with Spider McCoy behind him.</p>

<p>It seems to me I never see a guy who is so pale all over as Thunderbolt
Mulrooney, but Spider looks down at me and tips me a large wink, so I can see
that everything is as right as rain, especially when Harry the Horse makes
motions at Bubbles Browning like a guy firing a large revolver at somebody, and
Bubbles smiles, and also winks.</p>

<p>Well, when the bell rings, Spider gives Thunderbolt a shove towards the
centre, and Thunderbolt comes out with his hands up, but looking more far away
than somewhat, and something tells me that Thunderbolt by no means feels the
killer instinct such as I love to see in fighters. In fact, something tells me
that Thunderbolt is not feeling enthusiastic about this proposition in any way,
shape, manner, or form.</p>

<p>Old Bubbles almost falls over his own feet coming out of his corner, and he
starts bouncing around making passes at Thunderbolt, and waiting for
Thunderbolt to hit him so he can become unconscious. Naturally, Bubbles does
not wish to become unconscious without getting hit, as this may look suspicious
to the public.</p>

<p>Well, instead of hitting Bubbles, what does Thunderbolt Mulrooney do but
turn around and walk over to a neutral corner, and lean over the ropes with his
face in his gloves, and bust out crying. Naturally, this is a most surprising
incident to one and all, and especially to Bubbles Browning.</p>

<p>The referee walks over to Thunderbolt Mulrooney and tries to turn him around,
but Thunderbolt keeps his face in his gloves and sobs so loud that the referee
is deeply touched and starts sobbing with him. Between the sobs he asks
Thunderbolt if he wishes to continue the fight, and Thunderbolt shakes his
head, although as a matter of fact no fight whatever starts so far, so the
referee declares Bubbles Browning the winner, which is a terrible surprise to
Bubbles.</p>

<p>Then the referee puts his arm around Thunderbolt and leads him over to
Spider McCoy, who is standing in his corner with a very strange expression on
his face. Personally, I consider the entire spectacle so revolting that I go
out into the air, and stand around a while expecting to hear any minute that
Spider McCoy is in the hands of the gendarmes on a charge of mayhem.</p>

<p>But it seems that nothing happens, and when Spider finally comes out of the
St. Nick, he is only looking sorrowful because he just hears that the promoter
declines to pay him the fifty bobs he is supposed to receive for Thunderbolt's
services, the promoter claiming that Thunderbolt renders no service.</p>

<p>'Well,' Spider says, 'I fear this is not the next heavy-weight champion of
the world after all. There is nothing in Professor D's idea about blood lines
as far as fighters are concerned, although,' he says, 'it may work out all
right with horses and dogs, and one thing and another. I am greatly
disappointed,' Spider says, 'but then I am always being disappointed in
heavy-weights. There is nothing we can do but take this guy back home,
because,' Spider says, 'the last thing I promise Bridget Mulrooney is that I
will personally return him to her in case I am not able to make him
heavy-weight champion, as she is afraid he will get lost if he tries to find
his way home alone.'</p>

<p>So the next day, Spider McCoy and I take Thunderbolt Mulrooney over to
Newark and to his home, which turns out to be a nice little house in a side
street with a yard all round and about, and Spider and I are just as well
pleased that old Shamus Mulrooney is absent when we arrive, because Spider says
that Shamus is just such a guy as will be asking a lot of questions about the
fifty bobbos that Thunderbolt does not get.</p>

<p>Well, when we reach the front door of the house, out comes a big,
fine-looking doll with red cheeks, all excited, and she takes Thunderbolt in
her arms and kisses him, so I know this is Bridget Mulrooney, and I can see she
knows what happens, and in fact I afterward learn that Thunderbolt telephones
her the night before.</p>

<p>After a while she pushes Thunderbolt into the house and stands at the door
as if she is guarding it against us entering to get him again, which of course
is very unnecessary. And all this time Thunderbolt is sobbing no little,
although by and by the sobs die away, and from somewhere in the house comes the
sound of music I seem to recognize as the music of a zither.</p>

<p>Well, Bridget Mulrooney never says a word to us as she stands in the door,
and Spider McCoy keeps staring at her in a way that I consider very rude
indeed. I am wondering if he is waiting for a receipt for Thunderbolt, but
finally he speaks as follows:</p>

<p>'Bridget,' Spider says, 'I hope and trust that you will not consider me too
fresh, but I wish to learn the name of the guy you are going around with just
before you marry Shamus. I remember him well,' Spider says, 'but I cannot think
of his name, and it bothers me not being able to think of names. He is a tall,
skinny, stoop-shouldered guy,' Spider says, 'with a hollow chest and a soft
voice, and he loves music.'</p>

<p>Well, Bridget Mulrooney stands there in the doorway, staring back at Spider,
and it seems to me that the red suddenly fades out of her cheeks, and just then
we hear a lot of yelling, and around the corner of the house comes a bunch of
five or six kids, who seem to be running from another kid.</p>

<p>This kid is not very big, and is maybe fifteen or sixteen years old, and he
has red hair and many freckles, and he seems very mad at the other kids. In
fact, when he catches up with them he starts belting away at them with his
fists and before anybody can as much as say boo, he has three of them on the
ground as flat as pancakes, while the others are yelling bloody murder.</p>

<p>Personally, I never see such wonderful punching by a kid, especially with
his left hand, and Spider McCoy is also much impressed, and is watching the kid
with great interest. Then Bridget Mulrooney runs out and grabs the
freckle-faced kid with one hand and smacks him with the other hand and hauls
him, squirming and kicking, over to Spider McCoy and says to Spider like
this:</p>

<p>'Mr. McCoy,' Bridget says, 'this is my youngest son, Terence, and though he
is not a heavy-weight, and will never be a heavyweight, perhaps he will answer
your purpose. Suppose you see his father about him sometime,' she says, 'and
hoping you will learn to mind your own business, I wish you a very good
day.'</p>

<p>Then she takes the kid into the house under her arm and slams the door in
our kissers, and there is nothing for us to do but walk away. And as we are
walking away, all of a sudden Spider McCoy snaps his fingers as guys will do
when they get an unexpected thought, and says like this:</p>

<p>'I remember the guy's name,' he says. 'It is Cedric Tilbury, and he is a
floor-walker in Hamburgher's department store, and,' Spider says, 'how he can
play the zither!'</p>

<p>I see in the papers the other day where Jimmy Johnston, the match-maker at
the Garden, matches Tearing Terry Mulrooney, the new sensation of the
light-weight division, to fight for the championship, but it seems from what
Spider McCoy tells me that my investment with him does not cover any fighters
in his stable except maybe heavy-weights.</p>

<p>And it also seems that Spider McCoy is not monkeying with heavy-weights
since he gets Tearing Terry.</p>

<h3><a name="Too_Much_Pep" id="Too_Much_Pep">Too Much Pep</a></h3>
<p>It is really surprising how many wicked people there are in this world, and
especially along East 114th Street up in Harlem.</p>

<p>Of course I do not say that all the wicked people in the world are along
East 114th Street, because some of them are on East 115th Street, and maybe on
East 116th Street, too, but the wicked people on East 114th Street are wickeder
than somewhat, especially Ignazio Vardarelli and his mob.</p>

<p>This Ignazio Vardarelli is called Ignaz the Wolf, and he is an Italian party
from Calabria, with a noggin shaped like the little end of an ice-cream cone,
and a lot of scars on his face which make him look very fierce. All his mob are
also Italians, and most of them have noggins shaped like Ignaz', and some of
them have even more scars on their kissers, and therefore look even fiercer
than he does, which is very, very fierce, indeed.</p>

<p>Now Ignaz the Wolf is a guy who never works, and neither does anybody else
in his mob, and what they do for a living is very simple, and I do not mind
saying I am sorry I never have the nerve to invent something as easy, because
after all work is a great bother.</p>

<p>In Harlem there are a great many Italians, and among them are quite a lot of
Moustache Petes, who are old time Italians with large black moustaches, and who
have little stores in cellars and such places and sell spaghetti, and macaroni
and cheeses, and other articles of which Italian persons are very fond. I like
spaghetti myself now and then, and also pasta fagiole, and broccoli, cooked
with garlic, which is very good for the old stomach.</p>

<p>In fact, it is because I like such things that I come to hear about Ignazio
Vardarelli, because I often go to a spot in Harlem where a guy can get good
Italian food, especially devil-fish fixed a certain way, and maybe a little red
wine which the guy who owns the joint makes right in his own cellar by walking
up and down in his bare feet in a tub of grapes. In fact, one time when the guy
has very painful corns on his feet, and cannot walk up and down in the tub of
grapes, I take off my shoes and walk for him, but whoever sells him the grapes
leaves a big rock among them, and I get a bad stone bruise from it on my
heel.</p>

<p>There are always some very nice Italian people sitting around and about this
joint, and I love to listen to them eat spaghetti, and talk, though I do not
understand much of what they are saying because Italian is one language I never
learn. In fact, I never learn any other language except English, and a very
little bit of Yiddish, because a guy who lives in New York can get around most
anywhere on these two languages, with a few signs mixed up with them.</p>

<p>Anyway, I have a lot of very good friends among the Italians, and I never
speak of them as wops, or guineas, or dagoes, or grease-balls, because I
consider this most disrespectful, like calling Jewish people mockies, or Heebs,
or geese. The way I look at it, if a guy is respectful to one and all, why, one
and all will be respectful to him, and anyway, there are many Italians, and
Jewish people too, who are apt to haul off and knock you bow-legged if you call
them such names.</p>

<p>Well, all these Moustache Petes I am talking about are very industrious, and
very saving, and most of them have a few bobs laid away for a rainy day, so
when Ignaz the Wolf feels that he needs a little money to take care of his
overhead, he picks out some Moustache Pete that he figures is able to
contribute and writes him a nice letter about as follows:</p>

<p>'Dear Joe' (or maybe Tony, for most Italians are called Joe or Tony),
'please call and see me with five hundred dollars. Yours sincerely,
Ignazio.'</p>

<p>Then Ignazio waits two or three days, and if Joe or Tony does not show up
with the five yards, or whatever it is that Ignazio asks for, Ignazio writes
him another letter, which is a sort of follow-up letter, the same as any
business concern sends out to a customer, and this follow-up letter is about as
follows:</p>

<p>'Dear Joe' (or Tony), 'I am sorry to hear you have a headache. I figure you
must have a headache, because you do not call to see me with the five hundred
dollars. I hope and trust you get over this headache very soon, as I am waiting
for the five hundred. With kindest regards, I am yours truly, Ignazio.'</p>

<p>He puts a black mark on this letter, and shoves it under Joe or Tony's door,
and then he waits a couple of days more. By this time Ignaz the Wolf is
naturally getting a little bit impatient, because he is a good business man,
and business men like to see their letters receive prompt attention. If he gets
no answer from Joe or Tony, there is nothing else for Ignaz the Wolf to do but
put a little bomb under the joint where the Moustache Pete lives to remind him
of the letter, and very few of Ignaz's customers wait any longer to settle
after the first bomb.</p>

<p>So Ignaz the Wolf and his mob do very well for themselves and are able to
wear good clothes, and jewellery, and sit around eating spaghetti and drinking
dago red and having a nice time generally, and everybody that sees them says
hello, very pleasant, even including the Moustache Petes, although of course
the chances are they are not on the level with their hellos and secretly hope
that Ignaz falls over dead.</p>

<p>Personally, I never hear much of Ignaz the Wolf until I run into a young
Italian guy in the Harlem eating-joint by the name of Marco Sciarra, or some
such, who is a very legitimate guy up in Harlem, being in the artichoke
business with his old man. It seems that the artichoke business is a
first-class business in Harlem, though personally I will not give you ten cents
for all the artichokes you can pack in the Hudson tubes, as I consider them a
very foolish fruit any way you look at them. But Marco and his old man do very
good with artichokes, and in fact they do so well that Marco is able to play
plenty of horses, which is how I come to get acquainted with him, because it is
well known to one and all that I am one of the greatest horse players in New
York, and will be a very rich guy if it is not for crooked jockeys riding the
horses different from the way I dope them.</p>

<p>Anyway, one night Marco somehow starts beefing about Ignaz the Wolf and his
mob, and finally he lets it out that Ignaz is trying to put the arm on him and
his old man for five G's, for no reason except that Ignaz seems to need it.</p>

<p>Now Marco is born and raised right here in this man's town, and he is quite
an all-round guy in many respects, and he is certainly not the kind of guy
anybody with any sense will figure a chump. He is not the kind of a guy a smart
guy will figure to hold still for five G's for no reason, and the chances are
Ignaz the Wolf is not thinking of Marco in the first place. The chances are he
is thinking more of Marco's old man, who is a Moustache Pete in every way.</p>

<p>Furthermore, if it is left to the old man, he will kick in the five G's to
Ignaz without a yip, just to avoid trouble, but Marco can see where he can use
any stray five G's himself to pay off a few bookmakers. Anyway, Marco tells me
he will see Ignaz in the place where Ignaz is a sure thing to go some day
before he will give up five G's, or any part of five G's, and I say I do not
blame him, for five G's is plenty of sugar, even if you do not have it.</p>

<p>This is the last I see of Marco for a couple of weeks. Then one day I happen
to be in Harlem, so I go over to his place of business on East 114th Street.
The Marcos have an office on the ground floor of a two-story building, and live
upstairs, and when I get there I notice that the glass in all the windows seems
to be out, and that things are generally upset.</p>

<p>Well, when I find Marco he explains to me that somebody puts a
fifteen-dollar bomb in the joint the night before, and while Marco does not say
right out that Ignaz the Wolf does this, he says he is willing to lay 8 to 5
and take Ignaz against the field, because it seems he sends word to Ignaz that
he need not expect the five G's he is looking for.</p>

<p>Then Marco explains to me that the fifteen-dollar bomb is only meant as a
sort of convincer, and that according to the rules Ignaz will next put a
thirty-two-dollar bomb in the joint, which will be a little more powerful than
the fifteen-dollar bomb. In fact, Marco says, the thirty-two-dollar bomb will
be powerful enough to lift them out of their beds upstairs a foot to a foot and
a half. But finally, if the five G's is not paid to Ignaz the Wolf in the
meantime, he will put a fifty-dollar bomb under them, and this bomb will
practically ruin everything in the neighbourhood, including the neighbours.</p>

<p>Well, naturally I am very indignant about the whole proposition, but Marco
says it is only fair to Ignaz the Wolf to say he writes them a couple of very
polite letters before he makes a move, and does nothing whatever underhand
before sending the bomb.</p>

<p>'But my old man is now very much displeased with Ignaz,' Marco says. 'He is
even more displeased than I am. It takes quite a little to displease my old
man, but when he is displeased, he is certainly greatly displeased, indeed. In
fact,' Marco says, 'my old man and other Italian citizens of Harlem hold a
meeting to-day, and they come to the conclusion that it is for the best
interests of the community to have Ignaz put in his place before he cleans
everybody out. So they are going to put Ignaz in his place.'</p>

<p>'Well,' I say, 'what is Ignaz's place?'</p>

<p>'Ignaz's place is six feet underground,' Marco says, 'and this is where the
citizens are going to put him.'</p>

<p>'Why, Marco,' I say, 'this is most horrifying, indeed, although personally I
am in favour of it. But,' I say, 'I do not think Ignaz will care to be put in
his place, and as he is well mobbed I do not see how it can be brought about
without somebody getting in trouble. I hope and trust, Marco,' I say, 'that
neither you or your old man are going to get tangled up in this
proposition.'</p>

<p>'No,' Marco says, 'we will not get tangled up. In fact, nobody in Harlem
will get tangled up, because they are sending to Sicily for a certain party to
put Ignaz in his place. They are sending for Don Pep'.'</p>

<p>Well, I finally make out from what Marco tells me that at this meeting many
of the old-fashioned Italians of Harlem are present, with their moustaches
sticking right out straight with indignation, and it is the opinion of one and
all that Ignaz shall be put in his place as quickly as possible. But Marco says
there is quite a difference of opinion as to who shall put Ignaz in his place,
and the meeting lasts a long time, and there is plenty of argument.</p>

<p>It seems that all of these old-timers know of some party back in Italy that
they figure is just the one to put Ignaz in his place, and they get up and make
speeches about their guys as if they are delegates to a convention boosting
candidates for a nice nomination.</p>

<p>Marco says an old Moustache Pete by the name of Bianchini, who is a
shoemaker, almost carries the meeting in favour of a guy by the name of Corri,
who, it seems, makes a great showing putting parties in their places around
Napoli, and who is favourably remembered by many of the citizens present. Marco
says old Bianchini is a good speaker and he talks for almost an hour telling
about how this guy puts parties in their places by slipping a little short rope
around their necks, and guzzling them before they have time to say Jack
Robinson, and it is commencing to look as if Corri is the guy, when Marco's old
man steps forward and raises his hand to stop all of this cheering for
Corri.</p>

<p>'I will not take up much of your time in presenting the name of my choice,'
Marco says his old man says. 'It is a name that is well known to many of you
older delegates. It is the name of one who has made history at putting parties
in their places, the name of a celebrated citizen of Sicily, experienced and
skilful in his calling a name that is above reproach. I give you, fellow
citizens, the name of "Don Pep", of Siracusa.'</p>

<p>Well, at this everybody becomes very enthusiastic, Marco says, and also
their blood runs cold, because it seems that Don Pep' is for many years the
outstanding man in all Italy at putting parties in their places. All the
old-timers know of him by reputation, and some of them even see him when they
are young guys back in the old country, while Marco's old man knows him
personally.</p>

<p>It seems that Don Pep' has a record like a prize fighter, and Marco's old
man reads this record to the meeting, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>Milan, 1899, 2 men <br>Venice, 1904, 1 man <br>Naples, 1909, 3 men <br>Rome, 1913, 1 man
<br>Genoa, 1921, 2 men, 4 horses <br>Nice, 1928, 1 man</blockquote>

<p>Well, when the thing comes to a vote, Don Pep' gets all the votes but one,
old Bianchini sticking to Corri, and the meeting adjourns with everybody
satisfied that Ignaz the Wolf is to be put in his place in first-class
style.</p>

<p>Now getting Don Pep' over to this country to put Ignaz in his place is going
to cost something, so Marco, seeing a chance to turn a few honest bobs,
propositions his old man to get Ignaz put in his place for about half of what
Don Pep' will cost, Marco figuring that he can find a couple of guys downtown
who are willing to work cheap, but his old man refuses to listen to him. His
old man says this business must be transacted in a dignified way, and under the
old-fashioned rules, though Marco says he does not see what difference it makes
if a guy is to be put in his place whether it is under the old-fashioned rules
or the new no-foul system, especially as nobody explains the old-fashioned
rules, or seems to know what they are.</p>

<p>Personally, if I am planning to get a guy put in his place I will not go
around telling people about it. In fact, I will keep it a very great secret for
fear the guy may hear of it and take steps, but these Moustache Petes make no
bones whatever about sending for Don Pep', and everybody in the neighbourhood
knows it, including Ignaz the Wolf and his mob. I figure that maybe the
Moustache Petes want Ignaz to know it, thinking he may decide to haul ashes out
of Harlem before anything happens to him, but Ignaz is a pretty bold guy one
way and another, and he only laughs about Don Pep'. Ignaz says Don Pep' is old
stuff, and may go in Italy years ago, but not in the U.S.A. in these times.</p>

<p>Naturally, I am greatly interested in Don Pep', and I make Marco promise to
tell me when he arrives. I love to look at a top-notcher in any line, and I
judge from Don Pep's record that he is a champion of the world. So some weeks
later when I get a telephone call from Marco that Don Pep' is here, I hurry up
to Harlem and meet Marco, and he promises to show me Don Pep' after it gets
dark, because it seems Don Pep' moves around only at night.</p>

<p>He is living in the basement of a tenement house in East 114th Street with
an old Sicilian by the name of Sutari, who is a real Moustache Pete and who has
a shoe-shining joint downtown. He is a nice old man, and a good friend of mine,
though afterward I hear he is a tough guy back in his old home town in
Sicily.</p>

<p>Well, when I get a peek at Don Pep', I almost bust out laughing, for what is
he but a little old man wearing a long black coat that trails the ground, and a
funny flat black hat with a low crown and a stiff brim. He looks to me like
somebody out of a play, especially as he has long white hair and bushy white
whiskers all over his face like a poodle dog.</p>

<p>But when I get close to him, I do not feel so much like laughing, because he
raises his head and stares at me through the whiskers and I see a pair of black
eyes like a snake's eyes, with a look in them such as gives me the shivers all
over. Personally, I never see such a look in anybody's eyes before in my life,
and I am very glad indeed to walk briskly away from Don Pep'.</p>

<p>I peek back over my shoulder, and Don Pep' is standing there with his head
bowed on his chest, as harmless-looking as a rabbit, and I feel like laughing
again at the idea of such an old guy being brought all the way from Sicily to
put Ignaz the Wolf in his place. Then I think of those eyes, and start
shivering harder than ever, and Marco shivers with me and explains to me what
happens when Don Pep' first arrives, and since.</p>

<p>It seems that Marco's old man and a lot of other Moustache Petes meet Don
Pep' at the boat that brings him from Sicily, and they are wishing to entertain
him, but Don Pep' says he is not here for pleasure, and all they can do for him
is to show him the guy he is to put in his place. Well, naturally, nobody
wishes to put the finger on Ignaz the Wolf in public, because Ignaz may
remember same, and feel hurt about it, so they give Don Pep' a description of
Ignaz, and his address, which is a cigar store on East 114th Street, where
Ignaz and his mob always hang out.</p>

<p>A few hours later when Ignaz is sitting in the cigar store playing klob with
some of his mob, in comes Don Pep', all bundled up in his black coat, though it
is a warm night, at that. He has a way of walking along very slow, and he is
always tap-tapping on the sidewalk ahead of him with a big cane, like a blind
man, but his feet never make a sound.</p>

<p>Well, naturally Ignaz the Wolf jumps up when such a strange-looking party
bobs in on him, for Ignaz can see that this must be Don Pep', the guy who is
coming to put him in his place, and knowing where his place is, Ignaz is
probably on the look-out for Don Pep', anyway. So Ignaz stands there with his
cards in his hand staring at Don Pep', and Don Pep' walks right up to him, and
shoots his head up out of his cloak collar like a turtle and looks Ignaz in the
eye.</p>

<p>He never says one word to Ignaz, and while Ignaz tries to think of something
smart to say to Don Pep', he cannot make his tongue move a lick. He is like a
guy who is hypnotized. The other guys at the table sit there looking at Ignaz
and Don Pep', and never making a wrong move, though on form anyone of them
figures to out with the old equalizer and plug Don Pep'. Finally, after maybe
three minutes hand running of looking at Ignaz, Don Pep' suddenly makes a noise
with his mouth like a snake hissing, and then he turns and walks out of the
joint, tap-tapping with his cane ahead of him.</p>

<p>After he is gone, Ignaz comes up for air, and starts explaining why he does
not do something about Don Pep', but even Ignaz's own mobsters figure the old
guy runs something of a sandy on Ignaz. What puzzles them no little is that Don
Pep' makes no move to put Ignaz in his place then and there, as long as he
comes all the way from Sicily to do it.</p>

<p>But two nights later, when Ignaz the Wolf is again playing klob in the cigar
store, who pops in but old Don Pep', and once more he stands looking Ignaz in
the eye and never saying as much as howdy. This time Ignaz manages to get a few
words out but Don Pep' never answers him, and winds up his looking at Ignaz
with that same hissing sound, like a snake. After this Ignaz does not keep his
old hours around the cigar store, but he starts in getting very tough with the
Moustache Petes, and writing them very stiff business notes about sending in
their contributions.</p>

<p>Well, it seems that the citizens around and about get very independent after
Don Pep' arrives, and commence paying no attention to Ignaz's notes, and even
take to giving Ignaz's collectors the old ha-ha, in Italian, which burns Ignaz
up quite some. He complains that Don Pep' is hurting his business, and lets it
out here and there that after he takes care of Don Pep' he is going to make his
old customers very sorry that they ignore him. But somehow Ignaz does not put
any more bombs around, except a few fifteen-dollar ones on guys who do not
count much.</p>

<p>In the meantime, old Don Pep' goes walking up and down the streets, his
whiskers down in his cloak collar, no matter how warm it gets, and the citizens
lift their hats to him as he passes by. In fact, I lift my own lid one evening
when he passes me, because I feel that a guy with his record is entitled to
much respect. But knowing Ignaz the Wolf, I figure it is only a question of
time when we will be walking slow behind the old guy, especially as he does not
seem to be making any kind of move to put Ignaz in his place, per
agreement.</p>

<p>Always late at night Don Pep' stands in front of an areaway between the
tenement house where he lives and the house next door, leaning up against a
sort of iron grating that walls off the areaway from the street. It happens
that no light shines on the areaway, so all you see as you pass by is a sort of
outline of Don Pep' against the grating, and now and then a little glow as he
puffs at a cigarette through his whiskers. He is certainly a strange-looking
old crocodile, and I often wonder what he is thinking about as he stands
there.</p>

<p>I can see now how smart the Moustache Petes are in making no secret of what
Don Pep' is here for, because the publicity he gets keeps Ignaz the Wolf from
doing anything to him. Naturally if anything drastic happens to Don Pep', the
coppers will figure Ignaz responsible, and the coppers in this town are waiting
for several years to find something drastic that Ignaz is responsible for.</p>

<p>But there is no doubt Ignaz the Wolf is getting sick and tired of Don Pep',
especially since business is so bad, so one night the thing that is a sure
thing to happen comes off. An automobile tears past the spot where Don Pep' is
standing, as usual, in front of the areaway, and out of this automobile comes a
big blooey-blooey, with four guys letting go with sawed-off shotguns at
once.</p>

<p>As the automobile cuts in close to the kerb, this puts the gunners only the
distance across the sidewalk from Don Pep', so there is little chance that four
guys using shotguns are going to miss, especially as the shotguns are loaded
with buckshot, which scatters nice and wide.</p>

<p>Well, there are very few citizens around the spot at this hour, and they
start running away lickity-split as soon as they hear the first blooey, because
the citizens of this part of Harlem know that a blooey is never going to do
anybody much good. But before they start running, some of the citizens see old
Don Pep' fold up in a little black pile in front of the areaway as the
automobile tears on down the street, with Ignaz the Wolf sitting back in it
laughing very heartily. I will say one thing for Ignaz, that when it comes down
to cases, he is always ready to go out on his own jobs himself, although this
is mainly because he wishes to see that the jobs are well done.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later, Ignaz is walking into the cigar store so as to be playing
klob and looking very innocent when the coppers come around to speak to him
about the matter of Don Pep'. And he is no sooner inside the joint than right
at his heels steps nobody in all this world but Don Pep', who has a licence to
be laying up against the areaway grating as dead as a doornail.</p>

<p>Well, old Don Pep' is huddled up in his cape and whiskers as usual, but he
seems to be stepping spryer than somewhat, and as Ignaz the Wolf turns around
and sees him and lets out a yell, thinking he is seeing a ghost, Don Pep'
closes in on him and grabs Ignaz as if he is giving him a nice hearty hug.
Ignaz the Wolf screams once very loud, and the next thing anybody knows he is
stretched out on the floor as stiff as a board and Don Pep' is stepping out of
the cigar store.</p>

<p>Nobody ever sees Don Pep' again as far as I know, although the coppers still
have the straw-stuffed black suit, and the black hat and cape, as well as the
false whiskers with which Sutari, the shoe shiner, fixes up a phony Don Pep' to
lean against the areaway grating for Ignaz the Wolf and his gunners to waste
their buckshot on, because it seems from what Sutari says that Don Pep' carries
two outfits of clothes for just such a purpose. Personally, I consider this
very deceitful of Don Pep', but nobody else seems to see anything wrong in
it.</p>

<p>Well, when the croakers examine Ignaz's body they do not find a mark of any
kind on him, and they are greatly puzzled indeed, because naturally they expect
to find a knife or maybe a darning-needle sticking in him. But there is nothing
whatever to show what makes Ignaz the Wolf die, and Marco tells me afterward
that his old man and all the other Moustache Petes are laughing very heartily
at the idea that Don Pep' uses any such articles.</p>

<p>Marco tells me his old man says if the croakers have any sense they will see
at once that Ignaz the Wolf dies of heart disease, and Marco says his old man
claims anybody ought to know this heart disease is caused by fright because Don
Pep' is putting guys in their places in such a way for many years. Furthermore,
Marco says his old man states that this is according to the old-fashioned
rules, and very dignified, though if you ask me I think it is a dirty trick to
scare a guy to death.</p>

<h3><a name="Baseball_Hattie" id="Baseball_Hattie">Baseball Hattie</a></h3>
<p>It comes on spring-time, and the little birdies are singing in the trees in
Central Park, and the grass is green all around and about, and I am at the Polo
Grounds on the opening day of the baseball season, when who do I behold but
Baseball Hattie. I am somewhat surprised at this spectacle, as it is years
since I see Baseball Hattie, and for all I know she long ago passes to a better
and happier world.</p>

<p>But there she is, as large as life, and in fact twenty pounds larger, and
when I call the attention of Armand Fibleman, the gambler, to her, he gets up
and tears right out of the joint as if he sees a ghost, for if there is one
thing Armand Fibleman loathes and despises, it is a ghost.</p>

<p>I can see that Baseball Hattie is greatly changed, and to tell the truth, I
can see that she is getting to be nothing but an old bag. Her hair that is once
as black as a yard up a stove-pipe is grey, and she is wearing gold-rimmed
cheaters, although she seems to be pretty well dressed and looks as if she may
be in the money a little bit, at that.</p>

<p>But the greatest change in her is the way she sits there very quiet all
afternoon, never once opening her yap, even when many of the customers around
her are claiming that Umpire William Klem is Public Enemy No. 1 to 16
inclusive, because they think he calls a close one against the Giants. I am
wondering if maybe Baseball Hattie is stricken dumb somewhere back down the
years, because I can remember when she is usually making speeches in the
grandstand in favour of hanging such characters as Umpire William Klem when
they call close ones against the Giants. But Hattie just sits there as if she
is in a church while the public clamour goes on about her, and she does not as
much as cry out robber, or even you big bum at Umpire William Klem.</p>

<p>I see many a baseball bug in my time, male and female, but without doubt the
worst bug of them all is Baseball Hattie, and you can say it again. She is most
particularly a bug about the Giants, and she never misses a game they play at
the Polo Grounds, and in fact she sometimes bobs up watching them play in other
cities, which is always very embarrassing to the Giants, as they fear the
customers in these cities may get the wrong impression of New York womanhood
after listening to Baseball Hattie a while.</p>

<p>The first time I ever see Baseball Hattie to pay any attention to her is in
Philadelphia, a matter of twenty-odd years back, when the Giants are playing a
series there, and many citizens of New York, including Armand Fibleman and
myself, are present, because the Philadelphia customers are great hands for
betting on baseball games in those days, and Armand Fibleman figures he may
knock a few of them in the creek.</p>

<p>Armand Fibleman is a character who will bet on baseball games from
who-laid-the-chunk, and in fact he will bet on anything whatever, because
Armand Fibleman is a gambler by trade and has been such since infancy.
Personally, I will not bet you four dollars on a baseball game, because in the
first place I am not apt to have four dollars, and in the second place I
consider horse races a much sounder investment, but I often go around and about
with Armand Fibleman, as he is a friend of mine, and sometimes he gives me a
little piece of one of his bets for nothing.</p>

<p>Well, what happens in Philadelphia but the umpire forfeits the game in the
seventh innings to the Giants by a score of nine to nothing when the Phillies
are really leading by five runs, and the reason the umpire takes this action is
because he orders several of the Philadelphia players to leave the field for
calling him a scoundrel and a rat and a snake in the grass, and also a baboon,
and they refuse to take their departure, as they still have more names to call
him.</p>

<p>Right away the Philadelphia customers become infuriated in a manner you will
scarcely believe, for ordinarily a Philadelphia baseball customer is as quiet
as a lamb, no matter what you do to him, and in fact in those days a
Philadelphia baseball customer is only considered as somebody to do something
to. But these Philadelphia customers are so infuriated that they not only chase
the umpire under the stand, but they wait in the street outside the baseball
orchard until the Giants change into their street clothes and come out of the
clubhouse. Then the Philadelphia customers begin pegging rocks, and one thing
and another, at the Giants, and it is a most exciting and disgraceful scene
that is spoken of for years afterward.</p>

<p>Well, the Giants march along towards the North Philly station to catch a
train for home, dodging the rocks and one thing and another the best they can,
and wondering why the Philadelphia gendarmes do not come to the rescue, until
somebody notices several gendarmes among the customers doing some of the
throwing themselves, so the Giants realize that this is a most inhospitable
community, to be sure.</p>

<p>Finally all of them get inside the North Philly station and are safe, except
a big, tall, left-handed pitcher by the name of Haystack Duggeler, who just
reports to the club the day before and who finds himself surrounded by quite a
posse of these infuriated Philadelphia customers, and who is unable to make
them understand that he is nothing but a rookie, because he has a Missouri
accent, and besides, he is half paralysed with fear.</p>

<p>One of the infuriated Philadelphia customers is armed with a brickbat and is
just moving forward to maim Haystack Duggeler with this instrument, when who
steps into the situation but Baseball Hattie, who is also on her way to the
station to catch a train, and who is greatly horrified by the assault on the
Giants.</p>

<p>She seizes the brickbat from the infuriated Philadelphia customer's grasp,
and then tags the customer smack-dab between the eyes with his own weapon,
knocking him so unconscious that I afterward hear he does not recover for two
weeks, and that he remains practically an imbecile the rest of his days.</p>

<p>Then Baseball Hattie cuts loose on the other infuriated Philadelphia
customers with language that they never before hear in those parts, causing
them to disperse without further ado, and after the last customer is beyond the
sound of her voice, she takes Haystack Duggeler by the pitching arm and
personally escorts him to the station.</p>

<p>Now out of this incident is born a wonderful romance between Baseball Hattie
and Haystack Duggeler, and in fact it is no doubt love at first sight, and
about this period Haystack Duggeler begins burning up the league with his
pitching, and at the same time giving Manager Mac plenty of headaches,
including the romance with Baseball Hattie, because anybody will tell you that
a left-hander is tough enough on a manager without a romance, and especially a
romance with Baseball Hattie.</p>

<p>It seems that the trouble with Hattie is she is in business up in Harlem,
and this business consists of a boarding-and-rooming-house where ladies and
gentlemen board and room, and personally I never see anything out of line in
the matter, but the rumour somehow gets around, as rumours will do, that in the
first place it is not a boarding-and-rooming-house, and in the second place
that the ladies and gentlemen who room and board there are by no means ladies
and gentlemen, and especially ladies.</p>

<p>Well, this rumour becomes a terrible knock to Baseball Hattie's social
reputation. Furthermore, I hear Manager Mac sends for her and requests her to
kindly lay off his ball-players, and especially off a character who can make a
baseball sing high C like Haystack Duggeler. In fact, I hear Manager Mac gives
her such a lecture on her civic duty to New York and to the Giants that
Baseball Hattie sheds tears, and promises she will never give Haystack another
tumble the rest of the season.</p>

<p>'You know me, Mac,' Baseball Hattie says. 'You know I will cut off my nose
rather than do anything to hurt your club. I sometimes figure I am in love with
this big bloke, but,' she says, 'maybe it is only gas pushing up around my
heart. I will take something for it. To hell with him, Mac!' she says.</p>

<p>So she does not see Haystack Duggeler again, except at a distance, for a
long time, and he goes on to win fourteen games in a row, pitching a no-hitter
and four two-hitters among them, and hanging up a reputation as a great
pitcher, and also as a 100-per cent. heel.</p>

<p>Haystack Duggeler is maybe twenty-five at this time, and he comes to the big
league with more bad habits than anybody in the history of the world is able to
acquire in such a short time. He is especially a great rumpot, and after he
gets going good in the league, he is just as apt to appear for a game all
mulled up as not.</p>

<p>He is fond of all forms of gambling, such as playing cards and shooting
craps, but after they catch him with a deck of readers in a poker game and a
pair of tops in a crap game, none of the Giants will play with him any more,
except of course when there is nobody else to play with.</p>

<p>He is ignorant about many little things, such as reading and writing and
geography and mathematics, as Haystack Duggeler himself admits he never goes to
school any more than he can help, but he is so wise when it comes to larceny
that I always figure they must have great tutors back in Haystack's old home
town of Booneville, Mo.</p>

<p>And no smarter jobbie ever breathes than Haystack when he is out there
pitching. He has so much speed that he just naturally throws the ball past a
batter before he can get the old musket off his shoulder, and along with his
hard one, Haystack has a curve like the letter Q. With two ounces of brains,
Haystack Duggeler will be the greatest pitcher that ever lives.</p>

<p>Well, as far as Baseball Hattie is concerned, she keeps her word about not
seeing Haystack, although sometimes when he is mulled up he goes around to her
boarding-and-rooming-house, and tries to break down the door.</p>

<p>On days when Haystack Duggeler is pitching, she is always in her favourite
seat back of third, and while she roots hard for the Giants no matter who is
pitching, she puts on extra steam when Haystack is bending them over, and it is
quite an experience to hear her crying lay them in there, Haystack, old boy,
and strike this big tramp out, Haystack, and other exclamations of a similar
nature, which please Haystack quite some, but annoy Baseball Hattie's
neighbours back of third base, such as Armand Fibleman, if he happens to be
betting on the other club.</p>

<p>A month before the close of his first season in the big league, Haystack
Duggeler gets so ornery that Manager Mac suspends him, hoping maybe it will
cause Haystack to do a little thinking, but naturally Haystack is unable to do
this, because he has nothing to think with. About a week later, Manager Mac
gets to noticing how he can use a few ball games, so he starts looking for
Haystack Duggeler, and he finds him tending bar on Eighth Avenue with his
uniform hung up back of the bar as an advertisement.</p>

<p>The baseball writers speak of Haystack as eccentric, which is a polite way
of saying he is a screwball, but they consider him a most unique character and
are always writing humorous stories about him, though any one of them will lay
you plenty of 9 to 5 that Haystack winds up an umbay. The chances are they will
raise their price a little, as the season closes and Haystack is again under
suspension with cold weather coming on and not a dime in his pants'
pockets.</p>

<p>It is some time along in the winter that Baseball Hattie hauls off and
marries Haystack Duggeler, which is a great surprise to one and all, but not
nearly as much of a surprise as when Hattie closes her
boarding-and-rooming-house and goes to live in a little apartment with Haystack
Duggeler up on Washington Heights.</p>

<p>It seems that she finds Haystack one frosty night sleeping in a hallway,
after being around slightly mulled up for several weeks, and she takes him to
her home and gets him a bath and a shave and a clean shirt and two boiled eggs
and some toast and coffee and a shot or two of rye whisky, all of which is
greatly appreciated by Haystack, especially the rye whisky.</p>

<p>Then Haystack proposes marriage to her and takes a paralysed oath that if
she becomes his wife he will reform, so what with loving Haystack anyway, and
with the fix commencing to request more dough off the
boarding-and-rooming-house business than the business will stand, Hattie takes
him at his word, and there you are.</p>

<p>The baseball writers are wondering what Manager Mac will say when he hears
these tidings, but all Mac says is that Haystack cannot possibly be any worse
married than he is single-o, and then Mac has the club office send the happy
couple a little paper money to carry them over the winter.</p>

<p>Well, what happens but a great change comes over Haystack Duggeler. He stops
bending his elbow and helps Hattie cook and wash the dishes, and holds her hand
when they are in the movies, and speaks of his love for her several times a
week, and Hattie is as happy as nine dollars' worth of lettuce. Manager Mac is
so delighted at the change in Haystack that he has the club office send over
more paper money, because Mac knows that with Haystack in shape he is sure of
twenty-five games, and maybe the pennant.</p>

<p>In late February, Haystack reports to the training camp down South still as
sober as some judges, and the other ball-players are so impressed by the change
in him that they admit him to their poker game again. But of course it is too
much to expect a man to alter his entire course of living all at once, and it
is not long before Haystack discovers four nines in his hand on his own deal
and breaks up the game.</p>

<p>He brings Baseball Hattie with him to the camp, and this is undoubtedly a
slight mistake, as it seems the old rumour about her boarding-and-rooming-house
business gets around among the ever-loving wives of the other players, and they
put on a large chill for her. In fact, you will think Hattie has the
smallpox.</p>

<p>Naturally, Baseball Hattie feels the frost, but she never lets on, as it
seems she runs into many bigger and better frosts than this in her time. Then
Haystack Duggeler notices it, and it seems that it makes him a little peevish
towards Baseball Hattie, and in fact it is said that he gives her a slight
pasting one night in their room, partly because she has no better social
standing and partly because he is commencing to cop a few sneaks on the local
corn now and then, and Hattie chides him for same.</p>

<p>Well, about this time it appears that Baseball Hattie discovers that she is
going to have a baby, and as soon as she recovers from her astonishment, she
decides that it is to be a boy who will be a great baseball player, maybe a
pitcher, although Hattie admits she is willing to compromise on a good second
baseman.</p>

<p>She also decides that his name is to be Derrill Duggeler, after his paw, as
it seems Derrill is Haystack's real name, and he is only called Haystack
because he claims he once makes a living stacking hay, although the general
opinion is that all he ever stacks is cards.</p>

<p>It is really quite remarkable what a belt Hattie gets out of the idea of
having this baby, though Haystack is not excited about the matter. He is not
paying much attention to Baseball Hattie by now, except to give her a slight
pasting now and then, but Hattie is so happy about the baby that she does not
mind these pastings.</p>

<p>Haystack Duggeler meets up with Armand Fibleman along in midsummer. By this
time, Haystack discovers horse racing and is always making bets on the horses,
and naturally he is generally broke, and then I commence running into him in
different spots with Armand Fibleman, who is now betting higher than a cat's
back on baseball games.</p>

<p>It is late August, and the Giants are fighting for the front end of the
league, and an important series with Brooklyn is coming up, and everybody knows
that Haystack Duggeler will work in anyway two games of the series, as Haystack
can generally beat Brooklyn just by throwing his glove on the mound. There is
no doubt but what he has the old Indian sign on Brooklyn, and the night before
the first game, which he is sure to work, the gamblers along Broadway are
making the Giants 2-to-l favourites to win the game.</p>

<p>This same night before the game, Baseball Hattie is home in her little
apartment on Washington Heights waiting for Haystack to come in and eat a
delicious dinner of pigs' knuckles and sauerkraut, which she personally
prepares for him. In fact, she hurries home right after the ball game to get
this delicacy ready, because Haystack tells her he will surely come home this
particular night, although Hattie knows he is never better than even money to
keep his word about anything.</p>

<p>But sure enough, in he comes while the pigs' knuckles and sauerkraut are
still piping hot, and Baseball Hattie is surprised to see Armand Fibleman with
him, as she knows Armand backwards and forwards and does not care much for him,
at that. However, she can say the same thing about four million other
characters in this town, so she makes Armand welcome, and they sit down and put
on the pigs' knuckles and sauerkraut together, and a pleasant time is enjoyed
by one and all. In fact, Baseball Hattie puts herself out to entertain Armand
Fibleman, because he is the first guest Haystack ever brings home.</p>

<p>Well, Armand Fibleman can be very pleasant when he wishes, and he speaks
very nicely to Hattie. Naturally, he sees that Hattie is expecting, and in fact
he will have to be blind not to see it, and he seems greatly interested in this
matter and asks Hattie many questions, and Hattie is delighted to find somebody
to talk to about what is coming off with her, as Haystack will never listen to
any of her remarks on the subject.</p>

<p>So Armand Fibleman gets to hear all about Baseball Hattie's son, and how he
is to be a great baseball player, and Armand says is that so, and how nice, and
all this and that, until Haystack Duggeler speaks up as follows and to wit:</p>

<p>'Oh, doggone her son!' Haystack says. 'It is going to be a girl, anyway, so
let us dismiss this topic and get down to business. Hat,' he says, 'you fan
yourself into the kitchen and wash the dishes, while Armand and me talk.'</p>

<p>So Hattie goes into the kitchen, leaving Haystack and Armand sitting there
talking, and what are they talking about but a proposition for Haystack to let
the Brooklyn club beat him the next day so Armand Fibleman can take the odds
and clean up a nice little gob of money, which he is to split with
Haystack.</p>

<p>Hattie can hear every word they say, as the kitchen is next door to the
dining-room where they are sitting, and at first she thinks they are joking,
because at this time nobody ever even as much as thinks of skullduggery in
baseball, or anyway, not much.</p>

<p>It seems that at first Haystack is not in favour of the idea, but Armand
Fibleman keeps mentioning money that Haystack owes him for bets on the horse
races, and he asks Haystack how he expects to continue betting on the races
without fresh money, and Armand also speaks of the great injustice that is
being done Haystack by the Giants in not paying him twice the salary he is
getting, and how the loss of one or two games is by no means such a great
calamity.</p>

<p>Well, finally Baseball Hattie hears Haystack say all right, but he wishes a
thousand dollars then and there as a guarantee, and Armand Fibleman says this
is fine, and they will go downtown and he will get the money at once, and now
Hattie realizes that maybe they are in earnest, and she pops out of the kitchen
and speaks as follows:</p>

<p>'Gentlemen,' Hattie says, 'you seem to be sober, but I guess you are drunk.
If you are not drunk, you must both be daffy to think of such a thing as
phenagling around with a baseball game.'</p>

<p>'Hattie,' Haystack says, 'kindly close your trap and go back in the kitchen,
or I will give you a bust in the nose.'</p>

<p>And with this he gets up and reaches for his hat, and Fibleman gets up too,
and Hattie says like this: 'Why, Haystack,' she says, 'you are not really
serious in this matter, are you?'</p>

<p>'Of course I am serious,' Haystack says. 'I am sick and tired of pitching
for starvation wages, and besides, I will win a lot of games later on to make
up for the one I lose to-morrow. Say,' he says, 'these Brooklyn bums may get
lucky to-morrow and knock me loose from my pants, anyway, no matter what I do,
so what difference does it make?'</p>

<p>'Haystack,' Baseball Hattie says, 'I know you are a liar and a drunkard and
a cheat and no account generally, but nobody can tell me you will sink so low
as to purposely toss off a ball game. Why, Haystack, baseball is always on the
level. It is the most honest game in all this world. I guess you are just
ribbing me, because you know how much I love it.'</p>

<p>'Dry up!' Haystack says to Hattie. 'Furthermore, do not expect me home again
to-night. But anyway, dry up.'</p>

<p>'Look, Haystack,' Hattie says, 'I am going to have a son. He is your son and
my son, and he is going to be a great ball-player when he grows up, maybe a
greater pitcher than you are, though I hope and trust he is not left-handed. He
will have your name. If they find out you toss off a game for money, they will
throw you out of baseball and you will be disgraced. My son will be known as
the son of a crook, and what chance will he have in baseball? Do you think I am
going to allow you to do this to him, and to the game that keeps me from going
nutty for marrying you?'</p>

<p>Naturally, Haystack Duggeler is greatly offended by Hattie's crack about her
son being maybe a greater pitcher than he is, and he is about to take steps,
when Armand Fibleman stops him. Armand Fibleman is commencing to be somewhat
alarmed at Baseball Hattie's attitude, and he gets to thinking that he hears
that people in her delicate condition are often irresponsible, and he fears
that she may blow a whistle on this enterprise without realizing what she is
doing. So he undertakes a few soothing remarks to her.</p>

<p>'Why, Hattie,' Armand Fibleman says, 'nobody can possibly find out about
this little matter, and Haystack will have enough money to send your son to
college, if his markers at the race track do not take it all. Maybe you better
lie down and rest a while,' Armand says.</p>

<p>But Baseball Hattie does not as much as look at Armand, though she goes on
talking to Haystack. 'They always find out thievery, Haystack,' she says,
'especially when you are dealing with a fink like Fibleman. If you deal with
him once, you will have to deal with him again and again, and he will be the
first to holler copper on you, because he is a stool pigeon in his heart.'</p>

<p>'Haystack,' Armand Fibleman says, 'I think we better be going.'</p>

<p>'Haystack,' Hattie says, 'you can go out of here and stick up somebody or
commit a robbery or a murder, and I will still welcome you back and stand by
you. But if you are going out to steal my son's future, I advise you not to
go.'</p>

<p>'Dry up!' Haystack says. 'I am going.'</p>

<p>'All right, Haystack,' Hattie says, very calm.' 'But just step into the
kitchen with me and let me say one little word to you by yourself, and then I
will say no more.'</p>

<p>Well, Haystack Duggeler does not care for even just one little word more,
but Armand Fibleman wishes to get this disagreeable scene over with, so he
tells Haystack to let her have her word, and Haystack goes into the kitchen
with Hattie, and Armand cannot hear what is said, as she speaks very low, but
he hears Haystack laugh heartily and then Haystack comes out of the kitchen,
still laughing, and tells Armand he is ready to go.</p>

<p>As they start for the door, Baseball Hattie outs with a long-nosed
.38-calibre Colt's revolver, and goes root-a-toot-toot with it, and the next
thing anybody knows, Haystack is on the floor yelling bloody murder, and Armand
Fibleman is leaving the premises without bothering to open the door. In fact,
the landlord afterward talks some of suing Haystack Duggeler because of the
damage Armand Fibleman does to the door. Armand himself afterward admits that
when he slows down for a breather a couple of miles down Broadway he finds
splinters stuck all over him.</p>

<p>Well, the doctors come, and the gendarmes come, and there is great
confusion, especially as Baseball Hattie is sobbing so she can scarcely make a
statement, and Haystack Duggeler is so sure he is going to die that he cannot
think of anything to say except oh-oh-oh, but finally the landlord remembers
seeing Armand leave with his door, and everybody starts questioning Hattie
about this until she confesses that Armand is there all right, and that he
tries to bribe Haystack to toss off a ball game, and that she then suddenly
finds herself with a revolver in her hand, and everything goes black before her
eyes, and she can remember no more until somebody is sticking a bottle of
smelling salts under her nose.</p>

<p>Naturally, the newspaper reporters put two and two together, and what they
make of it is that Hattie tries to plug Armand Fibleman for his rascally offer,
and that she misses Armand and gets Haystack, and right away Baseball Hattie is
a great heroine, and Haystack is a great hero, though nobody thinks to ask
Haystack how he stands on the bribe proposition, and he never brings it up
himself.</p>

<p>And nobody will ever offer Haystack any more bribes, for after the doctors
get through with him he is shy a left arm from the shoulder down, and he will
never pitch a baseball again, unless he learns to pitch right-handed.</p>

<p>The newspapers make quite a lot of Baseball Hattie protecting the fair name
of baseball. The National League plays a benefit game for Haystack Duggeler and
presents him with a watch and a purse of twenty-five thousand dollars, which
Baseball Hattie grabs away from him, saying it is for her son, while Armand
Fibleman is in bad with one and all.</p>

<p>Baseball Hattie and Haystack Duggeler move to the Pacific Coast, and this is
all there is to the story, except that one day some years ago, and not long
before he passes away in Los Angeles, a respectable grocer, I run into Haystack
when he is in New York on a business trip, and I say to him like this:</p>

<p>'Haystack,' I say, 'it is certainly a sin and a shame that Hattie misses
Armand Fibleman that night and puts you on the shelf. The chances are that but
for this little accident you will hang up one of the greatest pitching records
in the history of baseball. Personally,' I say, 'I never see a better
left-handed pitcher.'</p>

<p>'Look,' Haystack says. 'Hattie does not miss Fibleman. It is a great
newspaper story and saves my name, but the truth is she hits just where she
aims. When she calls me into the kitchen before I start out with Fibleman, she
shows me a revolver I never before know she has, and says to me, "Haystack,"
she says, "if you leave with this weasel on the errand you mention, I am going
to fix you so you will never make another wrong move with your pitching arm. I
am going to shoot it off for you."</p>

<p>'I laugh heartily,' Haystack says. 'I think she is kidding me, but I find
out different. By the way,' Haystack says, 'I afterward learn that long before
I meet her, Hattie works for three years in a shooting gallery at Coney Island.
She is really a remarkable broad,' Haystack says.</p>

<p>I guess I forget to state that the day Baseball Hattie is at the Polo
Grounds she is watching the new kid sensation of the big leagues, Derrill
Duggeler, shut out Brooklyn with three hits.</p>

<p>He is a wonderful young left-hander.</p>

<h3><a name="Situation_Wanted" id="Situation_Wanted">Situation Wanted</a></h3>
<p>One evening in the summer of 1936 I am passing in front of Mindy's
restaurant on Broadway when the night manager suddenly opens the door and
throws a character in a brown suit at me.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the character just misses me, and hits a yellow short that is
standing at the kerb, and dents a mudguard, because he is a little character,
and the night manager of Mindy's can throw that kind with an in curve.</p>

<p>Naturally, I am greatly vexed, and I am thinking of stepping into Mindy's
and asking the night manager how dare he hurl missiles of this nature at me,
when I remember that the night manager does not care for me, either, and in
fact he hates me from head to foot, and does not permit me in Mindy's except on
Fridays, because of course he does not have the heart to keep me from enjoying
my chicken soup with matzoth dumplings once a week.</p>

<p>So I let the incident pass, and watch the jockey of the yellow short nail
the character in the brown suit with a left hook that knocks him right under my
feet, and then, as he gets up and dusts himself off with his hands and starts
up the street, I see that he is nobody but a character by the name of Asleep,
who is called by this name because he always goes around with his eyes half
closed, and looking as if he is dozing off.</p>

<p>Well, here is a spectacle that really brings tears to my eyes, as I can
remember when just a few years back the name of Asleep strikes terror to the
hearts of one and all on Broadway, and everywhere else in this town for that
matter, because in those days he is accounted one of the greatest characters in
his line in the world, and in fact he is generally regarded as a genius.</p>

<p>Asleep's line is taking care of anybody that somebody wishes taken care of,
and at one time he is the highest-priced character in the business. For several
years along in the late 'twenties, he handles all of the late Dave the Dude's
private business when Dave the Dude is at war with the late Big Moey, and when
somebody finally takes care of Dave the Dude himself, Asleep is with Moey for
quite a while.</p>

<p>In six or seven years, the chances are Asleep takes care of scores of
characters of one kind and another, and he never looks for any publicity or
glory. In fact, he is always a most retiring character, who goes about very
quietly, minding his own affairs, and those who know him think very well of him
indeed.</p>

<p>The bladders print many unkind stories about Asleep when he is finally
lumbered in 1931 and sent to college, and some of them call him a torpedo, and
a trigger, and I do not know what all else, and these names hurt Asleep's
feelings, especially as they seem to make him out no better than a ruffian. In
fact, one bladder speaks of him as a killer, and this title causes Asleep to
wince more than anything else.</p>

<p>He is in college at Dannemora from 1931 until the late spring of 1936, and
although I hear he is back, this is the first time I see him in person, and I
hasten to overtake him to express my sympathy with him on his treatment by the
night manager of Mindy's and also by the jockey of the yellow short, and to
deplore the lack of respect now shown on Broadway for a character such as
Asleep.</p>

<p>He seems glad to see me, and he accepts my expressions gratefully, and we go
into the Bridle Grill and have a couple of drinks and then Asleep says to me
like this:</p>

<p>'I only go into Mindy's seeking a situation,' he says. 'I hear Benny Barker,
the bookie, is in there, and I understand that he has a disagreement with
another bookie by the name of Jersey Cy down at Aqueduct, and that Jersey Cy
punches Benny's beezer for him. So,' Asleep says, 'I figure Benny will wish to
have Cy taken care of immediately and that it will be a nice quick pick-up for
me, because in the old days when Benny is a bootie, he is one of my best
customers.</p>

<p>'It is the first time I see Benny since I get back,' Asleep says, 'but
instead of being glad to see me, he seems very distant to me, and the minute I
begin canvassing him for the business, he turns as white as one of Mindy's
napkins, and in fact whiter, and says for me to get out of there, or he will
call the law.</p>

<p>'Benny says he will never even dream of such a thing as having anybody taken
care of, and,' Asleep says, 'when I start to remind him of a couple of
incidents back down the years, he carries on in a way you will never believe. I
even offer to cut my fee for him,' Asleep says, 'but Benny only gets more
excited, and keeps yelling no, no, no, until the night manager appears, and you
see for yourself what happens to me. I am publicly embarrassed,' he says.</p>

<p>'Well, Sleeps,' I say, 'to tell the truth, I am somewhat amazed that you do
not out with that thing and resent these familiarities.'</p>

<p>But Asleep seems somewhat horrified at this suggestion, and he sets his
glass down, and gazes at me a while in pained silence, and finally he says:
'Why,' he says, 'I hope and trust that you do not think I will ever use that
thing except for professional purposes, and when I am paid for same. Why,' he
says, 'in all my practice, covering a matter of nearly ten years, I never lift
a finger against as much as a flea unless it is a business proposition, and I
am not going to begin now.'</p>

<p>Well, I remember that this is indeed Asleep's reputation in the old days,
and that a midget can walk up to him and tweak his ear without running any
risk, and of course I am bound to respect his ethics, although I am sorry he
cannot see his way clear to making an exception in the case of the night
manager of Mindy's.</p>

<p>'I do not understand the way times change since I am in college,' Asleep
says. 'Nobody around here wishes anybody taken care of any more. I call on
quite a number of old customers of mine before I visit Benny Barker, but they
have nothing for me, and none of them suggests that I call again. I fear I am
<i>passé</i>,' Asleep says. 'Yet I am the one who first brings the idea to Brooklyn of
putting them in the sack. I originate picking them off in barber chairs. I am
always first and foremost with innovations in my business, and now there is no
business.</p>

<p>'It is a tough break for me,' Asleep says, 'just when I happen to need a
situation more than at any other time in my life. I simply must make good,' he
says, 'because I am in love and wish to be married. I am in love with Miss Anna
Lark, who dances behind bubbles over in the Starlight Restaurant. Yes,' he
says, 'Miss Anna Lark is my sweet-pea, and she loves me as dearly as I love
her, or anyway,' he says, 'she so states no longer ago than two hours.'</p>

<p>'Well,' I say, 'Miss Anna Lark has a shape that is a lulu. Even behind
bubbles,' I say, and this is a fact that is well known to one and all on
Broadway, but I do not consider it necessary to mention to Asleep that it is
also pretty well known along Broadway that Benny Barker, the bookie, is deeply
interested in Miss Anna Lark, and, to tell the truth, is practically off his
onion about her, because I am by no means a chirper.</p>

<p>'I often notice her shape myself,' Asleep says. 'In fact, it is one of the
things that starts our romance before I go away to college. It seems to me it
is better then than it is now, but,' he says, 'a shape is not everything in
this life, although I admit it is never any knock. Miss Anna Lark waits
patiently for me all the time I am away, and once she writes me a screeve, so
you can see that this is undoubtedly true love.</p>

<p>'But,' Asleep says, 'Miss Anna Lark now wishes to abandon the bubble dodge,
and return to her old home in Miami, Florida, where her papa is in the
real-estate business. Miss Anna Lark feels that there is no future behind
bubbles, especially,' he says, 'since she recently contracts arthritis in both
knees from working in drafty night-clubs. And she wishes me to go to Miami,
Florida, too, and perhaps engage in the real-estate business like her papa, and
acquire some scratch so we can be married, and raise up children, and all this
and that, and be happy ever after.</p>

<p>'But,' Asleep says, 'it is very necessary for me to get hold of a taw to
make a start, and at this time I do not have as much as two white quarters to
rub together in my pants' pocket, and neither has Miss Anna Lark, and from what
I hear, the same thing goes for Miss Anna Lark's papa, and with conditions in
my line what they are, I am greatly depressed, and scarcely know which way to
turn.'</p>

<p>Well, naturally, I feel very sorry for Asleep, but I can offer no
suggestions of any value at the moment, and in fact the best I can do is to
stake him to a few dibs for walk-about money, and then I leave him in the
Bridle Grill looking quite sad and forlorn, to be sure.</p>

<p>I do not see Asleep tor several months after this, and am wondering what
becomes of him, and I watch the bladders for news of happenings that may
indicate he finally gets a break, but nothing of interest appears, and then one
day I run into him at Broadway and Forty-sixth Street.</p>

<p>He is all sharpened up in new clothes, and a fresh shave, and he is carrying
a suitcase, and looks very prosperous, indeed, and he seems happy to see me,
and leads me around into Dinty Moore's, and sits me down at a table, and orders
up some drinks, and then he says to me like this:</p>

<p>'Now,' he says, 'I will tell you what happens. After you leave me in the
Bridle Grill, I sit down and take to reading one of the evening bladders, and
what I read about is a war in a place by the name of Spain, and from what I
read, I can see that it is a war between two different mobs living in this
Spain, each of which wishes to control the situation. It reminds me of Chicago
the time Big Moey sends me out to Al.</p>

<p>'Thinks I to myself,' Asleep says, 'where there is a war of this nature,
there may be employment for a character of my experience, and I am sitting
there pondering this matter when who comes in looking for me but Benny Barker,
the bookie.</p>

<p>'Well,' Asleep says, 'Benny states that he gets to thinking of me after I
leave Mindy's, and he says he remembers that he really has a soft place in his
heart for me, and that while he has no business for me any more, he will be
glad to stake me to go wherever I think I may find something, and I remember
what I am just reading in the evening bladder, and I say all right, Spain.</p>

<p>'Where is this Spain?' Benny Barker asks.</p>

<p>'Well,' Asleep says, 'of course I do not know where it is myself, so we
inquire of Professor D, the educated horse player, and he says it is to hell
and gone from here. He says it is across the sea, and Benny Barker says he will
arrange my passage there at once, and furthermore that he will give me a
thousand slugs in ready, and I can pay him back at my convenience. Afterward,'
Asleep says, 'I recall that Benny Barker seems greatly pleased that I am going
far away, but I figure his conscience hurts him for the manner in which he
rebuffs me in Mindy's, and he wishes to round himself up with me.</p>

<p>'So I go to this Spain,' Asleep says, 'and now,' he says, 'if you wish to
hear any more, I will be glad to oblige.' Well, I tell Asleep that if he will
keep calling the waiter at regular intervals, he may proceed, and Asleep
proceeds as follows:</p>

<p>I go to this Spain seeking employment, and you will scarcely believe the
trouble and inconvenience I am put to in getting there. I go by way of a ship
that takes me to France, which is a place I remember somewhat, because I visit
there in my early youth, in 1918, with the 77th Division, and which is a nice
place, at that, especially the <i>Folies-Bergère</i>, and I go across France and down
to a little jerk-water town just over the border from this Spain, and who do I
run into sitting in front of a small gin-mill in the town but a Spanish
character by the name of Manuel something.</p>

<p>He is once well known along Broadway as a heavy-weight fighter, and he is by
no means a bad fighter in his day, and he now has a pair of scrambled ears to
prove it. Furthermore, he is bobbing slightly, and seems to have a few marbles
in his mouth, but he is greatly pleased to see me.</p>

<p>Manuel speaks English very good, considering the marbles, and he tells me he
is personally in the fighting in this Spain for several weeks, but he is unable
to find out what he is fighting about, so finally he gets tired, and is over in
France taking a recess, and when I tell him I am going to this Spain, and what
for, he says he has no doubt I will do very nice for myself, because of course
Manuel knows my reputation in the old days in New York.</p>

<p>Furthermore, he says he will go with me, and act as my manager, and maybe
take a piece of my earnings, just as his American managers do with him when he
is active in the ring, and when I ask him what he calls a piece, he says 65 per
cent. is the way his American managers always slice him, but naturally I do not
agree to any such terms. Still, I can see that Manuel is such a character as
may come in handy to me, what with knowing how to speak Spanish, as well as
English, so I say I will look out for him very nicely when the time comes for a
settlement, and this satisfies him.</p>

<p>We go across the border into this Spain by night, and Manuel says he will
lead me to a spot where the fighting is very good, and by and by we come to a
fair-sized town, with houses, and steeples, and all this and that, and which
has a name I do not remember, and which I cannot pronounce, even if I do
remember it.</p>

<p>Manuel says we are now in the war, and in fact I can hear shooting going on
although it does not seem to be interfering with public business in the town,
as many characters, male and female, are walking around and about, and up and
down, and back and forth, and none of them seem to be disturbed by anything
much.</p>

<p>But Manuel and I follow the sound of the shooting, and finally we come upon
a large number of characters behind a breastworks made out of sandbags, and
they all have rifles in their hands, and are shooting now and then at a big
stone building on a high hill about three blocks away, and from this building
also comes a lot of firing, and there are occasional bur-ur-ur-ups on both
sides that I recognize as machine-guns, and bullets are zinging about the
sandbags quite some.</p>

<p>Well, Manuel says this is some of the war, but all the characters behind the
sandbags seem to be taking things easy, and in fact some are sitting in chairs
and firing their rifles from a rest over the bags while so seated, and thinks I
to myself, this is a very leisurely war, to be sure.</p>

<p>But about two blocks from the breastworks, and on a rise of ground almost as
high as the hill the building is on, there is a field gun, and this is also
firing on the building about every fifteen minutes, and I can see that it seems
to be doing some real damage, at that, what with knocking off pieces of the
architecture, and punching holes in the roof, although now and then it lets go
a shell that misses the mark in a way that will never be tolerated by the
character who commands the battery I serve with in France.</p>

<p>Many of the characters behind the sandbags seem to know Manuel, who appears
to be a famous character in this Spain, and they stop shooting, and gather
about him, and there is much conversation among them, which of course I do not
understand, so after a while I request Manuel to pay more attention to me and
to kindly explain the situation I find here.</p>

<p>Well, Manuel says the building on the hill is an old castle and that it is
being held by a lot of Spanish characters, male and female, who are as mad at
the characters behind the sandbags as the Republicans are mad at the Democrats
in my country, and maybe madder. Manuel says the characters in the castle
represent one side of the war in this Spain, and the characters behind the
sandbags represent the other side, although Manuel does not seem to know which
is which, and naturally I do not care.</p>

<p>'Well,' I say to Manuel, 'this is a good place to start business. Tell them
who I am,' I say, 'and ask them how much they will give me for taking care of
these parties in the castle.'</p>

<p>So Manuel makes quite a speech, and while I do not understand what he is
saying, I can see that he is putting me away with them very good, because they
are gazing at me with great interest and respect. When he concludes his speech
they give me a big cheer and crowd around me shaking hands, and I see Manuel
talking with some characters who seem to be the mains in this situation, and
they are listening eagerly to his remarks, and nodding their heads, and Manuel
says to me like this:</p>

<p>'Well,' Manuel says, 'I tell them you are the greatest American gangster
that ever lives, and that they undoubtedly see you often in the movies, and
they are in favour of your proposition one hundred per cent. They are anxious
to see how you operate,' Manuel says, 'because they wish to install similar
methods in this country when things get settled down.'</p>

<p>'Kindly omit referring to me as a gangster,' I say. 'It is a most uncouth
word, and besides I never operate with a gang in my life.'</p>

<p>'Well, all right,' Manuel says, 'but it is a word they understand. However,'
he says, 'the trouble here is they do not have much dinero, which is money. In
fact, they say the best they can offer you to take care of the parties in the
castle is two pesetas per head.'</p>

<p>'How much is two pesetas?' I ask.</p>

<p>'The last time I am here, it is about forty cents in your language,' Manuel
says.</p>

<p>Naturally, I am very indignant at this offer, because in my time I get as
high as twenty thousand dollars for taking care of a case, and never less than
five hundred, except once when I do a favour for one-fifty, but Manuel claims
it is not such a bad offer as it sounds, as he says that at the moment two
pesetas is by no means alfalfa in this Spain, especially as there are maybe
four hundred heads in the castle, counting everything.</p>

<p>Manuel says it really is an exceptional offer as the characters behind the
sandbags are anxious to conclude the siege because certain friends of the
parties in the castle are arriving in a near-by town, and anyway, sitting
behind these sandbags is getting most monotonous to one and all. Furthermore,
Manuel says, when they are not sitting behind the sandbags, these characters
are required to work every day digging a tunnel into the hill under the castle,
and they regard this work as most enervating.</p>

<p>Manuel says the idea of the tunnel is to plant dynamite under the castle and
blow it up.</p>

<p>'But you see,' Manuel says, 'digging is no work for proud souls such as
Spaniards, so if you can think of some other way of taking care of these
parties in the castle, it will be a great relief to my friends here.'</p>

<p>'To the dickens with these skinflints,' I say. 'Let us go to the castle and
see what the parties there will give us for taking care of these cheap skates
behind the sandbags. Never,' I say, 'will I accept such a reduction.'</p>

<p>Well, Manuel tells the mains behind the sandbags that I will take their
offer under consideration, but that I am so favourably disposed towards it that
I am going into the castle and examine the surroundings, and this pleases them
no little, so Manuel ties his handkerchief on a stick and says this is a flag
of truce and will get us into the castle safe and sound, and we set out.</p>

<p>Presently characters appear at the windows, and at holes in the walls of the
castle, and Manuel holds a conversation with them in the Spanish language, and
by and by they admit us to the castle yard, and one character with whiskers
leads us into the building and down stone steps until we arrive in what seems
to be a big basement far underground.</p>

<p>And in this basement I behold a very unusual scene to be sure. There are
many characters present, male and female, also numerous small children, and
they seem to be living in great confusion, but they are greatly interested in
us when we appear, especially a tall, thin elderly character with white hair,
and a white tash, and a white goatee, who seems to be a character of some
authority.</p>

<p>In fact, Manuel says he is nobody but a character by the name of General
Pedro Vega, and that this castle is his old family home, and that he is leader
of these other characters in the basement.</p>

<p>I can see at once that Manuel and the general are old friends, because they
make quite a fuss over meeting up in this manner, and then Manuel introduces
me, and delivers another speech about me, explaining what a wonderful character
I am. When he gets through, the general turns to me, and in very good English
he speaks as follows:</p>

<p>'I am very glad to meet you, Senor Asleep,' he says. 'I once live in your
country a couple of years,' he says. 'I live in your Miami, Florida.'</p>

<p>Well, I am glad to find somebody who can talk English, so I can do my own
negotiating, and in a few words I state my proposition to the general to take
care of the characters behind the sandbags, and call for his bid on same.</p>

<p>'Alas,' the general says, 'money is something we do not have. If you are
offering to take care of the enemy at one centavo each,' he says, 'we still
cannot pay. I am most regretful. It will be a big convenience to have you take
care of the enemy, because we can then escape from this place and join our
friends in a near-by city. Our food runs low,' he says. 'So does our
ammunition. Some of our females and children are ill. The longer we remain here
the worse it gets.</p>

<p>'If I do not know the calibre of the enemy,' he says, 'I will gladly
surrender. But,' he says, 'we will then all be backed up against a wall and
executed. It is better that we die here.'</p>

<p>Well, being backed up against a wall strikes me as a most undesirable fate,
to be sure, but of course it is nothing to me, and all I am thinking of is that
this is a very peculiar country where nobody has any scratch, and it is
commencing to remind me of home. And I am also thinking that the only thing I
can do is to accept the two pesetas per head offered by the characters behind
the sandbags when a very beautiful young Judy, with long black hair hanging
down her back, approaches and speaks to me at some length in the Spanish
language. Manuel says:</p>

<p>'She says,' he says, '"Oh, sir, if you can help us escape from this place you
will earn my undying gratitude." She says,' Manuel says, '"I am in love with a
splendid young character by the name of Senor Jose Valdez, who is waiting for
me with our friends in the near-by town. We are to be married as soon as the
cruel war is over," she says,' Manuel says. 'It seems to be a most meritorious
case,' Manuel says.</p>

<p>Now naturally this statement touches my heart no little, because I am in
love myself, and besides the young Judy begins weeping, and if there is one
thing I cannot stand it is female tears, and in fact my sweet-pea, Miss Anna
Lark, can always make me do almost anything she wishes by breaking out crying.
But of course business is business in this case, and I cannot let sentiment
interfere, so I am about to bid one and all farewell when General Pedro Vega
says:</p>

<p>'Wait!'</p>

<p>And with this he disappears into another part of the basement, but is back
pretty soon with a small black tin box, and out of this box he takes a batch of
papers, and hands them to me, and says:</p>

<p>'Here are the deeds to some property in your Miami, Florida,' he says. 'I
pay much money for it in 1925. They tell me at the time I am lucky to get the
property at the price, but,' he says, 'I will be honest with you. It is
unimproved property, and all I ever get out of it so far is notices that taxes
are due, which I always pay promptly. But now I fear I will never get back to
your Miami, Florida, again, and if you will take care of enough of the enemy
for us to escape, the deeds are yours. This is all I have to offer.'</p>

<p>Well, I say I will take the deeds and study them over and let him know my
answer as soon as possible, and then I retire with Manuel, but what I really
study more than anything else is the matter of the beautiful young Judy who
yearns for her sweet-pea, and there is no doubt but what my studying of her is
a point in favour of General Vega's proposition in my book, although I also do
some strong studying of the fact that taking care of these characters in the
castle is a task that will be very tough.</p>

<p>So after we leave the castle, I ask Manuel if he supposes there is a
telegraph office in operation in town, and he says of course there is, or how
can the newspaper scribes get their thrilling stories of the war out, so I get
him to take me there, and I send a cablegram addressed to Mr. Lark, real
estate, Miami, Florida, U.S.A., which reads as follows:</p>

<p>IS FIFTY ACRES LANDSCRABBLE SECTION ANY ACCOUNT</p>

<p>Then there is nothing for me to do but wait around until I get an answer,
and this takes several days, and I devote this period to seeing the sights with
Manuel, and I wish to say that some of the sights are very interesting.
Finally, I drop around to the telegraph office, and sure enough there is a
message there for me, collect, which says like this:</p>

<p>LANDSCRABBLE SECTION GREAT POSSIBILITIES STOP WHY <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LARK</p>

<p>Now I do not know Mr. Lark personally, and he does not know me, and the
chances are he never even hears of me before, but I figure that if he is half
as smart as his daughter, Miss Anna Lark, his judgment is worth following, so I
tell Manuel it looks as if the deal with General Vega is on, and I begin giving
my undivided attention to the case.</p>

<p>I can see at once that the key to the whole situation as far as I am
concerned is the field-piece on the hill, because there are really too many
characters behind the sandbags for me to take care of by myself, or even with
the assistance of Manuel, and of course I do not care to get Manuel involved in
my personal business affairs any more than I can help.</p>

<p>However, at my request he makes a few innocent inquiries among the
characters behind the sandbags, and he learns that there are always seven
characters on the hill with the gun, and that they sleep in little home-made
shelters made of boards, and canvas, and tin, and one thing and another, and
that these shelters are scattered over the top of the hill, and the top of the
hill is maybe the width of a baseball diamond.</p>

<p>But I can observe for myself that they do no firing from the hilltop after
sundown, and they seldom show any lights, which is maybe because they do not
wish to have any aeroplanes come along and drop a few hot apples on them.</p>

<p>Manuel says that the characters behind the sandbags are asking about me, and
he says they are so anxious to secure my services that he will not be surprised
if I cannot get three pesetas per head, and I can see that Manuel thinks I am
making a mistake not to dicker with them further.</p>

<p>But I tell him I am now committed to General Vega, and I have Manuel obtain
a twelve-inch file for me in the city, and also some corks out of wine bottles,
and I take the file and hammer it down, and smooth it out, and sharpen it up
nicely, and I make a handle for it out of wood, according to my own original
ideas, and I take the corks, and burn them good, and I find a big piece of
black cloth and make myself a sort of poncho out of this by cutting a hole in
the centre for my head to go through.</p>

<p>Then I wait until it comes on a night to suit me, and it is a dark night,
and rainy, and blowy, and I black up my face and hands with the burnt cork, and
slip the black cloth over my clothes, and put my file down the back of my neck
where I can reach it quickly, and make my way very quietly to the foot of the
hill on which the field-gun is located.</p>

<p>Now in the darkness, I begin crawling on my hands and knees, and wiggling
along on my stomach up the hill, and I wish to state that it is a monotonous
task because I can move only a few feet at a clip, and there are many sharp
rocks in my path, and once an insect of some nature crawls up my pant leg and
gives me a severe nip.</p>

<p>The hill is maybe as high as a two-story building, and very steep, and it
takes me over an hour to wiggle my way to the top, and sometimes I pause en
route and wonder if it is worth it. And then I think of the beautiful young
Judy in the castle, and of the property in Miami, Florida, and of Miss Anna
Lark, and I keep on wiggling.</p>

<p>Well, just as Manuel reports, there is a sentry on duty on top of the hill,
and I can make out his shape in the darkness leaning on his rifle, and this
sentry is a very large character, and at first I figure that he may present
difficulties, but when I wiggle up close to him I observe that he seems to be
dozing, and it is quiet as can be on the hilltop.</p>

<p>The sentry is really no trouble at all, and then I wiggle my way slowly
along in and out of the little shelters, and in some shelters there is but one
character, and in others two, and in one, three, and it is these three that
confuse me somewhat, as they are three more than the seven Manuel mentions in
his census of the scene, and I will overlook them entirely if one of them does
not snore more than somewhat.</p>

<p>Personally, I will always say that taking care of these ten characters one
after the other, and doing it so quietly that not one of them ever wakes up, is
the high spot of my entire career, especially when you consider that I am
somewhat rusty from lack of experience, and that my equipment is very
crude.</p>

<p>Well, when morning dawns, there I am in charge of the hilltop, and with a
field-gun at my disposal, and I discover that it is nothing but a French 75,
with which I am quite familiar, and by and by Manuel joins me, and while the
characters behind the sandbags are enjoying their breakfast, and the chances
are, not thinking of much, I plant four shells among them so fast I ruin their
morning meal, because, if I do say it myself, I am better than a raw hand with
a French 75.</p>

<p>Then I remember that the characters who are boring under the castle are
perhaps inside the tunnel at this time, so I peg away at the hole in the hill
until the front of it caves in and blocks up the hole very neatly, and Manuel
afterward claims that I wedged in the entire night-shift.</p>

<p>Well, of course these proceedings are visible to the occupants of the
castle, and it is not long before I see General Pedro Vega come marching out of
the castle with the whole kit and caboodle of characters, male and female, and
small children behind him, and they are laughing and shouting, and crying and
carrying on no little.</p>

<p>And the last I see of them as they go hurrying off in the direction of the
near-by town where their friends are located, the beautiful young Judy is
bringing up the rear and throwing kisses at me and waving a flag, and I ask
Manuel to kindly identify this flag for me so I will always remember which side
of the war in this Spain it is that I assist.</p>

<p>But Manuel says his eyesight is bad ever since the night Jim Sharkey sticks
a thumb in his eye in the fifth round in Madison Square Garden, and from this
distance he cannot tell whose flag it is, and in fact, Manuel says, he does not
give a Spanish cuss-word.<br><br></p>

<p>'And there you are.' Asleep says to me in Dinty Moore's.</p>

<p>'So,' I say, 'you are now back in New York looking for business again?'</p>

<p>'Oh, no,' Asleep says. 'I now reside in Miami, Florida, and I am going to
marry Miss Anna Lark next month. I am doing very well for myself, too,' he
says. 'You see, we turn the property that I get from General Vega into a
cemetery, and I am now selling lots in same for our firm which is headed by
Miss Anna Lark's papa. Manuel is our head grave-digger, and we are all very
happy,' Asleep says.</p>

<p>Well, afterward I hear that the first lot Asleep sells is to the family of
the late Benny Barker, the bookie, who passes away during the race meeting in
Miami, Florida, of pneumonia, superinduced by lying out all night in a ditch
full of water near the home of Miss Anna Lark, although I also understand that
the fact that Benny is tied up in a sack in the ditch is considered a slight
contributing cause of his last illness.</p>


<h3><a name="A_Piece_of_Pie" id="A_Piece_of_Pie">A Piece of Pie</a></h3>

<p>On Boylston Street, in the city of Boston, Mass., there is a joint
where you can get as nice a broiled lobster as anybody ever slaps a lip
over, and who is in there one evening partaking of this tidbit but a
character by the name of Horse Thief and me.</p>

<p>This Horse Thief is called Horsey for short, and he is not called
by this name because he ever steals a horse but because it is the
consensus of public opinion from coast to coast that he may steal one
if the opportunity presents.</p>

<p>Personally, I consider Horsey a very fine character, because any time
he is holding anything he is willing to share his good fortune with
one and all, and at this time in Boston he is holding plenty. It is
the time we make the race meeting at Suffolk Downs, and Horsey gets to
going very good, indeed, and in fact he is now a character of means,
and is my host against the broiled lobster.</p>

<p>Well, at a table next to us are four or five characters who all seem to
be well-dressed, and stout-set, and red-faced, and prosperous-looking,
and who all speak with the true Boston accent, which consists of many
ah's and very few r's. Characters such as these are familiar to anybody
who is ever in Boston very much, and they are bound to be politicians,
retired cops, or contractors, because Boston is really quite infested
with characters of this nature.</p>

<p>I am paying no attention to them, because they are drinking local ale,
and talking loud, and long ago I learn that when a Boston character
is engaged in aleing himself up, it is a good idea to let him alone,
because the best you can get out of him is maybe a boff on the beezer.
But Horsey is in there on the old Ear-ie, and very much interested in
their conversation, and finally I listen myself just to hear what is
attracting his attention, when one of the characters speaks as follows:</p>

<p>'Well,' he says, 'I am willing to bet ten thousand dollars that he can
outeat anybody in the United States any time.'</p>

<p>Now at this. Horsey gets right up and steps over to the table and bows
and smiles in a friendly way on one and all, and says:</p>

<p>'Gentlemen,' he says, 'pardon the intrusion, and excuse me for billing
in, but,' he says, 'do I understand you are speaking of a great eater
who resides in your fair city?'</p>

<p>Well, these Boston characters all gaze at Horsey in such a hostile
manner that I am expecting any one of them to get up and request him to
let them miss him, but he keeps on bowing and smiling, and they can see
that he is a gentleman, and finally one of them says:</p>

<p>'Yes,' he says, 'we are speaking of a character by the name of Joel
Duffle. He is without doubt the greatest eater alive. He just wins a
unique wager. He bets a character from Bangor, Me., that he can eat a
whole window display of oysters in this very restaurant, and he not
only eats all the oysters but he then wishes to wager that he can
also eat the shells, but,' he says, 'it seems that the character from
Bangor, Me., unfortunately taps out on the first proposition and has
nothing with which to bet on the second.'</p>

<p>'Very interesting,' Horsey says. 'Very interesting, if true, but,' he
says, 'unless my ears deceive me, I hear one of you state that he is
willing to wager ten thousand dollars on this eater of yours against
anybody in the United States.'</p>

<p>'Your ears are perfect,' another of the Boston characters says. 'I
state it, although,' he says, 'I admit it is a sort of figure of
speech. But I state it all right,' he says, 'and never let it be said
that a Conway ever pigs it on a betting proposition.'</p>

<p>'Well,' Horsey says, 'I do not have a tenner on me at the moment, but,'
he says, 'I have here a thousand dollars to put up as a forfeit that I
can produce a character who will outeat your party for ten thousand,
and as much more as you care to put up.' And with this. Horsey outs
with a bundle of coarse notes and tosses it on the table, and right
away one of the Boston characters, whose name turns out to be Carroll,
slaps his hand on the money and says:</p>

<p>'Bet.'</p>

<p>Well, now this is prompt action to be sure, and if there is one thing I
admire more than anything else, it is action, and I can see that these
are characters of true sporting instincts and I commence wondering
where I can raise a few dibs to take a piece of Horsey's proposition,
because of course I know that he has nobody in mind to do the eating
for his side but Nicely-Nicely Jones.</p>

<p>And knowing Nicely-Nicely Jones, I am prepared to wager all the money I
can possibly raise that he can outeat anything that walks on two legs.
In fact, I will take a chance on Nicely-Nicely against anything on four
legs, except maybe an elephant, and at that he may give the elephant a
photo finish.</p>

<p>I do not say that Nicely-Nicely is the greatest eater in all history,
but what I do say is he belongs up there as a contender. In fact.
Professor D., who is a professor in a college out West before he
turns to playing the horses for a livelihood, and who makes a study
of history in his time, says he will not be surprised but what
Nicely-Nicely figures one-two.</p>

<p>Professor D. says we must always remember that Nicely-Nicely eats under
the handicaps of modern civilization, which require that an eater use
a knife and fork, or anyway a knife, while in the old days eating with
the hands was a popular custom and much faster. Professor D. says he
has no doubt that under the old rules Nicely-Nicely will hang up a
record that will endure through the ages, but of course maybe Professor
D. overlays Nicely-Nicely somewhat.</p>

<p>Well, now that the match is agreed upon, naturally Horsey and the
Boston characters begin discussing where it is to take place, and one
of the Boston characters suggests a neutral ground, such as New London,
Conn., or Providence, R. I., but Horsey holds out for New York, and it
seems that Boston characters are always ready to visit New York, so he
does not meet with any great opposition on this point.</p>

<p>They all agree on a date four weeks later so as to give the principals
plenty of time to get ready, although Horsey and I know that this is
really unnecessary as far as Nicely-Nicely is concerned, because one
thing about him is he is always in condition to eat.</p>

<p>Nicely-Nicely is called by this name because any time anybody asks him
how he feels, or how he is doing, he always says nicely, nicely, and
the consequence is he goes through life a constant perjurer, at least
on how he is doing. He is a character who is maybe five feet eight
inches tall, and about five feet nine inches wide, and when he is in
good shape he will weigh upward of 283 pounds. He is a horse player
by trade, and eating is really just a hobby, but he is undoubtedly a
wonderful eater even when he is not hungry.</p>

<p>Well, as soon as Horsey and I return to New York, we hasten to Mindy's
restaurant on Broadway and relate the bet Horsey makes in Boston, and
right away so many citizens, including Mindy himself, wish to take a
piece of the proposition that it is oversubscribed by a large sum in no
time.</p>

<p>Then Mindy remarks that he does not see Nicely-Nicely Jones for a month
of Sundays, and then everybody present remembers that they do not see
Nicely-Nicely around lately, either, and this leads to a discussion
of where Nicely-Nicely can be, although up to this moment if nobody
sees Nicely-Nicely but once in the next ten years it will be considered
sufficient.</p>

<p>Well, Willie the Worrier, who is a bookmaker by trade, is among those
present, and he remembers that the last time he looks for Nicely-Nicely
hoping to collect a marker of some years standing, Nicely-Nicely is
living at the Rest Hotel in West 49th Street, and nothing will do
Horsey but I must go with him over to the Rest to make inquiry for
Nicely-Nicely, and there we learn that he leaves a forwarding address
away up on Morningside Heights in care of somebody by the name of
Slocum.</p>

<p>So Horsey calls a short, and away we go to this address, which turns
out to be a five-story walk-up apartment, and a card downstairs
shows that Slocum lives on the top floor. It takes Horsey and me ten
minutes to walk up the five flights as we are by no means accustomed
to exercise of this nature, and when we finally reach a door marked
Slocum, we are plumb tuckered out, and have to sit down on the top step
and rest awhile.</p>

<p>Then I ring the bell at this door marked Slocum, and who appears but
a tall young Judy with black hair who is without doubt beautiful, but
who is so skinny we have to look twice to see her, and when I ask her
if she can give me any information about a party named Nicely-Nicely
Jones, she says to me like this:</p>

<p>'I guess you mean Quentin,' she says. 'Yes,' she says, 'Quentin is
here. Come in, gentlemen.'</p>

<p>So we step into an apartment, and as we do so a thin, sickly-looking
character gets up out of a chair by the window, and in a weak voice
says good evening. It is a good evening, at that, so Horsey and I say
good evening right back at him, very polite, and then we stand there
waiting for Nicely-Nicely to appear, when the beautiful skinny young
Judy says:</p>

<p>'Well,' she says, 'this is Mr. Quentin Jones.'</p>

<p>Then Horsey and I take another swivel at the thin character, and we
can see that it is nobody but Nicely-Nicely, at that, but the way he
changes since we last observe him is practically shocking to us both,
because he is undoubtedly all shrunk up. In fact, he looks as if he is
about half what he is in his prime, and his face is pale and thin, and
his eyes are away back in his head, and while we both shake hands with
him it is some time before either of us is able to speak. Then Horsey
finally says:</p>

<p>'Nicely,' he says, 'can we have a few words with you in private on a
very important proposition.'</p>

<p>Well, at this, and before Nicely-Nicely can answer aye, yes or no,
the beautiful skinny young Judy goes out of the room and slams a door
behind her, and Nicely-Nicely says:</p>

<p>'My fiancée, Miss Hilda Slocum,' he says. 'She is a wonderful
character. We are to be married as soon as I lose twenty pounds more.
It will take a couple of weeks longer,' he says.</p>

<p>'My goodness gracious. Nicely,' Horsey says. 'What do you mean lose
twenty pounds more? You are practically emaciated now. Are you just out
of a sick bed, or what?'</p>

<p>'Why,' Nicely-Nicely says, 'certainly I am not out of a sick bed. I
am never healthier in my life. I am on a diet. I lose eighty-three
pounds in two months, and am now down to 200. I feel great,' he says.
'It is all because of my fiancée, Miss Hilda Slocum. She rescues me
from gluttony and obesity, or anyway,' Nicely-Nicely says, 'this is
what Miss Hilda Slocum calls it. My, I feel good. I love Miss Hilda
Slocum very much,' Nicely-Nicely says. 'It is a case of love at first
sight on both sides the day we meet in the subway. I am wedged in one
of the turnstile gates, and she kindly pushes on me from behind until
I wiggle through. I can see she has a kind heart, so I date her up for
a movie that night and propose to her while the newsreel is on. But,'
Nicely-Nicely says, 'Hilda tells me at once that she will never marry a
fat slob. She says I must put myself in her hands and she will reduce
me by scientific methods and then she will become my ever-loving wife,
but not before.</p>

<p>'So,' Nicely-Nicely says, 'I come to live here with Miss Hilda Slocum
and her mother, so she can supervise my diet. Her mother is thinner
than Hilda. And I surely feel great,' Nicely-Nicely says. 'Look,' he
says.</p>

<p>And with this, he pulls out the waistband of his pants, and shows
enough spare space to hide War Admiral in, but the effort seems to be a
strain on him, and he has to sit down in his chair again.</p>

<p>'My goodness gracious,' Horsey says. 'What do you eat, Nicely?'</p>

<p>'Well,' Nicely-Nicely says, 'I eat anything that does not contain
starch, but,' he says, 'of course everything worth eating contains
starch, so I really do not eat much of anything whatever. My fiancée,
Miss Hilda Slocum, arranges my diet. She is an expert dietitian and
runs a widely known department on diet in a magazine by the name of
<i>Let's Keep House</i>.'</p>

<p>Then Horsey tells Nicely-Nicely of how he is matched to eat against
this Joel Duffle, of Boston, for a nice side bet, and how he has a
forfeit of a thousand dollars already posted for appearance, and how
many of Nicely-Nicely's admirers along Broadway are looking to win
themselves out of all their troubles by betting on him, and at first
Nicely-Nicely listens with great interest, and his eyes are shining
like six bits, but then he becomes very sad, and says:</p>

<p>'It is no use, gentlemen,' he says. 'My fiancée, Miss Hilda Slocum,
will never hear of me going off my diet even for a little while. Only
yesterday I try to talk her into letting me have a little pumpernickel
instead of toasted whole wheat bread, and she says if I even think of
such a thing again, she will break our engagement. Horsey,' he says,
'do you ever eat toasted whole-wheat bread for a month hand running?
Toasted?' he says.</p>

<p>'No,' Horsey says. 'What I eat is nice, white French bread, and corn
muffins, and hot biscuits with gravy on them.'</p>

<p>'Stop,' Nicely-Nicely says. 'You are eating yourself into an early
grave, and, furthermore,' he says, 'you are breaking my heart. But,'
he says, 'the more I think of my following depending on me in this
emergency, the sadder it makes me feel to think I am unable to oblige
them. However,' he says, 'let us call Miss Hilda Slocum in on an
outside chance and see what her reactions to your proposition are.'</p>

<p>So we call Miss Hilda Slocum in, and Horsey explains our predicament in
putting so much faith in Nicely-Nicely only to find him dieting, and
Miss Hilda Slocum's reactions are to order Horsey and me out of the
joint with instructions never to darken her door again, and when we
are a block away we can still hear her voice speaking very firmly to
Nicely-Nicely.</p>

<p>Well, personally, I figure this ends the matter, for I can see that
Miss Hilda Slocum is a most determined character, indeed, and the
chances are it does end it, at that, if Horsey does not happen to get a
wonderful break.</p>

<p>He is at Belmont Park one afternoon, and he has a real good thing in
a jump race, and when a brisk young character in a hard straw hat and
eyeglasses comes along and asks him what he likes. Horsey mentions this
good thing, figuring he will move himself in for a few dibs if the good
thing connects.</p>

<p>Well, it connects all right, and the brisk young character is very
grateful to Horsey for his information, and is giving him plenty of
much-obliges, and nothing else, and Horsey is about to mention that
they do not accept much-obliges at his hotel, when the brisk young
character mentions that he is nobody but Mr. McBurgle and that he is
the editor of the <i>Let's Keep House</i> magazine, and for Horsey to drop in
and see him any time he is around his way.</p>

<p>Naturally, Horsey remembers what Nicely-Nicely says about Miss Hilda
Slocum working for this <i>Let's Keep House</i> magazine, and he relates the
story of the eating contest to Mr. McBurgle and asks him if he will
kindly use his influence with Miss Hilda Slocum to get her to release
Nicely-Nicely from his diet long enough for the contest. Then Horsey
gives Mr. McBurgle a tip on another winner, and Mr. McBurgle must use
plenty of influence on Miss Hilda Slocum at once, as the next day she
calls Horsey up at his hotel before he is out of bed, and speaks to him
as follows:</p>

<p>'Of course,' Miss Hilda Slocum says, 'I will never change my attitude
about Quentin, but,' she says, 'I can appreciate that he feels very bad
about you gentlemen relying on him and having to disappoint you. He
feels that he lets you down, which is by no means true, but it weighs
upon his mind. It is interfering with his diet.'</p>

<p>'Now,' Miss Hilda Slocum says, 'I do not approve of your contest,
because,' she says, 'it is placing a premium on gluttony, but I have
a friend by the name of Miss Violette Shumberger who may answer
your purpose. She is my dearest friend from childhood, but it is
only because I love her dearly that this friendship endures. She is
extremely fond of eating,' Miss Hilda Slocum says. 'In spite of my
pleadings, and my warnings, and my own example, she persists in food.
It is disgusting to me but I finally learn that it is no use arguing
with her.</p>

<p>'She remains my dearest friend,' Miss Hilda Slocum says, 'though
she continues her practice of eating, and I am informed that she is
phenomenal in this respect. In fact,' she says, 'Nicely-Nicely tells
me to say to you that if Miss Violette Shumberger can perform the
eating exploits I relate to him from hearsay she is a lily. Goodbye,'
Miss Hilda Slocum says. 'You cannot have Nicely-Nicely.'</p>

<p>Well, nobody cares much about this idea of a stand-in for Nicely-Nicely
in such a situation, and especially a Judy that no one ever hears of
before, and many citizens are in favor of pulling out of the contest
altogether. But Horsey has his thousand-dollar forfeit to think of, and
as no one can suggest anyone else, he finally arranges a personal meet
with the Judy suggested by Miss Hilda Slocum.</p>

<p>He comes into Mindy's one evening with a female character who is so
fat it is necessary to push three tables together to give her room for
her lap, and it seems that this character is Miss Violette Shumberger.
She weighs maybe 250 pounds, but she is by no means an old Judy, and
by no means bad-looking. She has a face the size of a town clock and
enough chins for a fire escape, but she has a nice smile, and pretty
teeth, and a laugh that is so hearty it knocks the whipped cream off an
order of strawberry shortcake on a table fifty feet away and arouses
the indignation of a customer by the name of Goldstein who is about to
consume same.</p>

<p>Well, Horsey's idea in bringing her into Mindy's is to get some kind
of line on her eating form, and she is clocked by many experts when
she starts putting on the hot meat, and it is agreed by one and all
that she is by no means a selling-plater. In fact, by the time she
gets through, even Mindy admits she has plenty of class, and the upshot
of it all is Miss Violette Shumberger is chosen to eat against Joel
Duffle. Maybe you hear something of this great eating contest that
comes off in New York one night in the early summer of 1937. Of course
eating contests are by no means anything new, and in fact they are
quite an old-fashioned pastime in some sections of this country, such
as the South and East, but this is the first big public contest of the
kind in years, and it creates no little comment along Broadway.</p>

<p>In fact, there is some mention of it in the blats, and it is not a
frivolous proposition in any respect, and more dough is wagered on it
than any other eating contest in history, with Joel Duffle a 6 to 5
favorite over Miss Violette Shumberger all the way through.</p>

<p>This Joel Duffle comes to New York several days before the contest with
the character by the name of Conway, and requests a meet with Miss
Violette Shumberger to agree on the final details and who shows up with
Miss Violette Shumberger as her coach and adviser but Nicely-Nicely
Jones. He is even thinner and more peaked-looking than when Horsey and
I see him last, but he says he feels great, and that he is within six
pounds of his marriage to Miss Hilda Slocum.</p>

<p>Well, it seems that his presence is really due to Miss Hilda Slocum
herself, because she says that after getting her dearest friend Miss
Violette Shumberger into this jack-pot, it is only fair to do all she
can to help her win it, and the only way she can think of is to let
Nicely-Nicely give Violette the benefit of his experience and advice.</p>

<p>But afterward we learn that what really happens is that this editor,
Mr. McBurgle, gets greatly interested in the contest, and when he
discovers that in spite of his influence. Miss Hilda Slocum declines to
permit Nicely-Nicely to personally compete, but puts in a pinch eater,
he is quite indignant and insists on her letting Nicely-Nicely school
Violette.</p>

<p>Furthermore we afterward learn that when Nicely-Nicely returns to the
apartment on Morningside Heights after giving Violette a lesson, Miss
Hilda Slocum always smells his breath to see if he indulges in any food
during his absence.</p>

<p>Well, this Joel Duffle is a tall character with stooped shoulders, and
a sad expression, and he does not look as if he can eat his way out of
a tea shoppe, but as soon as he commences to discuss the details of the
contest, anybody can see that he knows what time it is in situations
such as this. In fact, Nicely-Nicely says he can tell at once from
the way Joel Duffle talks that he is a dangerous opponent, and he says
while Miss Violette Shumberger impresses him as an improving eater, he
is only sorry she does not have more seasoning.</p>

<p>This Joel Duffle suggests that the contest consist of twelve courses
of strictly American food, each side to be allowed to pick six dishes,
doing the picking in rotation, and specifying the weight and quantity
of the course selected to any amount the contestant making the pick
desires, and each course is to be divided for eating exactly in half,
and after Miss Violette Shumberger and Nicely-Nicely whisper together a
while, they say the terms are quite satisfactory.</p>

<p>Then Horsey tosses a coin for the first pick, and Joel Duffle says
heads, and it is heads, and he chooses, as the first course, two quarts
of ripe olives, twelve bunches of celery, and four pounds of shelled
nuts, all this to be split fifty-fifty between them. Miss Violette
Shumberger names twelve dozen cherrystone clams as the second course,
and Joe Duffle says two gallons of Philadelphia pepperpot soup as the
third.</p>

<p>Well, Miss Violette Shumberger and Nicely-Nicely whisper together
again, and Violette puts in two five-pound striped bass, the heads
and tails not to count in the eating, and Joel Duffle names a
twenty-two-pound roast turkey. Each vegetable is rated as one course,
and Miss Violette Shumberger asks for twelve pounds of mashed potatoes
with brown gravy. Joel Duffle says two dozen ears of corn on the cob,
and Violette replies with two quarts of lima beans. Joel Duffle calls
for twelve bunches of asparagus cooked in butter, and Violette mentions
ten pounds of stewed new peas.</p>

<p>This gets them down to the salad, and it is Joel Duffle's play, so he
says six pounds of mixed green salad with vinegar and oil dressing,
and now Miss Violette Shumberger has the final selection, which is the
dessert. She says it is a pumpkin pie, two feet across, and not less
than three inches deep.</p>

<p>It is agreed that they must eat with knife, fork or spoon, but speed
is not to count, and there is to be no time limit, except they cannot
pause more than two consecutive minutes at any stage, except in case
of hiccoughs. They can drink anything, and as much as they please, but
liquids are not to count in the scoring. The decision is to be strictly
on amount of food consumed, and the judges are to take account of
anything left on the plates after a course, but not of loose chewings
on bosom or vest up to an ounce. The losing side is to pay for the
food, and in case of a tie they are to eat it off immediately on ham
and eggs only.</p>

<p>Well, the scene of this contest is the second-floor dining room of
Mindy's restaurant, which is closed to the general public for the
occasion, and only parties immediately concerned in the contest are
admitted. The contestants are seated on either side of a big table in
the center of the room, and each contestant has three waiters.</p>

<p>No talking, and no rooting from the spectators is permitted, but of
course in any eating contest the principals may speak to each other if
they wish, though smart eaters never wish to do this, as talking only
wastes energy, and about all they ever say to each other is please pass
the mustard.</p>

<p>About fifty characters from Boston are present to witness the contest,
and the same number of citizens of New York are admitted, and among
them is this editor, Mr. McBurgle, and he is around asking Horsey if he
thinks Miss Violette Shumberger is as good a thing as the jumper at the
race track.</p>

<p>Nicely-Nicely arrives on the scene quite early, and his appearance is
really most distressing to his old friends and admirers, as by this
time he is shy so much weight that he is a pitiful scene, to be sure,
but he tells Horsey and me that he thinks Miss Violette Shumberger has
a good chance.</p>

<p>'Of course,' he says, 'she is green. She does not know how to pace
herself in competition. But,' he says, 'she has a wonderful style. I
love to watch her eat. She likes the same things I do in the days when
I am eating. She is a wonderful character, too. Do you ever notice her
smile?' Nicely-Nicely says.</p>

<p>'But,' he says, 'she is the dearest friend of my fiancée, Miss Hilda
Slocum, so let us not speak of this. I try to get Hilda to come to see
the contest, but she says it is repulsive. Well, anyway,' Nicely-Nicely
says, 'I manage to borrow a few dibs, and am wagering on Miss Violette
Shumberger. By the way,' he says, 'if you happen to think of it, notice
her smile.'</p>

<p>Well, Nicely-Nicely takes a chair about ten feet behind Miss Violette
Shumberger, which is as close as the judges will allow him, and he is
warned by them that no coaching from the corners will be permitted,
but of course Nicely-Nicely knows this rule as well as they do, and
furthermore by this time his exertions seem to have left him without
any more energy.</p>

<p>There are three judges, and they are all from neutral territory.
One of these judges is a party from Baltimore, Md., by the name of
Packard, who runs a restaurant, and another is a party from Providence,
R. I., by the name of Croppers, who is a sausage manufacturer. The
third judge is an old Judy by the name of Mrs. Rhubarb, who comes
from Philadelphia, and once keeps an actors' boardinghouse, and is
considered an excellent judge of eaters.</p>

<p>Well, Mindy is the official starter, and at 8:30 P. M. sharp, when
there is still much betting among the spectators, he outs with his
watch, and says like this:</p>

<p>'Are you ready, Boston? Are you ready, New York?'</p>

<p>Miss Violette Shumberger and Joel Duffle both nod their heads, and
Mindy says commence, and the contest is on, with Joel Duffle getting
the jump at once on the celery and olives and nuts.</p>

<p>It is apparent that this Joel Duffle is one of these rough-and-tumble
eaters that you can hear quite a distance off, especially on clams
and soups. He is also an eyebrow eater, an eater whose eyebrows go up
as high as the part in his hair as he eats, and this type of eater is
undoubtedly very efficient.</p>

<p>In fact, the way Joel Duffle goes through the groceries down to the
turkey causes the Broadway spectators some uneasiness, and they are
whispering to each other that they only wish the old Nicely-Nicely is
in there. But personally, I like the way Miss Violette Shumberger eats
without undue excitement, and with great zest. She cannot keep close to
Joel Duffle in the matter of speed in the early stages of the contest,
as she seems to enjoy chewing her food, but I observe that as it goes
along she pulls up on him, and I figure this is not because she is
stepping up her pace, but because he is slowing down.</p>

<p>When the turkey finally comes on, and is split in two halves right down
the middle. Miss Violette Shumberger looks greatly disappointed, and
she speaks for the first time as follows:</p>

<p>'Why,' she says, 'where is the stuffing?'</p>

<p>Well, it seems that nobody mentions any stuffing for the turkey to the
chef, so he does not make any stuffing, and Miss Violette Shumberger's
disappointment is so plain to be seen that the confidence of the Boston
characters is somewhat shaken. They can see that a Judy who can pack
away as much fodder as Miss Violette Shumberger has to date, and then
beef for stuffing, is really quite an eater.</p>

<p>In fact, Joel Duffle looks quite startled when he observes Miss
Violette Shumberger's disappointment, and he gazes at her with great
respect as she disposes of her share of the turkey, and the mashed
potatoes, and one thing and another in such a manner that she moves
up on the pumpkin pie on dead even terms with him. In fact, there is
little to choose between them at this point, although the judge from
Baltimore is calling the attention of the other judges to a turkey
leg that he claims Miss Violette Shumberger does not clean as neatly
as Joel Duffle does his, but the other judges dismiss this as a
technicality.</p>

<p>Then the waiters bring on the pumpkin pie, and it is without doubt
quite a large pie, and in fact it is about the size of a manhole
cover, and I can see that Joel Duffle is observing this pie with a
strange expression on his face, although to tell the truth I do not
care for the expression on Miss Violette Shumberger's face, either.
Well, the pie is cut in two dead center, and one half is placed before
Miss Violette Shumberger, and the other half before Joel Duffle, and
he does not take more than two bites before I see him loosen his
waistband and take a big swig of water, and thinks I to myself, he
is now down to a slow walk, and the pie will decide the whole heat,
and I am only wishing I am able to wager a little more dough on Miss
Violette Shumberger. But about this moment, and before she as much as
touches her pie, all of a sudden Violette turns her head and motions to
Nicely-Nicely to approach her, and as he approaches, she whispers in
his ear.</p>

<p>Now at this, the Boston character by the name of Conway jumps up and
claims a foul, and several other Boston characters join him in this
claim, and so does Joel Duffle, although afterwards even the Boston
characters admit that Joel Duffle is no gentleman to make such a claim
against a lady.</p>

<p>Well, there is some confusion over this, and the judges hold a
conference, and they rule that there is certainly no foul in the actual
eating that they can see, because Miss Violette Shumberger does not
touch her pie so far.</p>

<p>But they say that whether it is a foul otherwise all depends on whether
Miss Violette Shumberger is requesting advice on the contest from
Nicely-Nicely and the judge from Providence, R. I., wishes to know if
Nicely-Nicely will kindly relate what passes between him and Violette
so they may make a decision.</p>

<p>'Why,' Nicely-Nicely says, 'all she asks me is can I get her another
piece of pie when she finishes the one in front of her.'</p>

<p>Now at this, Joel Duffle throws down his knife, and pushes back his
plate with all but two bites of his pie left on it, and says to the
Boston characters like this:</p>

<p>'Gentlemen,' he says, 'I am licked. I cannot eat another mouthful. You
must admit I put up a game battle, but,' he says, 'it is useless for me
to go on against this Judy who is asking for more pie before she even
starts on what is before her. I am almost dying as it is, and I do not
wish to destroy myself in a hopeless effort. Gentlemen,' he says, 'she
is not human.'</p>

<p>Well, of course this amounts to throwing in the old napkin and
Nicely-Nicely stands up on his chair, and says:</p>

<p>'Three cheers for Miss Violette Shumberger!'</p>

<p>Then Nicely-Nicely gives the first cheer in person, but the effort
overtaxes his strength, and he falls off the chair in a faint just as
Joel Duffle collapses under the table, and the doctors at the Clinic
Hospital are greatly baffled to receive, from the same address at the
same time, one patient who is suffering from undernourishment, and
another patient who is unconscious from overeating.</p>

<p>Well, in the meantime, after the excitement subsides, and wagers are
settled, we take Miss Violette Shumberger to the main floor in Mindy's
for a midnight snack, and when she speaks of her wonderful triumph, she
is disposed to give much credit to Nicely-Nicely Jones.</p>

<p>'You see,' Violette says, 'what I really whisper to him is that I am a
goner. I whisper to him that I cannot possibly take one bite of the pie
if my life depends on it, and if he has any bets down to try and hedge
them off as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>'I fear,' she says, 'that Nicely-Nicely will be greatly disappointed
in my showing, but I have a confession to make to him when he gets out
of the hospital. I forget about the contest,' Violette says, 'and eat
my regular dinner of pig's knuckles and sauerkraut an hour before the
contest starts, and,' she says, 'I have no doubt this tends to affect
my form somewhat. So,' she says, 'I owe everything to Nicely-Nicely's
quick thinking.'</p>

<p>It is several weeks after the great eating contest that I run into Miss
Hilda Slocum on Broadway, and it seems to me that she looks much better
nourished than the last time I see her, and when I mention this she
says:</p>

<p>'Yes,' she says, 'I cease dieting. I learn my lesson,' she says. 'I
learn that male characters do not appreciate anybody who tries to ward
off surplus tissue. What male characters wish is substance. Why,' she
says, 'only a week ago my editor, Mr. McBurgle, tells me he will love
to take me dancing if only I get something on me for him to take hold
of. I am very fond of dancing,' she says.</p>

<p>'But,' I say, 'what of Nicely-Nicely Jones? I do not see him around
lately.'</p>

<p>'Why,' Miss Hilda Slocum says, 'do you not hear what this cad does?
Why, as soon as he is strong enough to leave the hospital, he elopes
with my dearest friend, Miss Violette Shumberger, leaving me a note
saying something about two souls with but a single thought. They are
down in Florida running a barbecue stand, and,' she says, 'the chances
are, eating like seven mules.'</p>

<p>'Miss Slocum,' I say, 'can I interest you in a portion of Mindy's
chicken fricassee?'</p>

<p>'With dumplings?' Miss Hilda Slocum says. 'Yes,' she says, 'you can.
Afterwards I have a date to go dancing with Mr. McBurgle. I am crazy
about dancing,' she says.

</p><h3><a name="A_Job_for_the_Macarone" id="A_Job_for_the_Macarone">A Job for the Macarone</a></h3>
<p>When the last race meeting of the winter season closes in Miami and it is
time for one and all to move on to Maryland, I take a swivel at the weather
reports one day and I observe that it is still down around freezing in those
parts.</p>

<p>So thinks I to myself, I will remain in the sunny southland a while longer
and continue enjoying the balmy breezes, and the ocean bathing, and all this
and that, until the weather settles up yonder, and also until I acquire a blow
stake, for at this time my bank-roll is worn down to a nubbin and, in fact, I
do not have enough ready to get myself as far as Jax, even by walking.</p>

<p>Well, while waiting around Miami, trying to think of some way of making a
scratch, I spend my evenings in the Shark Fin Grill, which is a little scatter
on Biscayne Boulevard near the docks that is conducted by a friend of mine by
the name of Chesty Charles.</p>

<p>He is called by this name because he has a chest like a tub and he walks
with it stuck out in front of him, and the reason Charles keeps his chest out
is because if he pulls it in, his stomach will take its place, only farther
down, and Charles does not wish his stomach to show in this manner, as he likes
to think he has a nice shape.</p>

<p>At the time I am speaking of, Chesty Charles is not as young as he used to
be, and he wishes to go along very quiet and avoiding undue excitement, but
anybody can see that he is such a character as observes a few things in his
time. In fact, anybody can see that he is such a character as is around and
about no little and quite some before he settles down to conducting the Shark
Fin Grill.</p>

<p>The reason Charles calls his place the Shark Fin Grill is because it sounds
nice, although, of course, Charles does not really grill anything there, and,
personally, I think the name is somewhat confusing to strangers.</p>

<p>In fact, one night a character with a beard, from Rumson, New Jersey, comes
in and orders a grilled porterhouse; and when he learns he cannot get same, he
lets out a chirp that Charles has no right to call his place a grill when he
does not grill anything and claims that Charles is obtaining money under false
pretences.</p>

<p>It finally becomes necessary for Charles to tap him on the pimple with a
beer mallet, and afterward the constables come around, saying what is going on
here, and what do you mean by tapping people with beer mallets, and the only
way Charles can wiggle out of it is by stating that the character with the
beard claims that Mae West has no sex appeal. So the constables go away saying
Charles does quite right and one of them has half a mind to tap the character
himself with something.</p>

<p>Well, anyway, one night I am in the Shark Fin Grill playing rummy with
Charles and there is nobody else whatever in the joint, because, by this time,
the quiet season is on in Miami and Charles's business thins out more than
somewhat; and just as I beat Charles a pretty good score, who comes in but two
characters in sport shirts, and one of them has that thing in his hand and he
says to us like this:</p>

<p>'Reach,' he says. 'This is a stick-up. No beefs, now,' he says.</p>

<p>Well, Chesty Charles and me raise our hands as high as possible, and, in
fact, I am only sorry I cannot raise mine higher than possible, and Chesty
Charles says: 'No beefs,' he says. 'But,' he says, 'boys, you are on an awful
bust. All you are liable to get around this drum is fleas. If there is any
dough here I will be using it myself,' Chesty says.</p>

<p>'Well,' one of the characters says, 'we will have a look at your damper,
anyway. Maybe you overlook a few coarse notes here and there.'</p>

<p>So one character keeps that thing pointed at Chesty Charles and me, and the
other goes through the cash register, but, just as Charles says, there is
nothing in it. Then the character comes over and gives Charles and me a
fanning, but all he finds is eighty cents on Charles, and he seems inclined to
be a little vexed at the scarcity of ready between us and he acts as if he is
thinking of clouting us around some for our shortage, as these git-'em-up
characters will sometimes do if they are vexed, when all of a sudden Charles
looks at one of the characters and speaks as follows:</p>

<p>'Why,' Chesty Charles says, 'do my eyes deceive me, or do I behold The
Macarone, out of Kansas City?'</p>

<p>'Why, yes,' the character says. 'Why, hello, Chesty,' he says. 'Meet my
friend Willie,' he says. 'He is out of Kansas City too. Why, I never expect to
find you in such a joint as this, Chesty,' he says. 'Especially a joint where
there is so little dough.'</p>

<p>'Well,' Chesty Charles says, 'you ought to drop around when the season is
on. Things are livelier then. But,' he says, 'sit down and let's have a talk. I
am glad to see you, Mac,' he says.</p>

<p>So they sit down and Chesty Charles puts out a bottle of Scotch and some
glasses and we become quite sociable, to be sure, and presently The Macarone is
explaining that Willie and him have been over in Havana all winter, working
with a pay-off mob out of Indianapolis, Indiana, that has a store there, but
that business is rotten, and they are now en route north and just stop over in
Miami to pick up a few dibs, if possible, for walk-about money.</p>

<p>The Macarone seems to be quite an interesting character in many respects and
I can see that he and Charles know each other from several places. The Macarone
is maybe around forty and he is tall and black-looking, but the character he
calls Willie is younger and by no means gabby, and, in fact, he scarcely has a
word to say. We sit there quite a while drinking Scotches and speaking of this
and that, and finally Chesty Charles says to The Macarone:</p>

<p>'Mac,' he says, 'come to think of it, I may be able to drop something in
your lap, at that. Only last night a character is in here with a right nice
proposition, but,' Chesty says, 'it is not in my line, so it does not interest
me.'</p>

<p>'Chesty,' The Macarone says, 'any proposition that is not in your line must
be a very unusual proposition indeed. Let me hear this one,' he says.</p>

<p>'Well,' Chesty says, 'it is a trifle unusual, but,' he says, 'it seems quite
sound, and I only regret that I cannot handle it in person. I am froze in here
with this business and I do not feel free to engage in any outside enterprises.
The character I refer to,' he says, 'is Mr. Cleeburn T. Box, who lives on a big
estate over here on the bay front with his nephew. Mr. Cleeburn T. Box wishes
to quit these earthly scenes,' Chesty says. 'He is sick and tired of living.
His nerves are shot to pieces. He cannot eat. He is in tough shape.</p>

<p>'But,' Chesty says, 'he finds he does not have the nerve to push himself
off. So he wishes to find some good reliable party to push him off, for which
service he will pay five thousand dollars cash money. He will deposit the dough
with me,' Chesty says. 'He realizes that I am quite trustworthy. It is a soft
touch, Mac,' he says. 'Of course,' he says, 'I am entitled to the usual
twenty-five per cent. commission for finding the plant.'</p>

<p>'Well,' The Macarone says, 'this Mr. Box must be quite an eccentric
character. But,' he says, 'I can understand his reluctance about pushing
himself off. Personally, I will not care to push myself off. However,' he says,
'the proposition seems to have complications. I hear it is against the law in
Florida to push people off, even if they wish to be pushed.'</p>

<p>'Well,' Chesty says, 'Mr. Box thinks of this too. His idea is that the party
who is to do this service for him will slip into his house over on the bay
front some night and push him off while he is asleep, so he will never know
what happens to him. You understand, he wishes this matter to be as unexpected
and painless as possible. Then,' Chesty says, 'the party can leave that thing
with which he does the pushing on the premises and it will look as if Mr. Box
does the pushing in person.'</p>

<p>'What about a club?' The Macarone says. 'Or maybe a shiv? That thing makes a
lot of racket.'</p>

<p>'Why,' Chesty says, 'how can you make a club or shiv look like anything but
something illegal if you use them to push anybody? You need not be afraid of
making a racket, because,' he says, 'no one lives within hearing distance of
the joint, and Mr. Box will see that all his servants and everybody else are
away from the place every night, once I give him the word the deal is on. He
will place the dough at my disposal when he gets this word. Of course he does
not wish to know what night it is to happen, but it must be some night soon
after the transaction is agreed to.'</p>

<p>'Well,' The Macarone says, 'this is one of the most interesting and unusual
propositions ever presented to me. Personally,' he says, 'I do not see why Mr.
Box does not get somebody to put something in his tea. Anybody will be glad to
do him such a favour.'</p>

<p>'He is afraid of suffering,' Chesty Charles says. 'He is one of the most
nervous characters I ever encounter in my life. Look, Mac,' he says, 'this is a
job that scarcely requires human intelligence. I have here a diagram that shows
the layout of the joint.'</p>

<p>And with this, Chesty Charles outs with a sheet of paper and spreads it out
on the table, and begins explaining it to The Macarone with his finger.</p>

<p>'Now,' he says, 'this shows every door and window on the ground floor. Here
is a wing of the house. Here is Mr. Cleeburn T. Box's room on the ground floor
overlooking the bay. Here is a French window that is never locked,' he says.
'Here is his bed against the wall, not two steps from the window. Why,' Chesty
says, 'it is as simple as WPA.'</p>

<p>'Well,' The Macarone says, 'you are dead sure Mr. Box will not mind being
pushed? Because, after all, I do not have any reason to push him on my own
account, and I am doing my best at this time to lead a clean life and keep out
of unpleasant situations.'</p>

<p>'He will love it,' Chesty says.</p>

<p>So The Macarone finally says he will give the matter his earnest
consideration and will let Chesty Charles have his answer in a couple of days.
Then we all have some more Scotches, and it is now past closing-time, and The
Macarone and Willie take their departure, and I say to Chesty like this:</p>

<p>'Chesty,' I say, 'all this sounds to me like a very strange proposition, and
I do not believe anybody in this world is dumb enough to accept same.'</p>

<p>'Well,' Chesty says, 'I always hear The Macarone is the dumbest character in
the Middle West. Maybe he will wind up taking in the South too,' he says, and
then Chesty laughs and we have another Scotch by ourselves before we leave.</p>

<p>Now, the next afternoon I am over on South Beach, taking a little dip in the
ocean, and who do I run into engaged in the same pastime but The Macarone and
Willie. There are also numerous other parties along the beach, splashing about
in the water in their bathing-suits or stretched out on the sand, and The
Macarone speaks of Chesty Charles's proposition like this:</p>

<p>'It sounds all right,' The Macarone says. 'In fact,' he says, 'it sounds so
all right that the only thing that bothers me is I cannot figure out why Chesty
does not take it over one hundred per cent. But,' he says, 'I can see Chesty is
getting old, and maybe he loses his nerve. Well,' The Macarone says, 'that is
the way it always is with old folks. They lose their nerve.'</p>

<p>Then The Macarone starts swimming towards a float pretty well out in the
water, and what happens when he is about half-way to the float but he starts
flapping around in the water no little, and it is plain to be seen that he is
in some difficulty and seems about to drown. In fact, The Macarone issues loud
cries for help, but, personally, I do not see where it is any of my put-in to
help him, as he is just a chance acquaintance of mine and, furthermore, I
cannot swim.</p>

<p>Well, it seems that Willie cannot swim either, and he is saying it is too
bad that The Macarone has to go in such a fashion, and he is also saying he
better go and get The Macarone's clothes before someone else thinks of it. But
about this time a little Judy with about as much bathing-suit on as will make a
boxing glove for a mosquito jumps off the float and swims to The Macarone and
seizes him by one ear and holds his head above the water until a lifeguard with
hair on his chest gets out there and takes The Macarone off her hands.</p>

<p>Well, the lifeguard tows The Macarone ashore and rolls him over a barrel and
gets enough water out of him to float the <i>Queen Mary</i>, and by and by The
Macarone is as good as new, and he starts looking around for the little Judy
who holds him up in the water.</p>

<p>'She almost pulls my ear out by the roots,' The Macarone says. 'But,' he
says, 'I will forgive this torture because she saves my life. Who is she, and
where is she?'</p>

<p>Well, the lifeguard, who turns out to be a character by the name of Dorgan,
says she is Miss Mary Peering and that she works in the evening in a barbecue
stand over on Fifth Street, and what is more, she is a right nifty little
swimmer, but, of course, The Macarone already knows this. But now nothing will
do but we must go to the barbecue stand and find Miss Mary Peering, and there
she is in a blue linen uniform and with a Southern accent, dealing hot dogs and
hamburger sandwiches and one thing and another, to the customers.</p>

<p>She is a pretty little Judy who is maybe nineteen years of age, and when The
Macarone steps forward and thanks her for saving his life, she laughs and says
it is nothing whatever, and at first The Macarone figures that this crack is by
no means complimentary, and is disposed to chide her for same, especially when
he gets to thinking about his ear. But he can see that the little Judy has no
idea of getting out of line with him, and he becomes very friendly towards
her.</p>

<p>We sit there quite a while with The Macarone talking to her between
customers, and finally he asks her if she has a sweet-pea anywhere in the
background of her career, and at this she bursts into tears and almost drops an
order of pork and beans.</p>

<p>'Yes,' she says, 'I am in love with a wonderful young character by the name
of Lionel Box. He is a nephew of Mr. Cleeburn T. Box, and Mr. Cleeburn T. Box is
greatly opposed to our friendship. Lionel wishes to marry me, but,' she says,
'Mr. Cleeburn T. Box is his guardian and says he will not hear of Lionel
marrying beneath his station. Lionel will be very rich when he is of age, a
year from now, and then he can do as he pleases, but just at present his Uncle
Cleeburn keeps him from even seeing me. Oh,' she says, 'I am heartbroken.'</p>

<p>'Where is this Lionel now?' The Macarone says.</p>

<p>'That is just it,' Miss Mary Peering says. 'He is home, sick with the grippe
or some such, and his Uncle Cleeburn will not as much as let him answer the
telephone. His Uncle Cleeburn acts awful crazy, if you ask me. But,' she says,
'just wait until Lionel is of age and we can be married. Then we will go so far
away from his Uncle Cleeburn he can never catch up with us again.'</p>

<p>Well, at this news The Macarone seems to become very thoughtful, and at
first I think it is because he is disappointed to find Miss Mary Peering has a
sweet-pea in the background, but after a little more talk, he thanks her again
for saving his life and pats her hand and tells her not to worry about nothing,
not even about what she does to his ear.</p>

<p>Then we go to the Shark Fin Grill and find Chesty Charles sitting out in
front with his chair tilted up against the wall, and The Macarone says to him
like this:</p>

<p>'Chesty,' he says, 'have the dough on call for me from now on. I will take
care of this matter for Mr. Cleeburn T. Box. I study it over carefully,' The
Macarone says, 'and I can see how I will render Mr. Box a service and at the
same time do a new friend of mine a favour.</p>

<p>'In the meantime,' The Macarone says, 'you keep Willie here amused. It is a
one-handed job, and I do not care to use him on it in any manner, shape or
form. He is a nice character, but,' The Macarone says, 'he sometimes makes
wrong moves. He is too handy with that thing to suit me. By the way, Chesty,'
he says, 'what does Mr. Cleeburn T. Box look like?'</p>

<p>'Well,' Chesty says, 'he will be the only one you find in the room indicated
on the diagram, so his looks do not make any difference, but,' he says, 'he is
smooth-shaved and has thick black hair.'</p>

<p>Now, several nights pass away, and every night I drop into the Shark Fin
Grill to visit with Chesty Charles, but The Macarone does not show up but once,
and this is to personally view the five thousand dollars that Charles now has
in his safe, although Willie comes in now and then and sits around a while. But
Willie is a most restless character, and he does not seem to be able to hold
still more than a few minutes at a time, and he is always wandering around and
about the city.</p>

<p>Finally, along towards four bells one morning, when Chesty Charles is
getting ready to close the Shark Fin Grill, in walks The Macarone, and it is
plain to be seen that he has something on his mind.</p>

<p>A couple of customers are still in the joint and The Macarone waits until
they depart, and then he steps over to the bar, where Chesty Charles is
working, and gazes at Chesty for quite a spell without saying as much as aye,
yes, or no.</p>

<p>'Well?' Chesty says.</p>

<p>'Well, Chesty,' The Macarone says, 'I go to the home of your Mr. Cleeburn T.
Box a little while ago. It is a nice place. A little more shrubbery than we
like in Kansas City, but still a nice place. It must stand somebody maybe half
a million. I follow your diagram, Chesty,' he says. 'I find the wing marked X
and I make my way through plenty of cactus and Spanish bayonets, and I do not
know what all else, and enter the house by way of an open French window.</p>

<p>'I find myself in a room in which there are no lights, but,' The Macarone
says, 'as soon as my eyes become accustomed to the darkness, I can see that is
all just as the diagram shows. There is a bed within a few steps of the window
and there is a character asleep on the bed. He is snoring pretty good too. In
fact,' The Macarone says, 'he is snoring about as good as anybody I ever hear,
and I do not bar Willie, who is a wonderful snorer.'</p>

<p>'All right,' Chesty Charles says.</p>

<p>'Show me the dough again, Chesty,' The Macarone says.</p>

<p>So Chesty goes to his safe and opens it and outs with a nice package of the
soft and places it on the back bar where The Macarone can see it, and the sight
of the money seems to please The Macarone no little.</p>

<p>'All right,' Chesty says. 'Then what?'</p>

<p>'Well, Chesty,' The Macarone says, 'there I am with that thing in my hand,
and there is this character on the bed asleep, and there is no sound except his
snoring and the wind in some palm-trees outside. Chesty,' he says, 'are you
ever in a strange house at night with the wind working on the palm-trees
outside?'</p>

<p>'No,' Chesty says. 'I do not care for palm-trees.'</p>

<p>'It is a lonesome sound,' The Macarone says. 'Well,' he says, 'I step over
to the bed, and I can see by the outline of the character on the bed that he is
sleeping on his back, which is a good thing, as it saves me the trouble of
turning him over and maybe waking him up. You see, Chesty,' he says, 'I give
this matter some scientific study beforehand. I figure that the right idea in
this case is to push this character in such a manner that there can be no doubt
that he pushes himself, so it must be done from in front, and from close
up.</p>

<p>'Well,' The Macarone says, 'I wait right over this character on the bed
until my eyes make out the outline of his face in the dark, and I put that
thing down close to his nose, and just as I am about to give it to him, the
moon comes out from behind a cloud over the bay and spills plenty of light
through the open French window and over the character on the bed.</p>

<p>'And,' The Macarone says, 'I observe that this character on the bed is
holding some object clasped to his breast, and that he has a large smile on his
face, as if he is dreaming very pleasant dreams, indeed; and when I gently
remove the object from his fingers, thinking it may be something of value to
me, and hold it up to the light, what is it but a framed stand photograph of a
young friend of mine by the name of Miss Mary Peering.</p>

<p>'But,' The Macarone says, 'I hope and trust that no one will ever relate to
Miss Mary Peering the story of me finding this character asleep with her
picture, and snoring, because,' he says, 'snoring is without doubt a great
knock to romance.'</p>

<p>'So?' Chesty Charles says.</p>

<p>'So,' The Macarone says, 'I come away as quietly as possible without
disturbing the character on the bed, and here I am, Chesty, and there you are,
and it comes to my mind that somebody tries to drop me in on a great piece of
skullduggery.'</p>

<p>And all of a sudden, The Macarone outs with that thing and jams the nozzle
of it into Chesty Charles's chest, and says:</p>

<p>'Hand over that dough, Chesty,' he says. 'A nice thing you are trying to get
a respectable character like me into, because you know very well it cannot be
your Mr. Cleeburn T. Box on the bed in that room with Miss Mary Peering's
photograph clasped to his breast and smiling so. Chesty,' he says, 'I fear you
almost make a criminal of me, and for two cents I will give you a pushing for
your own self, right here and now.'</p>

<p>'Why, Mac,' Chesty says, 'you are a trifle hasty. If it is not Mr. Cleeburn
T. Box in that bed, I cannot think who it can be, but,' he says, 'maybe some
last-minute switch comes up in the occupant of the bed by accident. Maybe it is
something Mr. Cleeburn T. Box will easily explain when I see him again. Why,'
Chesty says, 'I cannot believe Mr. Cleeburn T. Box means any fraud in this
matter. He seems to me to be a nice, honest character, and very sincere in his
wish to be pushed.'</p>

<p>Then Chesty Charles goes on to state that if there is any fraud in this
matter, he is also a victim of same, and he says he will surely speak harshly
to Mr. Cleeburn T. Box about it the first time he gets a chance. In fact,
Chesty Charles becomes quite indignant when he gets to thinking that maybe Mr.
Cleeburn T. Box may be deceiving him and finally The Macarone says:</p>

<p>'Well, all right,' he says. 'Maybe you are not in on anything, at that, and,
in fact, I do not see what it is all about, anyway; but,' he says, 'it is my
opinion that your Mr. Cleeburn T. Box is without doubt nothing but a great
scalawag somewhere. Anyway, hand over the dough, Chesty,' he says. 'I am going
to collect on my good intentions.'</p>

<p>So Chesty Charles takes the package off the back bar and hands it over to
The Macarone, and as The Macarone is disposing of it in his pants' pocket,
Chesty says to him like this: 'But look, Mac,' he says, 'I am entitled to my
twenty-five per cent. for finding the plant, just the same.'</p>

<p>Well, The Macarone seems to be thinking this over, and, personally, I figure
there is much justice in what Chesty Charles says, and while The Macarone is
thinking, there is a noise at the door of somebody coming in, and The Macarone
hides that thing under his coat, though I notice he keeps his hand under there,
too, until it turns out that the party coming in is nobody but Willie.</p>

<p>'Well,' Willie says, 'I have quite an interesting experience just now while
I am taking a stroll away out on the Boulevard. It is right pretty out that
way, to be sure,' he says. 'I meet a cop and get to talking to him about this
and that, and while we are talking the cop says, "Good evening, Mr. Box," to a
character who goes walking past.</p>

<p>'The cop says this character is Mr. Cleeburn T. Box,' Willie says. 'I say
Mr. Box looks worried, and the cop says yes, his nephew is sick, and maybe he
is worrying about him. But,' Willie says, 'the cop says, "If I am Mr. Box, I
will not be worrying about such a thing, because if the nephew dies before he
comes of age, Mr. Box is the sole heir to his brother's estate of maybe ten
million dollars, and the nephew is not yet of age."</p>

<p>'"Well, cop," I say,' Willie says, '"are you sure this is Mr. Cleeburn T.
Box?" and the cop says yes, he knows him for over ten years, and that he meets
up with him every night on the Boulevard for the past week, just the same as
to-night, because it seems Mr. Cleeburn T. Box takes to strolling that way
quite some lately.</p>

<p>'So,' Willie says, 'I figure to save everybody a lot of bother, and I follow
Mr. Cleeburn T. Box away out the Boulevard after I leave the cop, and when I
get to a spot that seems nice and quiet and with nobody around, I step close
enough for powder marks to show good and give it to Mr. Cleeburn T. Box between
the eyes. Then,' Willie says, 'I leave that thing in his right hand, and if
they do not say it is a clear case of him pushing himself when they find him, I
will eat my hat.'</p>

<p>'Willie,' The Macarone says, 'is your Mr. Cleeburn T. Box clean-shaved and
does he have thick black hair?'</p>

<p>'Why, no,' Willie says. 'He has a big mouser on his upper lip and no hair
whatsoever on his head. In fact,' he says, 'he is as bald as a biscuit, and
maybe balder.'</p>

<p>Now, at this The Macarone turns to Chesty Charles, but by the time he is
half turned, Chesty is out the back door of the Shark Fin Grill and is taking
it on the Jesse Owens up the street, and The Macarone seems greatly surprised
and somewhat disappointed, and says to me like this:</p>

<p>'Well,' he says, 'Willie and me cannot wait for Chesty to return, but,' he
says, 'you can tell him for me that, under the circumstances, I am compelled to
reject his request for twenty-five per cent. for finding the plant. And,' The
Macarone says, 'if ever you hear of the nephew of the late Mr. Cleeburn T. Box
beefing about a missing photograph of Miss Mary Peering, you can tell him that
it is in good hands.'</p>

<h3><a name="All_Horse_Players_Die_Broke" id="All_Horse_Players_Die_Broke">All Horse Players Die Broke</a></h3>
<p>It is during the last race meeting at Saratoga, and one evening I am
standing out under the elms in front of the Grand Union Hotel thinking what a
beautiful world it is, to be sure, for what do I do in the afternoon at the
track but grab myself a piece of a 10-to-l shot.</p>

<p>I am thinking what a beautiful moon it is, indeed, that is shining down over
the park where Mr. Dick Canfield once deals them higher than a cat's back, and
how pure and balmy the air is, and also what nice-looking Judys are wandering
around and about, although it is only the night before that I am standing in
the same spot wondering where I can borrow a Betsy with which to shoot myself
smack-dab through the pimple.</p>

<p>In fact, I go around to see a character I know by the name of Solly
something, who owns a Betsy, but it seems he has only one cartridge to his name
for this Betsy and he is thinking some of either using the cartridge to shoot
his own self smack-dab through the pimple, or of going out to the race course
and shooting an old catfish by the name of Pair of Jacks that plays him false
in the fifth race, and therefore Solly is not in a mood to lend his Betsy to
anybody else.</p>

<p>So we try to figure out a way we can make one cartridge do for two pimples,
and in the meantime Solly outs with a bottle of applejack, and after a couple
of belts at this bottle we decide that the sensible thing to do is to take the
Betsy out and peddle it for whatever we can, and maybe get a taw for the next
day.</p>

<p>Well, it happens that we run into an Italian party from Passaic, N.J., by
the name of Giuseppe Palladino, who is called Joe for short, and this Joe is in
the money very good at the moment, and he is glad to lend us a pound note on
the Betsy, because Joe is such a character as never knows when he may need an
extra Betsy, and anyway it is the first time in his experience around the race
tracks that anybody ever offers him collateral for a loan.</p>

<p>So there Solly and I are with a deuce apiece after we spend the odd dollar
for breakfast the next day, and I run my deuce up to a total of twenty-two
slugs on the 10-to-l shot in the last heat of the day, and everything is
certainly all right with me in every respect.</p>

<p>Well, while I am standing there under the elms, who comes along but a
raggedy old Dutchman by the name of Unser Fritz, who is maybe seventy-five
years old, come next grass, and who is following the giddyaps since the battle
of Gettysburg, as near as anybody can figure out. In fact, Unser Fritz is quite
an institution around the race tracks, and is often written up by the newspaper
scribes as a terrible example of what a horse player comes to, although
personally I always say that what Unser Fritz comes to is not so tough when you
figure that he does not do a tap of work in all these years.</p>

<p>In his day, Unser Fritz is a most successful handicapper, a handicapper
being a character who can dope out from the form what horses ought to win the
races, and as long as his figures turn out all right, a handicapper is spoken
of most respectfully by one and all, although of course when he begins missing
out for any length of time as handicappers are bound to do, he is no longer
spoken of respectfully, or even as a handicapper. He is spoken of as a bum.</p>

<p>It is a strange thing how a handicapper can go along for years doing
everything right, and then all of a sudden he finds himself doing everything
wrong, and this is the way it is with Unser Fritz. For a long time his figures
on the horse races are considered most remarkable indeed, and as he will bet
till the cows come home on his own figures, he generally has plenty of money,
and a fiancée by the name of Emerald Em.</p>

<p>She is called Emerald Em because she has a habit of wearing a raft of
emeralds in rings, and pins, and bracelets, and one thing and another, which
are purchased for her by Unser Fritz to express his love, an emerald being a
green stone that is considered most expressive of love, if it is big enough. It
seems that Emerald Em is very fond of emeralds, especially when they are
surrounded by large, coarse diamonds.</p>

<p>I hear the old-timers around the race tracks say that when Emerald Em is
young, she is a tall, good-looking Judy with yellow hair that is by no means a
phony yellow, at that, and with a shape that does not require a bustle such as
most Judys always wear in those days.</p>

<p>But then nobody ever hears an old-timer mention any Judy that he remembers
from back down the years who is not good-looking, and in fact beautiful. To
hear the old-timers tell it, every pancake they ever see when they are young is
a double Myrna Loy, though the chances are, figuring in the law of averages,
that some of them are bound to be rutabagas, the same as now. Anyway, for years
this Emerald Em is known on every race track from coast to coast as Unser
Fritz's fiancée, and is considered quite a remarkable scene, what with her
emeralds, and not requiring any bustle, and everything else.</p>

<p>Then one day Unser Fritz's figures run plumb out on him, and so does his
dough, and so does Emerald Em, and now Unser Fritz is an old pappy guy, and it
is years since he is regarded as anything but a crumbo around the race tracks,
and nobody remembers much of his story, or cares a cuss about it, for if there
is anything that is a drug on the market around the tracks it is the story of a
broker.</p>

<p>How he gets from place to place, and how he lives after he gets there, is a
very great mystery to one and all, although I hear he often rides in the
horse-cars with the horses, when some owner or trainer happens to be feeling
tender-hearted, or he hitch-hikes in automobiles, and sometimes he even walks,
for Unser Fritz is still fairly nimble, no matter how old he is.</p>

<p>He always has under his arm a bundle of newspapers that somebody throws
away, and every night he sits down and handicaps the horses running the next
day according to his own system, but he seldom picks any winners, and even if
he does pick any winners, he seldom has anything to bet on them.</p>

<p>Sometimes he promotes a stranger, who does not know he is bad luck to a good
hunting dog, to put down a few dibs on one of his picks, and once in a while
the pick wins, and Unser Fritz gets a small stake, and sometimes an old-timer
who feels sorry for him will slip him something. But whatever Unser Fritz gets
hold of, he bets off right away on the next race that comes up, so naturally he
never is holding anything very long.</p>

<p>Well, Unser Fritz stands under the elms with me a while, speaking of this
and that, and especially of the races, and I am wondering to myself if I will
become as dishevelled as Unser Fritz if I keep on following the races, when he
gazes at the Grand Union Hotel, and says to me like this:</p>

<p>'It looks nice,' he says. 'It looks cheery-like, with the lights, and all
this and that. It brings back memories to me. Emma always lives in this hotel
whenever we make Saratoga for the races back in the days when I am in the
money. She always has a suite of two or three rooms on this side of the hotel.
Once she has four.</p>

<p>'I often stand here under these trees,' Unser Fritz says, 'watching her
windows to see what time she puts out her lights, because, while I trust Emma
implicitly, I know she has a restless nature, and sometimes she cannot resist
returning to scenes of gaiety after I bid her good night, especially,' he says,
'with a party by the name of Pete Shovelin, who runs the restaurant where she
once deals them off the arm.'</p>

<p>'You mean she is a biscuit shooter?' I say.</p>

<p>'A waitress,' Unser Fritz says. 'A good waitress. She comes of a family of
farm folks in this very section, although I never know much about them,' he
says. 'Shovelin's is a little hole-in-the-wall up the street here somewhere
which long since disappears. I go there for my morning java in the old
days.</p>

<p>'I will say one thing for Shovelin,' Unser Fritz says, 'he always has good
java. Three days after I first clap eyes on Emma, she is wearing her first
emerald, and is my fiancée. Then she moves into a suite in the Grand Union. I
only wish you can know Emma in those days,' he says. 'She is beautiful. She is
a fine character. She is always on the level, and I love her dearly.'</p>

<p>'What do you mean--always on the level?' I say. 'What about this Shovelin
party you just mention?'</p>

<p>'Ah,' Unser Fritz says, 'I suppose I am dull company for a squab, what with
having to stay in at night to work on my figures, and Emma likes to go around
and about. She is a highly nervous type, and extremely restless, and she cannot
bear to hold still very long at a time. But,' he says, 'in those days it is not
considered proper for a young Judy to go around and about without a chaperon,
so she goes with Shovelin for her chaperon. Emma never goes anywhere without a
chaperon,' he says.</p>

<p>Well, it seems that early in their courtship, Unser Fritz learns that he can
generally quiet her restlessness with emeralds, if they have diamonds on the
side. It seems that these stones have a very soothing effect on her, and this
is why he purchases them for her by the bucket.</p>

<p>'Yes,' Unser Fritz says, 'I always think of Emma whenever I am in New York
City, and look down Broadway at night with the go lights on.'</p>

<p>But it seems from what Unser Fritz tells me that even with the emeralds her
restless spells come on her very bad, and especially when he finds himself
running short of ready, and is unable to purchase more emeralds for her at the
moment, although Unser Fritz claims this is nothing unusual. In fact, he says
anybody with any experience with nervous female characters knows that it
becomes very monotonous for them to be around people who are short of ready.
'But,' he says, 'not all of them require soothing with emeralds. Some require
pearls,' he says.</p>

<p>Well, it seems that Emma generally takes a trip without Unser Fritz to break
the monotony of his running short of ready, but she never takes one of these
trips without a chaperon, because she is very careful about her good name, and
Unser Fritz's, too. It seems that in those days Judys have to be more careful
about such matters than they do now.</p>

<p>He remembers that once when they are in San Francisco she takes a trip
through the Yellowstone with Jockey Gus Kloobus as her chaperon, and is gone
three weeks and returns much refreshed, especially as she gets back just as
Unser Fritz makes a nice score and has a seidel of emeralds waiting for her. He
remembers another time she goes to England with a trainer by the name of Blootz
as her chaperon and comes home with an English accent that sounds right cute,
to find Unser Fritz going like a house afire at Belmont.</p>

<p>'She takes a lot of other trips without me during the time we are engaged,'
Unser Fritz says, 'but,' he says, 'I always know Emma will return to me as soon
as she hears I am back in the money and can purchase more emeralds for her. In
fact,' he says, 'this knowledge is all that keeps me struggling now.'</p>

<p>'Look, Fritz,' I say, 'what do you mean, keeps you going? Do you mean you
think Emma may return to you again?'</p>

<p>'Why, sure,' Unser Fritz says. 'Why, certainly, if I get my rushes again.
Why not?' he says. 'She knows there will be a pail of emeralds waiting for her.
She knows I love her and always will,' he says.</p>

<p>Well, I ask him when he sees Emerald Em last, and he says it is 1908 in the
old Waldorf-Astoria the night he blows a hundred and sixty thousand betting on
a hide called Sir Martin to win the Futurity, and it is all the dough Unser
Fritz has at the moment. In fact, he is cleaner than a jay bird, and he is
feeling somewhat discouraged.</p>

<p>It seems he is waiting on his floor for the elevator, and when it comes down
Emerald Em is one of the several passengers, and when the door opens, and Unser
Fritz starts to get in, she raises her foot and plants it in his stomach, and
gives him a big push back out the door and the elevator goes on down without
him.</p>

<p>'But, of course,' Unser Fritz says, 'Emma never likes to ride in the same
elevator with me, because I am not always tidy enough to suit her in those
days, what with having so much work to do on my figures, and she claims it is a
knock to her socially. Anyway,' he says, 'this is the last I see of Emma.'</p>

<p>'Why, Fritz,' I say, 'nineteen-eight is nearly thirty years back, and if she
ever thinks of returning to you, she will return long before this.'</p>

<p>'No,' Unser Fritz says. 'You see, I never make a scratch since then. I am
never since in the money, so there is no reason for Emma to return to me. But,'
he says, 'wait until I get going good again and you will see.'</p>

<p>Well, I always figure Unser Fritz must be more or less of an old screwball
for going on thinking there is still a chance for him around the tracks, and
now I am sure of it, and I am about to bid him good evening, when he mentions
that he can use about two dollars if I happen to have a deuce on me that is not
working, and I will say one thing for Unser Fritz, he seldom comes right out
and asks anybody for anything unless things are very desperate with him,
indeed.</p>

<p>'I need it to pay something on account of my landlady,' he says. 'I room
with old Mrs. Crob around the corner for over twenty years, and,' he says, 'she
only charges me a finnif a week, so I try to keep from getting too far to the
rear with her. I will return it to you the first score I make.'</p>

<p>Well, of course I know this means practically never, but I am feeling so
good about my success at the track that I slip him a deucer, and it is half an
hour later before I fully realize what I do, and go looking for Fritz to get
anyway half of it back. But by this time he disappears, and I think no more of
the matter until the next day out at the course when I hear Unser Fritz bets
two dollars on a thing by the name of Speed Cart, and it bows down at 50 to 1,
so I know Mrs. Crob is still waiting for hers.</p>

<p>Now there is Unser Fritz with one hundred slugs, and this is undoubtedly
more money than he enjoys since Hickory Slim is a two-year-old. And from here
on the story becomes very interesting, and in fact remarkable, because up to
the moment Speed Cart hits the wire, Unser Fritz is still nothing but a crumbo,
and you can say it again, while from now on he is somebody to point out and say
can you imagine such a thing happening?</p>

<p>He bets a hundred on a centipede called Marchesa, and down pops Marchesa
like a trained pig at 20 to 1. Then old Unser Fritz bets two hundred on a
caterpillar by the name of Merry Soul, at 4 to 1, and Merry Soul just laughs
his way home. Unser Fritz winds up the day betting two thousand more on
something called Sharp Practice, and when Sharp Practice wins by so far it
looks as if he is a shoo-in, Fritz finds himself with over twelve thousand
slugs, and the way the bookmakers in the betting ring are sobbing is really
most distressing to hear.</p>

<p>Well, in a week Unser Fritz is a hundred thousand dollars in front, because
the way he sends it in is quite astonishing to behold, although the old-timers
tell me it is just the way he sends it when he is younger. He is betting only
on horses that he personally figures out, and what happens is that Unser
Fritz's figures suddenly come to life again, and he cannot do anything
wrong.</p>

<p>He wins so much dough that he even pays off a few old touches, including my
two, and he goes so far as to lend Joe Palladino three dollars on the Betsy
that Solly and I hock with Joe for the pound note, as it seems that by this
time Joe himself is practically on his way to the poorhouse, and while Unser
Fritz has no use whatsoever for a Betsy he cannot bear to see a character such
as Joe go to the poorhouse.</p>

<p>But with all the dough Unser Fritz carries in his pockets, and plants in a
safe-deposit box in the jug downtown, he looks just the same as ever, because
he claims he cannot find time from working on his figures to buy new clothes
and dust himself off, and if you tell anybody who does not know who he is that
this old crutch is stone rich, the chances are they will call you a liar.</p>

<p>In fact, on a Monday around noon, the clerk in the branch office that a big
Fifth Avenue jewellery firm keeps in the lobby of the States Hotel is all ready
to yell for the constables when Unser Fritz leans up against the counter and
asks to see some jewellery on display in a showcase, as Unser Fritz is by no
means the clerk's idea of a customer for jewellery.</p>

<p>I am standing in the lobby of the hotel on the off chance that some fresh
money may arrive in the city on the late trains that I may be able to connect
up with before the races, when I notice Unser Fritz and observe the agitation
of the clerk, and presently I see Unser Fritz waving a fistful of bank notes
under the clerk's beak, and the clerk starts setting out the jewellery with
surprising speed.</p>

<p>I go over to see what is coming off, and I can see that the jewellery Unser
Fritz is looking at consists of a necklace of emeralds and diamonds, with a
centrepiece the size of the home plate, and some ear-drops, and bracelets, and
clips of same, and as I approach the scene I hear Unser Fritz ask how much for
the lot as if he is dickering for a basket of fish.</p>

<p>'One hundred and one thousand dollars, sir,' the clerk says. 'You see, sir,
it is a set, and one of the finest things of the kind in the country. We just
got it in from our New York store to show a party here, and,' he says, 'she is
absolutely crazy about it, but she states she cannot give us a final decision
until five o'clock this afternoon. Confidentially, sir,' the clerk says, 'I
think the real trouble is financial, and doubt that we will hear from her
again. In fact,' he says, 'I am so strongly of this opinion that I am prepared
to sell the goods without waiting on her. It is really a bargain at the price,'
he says.</p>

<p>'Dear me,' Unser Fritz says to me, 'this is most unfortunate as the sum
mentioned is just one thousand dollars more than I possess in all this world. I
have twenty thousand on my person, and eighty thousand over in the box in the
jug, and not another dime. But,' he says, 'I will be back before five o'clock
and take the lot. In fact,' he says, 'I will run in right after the third race
and pick it up.'</p>

<p>Well, at this the clerk starts putting the jewellery back in the case, and
anybody can see that he figures he is on a lob and that he is sorry he wastes
so much time, but Unser Fritz says to me like this:</p>

<p>'Emma is returning to me,' he says.</p>

<p>'Emma who?' I say.</p>

<p>'Why,' Unser Fritz says, 'my Emma. The one I tell you about not long ago.
She must hear I am in the money again, and she is returning just as I always
say she will.'</p>

<p>'How do you know?' I say. 'Do you hear from her, or what?'</p>

<p>'No,' Unser Fritz says, 'I do not hear from her direct, but Mrs. Crob knows
some female relative of Emma's that lives at Ballston Spa a few miles from
here, and this relative is in Saratoga this morning to do some shopping, and
she tells Mrs. Crob and Mrs. Crob tells me. Emma will be here to-night. I will
have these emeralds waiting for her.'</p>

<p>Well, what I always say is that every guy knows his own business best, and
if Unser Fritz wishes to toss his dough off on jewellery, it is none of my
put-in, so all I remark is that I have no doubt Emma will be very much
surprised indeed.</p>

<p>'No,' Unser Fritz says. 'She will be expecting them. She always expects
emeralds when she returns to me. I love her,' he says. 'You have no idea how I
love her. But let us hasten to the course,' he says. 'Cara Mia is a right good
thing in the third, and I will make just one bet to-day to win the thousand I
need to buy these emeralds.'</p>

<p>'But, Fritz,' I say, 'you will have nothing left for operating expenses
after you invest in the emeralds.'</p>

<p>'I am not worrying about operating expenses now,' Unser Fritz says. 'The way
my figures are standing up, I can run a spool of thread into a pair of pants in
no time. But I can scarcely wait to see the expression on Emma's face when she
sees her emeralds. I will have to make a fast trip into town after the third to
get my dough out of the box in the jug and pick them up,' he says. 'Who knows
but what this other party that is interested in the emeralds may make her mind
up before five o'clock and pop in there and nail them?'</p>

<p>Well, after we get to the race track, all Unser Fritz does is stand around
waiting for the third race. He has his figures on the first two races, and
ordinarily he will be betting himself a gob on them, but he says he does not
wish to take the slightest chance of cutting down his capital at this time, and
winding up short of enough dough to buy the emeralds.</p>

<p>It turns out that both of the horses Unser Fritz's figures make on top in
the first and second races bow down, and Unser Fritz will have his thousand if
he only bets a couple of hundred on either of them, but Unser Fritz says he is
not sorry he does not bet. He says the finishes in both races are very close,
and prove that there is an element of risk in these races. And Unser Fritz says
he cannot afford to tamper with the element of risk at this time.</p>

<p>He states that there is no element of risk whatever in the third race, and
what he states is very true, as everybody realizes that this mare Cara Mia is a
stick-out. In fact, she is such a stick-out that it scarcely figures to be a
contest. There are three other horses in the race, but it is the opinion of one
and all that if the owners of these horses have any sense they will leave them
in the barn and save them a lot of unnecessary lather.</p>

<p>The opening price offered by the bookmakers on Cara Mia is 2 to 5, which
means that if you wish to wager on Cara Mia to win you will have to put up five
dollars to a bookmaker's two dollars, and everybody agrees that this is a
reasonable thing to do in this case unless you wish to rob the poor bookmaker.
In fact, this is considered so reasonable that everybody starts running at the
bookmakers all at once, and the bookmakers can see if this keeps up they may
get knocked off their stools in the betting ring and maybe seriously injured,
so they make Cara Mia 1 to 6, and out, as quickly as possible to halt the rush
and give them a chance to breathe.</p>

<p>This 1 to 6 means that if you wish to wager on Cara Mia to win, you must
wager six of your own dollars to one of the bookmaker's dollars, and means that
the bookies are not offering any prices whatsoever on Cara Mia running second
or third. You can get almost any price you can think of right quick against any
of the other horses winning the race, and place and show prices, too, but
asking the bookmakers to lay against Cara Mia running second or third will be
something like asking them to bet that Mr. Roosevelt is not President of the
United States.</p>

<p>Well, I am expecting Unser Fritz to step in and partake of the 2 to 5 on
Cara Mia for all the dough he has on his person the moment it is offered,
because he is very high indeed on this mare, and in fact I never see anybody
any higher on any horse, and it is a price Unser Fritz will not back off from
when he is high on anything.</p>

<p>Moreover, I am pleased to think he will make such a wager, because it will
give him plenty over and above the price of the emeralds, and as long as he is
bound to purchase the emeralds, I wish to see him have a little surplus,
because when anybody has a surplus there is always a chance for me. It is when
everybody runs out of surpluses that I am handicapped no little. But instead of
stepping in and partaking, Unser Fritz keeps hesitating until the opening price
gets away from him, and finally he says to me like this:</p>

<p>'Of course,' he says, 'my figures show Cara Mia cannot possibly lose this
race, but,' he says, 'to guard against any possibility whatever of her losing,
I will make an absolute cinch of it. I will bet her third.'</p>

<p>'Why, Fritz,' I say, 'I do not think there is anybody in this world outside
of an insane asylum who will give you a price on the peek. Furthermore,' I say,
'I am greatly surprised at this sign of weakening on your part on your
figures.'</p>

<p>'Well,' Unser Fritz says, 'I cannot afford to take a chance on not having
the emeralds for Emma when she arrives. Let us go through the betting ring and
see what we can see,' he says.</p>

<p>So we walk through the betting ring, and by this time it seems that many of
the books are so loaded with wagers on Cara Mia to win that they will not
accept any more under the circumstances, and I figure that Unser Fritz blows
the biggest opportunity of his life in not grabbing the opening. The bookmakers
who are loaded are now looking even sadder than somewhat, and this makes them a
pitiful spectacle indeed.</p>

<p>Well, one of the saddest-looking is a character by the name of Slow McCool,
but he is a character who will usually give you a gamble and he is still taking
Cara Mia at 1 to 6, and Unser Fritz walks up to him and whispers in his ear,
and what he whispers is he wishes to know if Slow McCool cares to lay him a
price on Cara Mia third. But all that happens is that Slow McCool stops looking
sad a minute and looks slightly perplexed, and then he shakes his head and goes
on looking sad again.</p>

<p>Now Unser Fritz steps up to another sad-looking bookmaker by the name of
Pete Phozzler and whispers in his ear, and Pete also shakes his head, and after
we leave him I look back and see that Pete is standing up on his stool watching
Unser Fritz and still shaking his head.</p>

<p>Well, Unser Fritz approaches maybe a dozen other sad-looking bookmakers, and
whispers to them, and all he gets is the old head-shake, but none of them seem
to become angry with Unser Fritz, and I always say that this proves that
bookmakers are better than some people think, because, personally, I claim they
have a right to get angry with Unser Fritz for insulting their intelligence,
and trying to defraud them, too, by asking a price on Cara Mia third.</p>

<p>Finally we come to a character by the name of Willie the Worrier, who is
called by this name because he is always worrying about something, and what he
is generally worrying about is a short bank roll, or his ever-loving wife, and
sometimes both, though mostly it is his wife. Personally, I always figure she
is something to worry about, at that, though I do not consider details
necessary.</p>

<p>She is a red-headed Judy about half as old as Willie the Worrier, and this
alone is enough to start any guy worrying, and what is more she is easily
vexed, especially by Willie. In fact, I remember Solly telling me that she is
vexed with Willie no longer ago than about 11 a.m. this very day, and gives him
a public reprimanding about something or other in the telegraph office downtown
when Solly happens to be in there hoping maybe he will receive an answer from a
mark in Pittsfield, Mass., that he sends a tip on a horse.</p>

<p>Solly says the last he hears Willie the Worrier's wife say is that she will
leave him for good this time, but I just see her over on the clubhouse lawn
wearing some right classy-looking garments, so I judge she does not leave him
as yet, as the clubhouse lawn is not a place to be waiting for a train.</p>

<p>Well, when Unser Fritz sees that he is in front of Willie's stand, he starts
to move on, and I nudge him and motion at Willie, and ask him if he does not
notice that Willie is another bookmaker, and Unser Fritz says he notices him
all right, but that he does not care to offer him any business because Willie
insults him ten years ago. He says Willie calls him a dirty old Dutch bum, and
while I am thinking what a wonderful memory Unser Fritz has to remember insults
from bookmakers for ten years, Willie the Worrier, sitting on his stool looking
out over the crowd, spots Unser Fritz and yells at him as follows:</p>

<p>'Hello, Dirty Dutch,' he says. 'How is the soap market? What are you looking
for around here, Dirty Dutch? Santa Claus?'</p>

<p>Well, at this Unser Fritz pushes his way through the crowd around Willie the
Worrier's stand, and gets close to Willie, and says:</p>

<p>'Yes,' he says, 'I am looking for Santa Claus. I am looking for a show price
on number two horse, but,' he says, I do not expect to get it from the
shoemakers who are booking nowadays.'</p>

<p>Now the chances are Willie the Worrier figures Unser Fritz is just trying to
get sarcastic with him for the benefit of the crowd around his stand in asking
for such a thing as a price on Cara Mia third, and in fact the idea of anybody
asking a price third on a horse that some bookmakers will not accept any more
wagers on first, or even second, is so humorous that many characters laugh
right out loud.</p>

<p>'All right,' Willie the Worrier says. 'No one can ever say he comes to my
store looking for a marker on anything and is turned down. I will quote you a
show price, Dirty Dutch,' he says. 'You can have 1 to 100.'</p>

<p>This means that Willie the Worrier is asking Unser Fritz for one hundred
dollars to the book's one dollar if Unser Fritz wishes to bet on Cara Mia
dropping in there no worse than third, and of course Willie has no idea Unser
Fritz or anybody else will ever take such a price, and the chances are if
Willie is not sizzling a little at Unser Fritz, he will not offer such a price,
because it sounds foolish.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the chances are if Unser Fritz offers Willie a comparatively
small bet at this price, such as may enable him to chisel just a couple of
hundred out of Willie's book, Willie will find some excuse to wiggle off, but
Unser Fritz leans over and says in a low voice to Willie the Worrier:</p>

<p>'A hundred thousand.'</p>

<p>Willie nods his head and turns to a clerk alongside him, and his voice is as
low as Unser Fritz's as he says to the clerk: 'A thousand to a hundred
thousand, Cara Mia third.' The clerk's eyes pop open and so does his mouth, but
he does not say a word. He just writes something on a pad of paper in his hand,
and Unser Fritz offers Willie the Worrier a package of thousand-dollar bills,
and says: 'Here is twenty,' he says. 'The rest is in the jug.'</p>

<p>'All right, Dutch,' Willie says, 'I know you have it, although,' he says,
'this is the first crack you give me at it. You are on, Dutch,' he says.
'P.S.,' Willie says, 'the Dirty does not go any more.'</p>

<p>Well, you understand Unser Fritz is betting one hundred thousand dollars
against a thousand dollars that Cara Mia will run in the money, and personally
I consider this wager a very sound business proposition indeed, and so does
everybody else, for all it amounts to is finding a thousand dollars in the
street.</p>

<p>There is really nothing that can make Cara Mia run out of the money, the way
I look at it, except what happens to her, and what happens is she steps in a
hole fifty yards from the finish when she is on top by ten, and breezing, and
down she goes all spread out, and of course the other three horses run on past
her to the wire, and all this is quite a disaster to many members of the
public, including Unser Fritz.</p>

<p>I am standing with him on the rise of the grandstand lawn watching the race,
and it is plain to be seen that he is slightly surprised at what happens, and
personally, I am practically dumbfounded because, to tell the truth, I take a
nibble at the opening price of 2 to 5 on Cara Mia with a total of thirty slugs,
which represents all my capital, and I am thinking what a great injustice it is
for them to leave holes in the track for horses to step in, when Unser Fritz
says like this:</p>

<p>'Well,' he says, 'it is horse racing.'</p>

<p>And this is all he ever says about the matter, and then he walks down to
Willie the Worrier, and tells Willie if he will send a clerk with him, he will
go to the jug and get the balance of the money that is now due Willie.</p>

<p>'Dutch,' 'Willie says, 'it will be a pleasure to accompany you to the jug in
person.'</p>

<p>As Willie is getting down off his stool, somebody in the crowd who hears of
the wager gazes at Unser Fritz, and remarks that he is really a game guy, and
Willie says: 'Yes,' he says, 'he is a game guy at that. But,' he says, 'what
about me?'</p>

<p>And he takes Unser Fritz by the arm, and they walk away together, and
anybody can see that Unser Fritz picks up anyway twenty years or more, and a
slight stringhalt, in the last few minutes.</p>

<p>Then it comes on night again in Saratoga, and I am standing out under the
elms in front of the Grand Union, thinking that this world is by no means as
beautiful as formerly, when I notice a big, fat old Judy with snow-white hair
and spectacles standing near me, looking up and down the street. She will weigh
a good two hundred pounds, and much of it is around her ankles, but she has a
pleasant face, at that, and when she observes me looking at her, she comes over
to me, and says: 'I am trying to fix the location of a restaurant where I work
many years ago,' she says. 'It is a place called Shovelin's. The last thing my
husband tells me is to see if the old building is still here, but,' she says,
'it is so long since I am in Saratoga I cannot get my bearings.'</p>

<p>'Ma'am,' I say, 'is your name Emma by any chance and do they ever call you
Emerald Em?'</p>

<p>Well, at this the old Judy laughs, and says: 'Why, yes,' she says. 'That is
what they call me when I am young and foolish. But how do you know?' she says.
'I do not remember ever seeing you before in my life.'</p>

<p>'Well,' I say, 'I know a party who once knows you. A party by the name of
Unser Fritz.'</p>

<p>'Unser Fritz?' she says. 'Unser Fritz? Oh,' she says, 'I wonder if you mean
a crazy Dutchman I run around with many years ago? My gracious,' she says, 'I
just barely remember him. He is a great hand for giving me little presents such
as emeralds. When I am young I think emeralds are right pretty, but,' she says,
'otherwise I cannot stand them.'</p>

<p>'Then you do not come here to see him?' I say.</p>

<p>'Are you crazy, too?' she says. 'I am on my way to Ballston Spa to see my
grandchildren. I live in Macon, Georgia. If ever you are in Macon, Georgia,
drop in at Shovelin's restaurant and get some real Southern fried chicken. I am
Mrs. Joe Shovelin,' she says. 'By the way,' she says, 'I remember more about
that crazy Dutchman. He is a horse player. I always figure he must die long ago
and that the chances are he dies broke, too. I remember I hear people say all
horse players die broke.'</p>

<p>'Yes,' I say, 'he dies all right, and he dies as you suggest, too,' for it
is only an hour before that they find old Unser Fritz in a vacant lot over near
the railroad station with the Betsy he gets off Joe Palladino in his hand and a
bullet-hole smack-dab through his pimple.</p>

<p>Nobody blames him much for taking this out, and in fact I am standing there
thinking long after Emerald Em goes on about her business that it will be a
good idea if I follow his example, only I cannot think where I can find another
Betsy, when Solly comes along and stands there with me. I ask Solly if he knows
anything new.</p>

<p>'No,' Solly says, 'I do not know anything new, except,' he says, 'I heard
Willie the Worrier and his ever-loving make up again, and she is not going to
leave him after all. I hear Willie takes home a squarer in the shape of a batch
of emeralds and diamonds that she orders sent up here when Willie is not
looking, and that they are fighting about all day. Well,' Solly says, 'maybe
this is love.'</p>
