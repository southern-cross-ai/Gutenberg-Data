  <p class="first">THERE are few cultivated people who do not pretend to have
  read Mr. Lecky's "History of Rationalism in Europe." That very able work
  covers the whole of one very important side of modern development. But the
  picture of the real progress, the real mental and moral improvement of our
  species during the last few centuries, will not be complete until Mr. Lecky
  publishes a companion volume entitled "The History of Irrationalism in
  Europe." The two tendencies, acting together, have been responsible for the
  whole advancement of the Western world.</p>

  <p>Rationalism is, of course, that power which makes people invent sewing
  machines, understand Euclid, reform vestries, pull out teeth, and number the
  fixed stars. Irrationalism is that other force, if possible more essential,
  which makes men look at sunsets, laugh at jokes, go on crusades, write poems,
  enter monasteries, and jump over hay-cocks. Rationalism is the beneficent
  attempt to make our institutions and theories fit the world we live in, as
  clothes fit the wearer. Irrationalism is the beneficent reminder that, at the
  best, they do not fit. Irrationalism exists to point out that that eccentric
  old gentleman, "The World," is such a curiously shaped old gentleman that the
  most perfect coats and waistcoats have an extraordinary way of leaving parts
  of him out, sometimes whole legs and arms, the existence of which the tailor
  had not suspected.</p>

  <p>And as surely as there arises a consistent theory of life which seems to
  give a whole plan of it, there will appear within a score or two of years a
  great Irrationalist to tell the world of strange seas and forests which are
  nowhere down on the map. The great movement of the eighteenth and nineteenth
  centuries, which rose to its height in the French Revolution and the
  Positivist philosophy, was the last great Rationalistic synthesis. The
  inevitable Irrationalist who followed it was Thomas Carlyle. This is the
  first and most essential view of his position.</p>

  <p>In order to explain the matter more clearly, it is necessary to recur to
  our image of the old gentleman whom no tailor could fit. Not only do the
  tailors tend to think that clothes can be made to fit the old gentleman, but
  they tend very often to think that the whole question is a question of
  clothes. Thus, for instance, the Popes and Bolingbrokes of the earlier
  eighteenth century tried to make man a purer symbol of civilisation. They
  tried to pluck from him altogether his love of the savage and primeval, as
  they might have plucked off a shaggy wig from the old gentleman in order to
  put on a powdered one.</p>

  <p>A bystander of the name of Byron, who was indeed none other than the
  inevitable Irrationalist, startled them by pointing out that the shaggy
  object was not a wig at all, but the poor old gentleman's own hair; that, in
  other words, the love of the savage, the primeval, the lonely and unsociable,
  was a part of man, and it was their business to recognise it. Then arose the
  new fashion in cosmic clothes, which did recognise this natural element.
  Rousseau and Shelley took the old gentleman in hand, and provided him with
  spring-like garments, coloured like the clouds of morning. But one of their
  principles was the absolute principle of equality.</p>

  <p>Finding, therefore, that the old gentleman was wearing a curiously shaped
  hat, compounded of crown, coronet, and mitre, the great hat of Godhood,
  kinghood, and superiority, they proceeded, in order to make him more natural,
  to knock it off; and to them suddenly appeared the inevitable Irrationalist,
  a Scotch gentleman from Dumfriesshire, who, addressing them politely, said,
  "You believe that that regal object you are knocking off is his hat: believe
  me, gentlemen, it is his head. Such mistakes will occur after a hasty
  inspection, but that kingship is really a part of the old gentleman, and it
  is your business to recognise it."</p>

  <p>As Byron had come, just as the classic edifice of polite deism had been
  completed, to point out that the fact remained that he, Byron, did prefer
  walking by the seashore to taking tea in the garden, so Carlyle appeared,
  just as the austere temple of political equality was erected, to point out
  that the fact remained that he did think many people a great deal better than
  himself, and very many people a great deal worse. Thus, then, as the asserter
  of the natural character of kingship against the natural character of
  equality, it is that Thomas Carlyle primarily stands twenty-one years after
  his death.</p>

  <p>Now I do not think, as I shall show later, that Carlyle ever really
  understood the true doctrine of equality; but it is certainly at least
  equally true that the egalitarians and the ordinary opponents of Carlyle have
  never done the least justice to Carlyle's doctrine of hero-worship. The usual
  theory is that he believed in a race of arrogant strong men, brutally
  self-sufficient and brazenly indifferent to ethical limits, and that he
  wanted these men to frighten and dominate the populace as a keeper or a
  doctor frightens and dominates the lunatic in a cell. It is not too much to
  say that there is scarcely a trace in Carlyle's works of this barbarous and
  ridiculous idea. If there be a trace of it here and there, it is mere
  explosion of personal ill-temper, and has nothing whatever in common with
  Carlyle's deliberate theory of the hero.</p>

  <p>His theory of the hero was that he was a man whom men followed, not
  because they could not help fearing, but because they could not help loving
  him. His theory, right or wrong, was that when a man was your superior you
  were acting naturally in looking up to him, and were therefore happy; that
  you were acting unnaturally in equalising yourself with him, and were
  therefore unhappy. Most people, except those solemn persons who are called
  with some humour free-thinkers, would agree, for instance, that the worship
  of God was a human function, and therefore gave pleasure to the performer of
  it, like eating or taking exercise. Now Carlyle held, rightly or wrongly,
  that the worship of man, of the great man, was also a human function, and
  therefore gave pleasure to the performer of it. It all depends upon whether
  we do take an egalitarian or an aristocratic view of the spiritual world. If
  the spiritual world is based upon equality, then, no doubt, to keep a man in
  an inferior position must spiritually depress and degrade him; but if beings
  in the spiritual world have higher and lower functions, it is obvious that it
  is equally depressing and degrading to a man to take him out of his position
  and make him either a citizen or an emperor.</p>

         title="Thomas Carlyle (from a Photo)">
  </div><br>

  <p>Moreover, the real practical truth that underlay Carlyle's gospel of the
  hero has in other ways been misunderstood. The general idea is that Carlyle
  thought that, if a man were only able, every thing was to be excused to him.
  If Carlyle, even at any moment, thought this, it can only be said that for
  that moment Carlyle was a fool, as many able men may happen to be. But, as a
  matter of fact, what Carlyle meant was something much sounder. To say that
  any man may tyrannise so long as he is able, is as ridiculous as saying that
  any man may knock people down so long as he is six feet high. But in urging
  this very obvious fact the opponents of Carlyle too often forget a simpler
  truth at the back of the Carlyle gospel.</p>

  <p>It is that, while in one sense the same moral test is to be applied to all
  men, there does remain in ordinary charitable practice a very great
  difference between the people who consider it necessary to see some definite
  thing done before they die, and the people who cheerfully admit that two
  hundred years will scarcely bring what they require, and that meanwhile they
  desire to do nothing. A Tolstoian anarchist who thinks that men should be
  morally persuaded for the next two or three centuries to give up every kind
  of physical compulsion may, it is quite conceivable, be more right than the
  English Home Secretary who finds himself responsible for the suppression of a
  riot in Manchester; but surely it is patently ridiculous to say that it is
  just as much to the anarchist's credit that he avoids shooting Manchester
  workmen as it would be to the Home Secretary's credit if he avoided shooting
  them. It would be equally ridiculous to say that, if the Home Secretary
  conceived it necessary to shoot them, from a sense of responsibility, that
  his action, even if wrong, was really as wrong as the conduct of a Tolstoian
  who should shoot them without any reason at all. In this sense, therefore,
  there is really a different test, and a perfectly fair one, for men of action
  and for men of abstract theories and remote hopes.</p>

  <p>Now, it must definitely be set to the credit of men like Cromwell and
  Mirabeau, that they were undoubtedly opposed to and embarrassed by men whose
  projects, even in their own eyes, were scarcely a part of practical politics.
  These men exist in every country and in every age. They are wilfully and
  eternally in opposition. They do not agree sufficiently with the active
  powers even to argue with them with any profit. Their ideal is so far away
  that they do not even desire it with any immediate hunger. They count it a
  pleasant and natural thing to live and die in revolt. They are ready to be
  critics, they are ready to be martyrs, they are emphatically not ready to be
  rulers.</p>

  <p>In this way Cromwell, considering how he might make some English polity
  out of a chaos of English parties, had to argue for hours together with Fifth
  Monarchy men, to whom the vital question was whether the children of
  malignants should not be slain, and whether a man who was caught swearing
  should not be stoned to death. In this way Mirabeau, striving to keep the
  tradition of French civilisation intact amid a hundred essential reforms,
  found his way blocked by men who insisted on discussing whether in the ideal
  commonwealth men would believe in immortality, or go through a rite of
  marriage.</p>

  <p>Now, while fully granting that both types have an eternal value, it is
  certainly not just that precisely the same ethical test should be applied to
  Cromwell and the Fifth Monarchy men, to Mirabeau and the worshipper of pure
  reason. It is not just that we should judge in precisely the same way the
  pace of a butcher's cart which is obliged to get to Pimlico, and the pace of
  a butcher's cart which is designed at some time or other to reach the site of
  the Garden of Eden. It is not just that we should judge in the same way the
  man who is simply anxious to erect a parish pump, and the opponent of the
  pump, who looks forward to a day when there shall not only be no pump, but no
  parish. The man of action, then, really has in this sane and limited sense a
  claim to a peculiar kind of allowance, in that it is of vital necessity to
  him that a certain limited grievance should be removed. It is easy enough to
  be the man who lives in a contented impotence; the man who luxuriates in an
  endless and satisfied defeat. He does not desire to be effective; he only
  desires to be right. He does not desire passionately that something should be
  done; he only desires that it should be triumphantly proved to be
  necessary.</p>

  <p>This is the real contribution of Carlyle to the philosophy of the man of
  action. He revealed, entirely justly, and entirely to the profit of us all,
  the pathos of the practical man. He made us feel, what is profoundly true,
  that the tragedy of the death of Mary, Queen of Scots, is nothing to the
  tragedy of the death of Elizabeth; that the tragedy of the death of Charles
  I. is nothing to the tragedy of the death of Cromwell.</p>

  <p>A man like Charles I. died triumphantly; he did not indeed die as a
  martyr, but he died as something which is much more awful and
  exceptional&mdash;a consistent man. He was worse than a tyrant, he was a
  logician. But a man like Cromwell is in a much harder case, for he does not
  wish to die and be a spectacle, but to live and be a force. He has to break
  altogether with the splendid logic of martyrdom. He has to eat his own words
  for breakfast, dinner, and supper. He has to outlive a hundred incarnations,
  and always reject the last; his progress is like that unnerving initiation in
  the wild tale of Tom Moore's, in which the disciple had to climb up a stone
  stairway into the sky, every step of which fell away the moment his foot had
  left it.</p>

  <p>This is the only genuine truth that Carlyle brought from his study of
  strong men. If ever he said that we must blindly obey the strong man, he was
  merely angry and personal, and untrue to his essentially generous and humane
  spirit. When he said that we must reverence the strong man he sometimes
  expressed himself with a certain heated confusion, and left it doubtful
  whether he meant that we should reverence the strong man as we respect
  Christ, or merely as we respect Sandow. But we should all agree with him in
  his essential and eternal contribution&mdash;that we should pity the strong
  man more than an idiot or a cripple.</p>

  <p>It may be said that there is a certain inconsistency between these two
  justifications of Carlyle's hero-worship: that we cannot at the same time
  respect a man because he is above us in a definite spiritual order, and
  because he is in what is popularly called a hole; that we cannot at once
  reverence Mirabeau because he was strong and because he was weak. This kind
  of inconsistency does exist in Carlyle; it is, I may say with all reverence
  and with all certainty, the eternal and inevitable inconsistency which
  characterises those who receive divine revelations. The larger world, which
  our systems attempt to explain and chiefly succeed in hiding, must, when it
  breaks through upon us, take forms which appear to be conflicting. The
  spiritual world is so rich that it is varied; so varied that it is
  inconsistent. That is why so many saints and great doctors of religion have
  pinned their faith to paradoxes like the "Credo Quia Impossible," the great
  theological paradoxes which are so much more dazzling and daring than the
  paradoxes of the modern <i>flâneur</i>.</p>

  <p>The supreme glory of Carlyle was that he heard the veritable voices of the
  Cosmos. He left it to others to attune them into an orchestra. Sometimes the

  <p>It will be found relevant to what I have to say hereafter to remark at
  this point that I do not myself accept Carlyle's conception of the spiritual
  world as exhaustive. I believe in the essence of the old doctrine of
  equality, because it appears to me to result from all conceptions of the
  divinity of man. Of course there are inequalities, and obvious ones, but
  though they are not insignificant positively, they are insignificant
  comparatively.</p>

  <p>If men are all really the images of God, to talk about their differences
  has its significance, but only about the same significance which may be found
  in talking about the respective heights of twenty men, all of whom have
  received the Victoria Cross, or the respective length of the moustaches of
  twenty men, all of whom have died to save their fellow-creatures. In
  comparison with the point in which they are equal, the point in which they
  are unequal is not merely decidedly, but almost infinitely,
  insignificant.</p>

  </div><br>

  <p>But my reason for indicating my own opinion on the matter, at this point,
  is a definite one. Carlyle's view of equality does not happen to be mine; but
  it has an absolute right to be stated justly, and to be stated from Carlyle's
  point of view. It was not a brutal fear or a mean worship of force; it was a
  serious belief that some found blessedness in commanding, and some in
  obeying. Now this kind of intellectual justice was the one great quality
  which was lacking in Carlyle himself. He would not consent to listen to
  Rousseau's gospel, as I have suggested that we should listen to Carlyle's
  gospel. He would not put Rousseau's gospel from Rousseau's point of view. And
  consequently to the end of his days he never understood any gospel except
  Carlyle's gospel.</p>

  <p>When a literary man is known to have been almost a monster of industry,
  when he has produced a colossal epic like "Frederick the Great" on the
  dullest of all earthly subjects&mdash;Germany in the eighteenth
  century&mdash;when he has piled up all the complicated material of the
  history of the French Revolution, lost it, and by a portent of heroism piled
  it all up again; when he has achieved such masterpieces of research as the
  discovery of sense in Cromwell's speeches, and good qualities in Frederick of
  Prussia: when an author has done all this, it may seem a singular comment
  upon him to say that his main characteristic was a lack of patience. But this
  was in reality the chief weakness, in fact the only real weakness, of Carlyle
  as a moralist. It is very much easier to have what may be called moral
  patience or mental patience than to have something which may best be
  described as spiritual patience.</p>

  <p>Carlyle was patient with facts, dates, documents, intolerably wearisome
  memoirs; but he was not patient with the soul of man. He was not patient with
  ideas, theories, tendencies, outside his own philosophy. He never understood,
  and therefore persistently undervalued, the real meaning of the idea of
  liberty, which is a faith in the growth and life of the human mind; vague
  indeed in its nature, but transcending in its magnitude even our faith in our
  own faiths. He was something of a Tory, something of a Sans-culotte,
  something of a Puritan, something of an Imperialist, something of a
  Socialist; but he was never, even for a single moment, a Liberal. He did not
  believe as the Liberal believes, first indeed in his own truth, which in his
  eyes is pure truth, but beyond that also in that mightier truth which is made
  up of a million lies.</p>

  <p>And this spiritual impatience of Carlyle has left its peculiar mark in the
  only defect which can really be found in his historical works. Of the
  astonishing power and humour and poignancy of those historical works I think
  it scarcely necessary to speak. A man must have a very poor literary sense
  who can read one of Carlyle's slighter sketches, such as "The Diamond
  Necklace," and not feel that he has at the same time to deal with one of the
  greatest satirists, one of the greatest mystics, and incomparably one of the
  finest story-tellers in the world.</p>

  <p>No historian ever realised so strongly the recondite and ill-digested fact
  that history has consisted of human beings, each isolated, each vacillating,
  each living in an eternal present; or, in other words, that history has not
  consisted of crowds, or kings, or Acts of Parliament, or systems of
  government, or articles of belief. And Carlyle has, moreover, introduced into
  the philosophy of history one element which had been absent from it since the
  writing of the Old Testament&mdash;the element of something which can only be
  called humour in the just government of the universe.</p>

  <p>"He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh them to scorn, the Lord shall
  have them in derision," is a note that is struck again in Carlyle for the
  first time after two thousand years. It is the note of the sarcasm of
  Providence. Any one who will read those admirable chapters of Carlyle on
  Chartism will realise that, while all other humanitarians were insisting upon
  the cruelty or the inconsistency or the barbarism of neglecting the problem
  of labour, Carlyle is rather rilled with a kind of almost celestial
  astonishment at the absurdity of neglecting it.</p>

  <p>But a definite defect there is, as I have suggested, in Carlyle,
  considered as an historian, and it flows directly from that real moral defect
  in his nature, an impatience with other men's ideas. In judging of men as
  men, he was not only quick and graphic and correct, but in the main
  essentially genial and magnanimous. Only a very superficial critic will think
  that Carlyle was misanthropic because he was surly. There is very much more
  real sympathy with human problems and temptations in a page of this shaggy
  old malcontent than in whole libraries of constitutional history by dapper
  and polite rationalists, who treat men as automata, and put their virtues and
  vices into separate pigeonholes.</p>

  <p>If I had made a mistake or committed a sin that had any sort of human
  character about it, I would very much rather fall into the hands of Carlyle
  than into the hands of Mr. Hallam or Mr. James Mill. But while Carlyle did
  realise the fact that every man carries about with him his own life and
  atmosphere, he did not realise that other truth, that every man carries about
  with him his own theory of the world. Each one of us is living in a separate
  Cosmos. The theory of life held by one man never corresponds exactly to that
  held by another. The whole of a man's opinions, morals, tastes, manners,
  hobbies, work back eventually to some picture of existence itself which,
  whether it be a paradise or a battle-field, or a school or a chaos, is not
  precisely the same picture of existence which lies at the back of any other
  brain. Carlyle had not fully realised that it was a case of one man, one
  Cosmos. Consequently, he devoted himself to asking what place any man, say
  Robespierre or Shelley, occupied in Carlyle's Cosmos. It never occurred to
  him sufficiently clearly to ask what place Shelley occupied in Shelley's
  Cosmos, or Robespierre in Robespierre's Cosmos. Not feeling the need of this,
  he never studied, he never really listened to, Shelley's philosophy or
  Robespierre's philosophy. Here, after a somewhat long circuit, we have
  arrived at the one serious deficiency in Carlyle's histories, a neglect to
  realise the importance of theory and of alternative theories in human
  affairs.</p>

  <p>The standing example of this is the "History of the French Revolution."
  Carlyle's conception of the French Revolution is simply and absolutely that
  of an elemental outbreak, an explosion of nature in history, an earthquake in
  the moral world. Human nature, Carlyle seems to tell us, had been stifled
  more and more in the wrappings of artificiality, until, when its condition
  had just passed the tolerable, gagged, blinded, deaf, and ignorant of what it
  really wanted, by a gigantic muscular effort it burst its bonds.</p>

  <p>So far as it goes, that is perfectly true of the French Revolution; but
  only so far as it goes. The French Revolution was a sudden starting from
  slumber of that terrible spirit of man which sleeps through the greater
  number of the centuries; and Carlyle appreciates this, and describes it more
  powerfully and fearfully than any human historian, because this idea of the
  spirit of man breaking through formulae and building again on fundamentals
  was a part of his own philosophical theory, and therefore he understood it.
  But he never, as I have said, took any real trouble to understand other
  people's philosophical theories. And he did not realise the other fact about
  the French Revolution&mdash;the fact that it was not merely an elementary
  outbreak, but was also a great doctrinal movement.</p>

  <p>It is an astonishing thing that Carlyle's "French Revolution" contrives to
  be as admirable and as accurate a history as it is, while from one end to the
  other there is hardly a suggestion that he comprehended the moral and
  political theories which were the guiding stars of the French Revolutionists.
  It was not necessary that he should agree with them, but it was necessary
  that he should be interested in them; nay, in order that he should write a
  perfect history of their developments, it was necessary that he should admire
  them. The truly impartial historian is not he who is enthusiastic for neither
  side in a historic struggle: that method was adopted by the rationalistic
  historians of the Hallam type, and resulted in the dullest and thinnest and
  most essentially false chronicles that were ever compiled about mankind. The
  truly impartial historian is he who is enthusiastic for both sides. He holds
  in his heart a hundred fanaticisms. The truly philosophical historian does
  not patronise Cromwell and pat the King on the head, as Hallam does; the true
  philosophical historian could ride after Cromwell like an Ironside and adore
  the King like a Cavalier.</p>

  <p>The only history that is worth knowing, or worth striving to know, is the
  history of the human head and the human heart, and of what great loves it has
  been enamoured: truth in the sense of the absolute justice is a thing for
  which fools look in history and wise men in the Day of Judgment. It is the
  glory of Carlyle that he did realise that the intellectual impartiality of
  the rationalist historian was merely emotional ignorance. It was his only
  defect that he extended his sympathy, in cases like that of the French
  Revolution, only to headlong men and impetuous actions, and not to great
  schools of revolutionary doctrine and faith. He made somewhat the same
  mistake with regard to the Middle Ages, touching which his contributions are
  unequalled in picturesqueness and potency. He conceived the mediaeval period
  in Europe as a barbaric verity, "a rude, stalwart age"; he did not realise
  what is more and more unfolding itself to all serious historians, that the
  mediaeval period in Europe was a civilisation based upon a certain scheme of
  moral science of almost unexampled multiplicity and stringency, a scheme in
  which the colours of a lacquey's coat could be traced back to a system of
  astronomy, and the smallest bye-law for a village green had some relation to
  great ecclesiastical and moral mysteries. It is remarkable that we always
  call a rival civilisation savage: the Chinese call us barbarians, and we call
  them barbarians. The Middle Ages were a rival civilisation, based upon moral
  science, to ours based upon physical science. Most modern historians have
  abused this great civilisation for being barbarous: Carlyle had made one
  great stride beyond them in so far that he admired it for being barbarous.
  But his fatal strain of intellectual impatience prevented him from getting on
  to the right side of Catholic dogmas, just as it prevented him from getting
  on to the right side of Jacobin dogmas. He never really discovered what other
  people meant by Apostolic Succession, or Liberty, or Equality, or
  Fraternity.</p>

  <p>Probably his few mistakes arose from his unfortunate tendency to find
  "shams." Some have supposed this to be the essence and value of his message;
  it was in truth its worst pitfall and disaster. A man is almost always wrong
  when he sets about to prove the unreality and uselessness of anything: he is
  almost invariably right when he sets about to prove the reality and value of
  anything. I have a quite different and much more genuine right to say that
  bull's-eyes are nice than I have to say liquorice is nasty: I have found out
  the meaning of the first and not of the second. And if a man goes on a
  tearing hunt after shams, as Carlyle did, it is probable that he will find
  little or nothing real. He is tearing off the branches to find the tree.</p>

  <p>I have said all that is to be said against Carlyle's work almost
  designedly: for he is one of those who are so great that we rather need to
  blame them for the sake of our own independence than praise them for the sake
  of their fame. He came and spoke a word, and the chatter of rationalism
  stopped, and the sums would no longer work out and be ended. He was a breath
  of Nature turning in her sleep under the load of civilisation, a stir in the
  very stillness of God to tell us He was still there.</p>

     name="part2">BIOGRAPHICAL NOTES</a></h2>

  <p class="note"><a id="bn01"
     name="bn01"></a><b>Arch House, Ecclefechan/Carlyle's mother</b></p>

  <p class="note">In a house which his father, a mason, had built with his own
  hands, Thomas Carlyle was born on December 4th, 1795. His mother, Margaret
  Aitken, "a woman of the fairest descent, that of the pious, the just and
  wise," was the second wife of James Carlyle, and Thomas was the eldest of
  their nine children.</p>

  <p class="note"><a id="bn02"
     name="bn02"></a><b>The room in which Carlyle was born</b></p>

  <p class="note">The room at Arch House in which he was born now contains some
  interesting mementoes. On the mantelpiece are two turned wooden candlesticks,
  a gift of John Sterling, sent from Rome; the table provides a resting-place
  for his study-lamp and his tea-caddy. Most of the furniture came from Cheyne
  Row.</p>

  <p class="note"><a id="bn03"
     name="bn03"></a><b>Ecclefechan, Dumfriesshire</b></p>

  <p class="note">In the Entepfuhl of <i>Sartor Resartus</i> Carlyle has
  pictured his native village. It consisted of a single street, down the side
  of which ran an open brook. "With amazement," he writes, "I began to discover
  that Entepfuhl stood in the middle of a country, of a world... It was then
  that, independently of Schiller's <i>Wilhelm Tell</i>, I made this not quite
  insignificant reflection (so true also in spiritual things): Any road, this
  simple Entepfuhl road, will lead you to the end of the world!"</p>

  <p class="note"><a id="bn04"
     name="bn04"></a><b>Mainhill Farm</b></p>

  <p class="note">In 1815 the Carlyles moved to Mainhill Farm, and here he
  "first learned German, studied <i>Faust</i> in a dry ditch, and completed his
  translation of <i>Wilhelm Meister!</i>"</p>

  <p class="note"><a id="bn05"
     name="bn05"></a><b>Hoddam Hill</b></p>

  <p class="note">Ten years later Carlyle took possession of Hoddam Hill Farm,
  his mother going with him as housekeeper, and his brother Alick as practical
  farmer. Here they remained until 1826. "With all its manifold petty
  troubles," says Carlyle, in the <i>Reminiscences</i>, "this year at Hoddam
  Hill has a rustic beauty and dignity to me; and lies now like a not ignoble
  russet-coated idyll in my memory."</p>

  <p class="note"><a id="bn06"
     name="bn06"></a><b>Carlyle's first Edinburgh lodging in Simon
     Square</b></p>

  <p class="note">Carlyle came up from Ecclefechan to attend Edinburgh
  University when he was scarcely fourteen years of age, and with a companion,
  Tom Smail, journeyed the entire distance on foot. They secured a
  clean-looking and cheap lodging in Simon Square, a poor neighbourhood on the
  south side of Edinburgh, off Nicholson Street. After residing in various
  parts of the old town, Carlyle removed in 1821 to better quarters, and the
  most interesting of his various abodes in Edinburgh was at 1, Moray Street
  (now Spey Street), Leith Walk. Here he commenced his literary work in
  earnest, and began to regard life from a brighter standpoint.</p>

  <p class="note"><a id="bn07"
     name="bn07"></a><b>1, Moray Street (now Spey Street), Leith Walk,
     Edinburgh</b></p>

  <p class="note">Leith Walk is described in <i>Sartor Resartus</i> as the
  <i>Rue Saint-Thomas de l'Enfer</i>. "All at once," he writes, "there rose a
  thought in me, and I asked myself, 'What <i>art</i> thou afraid of?...' It is
  from this hour that I incline to date my spiritual new birth or baphometic
  fire-baptism; perhaps I directly thereupon began to be a man."</p>

  <p class="note"><a id="bn08"
     name="bn08"></a><b>Mrs. Carlyle's Birthplace, Haddington</b></p>

  <p class="note">Mrs. Carlyle, in her <i>Early Letters</i>, mentions her
  father's home at Haddington where she was born. "It is my native place still!
  and after all, there is much in it that I love. I love the bleaching green,
  where I used to caper, and roll, and tumble, and make gowan necklaces and
  chains of dandelion stalks, in the days of my '<i>wee existence</i>.'"</p>

  <p class="note"><a id="bn09"
     name="bn09"></a><b>The house in which Carlyle lived whilst teaching at
     Kirkcaldy school</b></p>

  <p class="note">It was at Kirkcaldy that Carlyle first met Edward Irving, the
  master of a rival school in the town. They became intimate friends. "But for
  Irving," he says, "I had never known what the communion of man with man
  means." It was here, too, that he made the acquaintance of Miss Margaret
  Gordon, the "Blumine" of <i>Sartor Resartus</i>. Carlyle describes the town
  in the <i>Reminiscences:</i> "Kirkcaldy itself...was a solidly diligent, yet
  by no means a panting, puffing, or in any way gambling 'Lang Toun.' I, in
  particular, always rather liked the people&mdash;though from the distance,
  chiefly; chagrined and discouraged by the sad trade one had!"</p>

  <p class="note"><a id="bn10"
     name="bn10"></a><b>Scotsbrig</b></p>

  <p class="note">The abrupt termination of Carlyle's tenancy of Hoddam Hill
  occurred simultaneously with the expiration of his father's lease of
  Mainhill, and in 1826 the family removed to Scotsbrig, that excellent "'shell
  of a house' for farming purposes," where Carlyle's parents spent the
  remainder of their lives. In this unpretentious home Carlyle passed many
  restful holidays among his own people.</p>

  <p class="note"><a id="bn11"
     name="bn11"></a><b>Templand, near Thornhill, Dumfriesshire</b></p>

  <p class="note">Carlyle's marriage with Jane Baillie Welsh took place on
  October 17th, 1826, at Templand, where Mrs. Welsh then resided. The ceremony
  was of the quietest description, his brother John Carlyle being the only
  person present besides Miss Welsh's family.</p>

  <p class="note"><a id="bn12"
     name="bn12"></a><b>21, Comely Bank Edinburgh</b></p>

  <p class="note">For eighteen months after their marriage the Carlyles lived
  at 21, Comely Bank, the "trim little cottage, far from all the uproar and
  putrescence (material and spiritual) of the reeky town, the sound of which we
  hear not, and only see over the knowe the reflection of its gaslights against
  the dusky sky." It was during this time that Carlyle contributed essays to
  the <i>Edinburgh and Foreign Quarterly Review</i>.</p>

  <p class="note"><a id="bn13"
     name="bn13"></a><b>Craigenputtock</b></p>

  <p class="note">In 1828 a removal was made to Mr. Welsh's manor at
  Craigenputtock, where in the solitude "almost druidical" <i>Sartor
  Resartus</i> was written. "Poor Puttock!" he exclaims in one of his letters,
  "Castle of many chagrins; peatbog castle, where the devil never slumbers nor
  sleeps! very touching art thou to me when I look on thy image here." In this
  lonely spot, cut off from all social intercourse, the Carlyles remained until
  1834, when, after "six years imprisonment on the Dumfriesshire moor," they
  moved to Chelsea and took up their residence at No. 5, Cheyne Row, in the
  house which was to be their home until death.</p>

  <p class="note"><a id="bn14"
     name="bn14"></a><b>Carlyle's house at 5 (now 24), Cheyne Row,
     Chelsea</b></p>

  <p class="note">After a week's wearisome house-hunting in London under the
  guidance of Leigh Hunt, Carlyle sent a long description of the proposed new
  residence to his wife, of which the following is an extract:&mdash;"We are
  called 'Cheyne Row' proper (pronounced Chainie Row) and are a 'genteel
  neighbourhood,' two old ladies on the one side, unknown character on the
  other, but with 'pianos' as Hunt said. The street is flag-pathed,
  sunk-storied, iron-railed, all old-fashioned and tightly done up...The house
  itself is eminent, antique, wainscoted to the very ceiling, and has been all
  new painted and repaired...On the whole a most massive, roomy, sufficient old
  house, with places, for example, to hang, say, three dozen hats or cloaks on,
  and as many crevices and queer old presses and shelved closets as would
  gratify the most covetous Goody&mdash;rent £35! I confess I am strongly
  tempted."</p>

  <p class="note"><a id="bn15"
     name="bn15"></a><b>Jane Welsh Carlyle</b></p>

  <p class="note">"In the ancient county-town of Haddington," he writes, "on
  July 14th, 1801, there was born to a lately wedded pair a little daughter,
  whom they named Jane Baillie Welsh, and whose subsequent and final name (her
  own common signature for many years) was Jane Welsh Carlyle...Oh, she was
  noble, very noble, in that early as in all other periods, and made the
  ugliest and dullest into something beautiful! I look back on it as if through
  rainbows&mdash;the bit of sunshine hers, the tears my own."</p>

  <p class="note"><a id="bn16"
     name="bn16"></a><b>Corner in drawing-room at 5, Cheyne Row</b></p>

  <p class="note">The brightest and happiest part of Carlyle's day was the
  early evening. "Home between five and six, with mud mackintoshes off, and the
  nightmares locked up for a while, I tried for an hour's sleep before my
  (solitary, dietetic, altogether simple) bit of dinner; but first always came
  up for half an hour to the drawing-room and her; where a bright, kindly fire
  was sure to be burning (candles hardly lit, all in trustful
  chiaroscuro)...This was the one bright portion of my black day. Oh, those
  evening half-hours, how beautiful and blessed they were!"</p>

  <p class="note"><a id="bn17"
     name="bn17"></a><b>The garden at 5, Cheyne Row</b></p>

  <p class="note">The garden at Cheyne Row was much appreciated by the
  Carlyles, who turned to the best advantage this "poor sooty patch." Mrs.
  Carlyle writes: "Behind we have a garden (so called in the language of
  flattery) in the worst of order, but boasting of two vines which produced two
  bunches of grapes in the season, which might be eaten, and a walnut tree,
  from which I gathered almost sixpence-worth of walnuts." Here stood the
  quaint china barrels she often referred to as "noblemen's seats," but Carlyle
  generally used one of the kitchen chairs by preference. He found the garden
  "of admirable comfort in the smoking way," and sometimes in summer would have
  his writing-table placed under an awning stretched for that purpose, and with
  a tray full of books at his side would work there when the heat drove him
  from his garret study.</p>

  <p class="note"><a id="bn18"
     name="bn18"></a><b>Carlyle's grave</b></p>

  <p class="note">The inscription on Carlyle's tombstone is very simple: the
  family crest (two wyverns), the family motto (<i>Humilitate</i>), and then
  these few words:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="note">"Here rests Thomas Carlyle, who was born at Ecclefechan, 4th
  December, 1795, and died at 24, Cheyne Row, Chelsea, London, on Saturday, 5th
  February, 1881.</p>

  <p class="note">"No monument," writes Froude, "is needed for one who has made
  an eternal memorial for himself in the hearts of all to whom truth is the
  dearest of possessions."</p>

  <p class="note"><a id="bn19"
     name="bn19"></a><b>Mrs. Carlyle's grave</b></p>

  <p class="note">When Carlyle was resting at Dumfries, after the exhaustion of
  his triumphant Inaugural Address upon his installation as Lord Rector of
  Edinburgh University, he received the announcement of his wife's sudden death
  whilst driving in her carriage in Hyde Park on April 21st, 1866. The effect
  of the calamity upon him was terrible. "There is no spirit in me to write,"
  he said, "though I try it sometimes."</p>

  <p class="note">Mrs. Carlyle was buried in Haddington Church. "I laid her in
  the grave of her father," writes Carlyle in the <i>Reminiscences</i>,
  "according to covenant of forty years back, and all was ended. In the nave of
  old Abbey Kirk, long a ruin, now being saved from further decay, with the
  skies looking down on her, there sleeps my little Jeannie, and the light of
  her face will never shine on me more."</p>

  <p class="note"><a id="bn20"
     name="bn20"></a><b>The ground-floor rooms at 5, Cheyne Row</b></p>

  <p class="note">It was into the ground-floor room&mdash;at that time spoken
  of as the "parlour"&mdash;that Edward Irving was ushered when he paid his one
  visit to Cheyne Row, in autumn 1834. "I recollect," writes Carlyle in the
  <i>Reminiscences</i>, "how he complimented her (as well he might) on the
  pretty little room she had made for her husband and self; and, running his
  eye over her dainty bits of arrangement, ornamentations (all so frugal,
  simple, full of grace, propriety, and ingenuity as they ever were), said,
  smiling: 'You are like an Eve, and make a little Paradise wherever you
  are.'"</p>

  <p class="note"><a id="bn21"
     name="bn21"></a><b>The garret study in 1857</b></p>

  <p class="note">The scheme looked promising on paper, but the result was
  "irremediably somewhat of a failure." Although the noises in the immediate
  neighbourhood were excluded, sounds in the distance, "evils that he knew not
  of" in the lower rooms, became painfully audible; nevertheless he occupied
  the room as his study until 1865, and here, "whirled aloft by angry
  elements," he completed what Dr. Garnett named well "His Thirteen Years War
  with Frederick."</p>

  <p class="note"><a id="bn22"
     name="bn22"></a><b>The sound-proof study at Cheyne Row</b></p>

  <p class="note">The construction of this sound-proof study was proposed as
  far back as 1843, but not until ten years later was the enterprise put into
  practical execution. On August 11th, 1853, Carlyle wrote to his sister: "At
  length, after deep deliberation, I have fairly decided to have a top story
  put upon the house, one big apartment, twenty feet square, with thin
  <i>doable</i> walls, light from the top, etc., and artfully ventilated, into
  which no sound can come; and all the cocks in nature may crow round it
  without my hearing a whisper of them!"</p>

  <p class="note"><a id="bn23"
     name="bn23"></a><b>The kitchen at 5, Cheyne Row</b></p>

  <p class="note">No description of Carlyle's Chelsea home would be complete
  without mention of the kitchen where Mrs. Carlyle made marmalade "pure as
  liquid amber, in taste and look almost poetically delicate"; and where, too,
  she stirred Leigh Hunt's endlessly admirable morsel of Scotch porridge.
  Readers of the <i>Letters and Memorials</i> will obtain many glimpses of this
  apartment and its occupants. The fittings were very old-fashioned, especially
  the open kitchen-range with its "kettle-crane" and "movable niggards." The
  dresser which stood there in 1834 remains against the south wall; the table
  still stands in the centre, and there is a sink in the corner beside the
  disconnected pump.</p>

  <p class="note"><a id="bn24"
     name="bn24"></a><b>Carlyle's writing-table and chair</b></p>

  <p class="note">His writing-table and arm-chair stood near the centre, and
  within easy reach was the little mahogany table for the books he happened to
  be using&mdash;or such of them as were not on the floor. Carlyle bequeathed
  his writing-table to Sir James Stephen. "I know," he wrote in his will, "he
  will accept it as a distinguished mark of my esteem. He knows that it
  belonged to my father-in-law and his daughter, and that I have written all my
  books upon it, except only <i>Schiller</i>, and that for fifty years and
  upwards that are now passed I have considered it among the most precious of
  my possessions."</p>

  <h2><a id="part3"
     name="part3">NOTE ON SOME PORTRAITS OF THOMAS CARLYLE</a></h2>

  <p class="note"><a id="pn01"
     name="pn01"></a><b>From a portrait by Daniel Maclise, R.A.</b></p>

  <p class="note">This portrait is now in the Victoria and Albert Museum.
  "Carlyle," writes David Hannay in the <i>Magazine of Art</i>, "already the
  author of <i>Sartor Resartus</i>, stands leaning against the traditional
  pillar with the conventional air of colourless good breeding. There is
  neither line in his face nor light in his eye."</p>

  <p class="note"><a id="pn02"
     name="pn02"></a><b>From a sketch by Count D'Orsay (1839)</b></p>

  <p class="note">"He (D'Orsay) has contrived," says the same writer, "to make
  Carlyle look like the hero of a lady's novel&mdash;an excellent young man
  with a curl in his upper lip and a well-combed head of hair."</p>

  <p class="note"><a id="pn03"
     name="pn03"></a><b>From the painting by J. McNeill Whistler</b></p>

  <p class="note">"Mr. Whistler, in the Glasgow Corporation Art Galleries, has
  distinctly succeeded in making the face of Carlyle interesting. He has
  avoided any thing like exaggeration. He has not tried to make capital out of
  the rugged mass of the hair, or to give a wild-man-of-the-woods look to the
  face by laying stress on its deep lines and stern contours. The head is
  noble, quiet, and sad. The artist has tried to paint a serious portrait
  rather than to give a view, and he has succeeded."&mdash;David Hannay in the
  <i>Magazine of Art</i>.</p>

  <p class="note"><a id="pn04"
     name="pn04"></a><b>From Sir J. E. Boehm's gold medallion</b></p>

  <p class="note">The medallion has been reproduced from a wood engraving by
  Pearson. It was presented to Carlyle in 1875 on his eightieth birthday, by
  friends and admirers in Edinburgh.</p>

  <p class="note"><a id="pn05"
     name="pn05"></a><b>From a drawing by E. J. Sullivan</b></p>

  <p class="note">"Professor Diogenes Teufelsdröckh, of Weissnichtwo, is
  nothing if he is not Carlyle in disguise, the projection of the Scotchman's
  individuality upon a half-humorous, half-philosophical German
  background."&mdash;Ernest Rhys: Introductory Note to <i>Sartor
  Resartus</i>.</p>

  <p class="note"><a id="pn06"
     name="pn06"></a><b>From the portrait painted by Sir J. E. Millais,
     P.R.A.</b></p>

  <p class="note">The picture by Millais, also in the National Portrait
  Gallery, was painted in 1877 for Mr. J. A. Froude. His opinion of it was as
  follows:&mdash;"And yet under Millais's hands the old Carlyle stood again
  upon the canvas as I had not seen him for thirty years. The inner secret of
  the features had been evidently caught. There was a likeness which no
  sculptor, no photographer, had yet equalled or approached. Afterwards, I knew
  not how, it seemed to fade away. Millais grew dissatisfied with his work,
  and, I believe, never completed it."</p>

  <p class="note"><a id="pn07"
     name="pn07"></a><b>From the painting by G. F. Watts, R.A., aet. 73</b></p>

  <p class="note">This portrait, executed for John Forster, who was very
  pleased with it, is now in the National Portrait Gallery. Carlyle himself
  describes it as "a delirious-looking mountebank, full of violence,
  awkwardness, atrocity, and stupidity, without recognisable likeness to
  anything I have ever known in any feature of me. <i>Fait in fatis</i>. What
  care I, after all? Forster is much content."</p>

  <p class="note"><a id="pn08"
     name="pn08"></a><b>From a statue by Sir J. E. Boehm, R.A.</b></p>

  <p class="note">In the gardens on the Chelsea Embankment stands a statue of
  Thomas Carlyle in bronze by the late Sir Edgar Boehm, which was placed there
  by subscription in 1882. Mr. Froude considered it "as satisfactory a likeness
  in face and figure as could be rendered in sculpture; and the warm regard
  which had grown up between the artist and Carlyle had enabled Boehm to catch
  with more than common success the shifting changes of his expression."</p>
