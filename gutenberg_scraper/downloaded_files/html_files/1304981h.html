  <h3>BIBLIOGRAPHIC NOTE</h3>

  <p class="note">Between 1904 and 1918 Edgar Wallace wrote a large number of
  mostly humorous sketches about life in the British Army relating the
  escapades and adventures of privates Smith (Smithy), Nobby Clark, Spud Murphy
  and their comrades-in-arms. A character called Smithy first appeared in
  articles which Wallace wrote for the <i>Daily Mail</i> as a war correspondent
  in South Africa during the Boer war. (See "Kitchener's The Bloke", "Christmas
  Day On The Veldt", "The Night Of The Drive", "Home Again", and "Back From The
  War&mdash;The Return of Smithy" in the collection <a href=
  "../NonFiction/ReportsFromTheBoerWar.html"><i>Reports From The Boer
  War</i></a>). The Smithy of these articles is presumably the prototype of the
  character in the later stories.</p>

  <p class="note">In his autobiography <i>People</i> Edgar Wallace describes
  the origin of of his first "Smithy" collection as follows: "What was in my
  mind... was to launch forth as a story-writer. I had written one or two short
  stories whilst I was in Cape Town, but they were not of any account. My best
  practice were my 'Smithy' articles in the <i>Daily Mail</i>, and the short
  history of the Russian Tsars (<i>Red Pages from Tsardom</i>, R.G.) which ran
  serially in the same paper. Collecting the 'Smithys', I sought for a
  publisher, but nobody seemed anxious to put his imprint upon my work, and in
  a moment of magnificent optimism I founded a little publishing business,
  which was called 'The Tallis Press.' It occupied one room in Temple Chambers,
  and from here I issued "Smithy" at 1 shilling and sold about 30,000 copies."
  &mdash; R.G.</p>

  <h2><a id="story1"
     name="story1"></a>I. &mdash; NOBBY'S BEST GIRL</h2>

  <h3>Published as "Smithy's Best Girl" in <i>The Story-Teller</i>, Cassells,
  July 1907</h3>

  <p class="first">SMITHY sat on the canteen table swinging his legs, and all
  that was best, brightest, and most noble in the First Battalion of the
  Anchester Regiment sat round listening.</p>

  <p>The glow of sunset lingered in the sky, but blue dusk sat on the eastern
  side of the barrack square; where, in the shade of the tall oaks&mdash;those
  oaks that had waved and rustled just as bravely when Clarendon of the 190th
  was preparing the regiment for the Peninsular Wars&mdash;the low-roofed
  married quarters twinkled with lights.</p>

  <p>A bugle call interrupted the narrative of the <i>raconteur</i>; a sharp,
  angry, slurred call that sent two of the company at a jog trot to the
  guard-room.</p>

  <p>But the interruption furnished at once a text and an illustration for
  Private Smith.</p>

  <p>He addressed the audience generally, but mainly his remarks were directed
  toward the only civilian present.</p>

  <p>"Bein' married is like bein' a defaulter," he explained, and was so struck
  with the sagacity of his reasoning chat he repeated it.</p>

  <p>"When a soldier breaks out of barracks, or talks in the ranks, or does
  those things within this Act mentioned," Smithy was quoting the Army Act,
  "along comes an officer and sez, 'Private What's-your-name, you will be
  confined to barracks for seven days' an' the poor young feller has to do
  extra drill an' extra fatigues, an' answers his name regular every 
half-hour.</p>

  <p>"It's very nice breakin' out of barracks," continued Smithy
  inconsequently, "an' so is courtin', but the end is the same. Up you come
  before some one or other, an' punishment is as sure as daylight. If a feller
  was to ask me which I'd prefer&mdash;to be married or to go to prison, I'd
  say 'prison' like a shot; because it's shorter an' not so crowded.'</p>

  <p>Here Smithy paused to ruminate.</p>

  <p>"You can never trust a woman," he continued bitterly. "A woman is like the
  bright green birds of paradise you buy in Petticoat Lane&mdash;all right till
  you've had 'em a day or two, and the natural-born sparrer begins to wear
  through. I'm not talkin' out of the back of my head, as you suggest, Tiny,
  but from my own blessed experience.</p>

  <p>"When the Anchesters went to Dabbington there wasn't a nicer, smarter, or
  more friendly company on the face of the earth than 'B' Company. Nice
  respectable fellers they were, more like brothers than comrades. It was 'Lend
  us a pipe of shag, ole boy,' an' 'Certainly, ole feller,' an' 'Do you mind my
  borrowin' your best boots to go an' meet my girl in?' an' 'Let me clean 'em
  for you, ole chap,' till all the rest of the regiment used to come an' look
  through the winders of our barrack room to see us bein' polite to each
  other.</p>

  <p>"It was the talk o' the battalion; they used to call us the Gentlemanly
  B's' till a chap from 'G' Company went an' spoilt it by callin' us the
  'Pretty Pollies'.</p>

  <p>"You don't know Dabbington, do you? It's a little garrison town with
  seventeen chapels, an' a market day. It wasn't exactly lively. Every year
  there was two select concerts an' a magic lantern lecture on 'My Visit to
  Rome' by the curate, but it wasn't exactly dull There was a sort of prejudice
  against soldiers in some quarters, an' in other quarters there was a feelin'
  that the soldier ought to be rescued from sin. A feller named Rogers, a young
  feller with spectacles, used to run a sort of Rescue Home, where the troops
  could be kept out of the nice, bright, sinful public-houses by bein' given a
  cup of coffee and last week's <i>Graphic</i> to read in a tin mission-hall.
  As a matter of fact, the public-houses in Dabbington wasn't so bright or
  lively, an' when young Mr. Rogers came round barracks an' began talkin' about
  the 'arty welcome, come-one, come-all, that was waitin' for us round the
  comer, Nobby Clark up an' sez 'We'll be round there to-night.'</p>

  <p>"Young Mr. Rogers was highly delighted, an' said if we got there by
  seven-thirty, we'd be in time for the bright little half-hour service that
  the proceedin's started with.</p>

  <p>"So me an' Nobby turns up soon after eight, an' there was Mr. Rogers
  waitin' to shake hands an' as pleased as Punch to see us, though a bit
  disappointed we hadn't come earlier.</p>

  <p>"'What have you let us in for?' I sez to Nobby as we walked in after Mr.
  Rogers.</p>

  <p>"'Close thy mouth,' sez Nobby, who always gets religious in a church. We
  was the only soldiers in the place, an' I felt a bit uncomfortable, but Nobby
  seemed to enjoy it. There was a lot of civilians present. Nice young ladies,
  an' young gentlemen in frock coats, an' they all got very friendly. One young
  gentleman with a very red face sez to Nobby: 'Brother, I extend the hand of
  friendship to you,' an' Nobby sez, 'Thank you, brother, the same to you.'</p>

  <p>"'I suppose,' sez the young gentleman, 'you don't often see bright faces
  round you?'</p>

  <p>"'Not so bright as yours,' sez Nobby, an' the young gentleman looked very
  'ard at him.</p>

  <p>"Then Mr. Rogers made a speech an' said he welcomed these two young
  military men, an' hoped they would be the advance guard&mdash;he believed
  that was the military term (applause) of the Army element in Dabbington
  (Applause).</p>

  <p>"So then we played games. There was one game that two of the nicest young
  ladies knew, an' they offered to teach me an' Nobby. I picked it up at once;
  it was a silly sort of game, played on a lop-sided draught-board, an' one
  piece hopped over another piece. But Nobby couldn't seem to learn it at all,
  an' the two young ladies sat on each side of him, guiding his hand for half
  an hour, and even then he was still makin' mistakes. By an' by, Mr. Rogers
  came up to us an' asked Nobby if he could sing. Nobby said he'd got a cold,
  but he'd do his best, an' everybody started clappin'. One of the nice young
  ladies went to the piano an' Nobby leant over and hummed the tune to her for
  about ten minutes. It seemed to me that he kept on hummin' different tunes,
  but I might have been mistaken.</p>

  <p>"I was a bit nervous, for old Nobby only knows three songs, 'Who Wouldn't
  be a Lodger?' 'All Through Going to Margate on a Sunday,' an' a sentimental
  song about a girl an' a soldier.</p>

  <p>"I tell you I was a bit relieved when be said he couldn't sing without his
  music, an' promised to come another night.</p>

  <p>"I asked Nobby how he'd enjoyed hisself as we was goin' home, an' he said
  First class, in an absent-minded way. I forgot to tell you that her name was
  Miss Elder&mdash;the girl who taught him to play 'Hoppit,' an' played the
  piano.</p>

  <p>"Next day me an' Nobby went out of barracks an' strolled round town. When
  we came to a music shop Nobby sez, 'Hold hard, Smithy, let's go in an' buy a
  bit of music.'</p>

  <p>"'What for?' I sez, amazed.</p>

  <p>"'To sing,' sez Nobby.</p>

  <p>"'Don't waste your money,' I sez, but Nobby went in, an' I followed. There
  was a young lady behind the counter; she wore spectacles, too, an' she sez in
  a voice about the size of an orange pip: 'What can I do for you?'</p>

  <p>"'I want a song,' sez Nobby. 'A good religious song with easy words, for
  about fourpence.'</p>

  <p>The young lady shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid we haven't got anything at that price,' she sez. 'Nothing
  under one an' fourpence.'</p>

  <p>"'Come away, Nobby,' sez I. ' Don't waste your money.' But Nobby wouldn't
  come.</p>

  <p>"'You ain't got anything that's a bit soiled or second hand, I suppose?'
  he sez, and the girl said she didn't think she had, but she'd look.</p>

  <p>"So she turned over a lot of music, an' every time she turned one over she
  said 'No' 'an 'I'm afraid not,' an' 'I'm sorry, but I don't think&mdash;' in
  her little voice <b>as</b> big as an orange pip.</p>

  <p>"By and by she stopped an' pulled out a sheet of music that was rather
  sunburnt about the edge.</p>

  <p>"'You can have this for fourpence, if it'll suit,' she sez.</p>

  <p>"'What's it called?' sez Nobby.</p>

  <p>"So she said some name that I couldn't catch.</p>

  <p>"'What's that?' sez Nobby, lookin' a bit disappointed.</p>

  <p>"'Ora pro nobis,' sez the young lady. It's Latin.'</p>

  <p>"Nobby shook his head. 'Give me one in English, please, miss. I haven't
  talked Latin for years.'</p>

  <p>"'But the song's in English,' said the girl. There are only three words in
  Latin.'</p>

  <p>"'How do you say 'em, miss?' asked Nobby, an' the young lady
  explained.</p>

  <p>"'Thanks, I'll take the song,' sez Nobby, brightenin' up; so he paid his
  fourpence an' we walked back to barracks.</p>

  <p>"We went over to the canteen an' found Fatty Morris, the chap that plays
  first cornet, an' asked his advice about learnin' the music, an' Fatty
  promised to run over it with Nobby the next day.</p>

  <p>"So, sure enough next afternoon we all went down into the back field, me
  an' Nobby, an' Fatty, an' started.</p>

  <p>"First of all Fatty run over the song by hisself, an Nobby practised the
  words a bit. By the time Fatty had got the song by heart an' had worked in
  two or three little trembly bits that wasn't in the music, all the chaps in
  barracks had strolled down to find out who was ill. Nobby pretended not to
  notice them, but they made him a bit nervous, an' when Fatty said he'd got
  the music all right, an' that Nobby could go ahead with the words, Nobby
  turned round to the crowd an' asked 'em what they wanted.</p>

  <p>"'We've come to hear the music,' said Spud Murphy, who was one of the
  fellers. 'What are <i>you</i> goin' to do?'</p>

  <p>"'I'm goin' to sing,' seZ Nobby, very short, an' Spud pretended to stagger
  back, an' all the other chaps got ready to run.</p>

  <p>"'Save the women an' children,' sez Spud, foldin' his arms. 'I'll be the
  last to leave the ship&mdash;to every man upon this earth death cometh soon
  or late, an' how can man die better than&mdash;'</p>

  <p>"'You close your face, Spud Murphy,' said Nobby, gettin' red. 'Nobody asked
  you to come here.'</p>

  <p>"But Spud took no notice of what Nobby said, an' continued to act the
  goat, an' there would have been a rough house, only at that minute Corporal
  Boyle happened to stroll up, an' asked Spud if he was the funny man on duty,
  an' told him to give the soft-sighing breezes a chance of making theirselves
  heard. So Spud took the hint an' dried up, an' Nobby, who was gettin' redder
  an' redder, started to practise.</p>

  <p>"Nobby's got a very nice, strong voice, but you could hear the cornet
  quite plain.</p>

  <p>"In a couple o' days he'd got the song off by heart, an' on the last day
  of the practice every chap in barracks went down into the playin' field to
  hear him.</p>

  <p>"Everybody was very curious to know where Nobby was going to sing, but we
  kept it dark.</p>

  <p>"Spud Murphy started a rumour that it was to be in the Albert
  Hall&mdash;but we kept it dark.</p>

  <p>"Then Spud Murphy an' a lot of other chaps&mdash;mostly of 'G'
  Company&mdash;'Dirty G,' we call 'em&mdash;said they'd foller us about till
  they found the place, an' for nearly a week me an' Nobby couldn't go out for
  a walk without twenty or thirty fellers walkin' behind in double rank.
  Wherever we went, they went. It got a bit monotonous, so I didn't blame Nobby
  when he slipped out of barracks once or twice without me an' went for a
  solitary ramble&mdash;so he said. Well, one night, off we went to the
  Soldiers' Rescue Home, an' the young ladies an' gentlemen were highly
  delighted to see us.</p>

  <p>"'I'm much obliged to you,' sez Mr. Rogers, for bringin' your gallant
  comrades with you,' pointing to Spud Murphy an' about twenty fellers who were
  standin' at the door, lookin' rather uncomfortable.</p>

  <p>"You see, they never suspected that Nobby was goin' to sing at a sort o'
  church, and they would probably have gone away, only young Mr. Rogers bagged
  'em before they had a chance.</p>

  <p>"So they all come in, walkin' on tip-toe an' speakin' in whispers; but one
  of the young ladies&mdash;not our one &mdash;went down an' talked to 'em an'
  showed 'em how to play Hoppit.'</p>

  <p>"Then Nobby's turn came to sing, an' Miss Elder went to the piano. As a
  matter of fact, I began to get nervous myself, especially as I saw Spud an'
  the other fellers sittin' up with a grin. Nobby's voice is good enough, but
  there's a lot of it, an' what with singin' against a cornet an' singin' in
  the open air, I expected him to lift the roof off.</p>

  <p>"But lo! an' behold! he sang as soft as soft can be, an' I could see that
  Spud an' the other fellers were disappointed. It was a song about a kid who
  died in the snow, an' it brought tears into your eyes to hear Nobby sing
  'Horror!' in a quavery voice.</p>

  <p>"After it was over everybody clapped, but I was lookin' at Spud.</p>

  <p>"'Did you see that?' whispers Spud, when Nobby did a bow. 'Did you see
  that?' he sez, when Nobby closed the young lady's music. 'Did you see that?'
  he sez fiercely, when Nobby handed the young lady down from the platform. I
  must confess I was a bit puzzled to know where Nobby got his manners from.
  But we soon found out. This Miss Elder come along to us by an' by, an' she
  asked Spud how he liked the song. Spud was a bit put out by her speakin' to
  him, an' grinned an' twisted his moustache, an' said in a haw-haw voice that
  it wasn't loud enough.</p>

  <p>"'Do you think so, Mr. Spud?' said the young lady, quite surprised. 'Why,
  I&mdash;'</p>

  <p>"'His name's Murphy,' interrupted Nobby, who was lookin' rather
  agitated.</p>

  <p>"'I'm sorry, Mr. Murphy; but do you really think so?' the young lady went
  on. 'Why, when he came&mdash;'</p>

  <p>"Nobby was very rude, for he interrupted the young lady again.</p>

  <p>"'Don't take any notice of what Spud&mdash;I mean Murphy&mdash;says,
  miss,' he said; but, somehow, Spud had got an idea, an' instead of takin'
  offence at what Nobby said, he went on talkin' to the young lady.</p>

  <p>"'Yes, miss?' he sez, politely. 'You was sayin' that when Mr. Clark
  came&mdash;'</p>

  <p>"And then it came out that Nobby had been goin' to Miss Elder's house to
  practise his songs in the evening.</p>

  <p>"'He's goin' to join the choir,' sez Miss Elder.</p>

  <p>"I looked at Nobby, very sad, for now I understood all about his 'solitary
  rambles.'</p>

  <p>"'Joined the choir, has he?' sez Spud. 'Well, miss, I should like to join
  the choir too'; an' all the other fellers said they'd like to join&mdash;all
  except little Billy Morgan, who was a bit afraid of Nobby, an' didn't like
  the way be was glarin' at him.</p>

  <p>"It's gospel truth," asserted Smith earnestly; "but before the end of the
  week half the bloomin' regiment applied to join the choir. You see, it came
  out that there was choir practice on Thursday and refreshments provided, and
  that all the nice young ladies in town were members. Fourteen men paraded at
  orderly room, and asked to be allowed to change their religion.</p>

  <p>"'What religion do you want?' sez the Colonel to young Jerry Jordan, an'
  Jerry said he didn't know exactly, but he thought it was the third chapel on
  the right as you went up the High Street.</p>

  <p>"'Next door to the little tobacco shop,' all the other fellers chimed
  in.</p>

  <p>"The Adjutant, who was standin' by, didn't say a word till the Colonel had
  gone, an then he sez, quiet&mdash;</p>

  <p>"'What's the little game?' and all the fellers said, one after another,
  'Nothing, sir.'</p>

  <p>"'What's the attraction?' sez the Adjutant. 'Free drinks?' An' all the
  fellers said, 'No, sir,' very indignant.</p>

  <p>"'What is your present religion?' sez the Adjutant to Jerry.</p>

  <p>"'Follow the band, sir,' sez Jerry, meanin' Church of England.</p>

  <p>"'And yours?'</p>

  <p>"' Methodist, sir,' sez Private Cohen, a young feller from
  Whitechapel.</p>

  <p>"'I'm goin' to find out all about it&mdash;fall out!' sez the Adjutant. He
  found out soon enough, for in a week the regiment was singin' mad. 'F'
  Company was the bass company, because they wasn't so well fed as the others,
  an' consequently their voices was rumbly. 'A' Company was the tenor company,
  because they were mostly fat duty men.* As soon as ever parade was over,
  chaps used to get together an' start practisin', an' once, some fellers from
  'H' got together under our windows at <i>reveille</i> an' sung, 'Awake,
  awake, put on your strength; put on your beautiful garments.' They got seven
  days C.B. for creatin' a disturbance in barracks.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* Duty men are soldiers with billets: officers'
  servants, etc.]</p>

  <p>"All this time Nobby was gettin' thicker an' thicker with Miss Elder. She
  introduced him to her father an' mother an' family, an' Nobby used to go
  there to tea on Sundays, an' carry the books home after the service. An'
  Nobby stopped goin' to the canteen, an' sounded his aitches, an' bought a
  nail-brush. An' when they had choir practice at Miss Elder's house, Nobby
  would stay behind to help wash up the cups with Miss Elder. Me an' Spud
  Murphy volunteered to stay behind once, but Nobby wouldn't hear of it. He
  asked me as a great favour not to queer his pitch, an' he told Spud in
  private that if he ever volunteered again, there'd be trouble.</p>

  <p>"'I'm now a good Christian, leadin' the better life,' sez Nobby; 'but if I
  ever hear you talkin' about stayin' behind to wash up the cups, I'll knock
  bits off you, you putty-eyed blitherer.'</p>

  <p>"So Spud was persuaded to stay away.</p>

  <p>"The choir was a big success, although the young fellers at the chapel who
  resigned sooner than sit next to red-coats got very nasty, an' used to laugh
  when Nobby sang a solo (by request). I spoke to one of 'em about it, one
  night after chapel.</p>

  <p>"'You look after your singin', my good man,' he sez, very haughty. It was
  the red-faced young gentleman who welcomed us to the Soldiers' Rescue Home,
  an' he'd been very cool to me an' Nobby. We was walkin' along a quiet street
  when I up an' spoke to him.</p>

  <p>"'Look here!' he sez, very hot. 'Me an' several other young gentlemen have
  gone to a lot of trouble to rescue you fellers from sin, an' now you ain't
  satisfied with bein' rescued, but you must go an' monopolize our young lady
  friends, an' cold shoulder us out of the choir!' I didn't say anything for a
  while. 'Blessed feather-bed soldiers, I call you,' he said bitterly. 'Blessed
  namby-pamby soldiers. I call you!'</p>

  <p>"'Me?' I sez.</p>

  <p>"'Yes,' he sez, reckless. 'You, if you like.'</p>

  <p>"I didn't like to hit him, because I was afraid he'd cry; but I proved
  that I was no Christian, an' he told me I ought to be ashamed to use such
  language on a Sunday night.</p>

  <p>"Mind you," said Smithy impartially, "I'm not one to run down a soldier
  because he's a Christian. All these stories you hear about Christians havin'
  boots thrown at 'em because they say their prayers in the barrack-room is
  rot. It makes you uncomfortable to see a feller sayin' his prayers in public,
  an' it makes you feel uncomfortable to hear a feller blaspheme; but it's the
  same kind of uncomfortableness.</p>

  <p>"I chucked up the choir myself, because they found out that I couldn't
  sing&mdash;only eat an' drink at the choir practice, an', to tell you the
  truth, I was a bit sore with Nobby. So what with hints from Miss Elder about
  my voice, an' hints from Nobby about my appetite, I gave up goin'. But one
  day along comes Nobby, seemin' very excited.</p>

  <p>"'Come to choir practice to-night, Smithy,' he sez.</p>

  <p>"'Thanks,' I sez, rather cold; 'but I've had my tea.'</p>

  <p>"'Come along,' sez Nobby; 'there's goin' to be no end of a do
  to-night.'</p>

  <p>"'Thank you, Private Clark,' I sez haughtily; 'but I haven't forgotten
  your remarks about the currant cake.'</p>

  <p>"Anyway, he persuaded me. It seemed that Mrs. Elder was goin' to make some
  grand announcement to the choir, an' was givin' a sort o' stand-up supper to
  celebrate it, so I went along.</p>

  <p>"Nobby was a bit excited an' a bit mysterious, but I didn't take much
  notice, an' then he started askin' if he told me something whether I'd keep
  it dark. So I said 'Yes.' So he said, 'Will you take your dying oath?' I said
  'Yes.' So after he told me I was the greatest friend that he had, an' that
  he'd break my jaw if I ever breathed a syllable, he let out that he was in
  love. Laugh! I thought I'd break a blood vessel. Nobby got very fierce, an'
  after sayin' a lot of unnecessary things, he asked me if I thought I was a
  gentleman, so I said 'No.'</p>

  <p>"He'd fallen in love with Miss Elder, an' was goin' to speak to her that
  night. This sobered me down a bit. 'She's much too good for you, Nobby,' I
  sez; 'she plays the piano, for one thing.'</p>

  <p>"It was a mad sort of idea, but Nobby seemed struck with it. He hadn't
  said a word to her about it, but he was goin' to take advantage of the
  party.</p>

  <p>"I must say that Mrs. Elder did the thing in style. Cake and thin bread
  an' butter, and jam. Mr. Elder belongs to the Chapel an' takes the plate
  round an' keeps a provision shop in the High Street. He was waitin' for us,
  smilin' and shakin' hands as friendly as possible. Mr. Rogers was there too,
  but he looked nervous.</p>

  <p>"After we'd had a hymn or so, and finished off the grub, Mr. Elder said
  he'd got a few words to say to his dear young friends. He said there was a
  time for eatin' an' a time for sleepin', a time for buryin' an' a time for
  givin' in marriage. Nobby said, 'Hear, hear,' before he could stop hisself,
  an' then looked out of the window, pretendin' it wasn't him.</p>

  <p>"'I have to announce the engagement of my dear daughter'&mdash;Nobby sat
  up straight, with his mouth open&mdash;'with our dear young friend and
  fellow-worker, Mr. Anthony Rogers.'</p>

  <p>"I didn't look at Nobby till we got outside.</p>

  <p>"We walked along for about a mile before he said a word.</p>

  <p>"'That's a woman!' he sez bitterly. 'After what I've done, too! Sat in a
  bloomin' choir, an' all the time I never once missed sayin' "Amen"'</p>

  <p>"He didn't say anything more for a long time, but he seemed to be thinking
  a lot, and whenever I looked at him he managed to turn his head away. I
  didn't like to press him, but presently he sez in a queer kind of
  voice&mdash;</p>

  <p>"'Washed the bloomin' cups, cut the cake, made the fire burn up, carried
  her books, an' sang anthems,' he sez after a bit.</p>

  <p>"We went into barracks together, an' turned down the road that leads to
  the canteen."</p>

  <h2><a id="story2"
     name="story2"></a>II. &mdash; AUTHORSHIP</h2>

  <h3>Published as "Smithy on Authorship" in <i>Ideas</i>, Hulton &amp; Co.,
  London, Dec 5, 1907</h3>

  <p class="first">"EVERY man," said Smithy philosophically, "is really three
  men: There's the man as he is; an' the man as he thinks he is; an' the 'man
  as he wants <i>you</i> to think he is. We had a feller in our battalion by
  the name of Moss who was one of those chaps who are always making theirselves
  out to be worse than they are. He was most celebrated for what he was going
  to say to the Colonel, whenever he got half a chance.</p>

  <p>"'I'll say,' he sez, fierce as anything, 'I'll say, look here&mdash;'</p>

  <p>"'That'll settle <i>him</i>,' sez Nobby; 'he's only got to look at you,
  Mossy, to wish he never did. If I was a doctor,' Nobby went on thoughtfully,
  'you're the chap I'd employ to stand outside the shop to make people
  ill.'</p>

  <p>"Mossy wasn't a very good lookin' chap, owin' to his beak. Nobby sez that
  when he was a baby, he must have been carried upside down, an' all the blood
  rushed to his nose. But what Moss was goin' to tell the Colonel got to be a
  by-word in the battalion. He was going to give the Colonel the biggest
  talking to <i>he</i> ever had.</p>

  <p>"One day when we was all down in the back field watchin' the ridiculous
  attempts of 'H' Company to take 'B' Company's number down at football, the
  Colonel came along with two or three other officers to see the disgustin'
  exhibition.</p>

  <p>"We didn't want to see him just then, because it spoilt what I might call
  the flow of good fellership.</p>

  <p>"Nobby was playin' centre forward for 'B,' an' we was encouragin' him with
  a few remarks like, 'Go it, Nobby&mdash;slosh him, Nobby&mdash;tread on him,'
  an' shoutin' 'foul' when the other feller hit back. It's a fine old English
  game, is Company football in the Anchesters&mdash;catch-as-catch-can. The
  Colonel came just before half-time, an' whilst the interval was on, an'
  whilst 'H' was bindin' up their wounds an' the captain of 'H' team was givin'
  his fellers instructions how they was to trip Nobby up an' accidentally tread
  on his neck, the Colonel strolled round the field, talkin' to some of the
  men. He spotted Moss and came over to him.</p>

  <p>"'Ha, Moss,' he sez, in that sarcastic manner of his, 'have you been
  getting into trouble lately?'</p>

  <p>"We all stood still with our hearts in our mouths waitin' to hear Mossy
  dress the Colonel down.</p>

  <p>"'No, sir,' sez Moss, as humble as can be.</p>

  <p>"'Good,' sez the Colonel; 'keeping away from the drink, eh?'</p>

  <p>"'Oh, yes, sir,' sez Moss quite eager, 'oh, yes, sir; thank you kindly,
  sir. I'm a teetotaller, sir.'</p>

  <p>"'Um,' sez the colonel, looking doubtful, 'any complaints to make?'</p>

  <p>"'Oh, no, sir,' sez Moss, wrigglin' at the very idea; 'I shouldn't think
  of such a thing; nothin' further from my thoughts, sir.'</p>

  <p>"I tell you, we was all struck of a heap to hear him.</p>

  <p>"'Excellent,' sez the Colonel, who's a fatherly old chap, except in
  action. 'I suppose you thought I treated you harshly when I fined you the
  other day?'</p>

  <p>"'Oh, no, sir,' sez Moss, 'you did quite right, sir; I'm quite ashamed of
  myself, sir.'</p>

  <p>"When the officers had strolled away, I looks at him.</p>

  <p>"'Moss,' I sez sadly, 'you're a fine bloomin' Ajax, I <i>don't</i>
  think.'</p>

  <p>"There's lots of fellers in the world like Moss&mdash;what Harry Boyd, the
  horse-racin' chap, calls 'future eventers.' They walk about dreamin' of what
  they'd have said if they'd thought of it, an' what they'd say if so-an'-so
  happened. But so-an'-so never does happen, that's the worst of it.</p>

  <p>"Old Mossy was sayin' the other night&mdash;</p>

  <p>"'If I ever come into a million of money, do you know what I'd do?'</p>

  <p>"'Buy a new face,' sez Nobby, who's got what I might call a practical
  mind.</p>

  <p>"'Takin' no notice of interruptions, that only shows the ignorance of your
  bringin' up,' sez Moss, 'I'll go on. If I had a million or so of
  money&mdash;come into it sudden, owing to an uncle that's gone to America
  dyin' an' leavin' it to me&mdash;'</p>

  <p>"'Owin' to his bein' off his bloomin' napper,' sez Nobby.</p>

  <p>"'I'd buy my discharge from the army,' sez Moss, takin' no notice of
  Nobby. 'I'd give every feller in barracks a hundred pounds; then I'd have me
  motor-car come an' fetch me; then I'd go up to the Colonel an' I'd
  say&mdash;'</p>

  <p>"'Yes, sir, please, sir; no, sir, please, sir,' sez Nobby very
  rapidly.</p>

  <p>"'I'd say "Look here, old feller,"' sez Moss, ' " you think you're a bit
  of a lad, I've no doubt, but let me tell you&mdash;'' '</p>

  <p>"'It'd be worth the money,' sez Nobby promptly, 'run along an' find your
  Uncle Moss, search him for the millions; then show him your face an' frighten
  him to death.'</p>

  <p>"There was a chap of ours named Boyle; well connected he was. He had a
  grocer's shop on his father's side an' a steam laundry on his mother's side,
  and from what Boyle said one of his cousins ran a tippin' business in
  Birmingham, patronized by the nobility an' gentry. Fellers who owned horses
  used to write to him to see if their horse had a chance, an' if Boyle's
  cousin said 'No,' why they scratched the horse. What makes me think of Boyle
  in talkin' about Mossy, they were both dreamers in a manner of speakin', the
  only difference was that Mossy used to dream about what he was goin' to do,
  and Boyle of what he <i>had</i> done. Lots of fellers called Boyle a liar,
  but Nobby sez you've got to make allowances, an' what Boyle was, was an
  author. Nobby sez that as soon as a feller believes his own lies, an' when he
  finds how easy one lie leads to another, he's an author, an' there's a lot in
  it.</p>

  <p>"One night last winter, me an' Nobby and a lot of other chaps, was at the
  regimental coffee shop. Havin' no money, we could not go to the canteen.</p>

  <p>"'Let's go down to the coffee shop,' sez Nobby, very disgusted; 'I've a
  good mind to give up the cussed drink altogether. It makes a man worse than
  the beast of the field,' he sez, so we all went down to the temperance place.
  The coffee shop ain't such a bad sort of show. There's a bagatelle board an'
  newspapers, an' you can always 'chalk-up' a cup of coffee an' a bun, if
  you're so inclined. The temperance chaps was quite surprised to see us. One
  of 'em&mdash;by the name of Adger&mdash;sez, 'What's up&mdash;got no money?'
  An' Nobby sez that we'd plenty of money, but we was seriously thinkin' of
  turnin' over a new leaf.</p>

  <p>"'Drink don't pay,' sez Nobby, highly virtuous, an' walks up to the
  counter. 'Give us a cup of brown varnish till pay day, Bill.'</p>

  <p>"Well, while we was all sittin' round the fire talkin' about the horrible
  state of the money market. an' wonderin' if we could borrow a couple of bob
  from Adger to send to Nobby's grandmother, what had the brokers in, the
  question of liars came up.</p>

  <p>"I don't know how the argument rose, but I fancy it was over the question
  of Nobby's grandmother.</p>

  <p>"'Wouldn't that be a lie?' sez a timid young chap of 'H.'</p>

  <p>"'No,' sez Nobby very indignantly, 'that would be a piece of
  authoring.'</p>

  <p>"Then he explained how Mossy was an author, an' Boyle was an author, an'
  nacherally the argument led up to money. In fact, all Nobby's arguments lead
  up to money. It's generally somebody else's money, but it's money, all the
  same.</p>

  <p>"'What you two chaps ought to do,' sez Nobby to Boyle an' Moss, 'is to put
  your heads together an' perduce something thick. See what I mean? Mossy could
  put down the things what he'd do, if the other chap would let him, an' Boyle
  could put down some of the things what he sez he's done. You could put it
  into the paper an' make a lot of money out of it.'</p>

  <p>"Accordin' to Boyle the things he'd done, an' been, before he joined the
  army would fill about twenty books as big as the Encyclo-what-d'ye-call-it.
  If he took a drop to drink an' a feller started singin' 'White Wings,' it
  used to remind him of the time when he was second mate of a lugger orf the
  coast of China; an' if a feller sung 'The Miner's Dream of Home,' he used to
  start cryin' because it called back the days when he was in California at the
  diamond mines, where he found a nugget of diamond as big as a baby's head.
  An' it didn't matter what you sung about or talked about, it always reminded
  Boyle of when <i>he</i> was there. I've seen him perfectly upset by seein' an
  advertisement in the paper for an engine-driver wanted for Central Africa,
  because of something it made him think about.</p>

  <p>"'There was me, he sez, with tears in his eyes, 'as it might be here.
  There was me brother Frank&mdash;afterwards made a doctor by special
  licence&mdash;an' there was the King of the Central African
  Cannibals&mdash;old Oojy Moojy.'</p>

  <p>"'Will you surrender?' sez the cannibal king.</p>

  <p>"'Never,' I sez.</p>

  <p>"'Very well, then,' sez the cannibal king. 'I admire your pluck,
  pale-face, but I've got to do my duty,' an' he shouts, 'Walloo, walloo,
  walloo!' just like that, an' out jumps about a thousand savage cannibals all
  gnashin' their teeth by numbers.'</p>

  <p>"The idea that Mossy and Boyle should write a book sort of caught on.
  Nobby said that the next day he'd go up an' see the young chap that runs the
  <i>Anchester Gazette.</i> Sure enough me an' Nobby went the next day, an' the
  young editor chap asked us into his office.</p>

  <p>"He's a very nice chap with spectacles, an' he knows me and Nobby.</p>

  <p>"'Hullo,' he sez, 'what's your little game?'</p>

  <p>"So Nobby told him about Boyle's an' Mossy's new book. He seemed to like
  the idea.</p>

  <p>"'You tell the chap to come an' see me&mdash;the Boyle chap,' he sez; so
  me an' Nobby went back to barracks, highly pleased with ourselves. Nobby made
  Boyle put down on a piece of paper that whatever he got from the <i>Anchester
  Gazette</i> he was to share with us. Boyle saw the editor, an' when he come
  back to barracks Nobby asked how he'd got on.</p>

  <p>"'Fine,' sez Boyle, as proud as a cat with two tails; I told him fifty
  yarns, an' he had a feller writin' it down in shorthand. He gave me a
  quid.'</p>

  <p>"So we split up the money, an' gave the coffee shop a bye. We was walkin'
  down town&mdash;me an' Nobby&mdash;when who should we run up against but the
  editor. As a matter of fact, he was on the other side of the road; but he
  smokes a cigar that you couldn't mistake the smell of in a crowd.</p>

  <p>"'Ah,' he sez, lookin' at Nobby very hard, 'you're the man I wanted to
  see.'</p>

  <p>"'Oh!' sez Nobby.</p>

  <p>"'Yes,' sez the editor, 'I wanted to thank you for sending Boyle to
  me&mdash;his stories are fine.'</p>

  <p>"'Yes,' sez Nobby, very satisfied.</p>

  <p>"'Especially that one about you,' sez the editor.</p>

  <p>"The peaceful smile on Nobby's face sort of rolled off.</p>

  <p>"'What one?' sez Nobby.</p>

  <p>"'Why,' sez the editor, 'that one, where you and he were in Egypt, and you
  fell into the Nile an' Boyle rescued you.'</p>

  <p>"'Oh, he did, did he?' sez Nobby.</p>

  <p>"'Yes; and when you were ungrateful, lifted you by the seat of your
  trousers an' chucked you back again.'</p>

  <p>"'Oh,' sez Nobby, very blank.</p>

  <p>"'And a crocodile caught you by the leg an' you cried for help, and Boyle
  said, "sing to the crocodile an' make him sick."'</p>

  <p>"'Excuse me,' sez Nobby, and turns an' walks off to barracks as fast as he
  could.</p>

  <p>"We found Boyle, in the act of tellin' a story about an elephant he killed
  on the Mississippi.</p>

  <p>"'Hold hard,' sez Nobby,' I've got a few words to say to you. What about
  that yarn you've been tellin' the editor chap about me an' the
  crocodile?'</p>

  <p>"'Oh, that!' sez Boyle, in a light an' airy way, 'that's a row-mance.'</p>

  <p>"'A author's a author,' sez Nobby, very stern, 'but when you start
  authoring about me, you're only a perishin' liar,' he sez."</p>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Daily Mail</i>, 1905<br>
  Reprinted as "Nobby Proves a Will" in <i>Nobby</i>, 1916</h3>

  <p class="first">"NOBBY CLARK went to hospital mainly on account of fruit
  bein' cheap," explained Private Smithy, of the 1st Anchester Regiment.</p>

  <p>"Him an' another chap&mdash;a fellow named Beaky, of 'H,' went out into
  town one day, an' brought back two pound of apples fresh from the
  orchard.</p>

  <p>"Nobby said he bought 'em, an' told the farmer chap who came into barracks
  an' said he could almost swear it was Nobby that he must have been
  mistaken.</p>

  <p>"'To prove my words,' sez Nobby, very indignant, an' pullin' some money
  out of his pocket, 'here's tenpence. I went into town with one an' tuppence,
  an' that's all I've got left.'</p>

  <p>"The farmer went away grumblin', an' said he'd shoot any more thievin'
  soldiers he found in his orchard, an' Nobby said if the farmer chap wasn't
  careful he'd make him prove his words.</p>

  <p>"Nobby was 'ighly delighted with the apples, an' ate most of his share an'
  half Beaky's, an' the consequence was that next mornin' Nobby was carried orf
  to hospital, an' the Medical Staff chap said that Nobby hadn't got a boy's
  chance.</p>

  <p>"All the chaps was very sorry to hear about it, especially the sergeant
  cook,, who's very sentimental, an' keeps funeral cards of all his relations
  stuck up in the cook-house.</p>

  <p>"'I'm afraid,' sez the sergeant cook, shakin' his 'ead mournful, 'Nobby's
  goin' to leave us.' An' I tell you," said Smithy, in a hushed voice, "when I
  heard him say that, it gave me a bit of a turn, for our sergeant cook's very
  lucky at predictin' things of that sort.</p>

  <p>"I got a message from the hospital that Nobby wanted to see me, so I goes
  up. an' there was poor old Nobby in a special ward by hisself , an' bein'
  treated so kindly by the Medical Staff chap that I knew it was serious.</p>

  <p>"'Hullo, Smithy,' sez Nobby, an' very weak an' white he looked.</p>

  <p>"'Hullo, Nob,' I sez, sadly, 'how goes it?'</p>

  <p>"Nobby shook his 'ead with a sad smile. "'I'm afraid I'm booked, Smithy,'
  he sez.</p>

  <p>"' Cheer up,' I sez; but Nobby took no notice, an' didn't speak for a
  bit.</p>

  <p>"'Smithy,' he sez at last, bright'nin' up a bit, 'I think I'll make a
  will.'</p>

  <p>"'What for?' I sez.</p>

  <p>"'To leave somethin'.'</p>

  <p>"'Don't worry about that,' I sez, tryin' to soothe him. 'You'll leave it,
  whether you make a will or not.'</p>

  <p>"But Nobby wouldn't be put orf, so I got a pen an' a bit of paper an'
  wrote what Nobby said.</p>

  <p>"'Put down that I'm a sound mind an' understandin'.'</p>

  <p>"'Everybody knows that, Nobby,' I sez, to cheer him up.</p>

  <p>"'Put down I leave all my kit to Private Murphy.'</p>

  <p>"'What for?' I sez.</p>

  <p>"'They won't fit you, anyway,' sez Nobby.</p>

  <p>"'Put down I leave all my money to Smithy.'</p>

  <p>"'How much have you got?' I sez.</p>

  <p>"'It ain't what I've got,' sez Nobby, 'but what's owed to me.'</p>

  <p>"It appears from what Nobby said that 'arf the regiment owed him money.
  Spud Murphy owned him one pound four an' tuppence, Pug Taylor owned him nine
  an' a penny, Tiny White owed him seven shillin's&mdash;in fact, all the money
  that was owed to Nobby took up two sheets of paper.</p>

  <p>"I noticed, though," Smithy hastened to explain, "that the fellers who
  owed Nobby money were fellers he wasn't very friendly with.</p>

  <p>"At last Nobby signed the will an' gave it to me.</p>

  <p>"'Take it,' he sez, 'an' go out an' see if you can get 'old of any of the
  money these fellers owe to their pore dyin' comrade.' So I shook hands with
  Nobby an' went back to barracks.</p>

  <p>"I put it about that Nobby'd made a will an' told the chaps I was goin' to
  read it to 'em in the canteen that night, an' there was a big gatherin',
  because Nobby's a very popular chap.</p>

  <p>"I started readin' it, an', when I got to the bit where Nobby left all his
  kit to Spud Murphy, Spud got very sentimental, an' said Nobby was a honest,
  straightforward feller, who wouldn't 'urt a fly.'</p>

  <p>"Then I got to the part where Nobby left all his money to me, an' all the
  chaps who knew Nobby hadn't got anything to leave come forward and said Nobby
  had done the right thing.</p>

  <p>"Then I read a bit further, an' gave a list of the fellers who owed Nobby
  money, an' a sort of silence fell on the crowd, and Billy Mason, who's name
  wasn't on the list, stepped up, an' said, 'Friends an' comrades all: I hope
  the chaps who owe money to pore old Nobby will be men enough to pay their
  debts to our departed comrade'&mdash;which was a very nice speech.</p>

  <p>"Spud was a bit dazed.</p>

  <p>"'Nobby ain't departed yet,' he sez; 'read that little bit again, Smithy.'
  So I did.</p>

  <p>"'One pound four an' tuppence,' sez Spud, agitated. 'I don't owe no one
  pound four an' tuppence, an' what's more, I ain't goin to pay.'</p>

  <p>"All the fellers in the crowd who wasn't on the list shouted 'Shame!' an'
  Billy Mason, shuttin' his eyes, stepped forward, an' sez, 'Friends an'
  comrades all: I hope the chaps who owe money to pore old Nobby will come
  forward like men an' pay their debts to our gallant comrade who fills a
  soldiers grave.'</p>

  <p>"'You shut up!' snapped Spud; 'you don't owe him anything, an' I keep on
  tellin' you he's not departed, an' he don't fill anything&mdash;except
  hisself with green apples. I ain't goin' to pay!'</p>

  <p>"An' some of the other fellers on the list said the same.</p>

  <p>"One or two of 'em, though, paid up like gentlemen, an' said they didn't
  remember borrowin' it, but they supposed it was all right.</p>

  <p>"But Spud was wild, an' wilder still next day when it got all over
  barracks that he was tryin' to rob a dyin' comrade.</p>

  <p>"He come to me an' said that before he paid he'd see pore Nobby&mdash;he
  didn't say 'pore Nobby'&mdash;to the other end of Hull, but I wouldn't argue
  with him.</p>

  <p>"'You know your own conscience best,' I sez. 'I don't think I'd risk bein'
  haunted for the sake of a miserable one pound four an' tuppence; an' Spud got
  very wild, an' went over to the hospital an' asked if him an' Pug Taylor
  could see Nobby.</p>

  <p>"They got permission, an found Nobby lookin' very bad.</p>

  <p>"'Look here, Nobby,' sez Spud as soon as he got in the ward, 'what about
  this money?'</p>

  <p>"'What money?' sez Nobby in a tiny, weak, squeaky kind of voice.</p>

  <p>"'The money you say I owe you,' sez Spud.</p>

  <p>"Nobby groaned.</p>

  <p>"'What do you mean by sayin' I owe you money?' sez Spud, very wild.</p>

  <p>"Nobby shook his head, very weary.</p>

  <p>"'I'm surprised at you, Nobby,' sez Pug Taylor, sorrerful, 'saying I
  borrered nine shillin's to send to my pore old mother. I ain't got no
  relations.'</p>

  <p>"But Nobby only groaned.</p>

  <p>"'You must have been wanderin' in your head,' sez Pug.</p>

  <p>"'No, I warn't,' sez Nobby, very quick. 'Don't try to get out of it that
  way. I was of sound mind an' understanding wasn't I, Smithy?'</p>

  <p>"'Never more so,' I sez, prompt.</p>

  <p>"'Fancy a man,' sez Spud, 'a man layin' on a bed of sickness, tellin' a
  lie like that! Where do you expect to go to, Nobby?'</p>

  <p>"'Don't worry me, Spud,' sez Nobby; 'don't disturb my last day or so. Pay
  Smithy what you owe me, an' say no more about it,' an' then Nobby began to
  groan an' make faces. Spud picks up his cap an' glares at Nobby.</p>

  <p>"'Don't you make no mistake, Nobby,' sez Spud; 'I ain't goin' to pay it,
  whether you 'aunt me or not.'</p>

  <p>"'You've got a hard 'art,' sez Nobby, feebly; an' Spud came back to
  barracks wilder than ever.</p>

  <p>"Next day I went up see Nobby.</p>

  <p>"He was sittin' up in an arm-chair readin'.</p>

  <p>"'Hullo, Smithy,' he sez, 'how much did you collect on the will?'</p>

  <p>"'Seven an' fourpence ha'penny,' I sez.</p>

  <p>"'Hold on to it,' sez Nobby; 'I shall be out of hospital to-morrow.'"</p>

     name="story4"></a>IV. &mdash; ON ADVERTISING</h2>

  <h3>Publiished as "Smithy on Advertising" in <i>Ideas</i>, Hulton &amp; Co.,
  London, Dec 26, 1907</h3>

  <p class="first">"THERE was a bit in the paper the other day," said Private
  Smith, "about a regiment bein' bathed once week accordin' to regulations. I
  don't know whether it's true that it won't wash itself regular, but I do know
  this, that before our colonel went an' advertised the regiment by sayin' it
  didn't like soap an' water, he'd shoot hisself.</p>

  <p>"There was a feller in ours once who used to dig up bits of Latin and
  French, an' he had one what said, 'Hot tongs, hot more,'* which meant that
  people are different nowadays to what they used to be.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* <i>Autres temps, autres moeurs.</i>]</p>

  <p>"I've known the time when colonels used to go swaggerin' up to the War
  Office pretendin' their regiment was the only real regiment in the army, an'
  that all the others was likely at any minute to go all into a gallopin'
  decline as soon as they was asked to do hard work. But nowadays that's all
  changed. Most of the colonels are 'army reformers.'</p>

  <p>"It's a sort of a game. The War Office calls all the colonels together an'
  sez&mdash;</p>

  <p>"'Well, gentlemen, I suppose you know the Army's rotten? If you don't you
  haven't been readin' the papers. Now, I want to know what you chaps have been
  doin' for your country.'</p>

  <p>"Up speaks one gallant old feller&mdash;</p>

  <p>"'I wrote an article for the <i>Friday Review</i> showin' how all the men
  are drawn from the criminal classes.'</p>

  <p>"'Good,' says the War Office, 'I'll make you a general.'</p>

  <p>"Then another hero speaks up&mdash;</p>

  <p>"'I put a bit in the <i>Times</i>, about their not bein' as good as the
  German soldiers.'</p>

  <p>"'Very good, indeed,' says the War Office. 'I'll put you in charge of the
  Intelligence Department&mdash;because you know a lot about Germans,' it
  sez.</p>

  <p>"'I made a speech at a dog show,' sez another scarred warrior,' I said
  that British soldiers was naturally dirty, an' wouldn't take baths.'</p>

  <p>"'Splendid!' sez the War Office. 'Will you have a V.C. or a pension?'</p>

  <p>"'A pension,' sez the hero, quick, 'payable in advance.'</p>

  <p>"To be a real Army reformer," Smithy went on, "you've got to start out
  with the idea that things couldn't be any worse than they are, an' you can't
  see how they're goin' to be better. Then you'll please both sides, an' get a
  reputation for bein' a deep thinker. But the great thing is to keep your name
  in front of the public so that when a war <i>does</i> come along, the
  newspapers will say, 'We strongly recommend that the foolish an'
  old-fashioned generals now in the field be recalled, an' Major-General
  Gass-Hometer, the celebrated author of <i>Should Soldiers Be Disinfected?</i>
  be immediately placed in command.'</p>

  <p>"It don't matter whether you're a fighter so long as you're a writer, an'
  it don't matter what you write, books or articles, or damnsilly orders, so
  long as it gets talked about.</p>

  <p>"We had a feller in our battalion by the name of Hawkey&mdash;one of the
  nicest chaps you'd meet in a day's march. The only thing about Hawkey that
  was in any way wrong, was the fact that he was always livin' in a fret an'
  worry that he was wastin' his opportunities. He used to mark off the days
  that passed without anything happenin' to him with a big O.</p>

  <p>"He was the chap that taught me about the newspapers.</p>

  <p>"If you don't get your name into print you might as well be dead,' he sez,
  an' I must say he got <i>his</i> name in often enough.</p>

  <p>"Once he was A Young Soldier Cured of Indigestion by Wilkins' Wafers, once
  he was A Fighting Soldier Cured of Nervousness by Nappers' Nervo. Another
  time there was a bit in the paper about him&mdash;how he always took a cup of
  Jeef Buice before goin' on guard. So what with bein' Made A New Man one week,
  an' being Saved from Death another week, Hawkey had a good time&mdash;in
  fact, he was the most celebrated man in the regiment for a while, an' every
  bloomin' post brought letters from old ladies askin' him if he could
  recommend anything for warts.</p>

  <p>"Nobby Clark ain't what I might call a jealous feller as a rule, but
  Hawkey's success got him a bit on the raw, especially as Hawkey began to put
  on side an' start givin' medical advice on the strength of his cures. So when
  I saw Nobby thinkin', an' thinkin', very hard one day, I knew he had a
  scheme.</p>

  <p>"He started readin' the newspapers which, as there wasn't any murders
  goin' on just about then, showed he was hatchin' something.</p>

  <p>"Sure enough, about two weeks after, all the London papers came out with a
  lot of stuff about Nobby, with his photograph. How he suffered for years with
  Pains in the Head after Drinkin', an' Pains in the Legs after Marchin', an'
  Pains in the Arms after Carryin' Coal. An' how he always felt tired at night.
  an' never wanted to get up in the mornin's, but after takin' two bottles of
  Swink's Tonic he was a New Man.</p>

  <p>"As soon as it got round barracks that Nobby was goin' to put himself up
  against Hawkey in the advertisin' line there was wild excitement. Most of the
  fellers backed Hawkey.</p>

  <p>"'It stands to reason,' sez Spud Murphy, 'that Nobby ain't got harf a
  chance against Hawkey. Look how well Hawkey's name is known! He's been cured
  of fits an' cured of dyspepsia, an' cured of pains in the back for years an'
  years.'</p>

  <p>"Hawkey opened the fight next week. There was a long account in the papers
  of how he was bald from his youth, havin' been born so, but, thanks to one
  bottle of Hair Jam his hair grew so fast now that it wanted cuttin' every two
  hours.</p>

  <p>"Nobby wasn't a bit downhearted. His account came out in all the London
  and Manchester papers of how, years ago, he'd broken his neck in three
  places, but thanks to Malted Embrocation, he was now able to turn his head
  right round.</p>

  <p>"Then Hawkey came out with a bit that started 'Years ago I was worn to a
  skeleton by fever and wounds. I was so thin that when the sergeant saw me
  sideways he reported me absent.' An' went on to tell about the benefit he got
  out of Fattem's Cod Liver Oil.</p>

  <p>"Nobby soon replied to that. The papers had columns an' columns headed,
  'Obesity in Barracks: Soldier who was about to be invalided out of the
  Service for Fatness cured by taking Smiler's Shadow Tablets!'</p>

  <p>"Every new paper that came out had something about Nobby or Hawkey in it.
  Nobby's was the best because he showed so much what I might call originality
  He didn't stick to medicines like Hawkey did, but dodged about.</p>

  <p>"Once he appeared in print like this&mdash;</p>

  <p>"'DEAR SIR, I send you one of your celebrated 7s. 6d. keyless gold
  watches, what I carried with me through the war. It kept good time, and was
  so regular in its habits that after a bit I got it to wind
  itself.&mdash;Yours truly,</p>

  <p>"'PRIVATE CLARK, 1st Anchester Regiment.'</p>

  <p>"Nobby bought the old watch from a feller for sixpence, and by return the
  Watch Company sent him a new one as a little present.</p>

  <p>"Then Nobby wrote about fountain pens, an' boots, an' muscle developers,
  an' things of that sort, so naturally he got a bit ahead of old Hawkey, who
  couldn't get out of the medicine way of writin'.</p>

  <p>"In fact it was Nobby that scored all along the line, and, what's more,
  after a little time, he got a jolly sight cleverer at Hawkey's own line of
  business than Hawkey was hisself&mdash;namely, in the patent medicine
  way.</p>

  <p>"In my opinion, the best thing he ever done was how he broke down from
  brain work an' had to be carried to parade on a stretcher, but three go's of
  Little Champion Lung Polish re-ju-vern-ated him. That was only one of the
  long words he used&mdash;he was a long time makin' up that letter with the
  help of a dictionary&mdash;'reciprocated' was one, and 'rehabilitated' was
  another, an' 'revivify' was another. You see he opened the dictionary at 're
  ' an' never got away from it.</p>

  <p>"It was the last one Nobby did as a matter of fact.</p>

  <p>"It was gettin' near the furlough season an' soon after this fine letter
  of Nobby's appeared, the Lung Polish people put it in the paper under the
  heading: 'A modem Miracle: Soldier's Sad Story of Sickness and Suffering.'
  Nobby paraded at orderly room with a lot of other chaps for leave of
  absence.</p>

  <p>"The adjutant saw 'em one by one, an' told 'em they could have their
  passes, or else they couldn't, as the case might be.</p>

  <p>"When it came to Nobby's turn the adjutant sez&mdash;</p>

  <p>"'Oh! Private Clark?'</p>

  <p>"'Yes, sir,' sez Nobby.</p>

  <p>"'What do you want '</p>

  <p>"'A furlough, please, sir,' sez Nobby.</p>

  <p>"The adjutant looks at him in amazement.</p>

  <p>"'A furlough? ' he sez.</p>

  <p>"'Yes, sir,' sez Nobby.</p>

  <p>"'What!' sez the adjutant in astonishment; 'go on leave? In your sorry
  state?'</p>

  <p>"'Haven't you got pains in your feet, an' pains in your head?' sez the
  adjutant.</p>

  <p>"'Thanks to Lung Polish&mdash;' sez Nobby.</p>

  <p>"'Won't you have horrid fits of nerves an' can't sleep at night?' sez the
  adjutant, who appeared to have been readin' the papers.</p>

  <p>"'I used to,' sez Nobby, 'but thanks to Bright's Nerve Pills,
  I'm&mdash;'</p>

  <p>"'An', sez the adjutant, 'am I right in believin' that you suffer from
  shortness of breath and palpitation?'</p>

  <p>"'Years ago,' sez Nobby, very agitated, I used to, but, thanks to Bilker's
  Breath Beans, I am now a new&mdash;'</p>

  <p>"The adjutant shook his head.</p>

  <p>"'No,' he sez; 'I can't give a furlough. I can't let you loose on the
  world to spread all those diseases among innocent people. I want you
  here&mdash;under my eye,' he sez, so that if the worst comes to the worst we
  can bury you with military honours,' he sez."</p>

  <h2><a id="story5"
     name="story5"></a>V. &mdash; ON PROMOTION</h2>

  <h3>Published as "Smithy on Promition" in <i>Ideas</i>, Hulton &amp; Co.,
  London, Nov 14, 1907</h3>

  <p class="first">"FELLERS who got on in the world," said Smithy sagely, 
"don't give themselves airs as a rule. It's the fellers that think they've got
  on. Me an' Nobby went to a 'do' in the town the other night. It was a lecture
  business with a magic lantern about Niagara Falls. The chap who gave the
  lecture was the head reporter on the <i>Wigshire Chronicle and Anchester
  County Gazette.</i></p>

  <p>"From what I could hear, he got a free pass to Canada on some ship or
  other. He was there two weeks, an' what he don't know about Canada now ain't
  worth knowin'. A young chap who sat next to me an' Nobby said he was a decent
  feller before he went, but since he's come back, his head's so big that he
  has had to have a bit let into his hat.</p>

  <p>"I've known fellers who've got on to such an extent that they don't really
  know how much they owe. An' do they give themselves airs? Not a bit. It's
  'Have a drink, Smithy,' an' 'Put it down to me, miss,' just as friendly as
  possible. An' it ain't always what a man becomes that makes him hefty-headed,
  it's what he dreams of becomin'. When a feller's had a good word from the
  Colonel, an' walks about barracks seein' hisself with the sergeant-major's
  gold crown on his sleeve, he's a big sight more cocky than he is when the
  bloomin' warrant comes along.</p>

  <p>"My experience is that a chap who's a private is a perfect little
  gentleman till some one gives him a stripe an makes him a lance-corporal. If
  he's got anything bad in him that's the time it comes out. Between the
  officer an' the man there ain't any middle-grades really. Non-commissioned
  officers I've never had no use for. They're mostly chaps who've polished up
  their school-board education to get out of the hard work that a Tommy has got
  to do.</p>

  <p>"So when I see a nice, bright young feller suddenly give up playin' the
  goat, an' wearin' a worried, don't-come-near-me look, I know he's doomed for
  the stripe, and cut him off my visiting list, so to speak. But the most
  'orrid thing that ever happened come about three weeks ago. On that very day
  I sez to Nobby&mdash;</p>

  <p>"'Comin' down town to-night, Nob?'</p>

  <p>"'No,' sez Nobby, quick and short.</p>

  <p>"I looks at him for a bit, for there was something is his eye I didn't
  like.</p>

  <p>"'Why not?' I sez.</p>

  <p>"'Never mind why not,' he sez, as short as ever.</p>

  <p>"'Got no money?' I sez.</p>

  <p>"'Never Mind,' he sez.</p>

  <p>"'Are you a prisoner or anything?' I sez anxiously</p>

  <p>"'Never mind,' he sez.</p>

  <p>Then the 'orrid truth broke over me.</p>

  <p>"'Nobby,' I gasps, 'Nobby, they ain't goin' to make corporal of you, are
  they?'</p>

  <p>"'They are,' he sez and stalks away.</p>

  <p>"I tell you, I was upset something awful. Me an' old Nobby have been pals
  for years, an I never thought it would come to this. Now I understood a lot.
  Why Nobby wouldn't join me and Swank Roberts when we went down town to clear
  out the <i>Peacock.</i> Why Nobby kept away from the canteen for hours at a
  time.</p>

  <p>"It was all over barracks before long that Nobby was goin' to get
  promotion, an' fellers come from all parts to look at Nobby to see what a
  corporal looked like before he was born. Nobby took no notice, sittin' on his
  bed-cot pretending to read <i>Every Soldier's Guide to Promotion</i>, an' the
  fellers who come in one by one to ask him if it was true got a short
  answer.</p>

  <p>"'I asked you a civil question,' sez Spud Murphy.</p>

  <p>"'An' I've give you a civil answer,' snaps Nobby, still pretending to read
  his book.</p>

  <p>"'You might call it civil,' sez Spud, 'but when I tell a chap to go to
  where you told me to go to, I don't reckon I'm bein' polite.'</p>

  <p>"Nobby said nothing.</p>

  <p>"'Is it true,' sez Spud, 'that you're going to be a corporal?'</p>

  <p>"'It is,' sez Nobby. 'I've told you once.'</p>

  <p>"'Well, all I can say,' sez Spud, very gloomy, is that the Army's goin' to
  the dogs. What are they goin' to make you a corporal for&mdash;your good
  looks?'</p>

  <p>"Nobby got wilder an' wilder, but said nothing.</p>

  <p>"'Have they run short of soldiers?' sez Spud aggravatingly.</p>

  <p>"Nobby got up quick, and Spud scooted.</p>

  <p>"Pug Wilson come in some time after.</p>

  <p>"'Hello, Nobby,' sez Pug sorrowfully, 'so they've caught you, have
  they?'</p>

  <p>"'Whatcher mean?' sez Nobby, very fierce.</p>

  <p>"'Ain't it true, then?' sez Pug anxiously, 'or has some one been tellin'
  lies about your being made corporal?'</p>

  <p>"'Of course it's true,' sez Nobby.</p>

  <p>"'Pore old Nobby,' sez Pug, wipin' his eyes, and walked sadly away.</p>

  <p>"Nobby was very sore at the way chaps went on.</p>

  <p>"'Look here, Smithy,' he sez, 'when I'm a corporal I'll teach these
  fellers to talk to their superior,' he sez.</p>

  <p>"'A fat lot you'll do,' I sez. 'You'll be hitting somebody an' losing your
  stripe before you've had it a week.'</p>

  <p>"Two mornings afterwards it came out in orders that our bold Nobby was to
  get the 'dog's leg,'* and the square wasn't big enough to hold Nobby as he
  walked across to the canteen.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* So called from the shape of the corporal's
  chevron.]</p>

  <p>"I met him half-way over.</p>

  <p>"'Hello, Nobby,' I sez.</p>

  <p>"'Corporal Clark, if you please,' sez Nobby, hoity-toitily.</p>

  <p>"'Never mind your bloomin' title,' I sez, 'are you going to wet the
  stripe?'</p>

  <p>"Nobby waved his hand in his grand way.</p>

  <p>"'I don't drink with privates,' he sez, 'only with men of me own rank,'
  an' he turned into the corporals' room.</p>

  <p>"When I got into the canteen I was so knocked over by Nobby's disgusting
  behaviour that I drank out of the first pot I could find.</p>

  <p>"'Hold hard, Smithy,' sez Spud. That's my beer when you've done with
  it.'</p>

  <p>"'Never mind about your beer,' I sez bitterly, 'I've lost a pal what's
  turned into a serpent.'</p>

  <p>"We had a long talk about Nobby's promotion. It was a sort of meeting like
  Nobby used to have when he was respectable.</p>

  <p>"'I can't understand Nobby taking the stripe,' sez Pug. 'Where's he going
  to get his money from&mdash;corporals ain't allowed to swindle nobody.'</p>

  <p>"The end of our discussion was that corporal or no corporal, Nobby had to
  be taken down a peg or two.</p>

  <p>"Next morning, there was Nobby on parade in the corporals' rank,
  a-twisting his moustache and frowning like anything.</p>

  <p>He hadn't got many orders to give, but he managed to get in a few remarks,
  such as, 'Now then, Wilson, look to your front,' an' 'Stop talking there,'
  an' 'Don't scratch your nose in the ranks, Smithy,' till I felt like turning
  round and smacking him in the eye.</p>

  <p>"When we got back to the barrack-room the fun began. We were all in before
  Nobby and waited. By and by in came his nibs, and Spud Murphy shouted,
  'T'shun!' and we all stood to attention. Nobby got red, and frowned worse
  than ever.</p>

  <p>"'None of your cheek,' he sez.</p>

  <p>"'No, sir,' sez Spud, saluting.</p>

  <p>"'Look here, Murphy,' sez Nobby, very hot, 'don't you come your funny
  games with me, or I'll give you a wipe&mdash;I mean I'll put you in the
  guard-room.</p>

  <p>"'Yes, sir,' sez Spud, saluting again.</p>

  <p>"'And don't you call me "sir,"' sez Nobby very fierce. 'Call me corporal,
  you putty-faced&mdash;I mean you disrespectful feller.'</p>

  <p>"Just then Pug came up and saluted.</p>

  <p>"Any orders, Colonel,' he sez, saluting.</p>

  <p>"Nobby was choking wild. You see, he was too much of a private to sneak,
  and he wasn't enough of a corporal to do the N.C.O. act.</p>

  <p>We made his blooming life a misery for the next two days. If any of us met
  him when nobody was about, we used to salute him, Spud went down on his knees
  once an' tapped his head on the ground as Nobby passed.</p>

  <p>"'Get up, you perishing recruit,' sez Nobby, 'or I'll put you in the
  guard-room.'</p>

  <p>"But Spud still knelt, sayin', 'Hail, hail, great chief,' and things like
  that, till Nobby, looking round to see if anybody was in sight, took a fine
  drop kick at him.</p>

  <p>"That rather upset the saluting business, but Vaney, who picked up a
  little bit of foreign language when he was on the motor-bus, started the
  'Mong.' It appears, from what Vaney sez&mdash;and its probably a lie&mdash;in
  the French Army, when a private talks to the colonel or the company officer,
  he sez 'Mong.'</p>

  <p>"Nobby told Vaney to do something one morning&mdash;Vaney's just been
  transferred to our company&mdash;and Vaney sez, 'Wee, wee, mong Colonel.'</p>

  <p>"'What's that?' sez Nobby quick, so Vaney repeated it.</p>

  <p>"'I want none of your cheek,' sez Nobby.</p>

  <p>"'That ain't cheek,' sez Vaney.</p>

  <p>"'What is it, then?' sez Nobby, who didn't know more than the man in the
  moon.</p>

  <p>"'It's French,' sez Vaney.</p>

  <p>"'Well, don't do it,' sez Nobby sternly.</p>

  <p>"The 'mong' business was a great success. We monged 'Nobby till he nearly
  cried.</p>

  <p>"'Smithy,' he sez to me one day, very solemn, if I have much more of this
  I shall do something pretty bad.'</p>

  <p>"'Will you, mong Nobby?' I sez.</p>

  <p>"'Yes, I will, mong fathead,' he snaps, and went away.</p>

  <p>"I've always said about Nobby that he's got second-sight. He sez so
  hisself; in fact, when he was a little boy he had to wear spectacles for it.
  So when he said that something was going to happen, I knew it was coming
  true. It came about in an unexpected way.</p>

  <p>"Me and Pug Wilson was down town one night. It was pay night, and Saturday
  night, too, and there was trouble in the blooming air. Just before we left
  barracks we had to call at the guard-room to get our passes. While we was
  there in came the Provost Corporal and said that Billy Mason was in town
  drinking like a fish. So the sergeant of the guard passed the word and got
  down the biggest pair of handcuffs he could find, and unlocked a cell door
  all ready for Billy. In the town we passed the picket, looking sad, and Pug
  said to me&mdash;</p>

  <p>"'Smithy, I smell blood.' And I could smell it. too.</p>

  <p>"It's a rum thing how affairs came about. Me and Pug passed a pleasant
  evening doing nothing, and we was coming back, talking about what a rotten
  place Anchester was, with the pubs closing at ten, when we heard the picket
  coming toward us at the double. As they went running past I saw that Nobby
  was in charge, and one of the chaps called out, 'Billy's got a rough house at
  the <i>Phoenix</i>.'</p>

  <p>So me and Pug went back to see the fun. There was a little crowd outside
  the public, and inside we could hear Billy's voice and broken glass.</p>

  <p>"Nobby pushed through the crowd, and I went into the bar with the picket.
  Billy, with his tunic off, was at the other end of the bar-room with a chair
  in his hand.</p>

  <p>"'Hello, Nobby,' he sez through his teeth, an' I could see he had one of
  his mad fits on.</p>

  <p>"'Hello, Billy,' sez Nobby quietly; 'come out of this, old son.'</p>

  <p>"'What are you going to do?'</p>

  <p>"'Put you in the clink,' sez Nobby.</p>

  <p>"'How many of you?' sez Billy, gettin' a grip of the chair.</p>

  <p>"'Put that chair down, an I'll do it myself,' sez Nobby, who is a rare
  feller for meetin' trouble half-way.</p>

  <p>"Then before he knew what was going to happen, Bill dropped the chair, and
  landing out caught Nobby a whack on the jaw that floored him, It's serious
  business to strike a corporal, an' when Billy saw what he'd done, it sobered
  him,</p>

  <p>"As Nobby picked himself up, there was a stir at the doorway, and the
  Provost Sergeant pushed his way through.</p>

  <p>"'Make that man a prisoner,' sez Nobby to the picket as quick as anything,
  and the picket closed round Billy, who was as quiet as a lamb.</p>

  <p>"'Hello,' sez the Police Sergeant; 'what's this&mdash;did this man strike
  you, Corporal Clark?'</p>

  <p>"'No,' sez Nobby.</p>

  <p>"'What's that mark on your face?'</p>

  <p>"'A birthmark,' sez Nobby, quick as lightning.</p>

  <p>"When Billy came up at the orderly room he got ten days, an' the Colonel
  said that if he's struck Nobby he'd have put him back for a Court Martial.
  But Nobby swore and swore that Billy didn't lift his hands. After Billy got
  his dose, Nobby went into the Colonel's office</p>

  <p>"At dinner-time, when we was all together in the canteen, talking about
  Nobby an' saying what a decent chap he was, in he walked.</p>

  <p>"Spud was the first to do the handsome. He ups with his pot an' handed it
  over.</p>

  <p>"'Here you are, Corporal,' he sez 'drink hearty, an' let by-gones be
  by-gones.'</p>

  <p>"Nobby took the pot.</p>

  <p>"'Not so much of the Corporal,' he sez, and then I saw his stripe had
  gone. 'I've given it up. Private's good enough for me. I like a rank where,
  if a feller hits me, I can hit him back.'"</p>

  <h3>No record of prior publication under this title found</h3>

  <p class="first">"LOTS of fellows go home for Christmas, but lots more stay
  in barracks an' enjoy themselves," said Private Smith, who is spending a few
  days with me just now, "After all, going home for Christmas ain't much catch
  unless you've got a lot of pals with you. An uncle of mine asked me home two
  years ago. He said he'd come into a lot of money and wanted to do me well,
  but the feller the money belonged to found him out, and I only see poor Uncle
  Tim now on visiting days. He's in what Nobby calls the Civil Service.</p>

  <p>"Give me barracks at Christmas time. There ain't a happier,
  light-hearteder lot of fellers than 'B' Company on Christmas Day, when
  everything's free, drinks included. Last year was the most excitin' Christmas
  we's ever had, more especially because of our pantomime what Nobby Clark got
  up, ' The Babes in the Wood, or Princess Blue Bell.'</p>

  <p>"It was all Nobby's idea, and he went an' saw the Adjutant about it, and
  the Adjutant gave permission. We rigged the library up just like a real,
  first-class London theatre, and you wouldn't have been able to tell the
  difference. Real limelight, a real band in front, and sawdust on the floor,
  and armchairs for the officers&mdash;it was fine.</p>

  <p>"We thought of getting real young ladies to play the parts, but Nobby said
  that that was carrying the thing a bit too far, so we made Nobby play the
  part of the Fairy Queen, and Tiny White and Big Harvey was the two babes in
  the wood. Nobby got a feller named Ginger, who makes poetry, to help to write
  the pantomime. Ginger's the chap who wrote that bit about the wreck of the
  <i>Birkenhead</i>. I forget how it goes, but the first verse
  starts&mdash;</p><br>

  <p class="verse"
     style="margin-left:38%">O, Comrades bold, come gather round,<br>
  And I will tell to thee,<br>
  A story of a gallant deed<br>
  Upon the briny sea.</p><br>

  <p>"It's a fine poem, and I wonder somebody hasn't took it up an' put it in
  the papers. Well, from what Nobby sez, all pantomimes are writ in verse, and
  the way him and Ginger wrote that blooming panto was a marvel. The first
  scene was the 'Lower Regions.' Nobby sez all good pantomimes start in hell
  an' end nowhere.</p>

  <p>"The Demon King was a chap named Jaggers, and he had to start&mdash;</p>

  <p>O, comrades bold, come gather round</p>

  <p>And listen to my awful sound.</p>

  <p>"You see, Ginger can't write anything unless it starts 'O, comrades bold,'
  it's a sort of habit.</p>

  <p>"Nobby had hard work making the chaps remember the bits they had to say.
  Spud Murphy was a sort of fairy godmother, and his bit went&mdash;</p>

  <p>O, comrades bold, you see in me</p>

  <p>A little fairy gay and free.</p>

  <p>But Spud couldn't think what came after that, and Nobby used to get so
  wild that I thought he'd have a stroke.</p>

  <p>"'Spud,' he sez, very solemn, 'if I've told you once I've told you six
  times that you've got to say to me&mdash;</p>

  <p>I love you, little fairy queen,</p>

  <p>You are the best I've ever seen.</p>

  <p>And if I have to tell you again I'll give you a slosh in the neck.'</p>

  <p>"What with one thing and another the rehearsals nearly killed Nobby. Two
  nights before Christmas the whole bloomin' show was upset by the Two Babes
  bein' put in the guard-room for fightin' a policeman in town. But the worst
  thing of all happened on Christmas Eve.</p>

  <p>"Me an' Nobby had been havin' a last rehearsal, an' the play went fine.
  All except the demon king part. The chap who played that was a young feller
  named Jaggers, as I told you before. I could never quite make him out, He had
  a trick of lookin' the other way when you happened to be talking to him; he
  never looked you straight in the face. He was only a recruit in a manner of
  speakin', havin' been in the regiment a year, and bein' a quiet feller, with
  a bad temper&mdash;he got perfectly wild when he was upset&mdash;nobody said
  much to him. Nobby put him in the play because he looked like a demon king at
  times. That night, at rehearsal, Jaggers was very peculiar. He said lots of
  things that wasn't in the play, an' in parts he got very excited. I was quite
  astonished when Nobby didn't say anything to him, but just answered him as
  polite and patient as anything. By an' bye, I saw Nobby talkin' to him on the
  quiet, an' when he had finished Nobby came straight across to me.</p>

  <p>"'Smithy,' he sez, as earnest as anything, 'cut across to the hospital an'
  tell the orderly on duty that something's wrong with Jaggers.'</p>

  <p>"'What's the game?' I sez, for I know Nobby is a rare feller for pulling
  your leg.</p>

  <p>"'Here, wait a bit,' sez Nobby, an' wrote down something on a paper, 'give
  this to the chap in charge.'</p>

  <p>"I could see that Nobby wasn't jokin', so I slipped off as fast as I could
  nip, an' got to the hospital just as the doctor was leavin' after his night
  visit.</p>

  <p>"I handed the paper to the orderly.</p>

  <p>"'What's that?' sez the officer, and the orderly handed it over. The
  doctor read it, an' I could see by the way he frowned that something was
  up.</p>

  <p>"'Four orderlies and a stretcher,' he sez, sharp, 'an' bring along some
  stout straps&mdash;go back to the library, Smith.'</p>

  <p>"I was as mystry-fied as could be, but when I got into the library I could
  see there was trouble.</p>

  <p>"All the fellers were standin' in the middle of the room in their
  dresses&mdash;except Nobby, who bein' a sort of manager was only in his
  uniform. But what held me was Jaggers. He was standin' in front of Nobby,
  with a long knife in his hand an' his eyes were glaring something shockin'.
  Nobby was as cool as a cucumber, which is more than I should have been, for
  Jaggers, in his demon dress, was a gashly sight.</p>

  <p>"He was shoutin' when I came in.</p>

  <p>"'I know you!' he was sayin' to Nobby, 'you're the man who has been trying
  to ruin me!'</p>

  <p>"'You're mistakin' me,' sez Nobby, very mildly for 'for my brother, who's
  very much like me.'</p>

  <p>."'You Lie!' howls Jaggers, wavin' his knife about. 'You're the man, an'
  by&mdash;'</p>

  <p>"Nobby was gradually edgin' round till he got Daggers with his back to the
  door.</p>

  <p>"If ever there was mad murder in a chap's face it was in Jaggers', and
  though I didn't like the knife a bit, I steps up to Nobby's side, an
  'sez&mdash;</p>

  <p>"'Hold hard, Jaggers ; you're makin' a bit of an error&mdash;'</p>

  <p>"He turned on me like a devil.</p>

  <p>"'You!' he sez, an' he tightened his grip on the knife 'you're the other
  villain&mdash;'</p>

  <p>"Over his shoulders I saw the four men of the medical staff in the
  doorway, an' though I ain't no friend of the Poultice Wallahs, I blessed the
  sight of their little red crosses. They were on Jaggers in the minute, the
  knife was out of his hand, and he lay helpless on the door before you could
  count two, They can handle a man can the medical staff when it comes to a
  pinch, an' the way they strapped Jaggers to a stretcher was the neatest thing
  I've ever seen done.</p>

  <p>"From what the doctor told Nobby, Jaggers was a natural born lunatic, an'
  how he got into the army nobody knows. But Jaggers goin' mad didn't upset the
  show. It takes more than a little thing like that to put Nobby out. It was
  what followed. For in half an hour, round came the orderly sergeants warning
  all sorts of chaps for guard. There had to be a double guard for Jaggers, who
  was marked 'dangerous.' About that time&mdash;we was stationed in a garrison
  town&mdash;the guard and piquets came pretty heavy on the men, an' as soon as
  I heard about the extra one, I knew where me and Nobby would spend our
  Christmas Day.</p>

  <p>"Sure enough, we was for it. No. 2 Magazine, the most horrible bloomin'
  post in the garrison. A lonely stone buildin', on the top of a hill, miles
  away from everywhere, an' on the edge of the marsh.</p>

  <p>"The only comfort was that it was a double guard, two men at a time, an' I
  knew that me an' Nobby would be together, It was snowin' a bit when we
  paraded on Christmas mornin'.</p>

  <p>"'This is a nice happy Christmas, I <i>don't</i> think,' sez Nobby
  bitterly; 'an' me who was goin' to be a fairy queen.'</p>

  <p>"Pug Wilson was paradin', too.</p>

  <p>"I'd sooner have your job than mine,' he sez, 'hospital guard over poor
  old Jaggers, an' him carryin' on something awful.'</p>

  <p>"Spud Murphy was standin' at the gate as we marched out.</p>

  <p>"'A happy Christmas, Bluebell dear; it only comes but once a year,' he
  sez, sayin' his lines with a grin.</p>

  <p>"'When I get back,' sez Nobby, through his teeth. 'I'll take Spud by the
  neck, an' bash his fat head&mdash;'</p>

  <p>"'Silence in the ranks,' sez the sergeant.</p>

  <p>"It turned out to be a most perfectly rotten day. It snowed, an' snowed,
  an' snowed, an' the wind that came sweepin' round the magazine nearly cut you
  in two. Me an' Nobby was second relief, twelve till two and six till
  eight.</p>

  <p>"We stood together in the afternoon, lookin' towards the barracks. They
  are about two miles away from the magazine, an' the guard-room's about a half
  a mile away.</p>

  <p>"'To think,' sez Nobby, 'that me an' you are stuck here, doing sentry go,
  whilst a mud-faced Cockney plasterer like Spud Murphy is drinkin' free beer
  in barracks&mdash;why, it's enough to make a chap go cracked like poor old
  Jaggers.'</p>

  <p>"That afternoon a feller who came up from barracks said Jaggers was
  better, but was still in the padded cell, an' nobody had gone in to him yet.
  It was a miserable day.</p>

  <p>"When we was 'off' we sat in front of the guard room fire an' told yarns.
  Bill Hatchett told a yarn about a ghost in India, an' Nobby told a yarn about
  a chap who used to walk about barracks at Christmas time with his 'ead under
  his arm, an' another feller told a tale about a ghost <i>he</i> saw once.</p>

  <p>"'When you've all finished tellin' lies,' I sez, 'you might wake me up,
  I'm goin' to snatch a sleep.'</p>

  <p>'The corporal of the guard woke me an' Nobby just before twelve, an' I've
  never felt less inclined for guard. It was snowin' hard when we got outside,
  an' we stepped out smart to keep ourselves warm. It seemed a long walk to the
  magazine, but we got there at last, stumblin' along in the snow, with only
  the corporal's lantern to show us the path.</p>

  <p>"The two chaps we relieved was Bill Hatchett an' Happy Johnson, an' they
  wasn't sorry to see us, I can tell you.</p>

  <p>"'Any report?' sez the Corporal.</p>

  <p>"'No, Corporal,' sez Happy, an' I thought by the light of the lantern he
  looked white, 'only me an' Bill heard some funny noises.'</p>

  <p>"'Like what?' sez the Corporal,</p>

  <p>"'Like a man laughin',' sez Johnson.</p>

  <p>"'You've been dreamin',' sez the Corporal, 'quick march.'</p>

  <p>"Me an' Nobby watched 'em disappearin' down the hill, the Corporal's lamp
  a-waggin' till they reached the guard-room.</p>

  <p>"'Cheerful blighter,' sez Nobby.</p>

  <p>"Nothin' happened for a quarter of an hour. We heard the bells in the town
  strike quarter-past twelve, an' we marched round the magazine an' pulled up
  by the sentry box. We was talkin' quietly about fellers we knew, when
  suddenly Nobby sez&mdash;</p>

  <p>"'What's that?'</p>

  <p>"We listened. Then we heard something far away.</p>

  <p>"'It's a bugle.' sez Nobby, in a whisper,</p>

  <p>"Sure enough it was. As clear as a bell it came through the snow, an there
  wasn't any mistake about it.</p>

  <p>"'It's the assembly,' sez Nobby.</p>

  <p>"The assembly at half-past twelve on Christmas night means something
  extraordinary. They don't parade the garrison at midnight for nothing.</p>

  <p>"'It can't be a fire?' sez Nobby, 'because we'd have heard the fire
  bugle?'</p>

  <p>"He propped his rifle up against the magazine an' put both hands to his
  mouth an' shouted, 'Guard, turn out.'</p>

  <p>"We shouted twice, an' then we heard another sound, a sound that made icy
  shivers run down our backs. It was somebody laughin' quietly, an' close at
  hand. I had my rifle at the charge in a second, and Nobby snatched up
  his.</p>

  <p>"'Halt, who comes there?' he shouted.</p>

  <p>Nobody answered for a second, then we heard the laugh again.</p>

  <p>"'Halt, who comes there?' Nobby shouted again. 'Stand, or I'll fire!'</p>

  <p>"I heard the bolt of his rifle snick open an' snap close again. Down below
  we could see the Corporal's lantern winkin', an' by the way it jerked I could
  tell he was running.</p>

  <p>"'Smithy,' whispers Nobby, there's somebody hidin' round the corner of the
  magazine&mdash;that "assembly" means something&mdash;halt!'</p>

  <p>"We saw a movement by the wall, A figure crouching, it looked like, an'
  Nobby raised his rifle an' took aim.</p>

  <p>"'Come out of that!' he called, 'or you're a dead man.'</p>

  <p>"We waited then a voice said softly&mdash;</p>

  <p>"'Nobby.'</p>

  <p>"Nobby lowered his rifle.</p>

  <p>"'Good God,' he whispered, 'it's poor old Jaggers&mdash;he's escaped.
  That's what the assembly was for.'</p>

  <p>"'Nobby,' sez the voice again.</p>

  <p>"'Yes,' sez Nobby softly.</p>

  <p>"'I know my lines, Nobby,' sez the voice</p>

  <p>'Behold in me the Demon King,</p>

  <p>I'm up to every single thing,'</p>

  <p>"The Corporal an' the file of the guard was quite close now.</p>

  <p>"'What's wrong?' shouted the Corporal.</p>

  <p>"'Show a light, Corporal,' sez Nobby.</p>

  <p>"When the light came, Jaggers was lyin' on the ground. He wore his demon
  king dress an' was perished with cold. Nobby knelt down an' lifted his head,
  an' Jaggers smiled.</p>

  <p>"I took off my overcoat an' tucked it round him.</p>

  <p>"'Nobby,' he sez softly, 'do I know my lines?'</p>

  <p>"'No one better, old feller,' sez Nobby gently.</p>

  <p>"Jaggers shut his eyes.</p>

  <p>"'I heard a man say you were at No. 2, so I thought I'd come an' tell you
  I knew 'em,' he said. ' I'm going to have a sleep now. I'll feel better when
  I wake up.'</p>

  <p>"Poor old Jaggers never did wake up."</p>

  <h2><a id="story7"
     name="story7"></a>VII. &mdash; SMITHY&mdash;AMBASSADOR</h2>

  <h3>Published in <i>Ideas</i>, Hulton &amp; Co., London, Nov 21, 1907</h3>

  <p class="first">"THERE'S a lot of fun in the army," said Smithy, "and
  there's a lot of blooming tragedy, too. In my service I've seen things that'd
  upset a sentimental cove like you something dreadful. Not the things you see
  on Christmas almanacs wot the grocer gives away, mind you. Not red soldiers
  dyin' on green battlefields an' dreamin' of blue mothers; but real, honest
  tragedies, with no hank whatever.</p>

  <p>"I remember a young feller joining the battalion about ten years ago. A
  nice, quiet, pleasant-spoken feller, who you could tell with half an eye was
  a tip-topper. He was a clean soldier 'an went about his work without talking,
  but me an' Nobby noticed something about him that we didn't altogether like.
  We got two posts a day at that time, and every morning an' night this chap
  used to waylay the postman an' ask if there was any letter for Private
  Morris, but none seemed to come.</p>

  <p>"He waited an' waited, and it got quite a reg'lar thing to see Morris
  waiting patiently outside the barrack-room for the postman who brought no
  letter. One day Morris got up as usual. To our surprise instead of sayin'
  'Not to-day,' as be usually did, the postman fished a letter out of his bag
  an' handed it to Morris, who stuffed it into his pocket an' walked away.</p>

  <p>"Nobby an' me was fairly friendly with him, so after a bit we walked down
  to find Morris. Naturally we thought he was one of those fellers who get a
  bit of allowance from pa, and Nobby sez, 'The best thing we can do, Smithy,
  is to go down an' prevent this pore young chap from wastin' the money he's
  got from home.'</p>

  <p>"We found Morris in the back field. He was lying down under a tree, an'
  his head was on his arm.</p>

  <p>"'What cheer, Morris?' sez Nobby, an' was going on to say something about
  coming into money when we saw Morris' face. I tell you it gave us a turn, for
  it was as white as death, an' there was something in his eyes that made me
  shiver.</p>

  <p>"I nudged Nobby an' started to walk away, for I could see that Morris was
  in trouble, but Nobby had seen something, too, and wasn't going to be put
  off.</p>

  <p>"'Hullo, Morris,' he sez, as cheerful as anything, 'somebody left you a
  fortune?' Morris didn't answer, but dropped his eyes on to the ground, and
  than I saw Nobby s game.</p>

  <p>"He sort of sauntered up casually to where Morris lay, then, stooping
  quick as lightning, he jerked something from underneath his coat. Nobby was
  as cool as a blooming ice factory.</p>

  <p>"'What's this?' he sez quite surprised. 'I'm blowed if it ain't a
  revolver, Smithy; where did you get it, Morris?'</p>

  <p>"'Give it me!' sez Morris hoarsely.</p>

  <p>"'Not me,' sez Nobby very calm. Infantry soldiers ain't supposed to have
  revolvers&mdash;especially infantry soldiers what have had letters from
  people that makes 'em look like dead men. Morris,' he sez, and Nobby was very
  earnest&mdash;for Nobby, 'is it money or is it a girl because neither of
  'em's worth&mdash;that.'</p>

  <p>"Morris made no answer, but laid face downwards with his head on his
  arm.</p>

  <p>"'Money,' sez Nobby, is hard to get hold of I admit, but girls is fairly
  plentiful; but gettin' money an' gettin' a girl is child's play compared with
  getting' a new blooming head once you've started blowing it off with a cheap
  pistol.'</p>

  <p>"Morris groaned a little, an' turned over.</p>

  <p>"'Leave me in peace, Clark,' he sez.</p>

  <p>"'That's all right,' sez Nobby, cheerful; 'it's leavin' you in pieces wot
  I'm worryin' about. I ain't going away from here, Morris, till you tell me
  an' Smithy all about it. And if me an' Smithy think it's bad enough to shoot
  yourself over, why, we'll go away an' leave you to it&mdash;we can't do
  fairer than that.'</p>

  <p>"It was a long time before Morris would chuck his trouble off his chest,
  but bimeby he up an' made a clean breast of it. It was all about a girl, like
  Nobby said it would be. Morris didn't like telling us at first, but as soon
  as he began he told us everything, even to the girl's name and where she
  lived. It appears that Morris was in love with some girl who was in love with
  him, and they had a bit of a quarrel, so he had a row and went away and
  enlisted. From what I could make out the girl had a lot of money of her own,
  and Morris had about three an' tuppence with prospects&mdash;being a rising
  young feller in the painting line of business. An' her having money and him
  having none gave him the needle, especially when people said he was after the
  brass. So the end of it was he went away, leaving a letter, saying her money
  was between him and her, an' he never wanted to hear from her again, an' if
  she wrote to him she was to address the letter care of a bank in London.
  Well, the letter she sent was the one he got that morning. She said in very
  high-class language that if a chap allowed money to upset his love, he wasn't
  any chap for her, so farewell, an' never let me hear from you again.
  N.B.&mdash;My address is now 44 Elgin Gardens, S.W.</p>

  <p>"Nobby was very indignant when Morris finished tellin' the tale.</p>

  <p>"So that's what's makin' you shoot yourself, is it,' he sez, highly
  disgusted, 'because a girl with a bit of money wants to marry you?'</p>

  <p>"'She doesn't want to marry me any more,' sez Morris very miserably.</p>

  <p>"'If she's got any sense she don't,' sez Nobby, 'but if she's an ordinary
  kind of girl she'll want to marry you more than ever.'</p>

  <p>"The end of it was that Nobby talked an' talked an' talked till Morris got
  ashamed of himself an' promised he wouldn't do any more monkey tricks. Me an'
  Nobby sold the revolver that night in town for eight-and-sixpence, an' had
  several drinks out of the money. 'What I can't understand,' sez Nobby, 'is
  what state of mind a feller gets into when he won't marry a girl with a bit
  of ready. Refuses to marry a girl because she's got money! Why, its
  blasphemous!'</p>

  <p>"We had a long talk over the matter that night, an' next morning me an'
  Nobby paraded at the orderly room an' asked for special leave of absence to
  go to London.</p>

  <p>"Going up in the train that afternoon we made up what we should say.</p>

  <p>"'What's the name again, Smith?' sez Nobby.</p>

  <p>"'Miss Dorothy Garratt,' I sez.</p>

  <p>"'Very good,' sez Nobby, noddin' his head. 'Now, Smithy, you leave all the
  talking to me. I'll say to her, "Miss, are you aware that your fianc is at
  present a soldier an' breakin' his bloomin' heart? " "Good heavens, no!"
  she'll say. "It's a fact, miss," I'll say. "He's in the Anchester Regiment,
  what's just going out to war, an' it's six to four taken an' offered that
  he'll be killed&mdash;"'</p>

  <p>"'Him being a reckless chap owin' to being in love,' I sez.</p>

  <p>"'What you an' me are, Smithy,' sez Nobby, 'are ambassadors.'</p>

  <p>"'What's that?' I sez.</p>

  <p>"'A feller that sticks his nose into other people's trouble without bein'
  asked,' sez Nobby.</p>

  <p>"Somehow, the nearer we got to the business the less me an' Nobby liked
  it. We sat over tea for a long time deciding what time we'd go, and we kept
  putting it off, an' putting it off.</p>

  <p>"It was about nine o'clock before we got to Elgin Gardens. No. 44 was a
  big, rich-looking house, and we stood outside for quite a long time.</p>

  <p>"'I expect they've gone to bed,' sez Nobby ; 'it seems a shame to disturb
  'em.'</p>

  <p>"'Let's come to-morrow,' I sez; but Nobby sort of drew a long breath an'
  went up the steps an' knocked. I've always said about Nobby that you don't
  know what he <i>can't</i> do, an' the genteel way he rat-tatted on that door
  showed his education.</p>

  <p>"We was both making up our minds to walk down the steps an' pretend that
  we'd knocked at the wrong house, when the door opened and there was a footman
  with a nice, white shirt-front.</p>

  <p>"'We want to see Miss Dorothy Garratt,' sez Nobby as bold as brass.</p>

  <p>"Bimeby the footman came back, an' sez the young lady would see us. He led
  the way upstairs&mdash;and the carpet on the stairs was soft an' crunchy,
  like snow&mdash;an' into a big room furnished better than any private bar
  I've seen.</p>

  <p>"'Stand where you are, Smithy,' says Nobby; 'if you move you'll break
  something.'</p>

  <p>"We waited about two minutes, when the door opened an' in came the
  prettiest girl you ever dreamt about.</p>

  <p>"'You wish to see me about something,' she sez inquiringly.</p>

  <p>"'Well, it's like this, miss,' sez Nobby, lookin' up at the ceiling, 'me
  an' Smithy thought we'd like to see you an' have a talk about a certain
  party. It's nothing to do with us, but he's a comrade of ours, so to speak
  an' we don't think it right.'</p>

  <p>"The young lady looked puzzled.</p>

  <p>"'I'm afraid&mdash;' she sez.</p>

  <p>"'So are we,' sez Nobby quick, 'that's just what we are, we're afraid too.
  We're a respectable regiment, an' we don't want no horrible tragedies. What
  we want is a quiet, peaceful life, an' no bloomin' upsets&mdash;begging your
  pardon&mdash;an' the sooner you make him leave the regiment the better.'</p>

  <p>"The girl looked more puzzled than ever.</p>

  <p>"'I really don't know what you are talking about,' she sez.</p>

  <p>"'Well,' sez Nobby, 'to put it plain an' above board, the chap's name is
  Morris.'</p>

  <p>"'Morris,' she sez slowly. 'I'm afraid I don't know anybody of that
  name.'</p>

  <p>"My heart went down into my boots, and so did Nobby's. I could see that by
  his dial. Poor old Nobby looked like a chap that's been dreamin' he's on
  furlough an' wakes up to find hisself in clink.</p>

  <p>"'I'm afraid, miss,' he sez sorrowfully, 'we've made a slight error. We
  thought we was doin' a chap a good turn, but we've come to the wrong address.
  I'll bid you good evening, miss.'</p>

  <p>"'Wait a moment,' she sez quick. Tell me about this Morris.'</p>

  <p>"Nobby shook his head.</p>

  <p>"'It's no good tellin' you, miss,' he sez, 'it would only make you feel
  miserable. He's a young chap of ours, who's only lately joined the army, an'
  he's in love with a girl, in consequence of which he was going to shoot
  hisself, only me an' Smithy stopped him.'</p>

  <p>"'What is he like?' she sez, an' I could see her face had gone suddenly
  white. 'Is he tall?</p>

  <p>"'Fairly,' see Nobby.</p>

  <p>"'With blue eyes?' she sez quick.</p>

  <p>"'I couldn't tell you about his eyes,' sez Nobby, but he's got a scar on
  one side of his head.'</p>

  <p>"'Yes, yes,' she sez eager.</p>

  <p>"'And he's a painter chap,' I sez.</p>

  <p>"'A painter?' she gasps. 'Why, it's Jack, and he's enlisted, and he was
  going to shoot himself, and&mdash;'</p>

  <p>"There was a lot more stuff like that. She asked about fifty questions in
  about ten seconds, an' she rung the bell an' ordered dinner for us.</p>

  <p>"She was in a terrible state of mind, although Nobby told her it was no
  good thinkin' about going to Anchester that night.</p>

  <p>"'Whatever you do, miss.' sez Nobby, 'don't you tell Morris to-morrow that
  me an' Smithy have seen you. Just write to him to meet you. There's a nice
  quiet hotel with a big garden where you can see him.'</p>

  <p>"'How can I thank you, Mr Clark?' she sez, with tears in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"'Don't mention It, miss,' sez Nobby, very agitated.</p>

  <p>"She walked over to a desk, opened a drawer, an' took something out.</p>

  <p>"'You must let me pay your expenses to London, she sez, an' she held out
  two banknotes to Nobby.'</p>

  <p>"'Thank you, miss,' sez Nobby quietly, 'but our expenses ain't worth
  mentionin'. We're very much obliged, but we couldn't think of takin'
  money.'</p>

  <p>"'I'm sorry,' she sez, flushing. 'I'm afraid I've hurt your feelings. Is
  there nothing I can do for you to show my gratitude?'</p>

  <p>"Nobby shook his head.</p>

  <p>"'Nothin', miss,' he sez. ' I've only one inclination just now&mdash;and
  so has Smithy.'</p>

  <p>"'What is yours?' she sez.</p>

  <p>"'A pint of Burton, thank you, miss,' sez Nobby.</p>

  <p>"'Mine's the same,' I sez."</p>

     name="story8"></a>VIII. &mdash; HOGMANAY</h2>

  <h3>Published as "Smithy on Hogmanay", <i>Ideas</i>, Hulton &amp; Co.,
  London, Jan 2, 1908</h3>

  <p class="first">"NOBBY CLARK was tellin' me a yarn the other day," said
  Private Smith, "about two blokes who got blown up in a quarry. One called
  Jack an' the other Bill. They used to hate the sight of each other, but they
  was put in beds next to one another, an' as Jack lost his nose an' Bill lost
  his ear in the explosion, they couldn't very well pass any unpleasant remarks
  between theirselves. Jack wasn't a bad-feelin' sort of chap, so on New Year's
  Day he ups an' sez&mdash;</p>

  <p>"'An happy New Ye'r to you, Bill.'</p>

  <p>"The other bloke got very wild.</p>

  <p>"'An' a happy new nose to you,' he snarls, 'don't be so bloomin'
  personal.'</p>

  <p>"What made Nobby tell me this was the nice kind sentiments that are goin'
  cheap just about now, where lots of fellers go round wishin' people they
  don't know, things they don't mean.</p>

  <p>"Spud Murphy is one of the chaps who always gets sloppy about this time of
  the year, an' when he came up to Nobby a few days ago an' sez, 'A happy New
  Year', Nobby turns round an' sez, 'I don't want your good wishes. I've told
  you so about six years runnin', an' if I have to tell you again you'll get a
  dig in the eye!'</p>

  <p>"New Year's Day," continued Smithy, "ain't nothing in the Army unless
  you've got some pals in an Highland regiment. The 'Jocks' celebrate New
  Year's Day just the same as camels celebrate any day they happen to strike a
  river&mdash;they take in enough supplies to last 'em the rest of the
  year.</p>

  <p>"There was a 'Jock' by the name of Ogilvie when we was quartered next to
  the 91st, who was a rare friend of mine an' Nobby's.</p>

  <p>"He was one of them Scotsmen you never read about, freehanded an' liberal,
  an' he came from a little village called Glasgow&mdash;which is why he was
  called a Highlander.</p>

  <p>"One Year's Eve he sez to me an' Nobby&mdash;</p>

  <p>"'Come into our barracks for hogmanay.'</p>

  <p>"'No thanks,' sez Nobby, 'I'm Church of England.'</p>

  <p>"So Ogilvie explained it was nothin' to do with religion.</p>

  <p>"'Is it something to drink?' sez Nobby, an' Ogilvie sez yes, so me an'
  Nobby said we'd be there.</p>

  <p>"We turned up all right, and there was everything of the best, an' chaps
  was singin' an' chaps was dancin', an' one chap was playin' the bagpipes
  something awful.</p>

  <p>"'I don't know why you call it hogmanay,' sez Nobby; 'it tastes like
  whisky&mdash;perhaps it's the Scotch way of spellin' it.'</p>

  <p>"'It is,' sez Ogilvie.</p>

  <p>"As I was for guard the next day I took a lot of water with my hogmanay,
  an' went away early. As I left, I heard Nobby tellin' a 'Jock'&mdash;</p>

  <p>"'I'm a genuine Scotchman myself&mdash;having been born in
  Scotland&mdash;my father always wore kilts, an' me sister married a chap in
  the butterscotch line&mdash;'</p>

  <p>"I didn't hear the rest of it. Nobby is what you might call 'adaptable.'
  Nobby got back to barracks about 3 a.m. I heard him, an' so did everybody
  else. He was singin' a song about a girl who was 'bonnie' an' lived in a
  'bonnie' house in 'bonnie' Scotland, an' the way he'd got hold of the Scotch
  accent was simply marvellous.</p>

  <p>"He was singin' another song about 'bonnie Highland Mary,' when the
  corporal of the room sez&mdash;</p>

  <p>"'Now then, Mr. Blooming Clark, not so much "bonnie"; get to bed, or I'll
  be puttin' you where the pigs won't bite you.'</p>

  <p>"Nobby must have got a lot of hogmanay into him, for he ups and
  sez&mdash;</p>

  <p>"'Hoot, mon&mdash;dinna blether.'</p>

  <p>"'What's he say?' sez the corporal.</p>

  <p>"'Ye'll tak' the high road, an' I'll tak' the low,' sings Nobby.</p>

  <p>"'Ye'll tak' the road to the guard-room,' sez the corporal, getting out of
  bed an' scrambling into his clothes, an' he orders me an' another chap to get
  out of bed an' escort Nobby to the clink.</p>

  <p>"'What!' sez Nobby, lookin' reproachfully at me&mdash;'what! ma wee
  freen', ma brither Scot, ma bonnie Smithy&mdash;'</p>

  <p>"'Shut up!' I sez, an' we led him over to the guardroom. He didn't say
  much, except that it was a 'braw munelicht nicht the nicht,' an' what
  <i>that</i> meant I don't know.</p>

  <p>"The guard took his boots off an' put him in a cell, an', after he'd
  called the sergeant of the guard a 'low Southerner' or somethin' equally
  insultin', be went to sleep.</p>

  <p>"When I took his breakfast across next mornin' he looked a bit silly.</p>

  <p>"'Let this be a warnin' to you, Smithy,' he sez very solemn, 'don't take
  foreign drinks&mdash;beer's all right an' whisky's all right&mdash;but
  hogmanay is poison.'</p>

  <p>"Now, everybody likes Nobby, an' the corporal of the room didn't want to
  jug him for drunk,' so he made it up with the sergeant of the guard that
  Nobby was to be 'crimed' for creatin' a disturbance in barracks after
  lights-out, and Nobby accepted the three days' C.B. with a thankful
  heart.</p>

  <p>"The next day he said he was goin' to join the A.T.A. (Army Temperance
  Association), an' asked me if I'd join, too, so I said I would, an' we become
  members&mdash;section 'B' members, drink as much as you can carry, but don't
  make a beast of yourself&mdash;that's section B.'</p>

  <p>(In justice to that admirable institution, I must explain that the
  membership is divided into two sections, A being for total abstainers, B for
  the moderate drinkers.)</p>

  <p>"Our Sergeant-Major's cracked on drink," continued Smithy, "he can't see a
  bit of grease on a belt without thinkin' it's alco-what-is-it? Lots of chaps
  joined the A.T.A. to get a lance-stripe; me an' Nobby joined to start the New
  Year well.</p>

  <p>"'Glad to see you, Private Smith; glad to see you, Private Clark,' sez the
  S.-M., shakin. hands with me an' Nobby as if we was human bein's.</p>

  <p>"'Are you goin' to join?'</p>

  <p>"'Thank you kindly, sir,' sez Nobby. ' I don't mind if I do.'</p>

  <p>"'Shall it be section "A"?' sez the Sergeant-Major, smilin'.'</p>

  <p>"'Make it "B," sir,' sez Nobby, 'an' we'll try to work back to "A"
  gradual.'</p>

  <p>"So we puts our names down, an' after singin' a bit, an' hearin' two
  recruits recite 'Billy's Rose' an' 'The Last Shot,' we goes out.</p>

  <p>"Just as we got up near the canteen, we heard some one say&mdash;</p>

  <p>"'Here comes the new bun-thumpers; let's tempt 'em,' an' out comes Spud
  Murphy with harf a gallon.</p>

  <p>"'What! me true blues!' sez Spud, offerin' the can, 'passin' by your old
  haunts without droppin' in? Take a swig, Nobby.'</p>

  <p>"So Nobby took the harf gallon an' looked at it, serious.</p>

  <p>"Then he sez, 'Away, tempter,' but held on to the beer.</p>

  <p>"All the chaps the beer belonged to was larfin' like anything, an' saying,
  'Go on, Nobby, break out&mdash;a little drop won't hurt you.'</p>

  <p>But Nobby shook his 'ead, sorrerful.</p>

  <p>"'I ain't got the face to,' he sez sadly, 'after me takin' the pledge an'
  all,' but he lifted the beer all the same, an' took a long sip. Then he
  handed the can to me an' whispers, 'Drink hearty, Smithy,' which I did.</p>

  <p>"Then we handed the can back.</p>

  <p>"Spud looks inside, and then looks at us.</p>

  <p>"'You've drunk it all,' he sez, very fierce.</p>

  <p>"'I know I have, Spud,' sez Nobby sorrerfully; 'I know I have&mdash;don't
  tempt me to drink any more.'</p>

  <p>"'Don't worry yourself about that,' sez Spud hotly; what about the
  bloomin' pledge you've signed?'</p>

  <p>"'That,' sez Nobby slowly, 'is what you might call a temp'ry
  pledge&mdash;and only applies to hogmanay. I'm goin' to keep off hogmanay for
  twelve months at least.'"</p>

  <h2><a id="story9"
     name="story9"></a>IX. &mdash; ON FINANCE</h2>

  <h3>Published as "Smithy on Finance" in <i>Ideas</i>, Hulton &amp; Co.,
  London, Nov 7, 1907</h3>

  <p class="first">PRIVATE Smith was in a philosophical frame of mind.</p>

  <p>"The world's a funny little place," he said sententiously. "As Nobby Clark
  was sayin' the other day, dear friends, wot you'd lost sight of and hoped was
  dead, are always croppin' up an' sayin', 'Hullo. Nobby, what about that two
  bob you borrowed in Bombay?'</p>

  <p>"Nobby sez he read a sayin' about good people dying young, and that's
  true. Fellers you owe money to never die. If you read a bit in the paper
  about a feller runnin' to catch a train an' droppin' dead, or about a
  gentleman fallin' from the fourth floor when he's cleanin' the bedroom
  winders, you can bet nobody owes money to <i>him</i>.</p>

  <p>"Antony Gerrard, esquire&mdash;him I told you about&mdash;sez, 'I neither
  borrow nor lend,' when Nobby tried to touch him the other day, so Nobby
  sez&mdash;</p>

  <p>"'I don't want Scripture, Tony, I want a bob.'</p>

  <p>"'If you take my advice&mdash;' says Antony.</p>

  <p>"'I don't want advice, I want a bob till pay day,' sez Nobby, very
  patient.</p>

  <p>"'Him that goes borrowin' goes sorrowin',' sez Antony.</p>

  <p>"'I don't want advice, and I don't want poetry,' sez Nobby, still very
  patient, 'I want one blooming shillin' or twelve blooming pence.'</p>

  <p>"'The end of it was that Antony parted with eleven-pence an' two
  half-penny stamps.</p>

  <p>"I know lots of people who spend money to make the time pass. But there
  ain't any quicker way than borrowin' a couple of bob till Wednesday. Why, you
  ain't got time to put the money in your pocket before Wednesday's come an'
  gorn!</p>

  <p>"Nobby's the best borrower I know. Sometimes he pays back and sometimes he
  don't. He's very careless in money affairs, is Nobby; and when you see him
  cutting bits out of the paper about people who've suddenly lost their memory,
  you can be pretty sure that he owes a bit, an' is sort of making up an
  alibi.</p>

  <p>"He owed a feller named Boysey&mdash;a red-headed chap &mdash;close on ten
  bob for months an' months.</p>

  <p>"When Boysey came up to him on pay day to collect, Nobby's face got a
  worried look.</p>

  <p>'"'What about that ten bob?' sez Boysey.</p>

  <p>"'What's my name?' sez Nobby, very bewildered.</p>

  <p>"That staggered Boysey.</p>

  <p>"'Why, Nobby Clark,' he sez.</p>

  <p>"'Ha, ha!' sez Nobby faintly. 'Ha, ha! What a funny name!'</p>

  <p>"Boysey got scared, and walked away quick, pretendin' he was in a hurry to
  get to the canteen before it shut.</p>

  <p>"I met him comin' across the square, and he looked upset.</p>

  <p>"'Pore old Nobby's gorn off his chump,' he sez excitedly, 'gorn clean off
  his bloomin' napper.'</p>

  <p>"'What's up?' I sez.</p>

  <p>"'Why, he don't know his own name,' sez Boysey, all of a tremble, 'and
  he's laughin' and ravin' like a lunatic.'</p>

  <p>"When I got up to the room I found Nobby sitting on a bed trying to make
  up a limerick.</p>

  <p>"'Hullo, balmy!' I sez.</p>

  <p>"'Hullo, Smithy,' be sez. 'Where's Boysey?'</p>

  <p>"'Gorn to get the key of the padded cell,' I sez. 'You're a nice feller,
  losing your memory.'</p>

  <p>"'Smithy,' he sez, very earnest, 'it's the only thing I've got that's
  worth losing.'</p>

  <p>"I've never discovered what Nobby does with his money. I asked him once,
  an' he told me he was supporting a widdered mother. Then I got to find out
  that he hadn't got a mother, and I told him so.</p>

  <p>"Nobby wasn't a bit upset at being found out.</p>

  <p>"'When I said "mother,"' he sez calmly, 'I meant my Uncle Bill, who's been
  a widdered mother to me.'</p>

  <p>"The company officer asked him once&mdash;</p>

  <p>"'What do you do with your money, Clark&mdash;I'm always hearing from
  people you owe money to?'</p>

  <p>"'I'm savin' up, sir,' he sez.</p>

  <p>"'But why don't you pay your debts?' sez the officer.</p>

  <p>"'Nobby was very wild about this afterwards.</p>

  <p>"'How can a chap save up if he's got to pay his debts?' he sez to me.
  'Payin' your debts Is simply wastin' your money&mdash;why it's worse than
  drink!'</p>

  <p>"From what Nobby said, it appeared he was saving up to go into business.
  Last Wednesday week the fellers were chaffin' Nobby about this.</p>

  <p>"Nobby took no offence.</p>

  <p>"'I'm going,' sez he, 'to open a high-class money-lender's.'</p>

  <p>"We was so took back that none of us could speak.</p>

  <p>"'A high-class <i>what</i>?' sez Spud.</p>

  <p>"'Money-lender's,' sez Nobby, quite calm; 'people are getting so stingy in
  barracks that you can't borrow a bob when you want it without 'em coming to
  get it back again. So I'm going to lend money on a new plan. If you can't pay
  it back, go on owing it.</p>

  <p>"The funny thing about Nobby's plan was that it was so simple. All that
  you had to do If you wanted money was to go and ask for it. It was so
  blooming simple that a good number of chaps who wanted money pretty badly,
  got suspicious.</p>

  <p>"Boysey called a meetin' of Nobby's creditors.</p>

  <p>"'It's like this,' sez Boysey. Nobby owes me ten bob, and he owes Pug
  Wilson four bob, and Antony two bob, and if he's got any money to lend, the
  first thing that he ought to do is to pay back the like of us. I vote that we
  all go to Nobby, one at a time, and borrow what we can, and when we've got
  the money stick to it.'</p>

  <p>"All Nobby's creditors said that it was a good plan, and they tossed up
  odd man out to see who'd go first.</p>

  <p>"Boysey won it, so up he went to Nobby.</p>

  <p>"'Nobby,' sez he, ' I'd be greatly obliged if you'd lend me five bob.'</p>

  <p>"'Certainly,' sez Nobby, pullin' out a bit of paper and a pencil.</p>

  <p>"'What's this?' sez Boysey.</p>

  <p>"'That's a paper what you've got to sign.' sez Nobby.</p>

  <p>"'Whaffor?' sez Boysey, very indignant. 'I didn't ask you to sign an
  I.O.U. when I lent you ten bob.'</p>

  <p>"'This is different,' sez Nobby, very serious, 'this ain't an I.O.U. it's
  a U.O.Me.'</p>

  <p>"When Boysey signed his name Nobby collected a bob from him.</p>

  <p>"'I've got to make a lot of inquiries,' sez Nobby, 'before I lend
  money.'</p>

  <p>"Boysey didn't like parting, but he thought it was worth while.</p>

  <p>"Spud Murphy wanted to borrow two shillin's till pay day, and when Nobby
  tried to corral a tanner for inquiries Spud sez Nobby was a swindler.</p>

  <p>"But all this time Nobby was lendin' money to other fellers right enough.
  Fourpence for tuppence, an' sixpence for fourpence, an' it looked as though
  he'd got a good thing on. When fellers came who Nobby didn't trust he used to
  pull out his bit of paper an' make 'em sign, then get a shillin' out of 'em
  for inquiries.</p>

  <p>"One day Nobby sez to me&mdash;</p>

  <p>"'I'm doin' so well that I'm gettin' frightened. I made four an' tuppence
  last week profit. Everybody's paid back, an' nobody owes anything.'</p>

  <p>"I think Nobby must have lost his head just about then, because he lent
  money to everybody.</p>

  <p>"He came to me about a week after, lookin' 'orribly wild, an' the way be
  went on gnashing his teeth an' saying he'd kill old Boysey was as good as a
  play. Boysey hadn't paid back the five, and, what was worse, he'd put all the
  other fellers up to a wrinkle or two.</p>

  <p>"'I'll show 'em,' sez Nobby, and that night him an' me went over to the
  canteen together to collect accounts.</p>

  <p>"The first feller we saw was Spud Murphy.</p>

  <p>"'Hullo, Spud,' sez Nobby, tryin' to be cheerful.</p>

  <p>"'Where am I?' sez Spud.</p>

  <p>"'You're in the canteen drinkin' another man's beer,' sez Nobby.</p>

  <p>"'Who am I?' sez Spud, in a far-away voice.</p>

  <p>"'Look here,' sez Nobby, very wrathy, 'don't you come them lost memory
  games on me, because I invented 'em&mdash;see? If you want to know who you
  are, I can tell you in twice. You're a bottle-nosed Houndsditch Irishman wot
  owes me two bob.'</p>

  <p>"'I feel strange,' sez Spud in a wild way.</p>

  <p>"'You'll feel stranger,' sez Nobby, chuckin' his cap on the ground 'you'll
  feel so strange that your mother won't know her darling child if you don't
  fork out that three bob.'</p>

  <p>"'<i>Two</i> bob,' sez Spud, comin' round quick.</p>

  <p>"'Three bob,' sez Nobby; 'two bob I lent you and a bob extra for the
  trouble in getting it back.'</p>

  <p>"It was worth all the extra bobs Nobby could get, because all the chaps
  who owed money to Nobby got a fit or something as soon as Nobby got near him.
  Pug Wilson's memory was worse than Spud's, only Pug's way was more
  aggravatin' than Spud's.</p>

  <p>"'What about that two bob you owe me?' sez Nobby, very pleasant.</p>

  <p>"'What two bob?' sez Pug.</p>

  <p>"'The two bob I lent you one night,' sez Nobby.</p>

  <p>"'Was it rainin'?' sez Pug, looking very puzzled.</p>

  <p>"'I didn't notice the weather,' sez Nobby, getting warm; 'I only noticed
  that I lent you two bob&mdash;two separate shillin's.'</p>

  <p>"Pug was more puzzled than ever.</p>

  <p>"'Did one have a hole in it?' he sez.</p>

  <p>"'I didn't notice the hole,' sez Nobby shortly, 'I only
  noticed&mdash;'</p>

  <p>"'Where was I?' sez Pug.</p>

  <p>"'Here,' sez Nobby.</p>

  <p>"'Was my back to the counter, or was I sitting down?' sez Pug, still
  puzzled.</p>

  <p>"Nobby sort of drew a long breath.</p>

  <p>"'Pug,' he sez kindly, 'if you ask me any more questions I'll put you down
  and tread on you. Pug, your life's worth two bob&mdash;pass it over.'</p>

  <p>"By the time Nobby had collected twelve shillin's he was getting grey, and
  when Boysey came into the canteen I saw something was goin to happen. Nobby
  didn't see him come in, so I slipped over to Boysey.</p>

  <p>"'Boysey,' I sez, quick, 'you owe five bob to Nobby. When he asks for it
  don't do the funny business or the lorst memory business&mdash;I'm advisin'
  you as a friend.'</p>

  <p>"Just then Nobby saw him, and braced himself up; then he came over. Boysey
  didn't make his face blank or have a fit or anything. He waited till Nobby
  came up.</p>

  <p>"'Five shillin's,' sez Nobby, very short, 'and look lively.'</p>

  <p>"'Will you have it now,' sez Boysey, as bold as brass, or will you wait
  till quarter-day?'</p>

  <p>"'I'll have it,' sez Nobby, chokin', 'whilst you're alive, Boysey. Don't
  worry me. Boysey, there's madness in me family. I've got a brother who killed
  a policeman an' another one who backs Captain Joe's naps....'</p>

  <p>"'That night Nobby said to me&mdash;</p>

  <p>"'Smithy, let this be a warnin' to you. Never get hold of any money an'
  never lend it. The happiest feller is the feller that borrows. He's got
  nothin' to worry him&mdash;it's the feller that lends that's got all the
  worryin' to do&mdash;let's go down town and blue this cursed wealth.'"</p>

  <h2><a id="story10"
     name="story10"></a>X. &mdash; THE HEROES</h2>

  <h3>Published as "Smithy's Band of Heroes" in <i>Ideas</i>, Hulton &amp; Co.,
  London, Oct 24, 1907</h3>

  <p class="first">"BEING a hero is not much catch nowadays," said Private
  Smith, gloomily.</p>

  <p>"Not that I've ever gone in for that line of business except once. I've
  always thought it was bad for the eyesight. We had a feller in ours once who
  stopped a runaway cab in the High Street, and the Mayor and Corporation gave
  him a gold watch and chain. It quite altered the young feller. Before, he was
  the sort of chap who wasn't above coming back to barracks an hour or so after
  lights-out, as genial, kind-hearted and let's-have-another sort of man as you
  could wish to meet. But as soon as he got into the Hero class, he was
  changed. It was perfectly sickenin' to watch him. He'd start at half-past
  seven by pulling out his bright gold watch.</p>

  <p>"'Hullo!' he says; 'I've got another two hours yet.' It was one of them
  watches with a hole in the case for you to see the time by. There wasn't any
  necessity to open it, but old Wilkie&mdash;that was his name&mdash;used to
  open the case every time and hold the watch close up to his eyes. Sometimes
  he wasn't sure it was going: then he used to hold it up to his ear for about
  three minutes, with all the chaps in the bar not daring to breathe while he
  heard if the 'tick-tick' was all right.</p>

  <p>"Being a hero makes you short-sighted and hard of hearing, especially if
  you get a cheap rolled-gold American clock for being one. And every hour,
  regular, all through the evening, out would come his watch to see if it was
  time to get back to barracks.</p>

  <p>"That's what fed me and Nobby up with the hero trade, and when the war
  started and heroes began to get as common as V.C.'s in a Highland regiment,
  we thought it was about time for Wilkie to forget all about the cab-horse
  performance.</p>

  <p>"It was when the regiment was on the train going up to the front that
  Nobby told Wilkie what he thought.</p>

  <p>"'Wilkie,' he sez, 'put away that cheap little ticker of yours and pay a
  little attention to your Uncle Nobby. Wilkie, the hero market is overcrowded.
  You're amongst the fourth-class shots in the hero squad, Wilkie. In a week or
  so this blooming battalion will be so full up with heroes that you won't be
  able to walk a yard without treading on one. And they'll be real heroes,
  Wilkie, with their pictures in the papers, and if you start giving yourself
  airs about stopping that poor old cab-horse, wot wouldn't 'urt a fly, you'll
  be in much about the same position as a selling-plater in the Jockey Club
  Stakes.'</p>

  <p>And sure enough what Nobby said came true. There was Hero Jordan, who
  brought up the ammunition wagon at Nelspruit; and Hero White, who carried
  'Kinky' James out of the line of fire when he was wounded; and Hero Tarbut,
  the chap who saved the pom-pom&mdash;in fact the heroes in the regiment
  multiplied like rabbits.</p>

  <p>"When the regiment got home again after the war we was all heroes. People
  we didn't know used to stop us in the street and shake hands with us, and
  uncles of mine I'd never heard of in my life sent me invitations to spend a
  week with 'em.</p>

  <p>"You couldn't walk a yard without something being in the newspapers about
  it:&mdash;</p>

  <p>'We hear that Mr. George Smith, our respected fellow-townsman, is
  entertaining his nephew, Private Smith, of the Anchester Regiment, who
  heroically fought at Ladysmith.'</p>

  <p>"That was years and years ago, and the last time I went down to see Uncle
  George I got into the paper again:&mdash;</p>

  <p>Isn't it time that the military authorities took steps to save Mudbury
  from the plague of soldiers? They seem to swarm in our streets, and our
  respected fellow-townsman, Mr. George Smith, has had an unpleasant
  experience. A drunken private, claiming to be Mr. Smith's nephew, called at
  his house and was very properly refused admittance. Whereupon he struck Mr.
  Smith in the chest and made off.'</p>

  <p>"The hero business is played out now. The heroes are carrying coal and
  drinking beer like ordinary people, and as to old Wilkie&mdash;why, even he
  ain't one&mdash;and he was a civilian hero, too.</p>

  <p>"I was speaking to Wilkie the other day about it.</p>

  <p>"'I give up bein' a hero when the gold began to wear off the watch and
  leave little black patches,' sez Wilkie sadly.</p>

  <p>"'What we want,' sez Nobby Clark, 'is a heroes' trade union.'</p>

  <p>"'At so much a week?' says Spud Murphy unpleasantly, but Nobby took no
  notice.</p>

  <p>"'We want all the heroes to join together and stick up for their rights,'
  he sez&mdash;Nobby was very great on societies and things of that sort. Well,
  the fellers were rather struck with the idea, but they was a bit suspicious
  of Nobby. But Nobby took his solemn oath, see-that-wet-see-that-dry-cut-my-throat-if-I-tell-a-lie, that he wasn't going to make a penny out of
  it, and it was agreed that a society should be formed for the Encouragement
  of Heroes.</p>

  <p>"We had a meeting next night, and Nobby took the chair.</p>

  <p>"'The first business is to get the heroes,' sez Nobby; 'now who's the
  first?'</p>

  <p>"Nobody answered for a bit, but Wilkie coughed and looked round the room
  to show the fellows he was there.</p>

  <p>"'Well,' sez Nobby, after a bit. ' I'll put myself down first.'</p>

  <p>"'Wot have you done in the hero line?' demanded Spud loudly.</p>

  <p>"Nobby eyed his steadily.</p>

  <p>"'Friends and comrades all,' sez Nobby, shutting his eyes, like he always
  does when he makes a speech, 'I don't want to boast, but once on the line of
  march, when the regiment was on 'arf rations, I gave Pug Wilson my rations
  because he was hungry. Ain't that true, Smithy?'</p>

  <p>"'It is so,' I sez, but it was because Nobby is what I call a dainty
  feeder an' very particular as to what he eats.</p>

  <p>"So Nobby puts his name down.</p>

  <p>"I next propose Smithy,' he sez, owing to his heroic conduct at
  Bloemfontein.'</p>

  <p>"All the fellers were puzzling their heads trying to think what I'd done
  special at Bloemfontein, and I was a bit puzzled myself'.</p>

  <p>"'When was that, Nobby?' I sez.</p>

  <p>"'The night we pinched the chickens,' he sez calmly.</p>

  <p>"'Here, hold hard,' sez Spud; 'there's nothing heroic about stealin'
  chickens.'</p>

  <p>"'That,' sez Nobby, as calm as you please, 'depends on the chicken. These
  chickens were the fiercest chickens you ever saw.' So he put my name
  down.</p>

  <p>"A lot of fellers had come to the meeting not hoping to get into the
  Heroes' Society, but when they saw how easy it was, and that there was
  nothing to pay, they started to hand in their names.</p>

  <p>"Hoppy Sands joined because he once helped a policeman to take a drunken
  man to the station; Harry Gill came in because he was once bit by a dog.</p>

  <p>"'I'll come in, Nobby,' sez Spud, who'd been hanging back a bit.</p>

  <p>"'What have you ever done besides time?' sez Nobby.</p>

  <p>"'Never mind what I've done,' sez Spud loudly; 'but if I'm not more of a
  hero than some of you fellers I'll eat my boots.' .</p>

  <p>"Nobby and Spud ain't very good friends, and Nobby got up and walked over
  to Spud.</p>

  <p>"'Do I understand,' he sez, 'that you consider yourself a better hero than
  me?'</p>

  <p>"'I do,' sez Spud.</p>

  <p>"'For why?' sez Nobby quietly.</p>

  <p>"'Because I could jolly well knock your fat head orf,' sez Spud, as fierce
  as anything.</p>

  <p>"'The meeting is adjourned,' sez Spud, whilst me and this other hero go
  outside and see who is the best hero of the two.'</p>

  <p>"It came out in the end that Nobby was a black eye and a tooth better hero
  than Spud, and it led to a lot of unpleasantness afterwards. What's more it
  ki-boshed the society, because Spud found out that all the encouragement he
  got was from a lot of chaps who stood round and said, 'Go on, Nobby; give him
  the upper cut. Smash him, Nobby; oh, well hit, sir!' and things like
  that.</p>

  <p>"Spud said that the Society for Encouraging Heroes only encouraged Nobby,
  and it was a bit too one-sided.</p>

  <p>"The row went on for a couple of months. One night Nobby was coming back
  to barracks a little after twelve. He'd been over to see a gentleman who owns
  a rat-pit at Stokely, and he had missed his train and had to walk. He was
  taking a short-cut across some fields, and had just reached the big house
  that stands at the end of the town, a mile from the nearest house, when he
  heard an awful row. A girl came shrieking down the drive. Nobby could see she
  had her nightdress on and knew there was trouble.</p>

  <p>"She was sobbing and shrieking, and Nobby caught her arm.</p>

  <p>"'Here,' sez Nobby shaking her, 'what's the matter? What's biting ye?'</p>

  <p>"He couldn't get anything out of her for a minute, and then a light
  through the trees told him what was the matter.</p>

  <p>"'Fire!' shouts Nobby, and shook the girl.</p>

  <p>"'Is there anybody in the house,' he roars, but the girl was nearly mad
  with fright.</p>

  <p>"Nobby sez he gave her a smack on the head to pull her together.</p>

  <p>"'Two children,' she wails, and clung on to Nobby. From what he could
  gather the master and misses were out at a ball and the other servants were
  away too. She babbled something about a 'soldier,' but Nobby didn't wait to
  hear. He was running up to the house. The front door was open, and the two
  top floors were ablaze, the flames coming out through the window.</p>

  <p>"He took off his belt and ran into the house.</p>

  <p>"The hall was full of smoke, but he stumbled along till he found the
  stairs, and went blundering up with his eyes shut. He got to the first floor,
  and could hear the fire roaring above. Up to the next flight Nobby ran
  knocking over the vases and things that the hall was decorated with.</p>

  <p>"He didn't know where the kids were, but he guessed it was on the top
  floor, because being the most dangerous place for children, that's where all
  nurseries are.</p>

  <p>"In the darkness he stumbled into a bath-room, and that was Nobby's
  salvation, for he had a minute to soak his tunic in water before be started
  to crawl up the next flight.</p>

  <p>"He shouted at the top of his voice&mdash;</p>

  <p>"'Is anybody there?'</p>

  <p>"The smoke and the heat didn't upset Nobby so much as hearing a voice say,
  'Yes,' for it was a voice Nobby knew.</p>

  <p>"'Hullo, Spud,' he sez in astonishment, and then remembering he wasn't on
  good terms with him, 'Hullo, hero,' he sez.</p>

  <p>"Spud's voice was choked with smoke.</p>

  <p>"'Help get these kids downstairs,' he sez, 'you tuppenny-ha'penny chicken
  thief.'</p>

  <p>"Nobby had a reply on the top of his tongue, but the smoke got into his
  throat, so he groped about for one of the children.</p>

  <p>"He found one little curly head, and lifted the child</p>

  <p>"'Come on, Spud,' he sez, but he made no answer.</p>

  <p>"'Spud!' called Nobby.</p>

  <p>"He heard Spud's voice.</p>

  <p>"'I'm done,' he sez weakly, 'get the kids out.'</p>

  <p>"Nobby found the other child, and went floundering downstairs with the
  two. He got outside, and laid the children on the grass. He heard people
  running, and knew that the fire had been discovered; then turned back into
  the house again. It was harder this time to get upstairs, but he managed it.
  The top floor was like an oven; the smoke was worse than ever. He shut his
  eyes tight and went feeling about the landing. By and by he found Spud, who
  had fallen into a corner.</p>

  <p>"'Spud!' he yells, but Spud didn't answer. He was too heavy to carry, but
  Nobby dragged him to the edge of the stairs and pushed him over, and Spud
  fell with a crash to the next landing.</p>

  <p>"It woke Spud up, but before Nobby could get any sense into him he was
  unconscious again, so Nobby repeated the performance.</p>

  <p>"Just then the firemen came in and got them both out.</p>

  <p>"Neither Spud nor Nobby was any the worse for the experience the next
  morning when they paraded at the orderly room.</p>

  <p>"Spud said he felt sore but Nobby said nothing.</p>

  <p>"Talk about heroes! The paper was full of it. The Colonel had Nobby and
  Spud up before him.</p>

  <p>"'I am very proud of you men,' sez the Colonel. 'I only regret that the
  regulations don't allow me to reward you,' he sez.</p>

  <p>"'I've had my reward,' sez Nobby; 'I'd go through it all over again for
  the pleasure of chucking Spud Murphy downstairs!'"</p>

  <h2><a id="story11"
     name="story11"></a>XI. &mdash; THE COMPETITORS</h2>

  <h3>No record of prior publication under this title found</h3>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p class="first">NOT the least pleasant characteristic of Smithy is his
  touching confidence in my omnipotence.</p>

  <p>Whenever he sees an article or story of mine in a paper or magazine, you
  may be sure that he addresses me as the "editor" of that particular
  production. Should by any chance a play or sketch with which I am remotely
  connected be in course of performance anywhere near Anchester, I know I shall
  receive peremptory demands for tickets, on the assumption that I own the
  theatre.</p>

  <p>When Smithy called in at Kensington a few weeks ago and talked vaguely
  about journalism and the ethics thereof, and made rambling and inconclusive
  references to the probity of the Press, I asked him to come to the point,
  and, with an apologetic preamble, he came.</p>

  <p>"I don't want you to give yourself away," began Smithy, alarmingly.
  "You've got to make your livin' as well as anybody else, an' it ain't for me
  to go pryin' into your business. But Spud Murphy said it's a swindle, an'
  Nobby said it ain't, an' lots of chaps take one side or the other, so I
  thought I'd come an' see you&mdash;you're the editor of <i>Ideas</i>, ain't
  you?</p>

  <p>I destroyed Smithy's illusion with a word, and his face fell.</p>

  <p>"I thought you was," he said reproachfully.</p>

  <p>"Well, anyway, you'll know what I want to find out: are limericks
  swindles?"</p>

  <p>I assured him that so far from that, limerick competitions were remarkably
  fair, and that the efforts of competitors received extraordinary careful
  scrutiny, and that the best lines won.</p>

  <p>"But do the people get it, or does some pal of the editor's get it?" asked
  Smithy, with brutal directness.</p>

  <p>"Why, you owl," I replied, "don't you realise that there are hundreds of
  disappointed people on the lookout for signs of favouritism, and that every
  winner's name and address is carefully verified and their family history
  inquired into by people who have got the same idea as you, and
  that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That's all right," said Smithy easily; "that's what <i>I</i> say, an'
  Nobby Clark sez, but we thought we'd inquire first, because a tanner's a lot
  of money to chuck away.</p>

  <p>He fished out from his pocket a paper, which he carefully unfolded,
  disclosing a newspaper coupon, which, borrowing the terminology of the
  second-hand bookseller, was " slightly soiled," and this, without preliminary
  and with due solemnity, he read&mdash;</p>

  <p>There was an old man of Torbay</p>

  <p>Who never had been to a play,</p>

  <p>So to Faust he was led,</p>

  <p>When he'd seen it he said,</p>

  <p align="center">. . . . . . . .</p>

  <p align="center"></p>

  <p>"Well?" said Smithy inquiringly, and I realised he wanted me to suggest a
  line.</p>

  <p>"Work in something about 'the devil to pay,' " I suggested....</p>

  <p>Smithy told me the sequel last Wednesday.</p>

  <p>"Nobby liked your line, the bit about the devil; so we got a line up, him
  an' me, an' sent it in.</p>

  <p>"All that week we talked about that tanner. Nobby remembered about two
  hundred ways we might have spent it. Then when the week came round for the
  prize to be announced Nobby said we ought to forget all about it, an' then it
  'ud come as a surprise. So we started tryin' to forget, an' the more we
  tried, the more we remembered.</p>

  <p>"I kept quiet about it for two days, but I was thinkin' all the time what
  we would do if we got a fiver an' though Nobby said nothin' I could tell it
  was on his mind.</p>

  <p>"On the second day he up, an' spoke.</p>

  <p>"'Look here, Smithy,' he sez, 'it's no good of us reckonin' on that
  limerick; we'll suppose we've lost.'</p>

  <p>"'Yes,' I sez.</p>

  <p>"'Well, it's all over then,' sez Nobby, pretendin, 'an' we ain't got a
  prize or nothin'.'</p>

  <p>"'That's right,' I sez, pretendin', too.</p>

  <p>"'Limericks is swindles,' sez Nobby, very loud.</p>

  <p>"'Daylight robbers,' I sez.</p>

  <p>"'No more limericks for me,' sez Nobby. 'I've lost once&mdash;never
  again.'</p>

  <p>"It got all over barracks that we'd lost, an' fellers who was waitin' to
  see if we won before they speculated themselves kept their money in their
  pocket an' said they knew limericks was swindles all along.</p>

  <p>"That night, when me an' Nobby was in the canteen, the postman poked his
  head in the door an' shouts, 'Clark!'</p>

  <p>"When Nobby went over to him he hands him a letter, an' Nobby looks at it
  an' turns pale.</p>

  <p>"I looks at it, an' I went cold all over, for on the back flap of the
  envelope was printed the name of the paper, I looks at Nobby, an' he looks at
  me.</p>

  <p>"'Let's feel that letter, Smithy.' So I gave it him</p>

  <p>"'It don't feel very thick,' he sez, p'raps it's a consolation prize.'</p>

  <p>"'Let's go up to the barrack-room,' sez Nobby. So up we went an' had a
  good look at the envelope. There It was right enough&mdash;</p>

  <p>Private Clark,</p>

  <p>B. Company,</p>

  <p>1st Anchester Regiment.</p>

  <p>"'Shall we open it?' I sez.</p>

  <p>"'No,' sez Nobby, 'not yet; get your belt on, an' we'll go down town.'</p>

  <p>"So we went out, an' walked down the High Street very solemn, Nobby with
  the letter in his inside pocket.</p>

  <p>"We was walkin' along quite quickly, when suddenly Nobby grabbed me by the
  arm an' pointed. Over the road was Ruggle's paper shop, an outside was the
  placard of the limerick paper, and on it was&mdash;</p>

  <p class="sign"><u>OUR LIMERICK</u><br>
  ANCHESTER SOLDIER<br>
  WINS 125 4s</p><br>

  <p>"I managed to drag Nobby into the <i>Phoenix Arms</i>.</p>

  <p>"'My pal's had a bit of a shock,' I sez to the young lady behind the bar.
  'Give me two penn'orth of brandy, miss.'</p>

  <p>"'Beer,' sez Nobby, openin' his eyes for a second.</p>

  <p>"I got him round after repeating the dose.</p>

  <p>"'It's not us,' he sez, sad; 'it ain't thick enough, an' besides, it ain't
  registered, an' besides, it ain't us.'</p>

  <p>"'Let's open it,' I sez, tremblin'.</p>

  <p>"'You open it,' sez Nobby.</p>

  <p>"'No, you,' I sez.</p>

  <p>"Nobby took his penknife an' opened it careful.</p>

  <p>"'I'll bet it ain't us,' he sez.</p>

  <p>"'I'll bet it ain't us.' I sez.</p>

  <p>"He opened the paper. There was a cheque, an' he read it. Then he sez in a
  far-away voice&mdash;</p>

  <p>"'Kick me, Smithy&mdash;where it hurts,' he sez.</p>

  <p>"So I kicked him.</p>

  <p>"'Now stick that knife in me,' he sez, ' not too far, but just enough to
  make me jump.'</p>

  <p>"So I did&mdash;an' he <i>did</i> jump.</p>

  <p>"'Miss,' sez Nobby to the young lady, in his dreamy voice, 'would you be
  to kind as to tell me what I look like?'</p>

  <p>"So she told him, an' that sort of woke Nobby up</p>

  <p>"'Thank you,' he sez gruffly; then, 'Smithy, its <i>us!</i>'</p>

  <p>"An' it was!</p>

  <p>"'Here, Miss,' sez Nobby, excited, 'will you ask the gaffer to step this
  way?' and the landlord, who's a gentleman, though stout, comes along.</p>

  <p>"'What's this?' sez Nobby, holdin' out the cheque. He kept hold of it
  tight, too.</p>

  <p>"'This,' sez the bung, 'why, this is a cheque for 125 4s.' he sez.</p>

  <p>"'Can you change it?' sez Nobby.</p>

  <p>"The landlord looks at Nobby very suspicious.</p>

  <p>"'No,' he sez, very short.</p>

  <p>."'Will you give me a hundred quid for it?' sez Nobby. You can keep the
  rest.'</p>

  <p>"'No,' sez the landlord again, an' then calls his potman an' whispers
  somethin' in his ear.</p>

  <p>"'You needn't send for the police,' sez Nobby; it's a limerick wot me an'
  my pal Smithy's won,' he sez.</p>

  <p>"We got out into the street.</p>

  <p>"'Let's walk about all night,' sez Nobby, an' make up what well do.' Nobby
  hadn't had a furlough, no more had I, so next mornin' we paraded before the
  adjutant.</p>

  <p>"When the adjutant sees me an' Nobby he sez&mdash;</p>

  <p>"'Hello, you're the two fellers that won the limerick prize, aren't
  you?'</p>

  <p>"'Yes,' sez me an' Nobby.</p>

  <p>"'Well, what are you gain' to do with the money?' sez the adjutant.</p>

  <p>"'Spend it,' sez Nobby.</p>

  <p>"'Don't you think you'd better save it for a rainy day?' sez the
  adjutant.</p>

  <p>"'No, sir!' sez Nobby, very firm. 'Smithy an' me are goin' up to London on
  urgent privit business,' he sez.</p>

  <p>"'Were goin' to do it in&mdash;in a manner of speakin',' he sez.</p>

  <p>"The adjutant looked a bit grave.</p>

  <p>"'That's darn' foolish,' he sez.</p>

  <p>"'Well, it's like this, sir,' sez Nobby, 'if we stay, in barracks we'll
  spend it anyway, an' get ourselves into trouble&mdash;to say nothin' of
  gettin' other chaps into trouble,' he sez, very earnest. 'So me an' Private
  Smith are goin' to London to see what it feels like bein' a
  millionaire&mdash;we shall never have another chance.'</p>

  <p>"The adjutant shook his head, but he gave us seven days' leave.</p>

  <p>"We got an empty carriage to ourselves, an' Nobby pulled out the
  money.</p>

  <p>"'There's sixty-two for you, an' sixty-two for me,' he sez, ' an' we'd
  better put the return halves of our tickets in our boots for safety&mdash;for
  we ain't likely to bring back much more than them!'"</p><br>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p class="first">"IT'S a wonderful thing," said Smithy, "how coming into
  money effec's some people. An uncle of mine lost his memory over a matter of
  two hundred pound. Couldn't remember people who'd done him kindnesses when he
  was hard up; couldn't remember money he'd borrowed orf my father an' couldn't
  pay back; couldn't call to mind hundreds of knowin' people who called on him
  to wish him luck. Another chap, whose gran'-mother left him a row of houses
  out Walworth way, used to be a Socialist. Always wore a red tie, an' used
  hair-oil. Used to carry a banner in a percession, 'Death to the capitalists,'
  'We demand more money an' less work,' and 'We demand the right to live.'</p>

  <p>"Soon after he come into his houses, a pal came to see him.</p>

  <p>"'Ain't seen you up at the club lately, Joe,' he sez.</p>

  <p>"'No,' sez Joe shortly.</p>

  <p>"'There was a fine argument the night,' sez the pal, 'between Jack
  Higgins, of Rotherhithe, an' Harry Wagg, of Poplar, on Moonicapel
  Lan'lordism.'</p>

  <p>"'Oh,' sez Joe, very cold.</p>

  <p>"'Yes,' sez the pal, 'an' we passed a resolution that nobody should pay
  rent.'</p>

  <p>"'Oh,' sez Joe, very indignant, 'well, that's not my idea of true
  Socialism,' he sez. 'That's what I call robbery, an' you can tell the
  secretary to scratch my name orf the club books.'</p>

  <p>"'But, Joe!' sez the pal.</p>

  <p>"'I'm afraid I can't argue with you,' sez Joe, very firm. 'Me motor-car's
  at the door, an' I've got to go to a meetin' of property-owners to protest
  against the new drainage bye-law. Then I've got to go to me solicitor. Them
  new tenants of mine are complainin' about the roof leakin'. They're a
  dissatisfied, ungrateful lot,' he sez; 'why, it was only last week I had
  their backyards whitewashed!'</p>

  <p>I must say about Nobby that, havin' sixty odd pounds in his pouch, didn't
  turn <i>his</i> head. All the way up to London we talked about what we'd
  do.</p>

  <p>"'The great thing,' sez Nobby, 'is not to drink anything till quite
  late&mdash;you can't enjoy yourself if you've got a skinful.'</p>

  <p>"The train pulled up outside London, an' people crowded into the carriage.
  There had been a race meetin', and all the chaps who got in was saying 'Did
  you ever see such ridin' in your life?' an' 'He ought to have won by the
  length of a street,' an' 'The jockey pulled his head orf,' an' 'I wish the
  White Prince had dropped dead,' an' similar light-hearted chatter.</p>

  <p>Then one feller in a big box coat an' buttons as big as saucers took his
  coat down orf the rack an' folded it on his knees.</p>

  <p>"'Gentlemen,' he sez, 'I've had a very good day, an' as I'm anxious to
  distribute me money for the good of the public, I will endeavour to show you
  a noo an' original game, invented by the Emp'ror of Germany, entitled, "Can
  you find the lady?" I have here in me hand three common or ordinary cards,
  the nine of di'monds, the six of clubs, an' the queen of spades.'</p>

  <p>"So he juggles 'em all over the coat, and lays them face down.</p>

  <p>' Now,' he sez ' I'll bet any sportsman a sov'reign he can't spot the
  lady.'</p>

  <p>"Before I could stop him, Nobby had a quid in his hand.</p>

  <p>"'Here you are,' he sez, an' picked out the queen.</p>

  <p>"Anybody can pick out the queen the first time the chap does it, an' me
  an' Nobby used to make a lot of money at Aldershot Races spottin' the
  three-card chaps, an' havin' the first penn'orth, so to speak.</p>

  <p>"The card chap paid over his quid. an' Nobby put it in his pocket.</p>

  <p>"'Now,' sez the card chap, shufflin' the three cards again, 'I'll bet you
  five pound you can't spot the lady.'</p>

  <p>"But Nobby didn't say anything.</p>

  <p>"'I'll bet you five pound to three pound you can't spot the lady,' sez the
  man to Nobby, but Nobby was lookin' out of the winder an' whistlin'
  thoughtful.</p>

  <p>"'Here&mdash;you!' sez the card chap, touchin' Nobby's knee, 'you're a
  sportsman, ain't you? You've won a quid of mine, now, I'll give you another
  chance.'</p>

  <p>"'I never gamble,' sez Nobby, solemn.</p>

  <p>"The card chap sort of choked in the throat.</p>

  <p>"'You&mdash;you,' he gasps, 'why, you won a quid of mine just now.'</p>

  <p>"'That wasn't gambling,' sez Nobby, that was a certainty.'</p>

  <p>"'D'ye mean to say you ain't goin' to try your luck again?' sez the card
  chap, very fierce.</p>

  <p>"'I do,' sez Nobby.</p>

  <p>"'Then gimme back my quid,' sez the card chap, with his eyes bulgin'
  out.</p>

  <p>"'I'll give you a push in the face,' sez Nobby, serious, ' if you ask me
  for money.'</p>

  <p>"The card chap nearly had a fit.</p>

  <p>"'Give the man his money,' sez one of his pals.</p>

  <p>"But there never was a man in the world who could get money out of Nobby
  once he got his pay-hooks on it, an' they argued an' argued all the way to
  London, but Nobby sez nothin', except to pass a few remarks about the card
  chap's face.</p>

  <p>"'I'll wait for you outside the station,' sez the cove.</p>

  <p>"'As near the amblance,' sez Nobby, 'as you can get, an' you'd better
  bring your own doctor.'</p>

  <p>"There was a quiet sort of feller satin' in the corner of the carriage,
  who kept quiet, an' after the card man found that Nobby was no go, he turned
  to the quiet man, an' offered to bet <i>him</i> that he couldn't find the
  lady. So the quiet man, bet an' lost, an' bet an' lost again, and that put
  the card chap in a better humour.</p>

  <p>"'It's men like you,' he sez to Nobby, 'that ruin sport&mdash;blooming
  poverty-struck soldier!'</p>

  <p>"'This gentleman is a sportsman,' sez the card feller, 'with a sportsman's
  'art an' a sportsman's feelin's.'</p>

  <p>"'I dessay,' sez Nobby, an' the quiet man grinned.</p>

  <p>"When we got to the station, where we was gettin' out, we found the door
  locked.</p>

  <p>"'Here,' sez one of the card chap's pals, 'who locked the door&mdash;it
  wasn't locked when we got in?'</p>

  <p>"'I did,' sez the quiet man, an' he beckoned a couple of coppers on the
  station. An' lo an' behold! the station was full of 'em.</p>

  <p>"'A little surprise for you gents,' sez the quiet man. 'There's a police
  officer in every carriage&mdash;I'm one myself&mdash;an' we're goin' to make
  a little haul to-night.'</p>

  <p>"When me an' Nobby was watchin' the fellers bein' marched away, Nobby
  sez&mdash;</p>

  <p>"'This comes of gamblin', Smithy&mdash;let this be a warnin' to you.'</p>

  <p>"'What about limericks?' I sez.</p>

  <p>"'That's not gamblin'&mdash;that's intellects.'</p>

  <p>"We had a long argument whether we should go to a real tip-top hotel or
  whether we should stay at the club.*</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* The Union Jack Club.]</p>

  <p>"Nobby knew a high-class hotel in Stamford Street, where you can't get a
  bed under a shillin' a night, an' some of 'em's two shillin's, so we went
  there. Then we walked down the Waterloo Road an' bought some civilian
  clothes, an' had 'em brought back to the hotel. Nobby chose 'em. He's got a
  rare taste, has Nobby. Yaller boots an' yaller kid gloves, straw hats, an' a
  white weskit for him, an' a white weskit for me. We got cuffs an' 'dickies,'
  because Nobby said it was a pity to waste money on shirts.</p>

  <p>"As we was comin' back, with a little boy carryin' the parcels behind,
  Nobby sez: 'Harf a tick,' an' dived into a second-hand jewel shop, where you
  can buy watches that nearly go, an' unredeemed pledges, an' that sort of
  thing. He come out again in a minute or so, an' we got back to the hotel.</p>

  <p>"What with the salmon an' green tie that Nobby had bought, an' the weskit,
  I looked a treat, an' I must say that Nobby looked a perfec' gentleman.</p>

  <p>"What worried me was the collar an' shirt front. I had to get a knife an'
  make holes for the studs, an' the way that dickey kept risin' up, first one
  side, an' then the other, was too cruel. I fastened it down with a pin, but
  that didn't make no difference. That only made it bulge up in front like a
  windersill.</p>

  <p>"But when I saw Nobby, his collar sat on his neck as though he'd been born
  in it, as neat an' reglar an' even as possible.</p>

  <p>"'How did you do it?' I sez,</p>

  <p>"'It's a patent of me own,' sez Nobby, very proud. an' started pullin' on
  his yaller gloves.</p>

  <p>"When we was ready to go out, Nobby sez&mdash;</p>

  <p>"'Hold hard, Smithy, catch hold of this,' and he pulled out an
  eyeglass.</p>

  <p>"'I've got two,' he sez, 'they've got little bits of wire to help you keep
  'em in your eye.'</p>

  <p>"'Which eye?' I sez.</p>

  <p>"'Any eye,' sez Nobby, very calm, it all depends on what eye it fits.' It
  took me nearly an hour to get the bloomin' thing to stick, an' only then when
  I shut the eye it was in.</p>

  <p>"We got two very fine meerschaum pipes for a shillin' each&mdash;you
  couldn't tell 'em from real ones&mdash;an' a couple of gold-mounted sticks
  for another two bob, an' we strolled into the Strand.</p>

  <p>"There must have been something very takin' about our appearance, because
  everybody we met turned round an' looked at us.</p>

  <p>"'How do we look?' sez Nobby.</p>

  <p>"'Fine,' I sez, and I'm bound to admit that I fancied meself a bit.</p>

  <p>"'If anybody asks you who you are,' sez Nobby 'you're Lord Smithy an' I'm
  Sir Nobby de Clark.'</p>

  <p>"'Certainly,' I sez.</p>

  <p>"We strolled up the Strand, an' saw lots of people waitin' outside a
  theatre.</p>

  <p>"'Let's go in,' sez Nobby, so we joined the crowd.</p>

  <p>"We had to wait a bit, an' nobody in the crowd took much notice of us,
  which annoyed Nobby. He can put on the hawhaw officer's voice very well, can
  Nobby, so he started.</p>

  <p>"'Lord Smithy,' he sez, very loud.</p>

  <p>"'Yes, Sir Nob,' I sez.</p>

  <p>"'Awfully tejus waitin', ain't it?' he sez, very bored.</p>

  <p>"A lot of the people looked round, an' that pleased Nobby.</p>

  <p>"'I wish we'd brought our own private box,' sez Nobby.</p>

  <p>"There was a chap with whiskers, who was readin' an evenin' newspaper, an'
  he looks up.</p>

  <p>"'If you don't want to wait, don't let us keep you,' he sez,
  sarcastic.</p>

  <p>"'What say?' sez Nobby.</p>

  <p>"'I say, if you don't want to wait, don't let us keep you,' sez
  whiskers.</p>

  <p>"'Who is this vulgar person?' sez Nobby.</p>

  <p>"'Never mind about that,' sez the whisker-feller, who was one of those
  chaps who's always lookin' out for a row.</p>

  <p>"'Smithy&mdash;I mean me lord,' sez Nobby, 'is this person with the
  creepers a friend of</p>

  <p>yours?'</p>

  <p>"'No, Sir Nob,' I sez.</p>

  <p>"'Then,' sez Nobby, very stern, 'all that I can say to him is, go home an'
  wash the cobwebs orf your face.'</p>

  <p>"The evenin' might have passed off very pleasantly, for we got very nice
  seats, an' there was a young lady on each side of Nobby, an' he was gettin'
  on splendid. Then a young feller leant over from the back row an' tapped
  Nobby on the shoulder.</p>

  <p>"'Do you mind changing seats? he sez.</p>

  <p>"'What for? ' sez Nobby.</p>

  <p>"'I want to sit by those young ladies,' sez the young feller.</p>

  <p>"'So do I,' sez Nobby, 'an' I admire your nerve.'</p>

  <p>"It appears that one was the young feller's financee, an' the other was
  his sister, an' the remarks that young chap passed when Nobby bought a big
  box of sweets between the acts for the financee, was somethin' shockin'.</p>

  <p>"When the second act started, an' all the lights went down, Nobby got on
  splendider than ever. So much to that the young feller got up and touched
  Nobby again.</p>

  <p>"'Are you goin' to give up that seat?' he sez, fierce, and very loud, an'
  everybody in the theatre sez: 'S-sh&mdash;turn him out&mdash;silence!'</p>

  <p>"'Because,' sez the young feller, gettin' hold of Nobby's collar, 'if you
  don't, I shall chuck you out!'</p>

  <p>"'Leave that collar alone,' sez Nobby, alarmed; 'it's new.'</p>

  <p>"In a second the fatal thing was done, an' Nobby's 'dickey' was stickin'
  out of the top of his weskit.</p>

  <p>"Nobby felt the disgrace horrible, an' after he'd hit the young chap once
  or twice an' a policeman an' a chucker-out had got Nobby outside by the
  pay-box, I managed to stick it in again for him.</p>

  <p>"'It's not bein' chucked out that I mind so much,' sez Nobby, very bitter,
  but I've got no shirt on under that dickey.'</p>

  <p>"'How did you fasten it down, then?' I sez.</p>

  <p>"'With two bits of stamp paper,' sez Nobby.</p><br>

  <h3>III</h3>

  <p class="first">"BEIN' in London with nothin' to do except to spend money,
  is very much like bein' on duty linin' the road for a royal percession," said
  Smithy. "There's thousands of people behind you, pushin' and shovin'. and
  peekin' up their heads trying to get a peep, and there's you in the front
  rank, with nothin' to do but to see all the sights an' you're wishin' all the
  time that you was away carryin' coal or doin' somethin' equally intellectual.
  Doin' anything you've got to do is the worst thing in the world next to not
  doin' something you <i>want</i> to do.</p>

  <p>"There used to be a chap in ours by the name of Hikey&mdash;so called
  because he was always givin' hisself airs&mdash;that used to play the flute
  like&mdash;like what-d'ye-call-him?&mdash;an' he used to be practisin' at
  that flute from mornin' to night. When other fellers was enjoyin' themselves
  at the wet-bar he used to be playin' 'The Last Rose of Summer' or 'Drink to
  me only with thine eyes.' He had a piece what he called the 'Moonlight
  Tomato' wot he used to play when he was on guard at the magazine, an' it got
  about that the post was 'aunted."</p>

  <p>"He 'ad another bit called 'The hark that once tarara's 'alls,' an' what
  that meant I <i>don't</i> know, but it used to make you want to
  cry&mdash;especially if you'd took a little drink.</p>

  <p>"Well, Hikey's playin' got round to the Colonel's ears, and the old man
  took him, excused him all drills an' put him into the band</p>

  <p>"'Let him practise as much as he likes,' sez the Colonel to he
  bandmaster&mdash;so in a manner of speakin' Hikey's life ought to have been
  one gran' sweet song, as the sayin' is. But what did Hikey do? As soon as he
  found he hadn't got to practise in his spare time, but 'ad as much time to
  play his flute as he wanted, he started moanin' an' groanin', an' talked
  about desertin'! Said it was a dog's life, an' he wished he was dead, an' he
  hadn't joined the army to be a bloomin' minstrel boy.</p>

  <p>"There was another feller by the name of 'Happy Johnson,' who used to
  spend all his time knittin' socks till he got married. One day there was an
  awful row at the married quarters, an' 'Happy ' got hauled up in front of the
  C.O. for creatin' a disturbance because his sock wasn't darned.</p>

  <p>"'Why didn't you darn 'em yourself?' sez the Commandin' Officer, who knew
  all about 'Happy.'</p>

  <p>"'Wot did she marry me for, sir?' sez 'Happy.'</p>

  <p>"'I don't know,' sez the Colonel, 'wasn't quite right in her head, I
  should say.'</p>

  <p>"When a man pays money to do hard work, it's an 'obby; but when he gets
  paid for it, it's jolly hard work.</p>

  <p>"Me an' Nobby thought there wouldn't be anything nicer in the world than
  bargin' about London, with our pockets full of gold, an' havin' nothin' to do
  but spend it.</p>

  <p>"'I'll bet,' sez Nobby, the second day when we was walkin' up the Strand,
  'that if me an' you wanted to buy that cab we could.'</p>

  <p>"So we went up to the cabby an' asked him what be wanted for the turn
  out.</p>

  <p>"The cabby looked suspicious, an' told us not to act the goat, but Nobby
  was so jolly earnest about it, that the cabby told him.</p>

  <p>"'There you are,' sez Nobby, an' we walked away leavin' the cabman quite
  upset.</p>

  <p>"After that we went into a shop an' asked the price of a di'mond tirara,
  because Nobby bet we could afford to buy it, if we wanted. Then we stood in
  front of a boot shop an' reckoned up that we could buy all the boots in the
  winder twice over. We got tired of this after a bit, because somehow we never
  saw anything we really did want to buy, except two framed texts in a little
  shop in the Charing Cross Road, an' they was only 4s. 6d. each.</p>

  <p>"We tried havin' expensive dinners. We had one wot cost nearly
  half-a-dollar, an' then we had a bottle of wine&mdash;very high-class wine it
  was, too, with three labels&mdash;and that cost us another eighteenpence. We
  had a glass apiece, an' then a bottle of beer to take the taste away.</p>

  <p>"'That's wine from the wood,' sez the waiter chap.</p>

  <p>"'I know,' sez Nobby. 'I could taste the wood quite plain.'</p>

  <p>"On the third day Nobby sez&mdash;</p>

  <p>"'Smithy, how much do you think we've spent?'</p>

  <p>"I knew how much I'd spent, an' told him.</p>

  <p>"'Less than a bloomin' quid,' sez Nobby, very bitter. 'Smithy, we oughtn't
  have money, we don't know how to spend it.'</p>

  <p>"That money got on our nerves. We tried hard to spend a parcel that day,
  we even rode in a taxicab, but the driver was struck honest or somethin', an'
  only charged the legal fare. We had a bit of grub in a Waterloo Road coffee
  shop, an' me an' Nobby was walkin' very gloomy towards the bridge when a
  little kid comes up an' sez&mdash;</p>

  <p>'' 'Give me a ha'penny, guv'nor.'</p>

  <p>"'What for?' sez Nobby, very fierce.</p>

  <p>"'To get somethin' to eat,' sez the kid.</p>

  <p>"'What do you want to eat for? ' sez Nobby, it'll only make you fat.'</p>

  <p>"The kid was slinkin' away, when Nobby called him back.</p>

  <p>"'Here's a tanner,' he sez, an' gave him sixpence.</p>

  <p>"'Don't make a beast of yourself,' sez Nobby, an' the kid grabbed the
  sixpence an' started runnin' away, when a bright idea struck Nobby.</p>

  <p>"'Here!' he sez, an' called the kid back again. This here little boy was a
  artful little chap wot thought Nobby was goin' to pinch the tanner back, but
  Nobby, who's got a wonderful way with wild animals, persuades him to come
  close.</p>

  <p>"'Me an' my friend,' sez Nobby, 'will be back in five minutes, so you go
  an' tell all the little boys an' girls wot want a tanner to buy grub with to
  come here an' get it.'</p>

  <p>"The little boy didn't believe Nobby, I could see that&mdash;but he nipped
  off, an' Nobby sez very solemn&mdash;</p>

  <p>"'Would you like to do the Lord Hallin'ton act?' sez Nobby.</p>

  <p>"Now I knew all about Lord Hallin'ton, because I'd read it in the papers.
  How he went round the poor parts of London givin' dinners to poor kids, so I
  sez&mdash;</p>

  <p>"'Rather.'</p>

  <p>"We went over to a bank an' we got nearly a hundred pounds in tanners.</p>

  <p>"My word, it was heavy! Me an' Nobby was bulgin' all over an' weighed
  down.</p>

  <p>"When we got back to where the kid left us there he was with a dozen other
  little kids.</p>

  <p>"Nobby gave 'em a tanner each, an' made 'em swear see-that-wet-see-that-dry that they'd lay it out in grub.</p>

  <p>"I don't know how the news got about, but by the time me and Nobby had
  walked into a side street there was about a hundred thousand kids round
  us.</p>

  <p>"They was yellin' an' shoutin' an' strugglin' to get at us, an' a stout
  old gentleman forced his way to Nobby an' asked him what the game was. So
  Nobby told him, an' the old gent larfed like anything.</p>

  <p>"'So that's the way a soldier spends his limerick money, is it?' he sez;
  'well, go ahead, an' I'll try to keep these youngsters in order.'</p>

  <p>"It wanted a bit of doin' an' I was afraid every minute that the p'lice
  would come up an' stop us. There was lots of loafers in the crowd, but Nobby
  landed one a dig in the eye, gave a few remarks to the others, and they left,
  but the tanners went like magic. It was a fine feelin' whilst it lasted, here
  was me and Nobby feedin' these kids&mdash;some of 'em come twice, but Nobby
  gave 'em a clump or two, an' that stopped <i>that</i>. At last every bloomin'
  tanner was gone (an' it took a bit of time to persuade 'em it <i>was</i>
  gone), an' Nobby sez&mdash;</p>

  <p>"'I didn't think there were so many kids in the world.'</p>

  <p>"The fat old gentleman larfed, an' asked me an' Nobby our names, then he
  shook hands an' went away.</p>

  <p>"By the time we'd paid our bill at the hotel and got to the station we had
  about a quid each left.</p>

  <p>"All the fellers in barracks were surprised to see us.</p>

  <p>"'Hullo,' sez Spud Murphy, 'spent all your money already?'</p>

  <p>"'Yes,' sez Nobby.</p>

  <p>"'How?' sez Spud.</p>

  <p>"'Drink an' riotchus livin',' sez Nobby.</p>

  <p>"'Did you drink much?' sez Spud.</p>

  <p>"'We haven't been sober for three days&mdash;have we, Smithy?'</p>

  <p>"'No,' I sez.</p>

  <p>"Spud looked at us very admirin', an' the chaps in the canteen gave us a
  bit of a reception.</p>

  <p>"It was well known in barracks we was back, an' fellers come from all
  parts&mdash;even from the corporals' room&mdash;to know what we did with the
  money.</p>

  <p>"So Nobby made up a most disgraceful tale, wot I won't insult you by
  repeatin', of our carryin's on, an' sat up in bed after lights-out tellin'
  how we went to parties with dukes an' earls, till the room corporal said if
  he didn't stop gassin' he'd put him inside.'</p>

  <p>"Next mornin', when me an' Nobby was waitin. at the cook-house to draw the
  coffee, Nobby sez&mdash;</p>

  <p>"'Smithy, are you sorry you spent that money?'</p>

  <p>"'No,' I sez, an' I wasn't.</p>

  <p>"'Do you ever want any more?'</p>

  <p>"'No,' I sez.</p>

  <p>"'Nor me, either,' sez Nobby, 'no more limericks for me.'</p>

  <p>"When we got in to breakfast there was a letter waitin' for us. I opened
  it.</p>

  <p>"'Dear sirs,' sez the letter, 'yesterday I had pleasure in witnessing your
  charity; as you were doing my work, permit me to recompense you.'</p>

  <p>"It was signed 'Hallington.'</p>

  <p>"'The little fat man!' sez Nobby, with a gasp. 'What's he sent?'</p>

  <p>"I opened the cheque ; it was for a hundred pounds!</p>

  <p>"'Smithy,' sez Nobby, shakin' his head, 'we'll never get rid of that
  money! Let's stick to it till flat racin' starts&mdash;then I know a way to
  make it go!'"</p>

  <h3>No record of prior publication under this title found</h3>

  <p class="first">"NOBBY CLARK," explained Private Smith, "has got an uncle
  who's fairly good. He keeps a ham and beef shop in Lewisham High Road, and
  naturally, being a bit well off, can afford to be eccentric.</p>

  <p>"He's a very fine old chap," said Smithy warmly. "If he gets a side of
  bacon that's gone off, or a tub of butter a bit high, do you think he throws
  it away? Not he. He gives it to the pore."</p>

  <p>Smithy glowed.</p>

  <p>"He sends Nobby lots of letters of advice and tracks, and sometimes he
  slips in half a dollar in stamps. Nobby is always anxious to get his uncle's
  letters, but I've known him to have a slice of bad luck for six letters
  runnin'.</p>

  <p>"One mornin' the postman brought a fat letter in. 'Private Clark,' he sez,
  and Nobby nipped along the barrack-room, but his face fell when he saw how
  fat the letter was.</p>

  <p>"'It's a bit too heavy to be any good,' he sez very bitter, and weighin'
  the letter in his hand; 'if this is another Straight Talk to Enquirin'
  Sinners, Smithy, something will 'ave to be done.' He tore open the letter
  very careful an' took out a printed paper. 'Track.' he sez bitterly, 'a track
  about drinkin' an' quarrelin'.'</p>

  <p>"Then be took out another paper.</p>

  <p>"'Track,' he sez bitterer than ever, 'a track about smokin'.'</p>

  <p>"Then he took out another paper.</p>

  <p>"'Tra&mdash;' he stopped, 'no it ain't&mdash;here. Smithy, what's this?'
  Nobby was all of a tremble, an' so was I, for if it wasn't a fiver, a real
  white crinkly fiver, I've never seen one.</p>

  <p>"Nobby was quite shook up an' so was I.</p>

  <p>"'Smithy,' sez Nobby, his voice all broke, 'pick up them beautiful tracks
  that my dear Uncle Joe sent me.'</p>

  <p>"'I can't, Nobby,' I sez, 'you chucked 'em on the fire.'</p>

  <p>"'Did I&mdash;did I?' sez Nobby, horror-struck, 'did I throw away my dear
  uncle's tracks&mdash;did I burn them lovely words&mdash;oh, horror!'</p>

  <p>"Then one of the fellers chipped in.</p>

  <p>"'Spud Murphy's got the one about drink; 'e picked it out of the
  fireplace, Nobby,' he sez.</p>

  <p>"Nobby stood lookin' at the banknote, crinklin' it an' looking at the
  watermark.</p>

  <p>"'Spud Murphy's got no right to my dear uncle's track&mdash;but he's
  welcome to it. I only 'ope,' Nobby went on very solemn, 'that the words in
  that there track will do him good.'</p>

  <p>"There was a letter along with the other goods, and Nobby read it.</p>

  <p>"'My dear nephew,' read Nobby. 'This comes hopin' to find
  you&mdash;um&mdash;um&mdash;um. I am glad to hear you go regularly
  to&mdash;um&mdash;um, but am sorry to hear you are ashamed to go to the
  meetin's because you've got no money to put in the plate.... Can quite
  understand it.... I don't see why you should wait till I die before getting
  some of my money, so as a reward... I am sendin' you ten pounds.'</p>

  <p>"'What,' I sez, an' Nobby read it again. 'Ten pound,' he sez, an' pulled
  the banknote out of his pocket to examine it. It was 'Five' right enough as
  plain as plain. 'I promise to pay,' etc.</p>

  <p>"'Dear uncle's made a mistake,' sez Nobby, all trembly, or else the other
  five is comin' on.' He turned the envelope inside out, but there was nothin'
  in it.</p>

  <p>"'Go on with the letter,' I sez.</p>

  <p>"'... Ten pounds,' read Nobby slowly, but certain persons havin' said that
  you don't read my little tracks&mdash;' Nobby stopped and went white.</p>

  <p>"'Go on,' I sez.</p>

  <p>"'Certain persons havin' said you don't read my tracks nor my letters
  either,

I&mdash;have&mdash;put&mdash;the&mdash;other&mdash;five&mdash;pound&mdash;'</p>

  <p>"Nobby sort of collapsed on to the nearest bed-cot.</p>

  <p>"'Where?' I sez.</p>

  <p>"'Between the last two pages of the track on drink an' quarrelin',' he
  sez, in a holler voice.</p>

  <p>"I tell you," said Smithy seriously, "it shook me an' Nobby up a bit, but
  bimeby Nobby pulls hisself together and jumps up. 'Smithy,' he sez, 'that low
  feller Spud has got my dear uncle's track wot he sent to me&mdash;I want to
  read that track; it'll do me more good than Spud. Where is he?'</p>

  <p>"Then somebody said he'd seen Spud going over to the canteen, so me an'
  Nobby run as hard as we could to find him.</p>

  <p>"Sure enough there he was, but our 'earts went down into our number nines
  when we saw him&mdash;he was sittin' by hisself drinking lemonade and looked
  very sad.</p>

  <p>"'Cheer-o, Spud,' sez Nobby, in a chokin' voice. 'How goes it? What are
  you drinkin'?'</p>

  <p>"Spud shook his head sorrerfully.</p>

  <p>"'I've given up the cursed drink,' he sez, in a humble voice.</p>

  <p>"'Since when?' sez Nobby, very loud. 'Since when, you low hypocrite?'</p>

  <p>"Spud didn't take no offence. He only sighed.</p>

  <p>"'Since reading your dear Uncle Joe's track,' he sez.</p>

  <p>"'Spud,' sez Nobby, droppin' his voice an' shakin' Spud by the hand,
  'Spud, you make me feel ashamed of meself. Perhaps I ought to give it up,
  too; perhaps them beautiful words might be the makin' of me; let's have a
  look at my uncle's track wot I lent you.'</p>

  <p>"'Wot you chucked away,' sez Spud, very gentle.</p>

  <p>"'Wot happened to slip out of my hand an' was picked up by a low thief who
  happened to be passin',' sez Nobby, very ferocious, but managed to get
  hisself under control again; 'so, therefore, dear Spud, let me have a
  <i>dekko</i> at them lovely words.'</p>

  <p>"'I haven't quite finished with it yet,' sez Spud, sippin' his lemonade
  and smacking his lips. This is the stuff to drink, Nobby. If I'd read your
  uncle's track earlier I might have been pounds in pocket.'</p>

  <p>''I thought Nobby would have a fit. He got red in the face an' he gnashed
  his teeth.</p>

  <p>"'Spud,' he sez, after a bit, 'Spud, old feller, are you goin' to see a
  comrade continue on what I might call the down grade without raisin' a hand
  to help him? And any way,' he went on, gettin' wilder and wilder, 'it's my
  bloomin' track; it was sent to me by my dear Uncle Joe, an' if you don't hand
  it over, I'll give you a wipe on the jaw.'</p>

  <p>"All the fellers in the canteen began to gather round on the off chance of
  a fight.</p>

  <p>"'Wot's up, Nobby?' sez Fatty Green, a very nice young feller with a curly
  head.</p>

  <p>"'This perishing recruit's got a track of mine,' roars Nobby, pullin' off
  his coat, 'a beautiful track about drinkin' an' quarrellin', an' won't hand
  it over, so I'm goin' to knock his head off.'</p>

  <p>"'Give the man his track,' sez Fatty, who was an off-an'-on teetotaller,
  an' all the other fellers said the same.</p>

  <p>"Things looked a bit rough-housish when suddenly the bugle sounded orf for
  'orderly men,' an' Nobby staggered back.</p>

  <p>"'That's me,' he sez, an' I felt sorry for him. In a manner of speakin' he
  was tore between love an' duty, as the song sez.</p>

  <p>"'Smithy,' he whispers to me, 'I've got to go and draw the groceries; keep
  your eye on this blighter an' don't let him out of your sight.'</p>

  <p>"When Nobby had gone I sez to Spud&mdash;</p>

  <p>"'Spud, me lad&mdash;I want a few words with you.'</p>

  <p>"'Ave 'em here,' sez Spud, sippin' his lemonade, but I took his arm an'
  walked him down to the back field, where there was nobody about.</p>

  <p>"'Spud,' I sez kindly, hand over Nobby's uncle's track.'</p>

  <p>"'For why?' sez Spud, looking round for some one to take his part.</p>

  <p>"'If you ain't enough of a gentleman to understand that when a feller gets
  a private track from his uncle he don't want nobody else to read it, I can't
  explain,' I sez. Just then Nobby came runnin' back from the parade ground,
  'avin' got another feller to draw the groceries.</p>

  <p>"'Come on,' he sez, an' so we gave Spud a number two jujitsu push.</p>

  <p>"'You hold his legs, Smithy,' sez Nobby, who was sittin' on Spud's head;
  'now, you mouldy highway robber, where's that track?'</p>

  <p>"'Lemme get up,' sez Spud, strugglin', but Nobby went carefully through
  his pockets.</p>

  <p>"'Here it is,' he yells, an' pulls out the paper. Sure enough, snug
  between the last two leaves was the other fiver.</p>

  <p>"'I'll report this,' sez Spud, when we let him up.</p>

  <p>"'Do,' sez Nobby, very cheerful, 'do.'"</p>

     name="story13"></a>XIII. &mdash; THE BAA-LAMB</h2>

  <h3>Published as "Smithy and the Baa-Lamb" in <i>Ideas</i>, Hulton &amp; Co.,
  London, Feb 1, 1908</h3>

  <p class="first">THE Army is a queer place, and soldiers really do
  extraordinary things. Once there was a martinet colonel of the Anchester
  Regiment who was known at the War Office as a "strong man," and once or twice
  his portrait crept into the pages of illustrated papers. As a matter of fact,
  he was not a strong man at all, but a bullying, brow-beating, terrorising
  weakling, with a taste for whisky and bridge. Also he was a bad loser, and
  collected postage stamps. And if that description isn't enough to damn any
  man, I should like to know what is.</p>

  <p>When the general came round on his annual inspection he remarked that
  there was a great deal of crime in the regiment, and the colonel spoke
  vaguely of discipline and the standard of recruiting, and after that the
  inspection was more "military" than ever.</p>

  <p>The colonel used to live out of barracks, and one guest night he was
  driving to mess along a dark country road, and his horse took a tumble, and
  the colonel picked himself out of the road with a broken head and his
  features fairly well displaced. Then he discovered a fine wire stretched
  across the road, and knew that it constituted the regiment's vote of
  censure.</p>

  <p>A few days later, as he was sitting at dinner, a heavy flint stone crashed
  through the window and all but brained him. So the colonel took the hint and
  went on half pay. During the war, the supply of "strong men" having run
  short, owing to the lamentable miscalculation which led them to match their
  strength against big, fat kopjes, the War Office sent for the colonel, and
  made him first a brigadier-general, then a local major-general. They gave him
  a brigade, which, to his&mdash;and its&mdash;intense annoyance, included the
  Anchester Regiment.</p>

  <p>The general had many narrow escapes from death before he returned to
  England, "on account of ill-health," and he now lives near Farnborough, and
  spends his days explaining why the Boers cut him up at Veltfontein, capturing
  his two pompoms and decimal nine-nine-nine of his convoy. His friends call
  him "Mad Jack," and he rather likes the nickname, because there has grown
  about the title a legend of recklessness in danger which he does not object
  to at all. As a matter of fact, his madness took the form of losing his head
  on the slightest provocation and calling for help in a loud voice.</p>

  <p>I am particularly concerned with this retired general, because he writes a
  great deal to the newspapers, nowadays, demanding that the Great General
  should be recalled from Babuland to "sweep the something stables of our
  rotten War Office, and reduce order from the chaos, etc."</p>

  <p>Now this is not a bad wheeze at all. For once upon a time, before the
  Great General went to Babuland, an obscure captain of infantry wrote ecstatic
  letters to the newspapers of that delightful country, acclaiming the Great
  General as the greatest kind of Great General that ever was. And when the
  Great General arrived he sought out the obscure captain of infantry and made
  him a colonel on the staff, which everybody in Babuland knows, and talks
  about.</p>

  <p>Now Smithy&mdash;Private Smith, as ever is&mdash;of the aforesaid
  Anchester Regiment, and I have had many earnest talks about the Army and the
  War Office and Mr. Haldane; and when we have been in any kind of doubt we
  have summoned to our council Private Clark, whose other name is Nobby.</p>

  <p>"The Army <i>is</i> a queer place, and soldiers do funny things," said
  Smithy, shaking his head wisely. "You take the ordinary soldier an' start
  talkin' music-hall-soldier talk to him, an' likely as not he'll dot you one.
  A soldier hates bein' called a hero&mdash;when he's sober&mdash;an' fellers I
  know would go miles out of their way sooner than hear some fat-headed
  civilian talkin' about the dear old flag. Chaps mostly enlist because they're
  hard up, as everybody knows. Some chaps enlist because they have a row with
  their people.</p>

  <p>"'When are you goin' to do some work, Bob?' sez the old man.</p>

  <p>"'Next week,' sez Bob.</p>

  <p>"'So you said this time last year,' sez the old man, an' if you think it's
  goin' to keep you through another flat racin' season, you're mistook.'</p>

  <p>"With that Bob gets despondent.</p>

  <p>"'I can't get no work,' he sez, very bitterly. 'I've been sittin' in front
  of the fire for the last week schemin' and thinkin' an' plannin', an' that's
  all the thanks I get!'</p>

  <p>"'Why don't you go out and look for it,' sez the old man, at five in the
  mornin'&mdash;same as me?'</p>

  <p>"'What!' sez Bob, very indignant, 'me go out in the mornin', riskin'
  double pneumatics, an' all! I'm ashamed of you father.'</p>

  <p>"'I do it,' sez the old man.</p>

  <p>"'You're older,' sez Bob, 'an' in a manner of speakin' 'ardened. I don't
  know what I'll do! I've a good mind to commit suicide!'</p>

  <p>"'Why don't you go for a soldier?' sez the father, 'it's a nice lazy
  life&mdash;just suit you!'</p>

  <p>"That sets the chap thinkin', an' before a week's past he's took the oath
  to serve his Majesty the King, 'is heirs, an' successors, an' the generals
  an' officers set over him, so help me, etcetra.</p>

  <p>"His mother cries, an' sez he's disgraced the family, an' all his sisters
  start yappin', an' his little brother asks him to bring him home a sword or
  two, an' the old man breathes in a light-hearted way, an' sez that doin'
  nothing for seven years'll make a man of him.</p>

  <p>"Pore feller! When he gets to the depot, an' is kicked out of bed at 5
  a.m., an' made to clean hisself an' turn out on a square that ain't been
  properly warmed, he wakes up out of his trance.</p>

  <p>"There's only two chaps I know that ever come into the army for glory, an'
  one was off his head an' the other was Conky Barlam. We used to call him
  'Baa-Lamb,' owin' to his simple ways. He was, indeed, the simplest feller
  I've ever clapped eyes on. A perfec' child he was, an' always talkie about
  the 'dear ole regiment,' an' the 'glorious Anchesters,' an' was one of them
  chaps that's always energetic in doin' the wrong thing. Made up a song he
  did, an' the first verse went</p>

  <p>The noblest regiment on this earth</p>

  <p>That's always makin' stirs,</p>

  <p>It is that corps of stirlin' worth</p>

  <p>What's called the Anchesters.</p>

  <p>"He used to volunteer for duty&mdash;would have gone on guard seven days a
  week if they'd let him&mdash;an' actually paraded before the colonel an'
  asked if he could see the reg'mental relics!</p>

  <p>"We've got a lot&mdash;what with flags we've taken, an' stuff we've looted
  in various wars, an' the officers' mess is full of diamond-hilted swords an'
  gold saucepans, an' things that our illustrious officers have pinched from
  the hateful foe from time to time.</p>

  <p>"The colonel was very pleased at Baa-Lamb's sauce, for the officers are as
  proud as Punch of the trophies, an' he actually took Baa-Lamb round an'
  showed him everything hisself!</p>

  <p>"I was at the orderly room an' heard the colonel tell the adjutant.</p>

  <p>"'By the way, Umfreville, that new recruit of "B" Company&mdash;Barlam's
  his name, I think&mdash;is a singularly intelligent feller. Took a tremendous
  interest&mdash;an intelligent interest&mdash;in the trophies&mdash;his father
  was a collector in a small way, an' the boy seems to have a fair idea of the
  value of our things.'</p>

  <p>"'Yes, sir,' sez the adjutant, who don't hold with soldiers knowin' a
  'fair knowledge' of anything, except marchin' an' shootin'.</p>

  <p>"Old Baa-Lamb was fair cracked about the flags, an' the swords an' the
  relics gen'rally.</p>

  <p>"'It made my heart swell,' he sez, 'to see them glorious trophies of many
  a stricken field,' he sez, where our noble officers have gone forth to
  victory or death,' he sez, 'or both. It makes my heart swell,' he sez, 'to
  see how them brave fellers have stormed palaces an' always,' he sez, 'gone
  straight to the place where the expensive loot was. It makes my heart
  swell&mdash;'</p>

  <p>"'Dry up,' sez Nobby, or I'll make your eye swell!'</p>

  <p>"'But think of them noble fellers,' sez Baa-Lamb, excited, 'amidst cannon
  roar an' flyin' shot&mdash;'</p>

  <p>"'Get out!' sez Nobby, very disgusted.</p>

  <p>"What pleased Baa-Lamb best was when he found a rhyme for 'di'mond-hilted
  sword,' an' wrote a little poem about it.</p><br>

  <p class="verse"
     style="margin-left:38%">Our officers, they bravely led<br>
  The privates through the breach,<br>
  An' found the enemy had fled<br>
  Out of their lawful reach.<br>
  Ah! many a high an' stilted lord<br>
  That day exclaimed, 'Great Scot!<br>
  I've lost my di'mond-hilted sword<br>
  An' golden mustard pot!'</p><br>

  <p>"You must understand that we sort of put up with Baa-Lamb because he was
  such a simple josser an' very kind-hearted. So when one mornin' me an' Nobby
  woke up an' found him missin' an' his bed not been slept in, we felt sorry
  for him, for the colonel's awfully down on chaps who overstay their leave,
  an' the night before old Baa-Lamb had gone out into town to meet his 'dear
  uncle' what had come down from London to see him.</p>

  <p>"As a matter of fact, we didn't feel sorry very long, because it was soon
  all over barracks that Baa-Lamb had gone for good&mdash;an' so had the
  di'mond-hilted sword an' several other valuables wot he'd written poems
  about"</p>

  <h2><a id="story14"
     name="story14"></a>XIV. &mdash; NOBBY'S DOUBLE</h2>

  <h3>Published in <i>Ideas</i>, Hulton &amp; Co., London, Nov 28, 1907</h3>

  <p class="first">"YOU might say that soldiers have got most of the vices,"
  said Private Smith, "because they're ordinary men. Most fellers have got a
  large whack of vice concealed about 'em, it don't matter what they are, I
  once knew a school-board officer who went round the country on his holiday as
  'Old Bill Maggit of Bermondsey' what would fight anybody at twelve stone, an'
  I knew a quiet young feller who always put on a clean white shirt every
  Sunday, who's now doin' five years for robbery an' violence. We're all bad,
  but most of us are afraid of the police. When you find a chap who don't give
  two pennorth of sugar for the biggest copper that ever told a lie, you can
  bet he's going to be a criminal, because he don't possess the only thing what
  keep, people honest&mdash;and that's the fear of bein' found out.</p>

  <p>"But whatever you say about soldiers, you can't say they bet. They play
  banker, an' nap, an fives,' an' pontoon,* an' lose fab'lous sums. But they
  don't bet, except very rarely. When they do happen to bet, it's a bad thing
  for the bookie. Close by Anchester there's a racin' stable, and from what me
  an' Nobby heard, there was a horse in that stable by the name of Mutton Pie
  what couldn't lose the Manchester Handicap.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[* Vingt-et-un (blackjack).]</p>

  <p>"One of the stable lads was down at the canteen last Sunday an' said that
  Mutton Pie would be passin' the winnin' post when the other horses were
  scratchin' their heads an' wonderin' where he'd gone. Everybody in Anchester
  was on Mutton Pie, an' a lot of chaps in the regiment, too. Me an' Nobby was
  on to the extent of five bob each way.</p>

  <p>"What made us fancy him so much was his intelligence. He was in a race
  once at Hurst Park; there was only four runners, an' every one of the others
  could beat him. So what did the noble horse do? Why, when he was at the
  startin' post he up an' kicks the favourite in the ribs. Then he kicked the
  jockey off the second favourite. That brought the field down to two, an' the
  other one would have won, only just before they got to the winnin' post
  Mutton Pie stretched his head round an' bit the other horse's ear off. So
  Mutton Pie won by a head an a bit of an ear he had in his mouth.</p>

  <p>"'That's the horse for me,' sez Nobby, 'he'll win, if he ain't poisoned
  before the day.'</p>

  <p>"The day before the race there was great excitement in barracks. That
  afternoon, when we were listening to a chap in 'H,' who was tellin' us that
  Mutton Pie hadn't got an earthly, an' that Jubilee was chucked into the race,
  the adjutant's orderly came in an' said that the adjutant wanted to see
  me.</p>

  <p>"'Me?' I sez, astonished.</p>

  <p>"'You,' sez the orderly, 'and look nippy.'</p>

  <p>So I doubled across to the orderly room.</p>

  <p>"'Ah, Smith,' sez the adjutant, I want you to do something for me.'</p>

  <p>"'Yes, sir,' I sez, wonderin' what was in the wind.</p>

  <p>"'There's a boy joinin' the regiment, the son of the late Sergeant-Major
  Stevens.'</p>

  <p>"'Yes, sir,' I sez.</p>

  <p>"'The boy's got a stepfather, an anarchist or socialist, or something, who
  doesn't want the boy to join.'</p>

  <p>"He waited a bit, an' I waited a bit.</p>

  <p>"'Well,' he sez, carelessly, 'if you an' your friend Clark should run
  across this man&mdash;he's an awful brute from what I hear&mdash;I want you
  to treat him kindly.'</p>

  <p>"'Yes, sir,' I sez, 'I will, sir.'</p>

  <p>"'Don't hurt him,' he sez.</p>

  <p>"'No, sir,' I sez.</p>

  <p>"He looks hard at me.</p>

  <p>"'Do you understand?' he sez, and winks just like that.</p>

  <p>"'I wasn't long givin' Nobby the office. Afterwards we went up to the room
  to tea, an' we was half-way through when there was a knock at the door.
  Nobody knocks at a barrack-room door, so we knew it was a civilian.</p>

  <p>"'Come in,' everybody shouted at once.</p>

  <p>"The door opens, an' in walked the finest kind of blighter you've ever
  seen in your natural. He wore a big black hat an' a red necktie, with egg
  marks. His hair was long, an' his face was one of them oily faces that always
  shines. He looks round the room an' sniffs.</p>

  <p>"'Do you want anybody?' sez Nobby, very polite.</p>

  <p>"He sniffs again.</p>

  <p>"'Or a handkerchief ? ' sez Nobby.</p>

  <p>"The oily chap didn't take any notice of what Nobby said.</p>

  <p>"'So this,' he sez, 'is a barrack-room. An' these are the licensed butchers
  what the likes of me pay taxes for.'</p>

  <p>"'The butcher's out just now,' sez Nobby, 'owin' to his havin' an
  appointment down town to meet a girl.'</p>

  <p>"The oily chap looks at Nobby very scornful.</p>

  <p>"'Come here, my man,' he sez haughtily.</p>

  <p>"Nobby walks up to him.</p>

  <p>"'Do you know who I am?' he sez.</p>

  <p>"'Do I get a prize for guessin'?' sez Nobby.</p>

  <p>"'I'm one of your masters,' sez the oily chap,</p>

  <p>"'Go on,' sez Nobby.</p>

  <p>"'I keeps you,' sez the chap.</p>

  <p>"'Who keeps you?' sez Nobby.</p>

  <p>"'The sweat of me brow,' sez the chap.</p>

  <p>"Nobby looks at his oily dial.</p>

  <p>"'Well you ought to be well off,' sez Nobby.</p>

  <p>"The chap looked very fiercely at Nobby.</p>

  <p>"'I'll have you understand,' he began, when in walked a kid.</p>

  <p>"He was one of the nicest little kids you ever saw, with yallar hair an'
  eyes like china saucers.</p>

  <p>"'Ha,' sez the oily chap, jumpin' forward an' catchin' the kid by the arm.
  'You're the boy I'm lookin' for.'</p>

  <p>"'Hold on,' I sez, what's the game?'</p>

  <p>"The oily chap turned on me with a haughty look.</p>

  <p>"'Don't interfere,' he sez, 'this boy's my son, an' was goin' to disgrace
  hisself by joinin' the army.'</p>

  <p>"The boy was strugglin' to get his arm away.</p>

  <p>"'Wait a bit,' sez Nobby, 'look after the door Smithy. Before we go any
  further, Face, I would like to ask you a civil question.'</p>

  <p>"'What's that?' sez the oily chap.</p>

  <p>"'It's this,' sez Nobby slowly. Would you prefer goin' out of this room by
  the door, or would you prefer to be chucked out of the winder&mdash;there's
  only two ways?"</p>

  <p>"'What d'ye mean?' sez the oily chap, lookin' scared.</p>

  <p>"'Years an' years ago,' sez Nobby, 'I was kidnapped by gipsies because of
  me good looks&mdash;did you make any remark ?'</p>

  <p>"'No' sez the oily chap.</p>

  <p>"'It's a good job for you you didn't,' sez Nobby, 'the chap what kidnapped
  me had a face like yours, only not so bad, an I promised me Uncle Bill when
  be died, that if ever I met you I'd do you in.'</p>

  <p>"' "Nobby," sez my Uncle Bill, "don't hurt the poor feller." "I won't,
  uncle,!" I sez. "Let his end be painless" "It shall, Uncle Bill," I sez.
  "Don't do it with an hammer, but just drop him gently out of a winder," sez
  my Uncle Bill, an' that's what I'm goin' to do,' sez Nobby.</p>

  <p>"'You'll get into trouble for this threat, me man,' sez the oily chap, who
  was frightened to death.</p>

  <p>"'I know I will,' sez Nobby sadly. 'A fortune-teller told me so. "You'll
  be charged with murder," she sez, "but you'll get off as soon as the jury has
  seen a photo of the feller you've killed."'</p>

  <p>"I don't know how long this sort of thing would have gone on, but we heard
  a sword clinking in the passage outside, an' stood to attention as Captain
  Umfreville, the adjutant, came into the barrack-room He looked at the kid an'
  looked at the oily chap.</p>

  <p>"'What's wrong?' he sez.</p>

  <p>"'This&mdash;this scoundrel,' splutters the oily chap, pointin' to Nobby,
  'has dared to threaten me! By heavens, sir, I'll have the law on
  you&mdash;'</p>

  <p>"'Me?' sez Nobby, astonished. 'What for?'</p>

  <p>"'Didn't you say&mdash;?</p>

  <p>"'If I've opened me mouth,' sez Nobby in a shocked voice, 'except to pass
  the time of day, may I be blowed.'</p>

  <p>"'What are you doing with that boy?' sez the adjutant.</p>

  <p>"'My son,' sez the oily chap,</p>

  <p>"'Your stepson,' sez the officer.</p>

  <p>"'What's it to do with you?' sez the oily chap with a snort. 'Am I a free
  citizen to be talked to by a gilded nincompoop?'</p>

  <p>"'I'm neither a nincompoop, nor am I particularly gilded,' sez the
  adjutant quietly, 'and if you cannot behave yourself, I will have you put
  outside. Again I ask you what you are doing with that boy?'</p>

  <p>"'I'm taking him home,' sez the oily bird. 'I know the law as well as you,
  Mr. Blooming officer, and the law sez I can take him.'</p>

  <p>"By the look in Umfreville's face I could see Greasy knew what he was
  talkin' about.</p>

  <p>"'Very good,' sez the officer, 'you may take him.'</p>

  <p>"'What, sir,' sez Nobby, 'are you goin' to allow a lobster like
  that&mdash;'</p>

  <p>"'Be quiet, Clark,' sez the officer, ' you can take the boy,
  Mr.&mdash;'</p>

  <p>"'Snieff,' sez the oily chap.</p>

  <p>"'You may take the boy, Mr. Snieff, after I have made a few inquiries; in
  the meantime you may remain here if you wish.'</p>

  <p>"'I'm not goin' to leave this den of iniquity till I leave with this young
  varmint,' sez Snieff.</p>

  <p>"'Unless you can produce very excellent reasons why it should not be so,
  the boy will be sworn in tomorrow,' sez the captain.</p>

  <p>"'Don't you worry,' sez Snieff, 'I'll produce reasons, an', what's more,
  I'll be there to see 'em enforced.' An' when the officer walked out of the
  room Snieff walked out behind him.</p>

  <p>"We watched him strollin' about the square an' tried to lure him into the
  barrack-room, but it wasn't any go. After a bit he walked down into the
  field.</p>

  <p>"'Smithy,' sez Nobby, 'how would you like twenty-one days' C.B.?'</p>

  <p>"'About as much as I would like a kick in the back,' I sez.</p>

  <p>"'I've got an idea,' sez Nobby.</p>

  <p>"If I was a writin' chap like you, an' had to write a story about what
  happened to the oily chap in the back field (behind the Gymnasium where
  nobody could see), I think I'd start off like this: 'When the shades of night
  were fallin' fast, Smithy an' Nobby might have been seen carryin' a bundle,
  viz., the oily chap.'</p>

  <p>"We got him over the wall at the back an' on to the footpath. A little way
  along we found Pug Wilson an' Spud Murphy with a barrer.</p>

  <p>"'I'm goin' to tie the sack up,' sez Nobby, an' if you make a sound I'll
  knock your bloomin' head off.'</p>

  <p>"We got him through the town, by side streets, an' wheeled the barrer to
  the goods yard of the railway station.</p>

  <p>"'It's all right,' Nobby sez. 'They're goin' to put an empty carriage on,
  an' I've found out which one it is.'</p>

  <p>"We carried the oily chap along, over the rails, till we come to the
  carriage. It was a sort of horse-box, but there was a little compartment at
  the end for the stable-boy. We took Snieffy out of the sack an' tied his
  hands, an' shoved him through an openin' in the compartment into the
  horse-box itself. Then we got out an' strolled on to the platform. There was
  a lot of people waitin' to see Mutton Pie off to Manchester, and by and by
  they shunted another horse-box on to the train.</p>

  <p>"'What's that for?' sez Nobby, to make sure.</p>

  <p>"'It's an empty we're sendin' to Manchester,' sez a porter.</p>

  <p>"Nobby kept an anxious eye on Snieff's box, an' when the whistle blew an'
  the train started to move somebody sez&mdash;</p>

  <p>"'What's that scufflin' noise?'</p>

  <p>"'It's only Mutton Pie,' sez Nobby.</p>

  <p>"'But I heard a feller shoutin',' sez the chap.</p>

  <p>"'Three cheers for Mutton Pie!' yells Nobby. 'Shout, Smithy,' he whispers,
  'or they'll hear him.'</p>

  <p>"So we all yelled together, an' the people on the platform joined in, as
  the train ran out of the station.</p>

  <p>"'Where's the first stop?' sez Nobby.</p>

  <p>"' Manchester,' sez the porter.</p>

  <p>"'Good,' sez Nobby.</p>

  <p>"'Have you backed Mutton Pie?' sez the porter</p>

  <p>"'Well,' sez Nobby, 'I've done what you might call a double.'"</p>

     name="story15"></a>XV. &mdash; THE FIGHTING ANCHESTERS</h2>

  <h3>Published as "Smithy and the Fighting Anchesters" in <i>Ideas</i>, Hulton
  &amp; Co., London, Oct 31, 1907</h3>

  <p class="first">ONCE upon a time Smithy and Nobby Clark "put a bit in the
  papers" for their own immediate profit and glorification. The "bit" they put
  in was a gross libel, and the unfortunate editor had to apologise and pay 20
  to a local hospital, but Smithy and Nobby got half a guinea for the
  "information," so that they were not greatly perturbed over the editor's
  downfall. But in a roundabout way the Colonel of the 1st Anchesters came to
  hear of the part his two men had played, and acted accordingly. Since when
  both Nobby and Smithy have retired permanently from journalism.</p>

  <p>I was reminded of this unpleasant episode by Smithy himself, who has
  recently been acting the part of mediator between Pug Wilson and Big Harvey.
  It would appear that the said Pug Wilson did wrongly and improperly describe
  the said Big Harvey as a "cellar-flapping gaol-bird," thereby bringing the
  said Big Harvey into ridicule and contempt; and, moreover, of his envy,
  hatred, and malice this said Pug Wilson used threatening and abusive language
  to the said Big Harvey, calculated thereby to cause a breach of the King's
  peace.</p>

  <p>"I don't know what's coming over the Army," said Smithy in despair. "There
  used to be a time when if a feller called another feller a liar, he had to go
  through it on the spot. To call a feller a thief was to ask for a plunk in
  the eye, and when one feller cast reflections on another feller's family it
  used to take six men an' a bugler to pry 'em apart.</p>

  <p>"But they're improving the Army nowadays. We're tryin' to get a superior
  class of young chaps who can write with both hands and do sums with his feet.
  Were gettin' men who call their girls 'young ladies,' and sound their h's,
  and when there's any kind of trouble going cheap these are the fellers that
  talk about reporting you to the company officer, or else takin' you into
  court to make you prove your words.</p>

  <p>"There's two fellers in 'H' Company who are the limit. One of 'em calls
  himself Vane, and used to drive his own motor-car before he came down in the
  world. Nobby sez it was a motor-'bus, and that old Vane lost his job because
  his face frightened the horses, and the 'bus got the blame.</p>

  <p>"The other feller's name's Antony Gerrard, Esquire (that's that he put on
  his attestation paper), and nobody knows what he was. We thought we'd found
  out once. But when it came to the pinch, the police couldn't recognise him,
  and although the lady said she was almost sure that that was the man who took
  her watch, Antony Gerrard, Esquire, got off.</p>

  <p>"I've often been sorry that I'm not in 'H.' it's almost worth the disgrace
  of belonging to the worst shooting company in the battalion to hear these
  fellers talk to each other.</p>

  <p>"All the room stands round and listens.</p>

  <p>"'Well, Tony, dear boy,' sez Vaney, 'you and I are for guard
  to-morrow.'</p>

  <p>"'Horrid grind,' sez Antony Gerrard, Esquire.</p>

  <p>"'Beastly bore,' sez Vaney.</p>

  <p>"'The whole system's rotten,' sez Antony Gerrard, Esquire, disgustedly.
  'The economic wastage&mdash;'</p>

  <p>"'<i>And</i> the undisputed shrinkage.' sez Vaney.</p>

  <p>"'True, true,' sez Antony Gerrard, Esquire, musingly, 'all these factors
  count in the consideration of the vital principle.'</p>

  <p>"Sometimes these two fellers fall out. 'Specially on pay nights. Vaney
  can't take much to drink. Two pints makes him cry, three pints makes him
  insultin', but fifty bloomin' pints wouldn't make him fight.</p>

  <p>"Antony Gerrard, Esquire gets insultin' at the first pint, but bein' a
  very careful man, he keeps his mouth shut till he sees Vaney.</p>

  <p>"The other night both of 'em was in the canteen, and Vaney had just
  finished his insultin' pint, when Antony Gerrard, Esquire, called him.</p>

  <p>"'Vane,' he sez haughtily; 'Vane, you low hound, come here!'</p>

  <p>"Vane puts down his pot with a terrible look in his eye, and
  walks across.</p>

  <p>"'Did I hear you speak, you bounder-man?' he sez fiercely.</p>

  <p>"'You did,' sez Antony Gerrard, Esquire; 'that is if your ears are as big
  as your mouth&mdash;motor-'bus driver.'</p>

  <p>"Vaney pauses a bit an' then sez&mdash;</p>

  <p>"'Gerrard, you are a low cad.'</p>

  <p>"'Be careful what you're sayin', "bus-man," sez Antony Gerrard,
  Esquire.</p>

  <p>"'You're a shockin' low cad&mdash;watch-snatcher,' sez Vaney, very
  pale.</p>

  <p>"This brings Antony Gerrard, Esquire, to his feet.</p>

  <p>"'Say that expression again,' he says, poking his face in Vaney's. 'Say it
  again and I will tear you limb from limb&mdash;hound.'</p>

  <p>"'<i>You</i> would? '</p>

  <p>"'I would.'</p>

  <p>"'Try it.'</p>

  <p>"'Say it again.'</p>

  <p>"Vaney gets very pale, and so does Antony Gerrard, Esquire.</p>

  <p>"'By heavens,' sez Antony Gerrard, Esquire, grindin' his teeth, 'I've
  killed better men than you, Vane, for less than what you've said.'</p>

  <p>"'Kill me,' sez Vane, very faint; 'kill me, I dare you!'</p>

  <p>"'You low, coarse sweep,' sez Antony Gerrard Esquire in a trembling
  voice.</p>

  <p>"Nobby was sittin' close alongside when they was carryin' on this
  conversation. Nobby was tellin' a feller a yarn about a rich uncle who had a
  tailor's shop in Deptford, an' was warmin' up to it. This talk of Vaney's and
  Antony Gerrard, Esquire's, got on his nerves, so he looks up.</p>

  <p>"'Touch me at your peril,' Vaney was sayin'.</p>

  <p>"'Cad,' sez the other chap.</p>

  <p>"Nobby chipped in&mdash;</p>

  <p>"'If you two fellers don't shut up, I'll plug both of you so that you'll
  wish you was never born.'</p>

  <p>"'Can't two gentlemen have a dispute without a third party intervenin'?'
  sez Vane haughtily.</p>

  <p>"'No, they can't' sez Nobby, 'and if you call me a third party I'll smash
  you.'</p>

  <p>"That's the argument that always settles <i>them</i> two. My experience is
  that fellers in this world ain't doubly gifted. If a chap can run he can't
  jump; if he can talk he can't fight, and <i>vicer verser</i>. Bill Mason is
  the worst talker in the battalion. Chaps who don't know him get a wrong
  impression.</p>

  <p>"Vaney tried him once. Gave him a bit of cheek, and waited to see what
  he'd do. Bill didn't do anything, and didn't say anything, so Vaney went
  on.</p>

  <p>"'What's that you call me?' sez Bill, after a bit.</p>

  <p>"'A lout,' sez Vaney.</p>

  <p>"'What's a lout?' sez Bill.</p>

  <p>"'A lout,' sez Vaney, is a low, ignorant&mdash;'</p>

  <p>"'All right,' sez Bill, 'I've got your meanin', and Vaney went down on the
  floor with a bang that shook two windows out of the room. But fellers like
  Bill Mason are gettin' scarcer and scarcer. Now and again we get a man into
  the regiment who's a bit of a surprise.</p>

  <p>"Just after we came home from India, years an' years ago, a new recruit
  came from the depot. He was a nice quiet chap, who didn't say much to
  anybody. Drank his pint with the rest of us; made no friends, and took no
  liberties. He was a good clean soldier, and that's the sort of chap we like.
  Lots of fellers tried him on, but it was no catch, He'd got a way of turning
  things off with a joke. I think he must have been something decent before he
  joined the Army, and Antony Gerrard, Esquire, said that anybody could see he
  was a gentleman.</p>

  <p>"The new feller's name was Gordon&mdash;or that's what he called himself.
  Antony Gerrard, Esquire, tried to chum on to him.</p>

  <p>"'By the way, old feller,' he sez one day, 'are you any relation to the
  Gordons of Loch Lomond?'</p>

  <p>"Gordon looks at him with a quiet smile.</p>

  <p>"'No, I'm not,' he sez, 'I'm a first cousin to the Gordon
  Highlanders.'</p>

  <p>"That shut up Antony Gerrard, Esquire; he couldn't think of any repartee
  for ten minutes, an' then Gordon had gone.</p>

  <p>"Nobby had toothache one day, and was a bit short in his temper, and
  somehow or other got foul of Gordon. Nobby has got a nasty tongue when so
  inclined, and what he said to Gordon meant fighting.</p>

  <p>"Gordon was as quiet as anything.</p>

  <p>"'I'll fight you, he said, 'but I'm not going to fight a man with jaw
  ache.'</p>

  <p>"Nobby thought he was funking it, but as soon as Nobby's tooth stopped
  aching a day or two after, the pair went down into the back fields to settle
  the matter.</p>

  <p>"Nobby came into the canteen, and I could tell by the look of his face
  that he'd fallen on something.</p>

  <p>"'Hullo!' I sez, 'had your fight?'</p>

  <p>"Nobby looked out of one eye an' nodded.</p>

  <p>"'Yes,' he sez; then, after a bit, 'I'm sorry the toothache didn't last a
  little longer,' he sez mournfully.</p>

  <p>"When Gordon came in he looked pleased with hisself, and that ruffled me,
  because I was fond of old Nobby.</p>

  <p>"'Look here, Gordon,' I sez, in a bit of a huff, 'you needn't grin at what
  you've done to Nobby.'</p>

  <p>"It was the only time I've known Gordon to get cross.</p>

  <p>"'I'm not grinning, Smithy,' he sez. 'If you want to know why my mouth's
  this shape, ask your friend Nobby.'</p>

  <p>"We all lived together in love and harmony for a long time after this.
  Sometimes fighting used to run through a regiment like measles through a
  bloomin' orphan school, but that time seems all gone past. We were gettin'
  down to Antony Gerrard, Esquire's class&mdash;we were 'orribly desperate
  talkers. That's what I said before. I don't suppose it's the fault of the
  Army; the country's to blame.</p>

  <p>"Nobody fights nowadays unless he's drunk. We was discussing it the other
  night in the canteen. The question rose over a question of tuppence wot Big
  Harvey said Pug Wilson owed him.</p>

  <p>"One thing led to another, and Pug got a bit personal.</p>

  <p>"'Well,' sez Nobby to Big Harvey, 'I wouldn't let a man say a thing like
  that about my nose if I was you, Big 'un.'</p>

  <p>"'I'll make him prove his words,' sez Big Harvey.</p>

  <p>"'Why not knock his bloomin' head orf?' suggested Nobby, who likes to see
  things settled one way or the other.</p>

  <p>"'Not me,' said Big Harvey, 'I wouldn't bemean myself.'</p>

  <p>"'Well,' sez Nobby, 'bemean him.'</p>

  <p>"'Not me,' sez Big Harvey, who's big enough to eat Pug Wilson. 'I don't
  believe in hittin' a man wot ain't my size.'</p>

  <p>"'Don't you worry,' sez Pug, 'there won't be so much of you by the time
  I've finished with you.'</p>

  <p>"I don't know what else was said, because I only stayed an hour an' I
  didn't hear the end of it.</p>

  <p>"Me and Nobby was going out of barracks that evening, as it was Saturday
  night. We got out into the High Street when Nobby told me what he thought
  about things in general.</p>

  <p>"'The Army ain't what it used to be, Smithy,' he sez, 'we're gettin' a bit
  too polite&mdash;there ain't none o' the old spirit left wot there used to
  be. Why, Happy Johnson told me the other day that he thought scrappin' was
  low an' vulgar, an' George Booth sez a man who strikes another feller is
  worse than the beasts of the field.'</p>

  <p>"Poor old Nobby was quite downhearted about it. I had not noticed it so
  much myself till Nobby pointed it out.</p>

  <p>"Nobby thought it was all owin' to the bad effect of Antony Gerrard,
  Esquire, and was for takin' him out of his bed one night an chuckin' him in
  the river.</p>

  <p>"We got milder an' milder, an' louder an' louder, and when the regiment
  went down to Aldershot for the summer manoeuvres it got quite a scandal. They
  called us the 'Talking Hundred and Tenth,' an' said our motto was, 'All say
  an' no do.'</p>

  <p>"We was brigaded with another regiment, the Royal Wigshire Light Infantry,
  the dirtiest regiment in the British Army, an' it got a bit too thick when
  these fellers started chipping up. As we went through their lines they used
  to shout 'Mama!' an' things like that.</p>

  <p>"One of the Wigshires came over into our camp one night an' said he was
  the light-weight champion of the Army, an' would give any feller a bob who
  could stand up to him for ten minutes.</p>

  <p>"We had got into such a shocking state of peacefulness that nobody said a
  word, and the Wigshire chap went swaggerin' back to his lines larfin'.</p>

  <p>"That night four of us was comin' back to camp.</p>

  <p>"There was me and Nobby and Bill Mason and Gordon. We was takin' a short
  cut through the Wigshires' lines, when one of their chaps spied us an' a
  feller came up an' very politely asked us to go into their canteen an' have a
  drink.</p>

  <p>"We all went in, an' I could see there was a bit of a lark on.</p>

  <p>"'They've gone to get you your drink' sez the feller who asked us in, an'
  I could see him wink at his pals.</p>

  <p>"'There's goin' to be a rough house,' I whispers to Nobby.</p>

  <p>"'There is,' sez Nobby.</p>

  <p>"A man came along with four cans.</p>

  <p>"'Drink hearty,' he sez, with a grin.</p>

  <p>"I looked in the can, an' saw it was milk.</p>

  <p>"'It's only condensed milk,' he sez, still grinnin', 'but it's good
  enough.'</p>

  <p>"None of our fellers so much as batted an eyelid.</p>

  <p>"Nobby looked at the can, and when the laughin' died down, he
  sez&mdash;</p>

  <p>"'Friends an' comrades all, I'm goin' to give you a toast.'</p>

  <p>"Then I loosened my belt, for I knew that an Orangeman's beanfeast was a
  tea party compared with the little affair that was coming along.</p>

  <p>"'Friends an' comrades,' sez Nobby, 'here's the health of the gallant
  Wigshires what run away at the Battle of Modderfontein an' left their
  officers to die.'</p>

  <p>"He drank the milk with one eye on the men.</p>

  <p>"There was a dead silence for a minute, then the whole crowd jumped at us
  with a yell.</p>

  <p>"But they didn't meet the kind of fellers they expected. Nobby was out for
  blood, an' Bill Mason was hitting like a steam engine. I did my little bit,
  an' so did Gordon, who's got a lovely short-arm jab that's worse than lockjaw
  to the man he hits.</p>

  <p>"But there was too many of 'em for us; they came rushin' into the canteen
  from every part of the camp.</p>

  <p>"They drove us back to the counter an' started throwin' things. Then when
  the situation was gettin' pretty hot, I heard a yell outside, and in came the
  Anchesters, with belts an' billets of wood, an' anything they could lay their
  hands on. An', best of all, the first feller to chuck himself into the thick
  of the fight, yellin' like a lunatic, was Antony Gerrard, Esq., as ever was!
  The Wicks' didn't wait for a lickin'. They run like they did at Modder.</p>

  <p>"Somebody shouted 'Get back to our lines!' an' then we heard the 'General
  Assembly' sound.</p>

  <p>"Antony Gerrard, Esq., had got a whack on the head with a belt, an' was a
  bit dizzy, but me an' Nobby took an arm each, an' got him home.</p>

  <p>"It got into the papers, 'Military Riot at Aldershot,' an' that sort of
  thing, but, as Nobby said, it was worth the scandal. It made a man of Antony
  Gerrard, Esq.; it was the first fight he was ever in, and he was so taken up
  with it that he's had a permanent black eye ever since."</p>

  <h2><a id="story16"
     name="story16"></a>XVI. &mdash; SECRET SIGNS</h2>

  <h3>No record of prior publication under this title found</h3>

  <p class="first">"YOU can find lots of ways of makin' money honestly besides
  workin' for it, especially if you read the newspapers," said Private Smith,
  who by the way has been taking part in "skeleton" manoeuvres, when pieces of
  paper stuck on a stick were supposed to represent impregnable positions, and
  three men and a drummer-boy stood for an army corps. Smithy is very pleased
  with himself for he has been representing in turn&mdash;</p>

  <p>A brigade of infantry,</p>

  <p>A quick-firing gun,</p>

  <p>A convoy.</p>

  <p>and the only occurrence that has clouded his joy was his unfortunate
  meeting (whilst he was pretending to be an infantry brigade) with the balloon
  section of the enemy (represented by Private "Swop" Taylor, of the Wessex
  Regiment).</p>

  <p>The irate umpire who found the balloon section and the infantry brigade
  fast asleep by the side of a common lunch had first sworn, then threatened,
  then laughed, for he was an umpire with a sense of humour, and really ought
  not to have been an umpire at all.</p>

  <p>"Some fellers," said Private Smith, "learn a lot from things that appear
  in newspapers.</p>

  <p>"We used to have a chap in 'B' Company who was a rare one for finding out
  how many shillin's put end to end would reach from here to there, so to
  speak. 'Suppose you dug a hole straight down through the earth, where would
  you come out?' he sez.</p>

  <p>"'The other end,' sez Nobby Clark, which was quite true.</p>

  <p>"Well, this feller&mdash;name of Bertie&mdash;was full of information that
  nobody wanted to know, an' from what I've heard he got it all out of
  newspapers. The only feller who was interested was Nobby Clark, an' Nobby
  used to get Bertie to tell him things by the hour&mdash;such as the curious
  marriage customs of the South Sea Islands, how many pints of water there was
  in the North Sea or German Ocean, the number of left-handed people in<br>
  Ireland, and that sort of thing.</p>

  <p>"Bit by bit the thing sort of grew on Nobby, for he was always a bit
  interested in newspapers. You see, Nobby is one of those fellers who are
  always writin' for samples. If he sees an advertisement in the newspaper
  sayin' 'Send a post card for a sample tin,' he ups an' borrows a post card
  from some young chap who don't know him well enough to refuse, and before you
  know where you are, back comes the sample tin with a long letter showin' you
  how much of the cocoa turns into fat, how much into bone, etcetera.</p>

  <p>"Nobby gets a big boxful of things, an' when he's short of cash he sells
  'em off to the troops. Bottles of the stuff that the butcher shocks so, tins
  of cocoa, cards of pen nibs, bottles of nerve pills, stuff for making your
  hair grow, and any number of books about the Encyclo&mdash;what-d'ye-call-it?</p>

  <p>There was one advertisement about a new language&mdash;what's the name of
  it again? Yes that's it. Esperanto. Accordin' to the book Nobby got, it was
  the sort of language everybody would talk if there wasn't any other language.
  Well, Nobby was very struck on it, and used to go about Esperanting. One day
  the orderly sergeant came in to tell Nobby he was for guard. 'Moodgy-koodgy,' sez Nobby&mdash;it sounded like that, anyway&mdash;and Nobby was put
  into the guard-room for swearing at his superior officer.</p>

  <p>"Nobby explained himself next day an' got let off with a caution.</p>

  <p>"'No more bloomin' Esperanto for me,' sez Nobby ; 'I'm goin' to stick to
  fit cures an' bakin' powders,' he sez. 'Wot's the good of learnin' a language
  when there ain't no country to talk it in?'</p>

  <p>"But somehow the Esper gave Nobby an idea, and a few days later he come to
  me an' borrows a shilling. I never mind lendin' money to Nobby, because he's
  very honest about money matters, and I know he'd pay me back if he had to
  steal it."</p>

  <p>Smithy was silent for a moment, then&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Have you ever heard tell of <i>Every Lover's Code and Sign Book</i>? No?
  Well, no more hadn't I; but Nobby saw the advertisement in a young lady's
  paper that he reads every week, so he wrote for a sample.</p>

  <p>"The Code and Sign Company sent back a little handbill showin' how you can
  tell a young lady you love her by drawin' the first finger of the right hand
  down the side of your nose, an' certain other signs for 'We are observed,'
  an' 'Not to-night, but some other night,' an' 'Beware of the dark man.'</p>

  <p>This pleased Nobby so much that he borrowed the money from me an' a stamp
  from another chap an' got the book, an' from the very first day he had that
  book Nobby made money out of it.</p>

  <p>"It happens there was lots of chaps in barracks who knew girls by sight
  an' wanted to be introduced to 'em, but hadn't the nerve to walk up to 'em in
  a society way and say, 'Fine evenin', miss; what do you say to a stroll?'</p>

  <p>"When Nobby explained that all the young ladies in town knew the book by
  heart, the chaps wanted to buy the book, but Nobby said that was a silly
  waste of money, an' he offered to teach the signs at the rate of six a
  penny.</p>

  <p>"Nobby used to have a little class of a couple of dozen chaps down in the
  cricket field, and I used to collect the money whilst Nobby talked. Somehow,
  these meetin's turned into a sort of secret society. It was Nobby's idea, an'
  we had a pass-word, and Nobby was secretary and treasurer, an' we used to
  call each other 'brother.'</p>

  <p>"There was one sign that Nobby was very particular about, an' that was the
  'comrade-in-distress' sign. When you saw a feller rubbin' the back of his
  head very fierce it meant 'Lend me fourpence, an' I will pay you to-morrow.'</p>

  <p>"Spud Murphy asked if that little bit was in the book, an' Nobby said yes,
  but when Spud asked to see the book Nobby said that was against the rules.
  Anyhow, if it was in the book it didn't seem to work, an' me an' Nobby wore a
  bald place in the backs of our heads one afternoon tryin' it.</p>

  <p>"'Why didn't you answer my sign?' he said to Spud Murphy that night.</p>

  <p>"'What sign, brother?' sez Spud, surprised.</p>

  <p>"'The "comrade-in-distress" sign,' sez Nobby.</p>

  <p>"'Good gracious!' sez Spud, or words to that effect, 'I thought that was
  the "I-have-loved-you-for-years " sign! '</p>

  <p>"Nobby's idea in the secret society was that all the chaps was to club
  together an' pay tuppence a week, an' if any one of the brothers got into
  trouble the money was to go to bail him out, or buy him a weddin' gift or
  somethin' of that sort. Nobby was treasurer&mdash;I told you that before.
  Nobby drew up a list of the things you could draw compensation for. Struck by
  lightnin' was one; fallin' out of a balloon was another; bein' blown up on a
  motor-car was another. I can't remember the full list, but I know you could
  only get your money back if something happened that wasn't likely to happen
  once in a thousand years, and when Spud Murphy got fined by the Colonel
  seven-and-sixpence for riotous conduct owing to his uncle coming down to see
  him and paying for the drink, Nobby said the fine couldn't be paid out of the
  society's funds.</p>

  <p>"'For why' sez Spud.</p>

  <p>"'Because,' sez Nobby, the rules say&mdash;</p>

  <p>"'Wasn't it an accident?' sez Spud fiercely.</p>

  <p>"'No,' sez Nobby, 'it was natural causes.'</p>

  <p>"The secret society got into a bit of discredit soon after that owing to
  Happy Johnson, who's a very absentminded chap, meetin' the Colonel on High
  Street, and givin' him the 'let-us-part-friends' sign instead of the
  salute.</p>

  <p>"When Happy came out of cells he said he'd been thinkin' things over, an'
  decided that the society wasn't all it was cracked up to be, an' he asked
  Nobby to call a meetin'. Nobby said certainly, so the brothers all met in the
  cricket field by the side of the river, and Happy moved that the society be
  broken up and that all the brothers get their money back.</p>

  <p>"It was rather a slack time, toward the end of the month, and most of the
  brothers said 'Hear, hear.'</p>

  <p>"Then Spud made a speech, and a feller in 'H' company made a speech, and a
  chap named Williams, who's got an uncle who was a guardian till they found
  him out, he made a speech, and everybody said the same thing, that the
  society was a rotten one and they wanted their money back.</p>

  <p>"Nobby saw that something was goin' to happen, but for the life of him he
  couldn't think out a sign to give in reply to the rude remarks of his
  brethren. There he stood, as cool as a cucumber, listening to what they had
  to say.</p>

  <p>"At the end of it all Nobby replied. I tell you," said Smithy
  enthusiastically, "Nobby looked fine. He wore a bit of blue ribbon round his
  neck to show he was the treasurer and secretary, although most of the fellers
  knew it, owing to Nobby drawing their tuppences every week.</p>

  <p>"'Dear brothers,' sez Nobby sadly, 'the red-haired thief brother who has
  just spoke, an' the wall-eyed liar brother who spoke before, sez the secret
  society must be broke up. Well, it's broke up,' an' he sorrowfully took the
  blue ribbon from his neck and put it in his trousers pocket, an' commenced to
  walk away.</p>

  <p>"''Ere!' sez Spud Murphy, 'what about the money?'</p>

  <p>"'What money?' sez Nobby, surprised.</p>

  <p>"'We want our tuppences back,' sez Spud. An' the other fellers said,
  'Hear, hear.'</p>

  <p>"Nobby thought a bit, then&mdash;</p>

  <p>"'Give me the "want-my-money-back" sign' he set firmly.</p>

  <p>That upset Spud.</p>

  <p>"'Why&mdash;why,' he sez, bewildered, 'there ain't any such sign&mdash;you
  haven't taught it.'</p>

  <p>"Nobby smiled sadly.</p>

  <p>"'No, I know I haven't. I was goin' to teach you that sign next week; but
  the society's broke up, an' You'll never know that sign,' he sez, and walked
  away."</p>

     name="story17"></a>XVII. &mdash; THE FAITH OF PRIVATE SIMPSON</h2>

  <h3>No record of prior publication under this title found</h3>

  <h3>DEDICATED TO THE CONTRIBUTORS TO THE UNION JACK CLUB FUND</h3>

  <p class="note">This story has the disadvantage of being a true
  story&mdash;"disadvantage" because true stories are always dull. I vouch for
  the truth, because I was with Private Simpson at the moment of his passing. I
  remember the night as if it were yesterday. The dark tent, and the flickering
  candle, and the straw on the floor of the fluttering marquee. I remember it
  well, and I wish you could have seen it&mdash;you who have contributed your
  money towards justifying the faith of Private Simpson. &mdash;E.W.]</p><br>

  <p class="first">"YOU quite understand," said Private Smith, of the 1st
  Anchester Regiment, "that it took us a long time before we got the hang of
  this here Union Jack Club.</p>

  <p>"The Army is full up of soldiers' institutes, and the places where
  soldiers can get a Bright 'Arf Hour, an' one or two more or less don't make
  much difference.</p>

  <p>"But when me or Nobby get an invitation to a Bright 'Arf Hour we always
  read the bill through to see if hymn books are provided, an' if they are, we
  don't go&mdash;see?"</p>

  <p>Smithy was in a hurry to explain.</p>

  <p>"Don't think it's because me an' Nobby are down on religious tea-fights
  an' bun struggles because they're religious, because you'll be fallin' over
  yourself. I take my religion with the band on Sunday mornin'&mdash;parade at
  10.30 in church parade kit, an' march away, to the admiration of the town.
  'A' company bein' the first company on parade, an' the first to march into
  church, we're nearer the pulpit, so, in a manner of speakin', we get more
  religion than the other fellers.</p>

  <p>"But the mistake that people make is that you can't do good work without a
  hymn book, and that's where the 'soldiers' home' business goes to
  pot.</p><br>

  <p class="cp"><small>ON SOLDIERS' HOMES</small></p>

  <p>"Soldiers don't like bein' rescued all the time; they don't like bein'
  saved from theirselves, an' that's why you find 'soldiers' clubs' never do
  the same roarin' business as 'The Artillery Arms.' A lot of people run away
  with the idea that he's a desperate character. They have special meetin's for
  him, an' likely as not they get up a subscription an build a home with a
  bagatelle board and an 'armonium to keep him out of the nice, comfortable
  public houses.</p>

  <p>"An' there's meetin' of the Young Soldiers Botanical Class on Wednesdays,
  an a choir practice on Thursdays an the temperance section has a meetin' on
  Fridays, and there's an enjoyable Sankey sing-song on Saturdays, an' coffee
  is provided at moderate prices.</p>

  <p>"There was a chap of oure named Simpson&mdash;Snark Simpson of 'A'. He
  used to go in for politics; before he joined the Army he was a waiter at the
  Deptford Liberal Club, and what he didn't know about Gladstone wasn't worth
  knowin'. He was aiways grousin' about things&mdash;about the Army, an' the
  officers, and how it ought to be run. He was down on soldiers' clubs, because
  he'd got a funny idea that a feller could be good without singin' hymns. But
  mostly bis grumblin' took the form of sayin' 'What's the good?' Sometimes we
  called him 'What's-the-good Simpson,' an' it used to be quite a sayin' in 'A'
  Company, 'What's the good?'</p><br>

  <p class="cp"><small>WHY SIMPSON LAUGHED</small></p>

  <p>"When all the papers was full of the Dargai business, an' people at 
music-halls was singin' about the 'Gallant Gordons on the Dargai Heights,' old
  Simpson used to laugh an' sneer till me an' Nobby nearly hit him.</p>

  <p>"'That's all right,' he sez, laughin', 'but what's the good of fellers
  chuckin' their lives away? People will forget all about it by Derby Day, an'
  if one of them gallant Highlanders goes into a private bar an' asks for a
  drink for a hero, the girl behind the counter will tell him that they keep a
  special bar for 'eroes&mdash;the bottle an' jug department.'</p>

  <p>"'Well, old Simpson went on, an' went on, sneerin' an' grousin', an' said
  that if he ever had to choose between bein' a one-legged 'ero an' a
  two-legged shirker, he knew what he'd do.</p>

  <p>"The war broke out, an' we was sent from Malta to the Orange Free State.
  We had one or two little fights, but nothin' to speak of.</p>

  <p>"One mornin' Nobby sez to me, 'Smithy,' he sez, quits grave, 'there's
  goin' to be a big scrap to-day. I heard old Umfreville say so. I wish you'd
  keep your eye on Snarky Simpson. I don't want him to show up the company. As
  like as not he'll bolt.</p>

  <p>"It started at daybreak an' went on till the afternoon. We got in a tight
  corner with four pom-poms playin' on the regiment. We sat tight for six
  hours, an' then advanced against the kopje where the Boers was. You'd hear
  fellers squeal like rabbits an' go spinnin' round an' drop, an' the regiment
  was absolutely white to a man&mdash;but we kept advancin'.</p><br>

  <p class="cp"><small>"WHAT'S THE GOOD&mdash;?"</small></p>

  <p>"I kept my eye on Simpson, but he didn't look worse than any of the
  others. Then we charged&mdash;we charged a hill, an' we got half-way up when
  the Boers opened out on us. Ten men in my section went down. Two of the
  officers dropped. Poor little Captain Grey... a horrible sight. The fire was
  worse than you can think of. The regiment stopped an' sort of
  hesitated&mdash;but Simpson didn't stop; I can see him now, with his bayonet
  fixed an' his khaki helmet on the back of his bead, stumblin' along over the
  loose stones. He didn't seem to realise be was advancin' alone, an' when he
  did, he stopped an' looked back. Then, above all the cracklin' an'
  tick-tookin' of the rifles, you could hear his voice: 'Come on, you
  blighters. What's the good...?'</p>

  <p>"We laughed, yes, we actually laughed, an' then the company rushed
  forward, scramblin' over the rocks an' firin' steady at every chance. It was
  Nobby who caught hold of Simpson just as he was fallin'.</p>

  <p>"'Hold up.' sez Nobby.</p>

  <p>"'What's the good?' sez Simpson, talkin' like a man in his sleep; an' we
  laid him down.</p>

  <p>"Then the grass on the bill caught fire, an' the medical staff worked like
  devils to get the wounded out before they was burned. Yes," said Smithy,
  seriously, "the old Linseed Lancers were heroes that day, an' I forgive them
  for all their sins. They came out black an' scorched, draggin' the wounded
  with 'em, but me an' Nobby brought old Simpson out. We got him down to the
  field hospital an' into the marquee. There was lots of chaps laid flat that
  day, an' it was nearly nine o'clock that night before the doctor could see
  old Simpson.</p><br>

  <p class="cp"><small>UNDERSTANDING</small></p>

  <p>"Me an' Nobby was sittin' with him when the doctor came. Nobby was was
  holdin' his hand, an'&mdash;an' I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>I waited.</p>

  <p>"I was readin' to him," said Smithy, quietly, 'a-readin' a bit of the
  Bible. The doctor looked at Simpson an' said gently:</p>

  <p>"'You're badly hit, Simpson.'</p>

  <p>"'Am I dyin'?' said Simpson.</p>

  <p>"The doctor nodded his head, an' by an' by went away.</p>

  <p>"Simpson lay for a long time an' said nothing; then after a bit he
  said:</p>

  <p>"'Smithy, I know what's the good now,' be said.</p>

  <p>"'What about?' I asked him.</p>

  <p>"'About soldiers dyin' in action. Why,' he said, 'if chaps like me an' you
  didn't die, nobody would take any notice of them that live&mdash;don't you
  see, Smithy? Civilians'll think a lot more of soldiers because chaps like
  me...' He stopped, but Nobby and me understood.</p>

  <p>"At four o'clock in the mornin' he asked for a drink, an' then he
  said:</p>

  <p>"'What's that?'</p>

  <p>"It was firing&mdash;the pickets were engaged, an' there was a little
  fight going on: so we told him.</p>

  <p>"He smiled a little.</p>

  <p>"'Perhaps them chaps are wonderin' what's the good, too,' he said, an'
  shut his eyes. I think Nobby was cryin', because he was very fond of
  Simpson.</p>

  <p>"When he opened his eyes again he said, 'The people at home will think a
  lot of us...' An' then I heard the regimental assembly go, an' knew the
  Anchesters was falling in.</p>

  <p>"'We've got to leave you now, old feller,' sez Nobby. But Simpson took no
  notice, because he was dead.</p>
