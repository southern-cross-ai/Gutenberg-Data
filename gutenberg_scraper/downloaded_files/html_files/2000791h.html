<h2><a name="preface" id="preface"></a>Preface</h2>

<p>It was soon after the age of thirty that I privately conceived
the idea of writing an intimate account of my own life. At the same
time I felt (like Cellini) that such a narrative could not wisely
be begun earlier than the age of forty when the greater part of
life was already past and it became possible to see the whole in
one perspective. As it turned out I could scarcely have begun it
earlier, for I wished to give due weight to the influences of
heredity and it was not until I was forty that my father put into
my hands a few old family papers which furnished clues to an
investigation of my more remote ancestry, and helped me to
understand the sources of my own tendencies. A little later, in
that same year (1899) as I had planned, I duly began the
narrative.</p>

<p>I wrote it in a leisurely fashion. It seemed to me that in
transcribing, with the most delicate precision I was capable of,
the process of my growth and progress through life, I was occupied
in a task to which only my finest moments should be given. The
record was thus slowly set down during a few days of the best
summer weeks every year at Carbis Bay, as I reclined on the moor,
reserving, without premeditation, one choice and special spot on
Sunday mornings for this occupation. There seemed no need for
haste, life was still spread spaciously ahead. With this careful
choice of time and place the narrative moved so slowly that at the
end of some fifteen years I had not advanced beyond the period of
adolescence. Then my wife died and the space of life before me
seemed suddenly to contract. It became clear that I must speed up
my task. I made a fresh start from the time of my marriage, and I
wrote the two sections of the narrative concurrently. Moreover, I
wrote at much more frequent intervals, though I still chose my
finest moments to write, for if I had from the first taken this
record seriously as the most perdurable piece of work I was likely
to leave behind, a new sacredness was now infused into it.</p>

<p>With the course of years, however, my conception of the method
of my task, though not of its aim, had become modified. I had
started with the idea, which I still retain, that of all forms of
prose, outside the limits of imaginative art, there is no form so
precious in its nature and so permanent in its value as
autobiography. But in this form, as I understood it, there were few
productions that deserved to rank high. Adequately rendered, the
Pilgrim's Progress of the soul through life should be as
fascinating, even as noble a record, as Bunyan's and still more
instructive. Yet of how few can this be said! It cannot even be
said of Bunyan's own autobiography, while nearly all the lives
written in my time, by their subjects or about them, were loathsome
in their falsity or unprofitable in their emptiness. Even when I
viewed the whole range of such works, the <i>Confessions of St.
Augustine,</i> the <i>Confessions of Rousseau,</i> the <i>Memoirs
of Casanova</i> could alone be placed at the summit, though I
recognised that each of these is open to criticism, while there are
some half dozen other autobiographical documents of high value,
often, indeed, little if at all inferior in quality to these first
three. Of all these documents Rousseau's Confessions had always
come before me&mdash;in spite of all the objection brought by the
great army of little scribblers&mdash;as a model in their kind.</p>

<p>Yet slowly, very slowly, even before I had made much progress in
my task, I realised that I could not take Rousseau, or indeed
anyone else, as my model. Rousseau, Augustine, Casanova had each in
his own special way attained the perfection of more or less sincere
intimacy in the record of his individual life and produced a
narrative of immortal value and interest. But Rousseau had been
stimulated by the exquisite torture of his need for
self-justification, and Augustine had been carried away by the
self-abandonment of religious emotion, and Casanova by a certain
audacious moral obtusity. I was conscious of no such grounds for
self-revelation. The very qualities, indeed, of sanity and
reasonableness, of critical impartiality, of just analytic
precision, which made the task fascinating and possible for me,
were incompatible with those qualities which had assured the
success of Rousseau and Augustine and Casanova, not one of whom had
so much as conceived the scientific spirit applied to life.
Moreover, even if I were to set down the exact facts of my life in
the scientific impersonal spirit not impossible for me, I should
still have to encounter the insuperable prejudices of my
contemporaries. All literature is a perpetual struggle. Every
morning the writer who is truly alive must conquer afresh the
liberty of expression. At his heels is the compact army organised
by convention and prudery, ready at any moment to thrust aside or
trample down every straggler. It so happens, also, that for a long
time past, some two centuries or more, my own country and some
others have been passing through a phase of timidity in
self-expression, the outward sign of an increased literary
emasculation. It has been impossible to set down clearly the most
vital facts of life, or always even the most trivial, because they
seemed not to accord with that drawing-room standard of good taste
which generally ruled. Under such conditions no immortal book can
ever be written, and I suppose that our prose literature of this
period&mdash;for the criteria of poetry may be different&mdash;will
be as tedious and unprofitable to posterity as it is already
becoming to ourselves. I cannot accept this standard of taste. Yet
I must necessarily write as a child of my own time. It has thus
come about that I have had to find my own personal way of telling
my own life, a way that is sincere without being crude, a way that
tells all that is essential to tell and yet leaves many things to
be read, clearly enough by intelligent readers, between the lines.
It is not the way I had proposed, it is not an easy way, yet it
seems, on the whole, to be my way, and I think that, if need were,
I could justify it.</p>

<p>There has been selection in my narrative. In every such
narrative there is inevitably selection, and often it is far from
being stringent enough. But too often it is a reverent selection by
which the insignificant things are recorded and the significant
things suppressed. I am indeed concerned mainly with my inner life;
I have no wish to write anything but a spiritual biography, and
outer events only interest me here in so far as they affected my
inner life. I have sought to select the significant things. That
requires a certain daring and a certain fortitude, just as much if
one happens to be a saint as if one happens to be a sinner, though
that is rather a conventional distinction since most people are, at
the same time or at different times, saints when seen from one
angle and sinners from another. No doubt it requires also a certain
skill, if one is to tell the essential truth at every point to
discerning readers and yet avoid the various risks of
truth-telling. I have at least sought to be fair and never to
suppress anything, however shameful it might seem to some, which
signifies. I have not left it possible for any persons, however
miraculously informed, to come forward to discredit my narrative by
the revelation of significant facts I had suppressed. Except for
the beautiful and prolonged episode of my closing years, which is
too near to me to write about, I have left nothing significant of
my life untold. No doubt, some shocked old-fashioned prude will
comment: "I should hope not!"</p>

<p>Those who in writing of their own lives concern themselves
mainly with outer events are, it would seem, largely moved by
vanity, and the outcome is often harmless and agreeable. The motive
that seems to have been influential with me&mdash;apart from the
fundamental impulse of self-expression which may well be
deeper&mdash;is the desire that my experience of life may help
those who come after me to live their own lives. From the age of
sixteen at least that motive has been strong, almost instinctive,
within me. Certainly and consciously, the leading motive which
induced me to take up the chief work of my life was the wish that
others might be spared some of the difficulties I had to contend
with. That, it may be said, hardly justifies me in extending the
same unsparing frankness to the record of my wife's life. I
believe, nevertheless, that&mdash;sensitively independent as she
was&mdash;I may now venture to speak for her as well as for myself.
Her wisdom of life, as she remarked to an acquaintance during her
last week in the world, had been the outcome especially of her
experience with me. She desired to help others, she often succeeded
in helping others, and she never spared herself, although during
the best part of her life she was not without a certain shrewdness
and caution, as well as personal reserve. But I knew what her
unfulfilled plans and aims were, and I knew that, even as regards
the deep-lying anomaly of temperament which meant so much in her
character and work, it was one of her dearest wishes to bring light
and consolation to others. Now there is nothing left to do but what
I have done, in the belief that she would understand and approve,
or, at the least, forgive.</p>

<p>I know there are some who exclaim on the indecency of publishing
intimate letters which were never written to be published. The
love-letters of the Brownings have been used to exploit the
indignation of the superior people who make this protest. I have
looked into those letters; they were all written before marriage by
two people who had never had any opportunity of being intimate;
they might all, as my wife once exclaimed in a different connection
of a letter she had herself written, have been stuck up on the
stable door. But if one publishes letters that once really were
intimate? What can it matter when we are both dead? Who can be
hurt, if she and I, who might once have been hurt, are now only a
few handfuls of ashes flung over the grass and the flowers? To do
what I have done here has been an act of prolonged precision in
cold blood, beyond anything else that I have ever written. For I
know that, to a large extent, the world is inhabited by people to
whom one does too much honour by calling them fools. The cost has
been great, but I have counted the cost. All mankind may now, if
they will, conspire together to hurt us. We shall not feel it. We
shall still be in the soft air that bathes them and in the blossoms
that burst into beauty beneath their feet. Nothing matters to us
who are dead. But we may perhaps have brought a little help and
consolation to those who are still alive, and sensitive and
suffering.</p>

<p>I have no more to say by way of prelude except to make clear
that the period of life I have sought to record is that which
covers what I have always regarded as my life-work, the period of
struggle and of perpetual advance towards a desired goal. With the
completion of that task and, a little later, the loss of that
comrade who had been throughout so loyally at my side, the
narrative ends. All that matters has been told.</p>

<p>But I do not by any means imply that therewith my life was
ended. Far from it! Life has never been so beautiful to me as it
has become since I could peacefully lay the burden of my
accomplished life-work down. With the tension of an unachieved task
no longer felt, with a widespread recognition of the significance
of that achievement such as I had never even hoped for, with a
comparative freedom from anxieties, with loving and lovely friends
among those it has seemed to me the best people in the world, above
all, with the constant companionship of one who has been a
perpetual source of comfort and joy, I can say with truth that the
last phase of my life has been the happiest.</p>

<p>To say this is also to say that this book is not a mere personal
revelation. If it were I should never have written it. I do not
come forward to say: "This was the real Me&mdash;that was the real
She." So to do would merely be to display an indiscretion of
intimacy from which the modest reader might desire to turn aside as
not concerning him. I say what cannot fail to concern him: "This is
life." It is an impersonal revelation which I uncover, and had it
been possible I would use symbols for all proper names, including
my own. The narrative that holds a true picture of life should be
helpful to many, and it has seemed to me that when it represents
what may on nearer view seem failure and yet on far view supreme
success, it is helpful to all. For novels do not bring to us real
life. They inevitably seek to transform life into art, to beautify
it or perhaps to uglify it. When one is not concerned with artistic
representation there is no need to do either. For life itself bolds
all the beauty we can conceive, with all the ugliness, and weaves
them together into a final harmony. It is in the desire by self
expression to help others that I find the chief reason for this
record; and even though, deeper than that, the heart, as Pascal
says, has its reasons, that reason may suffice.</p>

<p>The stuff of our lives is, indeed, a tangled web, yet in the end
there is order. It may be long before order becomes clear, for
life, when we reach below the surface, is full of complexity and
full of contradictions. Thus it has taken me long to find out
whether I am of weak or of strong character; I have seemed to those
who knew me both the one and the other, and could myself find
reasons on either side. But one might ask the same unprofitable
question of the water or the wind. I see now that weakness and
strength are only names for two necessary aspects of any possible
approach, however humble, towards perfection. The man who seems,
and he merely seems, all strength is as far from success as the man
who seems all weakness may be from failure. Indeed, the whole
question of success and failure is of the same blended kind. What
from one point of view is tragic failure may from another angle be
magnificent success, of which the story of Jesus is the immortal
symbol. In the sphere of the practical and in that of the
spiritual, the Napoleons of the world and the Beethovens of the
world tell the same story of success that was failure, of failure
that was success. I know too well my own inefficiency; it has
weighed on me from youth and the disasters I have met have proved
greater than even the melancholy of youth could forbode. My life
has sometimes seemed a path to Calvary trodden with bleeding feet.
Yet the roses of immortal beauty have blossomed wherever I trod. I
have tasted the joys of Heaven on every side. The peace that passes
all understanding has dwelt at my heart. The life-work I planned in
youth I have achieved through half a century&mdash;together with
the power it has brought to help and to console&mdash;in a measure
that surpasses my dreams. And now at the threshold of old age the
precious unsought balms of love and devotion, almost of worship,
that are poured on my head are a perpetual miracle I can only
receive with humility, if not with awe. On the foundation of much
failure is built success, and there is no defeat left for him who
is no longer conscious of defeat. With simplicity and love in one's
heart, with truth to one's own deepest natural instincts, we may
touch the world where we will and it bursts into radiant beauty.
That surely is enough for anyone.</p>

<p>It is certainly enough for me. I have never had ambition as that
word is usually understood, and I have never desired praise, nor
received more than a moderate satisfaction when it came to me, just
as, on the other hand, I have been indifferent, if not indeed
contemptuous, to blame. The attentions of the world, I have found,
embarrass more than they flatter. I have been a dreamer and an
artist, a great dreamer for that is easy, not a great artist for
that is hard, but still always an artist, whether in the minor art
of writing, or the greater art of comprehending, or the supreme art
of living, wherein it is something to have tried even if one fails.
So that if I am often sad&mdash;for the art of living is finally
the art of loving, in which one becomes a master too late&mdash;I
am always content.</p>

<p>For I have always been instinctively attracted to what is
difficult, even in my relations with those I have loved.</p>

<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>Chapter One</h2>

<p>Ever since I was a small child, the sea, and a ship sailing on
the sea, and nearly all the things that belong to the sea, have had
for me a poignant emotional fascination. The sights and sounds and
odours of sailing ships, with the memories of harbours and wharves,
seem woven into my mental texture. Whenever I come back to them it
is with something of the same emotion that everything still gives
me that was once my mother's. I know that as long as I live there
will be no more beautiful thing in the world for me than a finely
cut ship, sailing with full-bellied sails, bound for mysterious
shores. It is perhaps fitting that such a sight should be so moving
to one who has been a pioneer on unknown seas of the spirit,
haunted by the longing to search out remote lands that no keel has
yet touched.</p>

<p>But to explain the fascination that ships and the sea hold for
me I need not fall back on their symbolism. The real associations
have themselves been early enough to explain it all. I was only
seven when my father first took me with him to sail round the
world, and some ten years later he took me again. I can, moreover,
trace the sea far back in the traditions of my family on both
sides. My father was a sea-captain who lived for fifty years on the
sea. His father and all his brothers spent their lives as officials
in the warehouses of the London Docks, in constant contact with
ships, and all the rich and wonderful products of the East that are
there piled up in legendary profusion. My mother was the daughter
of a sea-captain, her only brother was lost on his first voyage at
sea, in a ship that was never heard of again, her grandfather was
both sailor and ship-builder, and most of his family were sailors.
Thus all my near male relations in the generations immediately
preceding me&mdash;all whom I ever heard of in youth&mdash;have
lived on or by the sea.</p>

<p>Behind my sailor ancestors&mdash;again along both sides, for my
father's father and my mother's mother were first
cousins&mdash;there are, for the most part, long rows of often
scholarly divines and parish priests, away from the sea, and
springing mostly from old families seated on the land and all in
Suffolk. It is strange that I knew nothing whatever of this
ancestry until, after I had reached the age of forty, my father put
some old family papers into my hands. Until then my knowledge of
these ancestors had been confined to the bare facts that the names
Peppen and Powle, borne by my father and one of his brothers, were
surnames which entered into the family history at some unknown
period. The few papers my father gave me served as a clue to
various lines of ancestry which I am still slowly unravelling.</p>

<p>It has long been my belief that a man's aptitudes and
temperament are rooted in fundamental characteristics of even
remote ancestors. I know that theoretically nearly the whole of a
man's heredity must be supplied by his immediate ascendants: his
parents and grandparents, and so, in most cases, I doubt not it
practically happens. But the germinal possibilities of heredity
from more remote ancestors, though in most people latent throughout
life, may here and there in a sensitive perhaps slightly abnormal
individual spring into life, rise to the level of consciousness,
and enter into new emotional and intellectual combinations. Recent
theories of heredity seem to make this more rather than less
intelligible. Thus it is, perhaps, that in the sphere of genius for
instance, to which I have given some attention, a man totally
unlike his parents may yet appear to us, and truly appear, as a
marvellous incarnation of the typical characteristics of his race.
For these and the like reasons I have always sought out carefully
the ancestry of the men whom I have desired to study. It has been a
novel and fascinating task to work out the same problem in myself.
I even propose to devote a book to it, and that design, even if
never carried out, may dispense me from entering into any tedious
details here. It will be enough to set forth briefly what appear to
be the main characteristics of the half-dozen families which I
regard as the streams which have fed my own fundamental inborn
personality. As I knew nothing whatever of them, or their histories
before the nineteenth century, until my own life was definitely
moulded, and perhaps its chief episodes already lived, there can be
no question of the consciously plastic force of tradition; if these
people have influenced me at all, as many curious points of contact
seem to show, this influence cannot have been that of example, but
altogether unconscious and organic.</p>

<p>The document, handed down in my father's family, which awakened
in me the desire, never felt in my life before, to make a voyage of
exploration among my ancestors, was the parchment will, proved in
1736, of Susannah Peppen, wife of the Rev. Richard Peppen, Rector
of Great Waldingfield, and daughter of the Rev. William Powle,
formerly Rector of the same Suffolk village and also of Little
Waldingfield near by. I soon set out for Great Waldingfield, which
I had never before heard of, accompanied by my old friend Dr.
Barker Smith, and found a pleasant village, a few miles out of
Sudbury, once a little centre of Puritanism and the home of the New
England Appletons. No one there had ever heard of Peppens and of
Powles, but as we wandered over the churchyard Barker Smith
speedily detected, in perfect preservation, the altar tomb in slate
of William Powle with a long and interesting Latin inscription.
That was the starting-point of an investigation which in leisure
moments I have pursued with considerable ardour and success, aided
by various fortunate and fortuitous circumstances, as well as by a
certain sense for research, assiduously developed in quite other
fields. In a few years I had constructed on a solid foundation the
history in its main lines of several families, and elucidated the
lives of two or three remarkable men.</p>

<p>A figure I look back at with pleasure is that of Richard
Peppen's grandfather, the Rev. William Keble, B.D., Rector of
Ringshall in Suffolk, and at one time fellow of Bene't College (now
Corpus Christi), Cambridge, a victim of Puritanism who has his
niche in Walker's <i>Sufferings of the Clergy.</i> The Kebles were
a vigorous and independent stock, a manorial family, settled at Old
Newton near Stowmarket, perhaps from before the Norman Conquest.
The head of the family was always called "the Heir." At the end of
the sixteenth century the Heir was Giles Keble. William, whose
outspoken allegiance to King and Church brought him suffering and
temporary deprivation of his living, was a younger son of Giles. A
still younger son was Richard who has his part in the history of
England. On leaving the University, Richard entered at Gray's Inn,
became in course of time a distinguished judge and, unlike his
brother, took the Parliamentary side; he presided at Lilburne's
trial with admirable impartiality, and when the Privy Seal was put
into Commission he was appointed one of the Commissioners. But he
was unable to accept the despotism of Cromwell and retired to his
Suffolk estate at Tuddenham, near Ipswich, a few years later, and
long before the Restoration. That doubtless was why he escaped
prosecution for treason, though I have not found the slightest
reason to suspect that he was (as some have supposed) one of the
Regicides. Some have said he fled to Switzerland, like one of his
fellow Commissioners who was murdered at Vevey by Royalists, but
the men of this stock were not accustomed to fly from possible
dangers, and there are various indications that he remained in the
absolute seclusion of his Suffolk home, far from the changes and
turmoils of the world, though there is what seems a deliberate
vagueness in the inscription on the tablet set up to him by his
daughter in the chancel of Tuddenham Church.*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* The biographers of John Keble, author of the

Hon. Richard Keble, but the assertion is baseless. John Keble
belonged to the Gloucestershire family of that name, and though it
is not unlikely that the Gloucestershire Kebles came from the
Suffolk stock, since both districts were engaged in the same cloth
industries (and I find a man of the name of the rare Peppen family
also in Gloucestershire), the separation must have taken place
before the seventeenth century.]</p>

<p>Naturally the Rector of Ringshall's uncompromising attitude
provoked unpleasant attentions from the Puritans. Again and again
they plundered him or at least stile his horses; once they pounced
down on the Rectory and on searching it found it full of pamphlets
on the King's side with not one on the other side&mdash;and it was
set down that he had said of the Puritans that they "railed at the
Pope, yet are Popes themselves, doing what they list," and again
that "if a cobbler or a tinker get into the pulpit and preach four
or five hours for the Parliament, these are the men nowadays."*
Finally, in 1644, he was turned out of his cure, but, as Walker
carefully neglects to say, he was reinstated next year, apparently
through the intervention of Mr. Keble's brother, the Judge, who was
influential on the Parliamentary side. Possibly he reconciled
himself to the new order. He died at an advanced age, and in the
Parish Register there is an unusual entry concerning this "anchient
and revered Divine" who, we are told, was Rector "by the space of
fifty years and upwards (in reality not more than forty-eight
years), and he is described as "a Pastor most faithful in the
service of his Master Jesus Christ, most legal to his prince, very
peaceable and exemplary among his parishioners, very pitiful and
charitable towards the poore, very charitable to strangers, and
most courteous to all honest-minded men." It is interesting to see
the tribute to his loyalty combined with a subsequent statement
that his funeral sermon was preached by Fairfax, who was a leading
Puritan divine in the Eastern Counties! Evidently the bitter
antagonism of earlier years had been mellowed. This was in 1659.
Had old Keble lived a year longer his ears would have been
gladdened by the sound of the bells that announced the return of
the King and the Bishops. His will is a concise and businesslike
document; there is not a word of complaint, and only one personal
note can be traced; the old man&mdash;evidently remembering how
Gresham had devastated the neighbouring county to get timber for
his Royal Exchange&mdash;directs that on his estate the trees are
not to be felled; the landmarks of the old order had been swept
away, but, he seems to say, the trees at least shall remain. He
bequeathed the advowson of the living to his daughter Susannah. She
speedily presented it and herself to the Rev. George Peppen.</p>

<p>I do not know precisely who was the father of George Peppen but
I can trace him to Wenhaston, a village with an interesting old
church some five miles from the Suffolk coast, which was then the
home of the Peppen or Pepyn family. They were a small family which
never branched out far, though in earlier ages it seems to have
been somewhat more numerous, for Pembury in Kent is a corruption of
"Peppenbury." In the seventeenth century, and after, so far as I
can find, there was no other recognisable family of Peppens in
England, and now, it is probable, there are no Peppens at all. I
imagine that they were Walloons who, like so many others, came to
England at some period earlier than the sixteenth century. Ever
since the time of the famous father of Charlemagne Pepin has been,
as it still is, a common name round Liège. The curious point about
these English Peppens is their constant devotion to the Church; we
scarcely hear of them in any other connection; at Wenhaston their
name is only found as that of church-wardens; just before the
Reformation Dom Robertus Pepyn was Rector of Knoddeshall not far
away from his native Wenhaston, where he expressed a wish to be
buried, a piety towards the past also characteristic of these
Peppens. And now George Peppen was the founder of an almost
exclusively clerical family; his three sons were all rectors of
Suffolk parishes; at Ringshall four generations of Peppens
peacefully ruled in succession. The last, who died in 1789, married
the daughter of a Knight, Sir William Barker, acquired a coat of
arms with a Pegasus as crest and now reposes beneath a large
grave-stone with a long inscription at the west end of Ringshall
Church. A son of George Peppen's was that Richard who, like his
father, married a wife with a living in her gift and became, as his
father had once been, Rector of Great Waldingfield. With his
arrival, however, the presentation to the living passed into the
hands of a Cambridge College so that his son Powle Peppen was not
brought up to succeed his father. He settled in Edwardstone, the
beautiful village in which John Winthrop, the founder of
Massachussetts, was born. There he became a farmer, maltster, and
farrier. His two children were both daughters, one noted for her
prettiness, the other for her cleverness. They each became my
great-grandmother, for the clever one married an Ellis of Sudbury,
and the pretty one an Oliver of Bury. In abandoning the Church the
Peppens in the male line became extinct.</p>

<p>The Peppens, as I view them, take on a definite family
character. Their devotion to the Church seems to have been on the
one hand without any ecclesiastical ambition, and on the other, it
may be, without any extreme religious devotion. They sought and
found&mdash;on at least two occasions by the road of
marriage&mdash;Church livings of more than average value which were
quiet and comfortable country estates, and they felt no disdain for
the worldly advantages of good county alliances and a coat of arms.
I take it that they were men of good ability, yet nowise standing
conspicuously beyond their fellows. They were all Cambridge men,
all content with their M.A. degree. They seem to have been faithful
and grateful friends; the Ringshall Registers contain a pleasant
and, I doubt not, reliable account of the virtues of William Keble,
such as one seldom finds in such registers, and there can be little
doubt that George Peppen wrote it; while his son Richard surely
wrote the eloquent Latin epitaph which records the many fine
qualities of William Powle. The Peppens had a certain pertinacity
of character, even obstinacy, as shown by their attachment to the
Church and well illustrated by Richard Peppen, who, before becoming
Rector of Great Waldingfield, was Head Master of the Grammar School
at Needham Market. Here he would insist on preaching in
neighbouring churches, although the managers of the Grammar School
maintained that he should devote his whole time and attention to
the school. It was a dispute which, I understand, has continued to
appear even in modern schools with clerical heads. In this case the
Head Master was repeatedly called to order and severely admonished,
but he continued imperturbably on his own way. The history of the
conflict was contained in the minute books of the school which,
unfortunately, have disappeared in recent years.</p>

<p>Of all these families it is the Fowles I know most about. They
belonged to Bury St. Edmunds, and in the fifteenth century they
called themselves Bocher, indicating that they had once been
butchers (which then meant primarily graziers). They are described
as yeomen, but at the beginning of the sixteenth century one of
them was a plumber, and that was an important occupation at a time
and in a region where church building was active and churches must
be roofed with lead. These sixteenth-century Bochers, men and
women, wrote long and detailed wills, all extant in the Bury
Probate Registry, which show that though they were not more than
comfortably well off, they were estimable people, thoughtful and
kindly for all whom they came into relation with. One charming old
lady of the family, Margaret Powle <i>alias</i> Bocher&mdash;the
women were nearly all Margeries or Margarets in this
family&mdash;made an unusually long and detailed will which gives
the pleasantest picture of her character and surroundings. Every
article she possessed, it would seem, every pot and pan, every
garment, is separately bequeathed as an affectionate remembrance,
often with a befitting word of gratitude or regard, among a large
circle of relations, friends, acquaintances, her manservant and her
maidservant. To her grandson Paul Powle she leaves, not a brass
dish or a pair of shirts, but, perhaps with insight into the boy's
character, "ten shillings of good and lawful money," though I may
note that his father John Powle left him, in addition to a fair
share of his estate in money, "my other clavichord and my lute and
some of my singing books," but this Bury yeoman was evidently a
most musical man, for beside this clavichord (supposed to be
identical with the clavichord which preceded the spinet) he had
another, as well as two virginals, and singing books enough to be
divided among all his Sins. He was a true Elizabethan, this
accomplished musical yeoman, nor was he neglectful of his bow and
arrows, though he bequeathed them outside the family, realising, no
doubt, that they were growing out of date, and that Paul Powle
would prefer a gun. Paul Powle, who was born in 1864, raised the
family to a higher social position and acquired a considerable
estate. But I regret to say that, though extremely restless and
energetic, he was scarcely an amiable or even estimable man. My
knowledge of him is extensive and the evidence convincing. He was
apparently a lawyer, "Clerk in the Icing's Bench" (and we hear of
him being commissioned to make out a deed of conveyance), with
chambers in Fleet Street, himself most litigious, and not always
strictly scrupulous. For many years he was the neighbour and friend
of Adam Winthrop (father of the great New Englander), a lawyer
also, lord of the manor of Groton and the auditor of two Cambridge
Colleges, an excellent and pious man. In Adam Winthrop's
interesting but still unpublished Diary (deposited in the British
Museum since this was first written and now printed), as well as in
his Almanacks, there are curious and vivid glimpses of Powle's
private life. Moreover, since Powle was constantly figuring as
plaintiff or defendant in Chancery cases various aspects of his
domestic affairs are thus brought before us. Adam Winthrop never
says a word which records his opinion of Powle, but he shows that
though they were often in association and on friendly terms, and
the affairs of his family and Powle's were intimately connected,
there were constant disputes between them over leases and bonds and
so forth. Sometimes "I was arrested at Mr. Powle's suit," sometimes
"Mr. Powle was arrested at my suit," but these disputes seem to
have been satisfactorily settled. Powle's first wife belonged to
the Vintner family, rich Suffolk clothiers, and hereby also he was
in hot water. In 1603 Winthrop mentions that at Bury Sessions Powle
bailed his brother-in-law, Zachary Vintner&mdash;who was a youth of
twenty&mdash;charged with burglary, and that Adam Winthrop
testified against Zachary; we know from other sources that Zachary
was hanged for that misdeed. A few months later we hear that Powle,
after sitting in a Commission at Colchester, "was in danger to have
been killed by Gilbert Vintner, his wife's brother"&mdash;it is not
clear why&mdash;who two days before had been staying at his
brother-in-law's house at Groton. Again, much later, Winthrop
mentions that Powle "charged a chimney-sweeper with stealing of a
silver cup." It is not certain that Powle was a bad man. I do not
think that he was. But he seems to have been a highly energetic and
probably neurotic person, devoted to the furtherance of himself and
his family, irritable, suspicious, and aggressive, yet constantly
regarding himself as the victim of other people's malevolence, a
troublesome man for all who had any dealings with him. He is
described by his father-in-law as "always quarrelsome," and
certainly was so. It must at the same time be said that the wrongs
were not all on one side, and it would seem that at that period a
considerable proportion of respectable well-to-do people must have
been engaged in endeavouring to cheat each other in ways that were
often bare-faced and sometimes violent. Powle's young
brother-in-law of the first marriage, as I have noted, though of a
good family, was hanged for burglary. Three years after the death,
within a few days, of his first wife and of his only son by her, he
married Sarah Corder, a wealthy yeoman's daughter, who, her father
admits, was "much in love." Her dower was to be £400. But twelve
years later Corder had not paid his daughter's marriage portion,
and Powle brought an action in the King's Bench, and was awarded
only £150 by the jury with costs. Then Powle came forward to
complain that on that occasion Corder had appeared before the Court
in such shabby attire that the jury concluded he was poor. A few
years later Powle, having apparently received no satisfaction,
brings an action in Chancery against Corder, who pleads in his
answer that he had always been hoping for "a better and more
friendly disposition" in Powle, but this hope was not realised, and
one Sunday while Corder and his aged wife (they were both near
eighty) were at church Powle entered their house, debarred their
entrance, and thus forced them to seek their lodging in woods and
barns. Corder further pleads that Powle had brought an action
against him in the Star Chamber which led to his imprisonment in
Whitechapel gaol, and while Corder was still there Powle, he
alleges, instigated the gaoler's wife with two ruffians to attack
him and take his money away. These quarrels are difficult to
disentangle. Later in life Powle fell into more serious troubles
which are easier to follow.</p>

<p>Powle had purchased the living of Great Waldingfield for the
future benefit of his young son John, whom he was sending to
Cambridge, and in the meanwhile he rented the Rectory on lease at
£40 a year, undertaking the repair of the parsonage, boarding and
lodging the rector, Clemson, with fire, washing, and attendance to
the value of £20 a year, also paying him to instruct two of his
children sometimes over £2. Almost from the first Powle felt that
he was being victimised by Clemson. Always mixed up in so many
people's affairs, Powle had been executor to the previous rector,
Hindes, whose books to the value of £50 had come into the hands of
Powle, and he now found them in possession of Clemson, as Clemson
admitted, but said they had been left in the Rectory and he knew
nothing of Powle's rights to them. Then in 1624 Clemson absented
himself, Powle alleged, from his cure for the space of more than
four score days, whereupon the lease, according to the law of the
realm, becoming void, Powle prepared a new lease, but this
disappeared from Powle's desk in the Rectory, and since no one in
the house was able to read or write except Clemson, Powle opined
that he must have taken it. Clemson on his side denied the
allegations and pleaded "that the bill was drawn up in more malice
to vex a poor minister, denies he carried away the lease, and
before he carried away his books he allowed Powle to examine them
himself to manifest his honesty; he wishes the lease to be void and
to pay his own duties, etc. Says that Powle when he came to his
parsonage house shut him in unarmed and Powle's wife set upon him
with her fists most outrageously and Powle struck him a deadly blow
with a gun over the forehead, which swelled immediately to the
bigness almost of a hen's egg, and the length of a man's finger,
and bled some few drops of blood, and afterwards the complainant
threw a chamber pot at his head which, had he not fenced off with
his arm, it came with such a force, he believeth it would have
brained him; then Powle cried 'Kill him!' and his wife cried 'Shoot
him!' and Clemson flew out of the house without his hat or cloak."
It is satisfactory to find that Powle was able to secure such
wholehearted allegiance from his wife, but we see, as indeed we
know from many other sources, that in the reign of James I the
conduct of ladies and gentlemen was not marked by the same prim
propriety as in the reign of the highly respectable Victoria, nor
was there any undue excess of reverence for the "sacred cloth."
Clemson held the living, however, for five years longer, and then,
over his successor, Nicholas Bloxam, Powle fell into the most
lamentable troubles of all, fur, as is so often the case with
people of his temperament, he was quite incapable of learning by
experience. His son John was still too young for the living, so
Powle endeavoured meanwhile to extract the utmost profit from it,
and in this effort he committed the grievous ecclesiastical sin of
simony, aggravated by breach of promise. (A reliable version of the
matter is printed, among other cases in the High Court of
Commission, by the historian Gardiner in a Camden Society volume.)
The parties injured in the matter reported it to the High Court of
Commission. Powle, together with Bloxam, was tried before
Archbishop Abbot, Laud, and many other bishops. He was found
guilty, excommunicated, heavily fined, deprived of his lands, and
imprisoned. The deprivation and imprisonment were not part of the
original sentence, but Powle was not the man to yield weakly, and I
expect that he aggravated the original offence by resistance to the
Court. In his defence he admitted the facts but sought to justify
them. These admitted facts, however, cover the whole case against
him, and the sentence of the High Court was not unjust though it
might have been excessive. It is astonishing that a lawyer should
have been ignorant of, or indifferent to, so elementary a principle
of ecclesiastical law, but in part this may be accounted for by the
evil odour which everything ecclesiastical was now acquiring for
Puritans, and the Powles, though always Anglican, leaned strongly
to the Puritan side which was generally prevalent in Suffolk. The
influence of Puritanism in this matter is shown by the fact that
eventually the sentence of the Court of Commission in Powle's case
was quashed by the House of Lords&mdash;surely a much transformed
House of Lords&mdash;and the case was sent for re-trial to the
Suffolk Assizes, I believe at his native Bury, and here a jury,
evidently composed of Puritans, brought in a verdict against the
bishops and in favour of Powle. It was not a sound verdict, but it
was, in a sense, a justification of Powle, and it indicates,
moreover, that, turbulent and unscrupulous as his methods appear to
our more refined age, he had not lost popular esteem among his own
fellow-citizens; they probably regarded him, indeed, as something
of a martyr at the hands of a tyrannical Church. In 1636, evidently
no longer a prisoner, I find him petitioning Laud, now become
Archbishop of Canterbury, for release from the sentence of
excommunication. The petition is in the Record Office, and I see
Laud has written on it an instruction to the Dean of Arches to
report to him before anything is done in the matter, for "he hath
been a very troublesome man." Therein, I suspect, the Archbishop
wrote Paul Powle's epitaph. I can hear little more of him. In 1638
he was living in his house at Felsham, in the full enjoyment of his
old litigiousness and persistency; for we find that&mdash;recurring
to that old grievance of seventeen years back&mdash;he brought an
action for the return of some of the books left by Hindes in the
Rectory of Great Waldingfield and since purchased for £24 by a
clergyman named Bird who knew nothing of Powle's claim. What
happened in the matter I do not know, probably nothing. Then in
1642 we hear of him as lending money, but as being at the same
time, or a little later when repayment was due, in prison at
Bury&mdash;it is not stated on what ground&mdash;and, again
characteristically, because repayment was made a few days late, he
insisted that the amount repaid should be considerably increased.
Then in a subsequent Chancery deposition, in 1652, it is stated
that Powle was dead, though the date of his death is not given, and
in other Chancery pleadings, I am told, it is mentioned that he
died in the Fleet prison in London. Whether, however, these
imprisonments arose out of the old trouble with the Court of High
Commission seems doubtful, for that Court had been abolished in
1641. Thus was his turbulent life gradually extinguished in
obscurity and disgrace. He seems already to have lost his devoted
wife, and his daughter Sarah, named after her mother, occupied her
father's house at Felsham and held the presentation to the living
of Great Waldingfield. The Felsham parish registers for that period
no longer exist, there is no monument to Powle or his family in the
Church, and I cannot anywhere find his will. That will was,
doubtless, a document on which Powle spent some care as he had a
larger estate to devise than any of his family before or after, but
their wills are mostly extant and his has disappeared. He probably
died about the beginning of the Civil War troubles, and in the
general dislocation of these times his will and the memory of his
end were both alike lost.</p>

<p>There is one fact which may indicate that Paul Powle was perhaps
a more estimable person than the records present to us. He not only
came of an estimable stock but his descendants also were sturdy and
admirable men. His son, John Powle, for whom he had purchased the
Great Waldingfield living, was of Puritan leanings, a great admirer
of Owen, but though, as he said, he would rather any order in the
Church than none, he was for episcopal rule; consequently, after
having been parson of Great Waldingfield for a time (though there
is no mention of him as rector in the Waldingfield registers or any
other official document), he states in his will that he refused to
sign the Covenant and fled, never to return, as he honourably
refused to turn out the incumbent he placed there. He became vicar
of Dartford&mdash;at a time when many travellers, Pepys frequently
among them, stopped at this village to change horses and dine at
the Bull, as in later years for the old vicar's sake I have
done&mdash;and here spent a long life, for he was over eighty when
he died in 1692, leaving little record of himself in the registers,
but making a digressive and amusing will, which exhibits him as a
staunch Protestant, and perhaps a rather eccentric personality. His
hatred of Popery is pronounced; he lays many evils to its charge,
including the great fire of London, and shows a knowledge of the
history of various European countries, partly derived no doubt from
his folio copy of Monro's <i>History of the Wars of the King of
Sweden,</i> which he specially bequeathes to a nephew, and he
desires that no Arminian be presented to the living of Great
Waldingfield lest the souls of the people be infected with Pelagian
principles which prepare for Popery. He would have no sermon
preached at his funeral;* he will have no coffin because of the
risk of being buried alive; and he directs that no stone or railing
shall be placed to mark his grave. He married twice, having a
family by each wife, and he divided among them a considerable
property evidently derived from his father. One of his daughters
married his successor at Dartford. In his son William this circle
of clerical ancestors is completed.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* He evidently felt strongly on this point,
for he dwells on it at length: "I will that there be no sermon at
my burial, funeral sermons in the general having done more harm
than good as they have been commonly used, the original of the
custom not commendable, the abuse of it very great, the
consequences prejudicial and destructive, being eulogiums unto, and
in the hearing of those who were not strangers to, the deceased,
and who, finding those placed in Heaven by the Preacher whose
conversation was so well known to them to be but civil at best,
they hence take liberty to cast away care of any strict search into
their spiritual estate...For these reasons let me be buried in
silence without word spoken except the office appointed."]</p>

<p>William Powle left his fellowship at Pembroke College to
accompany as curate the Master of the College, Dr. Coga, who had
chosen to retire from Cambridge to the rich living of Framlingham.
Here for many years Powle lived and laboured, the burden of the
cure doubtless sliding more and more from the shoulders of the aged
rector on to his; the entries in the register are largely in his
hand. He married, acquired property in Framlingham, and here nearly
all his children were born. In due course when his father's
incumbent&mdash;"a very careless incumbent," it is
recorded&mdash;at length died in 1694, William Powle migrated to
Great Waldingfield. The Rectory, to-day entirely transformed,
stands in spacious and pleasant grounds, approached through a
winding avenue of trees from the Church. Here Powle lived, and in
old age died, the finest flower of his race, and the model of an
eighteenth-century parish priest, scholar and squire and pastor of
souls, simple, just, modest and practical, loved and esteemed by
all. His eldest son, who bore his father's name and was certainly
intended to succeed to his father's living, had died immediately
after taking his degree. This was evidently a severe blow to the
old man, and in his will&mdash;an unaffected and straightforward
document with none of the quaintly aggressive personal touches we
find in his father's will&mdash;he directs that he is to be buried
near to this son. He had other sons and was married to a third wife
(widow of Mark Anthony, a rector of Framlingham), also
affectionately mentioned in the will, but it is his daughter
Susannah whom he makes his sole executrix with considerable powers
and to whom he leaves the presentation to the living which is
afterwards to be sold, and became, as it still remains, the
property of Clare College. In the male line, after some four
centuries of vigorous life, the Powles were now a declining stock;
William Powle was the final emoresence of the family, and in his
sons it died out. Alike in Kebles and Peppens and Powles the line
of hereditary succession has finally been through the women.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the eighteenth century the history of these
families became rather featureless, on the whole, indeed, more
humble. Powle Peppen, the only child of Richard Peppen and Susannah
Powle, spent his whole life quietly at Edwardstone. He had not
inherited the Powle property, which went to his Uncle John, nor,
probably, had he inherited any aptitude for business, for the
Peppens, as we know, were apt only for the Church, but he seems to
have maintained his place in life. I know that he had to borrow
money, but I know also that he duly repaid it in instalments for I
hold the receipts. He had married Mary Dodd, of Cockfield in
Suffolk, whose father, Merry Dodd, seems to have been in business
there. He was somehow related, according to a tradition on both
sides of my family, to that brilliant, extravagant, careless Rev.
Dr. Dodd, who acquired some fame and much notoriety as an eloquent
preacher, the skilful editor of the <i>Beauties of Shakespeare</i>
which served to popularise Shakespeare, and a forger who&mdash;so
great was the public outcry against the infliction of the penalty
on such a person&mdash;proved to be the last in England to expiate
the offence of forgery by hanging.*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* The main facts about Dodd were brought
together in a book by Percy Fitzgerald, <i>A Famous Forgery,</i>
1865. The author remarks that "no English social event of that
character, before or since, ever excited so much absorbing
interest."]</p>

<p>I have inherited a miniature said to represent Dr. Dodd, but
what his relationship was to Mrs. Powle Peppen neither the
genealogy of the Cockfield Dodds, so far as I possess it, nor the
biography of the unfortunate divine suffices to make clear, and it
could not have been closer, at nearest, than cousinship. A
descendant of the Dodd family, with whom I have been in touch, had
not heard of Mary Dodd. Mary Peppen died in 1767, two years before
Dr. Dodd's execution at Tyburn, at the early age of twenty-seven,
and left two little girls who, though I suppose that they spent
their motherless youth with their widowed father (he never seems to
have married again) in a small village without social position save
a tradition of gentility, possessed fine personal qualities and may
be said to have married well, one to my great grandfather. John
Ellis, a burgess, like his father before him, of Sudbury, the other
to my great-grandfather, Laver Oliver, burgess of Bury St. Edmunds,
a most energetic and prosperous citizen of the town, where he was
an upholsterer beside establishing an extensive carrier system,
greatly furthering the fortune of a mainly commercial family which
still flourishes honourably in Bury and Sudbury.*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* In its ramifications the family has been
active in many professional and other fields. One of its members, a
retired Anglo-Indian, had an extensive genealogical tree prepared.
This was once lent to me by the head of the Bury family.]</p>

<p>Ellis is an old Suffolk name, and though I have not traced the
Ellises I am descended from further back than William Ellis who was
a burgess of Sudbury in the first half of the eighteenth century, I
am content to believe that they were the same family who were
burgesses of Sudbury in the previous century (when they owned the
Swan Inn, later described by Dickens as the Peacock and demolished
in my time), and, indeed, appear prominently in the Corporation's
records centuries earlier. A family tradition, it is true, reports
that the Ellises were descended from an eighteenth-century Mayor of
Wrexham, in North Wales, but as there were then no mayors of
Wrexham, and the tradition in other respects seems inexact, I am
inclined to doubt it.*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* It must be admitted there are points that
make the Wrexham tradition plausible. It is derived from my eldest
uncle, who in youth was much with his grandfather, and it
harmonises with some ascertainable facts. The Wrexham Ellises used
the same Christian names; they were Congregationalists like those
of Sudbury and helped to found a church of which in 1783 a Mr.
Jenkin Lewis was minister, and it so happens that my father has
informed me he had heard of a family connection with the Lewises, a
name not belonging to Suffolk. But the original Sudbury Ellis, if
he came from Wrexham, must have left long before this period.
Palmer's <i>History of Wrexham</i> makes no mention of any Ellis
who fulfils the necessary conditions. The settlement of the matter
may doubtless be found in the registers of All Saints, Sudbury.
Another tradition, also coming through the same uncle, is more
intangible. According to this, the Ellises are really Wyatts, a
Wyatt at some unstated period having been adopted by an Ellis. In
1743 there was at Sudbury a John Wyatt, apparently like the Ellises
a dissenter in religion, but he was not early enough.]</p>

<p>I only know certainly that towards the middle of the eighteenth
century the family was respectably settled in Sudbury, where, from
1731 on, the name duly appears in the Registers of Baptisms of the
ancient Independent Chapel, with which at the same time the family
of the painter Gainsborough, who was born at Sudbury in 1727, was
also connected. In 1764 we hear that William Ellis, my
great-greatgrandfather, had his "dwelling house with
appurtenances," situated in the parish of All Saints, Sudbury, "set
apart for the religious worship of Protestant Dissenters by
certificate under the Archdeacon." (The house of John Gainsborough,
clothier, in the parish of St. Peters, had been similarly set apart
in 1756.) At that time William Ellis was described as a staymaker,
which was also the occupation of Thomas Paine's father at Thetford
almost at the same time; in 1792 he is described in the Universal
British Directory, amongst the principal inhabitants of Sudbury, as
a wool-factor. His son John, my great-grandfather, who married
Elizabeth Peppen, became a linen-draper in the city of London in
1790, and is so termed on the certificate admitting him to the
freedom of the Borough of Sudbury and to all the liberties and
privileges appertaining. His private address was then in Astley
Row, Islington.*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* In 1929 I went to look at the house, once of
highly respectable character, now falling into decay, but still
facing a pleasant open space.]</p>

<p>My grandfather Edward was the second child, and the young wife
took him as a baby on a visit to her husband's family at Sudbury. I
have the fresh and charming letter she wrote to her husband on the
occasion; full of delight at the admiration her child has aroused
in the stage-coach, and with a trace of gay persiflage of all the
old people at Sudbury and their meeting-house. John Ellis
established a linen-draper's business in Tavistock Street, Covent
Garden; his shop seems to have acquired a reputation in the
theatrical region in which it was situated; Mrs. Siddons, the great
actress, used to come to him for her stockings; an engraving of
her&mdash;presented, I understand, by herself&mdash;has been handed
down in the family. It would appear, however, that the business was
not successful&mdash;only the Olivers among my forebears seem to
have had any genuine relish for trade&mdash;and at a late date John
Ellis became a corn-factor. As regards his personal tastes, I only
know that he was fond of music and played the organ. My father
could just recall him as a tall, dignified, and handsome old
gentleman in knee-breeches who called him "Ned." One day in Chapel,
a little later, after joining heartily in the singing, he sat down,
stooped to pick up his gloves, and was shortly after found to be
dead.</p>

<p>His son Edward, born in 1794, who spent his life as a
warehouseman in the London Docks, occupied the spacious,
well-built, and pleasant corner-house which still stands on the
Pier Head at Wapping; it was later occupied by his eldest son and
successor as an official in the Docks, my Uncle John, and in
childhood I was often taken there. My father's father&mdash;as I
gather from what I have heard of him and from his daguerreotype
portrait&mdash;was thought French in appearance and, unlike his
father, was of small size. (His mother referred to his "dark eyes"
even as an infant, and I may perhaps conclude that he took after
her and that the Peppens were a small dark race.) He was a gentle
and sensitive man of rather nervous and anxious temperament,
refined artistic tastes, and versatile intellectual aptitudes. His
relations considered him rather indifferent to religion, but
judging from a letter he wrote to my father when a boy, chatty and
familiar but with a simply genuine reference to religious matters,
I suspect that he was religious at heart. He was fond of flowers
and of music, himself playing the flute. He dabbled in mechanical
problems, and invented a new kind of buoy which was found by the
authorities to be excellent in idea but impracticable, though
afterwards it was modified by others and generally adopted. He
liked to draw, and desired his sons to have a sound education in
drawing, for which, however, they had little taste. He amused
himself, too, by tinting prints of the old masters with delicate
water-colour washes. He was also a good amateur carpenter, and made
an excellent book-case which is still in use. He had little
affinity with his commonplace wife, the daughter of a yeoman
farmer, named Gxay, in the Isle of Wight, and he was rather worried
by her ceaseless household activities on behalf of the family of
seven children which filled the fine solid old house on the Pier
Head.</p>

<p>On the whole the Ellis family seems to me chiefly remarkable for
its mediocrity, a golden mediocrity it <i>may</i> possibly be, the
mediocrity of people who have no vices and no temptations, who
never absolutely fail in life, but have no great ambitions and no
great ideals. Their energy is always fairly adequate to carry them
along the path of life in which they find themselves, but they are
never troubled by any surplus of unused energy. "In medio
tutissimus ibis," that is a truth they know by instinct. My own
temperament has in it elements of an extremely other sort, and I
owe much to the Ellises fora good dose of this beautiful
mediocrity, to me a harmonising influence of the most precious
character.</p>

<p>Very different were the characteristics of my mother's family, I
mean especially the Olivers, to whom my mother's mother belonged.
Here there was an exuberant energy which displayed itself in
various fields. They wandered over the world as soldiers, they
achieved success in commerce and trade; they were, indeed, the only
family from which I spring which showed any aptitude for making
money. In recent times an Oliver, a cousin of my mother's, was
regarded as the foremost citizen of Bury St. Edmunds, the town of
the Olivers, though they had originally come from Sudbury, with
which they retained a connection, so having moved in a reverse
direction from the Powles who originated in Bury, to settle later
around Sudbury, where Olivers and Powles both came in contact with
Ellises who seem always to have belonged to Sudbury or the
neighbourhood. That is how it came to pass that I am doubly
descended from the Powles and the Peppens and the Kebles through
the marriages of my two great grandmothers, Elizabeth Peppen to
John Ellis and Susannah Peppen to Laver Oliver. Thus, so far as I
can trace, I am purely English in the narrowest sense, and on both
sides I am half of Suffolk descent. Of recent years&mdash;since I
have become acquainted with these facts and since also I have
learnt to know the characteristics of Suffolk&mdash;I have been
amused to trace in myself some of the fundamental traits of the
Suffolk character.*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* That I am justified in regarding myself as
mainly an East Anglian of Suffolk is indicated by at least one
little organic trait. As a child I was worried by finding in myself
a difficulty in pronouncing the "th," notably in such a combination
as the biblical "it sufficeth us," and the difficulty still
remains. It is only of recent years that I have learnt that this
difficulty is a recognised East Anglian shibboleth.]</p>

<p>East Anglia, as I have found, has some claim to be a focus of
English genius. Much that is most typical in English politics and
adventure, thought and science and art practice, has come out of
East Anglia. The people of Suffolk, sometimes apparently slow, are
yet ever exuberant in energy, often bright of eye and quick of
action. Cautious, patient, pliant, conciliatory, they can yet be
forceful, independent, obstinate. Not superficially brilliant like
the people of the south-west, they are not so impenetrably reserved
beneath a hard rind like the people of the north; there is a strong
emotional undercurrent which makes itself felt, even though it may
not be visible, so that they are a friendly people whom it is not
difficult to get on with. Women play a large part among them. The
solidity these people of Suffolk owed to their Dutch and Flemish
affinities has been modified by French Huguenot and other foreign
elements. They are a practical and materialistic people who delight
to make their surroundings spacious and beautiful, a religious and
benevolent people, indeed, yet by no means ascetic, scarcely even,
in the narrow sense, a severely moral people; their instincts in
life, as in science and art, tend to direct them towards
Nature.</p>

<p>At many of these points I feel myself to be a true child of
Suffolk. I have sometimes been puzzled at my instinctive and
seemingly opposed attraction towards science and towards art. But
they are both in the Suffolk character and both alike are forms of
the love of Nature. The fact, however, that I am a true child of
Suffolk is brought home to me by the instinctive attraction which I
have often felt towards people who came from the same district as I
come from, even before I knew what that district was. As a student,
the two fellow-students for whom I felt a touch of real personal
affection&mdash;though from lack of common intellectual interests
no permanent friendship was formed&mdash;both came, as I afterwards
discovered, from the same parts of Suffolk as my own family, while
the only fellow-student with whom I have formed a lifelong
friendship, Dr. Barker Smith, belonged on both sides to the
neighbourhood of Castle Hedingham, within a walk of Sudbury where
my own ancestral roots are most deeply planted. Almost the most
intimate of my women friends during many years belonged to the same
region, and even a girl patient in the hospital, who was once under
my care as a student, and seemed so charming to me that I wrote a
sonnet about her (Arabella), possibly belonged, as I now judge by
her type and her name, to Suffolk.</p>

<p>When I consider the character and ability of these various
Suffolk forefathers so far as known to me, I seem to trace elements
of my own character&mdash;of individuality, of persistence, of
obstinate fidelity to one's own ideas&mdash;in several of the
remote country parsons from whom I am doubly descended. William
Powle may be said to be the most distinguished figure of my family
of whose character very definite record is left. The filial piety
of his daughter and the generous and grateful appreciation of his
son-in-law, Richard Peppen, perpetuated his memory. They also
showed their affectionate piety towards the old man's memory by
naming their only child Powle. The Latin epitaph on William Powle's
altar-tomb is a precise characterisation which can scarcely be
classed with the vague and flowery eulogies so common in such
places. I translate as follows: "Here by his own desire are laid
the mortal remains of William Powle, A.M., for thirty-three years
the most vigilant Rector of this church, a man wise, modest, and
learned, simple and without guile, pious without pretence, a
theologian to be numbered among the first both for skill in
judgment and for power of discourse. He died on the 14th of
September in the year of human salvation 1727, aged seventy-two." I
cannot pretend to myself that I am in any field all that is here
attributed to this accomplished ancestor who died exactly a century
before my father was born. But that impulse which led me as a child
to play at being a preacher in church, later to propose, as the
only vocation that had any attraction at all for me, to enter the
Church, and has ever since made me a preacher in other fields, may
well be rooted, since it displayed itself so spontaneously, in a
inherited aptitude already displayed in a large number of ancestors
from whom I am doubly descended and, it would seem, with especial
completeness in. William Powle, who seems to have possessed also
the reasonableness of character, the judicial temperament, which
some have noted as traits of mine. The Peppens were distinguished
by their piety towards the past and their obstinacy in going their
own way in the present. Both these characteristics are certainly
pronounced in me, and I have sometimes wondered whether that
un-English (once, at least, Flemish) air which both English and
foreign acquaintances have noted in me may not be the atavistic
reminiscence of Walloon Pepins from whom the Peppens of Wenhaston
must assuredly have descended. The Peppens combined their
independent character and their ecclesiasticism with a certain eye
to the main chance, not only in the branch I belong to but in the
related and also clerical branches; thus one of these clergymen
married a baronet's daughter and assumed a crest, a Pegasus, and
what connection he found between Peppens and Pegasus I have
sometimes wondered. William Keble combined the Peppens' obstinacy
and devotion to principle with an indifference to consequences
which arouses my admiration, although I scarcely share his spirit
of exclusive partisanship; I specially admire the spirit in which
the old man, once driven forth from his living for his staunch
opposition to Puritanism, left a will so free from bitterness, and
was chiefly concerned that his trees should not be cut down.</p>

<p>Herewith I have presented the salient features of my remote
Suffolk ancestry: for the most part a distant crowd of scholars and
parsons, in recent times almost hidden from sight by men of the
sea.</p>

<p>The Olivers stand apart among these Suffolk families, the most
recent and the most apt for worldly success. If, however, they knew
how to make money, some of them knew how to waste it. They were
often, it seems, self-willed, reckless people, intolerant of
restraint. They sometimes met tragic ends; I vaguely recall hearing
of one, an officer in the army, who narrowly escaped being buried
alive on the West coast of Africa by the happy thought of someone
who before the burial rubbed him with cayenne pepper, but who was
shortly after blown up in an explosion at a fort in Jamaica. They
were high-spirited, perhaps a little insolent as well as reckless.
An Oliver, a young officer, once waited on Lord Cornwallis, himself
a Suffolk man, and then Commander-in-Chief, to beg his favour in
obtaining a commission. "You look as if you had come to confer a
favour rather than ask for it," Cornwallis observed. Physically
they tended to be large, imposing, portly people, not
handsome&mdash;with a mouth too long in upper lip&mdash;but with
deliberate vigour, with the air of grave responsibility which
sometimes marks the man of large and imperious physical organism.
It is a variety of the John Bull type. In their portraits they
stand with figures well drawn up and seeming to demand a certain
amount of space around them, by no means inviting approach. There
is a certain anxiety in their countenances, a certain physiological
discomfort, the expression of a massive restless organism, too
conscious of itself, which cannot but assert: I am I, in the spirit
of Marcus Aurelius's words: "As though the emerald should say:
Whatever happens I must be emerald," words I have so often found
myself murmuring through life, by no means necessarily in the
spirit of one who would preserve some immaculate purity, but in the
conviction that one's own peculiar instincts, good or bad, cannot
be violated. I recall my mother's only surviving uncle who was
completely of this type. He lived in Chelsea, having occupied an
official position at the Chelsea Hospital. He had formed a
relationship with his housekeeper, whom he never married but openly
had two sons by her. My mother, inflexible as were her own moral
standards, seems to have accepted this situation, and I never heard
her criticise it. I remember her taking me to Chelsea, and I
remember Uncle Oliver visiting us with his older son.</p>

<p>My grandmother, Susannah Oliver (afterwards Wheatley), was born
in 1788, the eldest child and only girl in a large family of
brothers who idolised her. In a miniature and two pencil portraits
she appears a woman of energy and intelligence and vivacity, with a
touch of melancholy in the eyes, but a witty and sensitive curve of
the lips, not formally beautiful but with the attraction that comes
of vitality and spirit. Her chief beauty was considered to be her
long and abundant hair, worn in clustered curls at the front and a
large mass on the top of the head, of auburn colour in the
miniature, but a soft mousy brown in the bracelet made of it which
I now possess. (The women of the Oliver family of to-day, I am
told, are still noted for their beautiful hair.) She was a capable
woman, and had a high-class school for girls she had set up in a
large old house at Leyton, then a rural suburb of London. I cannot
easily imagine her at the head of the prim academy for young ladies
we hear of as typical of these days, but I am not surprised at her
success. I recall the great gateway and the avenue of trees leading
to Suffolk House, as it was called, where my mother once took me as
a child to see her birthplace; it was pulled down a few years ago
to give place to rows of workmen's houses, but it still figures
with other large old vanished houses in the local Histories.
Susannah Oliver was a woman of culture and accomplishments. She
painted flowers in the delicate and commonplace Dutch manner of her
day; she played the harp, on which occasions her beautiful arms
aroused much admiration. Her tastes in literature especially were
fine and wide, ranging over many fields, scientific and artistic;
she seems to have bought the best literature of her day, and many
of the books that fed or aroused my own early thirst for knowledge
had her bookplate in them. Of these I note especially Rowlandson's
<i>Doctor Syntax,</i> on which I pored with concentrated interest,
Rousseau's <i>Reveries,</i> the first French book I ever read out
of school for my own pleasure, Maria Edgeworth's <i>Harry and
Lucy,</i> a cleverly written popularisation of science in story
form which I still vividly recall, and <i>Nature Displayed,</i> a
more technical, well illustrated but too concise summary of
scientific knowledge in numerous volumes, not excluding human
anatomy. I know it was too concise, for there, at the age of
twelve, I sought to satisfy my nascent curiosity concerning the
sexual organs of woman, but intently as I studied the brief account
given I was baffled, for I could not understand how a region which,
so far as I knew anything of it, was so bare could yet harbour so
many different objects with definite Latin names. My grandmother
was a friend of Miss Sarah Stickney, afterwards the wife of William
Ellis, the missionary whose books on Polynesia are still an
ethnological treasure-house, and herself one of the most
influential writers of the time. I doubt, however, if she could
have influenced my grandmother, for she was eleven years her junior
and had scarcely began to publish when my grandmother died. The
Stickneys were a Yorkshire Quaker family, but had relatives in
Suffolk, which doubtless accounts for my grandmother's association
with Sarah. Her mother, Esther Stickney, described in her
daughter's biography as "a refined and intellectual woman," died
when Susannah Wheatley was a girl of thirteen, but a miniature,
said to be of Mrs. Stickney, has descended to me, an attractive,
good-looking, mature woman, with calm, observant, self-possessed
eye, and softly rounded full chin. The Stickneys were Quakers of
the best type. My grandmother was anything but a Quaker; she was
something of a woman of fashion; she wore coal-scuttle bonnets of
the largest size, whence once an embarrassing difficulty in
entering a carriage; and on the eve of her wedding-day, being
obliged to have her hair dressed by the hairdresser the day before,
she sat up all night; she impressed her neighbours by appearing at
church every Sunday with a new pair of gloves, and it was known
that she tight-laced by fastening the laces to the bed-post; this,
indeed, it was said, conduced to her death in child-bed on the
birth of her third child at the age of a little over forty. This
child died young, and another, a boy, went to sea in a ship that
was never again heard of, so that my mother was the only surviving
child.</p>

<p>Susannah Oliver had married her sailor husband, John Wheatley,
late in life; it is perhaps characteristic of her impulsive and
dominating Oliver temperament that when, after the marriage, the
moment came for Captain Wheatley to go back to his ship she found
it impossible to let him go; he abandoned the voyage, and indeed
gave up the sea altogether for a. life of dignified indolence;
henceforth, instead of his ship's poop, he paced up and down the
garden walks at Leyton&mdash;as my father's brother, who sometimes
went to see him there when a boy, has described to me&mdash;in the
leisurely and stately manner natural to the fair, handsome,
imposing man whom I only know by his miniature, a very large man,
my uncle said, who spoke but little but, when he spoke, spoke well.
He was overwhelmed by grief at his wife's death, which caused
indeed an attack of brain fever; he could not bear to look at
anything that had belonged to her, and rapidly disposed of jewels
and much else that should have come later to my mother. But he
lived on for more than twenty years, marrying again a lively little
widow with a large family, named Parr, whom he had engaged to keep
on the school.</p>

<p>I know little else of my maternal grandfather, who was born in
1783 and died in 1853, six years before I was born. He had traded
chiefly in the Mediterranean, especially to Smyrna, whence he had
brought the stuff for his wife's wedding gown. Early in life he had
been taken prisoner during the French wars, and when I was a child
my mother would tell me how as a prisoner in France he was given
black bread which when thrown against the wall would stick to it,
and how he had at last escaped through the good offices of a French
girl, a certain Annette, possibly&mdash;though of that my mother
never hinted, and perhaps never knew&mdash;the sweetheart of the
fair and handsome Englishman. I would gladly have known the story
of that episode. (For his grandson also owes very much to a French
girl.) Doubtless it was due to his imprisonment in France, and in
part perhaps to Annette, that my grandfather wrote an easy and
fluent though incorrect French; he would write letters in French to
my mother as a schoolgirl&mdash;I possess some of them&mdash;and
playfully sign himself "Jean Houtclet." The Wheatleys generally, as
I know them, were a race of large and placid people, imposing to
look at in their natural and unostentatious dignity, but, unlike
the Olivers, of no great energy intellectual or practical. They had
long been settled in Durham and Sunderland. A John de Wheatley
figures in the roll of the famous Richard de Bury, Bishop of
Durham, in 1337, and John was the favourite Christian name of the
family, whose surname appears from time to time until a John
Wheatley from whom I can definitely trace descent came to light in
the seventeenth century and was succeeded by another of the same
name who married a Haswell, a prominent landed family of those
parts. Their son was my great-grandfather Ralph Wheatley, who about
1776 married Mary Havelock at Sunderland Parish Church; the
marriage, tradition says, was that of the handsomest couple of
their time in the town.</p>

<p>Sunderland was a great shipping centre, during the French wars
the chief ship-building place in the Kingdom, so that many fortunes
were made there. The Wheatleys were, above all, sailors (at least
two were drowned), merchants, sea-captains or naval officers,
shipbuilders, sailmakers. Ralph Wheatley became prosperous and
rich, leaving considerable property and a large family, of which my
grandfather was the youngest, and owing to that fact, and his
absence at sea, he seems to have received but a small share of the
paternal fortune. The only story that has come down to me of that
prosperous household (unless indeed it refers to an earlier
generation) has its point in the dignity especially associated with
the Wheatley family. It concerns a daughter of the house who,
suffering from flatulence, prepared herself a glass of hot spirits
and water, and laying strict injunctions on the housemaid to admit
no one into the drawing-room, there proceeded to pin up her skirts
round her waist (no drawers were worn in these days) and leisurely
drink her spirits, standing with her back to the fire; while thus
engaged a carriage drove up and the negligent housemaid or some
other servant ushered in one of the most eminently conventional and
respectable families in the neighbourhood. This story may
illustrate the customs of the time rather than the traits of an
individual young lady, for there is a charming picture extant by
Isaac Cruikshank presenting a young lady in the same attitude. I
may remark that in some later collateral branches of the Wheatley
family slight eccentricity was manifested. Ralph Wheatley's eldest
son, another Ralph, who became a sailmaker at, I think, Greenwich,
was said to be a man of unusual character, and of one of his
daughters, who was nicknamed "Sally Brass," many pranks were
narrated. Another cousin of my mother's may possibly have been
subject to these <i>fugues</i> which have of recent years been
studied as epileptic manifestations, for from time to time he would
mysteriously leave his wife and family and disappear. But though
there were many Wheatleys, for they tended to have large families,
there was no definite insanity. Except, indeed, that an Oliver once
became insane in old age, I cannot find traces of insanity,
scarcely of any gross nervous disease or pronounced mental
abnormality in any of the families from which I spring and am thus
suspicious of the statement, so often made, that there is insanity
in every family. It seems to me by no means so evenly distributed,
and that while there is a great deal of insanity in some families,
there is very little in others.</p>

<p>Ralph Wheatley, my great-grandfather, as I have mentioned,
married Mary Havelock. She was the aunt of the famous General
Havelock, who was thus my grandfather's first cousin. At this time
the Havelocks were also gaining prosperity as shipbuilders at
Sunderland, where the future general was born nineteen years later.
The Havelocks had long been scattered about this region, but the
chief centre of the family seems to have been Grimsby, and on the
seal of the Grimsby Corporation, beside Grime, the supposed founder
of the town, is seen the figure of a crowned youth Havlock, said in
the legendary Lay of <i>Havlok the Dane</i> to have been the lost
child of a great sea-king who, having been saved by fishermen,
became a cook-boy at Lincoln but, being recognised as the stoutest
man in England, married the young English princess Goldeburgh,
reigned for sixty years, and left fifteen sons and daughters, who
all became kings and queens. It appears that the boundary stone
outside Grimsby is still called the Havelock Stone. According to
later tradition the Havelock family descended from Guthrum, the
really historical Danish King of East Anglia in the days of Alfred
the Great, who converted him to Christianity. It is likely that
this tradition was in the mind of my mother's favourite cousin,
Nancy Wheatley, who told me in childhood that the Wheatleys were
descended from the Danish Kings of England. My mother gave me at
birth the name of General Havelock, not because of the relationship
but because of her admiration for him as a hero who, above all
soldiers of the time, had the reputation of being a devout
Christian. I am not sure that I have a concrete mental
representation of Sir Henry Havelock, who was not only a devout
Christian but a stern and capable general of the type of Cromwell's
Ironsides, with no objection to blow men from guns, nor am I
prepared to say that I have the slightest resemblance to him. The
only link I can find is that he was nicknamed by his schoolfellows
the Philosopher, which happens to be the name which my wife has
often playfully applied to me, and possibly a certain firm moral
tenacity which I certainly inherit from my mother. (And I have been
amused to note in Havelock's portraits a very prominent chin dimple
equally marked in me.) Havelock is the chief representative in my
family of the fighting element which played a considerable part on
my mother's side of the house, both the Wheatleys and the Olivers,
several of her uncles having been colonels and naval officers, one
of them with Nelson at Copenhagen. But none seems to have been in
the direct line of my descent.</p>

<p>One of my four grand-parental families I have still left
undescribed. It stands rather apart. I have found difficulties in
defining its characteristics and in formulating my own spiritual
relation to it, so that I was unable to feel much interest in this
family, with which indeed I have never come in contact and never
heard much about. I refer to the family of my father's mother, the
Grays of the Isle of Wight. My grandmother, whom I can barely
remember, was an excellent woman of colourless character whose life
was completely absorbed by domestic routine, and whose energies, I
imagine, would in no case have been conspicuous in any other
sphere. But she was the daughter&mdash;the sixteenth and youngest
child&mdash;of a really notable and superior woman, Sarah Gray, the
only person among my direct ancestors, so far as I know, of whom
anyone has ever thought it worth while to write and publish a
biography.*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* <i>Memoirs of Mrs. Sarah Gray, late of the
Isle of Wight.</i> Written by her granddaughter Eliza Morris.
Hammersmith, 1831, pp. 62. Price one shilling.]</p>

<p>The Grays were yeomen farmers long established, I believe, at
little Fields Farm near Carisbrooke, where, in the third quarter of
the eighteenth century, they were represented by Richard Gray, my
great-grandfather. In a neighbouring parish, his future wife Sarah,
the daughter of another farmer (the biographer strangely neglects
to mention either her maiden name or the name of the parish), was
born in 1759 at Quarry Farm. It is on the religious character of
this lady that her biographer chiefly insists, and too much else is
omitted, so that I can but echo the remark which Eliza Morris
herself puts into the reader's mouth: "The one half was not told
me."</p>

<p>Sarah was brought up as a member of the Church of England and
duly confirmed at the age of fifteen. But religion in those days
was a disturbing and even exciting element of life. The clergyman,
we are told, was "a man of very immoral habits," and so was
incapable of preaching the way of salvation, but he had evidently
attracted the enthusiastic devotion of his flock to the Church, for
when a preacher&mdash;no doubt, though we are not told so, one of
the new sect of Methodists&mdash;arrived in "the now highly
favoured but then destitute Island," and endeavoured to preach in
her parish, Sarah was desirous to hear him, but was "prevented by
the noise and tumult of the people," who evinced the malice and
enmity of their hearts against everything that was spiritual by
pelting the minister with stones and rotten eggs, and drowning the
sound of his voice by beating drums and kettles, so that he could
not proceed in his discourse, but turning himself to the scoffing
crowd, said with a firm voice: "I shake off the dust from my feet
as a testimony against you, and verily it shall be more tolerable
for Sodom and Gomorrah in the days of Judgement than for you, but I
am absolved from the guilt of your destruction." The young girl
wept much at the awful sentence thus pronounced by one who
evidently possessed the Keys of Hell, and not long after her
marriage in 1775 she "cast in her lot with the people of God,"
being therein followed by her husband. "Being greatly blessed in
their temporal circumstances," in course of time, with the aid of a
few friends, they built a chapel at Node Hill, which seems,
however, to have been some miles away from their house. Mrs. Gray
brought up sixteen children, not all of whom, we are told, showed
her religious faith, but they were a family of fine and robust
farmers, and my grandmother, who was the youngest, was also the
smallest. Mrs. Gray was something of a saint, but in the practical
English way. Her minister was the Rev. D. Tyerman, a remarkable man
whose name and work survive; he was sent out on a prolonged tour of
missionary inspection in the South Seas and died in Madagascar.
Sarah Gray seems to have accepted the doctrine of her Bible and the
Calvinistic principles of her sect, but she understood them in her
own personal way, and by the instincts of her own beautiful nature
she developed into a kind of mystic.</p>

<p class="poem">"In secret silence of the mind<br>
My Heaven and there my God I find,"</p>

<p>were lines she loved to repeat, and they are of the essence of
mysticism. "She was arrived at the highest state of Christian
perfection," we are told, but she necessarily lived a busy,
practical life in which every moment was occupied, an industrious,
economical and prudent housewife. "Her maxim was always to be doing
something for this world or the next," and "never to her
recollection did she lie in bed after the sun had risen." But while
thus labouring indefatigably in the details of domestic life on a
farm her outlook was large. She was not one of the trivially fussy
domesticated women. She possessed the gift of love. She never
sought to find fault with others and she practised religion rather
than talked about it; she was very liberal to the poor, though
generally in secret, and "never did she oppress the hireling in his
wages," but was always the friend of her servants. It was the love
of God that made the core of her religion. Upon that she would
dwell with ever new delight, and often repeat "God is love, and he
that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him." She also
loved Nature, and all the more during the last twelve years of her
life when, confined to her bed but unable to lie down&mdash;no
doubt affected by cardiac disease&mdash;she loved to have her
curtains open during her restless nights so that she might gaze on
the sky. She died in 1830 at the age of seventy. Her husband, who
died many years earlier, was the meet companion of this woman with
a genius for religion, so full of sweetness and loving-kindness.
"The pilgrims of olden time used to give Mr. Gray the honourable
appellation of the hospitable Gaius," and he always read, we are
told, a fragment of the <i>Pilgrim's Progress</i> and the Bible
every evening after the day's business was over. He was a
well-to-do man and left £1000 apiece to his very large family.
Several of his children emigrated to America, others were scattered
about England (though I have never been in touch with any of their
families), and I suppose it was in this way that Sophia met Edward
Ellis. They were married at Hackney&mdash;the then quiet and
dignified London suburb where old John Ellis retired and died (as
also later, it so chanced, my mother's father), about the year
1821, and became the parents of six children, four boys and two
girls, of whom my father, the fourth, was, I believe, born at
Bromley.</p>

<p>Of late I have meditated on the significance that the Grays may
have in my own ancestral inheritance. An intuitive woman, by no
means a mystic herself, remarked to me the other day that she
thought that if I had been less scientific I should have been a
mystic. It is not a fact that I have ever wished to obtrude, yet it
is a fact that there is no need for me to wait to be less
"scientific," for I am a natural mystic already by inborn
constitution as well as by actual experience. The religion of my
numerous clerical ancestors, however admirable and genuine,
approved indeed by persecution, was not, so far as can now be
discerned, mystical; it was in the best sense ecclesiastical. My
mother again, whose evangelical piety was so genuine and so
practical, so completely the ruling power of her life, was not a
mystic. In this matter I see in myself a faint reflection of that
inner light, so spontaneously kindled in the beautiful soul of my
great-grandmother, Sarah Gray.</p>

<p>The general distinctive fact about the Grays, however, was that
they were farmers or yeomen; Sarah Gray was herself a farmer's
daughter. In that respect the Grays were unlike the other families
from which I am descended. The Ellises, the Olivers, the Wheatleys
had not cultivated the soil for some two centuries, perhaps longer.
Putting aside trade and other miscellaneous occupations, the
prevailing vocation of my forefathers on both sides was the sea,
and behind that the Church. The sea has not played a large part in
the ancestry of the people who represent England to the world,
large as has been the part it has played in the life of England and
the English people. In the whole of British genius, in my study of
that subject, I have estimated the maritime ancestry as 1.9 less
than any other class, and few representative English people
proceeded from this ancestry, unless it may be Byron, William Penn,
Bishop Andrewes, and Stamford Raffles. In recent days I think of
Edward Carpenter as belonging to a naval family, but of no others.
My own complicated and far-spread maritime ancestry thus seems to
me rare indeed in the English spiritual field. To it I am inclined
to attribute a large part of what is in me characteristic. I seem
to myself peculiarly English, yet I have to acknowledge that I am
singularly unlike many other peculiarly English persons. That seems
to me due to the fact that I am English of the sea and they are
English of the land. That fluid, libertarian, adventurous,
versatile spirit I find in myself, the far sight, the wide outlook,
is English of the sea, the characteristic outcome of the sailor's
life. I miss the note of earthiness, so common in the English mind
and in the English style. It is not present in me even when I am
sensuous, even in the touch of the satyr or the faun my friends are
sometimes pleased, quite rightly no doubt, to find in me, for it is
not possible to one whose spirit is washed by the salt sea. I am
born of the water and the wind, precisely the elements that raged
furiously on the night I entered the world. The more typical kind
of Englishman is born of the earth, his eyes have been fixed on its
furrows, and not on the horizon; he deals with a hard and
rebellious element not to be conquered mainly by skill, by
adjustment, by reliance on Nature, but mainly by force, by muscular
toughness, by pertinacity, by stubbornness. There is all that
energy and tenacity in the typical Englishman, derived from his
struggle with the earth and something of the mud of the earth
usually remains bespattering his spirit. No doubt these qualities
have come to me, too, especially much obstinate tenacity, for men
far back in my ancestry tilled the soil; but they have had time to
be transformed and sublimated. The Grays alone represent&mdash;and
even then at a distance of three generations&mdash;a more recent
infusion of the farmer's temperament, an infusion doubtless useful
to qualify the rest.</p>

<p>Of even many details in my disposition it seems to me that the
sea is the ultimate basis. Mountains, which are most remote from
the sea, are antipathetic to me; the sea-like plains of Holland
(made by the sea if one thinks of it) satisfy me more than the
Andes and the Alps. I enjoy heights but it is because of their
outlook and space and atmosphere:</p>

<p class="poem">"all waste<br>
And solitary places; where we taste<br>
The pleasure of believing what we see<br>
Is boundless, as we wish our souls to be,"</p>

<p>are words I have always loved of Shelley, who was in youth my
poet of predilection, and Shelley&mdash;I know not why&mdash;is not
the poet of earth so much as of sea and air. My love of
purity&mdash;to be sure, in no prim and prudish sense&mdash;is an
attraction to a quality which is of the sea rather than of the
gross and muddy earth, and the quality of clinging tenacity towards
all that I have ever loved is only a form of that fidelity which
Conrad declared to be the chief virtue of the sailor.</p>

<p>On the whole, it may be seen, I represent on both sides the
outcome, in the main, of families of sailors and people connected
with the sea, while farther back, through both sides, is a long
line of parish priests, solid, scholarly, admirable men, tenacious
of their convictions, ready to suffer cheerfully for their devotion
to those convictions. In my blood the two latent streams of
tendency have entered into active combination and grown conscious
at last in my brain. So I have become an adventurer in morals and a
pioneer over spiritual seas.</p>

<p>In past years I have often puzzled over my own temperament and
wondered whether I am of weaker or stronger character than average
people. To-day I am no longer puzzled by the contradictory elements
in myself. I see that they are simply the sum of the tendencies I
have inherited from various families. At the core, doubtless, is
the rather dominating, emotional and instinctive energy of the
Olivers&mdash;for I have always felt that I derive the active side
mainly from my mother, but that has been tempered by the indolent
placidity&mdash;not without its underlying obstinacy, no
doubt&mdash;of the Wheatleys and considerably modified by the
easy-going nonchalance of the Ellises with the latent mysticism
beneath it of the Grays. I detect in myself a tenacious and
unyielding fidelity to the end or object or person that has once
touched me deeply enough to affect my emotions and instincts, but
on the surface I yield at a touch, and while I am prepared to
suffer anything for the personal and impersonal ends that have
really fascinated me, I am yet too lazy to move an inch out of my
way for other ends that yet seem to me wholly worthy. I am not
incapable, even, of a considerable dash of scepticism concerning
the ends for which I can never cease to labour. But any question of
weakness or strength becomes meaningless to me when I realise that
these various tendencies are simply the balanced play within me of
the Oliver strain, Wheatley strain, Ellis strain, Gray strain. I
can understand what Renan says of the places occupied in his own
temperament by unlike strains of Gascon and Breton.</p>

<p>I have said that, so far as mental aptitudes and tastes are
concerned, I trace my inheritance especially to my father's father
and my mother's mother, more remotely to the Suffolk rectors who
were my ancestors along both lines. The creative and productive
impulse was only latent in both of those grandparents but they had
the intellectual and artistic temperament, a temperament which my
father and my mother transmitted to me but themselves showed no
trace of. My father, Edward Peppen Ellis, possessed all the
mediocrity of his family, though in him it was revealed in an
almost golden form. As a child he was described, in the terms of an
old-fashioned mixed metaphor, as "the flower of the flock" in the
large family, and going to sea early, passing half a century in a
sailor's life, he developed a more open-air and genial personality
than his brothers&mdash;who all spent their lives in the Docks like
their father before them&mdash;and became the typical English
sea-captain of whom Sir William Butler remarks in his
<i>Autobiography</i> that he is the very best man that England
produces. He never knew what a headache was like; his teeth were
perfect until old age; he was never troubled by his digestion; no
serious illness or physical disability ever befell him. Neither
tobacco nor alcohol had any attraction for him, though on occasion
he would accept a cigar or a cigarette and appreciated an
occasional sherry and bitters until old age when he regularly took
a little whisky. He was equally cheerful and sociable&mdash;always
a great favourite with girls&mdash;content with what the days
brought forth, never seeking to go beyond the surface of the things
presented to him, though much contact with many kinds of people had
imparted to him a touch of good-humoured scepticism. I doubt if he
had ever read any poet but Pope, and while not uninterested in the
natural things which fell directly beneath his notice, the manifold
spectacle of life which he had seen under many aspects in many
parts of the world had left him almost untouched. He was not shrewd
or worldly or businesslike, outside his profession; he had availed
himself little of his opportunities to make money and his
investments were mostly unfortunate. After he retired from the sea,
with a small pension from Trinity House, losing at almost the same
time his iwo chief solaces, his ship and his wife, his life was for
some years rather unsettled and troubled, but the Ellis spirit and
his own temperament were finally reasserted. He went to live in a
boarding-house by the sea belonging to a niece, leading an
innocently gay and frivolous life, surrounded by young girls, an
Epicurean whose philosophy was unconscious. When well past seventy
he became attached to a lady, some thirty years his junior, and
their marriage was only prevented at the last moment by the
objection of the lady's relatives. But the couple remained
affectionate friends; he went to live in her house at Folkestone as
a lodger, and here he spent the remaining years of his life
peacefully and happy, surrounded by her devoted care, and seeing
his children from time to time. Once he went with her to Paris, for
he had never been there and he felt it was an experience not to be
missed. Frequently they would go up for a few days to London, where
he was indefatigable in sight-seeing, an eager visitor to theatres
and music-halls. His health remained unimpaired until the age of
eighty-seven. Then, shortly after the Great War broke out, he
passed through a phase of unwonted irritability of mood, and when
that disappeared it was found that he was suffering from cancer of
the liver. The final illness lasted only a few weeks and his mind
remained clear, fully conscious that the end was approaching, but
cheerful and even humorous. He never complained, and before the
last restless stages of discomfort he would say that he felt
ashamed of lying so comfortably in bed when there was so much
suffering in the trenches. He would speak to me of all the little
arrangements to be made after his death and was content and willing
to go, having, as he put it, "had a good innings." Of religion or
faith or hope of a future life there was never a word. He had never
been either religious or irreligious, having never felt any inner
need to be either, for he had never had any violent passions to
restrain or any exalted aspirations to pacify. He had simply
accepted, quietly and humbly, the religious conventions around him,
joining without question in all the devotions of my mother, for
whom he had the highest reverence. At sea he had conducted
religious services whenever he felt it his duty to do so, just as
under the like circumstances he had once or twice conducted a
midwifery case, for on board his ship in the absence of the
accredited representatives of those professions, the captain is
both priest and doctor. In his last years, as I learnt from what he
once told me, he had quietly and spontaneously become definitely
sceptical in matters of religion, but he was not sufficiently
interested in these matters to obtrude his conclusions on those
whom they might hurt, and to please the devoted friend with whom he
lived he cheerfully agreed to a visit from the parson. On the last
day I saw him he had just received the Sacrament and even in a
genuinely devout spirit. He was, however, as he certainly felt, in
no personal need of the ministrations of the clergy or the erncacy
of the ecclesiastical rites, for throughout life the Peace of God
had been his by nature. More than once during these last days he
said that at night, when lying awake in the dark, he seemed to see
his ship waiting for him to board her. So, at length, he finally
set sail. The Ellises, it may be seen, have no vices, but they buy
that exemption at a price, for one is inclined to ask whether, when
the right path is so easy to them, they really have any virtues.
Their strength lies in their imperturbable mediocrity. This, it
seems to me, at all events as here manifested, is a distinctively
urban quality. The Ellises, in their various branches, have lived
and survived through four or five generations in the heart of
London. To do this successfully needs exactly the temperament of
the Ellises, an indifference alike to the destroying ambitions and
the destroying excesses which ravage the souls and bodies of these
city-dwellers to whom the city is new. The Ellises still retain the
same qualities. Among my numerous cousins and their children the
girls are pretty and lovely, the boys, whatever their occupation,
have all the qualities of trustworthy bank clerks, They neither
rise nor fall.</p>

<p>I owe much to the mediocrity of the Ellises. It is true that, so
far from being cheerfully content with the surface of things, I am
a restless researcher below surfaces. I never live in the
present&mdash;my moments of happiness have all been in the past or
the future. But yet there has always been the precious modifying
influence of that Ellis temperament. The disposition that finds its
expression mainly in literary channels is usually tempted to adopt
a view of life that is one-sided, excessive, or eccentric. If I
have been able on the whole to maintain a wide and sunny view of
life, not merely to escape the greed of wealth or of honour, but to
temper the ardour of my faith and enthusiasm by a pervading
reasonableness&mdash;a scepticism which smiles at all my
failures&mdash;I think I owe it largely to that temperate and
cheerful acceptance of the world which is part of the mediocrity of
the Ellises. My life would have been happier had I possessed more
of it.</p>

<p>On that foundation, however, only rather negative qualities can
spring up. I have never doubted that I owe my more positive and
fundamental qualities to my mother. Intellectually, indeed, my
mother was not more distinguished than my father; but by her
character, by her instinctive and emotional qualities, she was of
an order much more rare and high.</p>

<p>In her early years my mother was a large, restless, active,
high-spirited girl; her aunt called her "volatile," and her brother
nicknamed her "the fish" because her activities led to her drinking
much water. (She was, like me, born early in February under the
sign of Aquarius.) So that there was clearly more in her of the
energy of the Olivers than of the placidity of the Wheatleys, but a
quiet massive energy with no restlessness in it after she reached
adult age. She grew up, however, untamed, at Suffolk House, Leyton,
in the large garden and orchard that throughout life remained with
her a memory of delight, and is now swept away, covered by the
eruption of mean streets from London. But at the age of seventeen
an event occurred which affected her whole life, and in a way which
I have sometimes thought was disastrous. She was "converted." No
doubt that process of emotional expansion and sublimation was
inevitable for one of her temperament; it was so even for me. But
with her, as not with me, the acquirement of emotional serenity and
joy was combined with adherence to a narrow and rigid creed.
Henceforward she was a strict follower of "Evangelical" principles
and practices. As current in her time, the Evangelical creed was
simple; beyond ordinary religious observance, it meant a firm
reliance on the Bible with an avoidance of all "worldliness."</p>

[HAVELOCK ELLIS'S PARENTS, 1885]</p>

<p>To my mother it was almost a kind of Quakerism without the
Quakers' eccentricities. She was naturally too tolerant and
liberal-minded to cherish fads and extravagances of thought or
action. Thus it was only in later years that she gave up her glass
of sherry or ale from a conviction of the evils of drink, and
though she never went to a theatre after the age of seventeen, she
used no pressure to prevent her children from following their own
inclinations in this and similar matters. But she had inevitably
cut herself off from the influences which might have made for a
larger development of her rich nature; soon after her conversion
she refused the attractive invitation of a rich aunt who wished to
take her on a visit to Paris; she would rather not go to so wicked
a city; for she always consistently acted by the light of her
principles. Essentially a Suffolk or at all events East Anglian
woman&mdash;a type in which vitality and character and fine
emotional impulse are sometimes happily combined&mdash;her full
development was arrested. The "volatility" of the young girl never
found its natural matured expression in the woman's life. Grave
though with no formal solemnity, reserved if not exactly repressed,
shy and nervous beneath the imposing presence she had inherited
from both her parents, she was yet a woman of unmistakable force of
character. Though she sought few friends, I doubt if she ever lost
any, and their devotion to her was deep. Her force was unconscious
and instinctive, perhaps all the more effective on that account.
This was clearly illustrated by her relations with her husband. The
affection on both sides was complete. She sincerely cherished all
the conventional views of wifely devotion and marital authority.
Yet when my father returned from his long sea-voyages she
instinctively remained the mistress of the house and he
instinctively fell into the position of a guest. However bravely he
might whistle and loudly call for his boots, it was not with the
easy assurance of mastership he shouted his orders on deck or
damned the steward below. He felt rightly enough&mdash;for she was
an excellent manager and organiser, equable in temper, always firm
but always kind&mdash;that at home she was the captain. Possibly
that may be why I have always been conscious of an element of
weakness in him. I know that he was able to live up to the sailor's
fidelity to duty and I never heard that he was guilty of any act of
weakness in other relations of life. If, however, he came safely
through, I am assured it was by the happily balanced temperament of
the Ellises and not by virtue of strong character or high
principle. But my mother, I always knew, was a tower of strength.
Throughout life I have possessed an instinctive and unreasoned
faith in women, a natural and easy acceptance of the belief that
they are entitled to play a large part in many fields of activity.
The spectacle of my mother's great and unconscious
power&mdash;resting on the fact that the same emergence of capable
womanhood occurred among my ancestors and perhaps, indeed,
charactetised the region they belonged to, since Suffolk has
produced so notable a proportion of English women of
ability&mdash;certainly counted for much in that faith and that
belief.</p>

<p>Although my mother could never have been
beautiful&mdash;probably less so when young than in the dignity and
repose of mature life&mdash;she had numerous suitors, certainly by
no means drawn merely because she was a ward in Chancery with a
small portion of £2,000 (coming from the Olivers) settled upon her,
but by her really attractive qualities of impulsive energy combined
with solidity of character. "Never marry a sailor," her father used
to say to her. A few years after his death, she followed,
nevertheless, lier mother's example. A sailor alone of her wooers
won her hand and she married my father, who had just become captain
of his first ship at the age of twentyeight, while she was two
years younger. It was probably the only serious act of disobedience
to her father she ever committed, but she certainly never repented.
If in later years, as I am inclined to think, she realised with
some sadness that her husband was not altogether the ideal she had
once dreamed, that happens to most women who possess an emotional
and idealistic temperament. I know, nevertheless, that the three
months of the year my father spent at home&mdash;the round voyage
usually lasting about nine months&mdash;were always to my mother a
long-expected period of happiness, a kind of annual honeymoon. Thus
when together they always remained like young lovers. I count it my
good fortune that never once in the home-life of my childhood was I
the witness of any conjugal jar. The unimpaired reverence for women
and respect for domestic relationships, with which I set out,
permanently coloured my whole conception of life.</p>

<p>When I survey my ancestral stocks as a whole from the eugenic
standpoint I can find little that seems in the slightest degree
unbalanced or unsound. In no direction is there any obvious special
liability to disease, and in 211 branches there is a fair, though
not extreme, degree of longevity. I write this in my forty-third
year, in good health and in entire freedom from any organic
disease, and I consider that&mdash;if I am to die a natural
death&mdash;I may reasonably expect to live until I am sixty. As
regards mental soundness, I see no definitely weak point. It has
often been said in my time that an insane heredity is without
significance because insanity is found in all families. If one goes
far enough it is certainly true that one must needs find insanity
at last, but in an unqualified shape the statement is misleading.
One of my numerous cousins, whose mother was an Ellis, once fell
for a time into a condition that might well be called insane, but
this girl's father belonged to an unquestionably morbid family. As
far as I know, the Grays were a sound family, while such morbid
traits as the Wheatleys presented were slight, and the restless
energy of the Olivers never degenerated into insanity in any member
at all nearly related to me. In my mother there was a latent
nervousness which I have inherited in a heightened degree; it
renders me in some ways an abnormal person, though scarcely morbid.
This nervousness is the servant of my intellect and disciplined by
my will; it is never likely to be degraded into insanity. I dimly
feel that, however wide and apparently eccentric the orbit in which
it seems to move, my life will in the end be found to have followed
a rounded harmonious course, at one with Nature.</p>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>Chapter Two</h2>

<p>I was the eldest child and only boy of a family of five, all
still living.* My birth took place four years after the marriage of
my parents and was, I believe, preceded by a miscarriage. The newly
married couple had taken a little semi-detached flint house (1 St.
John's Grove), in a quiet street in old Croydon leading up to the
venerable Parish Church, which had not then been burnt out, and so
much of its ancient beauty list. This small old Surrey town was
then chiefly known as once an ancient seat of the Archbishop of
Canterbury and later of a Military Academy at Addiscombe which
disappeared shortly before my time. It has since become the chief
suburb of London, and the healthiest town of its size in the
kingdom, a position it partly owed to Dr. Alfred Carpenter, an
ardent sanitary reformer, who was our family doctor. Throughout the
rest of his life he never forgot the wild stormy night which
preceded the 2nd of February, 1859, when I was born at a quarter
past eight in the morning.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* My sister Louie has since died (1928).]</p>

<p>The year 1859 was long known as the year of the great comet, but
it is now more permanently and famously known as the year of the
publication of Darwin's <i>Origin of Species,</i> one of the
greatest dates in the whole history of science. But that is far
from exhausting the memorable events which were crowded into that
most fruitful year, not only in various branches of science but in
life and art, in thought and literature, even in religion. In the
world of action this was the year of Italian Unity; the Red Cross
Society was founded by Dunant and the first Cottage Hospital built;
Dr. Elizabeth Blackwell, the first English woman doctor (whom later
I met), was placed on the English Medical Register; the Suez Canal
was commenced. In religion it became known among Evangelical
revivalists as "the Glorious Year," while by the simultaneous
publication of <i>Essays and Reviews</i> there began also the
spiritual revival of the Anglican Church. In the sphere of thought
J. S. Mill published his <i>Essay on Liberty</i> which has been
well described as "the most spendid statement of the ideal of
Individualism." In literature George Eliot and George Meredith both
published what are in some respects their most characteristic and
famous novels, <i>Adam Bede</i> and <i>Richard Feierel,</i> while
yet more significant was the publication by Fitzgerald of the
<i>Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam,</i> and this immortal little book
appeared in the midst of the fine poetic work of Rossetti, William
Morris, and Swinburne, which marks the close of that decade. It was
in 1859, again, that Mistral's beautiful and ever memorable
<i>Mireille</i> appeared. In art Millet painted "L'Angélus," and
Whistler produced his Thames etchings, both works which profoundly
influenced the following half century whatever may be ultimately
thought of them, while the date is also historic, Pennell has
remarked, for it is that of the publication of <i>Once a Week,</i>
which began the era of good illustration. It is, however, in pure
science, after all, that the year 1859 displayed the most varied
and memorable activities. The new spectroscopic astronomy began
under Kirchhoff and the sun's chemical composition was discovered;
Hoffmeister laid the foundations of the morphology of plants; the
definite triumph of the belief in the antiquity of Man took place
by Boucher de Perthes' at first questioned discovery of
palaeolithic instruments being finally proved, so that in 1859, as
Gaudry says, "the study of fossil man began;" Broca founded the
Société d'Anthropologie de Paris and therewith originated the
scientific study of anthropology; the first journal of folk-lore
was established in Germany; and Kuhn, the founder of comparative
mythology, published his chief work, <i>Ueber die Herabkunft des
Feuers;</i> Moreau de Tours initiated the psychological study of
genius; and Lombroso conceived that idea of the anthropological
method of studying criminals and other abnormal groups which in its
transformations has proved so fruitful. Nor are the intellectual
energies of this great year herewith exhausted. It would probably
be difficult to name any one year in the whole history of mankind
in which the human spirit was more profoundly stirred to more
manifold original achievement. It seemed worth while to me to
enumerate some of these achievements in order to indicate the
spiritual atmosphere into which I was born, the atmosphere in which
I was bathed, for it was as I grew up that the significance of
these achievements began to be perceived.</p>

<p>I entered the world in a raging tempest, but however symbolic
that omen may or may not have been for my life, there was nothing
obviously tempestuous about the infant. I was a large child with a
large head, as it still remains, so that labour proved tedious and
the forceps were used. I remained a large fine healthy baby,
suckled at the breast, and deserving, my mother was told, a prize
at the baby show then being held, In the earliest portrait, a
daguerreotype long since lost (I had lent it to Olive Schreiner,
and in one of her sudden migrations from lodgings she left it
behind), I looked out into the world from my mother's lap in all
the robust and fearless selfsatisfaction of babyhood. It was,
however, the only portrait in which I ever manifested that
attitude. In the next, dating a year or so later, one sees a rather
sad, puzzled, and forlorn little child placed on a large chair and
carefully dressed in a frock and an ornamental hat with rosettes
coming down over the ears. It is clearly the same child that stands
before us in the next picture, though now grown more intelligent
and more self-possessed, a little fellow in knickerbockers, no
longer fat, and with a restless, nervous, anxious look on his face.
It is a look of which I seem to find the incipient trace in the
Olivers, and henceforth, even if not obvious, I think it is still
usually latent. The eyes are those of a sensitive traveller in a
strange land, eager indeed for friendly response, but always
apprehensive of hostility. Of Nature I have never been afraid. But
the world has always seemed to me to be full of strange human
beings, so unknown, mysterious, and awe-inspiring, so apt to give
joy or pain, so apt also to receive either. I have always felt a
mixed reverence and fear of human creatures, so that I have
sometimes even been afraid to look into the eyes of strangers; they
seemed to me gates into chambers where intimate and terrible
secrets lie bare.</p>

<p>It is probable that the change I have noted in my expression and
appearance was connected with a change in my health. I was a very
robust baby, but I was a somewhat delicate child. I cannot recall
what the symptoms were, I think they were rather vague. But I know
that my mother took me from time to time to a London physician who,
so far as I can recall, spoke reassuringly. My earliest
recollection dates from the age of about two years, or perhaps
earlier. We were moving into a new house&mdash;evidently the ugly
little semi-detached villa, now replaced by shops at the Addiscombe
end of Cherry Orchard Road, which is the earliest house I
recall&mdash;and the nursemaid who was carrying me placed her
burden for a moment on the kitchen dresser. The novelty of that
lofty and unusual position furnished the first stimulus to
perception strong enough to last permanently in memory. (Rather
similarly, Ibsen's earliest memory was of being carried by his
nurse to the top of a church tower.) There are other recollections
that are faint, often trivial. I recall the little Chinese figure
of a crouching monkey in soapstone which my mother would give me
from off the mantelpiece, as later to her other infant children in
succession, to play with in bed in the early morning; somehow the
feel of it seems as though it had moulded my fingers to sensation.
I recall, for some unknown reason, when still a small child in a
frock, running round and round the table till I was tired. I
recall, too, the eldest of my baby sisters who appeared when I was
four. "Take away that piece of dirt and rubbish," I am said to have
exclaimed with the jealousy of childhood. That feeling seems soon
to have passed. I can only remember my baby sister as the object of
my care and attention.</p>

<p>These memories are vague. The only definite memory of this time
is of once accompanying the nurse who was wheeling the perambulator
with the baby along Morland Road. The nurse stood still and I heard
a mysterious sound as of a stream of water descending to the earth.
I recall no feeling of interest or curiosity on my part, but the
fact that I recall the incident at all seems to indicate that at
that moment I was for the first time touched by the strange mystery
of woman. It was not till years later that I felt any interest or
curiosity in women or in any aspect of sex, however childish. For
my mother I had always an equable and unquestioning affection,
which seems to have been entirely free from any of those
complications to which the child's affection for his mother is now
supposed to be liable, even though it may be in part true that it
is out of such affection, and on the model of such affection, that
the youth's late sexual love of woman is moulded. There was no
physical intimacy, her love for her children was not of the petting
kind, and there were never any curiosities on my part; when these
later arose they were turned in other directions. Nor was there
ever any trace of jealousy on my part with regard to my father.
That indeed may in any case have been excluded by the fact that he
was such a stranger in his own house. We saw but little of him, and
we always accepted him, as a matter of course and willingly, though
there was little or no opportunity for warm affection to spring up,
for even during his stays in London he had to be away all day at
the ship or the office, and Sundays were too formal and sacred to
be conducive to intimacy.</p>

<p>There was, I believe, nothing remarkable or precocious about my
childhood, though I easily learned to read at the age of five. I
was a fairly active child, and it was noted as a peculiarity of my
gait that in running I would take a little leap every few steps;
the latent tendency to this movement seems to remain with me still.
Perhaps the most characteristic incident in my early childhood,
which impressed my mother for she would refer to it in after years,
occurred when I once stood stock-still in the middle of the road,
for no obvious reason, and for some time could not be induced to
move. I do not recall this manifestation of instinctive obstinacy,
but in it I clearly detect myself. It may well be to this grim
silent persistence, deaf to persuasion, that I owe whatever little
success I may have achieved in preserving intact my own
individuality and carrying out my own projects, with indifference
to the shifting attitudes of society or the law.</p>

<p>Yet in these trifling childhood memories&mdash;my own and those
of others in regard to me&mdash;there was nothing uncommon to
childhood. I was just a rather shy, sensitive, reserved,
welldispositioned child, not goody-goody, but completely free from
any of the mischievous tricks of childhood (though once, for no
remembered reason, I threw my boots into the fire), and equally
without any impulses of pugnacity, such as are regarded as the
proper attribute of immature virility. I was more disposed to be
helpful than to fight and I remember how once in the Morland Road a
boy and a girl of the working class, carrying a basket of washing,
invited me to help by carrying one end which, without question, I
immediately did, and was afterwards, when I arrived home late,
mildly reproved by my mother. In all this I was far from being a
weak, sickly, or psychically morbid child, and in physical
development I was always above the average. But in what the doctors
called "stamina" I was below the average; I had no exuberance of
physical energy, no strong impulse to muscular exercise or games,
though I joined in them when it was not easy to refuse, and this
was combined with some degree of muscular awkwardness. I was, I
believe, naturally left-handed; I have never been able to throw a
ball with my right hand, and though I have never written with my
left hand, my right-handed use of the pen was always the despair of
my teachers. All my energy seems to have been in my brain, and that
was rather of the massive and receptive than of the impulsive and
active sort. With such a temperament it was natural that reading
soon became my preferred pleasure, and I had no brothers or
boyfriends to incite me to more social amusements.</p>

<p>One other trivial incident of childhood, when I was about six,
may be mentioned, because it made a clear and lasting impression on
my mind and represented my first introduction to art, which later
became so keen an interest in my life. The twin villa to ours in
Cherry Orchard Road was occupied by a fair, consumptive,
newly-married young artist called Robert Barnes. He belonged to the
great circle which from the year 1859 so brilliantly revived
wood-engraving in England. Like many others of the group, he was
also a painter; we were sometimes in his house, he introduced my
sister, who was a pretty child, into some of his drawings, and it
was on his easel that I first saw a freshly painted picture; I
remember it still, an old woman outside a cottage door with a bird
in a basket cage by her side. He gave me a volume of Mrs.
Barbauld's which he had illustrated, and I still possess it. A
little later Robert Barnes became a highly successful artist in
black and white; he was prodigiously active and, though he had no
great brilliance or originality, there was a delicate individuality
in his gracious and homely pictures; when we were children of a
little higher age, and he was illustrating many of the current
magazines, we had no difficulty in detecting his hand immediately.
His health improved, he became prosperous, and had a large family;
it so chanced that when finally we moved to the house at Redhill in
which my mother died, a house of much the same character as that in
Cherry Orchard Road, Robert Barnes and his family were occupying a
large and handsome house in the neighbourhood and the old friendly
relationship was resumed after an interval of a quarter of a
century. I have sometimes thought that I ought myself to have been
an artist, but this early contact incited no artistic ambitions,
though as a child, like many other children, I delighted in a
paint-box and experienced that peculiar sensitive reaction to the
qualities of different pigments which is probably common among
children. My mother never cared to make her home on board ship, but
when I was seven years old it was decided, doubtless for the
benefit of my health, that I should accompany my father on a voyage
round the world in the <i>Empress,</i> an American-built wooden
sailing-ship, belonging to Holder Brothers, which he then
commanded. On this voyage my father was to take from Queenstown to
New South Wales a large number of Roman Catholic passengers,
including several bishops, numerous priests, and many nuns. Up to
this point the memories of childhood that remain with me are few
and for the most part trivial. But from this moment they become
extremely numerous, indeed almost continuous, and though surrounded
as it were by haze they are much more vivid than before.</p>

<p>When I think of these days a number of pictures come on my mind:
Sister Agnes, the gentle quiet nun who had charge of my education
during the passage, and was later, as a priest has since told me,
at the head of a convent;* the good-natured old Mother Superior,
who was always giving me little presents, some of which I still
preserve; Father Doyle, a merry middleaged ecclesiastic who was
never tired of playing innocently mischievous pranks; it may
possibly have been he who incited me to pull the whiskers of a
solemn gentleman called Walsh, who promptly boxed my ears; these
are but a few of the many persons on board who all stand out
clearly in memory.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* More than sixty years later, and after her
death, it was stated in Australian newspapers that she remembered
me well to the end and used to tell of my little childish pranks.
It is strange to me that she should have been able to identify
Harry Ellis, the captain's young son, with the later author
Havelock Ellis, and I have wondered if there was not somewhere here
a touch of Irish imagination; but I like to think that I may have
been with her a pleasant memory to the end, as she also will be to
me.]</p>

<p>Not the least vivid is the kindly German steward, simple-minded,
well educated, and capable&mdash;a most typical German&mdash;who
was much concerned for my mental improvement and lent me
beautifully illustrated books of natural history because he thought
I read toi many stories. Nothing stands out more clearly in memory
than the ship's library in my father's cabin. This was the finest
treasure-house I had yet come on, and I was free to search in it as
though my own. Here I found Hans Andersen whom I read with delight,
but with still greater delight Marryat's <i>Masterman Ready,</i> a
story of the <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> type and by far the most
ravishing book I had yet discovered.</p>

<p>Of Sydney, though there my father had various old friends to
whom I was taken, my memories are fainter.* But from Sydney we
sailed to Callao and the Chincha Islands to load guano for Antwerp,
and here my memories are much more numerous and vivid than those of
Sydney. Here I first came within reach of the far-off echoes of
that old-world Spain which afterwards became so fascinating to
me.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* I may here remark that what is perhaps my
earliest extant letter was written home from the <i>Empress</i> at
Sydney in October, 1866. It is substantially much the same kind of
letter I might write now. "I like travelling," I wrote, "though I
should not wish to be a sailor," and after expressing admiration
for Sydney, I added: "I was much amused with the trees in the
Government gardens, reading their names and the countries they came
from, some of them with more flowers than leaves, and the others
very curious." I still find amusement in a similar occupation. It
is strange to note that below my signature appears a flourish which
is the obvious original of that I now use.]</p>

<p>I recall the penetrating and pungent odour of the guano which
filled the air all day long on board ship, the most massive odour I
have ever known. I recall the old coloured woman who sold fruit on
the island and always gave me a large bunch of black grapes, until
at last I grew tired of grapes and refused any longer to accept her
presents; even yet I have not recovered any taste for black grapes.
I recall, again, how my father took me with him to Lima where the
great Spanish gateways leading into the <i>patios</i> especially
appealed to me, and it seems significant to me now that the first
really foreign city I ever saw should have been one of Spanish
tradition. Here, too, I first saw great mountains; the enormous
range of the Andes seemed to rise from the coast and frown over the
ship; I used to watch these mountains intensely and remember how I
vainly sought to make out through the glass the nature of the
moving spots my keen eyes could just discern on the mountain
slopes. There are other memories of Callao and the Chinchas. Here I
first had a boy companion of about my own age, son of a captain who
was an old friend of my father's; sometimes we were allowed to take
the dinghy and go round among the rocks on the island coast,
gathering great starfish and all the strange living things we could
find. My companion, I remember, once confided to me his scatologic
interests in his own person, but I was but mildly
interested&mdash;not repelled, merely indifferent; the association
of grace and beauty would have been needed to arouse my interest.
This same boy also confided to me his habit of what I, much later,
learned to know was commonly called masturbation, though, as he
told me, it was simply a method of promoting the wholesome
development of the organs, an object which seemed to me entirely
praiseworthy. On his recommendation I attempted, with the best
motives, to follow his instructions, but the results were
fortunately in every respect completely negative; so that I soon
abandoned my attempts and thought no mire of the matter. In this
connection I should also mention&mdash;for it is all that there is
to mention&mdash;that during the voyage I sometimes associated with
an amiable quiet apprentice about fifteen years of age, and I
recall on one or two occasions when we were alone together that he
permitted or possibly encouraged me to insert my hand into his
trousers and gently to touch his sexual organs; my feeling was
simply one of reverent admiration for what seemed to my childish
mind their magnitude. There was another apprentice, a clever youth
rather older, who would tell me long stories as we walked up and
down the deck; the only one I recall (probably because he told me
not to repeat it) was slightly indecent and dealt with the
embarrassment of a young married couple over the problem of
undressing together on their wedding night; the story went no
further and seemed to me complete; sexual problems had no interest,
or rather no existence, for me at this age, and for years after. It
was at Callao, or the Chinchas, that I found my first girl
playmate, a captain's daughter whose name I no longer remember. But
I well remember the hours I spent with her on the poop, hidden in a
great sail, where we played at keeping house, always with natural
decorum; she was just a congenial playmate for whom I felt no
further emotions of affection or admiration; indeed it is
satisfactory to me to recall that throughout my childhood to the
age of twelve, however nervous a child I may have seemed, all my
emotions were wholesomely undeveloped and blunt, never at any point
exasperated into acute sensibility. But it was on this coast of
Peru, it seems to me, at the age of seven, that I first gained full
self-consciousness; I was beginning to become a person.</p>

<p>On leaving Callao we had a passenger, a young Englishman called
Whelock, whose name remains with me because I associate it with one
of those unaccountable impulses of obstinacy which seem to have
been in my original nature. I recall him as a kind and gentle and
well-bred man; there was apparently something to me antipathetic
about him. He gave me a novel by Mrs. Craik, <i>A Noble Life,</i>
in the Tauchnitz Series. It was an altogether kindly act, yet for
some reason, which has always been completely obscure to me, I
refused to thank him, and for a long time would not touch the book,
though I ultimately read it. Some latent cause there must have been
for my ungraciousness&mdash;possibly it was shyness taking on the
form of rudeness&mdash;but I have never known what it was. I recall
another obscure impulse of a more definite character manifested at
some time during the voyage. There was a large cat on board, a
favourite with the sailors, who had fastened various objects round
its neck. One day I was watching this cat making his way between
the rails at the ship's stern; he was sure-footed, but the position
was perilous, a touch would send him into the sea. Moved by a
sudden impulse, when the cat was passing to the seaward side of the
rail, I supplied that touch. I at once went to my father and told
him the cat had fallen overboard and a rope was thrown over, but
the cat had already disappeared. No one suspected me of any part in
the cat's death, and I never revealed to anyone&mdash;I believe
unto this day&mdash;that I was guilty in the matter. I have always,
however, regarded it as a criminal act. One other action of my
childhood&mdash;occurring, I think, a little later, after my return
home&mdash;I may mention here to complete the criminal record. My
mother kept a purse containing pence behind the clock on the
sitting-room mantelpiece for convenience in paying small household
expenses. One day&mdash;calmly, without a struggle, and possibly
even without sense of wrong-doing&mdash;I helped myself to pence
from this purse and bought and ate some pears, a fruit for which I
still retain a special liking. I was discovered&mdash;I am not even
sure whether I maintained concealment&mdash;and no doubt duly
punished. This remains in my mind as an objective incident, and I
have no recollection of its subjective side. It was evidently an
unreasoning impulse, aroused by a sudden irresistible desire for
the pears seen in the shop. But I have no other memories to
indicate that I was ever greedy. In this sphere they are only of
antipathies, as with the black grapes, and also a permanent dislike
of seed-cake, sago pudding, and bread and jam; and though I had
early acquired an ineradicable tendency, which probably contributed
to my liability to indigestion, to eat fast, this was not
attributable to greediness.</p>

<p>These two incidents of my childhood have been useful to me in
showing how impulses which can only be called criminal are always
liable to arise in childhood; they clearly have little significance
and should not be treated too seriously. They come to me out of the
past, detached from their environment, almost like dreams. This
also is true of my memory of the first time I saw a corpse. As the
ship sailed swiftly past, I observed the floating body, as it
seemed to me, of a negro in a red shirt, though the negroid effect
may possibly have been due to discoloration; I alone saw it, and
with my characteristic reticence said nothing about it.</p>

<p>From Callao the <i>Empress</i> conveyed its freight of guano
round Cape Horn to Antwerp. I recall nothing of the voyage except
that one day near the Horn I nearly cried from the bitter cold. But
of Antwerp memories crowd too thickly for record. It was the first
foreign city I ever really lived in. The magnificent Docks and the
great Promenoirs were not then built, but otherwise the essential
features of the riverside seem to remain the same to-day as they
were then. On arrival my father took me on shore with him to stay
for a few days at a little hotel facing the quay, kept by Flemish
people. I remember the landlady's two buxom daughters, their busy
ways, the perpetual "Ja! Ja!" shouted amid banging doors. An event
which is always important in a child's life happened at Antwerp. My
father took me and the two girls of the house to my first circus. I
vividly recall the unending stream of whooping horsemen who wildly
stamped round the ring, disappearing on one side to re-emerge on
the other, and I recall, too, how the involuntary exuberance of my
delight was enjoyed by the two girls at my side. Evidently at the
time I had not acquired the undemonstrative impassibility which,
however strong my emotion, I was subsequently wont to show, just
as, also, I had scarcely acquired my shyness, for on the
<i>Empress</i> I used to sing in public, with much enjoyment, to
the accompaniment of the piano, a social achievement I cannot
imagine at any later period. A few days later my father took me
home with him by Harwich. He was to bring the family back to
Antwerp, but my mother doubtless wished to see me without a day's
unnecessary delay. It is perhaps characteristic of the random and
inconsequent impressions of a child's mind that while I recall
vividly my return to the Addiscombe house&mdash;the end house on
the Croydon side of Addiscombe Terrace&mdash;the appearance of the
dining-room grown small and unfamiliar in my eyes, the look of the
spread table, even the salt-cellars, I have not the faintest memory
of the meeting with my mother after a yearlong absence. Affection
is undeveloped in early life.</p>

<p>We all went over at once, with the nurse-girl, to Antwerp, to
spend there many weeks of the summer of 1867 while the ship was
unloading, a much slower process than it has since become. We
lodged in a little house on the outskirts of the city not far from
a large bare tract on which ruined forts were still standing, a
district which is now probably that covered by fashionable streets.
One morning before breakfast, in the gratification of one of my
earliest impulses of scientific curiosity, I resolved to count the
number of cannon-ports in a large deserted old fort. Placing a
good-sized stick on the ground, so that I might know when my task
was completed, I carefully proceeded to march round, counting the
holes as I went. But after continuing this process for some time I
realised that I had missed the stick and looking around in
bewilderment I had some difficulty in orienting myself. By the time
that was accomplished I fear scientific curiosity had evaporated
and I quickly went back to breakfast.</p>

<p>It was a very hot summer and I recall the sensation of being
kept awake by the heat&mdash;though I had never suffered from heat
in the tropics&mdash;in the close bedroom where we children and the
nursemaid slept in separate beds, while the interminably long
goods-trains (I had succeeded in counting the number of wagons in
these) rattled on the railway line not far off. This weather
brought on an attack of diarrhoea, and I recall the deliciously
blissful sensations, such as I have never experienced since even
after a large dose of the same drug, produced by the chlorodyne my
mother administered to me. About the same time I had my first
attack of the severe nose-bleeding which reappeared at intervals
until my departure from Australia fourteen years later. On this
first occasion we were out with Jack, the big sailor boy who
sometimes looked after us, and he lent me his huge pocket
handkerchief on this long dreary walk. I experienced more illness
and discomfort on this brief visit to Antwerp than during all the
vicissitudes of the long voyage round the world, which seemed to
have suited me perfectly.</p>

<p>My mother had not been to Antwerp before, I doubt even if she
had been abroad before, though she several times went to Antwerp
and to Hamburg afterwards, and she desired my father to show her
all the sights. I sometimes accompanied my parents to the churches
and to the Picture Gallery, an oldfashioned and unpretentious
building very unlike the present Royal Museum. Only one picture
remains in my memory, and that doubtless because my mother, who
always had an engraving of it in her bedroom, must have observed it
with special attention: Rubens' Descent from the Cross in the
Cathedral. I mention this because a little point of psychological
interest in relation to memory is connected with it. I never
visited Antwerp again till fifteen years later, but when I once
more saw the "Descent" hanging in the transept, I was astonished to
find it was by no means either so large or so high up as in the
memory I retained of it. To the small child everything seems larger
than to the adult, and the world is a different place. (Probably
also it is a different place to the small as compared to the large
adult.) Nearly twenty years elapsed before I saw the picture a
third time, but the second interval involved no readjustment of my
impression.</p>

<p>After we returned home to Addiscombe I was again sent to Mrs.
Granville's school in St. James's Road whither I had gone for a
short time before the voyage. At this period the memories of my
life and my school grew ever more numerous and definite. The
persons and characters of my teachers&mdash;a Miss Frowde, a Miss
Cox, a Miss Bell&mdash;still stand out vividly in my mind. I could
describe their appearance and their widely varying characters, and
one or two of my schoolfellows are almost as distinct. But this
moment of my life scarcely seems of special significance for later
development and it is unnecessary to dwell on it. I have described
even trivial details of the voyage on the <i>Empress</i> when
memory first began to be stable because there is always a certain
interest in the beginnings of things, but it would be tedious, and
quite unnecessary, to record minutely the ever-growing stream of
later memories, even if such a detailed record were possible.</p>

<p>One or two memories of the school are perhaps of some
significance. I remember that a schoolfellow called Smith&mdash;it
was my first acquaintance with that large and admirable
family&mdash;took me off with himself and his brother to play
cricket, talking seriously to me of the importance of skill in
games; he had evidently observed&mdash;what I had myself
discovered&mdash;that I had no natural expertness in physical
exercises. I also remember that Mrs. Granville&mdash;who was a
remarkable old lady and professed great admiration for Pestalozzi
and his methods&mdash;once asked my mother if I was quite right in
my head. The idea seems to have been suggested to her by her
misapprehension of one of the games played in the schoolground, and
no defect in school was alleged. My mother was indignant at the
suggestion, quite naturally and reasonably, for it was never made
by anyone else at that time, however "odd," at a later period, some
people may have considered me. Still, it is possible that this
shrewd and intelligent old lady ought to have the credit of first
detecting in me whatever strain of mental anomaly I may
possess.</p>

<p>At Addiscombe Terrace there was a long, though not large,
garden, with a door in the wall at the end leading into a road at
the back. It was well stocked with apple-trees and plum-trees, and
cherry-trees against the wall; while a large guelder-rose, at the
end of the little lawn, always impressed my youthful mind by the
vastness of its white globular blossoms. We children had each our
own tiny patch of ground to cultivate, and we bought little plants
to put into them; the polyanthus is associated in my mind with this
epoch, and the eschscholtzia, which, however, I avoided, for its
virulent orange flowers, and its strange glabrous stalks with their
thin milky juice, inspired me with ineffaceable repulsion. My
mother was always fond of flowers and gardens and
orchards&mdash;though she scarcely seems to have been much
influenced by this love in her choice of houses&mdash;and often
spoke of the great garden and orchard at Leyton in which her
childhood had been passed. A cottage in the country with a large
garden remained her unfulfilled ideal to the last. It has been left
to me to attain.</p>

<p>An incident which occurred in this garden may be recorded
because, simple as it was, it is unique in my life. It was probably
about a year after my return to England, and my mother had gone to
be with my father, I think at Hamburg. I was swinging myself in the
swing when I heard, with perfect distinctness, my mother's voice
twice calling me by name. I believe I ran to the servant to ask if
she had called, but with the usual secretiveness of childhood I
kept the experience to myself. I have never had any other
hallucination of this sort in the course of my life.</p>

<p>I believe, however, that children are nearer than adults to the
threshold of hallucination. In this belief I am confirmed by
another experience which belongs to this period of my childhood at
Addiscombe. A boy cousin of about the same age was spending a few
days with us and slept in my bed. Sometimes in the morning we would
lie on our stomachs, burying our faces in the pillows, and see
visions. These visions&mdash;I do not know which of us originated
the experiment&mdash;were somewhat of the same kind, though less
vivid, as those I have since learnt to see on the curtain of the
eyelids under the influence of mescal buttons and resembled still
more the hypnagogic visions one is specially liable to see at night
after a fatiguing day. The remarkable point was that our visions
were to some extent under the influence of suggestion; the same
series appeared to both of us and we would note aloud any change
which then became visible to the other observer. These visions
caused no surprise or questioning to either of us, but I cannot
recall their occurrence at any other time.</p>

<p>When I was about nine years old we moved from Addiscombe to a
smaller house at Wimbledon, or rather the low-lying district
between Wimbledon and Merton. They are both interesting places, but
the intermediate region, between Wimbledon Station and Merton
Station, was of no interest, and we occupied a house in an
unattractive terrace in an unattractive road, which I now find it
difficult to recognise, so changed has all this region become. My
mother sent me as a day-scholar during the next three years to a
school called the French and German College opposite old Merton
Church. The house is now slowly being dissolved, if it has not
completely gone, but it was a fine old mansion, partly of the
Elizabethan age, which deserved a better fate. One entered the
house, though not the school, by the great finely designed iron
gates, after clanging a loud bell, and approached a low but very
broad house with two wings, and beyond to the left, the schoolhouse
with various farm buildings and out-houses; the whole was
surrounded by a high wall which also enclosed a large garden. I
have never been able to learn the ancient history of the house; in
fairly recent times it was said to have been once the home of
Sheridan; I find no support for this story in the biographies of
Sheridan, but it is clear at all events that Garrick once stayed at
Merton, and there was a little old theatre attached to the house,
in my time transformed into a combined swimming-bath and gymnasium,
though still recognisable as a theatre.</p>

<p>The school was entitled to rank as fairly good. I do not know
that any of my schoolfellows attained distinction, but a boy who
was there before my time, Robert Buchanan, acquired fame in
literature during my youth, and later, it so chanced, was, as he
wrote me, an admirer of my own early literary work, though neither
of us was aware of this link of connection. Another boy, rather
before my time, later achieved notoriety by becoming an itinerant
organ-grinder and claiming the title of Viscount Hinton. These two
careers probably owed as little as mine&mdash;although all three
were unconventional&mdash;to De Chastelain, the principal of the
school, a pale compact little man of French descent, though
completely anglicised, who made a competent and energetic
headmaster, maintaining his authority with a touch of sarcasm. It
was he who first noted the peculiarities of my hand-writing. He
would ask me if I wrote with the kitchen poker, and sometimes
remark that I seemed to keep a tame spider to race over the page.
But I knew little intimately of De Chastelain, for being a day-boy
and one of the youngsters I stood rather outside the inner life of
the school, if it had any. I am afraid that De Chastelain made an
unfavourable personal impression on me because I had acquired the
idea that he ill-treated his wife, a rather pretty American with a
low voice and a faded crushed air. This was probably the earliest
occasion on which I conceived, without realising it, a championship
of woman's rights. My schoolfellows, so far as I know, felt not the
slightest interest in her. To me it was her seeming pathos that
appealed; her age, about thirty I suppose, was far too advanced for
me to feel the smallest romantic attraction, for though up to the
age of about twenty-three such attraction, when I felt it, was
nearly always towards women four or five years older than myself,
no greater interval of years was possible. I scarcely remember that
I ever exchanged two words with her. I do remember, however, that
she once reported me to her husband as having passed her in the
street without lifting my cap; my "manners" were set down in the
next quarterly report home as "passable." I mention this little
episode as the earliest proof known to me of the existence of a
trait which has marked me throughout life. Absorbed in my own
dreams, all my life long I have passed by without seeing&mdash;and
frequently, even when seeing, not recognising&mdash;people who are
perfectly well known to me. I have even passed my own sweetheart
who had come to seek me, and who let me pass, not revealing that
incident to me until years afterwards. Yet I have sometimes been
considered very observant, for attention and observation are
capricious and partial, dependent on the interest of the moment, or
on one's instinctive permanent interests, so that there may be
things one never fails to see though nearly all other persons may
fail to see them.</p>

<p>I remained at the French and German College until I was twelve.
The years I spent there were almost altogether uneventful, and so
far as they were eventful the school counted for nothing. I learned
a little Latin and more French; I played a little cricket without
the slightest zest, and duly took my part in all other games. I was
occasionally invited with one or two selected boys to join in a
game of croquet with De Chastelain's friends on the lawn. I looked
on in the little theatre while the boarders used the trapeze or
learnt to swim. I was on entirely good terms with my schoolfellows
without making any intimate friends. Some of them were much elder
than I was, but they were a good-natured set; there were no bullies
among them, nor did I ever see or hear the slightest hint of any
schoolboy vice. The nearest approach to any impropriety I came
across was in one of the masters whose admiration was excited by
two pretty young dressmakers, sisters, who went to Merton Church,
and he asked me to take a letter to one of them at her home. I
refused; it evidently seemed to my youthfully virtuous mind too
much like encouraging an intrigue, and probably I should think so
still; he bore me no grudge. This same master was the first adult
man I had seen naked; it was in the swimming-bath, and the
vision&mdash;I can still recall it&mdash;of the sexual organs
struck me as ugly, almost repulsive. I expect I appeared a quiet,
rather shy boy, of average ability and rather commonplace
character. De Chastelain, acute man of the world, would probably
have been surprised to learn that I was ever to be heard of outside
my own parish. In after years, I sometimes had the vanity to wish
to call upon him, but when in middle age I at length paid a pious
visit to Merton, De Chastelain and his school, and his family, had
all long vanished. I knew not whither. At the age of twelve I left
the College for good, without joy and without regrets.</p>

<p>My real self was already emerging, but it was discovering itself
along lines that I never revealed at school and could never even
dream of revealing. I have already said that my love of
reading&mdash;it was almost a passion in those days&mdash;had
appeared at an early age. During the years I was at Merton College
reading was my constant delight during all my spare hours and
moments. In the holidays it was only with difficulty that my
mother, anxious for my health, drove me out of the house for
solitary walks in the dreary suburb that contained nothing that
appealed to me&mdash;except a little when I wandered as far as
Wimbledon Common&mdash;and I abridged these walks to the lowest
limit. Our house bookcase was not too wellsupplied with the kind of
literature I needed, though it contained all the early volumes of
the <i>Penny Magazine</i> (inherited from my grandfather Ellis)
rich with varied miscellany, notably the old English ballads,
including the Robin Hood cycle, for my instruction and delight, and
other good books like Cowper's poems and Scott's <i>Marmion</i>. My
taste was fairly omnivorous, though I rejected sermons and books of
religious edification, with which the bookcase swarmed. But I found
here, as first published serially in a religious periodical, that
gracious and beautiful book, Mrs. Charles's <i>Chronicles of the
Schönberg-Cotta Family</i>, and derived from it a kind of
unconscious artistic pleasure.</p>

<p>I discovered another source of literary enjoyment in the drawers
of a huge old bureau-sideboard. Here were stowed away and neglected
by all save me a number of books that had belonged to my
grandmother and had in them the simple book-plate "Susannah
Oliver." They dated from before her marriage, half a century
earlier, and they bore witness to her fine and varied taste. Here
were all the volumes of <i>Nature Displayed,</i> a conspectus of
the whole realm of Nature, doubtless meant for popular use yet with
no sacrifice of scientific honesty and precision; it was full of
beautiful plates, and I spent many hours poring over it with minute
attention. There are no such books now, for modern taste supposes
that "popular science" must be made easy and vague and sentimental
and prudish, but for my part, when I was ten years old much as now
when I am sixty years old, I wanted truth presented to me as it is,
arduous and honest and implacable. There was, however, a scientific
book of quite another sort which I read with pleasure, the first
edition, in many volumes, of Maria Edgeworth's <i>Harry and
Lucy.</i> It is a forgotten book now, even by those who rightly
admire Maria Edgeworth, but, I imagine, it may well have been the
first attempt to bring the elements of science attractively to
children. It is written with vivacity and though I only read it
once and spent no long time over it I can clearly recall some of
its scenes still. Here also I found Rousseau's <i>Rêveries d'un
promeneur solitaire.</i> It was the first French book I ever read
for my own pleasure, and I felt its haunting romantic music. This
was probably my earliest intimation of what style means. Not the
least precious of these books was to me Rowlandson's <i>Dr. Syntax
in Search of the Picturesque</i>. I was never weary of those
pictures, and it may well have been through the genius of
Rowlandson&mdash;though I must not forget the carefully studied
papers of Mrs. Jameson on Italian art, in the <i>Penny Magazine</i>
and their illustrations delicately worked over in colours by my
grandfather&mdash;that I first began to attain an insight into art.
That volume is the only one of my grandmother's books that I have
succeeded in preserving. All the rest melted away by use or in
moving from house to house, especially during my absence in
Australia, and the like happened to a large number of the
rare&mdash;as they would now be&mdash;and beautiful curios my
father brought from time to time from many lands, enough to make an
exquisite little museum had they all been carefully preserved. But
I have a few of these also, above all a Buddha, one of two which a
soldier at Rangoon brought as loot one day to the ship (in which my
father had transported troops for the Burmese war) and wanted to
know what my father would give for them. He offered a very worn
copy of one of Marryat's novels. The offer was accepted. Now a
Hindu gentleman who lately saw my Buddha tells me it is of
thirteenth-century style, and that if I ever feel disposed to
return it to India he will come over to escort it.</p>

<p>In addition to these books I read with care about this time a
great many serious modern books, such as Macaulay's <i>Essays,</i>
which I had selected as a birthday present, and annotated in a
critical spirit since my parents were somewhat Conservative in
political tendency, and I had so far developed no political or
social ideas of my own. Nowadays it is often a difficult matter for
me to read at all since my mind at once begins to work vigorously
on every statement set before it; every touch now puts innumerable
circuits of thought and emotion and expression into action. But at
that time my mind was an empty treasure-house into which every
precious thing I could find was eagerly poured. I bought cheap
editions of Milton and Burns and religiously read them through at
the age of twelve, though as yet with no great relish. Longfellow,
whom I also bought in a corresponding sixpenny edition, was the
first poet to make a profound and intimate impression upon me. Here
for the first time, especially in the more lyrical poems, I seemed
to hear a living voice which spoke to me in the language of my own
heart. Longfellow was, as it were, the sweet friend of my early
boyhood, the only friend I then possessed with whom I could
privately commune. My love for him was later submerged in a
mightier love for Shelley&mdash;though in the first tempestuous
spring of adolescence I revelled in the intoxicating poetry of
Alexander Smith's <i>Life-Drama</i> and Mrs. Browning's <i>Aurora
Leigh</i>&mdash;but there always remained with me, long after I
outgrew his poems, a tender memory for that first friend of wistful
and pensive puberty. No other writer so well expressed in my day
the ideas and emotions of that period.</p>

<p>The prose author who in those days held me most absolutely
enthralled was Scott. I suppose I was about ten when my mother took
us for a summer holiday to Shanklin in the Isle of Wight. She asked
the landlady if she had any books to lend me to read, and the
original edition of <i>Woodstock</i> was by a happy chance
produced. I cannot say that I fell at once under the magician's
spell&mdash;that is not my way and <i>Woodstock</i> is not one of
the best of the Waverley novels&mdash;but I was certainly eager to
read more books of the same author, and very soon all my small
pocket-money (I am not sure that my regular allowance yet exceeded
a penny or twopence a week) was devoted to the gradual purchase of
Scott's novels in the sixpenny edition. Here was a vast world,
indeed a whole succession of worlds, in which I lost my own
personality, and lived, with never a critical pang, a life of
absolute and pure enjoyment. I delighted more or less in all of
them, but those that were most remote in time and place fascinated
me most, though not really the finest, because they opened the
largest vistas to imagination, and <i>Ivanhoe</i> seemed to me the
most perfect, while none of them made so intimate an appeal to me
as <i>The Abbot,</i> with its romance of Mary Queen of Scots and
the charming figure of Catherine Seyton with whom I fell hopelessly
in love. My pocket-money could not keep pace with my insatiable
thirst for these wonderful books, and the favourites I would read,
reread, and read once again, when novelties ran short. This went on
with vigour that but slowly flagged for several years, until I was
sixteen and had just reached Australia to begin life on my own
account. I was passing through religious struggles which had
sharpened the accuracy of my critical faculty, and my interests
were at the same time being diverted into other altogether
different channels. Scott's brilliant stage lost its glamour; the
machinery seemed to creak. I was behind the scenes and could see
how tawdry the machinery often was.</p>

<p>While my capacious appetite for literature enabled me to devour
from end to end some very serious books, I also read with pleasure
some boys' books of travel and adventure. At some not very early
date also, I came upon an old sea chest of drawers of my father's
which contained, with some less attractive literature, an
illustrated edition of <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> and translations of
some navigators' narratives, notably those of La Pérouse. (I
already knew a book of missionary experiences in the Pacific with
coloured illustrations, which fixed on my mind a permanent ideal of
those islands, scarcely intended by the author, long before I knew
<i>Typee</i>.) These books, I remember, were stained with age, and
soaked in the fragrance of the wood of the chest, exhaled by many
voyages across the tropics, and this added to their exotic charm. I
was at the College at Merton, and probably about ten or eleven
years old, when I passed through a literary experience which may
seem surprising in a boy who was reading, or about to read, Milton
and Macaulay. I was introduced by a schoolfellow to <i>The Boys of
England,</i> a penny weekly, full of extravagantly sensational and
romantic adventures in wild and remote lands. The fascination with
which this literature held me was a kind of fever. It was an
excitement which overwhelmed all ordinary considerations. My mother
forbade me to read these things, but, though I usually obeyed her,
in this matter I was disobedient without compunction. Mr. De
Chastelain once detected me reading <i>The Boys of England</i> in
school hours; during solitary rambles I read it as I walked; every
spare moment, when alone, it was in my hands. But the fever
subsided as suddenly as it arose&mdash;probably it only lasted a
few weeks&mdash;and left not a trace behind. It is an experience
which enables me to realise how helpless we are in this matter. If
this is the literature a boy needs nothing will keep him away from
it; if he needs more than ever it can give it will leave no mark on
him. So far as I remember, <i>The Boys of England</i> was innocent
enough though full of wild and extravagant action. It is doubtless
in its appeal to the latent motor energies of developing youth that
its fascination lies.</p>

<p>My demand to make literature, as apart from reading it, I can
scarcely trace the beginning of. At an early age I would buy penny
notebooks, some of which I still possess, and in these I entered,
in a large childish hand, the record of the occurrences of my life
that chiefly interested me, together with the dates when I read
particular books, and extracts from them of passages which struck
me. These notebooks slowly became more elaborate. I began to index
them and to co-ordinate the quoted passages under a few headings.
In fact the literary methods I later followed were already growing
up slowly and spontaneously, without the slightest stimulus or
assistance from outside, at the age of ten. By the age of twelve I
had prepared a little book for publication. It was called <i>The
Precious Stones of the Bible.</i> It contained nothing original but
was an orderly compilation of all the facts on the subject I could
bring together from the small supply of books at my disposition. By
this time, however, I was beginning to acquire a library of my own,
aided by rather skilful bargaining&mdash;sale, purchase and
exchange&mdash;in the advertisement columns of <i>The Exchange and
Mart.</i> In this way I secured a number of bound volumes of an old
miscellany of instructive character called <i>The Visitor,</i>
which proved a source of useful information. I wished to publish my
little book, and my mother, who, without encouraging me, took a
sympathetic interest in my literary activities, was willing to
help. In my innocence I supposed that the most economical plan
would be to print as few copies as possible, and decided to have
only twelve. On applying to a large City printing firm it appeared
that the cost would be £12, and the scheme dropped. When I look
back now at that little book I seem to see in it the germ of my
later books, I mean those of more scientific character; then, as
now, it was my desire to accumulate with an open mind all the
information I could acquire and present it in a fair, orderly, and
attractive way, though I could not then, as I have since learnt to
do, in that act create afresh a form that my own spirit had
moulded. In its elements this method, I can now recognise, is that
of the East Anglian mind with which my own must largely be
identified, the method of Ray, the method which Bacon illuminated
with the flame of genius. It is a natural history method, a method
to which some would deny the name of science, and it has always
been my instinct to be a natural historian of the soul, so that it
interested me once when Dr. Davenport, the distinguished American
biologist, told me that I seemed to him the only Englishman who had
applied natural history methods to psychology.</p>

<p>I planned another book, on flowers, and I accumulated much
material on trees. These studies remained literary, not scientific;
whether jewels or flowers or trees, I failed at that time, in a way
that now seems strange to me, to develop any ardour for studying
them in nature. The impulse to handle and explore the actual thing,
whether material or psychic, only developed slowly within me during
the following twenty years, until now the thing that I cannot come
in close contact with has little interest for me.</p>

<p>I also wrote a number of short miscellaneous essays on various
topics. Here I had more scope for the development of a personal
style and was already unconsciously feeling after a rhythm of my
own, at this time rather redundant and rhetorical, as, I remember,
my mother once pointed out to me. I would like to read these little
essays aloud, and the most obvious way of doing so seemed to me to
regard them as sermons and to preach them to the congregation of my
young sisters, using the head of the sofa as a pulpit. Doubtless
this was the first manifestation of my hereditary ecclesiasticism,
not, I suppose, the last, for it is but a few years since that I
read in a review by a brilliant woman critic that there is the
atmosphere of <i>Cranford</i> around even my most daring books, and
though I have never read <i>Cranford</i> I understand that the
atmosphere in question is of pious clericalism.</p>

<p>Neither in form nor substance were these childish writings
original. Their interest is as a clue to my genuine literary
temperament. I proceeded throughout from native instinct and
without the slightest stimulus or example to impel me along the
path I was taking. I had never met an author; people of that kind
were completely unknown in my family circle and never mentioned. No
one I knew would have dreamt of holding up an author as worthy of
my imitation. It was not, moreover, until long afterwards that I
realised that authorship is a possible means of livelihood. Indeed,
in a sense, I never have so looked upon it. I am quite pleased to
make my living by what I write, but the attempt to write for my
living would be hopeless, for I can write nothing that is not in
itself a pleasure to me to write.</p>

<p>My early literary adventures revealed a preoccupation with the
Bible. Just as all my germinal artistic and scientific aptitudes
went into writing, so all my early emotional activity went into
religion. From our earliest years my mother brought us up
religiously. She was so profoundly and sincerely religious herself,
in the old Evangelical manner, that it was inevitable she should.
Such early and constant familiarity with the Bible and the Prayer
Book, and a regular attendance at church services, whether or not
it inspires religious emotion, certainly promotes religious
knowledge, and the imagery of the Bible, the phrases and cadences
of the Prayer Book, which glide so easily into my mind and into my
writings, date back to my childhood. For strong emotion, however,
the shock of sudden external stimulus is necessary. I cannot
definitely recall how this shock cane to me, but I am fairly
certain that it was through the remarkable personality of the Rev.
John Erck, the Vicar of Merton at that time. Old Merton Church,
though immediately opposite the College, was not the nearest church
to our house. But my mother was always accustomed to choose the
church that suited her and not that which happened to be nearest.
Erck&mdash;an Irishman, a man of good family and some
property&mdash;was an example of the so-called Celt, short and
erect, with black hair, sallow complexion, and dark glowing eyes.
He had all the perfervid oratorical and emotional genius of his
race, and a thousand years earlier might have been among the Irish
missionary saints. A shy, silent man in daily life, who walked
straight ahead, with his forearm carried at his back, looking
neither to right nor left, in the pulpit he was transformed. I have
heard many famous preachers&mdash;Liddon and Stanley and Spurgeon
and Parker&mdash;but never one who possessed so fine a natural
eloquence as this man, an eloquence in which passionate sincerity
blended with poetic imagination, wholly guided, it seemed, by the
inspiration of the moment and yet always the instinct of the
artist. I remember him vividly enough to believe that if I were to
hear him now my opinion would still be the same. He had a beautiful
voice with a wide range between the high and the low tones, and he
would modulate this voice with a skill and effect which in a
popular preacher must soon have become a self-conscious
affectation, but in this unappreciated country parson of a quiet
village seemed altogether natural. There come back to me the summer
evenings in the dim church&mdash;it was only in the evening that
his eloquence was fully revealed and when dusk came on the lights
were not lit&mdash;and the stream of Irish eloquence that rose and
fell over the heads of those prim and stolid Anglo-Saxon villagers.
I well remember, on the sudden death by a fall from F his horse of
Bishop Wilberforce&mdash;a diocesan whose exceeding personal charm
had won the heart of the Low Church Vicar&mdash;with what
impassioned eloquence Erck preached on the Elijah who had been
suddenly swept to the clouds in a chariot of fire; and how again,
in a very different mood, having apparently found that the
tradesmen of his parish were not above the trick of giving false
measure, he preached a fierce sermon on this subject: "People of
Merton, repent!" Perhaps more than by his sermons I was moved by
Erck's exquisite way of reading the lessons and especially the
prayers. He would sometimes subtly graduate and slowly deepen his
voice through the various collects of Evensong, and the low and
grave tones with which at length he reached "Lighten our darkness"
still linger in memory. These influences enabled me to understand
something of the reality of the Bible and the beauty of the English
Prayer Book, and so to some extent counteracted the dulling effect
of familiarity with these things when imposed as a task in early
life.</p>

<p>Erck left Merton, I believe, a few years after we left the
neighbourhood, disheartened, I understand, by the lack of sympathy,
and became English Chaplain at Pisa during long years. He is still
alive when I write this, in 1905, living at Brighton, and now when
I re-write these pages in 1921 I can add that he died at an
advanced age, and that when I visited Merton Church a few years ago
I noted with pleasure a brass tablet set up on the wall to his
memory.*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Perhaps it was set up by his wife. Still
later (I now write in 1930) I note in <i>The Times</i> her death,
also in Brighton, a few miles from where I am now living, at the
great age of 100.]</p>

<p>A certain part of the religious and semi-religious influence of
Merton Church upon my young and sensitive mind emanated from the
building itself. I never knew its history&mdash;I sometimes sought
to imagine it, though I knew that Merton had a part in ancient
history. The churches I had been familiar with before were modern
and uninteresting; this, though small and of no great architectural
worth, possessed the charm and beauty of antiquity. The ancient
monuments, the old helmet that hung aloft over the reading-desk,
the row of blazoned escutcheons and their mottoes&mdash;<i>In Coelo
Quies</i> and the rest&mdash;these things vaguely and often stirred
my ignorant imagination. The love of old buildings, especially old
churches, which has become so strong with me since, certainly began
to make itself felt at Merton.</p>

<p>Underlying my interest in the external aspects of religion there
was really a personal and intimate kernel. What, if any,
intellectual or dogmatic conceptions I attached to religion I
cannot recollect; doubtless they were only those I was taught. But
at one time I constantly carried a little Testament in my pocket; I
studied it devoutly; I was, moreover, seriously anxious to do
right, and firmly resolved to train myself in the paths of
righteousness. I recall one incident that seems characteristic. I
had found among old neglected books in the house a little manual on
self-education by, I think, a Mrs. Hope, and a list of faults was
herein presented in a tabular form, the author recommending the use
of such a table for entering a mark against each fault every time
it was committed. I copied out the table for my own use and began
duly to follow the instructions. Before long, however, I found that
it was often difficult to be quite sure about the definition of
one's faults and also realised that, in any case, the proceeding
was unprofitable. I folded up the table of my faults and slipped it
down between the boards of my bedroom floor. Maybe it rests there
still.</p>

<p>All these little experiences, it must be noted, I went through
strictly with myself. I had then in a high degree, as I have always
had more or less since&mdash;though as one grows old and detached
from the world it is less rather than more&mdash;an instinctive
secretiveness in intimate emotional matters, an almost
unconquerable impulse to keep my own personal life to myself. I
never desired to take, and certainly never dreamed of taking, any
person into my confidence in these matters of religious edification
and moral improvement. It must be said that I was, at this age, in
all respects a "good" boy; whether or not the vices of boyhood are
virtues in disguise, I certainly had no trace of them; but I was
not a goody-goody boy, for it would have been horror to me for
anyone to suspect my inner feelings.</p>

<p>So far I have said nothing of my sexual life. On the physical
side there was really nothing to say until I had passed boyhood and
reached adolescence. There were no spontaneous sexual
manifestations, and no companion, no servant girl, ever sought to
arouse such phenomena, or to gratify curiosities that before
puberty had not come into being. Indeed, strange as it may appear
to some, throughout the whole course of my school-days until they
ended at the age of sixteen, I cannot recall that I heard or saw
anything that would have shocked an ordinarily modest schoolgirl.
The incident there was to tell merely shows my innocence.</p>

<p>In recent years I have sometimes looked back at my childhood to
observe how it appears in the light of modern views of the more
subtle mechanism of sex and its manifestations and repressions in
childhood. That much may thus be revealed I am now well aware by my
own investigations on others. One cannot fail to find something
significant when one turns to explore, in this new light, the child
one has known most intimately. A central fact about myself seems to
be demonstrated by the incident to which I have just referred. In
childhood I was not sexually excitable. It seems to me that,
however numerous the exceptions, this complete sexual latency in
the pre-pubertal period is probably the rule. But I am not here
concerned to generalise, nor am I prepared to assert that I was
myself either as child or adult completely normal; on the contrary,
I was from the first&mdash;beneath a reserved and impassive
surface&mdash;a highly nervous and sensitive person. I was in some
degrees, perhaps, what may be called an "introverted" child; my
timidity, my self-consciousness and self-criticism perhaps drove me
in on myself, not, however, towards daydreaming, which only began
at puberty, but to books. (My wife, as a child, by a more profound
sense of inferiority&mdash;for those around her took pleasure in
making her aware of her small size, her lack of beauty, and her
naughtiness&mdash;was driven to the opposite extreme of rebellious
and energetic selfassertion, and so became an "extraverted" child.)
There were no sexual emotions and not even any sexual curiosities
at this period. I remember that at some time&mdash;I cannot
remember when&mdash;I considered the question of the origin of
babies and decided that they emerged from their mothers' navels,
but this was to me a purely scientific question which involved no
morbid feelings, nor any undue attention. I was, again,
affectionately devoted to my mother, but quite calmly and
undemonstratively, without at any time the slightest touch of
excess or any cravings for the manifestation of love in her, or any
curiosities, and without, also, the slightest hostile feeling
towards my father. Moreover I shared the curious, reserved,
critical aloofness which most children feel towards their parents.
I am at the same time able to believe that my mother exerted some
moulding influence on my later sexual life&mdash;and that this
would have been much greater if, as never happened, she had allowed
her love for me to become unduly tender&mdash;but, as it was, her
chief influence lay in unconsciously moulding my ideal of womanhood
generally.</p>

<p>The question arises whether this seeming absence of sexual
phenomena in childhood may not be due to deliberate repression or
automatic suppression of such phenomena into the unconscious. If
so, they ought when thus repressed or suppressed to give some sign
in disorder of the conscious life; but there seem no such signs.
Something more, however, I now see, remains to be said. There was
no occasion for such repression or suppression. There was no need
for it, not entirely because there was nothing to put away, but
because the veil of impassive reserve with which I concealed the
whole of my intimate personal life rendered repression or
suppression completely superfluous. Beneath the veil I was free to
think or to feel what I liked; there was no one to say me nay and I
saw no reason for saying nay to myself. This fact now seems to me
of immense significance for the whole of my life; it is, from one
point of view, the key to all my work and my while attitude towards
the world. I have never repressed anything. What others have driven
out of consciousness or pushed into the background, as being
improper or obscene, I have maintained and even held in honour. It
has become wrought into the texture of my whole work. Cultured and
intelligent people have privately said of my work that it is quite
right but should not have been written and published. If I had
acted according to their ideas I should have remained as dumb and
as obscure as they remained. What I have done has been less perhaps
the outcome of deliberate resolve than the expression of an
instinct, only now becoming clear to me. That same impulse is
expressed in my whole attitude towards the world, in what may be
called my philosophy, if by that word one may mean no accepted
system but the manifestation of one's personal attitude towards the
universe. I have from the first, beneath my concealing veil, been
natural; and so I am naturally one with Nature and intimately and
essentially in harmony with the course of the universe. It was not
until I was nineteen that I became consciously aware of that
harmonious union, but the immense satisfaction that the discovery
gave me was a sufficient proof of what my real nature had been from
the first.</p>

<p>I have said that probably in childhood I was sexually normal.
But I think I can trace a slight fibre of what, if possibly normal
in childhood, is commonly held&mdash;though this I doubt, since I
have found it so common&mdash;not to be so when it persists or even
develops after puberty. I mean a slight strain of what I may call
urolagnia, which never developed into a real perversion nor ever
became a dominant interest, and formed no distinguishable part of
the chief love interests of my life. It was not a recognisable
emotional interest in childhood, but the clearness with which
several small incidents from that period stand out in memory seems
to indicate that it was of some interest to me. To this in later
childhood a more scientific interest, possibly my earliest
scientific interest, was added when I observed the differences in
vesical energy among my schoolfellows, my own being below the
average, and began to measure it exactly as private opportunities
offered. Many years afterwards I continued these observations and
published the results in a paper on "The Bladder as a Dynamoineter"
in the <i>American Journal of Dermatology,</i> May, 1902. Later my
vision of this function became in some degree attached to my
feeling of tenderness towards women&mdash;I was surprised how often
women responded to it sympathetically&mdash;and to my conception of
beauty, for it was never to me a vulgar interest, but, rather, an
ideal interest, a part of the yet unrecognised loveliness of the
world, which we already recognise in fountains, though fountains,
it is now asserted, have here had their origin. It would be easy to
over-rate the importance of this interest. But it is necessary to
note it.*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* I may be regarded as a pioneer in the
recognition of the beauty of the natural act in women when carried
out in the erect attitude, and it is described in the passage of my
<i>Impressions and Comments</i> which some critics consider my best
piece of prose, as well as in an early sonnet entitled "Madonna,"
while for the more scientific side my study "Undinism" is the first
serious discussion of the whole subject. But Rembrandt preceded me.
There is a fine and admired picture of his in the National Gallery
(No. 54) of a woman standing in a pool and holding up her smock,
with parted legs, in an attitude which has always seemed to me
undoubtedly to represent the act of urination. In recent years I
have learnt on good authority that so it really came from the
artist's hands, but that, at some later date (whether or not before
it reached the National Gallery in 1836) the falling stream was
painted out. The picture is dated 1634, and experts now consider
that it probably represents Hendrickje Stoffels, the charming and
beloved figure whom, about that time, Rembrandt painted in various
intimate situations. I should like to think that the indignation I
feel at this sacrilegious distortion of a supreme artist's work
will some day be generally shared.]</p>

<p>In later years, I would now further note, it has seemed to me
that I may have inherited this trait from my mother, whose early
love of water I have already referred to. Once at the age of twelve
she took me to spend the day at the London Zoological Gardens. In
the afternoon as we were walking side by side along a gravelled
path in a solitary part of the Gardens, she stood still, and soon I
heard a very audible stream falling to the ground. When she moved
on I instinctively glanced behind at the pool on the path, and my
mother, having evidently watched my movements, remarked shyly: "I
did not mean you to see that." I accepted the incident simply and
naturally. Much later in life, recalling the episode&mdash;I
remembered it clearly, so it must have made an impression on my
mind&mdash;I realised that my very truthful mother's remark could
not be taken at its face value. Nothing would have been easier than
to step on the grass, where detection might possibly have been
avoided, or to find a pretext for sending me a few yards off, or to
enter a Ladies Room. Her action said clearly: "I meant you to see
that." To-day I probably understand it better than she herself
could. No doubt there was a shy alarm as to what her now tall
serious boy would think of this new experience with his mother, but
there was also the impulse to heighten a pleasurable experience by
blending with it the excitement of sharing it with her son. There
was evidently a little touch of exhibitionism, the added pleasure
of mixing a private and slightly improper enjoyment with the
presence of a beloved male person, for a mother is always a little
in love with her first-born and only son. Every woman who has a
streak of what I have called Undinism will understand the
fascination of this emotion on the threshold of intimacy. Her real
feeling would have been better stated as: "I loved you to see, but
I didn't want you to see if you would have been disgusted." On the
next occasion, some time later, there was no longer any shyness and
she confided in me beforehand. We had just had dinner at an
Exhibition and, as there were people strolling about, this time she
really took some precautions. She stood on the grass, and before
she had finished walked on a few paces and copiously recommenced,
while I spontaneously played a protective part and watched to see
that no one was approaching. When in much later life I mentioned
this experience to Louie, my sister, she assured me that our mother
had always been extremely reserved with the girls in regard to this
function, and remarked, after consideration: "She was flirting with
you!" I could add various significant details which now confirm for
me the presence in my mother of this trait, such as the habit of
urinating on her hand, which, she confided to me, was good for the
skin but, I doubt not, found pleasureable. I remember, too, that,
earlier, when I was about nine or ten, she once thrust suddenly in
my face the hot wet diaper she had just removed from the baby, a
mischievous little trick played on her serious son, but also, I now
think, with latently in it the challenge to accept this function as
natural and sweet. I turned my face away in disgust but I perhaps
understand her better now.</p>

<p>I should add that there was not on my part any impulse of
curiosity such as young boys sometimes manifest with regard to
their mothers, and when, as sometimes happened, she called me into
her room in the morning to wash her bared back, I had no impulse to
exceed the mission assigned to me. There was an awe in my affection
for her which would have prevented even the feeling of curiosity.
But it seems significant that I remember clearly these as well as
other incidents, earlier in life, when the subject of urination was
presented to me in connection with women, though such incidents had
no apparent effect on me. It was not until the age of sixteen that
this trait became a conscious and active, though always a
subordinate, element in my mind. It can hardly, therefore, be
considered either the persistence of an infantile impulse or a
regression. It proved of immense benefit to me, for it was the germ
of a perversion and it enabled me to understand sympathetically the
nature of perversions. On the emotional side, also, it has been a
more or less latent element in that tender sympathy with women
which, as I have come to realise, they so greatly appreciate.</p>

<p>Love comes normally to a child through what we call the soul
rather than through the body. In this and, indeed,
throughout&mdash;with whatever wide variations from the most common
types&mdash;I was normal. The young boy's love is a spiritual
passion generated within by any stray spark from the real world,
and so far as his own consciousness extends, even without any
sensory, still less any sensual, elements whatever, easy as it
might be to detect such elements. A chance encounter of life sets
free within him a vision which has danced within the brains of his
ancestors to remote generations and has no relation whatever to the
careless girl whose playful hand opens the dark casement that
reveals the universe.</p>

<p>I was twelve years old, and the summer holidays, after my last
term at Merton College, had just begun. Half a century earlier (as
I discovered five years afterwards in Australia when reading his
attractive <i>Autobiography),</i> at the same age, in this same
village of Merton, a man of letters more famous than I am ever
likely to be, Leigh Hunt, had met his first love. Here I was now to
meet mine.</p>

<p>My mother, though on occasion hospitable, cared little to have
strangers staying in the house; a girl or boy cousin would
sometimes be invited to spend a week, and left no impress on my
imagination. The first stranger not of my kin to stay in the house
was a girl of sixteen, the only daughter of my mother's
step-brother, who was in a well-to-do position. Agnes, then, for
that was her name, was invited to spend a summer week or two with
us at Wimbledon in 1871. She was a dark pretty vivacious girl, with
long black ringlets, of something the same type, I can now see, as
her grandmother, the second Mrs. Wheatley, whom I distinctly
remember. Old enough to be a woman in my eyes, and yet young enough
to be a comrade and equal, she adapted herself instinctively to the
relationship and won my heart immediately. I took not the slightest
liberty with her, and never had the slightest impulse to do so, but
she, on her part, treated me with an easy familiarity which no
woman had ever used with me before, and that fact, certainly,
though its significance was then beyond me, undoubtedly had its
influence. She would play and romp with me in all innocent
unreserve, and when we went out together for long walks, as often
happened, she would sometimes make me offer her my arm and treat
her as a lady, then again asserting her superiority by treating me
to lemonade and at the best places she could find. One day as we
strolled arm in arm through the poppied cornfields which then lay
between Merton Station and the College&mdash;it was in these fields
that I first knew the beauty of poppies&mdash;my severe little
schoolmaster suddenly came round the corner on to us. Timid though
I habitually seemed, I raised my cap without flinching or
withdrawing my arm under my master's stern eye, and have ever since
prided myself on that early little act of moral courage. He
doubtless smiled to himself at thus seeing a handsome girl hanging
on his quiet pupil's arm, and he subsequently asked my father who
she was, but without, I think, mentioning that detail. Agnes
returned home, and, strangely enough, I have never seen her since.
I lent her Keats's Poems when she left and she lent me <i>The Wide,
Wide World;</i> we exchanged a few notes but our correspondence
speedily withered, without protest on my part, and probably aided
by the fact that, through a trivial circumstance connected with
this very visit of Agnes&mdash;she had once offered to help in the
domestic work and been given some peas to shell which her mother
resented as too menial a task for her daughter&mdash;a certain
permanent coldness developed between her mother and mine, each
feeling aggrieved. She is still alive, and though she was even then
looking forward to marriage as a near probability (for I heard her
talk to our servant to that effect) she still remains single, an
only child who has devoted her life to the care of her aged
parents.</p>

<p>I never saw Agnes again; I never made any effort to see her; I
never mentioned her name; no one knew that I even thought of her.
But for four years her image moved and lived within me, revealing
myself to myself. I had no physical desires and no voluptuous
emotions; I never pictured to myself any joy of bodily contact with
her or cherished any sensuous dreams. Yet I was devoured by a boy's
pure passion. That she should become my wife&mdash;though I never
tried to imagine what that meant&mdash;was a wild and constant
aspiration. I would he awake in bed with streaming eyes praying to
God to grant that this might some day be. I have often felt
thankful since that our prayers are not heard.</p>

<p>Under the stress of this passion I became a person, and,
moreover, in temper a poet. I discovered the beauty of the world,
and I discovered a new vein of emotion within myself. I began to
write verse. I began to enjoy art, and, at the same time, Nature.
In a still vague and rudimentary way, all my literary activities
slowly took on a new character. Hitherto they had been impersonal,
displaying indeed a certain research, a certain orderly and
systematic spirit, perhaps inborn, yet not definitely personal. Now
the personal element took shape. The touch of this careless
vivacious girl had placed within me a new ferment which began to
work through every fibre of my being. It was an epoch-making event
in my life, and was soon to be succeeded by another of scarcely
less importance.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>Chapter Three</h2>

<p>Now that I was twelve years old my mother decided that I ought
to be sent to a boarding school. It was to be a small private
school, for she had heard too much evil of large public schools to
care to send her only son to them. Moreover, our means were not
sufficient for an expensive education. We lived, indeed, in ease
and comfort, from a lower middle-class point of view, on my
father's earnings as sea-captain under more prosperous conditions
than have always prevailed in the merchant service since, and on a
small income of my mother's, and until I left home I never knew
what money worries meant&mdash;though I have often had occasion to
know in the years that have followed&mdash;but as my parents always
lived well within their means a lavish expenditure even on so
important a matter as education was out of the question. My mother
accordingly visited a school at Mitcham which, from what she had
heard, seemed likely to furnish a desirable education at a moderate
cost. The house was large and old&mdash;one of the numerous houses
wherein Queen Elizabeth is said once to have slept&mdash;and my
mother was of course shown over it with all due consideration. But
the ill-ventilated schoolroom full of boys smelt so fusty and dirty
that she conceived a dislike of the place and came away without
making any arrangements. On her way back to Tooting Station she had
to pass another school, The Poplars&mdash;a curious old wooden
house, long since pulled down, though the brick schoolroom yet
stands&mdash;facing an open triangular space with a pond which we
called Frogs' Marsh. She entered, and was so pleased with
everything here that she arranged at once with the headmaster to
send me to him, although the terms were higher than she had
proposed to pay. I was to be a weekly boarder, for my mother,
though she never made any similar arrangements for her daughters,
wished to preserve a home influence over her son and to direct his
religious education.</p>

<p>My mother was pleased with the ways of The Poplars, but it is
not possible to make any high claims for its educational methods.
My headmaster, Mr. Albert Grover, was an oddity, a tall middle-aged
man, looking much older than his years, with a long grey beard, a
bald head, and a blind eye. He had some resemblance to Darwin, but
he cherished much contempt for that great man's doctrines, and even
published a little anti-Darwinian pamphlet in doggerel verse which
so nearly verged on the obscene that it could not be sold on
railway bookstalls. Grover had a weakness for verse; he liked to
teach facts and dates in doggerel, such as:</p>

<p class="poem">"Preston Pans and Fontenoy<br>
Were fought in 1745, my boy."</p>

<p>He even introduced that method into his punishments, and I
recall how a little boy had to stand on the form during
breakfast-time in the presence of the master's wife and daughter
and the whole of the school, repeating:</p>

<p class="poem">"Oh! Oh! Oh!<br>
I'm the little boy who broke the pot."</p>

<p>But Mrs. Grover, too, was an oddity&mdash;a queer small boyish
woman, with short curly hair, rarely seen then in women, and also
frank of speech. It was told how she had once entered a bedroom, at
a moment when a boy chanced to be naked, and how, as he modestly
placed his hands before him, she reassuringly remarked: "It's not
the first time I've seen a little cuckoo."</p>

<p>It would be easy to write amusingly of the life at The Poplars,
but beneath its eccentricities it was essentially commonplace and
old-fashioned, quite comfortable, certainly, and without hardship.
So far as my headmaster was concerned, the influence of school upon
me was neither good nor evil. He was a kindly man who always
treated me well. I do not remember that he ever punished me or ever
had cause to, but he inspired no love for any kind of learning, and
I continued, as I had begun, without aptitude for formal studies.
(It has always amused me in later life when I have come across
references to my "learning" or my "scholarship.") I learnt no Greek
at all, though I taught myself a little some years later; I plodded
blunderingly through Latin, and cannot read any Latin author easily
even now; I was, as I always remained, a blockhead at even the
simplest mathematical problem; in Euclid, however, I showed a
certain facility and rather enjoyed its logic, for reason and
clarity have always appealed to me, and I am not surprised when I
am told that my writings translate peculiarly well into the Latin
tongues, in which those qualities most prevail. In any art I may
sometimes be fascinated by the romantically obscure, but it is to
the classic (though not the pseudo-classic) that my admiration
instinctively goes out: I am repelled by the shapeless and the
unintelligible. At Merton, with a head master who was himself of
French origin, I was well-grounded in that language, and now at
Mitcham I had the good fortune to find eventually&mdash;for he was
preceded by three others, one a typical Pole, whose engagement
proved brief&mdash;a resident French master who really loved his
work and taught with thoroughness and enthusiasm. His name was
Joseph Stevens; he came from Douai and was, as his name might lead
one to expect, of distinctly Flemish type, slender and fair, a
simple single-minded man with no interests beyond his work. I
frequently associated with him outside school hours and my
knowledge of French literature now began and rapidly progressed.
Stevens had some knowledge of other languages besides French, and
with a little help from him I began on my own account and in my own
time (in which also I was keeping up my practice on the piano) to
master the elements of German and Italian. My interest in French,
and in modern languages generally, simply as instruments to bring
me nearer to contemporary life and contemporary literature and
contemporary peoples, has been of inestimable value to my work, as
well as a perpetual source of delight and of refreshment, and I am
grateful to Joseph Stevens, I do not say for implanting but for
stimulating and fostering it.</p>

<p>The English assistant master, however, Angus Mackay, had a far
more vital and profound influence upon me than Stevens. He came to
the school soon after I entered, and he remained when, four years
afterwards, I left. I still recall him as he paced the garden on
the first evening of his arrival, a short, sturdy figure with bent
head. Though scarcely twenty years of age, he had already struggled
against many difficulties and seen much of life. A Highlander on
one side (his father had been an accomplished "Royal Piper" but
died early after, I believe, a rather dissolute life), English on
the other, he fortunately reaped all the congenital advantages that
may sometimes come of such mixture of blood. A dreamer and a poet,
eager in intelligence and strong in enthusiasm, he was at the same
time keen-sighted, energetic, practical, robust, a man of wholesome
and pure instincts, a sanguine optimist, hearty in his friendships,
equally downright in his contempt for all shams and pretences
wherever they might be found. Struggling in poverty for his
education (as also was his sister at the same time and with
eventual success, for she founded a prosperous school), he had
supported himself first as an office boy, then as a city clerk; now
he felt able to take the post of assistant master in a school while
further studying for a degree at London University. After that, he
proposed to enter the Church. His religious views were those of the
so-called Broad Church&mdash;that is to say, he followed Carlyle,
Ruskin, Charles Kingsley, F. D. Maurice and F. W.
Robertson&mdash;while he was also in personal touch with Baldwin
Brown, a distinguished divine of the Congregational Church. In
politics he was, of course, Liberal, not to say Radical. It was,
however, to literature, and especially to poetry, that he had been
devoted. He had himself already published two little volumes of
verse, strongly marked by the influence of Wordsworth and Tennyson,
and one of these, <i>An Artist's Idylls,</i> had even gone into a
second edition; he knew thoroughly the English poetic literature of
the first half of the nineteenth century, and he had some
acquaintance with contemporary poetic movements, while he was also
familiar with many of the great English novelists and an ardent
admirer of several contemporary novelists, especially Thomas Hardy,
whose <i>Far From the Madding Crowd</i> was then about to appear in
the Cornhill, which Mackay placed in my hands.</p>

<p>It is evident that to the shy sensitive solitary boy of twelve
who had just arrived at Mitcham, however precocious in some mental
respects he was, this man, full of the life and energy of the outer
world, and inspired by its culture, was as it were a God-given
revelation. He led me into that world. I had travelled round the
earth, but I had never in my life conversed with a cultured,
intellectual man. My mother was a liberallyminded Evangelical and I
knew of no other religious views, except as a vague rumour of
objectionable things; she was a Conservative in politics, or, as
she later used to say, a Liberal-Conservative, and I had no idea
that any reasonable creature held any other views. I had read
Milton and Keats, Scott's <i>Marmion,</i> some of Shakespeare's
plays, and various other standard poets with more or less tepid
interest, and Longfellow had spoken to my youthful heart; in
Scott's novels I had revelled. But I had scarcely so much as heard
the names of Shelley, of Mrs. Browning, of George Eliot, whose
works were now placed before me, and for all of whom I was soon to
acquire a love that for a period was almost passion. I still
remember the day when, during a school walk, Mackay first mentioned
to me the names of Rossetti, Swinburne and Morris, none of which I
had heard before, but all poets destined to mean much to me and one
to be known personally. If, indeed, I were to repeat all the names
that Mackay first mentioned to me I should have to cover the whole
nineteenth century in England and more. It was not, however, merely
that many great manifestations of the human spirit were now first
brought before me. That was bound to happen soon. It lay, even
more, in the stimulus of contact with my friend's vigorous mind,
for our relationship was soon that of friends rather than of master
and pupil. It was scarcely possible for him to speak a sentence
that did not strike sharply across the beliefs and conventions that
I had grown up in, that I had accepted, without ever thinking about
them. For the first time I realised that there were great questions
and problems in life, great aspirations beyond one's own personal
longings, great ideals to be passionately fought for. A touch had
awakened my soul and my intellect; they were now to work at no
man's bidding, not even Mackay's&mdash;who, indeed, never
consciously sought to influence me&mdash;but in accordance with the
laws of their own inborn nature. For years, however, Mackay was a
banner that waved before me on the road to fresh spiritual
conquests.*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* I wrote this in the summer of 1905, at
Carbis. Shortly afterwards, Mackay, who knew nothing of what I had
written, came to spend a few days with me in Brixton. It was the
last time I saw him. Six months later he died of a rapidly
developed cancerous tumour in the brain. At that time he had an
Anglican church (Holy Trinity) in Edinburgh, had published several
notable books, especially one on the Brontës, and was beginning to
make a name for himself.]</p>

<p>I was fortunate in my French master; I was fortunate, indeed, in
my English master; in more recent years it has been a regret to me
that I never had an equally congenial science master, or at all
events some friend to whom the scientific spirit and scientific
methods were a reality. Mackay had no native scientific tastes. I
was myself, I believe, instinctively possessed of the scientific
spirit and independently anxious to gain scientific knowledge. I
obtained and studied elementary manuals of natural philosophy,
chemistry, and geology; botany chiefly interested me (there, as in
some other respects, I seem to see the East Anglican temperament
emerging). I studied flowers with the aid of books. But I never had
a single scientific lesson of the most elementary kind at school,
and I never met anyone who had learnt to observe, or really loved,
Nature in her processes. I was never even taught drawing, to my
life-long regret, for that at all events is a discipline in exact
observation, and as a child I had a certain amount of natural taste
for it. My mother preferred instead to teach me music at home at
the domestic piano, and for that I had no real aptitude, though a
considerable amount of love. (I even, though entirely ignorant of
the science of music, "composed" and wrote down a few short
pieces.) I had as a child read and enjoyed Maria Edgeworth's
<i>Harry and Lucy,</i> which was written to guide boys and girls
into the paths of elementary science by story and play. But if I
had personally known someone who could have shown me how our daily
life is full of chemical problems, someone to whom the names,
structures and uses of plants were familiar, someone who would have
made me feel the vital mechanism of animals and men, I should
probably have been greatly helped and saved from wasting much time.
I had an instinct for exact measurement; at the age of twelve, or
earlier, I was measuring the varying lengths of the urinary stream,
and at seventeen I discovered for myself the fact that stature
varies during the day. But it was not until I became a student at
St. Thomas's Hospital, at the age of twenty-one, that I really
began to learn to observe accurately and to comprehend the
scientific temper. I discovered then how rare that temper is among
professional men of science.</p>

<p>So far as my masters were concerned, my life at Mitcham would
have been from first to last a peaceful and happy period of more or
less spontaneous mental development. But for a considerable time it
was made a hell by the influence of one boy. I shared a large
bedroom with two boys, both several years older than I was. One of
them was of quiet and inoffensive temperament when left to himself,
but he was always willing to become the tool and partner of the
third boy. This third boy, Willie Orr, may, for all that I know,
have possessed many fine latent qualities. But he was one of those
youths whose irresistible impulse it is to bully and dominate those
who are too young or too timid to resist them. His father was a
colonel in the Indian army; young Orr was probably fond of riding
(later he appropriately joined the Indian Frontier Mounted Police,
dying young) and in the absence of a horse he conceived the idea of
using me in that capacity. In order to carry out the idea in a
manner quite satisfactory to himself he made spurs in which pins
formed the working portion; every night he mounted my back with his
spurs on and rode me round and round the room in my night shirt,
handing me over to the other boy when he was himself tired of the
exercise. (I should add that nothing else, nothing of the slightest
sexual character, ever took place.) To a shy, sensitive and
reserved boy, one, moreover, who had never been harshly treated,
these performances were an acute nervous torture, out of all
proportion to any pain actually inflicted. I had no instincts of
pugnacity, and the idea of attacking or resisting a robust and
brutal boy older and bigger than myself never occurred to me. I
performed the required duties much as a real animal would have
done, without articulate protest or complaint, until my mother,
discovering something amiss with me, made me confess what was going
on, and came to interview Mr. Grover. I was then placed in another
room, which I shared pleasantly with a boy of character congenial
to my own. But I am inclined to think that the suffering I had
silently endured was not without evil influence on my nervous
system. I was just then at the critical period of puberty. While
subjected to this treatment, at about the age of thirteen, copious
seminal emissions began to take place during sleep, once or twice a
week, always without dreams or any sensations, and continued,
whenever I was alone, for some thirty years. Doubtless my
temperament predisposed me to such manifestations, though my
thoughts and my habits were, at this period, alike free from any
physically sensual tincture, but I incline to think that the state
of nervous excitement in which every night I fell asleep was a
factor in causing this lack of nervous stability in the new
function then developing. The emissions were themselves a source of
nervous apprehension, for I vaguely felt they were something to be
ashamed of; I constantly dreaded their occurrence and feared their
detection.</p>

<p>I was now entering on the period of adolescence, and it is time
to describe what sort of boy I was in the eyes of those with whom I
associated. When a baby, I had been, as the son of well-developed,
healthy and mature parents might be expected to be, a large and
robust infant, and I have already said how I appeared, on my
mother's lap, in all the happy insolence of vigorous babyhood, in
my earliest portraits which Olive Schreiner borrowed and lost, and
how in the next portrait, that happy, careless air gone, I appear
as a small child, in a frock, gazing out at the world of human
beings with a look of nervous anxiety and doubt, a look which,
whether or not it has gone out of my face, has scarcely yet
altogether gone out of my heart. It was a portrait that much
appealed to my wife, but foolishly remembering the fate of the
earlier portrait, I went on postponing a promise I had made to give
it to her, though she often reminded me of it, until it was too
late. At the age of seven, in a photograph taken in Sydney, I
appear with a sensitive but composed face (at this time it was said
of me that I always looked as if I had just been taken out of a
band-box), and again at the beginning of the Mitcham period I am
seen, now tall but still with the same expression, and an added air
of self-consciousness. My height, I may say, when full grown was 5
ft. 10½ ins. My weight has never been considerable (usually around
150 pounds), for I am not thickly developed and have never been
stout, though, on the other hand, I am not excessively slight or at
all emaciated. Olive Schreiner said once of my nude form that it
was like that of Christ in the carpenter's shop in Holman Hunt's
"Shadow of the Cross." I am fairly well formed and proportioned,
without congenital blemish or defect at any point, and the skin is
of fine texture, though not, I think, of feminine quality. The legs
are well developed, the arch of the instep unusually high, the
great toe the longest. The chest is not narrow but the arms are
relatively less developed than the legs, and the knuckles of the
fingers are slightly prominent; in this I am unlike my eldest
sister, whose hands are of aristocratic and fine shape. My eyes are
commonly called grey, occasionally blue; I call them
green&mdash;that is to say, blue with brown circles round the
irises&mdash;and my hair, which was light brown, became a dark
brown, and began to turn grey towards the age of forty. It seems
intermediate between that of my mother, which was rather auburn,
approaching sandy in the eyebrows, and that of my father, which in
mature life had been a brown approaching black. His eyes in early
life were said to be hazel, but in later life they were certainly
more nearly blue. My hair was and remains remarkably thick on the
head; the beard, lighter in tone, sparse and rather straggling. I
may add here that my mother when she kissed me used often to say
that my cheeks were scented, and my wife, who has frequently made
the same remark, has also said that my cast-off shirts have a
distinct odour of cedar. My face was not remarkable in adolescence,
and the occasional presence of acne pimples was a source of
distress which increased the humble self-consciousness I felt
concerning my personal appearance. It is rather a short face; the
chin, with the large dimple in it (seemingly inherited from the
Havelocks) is, I have been told, lacking in strength; the nostrils
are broad, and at the base of the nose is a marked indentation
which my mother used to think was caused by the forceps at my
birth, but that is unlikely, and a similar indentation may be noted
in various men of marked intellectual force and large heads. My
mouth is broad and opens widely, showing large white teeth, finely
formed and regular but not of strong texture, for they began to
decay early, and with the carelessness of youth I neglected them.
Dentally I resemble my mother, for my father's teeth were almost
perfect at the age of seventy. The facility with which my teeth
appear caused my schoolfellows to compare me, quite unjustly, with
that Roman Ignatius who smiled much to show his good teeth.
Internally my palate has a well-marked antero-posterior central
ridge, the <i>torus palatinus.</i> My head is large, 23 inches at
the greatest circumference, and I have sometimes had difficulty in
finding a hat to fit. In the absence of exact measurements, I
should say it is mesocephalic; it is certainly well removed from
dolichocephaly. In later days, on the whole, I hear that my head is
called "noble," and that my eyes are bright and, when I look anyone
in the face, beautiful, but that the lower part of my face is
rather "weak." There is, I may add, a peculiarity in the profile of
the lower jaw which is probably characteristic. I have never been
able to analyse it precisely, nor to say definitely that it is due
to prognathism, but when the head is raised there is, in some
aspects, a slightly ape-like suggestion. Boys are quick to catch
the faintest abnormalities, and my schoolfellows at Mitcham
sometimes, quite good-naturedly, would call me "Baboon." I must
admit the justice of the epithet, for something analogous, both in
my face and in my nature, has been visible to those who have known
me most intimately and most sympathetically. When in the National
Gallery once with Olive Schreiner before Rubens' "Silenus," she
laughingly noted my resemblance to the eager, bright-eyed satyr to
the right in the picture; and I must now add that more than thirty
years later a dear friend loves to call me "Faun." Edward
Carpenter, with the quiet twinkle of his luminous eyes, once said
of me: "He is the god Pan."*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Many years later he brought the same point
into a personal description in his autobiography, <i>My Days and
Dreams.</i>]</p>

<p>At the same time quite as many who have known me well&mdash;even
among those who called me a satyr&mdash;have half seriously and
half in play remarked a resemblance to Jesus Christ. My wife has
often told me that I am a mixture of a satyr and Christ. Both
points had before been noted by Olive Schreiner. I first heard of
the resemblance to Jesus from a fellow student at St. Thomas's who,
when I was one day sitting on a bench awaiting a surgical
demonstration, leant over to me from another bench at right angles
where he was sitting and said with a dry smile: "You remind me of
Jesus Christ." I frequently heard of similar remarks in the years
that followed. The fact that, owing to the thickness of my hair, I
had adopted the fashion of parting it in the middle, may have had
something to do with this. I do not think it was generally taken to
be a resemblance flagrantly in contrast with my satyr air. Nor
would I myself see any contrast. Pan and the satyrs were divinities
of Nature, as was Jesus on another plane. The wild being of the
woods who knelt in adoration before the secret beauty of sleeping
nymphs was one at heart with the Prophet who could see no more than
a passing stain of sin in the wanton woman kissing his feet.</p>

<p>These similitudes may suggest that there was about me something
slightly anomalous. It probably was so. Although my ancestry has
been English in the narrowest sense for some centuries at least,
and probably much longer, my physiognomy is not English. Foreign
physicians curious in such matters (like my friend by
correspondence, Paul Näcke, when he received my photograph) have
made this remark, and its truth has often been brought home to me.
I have been taken for a Spaniard in England, and in Spain Spaniards
have often taken me for a fellow-countryman. "Monsieur est russe?"
asked the new landlord when I alighted at the Hôtel Corneille in
Paris. "Flamand?" It never occurred to him, until his wife
suggested it, that I belonged to the nationality most often found
abroad. The Russian character of my physiognomy must be marked; a
Russian lady in the British Museum once addressed me as evidently a
fellow-countryman, and more than one friend has told me that I
resembled the early portraits of Tolstoy. It is perhaps significant
that the peoples I was thus thought to resemble are peoples with
whom I feel a special degree of affinity or sympathy.</p>

<p>It is evident that from boyhood I possessed a rather strongly
marked and peculiar face, however emphasised this may have become
with years; for it seems due more to its natural structure than to
any acquired impress on the muscles. It is curious to me that as a
boy I had a great horror of acquiring an artificially moulded and
wrinkled face. I used to observe myself carefully in the glass, so
as to be able to nip in the bud any wrinkling of forehead or
contraction of lips. This was by no means from fear of impairing
good looks, for I never imagined I had any, but solely because my
natural and instinctive ideal involved a fluid receptivity of mind,
an openness to impressions which was hostile to all rigidity and
fossilised restraint, and I felt, doubtless rightly, that the
hardening of mind and heart had its outward expression in a tightly
contracted face. The idea, which thus seems to have arisen in me
naturally, persisted for many years, whether or not it had any
influence on the character of my face.</p>

<p>Facial variation from the average of one's race and family,
however slight, doubtless indicates some degree of nervous and
psychic variation. That also was certainly present, and I believe
the germ of it was inherited from my mother. My father, with his
cheerful and superficial temperament, has always been wholesomely
normal, in nervous function as in all else. He never knew what it
meant to have a headache, and he seems to have known equally little
of nervousness or of shyness. In contrast to me, he was sociable
and always able to meet the demands of social life, not indeed
brilliantly but adequately and pleasantly; he has always easily won
the liking and regard of men and women of all ages and classes. My
mother, with all her fine and deep convictions, and a personality
outwardly dignified and impressive, was beneath the surface
congenitally emotional, shy, nervous, diffident, anxious,
frequently uncomfortable in the presence of strangers, and only
able to meet many ordinary eventualities of life with an effort of
will and, I believe, secret prayer. This is my temperament also,
and in a more marked degree. I am bold and fearless in abstract
matters, or when questions of principle are involved, but in small
practical matters I usually prefer to follow a leader. When left to
myself in the details of life, I am apt to be cautious, nervous,
self-suspicious, haunted by doubts when I have to choose between
two courses of action, and tortured by the thought that the course
I have rejected may have been the better. I cannot quite escape
this tendency even when it is only a matter of choosing a dish at a
restaurant, and my wife is always amused that I wait till she has
chosen and then usually make the same choice. This temperament
alone would probably have stood in the way of success as a
practitioner of medicine, though, in art as in science, it is
helpful since it aids self-criticism. I have never been the victim
of any definite morbid impulse, phobia, or obsession, but the
mother liquid out of which such things crystallise is for ever
flowing in my veins. In early life I was shy to an almost painful
extent. During the whole of adolescence and later I suffered from a
tendency to blush from slight causes or no cause at all. Until late
in life I found it difficult to look people in the eye, not, it
seems, because I minded them looking into my eyes, but because
there seemed to me something intimate and sacred in looking into
the eyes of others; to meet a stranger's eye casually gives me a
slight nervous shock and has often caused my lips to twitch
involuntarily into a sort of momentary pout. Any kind of position
or action which would attract public attention I find highly
embarrassing, and for the most part impossible, though as a child I
seem to have had nothing of this feeling and on the <i>Empress,</i>
at the age of seven, I would sing to the piano and enjoy the
applause. I have never made even the shortest speech in public.
This, with the diffidence it involves, renders me inapt for social
intercourse; there is nothing I find so depressing and so
oppressive, even so absurd, as ordinary social intercourse in a
roomful of strangers, as generally practised by the men and women
of the age into which I have been born. Whether the twenty-first
century will differ in this respect from the twentieth I cannot
guess. I am, moreover, awkward in movement, though not to any
notable extent. I always find it difficult, as my wife has
frequently told me, to conduct myself skilfully at a dinner
table&mdash;though I believe I have improved under her
training&mdash;or even to eat with becoming propriety, and although
as a boy I played cricket and the ordinary school games, I never
achieved any real skill in them, and football suited me best. This
awkwardness can scarcely be the result of defective training; it
seems rooted in an organic inborn lack of nervous stability. Many
of my larger muscles, especially of the leg, are in frequent
fibrillar activity. (I have just now, at the age of sixty-eight,
found it possible to verify this observation, though the movement
has become less frequent.) I first observed this at about the age
of twenty-three, when I was perhaps working too hard at my medical
studies. There is also a slight unsteadiness of the smaller
muscles, which is not visible but makes finer movements of any kind
difficult. My handwriting has always been lacking in backbone and
is frequently illegible, though as a small boy, and even now, I
could always write a clear and orderly hand by taking the requisite
trouble. My first schoolmaster used to say, aptly enough, that I
kept a tame spider to write for me, and Grover would remark with an
air of resignation: "You will have a hand of your own, my boy." In
this matter I inherit to some extent from my father, but his
handwriting, though invertebrate, was uniform and legible. Although
I am right-handed except in the single action of throwing a stone
or ball, I am inclined to think that congenitally I may be
left-handed, and that my right-handedness is the artificial result
of training, the spontaneous tendency only showing itself in the
untrained act of throwing. So much for the anatomical and
physiological characters, in such degree as I consider them
significant, on which my psychic characteristics have arisen.</p>

<p>To complete the picture I should add something as regards my
health during this early period of life. Though a healthy
breast-fed baby, at some period in childhood it seems that I ailed
somewhat and was taken by my mother from time to time to see London
physicians, occasionally to a noted homaeopathist who had been
recommended to her. I cannot recall in the slightest degree what my
symptoms were; they were certainly not severe, and I gather that
the physician sometimes thought that, as is probable, my mother was
unduly nervous about me. It is possible, though this I doubt, that
the beginning had taken place of a recurrent malady which tortured
me at intervals in later boyhood and during the whole of
adolescence.</p>

<p>I cannot remember when this disorder appeared; it certainly
occurred at fairly frequent intervals soon after the age of twelve;
it would come on rather suddenly with intense pain and tenderness
in (if I remember rightly) the right side of the abdomen, the
region of the caecum, a dull sickening unintermittent pain; at its
worst I could only lie on my back with thighs flexed, so as to
relieve the pressure of the abdominal walls. Vomiting always
occurred. Eating and sleeping, any mental or physical activity,
were alike impossible. Sometimes the attack lasted for hours,
sometimes for days, and recovery was always slow, tenderness
remaining for some time. The doctors I was taken to could evidently
make nothing of the case (Dr. Carpenter, I remember, on a second
visit to him, mistakenly recalled the seat of pain as being oil the
opposite side), and they did nothing to relieve it. Nowadays, I
feel certain, it would be regarded as a recurrent form of
appendicitis. (Half a century later, and long after this narrative
was first written, one day when staying at my third sister's house
at Tunbridge Wells, in robust health, after a rapid two-mile walk
to catch a train I had a sudden attack of duodenal ulcer, the
presence of which I had not detected, and a night of excruciating
agony, followed by several weeks in bed, the first severe illness
of my life. Appendicitis is regarded as a frequent precursor of
duodenal ulcer, and this tends to confirm my diagnosis.) As to the
cause, J can only suggest that it was connected with indigestion.
My digestion was never vigorous; in that I resembled my mother; my
father's had always been perfect, like all his functions. The
attacks occurred most usually when I was at home, and our midday
dinner was a simple and copious meal, of, most usually, a solid
joint of meat, potatoes and cabbage, suet pudding or fruit pie,
with a little English ale until my mother became a total abstainer.
It was an excellent meal for a plough-boy, but for me such a
combination, as I now recognise, is very like a poison, especially
if eaten without care and deliberation. And unfortunately I was, if
I do not indeed still remain, an incurably rapid eater.</p>

<p>These attacks gradually died down and had almost or quite
disappeared by the time I was twenty; but they merged into a
chronic tendency to dyspepsia which has more or less seriously
incapacitated me and greatly contributed to render me inapt for
social functions. If I am leading a healthy and leisurely
existence, much out in the open air, free from mental strain, able
to control the conditions of my daily life and my meals&mdash;which
should consist, if possible, of several small dainty dishes, served
at fairly long intervals, and with rest after the meal&mdash;then I
am usually able to escape my demon of dyspepsia. But any slight
aberration may nullify other favourable conditions, and then a
feeling of gastric swelling and discomfort slowly increases and
tends to become paroxysmal in character; I grow more and more
wretched, stupid, silent, absorbed in the consciousness of visceral
conditions, and unless I am free by a voluntary effort of
pseudo-vomiting to relieve the stomach of gas, pressure on the
heart causes faintness, and once or twice, in a theatre and in a
restaurant, I have actually fainted for a few moments from this
cause, the only occasions in my life that I ever have fainted. When
the condition becomes intolerable I usually invent an excuse to
escape, but I expect that my unexplained stupidity has sometimes
left an ineffaceably bad impression on kind hosts. I am inclined to
suspect that, like Nietzsche, I have some dilatation of stomach,
but the suspicion remains unverified. It was this constantly
recurring dyspepsia which caused me to overlook the symptoms of
duodenal ulcer until actual haemorrhage occurred. (With the
approach of old age, after the attack of duodenal ulcer, when
dieting became imperative and self-control easier, and especially
when I had learnt the benefit of avoiding much fluid at meals, the
condition improved and seldom caused more than minor
inconvenience.)</p>

<p>On the whole, though not robust, I was a fairly healthy boy. As
a child I had none of the usual childish fevers, except a slight
attack of chicken-pox. I have never throughout life had any long or
dangerous illness. (Needless to say, the duodenal attack occurred
many years after this was written.) When I was about thirteen I had
a slight feverish illness which the family doctor seems to have
thought was possibly a touch of typhoid, and he declared that I had
"no stamina" and that I was "threatened with consumption." The
threat was never realised&mdash;though my eldest sister afterwards
developed this disease&mdash;but the observation about the absence
of stamina probably contained an element of truth. I mean to say
that there are some persons whose nervous systems seem to be of
such tough fibre that they can stand prolonged strain without
apparently feeling it, and can work at high tension during long
periods, the resulting collapse, when at last it appears, being,
however, serious and leaving often a life-long nervous weakness. I
am not of that type; I am sensitive to the earliest signs of
nervous stress; rest or, rather, change, speedily becomes a
necessity; I bend and so I never break. This kind of temperament is
associated with the fact that, for me, all work must be of the
nature of play. If it is work, as work is usually understood, I
find it arduous. So that when people tell me they wonder at the
amount of work I get through, I honestly, if not truthfully,
answer: "Work? Why, I never work at all; I only play." If I had not
always been sensitive to the signs of nervous strain, and almost
instinctively careful to guard against them, I might have become a
nervous wreck. When I was about twenty-one, living at home at the
beginning of my medical studies, while at the same time my literary
activity began to develop, my brain became very active, full of
ideas I wanted to work out; I began to suffer from sleeplessness
which I treated myself by occasional doses of bromide or chloral. I
quickly realised the necessity of good hygiene; I made it a rule
not to work late at night, and never to occupy myself with any
literary work in the evening or to read any exciting book. This
rule I have seldom broken; I like to read before going to sleep,
but always an unexciting book; an architectural book or magazine
just now I find best, for it is always interesting and yet soothing
to me. The result is that I have never again suffered seriously
from sleeplessness and never again been tempted to take any
soporific drug.</p>

<p>This kind of nervous temperament has been allied, happily, no
doubt, with that instinctive temperance which, as I have already
said, I inherit from my father's family. It is the English form of
that quality which the Greeks praised, whether or not they
possessed it. Not only is every kind of excess repugnant to me,
both mentally and emotionally, but I have not the organisation
which would lend itself to excess. This seems to me a fundamental
characteristic. I think it has coloured the whole of my moral
ideal. I am on the side of freedom and nature. I look for the
coming of Thelema and I accept its ethical rule: "Fais ce que
vouldras." I know that, so far as I am concerned, while I am living
a free and healthy life I am not likely to hurt either myself or
others by doing what I like, and it seems to me that this is more
or less true of most people. But there are some persons&mdash;a
minority, I feel sure, and perhaps a congenitally abnormal
minority&mdash;of whom this is not true. These people have the
temperament of excess; they seem to crave for the hard bit and the
tight rein; there may well be some doubt as to whether my code of
morals would suit them. I can only say that if these people are, as
I believe, a minority&mdash;though, as I well know, often very
fascinating, very lovable&mdash;we must make our moral rules to
suit our majority. The main point, certainly, is to find the law of
one's own nature.</p>

<p>I left school at the age of sixteen, and for a time lived at
home (now at Wandsworth Common), making myself useful by acting as
tutor to my two elder sisters, both younger than I was. What my
occupation was to be, how I was to earn my living, I had not the
slightest idea. My formal education was over, and though it had
been a little above my parents' means, I had not been educated for
any profession or employment. Nor, though full of eager interests,
was there any career that I wanted to enter. Like the youthful
Diderot, I wanted to be nothing, absolutely nothing, though, as for
him, "nothing" for me meant something not very far removed from
"everything." By inborn temperament I was, and have remained, an
English amateur; I have never been able to pursue any aim that no
passionate instinct has drawn me towards. At this period I was at
the beginning of adolescence. My thoughts were much occupied with
ideal dreams of women and love; my attitude towards life was
embodied in an "Ode to Death," in which I implored Death to bear me
away from the world on gentle wings, although at the same time I
had no thought of taking any steps to aid Death in this task. Yet
the lack of vocation on earth troubled me much, and also caused
some mild concern to my parents, though they never put any pressure
on me to bring this uncertainty to an end. My father was too
easy-natured for that, and my mother had too much faith in God, and
too much faith in her son's abilities. "Do not worry about Harry,"
she said to my father, probably about this time, and with a
confidence which impressed him, for he told me of it many years
later. She was right in her insight, but I have taken a great many
years to realise that she was right. It seems likely that if
literature could have presented itself to me as a possible career,
that would have been the career to appeal to me. I loved reading; I
had been writing verse and prose, out of the love of doing so, for
some years. I had even sent letters to religious and other
newspapers and seen my letters printed. But literature never
presented itself to me as a means of livelihood, and, if it had, I
lacked the ambition and self-confidence to believe that I could
succeed in it; when, more than ten years later, I actually turned
to literature as a vocation, it was as an editor rather than as a
writer that I sought my living; I have never written for a living,
only out of inner compulsion. Ambition I have never had&mdash;it is
not a matter either for pride or for shame but merely of
temperament&mdash;and the belief that I could win a position in the
world never came until, late in life, the position was won. I have
a certain dogged persistence in quietly keeping on my own path and
working out my own nature; this obstinacy alone has brought me what
success I have achieved, and the success thus gained was preceded
by no enjoyment in imagination. The only possible career that
wavered before my mind was that of religion. My mother, religious
as she was, had never suggested it to me, and I was quite ignorant
of the perhaps significant fact that many of my ancestors had been
parsons. At least four years earlier I had fallen into the habit of
carrying a little Testament in my pocket. Moreover, I had been
stirred by the preaching of the Rev. Erck, the vicar of Merton,
whose church my mother attended. I was at Merton Church every
Sunday from the age of twelve to fifteen, when we left Wimbledon. I
have already mentioned Erck, who only died last year (1910), as an
extraordinarily eloquent and typically "Celtic" Irishman, shy and
silent in private life, but a lion in the pulpit. I vaguely
proposed to myself to become a minister but was not quite sure what
Church I would enter (my friend Mackay at that time was more
closely associated with the Congregationalists than with the
Anglican Church, in which later he became a priest), and I still
have a letter from Erck urging me to choose the Church of England
on account of the greater "liberty of prophesying" that Church
offered. I was destined to need an indeed large liberty of
prophesying. Even when I received that letter (at the age of
fifteen) it is probable that my own faith was already being subtly
undermined, and my vague notion of entering the ministry was
rapidly dissipated.</p>

<p>It was in the course of my reading that I slid almost
imperceptibly off the foundation of Christian belief. No personal
influence entered. I had never talked with an unbeliever on
religious matters, indeed, I scarcely knew one, though I was aware
that my uncle Joe, my father's youngest brother, was&mdash;although
he had a special regard for my mother and she for him&mdash;a
"free-thinker."*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* When this was written, in 1911, he was still
alive, the affectionate father of a large family, brought up away
from the churches, to which they returned with avidity. He died of
influenza and bronchitis in 1915, a few months after my father,
whose death was a great shock to him, but he remained sprightly and
alert to the last, a remarkable figure in old age; I sometimes met
him at concerts, for he was musical, playing the 'cello and singing
in the chorus at Handel Festivals.]</p>

<p>While still at school I had bought a cheap reprint of the
English translation of Renan's <i>Life of Jesus.</i> It was
probably the first "infidel" book I ever read. I read it carefully,
with considerable admiration, though still from the Christian point
of view, and the notes that I made on the margins of its pages were
critical. But it served to familiarise me with the non-Christian
standpoint. At the age of sixteen, when I left school, and was
about to accompany my father on his ship, I purchased among other
books for the voyage a second-hand copy of Swinburne's <i>Songs
Before Sunrise,</i> and at the same time, or soon after reaching
Sydney, the notorious <i>Elements of Social Science</i> (by George
Drysdale), which I had somehow heard of. They both had an influence
in stimulating the course of my thought away from Christianity,
though the tone of the <i>Elements</i> was thoroughly uncongenial
to me. To these I should probably add, as a subtler but deeper
influence, the volume of Shelley's poems which at this age, and for
two years later, was a greatly loved companion, read and often
re-read. I now reach the great formative period of my life, when my
destiny was finally sealed.</p>

<p>My father was soon to sail for Sydney, in the ship <i>Surrey</i>
which he then commanded, with a large batch of government
emigrants. I had just left school, and though in fairly good health
and free from definite disease, I was not, as I perhaps never have
been, robust. My parents doubtless bore in mind the report of the
family doctor, as well as my recurring attacks of disabling
abdominal pain. It occurred to them that the vigour of my health
would probably be established, and the way prepared for my
settlement in life, by a voyage round the world&mdash;before I
began to earn my living. It was an idea that does credit to the
fundamental wisdom of my parents, though they could not know how my
whole life may be said to have hinged on this decision of theirs. I
cannot recall that I greeted the plan with enthusiasm, for such a
voyage was no novelty to me. But I certainly accepted it without
demur, for at least it enabled me to postpone that melancholy
problem of a money-earning occupation which lay so heavily on my
thoughts. The <i>Surrey</i> was carrying emigrants, and no ordinary
passengers are allowed on an emigrant ship, but the diffculty was
overcome by putting me on the ship's articles as "captain's clerk,"
with the consent of the emigration officials, though one of them
remarked at Plymouth, more or less jokingly, that I was a good size
for my age and might cause havoc among the single girls. My father
afterwards bantered me on the exemplary way in which I proved the
groundlessness of that official's fear. Woman occupied an enormous
place in my ideal life, but it never occurred to me to identify her
with any one of the crowd of emigrant girls on board the
<i>Surrey.</i></p>

<p>My preparation for the voyage consisted mainly in a supply of
books chosen by myself and bought with the aid of money supplied by
my parents. They were mostly literary works of good quality in
English and French, with a few in German. Some of the books I took
with me I still possess, notably Spenser, Rabelais, and
<i>Faust.</i> There were no real scientific books, except a few
text-books procured with the object of working for matriculation at
London University.</p>

<p>My father added a harmonium to my equipment, at least as much
for his own sake as mine, for he sang and, like all his family, had
a simple taste for music. I had been taught the piano some years
earlier, chiefly by Miss Johnston, my mother's old friend (once a
teacher in my grandmother's school), and I specially delighted in
strumming some of Beethoven's sonatas, fragments of Schubert and
Mendelssohn's <i>Songs Without Words,</i> though the last I
outgrew; I never played well, but it was a useful method of
emotional relief until the age of eighteen; since that age (when I
left Carcoar) I believe I never touched the piano again. I said to
myself that what I could not do well was not worth doing. Perhaps,
also, I ceased to find emotional relief in the piano since my
emotions were ceasing to be diffuse and taking on more definite
forms. The harmonium, however, was not a sympathetic instrument to
me, and the career of this particular instrument was brief. When we
had only been a few weeks at sea a tremendous and abnormal wave
struck the stern cabin, my father's and mine&mdash;fortunately when
we were at breakfast&mdash;burst through the ports, swamped the
saloon, injured the chronometers, and with much other destruction
ruined the harmonium. I seem to have accepted this catastrophe with
characteristic coolness, for years afterwards my father used to
tell smilingly that my only remark was: "Does this often happen?"
He himself had been perfectly cool, as indeed sailors have to be,
for they live habitually in an atmosphere of impending
catastrophe.</p>

<p>The <i>Surrey</i> left London on April 19th, 1875. From this
date, and during the four years I spent in Australia, I kept a
diary in a solid manuscript book purchased to this end, so that for
the approaching formation period, when nearly all the seeds of my
life's activities were sown, I could if I please&mdash;though I
have not done so&mdash;check my recollection by the entries in this
intimate contemporary record.</p>

<p>Except Olive Schreiner, none has ever read this diary, not even
my wife, though it contains nothing I had any wish to hide from
her; but to Olive, with her large tolerance and her active
intellectual receptivity, it seemed in 1884 easy and natural to me
to bare my inner self. I sometimes think that with increasing years
and ill health she has become less tolerant, less receptive, but we
have long been separated by all the waves of the Atlantic.*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* A few years later when she came again to
live in England I clearly realised how changed she had become in
this respect. I remember how a young woman friend of hers once came
to me and in a first interview told me of herself what, she said,
one could not tell to Olive because one knew she would not be
sympathetic.]</p>

<p>We proceeded from London to Plymouth to take on board the
emigrants. During the few days here I recall that we stayed at
Lucey's Hotel (a house which, many years later, I have looked
around for in vain), and that one night my father took me to the
theatre. I do not remember what we saw, but it was my first visit
to the theatre. My mother possessed the moral objections of the
Evangelical training to the theatre (though she had once taken me
to a play at the Crystal Palace), and my father when at home
adapted himself to her scruples, but at other times he shared the
love of amusement natural to the sailor on shore. More vividly than
the theatre I recall a visit to a lady at Devonport who had a
charming daughter and a buxom girl friend, both a little over my
own age. On the following day they visited the ship. The mother,
who had evidently noticed my shy awkwardness, remarked that I
needed "some jolly girl friends." That remark stayed in my memory.
It was certainly true. I had never had girl friends of my own age;
my sisters were much younger and still children; girl comrades
might have despiritualised my ideas of women but would have
wholesomely harmonised them.</p>

<p>My definite memories of the voyage are few. For the most part
they are fused with all my memories cf voyages on the sea, with the
magic of a sailing-ship&mdash;so exquisitely responsive to Nature,
sometimes idly calm on a glassy ocean, sometimes swiftly driven
onwards, furling and unfurling her canvas wings to the
breeze&mdash;of the vast blue foam-crested rhythmic waves of the
South Atlantic, of the wild free birds of the sea, above all the
albatross and the gull. I most clearly picture myself laboriously
struggling with the first pages of <i>Faust,</i> for it was not
until a year or two later that I really gained some mastery of
German through becoming absorbed in Heine. My chief interest during
the voyage was certainly in the adolescent impulse to write verse.
I had written verses from time to time since I first fell in love
at the age of twelve. But now I vaguely had in mind the scheme of a
whole drama. So far, although I had read much poetry, only three
poets had deeply stirred me: first, of course, Longfellow, the
supreme poetic evangelist to boyhood, at all events for my time,
and, after that, Mrs. Browning's <i>Aurora Leigh</i> and Alexander
Smith's <i>Life Drama,</i> two volumes that Mackay had lent me a
year or so before I left England. Passages in <i>Aurora Leigh</i>
had aroused my idealistic emotions to the highest point. But the
<i>Life Drama,</i> with its extravagant Elizabethan imagery and its
unrestrained emotionalism, probably made the most intimate appeal
to my adolescent soul. The outline and the tone of the drama I
proposed to write&mdash;so far as it had any definite outline and
tone&mdash;were due to Alexander Smith's romantic poems, though I
may also have been influenced by Bailey's <i>Festus,</i> which I
had bought a little before and carefully read, with interest though
no excitement. A number of fragments in blank verse were written
during the voyage, and after that&mdash;nothing. I quickly realised
that I had no strong native impulse in this direction. I confined
myself henceforth in verse to translation and the sonnet, with an
occasional lyric. In prose I wrote almost nothing until my last
year in Australia; my early crude efforts had ceased before I left
England. I learnt how to write verse before I seriously drew near
prose. I think now it is the right course and that my instinct was
sound.</p>

<p>When the ship entered Sydney Harbour and the Port Medical
Officer came on board, he was informed by our ship's surgeon, Dr.
Sheridan Hughes, that there were cases of chicken-pox among the
emigrants. Hughes had discreetly kept this to himself, so it was a
surprise as much to the captain as to everyone to find the
<i>Surrey</i> ordered to the quarantine station, at a beautiful and
solitary cove, in charge of an Irishman called Carroll. Hughes was
Irish, too, a genial man and capable, but one to whom the writing
of the simplest letter presented almost insuperable difficulties.
So in the official correspondence which quarantine involved the
"captain's clerk" was at last found useful. We were delayed at
Spring Cove three weeks.</p>

<p>I have little recollection of the first weeks in Sydney,
scarcely more than of my earlier visit to the same city ten years
before. I remember that we continued, as was usual, to live on
board while the ship was unloading at the Circular Quay which
remains familiar to my memory. I remember that very soon after our
arrival my father took me to a concert which was largely a recital
by some famous violinist whose name I forget; it was the first time
I had heard the solo violin and what a few years later was to
become for me the most exquisite music in the world seemed at this
first hearing to be really just the scraping of horsehair against
catgut and so ludicrous that I could scarcely refrain from
laughing. And I remember a visit to the theatre which produced an
altogether different effect; Ristori was in Sydney and my father
took me to see her in <i>Pia de Tolumei</i> and (in English) the
sleep-walking scene in <i>Macbeth;</i> more than fifty years later
(as I re-write these lines) I can see her still in both parts; for
classic simplicity, for concentrated intensity with extreme economy
of movement, I have never seen her acting excelled. I remember,
again, that we used to go to dinner on Sundays to the house of the
ship's agent, the Hon. G. A. Lloyd, a member of the Legislative
Assembly and formerly Treasurer of the Colony; he had a tall and
numerous family and after dinner we would all solemnly sing hymns
round the piano. Of more significance for my fate was another
acquaintance of my father's, Alfred Morris. He had been first mate
when my father once took emigrants to Australia many years earlier,
had married one of the girls on board, thrown up his post, and
settled in Australia, where he had practised a number of
employments, being a clever and versatile Welshman, well spoken and
of good presence, but superficial and unstable, never able to
persevere in the tasks he was fitted for, and, naturally, always
failing in the others. At this moment he had just joined forces
with another man also Hying on his wits, one Frederick Bevill, a
baronet's son, born in France and lately from Japan, still youthful
but enormously fat and correspondingly good-natured. They had taken
a little office between Pitt Street and George Street and under a
pompous name set up an educational agency. Now it happened that the
<i>Surrey</i> was to proceed from Sydney to Calcutta, and Dr.
Hughes had told my father that the Indian climate would be
unsuitable for me. At this point Morris put in a suggestion and
proposed that the General Educational Registration Association
(that, I think, is what he called his little agency) should find me
a post as assistant master at some Sydney school. This proposal was
accepted, on my part, it seems, as easily as on my father's. Morris
made no attempt to investigate my aptitude for such a position, but
in one of his former functions as headmaster of a little school in
Melbourne he wrote a glowing testimonial to my abilities, and
therewith (since his name happened to be also that of a
distinguished and better known headmaster in Melbourne) he was able
in his function as agent to secure for me at once the post of
assistant master at a good salary to Mr. Hole who had a private
school, Fontlands, at Burwood near Sydney. Here I was settled
without delay to the apparent satisfaction of everyone.</p>

<p>Therewith the first stage of my life ends. I now entered the
world. I entered it indeed very thoroughly, without a single friend
(except in so far as I can so count Morris), without anyone who
cared for me in the whole southern hemisphere I had been dropped
into. I am sure that I never myself realised how important a moment
it was; I could not know how my whole fate in life hung on it. A
little sign indeed I recall which at the outset indicated a new
stage of mental development. For it was then, as I have already
told, that I read <i>The Pirate,</i> brought with me from England,
one of the few of Scott's novels I had never read, and that, for
the first time, I found Scott wearisome. The inner world of my
boyhood had imperceptibly slipped away. I realised with a pang that
I should never open a volume of Scott's again. I never have. But I
was about to open a book which held greater revelations than Scott
could bring, and in Australia to find my own soul.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4"></a>Chapter 4</h2>

<p>My career at Fontlands was short and inglorious. Mr. Hole soon
discovered that I was unable to carry my pupils far in classics,
and that I had no interest in games. He gave me notice to leave and
reduced my salary to a figure more suitable to a youth of sixteen
who was completely inexperienced, not specially well taught
himself, and with no aptitude for any schoolmastering art. But he
remained friendly, and still found me useful. When I left he gave
me a pleasant testimonial in which he referred to my special
success in teaching French. It was, perhaps, the one subject I had
myself been fairly well taught.</p>

<p>The apparent blow to my vanity&mdash;if I had any&mdash;seems to
have made no deep wound, and the memory of the month at Burwood is
not unpleasant. I was launched into the world, and that brought the
agreeable realisatibn of freedom and the knowledge that I was for
the first time earning my own living. I was, too, drinking in
impressions of a new and beautiful land. I recall the evening walks
under the large and clear Australian sky to the quiet country inn
where during the first week I had to sleep; I recall myself
wandering in my leisure moments through the spacious school grounds
reading the <i>Faerie Queene,</i> which I had leisurely begun on
board ship; I shall always remember the magnolia tree that grew by
the schoolroom door, and the masses of heliotrope in the garden
beds, for then I first realised the delicious scents that a warm
southern clime can fill the earth with, and ever since magnolia and
heliotrope have held for me a magically entrancing fragrance.</p>

<p>The boys were a singularly well disposed set, and after Mr. Hole
had measured my abilities I found my work fairly easy,
notwithstanding my constitutional deficiency in disciplinary
control over boys. Then there was the friendly and hospitable
Australian social environment. An invitation from the clergyman's
daughter to spend the evening at the parsonage (an invitation due
in the first place to the belief that I was one of the older boys)
remains memorable. There was a service that evening and I
accompanied the clergyman's family to church. On the way back while
he was walking at the head of the party with a lantern, I,
following behind beside the daughter, suddenly fell into a deep
ditch by the unfamiliar path; I strained my right leg and, being
unable to rest it during the following days, I bear about with me
the mark of that visit to church, in the shape of a varicose vein,
to this day. I have a more agreeable and perhaps more memorable
social recollection of Burwood. Near by, a retired sea-captain
called Fox was comfortably' settled, and once or twice I was
invited to his house. He had several pretty and charming daughters
with whom I was on terms of superficial acquaintance. No more, but
without being in love with any one of them I vaguely desired more,
yet felt myself powerless, in my inexperienced awkwardness, to
attain more. All the obscure mysteries of sex stirred dimly and
massively within me; I felt myself groping helplessly among the
difficulties of life. The first faint germ was formed within me of
a wish to penetrate those mysteries and enlighten these
difficulties, so that to those who came after me they might be
easier than they had been to me. The personal situation was, I
suppose, that of nearly every shy and sensitive youth before my
time. But&mdash;as I look back half a century later&mdash;I see
that here had come a youth whose impulse it was to intellectualise
and moralise his own personal situation, thereby transferring it
into an impersonal form, and universalising it. The first gleam of
insight was so slight, however, so far from the shape it was to
assume later, that it is now only with an effort that I can
associate plainly the first resolve to take up the task that has
mainly filled my life with the avenue of trees, as I paced up and
down it one day, in the school grounds at Fontlands.*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* In 1936 my friend Marjorie Ross, in Sydney,
explored Burwood, then a populous suburb, on my behalf. But she
found that the avenue had been swept away, and an old inhabitant
could not even recall Mr. Hole's school.]</p>

<p>There were many preliminaries to be gone through, to prepare me
for that great task, and I was yet far from realising their
difficulty. When I left England I had the idea of matriculating and
graduating at London University, after the example of my friend
Mackay, still cheerfully unaware how inapt I was for academic
exercises. I had brought text-books with me on the <i>Surrey</i>
with that end in view, and occasionally worked at them. Now I so
far modified my intentions as to resolve in the interim to
matriculate and perhaps graduate at Sydney University. I knew no
Greek, so at Burwood and later I was frequently and strenuously
occupied with uncongenial Greek verbs. I duly matriculated, I think
in the following year, but not in Greek, and the reason may now
seem curious. There was an accomplished classical scholar, locally
famed for his eccentricity and sharp tongue, at the head of the
University called Badham (whose name and origin I have since learnt
to associate with my own ancestral town of Sudbury) and he had set
as the Greek book for this examination an ilynthiac oration of
Demosthenes. I could not find a single copy of it left in the
bookshops of Sydney, and I was on this account, at almost the last
moment, exempted from Greek, but I enjoyed the gracious wisdom of
Cicero's <i>De Senectute</i> which, with the <i>De Amicitia,</i>
was set for Latin. In this way it came about that the only
University with which I have ever had any connection whatever has
been the University of Sydney. The connection was useful to me for
it served later as an Arts entrance to the study of medicine.</p>

<p>Shortly after leaving Fontlands, a little tired of school
teaching, I took a post as tutor in a private family on a station
called Goongerwarrie, a few miles from Carcoar beyond Bathurst. The
journey was by rail across the Blue Mountains, and then from
Bathurst by a Cobb's coach, a vehicle somewhat resembling the
European diligence. There was a new rush at that moment to some
lately discovered gold diggings in the Carcoar district, and the
coach was overcrowded, one young woman having to effect the journey
on the knees of a man she had never before seen. I remember this
journey in the cramped and jolting coach, in the cold darkness,
over the rough irregular roads, where at spots we had to descend
and walk, as one of the worst of many experiences of wretchedness
in my memories of travel, which yet has been one of my chief joys
in life. In the hurry and novelty of this first long journey alone
I forgot my luggage, a large old chest, at the Bathurst railway
station&mdash;a lapse which has often occurred to me since in
dream-life but never in real life&mdash;and it was not until many
days later that I saw it again.</p>

<p>My new employer was a Government official in Sydney, who had
lately retired at a comparatively early age to settle on the
country estate he had acquired. He was a remarkably quiet man, of
kindly and considerate disposition, who appreciated my
correspondingly quiet nature, and when I left wrote in the
testimonial he furnished me with that I "gave no trouble in the
house." We suited each other well, and never the slightest
difficulty arose between us. Mrs. Platt was of much the same quiet,
good-humoured disposition as her husband, a woman of the
intelligent but distinctly feminine type which has no ambition to
go outside a strictly domestic sphere, and with her also I had no
difficulties though we had little to say to each other. The
children, boys and girls ranging from five to fourteen, took after
the parents, were easy to manage, and showed no troublesome
stupidity and no excessive cleverness.* Only one of them has left a
vivid memory, and that is the elder girl, ten years of age, a quiet
but arch and intelligent child of her mother's type, who exerted an
attraction over me which I was myself still too much of a child to
understand or to control.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* More than fifty years later one of them
arrived at the door of my rooms at Brixton, asking me if I
remembered the name of Platt. He told me he was an engineer, then
making a European tour, and he seemed surprised that his early
tutor remembered Goongerwarrie so well.]</p>

<p>I spent a year at Goongerwarrie. Mr. Platt had, I understood,
given his place this name (now, I believe, spelt Goongawarrie),
which is the aboriginal word for race-course, because it was
adjacent to the Carcoar race-course, where races were held once a
year. On this occasion I wandered on to the course, innocently
passing through the rails without paying the entrance money I knew
nothing about&mdash;the only occasion in my life when I have been
on a race-course. This was a year of peace externally and for the
most part internally. My tasks involved no strain at all; there
were no amusements within reach; I cannot recall that visitors ever
came to the house. Occasionally I went out with Mr. Platt in the
buggy or on horseback. One little expedition I specially
recall&mdash;as it brought me in contact for the only time with
gold-mining&mdash;to a crushing works many miles away, the sound of
which could sometimes be heard with a favourable wind even from the
Platts' estate.</p>

<p>For the most part I was well content to spend my spare time
alone with books. In the morning I would go out for a walk before
breakfast through the grounds, a book in hand. Often this early
morning book was Main's <i>Anthology of English Sonnets,</i> and I
made it a rule to commit one to memory on each such morning. Some
of the sonnets thus learnt, especially those of Shakespeare,
Wordsworth, and Mrs. Browning, cling to memory yet. It was
certainly this exercise which inspired me at the same time to begin
writing sonnets. I had written blank verse on the <i>Surrey;</i>
the sonnets which I now began to write were more personal and
original.</p>

<p>As soon as teaching hours were over in the afternoon, I would
start out again with some other book, often the poems of Shelley
which I was still always re-reading, and with undiminished
enthusiasm, though after leaving Carcoar my reading of Shelley came
to an end for I had absorbed all that I could of his spirit. Yet I
was not blind to the typical scene of Australian bush around me. It
was at Carcoar, while revelling in a new adolescent world of
poetry, that I first realised the beauty of Australia. At Burwood
it had been the night sky, the clear moonshine, the far horizons
that had fascinated me. At Carcoar it was especially the wealth of
brilliant bird life, and the forms of the trees&mdash;with the
curious variety of manna gum I only knew there&mdash;but above all
the typical wattles of Australia which there seemed to me to grow
with peculiar loveliness and luxuriance, so that they still float
in my mental vision.</p>

<p>Yet although the prevailing memories of that year at
Goongerwarrie are of calm routine, of an external atmosphere of
peace and beauty, of an internal atmosphere of poetry, there were
yet intervals of unrest, even of misery and despair. There was the
trouble of youthful sex and the trouble of youthful religion. I was
a teacher in a responsible position, yet still half a child so far
as sex was concerned, innocent and virginal. My eldest girl pupil,
six years younger than I, was a fascinating, saucy, alert little
maiden, in her instincts quite as old as I was, and older. I felt
her charm and even showed that I felt it&mdash;when sometimes she
stood close beside me, in presence of the others, with her slate or
exercise books&mdash;in ways that now seem to me daring and
incomprehensible, for they were completely spontaneous and without
reflection, so that as I look back on myself at that time I see the
revelation of an innocence I could scarcely have credited in
another, and others certainly would not credit in me. Fortunately
they were never asked to. The little coquette fell naturally into
the woman's part, accepted my attitude and the furtive caresses of
my hand, and playfully exerted the authority she knew she had
acquired over me. In later clays I have wondered how she looked
back on her tutor. Sometimes, after she had snuggled up to my side
with her slate of sums, and the hours of school were over, and I
started off alone with my Shelley into the bush, I would feel, for
the first time in my life during waking moments, the physical
presence of the impulse of sex, manifested so far only as the
slight urethrorrheea which the casuists described, and not yet as
actual seminal emission which never occurred in waking life until
two years later, as the spontaneous climax of the pleasurable
reading of Brantôme. When I look back I realise that we must not
sit in judgment on the young. They cannot understand themselves,
and their pyschoanalytic elders wildly misunderstand them.</p>

<p>These experiences were superficial. They were only the scarcely
conscious by-play of a deep instinct not yet fully awakened. Much
more poignant were my religious difficulties. A year earlier I had
completely lost the large and simplehearted religious faith I had
learnt from my mother and accepted and made my own without reserve.
A great blank had been left.</p>

<p>That early religious faith, genuine as it seemed, had fallen off
me without any struggle. It was not my own, and when my real self
awoke and gazed at it, I found that it would not bear inspection.
At fifteen, when I read Renan's <i>Life of Jesus,</i> I had not
accepted its thesis; I made critical comments on the margins. But a
year later, when I read one or two books of a free-thinking and
agnostic sort, I found that I agreed with them: my faith was gone.
Although it went so easily, that was by no means because I desired
it to go, or because I felt that I gained anything by its going.
Nothing whatever had replaced it. By following what seemed to be
the Call of Truth I had merely entered a blank and empty desert. At
about this time I read Friedrich Strauss's <i>Old Faith and
New,</i> and it seemed to me to represent the world fairly enough,
as the world looks when faith has gone, but Strauss's sunny
Philistine satisfaction in the "New Faith"&mdash;which to me was no
faith at all but merely the presentation of a cold and dead
mechanical world&mdash;altogether repelled me. I brooded over it,
over this alien universe of whirling machinery in which I seemed to
be enmeshed. Sometimes, too, with all the morbid nervousness of an
ignorant youth who had been impressed with what Drysdale in his
<i>Elements of Social Science</i> wrote of the dangers of seminal
emissions during sleep, I also brooded over the unknown problems of
my own sexual nature. And I recall how, walking up and down the
garden path at Goongerwarrie, I reached the conclusion that there
was no outcome except by death or possibly by becoming a monk. That
was a mood, and I took no practical steps in either of those
directions. But such moods characterised my disposition at that
period, and corresponded to a real emotional undertone, which
continued manifest at intervals, though less strongly than at
Carcoar, until the age of nineteen.</p>

<p>During all these years, however, in the background of mental
conflicts and in the intervals of depressed moods, there was a
perpetual growth in intelligence, a constant broadening and
deepening of culture. The conflicts and the moods were helpful,
indeed, by adding intensity to my emotional nature and critical
acuteness to my intellect. My one luxury, during all this
Australian period, was books. I subscribed to the <i>Literary
World</i> (a habit acquired from Mackay), which kept me informed as
to what was being published, and I ordered books from England
through IZobertsons, and also once or twice had a case of English
and foreign books shipped from London. Moreover at the shops of the
second-hand Sydney booksellers&mdash;there were only two that then
counted, Lindsay's and Skinner's&mdash;I had some happy finds,
notably a complete set of Heine in fresh condition at Lindsay's
from which I selected all the volumes I fancied, about a dozen, and
Swinburne's first series of <i>Poems and Ballads</i> at Skinner's.
They both soon meant much to me, and I possess them both still.</p>

<p>Then there was the Sydney Public Library. From the first,
whenever I was in Sydney and with nothing else to do, that library
was an unfailing source of inspiration and delight. No library has
been so influential in guiding and moulding my mental activities.
It furnished the pasture for my fresh and eager intellectual
appetites, instinctively choosing the food they needed, and was
admirably adapted for that purpose. There were many good books, and
few readers, and no formalities. I could wander where I would, and
settle in some quiet corner to devour what I chose. Here in
beautiful dishes&mdash;for there were some fine editions on the
shelves&mdash;the gods bountifully granted to me the nectar and
ambrosia on which my spirit was fed. It was here that I learned to
love the prose of Landor which I found in a stately row of volumes.
Here I began to become acquainted with Stendhal, by reading the
early English life of him (almost the first Life of him ever
written) by Paton. Here I came on to the dignified volumes holding
the works of Brantôme. Here also I discovered a very different
work, the <i>Anthropométrie</i> of Quételet, which responded to my
instincts on another side and was the first spurt to my active
interest in anthropology. I at once began a careful process of
self-measurement and soon made for myself the discovery that the
morning height differs considerably from the evening height; it was
a discovery which had been made before me, but when, many years
later, I received a visit from a wellknown American anthropologist
who had measured the height of thousands of school-children to the
millimetre, he was still quite ignorant of a fact which concerned
him so much, and which I had discovered about the age of
seventeen.</p>

<p>In another direction I received illumination in the Sydney
Public Library. I one day took out of a drawer a large and finely
illustrated volume about modern artists and came upon a
reproduction of Burne-Jones's <i>Merlin and Vivien.</i> It seems to
have been the first typical picture of his I had seen, and it was
the immediate revelation to me of a new perception of the world and
a new attitude of art. I had distantly admired Filippo Lippi and
his fellows in London, but here I saw the union of that ancient
almost supernatural beauty with the naturalistic realism of my own
age. The vision of a requickened antique art which then flashed
upon me remained a lasting inspiration. In the years that followed
it eventually happened that I was awakened to other and quite
different manifestations of art which have enabled me to reach a
deeper insight into its possibilities. But I have never failed to
understand the message of the so-called "Pre-Raphaelites" (who
really derived from Ghent at least as much as from Florence) for
the young generation of fifty years ago, in its revolt against the
dead academicism of that period. For a later generation that revolt
is meaningless; it has itself become vulgarised into banality.
Every young generation needs a new revolt, a fresh inspiration.</p>

<p>One other incident, characteristic enough to mention, is
associated with the Sydney Public Library. When I left England I
had brought with me a complete edition of Rabelais in French,
induced to buy it by a reference in Macaulay's Essays (which I had
carefully read) to Rabelais, as to a curious and rather indecorous
old author not without interest. I had gone but little way in
penetrating the ancient and fantastic French of which Rabelais was
such a master before I made a great discovery. I discovered that
this old author, whom the Puritanic Macaulay&mdash;though he
doubtless knew better&mdash;had described as an extravagant, if
remarkable, buffoon, was in reality a marvellous genius, a profound
thinker, a daring pioneer. In my youthful innocence I imagined that
this was a new and original discovery, and resolved to write an
essay by which to announce it. To begin, it was clear to me, I must
make a thorough study of the age in which Rabelais lived. During my
first months in Sydney I ransacked the Public Library with this end
in view. But I soon found that with every step my task became wider
and deeper. I realised that to write an adequate essay on Rabelais
would be the work of a lifetime. As it was not a task on which I
was disposed to spend a lifetime I dropped it. A few months later I
discovered that, in any case, the task was unnecessary. I had
procured Coleridge's <i>Table Talk</i> from England, and in that
book I found a passage about Rabelais, of but a few lines only, but
embodying an estimate indeed unlike that of the Philistinish
Macaulay, an unqualified and enthusiastic recognition of Rabelais's
immense genius. Here was a fellow-adventurer who had discovered the
same spiritual continent that I had discovered! No critical
judgment has ever caused me such a leap of joy. I still treasure my
copy of this precious little book.</p>

<p>Thus my first attempt to contribute to literature failed, though
but narrowly, to be an essay on Rabelais. I am sorry, for I could
not have set out under a more congenial banner, and it seems to me
now that I have always sought&mdash;instinctively and
involuntarily, it may well be, rather than deliberately&mdash;to
live in the habit, and follow the rule, of the Abbey of
Thelema.</p>

<p>When I was left alone in Australia I began naturally to
experience those versatile interests and activities which filled my
life for many years subsequently, and to a considerable extent fill
it still. I call them "versatile," but they were far from being
promiscuous, for each was severely tested and only admitted when
found to be a coherent part of my spiritual organism; the interests
that I have accepted are as nothing to those I have contemplated
and rejected. For the rest, I carried out my duties as a teacher as
faithfully as I could, though with no great success, because I was
temperamentally inapt for the teacher's vocation, save with pupils
who are themselves apt to learn. I resolved to become an assistant
master again, and had no difficulty in obtaining a post at the
Grammar School, as it was called&mdash;though that meant merely an
ordinary private school needing only a single assistant
teacher&mdash;at Grafton on the Clarence. I remember the final
interview with the headmaster, who had called on me at my
boarding-house in Castlereagh Street to settle preliminaries. I was
suffering from one of those more or less acute attacks of what I
now believe to have been a form of appendicitis&mdash;the last, as
it turned out, I ever had&mdash;which had affected me at intervals
ever since I was a young boy. I was so ill I was obliged to cut
short the interview, and I recall that my new employer looked at me
with some misgiving, in evident doubt whether he had perhaps made a
mistake by engaging an assistant of such uncertain health. He was
himself young; he never suspected that, while I should be alive and
well half a century later, he himself would be dead in a fortnight.
He was a pale, thin, austere young man, possessing in a marked form
what I used to call the <i>facies Christiana</i> (his father, whom
I met later, was a Presbyterian minister on the Clarence), the face
which tells of natural instinct repressed by a perpetual stern
control, imprinting on the mouth the fixed lines of high tension.
In his case this tension was more than the organism would bear. I
never heard all the details of his brief illness, but it appears
that on this visit to Sydney he indulged in an unwonted lavish
expenditure on furniture and other luxuries, and that outburst was
the precursor of a swiftly fatal "brain fever" which killed him
even before the school-term was due to open. It was proposed that I
should succeed him as headmaster, and not a word was said as to any
payment by me for the transfer of the school. This, as I now
recognise, was a most generous proposal, and if I had possessed any
aptitude, and any desire, to adopt the teaching profession, my
fortune would thus have been made at the outset of my career. My
successor, a year later, a capable Scotchman, had no difficulty in
creating a large and prosperous school out of what I transferred to
him in a worse state than I had received it. Butas I have
experienced on many occasions in quite different fields&mdash;it is
useless for Opportunity to present even the most attractive
forelock to one who was not born to seize it. And I was so clearly
not born to be a successful headmaster that I have never for a
moment regretted my failure to grasp firmly that particular
forelock.</p>

<p>Grafton, situated well up its fine and broad river, is in the
north of New South Wales, towards Queensland, and so lies in
sub-tropical latitudes, with sugar canes cultivated on its banks
and delicious melons and pine-apples in the gardens, being indeed
the hottest region I have ever dwelt in for a prolonged period. It
was nominally already a city with a Mayor and Corporation, and the
seat of a bishopric; the Cathedral indeed had not yet been built,
though stones had been gathered together on the proposed site. But
if nominally a city it was actually no more than a straggling
village, very unlike what it was later to become, and when in 1929
I received from an old Australian pupil a series of to me
unrecognisable views of Grafton, it was hard to believe that the
village had grown into so splendid a town. There was indeed a real
bishop, whom I remember once seeing, though I never but once went
to church, when I chanced to cross the river in the ferry-boat with
him. I recall the incident because he was accompanied by a young
lady just out from England, and never before had I realised the
exquisite delicacy and loveliness of the English complexion, which
so soon fades into dull sallowness beneath the hot dry sun of
Australia; for there are two lovely and delicate things that
flourish in England and perish in Australia, the fresh green of our
grass and the fresh pink and white of our girls' complexions.</p>

<p>For my own part I had no fault to find with the climate of
Grafton at any time of the year. Certainly it was hot, sometimes
very hot, and then I would take my walks at night; but I never had
reason to complain of the heat; my health was excellent (I have
noted that it was on coming to Grafton that I lost for ever my
attacks of supposed appendicitis) and my spirits, as always with me
in the heat, remained good, although I had some just cause for
depression. I never once experienced that melancholic dejection
which occasionally befell me at Carcoar. But though I could not
regard myself as a success at Grafton, I enjoyed a comfortable hone
in the house of a delightful family, ready to receive me
hospitably, not merely as a paying guest but as a friend. The
school house was built near the house and in the grounds of Mr. F.
W. Chapman, an auctioneer and prominent citizen of Grafton, who was
completing his term of office as Mayor at the time I arrived, and
had, I think, been active in establishing the school. He was not
altogether prosperous just then, and having imprudently backed a
bill for a considerable sum he became bankrupt and a compulsory
sale of the household goods was held amid much friendly support
while I was there. I was one of some halfdozen boarders&mdash;men
professionally engaged in the town&mdash;who were received in the
roomy house. I have the pleasantest recollection of Mr. and Mrs.
Chapman and their large family. It was indeed the only time in
which I have lived habitually and on friendly terms with a large
family of strangers, and I owe to this experience my best insight
into the real spirit of Australia, as Australia then was.</p>

<p>The family consisted mostly of girls, still all unmarried, from
the age of about twenty-five down to near infancy. They were of
diversified character but lived in complete harmony, and organised
themselves to carry on the whole work of the large house, and the
half-dozen boarders, without servants. This they achieved most
efficiently, taking turns, week by week, with some of the harder
house-work, and, moreover, with no false shame, or any feeling that
housework could be "menial," although, I need scarcely say, it was
not usual for the prominent people of Grafton to dispense with
servants. They were housemaids and cooks, they cleaned the grates
and stood at the washtub in the open air, and had no outside aid,
except that we boarders would help to wash up after meals. Yet they
took their house-work easily and were by no means subjected to it.
In the afternoon they would perhaps mount their horses and go for a
run with their brother, and in the evenings they played and sang (I
can still hear distinctly the chief airs of <i>Maritana,</i> the
opera at that time they liked singing) with considerable
accomplishment, and now and then they cleared out the large
dining-room and invited a few friends from outside to join them for
a little dance.</p>

<p>It was the second daughter, May, twenty years of age, who most
disturbed my emotions. She was tall and well-made, dignified and
reserved. I had not been in love since my boyish misplaced passion
for my cousin, seven years previously, and my adoration&mdash;it
was not passion this time&mdash;went out to the graciously imposing
May. I worshipped in silence; I would have denied&mdash;indeed I
did deny when chaffed by a discerning fellow boarder&mdash;that I
worshipped at all. After I left Grafton I made no attempt to see
her or communicate with her, but merely wrote some verses, to which
I prefaced the words of Goethe:</p>

<p class="quote">"Wenn ich dich liebe, was geht's dich an?"</p>

<p>I am fairly certain that if I had desired to make any advances
they would have been rejected. She was friendly to me but scarcely
sympathetic, cool, perhaps rather quizzical. She seemed, indeed, to
be cool to men generally; in late years I have heard that she
became the wife of one of the boarders, certainly, as I remember
him, the worthiest of that prize. To me nothing tangible remains of
my adoration but a hairpin, once fallen from her hair, which I
picked up and devoutly preserved. I got on much better with her
sister Berta, who was of my own age. She was shorter, with brown
sympathetic eyes, pretty, but far too kind and gentle to have any
of May's dignified aloofness. We had much in common; she was an
accomplished musician, and would play for me my favourite Beethoven
sonatas of that period, especially the Pathétique. I hear that she
now has three sins, distinguished musicians, who tour the world
often accompanied by their mother, Mrs. Kennedy, and would have
been in London before now if it had not been for the Great
War.*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Later I repeatedly met her, as well as her
sons; and we remain in a friendly relationship more than fifty
years after we first met.]</p>

<p>Though I made no attempt at intimacy with Berta I felt that we
were friends by natural temperament, and when, on finally leaving
Grafton, I held her hand to say good-bye I saw tears gleaming in
her tender eyes.*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Whence some verses, addressed to her, which
I wrote a few months later but never sent to her until fifty years
afterwards, when they were at last printed.]</p>

<p>Once, when the family went, as the custom was, to spend a
fortnight at the Clarence Heads, I asked Berta to keep a diary of
the stay for me. This she neatly and cleverly accomplished. I have
that diary still, and if she ever visits England I hope for an
opportunity to place it again in her hands.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* This was duly effected a few years
later.]</p>

<p>I count my knowledge of the Chapman family the chief gain that
came to me from my years at Grafton.*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* For some years after leaving Grafton I
corresponded with Mrs. Chapman. Her letters ceased, no doubt about
the time of her death, and for thirty years there was silence.
Then, through a young lady at Sydney who admired my books, I again
came into touch with old Mr. Chapman, who wrote me several letters
until his death about the time of the death of my father, who was
the same age. I have lately heard from Mrs. Kennedy that he was of
Suffolk origin, and so this family furnishes another example of
that instinctive affinity with people of the same race which I seem
to find in my experience. There was intermarriage with a Chapman
among my Suffolk ancestors, though not in the direct line.]</p>

<p>The mention of Clarence Heads recalls a little incident which
had its significance as an index to my inner life. During the
holidays I went to Sydney, and on the return journey the ship
grounded on the bar at the entrance to the river, so that we were
delayed on board for a day or so. One of my fellow
passengers&mdash;another teacher, if I remember
rightly&mdash;improved the occasion by flirting with a girl he had
become acquainted with on the boat and sat with his arm round her
for several hours; towards night, having evidently thus acquired
all the satisfaction he desired, he generously introduced her,
unasked, to me, also merely an acquaintance by virtue of our sea
passage together, and left us alone. We walked once or twice up and
down the deck, and she remarked to me by way of opening the
conversation: "Ain't the moon lovely?" Such a feeling of loathing
rose up within me that in a few moments, after briefly responding,
I said it was time to go below, and wished her good night. That was
the nearest approach to intimacy with a strange woman during the
whole of my four years of adolescence in Australia, where, however,
as I had opportunity to observe, the relations of the sexes were
often facile.</p>

<p>The Chapmans initiated me into an entirely normal aspect of
Australian life. When the boarders were gathered together with one
or two professional young men from outside, I learnt to know from
the conversation of some of them that freedom of language which is
often regarded as peculiarly Australian though in my experience it
was exceptional. In this little group of young men I had to listen
to obscene stories of a monstrously crude and impossible type which
merely disgusted me, not because I fail to appreciate the obscene
but because licence or extravagance, to be enjoyable, must at least
have in it an element of sense or of wit. No doubt my companions
were more chaste in life than in speech. One of them, a little
lawyer who arrived from Sydney, during my stay, aroused some mild
curiosity and joking by his visits to an unknown lady who lived in
Grafton, but eventually it came out that she was his wife by a
secret marriage. The Chapman family, simple and wholesome, was
outside this atmosphere, though aware of its existence, and no
attempt was made to draw them within it. As a headmaster I was
distinctly a failure. It was hardly indeed the right place for a
boy of eighteen. But my chief defects no years would have supplied.
I was without the educational equipment, the love of games, the
moral control of boys, needed for success as a teacher. Discipline
in my school was deplorable; at least one of my pupils was more
clever at study than I was myself and doubtless knew it; pupils
began to drop off, and parents began to make uncomplimentary
remarks about the management of the school. Such a state of things
was not favourable to friendly relations. I was received with real
friendliness in one house only, outside the Chapmans', though that
was the kindly and hospitable home of the one man in Grafton who
belonged to the wider world in which my spirit moved. He was an old
doctor with a charming wife much younger than himself&mdash;their
only son being my pupil*&mdash;and he had the air of one who had
moved in fine society. Dr. Purdie had, in fact, a considerable
knowledge of the European world, and in youth had studied in Paris.
He told me how once, on the staircase of a Paris hotel, half a
century before, he had accidentally jostled Meyerbeer, who had
graciously interrupted his apologies: "Cela ne fait rien."</p>

<p class="footnote">[* More than half a century later I see the
notice in the London <i>Times</i> of the death of a young man named
Purdie at a house called "Grafton," not so very far from where I am
now living, and imagine it to concern the grandson of my old friend
and the son of my pupil.]</p>

<p>Meyerbeer belonged to Heine's world, and at this time&mdash;for
my troubles as a headmaster in no way weakened the ardour of my
absorption in literature&mdash;I was soaking myself in Heine. It
was at Grafton that I translated a number of Heine's <i>Lieder</i>
into English verse; they are as good as most translations, though
not so good that I would desire to publish them, which I have never
attempted to do. It was then probably, or soon after, that I made a
version of some portion of Goethe's <i>Dichtung and W'ahrheit.</i>
I also translated Musset's <i>Rolla</i> into blank verse about the
same time, and made an English rendering of Renan's dramatic
version of <i>The Song of Songs.</i> During my stay at Grafton,
perhaps more than at any time in Australia, I indulged in books.
They were indeed my one luxury. I never smoked; in food and drink
my tastes were at that time of the simplest; occasionally, when in
Sydney, I went to an opera or a concert. But I bought all the books
I much wanted to buy.</p>

<p>As I had few friends in Grafton outside the house, and though I
admired the broad river, there was no attractive scenery in the
immediate neighbourhood; it was easy for me to settle down in my
schoolroom every day when the attempt to educate my pupils was
over, and to renew the never-ceasing and always delightful task of
educating myself. At that time I had become much interested in the
technique of verse. On board the <i>Surrey</i> I had begun and laid
aside my fragmentary attempt at a blank verse drama, and at
Carcoar, where Main's anthology of English sonnets was my constant
companion, I found that that form specially appealed to me, and it
became my first congenial medium of intimately personal expression.
But, sensitive as I was to poetry, I felt that I was still largely
ignorant of the technical methods that lay behind the poetry that
impressed me so deeply. I was reading Tennyson much at that time,
never with the passion that Shelley inspired; but, for that very
reason, I could bring to the study a more searching and intelligent
interest, more than I had ever applied to poetry before, and it was
in Tennyson, whether by chance or by sound instinct, that I studied
the mechanism of poetry. For Tennyson was a great artist as well as
a real if not a great poet, though I was at one time tempted to
share the reaction which those of my generation felt to the
extravagant estimates of the previous generation. One cannot but
admire an artist who could so well reproduce, in what is without
doubt poetry, the surface and texture of things. It was, however,
chiefly the emotional effects in his best lyrics which I was at
first interested to investigate; also I studied <i>In Memoriam</i>
with much care&mdash;again moved by intellectual curiosity, for I
had little sympathy with the argument&mdash;making an analysis of
it. F. W. Robertson had made one before, but I had not seen it,
though a little earlier I had acquired and read with interest his
sermons and his <i>Life and Letters.</i> Taken altogether, during
my stay on the Clarence, I was continually extending and deepening
my knowledge of literature and especially of poetry.</p>

<p>At the end of nine months I was ready to leave Grafton. The
school had become impossible, and was rapidly dwindling away. I had
only one pupil at Grafton whom I can look back at with any
satisfaction, and it was not a school pupil. A German doctor,
outside Grafton, Schroeder by name, being on a visit to his
homeland, sent his daughter, a girl of sixteen, to board with the
Chapmans. She was large and muscular (I recall the grip of her hand
when I was introduced as the most painful handshake I had ever
experienced), the representative, physically and mentally, of a
familiar German type, and the first I had encountered. Quite in the
German manner, she was to employ her time to educational advantage,
and I was asked to give her French lessons. That was a subject I
liked teaching, and she was a good pupil, though her personality
was of no interest to me; so I was not Abelard and she was not
Heloise.</p>

<p>I resolved to sell my school. The audacity of this resolve,
under all the circumstances, now appals me; but the idea was
suggested by my friends, Morris and Bevill, who, as educational
agents, saw therein a profit. It so happened, however, that I
discovered a buyer for myself, a Mr. Mackintosh in South Australia.
Messrs. Morris and Bevill sent in their bill for commission
nevertheless, and I paid it without demur, for that is the penalty
for doing business with friends. When, however, Mackintosh arrived
in Grafton he refused to pay me more than a small portion of the
sum agreed upon, for, as he truly pointed out, he would have had
most of my pupils in any case. I agreed without protest, and bore
him no ill-will. I even lent him at his request, a curious book on
sex I had found in Sydney and never seen a copy of since, and he,
on his part, failed to return it. He was a capable man in whose
hands the school flourished, and in a few years' time was finely
housed.</p>

<p>My brief career as headmaster of the Grafton Grammar School thus
came to an end. It was not a post to which I had been born, and I
should not have succeeded much better even if my years had been
many more than seventeen when I took it up. I said good-bye to my
good friends in Grafton, and the last definite vision I have is of
the tears that stood in Berta's tender brown eyes. I was not to
meet her again till more than forty years later when she was a
grandmother, though wonderfully little changed. Of the passage in
the boat back to Sydney I have no recollection at all.</p>

<p>Soon after my return I resolved to enter the Government service
and become a qualified teacher under the Council of Education which
at that time controlled elementary education in New South Wales. I
suppose it was Morris who suggested this career, which was really a
good one, and, indeed, it proved for me of incalculable benefit. It
meant at the outset a three months' period of training at the Fort
Street School in Sydney, and I am not at all sure that this may not
have weighed with Morris, for I had little money left after my
experiment in headmastership, I could not afford to stay long at my
usual boarding-house, and Morris could take me as a lodger on
moderate terms which yet meant a helpful profit in his own state of
chronic financial depletion. He had a high opinion of my moral
character as well as of my intelligence and general knowledge; I
recall how once in the course of some scientific or philosophic
argument in which I had held my own against him, he remarked at the
end, in the words of Faust, that much learning had made me mad. In
practical matters I expect he regarded me as a fool; once he took
me to a bank where I wished to open my first banking account, and
when the formalities, in which I was of course a tyro, were over,
and we were leaving, Morris looked back, and I glanced round just
in time to catch a grin and a wink&mdash;which I affected not to
notice&mdash;addressed to the clerk behind the counter. It was not
in my nature to feel resentment, and I recognised that Morris was,
after all, a friend and indeed a sort of guardian in my absence
from home; so if I was sometimes made a fool of by him it was with
open eyes. I could, if I liked, retort on him. For he made a
greater muddle of his life all through than I have ever done at any
period. From the time (and even I believe earlier) when he threw up
his position as mate on my father's ship to marry a penniless and
ordinary emigrant girl and settle in Australia, he had been a
perpetually rolling stone. Meanwhile, children were growing up
around his meek and much fatigued wife, and the house was scarcely
a happy one; one day on returning home late and meeting a mild
reproach he took up his hat again, without a word, and went to a
publichouse. All this was new to me; I accepted it without even
internal comment and without seeming to notice.</p>

<p>So these three months of training were not pleasantly spent,
though I cannot say that they were acutely distressing. I wandered
all day about the class-rooms at Fort Street, following the
prescribed routine with my fellow students (one depressed ambiguous
man confided to me, I remember, that he had previously been a
private detective), and after school hours returned to the little
house of the Morrises at Woollahra where I witnessed the cold
family relationships and overhead Mrs. Morris deferring the demands
of dunning tradesmen, and slept at night on a bed made up on the
sofa in the sitting-room. Morris was, however, a sociable man, and
had various interesting friends and visitors. Among these was a
family of French Canadians, the Papillons, and my pleasantest
recollections at Woollahra are of Miss Papillon, a girl a little
over my own age. She had all the vivacity and intelligence and high
spirits of her race, together with a complete freedom from
sex-consciousness. She would play mischievous little tricks on me,
always of an inoffensive kind, for she was eager to be friendly.
Once&mdash;and the incident was too characteristic of me&mdash;she
made frantic and fruitless efforts to attract my attention from the
opposite side of a theatre, reproaching me when we next met for
being "in a brown study." She would come behind my chair to fasten
her garters, and when I naturally turned round and detected her,
remain unabashed. It was she who asked me to show her my books and
when I took some of them out of my big chest paid me the
compliment&mdash;more gratifying than any paid me in that line
since&mdash;that I had a better collection of books than any young
man she knew. She treated me with all the frankness and trust of a
comrade and friend; it was precisely such a comrade and friend,
making no appeal to sexual emotion, that I then needed. But I never
put out my hand in response&mdash;possibly because May Chapman was
still in my thoughts&mdash;and I doubt whether we ever exchanged a
single letter. I saw nothing more of her, and was too absorbed in
my own ideas and my own ideals ever to regret her absence, though
now, when I look back and remember what dear and delightful friends
I have had in my life who have been of more or less French
blood&mdash;one above all&mdash;I view her with tenderness as the
earliest of them.</p>

<p>In all these respects I manifested that passivity which has
never ceased entirely to be an element of my character, though it
seems most pronounced at this adolescent age. It was not merely
receptive, it was more often resistant. I always seemed to lie
sensitively open to those influences of Nature which were
sympathetic, and I would curl up closely at once against all those
influences, and they were many, which were antipathetic. But there
was no impulse of active response in the first case or of active
aggression in the second. It was the slow and massive attitude as
of a tree. Intellectually I may possibly possess the plastic hand
of the potter moulding his clay. But in most matters my temperament
seems rather that of the clay, moulded by the plastic hand of
Nature, with this peculiarity, that while I can bear for ever the
shape thus imposed upon me, I can also withdraw at will and become
impenetrable to every moulding influence which is not akin to my
own substance. I am a child of Nature, but she has to be a careful
artist in what she seeks to make of me, there are so many ends I am
unfit for.</p>

<p>When the casual course of my training at Fort Street was over, I
had to give a test lesson to a class to show how I shaped as a
teacher and to pass an informal examination by a Scotchman called
Forbes, who asked me a few questions and gave me, if I remember, an
easy passage in Latin to translate, while he improved the
occasion&mdash;it was midsummer&mdash;by eating an orange. Then I
had one or two interviews with Mr. Wilkins, the Secretary and
directing force of the Council of Education, and shortly after
received an appointment as Teacher at the Half-time Schools at
Sparkes Creek and Junction Creek, with instructions to proceed
thither almost at once.</p>

<p>The appointment might seem a humble one for the late headmaster
of the Grammar School of the city of Grafton, yet it was a good
post to offer a youth of eighteen, and much more profitable than
that I had left. I had a fixed salary of £108 a year, together with
small fees I was entitled to charge the scholars' parents; I had an
allowance of £12 a year for a horse, whether or not I chose to keep
a horse (I considered it unnecessary), and I had a schoolhouse to
live in rent free. This was equal altogether to nearly £220 a year.
Moreover, living in the bush was cheap; my own demands (except in
the matter of books) were still abstemious, almost ascetic, and
there was little possibility of spending money even if one were
tempted to extravagance. During the year I was in the service of
the New South Wales Council of Education I was really better
off&mdash;with more freedom from anxiety and less pressure of
work&mdash;than I ever was again for some thirty years. Not that my
income was not often (not always) larger during these years, but my
needs were greater and the responsibilities I incurred made demands
on me unknown at Sparkes Creek. It was not indeed until some years
after marriage that I again had a banking account of my own (in the
earlier years of marriage my wife was my banker), and often and
often I have reflected, perhaps with some bitterness, when I have
had to worry over pence, that with a reputation that was extending
round the world my financial position was less satisfactory than
when I was quietly earning my living as an unknown boy in the
Australian bush. I know well enough, and I knew all along, that my
post at Sparkes Creek was merely a temporary and necessary stage in
the plan of my life, and that the attainment of a comfortable
position, or the making of money, was for me an altogether
secondary aim in life.</p>

<p>The entry on my new duties was not altogether auspicious. It was
easy to go by rail to Scone&mdash;some hundred miles&mdash;where, I
was told, I would receive all necessary information about my final
destination. I went at once to see the clergyman at Scone, Shaw by
name, a large, fair, placid, kindly man who lived with his sister
in a comfortable parsonage where he invited me to spend the night.
He had some sort of official position in connection with my
schools, but he knew almost nothing about them, and had seldom
visited them. (I cannot remember that he ever came out while I was
there.) So he took me to see the Scone schoolmaster, a dark
vivacious little Welshman. Roberts, as his name was, proved a
hearty and helpful colleague; he told me what little he knew of my
post from previous teachers (taking me to see my immediate
predecessor, a lanky, dispirited Australian with no qualifications)
and he offered to lend me a horse and the guidance of his son to
take me out to the place, eighteen miles in the bush. Soon after
breakfast at the parsonage&mdash;its comfortable bed dwelt in my
memory for it was long before I was to know another such&mdash;the
kind and hospitably clergyman bade me good-bye, and I mounted the
horse supplied by the schoolmaster, who was evidently suspicious of
my horsemanship, for he carefully pointed out to me which side to
mount, and I set out on my journey to Sparkes Creek, accompanied by
the youth, who had evidently been warned that I was probably not a
firstclass horseman, and we proceeded leisurely, so leisurely that
it was well on in the afternoon before we reached the farm of old
Ashford, the chief settler near my school, where I had been told
that it would be easy for me to find lodging. It turned out to be
far from easy, for the wiry little old man, dried up by hard
pioneering work, who had been the first to settle in this
valley&mdash;giving it a name derived from the old home near
Birmingham whence he had come in youth&mdash;had a large family and
no room to spare. But he agreed to make up a bed for me on the
settee in the living-room, and my friendly young guide returned
home with the spare horse, covering the ground, I am sure, in far
less time than we had spent in coming. I passed, I think, two
nights in these close and uncomfortable quarters, making
acquaintance in the daytime with my schoolhouse and with the two
other settlers in the valley, brothers of the name of Barwick,
originally coming from English Kent, and each with a young family.
Then old Ashford came to me and said, in his rough way which was
not unkindly meant, that I could stay in his house no longer, he
had a sick daughter in the next room&mdash;I never perceived any
sign of her&mdash;and my presence was inconvenient; I must go and
live in the schoolhouse. I saw for myself that there was no
alternative. So I put on my tall silk hat and took up my little
bag&mdash;one of the Barwick brothers brought out my big box of
clothes and books in due course&mdash;and went my lonely way to the
schoolhouse. I felt very forlorn. Now at last I was completely
adrift, altogether, it seemed, cut off from civilisation. I felt
like a lost child, and my eyes, as I walked, smarted painfully with
unshed tears. There was no need to shed tears and as a matter of
fact I never shed them. If I had known it, I might have seen in
imagination such a railing of gold around the little spot I was
approaching as Rousseau desired to erect round the spot at Annecy
where he first met Madame de Warens. I met no woman there, or man
either, who meant anything to me, but I was to find there one who
must mean more than any person: I found there myself. This year
1878 was to be in all exterior relationships the loneliest, the
most isolated, of my life. But it was also to be for my interior
development the most fateful, the most decisive, of all my
years.</p>

<p>The schoolhouse, surrounded by a rail-fence of the usual
Australian bush sort, was situated a hundred yards or so on the
slope above the creek&mdash;which was most often a mere string of
pools though sometimes a raging torrent&mdash;at the point where
the path crossed it leading to Ashford's farm. It was built of
rough-hewn slabs, letting in the air at places, and had a shingled
roof, through the chinks of which at night I could see the stars
pass across. The house consisted of two rooms&mdash;each, however,
having a small portion partitioned off at its back part&mdash;with
separate doors on to a verandah in front. The room on the right was
the schoolroom; it contained the usual large open fireplace with a
broad chimney; and it was supplied with a table and rough school
forms and desks. The other room was for the teacher's use and
contained nothing but a makeshift bed, formed by a framework of
four poles supporting two sacks and resting on four legs which were
so insecurely attached that occasionally the whole structure would
collapse during the night. Otherwise I found no cause for complaint
in it, and used it during the whole of my time at Sparkes Creek,
not only at night, but to rest on during the day, as there was no
chair in the place, and in the schoolroom I sat on a form at the
table. I think there was a little bench to support a tin bowl to
wash in with water obtained from the creek, though for drinking
water I would take a bucket to the well on the land of the nearest
Barwick family, a few minutes' walk away. Otherwise there were no
necessaries or conveniences whatever, beyond a little shed outside
for a privy. After the first plunge, however, I cannot recall that
I felt any discontent. I certainly made no attempt to add to the
furniture of my establishment, beyond a minimum of cooking and
eating utensils, for the rest being content with the most casual
makeshifts. I was more interested in the furniture of my mind than
of my body, and if my house was but a fragile shelter against the
sky, that sky itself made a delicious house for me.</p>

<p>The first night, certainly, was wretched. I was desolate, not
happy on my rickety couch, and in the large chimney I heard wild
beasts of some kind noisily scampering up and down, while in the
morning I found that a bandicoot or some such small marsupial had
evidently made a comfortable nest in my silk hat, leaving some of
his hairs behind. Strangely enough, that first night, so far as I
can recall, was the only night I was ever disturbed by such
visitors. A more usual disturbance was caused by the huge moths
which would enter by the skylight above the door and dash noisily
against the walls.</p>

<p>In a few days I was peacefully settled in my schoolhouse. The
material basis of my new existence was swiftly established. It was,
indeed, the easier by virtue of that vein of
asceticism&mdash;sometimes, perhaps, a more aesthetic
asceticism&mdash;which the life at Sparkes Creek doubtless
confirmed in my disposition. Under the ordinary conditions of
civilised life it might have remained for ever latent. My natural
timidity with regard to taking the initiative in material matters,
so altogether unrelated to my attitude in spiritual affairs, would
probably have always held me back. But for my everlasting good
fortune I was flung into the wide sea of Australian bush alone, to
sink or to swim. Naturally I swam.</p>

<p>It was not a long list of simple material requirements that I
made out, and I engaged one of the Barwick brothers for the day to
go into Scone and obtain them for me from the Chinese dealer in
everything there, one Charles Trogg. The Chinaman was equal to all
my demands, and throughout my stay at Sparkes Creek I never had
occasion to buy anything from anyone else at Scone. For the rest,
my bread and milk were supplied from the household whence I had
been ejected and brought every morning by one of the daughters, my
pupil, a gentle silent girl, who also sometimes brought me a
present from her mother of a peach pie or the like dish. I had meat
sometimes from one. Thus was settled, very easily and quickly
settled, the physical basis of my life.</p>

<p>On this basis soon began the routine of my professional duties.
That also was established with as little trouble as the physical
mechanism of board and shelter. It was, indeed, the only phase of
my uncongenial career as a school teacher that I controlled without
effort, almost without thought. The instruction was of the most
elementary kind, and its nature and methods were at every stage
prescribed by the Council of Education. There was nothing left for
me but to follow the simple routine in which I had been trained at
Fort Street. The children, moreover, gave me no trouble. The girls,
who were perhaps in the majority, were faultless. My predecessor
told me he had some difficulty with the biggest ones; but I had
none, nor ever have had in dealing with girls; it was with the boys
I was apt to fail.</p>

<p>My walk over the hills several times a week brought fresh,
delicious insights into Nature, such as now came to me for almost
the first time in my life. The fauna of this region was new and
strange, more abundant than I had elsewhere seen. Round Carcoar I
had chiefly observed snakes of various kinds, and many birds,
including flocks of cockatoos, and families of parakeets. Here
there were few snakes (the snake I chiefly recall, long and tawny,
lived, I believe, beneath my verandah, for I once saw him lying on
it), and not many birds. But there were many creatures of other
kinds, huge jew lizards that lay motionless along branches of
trees, and native bears, that moved away slowly, very slowly, if I
approached them, and, above all, there were great kangaroos, that I
was never able to approach, though I gazed at them with fascinated
and admiring eyes as they would descend the hill slopes in large
slow gracious bounds. It is one of the most beautiful modes of
progression in Nature, and no one has seen a kangaroo who has only
seen a captive kangaroo. The picture has always lingered in my
memory with an intimate and peculiar charm. Of late I have wondered
whether that charm may not He in a resemblance of my own mental
mode of progression to the slow deliberate curves of those
resilient bounds which seemed to me so gracious and so appealing.
Like the kangaroo, too, it may be that I Hie among a population of
jew lizards and native bears who find my movements more fearsome or
more impressive than they seem to myself. It was possibly Shelley
who first helped me to inspire the exhilarating air which
stimulated such a mode of intellectual movement. But Shelley was a
poet and soared over men's heads. I am not a poet but a dreamer who
is also a naturalist and a realist, and, like the kangaroo, however
vast the bounds I delight in, I can only achieve them by planting
my feet firmly on the solid earth. A critic of my earliest book,
<i>The New Spirit,</i> disparagingly said that its chief
characteristic was a calm and matter-of-fact way of making daring
revolutionary statements; I had never myself noted this, but the
remark seemed to me acute. Now, when I look back, I am pleased to
imagine a significance in the intimate appeal to me of those large
silent bounds, so serene and so daring, of the kangaroo.</p>

<p>On the days when I went to my other school&mdash;two days of one
week and three days of the next, for my time had to be divided
equally between them&mdash;after I had had my breakfast of porridge
and perhaps placed a saucepan containing meat and rice over the
smouldering wood-fire in the hope it might be done (it was
sometimes burnt) when I returned in the evening, and put in my
pockets some biscuits and a flask of tea for lunch, I started on my
walk across the range of hills which separated me from Junction
Creek. The aspects of Nature were my only source of interest,
beyond my own thoughts, for there was no human dwelling within
sight all the way, and I cannot recall ever having met a single
person during all my year's walks. Yet it was a varied and
delightful walk of which I never grew tired, and while I was often
absorbed in my thoughts I was also always alive to the visions of
beauty that were spread before my gaze. Several aspects of that
walk still Hash before my inner eye. There was the clump of
applegums with the delicious soft grey trunks so subtly in harmony
with my mood as I passed them. There were again the twin hills,
rounded with large gracious curves between them, which appealed to
me because they looked like the two breasts of a recumbent earth
goddess. In my hut I was almost beneath the shadow of another hill,
indeed, a real mountain, which imparted no such pleasing emotions;
gloomy and menacing, at night it seemed to be pressing and crushing
me down, and I may perhaps trace to it the repulsion I feel towards
mountains. It was on the slopes of this mountain, I believe, that a
cedar forest grew which I used to hear of from my older pupils and
their parents as a beautiful and wonderful place. It was suggested
that one of the boys should some clay take me there fora day's
excursion. But my shy diffidence or my procrastination stood in the
way; I never took the necessary initiative for that excursion, and
I have regretted it ever since. Yet I need not complain, for my
life was never so rich in new impressions, or in fresh stimulation
from old impressions for the first time really absorbed. As I sat
at my table on stormy evenings all my nerves were stirred by the
prolonged rhythmic curves of gathered-up winds that rolled and
tumbled and crashed through the trees among the hills like an ocean
let loose. And once, on my return in the evening from Junction
Creek, as I approached my hut and saw the blossoming roses that
climbed the verandah posts, with their crimson splashes on the
green background, a thrill of rapture went through me, and I saw
roses as I had never seen them before, as I shall never see them
again.</p>

<p>When in the morning I rose from my primitive couch and stood on
my verandah&mdash;"en pissant vers les cieux," as Rimbaud expresses
it&mdash;the sense of Sabbath peace, the contact of the pure sunny
air, would fill me with exhilaration. It was an admirable climate,
seldom, too hot or too cold. I could not have led a more healthy
life, and I had probably never before been so well. My habits were
simple, as I have said, my physical needs few; I was perfectly
content with the primitive food I prepared in so casual a manner,
for I was not then so accomplished a cook as in some respects I am
now, though I was taking the first most important step. There was
no milk or butter to be had at the season when I arrived. I drank
tea, and I recall that when in hot summer days, returning exhausted
from Junction Creek, I desired a cooler and more refreshing drink I
devised a mixture of vinegar, sugar, and water, which proved
satisfactory. At the same time my spiritual discontent and my
emotional cravings attained a degree of calm I had not before
known. Religious depression, such as Ihad sometimes experienced at
Carcoar, had already left me at Grafton. But here at Sparkes Creek
I was also comparatively free from definite emotional cravings. I
was not within sight of any woman who could arouse the impulse of
desire, and the memory of May Chapman was fading into a beautiful
dream. Certainly I would feel at times the craving for love and the
sense of my own unfitness to arouse it. I was, it seemed to me, so
unattractive a person; I would sometimes look into the window-pane
which served me as looking-glass and wonder what sweet gracious
woman, such as I desired, could ever love the image that met my
sight. (I was not vain, it will be seen, and I am not vain now
nearly fifty years afterwards, when I think of the supremely sweet
and gracious women who have loved me or offered me their love, and
wonder still.) One warm evening, I remember, though I think only
one, the craving came on me overwhelmingly, and I wandered around
my hut at random, my thoughts full of desire&mdash;of idealistic
rather than physical desire&mdash;and tore off eucalyptus leaves as
I passed, crushing them between my unconscious fingers till they
were soaked in strong aroma.</p>

<p>The craving for love was for me, at Sparkes Creek, so far as I
consciously knew, an ideal need. When I took my bucket to the
Warwick's well, to obtain drinking water purer than the creek
yielded, and hoisted up the cool bright liquid, the lines of
Swinburne I had lately learnt to know would come deliciously into
my mind:</p>

<p class="poem">"Nothing is better, I well think,<br>
Than love; the hidden well water<br>
Is not so delicate to drink."</p>

<p>I had brought over Swinburne's <i>Songs Before Sunrise</i> from
England and read it on the voyage with enjoyment. More recently I
had picked up the first series of <i>Poems and Ballads</i> at
Skinner's second-hand bookshop. (I well recall Skinner, hard and
pock-marked, a man of the bush, it seemed, rather than of books,
very unlike the only other second-hand bookseller, Lindsay of
Castlereagh Street, whose shop I haunted more profitably, a large
gentle old man who would sometimes go off angling.) At Sparkes
Creek I revelled for a time in <i>Poems and Ballads</i> more than
in any other book, for its magnificent exuberance, its imaginative
extravagance, seemed the adequate expression of my expanding self,
and as I paced up and down my little patch of enclosed ground I
would shout aloud the stanzas of "The Masque of Bersabe." The
splendour of Swinburne's cerebral excitation at that time sufficed,
as never later, to express my youthful desires.</p>

<p>Of physical desire I was as yet scarcely aware in any definite
way except during sleep. That physical efflorescence of sex had
begun with me early and often, as I have already told, at first
usually without dreams, and it worried me because of the traces
left behind. In time I understood what these manifestations meant
and accepted them, methodically noting their occurrences in my
pocket diary.*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* I have set forth and discussed the resulting
record as that of W. K. in the first volume of my <i>Studies,</i>
almost the only occasion on which I have used in my books
observations made on myself.]</p>

<p>I endeavoured so far as possible to avoid anything likely to
evoke them when asleep, and never, by any physical or mental
procedure, sought consciously to produce them when awake. They had
occurred indeed so frequently asleep that there was not much
temptation to produce them when awake. But at Sparkes Creek, where
my life, far from any kind of sexual stimulation, was simple and
healthy and regular, these nocturnal eruptions probably ceased to
give complete relief. At all events it was at Sparkes Creek that
for the first time in my life I experienced the orgasm when awake.
I was lying down on my simple bed, one warm pleasant day, reading
something which evidently had in it for me some touch of erotic
stimulation&mdash;I believe it was the <i>Dames Galantes</i> of
Brantôme&mdash;and suddenly I became aware that the agreeable
emotion aroused by the book, without any will or any action of my
own, was becoming physically translated and fulfilled. I realised
what had happened and felt no alarm; evidently there was nothing in
the occurrence that was not natural and beautiful, though it was of
course easy to imagine circumstances under which it would have been
yet more natural and beautiful. It was not until after this event
that I ever became definitely conscious of any stirring of physical
excitement at the thought or the proximity of an attractive
woman.</p>

<p>In this year of my solitary life, as never before or since,
there was an immense thirst deep down in my youthful soul, a thirst
of my whole being, though scarcely at all of my physical sex
nature, for the revelation, in body and spirit, of a divinely
glorious woman. My demand was large. There was no one anywhere who
corresponded to it, who even more than faintly suggested it, not
even among the women who had so far attracted me. And even if there
had been, I should have felt myself completely unworthy of a boon
so great that it would in my eyes at some moments have outweighed
the whole world in the balance. I disdained the women who were
within reach; the women I desired, hopelessly, it seemed, were
women I had never seen or known. How inconceivable a miracle that
life was indeed to bring me close to some of the noblest women in
the world! Now, when I grow old, sweet and gracious women come to
me unsought and are ready to pour out the treasures of their
loveliness and their devotion. Then, when their coming might have
meant so much, they never came. Still, it is my happiness that for
me sex was never cheap. Whatever powers of love and tenderness I
have acquired, whatever aptitude for delight in the bodies and
souls of women, was all generated in those days of solitude.</p>

<p>Yet, I am well aware, the desire of love, the physical
manifestations of sex, were both alike only rare interludes in my
active and sunny life at Sparkes Creek. They were sufficiently
acute, at all events the thirst for love, to represent in memory
vivid moments of my life, but those moments were few. My desire for
knowledge, if less acute, was more massive than my desire for love,
and it was omnipresent. Moreover, it was a desire within my power
to gratify. So I gratified it, freely and copiously, by means of
books, books of all kinds, in English and French and German and
Latin: poems, novels, theology, religion, subjects of almost every
class, science, strange as it must seem, occupying the smallest
place, if, indeed, any place at all, but in that phase I was eager
to grasp the whole rather than the parts; it was synthesis I was
drawn to rather than analysis. Though I bought every book I wanted,
my books were selected carefully and deliberately. My mind was
ranging freely, everywhere with a new power to grasp what it seized
and to revel in its acquisitions. I had acquired the power of
seeing the world freshly, and seeing it directly, with my own eyes,
not through the dulling or disturbing medium of tradition and
convention.</p>

<p>It was at Sparkes Creek that I discovered the Bible. Since the
loss of my early piety and my boyish devotion to the New Testament,
I had ceased to feel interest in the Bible and no longer looked at
it. But now by some unknown spontaneous impulse I turned to it
again, and, as art, I saw it altogether afresh, indifferent to its
departed religious significance but full of delight in its
splendour. Sometimes at night, with rapturous pleasure, I would
read it aloud by the light of my solitary candle, and once, as I
afterwards learnt, some of the Ashford family, when riding home,
heard me and concluded that teacher was frightened at the solitude,
a supposition that had in it no touch of truth, for my solitude was
too absolute, too far from any possibility of being broken, to be
anything else but perpetual peace and joy.</p>

<p>My activities were, however, by no means merely receptive, for
the first time they were becoming genuinely active. I was at the
end of the period of adolescence; my physical and mental
development&mdash;not of course my intellectual
development&mdash;was completed. I was at the threshold of the
creative period of manhood. The sexual emorescence, of which I now
first became conscious, was the physical side of the creative
artistic force of which now also I became conscious. At Sparkes
Creek I first began to write that prose which has been the medium
of all my work in life.</p>

<p>Before I was twelve I had spontaneously begun to write a sort of
prose; before I was fifteen I had begun to write a sort of verse;
but the one and the other were completely lacking in any note of
personal style. At seventeen I was beginning to write sonnets and
these were distinctly more personal in substance, although not
definitely original in form. At eighteen I was deliberately
studying the technique of verse in Tennyson's <i>In Memoriam</i>
and that most technically instructive of lyrics, "Break, break,
break." But all these years I gave no thought to prose and indeed
wrote none, save, without much conscious care, in some
translations. Now at nineteen I opened a manuscript book and filled
it gradually with a dozen different notes of observation,
criticism, or comment, written carefully and deliberately, in a way
that was alike in substance and in form personal, and traceably the
early expression of my native self, my first <i>Impressions and
Comments.</i></p>

<p>Writing for me was of the nature of a natural instinct. I never
at any time set myself deliberately to learn how to write prose,
after the manner of a writer who in my time still enjoyed
considerable reputation, Robert Louis Stevenson, so making the
writer's art an accomplishment such as those taught in the ancient
Academies for Young Ladies. When I have studied the art of writing
it has been as a critic rather than as a practitioner. Still less
have I ever deliberately sought to imitate the methods of some
admired master; that would have been an impulse outside my
temperament, for I have never wanted to be anyone but myself. I
abhor the doctrine of those who teach that a writer's style must be
moulded on the style of other writers. A man's style must be
moulded on himself; it is himself. I wrote simply because I had
something to say, and my ultimate deep, even if unconscious,
impulse was to attain self-expression. But it is inevitable that we
should be unconsciously imitative before we become complete masters
of our natural methods of expression; and I am sure that, however
little I may have been aware of it, I could not have escaped that
necessity. When in recent years I have looked back, from as it were
outside, on my own origins, it has seemed to me that the master by
whose style I was most influenced unconsciously when at Sparkes
Creek I first began, in the real sense, to write, was Newman. At
Burwood, two years earlier, I had bought a lately published volume
of selections from Newman, why I cannot tell, except that I was
impartially interested in every aspect of humanity that was in its
own manner good, for Newman was as alien to me then as he has ever
been. I read the book with the deliberate care with which in those
days I always read books, and for the most part I found little of
interest in it; before long I parted with the volume. But I
remember that there were several passages in it that seemed to me
of an enchanting melody. That seductive and insinuating music acted
upon me, as I now believe, more potently than I knew. It is not
obtrusive, it is only now and then that it comes into his writing,
and it comes without forethought, seemingly without consciousness;
it is the style that is the man, the man in the most intimate
fibres of his racial ancestry, for one detects through it the
instinctive artist in style which we associate with France. To me
that artist has always been fascinating. So it may have come about
that, when at Sparkes Creek I began to write out of myself, my way
of writing at first unconsciously tended to fall into the strains
of a music which the fibres of my nerves had learnt from
Newman&mdash;"one of the greatest masters of quietly exquisite
prose," he has been called by a sound judge, "that the world has
seen." In all my earliest writings, then for some years later, my
instinctive ideal of style was delicate, allusive, musical, with
more care for sweetness of melody than for choice of jewelled or
emphatic words. <i>The New Spirit,</i> my first book, represented
the end of this stage. Afterwards I rebelled to some extent against
this way of writing; it seemed to me a little too refined, and I
knew that some people&mdash;unliterary people, it is
true&mdash;were impatient with it and found it obscure. A change
took place in my method. Music was no longer its ruling motive, and
I wrote in a more masculine way. Whether the change was really due
to discontent with my earlier way or whether that discontent was
merely the outward sign of a deep and instinctive movement of
personal development, I cannot now say. In the spiritual world it
is not always easy to distinguish the cart from the horse. In any
case my style became more vigorous and more pungent. I was more
deliberately careful to select the just and effective word. I
sought to avoid all literary allusiveness except when it was
urgently necessary for my purpose and could be made clear even to
an unliterary reader of intelligence. I supplemented my already
acquired tendency&mdash;doubtless the outcome of my medical
training&mdash;to use technical and precise words by a
complementary tendency to use also simple and figurative words from
vulgar speech, and my imagery became more homely.
<i>Affirmations</i> represents this second stage in the development
of my manner of writing. In this stage, however, the robust vigour
which had developed by reaction from the sensitive delicacy of the
earlier stage tended sometimes to take on an air of rather
self-conscious <i>bravado</i> which, I found, was a little
repellant to one or two who loved me and my work, especially my
wife, and was not sympathetic to my own most genuine tastes. It was
then that I entered on the third, the most characteristic and I
suppose the final stage in the growth of my literary style. I left
behind a gusto of rankness which might possibly be detected in the
second phase and conciliated what was left with the more delicate
and musical first manner. It was then that I wrote, and continue to
write, <i>Impressions and Comments,</i> certainly at once the most
intimately personal, the most spontaneous and the most deliberately
moulded of my writings.</p>

<p>I wrote the notes in that first little black manuscript book
with care and with enjoyment, all of them, I think, at Sgarkes
Creek, but without any special absorption or any realisation that
they opened a new era in my mental life. It seemed only one of many
new energies of which my life was so full, so buoyant, and so glad,
exhilarated by sunlight and fresh air. In this wide expansion of
the soul there was no time to concentrate intensively or to stand
back to study the significance of my own mental movements. I was,
however, at the threshold of the most vital movement of all.</p>

<p>It was on board the <i>Surrey,</i> on my way to the new world of
the south, that, leaving Europe and my childhood's home behind me,
I left also behind me my childhood's faith and the old traditional
creed of Europe. At Carcoar I meditated on the prosaic vision of
the universe, so alien to my own temperament, complacently revealed
by Friedrich Strauss in his <i>Old Faith and New,</i> as a factory
filled with the mechanical whirr of lifeless wheels. Moods of deep
melancholy passed over me and were blended with thoughts of sexual
origin when I read in the <i>Elements of Social Science</i> of the
dangerously devitalising effects of nocturnal seminal emissions and
feared I might be impotent, a possibility which in youth is not
accepted philosophically. So a personal gloom deepened for me the
gloom of an empty and mechanical world. At Grafton these moods had
fallen into the background, if they had not been dispelled, and I
lived a more cheerfully sociable life among companionable people of
both sexes and my own age; I was seldom alone; I was, moreover,
waking up to new literary interests. At Sparkes Creek, by another
turn of the kaleidoscope, a new mental activity greater than that
of Grafton was coupled with a solitude deeper than that of Carcoar,
in a physical atmosphere which was for me that of joy. Now
evidently, though I could not have known it beforehand, was the
moment for the discord in my spiritual life to be at last resolved
in harmony.</p>

<p>In those eager days of developing mind my eyes were open for
every significant manifestation of the intellectual life yet
unknown to me. In this way it would seem that I somewhere (probably
in the <i>Literary Wlorld</i>) read a review of Hinton's books, or
of the then lately published biography by Ellice Hopkins, and had a
desire to know more of him, why, I do not know. The book I sent to
England for was&mdash;fortunately, since it was the book I needed,
and also, I still think, his best&mdash;<i>Life in Nature.</i> I
read it calmly, with no undue expectation of personal profit; then,
if I remember rightly, I read it a second time, this time more
significantly. And then, as I read, I became conscious of what I
can only call, in the precise and full sense of the word, a
revelation. The clash in my inner life was due to what had come to
seem to me the hopeless discrepancy of two different conceptions of
the universe. On the one hand was the divine vision of life and
beauty which for me had been associated with a religion I had lost.
On the other was the scientific conception of an evolutionary world
which might be marvellous in its mechanism but was completely alien
to the individual soul and quite inapt to attract love. The great
revelation brought to me by Hinton&mdash;a man of science who was
also, though he made no definite claim to the name, a
mystic&mdash;was that these two conflicting attitudes are really
but harmonious though different aspects of the same unity. And he
presented the matter so simply, so clearly, so persuasively, with
so complete an absence of passion or propagandism and yet with a
profound and passionate reverence for Nature to which my own
temperament instinctively responded, that I was convinced
immediately and completely without effort or struggle. I had
reached the point at which it sufficed for the situation to be
presented to me in a beautiful and adequate form, and my response
could only be at once that it must be so. In an instant, as it
seemed, the universe was changed for me. I trod on air; I moved in
light.</p>

<p>An immense inner transformation had been effected, as it seemed,
in a moment. Before long I was able to recognise that this
transformation was what religious people had been accustomed to
call "conversion." But this conversion was totally unlike any that
I had then ever heard of. It was a change in what is traditionally
called the "soul," and a. change in the soul's attitude towards the
universe, as we generally term the not-soul. But it was not a
change that could be formulated in precise rational terms, or that
involved an act of faith in any creed; it was a profound change
that yet had no intellectual content. Religion, as I had come to
experience it, for the first time in a shape really personal to
myself, was in that respect like love, to which, indeed, on another
plane, it closely corresponded; and just as love confers no power
to make a single precise statement about the loved person, so
religion confers no power to make a single precise statement about
the universe, and asks nothing either from metaphysics or theology.
I was as far as ever from any faith in Christianity, in God, in
immortality; all my definitely formulated convictions on separate
points remained unchanged. Yet I was myself changed, and the whole
universe&mdash;that is to say, my attitude towards it&mdash;was
changed. What had happened could only be expressed by metaphors and
similes. It was as though there had been developing within me, with
a painful sense of strain and division, two diverse streams of
tendency which had now suddenly come together, each entering into
the other to form a fresh stream of a new potency wherein the
qualities of the two original streams were at length harmoniously
blended. Or, to put it in a more psychological way, a gradual
process of development, which had been slowly working out beneath
the surface of consciousness, had now, at the chance, but at this
moment fitting, touch of Hinton's book, been suddenly brought to
the surface and consciously realised in all its bearings. For it
was only a chance touch which, because it came at the right moment,
had thus in an instant thrown all my psychic elements into another
state of crystallisation. I never imagined, even at the moment when
I was thus seemingly transformed, that the wand which effected the
transformation possessed any abstract sacred efficiency. I became
interested in Hinton, it is true, for a time perhaps, owing to
various circumstances, unduly interested, but I soon completely
gained in relation to him that aloof and critical independence
which mark even my sympathies. On the book itself, which had so
shaken me, I bestowed no further notice and never even troubled to
retain my copy of it. I have not read it again to this day. Its
work was done, once and for ever, in a moment. I have been
accustomed to call this experience, by analogy with that common in
religious sects, "conversion." It is clear, however, that it
differs from the kind of experience most usually connoted by the
term. "Conversion," as it generally occurs, is a social phenomenon,
the outcome of emotional excitement, generated from outside, by
which a ferment disguised as a doctrine or a creed is violently
injected into the youthful organism, and in most cases, though not
always, runs its course and exhausts itself&mdash;an attack of a
sort of spiritual measles. But with me the experience had been the
outcome of a slow inward growth, the result of an inevitable inner
necessity, and the element of external stimulus was of the
slightest kind. Of social contagion, moreover, there was nothing.
It seemed indeed of the essence of the whole process that there
should be solitude and silence, the vast and sunny expanse of
Nature, so that the flower of the soul might germinate and bud
under the most favourable conditions. And half a century later the
flower still blooms.</p>

<p>In those days the phenomenon of religious conversion had not
been studied. I speedily realised, however, the significance of my
own experience. I was enabled to grasp by actual demonstration the
great fact that religion is a natural manifestation, a process that
takes place spontaneously in the individual soul. In face of that
central fact all the religious creeds of the world, however
systematised they may be and however infallible they may claim to
be, fall back into insignificance. They are merely the empty husks
of that vital process which I had experienced within myself. The
whole religious life of the world, the most extravagant utterances
of the most ecstatic mystics, became simple and natural to me in
the light of what I now knew in the only way in which anything
could certainly be known.</p>

<p>During the next year or two I drew up a <i>questionnaire</i> on
religious experience; I never used or published it, but it was the
unknown prototype of a method of exploring religious phenomena much
used in later years. I prepared it in connection with a book on
religion which I planned and indeed began to write about the year
1879. Then I laid it aside, not because I had lost interest in the
matter, but because I saw that the question of sex came before the
question of religion in degree of urgency. It will be better, I
said to myself, to deal with the sex problem first and with the
religious problem later. So I devoted some thirty, if not indeed
fifty, years to the sex problem, which I had already some years
earlier set as a main task for my activities in life. Now the
religious problem seems less urgent since so many workers have
taken it up along lines similar to those I had planned to follow,
though they have not, I think, usually placed the question so
definitely as I can on personal experience.*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* In the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i> for June,
1913, I published an article on "Science and Mysticism" in which I
briefly set forth my standpoint and my experience; this was revised
and enlarged before taking its assigned place in the <i>Dance of
Life</i> published in 1923. The narrative above was written
independently at an intermediate date; I have not compared the two
versions.]</p>

<p>The religious process that took place in me at the age of
nineteen was effected in a moment. But it was effected for ever.
One is suspicious, and rightly enough, of such sudden
"conversions." Yet what happened to me was of a nature that could
not possibly be undone. More than forty years have passed since
then. Yet there has never been a moment when the foundation and
background of my life have not been marked by the impress they
received at Sparkes Creek. Many earthly affairs have caused me
vexation, pain, even anguish. Yet beyond that distress of the earth
there has always been an inner sphere of my soul, filled with joy
and the serenity of Heaven. I have always been conscious that
beyond the clamour of the world, below the agitated surface of my
life, there brooded a peace that nothing could ever take away. I
have worked for the world; I have been very indifferent to any good
or evil the world could do me. I smile alike at its blessings and
its curses.</p>

<p>The problem of my spiritual life was now for ever solved. The
problem of my practical life remained. Ever since I had left
school&mdash;and even before&mdash;I had never had the slightest
idea how to gain my living. I never felt the faintest real vocation
for any course of life. If asked what I would like to be I could
only have answered as Diderot answered in youth: "Mais Tien, mais
rien du tout." With me, as with Diderot, a creature of
superabundant energy, this was far from meaning laziness or
indifference. It was merely the mark of one whose temperament is
too obstinately aboriginal to be fitted into one of the existing
frameworks of life. I was most anxious and worried over the matter.
My mother had once suggested that, being fond of books, I might be
a bookseller, but that idea had not the slightest attraction for
me; indeed, none of the families I proceeded from, except the
Olivers, had ever been drawn to business, or made any success in
business, and in books as books, moreover, I never took an
interest. It might possibly be said that it was by an unconscious
atavistic impulse&mdash;I knew nothing then of my remote
ecclesiastical ancestry&mdash;that the first profession I ever
thought of entering, when about the age of fifteen, was the Church.
The idea was, in fact, most likely the natural outcome of my own
religious attitude and environment, and the fact that my friend
Mackay was at that time preparing to become a clergyman. But it was
a career for which I was in every respect singularly unsuited, and
the idea, which never took deep root, was soon effaced when shortly
afterwards I lost my early faith in Christianity. The occupation of
teaching which I had fallen into on reaching Australia was as
unsuitable for me as the Church, and from the first I merely
adopted it as a temporary resource. I never had any wish to devote
myself to teaching and I have always been rather sceptical about
what is falsely called "education." At some time in Australia I
believe that the idea of a legal career floated passingly across my
mind, but for me it was as absurd as any of the others. My future
career in life remained a puzzling and painful problem to which I
could never see any solutidn. The question was still in that
position when, a few weeks after the experience I have just told, I
began to read the <i>Life and Letters of James Hinton,</i> by
Ellice Hopkins, and by a strange chance Hinton was fated to have as
decisive an influence on my practical work in life as already on my
spiritual welfare. I was still in the first chapter of the book,
reading as I lay&mdash;it was sometimes my position when tired
after the day's work&mdash;full length on the hard bench in my
schoolroom, on which I usually sat in the absence of a chair; a
position more or less horizontal is always with me the most
favourable to mental activity. As I read, in a completely calm and
disinterested manner, I came to that point in the narrative where
it is stated that on the advice of the family doctor it was decided
that young James should enter the medical profession, as giving the
necessary scope to his mental activity, and was accordingly placed
at St. Bartholomew's Hospital Medical School, having just reached
his twentieth year, the age I had myself then almost reached.
Suddenly I leapt to my feet as though I had been shot. "I will
become a doctor!" a voice within me seemed to say. Therewith, in
that instant, the question that had worried me for so many years
was once and for all decided. On the conscious plane, difficult
problems, especially if of a practical nature, are only settled in
my mind with the greatest hesitation and much swaying back and
forth between the arguments on this side and on that, and even to
the end I remain uncertain, although, when once the decision is
made, I doubt no more and never turn back. But now, in settling the
greatest practical question of life, I settled it in an instant,
without even any deliberation at all&mdash;for the idea of becoming
a doctor had never before so much as entered my head&mdash;and
settled it so finally that I never once called my decision in
question.</p>

<p>How it was that, against all the apparent tendencies of my
mental constitution, I reached so instantaneous a decision of a
problem I had so long hesitated over I never tried to understand.
When I now look back on it I seem to see that the process was
analogous to that which brought about a little earlier the
spiritual revolution. It was, that is to say, due to the sudden
combination of separate tendencies, slowly elaborated in the
subconscious region, and emerging into consciousness, when thus
brought into union, with a generation of dynamic energy. I had
never thought of being a doctor, yet for years I had been
interested in the human body and its processes and had already
begun to concern myself with anthropometry. Deeper than this was my
interest, alike personal and impersonal, in the questions of sex
which, though mostly in abeyance at Sparkes Creek, was slowly and
steadily becoming formulated into a main life-study. There was
again my more general humanitarian interest in health questions;
the only charitable or philanthropic contribution to any funds that
I can recall sending home from Australia was in connection with
some health scheme, I forget precisely what. Finally, there was the
underlying persistent recognition of the need for a practical
career in life. It was these various impulses which were at this
moment suddenly welded into one powerful whole.</p>

<p>It was as well that the process was effected without
deliberation. For, if I had carefully considered it, there were
many reasons why I should not become a doctor, even apart from the
fact that I had no idea how the expenses of the long preliminary
training were to be covered. Professionalism of any kind&mdash;the
professional attitude of mind and the professional manner&mdash;is
quite alien to me, however valuable for inspiring confidence in the
general public. Then my tendency to nervous apprehension and
intellectual doubt, however admirable as an aid in difficult
diagnosis or any other complicated problem, is not favourable to
swift decision or ruthless action. Moreover, practice must be the
medical practitioner's main business, and since I have too much
faith in Nature to be enthusiastic about practising on her, I
hardly seemed to possess the qualities required to pursue a
brilliant medical career. Some of the qualities left over&mdash;a
patient kindness, human sympathy, a certain amount of
insight&mdash;might be helpful, and have indeed proved helpful in
my limited professional experience, but they do not cover a large
part of the field of medical practice to-day.</p>

<p>Yet the sudden inspiration that struck me as by lightning when I
lay on the bench that evening in my little schoolroom was
absolutely justified. It was as completely right as my spiritual
conversion of a few weeks earlier. I have never for an instant
doubted either. The two convictions in my life that were on the
surface the most sudden and revolutionary were also the most firmly
and irremovably based.</p>

<p>I quickly realised that the career of an ordinary medical
practitioner had no attractions for nie. As soon as I began to
reflect on the meaning of that sudden conviction I saw that the
main reason why I wanted to be a doctor was not because I wanted a
doctor's life but because I needed a doctor's education. A doctor's
career was not my career, but a doctor's training was the necessary
portal to my career. Therein I was entirely right. I might have
been tempted to say, like some clever and brilliant people I can
think of, that of the things I wanted to know medicine had little
to teach and that I could best work in complete independence of
traditional investigation. I was fortunately saved from that fate
by a primitive trait of my mental constitution. My most
revolutionary impulses are combined with an equally strong impulse
to reverence tradition and seek out its bases. Just as I could not
undertake to study the revolutionary Rabelais without investigating
the whole history of the fifteenth century, so I could not reach my
own new conception of sex without studying the established
conventions of medical science. It has been fortunate for me that
it is so. If I had not studied medicine from the beginning, if I
had not been a duly accredited practitioner in medicine, surgery,
and midwifery, I could never have gained a confident grasp of the
problems of sex, I could never have set forth my own personal
investigations and results in the volumes of my <i>Studies,</i> and
I could never have found a decent firm to publish them. I should
have spent my days in an almost helpless struggle, and my
life-blood would have been drunk by the thirsty sands of time. I
should have dropped and left no mark. By adopting the medical
profession I acquired the only foundation on which I could build my
own work.</p>

<p>In thus regarding medical education merely as tracing, merely as
the portal to some other career still undefined, or merely, as it
after seemed to me, as part of a necessary apprenticeship to
life&mdash;"life" being here the development in the world of my own
personality&mdash;I was thus not really solving the difficult
problem of bread-earning but only postponing it. Over this,
however, it scarcely seemed that I worried. One step at a time, I
seemed now to think, was enough. Therein, as it proved, I was wise.
It is true that not until some twenty years later was my own chosen
life-work to bring in any sort of pecuniary return. But before I
had completed even my course as a medical student I was earning
money by my literary work, and I had scarcely obtained my medical
diploma before I had abandoned for ever the ordinary medical
practitioner's career. I had at last reached the long-sought
lifecourse it was so hard to find, a path that was absolutely my
own and entirely new. I have never departed from it.</p>

<p>Sparkes Creek had now done its seminal work. The most eventful
year of my life was almost spent. What remained of it is a blank in
memory. From little notes I made, it appears that, in October, Mr.
Shaw, who was officially connected with the school, paid a brief
perfunctory visit, and his name in the Visitors' Book was the first
entered for eight years. It was in October I discovered the brown
snake, four or five feet long, basking on my verandah, and that
Ashford, when I met him once, told me the place suited me I looked
so well, and that it would take a big lump of a horse to carry me.
But I now only recall that a few weeks later, it may have been
November, the Inspector, a quiet, black-bearded, not unfriendly
man, came in his buggy to pay the brief offcial visit. He was
almost the only person who came to me from the outside world during
the whole twelve months, and that is why I recall him, for we
exchanged but few words and he had no fault to find. By this time,
I think, the question of my return to England must have been under
consideration. Before long my father, whose own ship had chanced
never to be chartered to Australia during the years I had been
there, wrote out to me that he was making arrangements with Captain
Wagstaff of the <i>La Hogue,</i> an old and well-known ship in the
Australian trade, to bring me back to London as a second-class
passenger. Whether the question of my return was first raised by me
or by my mother I no longer recall. But my mother was now becoming
anxious to see me, and I&mdash;who had so far been content to stay
in Australia&mdash;now had a new motive for returning to England.
My training for life was opening out before me, though how I
supposed I was to find the means for my medical course it is
impossible for me now to guess. Perhaps my new faith in the world
extended unconsciously even to this practical point. If so, it was
to be justified in the most incalculable way. It is, maybe, a
simple and instinctive faith in miracles that effects miracles; and
my life was full of them.</p>

<p>So the last weeks of that wonderful year slipped out quietly and
have left no traces in memory. The most eventful year of my life
was over, the year in which I had discovered the universe, and
discovered myself and my art and my science&mdash;and I left,
easily, cheerfully, without a pang so far as I can recall, the
sacred spot beneath the Southern Cross I may never see again where
all these things were revealed to me. I remember spending an hour
or so in Scone before the train left, paying my bills, taking my
money out of the Bank, saying good-bye to Roberts the schoolmaster,
and how he commended me for my pluck in spending twelve months in
such an awful hole as Sparkes Creek&mdash;how little he
knew!&mdash;and told me how surprised Shaw the clergyman had been
at my courage and tenacity, and how Johnson the Inspector had told
him I ought never to have been sent to such a spot.</p>

<p>How little they all knew of the gateways to Heaven!</p>

<p>In Australia I gained health of body; I attained peace of soul;
my life-task was revealed to me; I was able to decide on a
professional vocation; I became an artist in literature. So far as
my own individual effort is concerned, apart from other personal
influences, these five points covered the whole activity of my life
in the world. Some of them I should doubtless have reached without
the aid of the Australian environment, scarcely all, and most of
them I could never have achieved so completely if chance had not
cast me into the solitude of the Liverpool Range.</p>

<h2><a name="ch5" id="ch5"></a>Chapter 5</h2>

<p>THE passage home was uneventful. There were on board a number of
varied figures, pleasant and unpleasant, which remain vividly
etched on the plates of memory. But none of them touched my life
and I need not attempt to revive them. One attracted me, an
Irishwoman, some thirty-five years of age, the wife of a quiet
back-country publican. She had a beautiful well-cut Irish face and
a splendidly held erect figure (I surprised her by saying I knew
she had once been accustomed to carry burdens on her head), a pure
heart and a gay free tongue which, she confessed, she sometimes
wished she had bitten off before it spoke. The man I associated
most with was also, it chanced, Irish, a priest, on a visit home to
Tipperary, after many years' activity in Australia, the Bishop's
official licence in his pocket. We walked up and down the deck
discussing theology, and he lent me Balmes as well as a volume of
Montalambert's fascinating <i>Monks of the West.</i> He was the
only passenger I arranged to meet after reaching London, and I
showed him a few of the London sights, but never saw or heard of
him later, or of any other of my shipmates of the <i>La
Hogue.</i></p>

<p>After four years' absence I was once more at home, which was
now, and for several years remained, 24. Thornsett Road, Anerley, a
southern suburb of London, within a walk of the Crystal Palace.
There followed a seemingly uneventful interval in my life. I was on
the right road, but I was standing still, uncertain of the next
step, and yet strangely free from anxiety; for I felt young, I saw
no need for haste, the path in front seemed endless. It was not
indeed until I was nearly forty that I suddenly realised that I was
no longer young and that the road ahead could scarcely be as long
as the road I had left behind.</p>

<p>My sisters had been children when I went to Australia (the
eldest being nearly four years my junior) and the two elder were
now grown girls, developed and tall. It was like becoming
acquainted with people I had not before known, and the sense of
intimacy which thus arose with young women who were strangers and
yet my own sisters was delightful to me who all my life had so far
known no real intimacy with women. The most vivacious and
intelligent of them, Louie, was specially sympathetic to me, and
with her I formed an intimate friendship which at first was touched
by sexual emotion. This could not have arisen if the long absence
during which she grew into womanhood had not destroyed that
familiarity which inhibits the development of sexual interest. This
little experience was valuable to me, apart from the permanent
deeper tenderness which it brought into our relationship.* It
enabled me to understand from personal knowledge how it is that, as
a rule, sexual emotion fails to spring up between close relatives
or people living together from before puberty, and under what
circumstances&mdash;by no means of such rare occurrence as is
usually believed&mdash;it may spring up. I was thereby enabled in
later years to give clear precision to my conception of the
psychological foundation of exogamy.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* I re-write this passage just six months
after my sister Louie died in December 1928. Nothing ever destroyed
the harmony of our relationship or spoilt our enjoyment in
innumerable subjects of common interest, although there were
various circumstances which might easily have made our relations
difficult. She was actively occupied as a court dressmaker (after
an apprenticeship with Mrs. Nettleship, a daughter of Hinton's)
until the Great War broke up her business, but retained a vivid and
highly intelligent interest in many subjects and possessed a large
circle of devoted friends. During the last years of her life she
was crippled by rheumatoid arthritis and suffered much pain, but
she preserved her unruffled cheerfulness and gaiety of spirit until
the end, of the approach of which she was fully conscious. One of
her friends remarked of her that the Ellises knew how to die, and
another wrote that she might truly be called a saint.]</p>

<p>My mind was made up that I was to go through a doctor's
training, but I knew nothing as to how the money to do this was to
be acquired. My mother was willing to help me as far as she could
by devoting to my medical education the sum of £100, which was half
of the little sum she had received by the will of her old friend
Miss Johnston, who had died while I was away, but that was of
course insufficient. In the meanwhile the natural course was to go
on teaching, and so I went as assistant master to a school at
Smethwick, in the suburbs of Birmingham. The routine of my life
here was completely without interest and I can recall very few of
its circumstances. Only one or two points stand out. The
headmaster, who was a self-important and scarcely attractive
personality, had a commonplace little wife of some thirty years of
age. I never paid her the slightest attention, beyond ordinary
politeness, but one day, when her husband was out and I was alone
in the schoolroom, she came to me in a tearful mood and vaguely
confided her married troubles. I was far too shy and awkward and
inexperienced to offer her even the most innocent consolation, and
even to-day I am uncertain what kind of consolation she desired or
expected. She never came again. That was the first time in my life
such an incident had happened to me; it was far from being the
last. I also remember that on Sundays it was my duty to take the
boys to church, and that we sometimes went to St. Augustine's at
Edgbaston; the service here was at that time most beautifully
conducted by a clergyman called Hodges, and there was a noted and
accomplished organist, Gaule by name. In the services at this
church there was something deliciously serene and even
aesthetically satisfying, although they had not the slightest
religious significance for me. I have never experienced any of the
Rationalist's austere horror of religious observances, and at St.
Augustine's I was still able to feel something of the same
enjoyment I used to receive five or six years earlier in Merton
Church. It was the last time, however, that I ever had occasion to
experience that pleasure. After leaving Smethwick it was seldom
that I entered an English church during service, though I can never
resist the temptation to linger in and around an old church at
other times and find fresh delight in each.</p>

<p>I had not, meanwhile, lost interest in Hinton. I had grown
curious to learn more of his unpublished MSS. mysteriously referred
to in the <i>Life and Letters.</i> It was, I think, before I went
to Birmingham&mdash;and perhaps even before I left
Australia&mdash;that I wrote to his biographer, Miss Ellice
Hopkins, to inquire as to the prospects of their publication. She
forwarded my letter to Mrs. Hinton, who wrote to me most kindly and
invited me to come and see her and her sister Miss Caroline Haddon,
an intelligent and enthusiastic disciple of Hinton and his
doctrines. I was soon on friendly terms with the whole family, who
took me into their inner circle and interested themselves in all my
affairs. In later years Mrs. Hinton told my future wife that in
some respects I much resembled Hinton, adding, however, some remark
to the effect that such resemblance was no recommendation as a
husband. (Several people at that time made remarks to my future
wife not flattering to me as a prospective husband, and it was
characteristic of her steadfast and independent mind that they made
no impression on her, though she duly reported them to me.) But the
chief bond was, of course, my youthfully keen interest in Hinton's
work, especially his unpublished work. Mrs. Hinton presented to me
the four large volumes of his earlier privately printed but
unpublished MSS. and lent me endless bundles of later unprinted
MSS. which I zealously read, making many extracts. I wrote an
article on Hinton for a liberal religious magazine, the <i>Modern
Review</i> (1881), consisting mainly of quotations from the printed
volumes of MSS.; I assisted Miss Haddon in editing a volume of
selections from the same source; and I stimulated Mrs. Hinton to
publish a volume of extracts from the later MSS. under the title of
<i>The Lawbreaker.</i> This, though Mrs. Hinton was nominally
responsible for it, was really edited by me; I wrote a little
Introduction and it was published in 1884. I also wrote a careful
and sympathetically appreciative, though not uncritical, article on
"Hinton's Later Thought" which Croom Robertson accepted for
<i>Mind,</i> where it appeared in the same year. I have never
reprinted it because, although I still accept it in the main, I
feel that it concentrates on to Hinton the thinker a degree of
attention which he has long since ceased to occupy in my mind. Some
who have known me well hold that his influence on me has been
great. To me, when I look back, this seems doubtful. Except at some
definite points where I gladly recognise such influence, his mental
disposition was so alien to mine, his clinging adhesion to some of
the ideas of orthodox religion placed such an intellectual abyss in
the way, and his vague confused thought so persistently aroused the
critical instincts of my "Latin mind"&mdash;as it has sometimes, I
do not say justly, been called&mdash;that the possibility of real
general influence seems excluded. Nevertheless, so impervious have
I been on the whole to influences, whether directly personal or
through books, that Hinton remains at all events the most
disturbing figure in the history of my spiritual course.</p>

<p>The Hinton family, I have said, took a friendly interest in my
private affairs. They certainly knew that I wished to be a doctor
and they probably knew that my financial condition would not enable
me to obtain a medical education. I had spent a few days with
Howard Hinton and his wife at Uppingham, where he was science
master at the school. It was through Howard that an offer came to
me from Miss Caroline Haddon to lend £200, to enable me to pursue
my medical studies. I appreciated the generous kindness of this
offer, and it opened for me the way I wanted to go, which, without
that offer, might have been for ever closed and my whole
life-course altered. It happened thus, as it had happened before,
as it has happened since, throughout my whole life, that, at the
right moment, the gift of Heaven, without any effort of mine, fell
miraculously upon me. I suppose it is so also for others. And that
is why we speak of "Heaven" and "miracles." That is why we try to
account for the unaccountable by picturing a fairy-tale God in the
skies, who watches over his children and gives them all that they
need.</p>

<p>I hesitated to accept such an obligation until I had thought
over it, and I asked the advice of my friend Mackay. To his opinion
I attached value because I knew that he held money obligations in
horror. But he heartily advised me to accept, and as that was also
my own feeling the matter was therewith concluded. My life was
insured for the amount of the loan should I die before repayment.
Some time later, however, Miss Haddon told me that she had no wish
for me to return the money. That, as it turned out, was fortunate;
it was not till long after her death that I could have repaid the
loan. The obligation always a little weighed on me, though by no
fault of Caroline Haddon, who entered into a course of affectionate
correspondence with me. She was a charming letter-writer and always
regarded me as her "dear camerado," in Whitman's phrase. On my
part, I was ready and eager to fulfil what I felt to be my part in
aiding her in all that concerned the maintenance of Hinton's
reputation and the publication of his MSS. I always felt, however,
that my return was inadequate. It has not been until forty years
have passed, and then not directly by me, but, through another gift
of Heaven, the spontaneous resolve of my wife, that I was able to
feel that Caroline Haddon's long-cherished wish for the complete
presentation of Hinton's esoteric doctrines is at length fulfilled,
that the debt has been repaid and that I am at rest.* Moreover,
although no part of the loan was ever returned in money to my
generous friend, it has been passed on in ways that I am sure would
please her. We can seldom return to others the most needed gifts we
receive, but we can pass them on to others, and as the years have
gone by I know that, even in the form of money, I have given to
others who needed it at least as much as I have myself received
from others.</p>

<p class="footnote">[<i>*James Hinton: A Sketch,</i> by Mrs.
Havelock Ellis, with a Preface by Havelock Ellis, was completed by
my wife just before her death, though owing to delay caused by the
Great War it was not published until 1918. The whole of what Hinton
regarded as his special message to the world was here frankly and
fairly, though not uncritically, set forth.]</p>

<p>To the £200 from Miss Haddon my mother added the promised £100
out of the legacy. As I was to live at home during my medical
course, without any question of payment for board and lodging, my
medical training was provided for, and I had been treated very
generously considering my parents' position in life, more
generously perhaps than I then realised.</p>

<p>The next question was the choice of a medical school. On this
point we were completely ignorant. My mother took me to Dr. Alfred
Carpenter, who had been present at my birth and was now a prominent
public man, later, indeed, described as the foremost private
practitioner in England. He belonged to St. Thomas's, where, until
shortly before, he had lectured on his own special subject, Public
Health. (It was the last time I saw him, but forty years later I
found his son staying at a favourite hotel of mine in Saffron
Walden, "The Rose and Crown.") Naturally, he strongly recommended
his own Hospital School, but I think he was right. At all events I
have never regretted the choice of St. Thomas's. Even apart from
its sound teaching equipment, it was incomparably the best London
school for spacious and beautiful situation, on the banks of the
Thames, opposite the Houses of Parliament and close to Lambeth
Palace. During the prolonged seven years course of my medical
training I saw that beautiful spot under every aspect of day and
night, and the river and the Parliament buildings, alike
delightfully varied from different points of view and under
changing lights. Incidentally, I caught glimpses of many notable
personages. I passed Gladstone walking along Whitehall, vigorous,
alert, well-set, even in old age; Parnell near the same spot, a
tall slender man with curiously shifty, self-conscious, timid eyes;
the blind Fawcett being led across Westminster Bridge. On the other
side of the Bridge I once met Archbishop Benson, and noted his
eyes, blue, selfconscious, and shy; I had earlier seen his
predecessor a few yards further away, the grave statesmanlike Tait,
stopping outside Westminster Bridge station to read the newspaper
placards; and on the platform of that station I once saw the
dark-eyed Huxley waiting for the train. Across the Bridge I recall
once by chance seeing King Edward in his carriage, sitting up
stiffly, trying to look every inch a king, for he was a king who
always, as they used to say, "played the game."</p>

<p>The there practical difficulties of my student days were much
greater than they would be now. More than two hours a day had to be
spent in going to and from the Hospital, partly by train, partly by
walking, so that I was at a. considerable disadvantage compared to
the students who occupied lodgings within a few yards. Another
difficulty&mdash;incredible as it may now seem&mdash;was the
impossibility of obtaining a light midday meal, even at Charing
Cross. A heavy meal, then as always, was bad for my work, and at
that time also bad for my purse; I usually had to fall back on the
pastry-cook shops and eat sausage rolls, which soon became
nauseating, and I have never been able to touch them since. Ivly
chief obstacles, however, were mental rather than physical. No
doubt the idea still remained at the back of my mind that the main
object of my medical education was the education itself, the
training for life in the broad sense, a method of obtaining a more
complete grasp of the world than would otherwise be possible, in
the preparation for my own special work. But, at the same time, I
thought that, incidentally, medicine must be my way of earning a
living, and so I wished to take it seriously and aimed at the
highest qualifications. There were two great hindrances to this
aim, both lying in my own nature: in the first place, the expanding
and many-sided activities of my mind, hitherto shut in on
themselves by the conditions of my life in Australia but now
afforded ample means of satisfaction at the moment of most vigorous
expansion; and in the second place my own mental characteristics.
For whatever powers I may chance to possess, they are slow and
limited and amply blended with the stupidity of which I find so
much around me in other people. Then my memory, while excellent for
the things that interest me, has always been unreliable for
everything else, so that I have never trusted it and always made
notes of everything I might desire some day to recall. There was
here a combination of qualities&mdash;emphasized by my caution and
hesitation&mdash;fatal to success in examinations of any kind. That
I speedily discovered. I entered for matriculation at the
University of London, but failed in several subjects, so that I
felt no encouragement to make a second attempt but fell back on my
Sydney matriculation as an entrance in Arts to the medical
profession. After I abandoned the attempt to become a graduate of
London I proposed to myself the joint qualifications of the London
Colleges of Physicians and Surgeons and passed some of their
examinations; but failing at the final surgery I was content in the
end with the Licence of the Society of Apothecaries, which had then
recently become a full and adequate qualification in medicine,
surgery and midwifery, though it lacks prestige and is always a
little unintelligible for even the most intelligent foreigner, as I
have sometimes observed.</p>

<p>But the long course of preparation for examinations which I
sometimes passed and sometimes failed to pass involved an immense
amount of drudgery and wasted time during the most active years of
my life. Probably there was some benefit to me in the earlier
stages of this training, as there certainly was in the later and
more definitely medical stage, and I have never failed to realise
that it was all indispensable for my work in life; but the hours
spent in tedious attempts to memorise the details of anatomy and
pharmacology and similar for me dead subjects, swiftly sliding from
my mind which had to be perpetually burdening itself with them
anew, seem as fruitless to me now as they seemed then. Comparative
anatomy and physiology were more attractive, and in practical
chemistry, which has something of the same deductive charm as
Euclid, I was a good pupil. But this long, worrying and uncongenial
course of preparation for examinations constituted an element of
strain through seven years of my life. It was inevitable, it was
worth while, for it forged a necessary link in the chain of my
life's work. But otherwise it was simply a prolonged period of
anxiety in a field mostly alien to my temper of mind. I recall how,
when at last the hour for an examination arrived, I would throw
aside my books and note-books with a desperate joy, inwardly
exclaiming: <i>Jacta est ilea!</i> Then I stumbled nervously, with
a damaging self-distrust, through the <i>viva voce</i> examination,
usually after doing rather better in the written papers, and
anxiety would recur until the day came for the announcement of the
results. I remember going up to the board in the hall of the
College of Physicians one day, and on finding my name there walking
swiftly and briskly away. I should have failed to notice, as I
passed them, two unknown youths with slow, dragging steps if I had
not heard one of them remark: "He's through!" Evidently their
psychological insight was sounder than their medical knowledge.</p>

<p>When I consider not only my intrinsic disabilities in medical
study, but the manifold extrinsic impediments to these studies, my
wonder is that I ever secured an honourable medical qualification
at all. I was a youth of the largest intellectual and emotional
appetites, practically fresh to London and altogether fresh to
life. I was eager and receptive for all that life could offer, for
all the finest pleasures of the senses, for arts and for sciences,
for philosophy and for ethics, not least for love. Moreover, I had
not the slightest idea, and even if I had the idea I doubt if I had
the power, of sacrificing any of these appetites to the mere
necessity for professional study. Life, after all, I had always
instinctively felt, was my business, and a professional education
was merely a rather dull and narrow channel to life. So I soaked
myself in all the delights&mdash;save the merely coarse and sensual
delights for me without appeal&mdash;which London could offer to my
adventurous spirit. It is a marvel to me now, when I try
imperfectly to recall the immense range of my interests and
activities in those years from 1881 to 1889, how I could possibly
have found time or opportunity or strength to squeeze my medical
studies anywhere into the course of my life. Yet I know that I was
faithful in my attendance at lectures, no laggard in the dissecting
room, and not behind the average student in the amount of time I
spent at the Hospital. A part of the secret, no doubt, was that I
never wasted a moment over the superstition of games, and that I
had no recreations beyond those that might have seemed to most
students work. My interests in life were so varied and so vivid
that they amply sufficed to supply me with physical exercise and
mental recreation. Then, as always, I never knew what was play and
what was work. No play is interesting to me unless it effects work,
and no work is possible to me unless it possesses the amusement of
play. So that the whole of life has always had for me the
seriousness which for most people only their games possess, and
their games have for me no existence because they seem to me to be
outside life. Throughout life people have told me how they
marvelled at the amount of work I accomplish. I have been tempted
to reply: But I never work at all!</p>

<p class="caption">Havelock Ellis, at The Time he Began his Medical
Studies</p>

<p>To literature, in the wide sense, no doubt, whether in the form
of writing or of reading, I instinctively gave a foremost place. I
suppose that, directly I came home from Australia, and while still
a teacher, with no prospect, so far as I knew, of carrying out my
scheme of medical study, I began to write a little, only a little,
and very slowly, for if I am, according to the Goethean maxim,
"without rest," I have certainly always been "without haste."
Writing as an art had at first meant for me verse. That was so even
before I left England in the <i>Surrey,</i> but it was more
definitely so in Australia. For a few years after I returned to
England I still wrote sonnets, and wrote them better; but I
gradually ceased to write them, not by deliberate resolve but by
the force of events. They needed calm and leisure, and my life had
become crowded with manifold activities. Moreover, the growth of my
intellectual life for a while submerging my emotional life, I began
to feel the need of prose, the vigour of scientific expression, and
for the first time I realised definitely that prose also is art. At
Sparkes Creek I had indeed initiated my own personal prose writing,
but, though carefully, yet instinctively, seeking to express myself
with precision, I was hardly yet, I think, conscious of prose as a
medium of art.</p>

<p>The first paper I recall writing in England and the first of
mine ever printed (in an obscure literary journal, the <i>Pen</i>)
was a review of a book on Rubens. The choice of subject indicated
that I had a living interest in that master. Rubens was indeed the
first great artist&mdash;though by no means the last&mdash;whom I
discovered for myself. After an early period of repulsion for what
seemed to an idealistic boy&mdash;accepting without question the
Madonnas and Saints of Raphael&mdash;his ugliness and coarseness, I
had suddenly in a flash, before one of his most swiftly painted
sketches in the National Gallery, received the revelation of the
miracle of his genius, and so acquired an interest in his
personality and work. Another paper I published a little later,
though slight, was more characteristic and personal: "What is
Pureness?" A rather well-known woman writer of that time had
written an article entitled "The Sanction of Pureness." It
presented fairly conventional views, but in my little comment,
which was not a direct attack, I suggested&mdash;herein more or
less inspired by Hinton&mdash;that we may have to remould our ideas
as to what "pureness" means, in plainer words, that pureness does
not necessarily mean sexual continence. Therein I had already taken
a tiny step on the path along which my life-work was to lie and I
expounded the same conception of "pureness" more clearly and
elaborately in my <i>Little Essays of Love and Virtue</i> forty
years later. The author of the original article published "A
Rejoinder," beginning with a reference to Pilate's question, "What
is Truth?", as though my attitude had been sceptical, which showed
that she had entirely failed to grasp what I was driving at. I
realised that I had not yet learnt how to make my meaning clear. My
little paper had been written in a way that was delicate, musical,
suggestive, to the point as I thought, though without insistence
and without emphasis. It was, in short, the way of writing which,
as I now suspect, may have been unconsciously influenced by Newman,
though I do not mean to imply that Newman could not make his
meaning clear. After that, there may certainly have begun, though
very slowly, the change in my style which during the next fifteen
years was to render it more vigorous, positive and masculine.</p>

<p>My first elaborate essay, however, was written, and with much
care, before this change became manifest. It was on "Thomas Hardy's
Novels," and I expect it was the most comprehensive and thoughtful
little essay that had so far been written on that subject. My
friend Mackay, as I have told, brought to me <i>Far from the
Madding Crowd</i> on its appearance when I was a schoolboy, and it
was my first taste of Hardy. But there followed a phase of
enthusiastic admiration for George Eliot, and it was not till after
my return to England that a deep appreciation of Hardy developed in
my mind. Then I set myself to read everything of his that had yet
appeared, so far as I could ascertain. Merely to read all that an
author has written never seemed to me, however, even at that age
when I was making my first attempt at criticism, an adequate
preparation to write about him. To me it was a matter of course to
investigate his environment. I accordingly planned an Easter
holiday in Dorset and speedily carried out this plan, selecting
Weymouth as my centre. It was in the spring of 1881, and I remember
that when I walked into the Public Library I saw in the papers the
accounts of Lord Beaconsfield lying near death at Hughenden Manor,
the house that thirty years later I was so often to be driven past
on the road that now has for me its poignant memories. But at
Weymouth I spent a most pleasant time, so pleasant a time that I
have never ventured to attempt repeating it. I revelled in the
lovely atmospheric effects on the heights of Portland; I walked to
Dorchester and various other places; I wandered along the
characteristic Dorset "white roads up athirt the hills," as Barnes
calls them, and by a happy superogatory chance I came upon Barnes's
dialect poems in my lodging-house sittingroom and was so enabled to
gain a better knowledge of the poet of the land of which Hardy was
the novelist.</p>

<p>I now felt I had a grip of Hardy's environment. But the next
step, to see him or even to write, I made no attempt to take; I was
far too modest and retiring for such a notion even to enter my
head, apart from the fact that meeting people has rarely indeed
presented itself to me as a desirable end to seek. When later I met
Hardy it was he who proposed it, not I.</p>

<p>I dwell on this essay because it has its place in my
development. It was in writing it that I learnt to write. The
opening sentence was a problem of great difficulty to me; I know
that I spent days, if not indeed weeks, over it, though it emerged
simple enough in the end. All the rest was written, if with less
hesitation, with not less care and deliberation.</p>

<p>Probably I sent my essay to some of the chief Reviews, which
speedily returned it; I do not remember. In any case it found its
way before long, in a rather abbreviated form, to the hands of Dr.
Chapman, the editor for many previous years of the old
<i>Westminster Review,</i> which, although it had fallen from the
high place it occupied a quarter of a century earlier, still held a
respectable position as the Review of intellectual Radicalism,
though even here the <i>Fortnightly</i> overshadowed it. An amiable
letter soon arrived from Chapman asking to see the full version of
my essay; that he accepted and published in April, 1883. Almost
immediately there came to me a letter from Hardy in which he
expressed in the most charming manner possible his appreciation of
my effort: "I consider the essay a remarkable paper in many ways,
and can truly say that the writing itself, with its charm of style,
and variety of allusion, occupied my mind when first reading it far
more than the fact that my own unmethodical books were its subject
matter." And towards the end of the letter he added that he hoped
"to read some more of your critical writings in the future, and
believe I shall discover them without a mark."</p>

<p>Nothing more delightful could happen to a young writer, on
publishing his first essay, than such a letter as this from a
master in literature. It may be discounted as a compliment felt to
be due under the circumstances; but there is a genuine note in it
not usually to be heard in letters of this kind, and Hardy really
showed an interest in my later critical writings. I have always
been fairly indifferent to opinions on my work, and was never
tempted to subscribe to press-cutting agencies, but that letter of
Hardy's has always remained to me a source of pleasure.</p>

<p>In the effort of writing this article I completed my
apprenticeship in the art of writing and really deserved a word of
approval. The essay has never been reprinted; after some hesitation
I resolved not to include it, six years latei, in <i>The New
Spirit.</i> The mark of apprenticeship still seemed to cling to it,
and, moreover, I was moving away from the rather refined, delicate,
and allusive manner of that little study.</p>

<p>The same manner still marked, however, the sketch I wrote in
story form in the years that followed, that is to say the middle
eighties, entitled <i>Kanga Creek: An Australian Idyll.</i> It is
the only thing I have written in story form, though I have planned
and even begun others. Really it is modified autobiography, and it
was the stress of a personal impulse, the desire to give some sort
of expression, however imperfect, to the memory of what I already
felt, as I still feel, to have been the most seminal and even the
most ideal year of my life, the year I spent at Sparkes Creek. But
I found I could only encompass the expression by throwing it into a
form of art. So I left out nearly all the really significant events
of my life during that memorable year&mdash;the events that I have
now tried to record here&mdash;and simply selected little details
of my daily life, some of the sensory impressions that struck me,
and a few of my emotional expressions, as truthfully as I could
render them. The hero was not wholly myself, and the heroine never
had any real existence at all. But the background was exact, for
the most part, though I placed my Creek in an impossible part of
New South Wales, not on the road that led to the Liverpool Range
but on that to Carcoar (whence also I borrowed a few details), and
all the minor figures of my tale were portraits. That was the main
reason&mdash;but also the fact that there was much in the idyll
that was personal&mdash;why I never made, or wished to make, any
attempt to publish it until some forty years later. But I showed it
to a few friends, who all expressed interest, especially Olive
Schreiner, who encouraged me to complete it. Arthur Symons, one of
the earliest and most careful readers, told me it belonged to the
same class as Flaubert's <i>Trois Contes.</i> I knew, however, as
he certainly knew, that it had nothing of the fine solidity that
marked even Flaubert's short stories; indeed, although I have
always felt for Flaubert and his work an admiration bordering on
worship, I do not regard myself as even remotely of the same type,
and my qualities as a writer are scarcely of his kind. During the
acute period of my mental development in Australia, I had already,
I believe, begun to take a slight interest in philosophy,
proceeding no doubt out of my religious struggle, and it was, I
think, in Australia, that I procured Schwegler's <i>History of
Philosophy,</i> not an inspiring book or one that gave me any
enjoyment, though I read it faithfully. Only after Hinton had
entered the course of my psychic life was I able to take a really
vivid interest in any philosophic problems. Hinton himself was a
philosopher of too vague a sort to push me in any definite
direction. When, however, my article on Hinton appeared in
<i>Mind,</i> Croom Robertson, the editor, seems to have approved of
it, for he asked me to review books and send further contributions,
which I occasionally did, and Thomas Davidson, who read the article
with care, pronounced it "judicial," I think with a certain
admiration, for that was a quality beyond the reach of his own
fervid and emotional temperament. I now subscribed to <i>Mind</i>
and faithfully read it, as well as a number of books in the field
of philosophy and comparative religion, European and Oriental,
especially those dealing with Buddhism, a religion which appealed
to me because of its absence of dogma and freedom from
theology.</p>

<p>My reading in this department was furthered by a chance that put
me in charge, for a year or two, of the theological and religious
reviewing department of the <i>Westminster Review.</i> Soon after
the Hardy article appeared Dr. Chapman expressed a wish to meet me
during one of his visits to London from his Paris home, and later
he also came to my Earlswood home to see me; he evidently felt for
me a considerable degree of personal regard. He asked me to
contribute further to the <i>Review</i> (here was published my
essay on Diderot), and a little later in 1886, when Mr. Philip
Wicksteed resigned the "Theology" (Religion and Philosophy)
reviewing work, he invited me&mdash;a most incompetent successor to
one so accomplished&mdash;to take his place; it was a post to which
a small salary was attached and I gladly accepted. Chapman was at
this time attempting to put the <i>Review</i> on a better financial
base and to give it a more modern form. Had he succeeded, he told
me, he would have offered me the post of sub-editor. I expect I
could have imparted new life to the concern; I have often thought I
should make a good editor for an advanced review; but Chapman's
scheme aborted and no other chance ever came my way.</p>

<p>After Chapman's death, a few years later, the <i>Wlestminster
Review</i> gradually faded away. He was a large and handsome man of
imposing appearance, which suggested, no doubt unjustly, a touch of
the apostolic charlatan, while in early life, it is said, he was
equally striking and nicknamed "Byron" by his friends. He was
really a man of quiet solid ability, genuinely advanced in his
ideas, once a courageous pioneer in various fields, and gifted with
an insight that enabled him to recognise and assist some of the
most daring and distinguished thinkers of his time. He could have
written a remarkable book about them and himself, as I once at
least suggested to him, but he was always very reserved and never
talked of his own interesting experiences. I used to go to see him
when in Paris, both at his professional rooms in the Rue de Rivoli
and his handsome apartment in the Avenue Kléber, where notable
Frenchmen were to be met. The last time I saw him he said sadly,
though he seemed in excellent health, that he was tired of living.
Soon afterwards, during our honeymoon in Paris, he sent a
messenger, before we were out of bed on the morning of departure,
to invite us to his home. Three years later he died. There was some
mystery, I slowly divined, in his domestic life. Mrs. Chapman had a
defiant air which suggested an uncertainty of position. The two
nieces who lived permanently with them seemed to me probably his
daughters, and later I found reason to conclude that I was right.
The elder girl, charming and beautiful, became a journalist in
Fleet Street and soon after died as the result of an illegal
operation. The younger, nearly twenty years after I had lost all
touch with the family, appeared unannounced at my house at West
Drayton and borrowed money; she said she was engaged to be married,
and she asked me to make out the cheque to her in the name of
Chapman. I never heard from her again, nor expected to. Still
later, I saw in the papers that Mrs. Chapman, who for a while had
attempted to carry on the <i>Review,</i> had been rescued from the
workhouse into which she had drifted; shortly afterwards she died.
She had immediately after Chapman's death announced an intention to
write his biography and such a work would have been of much
interest. Now it would be difficult to do, for his papers were
abandoned to chance and scattered. Many years later two of his
private diaries were picked up for a trifle in Nottingham (which
happens to be his birthplace), and fortunately they came into good
hands. A few extracts were published in <i>The Times Literary
Supplement</i> of September 11th, 1930. Some of them were of much
interest to me; I had somehow guessed that George Eliot, before she
knew Lewes, had been in love with Chapman, undoubtedly an
attractive and sympathetic man for such a woman; nothing he himself
said to me suggested this; his answers to any questions about her
were vague and reserved and it is noteworthy that, notwithstanding
his long and close association with her, living in the same house
and acting as her editor and publisher, he contributed nothing to
her biographies. But entries in the diaries confirmed my intuition,
if so it may be termed.</p>

<p>More fruitful in the end than my association with Dr. Chapman
was the still earlier association with Foulger, the friendly
printer, editor and publisher of <i>Modern Thought.</i> He was a
pleasant and intelligent little man, without culture, but in touch
not only with men of letters but with radicals of the old school
and young socialists of a new school which had still hardly come
into being. I used often to look in at his office in Paternoster
Row, and we would sometimes go out for tea together to the Cyprus,
a tea-shop on a first floor at the end of the Row, overlooking
Cheapside. I was not always Foulger's only companion on these
occasions, for his dingy little office was the resort of all the
leaders in the new political and socialist movement. He was now
publishing and editing <i>To-day,</i> a monthly magazine to which
brilliant representatives of the new social movements, shut out
from other avenues to publicity, were always welcomed. In
<i>To-day</i> (where a few small things of mine were printed)
Ibsen's later work reached the English public in Miss Lord's
translation; Bernard Shaw's work in fiction first appeared; and the
advocates of socialism and land nationalisation had a free field.
As Foulger was printer and publisher as well as editor, all sorts
of people destined to become more or less famous gravitated to 13
Paternoster Row. I am not sure that it was here I first met
Hyndman, then beginning his heroic attempt to acclimatise in
England an unanglicised Marxism, though I well remember the last
time when dining with my wife at Professor Herron's rooms in
London, and how when Mrs. Herrin, a real musician, was at the
piano, Hyndman would attempt to hum in tune with the music to my
wife's scarcely concealed disgust. Here I certainly began a
friendly relationship with Belfort Bax, a daring adventurer in
theoretical fields but, as Foulger observed with amusement, too
timid to walk down the Lisson Grove slum by himself. Here used to
come Morrison Davidson, a popular orator and journalist among the
working class, and the brother of Thomas Davidson, but a totally
different sort of person; he was too fond of beer and I best
remember him sitting asleep in Foulger's office with head resting
on arms on a table. Champion and Frost, two amiable and
noble-spirited young men, both propagandising advocates of land
nationalisation and both of good family, though neither destined to
become a great leader, were often here. Champion's devotion to the
cause of the people was ardent and disinterested, but eventually he
seems to have fallen into disfavour&mdash;perhaps the working man
found him too obviously a "gentleman" to be congenial; his health
also was affected by venereal disease, and he went to Australia,
where he took a moderately active part in Labour movements, and
there ultimately died. Frost was large and solid and quiet, a
country parson's son, clearly also an honest and simple-minded
gentleman; his career ended more swiftly. He went to the north of
Scotland to propagandise among the restless crofters; there he fell
in with a clever adventuress professing to be on a similar mission,
a washerwoman's daughter who posed as a great lady among the
crofters and solemnly presented to them what she said was her
grandfather's sword, telling them that it was for "defence and not
for offence." She captured Frost, who fell hopelessly in love with
her and joined his fate with hers. The washerwoman's daughter was
soon convicted and sent to prison for all sorts of frauds and
vulgar criminal tricks, and Frost was shipped off by his family to
America; I never heard more of him. A demagogic leader of a more
typical sort also came to Foulger's, a working man destined to
become famous later, John Burns, now a Right Honourable member of
the Privy Council of the Realm; but I best recall him on the day
that he came out of prison direct to Foulger, to tell us in a
quiet, subdued way at the Cyprus tea-table of his prison
experiences.</p>

<p>These casual meetings had no special influence. Political
movements, especially of a demagogic nature, were not calculated to
appeal to my temperament. Foulger, moreover, through whom I came
into contact with these people and their ideas, was himself, though
alert, inquisitive, and sympathetic, often critical, and his own
advocacy of a progressive educated democracy, based on the
radicalism of the immediate past, fitted in fairly well with my own
ideas at that time. When, therefore, Foulger, to whose home in
Maida Vale I would sometimes go on Sundays to dinner, proposed to
establish a "Progressive Association" to further these views,
primarily by holding Sunday evening meetings with lectures, but
with further schemes in the background, for the promotion of all
sorts of large progressive movements, I willingly joined. Foulger
was able to induce several distinguished Radicals of the old
school, like Holyoake, the co-operative pioneer, to join the
committee; some accomplished people connected with the South Place
ethical movement, a useful contingent, were willing to assist; and
a few prim and stolid free-thinkers of Noncomformist mind and
habit, mostly of shop-keeping class, gave stability to the Society.
I was the youngest and probably the most enthusiastic adherent, and
so it fell to me to become the secretary. My self-sacrificing zeal
amuses me now, but it was genuine, and although in more recent
years I have frequently denied the idea of "Progress," I by no
means condemn the practical activities of the Progressive
Association. I never appeared prominently at the meetings, and
never once spoke a word in public; but I had a considerable hand in
the conduct of the Association and in the selection and invitation
of the lecturers, who included men of high distinction. We had
taken a hall on Islington Green for our meetings, a place, we
learnt afterwards, where the Parnellite members of Parliament were
also accustomed to meet in secret conclave to discuss their
sometimes rather conspiratory policies. Every Sunday evening,
whatever the weather, I set out from my home at Anerley on the
dreary journey across London to Islington. It was characteristic of
my mother's tolerant attitude that she accepted without any
protests this unconventional missionary activity of my Sunday
evenings, perhaps recognising it to be, as it was, a transformation
of her own religious spirit. Sometimes I would go with Foulger into
the streets near the Hall, beforehand, to distribute the handbills
of the meeting. While it was being held I sat by the draughty door,
to give information, receive subscriptions, and sell the
literature. Incidentally, I thus acquired a susceptibility to sore
throats and colds which pursued me nearly all through life. In
addition to other activities on behalf of the Association, in order
to supplement the instrumental music at our meetings and to 'bring
out our ethical spirit, I compiled a little book of <i>Hymns of
Progress,</i> which was published by the Association. This was a
task to my taste, and the book may indeed be said to be notable,
not only by its literary level, but as the first congregational
hymnbook, so far as I know, definitely disengaged from religious
creeds, and without any theological or even theistic tinge. I wrote
for it a little hymn of my own.</p>

<p class="poem">"Onward, brothers, march still onward,"</p>

<p>which has since been introduced into many Socialist and other
song books, and when my friends have sneered at it, and at the
whole affair, I have sometimes playfully declared that it is by
this that my name will be remembered.</p>

<p>To the Progressive came, a little later, as an active member,
Percival Chubb, destined to be an important link in my lifestory,
especially the clue that later led me to the discovery of my wife,
whose name I first heard from his lips. Chubb, at that time a clerk
in the Local Government Board Department at Whitehall, was an
ardent young idealist, indifferent to science, not then keenly
interested in art except to some extent in literature, but with a
wider and more eager receptivity than mine for the new
philosophical, ethical and social movements of the day. He was
sociable and entered various circles, so that he knew more of these
movements and came more closely in touch with their representatives
than was easy for me with my reserved and retiring nature. He was
without the originality and the force which place a man in conflict
with his own time, but happily endowed with abilities and
accomplishments which, combined with his really fine qualities of
character, fitted him for good work in the ethical movements of the
United States, to which a few years later he migrated, and there
remains, after forty years, still active. I soon fell into friendly
relations with him as we were both interested in so many of the
same subjects and were pursuing them in the same honest and
ingenuous manner. Before long Chubb became joint secretary with me
of the Progressive Association and was able to take a more public
part.</p>

<p>It was easy for me to meet Chubb as St. Thomas's is within a few
minutes' walk of Whitehall, whither indeed I frequently went to
obtain my slight lunch at a pastrycook's. Sometimes, as we walked
together, he would speak of a man for whom he had great admiration,
a man of world-wide reputation, it appeared, though I had not heard
of him, an original philosopher, a marvellously learned scholar, a
great ethical leader who sought to renew the life of society on a
loftier plane, one Thomas Davidson. It seemed that Davidson loved
to gather young men round him and inspire them with his ideas;
Chubb, though he retained a certain independence of judgment, was
such a disciple, and had indeed once gone over to
Italy&mdash;Davidson wandered much about the world, and was
especially attracted to Italy, where one heard of him as a guest in
a Rosminian monastery or renting a house in Capri or staying in the
centre of Rome&mdash;in order to spend a few weeks with the Master
at Domodossola. One day he told me that Davidson was shortly coming
to London and wanted to meet a few young men likely to be
sympathetic to advanced philosophical and ethical views of life. He
duly arrived, took rooms in Chelsea, and shortly afterwards I met
him, first, I think, at rooms shared by Chubb with his friend
Roland Estcourt, somewhere on the Thames Embankment.</p>

<p>Thomas Davidson was really a remarkable man; that was clear to
me even on a first meeting; he was alive, intensely and warmly
alive, as even his complexion and colouring seemed to show; here
was the perfervid emotional Scottish temperament carried almost or
quite to the point of genius. At the same time here was clearly a
man who had lived a rich and varied life in many lands, acquiring
at once a wide experience of men and a deep knowledge of literature
and philosophy, while retaining a fresh and ardent interest in
both. I came away feeling that this was the most remarkable man,
the most intensely alive man, I had ever met; I am not at all sure
that I should not say so still.* It may have been this same evening
that William Clarke was present, also meeting Davidson for the
first time, and similarly impressed. (On Davidson's death in 1900
Clarke wrote in the <i>Spectator</i> an article on "A Modern
Wandering Scholar" which, even if not entirely accurate, was
perhaps the best appreciation of this imperfectly appreciated man.)
Clarke was a prominent journalist, a leader writer in the <i>Daily
Chronicle,</i> then the most advanced London Liberal newspaper, an
admirable journalist of a rare type, ardent and upright, a
genuinely convinced democrat, inspired by the ideals of Whitman,
about whom he wrote a book; withal something of a thinker, expert
in economics, and widely interested in life and literature. He and
I walked away along the Embankment together, and from about that
time he became interested in me also, being indeed my earliest
outspoken friend in the press, and the writer (in the <i>Echo</i>),
some seven years later, of the first article about me, as distinct
from mere book-reviews.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* My impressions of Davidson are recorded in a
letter quoted by Professor William Knight in his book on Davidson.
But Knight was mistaken in describing me as an "intimate friend" of
Davidson's. I was never that, and Davidson still remains for me an
unsolved enigma. He was, as Knight once told me, an illegitimate
child, and perhaps that may have had something to do with it.]</p>

<p>During the weeks that followed I often saw Davidson. I talked to
him frankly of the things that then interested me, especially of
Hinton's doctrines. He always listened with genuine interest, as
though I were telling him something he had long been anxious to
hear, and I introduced him to Mrs. Hinton and Miss Haddon. He was
much readier to enter sympathetically into my interests and ideas
than to claim attention for his own, so that it was only by degrees
that I realised the wide extent of his interests and his knowledge.
But at times, and especially when several of us were together, he
would grow eloquent in setting forth his own philosophic
conceptions. I remember that immortality seemed just then a
favourite idea of his, and he regarded Tennyson's <i>In
Memoriam</i> as a philosophic and convincing argument for that
idea, while to me <i>In Memoriam,</i> which I had studied so
carefully in Australia, was just a poem, a beautiful poem, but as
an argument not worth a moment's consideration. I quoted Emerson
against him on this question of immortality, and he&mdash;remarking
he had himself re-read Emerson's statement that same
morning&mdash;retorted by quoting Goethe against me. In the end his
last resort was always the unction of his own fervent conviction,
but that was an argument which for me carried not a feather's
weight. He would complain that I seemed to listen sympathetically
and to be carried entirely along with him, and yet next day he
would find that I had been moved not at all. It was quite true; it
is always my impulse to listen and to absorb sympathetically;
agreement is another matter. Such an attitude seems to me the only
reasonable attitude. The people who think they can judge even only
a dinner by a mere sniff seem to me people of no account. A mere
sniff, whether of a dinner or a philosophy, can tell us but little;
we must take it in to judge of its quality. This difference
continued between us by letter, after Davidson had gone on from
London to Rome. It was too much for him before long; he had rarely
been attracted to anyone so much as to me, he wrote (in a letter
which has now gone astray); but he could not stand this perpetual
obstinate criticism; he ceased to write. I was content to make no
effort to continue the correspondence. Much as Davidson had
impressed me, I had never felt any response to his warm friendship.
We exchanged a few friendly letters in later years. What was
perhaps the last, in response to one from me, was written from
America in 1888, and contained numerous suggestions (one or two of
which I adopted) for volumes in the Contemporary Science Series I
was then projecting. "Why don't you write to me sometimes?" he
added.</p>

<p>But he had done me a great service, a service which was the last
he would have desired to do: he had cut me adrift for ever, not
indeed from philosophy, but from the philosophers. He had convinced
me that his own philosophy was a purely personal matter to which
there was no need to ask anyone else to subscribe. I passed on to
realise that the same might be said of every philosopher.
Incidentally, I was thus warned that I must not allow myself to be
caught in the web of Hinton's philosophy. Every man must be his own
philosopher. It was Davidson, little as he desired to do it, who
taught me that. When in later years I wrote a passage to that
effect, in an essay on Nietzsche in my <i>Affirmations,</i> it was
Davidson I had in mind.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Davidson had set in action a movement which continued
to grow and gather strength, though by no means altogether on his
lines, after he left London. The earliest group of us, some half
dozen in number, have not for the most part made any great name in
the world. The Fellowship of the New Life was founded (I believe I
had a considerable finger in writing its manifesto) to promote the
general social renovation of the world on the broadest and highest
lines, seeking inspiration in its Goethean motto:</p>

<p class="quote">"Im Ganzen, Guten, Schönen resolut zu leben."</p>

<p>A little later, as it grew, the Fabian Society, with a more
practical and political programme, broke off from it, and with the
aid of me who have since attained fame, notably Sidney Webb and
Bernard Shaw, it played the leading part in permeating England with
an anglicised form of Socialism. It is in accordance with the irony
of human affairs that "Fabianism" should indirectly have been
produced by a man so alien to its spirit as Thomas Davidson. I, who
had no political interests, while sympathetic with the Fabians,
decided to remain with the parent body, though as I came to realise
the inevitable limitations of the movement, my more active
participation diminished and ceased, Edith Lees&mdash;my wife to
be&mdash;who had been introduced by Chubb simultaneously becoming
its chief organiser and guiding spirit. It continued its quietly
influential existence for some years (publishing a little paper
called <i>Seed-time</i> and holding meetings) until after Edith
Lees's marriage, when it peacefully expired.</p>

<p>It was at one of the meetings of the New Fellowship that I first
saw Edward Carpenter, who was naturally more in sympathy with its
ideals than with those of the more political Fabians, though he was
later regarded as furnishing the ideal inspiration of the Labour
Movement. We were in the midst of a meeting at Williams's Library
(then in Gower Street) and Nicholas Tchaykowsky&mdash;at one moment
many years later conspicuous in Russian affairs&mdash;was, I
remember, with us; many of the Russian exiles indeed, and notably
the saintly Frey, were our friends, for our ideals were not unlike
those of the anarchists though we did not give ourselves that name.
I was sitting with my back to the door and hearing someone gently
open it I turned round for a moment and saw two brightly gleaming
eyes out of the background of a quietly humorous face. In that
first swift glance, as will sometimes happen, I gained a more vivid
picture of Edward Carpenter's characteristic face than in all the
long years I knew him afterwards. It had been through the New
Fellowship that I first heard Carpenter's name. At one of the
earlier meetings a youth sat beside me who chanced to be in touch
with various new things, and he put into my hands a small book,
just published, entitled <i>Towards Democracy</i>. I opened it,
glanced at a few pages, and returned it with the remark: "Whitman
and water." A little later I saw a new second-hand copy in a box of
books at a few pence each in Booksellers' Row, as the long since
vanished Holywell Street in the Strand was called. I thought it
might be worth while to rescue it, and I soon found that <i>Towards
Democracy</i> was something much more than Whitman and water, that
Carpenter was a person of altogether different temperament from
Whitman, and had here written a genuinely original book full of
inspiring and beautiful and consoling things, a book, indeed, that
before long was to become for some people a kind of Bible. I wrote
to him to express my appreciation and at the same time told him
something of my own difficulties in life. He replied with words of
sympathy and encouragement. It was the beginning of a friendship
which lasted till his death, some forty-five years later,*
fortified on his side when he discovered in me a champion of the
sexual invert's right to existence and on mine by the fact that my
wife admired him almost more than any other man, learning to know
him better than I did, and being indeed almost his disciple, so far
as she could be the disciple of anyone, though towards the end she
seemed to detect some weak points in his, on some sides, rather
feminine nature.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* I am writing now three months after his
death in 1929. In 1927, I think, he came to spend a day or two with
me in the country. But he was beginning to fail mentally and
physically. He ceased to write and I was disinclined to see him in
that state, content to know he was well cared for and fairly
cheerful. But I was not forgotten by him, though he had forgotten
so many people he knew. He mentioned my name not long before the
end and expressed a wish to see me. Before I had made up my mind to
go he was dead.]</p>

<p>I had been in correspondence with him but a short time when he
came down to our little home at Earlswood to spend the night; my
mother always had family prayers after breakfast, and I still
remember that Carpenter (who had once been a clergyman) sat bravely
and patiently through the prayers while we all knelt, for by habit
and affection I always completely acquiesced in this family
ceremony. At that period I had no knowledge of Carpenter's personal
temperament, though that, when I learnt it, caused me no shock and
made no difference to me. Personally, I never once came across the
least evidence of it, though I heard much from others.</p>

<p>It was indirectly through Percival Chubb and the New Fellowship
that I was put on to my literary path, Chapman and the
<i>Westminster Review</i> proving a blind alley. Two of Chubb's
nearest friends were Ernest Rhys and Will Dircks, both of whom had
become connected with the Walter Scott Publishing Company, Rhys as
editor of the Camelot Series (later of the more extensive Everyman
Series, with another publisher) and Dircks in the publishing
office. This business had just been taken over as a bad debt by a
great building contractor of that time, afterwards made a Baronet,
Walter Scott, an ignorant and uncultivated man but with an insight
into business ability, and he had chosen a manager and given him
fairly full powers. This manager, Gordon, of little education but
whom Dircks once described to me as "a Napoleon of business,"
quickly made the publishing house of Walter Scott a great success;
he flooded the whole country with good cheap editions of the
English classics in prose and verse and was at the same time ready
to encourage new ability whenever he could find it, publishing the
early works of several writers who later became famous. It
naturally happened that I met both Rhys and Dircks on some of the
New Fellowship country excursions&mdash;as later it naturally
happened that on such an excursion I first met my future
wife&mdash;and before long I was editing numerous volumes for the
Camelot Series. The first (1886) was a selection of Landor's
<i>Imaginary Conversations,</i> for which I continued&mdash;and
still continue&mdash;to experience an admiration which began when I
was seventeen in the Public Library of Sydney. Landor is, for me, a
kind of English Flaubert, though I would doubtless place Flaubert
first and have given more attention to him. There followed next
year a volume of Heine's <i>Prose Writings,</i> a volume which
still finds friends, for it perhaps remains the best English
selection of Heine's prose; some of the translations were my own,
especially the <i>Florentine Nights,</i> which I had done for my
own instruction when I was learning German out of Heine at Grafton,
and I am not ashamed of it even yet. Then, in 1888, came Ibsen's
<i>Pillars of Society and Other Plays</i> (which were <i>Ghosts</i>
and <i>An Enemy of Society</i>), a volume which played a notable
part in its time, for it was practically the first attempt to bring
Ibsen in his most characteristic aspect before the English public,
and it arrived at the right moment, exactly when the advanced party
in England were ready and eager to receive Ibsen.</p>

<p>Meanwhile (in 1884) I also made my first attempt to write for
the leading Reviews, having already published several articles in
the <i>Westminster</i> and other Reviews which were not quite in
the first line. The subject of my article was "The Present Position
of English Criticism," and I sent it to the <i>Fortnighty
Review,</i> where it was accepted by the editor, Escott, to my
great satisfaction. But a day or two later, under some
unintelligible pretext, it was sent back rejected. What made the
editor so swiftly change his mind I could not ascertain, but I
expect it was ill-health, for which reason, not long after, he
ceased to be editor. His successor, Courtney, accepted nearly every
contribution I sent him, while Sir James Knowles of the
<i>Nineteenth Century</i> and Sir Percy Bunting of the
<i>Contemporary Review,</i> although I never made any attempt to
approach either of them personally, became my most friendly and
appreciative editors until their deaths. The article on Criticism,
though a competent survey of the subject, overestimated J. A.
Symonds, whose work on the Renaissance I had just been reading with
proit and delight, and underestimated Pater, who was perhaps not
ethical enough for my frame of mind at that time. It was printed in
1885 in a magazine called <i>Time</i> and never reprinted; with the
papers on Hardy and Hinton I regarded it as belonging to my
'prentice period. After that date&mdash;I was then
twentyfive&mdash;my judgment, as well as my manner of writing,
became more mature; I no longer outgrew my opinions, though
naturally I might sometimes modify them. I was nevertheless still
firmly convinced that when one is young one is always liable to
outgrow one's work, and was determined that I, at all events, would
not fall into the error of neglecting this natural development and
putting forth in a permanent form work that I might subsequently
wish to disavow. I cannot remember at what age it was that I
resolved not to publish a book until I was thirty, but I was never
tempted to move from that resolution and never had occasion to
regret it. At the age of thirty I punctually published my first
book, <i>The New Spirit,</i> and followed it up in the same year by
my second and quite different book, <i>The Criminal,</i> thus
inaugurating my double public career at the same time. As I look
back it would seem that I planned my life from the outset largely
and spaciously, with the calm assumption that I should live long
enough to carry out my extensive plan at leisure. That confident
assumption has in the event been justified, and my chief life-work,
the Sex <i>Studies,</i> from its first dim inception to the
publication of its final volume, was spread over more than fifty
years. So I am glad I made that assumption; even though now, as I
re-write these lines after the age of seventy, I have the sad
experience of seeing my early friends, some of them younger than
myself, passing out of life before me.</p>

<p>My determination to go slowly was by no means an excuse for
laziness; if I was without haste I was also without rest. It was
not even prompted, as it might legitimately have been, by the
claims! of my medical education. I was full of active literary
schemes. The first on any considerable scale was conceived
suddenly, without premeditation, and put into execution with much
promptitude and complete success. I had long been interested in the
old English dramatists. On my way to and from school at Mitcham I
used often to buy one or another of the extensive series of old
plays then being published by Dick in small type at a penny each;
Marlowe as well, of course, as Shakespeare, I had long possessed
and loved. Of late I had been reading the other great Elizabethan
dramatists in the British Museum, especially Ford. But it was an
inconvenient way of reading them; it seemed to me that the best of
these plays ought to be made generally accessible, and in such a
way that the finest of all were not omitted for the sake of some
absurd prudery. I could not, for instance, have tolerated an
edition of Ford from which was excluded the master's chief play,
<i>'Tis Pity She's a Whore.</i> I would have a sound and true
edition of these great Elizabethans or none at all.</p>

<p>At that time (in 1886) it happened that a London publisher,
Henry Vizitelly, was conspicuous by the way in which he had
published fairly literal translations of the chief contemporary
French novelists. My friend Eleanor Marx Aveling had translated
<i>Madame Bovary</i> for him, and he had issued
translations&mdash;it is true by no means always literal&mdash;of a
large number of Zola's novels. He had himself been a distinguished
journalist in earlier days, he was familiar with France, and he was
really engaged on a quite honourable and useful work. It occurred
to me that a series of volumes of the best plays, unexpurgated, of
the Elizabethan dramatists&mdash;for which I devised at the
suggestion of Beaumont's poem the name "Mermaid Series"&mdash;would
be an excellent scheme for Vizitelly to undertake. I had no idea of
proposing myself for editor, and indeed could hardly feel competent
for the post. I wrote to Vizitelly putting the scheme before him,
and almost by return of post he replied accepting it, asking me to
undertake the work of general editor, and enquiring what
remuneration I would wish to receive. Such a proposal seemed too
tempting for a young unknown man to put aside, whatever his
disabilities, and even though he was in the midst of training for
an arduous profession. I accepted with alacrity, and speedily
repaired, so far as I could, my incompetence. I knew nothing as to
what fees a general editor was entitled to, and the sum I asked
(three guineas per volume) was, no doubt, too small. But though I
am fairly careful of money, I have never at any time worried over
money arrangements or gone out of my way to get good terms; I would
far rather receive little than haggle to obtain much.</p>

<p>Vizitelly was a capable, intelligent and honest man; I never had
reason to complain of him; he himself took an active and valuable
part in elaborating the details of production of the series, while
he left the whole literary organisation to me. I selected the
dramatists, the space to be devoted to each, and I chose the
editors, co-operating in their work, besides myself editing
Marlowe, Middleton, Ford and Porter. I enjoyed the task and cannot
recall that I ever found it toilsome. Nor have I ever felt any need
to be ashamed of my enterprise, in spite of an incident at the
outset which I suppose may be considered characteristic. In the
appendix to the Marlowe volume with which the series opened, I
printed for the first time in full from the original manuscript in
the British Museum, the scandalously blasphemous and immoral
charges brought against Marlowe by an informer shortly before his
death. I accepted the information as a crude and ignorant version
of what Marlowe really held, and I justified these acute and
audacious utterances as now "substantially held, more or less
widely, by students of science and of the Bible in our own days."
Many people were shocked, including even Swinburne and J. A.
Symonds, who were both taking part in my scheme, and they both
wrote to tell me of their disapproval, while Vizitelly, without
even consulting me, swiftly mutilated my appendix, so that only in
the early copies did it appear as I had sent it out.* At that time,
and for more than thirty years afterwards, the scurrilous
informer's statements were generally ignored or contemptuously
dismissed by students of Marlowe. Even to-day the reasonable view I
put forward is not openly accepted, and the latest editions of
Marlowe, so far as I have observed, avoid referring to my statement
or mentioning my name. Not that I wish to claim any credit, but I
am sorry Marlowe should so often fall into the hands of feeble folk
unworthy to approach his bright spirit. Even as I write now,
however, I am at length justified, and in <i>The Times Literary
Supplement</i> (June 2nd, 1921) is printed a newly discovered
document which confirms my opinion.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Swinburne wrote how happy he was to note the
suppression of "the horrible and disquieting passage in your
appendix, and I greatly regretted to find these monstrous
abominations made public."]</p>

<p>The Mermaid Series was at once well received, and much
appreciated both by scholars in English literature and by the
literary public. Yet in the midst of its career it was suddenly
taken out of my hands and brought to a lame conclusion. Vizitelly
was made the victim of a foolish prosecution for obscenity on the
ground of his Zola translations and sent to prison; and soon after
he died. His business was destroyed. The Mermaid Series was taken
over, without any consultation with me, by Fisher Unwin, a
successful publisher of that time. He removed my name from the
volumes, without any word of explanation or apology to me, or any
word of protest from me, though I do not flatter myself he knew
that my silence was contempt. I was well aware that for a publisher
the editor of a Series is an insignificant figure, even though he
may be altogether responsible for its conception, mainly
responsible for its production, and largely responsible for its
success. I had, of course, arranged for volumes ahead, many of them
nearly ready for publication; the editors of these were equally
disregarded by the new publisher and mostly accepted this treatment
with a better grace than it deserved.*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Fisher Unesin was a successful publisher
with wide relationships, and, whatever my opinion of his methods
might be, I had later to come into touch with him.]</p>

<p>The Mermaid Series swiftly passed away so far as I was
concerned, and languished to death after it was taken out of my
hands. But it was not superseded. I am pleased to be
assured&mdash;as I revise these lines some forty years later a
paper on "Havelock Ellis and the English Drama" comes to hand,
written by a devoted student of the drama, Montague
Summers&mdash;that "the Mermaid Series remains a magnificent
service rendered to the English Drama, a pioneer work, a work that
demanded courage, scholarship and enthusiasm."</p>

<p>It was, incidentally, a work that gained for me at least one
prolonged and memorable friendship. About the time I was organising
the Series I chanced to read one day at the Guildhall Library,
where I would go to see the current periodicals, an article in the
<i>National Review</i> on Mistral by a young unknown writer, one
Arthur Symons. I was so delighted with the fresh charm of its style
that on discovering later that the writer was then editing some
plays of Shakespeare I wrote to invite him to undertake Messinger
for the Mermaid Series. He accepted, a correspondence began, and
before long he proposed that on his next visit to London&mdash;he
was then living at home at Coventry, where his father was a
Wesleyan minister&mdash;we should meet at the National Gallery.
That was the first of many meetings, and of a long and close
friendship which was still continuing forty years later, though
contacts were becoming rare. So much for literature. In science I
was mostly content with the practical studies my medical course
compelled me to undertake, but I read many scientific books, though
at first fewer perhaps than in philosophy. I slowly became
interested in psychology; my first interest in anthropology had
dated from early in my Australian life, but it was not until 1889,
when I started the Contemporary Science Series, that I became a
Fellow of the Anthropological Institute (as I am to-day more than
forty years later) as well as of the Berlin similar society, and so
came into touch with the science and its leading exponents in
England, Galton and Beddoe and Haddon and Tylor, who were all great
pioneers.</p>

<p>I may here bring in the origin of the Science Series which
occupied me so largely during the twenty-five most active years of
my life. When in 1888 the Mermaid Series passed out of my hands, I
felt I had now grown experienced in editorial work and I conceived
the idea of replacing that series by another and more ambitious
series on lines really congenial with my own special work in life.
Perhaps, also, I had already begun to realise that literature, in
some form or another, was more likely to furnish me with bread and
butter than medicine, while at the same time journalism, the
easiest form of literature, fitted neither with my tastes nor with
my aptitudes. Editorial work, which demanded a wide outlook and
judgment, with the supervision of writing rather than a large
actual amount of writing, suited me, as I had already found, much
better than work so hasty, so superficial, and therefore, I was
inclined to feel, so immoral, as journalism.</p>

<p>It had sometimes occurred to me, with my growing interest in
science, that the old International Scientific Series, in which
once such memorable books appeared, had now reached its stage of
senility. A new series on more modern lines was needed, with more
attention to those sciences, and those aspects of science, which
were now coming to the front. I projected a series to be called the
Contemporary Science Series, and sent in my proposal, this time
definitely with myself as editor, to Gordon, Walter Scott's
manager, who, as I knew, regarded me favourably. When I look back I
am appalled at my audacity not only in planning so big a scheme
with my slender scientific equipment, but in putting it forth at
the moment when, it would seem, all my energies should be
concentrated on my approaching final examinations in medicine and
surgery. Yet, imprudent as it seems, I now know that I was taking
absolutely the right step and taking it at the right moment, while
my medical qualification was, nevertheless, obtained at the
appointed time a few months later.</p>

<p>My proposal was accepted as promptly and as readily as had been
my scheme for the Mermaid Series. Gordon informed me, indeed, that
this was exactly the kind of series he had been wishing to start,
but had not so far known where to find a suitable editor. Being
himself completely ignorant of science, he left me as free to
organise as I had been with the Mermaid Series. So all
preliminaries were soon arranged, the prospectus was printed, and I
set to work at once. Next year the first volume was published. It
was characteristic, as well as indicative of my main work in life,
that this book was <i>The Evolution of Sex,</i>by Professor Patrick
Geddes and J. Arthur Thomson, both of them since well known in the
world. To place such a subject at the forefront of the scheme
seemed daring to many people, but Gordon had made no objection,
while the book was well received and soon acquired high reputation
and many readers. It was at first planned to issue a new volume
every month, but such rapidity soon appeared impracticable with
scientific books. We went at a slower pace, but we went steadily
for twenty-five years until the Great War. The series was then
languishing and the War killed it. But during all the intervening
years it had been for me a main source of support, though it
involved much work, for scientific men are often poor writers and
incompetent proof-readers, while, sometimes, of course, my judgment
went astray in choosing my writers. In one form or another I had to
go through each volume several times, I usually made the index, and
several of the foreign volumes I wholly or in part translated. The
volume which had the largest sale, strangely enough, was a
translation, and of a most stolidly written book, Moll's
<i>Hypnotism,</i> hardly a subject which would now attract so large
an audience. Although there were nearly fifty volumes, I saw the
end of the series in 1915 without regret. By that date I was
independent of it; the reputation of my work was growing, and my
time was becoming too valuable to spend on the tedious routine of
editing.</p>

<p>I return to my student days. The only person of any scientific
accomplishment and genuinely scientific mind with whom I then came
into close and friendly contact, and that from shortly after I
entered the Medical School, was my fellow-student, John Barker
Smith. He entered at the same time as I did, but was more than ten
years older, and had already occupied himself much with natural
science, especially with advanced analytic chemistry (later he
became on original lines a recognised expert in several branches of
this, especially urinary analysis, in the problems of which he took
absorbing interest), winning numerous gold medals in these
departments and also being an enthusiastic field botanist. He had,
in addition, already published a manual of instruction in
pharmacology and various pamphlets, notably on new advances in
agricultural chemistry. (I am, even as I now write, carrying out a
suggestion he made to me of using Epsom Salts as a fertiliser for
fruit trees and with successful results.) He was thus, when he came
to St. Thomas's, already more than a mere student of medicine.
Since of me also&mdash;though in a different sense and though I had
as yet no achievement to my credit&mdash;much the same might be
said, it was doubtless natural that we should come together among
the crowd of comparatively raw students by whom we were surrounded.
Barker Smith was at the same time a man of sensitive and nervous
temperament, whence, before his medical training was completed, a
serious mental breakdown with paranoic symptoms, perhaps to be
connected with his birth, which was illegitimate, though both his
parents were sound and healthy. He possessed an even poetic
sensibility, though of essentially virile temperament, and a rare
originality of mind, so that though he might at times by some be
thought a bore, his speech was often marked by a memorable seal of
his own personality. He never, however, became an effective writer,
though he developed into an impressive speaker.</p>

<p>On innumerable little adventures in search of knowledge along
widely divergent paths Barker Smith was pleased to be my
sympathetic and intelligent companion, often ready to enter, even
more searchingly than I who had suggested the exploration, into the
subject before us. To-day, nearly forty years since we first met,
we remain excellent friends in spite of the breakdown early in his
career from which he never completely recovered, and in constant
touch with each other.*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* When I rewrite this page it is nearly fifty
years since our friendship began, and Barker Smith has been dead
for a year past. As he bade me farewell on his deathbed, a few days
before the end, he clasped my hand long and tenderly. Until a few
weeks before, his step remained brisk, his mind alert; he remained
a clever and appreciated medical practitioner. Two months earlier
he accompanied me on a visit of a few days to Ipswich&mdash;which
we had often visited before&mdash;to view the Gainsborough
Centenary Show, and his mental freshness to new impressions, as
well as his physical activity, had seemed unimpaired, though he
fell ill immediately afterwards. His affectionate sympathy and
emotional sensitiveness were combined with an acute intellect,
notwithstanding the eccentricity left over from the early mental
breakdown, and a masculine character. I lost in him a precious
friend, and with that loss many things have for me lost their
savour.]</p>

<p>It is possible that one reason why we have always found this
easy is that&mdash;though my explorations in the genealogical field
only began some ten years after my student-life was over&mdash;we
were of allied racial composition; Barker Smith by birth and
ancestry belonged to Castle Hedingham only a few miles away from
Sudbury in Suffolk, the town which, as I later found, was my chief
ancestral centre. It was Smith who discovered the altar tomb of the
Rev. William Powle in the churchyard of Great Waldingfield, whither
he had accompanied me in search of possible clues. After that
discovery we had many delightful expeditions and long walks
together in Suffolk and Essex, in search of our ancestral homes,
during many years.</p>

<p>The earlier adventures together of our student days were mainly
in London, to museums and lectures and the meetings of scientific
societies. There was, of course, the instructive museum of our own
School at St. Thomas's which we studied together; there was the
British Museum, especially the galleries devoted to the anthropoid
apes; roaming still farther afield from the paths of medicine,
there was the fascinating Geological Museum in Jermyn Street. There
were lectures, some by eminent physicians and surgeons, but also
others, and I recall the gracious figure of Dr. Anna Kingsford
(whose brother, Dr. Bonus, also a remarkable person in his way,
many years later became my friend), and it must have been in my
student days that I went, but this time alone, to some of the
series of lectures given in London by Renan, who spoke seated in a
chair, and I still vividly recall his large round luminous head set
loosely, as it seemed, in the socket of his great round unwieldy
body. Later there were International Congresses&mdash;but here
Smith never accompanied me&mdash;of medicine and of psychology in
London and other cities of Europe. Sometimes, too, my scientific
curiosity carried me, again with Smith as my companion&mdash;before
they had become popular&mdash;to the foreign restaurants of Soho,
whither most of my dearest friends in the world have later now and
then accompanied me, and here we would try strange dishes and
unfamiliar wines, usually cheap and unwholesome, for it was not
till afterwards that I gained a more extensive knowledge and a
finer taste in this difficult field. With Smith's aid, also, I made
some experiments in fabricating liqueurs.</p>

<p>We frequently went together to the Architectural Museum in
Westminster. It was conveniently near to the Hospital and to me
full of interest. Herewith I am leaving the field of science for
that of art, though my youthful instinct of curiosity scarcely made
any distinction of this kind. The earliest indication of my
interest in architecture I cannot definitely place, and I am not
sure that it was not first manifested in a disgust of the
architecture which at that period prevailed in London, with its
feeble construction and its profuse false ornamentation&mdash;the
London architecture of 1929 is often a realisation of my early
ideals&mdash;but I regard it as a native East Anglian trait and I
sometimes also please myself by imagining that it is a relic of my
ecclesiastical ancestry, my parson ancestors in the long course of
their parish duties having used up the interest in congregations,
leaving only a love for the empty structures. It was doubtless in
the Westminster Museum and with the aid of one or two textbooks
that I began to cultivate my taste in architecture, and I have
developed it in all my numerous excursions over Europe. It has been
to me an endless source of enjoyment, but while my tastes have not
been entirely ecclesiastical, it is no doubt the Gothic of France,
the Catalan of Spain, and the endless variety of English parish
churches which have been my chief sources of interest and delight.
The hours I have spent in churches have been among the happiest of
my life. I trust that the parsons who were my ancestors could have
said the same.</p>

<p>But, as was natural, I had first been attracted to pictures.
That began when I was a child, and, after the manner, I suppose, of
most children, I loved my paintbox, though I achieved little with
it; the peculiar penetrating impression of the colours of the
paints on a child's virginal sensitivity of retina, never to be
recaptured later, still remains in memory.</p>

<p>I took no pleasure, even in my earliest student days, in looking
at the contemporary Victorian pictures at the Academy, which I soon
ceased to visit; I have only been there once since, in forty years,
and then merely to see how a bust of myself was placed, next to
another man from Suffolk, Lord Kitchener.* But I zealously
frequented the Grafton Gallery where the Pre-Raphaelites ruled, for
they appealed to me, and especially Burne-Jones, ever since the
revelation that the Merlin and Vivien etching was to me when I came
across it in the Public Library at Sydney.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* I never came in touch with him, but a friend
once told me that, when he was glancing through her album of
autographs and quotations, he paused at my quotation (from my own
writings) and remarked: "That is what I like!" I do not mind
arousing a smile by the comment that I put this down to racial
affinity.]</p>

<p>The old masters I took every opportunity of seeing, sometimes in
the sale-rooms of Christie and Manson's, and always in the special
and delightful Winter Exhibitions of Old Masters at Burlington
House. I began the habit, I have not yet discontinued, of
preserving picture catalogues, sometimes annotating them, and of
carrying abroad notebooks to record my impressions of the pictures
and other objects that chiefly impressed me in foreign cities.
These notebooks briefly record some of the happiest hours of my
life.</p>

<p>Here, perhaps, I may mention the earliest of those independently
planned visits to Continental Europe which have given me so much
enjoyment and so wide a scope for my tastes in these directions. My
wanderings about the world formed a large part of my lifelong
education. I cannot imagine what I should have been without them.
So far as the European Continent is concerned, they began (for I
omit my visit to Antwerp in childhood) in 1881, while the latest
and perhaps the last&mdash;for I have at length lost my zest for
travel&mdash;was in 1925 with Arthur Symons to Paris and
Burgundy.</p>

<p>My sister Louie actively shared my attraction to pictures and
other forms of art, including some to which I gave little
attention, and after much discussion we agreed that we could pay a
visit to Belgium, at that time the country which young English
people usually first thought of visiting as the easiest, cheapest
and most interesting tour available (for Rossetti on whom that
first tour was so memorably influential it remained the last), and
we were to be accompanied by a friend of hers, Lottie Bugler. I had
been discussing the matter with Mackay, who had never been out of
England, and he also was inspired to arrange an exactly similar
party with his sister and a girl friend of hers; so the two little
parties went over, in more or less close association, by boat from
Harwich to Antwerp, the route I had traversed as a child with my
father. The Belgium of those days, half a century ago, was not the
Belgium of to-day. In its general aspect one might rather compare
it to the more remote provinces of Spain. Bruges was then really a
dead city, a fascinating dead city, more like the Segovia of to-day
than like the busy, enterprising, thickly populated and
tourist-haunted Bruges I saw on my latest visit. At Ghent, though
we were an unobtrusive little party, people came to their doors and
windows to gaze at us, and at the hotel we were amused to find that
the chambermaid had taken for granted that we would all three sleep
in the same room. At Bruges we put up, opposite the Belfry, at the
Panier d'Or, then a simple, quiet, cheap little place, and in
Antwerp at the Fleur d'Or, a charming little old-world inn situated
in a narrow street beneath the cathedral towers, whence all day
long and all night long the carillon above us floated down those
languid tunes which, however feeble as music, always impart to
Belgium for me a haunting fragrance. With these three cities and
Brussels our slender funds were exhausted. But the tour of less
than a fortnight had brought so much delight and revelation that I
returned home with eager desire for more such excursions in days to
come. During all my student years, however, my means were small and
my time fully occupied, so that I made only one other foreign
excursion, but that was to Paris, and the first of a long series I
have never counted. It was arranged with Mackay and took place in
1883. We stayed at a quiet hotel just off the Boulevard des
Italiens. It was a visit that should have been memorable since it
brought the new vision of numberless things of beauty and wonder
which grew familiar during the half century which has passed since.
Yet my first impressions seem vague, much more so than those of
Belgium, and as I had not yet begun to carry about the notebooks
which usually accompanied me in later expeditions I am unable to
say what these first impressions were. I best recall the dreary and
comfortless passage en the deck of the night boat to Dieppe, and my
awkwardness in having to adjust myself to Parisian ways. On the
return journey we stopped at Rouen for a day or two. On leaving
Rouen we missed the evening boat-train through not understanding
the French custom of announcing train departures, and it seemed we
should have to wait I know not how long for the next boat. Mackay
fell into a state of wild exasperation and raged at random. I was
unmoved, took up the Baedeker, and decided it would be a splendid
opportunity to spend a day at Dieppe. At once, and instinctively, I
sought to turn our bad fortune into good fortune, and it seems to
me now a characteristic impulse. Again and again throughout life,
in the largest matters as in small matters, I have built my success
on a foundation of failure. I do not protest, I accept, but I
create afresh. We proceeded at once to Dieppe, put up at the old
Hôtel de la Poste (I recall the long table d'hôte), opposite the
interesting old church, and the day spent there remains the
clearest and pleasantest memory of the whole expedition. It was not
until 1890, when I had obtained my medical qualification, that my
longest visit to Paris, the most fruitful and memorable, took place
in company with Arthur Symons and, for a part of the time, my
sister Louie.</p>

<p>The theatre took, and has always taken, a place in my thoughts
far below the arts of design. Louie, who was much more attached to
the theatre, as later was my wife, usually accompanied me at this
time when I went to see a play. Henry Irving and Ellen Terry, then
indeed the most brilliant figures on the stage, appealed to us
most, and that chiefly in Shakespeare: <i>Hamlet</i> and <i>The
Merchant of Venice</i> remain in my mind associated with the
figures of these two players; the tall, slender, gracious,
dignified Ellen Terry seems to me naturally Portia, and the
nervous, high-strung, distraught Irving naturally Hamlet. I went to
see great dramatic artists whenever they came my way: Salvini as
Othello, and later Duse on many of her visits. Sarah Bernhardt I
must have seen first soon after I went to St. Thomas's, though even
before I ever saw her the dramatic critics said she had lost her
golden voice of earlier years. (Yet to-day, forty years afterwards,
she is still on the stage.) Whether it was because she had already
passed her prime, or more probably through not being congenial with
my own sensibilities, she made no deep impression on me; Arthur
Symons found her adorable, but I was far from that point, even at
the first, and still further in later years, when I saw her again
and again in London and in Paris. Ristori and Duse both appealed to
me as greater; and even dramatic artists of much smaller reputation
have given me more satisfaction and more pleasure, especially in
France, for the art of the stage seems to me to be above all the
art of France. The music-hall is a more genuinely English
institution, and on this matter I was more at one with Symons
though this also belongs to a rather later period.</p>

<p>It was music rather than the theatre that drew me, and in old
age I can still say the same. As a boy, I have said already, to be
able to play, however badly, the sonatas of Beethoven had been to
me an invaluable mode of emotional expression, though, after I
reached Grafton, where music was at hand, I do not think I ever
touched the piano again. Now that I was a student in London I had
opportunities of hearing the best programmes and the best
orchestras available. My first step was to subscribe to the Crystal
Palace Saturday Concerts, where Manns, with the willing help of Sir
George Grove, was then giving concerts of a quality which can
scarcely be equalled even now. (I heard there, for instance, the
whole series of Schubert's symphonies which I have never had an
opportunity of hearing since.) So every Saturday, when my morning's
work at the Hospital was done, I set off for the Crystal Palace,
walking down the hill to my home at Anerley afterwards. Olive
Schreiner, lonely and unhappy, was then (1881) for a short term
living close by the Palace, and also coming to these Concerts,
though that, had I known it, would at the time have meant nothing
to me. And then, a little later, another little woman, who was one
day to become my wife, was also living close by and still unknown,
eagerly absorbing knowledge and ideas at the Palace School of
Science and Art, and even herself already giving lectures
there.</p>

<p>Here I touch the most intimately personal side of my life. To
complete the outline of my multifarious activities of spirit during
the seven years of my medical studentship&mdash;though the outline
will not even then be really complete, as I shall show
later&mdash;I must describe this intimate side.</p>

<p>When I entered St. Thomas's Hospital I was a fully developed
young man, five feet ten and a half inches in height and weighing
almost as much as I ever weighed. After middle age my weight tended
to decline, especially after 1916, the year of my wife's death, and
oscillated around 150 pounds. I was in good health, at my best,
thanks to the four years I had spent in Australia. The attacks of
what I regard as a kind of periodic appendicitis, after lasting for
six or seven years, had ceased entirely in 1879, the time when I
went to Grafton and entered on the healthiest period of my life. My
digestion was probably in a more satisfactory condition than at any
time of my life. The sore throats and colds generated at Islington
Hall remained a frequent worry in London, though not when away by
the sea, and during the years of the Great War, when for the first
time after a long period I spent the winter in London, a bronchitic
tendency developed, though this disappeared when I ceased to winter
in London. My teeth, which I had strangely neglected in Australia,
I grew careful over when I became a medical student. (It was at the
age of forty that I had to resort to artificial teeth and at about
the same age to eye-glasses.) At the coming of manhood, I had begun
to shave, but I quickly dropped that practice for the simpler plan
of allowing my beard to grow. I took to parting my hair in the
middle, as it was too thick to lie well when parted at the side,
though with the approach of old age I returned to the more usual
custom. The chief trouble of health I recall in early student days
was a slight tendency to nervous excitability, associated with my
mental activity at this period, but that, on a physician's advice,
was sufficiently subdued by a simple tonic of nux vomica which
often later proved useful. At first I found my head tending to
become especially active in the evening, and I would at that time
begin writing down the ideas seething in my brain. The result was
that I could not sleep. I find that in November, 1884, I was
complaining of singing in the ears. I obtained a mixture of bromide
and chloral. But I speedily abandoned its use. I realised that it
was foolish to allow my mind to work too actively in the evening. I
made it a rule never to occupy myself in the evening with any
mental work which might excite my brain. To that rule I have
adhered ever since, and the result has been that, except under the
stress of some circumstance for which I was not responsible, I have
never suffered from real sleeplessness; I go to bed early and I get
up early. I have never had any faith in night-work, for it seems to
me that out in the open air&mdash;where most often my work since
marriage has been done&mdash;is the only right and wholesome place
for mental work, and now in later years it is only in the morning
that I care to work, or can work well, though I have never, as my
wife liked to do, begun work at four in bed. Early breakfast and
then out in the open&mdash;that has been my ideal and so far as
possible my practice, and I hope that others may feel, as I do, the
breath of free air over all my work. Whether out of doors or in, I
have never cared to crouch over a desk to write; I always lean or
lie back, whether on a hillside or a couch, and that may be the
reason why I have remained erect and never acquired a bent or
stooping aspect, to the surprise, I am told, of some who met me and
remarked that I failed to present the typical aspect of a literary
man.</p>

<p>Mental excitement and sleeplessness and bromide might suggest
sexual excitability. But in that form&mdash;for there is more to
say on the wider question&mdash;sex seems little to have troubled
me. The only form of auto-erotism which I had up till then
experienced&mdash;for a little later, when a dear friend told me
that she had done so at times from the age of eighteen, I was
tempted to experiment with the more active form&mdash;was in sleep,
for the most part dreamless sleep, beginning, as I have told, at
school at Mitcham and continuing at frequent intervals with no
pronounced change but a general diminution. I kept a record of the
phenomena, and summarised them, as those of W.K., in the first
volume of my <i>Studies.</i> For though I would never have
attempted to put into my books any "case" or "history" of myself,
to record a mere series of measurable data seemed to me entirely
legitimate. If I had written my own "history" it would doubtless
have been a surprise, to those who could have recognised it, to
find how small my experience was and how temperate my estimate of
the sexual act. I am regarded as an authority on sex, a fact which
has sometimes amused one or two (though not all) of my more
intimate women friends. But, after all, it is the spectator who
sees most of the game, and it remains true that any experience of
sex has been, at all events, ample enough to help me to attain a
great experience of love. And it must be a hard task for the sexual
athlete to become a great lover. Certainly, erotic thoughts
sometimes played, even insistently, in my waking mind, but even in
the solitude of Sparkes Creek there had, I think, only once been an
occasion (it is truly narrated in <i>Kanga Creek)</i> when such an
impulse, still remaining emotional rather than sensual, was
fiercely urgent; and now in London my mind was usually too full of
work and of manifold intellectual adventures in every direction for
such volcanic eruptions. Yet undoubtedly there were fairly frequent
periods of voluptuous revery with prolonged unrelieved erethism,
which I now regard as unwholesome, if not enfeebling in their
after-effects on my sexual life. Now that I am no longer young, I
know sweet and lovely women for whom it would be a joy for me to do
what I would with them. If I had known one of them in adolescence,
I have sometimes thought, perhaps erroneously, the benefit might
have been incalculable.</p>

<p>As for any cheap satisfaction of desire, I had no occasion to
consider it, for no impulse in such a direction ever entered my
head. If I were a little more easily sociable I should no doubt
have taken opportunities now and then of talking with girls of the
street over a drink, as some of my serious fellow-students were
wont to do without going farther. That would have interested me.
There was, however, only one occasion at this time when I talked to
a prostitute about her life. I was going home after my day's work
at the hospital when near London Bridge Station a woman at a street
corner accosted me. She was not attractive, scarcely young, and I
had no wish to have anything to do with her. But I asked her
questions about herself and she answered with simplicity and
evident truthfulness. As we walked together talking, she led me,
without my being aware of what she was doing, down a deserted
sideturning. Then, thinking she knew what I desired, she placed her
hand on my trousers at the point with which she was professionally
concerned. I instinctively started back, realised the situation,
and turned towards the main road, while she gently and soothingly
apologised.* Then I gave her a shilling and went on my way towards
the station, as I did so passing a policeman posted under the
railway arch who stepped meaningly a yard or two towards me, as
much as to say that he knew what I had been up to. I am sure that
nothing could have persuaded him that he was mistaken, and that he
could in all honesty have testified against me in a police court,
for the mentality of the police is not always that of the public.
The incident has more than once come back to my mind when I have
read in the newspapers of men of position haled before a magistrate
on a charge of public indecency. I took no notice whatever of the
policeman. But I had secured, not only an interesting little
history, but a valuable experience, and I never placed myself in
such a situation again.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Not so very much later a woman I loved once
touched me, as we were walking along a country lane together, in
what was, physically, exactly the same way. I often thought
afterwards how well this illustrated the fact that two things may
seem the same thing, and yet be a whole universe apart.]</p>

<p>Much of what I have been saying refers to the whole period of my
studentship. But now I must start afresh in the year 1883. At that
time, although at the most arduous period of my medical work, I
seem to have had no compunction in continuing to subscribe to the
best general lending library available and constantly taking out
large serious works as well as novels and the chief current
reviews. It thus came about that I read in the <i>Fortnightly</i>
an article on recent novels by a clever young journalist of most
versatile accomplishments, then lately come back to England from an
American University, and in later years prominent for a time in
business and politics as Sir Henry Norman, Bart.*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* I lost touch with him, and long after (in
June 1939) he died at the age of 80.]</p>

<p>In this article an attractive account by Ralph Iron was given of
a new novel, <i>The Story of an African Farm,</i> which no doubt I
had heard of already, but certainly here first saw described as the
kind of book which I must read. I proceeded to take the book out of
the library and duly read it. <i>The African Farm</i> was not to
me, then or ever, what it seems to have been to many, a revelation,
a new gospel; nor was I able to accept it at all points either as
fine art or as sound doctrine. I had followed my own path both in
art and in religion. When, a little later, I wrote of <i>The
African Farm,</i> together with some other books, in the <i>Indian
Review,</i> Olive Schreiner disliked my account of her book. She
said it reminded her of a man in South Africa with a horse for
sale, who, after admitting a long list of appalling defects in the
animal&mdash;and these she enumerated in her vigorous racy
way&mdash;wound up by declaring emphatically: "But it's a damned
fine horse!" I accepted the description of my method of criticism,
and with equanimity all Olive's subsequent teasing about my "damned
fine horse." It seems to me that a critic who is not keenly aware
of all the defects of a lovely thing that ravishes him is but a
crude critic, whose opinion hardly counts. My attitude is the same
even in love. The women whom I have loved, and almost worshipped,
are women of whose defects I have been precisely and poignantly
aware. The lover who is not thus aware seems to me a crude sort of
lover, scarcely even a lover at ail, merely the victim of a
delusion, of which to rob him would be to rob him of his "love." I
feel contempt for the "love" that is blind; to me there is no love
without clear vision, and perhaps, also, no vision in the absence
of love.</p>

<p>What delighted me in <i>The African Farm</i> was, in part, the
touch of genius, the freshness of its outlook, the firm splendour
of its style, the penetration of its insight into the core of
things; in part, my own personal sympathy with the mental evolution
described, all the more since it had taken place, as largely had my
own, in the solitude of a remote southern land. I resolved to write
to the author. To this I was moved&mdash;though my letter contained
many criticisms&mdash;partly by my admiration and sympathy, partly
also because it seemed to me that the book had attracted almost no
attention and that its fine quality had remained unappreciated.
That was no doubt true so far as public expression was concerned,
though, as in England will often happen when a book is so
unconventional and heterodox that people are shy of speaking of it
openly, more attention than I knew had privately been given to
<i>The African Farm.</i></p>

<p>This impulse of kindness, I may note&mdash;an impulse as natural
as any other, as natural as the sexual impulse&mdash;has more than
once furnished the occasion to bring me near to the women I have
been destined to know intimately. A little act of kindly sympathy
has come back to me eventually as a precious gift of love to enrich
my whole life. I could say&mdash;without denying that to convert a
natural impulse into a policy would be to stultify it&mdash;that
the road of unselfishness may be the surest way to the ends of
selfishness. My life&mdash;I cannot too often repeat&mdash;has been
full of miracles, and it may well be, I see now, that the wand
which effected some, though by no means all of them, was wielded by
my own hands.</p>

<p>After an interval the reply came in what I afterwards knew to be
her best and neatest hand, for she most often used, even when
writing to important persons, a hasty and careless scrawl, sent off
without being read, though when she was writing a book she found it
as hard as Flaubert to please herself.</p>

<p class="quote">St. Leonards-on-Sea, 25th February, 1884.<br>
<br>
My dear Sir, on my return from a visit to London I found your
letter which my publisher had forwarded here. Had I received it
sooner I should earlier have written to tell you of the pleasure
your expression of sympathy with the little book <i>An African
Farm</i> gave me. Thank you for having written.*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* The rest of the letter is printed in <i>The
Letters of Olive Schreiner,</i> Ch. II.]</p>

<p>So began what was, if not the longest, the largest
correspondence of my life, and it continued, with scarcely a break,
for thirty-six years. That first letter clearly opened the way to
further correspondence, and two months later, when she came to
London in May, a meeting naturally followed. She evidently expected
much from that meeting. She told me some time later that, at first
actually seeing me, her disappointment was so acute that on going
into her bedroom to put on her hat&mdash;for she was to accompany
me to one of the Progressive Association meetings&mdash;she burst
into tears. On my side there was neither depression nor exaltation.
But I still recall the first vision of her in the little
sitting-room of the South Kensington lodging-house: the short
sturdy vigorous body in loose shapeless clothes, sitting on the
couch, with hands spread on thighs, and, above, the beautiful head
with the large dark eyes, at once so expressive and so
observant.</p>

<p>The disappointment must have been transient, for a few days
later she wrote to say how glad she would be, and what a help it
would be to her, if I would come again. Indeed, from that first
day, though without any immediate obvious ardour on either side,
there seems to have been an instinctive movement of approach on
both sides. Before the month was out she had settled in Fitzroy
Street, close to where her chief friend at that time, Eleanor Marx
(Karl Marx's daughter), was living with Dr. Aveling, and, by one of
those coincidences of which my life has been full, that street
chances to be near to Doughty Street, where a few years later my
future wife was living when first I learnt to know her. I had
already come in touch with Eleanor Marx through the Progressive
Association and was soon to know her better; she was just then only
beginning to form her fatal relationship with Edward Aveling, and
full of radiant physical and intellectual vigour. Olive and I were
soon meeting frequently and going about together to meetings and
other places of interest. At one of the first Progressive
Association Meetings we attended I was able to introduce her in
person to Henry Norman, who had by his <i>Fortnightly</i> article
virtually introduced her to me. By the time she left London, little
over a month after our first meeting, Olive and I were on terms of
friendship so close that she could write of me as "the person who
is like part of me." We had found ourselves akin in all sorts of
essential matters, with common interests and ideals in the social
as well as the intellectual aspects of life, and each was at many
points able to initiate the other. She, indeed, was four years
older and had had deeper experience of life than I had. But in
general she had lived much in solitude and isolation, finding out
things for herself in an uncongenial South African environment, so
that there were all sorts of things she was eager to know and
understand which I could introduce to her or help to explain.
Moreover, she had never possessed a friend able to combine personal
devotion and helpfulness in practical matters with a wide
sympathetic comprehension in deeper matters based on many
experiences in common. It meant much to her. She loved in those
early days to call me her "other self."</p>

<p>She meant even more to me. She was in some respects the most
wonderful woman of her time, as well as its chief womanartist in
language, and that such a woman should be the first woman in the
world I was to know by intimate revelation was an overwhelming
fact. It might well have disturbed my mental balance, and for a
while I was almost intoxicated by the experience.</p>

<p>But I have always been of temperament not easily or completely
aroused, not merely that it takes me long to act on my impulses
after they are formed but that they have been slow to form. So it
has scarcely ever happened to me, either in early or later life, to
be repulsed by a woman, not because I have found women unduly
yielding or unduly impetuous&mdash;I have known women of widely
varying temperaments&mdash;but because I have myself so often,
though with pronounced exceptions, been excessively slow. So at
least it certainly was on this first occasion.</p>

<p>I missed no opportunity of writing to her and seeing her; she
must already have largely filled my thoughts; but I had no impulse
to make any advances. It was a decisive moment of complete trust,
almost unique in her life, when at Fitzroy Street, one clay in
June, she suddenly confided to me the exact cause of the great
emotional crisis from which at that time she was slowly recovering,
I without doubt being a main factor in that recovery. Memory often
links great things with small things: what I vividly recall is that
she had just filled my plate with my favourite dish of strawberries
and cream and that it remained untouched. It was about the same
time that as I left her one evening to return home she raised her
face up to me as we shook hands. I hesitated to realise the
significance of the gesture, and we parted. But on my next visit,
when the moment to part arrived, the gesture was more significantly
repeated: she put her arms round me and from that moment our
relationship became one of intimate and affectionate friendship. I
hasten to add that it scarcely passed beyond that stage.</p>

<p>It is necessary to be precise. She possessed a powerfully and
physically passionate temperament which craved an answering impulse
and might even under other circumstances&mdash;for of this I could
have no personal experience&mdash;be capable of carrying her beyond
the creed of right and wrong which she herself fiercely held and
preached; while, as she once remarked, if I were ever to do a bad
action it would be really bad because it would be deliberate. For a
brief period at this early stage of our relationship there passed
before her the possibility of a relationship with me such as her
own temperament demanded. But she swiftly realised that I was not
fitted to play the part in such a relationship which her elementary
primitive nature craved. I on my side recognised that she realised
this and knew that the thought of marriage between us, which for
one brief instant floated before my eyes, must be put aside. I have
had no reason to regret that inevitable conclusion. We were not
what can be technically, or even ordinarily, called lovers. But the
relationship of affectionate friendship which was really
established meant more for both of us, and was really even more
intimate, than is often the relationship between those who
technically and ordinarily are lovers. It is not surprising that
some among our friends assumed that we were engaged. At the end of
June Olive left London for the country, and a few weeks later she
went to a small cottage at Bole Hill, in Derbyshire, below Matlock,
drawn there by Eleanor Marx, who was staying a few miles away with
Aveling. After she left London we remained in daily correspondence,
and in August I joined her fora week or so at Bole Hill, staying in
the same cottage. Our relationship continued on this level during
the years that followed. We wrote to each other almost daily; we
met whenever it was conveniently possible, either in London or in
the country, but not outside England, except in 1888 when I went
across to spend a week with her in Paris, whither she was returning
from Alassio.</p>

<p>If I think of that time&mdash;the later years of my student life
when through my varied external activities the thoughts of my heart
were so close to Olive&mdash;all sorts of pictures come to mind,
standing out vividly from a dim background. I see us, for instance,
returning at midnight from the Lyceum Theatre where we had been for
some Shakespearean performance of Henry Irving and Ellen Terry,
walking joyously, hand in hand, along the Strand, oblivious of the
world; I see us again, walking in the country, with Eleanor Marx
and Aveling, when Olive fora moment dropped behind those two to put
her arm caressingly round me and Aveling cast a sharp glance back;
I see her on yet another walk when for some reason I was unwilling
to go along the road she preferred, and she softly sang to herself:
"I have a donkey and he won't go;" I see her coming suddenly and
quite naked out of the bathroom in the house where she was staying
into the sitting-room where I was waiting for her, to expound to me
at once some idea which had just occurred to her, apparently
unconscious of all else; I see her, on leaving rooms where she had
been lodging, presented at the last moment with an
extravagantly-priced laundry bill, and she began to read out in
wrathful tones the items of underlines, for her vivid comic sense
sometimes deserted her when carried away by strong feeling,
especially of injustice; I see her similarly in the upper floor of
the Louvre where the bronze vessels are displayed, talking to me
with grave earnestness of the handicaps by which women are impeded
in life: "A woman," she said solemnly, "is a ship with two holes in
her bottom," at which I irreverently laughed and she smiled, and we
probably stopped to look at the bronzes; again I see her at her
rooms at Hastings where I had come to spend the weekend with her,
bringing at her desire my student's microscope, for she wished to
observe living spermatozoa, which there was no trouble in obtaining
to place under the cover glass for her inspection, and I see her
interest in their vigorous motility. The pictures are endless that
I hold in memory&mdash;glad or comic or poignant
pictures&mdash;until 1889 when she returned to South Africa for a
stay, only once broken and that in its earliest period, of
twenty-five years during which we corresponded faithfully at about
weekly intervals, neither my marriage nor hers, which shortly
followed mine, making any difference in our relationship, beyond
that inevitably due to distance, neither my wife nor her husband in
the slightest degree disturbing its harmony.</p>

<p>The record of the relationship was contained in her letters,
which, until she returned to South Africa in 1889, constituted a
continuous diary, day by day, though after that only at longer
intervals, until her death in 1920, so that they amounted in number
to several thousands, all of which (except a few she had asked me
to destroy immediately) I carefully preserved, arranged in bundles
and duly numbered. But in 1917 she conceived the idea that her
friends should destroy or return all the letters she had ever
written to them. With this request, which gave me much pain, I at
first refused to comply. I valued those letters. I felt, as James
Martineau felt when his sister Harriet made a similar request, that
I preferred the certain benefits of the past to the uncertain
benefits of the future. I was able to assure her that her letters
would not leave my hands and that I had arranged for their disposal
at my death, while they could not in any case be legally published
without her permission or that of her representatives. She still
insisted, even with tears. It was the only quarrel we had ever had.
In the end I burnt a vast number, belonging to the later period,
which, for I do not know what reason, she chiefly wanted destroyed,
but painfully, feeling I was guilty of a sacrilege, and for nearly
a year we ceased to see each other or to write. Then she resumed
writing, without referring to the real cause of the interruption,
and we met and wrote as if no breach had occurred. She never again
referred to the letters.</p>

<p>But a vast quantity of these letters still remained, including
most of those belonging to the early years when we were in closest
relationship. In 1923, when it had been planned to publish a volume
of her letters, edited by her husband, as a necessary complement to
the <i>Life,</i> it became clear that such a volume could only be
constituted by relying on the correspondence in my hands. I
therefore went through all the letters that remained, copying those
passages which to me seemed suitable for publication and likely to
be of interest as illustrating her life, character, and opinions. I
omitted, on the one hand, all that was certainly too intimate for
publication, and, on the other, all that was too trivial or of too
passing reference to be any longer of interest to anyone. The
extracts thus made (and not the original letters themselves) I
submitted to Cronwright Schreiner for his editorial supervision,
and he made a number of small omissions of passages which it seemed
to him undesirable to publish. Even the siftings thus finally
obtained, though but a fraction of the original correspondence,
constitute the largest part of the volume of <i>Letters of Olive
Schreiner,</i> 1876-1920, as published in 1925. Some of Olive's
friends, I know, feel that she would never herself have agreed to
the publication of these personal letters. I am not prepared to
deny this. But neither am I prepared to regret my decision. The
possibility of the future publication of a portion of the
correspondence was always present to my mind. It seems to me that
the writer who is no longer among the hying, and whose
sensitiveness can no longer be hurt, is not the fit arbiter of what
should or should not be published. That arbitration best rests with
those who love and reverence the dead writer and who recognise that
the dead can feel no modesty and no reserve however much we may
respect those sensibilities in the hying. That is the rule I would
observe with others, and the rule I am willing to submit to
myself.</p>

<p>Nearly all the original letters, at the suggestion of Olive's
husband, have now been destroyed. A certain proportion I still
preserve and cherish. My letters to her during the early years she
carefully treasured; she once told Arthur Symons (rather to his
surprise and indeed to mine) that I was the best letter-writer she
knew; she fastened them together with thread sometimes, making a
number of little booklets. When she went to South Africa in 1889
she sent them back to me to take care of for her; she never asked
for them again. When they arrived they were stuffed into a large
over-filled cardboard case; I never examined them; most of them
have at one time or another somehow been lost or accidentally
destoyed; only a few seem still to remain; it would not be easy to
arrange them in chronological order owing to my bad habit of not
dating intimate letters. What happened to the letters I wrote to
her during the following thirty years I do not know; I have not
seen or heard of a single one, except the last, which arrived after
her death and was returned to me unopened. I suppose she destroyed
them as received, or on her removal from place to place.</p>

<p>Now, thirty-three years after they were returned to me, I have
been looking through the few letters of mine that still remain,
mostly belonging, it is clear, to the years 1885 or 1886. But the
very earliest, when I still felt her to be almost a stranger, I
re-wrote and preserved the first rough drafts, which I still
possess. These were largely concerned with the comparison of our
early solitary lives in South Africa and Australia and our early
intellectual adventures in books. I also wrote of my current
literary interests, of Hardy or of Hinton. I quote from one of
these rough drafts, certainly of early March, 1884:</p>

<p class="quote">"I am sorry you find the world 'empty.' If one
finds a thing empty it seems to me, from my own experience, that
one hasn't been looking rightly, hasn't been asking that 'right
question' which is the 'half of knowledge.' To me, as I seem to
begin to know the world, it seems so full&mdash;so much to live and
care for. I went to New South Wales eight years ago and stayed
there four years. During that time I went through that experience
so many of us have to go through who find the error of the beliefs
we are brought up in, and which you have described in Waldo. During
part of that time I was quite alone among the hills, not at all
caring about the outside world, but alone with my own thoughts and
books and what, I suppose, one must call 'Communion with
Nature'&mdash;a very real thing indeed. I have never been able to
have that since. I can't get a solitude big enough, and even having
to go and look for it spoils it. But at least one
<i>knows</i>."</p>

<p>To return to the actual letters of late date: they are all
undated save by day of the week, but it seems clear that Olive had
preserved them in their chronological order. Very hastily scrawled,
in a large hand, and evidently not always read over before sending,
mostly very short, sometimes two or three in one day, few of them
seem of the slightest interest now. They are all full of affection,
sometimes of longing, always of tender solicitude. I may quote from
two or three which tell of moods and ideas I have almost or quite
forgotten; the date seems 1885:</p>

<p class="quote">"To-morrow is Olive's birthday! (sic) I feel
happy: I want to come and love her; is she happy too?...I like and
agree with that letter of Mrs. Walters'. One sentence especially I
feel with. I am sorry it is rare for women to feel such elementary
things. I should think they only want educating&mdash;that all
women must feel like that in their hearts. But if they don't, we'll
dig our claws into them, Lion, and torture them deliciously till
they do. It was funny that your gentle hesitating sentence, saying
that that was how you felt but you didn't know if it was right or
wrong (as if there could be any doubt!) made me feel just as I used
to feel years ago. I used to get into such fierce rages all by
myself. I was amused this evening, after your letter came, when I
found myself rolling about on the bed and grinding my teeth,
because always now I feel so very cocksure, so that the opposition
of all the world seems a very little thing, a thing I can well
afford to be magnanimous about. But I have the other feeling
underneath still, and I wouldn't have the least objection to being
martyred...I sent you my old Shelley. I thought you might perhaps
like to have it because it is almost the most precious book I have;
it is like a piece of myself. It was to me, to a considerable
extent, like both what Emerson and Goethe were to you. It was
always near to me the whole time I was in Australia. (But I didn't
read it much when I was at Sparkes Creek.) The only time I read it
in England was that week I spent at Weymouth the day or two before
you came to England. When I was at Carcoar and felt so miserable
sometimes because the world seemed so strange and empty, and used
to think I would throw myself from the cliffs at Sydney, I always
used to fancy that that Shelley would have to come with me. I've
got the very best edition of Shelley now, but I don't <i>love</i>
it at all. You must keep it and love it a little bit though it is
so old and ugly. [She soon lost it.] I think I'm writing more than
usual&mdash;it's because it's her birthday! I mean to look forward
now to coming to see you, and to be at Pevensey if we can find a
nice, cheap place, but we must be very economical. Pevensey is
country, isn't it? and it is nearly spring. Now I am going to bed
and to think about my Olive in bed. Good night, Sweetheart."</p>

<p class="footnote">[* This refers to an incident at Hastings.]</p>

<p>The next letter refers to the time (about 1881) when we each
used to go to the Crystal Palace Saturday Concerts:</p>

<p class="quote">"I am going to the last Crystal Palace Concert
this afternoon with Louie and Laura [my sisters], according to an
old promise. I think it will make me rather sad. Do you know that
the very last concert I went to at the Crystal Palace was that one
nearly three years ago, when we both went and heard the Choral
Symphony and it did us good? I wanted so much that we should go
again; and be <i>together</i>...I feel so tenderly and lovingly of
all this time that I was with you, more than ever before, I think.
Louie sends her love."</p>

<p>Next day:</p>

<p class="quote">"We went to the concert. It was very good. I kept
feeling as if you were there somewhere. They had my favourite
Unfinished Symphony of Schubert (that I had a sonnet about in
<i>Academy)</i> and part of Wagner's <i>Parsifal</i>&mdash;the part
the Philistines object to so strongly because it is a kind of ideal
representation of the Sacrament. I liked it. Before Louie and Laura
came I found your favourite statue&mdash;the Death with the
outstretched wings and bent covered head. I understand how you felt
about it...I've just finished writing out that little Australian
chapter and am sending it. I feel that it is intensely
uninteresting, but it is a necessary introduction to my idyll
<i>[Kanga Creek]</i>. If I ever get to the end I will revise and
shorten it. Send it back. I meant whatever charm it had to He in
the harmony between a certain emotional relationship and a certain
aspect of Nature, but I see the Nature part will become little more
than background and whatever interest it has be chiefly
psychological. The young schoolmaster is like I was, but only a
part of me, like Waldo of you. As I now send this chapter it is
scarcely at all revised and the style is often very bad&mdash;I
find it so difficult to give names that satisfy me to people and
places. I've just read Roden Noel's <i>Thalassa</i> again to see if
your impression that it was crowded with similes was right or mine
that it wasn't. I find there are only <i>three</i> or at most four
similes, not one of them applied to the sea. The fault of the poem
is a bewildering profusion of metaphors. His poems are best when he
reads them himself; he reads splendidly; get him to when you see
him again. I hope the landlady has got back to her normal state of
mind now that I've gone."</p>

<p>(This letter was evidently written soon after a visit to
Hastings in April, 1885.) And in the letter of the following
day:</p>

<p class="quote">"It is such a wonderfully sweet letter that came
just now. I haven't been sad, my darling, since I came home. I am
quite passive, not restless. It was only the half hour at Croydon
that I was so miserable; and that wasn't any personal pain that
you, or anyone, could have taken away, but just everything&mdash;my
life and your life and everything...Yau were like Psyche who
brought her lamp and looked at her Cupid when he was asleep. But he
never came again.* Your Soul's wife must have that letter in bed
close to her tonight. It is so sweet. Good night, you darling!"</p>

<p class="footnote">[* This refers to an incident at Hastings.]</p>

<p>Next morning:</p>

<p class="quote">"How is that throat? I thought it was getting
well. Of course I did not think you a coward about it I think Roden
Noel only writes like that because he wants to see you a good deal.
Didn't you say he used to call every day? Get strong, my sweet
Lion."</p>

<p>Her reply is dated April 26th, 1885, and in it she writes:</p>

<p class="quote">"You oughtn't to have been sad then at Croydon.
You were so sweet and loving to me and made such little things so
beautiful by being so loving about them."</p>

<p>And in a second letter later the same day:</p>

<p class="quote">"Just going to bed, my darling, my darling, you
aren't going to be sad to-night, are you? I want to comfort you.
Oh, if there were nothing to divide us! If we might be all in all
to each other! If it were possible for one human being to make
another human being <i>quite, quite, quite</i> happy! Then you
would always be so happy."</p>

<p>And next day she wrote:</p>

<p class="quote">"My Soul's wife, what are you doing tonight? Was
the concert nice yesterday? All day I have lain still, feeling
spent, but this morning I worked a little. I am going to bed now.
You looked so sweet on Thursday night, so beautiful. Don't you
think you're getting more beautiful than you need to be?"</p>

<p>All these actions and reactions of emotion in youth, they seem
foolish from afar, but they spring from the depth and they leave an
impress which only death can efface.</p>

<p>Though in the published volume of Olive's <i>Letters</i> so many
extracts from those to me are given, I may perhaps now give a few
further fragments from letters, early and late, having a more
intimately personal reference to myself. Even before the end of
1884 we were living in an atmosphere of familiar nearness, and in
November of that year, when ill in bed, she wrote:</p>

<p class="quote">"I am not sure as to where you begin and I
end."</p>

<p>A little later, when she had been reading my Australian diary in
which I had put down that perhaps someone some day would read it,
and understand it, and love me (Olive is still, more than half a
century after it was written, the only person who has read it), she
writes:</p>

<p class="quote">"And then I was Hying just like you on a lonely
farm, and at night when my work was over going out to walk under
the willow trees or on the dam walls and I used to think 'One day I
<i>must</i> find him.'"</p>

<p>And again, after reading some of my early sonnets:</p>

<p class="quote">"I think it is the peculiarity of yourself and of
all that belongs to you, that you unfold on acquaintance; it
unfolds; voice, manner, everything unfolds, and shows more than one
ever thought of. You are a kind of sweet surprise. Take great care
of the sonnets. All I have seen ought to be published [forty years
later they appeared as a volume], except 'Life and Love.' That
isn't like you and has not the strength which nothing else of you
lacks, the strength shewn most in your critical power and in your
tenderness. I think you are strongest where you are tenderest."</p>

<p>A year later we had grown very close to each other. On the June
19th, 1885, she wrote:</p>

<p class="quote">"My Havelock, I want you, I <i>need you.</i> In
some ways I need you more than ever before. You are my family to me
and fill up that deep part of my heart that if it were empty would
make life all sad. Only what saddens me is that I feel as if you
wanted what it's not in my power to give anyone now, something so
much less precious than what I give you. If I were in your place I
should feel just as you do. But I shouldn't be so sweet and
glorious as you are."</p>

<p>And three days later:</p>

<p class="quote">"My darling, darling comrade, what would I do
without you?"</p>

<p>Yet again three days afterwards:</p>

<p class="quote">"I feel so clingingly tender to you&mdash;the one
soul that meets mine and touches it. [George] Moore came after
Philip [Marston] and Mackenzie [later Lord Amulree] were gone. Oh,
Henry, how much closer you are to me than anyone!"</p>

<p>After a leap of four years and after much emotional turmoil in
which several men and women were mingled, when about to return to
South Africa, she still writes (September 3rd, 1889):</p>

<p class="quote">"Fancy, when I think of leaving England the thing
I mind most leaving is you. Isn't human affection a funny
thing!"</p>

<p>A year later she ends a letter about Dürer from her cottage in
Matjesfontein:</p>

<p class="quote">"I wish I could see you, my brother, my dear one,
who has loved me more truly and faithfully than anyone."</p>

<p>And in January, 1906, some fifteen years after we were both
married, she wrote from South Africa:</p>

<p class="quote">"I believe if I heard you were dangerously ill I
should start off to England at once, if I had to borrow the money
and knew I should likely die on the way."</p>

<h2><a name="ch6" id="ch6"></a>Chapter 6</h2>

<p>The seven years of my medical student life were so full of all
sorts of vivid and varied interests that it has not been possible
to co-ordinate them into a shaped narrative, and though I have
included them as I recalled them it may well be that I have missed
some altogether, just as I have certainly missed many little
incidents which had value and significance for me and were
sometimes also notable for their own sake. Yet I have probably said
enough to give a fair impression of my life during those formative
years. I may even have given the impression, which would not be
fair, that my medical studies proper were completely submerged by
these vivid and varied interests. The most that can be said on that
side was that my medical studies were rather unduly prolonged and
that my career as a student was not brilliant. I do not consider,
however, that it would under any circumstances have been that. But
I was a regular and orderly student, punctual in my attendance and
attentive to my duties when "clerk" and "dresser." Though my career
as a student was thus inconspicuous, and at the most only
respectable, in one department I secured a "Certificate of Honour,"
and that was Midwifery, having satisfactorily carried out the
duties of visiting accoucheur during three separate fortnights in
three successive years, although only one fortnight was demanded
for the whole course.</p>

<p>I may say something more of this aspect of my hospital life,
since it remains in memory as in many ways the most significant and
the most interesting. It was no doubt natural that midwifery duties
should appeal to me, partly because they came within the sphere of
sex which was the main motive for my medical course, and partly
because they gratified that interest in women, at once scientific
and emotional, by which I have always been moved. But this period
of residence in the hospital for outside midwifery duty was arduous
and uncomfortable, and few students who had once got through the
regulation fortnight ever applied for a second fortnight of similar
service.</p>

<p>I always selected the summer for my period of duty, as the
pleasantest time to be abroad at night, though summer had one
peculiar discomfort which will appear. I was lodged in a bare
little room at the top of the hospital with an electric bell above
the head of the bed. Meals were provided in the dining-room used by
other members of the resident medical staff. A fresh midwifery
clerk came on duty every week, and during the first week was
subordinate to his predecessor who explained the duties,
accompanied him to his first case, and during the second week was
similarly superior to his successor. St. Thomas's Hospital stands
to the north of a net-work of small streets which, in those days at
all events, were largely of slum character. Pregnant women would
arrange beforehand for free midwifery attendance from the hospital,
and, when their time had come, a messenger was sent, and the night
porter below would set the electric bell over one's head in sudden
startling vibration. Then one would hastily dress and descend to
accompany the messenger, frequently the woman's husband, through
dark and narrow streets to a humble dwelling. On an average there
would be about two calls during the twenty-four hours, more or
less, usually at night, while most of the day was spent in visits
to the patients one had already attended. It was strenuous work but
I liked it and was never in better health. A first visit was liable
to be a trying experience for a youth who had never been called
upon to take charge of such a situation&mdash;as none of us had
when we entered on these duties&mdash;and one of my fellow
students, a refined and distinguished youth from Suffolk, at his
first case was so overcome that he actually fainted.</p>

<p>I was never myself so affected, and indeed the student who
succeeded me and made his first regulation visit in my company
complimented me on the way in which it seemed to him that I showed
myself "master of the situation." But the "situation" was often
embarrassing, and my skill in meeting it was at the outset small
indeed. Almost, if not quite, my first call was to a sordid room
where an almost middle-aged woman lay helplessly in filth on a
filthy bed. Her time had not yet come, and I failed to detect at
once (though it was Saturday night) that she had been drinking, but
advised giving her brandy, a recommendation received in silence and
without enthusiasm by the bystanders. Perhaps my second call, I
think, was to a girl in her teens, having her first baby, a
pleasant and healthy girl, but whose humble occupation was that of
a cinder-sifter by the riverside, an occupation by which her whole
body, though clean, had become tinted to the tone of what she
worked in. Her mother was acting as nurse, and it amuses me to
recall the alarm with which as the final stage was arriving my
patient exclaimed: "Oh, mother, I'm going to pee! It's coming, it's
coining!" and the threatened stream flew across my face, while I
sought to reassure her. Then, on another occasion, I found a lady's
maid, a large loose-featured handsome young woman, seated
coquettishly in the middle of the room with an elegant
walking-stick in her hand, though she quickly put aside her fine
airs when she found they made no impression on me, and became
simple and natural. She had been invited on board a yacht by
"gentlemen," and came away pregnant, having, I was assured by her
sister, been drugged, but I have long since learnt to know that in
such cases the "drug" has only been a glass of wine. Again I recall
perhaps the only instance in my experience (merely covering one
hundred cases) in which childbirth was easy and practically
painless. It was not a first confinement and the patient was a
young woman under thirty, not of the poorest class, fairly plump,
natural and simple, good-natured and good-humoured, with a
wholesome and frequent smile revealing sound teeth.</p>

<p>For the most part the homes I thus entered were sordid and
dirty, the women who acted as nurses were usually stupid and
ignorant, the children were unwanted, the husbands often seemed
unintelligent, merely accepting the situation; one young
husband&mdash;though he was exceptional&mdash;was, however, jealous
and cried out at my presence by his wife's bedside; he had to be
pacified by relatives. It being summertime, vermin abounded; as I
sat in the bedroom I would be conscious of a gradual invasion; and
frequently when I returned to my little room at the hospital my
first task was to remove my garments with precaution, one by one,
to detect and destroy bugs and fleas, the seams at the trouser-ends
being, however, the spots which they chiefly infested. This
incidental result of my duties was usually far more unpleasant than
anything in the duties themselves; for those I could always accept
as natural and right.</p>

<p>It is nearly half a century ago now, but I have never forgotten
one little discovery I made in that small upper room of the
hospital which had been occupied by a long succession of students
on midwifery duty. On the walls, names and inscriptions had been
pencilled, for the most part of no significance to me, but on one
inscription I came with a thrill of delight:</p>

<p class="poem">"Forsan et haec ohm meminisse juvabit."</p>

<p>It is a familiar Virgilian tag, but it was not the obvious
reaction of the ordinary medical student as I knew him, and I felt
that here, before me, had been a fellow spirit who moved on the
same plane as I moved. Who he was I could not guess. But to think
of his kinship is delicious to me still.</p>

<p>What became of the children I then helped to bring into the
world I shall never know. I am pleased to remember that they all
reached the world safely, and that none of the mothers were any the
worse. I tried to keep some of them in sight for a time, and when
Sir Coutts Lindsay gave the progressive Association permission for
a special Sunday visit to the Grafton Gallery, which was the home
of the most modern movement in English art, I sent invitations to
certain of my mothers, and had the pleasure of seeing some of them
at the Gallery.</p>

<p>In those days a student who had not obtained his full
qualification was allowed to act as unqualified assistant to a
doctor, and, in accordance with accepted custom, having completed
my full course at the hospital but not yet passed the final
examinations, I obtained, in 1886, the post of assistant for the
winter to a Dr. Gray at Dalton-in-Furness in the north of
Lancashire. This doctor (of Scottish origin) and his wife were not
congenial companions, though our relations were easy. The work
included a certain amount of daily visiting, but was not of much
interest, and involved long standing in a cold surgery, which was
probably the cause of an attack of haematuria from which, however,
I never suffered again. The people and the place had much to
interest me. I had never been so far north. It was a mining
district and the population, as the prevailing names indicated, is
remotely of Scandinavian origin. They had Scandinavian traits, were
inclined to be silent, reserved, a little suspicious; Dr. Gray was
always talking against them, and I cannot recall that anyone left
on me a sympathetic impression. But Dalton had produced its man of
genius. Romney had been born there and was buried there; I used
sometimes to stand at his tomb in the churchyard. Dalton was within
easy reach on one side of the sea, and on the other of Lakeland. I
spent a day on Windermere. But my great joy and refuge was the
ruined Abbey at Furness. Thither I went and lingered as often as
possible. It was at that time a peacefully neglected spot,
unexcavated, unrestored, little visited save on holidays. There are
many features of interest, there are exquisite fragments;
altogether it has given me more pleasure and repose than any other
ruined English Abbey I know, even Fountains; largely, it may well
be, though not entirely, because I have known it best.</p>

<p>In the following winter I accepted another similar post with Dr.
Aitchison in Blackburn. This also happened to be Lancashire, but a
very different region; everything was different, and much more
congenial. Dr. Aitchison (Scottish again) lived with his father and
his two sisters, much about my own age; they were homely and
friendly people and they took me and accepted me as a friend, more
especially the elder girl who managed the household, and who had
some literary tastes, shared, indeed, by the other sister, who was,
however, of more silent disposition. She introduced me to Dr.
Grosart, a Presbyterian minister at Blackburn, but widely known in
the world as a scholar and an authority on English literature; with
him, on the strength of the Mermaid Series, I at once entered into
friendly relationship. Blackburn, as a town, was full of life,
though a dull and mechanised life quite unfamiliar to me, the life
of a Lancashire factory town, and I learnt much that was new. I
learnt also to know what I came to realise were typical Lancashire
people, and I liked them, simple, hearty, friendly, industrious
people, altogether unlike the miners of Furness, while here, too,
was for me the revelation of feminine industrialism. My work proved
more interesting than at Furness, and I enjoyed learning to know
the people in their homes.</p>

<p>In March the time came for me to leave. A few days before, it so
happened, a man entered the surgery and complained of sore throat.
I examined the throat, approaching incautiously close. I had not
realised it, but the man was developing scarlet fever. On the day
for me to leave I was not feeling very well&mdash;it might be a
cold coming on&mdash;and the Aitchisons urged me to delay my
departure. I would not. In a few days the Annual Winter Exhibition
of Old Masters at Burlington House was to close. They were
fascinating shows; I had not missed any of the Series; I could not
miss this. So I left. We propose; we cannot be sure of disposing. I
missed the show, and I brought death to my mother.</p>

<p>I was obviously ill when I arrived home at Earlswood. I think my
mother sent for the family doctor that same evening. He diagnosed
scarlet fever. It proved a fairly severe attack. My sisters were
isolated; my mother nursed me. But while I was still in bed my
mother caught the infection and had to retire to her bed. A nurse
was immediately sent for, and attended to both of us. I well
remember that when my mother realised she had contracted the fever
she calmly remarked to me: "I shall not get over it." I was by that
time myself getting over it (already busy again with the Mermaid
editorial work which was soon to pass out of my hands), and was
able to come in my dressing-gown to sit by the fire in my mother's
room when the nurse rested or went for a walk. She went for a walk
on the morning of the 13th of April, when my sisters also were out
of the house. I went up to the room as usual and sat by the fire.
My mother was feeling better and had asked for, and enjoyed, a
little bread and butter. With the illusory sense of well-being
which often precedes death she cheerfully spoke of recovering and
with my aid for a few moments got out of bed. Then by the fireside
I began to read. I had brought up with me Ibsen's <i>Peer Gynt,</i>
in the German version, and was then reading it for the first time,
quite unaware of the course of the poem. It chances to contain what
is perhaps the most wonderful death scene of a mother in the whole
of literature, and it so happened that, by one of those
inconceivable coincidences I have met in my life, it was this scene
that I reached that morning.</p>

<p>I was recalled from the vision of Peer Gynt at the deathbed of
Mother Aase by a sound of difficult breathing from the bed near me.
I rose and applied the brush, near-by for the purpose, to my
mother's throat. She unconsciously and automatically sucked it. I
withdrew it and put a few drops of champagne in her mouth. A little
later a slight convulsion passed over her features. Then there was
nothing.</p>

<p>I stood beside her for a little while. I had had many
experiences of the diseases and sufferings of strangers in the
hospital and elsewhere, but the first person whose death I had ever
witnessed was the nearest person to me in all the world. Then I
quickly went from the room and lay on my bed, ready to tell the
nurse, so soon as she returned, what had happened.</p>

<hr>

<p>I was unable to be present at the grave-side. It had so chanced
that, on my first visit to Eariswood with my mother, to arrange to
take the house, we had entered the churchyard, and saw a funeral
going on. That incident remained fixed in my memory; but my mother
was never to know the significance of the omen, and that in a
double sense she had on that day found her last dwelling-place.</p>

<p>A month later, when all the arrangements called for by our
mother's death had been made, my sisters and I went to rest for a
short time at Babbacombe near Torquay.*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* My sister Louie wrote to a friend at this
time concerning our mother's death a letter which came into my
hands more than forty years later: "She was <i>so good,</i> and up
to the very last her thoughts were about others' comforts and
Father and us. I never knew anyone more thoughtful and unselfish.
The letters that flock in are a great comfort, and the grief of the
poor people is very touching. It has been so lovely; and it has
shown me my resources, and my own philosophy has made me
strong."]</p>

<p>After that the time passed very quickly. I settled at 9, St.
Mary's Terrace, Paddington, where my sister Louie was setting up
her business. She was becoming a court dressmaker whose fine
artistic aptitudes were much appreciated by many clients of the
society world and so continued until her business was destroyed by
the Great War. I had the two rooms on the first floor; I had never
before had rooms that were really my own or a study and
sitting-room to myself. It was also a new pleasure to furnish it
myself, and to choose as the prevailing tone the gold and straw
shades which always seemed to me the best background for a
living-room. I had no temptation to leave London again that
year.</p>

<p>My literary activities, however, seem to have slowed down. In
1889 I published nothing but an essay on Diderot.</p>

<p>I was evidently giving my best time to my final medical
examination, and in February of 1889 I obtained at Blackfriars the
Licentiate in Medicine, Surgery, and Midwifery of the Society of
Apothecaries, a complete qualification, much more complete than it
was when Keats obtained it less than a hundred years before me. But
it sounds quaintly, and has sometimes puzzled my Continental
medical friends when I endeavoured to explain that it is one of our
numerous English equivalents of their M.D.*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* It is quite true, I may add, that the
L.S.A., while an adequate qualification, confers no prestige. That
only came nearly fifty years later when, under a special rule, the
Royal College of Physicians conferred on me the unexpected honour
of Fellowship.]</p>

<p>But even during this period I had evidently been giving much
time to the preparation of the Contemporary Science Series, and I
find from my pocket diary that a few days after the examination I
went to lunch at the Savile Club with that interesting and
versatile old scholar Canon Isaac Taylor, to discuss the book I had
invited him to do on <i>The Origin of the Aryans.</i></p>

<p>It was probably towards the end of 1888 that, in connection with
my Science Series, I suddenly conceived and carried out a literary
scheme with a rapidity in complete contrast to my usual methods of
work, a <i>tour de force,</i> as' have always regarded it, which I
never desired to repeat. But it would seem that while, to myself as
well as to others, my characteristic methods of procedure in life
are slow, continuous, hesitant, deliberate&mdash;and most of my
books I have taken years to think over and complete&mdash;I am also
from time to time capable of swift and unforeseen resolutions which
I carry out thoroughly to a speedy and effective conclusion. I
suppose it is one of those radical inconsistencies of temperament
which mark people of complex temperament who achieve anything at
all.</p>

<p>I was walking along the Strand and stopped, as my custom was, at
the bookstall of a shop that has long since disappeared. I took up
a second-hand copy of a little book just published, Tarde's <i>La
Criminalité Comparée.</i> I had never taken the slightest interest
in criminals, nor even regarded them as a possible subject of
scientific study. So the title of this book attracted me and on
opening it I found there was such a subject as "Criminal
Anthropology." I bought the book and read it eagerly. It was a
sober and temperate book, not daring or original, but it was a
revelation to me of work being done in Italy which I had never
known of, and for the first time I saw the name of Lombroso, which
scarcely anyone in England had even heard. I almost instantly
resolved to write a book about the criminal in general and criminal
anthropology in particular.</p>

<p>I set to work at once in a comprehensive fashion, buying the
necessary books and periodicals, largely Italian, which were
inaccessible in England, and starting lines of investigation and
enquiry in various directions, among others circulating a list of
printed questions to the medical officers of prisons, after
obtaining the permission of their official superiors, though the
answers to these, while helpful, were few. The whole work proved
entirely congenial to me, for on the one side it appealed to my
demand for social reform, and on the other to my impulse of
scientific organisation and my taste for anthropology. In little
more than a year I had mastered all the available material and
completed a book which still to myself seems an achievement, alike
by the rapidity with which it was carried out and its thorough and
comprehensive presentation of the whole subject in its various
bearings. But otherwise I de not defend the book. It attracted wide
attention and many readers but it was not really the work for me,
and thirty years later I decided that it was out of date and not
worth further revision. So I turned it adrift. But the reforms I
advocated are still largely unrealised, and still being put forth
afresh.</p>

<p>On the 22nd of March 1889, I went over to Paris for a week to be
with Olive Schreiner. She had written from Mentone, which she was
about to leave, to ask me to telegraph immediately if I could be at
the Paris station on her arrival. I have a few memories of the
visit but not many, and I cannot even recall definitely where I
stayed. At the beginning of May I accepted a temporary post as the
medical superintendent of a hydropathic establishment at Harrogate
for three months during the absence of the principal. It was simply
a boardinghouse where I was merely called upon to give medical
advice, if required, to the guests staying there for treatment at
the Baths near by, and to preside at the table. So I practically
had the whole time to myself in a fine climate at a pleasant season
of the year. I went on numerous delightful excursions, notably to
York and Fountains Abbey, spent much time in the open air, and, for
the rest, worked at the completion of <i>The New Spirit</i> in a
tiny secluded office, for at that time I still wrote at a desk in
the conventional way. It was not until a few years later, in
Cornwall, that I gradually acquired the habit, which finally became
invariable, of writing in a reclining position and as much as
possible out of doors.</p>

<p>In September I was again in Paris for a week to visit the
Exhibition which commemorated the centenary of the French
Revolution. Arthur Symons came with me. He had never been to Paris
or out of England before, and was pleased to be under my wing. He
had, indeed, never left the roof of his father, a Puritanic
Wesleyan minister, and at Paris I introduced him, for the first
time, to wine and to cigarettes. We had no thought of penetrating
into the haunts which some people peculiarly associate with Paris.
Any later adventures Symons had in that direction were not under my
guidance. Our time, outside the Exhibition grounds in the Champ de
Mars, was mostly absorbed by the more conventional sights of Paris
and the picture galleries.</p>

<p>Next month, Olive Schreiner left England to return to South
Africa, not to come back, except for two short visits, the second
with her newly married husband, until nearly twentyfive years had
passed. It was a memorable event in my life. Our relationship had
for some time been on my side, as it had nearly all the time been
on hers, a calm and deep friendship. But now all personal contact,
save a weekly letter, ceased; she had returned to a remote world
where she was soon to marry, and the whole Atlantic severed us. I
went down to the dock to see her off.</p>

<p>The following year, 1890, was one of the outstanding years of my
life. I was thirty; it was the age I had long previously fixed as
that for the publication of my earliest book. Now I completed and
published two books: in March <i>The New Spirit,</i> representing
the first fruits of my literary activities, swiftly followed a few
months later by <i>The Criminal,</i> with which were originated my
scientific activities.</p>

<p>With these tasks off my hands I proceeded to carry out the
slowly matured plan of a prolonged stay in Paris in the company of
Arthur Symons. I wished to explore what was being done in medical
and anthropological quarters in Paris, while at the same time
coming into closer touch with the art and literature, while Symons,
whose literary and social connections had been rapidly multiplying,
was eager to embrace all that Paris had to offer. We knew already
that we could live together in congenial harmony, although Symons
had no interest in science, and he was, then as later, content to
leave the main lines of organisation in my hands, while I was
content to leave the details to him. I was equipped with guidebooks
and trainbooks; he was equipped with letters of introduction, which
brought us into touch with men prominent in letters and art.</p>

<p>Professor (later Sir Patrick) Geddes, who knew Paris intimately,
had recommended to me the Hôtel Corneille, beside the Odéon, and
there we settled down for three months, discovering later that it
was an hotel not without a history, described by Balzac and once
inhabited by Baudelaire, as well as Paget and other notables. Fora
few weeks my sister Louie came over and joined us. (I remember that
Remy de Gourmont remarked that it would not be possible for a
French girl to go abroad in this way, even to stay with her
brother.) These months were among the most pleasant and instructive
in my life. I saw little or nothing of French homes, but I was able
to absorb and enjoy all those superficial aspects of the French art
of life which are so congenial to me, in spite of my defective
sociability, and even more congenial to Arthur Symons' Celtic
temperament.</p>

<p>I cannot indeed say that I carried far what I had put before
myself as a primary object: medical and scientific study. Not that
I entirely neglected that aim. I went to hospitals and lunatic
asylums on a few occasions; T attended a meeting of the
Anthropological Society; I explored the School of Anthropology
under the guidance of Manouvrier who was its leading spirit, an
interesting and remarkable little man, who unselfishly devoted much
time to me and talked of various subjects; I regret that I did not
attempt to keep up the relationship. I also visited Topinard, a
distinguished anthropologist of the older school, who had
grievances against the younger men which he expounded to me with
finger solemnly raised. I felt sorry for him, but I found
Letourneau more friendly and congenial, a kindly man of scholarly
habits&mdash;though I never rated his scholarship highly&mdash;and
at the same time a champion of free thought; I saw him surrounded
by books in his study on the Boulevard Saint-Michel, and he was
eager to help me by introductions to like-minded friends: among
others he took me out one day to see Madame Lafargue, the daughter
of Karl Marx (sister of the Eleanor I already well knew), where she
lived with her husband in the suburbs; later they were to die
together by suicide. Still less scholarly, but more original, and
really an artist in style, was Elie Reclus, the brother of the
better-known Elisée and the uncle of his namesake Elie Faure, the
historian of art and likewise an artist in style, who was later
also to be my friend. Elie Reclus was a delightful personality,
simple and genuine, an Anarchist of the finest quality. I have
always cherished a warm regard for him. He invited me to dinner to
meet his family and some special friends. I fear they were much
disappointed, for not only did I keep dinner waiting by losing my
way, but I do not shine on such occasions even when free to speak
my own language. Elie Reclus's house was a place of refuge for
distinguished foreign Anarchists in hiding. I remember meeting one
there once, Merlino, a gloomy, silent, dark little man. Later, Elie
Reclus found it convenient to migrate to Brussels. When in after
years my <i>Studies</i> were proscribed and condemned the finest
and most affectionate letter that reached me was from Elie
Reclus.</p>

<p>In the medical world of Paris I came into actual personal
contact with almost no one. I attended some lectures by professors
of standing, and I chanced to meet at my friend Chapman's house Dr.
Berrillon, then well known for his therapeutic success as a
hypnotist and, at his invitation, visited his clinic. The most
famous man in the Parisian medical world whom I saw was Charcot,
giving a demonstration on a patient at the Salpêtrière, and his
powerful but rather antipathetic personality made a deep impression
on me; a Napoleonic figure, he seemed, though of larger size than
Napoleon.</p>

<p>In the Parisian worlds of literature and art I saw a number of
people of note and came into closer touch with them, usually in the
society of Symons, for here it was he who took the energetic
initiative. We had from the outset the entry to some interesting
<i>salons,</i> such as that of Dyer, an American artist long
settled in Paris and in touch with various notable people; I
specially remember Madame Gréville, a popular novelist of that day,
a very large woman seated in a chair around which a circle of
guests gathered to listen to her continuously amusing flow of
speech, mostly concerning the famous people she had known.</p>

<p>Then there was the more distinguished <i>salon</i> of Madame
Darmesteter (formerly Miss A. Mary F. Robinson, and later Madame
Duclaux), where the charm and literary skill of the kittenish
little wife, and the scholarship of the husband&mdash;a small,
grave, hump-backed man, kindly and sympathetic&mdash;attracted
eminent people of varied kinds. Here we were once to meet
Taine&mdash;a writer whose vigorous and penetrating work I had been
eagerly absorbing a few years earlier&mdash;but, through fear of
being too early, we arrived too late, and the great man was making
his way out of the room as we entered it, a tall lean man with a
grave, abstracted, scholarly face. There were other people of less
eminence, however, whom I was pleased to meet. The really great
men, however, and those whom we chiefly wanted to know, are not
usually to be found in <i>salons.</i> In the first rank of these
were Rodin and Verlaine, two figures then in the prime of their
genius, but subjects for fierce dispute in their own land and only
known to the <i>avant garde</i> (such as we might be considered) in
England.</p>

<p>I do not remember by what path we reached Rodin, but it was at
an early stage, and I think we first met him not in his large show
studio in the Rue de l'Université but in his actual working studio
in a more outlying district. I think it may have been in the Rue de
Varenne. He was a quiet man of medium height with a sturdy figure
and a long fair beard. But as he talked little, preferring to let
his work speak for him, and made no advances, it was Symons who
came into closer touch with him, and they maintained friendly
relations until Rodin's death. His work was in some of its aspects
fascinating to me, though by no means in all, and I gradually
formed the opinion, which now perhaps will not be disputed, that
while undoubtedly a great artist, and with highly aesthetic
receptivity, he can hardly be counted among the greatest sculptors.
His creations were too often straining beyond the limits of
sculpture, and the Gate of Hell, which he regarded as his
masterpiece, is an impossible gate.</p>

<p>We reached Verlaine at an early period by the help of Charles
Morice, a sensitive and enthusiastic critic, who pioneered the new
movements in poetry and art, and had written the first book about
Verlaine, the outstanding French poet of the day for discerning
eyes, though half a century later he has paled beside Rimbaud, whom
we read and admired but looked upon as too swiftly lost to reach
fame. Morice was a tall lanky Provençal of eager vulturine type; I
recall him as I saw him rushing through the New Salon on varnishing
day, with arms fluttering like wings, and seeming to absorb
everything as he passed. Symons and I clubbed together to invite
Morice to dinner at the Restaurant Boulant near us, in the
Boulevard Saint-Michel, where we were accustomed to have our meals,
in a corner then, and for many years later presided over by an
attractive and friendly waitress called Céline. Morice devoured his
dinner greedily and duly led us, it may have been that sane
evening, to the Café at the corner of the Boulevard near the Seine
which at that time Verlaine haunted. We found him there with Moréas
and one or two other young writers less known to fame. Moréas was
an antipathetic figure to me, nor did I care for his poetry, but
Verlaine from the first a sympathetic figure, always simple,
natural, courteous, instinctively a gentleman, never displeasing in
spite of all that has been said of his drinking habits, for though
it is true that a glass was always near him, he only touched it to
sip, and it never seemed to need replenishing. He invited us to
visit him at his room in the Hôtel des Mines higher up the
Boulevard, and thither we went an evening or two later. The poet
took out his purse and produced from it a two-franc piece. I can
still hear him saying in English:</p>

<p class="quote">"I have <i>money</i>;&mdash;will have
<i>pleasure!"</i></p>

<p>Thereupon he sent a young friend with him for rum and glasses,
with which to regale us in what might seem the English fashion,
while I produced cigarettes.* I never met Verlaine during his visit
to England in later days, though, by arrangement, he occupied my
rooms (which were part of Symons's flat) in the Temple. But I have
experienced the keenest delight in many of his poems, and to me he
was the finest French poet of his time, indeed, one of the few
essential poets France has produced.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* The whole incident is described in detail,
and in a generally faithful manner, by Arthur Symons in his
Reminiscences, <i>Mes Souvenirs,</i> though he neglects to mention
that I shared the adventure.]</p>

<p>Then there was another man of a more respectable eminence in
French letters whom I vividly recall. For once, only once, we were
admitted to that famous little <i>cénacle</i> which was held every
Tuesday evening at Mallarmé's flat in the Rue de Rome. It was a
small flat though in a highly respectable house and street, and the
dining-room where these meetings were held was correspondingly
small, an oblong room completely filled by the oblong table and the
chairs on each side. Mallarmé himself opened the door to us, a
charming attractive little man, who talked but always quietly. He
sat at the head of the table near the dining-room door; on his
right was the young poet&mdash;I forget his name for the
moment&mdash;who translated Swinburne, and on his left Henri de
Régnier, whom I recall as distinctly as the host, for his novels
have given me much enjoyment and his poetry I rank high, a tall
slender man, of elegant distinction, with a monocle to his eye;
Symons sat on the same side and I on the opposite side. The
traditional bowl of tobacco, the only hospitality Mallarmé could
afford, was passed up and down, and we made our cigarettes. The
conversation on this occasion was at first and chiefly about a
young poet Ephraim Mikaël, who had just died. We $aw nothing of
Madame Mallarmé or the children, and heard nothing, but they were,
I know, noiselessly seated in the next room and could hear us, for
not long afterwards Mrs. Moulton, a noted American writer of that
clay whom I sometimes met both in Paris and in London, told me how
Mallarmé had repeated to her the remark, evoked by Symons's high
voice, which one of the girls had made to her mother: "Listen to
the little bird twittering."</p>

<p>But of all the men of letters I met at that time there was none
who made a greater impression on me, or whose genius as a master of
prose I so highly estimated, as Huysmans. At that time Gourmont and
Huysmans were on very friendly terms, and we saw Huysmans on
various occasions, sometimes with Madame Courrière, who had once
been the favourite model of a great sculptor and at this time was
in intimate relations with Huysmans, indeed, it seems, she figures
as Madame Chantelouve in <i>Là-bas,</i> which he was then writing.
Once we saw him in his large and pleasant official room (for he was
a Government official, and, I understand, an entirely satisfactory
one) where Madame Courrière had just brought under his delighted
gale the latest <i>affiche</i> by Chéret, the chief artist of the
poster at that time. On another occasion we met him in the street
and accompanied him to the café where he was about to take a
vermouth for his digestion. Most notably we spent an evening with
him in Madame Courrière's tiny salon crammed with small bibelots.
The admiration which at that period Huysmans aroused in me, both as
a distinguished personality and a great artist in literature,
remains unabated. It is a satisfaction to me that I introduced him
to English readers in a lengthy and elaborate essay of my
<i>Affirmations</i> in 1897, and to know that today, more than
thirty years later, his high position in literature is becoming
confirmed in his own land.</p>

<p>The same can scarcely be said of another artist&mdash;this time
a painter&mdash;for whom I had a high admiration which was shared
by most of the best critics of that time: Eugène Carrière. When,
indeed, I saw him in his studio he might still be called young, and
was only at the beginning of his fame. Today, forty years later,
that fame merely languishes in deserted rooms of public picture
galleries and only has vitality among people of a past generation,
with whom I must be counted, for I still feel charm and fascination
in much of his work. But in the new generations new ideas have been
working which Carrière's work fails to satisfy. Even Elie Faure,
who once wrote an enthusiastic book about him, tells me that it no
longer corresponds to his attitude. Yet Carrière was undoubtedly a
genuine artist with a penetrating vision.</p>

<p>Another artist, whose work we viewed with much interest though
he never had any reputation with the crowd, Odilon-Redon, has
perhaps fared better with posterity. I can see him still, the
gentle quiet little man, producing large albums for our inspection,
brooding tenderly over them with us, seeming to be warmed by our
pleasure.</p>

<p>The big men of the earlier generation we of course treated with
contemptuous indifference and never made any attempt to see, though
we sometimes accidentally came across them; I recall Meissonnier, a
very short but sturdy little man with an immense grey beard, seated
in a corner on the opening day of the New Salon to receive the
compliments of his friends.</p>

<p>Many other men of that world we came across, some little known,
others well known, both alike forgotten now. But one, standing
apart, I leave to the last, since of them all he was the only one
with whom I formed a permanently friendly relationship, though we
seldom actually met in later life and he never came to London. Remy
de Gourmont was, indeed, friendly from the first, and though by
temperament a quiet, solitary, unsociable man, even for a Norman,
he was always ready to come and see us, to afford us help, and to
take us about. (I remember how, one evening on some such occasion,
walking together on the quay near Notre Dame, a too insistent woman
of the street touched him on the arm; he stopped, turned towards
her and said gravely: "On ne touche pas!") He even accompanied us
to the Gingerbread Fair at Vincennes, where we had our picture
taken together; it is reproduced in one of Symons's books. He
reviewed my first book, <i>The New Spirit,</i> and showed interest
in all of my subsequent work which reached him, arranging for the
translation of much of it into French. On my side admiration for
his work grew; for much of what he had so far done by 1890,
especially his fantastic stories, I had but little taste; but he
slowly developed and matured, so that, finally, I came to regard
him as, in the widest sense, though still especially in the field
of literature, a great critic, perhaps the most representative
critic of his time. He died during the Great War, and I know that
for the post-war generation he has no significance.</p>

<p>So this visit to Paris, the longest of all my numerous visits,
passed pleasantly and instructively. I remember, indeed, that at
one point, we had spent nearly all our small supply of money, and
for some days in succession had to pay melancholy and fruitless
visits to the Crédit Lyonnais in the Boulevard des Italiens while
the leisurely French routine of cashing an English cheque took its
course. But I am not sure that we were greatly worried. It was a
memorable event in my life, my first long Continental visit, my
first attempt to absorb on the spot the culture of a great country,
and that the country which had long most attracted me. Other visits
to other countries followed, first of all Spain, and again with
Arthur Symons for we had found that our complementary qualities
admirably fitted us to travel together.</p>

<p>That sojourn of three months in Paris, when I now look back,
appears as the climax of the whole early part of my life. The year
which it brought to an end, my thirtieth year&mdash;a memorable age
in the lives of so many people&mdash;had been crowded with decisive
events, all of them, in a humble way, for my own career
epoch-marking. I had completed that prolonged medical training
which I had rightly regarded as the necessary preparation for my
own special work in the world. I had, within a few months of each
other, published my first two books, each of which had given me a
reputation, and in two totally different fields, while I had
initiated that editorial task which was to be the chief means of
providing me with a modest livelihood during the next twenty-five
years. My mother, the main link with my childhood and family home,
was dead, and now I was for the first time occupying rooms I could
call my own and furnish in my own way. The woman of genius who had,
in a sense, initiated me into love and much else, was parted from
me by the whole Atlantic and her own approaching marriage.</p>

<p>My apprenticeship to life was over. I was master of myself and
of my life. And one other decisive event was to follow
immediately.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch7" id="ch7"></a>Chapter 7</h2>

<p>It was about the year 1887 that I first met Edith Lees. The
Fellowship of the New Life had then been in existence three or four
years. Percival Chubb was still its leading spirit in Thomas
Davidson's absence, but my active participation had diminished. I
had come to realise the inevitable limitations of the movement,
though my interest and my sympathy remained. When I met Chubb from
time to time in the luncheon hour, and walked back along Whitehall
with him to his room at the Local Government Board, he would tell
me of the Fellowship's movements. Of late he had frequently
mentioned with much satisfaction the name of Edith Lees, which I
thus heard for the first time, as a helpful and active assistant in
the secretarial work. He had met her, as I later understood, at
Stopford Brooke's house, and had speedily interested her in the
ideas of the Fellowship, for which she was prepared by recent
practical work in the London slums with her friends, Stopford
Brooke's daughters.</p>

<p>I still went to the Fellowship's meetings from time to time and
I rarely failed to join in its occasional excursions into the
country. It was on one of these that I first saw Edith Lees. She,
it appears, asked Chubb who that man was. "That is Havelock Ellis,"
he replied impressively. But she was not impressed; it seemed to
her that my clothes were ill-made, and that was a point on which
she always remained sensitive. We were, however, introduced and
walked along together for a few minutes, talking of indifferent
subjects. She was a small, compact, active person, scarcely five
feet in height, with a fine skin, a singularly well-shaped head
with curly hair, square, powerful hands, very small feet,
and&mdash;her most conspicuous feature on a first view&mdash;large
rather pale blue eyes. I cannot say that the impression she made on
me on that occasion was specially sympathetic; it so happens that
the dominating feature of her face, the pale blue eyes, is not one
that appeals to me, for to me green ur grey eycs (I believe because
one is drawn to those of one's own type) are the congenial eyes,
and I never grew really to admire them, though to many they were
peculiarly beautiful and fascinating, "pools of blue-bells," as one
friend wrote after her death, "between the gold of the furze in
flower;" it was always her beautiful voice that most appealed to
me, and when I came to know her more intimately the lovely
expressiveness of her eloquent under-lip, as I used to call it. On
her side, as I say, the impression was also not specially
favourable, if not indeed unfavourable. It so happened that in the
course of our walk through a remote district we came upon a little
chapel which we entered. In a playful mood I began to toll the
bell. This, it appears, rather jarred on her serious
humour&mdash;more serious than in later life&mdash;and she regarded
it as a feeble joke in bad taste. We had no further conversation
that I recall. Indeed, during the next two or three years I came
little in personal contact with her. I remember once going up to
shake hands with her just before a meeting of the Fellowship of
which she became the secretary in 1889, but nothing more. No doubt
I was drifting further and further away from the Fellowship.</p>

<p>Probably I should never have come into close touch with her if
it had not been for one of those strange coincidences which some
times determine the whole current of our lives. Early in 1890 my
first book, <i>The New Spirit,</i> then just published, was
presented to Edith by a man (Lawrence), a friend of hers who was in
the publishers' office and had a hand in securing its publication,
though nit personally known to me. She read it when staying on the
Norfolk Broads. (I have the copy now, well worn and much marked,
with "Edith M. O. Lees, March, 1890" written on the fly-leaf, as
she had preserved it during more than a quarter of a century.) She
enjoyed it immensely. It seemed a book after her own heart. Only a
few weeks before her death, I find that some notes, written to
preface a semi-public reading of passages from my books, began with
the declaration: "When many years ago, about twenty-eight, I first
read <i>The New Spirit,</i> I knew I loved the man who wrote it."
That declaration, and the words of "eternal comradeship" that
follow, are precious to me now, for it enables me to realise how,
beneath the failing health, the mental confusion, and sometimes the
apparent alienation of these last weeks, her heart still remained
unshaken.</p>

<p>In that same year, 1890, in late July or early August&mdash;and
unknown to me as I was not in touch with her&mdash;she started with
her faithful servant, Ellen Taylor, for a walking tour in Cornwall,
her first visit to a land in which, it so happened, she was
destined to spend part of every year, willingly or unwillingly, for
the whole of the rest of her life&mdash;almost the half of it. In
the course of their walk, after leaving Penzance, on the 13th of
August, they reached Lamorna, where lived Miss Agnes Jones, who had
been in correspondence with Edith, I believe, concerning the
Fellowship; Edith called to see her, and was invited to stay for
the night.</p>

<p>Now it so happened that that same year, and about the same time,
though of course unknown to Edith, I also left London for my first
visit to Cornwall. It was not a holiday visit; I had, a year
earlier, obtained my medical qualification, and I was now going to
a week's work as <i>locum tenens</i> for Dr. Bonar of Probus, near
Truro. But I had planned a holiday to follow, and my old friend,
Miss Agnes Jones, who lived at lonely and beautiful Lamorna,
occupying indeed the only good-sized house (built in part with a
view to serve as a chapel) at that spot had invited me to spend ten
days with her from the 13th of August.</p>

<p>On that fateful 13th of August, shortly after Edith had accepted
the invitation to spend the night at Lamorna and had been shown her
room, Miss Jones casually mentioned that she was expecting Havelock
Ellis that afternoon. Thereupon Edith wavered in her decision to
stay. Evidently, notwithstanding <i>The New Spirit,</i> so
impressionable was she then and ever since by directly personal
things, the badly tailored and tactless person at the picnic still
outweighed the revelation of the book. She retired to her room for
a quiet consultation with Ellen. A man was coming (so, she used to
tell me, she said) whom she disliked, and would prefer not to meet.
Should they push on that same day to Land's End? It was Ellen who
decided the matter. Her feet were already sore with much walking;
she pleaded for a quiet rest in that comfortable house. Edith
agreed, the more readily as it was not easy to reject the accepted
invitation. A servant's sore feet changed the whole course of my
life.</p>

<p>Late that afternoon Edith saw a figure in a professional silk
hat, bag in hand, and wearing (so at least she always asserted) a
torn mackintosh, walk up the path to the house after following her
own track from Penzance. My recollection of the evening, though
pleasant, is vague. I only know that we speedily fell into a tone
of sincerity and intimacy. That was certainly Edith's doing. She
always penetrated swiftly to realities, and was herself so real,
and her sincerity so transparent, that those she spoke with, men or
women, seldom failed to respond, and often uttered the thing that
they had never confided to any before. What we talked of I cannot
remember, but evidently among other things Edith told of her old
physician, Dr. Birch, and of her trust in his insight, for the one
remark of the evening I can recall came from Miss Jones, with whom
I sat alone for a short time after Edith had gone to her room,
"What an extraordinary faith," she remarked with a whimsical smile,
"some people have in their doctors!"</p>

<p>My memories are just as vague, as pleasantly vague, concerning
the next day. With Miss Jones I accornpanied the two walking
tourists as far as Miss Jones's strength permitted, along the
coastguards' path, as it winds through the varied and lovely little
bays, towards Land's End. No fragment of the conversation remains,
only the reminiscence of a pleasant feeling of association, the
germs of comradeship were beginning to arise. The lithe and sturdy
little figure passed on with knapsack on back, and the stout staff,
as long as herself ("the little lady with the big stick," the
people called her) she long afterwards used. I now wandered about
alone in the exquisite atmosphere of Lamorna, so suggestive of
Turner, who must surely have known it. I lay on the cliffs and
sometimes saw the young foxes playing together not far off. At
night in bed in the loft of the house I could look over at sea as
far as the twinkling light of Eddystone. But no more definite
memories remain of that week. One picture alone stands out, not of
Lamorna, against the background.</p>

<p>I had gone across the Cornish peninsula, for the day, on my
first visit to St. Ives. On the same day Edith also chanced to
reach for the first time the town with which we were destined to be
associated through so many years. I can no longer recall whether we
had appointed a meeting at St. Ives. It is possible. It is also
possible that I had reckoned on the chance of meeting her there on
that day. But so far as memory serves, perhaps rightly serves, the
meeting which actually took place was the joyous outcome of
unexpected good fortune. I was passing through the narrow old
street which leads to the ocean side of the town at Porthmear when
her quick eyes caught sight of me from the recesses of a cobbler's
little shop. She had gone in to have her boots mended on the
spot&mdash;a characteristic proceeding&mdash;and was waiting in her
stockinged feet. She ran out instantly in stockinged feet and I
heard behind me her clear, eager, beautiful voice&mdash;the voice
which, as more than one friend noted with astonishment, retained
all its qualities, through ill-health and exhaustion, to the end.
We entered the shop together and waited for the cobbler to finish.
Then we rambled on to Porthmear and along the beach. Our
conversation, though impersdnal, was now more intimate; at Lamorna
Miss Jones had nearly always been of the party, and here we were
alone together, for Ellen could be left to trudge in our wake. We
exchanged views on marriage and they proved congenial. I can no
longer remember what I said, but I know that in her mind some of
the things then said always remained. We were beginning to be
friends.</p>

<p>I accompanied her along the Carbis Bay and Lelant coast as far
as the Hayle Ferry, for she was going on to spend the night at
Gwithian, finding lodgings in a little cottage occupied by two old
sisters of whose quaint proceedings she ever after delighted to
tell. I stood desolately alone and watched the ferry-boat cross,
and the two figures receding in the distance over the towans. It is
strange, but, through all the years I have lived so close to that
ferry, I never once passed across it to Hayle. Only at last, less
than a year ago, have I watched the ferry-boat from the Hayle side,
with tender thoughts of the old days at my heart, while Edith lay
grievously ill in the Hayle Hospital. I shall never cross the ferry
to Hayle.</p>

<p>Therewith ended the fateful adventure which might have meant so
little and in the end meant so much. Nothing definite had happened.
But each of us had come in contact with a real person who seemed to
possess the makings of a comrade and friend. Each of us had drawn
aside and disregarded that exterior veil over the other, which at
first had seemed repellent, and found an attractive person beneath.
It was a real and true discovery on each part. Yet, it may well be,
our exteriors are also real, and not to be disregarded with
impunity. Neither of us ever lost that interior vision of the
other; on the contrary, it grew deeper and more fixed with the
years. Yet when the first glow of the new discovery had slowly
passed, and intimacy rendered the trivial circumstance of exterior
personality more insistent, for both of us the first impression was
apt to recur, no one could ever foresee at what moment, to produce
again and again a discordant jar with the inner vision, impulsively
uttered on the one side, more silently endured on the other. Her
ideal man&mdash;surprising in a woman so unconventional and not, in
reality, an ideal with which she had the slightest inner
congruance&mdash;seerans always to have been the correct and
conventional man of the world, certainly often a charming type. But
the type was obviously not realised in me, and again and again when
she recognised this fact she resented it. For my part, always a
dreamer, reserved and diffident and sensitive, the swift
impulsiveness of her actions, her incalculable nervous
irritability, caused me often to repeat to myself the saying of
Alphonse Daudet concerning his own charming and accomplished wife,
that a literary man's wife should be like a feather bed. But no one
could be less like a feather bed than Edith; I was sometimes made
to feel that she was more like a little porcupine. That perpetually
recurrent external discordance made always a thread of tragedy
running through the love of two people who at heart remained,
always, lovers and comrades, united in an intimacy of confidence
that can be but rarely attained. It must also be said that even the
divergence of temperament that in the acute degree jarred was at
less degrees of tension even an advantage. Her ever fresh and eager
vivacity then became an unalloyed joy to me, and my quiet and
tender sympathy brought ease and rest to her. Even during the last
terrible winter, when her mind had grown so distracted and she lay
in the Convent Home at Hayle, I had but to lie beside her outside
the bedclothes, with my arm across her, and she would slowly and
peacefully sink to sleep. "I am his champagne," she was in the
habit of saying playfully to friends, "and he is my opium."</p>

<p>She proceeded on her leisurely walk up the coast to Tintagel and
settled for a few weeks at Condoldon near Camelford, in the farm
house of a Mrs. Cobbledick. She soon found out that there was a
slaughterhouse attached to the farm and that the landlady's son was
the butcher. She always had a horror of slaughterhouses&mdash;even
though later she kept pigs, had them killed in the yard, and cut
them up herself&mdash;and so it seemed a little incongruous when
the young butcher made a proposal of marriage to the bright and
friendly visitor. When she left she invited Mrs. Cobbledick and her
daughter to stay with her in London. This visit came off not very
long after, and some ten years later she narrated its chief
incidents, almost exactly as they occurred, in a story included in
<i>My Cornish Neighbours</i>. She even retained Mrs. Cobbledick's
real name in the first version of the story, feeling that it was
impossible to improve on it, but this she altered later on my
suggestion. It is perhaps the only story in the volume that may be
regarded as literally true, though, for that very reason, it is a
little too farcical for art.</p>

<p>It was from Condoldon, two or three days after leaving St. Ives,
that Edith first wrote to me. I had not so far written to her. In
the little note to "Dear Mr. Ellis" from "Yours in haste" she told
me of her whereabouts and added: "Make your way here if you come,
as it is cheap and comfortable and ye fashionable corners are
stocked." Slight as the note was I carefully preserved it, possibly
with some vague premonition of all that the writer of it was one
day to become to me. She also&mdash;as I have found when examining
her private papers since her death&mdash;had on her part carefully
preserved what may well have been my first letter to her. This was
more remarkable, for throughout life it was always her habit to
destroy all letters, even with undue haste, on receipt, immediately
they had been dealt with. Exceptions to this rule were only made in
the case of three or four rare and special people very close to her
heart, of whom I was the only man. This note addressed to "Dear
Edith Lees," is dated the 15th of October, when she had returned to
town, and invites her to visit me and my sister: "Will you not come
some day, before long&mdash;when Satan can find no worse mischief
for your energetic feet to do&mdash;and narrate what woman can do
at Tintagel, and the rest?" ("What women can do" was the title of a
lecture she was giving in those days.) But of this first meeting in
London I have no recollection.</p>

<p>At that time, as I have told, I was living a full, active and
varied life to an extent I had never before lived and rarely since.
My meeting with Edith was the climax of many new, absorbing and
sometimes agitating experiences, though at the time it seemed a
calm and peaceful climax, scarcely indeed, as yet, a climax at all.
It was in September of that year, soon after the return from
Lamorna, that my sister Louie and I left Redhill, where my mother
had died, and took a house in St. Mary's Terrace, Paddington, where
I had a large sitting-room of my own, to use as a study and for the
reception of visitors. It was the first time I had lived in so
central a part of London, and my active interests in life were thus
fostered and increased. My heart remained free, though perhaps not
altogether contentedly free. Olive Schreiner, whom I had loved and
worshipped for seven years, was now in South Africa, and I had
become resigned to the fact, I had long known, that we were never
to be more than affectionate friends.</p>

<p>Edith used to run into my rooms from time to time&mdash;usually,
no doubt, by arrangement in her swift impulsive way, always very
busy, generally in a hurry, yet often staying much longer than she
had declared it possible for her to stay. I never went to her rooms
in Wigmore Street. But on rare occasions we would meet in town,
usually to go to a concert or a music-hall together. There were, at
first, no approaches towards intimacy, and I cannot recall that any
thought of love arose. The relation was one of pleasant comradeship
with an energetic and much alive woman who, as I soon began to
realise, had a sort of genius for friendship. She was constantly
referring to dear friends by their Christian names, in a casual and
familiar way, and there were so many of them that it was long
before I could distinguish them and fit them in their right
places.</p>

<p>The first approach to real confidence came from her side. One
day she burst into my study, and for no obvious reason and with few
preliminaries told me how she was, or had been, in love with one of
the leading spirits of the New Fellowship, a friend of my own, who
had, however, shown no recognition of this attraction, or
experienced any corresponding attraction, and had now passed out of
her life, having left England altogether. This man, I may note, was
the only man she had ever experienced any such attraction to. There
were several men in love with her, for some of whom she felt real
friendship, and she had had numerous offers of marriage, but her
own feelings were not involved. Whatever passionate attractions she
had experienced were for women. How I responded to that confidence
I am unable to recall. But gradually a certain degree of intimacy
developed, without any ardour of absorption, and, so far at all
events as I was concerned, no conscious anticipation of deeper love
ahead. It seemed simply the natural growth of a sympathetic
comradeship.</p>

<p>She often referred to various episodes of her past life. She was
honest and frank; there was nothing she sought to withhold. But I
scarcely think that then, or indeed ever, I showed much inquisitive
eagerness to question her. When I first began to know Olive
Schreiner I had carefully formed with her help a complete and
orderly picture of her earlier life. I never at any time felt a
similar impulse in regard to Edith. Perhaps the very fact that she
told me, and was ready to tell me, so much made me feel that here
was an open book ever before me which I could turn to when I wished
with no need to read it through in order. The result is that it is
not possible tome, even to-day, to narrate accurately the connected
course of her life before I knew her, though she has often talked
of its phases and vividly narrated various incidents. The only note
I ever made was of her remarkable ancestry.</p>

<p>The main facts are clear. Edith Mary Oldham, as she was
christened, was born on the 9th of March, 1861, at Clayton Bridge,
Newton, in Cheshire, the only child of Samuel Oldham Lees, landed
proprietor, and Mary Laetitia Bancroft, his wife. The Lees family
were thoroughly Lancashire in type and character; the Bincrofts,
who belonged to Mottram in Cheshire, were different. It was through
the Bancrofts that Edith acquired those vivacious qualities which
made so many people regard her as Celtic. She was frequently
supposed to be Irish, which always pleased her (she used to say her
soul was Irish), but I would playfully tell her that if she was
Celtic she must be Welsh, and that always displeased her. There is
commonly supposed, however, to be much ancient Celtic blood in
Cheshire, mixed with Anglo-Frisian (Beddne states), and this must
have been the source of temperamental traits which were distinct
from the Lancashire type, and still more from that of the average
Anglo-Saxon.</p>

<p>The ancestral traits which the child of these stocks inherited
were her destiny. Her mother, who died shortly after the birth of
her only child, was, as all who knew her declared, a woman of
singular sweetness and charm, greatly loved. I can well believe it,
for her sister remains today in old age a charmingly fresh and
delightful person, and has always been much attached to the child
of the beloved Mary. The young wife met with an accident to her
head during pregnancy and, whether or not on this account, her
little daughter was born prematurely at seven months. It was
doubtless a fact of much significance, for she remained in some
degree undeveloped, in temperament as well as physically something
of a child, and with the undue nervous sensitiveness and
susceptibility of one whose textures had never had the chance of
acquiring completely normal powers of resistance to noxious
influences. Her organism always reacted too quickly and for the
most part excessively; like a child she responded to very small
doses of most drugs; she was apt to catch any disease that was
about and to suffer from it severely; at the same time she had
marvellous powers of recuperation and nearly always recovered more
rapidly than her doctors expected; even in her last illness she
seemed to be rallying wonderfully almost to the sudden end.
Notwithstanding her delicacy, she was not only muscularly strong
("a pocket Hercules," an old friend once called her), but there
were sturdy elements in her, derived from the robust, big,
long-lived yeomen of Cheshire which the Bancrofts seem to have
been, though several of her uncles&mdash;children of an austere
father&mdash;were regarded as ne'er-do-wells. She used to speak of
the peasant's blood in her&mdash;though I judge the Bancrufts to
have been of a well-to-do class&mdash;and one felt that there was
an element of that kind, a beneficial element in relation to the
other elements, at the basis of her constitution. Her mother, whom
she had never known, she worshipped throughout her life, and to the
end there was always a large portrait of her mother over her desk.
In 1898 Edith met a lady who had known her mother. "She says I'm
like my mother in eyes and hair and wit and jollity, and you should
see her face when she speaks of her! Everyone loved that
woman."</p>

<p>Towards her father her feelings were much more like hate,
although with the years she had learned to understand him better.
The Lees family of Ashton-under-Lyne in Lancashire scarcely
possessed the calm solidity which seems to have marked the
Bancrofts but possessed extraordinary vigour and energy. Edith's
great-grandfather, Oldham Lees, was evidently a remarkable man,
self-made, miserly, hard, tyrannical, but very kind to animals, so
that he would think nothing of sitting up all night with a sick
horse. He acquired much wealth, leaving £30,000 to charities and
public purposes, and £20,000 to his grandson, Samuel, Edith's
father. Silas, his son and Edith's grandfather, was, she told me, a
drunken collier who would chase his wife round the room with a
carving knife. His son Samuel, Edith's father, who inherited much
of his grandfather's money, failed to inherit the energy his father
had recklessly flung away. He was sent to the University and
acquired intellectual tastes with the love of books. He had no
ability to make money, and though he plunged into various business
schemes they were disastrous failures. It seems to have been in
connection with some such scheme that he ultimately went to
America, where he died, a fate his daughter narrowly escaped forty
years later.</p>

<p>The germs of morbidity in the father and the grandfather became
intensified in the son. He was highly eccentric in some of his ways
and habits, of angular disposition, nervous, hypochondriacal,
fastidious, irritable, cruel, one of those tortured persons who
cannot help torturing others. It was in this way that he tortured
his daughter. He seems to have been quite unable to understand
children, especially such a peculiar, sensitive, high-spirited
child as his own. He tried to break her spirit by force and
punishment, but the very opposite effect was produced. Her
individuality was heightened by opposition. At the same time he
aroused in her a deep resentment not only against himself but to
some extent against all men, which persisted through the greater
part of life, so that the mere appearance of harshness towards her
in a man, the faintest approach to the exercise of any control,
never ceased to arouse in her quite automatically the fiercest
revolt. ("Do meet me at Euston," I find in a note written seven
years after marriage, "for I long for a sight of you&mdash;a man
who has never bossed me. I should <i>kill</i> a man who ordered my
body and soul about as if it were a soup ladle.")</p>

<p>She always wished to write about the wrongs done to children,
and in her last imaginative book, <i>Love Acre,</i> she at length
introduced some of her own early feelings.</p>

<p>It is probable that she was not altogether just to her father's
memory, she had suffered too much to be just. But her suffering was
not due entirely, and not even chiefly, to her father. He had
married again. This second wife was apparently a woman of quite
ordinary intelligence and character, but she was just as unable as
her husband to be lovable or to love and comfort the wayward and
sensitive child entrusted to her care. She fell into the
traditional part of the stepmother. The violence of the father was
supplemented by the still more cutting sneers of her stepmother.
She died only a few years before Edith herself, but during all our
married life they only met once, and then only by chance. Her
stepmother on this occasion expressed a wish fora reconciliation,
but to this approach Edith, though she had long ceased to feel
hostility, could only imperfectly respond. She was throughout life
the first to seek to make up a quarrel, and the fact that even
after the lapse of forty years she was still unable to take up a
friendly relationship with her stepmother shows how deeply the
sufferings of her childhood had entered into her soul. Yet I am not
prepared to say that her sufferings were all due to her father and
her stepmother, lamentable as was their lack of comprehending love
and pathetic as it was that a child so rarely fitted to experience
both joy and pain should have had so little of the one and so much
of the other. Edith herself possessed not only an element of the
beautiful charm and sweetness of her mother, but also something of
the tortured and torturing nature of her father, while her power of
cutting and reckless sarcasm when roused probably far exceeded her
stepmother's. In childhood, as often in later life, suffering, and
even tragedy, lay for her inevitably in her own nature and the
equally inevitable reactions of that nature with the external
world.</p>

<p>The child seems to have been sent for considerable periods to
relatives, especially a grandmother, but here also, I gather, she
received little love or tenderness and suffered from neglect, even
from improper and insufficient food. At about the age of twelve her
father put her into a convent school at Manchester. The nuns were
gentle and kind; the ardent and wistful child gained her first
glimpse of peace and joy. Of course the natural result followed,
she wanted to become a Catholic and be a nun. She told her father
so. The agnostic disciple of Tyndall was horrified at this logical
result of his own action and hastened to remove his daughter from
the convent at once. The wish to be a Catholic speedily died out,
but Edith retained an affection for nuns, and she always regarded
the Roman Catholic Church as the only possible form of
Christianity; when towards the end of her life it was necessary to
take her, a little against her will, to a hospital, the only one
available chanced to be attached to a convent, and I always
remember how warmly and sweetly she greeted the sisters who
admitted her. To avoid making the same mistake again, her father
now placed her in a school near London kept by a German lady of
free-thinking opinions, a Madame Thesma, clever, though not
specially judicious. Here Edith made two or three good friends, for
life, but the education was mostly of the ordinary perfunctory sort
then accorded to middle-class girls, and, quick and clever as she
was, I do not suppose that she took the slightest interest in it.
If she acquired anything at school, it was a love of literature,
for in that the German schoolmistress was an enthusiast, and Edith
was an apt pupil. I believe that her much-scored copy of
Shakespeare, which I now cherish, dates from these days. Madame
Thesma seems also to have encouraged the attempts of her pupils to
act Shakespeare, especially <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>. Here Edith,
with her strong aptitude for drama and mimicry, seems to have been
the leader, playing the chief male parts while the chief female
parts were taken by a schoolfellow who afterward became a
successful and rather noted actress, Aida Genourl. At this period,
also, she had an enthusiastic admiration for Byron, and was much
pleased to be thought to resemble him in appearance. Whatever her
proficiency in ordinary school tasks&mdash;and I cannot believe
that it was considerable&mdash;Edith's personality and ability much
impressed her schoolmistress, who vaguely prophesied a great
future.</p>

<p>I think that it was not till some years after the time when
Edith left school that her father died, on a visit to America, in
Salt Lake City. She lived with her grandmother, going out daily to
teach pupils, and leading a rather hard and energetic life with no
home comfort. It must have been about that time, however, that a
young local doctor fell in love with her and wished to marry her.
Nothing came of this, I forgot why, but the young doctor was the
first of a series of admirers who met with no success.</p>

<p>It was at the age of twenty-one that a sum of money&mdash;jxoo,
I think&mdash;fell due to her. It seemed to her an inexhaustible
sum, and with her large ideas and lavish generosity she planned
expensive presents for everybody, so that in a very short time the
money was more than all expended. That was characteristic of an
attitude towards money which she never quite outgrew, and in the
end, indeed, it was exhibited afresh on a larger scale. She could
scarcely have been much older when she left the north to come to
London to start a girl's school at Sydenham. I have a copy of the
very correct and business-like prospectus of this school. I know
nothing of her life as a schoolmistress&mdash;a position in which
it is not easy to imagine her unless one remembers that in early
life she was much more severely strenuous and austere than on the
surface she seemed in later life&mdash;for it somehow happened that
she talked little about it, although casually she often referred
familiarly to "Girton House." In some respects, I think, she was
more of a success than I had been when circumstances thrust me into
the position of youthful headmaster of a so-called Grammar School,
and I know that on one at least of her pupils, who has achieved
high success in her own special line, she had a life-long and
gratefully remembered influence. But the final outcome seems in her
case to have been more disastrous. I imagine that she plunged into
this new scheme&mdash;as she plunged into every new scheme to the
end&mdash;with a sanguine enthusiasm, a reckless expenditure of
energy, a lavish thoroughness, which anticipated speedy and
complete success. Evidently she had an arduous struggle with
worries, anxieties, and over-work, while at the same time her mind
was developing a restless intellectual activity. In 1884 when at
Girton House she took out her ticket (which she preserved and used
to the end) for the British Museum Reading Room, and she was giving
lectures at the Crystal Palace School of Art on Mrs. Browning's
<i>Aurora Leigh</i> and similar subjects. Finally&mdash;after two
or three years, I suppose&mdash;she found herself hopelessly in
debt and she suffered a serious nervous breakdown. Then two friends
arose to save her, friends whom she ever after tenderly and
reverently loved. The first was a sweet and motherly old lady of
means, Hying at Forest Hill, Mrs. Drake, who heard of Edith's
troubles and spontaneously came forward to tide her over the period
of financial anxiety. Edith came to speak of Mrs. Drake as a
"second mother," always referring to her as "the mother," and to
regard her with affection until the old lady died at an advanced
age only a year or two before herself. The other friend was Honor
Brooke, the eldest daughter of the Rev. Stopford Brooke. I do not
know how they met, but I know that Miss Brooke, with a
self-sacrificing devotion and skill that called out Edith's deep
love, nursed her back to health, brought her into cheerful and
cultured society&mdash;opening to her the charming refinements of
the Brookes' house in Manchester Square, a notable intellectual
centre&mdash;and turned her renascent energies into channels of
social work in the slums. But recovery was not speedy, even with
the aid of the wise old Harley Street physician, Birch, who
understood her so well, and Edith often referred to the tortures
she endured when occupying a little garret near Manchester Square.
In that breakdown she suffered much from a horror of being alone,
especially at night&mdash;she desired someone within call, though
not in the same room&mdash;a horror which she felt indeed in more
or less degree all through life, and when ill or run-down she was
always liable to fits of nervous terror in the early morning, when
it was imperative for her to have some loved person to whom she
could cling convulsively and be unashamed of her weakness; she
specially dreaded my absence at such times for I was the person
with whom she could be most completely herself. There were some
people to whom she seemed to be as brave as a lion. But that
appearance covered an abyss of terrors of all kinds. She learnt to
take life gaily, but life was often a great struggle. "Courage is a
habit," she would say aloud, as an injunction to herself, when
faced by some difficult duty. How often have I heard her! It was a
saying she had learnt from Stopford Brooke.</p>

<p>Stopford Brooke's house in Manchester Square, I have said, was
now freely open to her. Her work in the slums was here supplemented
by the enlarging and refining influence of contact with the stream
of notable personages in art and literature, prominent politicians,
active social reformers, which entered this genial and
liberal-minded preacher's door. It was to her not only a house of
comfort, of physical and spiritual edification, it was here, as
already mentioned, that she met Percival Chubb and so was put on to
the path which henceforth she followed to the end.</p>

<p>To return to my narrative, we had begun to feel a personal
though not yet clearly defined relationship growing up between us.
It grew up the more easily and imperceptibly because while she had
no intimate men friends I had no intimate women friends, now that
Olive Schreiner was in South Africa, scarcely indeed any woman
friend who was more than an acquaintance. It was 'natural,
therefore, that we should go together to attractions that drew us
both, notably to concerts, music-halls, and to Ibsen's plays which
were just beginning to be performed in London, less often, I think,
to see pictures&mdash;in which she was always less eagerly
interested than I was, although ever deeply moved by the beauty of
the actual world&mdash;and never, I am quite sure, to scientific
meetings. Occasionally we went to a restaurant together. One of the
earliest of these occasions she never forgot, for she used to sat,
half playfully, that I had broken down her resistance to luxury by
giving her lager beer at lunch in a restaurant near Oxford Circus
and then taking her to Bu szard's for an ice. She was also half
serious, however absurd it may appear. I was myself too absorbed in
other interests, not to say too destitute of means, ever to lead
either myself or anyone else into paths of luxury. But I was not
altogether indifferent. Edith had hitherto been both austere and
indifferent with regard to eating and drinking. The early hardness
of her life had been succeeded by a long period of idealistic
endeavour which left no thought for such needs as other than mere
necessities. When at last her attention was called to the subject
in the early Fellowship days, especially when in close touch with a
group of ascetic Russian idealists, the noble Frey and others, she
was led to adopt a vegetarian diet with a predominance of fruit and
nuts; it was a diet at that time favoured by many ardent social
reformers, and she preached it to her friends with all her
characteristic conviction. She had largely given it up before I
began to know her well, but she used to tell how some years later
she found a friend practising it and asked her who had persuaded
her to adopt such a diet. "Why, you did!" replied her aggrieved
friend. But a change slowly came over Edith's tastes in this
matter. As time went on, though still able to live simply, she
cared more for good food, for wines and liqueurs, more than was at
any time the case with me; when she travelled, especially in
France, she would note methods of cooking that appealed to her, she
would learn from accomplished friends, and she slowly trained
Priscilla, the Cornish maid who was with us longest, into an
admirable cook. It was by no means merely a matter of luxury. With
her energetic yet nervous and easily exhausted constitution,
nothing made so much difference as food and wine. This was so even
in illness and, sometimes against medical advice, rumpsteak and a
glass of Burgundy proved more beneficial than slops, and a lobster
salad, as she used herself to say, was always more digestible than
milk. But in our early days together the influence of the old habit
was still strong and we were little concerned with these things of
the table.</p>

<p class="caption">Edith Lees, a Few Months before her Marriage</p>

<p>Our talk was much more of the fundamental problems of marriage.
Concerning the economic basis of the relations between men and
women we had, I think, already begun to speak as we walked along
the beach at Porthmear. Our opinions on that point were from the
first identical. We both alike firmly believed that the social
equality of men and women should involve an economic equality in
marriage, each partner thus preserving independence. Practically,
moreover, in our own case, should the question of marriage arise,
we found that this was the only basis possible, for we each had an
income of about the same size&mdash;in my case earned, in hers
unearned&mdash;and sufficient only for one person in our own walk
of life, so that it would not have been possible for me to support
her. We were prepared, in a playful yet serious spirit&mdash;in
which she took the initiative&mdash;to be most exact and thorough
in our division of expenses, and she used to declare, whether or
not with truth, that we divided the cost of the wedding-ring, which
we went together to Hatton Garden to buy. That ring she wore to the
end, even when we seemed to be separated. To the end also, as
throughout, she insisted on her freedom and independence, sometimes
indeed exaggerating it, alike in fact and in statement. The
principle seems a sound one, and I should hesitate to admit that my
faith in it has wavered. Yet I cannot say that in our case it
proved a success. In practice it gave greater scope to her than to
me, because of her greater practical energy, of her more impetuous
impulse and swifter decision. It enabled her to live out her own
life in great freedom, and therein I often benefited, but it also
led her into many mistakes from which I also, and sometimes
chiefly, suffered. Again and again it would happen that, on her own
initiative, with all the ardent precipitancy of her nature, she
would take up a new scheme, without waiting even a day to consult
me, and I could scarcely, refuse, even when she left me free to
refuse, to take up my share of all the burden, which sometimes
proved grievous, for she was ever sanguine and never able to count
all the cost of any undertaking. The result was that during the
whole of our married life we were rarely free from some degree of
worry over money, and the fact that we were both honourable and
scrupulous in money affairs, and both belonged to families which
had always lived within their means, made this still less easy to
bear. During the first half or more of our life together the strain
was about fairly divided though it was she rather than I who
determined the level of our expenses. But during later years not
only were her frequent serious illnesses a source of expense, but
after she had given up farming and lecturing, novels and plays
seemed to be holding out promises of success and, with her usual
eager confidence, she anticipated and outran these prospects, so
that while her income increased her expenses still more increased.
Thus it came about that all the unused balance of my income, which
was also beginning to increase, was always transferred to her, and
my share of the expenses was henceforth constantly supplemented by
gifts and, in every emergency, a loan. These loans were always
increasing to the end, and she always meant to repay; I am sure,
indeed, that there was never a moment&mdash;for death came too
suddenly for her to realise it&mdash;when she doubted she would and
could repay them. She never realised that all she left behind her
would not even suffice to settle the current bills of tradesmen she
had left unpaid, to say nothing of loans. In these ways it came
about that throughout our life together she was able in perfect
good faith to declare emphatically that we were living in
accordance with the principle of complete economic independence of
husband and wife, while yet the reality was quite otherwise, and
though, as I continue to affirm, the principle holds good, in our
particular case a more old-fashioned principle would have worked
out more happily. At the same time it must not be supposed that the
financial difficulties which so often worried us were due to any
careless or even, one may say, unbusinesslike habits in Edith's way
of carrying out the joint functions she so largely arrogated. She
was a good household manager and organiser; by family tradition, as
she would say, "house proud"&mdash;no one could make a room look
charming with less expenditure of money or efforts or in a shorter
space of time&mdash;and she was wonderfully successful in the
difficult task of drawing the best out of servants and often of
winning their attachment; her quick and alert mind was singularly
apt to drive a good bargain, though she would often give more than
she promised; she never failed in doing well whatever she took in
hand, so long as will and strength remained to carry it through;
she impressed even business people as a singularly good woman of
business. She was careful and methodical in her accounts, always
balanced the results of each undertaking separately, to show
profits and losses, and for many years kept a minute daily record
of the smallest expenses&mdash;a task I have never once in my Life
attempted. The fatal lack seems to have been in the eager
impulsiveness of spirit which could seldom see more than one side
of a project and failed in the foresight necessary to measure the
path to the desired goal. Therein I could have been helpful, had
she been willing&mdash;which was rarely, as she had no faith in my
business qualities&mdash;to accept a more cautious estimate of
possibilities.</p>

<p>There was another essential point we discussed: the legal form
and ceremony of marriage. On that point also we were at one after
we had adjusted our slightly different points of view. We neither
of us felt any personal need for an ecclesiastical sanction of
marriage. That was a standpoint common to both of us which we took
for granted. I do not know how or when she had reached it, but I
think it may be regarded as implicitly assumed, although not
explicitly stated, in the principles of the New Fellowship. It is
true that at the moment when our friendship began to become more
intimate than mere friendship she was for a short time troubled at
the possibility of a too cheap or merely temporary relationship,
and that (as I find by our correspondence) I had at first said that
I thought marriage good neither for her nor for me. I never
repeated the remark. We both regarded marriage as sacred and
inviolable, but as the primary concern of the two persons who
entered on that union, though also (as she at the time specially
insisted) a matter that concerned the State. But it is one thing to
cherish faith in an abstract social creed, and quite another to
propose to carry it into immediate practice. On that point also we
were, from the first, as one. I had never proposed to myself a free
marriage union as a practical possibility, and I certainly should
not have proposed it to her. The alternative could only be between
an entirely private intimacy&mdash;then a form of sexual union
opposed to her feelings and ideas&mdash;and a recognised legal
union. We were both in relations of friendship&mdash;though quite
independently&mdash;with Karl Marx's brilliant and attractive
daughter, Eleanor, who had formed a free and open union with Dr.
Aveling, and I expect that that union, which later on ended
tragically, hardly seemed to us an enticing example to follow. In
any case we accepted, without dispute on either side, the practical
necessity of marriage. At the same time our convictions on marriage
were by no means merely Platonic. Edith was always prepared to
uphold those who thought it right to reject the legal form of
marriage. A woman, indeed, who became one of her chief friends, and
mine, had maintained this position, in spite of her husband's
entreaties to make the union legal, although, it is true, without
admitting the facts to the world. In our own case, also, we both
felt, as the years went on, with increasing conviction, that the
difficult path of life might have been in some ways easier to us,
if we had refrained from placing on ourselves the arbitrary fetters
of law which it is now so hard for those who love each other
tenderly to have struck off, even when there may be good reasons
for legal independence.</p>

<p>As our resolve to marry thus began to take definite shape, there
was another yet more intimate question to discuss: the question of
parentage. This also was a question over which I cannot recall that
we had the slightest dispute, though considerable discussion, for
we were at first much in doubt. At that time the problems of
eugenics had hardly cone to the front, and I had taken no active
interest in them. But (as my book on the criminal shows) I regarded
heredity as a matter of serious concern and fully realised the
responsibilities of parenthood, while at the same time I had no
keen anxiety for parentage, even apart from the fact that I
scarcely felt myself in the economic position to become a father.
Edith also, at that time, although always sensitive to the beauty
of motherhood, seems to have had no overpowering desire for a
child. We were, therefore, able to discuss the matter with fair
impartiality, as a question of her health and ancestry, since my
heredity was as nearly as possible perfect, and my
health&mdash;with due allowance for an intellectual worker's
nervous hyperaesthesia&mdash;would pass all ordinary tests. In
resolving this difficulty we were both much influenced by the
opinion of her Harley Street physician, Dr. Birch. No one had ever
studied her so thoroughly and so minutely, or understood her so
well, as this clever old doctor. Up to her death she would still
take at times, and with benefit, a drug he had prescribed. I
believe that she first came into his hands after her breakdown at
Sydenham a few years before I met her, and it was then that his
very thorough examination took place. "I study you," he said, "as I
study the Bible," and he was a religious old man. Although there
was evidently no hint of indecorum, there was (before
psycho-analytic days) something rather unconventional in such
minute study of a patient; and that he realised this I judge by a
question he asked her about my attitude to him when she told him of
her approaching marriage. She had not gone to consult him about the
advisability of marriage; he had told her his opinion on that point
before any question of marriage had arisen. That opinion was that
she ought not to marry, but that if she should marry she certainly
ought not to have children. At the same time he had told her that
he believed she would never find her way to the lunatic asylum, but
that if she were ever to enter it she would never come out again.
That saying was often sadly in my mind during the last tragic
months of her life. So also was a remark made earlier by Mrs. James
Hinton's daughter Margaret, who sometimes went to Bethlem Hospital
to play the piano to the women patients, and when asked what they
were like replied that some of them were "like that Miss Lees."
Those words, which I never repeated, clung to my mind, and some
thirty years later there actually was, at one moment, a question
whether "that Miss Lees" should be taken to Bethlem. We decided to
accept Birch's advice against children, and there was no protest on
Edith's part. But, it must be added, she always disliked the idea
of any kind of what seemed to her unnatural union, and that dislike
soon became stronger and had a significant bearing on our
relationship. Many years later, when it was too late to reverse the
decision against maternity without grave risks, she sometimes
regretted it. But, much as I have sometimes wished that it had
seemed possible to risk parentage, I have not wavered in my belief
that the wisest decision was made. Even if she were physically apt
for maternity, and in most respects she certainly was, her
inherited nervous instability would have involved serious risks to
herself, and possibly still more on the child to whom it was passed
on, perhaps in an exaggerated form, through my contribution of
nervous excess. Moreover, while she possessed many maternal
aptitudes I doubt whether she was adapted to be a good mother
unless perchance the discipline of maternity trained the abrupt
irregularity of her moods. Much as she liked children, she could
not endure them for long, and it was a sore trial to her to stay
long with friends who had young children; it was only with animals
that her patience was inexhaustible. So that, much as there always
is in life to regret, I am thankful still to feel that, in this
matter at all events, what seemed best to do was done.</p>

<p>That I am here fairly representing the spirit of reasonableness
in which I approached marriage is confirmed by a letter which I
received in this year of our union from my oldest and nearest
friend Angus Mackay, to whom I had, perhaps first of all, confided
my approaching marriage. He had himself married happily a few years
earlier. "I am sure," he wrote, "from your account of the matter,
that you are making your choice on wise principles&mdash;principles
too seldom taken into account, and hence the marriages which are
failures and the marriages which are humdrum and commonplace. Add
the unions founded merely on passion to those made fir money or
position, and who can wonder at the great and bitter cry of married
men and women? Their fate is the outcome of laws which never shall
be broken, and the whip with which they are scourged is of their
own making."</p>

<p>It is in my temperament, however passionate beneath the
surface&mdash;and, as Edith used to say, "restless
underneath"&mdash;to be reasonable and cautious, hesitant in
action, not apt to be moved by impulse or to reveal the impulse I
feel. But on this or other accounts, I should perhaps say here,
there were many to whom I scarcely seemed a desirable husband. Some
of Edith's friends, and even of mine, when she announced to them
her approaching marriage, exclaimed, actually or in effect: "That
man!" One or two, not indeed speaking from any definite knowledge
of me, warned her against the marriage. This must have been a
little disconcerting to her. But she was far too true and deep, too
independent as well, to be moved by these protests, though, later
on, there were moods in which she recalled to me the warnings she
had once received.</p>

<p>There was another discovery, I may here remark, which she made
in the course of these announcements of her marriage: one or two
men friends, with whom she had been good comrades without being in
the least in love, had apparently been in love with her. This seems
to have been so with William Clarke, the finest journalist of that
day in the advanced Liberal and Democratic camp, and a Fabian
economist as well. He had been interested almost from the first in
the New Fellowship though he never actually joined it. He knew and
admired Thomas Davidson, and when Davidson died he wrote one of his
best articles in the <i>Spectator</i> (later included in the
posthumous volume of his miscellaneous writings) on "A Modern
Wandering Scholar." I had met him and known him from the day of his
first meeting with Davidson when I walked away from the house with
him afterwards. From that time he took much interest in me and in
my work; in the <i>Echo,</i> a few years later, after my first book
appeared, he published an article on me as one of the men of the
day, the first of that sort I ever received. I, on my side, had
invited him to contribute a book on economics to the Contemporary
Science Series, though, being a busy journalist, he eventually had
to hand this over to his friend, J. A. Hobson. Edith doubtless
began to know him when she became secretary of the Fellowship. He
was nearly ten years older, a man of neurotic temperament somewhat
like her own, a creature of moods, of profound depressions, of
frequent illnesses, with an organism full of toxins, probably with
high blood pressure such as she later showed, and dying ultimately
of the same disease of diabetes. Their social ideals and
aspirations were singularly alike, and held with a like fervour and
sincerity. But her temperament was much more buoyant, inspiring,
and genial in personal intercourse. It was therefore natural that
he should often come and spend hours in her rooms, frequently
arriving in the deepest dejection and going away a totally
different man. There was no suggestion of love; into her mind at
all events the idea had never entered. But when one day she met him
in Gray's Inn and gaily announced her approaching marriage he
suddenly changed countenance, she told me, and seemed to have been
struck a great blow. From that moment he ceased to seek to meet
her, and he avoided me; I believe I never saw and scarcely heard
from him again, and he no longer took any friendly interest in my
books, though it is not likely that my later books would in any
case have appealed to him. Edith heard indirectly, a little later
on, that he had been suffering from "an emotional shock." He never
married and died ten years later.</p>

<p>It may seem to some that the spirit in which we approached
marriage was not that passionate and irresistible spirit of
absolute acceptance which seems to them the ideal. Yet we both
cherished ideals, and we seriously strove to mould our marriage as
near to the ideal as our own natures and the circumstances
permitted. It was certainly not a union of unrestrainable passion;
I, though I failed yet clearly to realise why, was conscious of no
inevitably passionate sexual attraction to her, and she, also
without yet clearly realising why, had never felt genuinely
passionate sexual attraction for any man. Such preliminary
conditions may seem unfavourable in a romantic aspect. Yet in the
end they proved, as so many conventionally unpromising conditions
in my life have proved, of inestimable value, and I can never be
too thankful that I escaped a marriage of romantic illusions.
Certainly, I was not a likely subject to fall victim to such a
marriage.</p>

<p>The union was thus fundamentally at the outset, what later it
became consciously, a union of affectionate comradeship, in which
the specific emotions of sex had the smallest part, yet a union, as
I was later to learn by experience, able to attain even on that
basis a passionate intensity of love. It was scarcely so at the
outset, although my letters to her in the early years are full of
yearning love and tender solicitude. We were neither of us in our
first youth. I was able to look on marriage as an experiment which
might, or might not, turn out well. On her part it was, and
remained to the end, a unique and profound experience which she
never outgrew. Yet had anything happened to prevent the marriage it
is not likely that either of us would then have suffered from a
broken heart. The most passionate letters I wrote her were, as she
realised, not written until some years after marriage. I can
honestly say that by a gradual process of increased knowledge and
accumulated emotional experience I am far more in love with her
today than twenty-five years ago.</p>

<p>Yet to both of us our marriage seemed then a serious affair, and
with the passing of the years it became even more tremendously
serious. She, at heart distrustful of her own powers of attraction,
would from time to time be assailed by doubts&mdash;though such
doubts were in conflict with her more rooted convictions&mdash;that
she was not my fit mate, that I realised this, and that it might be
best if we separated in order to enable me to marry someone else.
This was never at any moment my desire. Much as each of us suffered
through marriage I have never been convinced that our marriage was
a mistake. Even if in some respects it might seem a mistake, it has
been my belief, deepened rather than diminished, that in the
greatest matters of life we cannot safely withdraw from a mistake
but are, rather, called upon to conquer it, and to retrieve that
mistake in a yet greater development of life. It would be a sort of
blasphemy against life to speak of a relationship which like ours
aided great ends as a mistake, even if, after all, it should in a
sense prove true that we both died of it at last. Each of us
exhibited a constant process of spiritual and intellectual
development during the whole of that quarter of a century of close
intimacy. My own work in life had been more or less definitely
planned before I knew her, yet it was altogether carried out, and
to a more triumphant conclusion than at the outset I had ever
imagined, during my fellowship with her.</p>

<p>She on her part was developing during all that period, and she
only attained the complete adult maturity of her spiritual and
intellectual powers a year or two before the end. Though I failed
at first to perceive that she was the most difficult woman in the
world to marry, I always knew that she was unique; and though there
were other qualities I craved from a woman which she could not
give, yet those other qualities had their chief value, I always
well knew, in supplementing hers and could never replace what she
had to give. She was far more to me than a "liberal education" to
enrich, she was also a constant discipline to fortify. The presence
of her naked and vital spirit moved my more dreaming and aloof
spirit to a realisation of the fundamental facts of living which
has been beyond all estimation. In some respects I am what she has
made of me.</p>

<p>On her part, again, although she, too, craved qualities which I
could not give, and which I never grudged her finding in others,
she yet always affirmed, and never denied, that I was the one
person in the world who understood her, and it was on me that in
all moments of difficulty or terror she instinctively called. That
she altogether realised how entirely in this matter my attitude was
the counterpart of her own I do not positively affirm, nor even
that I made great efforts to explain my attitude, for in such
matters I have always held that protestations are suspect, and even
worthless, and that what cannot be divined must be left. Moreover
in matters of love I have ever been shy of promises, always so
facile, always so meaningless; I can honestly say that my
performances excelled my promises. Certainly it was so in the deep
sense with marriage. At the outset it seemed to me&mdash;though
never, I think, to her&mdash;as possibly only an experiment. It was
an experiment to such an extent that to many if not most people it
might seem no marriage at all. Yet it was a relationship so deep
and so binding, so gripping the heart by its tenderness, and so
compelling the whole being by the intensity of its spiritual
passion, that the thought of any second relationship of the same
kind seemed a sort of sacrilege. It is probable, however, that this
feeling largely rests on the ritual formality which surrounds
marriage and sets it apart, making it appear a a unique
relationship. It is always possible for me to imagine a more or
less sexual relationship with another woman which sprang from a
scarcely less deep root, for the varieties of relationships are
indefinite. But to repeat in exact detail a relationship, the
closest of all, which had seemed and remained unique, to repeat
publicly to another person the old formula of binding words, to
place on another hand the same kind of ring, to confer on another
the same right to bear the precisely same name before the
world&mdash;all that, however tenderly I might love the new person,
seems to arouse within me a deep repulsion. It may be an artificial
feeling, not lying in the essence of things, but only in
conventions. Yet it remains.</p>

<p>When I turn to my pocket diary for 1891 and to the letters we
wrote to each other at that time&mdash;for, unknown to each other,
we both preserved probably all of these early letters though later
letters were by both more often destroyed&mdash;I can reconstruct
much that took place during the months preceding our formal
marriage. The letters are fairly numerous, for she went down
several times for a few weeks to the little cottage at Carbis Bay
(she had taken it in the autumn from a woman artist friend) which
later became our first Cornish home, while I during the spring was
away fora month with Arthur Symons in Provence and on to Spain, the
first of many visits to that country, entering by Barcelona and
emerging by San Sebastian. My letters indeed were not usually dated
except by the day of the week, and she never preserved the
envelopes which might have proved the date; but hers were nearly
always carefully dated, as well as sealed when specially private,
for, with some ground, she was suspicious of country post offices.
I always preserved the envelopes, so that on the whole the letters
present a fairly clear and continuous record.</p>

<p>It is with the opening of 1891 that they become increasingly
numerous. At first just frank and friendly, she sometimes signed
"Your little comrade Edith," not dealing with matters of special
intimacy, and showing a certain quiet reserve and restraint. As our
relations slowly grew closer this diminished. Notwithstanding her
idealistic and high-pitched temperament, with that union of
opposites which is found in complex natures there is nothing
high-flown or extravagant in these letters. She realises the grave
and serious changes that are going on within her, there is no
over-rating either of me or of herself, and she warns me repeatedly
of her "moods and morbidities," of which yet indeed I had seen
little. Then, and ever, she felt humbly about herself at heart,
however arrogant and domineering she could be on the surface, far
too proud to let the world guess her humility. In reply I assured
her that I could bear with the morbid&mdash;having perhaps a trace
of it in myself&mdash;better than with the commonplace.</p>

<p>In June a crisis occurred. During the previous month, while
still signing herself my "comrade," marriage already seemed to be
glimmering in the distance, for in that month she wrote happily to
me from Carbis, where she was staying with her perhaps dearest
friend of those days, Flo Kneller, a school friend, a woman of fine
intelligence and serious character, happily married, who died not
long after in India to Edith's great grief: "In the long years we
shall be able to know each other in trust and love," and she added
that her idea of marriage was "the deepest sympathy possible with
all chance for each individual to remain an individuality."</p>

<p>"It is the deep cool wells of life that bring real peace," she
had written in May, "and I'm glad I've found you. It is much more
likely, Havelock, that you will sigh one day when your little
comrade is in one of her erratic moods. I'm a queer-grained
creature and you are a different cast of soul&mdash;please know how
wicked and cross and surly I am, and like me in spite of it."</p>

<p>But in June there was for a moment what seemed on the surface a
revulsion. Evidently an inner conflict had been going on, though I
had seen no signs of it. She felt herself drifting into a
relationship such as she had never in her life known before; she
felt it was threatening to affect her freedom and independence; she
felt, at the same time, that it was not clear to her whether I
viewed that relationship as seriously and sacredly as she viewed
it. So, for the first time, she wrote me a courageously
straightforward letter in which she set forth her own nature and
needs, her inability to accept symbols in place of realities, or a
part in place of the whole, and her own ideal of a complete and
permanent union of body and soul. She declared that that was the
ideal she must remain true to, however romantic and visionary it
might possibly seem to me, and that, much as the relationship with
me meant, she must renounce it if I was not at one with her on this
fundamental point. I was a little hurt at the abrupt and hostile
shape assumed by the suppressed conflict which thus suddenly
appeared at the surface. At this she was much grieved, and the very
next day she wrote me a tender and beautiful letter to explain, and
to assure me how near she was: "I rest in you deep down, but the
strangeness and the wonder of things is on me."</p>

<p>Evidently there really was a certain difference of attitude
towards this vital question. I held that an intimate personal
relationship need not necessarily be open to the world, that the
State was only concerned with it when the question of children
arose, and that the formality of marriage should consecrate an
existing relationship rather than be set up irrevocably before it
could ever be ascertained that a real relationship was possible.
She, as she admitted in another letter of about the same date, was
in this, as well as in some other matters of belief, more
"old-fashioned." But the difference was not fundamental. She, with
increased knowledge and experience, became less and less
"old-fashioned;" I, while not changing my convictions, became, with
the growth of years, more and more tolerant of the "old-fashioned"
view. In a few years' time there was not the slightest difference
between our views of marriage. The approximation began and ended
with this very letter, and, as I now look back, it seems to me that
the letter was in part the dying protest of outgrown traditions,
the loss of which still caused her some alarm. The letter from
which I now quote was, I believe, called out by her attitude at
this time, and was perhaps the most difficult and deliberate letter
I ever addressed to her; this is even indicated by the fact that I
carefully dated it: 13 June, 1891.</p>

<p class="quote">We have never needed any explanations before, and
that has always seemed so beautiful to me, that we seemed to
understand instinctively. And that is why I've never explained
things that perhaps needed explaining. This is specially so about
Olive. I have never known anyone who was so beautiful and
wonderful, or with whom I could be so much myself, and it is true
enough that for years to be married to her seemed to me the one
thing in the world that I longed for, but that is years ago. We are
sweet friends now and always will be; but to speak in the way you
do of a 'vital relationship' to her sounds to me very cruel.
Because one has loved somebody who did not love one enough to make
the deepest human relationship possible, is that a reason why one
must always be left alone? I only explain this to show that I am
really free in every sense&mdash;perhaps freer than you&mdash;and
that I haven't been so unfair to you as you seem to think. The
thing I wanted to tell you about that has been bothering me was
this: I had to decide whether it was possible for me to return the
passionate love of someone whom I felt a good deal of sympathy
with, and even a little passionate towards. She would have left me
absolutely free, and it hurt me to have to torture her. But I had
no difficulty in deciding; the real, deep and mutual understanding,
which to me is more than passion, wasn't there, and the thought I
had constantly in my mind was that my feeling towards you, although
I do not feel passionate towards you (as I thought you understood),
was one that made any other relationship impossible. I wonder if
you will understand that.<br>
<br>
Now I've got to explain what I feel about our relationship to each
other&mdash;and that will be all! Perhaps the only thing that needs
explaining is about the absence of passionate feeling. I have
always told you that I felt so restful and content with you, that
the restless, tormenting passionate feeling wasn't there; and I
have seen that you didn't feel passionate towards me, but have said
over and over again that you didn't believe in passion. So we are
quite equal, and why should we quarrel about it? Let us just be
natural with each other&mdash;leaving the other feeling to grow up
or not, as it will. It is possible to me to come near you and to
show you my heart, and it is possible to you to come near me; and
(to me at least) that is something so deep and so rare that it
makes personal tenderness natural and inevitable, or at all events
right.<br>
<br>
In reference to marriage: I said (or meant) that I did not think
either you or I were the kind of people who could safely tie
ourselves legally to anyone; true marriage, as I understand it, is
a union of soul and body so close and so firmly established that
one feels it will last as long as life lasts. For people to whom
that has come to exist as an everyday fact of their lives, then the
legal tie may safely follow; but it cannot come beforehand. I have
seen so much of unhappy marriages&mdash;which all started
happily&mdash;and I do not think anything on earth could induce me
to tie myself legally to anyone with whom I had not&mdash;perhaps
for years&mdash;been so united in body and soul that separation
would be intolerable. Surely, Edith, you, too, understand that you
<i>can't</i> promise to give away your soul for life, that you
can't promise to love for ever <i>beforehand.</i> Haven't you
learnt this from your own experience?<br>
<br>
I don't think I've anything more to explain. Now it your turn, and
then we'll have a rest from explaining. I've told you simply and
honestly how I stand towards you. I took it for granted before that
everything I have said was what you could have said too. Tell me
where you don't feel with me, and tell me quite honestly, as I have
told you, how you feel towards me. We aren't so young that we need
fear to face the naked facts of life simply and frankly. You know
how much you are to me&mdash;exactly how much. Putting aside Olive,
I have never loved anyone so deeply and truly, and with the kind of
love that seemed to make everything possible and pure, and even my
relationship to Olive has not seemed so beautiful and unalloyed as
my relationship to you. It has seemed to me that we might perhaps
go on becoming nearer and nearer, and dearer and dearer, to each
other as time went on. My nature isn't of the passionately
impetuous kind (though it's very sensuous) and my affections grow
slowly, and die hard, if at all. Even as it is, we shall be dear
comrades as long as we live. You have hurt me rather, but I don't
mind because there mustn't be anything false, and our relationship
is strong enough to bear a good deal of tugging. Havelock.</p>

<p>Hardly a conventional love-letter perhaps, but with far more
truth in it than such letters usually hold; and when I read it once
more long years afterwards I know its truth far more deeply than I
possibly could when I wrote it.</p>

<p>The letter which perhaps embodied my first reaction to her
letter of doubt and questioning is that which now follows, and I
give it in full because it was also one of the most serious letters
I ever addressed to her, and its effect seems to have been
decisive. It begins abruptly:</p>

<p class="quote">Monday night. I have been trying to work, but I
can only think of that letter you wrote this morning. It's not
exactly what you say about marriage; I am not quite clear (on
reading it carefully) what your point is there, nor whether we
really differ: and as to dreams, you must surely know that I am at
<i>least</i> as much of a dreamer as you; but it's the heartless,
antagonistic way you write. I thought I understood you, but this I
don't understand: how you could write <i>that</i> letter on
Saturday night and then&mdash;before we have even seen each
other&mdash;<i>this</i> on Monday morning. I feel as though I had
given my heart to a thoughtless, petulant child to play with.<br>
<br>
You are a child, Edith, much more of a child than even I am. I will
be comrades with you as much as you like, and talk as frankly with
you as you like, about marriage or anything else, but it seems to
me now that until you have won <i>for yourself</i> a real knowledge
and experience of life and of love, and realise how <i>serious</i>
a thing love is, that it goes far deeper than our theories and our
dreams&mdash;until then, it seems to me now, there cannot be
between us any possibility of a deeper relationship than
comradeship. Your instincts have always seemed to me so true and
sound that I thought they could teach you everything; but nothing
does instead of life itself...An ordinary woman can become the
reflection of any man she comes near to; but you are not an
ordinary woman, and if you were I should be absolutely indifferent
to you...Oh, if you had only gained the insight which would enable
you to understand! How is it that you seem to come so near to me,
and that then directly afterwards I find you so far off? But you
are growing, you <i>will</i> grow; and by the time you can
understand the love I give you, you will deserve far more than I
can give...But, however this may be, I still love you the
same&mdash;love you enough to be content to be merely a step to
help you toward the experience that you need. H.<br>
<br>
I know you didn't mean it, Edith; it's only that you've somehow
failed to sympathise and understand.</p>

<p>That letter represents my natural and fundamental reactions to
her recurring sudden and extreme transitions of mood, though now I
scarcely recognise myself in it. At a later period I should have
written more tenderly and could not have set the matter forth with
such self-possessed precision. But the letter had its effect. She
seems to have carried it about with her; it is well worn, as is
also that previously quoted, and long after, once or twice at
least, she referred humbly to the remarks about the "step," and
said that if I were only a step it was indeed a golden stairway.
Her faith was reasured; her doubts were removed. Henceforth a new
tone appears in her letters. The old reserve for ever disappeared,
to give place not to any reckless abandonment, but to a deep and
restful trust. From this time on, although no change had taken
place in our relations, she now and then addressed me as "My
Husband" or signed herself "Your Wifie."</p>

<p>"I will never leave you&mdash;I know you will never leave me,"
she wrote in a letter of this period. It was a true intuition, and
during the quarter of a century that followed it never ceased to be
true, though she herself may sometimes have doubted it, and the
faith of both of us was sorely tried.</p>

<p>The two following letters from me, each written on a Sunday,
seem to come soon after the foregoing:</p>

<p class="quote">"Thank you for your true, beautiful letter which
is good for me. Now I think we understand each other. Let us always
be perfectly frank; it is best, even if a little hard at first. We
shall grow slowly to know each other perfectly. There is no need to
be in a hurry: that only spoils it. No human relationship is
perfect: one human being can't give another quite everything that
it craves for, but you and I can give each other what is most
precious to us, and that is a great central fact; it makes us
belong to each other. Life doesn't happen according to our dreams;
it happens quite differently, but it's often much more beautiful
and wonderful. I sometimes fear that you are a little too
enthusiastic&mdash;too romantic (shall I say?). You mustn't be,
dear; it may hide the real beauty of things."</p>

<p>And in the next:</p>

<p class="quote">"It was so lovely to have you today, and it's left
a sweet joyous feeling behind. It's good to lie close and restful
and feel the clinging tendrils that grow up slowly from one to
another and are always binding one closer. Do you have that sort of
feeling?&mdash;But it's rather horrible about the other people, I'm
so afraid that I make it awkward and unhappy for you. It's very
pathetic when one thinks of it, that people think it wrong and
unnatural for two persons to learn to know each other before they
think of binding themselves together for ever.&mdash;Marry
<i>first,</i> and then you may be free to find out that you've
chosen the wrong person! One realises how that sort of pressure
works on weak young creatures and leads to so much misery.<br>
<br>
"You must really find a spare hour for us to finish our lesson of
anatomy and physiology. I'm alarmed at your ignorance! can't rest
till you have a few <i>elementary</i> ideas about the chief facts
of human life!"</p>

<p>I proceed to propose a meeting for this purpose, and in the same
sentence&mdash;characteristically it may be&mdash;a visit to a
picture gallery afterwards.</p>

<p>I may here quote a disconnected letter of hers I happen to
possess, because chronologically it comes in at this point, when we
had at last reached mutual understanding. It is addressed to Olive
Schreiner and dated July 7th. Before knowing me she had had a
prejudice against Olive Schreiner owing to absurd rumours
unsympathetically repeated to her by a man for whose opinion she
had great respect. I speedily brought her to a better knowledge and
she felt repentant for her prejudice; it was a lesson, which she
never forgot and always acted on, never to heed rumours about
people but only to judge them from personal knowledge. It was thus
that with her unquenchable faith in human nature and her strong
impulse to befriend the friendless, she many times suffered
grievous disappointment in her self-denying efforts to help those
unfortunate weak-willed but often plausible persons who sooner or
later collapse again abjectly and betray the trust put in them.</p>

<p class="quote">"Dear Olive Schreiner," she wrote, "I wish you
were here&mdash;I want to take your hands and I should like you to
kiss me. I have grown to love you, though, long ago, this would
have made me smile to think of. I feel you are very beautiful and
true and that is why I am writing to you. It is strange, and yet
natural too, that you should even care a little for me. I looked up
at you once at Chenies Street Chambers and you looked down upon
me&mdash;do you remember it? We both smiled and went away. I wish
you were here. Yours in sincerity. E.M.O.L."</p>

<p>From that time her admiration and affection for Olive remained
untouched till her death. There was never the faintest touch of
jealousy for my enduring love and regard for Olive; it seemed to
her on the contrary that that was something sacred which she should
rather seek to cherish. Olive on her part was equally loyal and
tender to the end; she was one of the small group which followed
Edith at last to the crematorium. She regarded her as a fine and
lovable personality rather than as a significant artist and
thinker, but that was characteristic of her peculiarly high
standard for measuring achievement (which yet had its lapses); I do
not think that she ranked me high, either, in any category but that
of personality.</p>

<p>I do not seem to have Olive's reply to this letter, but in a
letter of Olive's to me from Matjesfontein, dated Nov. 22nd, 1890,
I find a reference to the same incident that Edith mentions:</p>

<p class="quote">"I saw her once a long way off and liked her very
much; felt she was true. Dear, if I could be jealous of anyone,"
she continues, "it would be of you, you seem so much mine, how
could you love anyone else? And yet I want you to marry. No one
would be so glad as I, dear, if anything beautiful came to you. If
ever you have a little child you must get your wife to call her
after me!"</p>

<p>I have quoted my own letters less often and with less assurance
than Edith's because though she preserved so many, and often what
is evidently in the right order, I am unable to it them in
confidently owing to my unfortunate habit of dating them merely by
the day of the week. It is no longer clear what the letter of mine
which follows refers to, but it certainly belongs to the period
shortly before marriage. "My own darling, you must not be hurt at
what I said. I know how proud and self-reliant you are; that is
just one of the things that I love so much in you and is so
beautiful to me. But I am sure you must feel, really, that it is
good and sweet for us to share our worries as well as everything
else. There is a very lovely little chapter about love in the
<i>Imitation of Christ.</i> I must send you a translation I made of
it years ago if I can find it. Love ought to make everything
lighter for us. You mustn't quarrel with me, sweet one, for not
liking you to be selfish and keep all the worries to yourself." I
quote this passage because she always remembered and cherished that
little chapter on Love and twenty years later used part of it in
her <i>Lover's Calendar.</i> When I translated those sayings of the
old mystic I knew nothing by experience of their profound truth. It
was meet that they should have been cherished so tenderly by the
woman who was to arouse in me whatever possibilities I held of
becoming in that mystical and transcendent sense a Lover.</p>

<p>At this time she was still the Secretary of the New Fellowship,
and with the chief burden of the care and anxieties of that
"Fellowship House" at 29 Doughty Street in which she lived with a
miscellaneous assortment of people; it was an experience which
afterwards led her to parody a saying of William Morris's and to
declare that "Fellowship is Hell." Ramsay MacDonald, the Labour
leader of later years and still more recently Prime Minister, was
her chief associate in establishing this household, I think the
year before. In a novel, <i>Attainment,</i> she later wrote a
playful and more or less disguised account of some of the
adventures and worries here experienced, though she resisted the
temptation to introduce actual portraits of any inmates of the
Fellowship, except her devoted servant Ellen Taylor ("Ann"). Nor, I
am sure, though she had no wish to repeat it, would she condemn the
experiment. But, as she makes Rachel, who stands for herself, say:
"The people there were such miles beyond their preaching. All the
most beautiful things that happened there were quite
unconscious."</p>

<p>The inmates were certainly a miscellaneous crew. The oldest was
Lespinasse, a journalist and man of letters of note in a small way,
who in early days had known Carlyle and other famous men and he had
written various biographies of literary notabilities. There was
Captain Pfoundes, also elderly, a Quixotic figure of a man, who
knew and loved Japan, and went about lecturing on that subject,
apparently his sole interest, so I do not know how he came into the
Fellowship. The others were all of a younger generation: there was
Miss Agnes Henry, an active Anarchist, who was frequently visited
by the most famous Italian and international Anarchist of that day,
Malatesta, who, as I write now, forty-three years afterwards, has
recently died as a humble labourer in Rome; there was a young
Polish actress; there was a young man, I believe a clerk in a City
house, whom later the actress married; there may have been one or
two others whom I do not recall. Like-minded friends used to come
to the house; I remember the simple and saintly Russian Anarchist
who went by the name of Frey, and was held in high regard, even
veneration, by Edith; he had set up a little printing establishment
and produced the Fellowship's organ, <i>Seed time;</i> in Russia he
had been an aristocrat and a general, but had sacrificed everything
for the sake of his convictions. I also remember a tall, quiet,
grave man who was Mr. (now Lord) Olivier. There was, besides, a
fairly constant stream of strangers to interview the Secretary
concerning the aims of the Fellowship, while cranks and faddists of
various kinds haunted the place. Few people, even in the Fellowship
itself, could realise how significant a centre it was, though it
endured for so short a period, and was dissolved very soon after
Edith left it.</p>

<p>She (seconded by Ellen Taylor) had, indeed, borne the brunt of
the work in which all were supposed to take a part, though
MacDonald also accepted a considerable amount of responsibility. No
one then suspected how big a figure he was to become in the world.
His humble origins were known, and it was recognised to his credit
that he had risen to become private secretary to a member of
Parliament (Lough) and an increasingly active exponent of political
Socialism. But he had already planned his ambitious life-course.
Edith told me how he had just declared his intention of some day
becoming Prime Minister. That, be it noted, was some thirty-five
years before the goal was actually reached, and in later years
MacDonald has declaimed any anticipation of the high post to which
he has been called; yet this early ambition, to which I can bear
witness, is altogether to the credit of his pertinacious and
justified self confidence. Though his ability was recognised, this
ambition was not too seriously viewed in the Fellowship&mdash;which
upheld ideals not greatly concerned with worldly
advancement&mdash;and when in some moment of misplaced irritation
MacDonald once told Edith that she was trying to reach success by
clinging to his coat-tails she received the accusation with mixed
feelings; it had never occurred to her that that was a road to
success, and, if it had, she was of much toi proud and independent
a spirit to choose such a road. She did not, however, resent this
remark, though her admiration for him was qualified, and she was
shocked when she found that at this time he, a declared Socialist,
had written for the <i>Scottish Review</i> a pseudonymous article
on Socialism which, though not exactly an attack, was a skilfully
elaborated warning, from an assumed height of lofty superiority,
against the risks and dangers of Socialism, perhaps an early
anticipation of the attitude he was long after to assume as leader
of a National Government. They were in friendly and helpful
co-operation without either being warmly attracted to the other;
she would look after him when he was ill; apply liniments to his
back when he had lumbago; and so forth. But a certain
ungraciousness, noted in later years by his nearest colleagues,
already marked MacDonald and marred his undoubted qualities. He
never, then or later, showed any recognition of his once close and
friendly relations with this colleague, the Secretary of the New
Fellowship, and when once in later years, following her natural
impulse, Edith wrote him a letter of sympathy in a time of his
distress, no word or sign was vouchsafed to her in response.</p>

<p>We were now at one in all essentials and our future life in
common was beginning to open out before us. We resolved to
inaugurate it by spending a few days alone together in the country.
There was, however, nothing violently indecorous in our plans. It
seemed most beautiful to both of us that our first days together
should be spent at the same ravishing spot where our first real
meeting had taken place. I arranged to stay several weeks at
Lamorna when Miss Jones was away and her housekeeper in charge, and
Edith arranged to come down a little later, to spend a week with me
at Miss Jones's house and then to go on to her own cottage at
Carbis.</p>

<p>I wrote to her from Lamorna:</p>

<p class="quote">"It's very lovely here&mdash;so delicious to lie
in the sun and hear nothing except an occasional insect or bird,
and to know that our clear brother men are at a safe distance.
Burton the fisherman and his wife have pleasant recollections of
the clever little female who spent a day here with her lady's-maid,
and they were glad to hear that she is coming again. (That's the
result of kissing the dirty babies!) But they won't be so glad as I
will.&mdash;I've taken a little house (rent free) made of granite
and bracken and honeysuckle. It's a lovely little house, hidden
away from the world; the pillars of it are two huge foxglove stems
which tower up above you against the sky when you he down in it.
I've got room in my house for a little wife&mdash;but she must be
small&mdash;I've also got a nest in the rock right over the
sea&mdash;and a very, very tiny sweet bird might nestle in close
beside me there.&mdash;I've also got an ordinary rock, the same I
had last year, where I lie and bask in the sun and read or
dream."</p>

<p>The programme was carried out as arranged. (I may now add, many
years later when Agnes Jones and the husband she later married are
both dead, that it was sweet on her part to be so hospitable on
such an occasion. Some years earlier, when I was in frequent touch
with her and receiving long letters in which she told me about
Hinton whom she had known and idolised, she mistook my interest in
Hinton for a personal interest in herself which I was far from
feeling; since for me she was simply an invalidish woman of a
rather older generation who could communicate to me many
interesting facts. Hence arose a painful and embarrassing situation
which she bravely succeeded in overcoming.) Edith arrived on the
18th of July. I met her at Penzance Station and we walked to
Lamorna; that walk remains in my recollection for the prosaic
reason that I was carrying her heavy hold-all and had a severe
struggle with the steep Paul hill.</p>

<p>We always regarded this week together as our honeymoon and
always looked back to it with pleasure, though we had many later
little "honeymoons," as she liked to call them, in the years that
followed. She loved Lamorna ever after, and went there from time to
time to stay for a day or two with some dear friend at the same
house, which after Agnes Jones gave it up became an hotel. This
always happened when I was away, for that was the season when, in
my absence, friends came to stay with her; we planned to go
together more than once, but we made these plans in the
unseasonable time of winter and they never came off. Lamorna
remains to me the memory of a Paradise I never entered again. It is
much changed now, I am told, but for me the wild beauty of that
bridal place can never be changed.*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* I am not astray in speaking of the beauty of
Lamorna in those days, however now spoilt. Even some years later a
true poet, W. H. Davies, in a charming little poem, "Lamorna Cove,"
wrote: "Who ever saw more beauty under the sun?"]</p>

<p>Yet the memory is dim save at a few points. I know that we would
spend the whole of the days together, wandering along the cliffs or
the rocks, finding sweet nooks over the sea, or lying together on
fragrant mounds of heather and thyme, talking of all the problems
of life and all our plans for the future. It seems strange even to
myself, but I recall absolutely nothing of our life within doors. A
few days after she had left for Carbis, as I find by my pocket
diary, I went over to her there, but I cannot clearly recall the
visit. It is all to me a mist, but, as the mists of Cornwall may
be, a mist of beauty.</p>

<p>During the next few weeks, when she was at Carbis and I was back
in London, we wrote to each other constantly, and more intimately
than before. I quote from two letters of mine which clearly belong
to this period:</p>

<p class="quote">"My wifie, I lay on my couch this morning so happy
reading over and over my letter that was so full of love. You
mustn't have too good an opinion of me, darling, but you may be
quite sure I have the merit of loving you! And it's rioted very
deep down and I don't know what could tear it up. I don't think you
need fear, Edith, that I should ever try to sap your independence;
because, you know, I take quite a selfish delight in your
independence; it somehow appeals to the woman element in
me&mdash;and I think to the man part too. I can't imagine myself
with a wife who was just my shadow without any character or will of
her own.&mdash;No one who liked dependent women would come in your
direction!"</p>

<p>That letter, and still more the next, which may have been
written before the other, bear witness to her hyper-sensitive
independence, and the dread lest the smallest piece of advice, the
most innocently loving anxiety to know all her little doings of the
day, might be evidence of a desire to dominate hero That fear was
always ready to wake up, and was manifested even on the very last
day that I saw her conscious. I cannot recall what was the trifling
annoyance referred to in the following letter; it may have been
nothing more serious than the advice I gave her about this time to
"read a little French every day," an excellent piece of advice
which she would quote to me teasingly from time to time during all
the years that followed.</p>

<p class="quote">"I was so eager for my letter this morning, you
thought it would hurt me, but it is <i>very</i> beautiful to me. I
don't think you quite realise how much absolute truth and sincerity
are to me&mdash;the value and magnanimity of truth,' as Thoreau
says. It is very easy&mdash;to me at least&mdash;to be silent, one
can get a cheap reputation for many noble qualities in that way,
and in ordinary friendship I think it is quite right. But it is
different in the nearest relation of all; and if the time ever came
when I had to keep back <i>any</i> thought, however horrid and
disloyal&mdash;or that you had to&mdash;then I should feel that we
were very far away. Surely, my Edith, you feel that too? It is the
union and freedom of the soul that is so precious, and we cannot
give that up. <i>To be oneself</i> is just the most precious thing
that one can give to another soul. I gave you one of my moods, and
I gave it you as a mood, or rather it was something much less than
a mood, that had never for one instant taken possession of me but
only passed across me; and there was nothing in it that was not
sweet and flattering (that isn't the word!) to you&mdash;and then,
you see, you think that I am a rather contemptible creature, though
still your husband! But I should have had a feeling of untrueness
if I had done anything else&mdash;though doing it has made me feel
very humble indeed ever since. As long as I am strong enough to do
that you may be quite sure I am utterly yours. And you will learn
to understand, and you will always do so too? Will we not,
sweetest? I'll try not to ask you how the lecture and the French
are going on if it hurts you, dearest. I hadn't the least idea it
did. Once you seemed to like it. I need very much to see you and
then you will tell me all the little things I am so hungry for. *
*, I must just tear this open to put in one little word of good-bye
before I rush to the post. You do not feel hurt now, my own wife?
You will let me feel always that I can say whatever I must, and
that you won't be hurt or misunderstand? And you too? I want you so
much: I want to come and put my head on your breast and be your
child."</p>

<p>Thus we each jealously guarded, and both of us succeeded in
retaining, our independent spiritual lives. It was certainly and
obviously so with her. It was equally so with me. From the time at
the age of seven my intelligent independence began to develop and I
sought out in the library case of my father's cabin on the
<i>Empress</i> the books that suited my individual taste my mind
developed on its own lines in a many-sided interest in the world,
absorbing all that suited it from others and never itself absorbed.
But that in no way impaired our intimate emotional life, but far
otherwise.</p>

<p>I have sometimes seen in marriages of devoted couples who are
never separated that when one of them dies the survivor, beneath a
real grief, experiences a current of relief, able at last to go
freely his or her own way without the perpetual burden of little
constraints. In our relationship we were only dependent on each
other for a peculiar comradeship and affection, a special mutual
understanding. The things we gave each other were the unique things
that no other person, can ever give.</p>

<p>Edith only returned to London from Carbis at the end of
September. She was much occupied at this time in preparing a
lecture of Socialist tendency she was to give to the Ancoats
Brotherhood* in Manchester in November: "The Masses and the
Classes: A Plea." This may not have been her first important
lecture to a large audience but it was certainly the first of her
writings to be printed separately.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* It so chances that as I revise these pages
in September, 1933, the death of Charles Rowley ("Rowley of
Ancoats"), the founder and director of that famous Brotherhood, is
announced in the London <i>Times,</i> at the age of ninety-four. He
was the champion of the poor of Manchester and influential in
obtaining for them the best higher educational opportunities,
notably by the Sunday afternoon lectures given by many famous men
and women. In old age, it is said, he would declare that "no one
else has ever led such a distinguished and varied procession across
one stage." Edith was much appreciated at Ancoats and always spoke
of Rowley with the most friendly regard.]</p>

<p>She duly went north to deliver it, and wrote to tell me of the
enthusiasm with which the working men at Ancoats had received it,
and how at the end she announced to the audience her approaching
marriage to a man who felt about these things as she herself felt.
After spending a few days with various relatives in the
neighbourhood of Manchester she returned to the Fellowship House,
and then, on our wedding eve, a month later, we corrected the
proofs of the lecture.</p>

<p>We had decided in favour of marriage at a registry office. I was
living in Paddington and the Paddington office was selected. Hither
on Saturday, the 19th of December, I walked, accompanied by my
sister Louie, who was to be my witness, and a few minutes later we
met Edith accompanied by her friends Evelyn and Sybil Brooke. The
simple ceremony is quickly and easily accomplished. But Edith was a
little overcome by the occasion, rather timid and quiet. She said
afterwards that she was alarmed at the firm and decided tones in
which I had repeated the words of the assigned formula. There came
on her that ever recurring horror, dating from her childish
experiences, of any masculine domination or even the faintest
indication of it. Then we each returned to our respective bachelor
homes. I suppose we neither of us ever expected or desired to visit
the Paddington Registry Office again, and shortly afterwards I
ceased to live in Paddington, where neither of us lived again for
twenty-five years. But then, it so happened, Edith took by herself
and spent the last weeks of her life in a flat which turned out to
be in Paddington. So it came about that, after a quarter of a
century, I set out once more to walk to that same Registry Office,
alone now, to announce her death where before I had announced her
intended marriage. She never knew that the fate which brought her
to Paddington for her wedding was at last to bring her back for her
funeral.</p>

<p>There was no wedding breakfast. Edith used to say that her only
wedding breakfast was of porridge. For the afternoon, however, she
had invited all her numerous friends in town to an At Home at the
Fellowship House. It was necessary for me to appear at this
function, but she mercifully arranged for me to arrive late, so
that my discomfort might be of brief duration. Next morning we
started for Paris.</p>

<p>It had been my suggestion, and by her gladly accepted, that we
should go to Paris. I knew Paris well, and I longed to show her its
familiar beauties and to initiate her in its charming ways of
living. But I feared she might not be comfortable at my own old and
still purely French hotel, the Corneille, and took her to a rather
more English and more central hotel I knew of, the Hôtel d'Oxford
et Cambridge in the Rue d'Alger. It was practically her first
journey abroad, for she had previously only crossed the Channel for
a brief uneventful visit with the Stopford Brookes to Switzerland
and it had not brought her in contact with that Continental life
which meant much more to her than scenery. She drank in all the new
impressions eagerly and joyously; from that moment dated her love
of the French, her enjoyment of French ways, and her delight in
Paris. Here at once all the child in her would spring unrepressed
to the surface. I recall her loud demonstration of pleasure as she
called my attention to the fact that the cabmen wore white tophats,
and my instant attempt to quieten her demonstration, which I
thought would arouse the amusement of onlookers. She rather
resented this, and would afterwards remind me of the attempt to
subdue her; but she had had her revenge, for a street photographer
invited me to have "the leetle miss's" portrait taken, and she
professed to believe, and would playfully tell our friends, that in
Paris I had been mistaken for her grandfather. It was quite true
that while there was only a difference of less than two years
separating us, I looked older than my years, while she looked much
younger, and always enjoyed asking strangers to guess her age,
whereupon she would triumphantly announce her much higher real
age&mdash;until the time came at last when people no longer
under-estimated her age. We duly visited churches and museums. Of
course also she was attracted by the restaurants, which, though of
the ordinary sort, were something of a revelation to her and
furnished many ideas she profitably developed at home. She
specially liked the large Duval establishment in the Rue
Montesquieu where, then and on later visits, we would sit in the
gallery overlooking the hall below. Often and often, when far away,
she would recall that pleasant memory, and exclaim: "Versez,
galerie!"</p>

<p>There is one memory, more solemnly beautiful, which ever remains
in my mind, as it also remained in hers, from that first visit to
Paris together. We went to the Sunday afternoon concert at the
Châtelet Theatre to hear Beethoven's Ninth Symphony with the
chorus. On this occasion, much as Edith loved music, the emotion
was mine even more than hers, though I was not hearing the Symphony
for the first time. I shall never forget, and never know again, the
rapture which I experienced in that little side box at the
Châtelet. In the exaltation of that solemn hymn to Joy my own new
personal life seemed to blend harmoniously with the vision of my
mission of work in the world. This realisation shone radiantly out
of my eyes, and in much later days Edith would still sometimes
describe my face as she saw it then. I have heard the Ninth
Symphony since, but I never again re-captured the rapture of that
moment.</p>

<p>Yet I enjoyed many memorable concerts with Edith by my side, and
nowadays nothing brings me so much consolation as music or so many
poignant memories. Edith also, from first to last, always found joy
and refreshment in music. Without any technical knowledge she had
acquired a good taste in music. It so happened indeed that perhaps
her favourite symphony was Tchaikovsky's Pathétique, which has
little appeal for me (I preferred his Fifth), but we had no dispute
on the matter, for I understood her deep temperamental sympathy
with the composer who here so well expressed himself. During later
years she took an ever-growing pleasure and interest in the
theatre, but in this was mixed a kind of professional study, for
she was ambitious to write for the stage. She never, however,
craved for the theatre when away from it, genuine as was the
enjoyment it gave her. During our long months together in remote
Cornwall the one absent delight she longed for was always music.
Nowadays I am often sad to think that the gramophone, which brings
to my country solitude the most beautiful music in the world, was
not in existence then to soothe her spirit on wintry evenings in
our storm-beaten cottage. I but imperfectly shared her interest in
the theatre, so that she seldom expected me to accompany her
(though she easily obtained seats), except on great occasions, as
when a play of her own was to be produced. But in music our
enjoyment was equal and our tastes usually alike. So that we were
always ready to go to a concert together; in that respect she was
unchanged even in the mental distraction and suspicion of the last
months of her life. Perhaps our happiest and most exalted moments
were in listening to music side by side. Always music was as it
were the sacrament of our spiritual union.</p>

<p>Early in January we returned to London. I went back to my rooms
at Paddington and Edith to the Fellowship House. She had sent in
her resignation as Secretary of the Fellowship as soon as our
marriage arrangements were completed, but the resignation only took
effect some weeks later, when the members in appreciation of her
work presented her with a complete edition of Emerson's Works,
which was handed to her by Edward Carpenter. In the meanwhile we
were constantly meeting and quietly planning our future lives
together. She was also devoting her attention to lecturing for
Socialist and other Societies and to writing. About this time she
printed a lecture on "Democracy in the Kitchen," and a year later,
a pamphlet, embodying her own ideas and experience, entitled "A
Novitiate for Marriage." Of the latter she characteristically
ordered a thousand copies to be printed, and as only a small
proportion of these could be sold or even given away, in spite of
her efforts, there was always a large and heavy box of them in
every house-removal, until after her death what remained were
mostly destroyed. (The essay, in the form in which she later
revised it, was included in the volume of her papers, <i>The New
Horizon in Love and Life</i>, published after her death.) But the
opportunities to lecture were not frequent, though she was always a
good lecturer, and she was still a slow and deliberate writer, so
that the period following marriage was probably the easiest and
least strenuous of her life, and this was no doubt how she came to
turn her thoughts to farming. Her activities steadily gained in
momentum throughout her married life until in the end she may be
said to have been hopelessly carried away by them.</p>

<p>These early days of marriage were not only the least strenuous,
they were probably the most quietly happy of her life, the least
alloyed by mental or emotional worry and strain. Marriage brought
no ecstasy, but it brought a certain liberation, a greater freedom
to be her real self, a relaxation of that high-strung ethical
tension which she came to regard as a little priggish. As I read
again the letters she wrote to me during the twelve months
following that crisis in June when our hearts first came truly
together, never again in the deepest sense to part, I can see how
they follow a slow <i>crescendo</i> course. At first grave and
quiet, to a degree impressive in one naturally so eager and
impulsive, new notes of deep tenderness are from time to time
struck; and then, gradually, tones of careless freedom, moments of
reckless expansion come in, though never, then or ever, any trace
of sentimentality or of adoration; from that she was always saved
by her crisp sense of humour, her shrewd and mischievous wit. "You
rest every fibre in me and suit me, sir," she wrote soon after our
return from Paris, "and I crow like a wee child at the breast, and
I'm happy, happy in you, my true Heart." Thus even in these early
days she fell into that attitude towards me, as of a child to its
mother, which she had never known for a real mother and which
always appealed to me so deeply. It is an attitude again and again
reflected in her letters. Thus in 1896, when unwell and in bed, she
wrote: "I'm so woefully depressed. Oh! my Boy, my Boy! I wish you
were here with your loving arms to help me and to comfort me. I'm
like a weak tired child and want my mammy." It was an attitude she
never abandoned until the mental disarray of her last months on
earth, the attitude which in my heart she never ceased to take.
Indeed, this sort of maternal feeling which I felt continued to
grow in intensity throughout the whole period of our lives
together. It was fostered not only by my realisation that her
temperament was that of the eternal child but still more, no doubt,
by the fact that, as the years went on, frequent acute and
prolonged illnesses, as well as later the insidious progress of
organic disease, not to mention her tendency to impulsive rashness,
perpetually placed her in a helpless condition needing at my hands
all sorts of little cares and attentions, and thereby developing
even to an acute degree of aching tenderness, however awkward I
might be in manifesting them, all the femininely maternal impulses
that may chance to be latent within me. I 'yell remember how, less
than a year before her death, we sat one day in the garden of the
cottage we were occupying at Speen, and rising she stumbled on the
rough lawn and fell, spraining an ankle (her feet were very small)
not for the first time. At her sudden cry of pain I ran towards
her, exclaiming, it seems, for I was not conscious of it, "My
Baby!" But she heard me and was much touched by the involuntary
manifestation. Even to-day, when I am told by friends, who were
near her towards the end, of some little incident, maybe the result
of her own imprudence, which caused her distress, I feel that same
aching tenderness, the same impulse to run to her side as though
she were still alive.</p>

<p>Yet it must not be forgotten that the "child" was at the same
time a woman, and even more than a woman in her staunchness and
capacity, admirable in emergency, and, if need be, as fearless as a
lion. Almost equally early in her letters appeared the reverse
feeling which never forsook her, the feeling that I was a child and
she my mother.</p>

<p>"I'm ever so much more a woman than I used to be," she wrote in
March when occupied with a lecture (which to my regret later went
astray and was lost) on 'Latter-day Puritanism.' "I long to be
really well and to write. I feel the power in me to do a lot
somehow. Good night, my own darling, sleep in your old bachelor
bed. I feel so like your mother to-night, as if I could rock my
sweet babe to sleep on my breast and kiss away every gloomy thought
he has ever had. Sweetheart&mdash;come soon." (And I pause to brood
over these words of loving care out of the far past, to-night, when
I am alone, with my eyes resting on my "bachelor bed," while,
outside, police cars rush about with notices of an air-raid and
searchlights probe the sky with their great shafts.) A little
later, in a letter from Carbis, for the first time in a mood of
wild ecstacy, she exclaims: "I could lift the world by one arm and
carry it to God!"</p>

<p>Two or three months later, on the 17th of July, she wrote from
Haslemere to Probus, where I was then again doing medical work for
a short time: "My love, do you know that by the day of the week
this is the day a year ago when you and I went to our little house
with the foxglove towers and gave ourselves to ourselves? I look
back and it seems years and years ago. I was shy and frightened and
cried over my wee babe that was never to be, and you!&mdash;you
made me think of how beautiful men could be. So long ago and yet
only a year, it seems as if every phase of life has gone on in me
and I'm years and years older. I think when I'm dying I shall see
that house and smell the fern-roots and look into that blue sky and
see the gulls and feel as near the heart of a great mystery as I
did then. I've been reserved, more than is my nature to be, with
you and have come to you inch by inch, but I shall never go back,
and if you ever leave me I shall try the other mystery. Talk of
miracles! I look into my heart and wonder I can breathe. As the
years speed on I shall be nearer and nearer to you. I say to you
far far less than I feel and somehow, when you are with me, I seem
to be able to say nothing at times. I wonder what you feel as you
look back over the year? I wonder do you regret when you see my
quaint moods? And yet, in spite of it all, you must know I'm best
for you of all you know. Yet I get so weary of struggling with my
nature sometimes. Well, good night. Bless you, my darling
one&mdash;make me sweeter for you and keep me always close to your
heart."</p>

<p>The "quaint moods" were hard to bear sometimes, though doubtless
I had my part in provoking them. Less than a month later there is a
record of one of them in a letter which I doubtless preserved for
the sake of that which immediately followed. One of our little
difficulties&mdash;though we sought to adjust it by mutual
concessions&mdash;arose from the conflict between the demands of
her sociable nature and my unsociable nature. She had an expansive
temperament, a brilliant personality, a widely sympathetic
disposition, troops of friends; when we were living near London she
liked to have a succession of visitors. I was shy, awkward,
reserved, a literary man who worked slowly, and though not unduly
sensitive to noise or disturbance (much less so indeed than Edith
became as a writer) I needed much peace and solitude. In some
respects she might be termed extravert and I introvert. It would
appear that this summer Edith was inviting one friend after
another, old and new, to spend the day or stay with us, not
exclusively friends of her own, but also friends and relatives of
mine. An old friend and devoted admirer was visiting us, to be
followed by Bernard Shaw, and then an old friend of mine. During a
few days in London it seems that I had uttered a protest, and she
had replied with what she called "stupid naughty words," for on the
12th of August she wrote in a state of despair, "almost on the
verge of brain-fever," at my silence and cruelty and her
disappointment with me and my disappointment with her and the
general irony of life. But the very next day she wrote this letter:
"My Husband, After a night's sleep and with your patient letters in
my hands I'm utterly ashamed of my wild stormy nature, and its
moods, and yet&mdash;it is me, too. Love me for my faults, and not
my virtues, Dear, and then I shall never disappoint you! Poor sweet
old love, I wish I had your dear head here now, and I'd bury it in
my wee breast and kiss the poor brain where I have kicked (the
description is excellent, and I seemed to writhe as I heard the
squelch of the white brain matter gurgling). Poor dear
Havelock&mdash;and yet, paradoxical as it seems, if I did not love
you I could not kick you. However, I can only promise to try. Love
can do much, and to know you really love me will probably work
miracles. You see now why I have to be quiet and not over-work or
worry; it is an inheritance, and I fear me will for ever make your
<i>utter</i> reverence for me impossible. I seem to want you very
badly. I think I can pour in the oil and wine now, if you'll let
me." Then she explains how she will re-adjust the visitors, and
ends: "Just kiss me, sweetheart, and know that these things do not
hinder but deepen love really," and in a postscript "I open this
again to rock you to me, darling. I <i>do</i> love you, Havelock,
and need you with my whole woman heart." This episode was typical
of many that occurred from time to time, and sometimes at frequent
intervals. They were usually, in large part, due, as she hints, to
fatigue, or nervous exhaustion, and though the effect on her of
such a nervous explosion was more often than not beneficial, the
effect on me was truly described in the image she repeats from my
letter. It remained true to the end. For these episodes occurred to
the end. Only at the end they were not immediately followed by the
reaction of tender love. And that was part of the sorrowful
evidence that a process of mental disintegration had begun.</p>

<p>But the letters just quoted belong to a slightly later date. I
may go back a little to quote from two letters of mine (it is not
necessary to reproduce all the little details) which were written
from Paddington shortly after our marriage when we were still at
the stage of arranging our coming life together, and my old habits
were not yet outgrown. The first is dated March 9th, 1892: "My
Wifie, a word to give my love and kisses on your birthday. So glad
to get your long letter...I hasten to enclose your seal. Also a
photograph (amateur) of Olive just arrived in her old costume which
I thought was worn out long ago. Please send it carefully back, at
once. Isn't she sweet? It's snowing here; [Barker] Smith and his
daughter coming this morning; also Miss Bradley and Edith Cooper
[Michael Field]. I hardly think we need a studio&mdash;at all
events at present; I'm not such a devotee of silence as
that&mdash;provided I can have a solitary place in the open air.
You hadn't time to look at the lovely platinotype photos the
railway Co. have put up at Paddington&mdash;a hundred of 'em. When
I go there to get my <i>Pall Mall</i> I can almost look at you at
St. Ives and Tregenna and all the other places. To-night I'm going
with Symons to the Empire&mdash;some wonderful Bedouin Arabs...I
want to go to Haslemere next week; please give me directions; I
suppose there's no need to give anyone notice. Your Havelock." This
was written just after she had gone down to Carbis to rearrange the
little cottage for us together there, and we see how, from the very
first, she was anxious that I should have a quiet place for work. I
repeatedly told her I had been accustomed to work anywhere. But she
adhered to her excellent design and it proved a great boon to me.
We see, also, how, with her prompt executive ability, she had
practically secured the Haslemere bungalow before I had even seen
it, and there could have been no happier plan.</p>

<p>The other letter from Paddington was evidently written in the
following June:</p>

<p class="quote">"My darling, I'm expecting Dr. Louis
Robinson&mdash;the Darwinism in the Nursery man&mdash;to talk over
a book for the [Contemporary Science] Series. Went last night to
Wagner's <i>Tristan and Isolde;</i> it's wonderful beyond
words&mdash;a sustained ecstasy of love that never flags or grows
monotonous. Almost the greatest thing in the realm of music.
Performance perfect, immense enthusiasm. Went this morning to the
Anthropological Library, but didn't get anything out for you this
time.* Shall have to send you two pairs of socks; the light pair
got two big holes in one day! My <i>Pall Mall</i> cheque was £1.
18. 6. I read Olive's letter to you before even knowing it was
yours...I felt very loving to you at the Opera last night; wished
so much you were there. (Vernon Lee says that at <i>Tristan</i> you
feel that if any great temptation presented itself, you wouldn't be
able to resist it; unfortunately none did present itself.)...Louie
and Symons came to the conclusion the other day that I had not been
at all spoilt by marriage; you'd hardly know, Symons said to her,
that I was married. Rhys, on the other hand, they decided, had been
spoilt. Although better groomed than formerly (or perhaps because!)
he looks pale and depressed, and has no spirit for anything; always
has to be with his wife...When are you going to get to your
lectures? Goodbye for the present, dearest. Your Husband."</p>

<p class="footonte">[* I had become a Fellow of the Anthropological
Institute in, I think, 1889, and (except for an interval of some
years when I could not afford the subscription) I am so still,
nearly forty-five years later. About the same time I joined the
Berlin Anthropological Society, and also subscribed to numerous
scientific journals (anthropological, psychological, medical, etc.)
in French, German and Italian.]</p>

<p>A fortnight after Edith went down to Carbis to prepare the
cottage, I joined her there. We remained two months, then returned
to London, and a few days later settled for the summer in the
little Haslemere bungalow on the slopes of Hindhecd in the grounds
of the Hon. Rollo Russell (son of the famous Lord John Russell),
whose wife, the daughter of a distinguished musician, Joachim, had
for some years been a friend of Edith's. We furnished the bungalow,
which Rollo Russell had only recently set up, adding what was
necessary to Edith's things brought from the Fellowship House, our
most important acquisition being a big double bed. This we sold on
leaving, as it would not have fitted into the little Cornish
cottage and we never replaced it, as we preferred two small beds if
possible side by side, and ultimately we usually had separate
rooms. We rented the bungalow for several summers. It was an ideal
summer residence for students and writers, entirely shut off from
the world, the haunt of a singular and sometimes embarrassing
profusion of birds and small mammals and insects. After we left, it
was for a time occupied by Rollo Russell's nephew, the famous
philosopher, Bertrand Russell. We were here all the summer, I going
up to London for a few days every week or two. In November we shut
up the bungalow and went down for the winter to the Cornish
cottage.</p>

<p>This was the general pattern of our life: the winters together
in Cornwall, and the summers in a looser association either in
London or in, some country place near London, while at one period
during the summer Edith was mostly in Carbis busily occupied with
her cottage-letting season. During 1892, we spent about twenty-six
weeks, or rather more than half the year, under the same roof; but
during the early months of the year we possessed no common roof in
town uhough constantly meeting. I found her writing at the end of
May 1891 when the question of our marriage was still in an indenite
shape: "I believe in folk separating at intervals, don't you? Yes,
I know you do. How I should loathe a creature I was always near!"
She always declared that the beauty and intimacy of our
relationship was largely founded on this independence and the
frequent separations. She would tell to near friends the story of
some people who once travelled down to Cornwall in the same
carriage with us and wondered who we were. They chanced to inquire
of friends of our own, and, being told, one of them exclaimed: "Oh,
they could not have been married! They were so interested in each
other and he was so attentive!"</p>

<p>But I may add that during all the later years she became, in
practice, less reconciled to these separations. She would begin to
dread the announcement of my departure as soon as I arrived at
Carbis for the winter; it would sometimes happen that she was ill
on the morning fixed for me to leave and that I lingered on in
consequence. She was never tired of urging me to accompany her on
her visits (in 1914) to America. She would ask why we should be
apart when we had perhaps so short a time, as indeed it proved, to
be together. Even during the last weeks, with mind growing
unbalanced and almost regarding me as an enemy, she was still
flying in unexpectedly to make sure I was well.</p>

<p>I am bound to say that, while we were actually, perhaps, more
together in the later years, and that this fully accorded with my
own wishes, I yet felt at times a need, which she seemed not to
feel about me in any marked degree, to leave her in order to seek
rest and peace. She used to declare that I was myself, though so
serene outside, a very restless person inside, and that may have
been true. But she was a restless person both outside and inside.
From early morning until after dinner, when she was soon ready to
lay her head on the tiny pillow she always carried about (I still
preserve it) and fall immediately asleep like a child, she was so
radiantly energetic in mind and body, so full of her own joy or her
own grief, yet so alive to everything and everyone about her,
overflowing with fun sometimes yet so unexpectedly apt to fall into
nervous irritability, evoking either laughter or tears around her,
that there was little rest or peace where she was. Many of her
friends, much as they loved her, found that this radiating and
incalculable energy, however stimulating, sometimes became
exhausting. It is not surprising that I, who have scarcely found
anyone whose continuous presence is congenial, should have felt, in
spite of all the depth of my affection and comprehension, a
recurring need for solitude and silence, a need stronger than the
sense of all the risks thus involved.</p>

<p>During the first two years there were various absences not due
to any wish to be apart. I twice again went to Probus as <i>locum
tenens</i> for Dr. Bonar, in July 1892 for several weeks and in
January 1893, that being the last time I ever undertook any
ordinary medical practice, and she went north once or twice to
lecture. From Probus in 1892 I find the following letter which she
had preserved (I omit various trivial details):</p>

<p class="quote">"My Darling, No letter to-day&mdash;but I've not
yet exhausted the sweet letter of yesterday...Very few patients
to-day, but proofs have come in to correct...When I get back shall
be busy for a day or two getting <i>Nationalisation of Health</i>
ready to send off. Should like to come down to Haslemere about ioth
of August to stay for some weeks at least, working at my <i>Man and
Woman</i> book (if I'm not frightened back to London by visitors!).
I expect Mackay will be in London soon and should like him to come
to Haslemere for a day or two. When you see Mary Cameron don't
forget to ask her if the Dyers at St. Ives were my friends in
Paris&mdash;C. Gifford Dyer, American artist, with one daughter,
Stella. I shan't be able to go to the Alhambra with Symons or to
meet Signorina Legnani (the most delightful of all ballet dancers)
on Tuesday! I'm afraid that I'm not altogether sorry that I shan't
be able to go with you on Sunday. Somehow or other the very thought
of it made me feel ill and helpless. Now I feel quite happy! And
then I don't at all like to feel that you are at all dependent upon
me in any way except of love. I don't feel dependent on you in
those things and I'm sure I could never have loved you if I hadn't
felt that you were strong and independent. You are, <i>really,</i>
my sweetheart, are you not?&mdash;I can't bear to think that you
are ever such a tiny bit like those wives who hang round their
husbands' necks like millstones. I'm sure you aren't
<i>really</i>...Just had a letter from Olive. Is doubtful about
coming to England next year, but may. Would like to see you;
doesn't much want to see me. But I am the only man-friend she
corresponds with regularly; she sends me a pound to buy something
for myself to wear. What shall I get? What a long letter this is
for me! Quite time I started on those proofs. Good-bye, my own, own
wife. Your own Husband."</p>

<p>That letter sounds rather strange to me in places tiow, both as
regards substance and tone. She was swiftly reconciled to my
failure to feel able to accompany her on social and other visits,
and was anxious to spare me, so far as could be conveniently
arranged, from such visits to our home as I might consider an
infliction. On my side I ceased to employ inconsiderate protests.
Our mutual independence was harmoniously adjusted.</p>

<p>Thus it is that, however much I may be tempted to regret the
hours when we might have been together and were not, I recognise
that things were better as they were, and am content. In the
spiritual world the part is sometimes greater than the whole.</p>

<p>The beauty and intimacy of our relationship, I have said, was
built on our separations, separations without which the
relationship might perhaps have dissolved. Yet&mdash;and herein we
may see the irony of life&mdash;out of these same separations also
sprang some of its tragedy, and that even during the early period
of marriage. I had remained in London while she was in Carbis
revelling in her new-found felicity. And in the climax of her
felicity my felicity received a jar which affected; directly and
indirectly, the whole course of our subsequent relations. Being
alone, Edith was joined by an old friend of nearly her own age whom
she had known from girlhood, a woman brought up in a luxurious home
but of simple wholesome hearty nature, affectionate but
unsentimental, made to be a staunch friend rather than a lover
either of man or woman. But in the fermentation now working in
Edith to a new experience of freedom and joy her heart went out
with exuberant emotion to the friend whom chance had thrown close
to her. I knew, for she had told me everything, of the sentimental
and sometimes passionate attraction which from early school life up
to a few years before marriage she had experienced for girl
friends. I knew that when a schoolgirl the resulting relationships
had sometimes possessed a slight but definite sensuous character,
though it had not found that experience in later adult friendships
with women. I knew that such feelings were common in young girls.
But at that time I had no real practical knowledge of inborn sexual
inversion of character. In the essay I had written on Walt Whitman
in <i>The New Spirit</i> I had passed over the homosexual strain in
Whitman, in a deprecatory footnote, as negligible. I am sure that
if I ever asked myself whether there was a homosexual strain in
Edith I answered it similarly. I was not yet able to detect all
those subtle traits of an opposite sexual temperament as surely
planted in her from the beginning as in Whitman, and really the
roots not only of the disharmonies which tortured her but of much
of the beauty and strength of her character. The masculine traits
were indeed not obvious in Edith any more than the feminine traits
in Whitman; most people, I believe, failed to see them, and I
cannot too often repeat that she was not really man at all in any
degree, but always woman, boy, and child, and these three, it
seemed, in almost equal measure.</p>

<p>As soon as she perceived this new emotional outflow towards her
old friend Claire (as I will call her) she wrote to tell me of it
with all her native trustful confidence, simple, direct and
spontaneous. If I remember right, she wrote with a misgiving
hesitation at first. There was, as I now look back, a pathetic
wonder and beauty in that appeal to my comprehending love, as
though addressed to a divine being superior to the weaknesses of a
human husband. The response, as her letters show, was the response
she desired and expected. But it by no means came from a godhead,
but from a human and suffering heart. It is true that&mdash;though
I cannot now be sure&mdash;I do not think my pain was immediate. My
emotions work slowly. I think the first effort at self-conquest
seemed successful, but was less successful than it seemed, and that
it was not till the spring of next year that, as I still vividly
recall, I restlessly paced up and down my study at Paddington with
heart aching over letters from Carbis. It was not so much the mere
fact&mdash;for I had no prejudices and I well knew she could be
guilty of nothing ugly or ignoble&mdash;but the realisation, as
rightly or wrongly it seemed to me, that this new absorption in
another person was leading unconsciously to a diminution in the
signs of tenderness in her love towards me. Still I conquered my
pain and gave no sign that I had even felt any.</p>

<p>On the 8th of March I wrote:</p>

<p class="quote">"My own Wifie, my letter was very lovely this
morning; I read it over ever so many times. Yes, nothing in the
world or out of it will tear you away from my
breastbone&mdash;unless you want to go. I am perfectly happy that
you should be so close to Claire. I feel very tender to her. Give
her my sweetest love."</p>

<p>I had the reward of my self-conquest, then and
thereafter&mdash;I may honestly say to the very end&mdash;in a deep
and tender gratitude. A little later, in June 1892, Edith wrote to
me:</p>

<p class="quote">"I dreamt you died last night, and the loneliness
was horrible. I shivered in my sleep with the intensity of the
feeling that I was in a world where no one understood me."</p>

<p>That refrain concerning "the one person in the world who really
understands me" occurs again and again in her letters through all
the years that followed.</p>

<p>I had tried to conquer, and given little or no sign that the
conquest was not complete, or even that there had been any need of
conquest. But, after all, I was human. There remained beneath the
surface the consciousness of a flaw in the ideal of married love I
had so far cherished, and a secret wound of the heart "not so deep
as a well nor so wide as a church door," but enough to kill that
conception of mutual devotion in marriage which all my purely
intellectual interest in Hinton's doctrines had never destroyed as
a personal aim. We were destined to work out a larger and deeper
conception of love, but that beautiful conventional conception had
for us been killed. Even my strong sense of justice could scarcely
have long tolerated so one-sided a sexual freedom in marriage. It
might be true that I was exclusively heterosexual and she was not,
and that therefore there was no demand on me to go outside marriage
for love. But it was also true that the very qualities in her
nature which made her largely homosexual were qualities which,
fortifying as they might be to our comradeship, were inimical to
the purely feminine qualities of sweetness and repose which a man
seeks in a woman, and therefore opposed in our case to a strict
conjugal fidelity. And so it proved.</p>

<p>In after years, when I no longer concealed the feelings I had
then experienced, Edith would say that this early attraction was
really slight, and that in any case I should not have left her so
much alone. It is true that this relationship only had a fleeting
and shallow sexual colouring and soon merged into normal
friendship, as her letters clearly show, although a joy and help to
her while it lasted. Whatever I might think in hours of depression,
it never interfered with her larger and deeper love for me, and
Claire was also my true and affectionate friend. As to my absences,
I have already noted that at the beginning, and always in theory,
Edith was as warm an advocate of independence and frequent
separation as I was. There was really no need of excuses on either
side. All that happened was the natural and inevitable result of
our temperaments and our circumstances. We neither of us needed
apologies for we bravely faced our difficulties together, and out
of them we won a new harmony and reached profounder depths of
love.</p>

<p>This growth and development may be illustrated by a selection of
passages from the letters she sent to me during 1893. On the 14th
February she wrote: "I told Claire you would be trusted with all
and she smiled 'You <i>are</i> two odd people!' It is her purity
and sweetness which have made me love her; she is so childlike and
unprudish, and gives me like a child a love which has rested and
comforted and strengthened me in a way that amazes me." On the 11th
March, just after her birthday, she wrote to me at Paddington from
Carbis where she was with Claire: "It is so wonderful to have
married a man who leaves a woman her soul. I'm utterly satisfied in
you, Havelock. It passes all my comprehension, though, why you love
me." But at this very time the crisis of my pain in my own emotions
clearly described, the only crisis of the kind I ever experienced
with Edith, was already approaching. A few days after writing the
letter just quoted, she went with Claire to Manchester.</p>

<p>The next passage is from a letter I wrote from High Stoatley
Cottage, the bungalow in Rollo Russell's garden, apparently early
in the year 1893 (though I do not feel absolutely sure I place it
right), when she had gone up to Manchester to lecture at Ancoats
for the first time since her marriage.</p>

<p class="quote">"My love, just a word to say good night before I
go to bed. I've been wondering how you got on and feeling awful
loving to you. It's getting very cold. Your own H. <i>Monday</i>. I
got your letter mid-day...I've had no money but have wanted none.
Mrs. Russell has sent a partridge which we've had for dinner
to-day. Mrs. Upfold [the cook char] insisted on making an
apple-tart; you had given orders, so she was bound to; started it
to-day. I expect to have about finished my book [this would be
<i>The Nationalisation of Health</i>] by to-morrow night, and
thought of going away about Thursday. It's very good of Symons to
let me use his rooms; he is always doing things for me&mdash;I
never do anything for him...I enjoy your letter ever so much and
like to think of my little wife going about the world and helping
people and stimulating them and making new friends and getting new
experiences, while her old husband is coiled up in his shell at
home. He is quite comfie. You mustn't expect me to write letters
like when you were at Carbis and I in London; I only write like
that when I'm <i>very</i> miserable and suicidal, and now I'm quite
happy and awfully loving to my little darling. I hope it was a
bigger audience in the evening when they discovered it was the
right person; you ought to be careful to keep 'Lees Ellis' for
Manchester."</p>

<p>She was staying with people who were almost strangers, and she
was lecturing, both things that strained her, so that she needed
all the messages of comfort and love I could send. But, though I
was not acting with deliberate cruelty, I was for the time
completely obsessed by the idea that Edith was finding joy and
happiness in another person, and while I had not the slightest
feeling of jealousy against Claire it seemed to me that I was
myself becoming a secondary object in Edith's affections. It was
not jealousy, for I had never grudged the love Claire received but
even been glad of it, but the feeling that there was at this time
what Edith herself called a "philosophic" tone in her letters to me
evidently hurt. Probably this was one of the unfortunate results,
not the only one that ever occurred, of our prolonged absences;
without absence love tends to fall into commonplace routine, but it
must always be accepted that if absence keeps love alive it
necessarily keeps alive the tragedy which is inherent in love. Now
suddenly my letters began to show&mdash;in reaction against the
letter that hurt me&mdash;an obscure restless discontent and
unhappiness. I was ashamed to explain precisely what I felt, but it
was only too clear that I was suffering, and Edith could not fail
to detect the cause. She never kept these letters. It was evidently
her habit only to keep those letters of mine which seemed to her
beautiful, worthy some day to be re-read; and certainly a large
number have thus survived. Unknown to each other this was the
practice of both of us, though I kept some letters in which she had
expressed what seemed to me a just resentment or grief. It is thus
that I have the letter in which she showed how completely overcome
she was by the blow my letters had dealt her. She had merely
stumbled through her lectures; her distress was so great that she
couldn't conceal it from the people she was staying with, who
realised it had something to do with me; she became ill; she wanted
to see me at once. At the same time she was stung to bitter
resentment. There was no doubt about the suffering I had caused
her. In that realisation my obsession was dissipated, at once and
for ever. I became completely repentant. I showered letters of
remorseful tenderness on her by every post.</p>

<p>These letters, as I find to-day, Edith had carefully kept
together and I should perhaps quote a few sentences from them.</p>

<p class="quote">"My Sweet Heart, I am so pained at your letter,
that I have hurt you so&mdash;and when it was only out of my love.
It makes me hate myself. But you say <i>exactly</i> the things that
I have been feeling. Only your letter isn't like a 'philosophic'
lover's, you know. And in that, although it pains me you are hurt,
it takes a great load off me somehow. You know I have all these
weeks been loving you <i>so</i> much, and seeming never to be able
to think of anything else but you, and I was so glad about
Claire,&mdash;and I think I got into a morbidly sensitive state and
that is why your philosophy hurt me so. I feel so angry and ashamed
with myself I let you see it; I tried not to. And yet I can't love
and <i>not</i> tell you what I feel...That letter needn't have
pained you so. It only showed that I love you a great deal more
than is wise. It is funny that only a little while ago I was
writing to Olive such an enthusiastic letter about how I love you,
and about how at last I had got to that exalted state in which mere
loving itself is sufficient and one doesn't crave so much about the
amount of the return&mdash;and it isn't true at all! (I mean about
the return!) I do wish it wasn't my nature to love so intensely.
All my life long I have been trying to be philosophical, but I
haven't succeeded. And now I know I never shall succeed. You see if
I could love you quite moderately and peacefully you would be quite
happy and undisturbed! Please do not imagine that I felt miserable
before a week ago and was hiding it. Or that it was because of your
love to Claire&mdash;but I know you won't suspect me about that.
Love is funny and I am funny. It needs its wife's little breasties
every two hours like a baby, and if they seem far off it do shriek!
(But you know, my Love, when the mother hears her baby, and knows
she has that within her to soothe it, she doesn't feel that she
must yell too!) Your own troublesome and unphilosophic but absurdly
loving Husband. A line before I post just to give you my latest
love, you dearest thing in the world. I am distressed till I get my
letter to-morrow saying you are.&mdash;I long to comfort the
injured little wife as is plagued with a husband what's madly in
love with her...You will have realised now how terribly you
misunderstood, and I need not say very much. All these weeks my
whole body has been like a bundle of sensitive nerves throbbing
with love of you, every tiniest act of the day has seemed mixed up
with love of you, I have had no thought and written no word that
wasn't love of you&mdash;and you calmly refer to my 'satirical
letters.' Good God, are you blind&mdash;or what?...Do you know that
the fact that I can still love you after that letter and feel
perfectly sweet is about the most precious proof I could ever give
that I am indeed hopelessly in love with you. I fold my arms round
you. I seem to be almost grateful to you for enabling me to give
you such a proof of my love. I seem to be a mother, and you my
fretful babe that I fold and smother in my breast. I do not mind
the 'philosophical love,' or anything. I only know that I love my
babe and am satisfied with loving. But, oh, my Love, my own Love,
how could you think such things?...Goodbye, my own Sweetheart. Be
rested. Have no more unloving thoughts of the heart that is
entirely yours. And do not be hurt that you misunderstood a little,
for you couldn't help it, and the wounds you gave have all turned
to sweetness; there is no bitter at all. Lie still, my own, and
rest beside me, and grow strong. Always your Havelock."</p>

<p>Soon she was herself again.</p>

<p class="quote">"Your three soothing letters have come," she wrote
on March 22nd, "and now I <i>know</i> you are hurt over my letter
yesterday, but I was almost mad with horror and illness. I felt
you'd gone somehow and it frenzied me. It tastes glorious to me
that you love me like this; and you must know me well enough to
know that it is the very need of my woman's nature to be and to
love like that. Forgive me, my Sweet&mdash;nothing matters if we
belong, and the very thought of you being away from me made me feel
like a suicide. What I said yesterday only came out of a wearied
hurt heart&mdash;a blank horror that the great corner-stone had
slipped from my house. I should go stark raving mad if you left me,
and yet&mdash;so long as you love me I don't mind a scrap who else
you love. My sweet Sweetheart, I will take you into my arms and
cradle you&mdash;"</p>

<p>It is too sacredly beautiful to quote more. A day or two later
she wrote:</p>

<p class="quote">"Your letters make me glow that you love me so.
You know, in your ear, this is how I wanted you to love
me&mdash;with passion and force&mdash;and I know now you were not
<i>quite</i> in love with me when we went to the registrar's. I am
not 'far away' but in your very bowels and heart. I believe I have
an exceptional power of loving. What has hurt you? I don't think
you can ever guess what this deep great love of you is to me, and
your love,&mdash;and Claire's too. I live and I bathe in love, and
you must not grudge it me. <i>Nothing</i> can make me 'far off' for
you&mdash;it is impossible."</p>

<p>That was the first and last time in our life together that any
cloud arose from doubt on my part as to her love. I had not been in
the faintest degree jealous of Claire, but, rightly or wrongly, as
I have said, I had felt that Edith's love for Claire involved a
diminished tenderness for me. If it was so my outburst had itself
restored my position. I never repeated it, or felt the slightest
impulse to repeat it. Thereafter Edith had a succession of intimate
women friends, at least one of whom meant very much indeed to her.
I never grudged the devotion, though it was sometimes great, which
she expended on them, for I knew that it satisfied a deep and
ineradicable need of her nature. The only test I applied to them
was how far they were good for her. If they suited her&mdash;and
her first intuitions were not always quite sound&mdash;I was not
only content but glad. I never had a quarrel with one of them and
some of them have been&mdash;now more than ever in our community of
loss&mdash;my own dear friends. It must not, however, for a moment
be supposed that these special friends with whom she had had for a
time an intimate relationship such as one side of her nature craved
were more than few in number. There was a succession of them but
each relationship was exclusive while it lasted, which was usually
for years, and would have been permanent had circumstances allowed.
She was always relentlessly true to her ideals; she loathed
promiscuity; she was attracted to purity of character, though by no
means to puritanism; any touch of coarseness or of vice was fatal,
and produced in her a revulsion of feeling which nipped in the bud
one or two relationships.* The few friends with whom there was ever
any question of such relationship at all were but a small
proportion of the army of her friends, most of whom never guessed
the special and sacred attraction which she had felt for a few. I
never knew anyone who had so many friends. She had a passion for
friendship. They were people of all kinds and classes, from Ranees
and duchesses down. That made no difference. She was equally
natural and herself with all of them, equally full of sympathy and
tender solicitude. Her longest, staunchest, and least interrupted
friendships were with people of the highest character living in the
conventional world, though she herself remained unconventional, and
was quite capable of making a friendly remark to the butler at
dinner&mdash;and being forgiven for doing so. But at the other end
of the social scale she was equally attached to people of the
humblest position and even won the devotion of downright
rapscallians, such as the light-hearted and glib-tongued Cornish
gaol-bird who on one occasion, to do her honour, declared to
various people that she had given him five shillings when in
reality she had given him nothing.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* It is notable, notwithstanding her sensitive
and quickly inflamed temperament, and her extraordinary skill on
occasion in hurling crushing language at the heads of those who
offended her, I never once heard her use even one of the coarse
vulgarisms or common swear words in which it is so easy for the
nervously irritable woman to indulge.]</p>

<p>I have said that my delayed outburst in the spring of 1893 was
never repeated, and that henceforth there was no shade of personal
pain in my feelings towards Edith's affection for any of her
friends, unless when I felt that her own interests were concerned.
But there was before long another cause at work to prevent that
feeling ever again arising in my breast. For we were almost
immediately to become equal in this matter. Towards the end of May
in this same year 1893, at Haslemere, it so chanced that for a time
Edith had no servant sleeping in the bungalow, and therefore
desired a companion for the occasions when I was away. There was no
friend of her own available, and in all innocence I suggested a
young lady, an acquaintance of my own, whom I will call Amy. She
was found free to come, and she came. Amy, whom I had known from
her childhood, was at this time twenty-four. I had never paid any
special attention to her; with my idealistic and intellectual
pre-occupations I had overlooked the gentle, quiet girl who, on her
side, had cherished admiration for me from a distance. But in the
narrow limits of the bungalow I began to become aware of her sweet,
soothing, unselfish qualities. I began to discern a personality, a
yet unobtrusive personality, singularly unlike Edith's indeed, but
yet attractive. One day I went for a walk with her to a pine-wood
near Hindhead; there we sat side by side on a fallen trunk, and
there I gave her a kiss. It was but a single, simple kiss, and for
months, even years, afterwards there was little further progress in
intimacy, for with me relationships developed with extreme
slowness, and Amy was much too inexperienced to make, or to invite,
any advances.</p>

<p>Yet from the day of that first kiss I hid nothing from Edith;
there was never, then or later, the slightest deception, and never
a stolen interview. Any such lack of openness towards the woman in
the world who was nearest to me would have been impossible; it
would in any case have been unpardonable when she was absolutely
open to me. Whatever the difficulties might be, we met them
squarely, both Edith and I, and conquered them as well as we
could.</p>

<p>Edith scarcely made the way easy to me. Her high-strung,
emotional nature at once came into play. It never occurred to her
that in essentials she was not called upon to face more than I had
been called upon to face in her relationship to Claire. It seemed
to her, at first, and for long after, merely the influence of what
she was accustomed to call a "femininity." The explosions of her
nervous temperament led to some painful and humiliating scenes.
Amy, whose character and personality were still shy and
undeveloped, remained quiet and gentle, without taking any steps to
solve the situation. The situation might have solved itself if left
alone, and the difficulty melted away into nothingness, for at that
time I was drawn to Amy, so far as I can judge, by no strong deep
impulse. Edith's first indignant resentment had two
results&mdash;neither of which, I think, she ever clearly realised.
In the first place the injustice of her attitude aroused an
opposing sense of justice in me and stimulated a firmness the
emotional impulse itself might have been too weak to attain. In the
second place the original impulse was fortified by the attention
which, through Edith's attitude, I concentrated on it, whereas in a
calm and free atmosphere it might soon have withered. As it was,
that one kiss became a germ that slowly grew more vital during many
years that followed.</p>

<p>The problem was not yet solved, but the storm swiftly died down.
Amy stayed the appointed time, leaving early in August, though
henceforth there was a grievance that in moments of irritability
might be brought up against me. That, however, was merely on the
surface. Through both these dangerous adventures, hers with Claire
and mine with Amy, it might be true that the original and largely
conventional ideals of love with which we had both, scarcely more
than a. year earlier, come together, had been undermined, but we
were struggling towards ideals which would be truer to the nature
of each of us, and our deeper union, far from being destroyed, was
being consolidated.</p>

<p>I will again quote from her letters. In September, shortly after
Amy had left, during one of my brief absences in London, Edith
wrote:</p>

<p class="quote">"I shall always fly to your breast and tell you
<i>everything</i>&mdash;you <i>are</i> me, I <i>am</i> you, and not
gods or devils can tear us from each other."</p>

<p>The words were true and I think she would have admitted their
truth, though perhaps not have repeated them, even to the very end.
For me they have always been true.</p>

<p>On September 13th she wrote from Manchester, where she was
lecturing:</p>

<p class="quote">"I don't know what on earth is the matter with me,
but I feel a nearness and sweetness, strength and depth, about you
that is like the rush of the sea or a mountain ridge. I seem to
have lived years and years, and that tiny misery and problem about
Amy has helped me so in helping others...I shall always tell you
everything, and He on your heart. I am surged with love of you and
nothing in the world could make me not bear what you may bring to
me, for men and women <i>seemingly</i> must hurt those they
love...Think of me and know that in your arms and on your breast is
my one complete home."</p>

<p>A week later, when staying at the home of Claire, she wrote:</p>

<p class="quote">"I wish you were having so good a holiday. I am
simply full of life, my eyes clear, my skin rosy, and my spirit
like a girl's. Mr. X. [her host] says he never saw a woman keep her
youth so in his life, he cannot realise I am married at all.
Well&mdash;I am, and <i>desperately</i> in love with my husband. I
want to be bigger and nobler and broader just to rest and
strengthen you."</p>

<p>It was not a momentary attitude but recurs perpetually. More
than a year later I find her writing:</p>

<p class="quote">"I long to see you and talk to you, and then croon
into your strong, true arms and hush and bless myself with your
love and faithfulness. I never was more truly and deeply in love
with you, and I find myself setting folk on to praise you with a
kind of inordinate lustful feeling, just to hear them say true and
sweet things of you."</p>

<p>Through all these incidents, alike at Haslemere and at Carbis,
the ordinary business of life had steadily to be pursued, and for
me it was studying and writing. Edith's activities, outside
housekeeping, were at this time probably less than at any time
before or after. She had indeed written and privately published her
pamphlet, <i>A Novitiate for Marriage;</i> she was writing, and
from time to time delivering, outspoken lectures on various
advanced social and moral questions. In these ways and by her
magnetic personal qualities she had already impressed and
influenced many. I recall how one woman friend, herself of some
intellectual distinction, had enthusiastically declared that Edith
was "the light and hope of our future civilisation," and often
afterwards we would playfully bandy about that saying between
ourselves. But her more public activities were just now leisurely
and intermittent, for she realised her new duties and
responsibilities as a wife and devoted much more time and attention
than was possible or necessary, when later her own activities again
increased, to establishing the best conditions not only for my
domestic comfort but for my work. At an early stage she had rightly
seen that the Cot, as she had named the little cottage at Carbis
Bay she had already taken on lease before the question of marriage
had arisen, would not be suitable for me to work in, and that I
must therefore have a place for work outside. It was she who
discovered and arranged on my behalf the tenancy of a studio at
Hawkes Point. This was not merely the only possible place in the
immediate neighbourhood, it was the ideal place, for my work.
Within about fifteen minutes' walk, situated on the point in the
middle of the Bay, on the sea side of the railway line, this rough
little building had once been a mining shed at the head of a small
now disused shaft. It was a convenient and yet solitary and
isolated spot from whence I could look down on Lelant sands, in the
distance see St. Ives on its peninsula to the left and to the right
the more deserted dunes stretching towards Godrevy lighthouse, but
no nearer habitation was visible. Edward Carpenter, who knew
England well, declared, when he came down to visit us, that my
hermitage had one of the finest outlooks on the whole English
coast.</p>

<p>In front of the low buildings placed against the hollowed
hillside, half a boat had been set on end, and there in this little
ivy-covered shelter facing the sea I would sit writing or reading
whenever the weather allowed, which in the mild Cornish climate is
sometimes more or less during the whole of the winter. But inside
the studio various changes were effected for my comfort, under
Edith's supervision, and here through the winters of more than ten
years&mdash;until, indeed, I was turned out by my landlady, who
decided to put the place to other uses&mdash;I was able to work in
complete freedom and under conditions which suited me perfectly. If
I owed nothing more to Edith than the opportunity to obtain and to
preserve these conditions in the happiest manner possible my debt
to her would still be immense. Soon after breakfast I would start
off with such papers or books as I might read&mdash;for I
maintained my studio in an almost bare condition and kept few or no
books there&mdash;and after three hours' work would return for
lunch, though once or twice a week during the earlier years I would
walk along the coastguard path to St. Ives to join Edith for lunch
at the little restaurant kept by Miss Kevern as a resort for
artists, or occasionally, later, to suit Edith's convenience, I
would take my lunch with me to the studio. During the afternoon I
made my own tea, and when the day's work was done I returned to the
cottage to spend the evenings alone with Edith. It was a quiet,
unbroken routine, completely to my liking, though Edith would go
out now and then to spend an hour or two with any friend who
happened to be living in the neighbourhood, and occasionally
friends at St. Ives or Lelant would be invited to lunch or dinner.
That long remained the usual course of our life together.</p>

<p>During these early years, however, the evenings were sometimes
devoted to joint-work. This was especially the case when in
February, 1894, I undertook with Edith's help as amanuensis to make
a complete, unexpurgated translation of Zola's <i>Germinal</i> for
private publication. We executed the whole of this together during
the evenings of a few months at the Cot. I dictated the translation
while she wrote the whole&mdash;a laborious task as the book is
long&mdash;in her swift, clear handwriting, without weariness or
complaint, now and then bettering my translation of dialogue with
some more idiomatic phrase. I had arranged to do this work for £50
simply to enlarge our little income, and we shared the sum between
us. In a somewhat similar way Edith took a share&mdash;with her
pen, for we were then only at the threshold of the typewriting
age&mdash;in the mechanical work of some of the translations which
I made, partly or entirely, for the Contemporary Science Series,
such as Ribot's <i>Psychology of the Emotions,</i> and would also
copy papers for me, until in the course of a few years her own work
developed and she no longer had the time or energy to render
assistance of this kind. Thenceforward I accomplished all my
literary work by myself with my own pen, sending it away when
finished, if necessary, to be professionally typewritten.</p>

<p>At Haslemere our movements were freer and less subject to
routine, while our lives generally were less strenuous. I would go
up to London for a few days every week or two to work at the
British Museum, to see friends, or to enjoy concerts, theatres,
music-halls, pictures, scientific meetings, and all the other
manifold things which interested me, while Edith with her
innumerable friends was able to gratify her warm social instincts.
Still even at Haslemere I accomplished much work in my pleasant
little study, ill adapted for literary purposes as was a room in a
small bungalow compared to my Cornish studio. I remember writing at
<i>Man and Woman</i> here, and it was here, walking up and down on
the grass in the twilight, that I thought out the General Preface
to my Sex <i>Studies.</i></p>

<p>I had already found out that my work must be done, especially
when it involved any original effort, in the open air. I have not,
indeed, so much thought out my work in the open air&mdash;I have
done that anywhere and everywhere&mdash;but actually written it in
the open, to an extent probably which few writers have equalled,
always in spacious and preferably rather bare spots, on the moor or
among the rocks&mdash;I could not write in a forest or a
cave&mdash;where there is sun and air and a large prospect of land
or sea. Many have remarked that they wonder how it is possible to
write under such conditions. It is natural to me, a naturalness
which may be part of my nearness to Nature, that quality of the
faun and the satyr which some of my friends see in me. It is under
such conditions that my best inspirations have come. It is,
moreover, only by living under such conditions that I have escaped
the feverish and nervous irritability which so often overcomes
those writers who work within four walls. Perhaps also it is this
habit, or this temperament, which caused people to remark with
surprise to me or to Edith that I had nothing of the appearance of
a literary man.</p>

<p>The ease with which I long retained an erect figure may be
connected with the fact that I have been in the habit of reclining
to write instead of stooping over a desk, and the suggestion of
"some great god Pan" which Edward Carpenter found in me may
possibly be due to much living with Nature in the open.</p>

<p>During these first quiet winters of our life together in the
little Cot at Carbis Bay various interests that were later to
absorb much of Edith's time and energy were initiated in their
small beginnings. Important among these was her first dog, Jock.
She used later to say that her little farm had originated with
Jock. He was a large dog of mixed breed, but a dog of great vigour,
character, independence and intelligence. She had first known him
as the most cherished possession of an old woman in the
neighbourhood, and would occasionally bring him a bone. Old Mrs.
Glasson was attached to him because he had been devoted to her
husband and had jealously guarded the old man's body when he fell
dead in a field; Edith used to say that for ever afterwards Jock
would stand still and look expectantly at any old man in the
distance who resembled Glasson. (It is I now who, as I pass along
the street, sometimes catching a glimpse of some firm little figure
like one I once so well knew, cannot help looking vaguely at the
woman's face it belongs to&mdash;and am reminded of Jock.) The old
woman, shortly before her own death, begged Edith to take charge of
the dog. Jock understood this, or at all events made a similar
arrangement for his future, and the very night his old mistress
died he ran to the Cot and installed himself there. He was large
for so small a place, but he had always been accustomed to live
indoors, and he was accepted without demur. Jock was the first of a
long series of dogs and cats, sometimes two or three of each at the
same time, on whom Edith expended much solicitude and trouble. But
none of them possessed so much individuality, caused so much
anxiety one way and another, or&mdash;as a result, no
doubt&mdash;absorbed so much of our affection as Jock. He was a dog
of tremendous spirit, almost neurotically energetic, absolutely
fearless, and more affectionate than obedient, in many ways,
indeed, rather like his mistress in temperament. Sometimes, also,
he seemed uncannily intelligent, and I recall, for instance, how
one day when a tedious visitor made an interminable afternoon call
at the Cot, Jock finally solved the situation by taking up the
visitor's gloves from a chair and solemnly placing them on her lap.
I was attached to him, in spite of all the trouble he caused us, as
I never was to any of his successors, and he had an affection for
me which dated more especially from a sad accident that once befell
him. I was taking him fora walk along the cliff to Hawkes Point
when, dashing along with his impetuous energy, he fell over the
edge down on to the rocks in the sea. With excellent pluck and
judgment he swam to the Point and was able to climb on to the dry
rocks before his strength was completely spent. I ran on to send
for assistance from the houses above, and then descended to stay
with him and comfort him till help arrived. Legs and ribs were
broken, and it was long before be recovered, but from that moment,
for some mysterious reason, he was almost as devoted to me as to
his mistress. In old age he became diseased and irritable, and
Edith decided to have him shot; this was done swiftly and
painlessly by our farm man in my presence, while Edith went away
into St. Ives, and that evening there were tears in the eyes of
both of us.</p>

<p>It was partly, though of course not entirely, to give exercise
to Jock that Edith, while still at the Cot, set up a dog-cart and
bought a pony. The pony, like the dog, though a vigorous little
animal, had never been properly broken in. Edith enjoyed mastering
Dolly but, as was wont to happen, she took far more risks than was
desirable. One evening, when I was sitting alone in the Cot,
awaiting her delayed return, she arrived, escorted by a stranger,
after an accident which might easily have been fatal. Dolly was
being carelessly led out of the market-garden on Lelant Hill by a
man when she suddenly broke away and dashed round the corner:
before Edith had time to gain control the dog-cart was completely
overturned and she was underneath. It might have been worse if a
passing young lady with fine presence of mind had not immediately
sat on the pony's head. As it was, Edith's head was hurt and an
injury to the nose was liable to produce trouble for years
afterwards. Dolly was disposed of, though not immediately, but she
had involved the hire of a stable and a field next door to the Cot,
and that had suggested the idea of a little farm.</p>

<p>That was the first though not the last time that Edith met with
injury, which on at least two subsequent occasions might also
easily have proved fatal. It was in the Cot also that she had her
first attack of pneumonia. This was a slight attack and she
recovered with fair ease, but later there were two other attacks
which proved more serious, with difficult recovery, and finally it
was from pneumonia that she died. It may be said that during these
early years of our life together at the Cot all the main influences
of her later life were established.</p>

<p>One day she came in and announced to me that she had taken the
Count House. I had received not the slightest intimation of this
beforehand, but I now knew her impulsive decision, her confident
self-reliance in practical matters that she regarded as within her
own sphere, and I cannot recall that I was greatly surprised. But
certainly the Count House, as it then appeared, would never have
commended itself to me as a possible home. Built some forty years
earlier, as the official business headquarters of the mine, the
Count House had been found of no use when the mine stopped working,
except as a brief summer resort for a St. Ives family. With windows
blocked up all the winter by boards, and never built for a home, it
had looked to me a peculiarly dreary, dilapidated, God-forsaken
building. But Edith always had an eye for the possibilities of a
place; the artist in her delighted to develop these possibilities.
Her artistic instincts in the domestic sphere were always right,
although her calculation as to the cost of her creative activities
were apt to be wrong. But on the whole it went well with the Count
House, though the repairs needed were considerable. It had a
beautiful outlook over sea and moor to start with, and it became a
fairly comfortable home. Its external bareness was relieved by
creepers; there was a passion-flower to please Edith, and an
Australian eucalyptus, which soon sprang up higher than the roof,
to please me.*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* This was given me by my interesting friend
Dr. Bonar, part of a consignment he had received from his old
friend in Sydney, Dr. Creed, who, it so chanced, had been the
doctor at Scone when I was there though I never met him, but came
to know him when later he spent a long period in England. He was a
man of vigorous personality and much mental activity, who became a
member of the New South Wales Legislative Council, wrote a book on
his experiences, and died at a very advanced age nearly half a
century after the Scone days. The tree, being too near the house,
was cut down after we left.]</p>

<p>We lived there for some twelve years. Much later it had become
the home of Mr. Bernard Leach, perhaps the chief art-potter of our
time, and he has affected various improvements in the house. He
told me lately that a prehistoric hut-dwelling had been discovered
just below the garden wall, and I was annoyed that I had not had
the skill to discover it, for it would have been a source of much
delight.</p>

<p>The justification for the move to the Count House was not only
the imperative need for a more spacious home than the miniature
Cot, but Edith's new impulse to farming, which might, it seemed,
alike benefit her health and assist her finances, while it
certainly seemed to gratify her native instincts for practical
activity and close contact with Nature and Earth. There were two or
three small fields (to which Edith later added others) attached to
the Count House, as well as a stable, and the farm began with one
cow. Miranda was a gentle and beautiful animal, so named by the
farmer nearby who had reared her, a cousin of Sir Henry Irving, who
named all his cows after Shakespearian heroines. Several cows were
later added, some born on the premises; there were two donkeys;
pig-breeding became a speciality; there was a large number of pigs
and fowls and ducks. My place in the farm, from the first, was
nowhere, though I might occasionally be called upon to kill a fowl.
A man was kept; there was a dairy-woman from outside, and two
servants in the house, cook and housemaid, who sometimes helped
with the farm-work. But Edith herself liked to be able to do
everything, even to plough, and really took an active part. She had
known nothing of farming and little of country life before settling
in Cornwall, but her keen interest, her vivid alert intelligence,
and the familiarity which it was so easy for her to establish with
labouring and farming people enabled her to master the mysteries of
the art with wonderful rapidity, and she never made serious
mistakes. The fowls were from the first almost entirely in her own
hands, and they absorbed much time, labour and thought; she used
incubators and was careful to secure the best breeds and to adopt
the best methods and foods, though she found in the end, as others
have found, that her sanguine expectations of ultimate profit in
this department were scarcely fulfilled. She bred pigs diligently,
and from time to time a butcher was sent for to kill one; on these
occasions she would go round beforehand to friends and neighbours
to obtain orders; then she would spend a long and arduous morning
in cutting up the carcass herself into the required joints (on one
of these occasions being discovered by a cultured West End friend
of her half-brother who unexpectedly arrived), and afterwards carry
some of them round in a basket to the purchasers. A considerable
amount of hay was made to stack or sell; but crops were on a very
small scale, though she cultivated flowers and vegetables. She had
indeed a deep, congenial love of the earth and its creative
energies. I shall never forget how, one morning after dressing, I
wandered to the window of her study and came suddenly on the vision
of her below, spade in hand, vigorously digging up potatoes, with
almost a fever of exhilaration, her face radiantly beautiful in its
animated joy.</p>

<p>From the first there was another practical activity associated
with the farm, the letting of furnished cottages. The Cot was not
given up when we moved into the Count House, but was let furnished.
Three other cottages in the neighbourhood were successively taken,
usually in the same quiet, prompt, decisive way as the Count House,
so that I seldom knew anything of the matter until it was virtually
settled. They were "artistically furnished" as the prospectus
stated, for Edith loved to pick up pretty things at sales and in
cottages, finally completing the operation with a copious supply of
fabrics from the best London shops, Liberty's especially, to make
curtains and hangings. Then with businesslike activity she
successfully set herself to find tenants for the cottages, in all
of which, also, we lived ourselves, at one time or another, for a
longer or shorter period as the Count House was occasionally let.
It was her aim, indeed her instinctive impulse, to do everything
she undertook thoroughly and well. Sometimes, when a cottage had to
be prepared at short notice for an incoming tenant, this involved
an undue strain on her strength; while, in the end, perhaps, the
little place she had spent so much trouble and skill in making
charming and cosy would be greeted with contemptuous disapproval by
some vulgar London suburban. She had, indeed, a strange series of
experiences&mdash;painful, entertaining, delightful&mdash;with
these cottages. The most extraordinarily varied people drifted into
them. Amid the sprinkling of stodgy suburbians there were exquisite
artists, noted men of letters, soldiers and diplomats, eccentric
foreign scholars, runaway unwedded couples, people with obscure
Continental titles, victims of alcohol and of morphia, on two
occasions mysterious and clever adventurers who of course escaped,
even when their true character had been discovered, without paying
rent.* But there were charming and lovely people among them, and
some of them became Edith's devoted friends and still cherish her
memory.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* The list&mdash;as I recall a few names at
random&mdash;included Henry Bishop, later A.R.A., a painter of
distinction who became a lasting friend, Somerset Maugham,
dramatist and novelist, Lutoslauski, the eminent Platonist scholar,
E. V. Lucas, one of the most prolific and versatile of authors,
Edward Garratt, well known South African editor, Major Pratt, a
pioneer in pacifism.]</p>

<p>The cottage industry proved fairly remunerative in Edith's
skilful hands, and it worked in with the farm, which supplied the
tenants with farm produce. But the farm began to flag after some
ten years or so. For this there were several reasons. It had never
been really profitable. Good management and even good prices were
not enough to make up for smallness of scale and the heavy charges
for labour, while during a long and serious illness of Edith's with
neuritis involving later for a time the use of crutches&mdash;the
most prolonged illness she had had since marriage and my time and
thought largely absorbed in nursing her&mdash;careless servants ran
up expenses unchecked, and serious losses made retrenchment
necessary. The increasing uncertainty of her health itself made the
strains and stresses of farm life undesirable. Moreover, as the
farm began to become a toilsome routine it also began to lose
interest for one whose alert and active mind was ever eager for the
novelty of new conquests. Afresh field was, indeed, opening before
her in the sphere of art, with her increasing impulse to write
novels, which was scarcely compatible with the constant and urgent
demands of farm life, and to produce plays, which involved much
time in London. There was yet another reason why she was becoming
alienated from farm life: she had always had a horror of the
slaughter of animals; in the ardour with which she adopted the
farming spirit, that horror had been temporarily suppressed; but it
began to re-assert itself more strongly than ever, and her
pronounced love of animals, her uncontrollably fierce hatred for
all cruelty to animals, were never so developed as during the
latter years of her life. The farm might, however, have lingered on
some years longer if it had not been brought to an end by what was
really a stroke of luck. An ingenious speculator had devised the
scheme of re-opening the mine to which the Count House was attached
and a Company was formed. The building was required for its
original purpose, but Edith was firmly secured with a long lease.
The Company offered £10 to clear us out, but Edith demanded, I
think, £200, and held out until it was paid. The Company soon
abandoned its mining efforts and failed. We used playfully to say
that it had only been formed to enable the farm to be brought to an
end. For there was no more farming; two animals only (except dogs
and cats) were left, an old horse and a donkey of charming
disposition (his one weakness a fondness for cigarettes) born on
the farm and the horse's inseparable companion; nothing would
induce Edith to sell them or separate them; she took a stable and a
field for them, and afterwards brought them up near London; they
were a source of trouble and expense until a year before her own
death; when they were growing old and diseased, she had them
mercifully killed, I watching the operation on her behalf, as when
Jock had been shot, more than fifteen years earlier.</p>

<p>It seems surprising to me that in thus narrating the chief
events of these years I never refer to my work, although I was all
the time living in it, with scarcely a day's intermission, and with
complete absence of all those recreations, amusements, social
engagements, etc., with which it is usual to space out "work." The
reason seems to be that for me "work" in the usual sense has
scarcely ever existed. I have always said that I have no aptitude
for "work;" that I can only play. What would be called work was for
me simply the atmosphere in which I lived, and there is nothing to
say about it because it was omnipresent. The imagery of the bee
collecting nectar, transforming it into honey and storing it in
cells, to furnish sweetness and light for mankind, has always been
attractive to me, as it seems to have been to Swift. I suppose the
reason is that it really expresses what might be considered the
unconscious ideal of my oven activities in life, and such
activities are so natural and spontaneous that there is little to
say about them. In 1916 Dr. Davenport wrote to me from the American
Station of Experimental Evolution:</p>

<p class="quote">"You seem to me about the only English writer with
whom I am acquainted who uses the facts of social behaviour as
facts of natural history to be discussed as any other biological
facts."</p>

<p>I had not been definitely conscious of such an attitude, but the
remark interested and pleased me. It seemed to indicate the kind of
natural history atmosphere in which I spontaneously move. I should
be inclined to attribute it to that natural history temper which
certainly marks the East Anglian people from whom I so largely
spring.</p>

<p>Early in 1894 my sister had given up the house at St. Mary's
Terrace, Paddington, and I had joined Arthur Symons at Fountain
Court in the Temple, moving there my small possessions at
Paddington, in order to retain a little foothold in London, where I
could stay for a few days or weeks at a time to work at the British
Museum, or to see friends and interview people on literary
business, especially in connection with my Contemporary Science
Series, which was at this time in active progress and my chief
source of income. In the autumn of the same year Edith and I gave
up the delicious summer bungalow in Rollo Russell's grounds at
Haslemere and sold the furniture. There was, however, no question
of her sharing my little foothold at Fountain Court; it was too
small and she had not the slightest wish to live in London. After
spending so much of her life in London, and enduring so many
painful or tedious experiences there, she was at this period of her
life athirst for the free and beautiful life of Nature in the
country and had grown in love with Cornwall. When she wanted to
come to London she would spend a few days with friends, and once or
twice we stayed together for a night or two at an hotel near the
Strand. Carbis, where a new life seemed to be opening out, remained
her sole home for a number of years, and during those same years
was my headquarters. Now and then, though seldom in the winter, I
would run up to London for a fortnight or so, and every year or two
I would go with Symons for some six weeks of wandering abroad,
which it was always a joy for me to plan carefully long beforehand,
Symons being content that I should organise, though in smaller
details, and on the actual journey, he was often the leader.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1894 I had indeed gone by myself (for Symons
was then making a prolonged stay in Venice) to Italy on what I
always regard as the most glorious of all my foreign tours, full
throughout of unalloyed delight, and favoured by perfect weather.
It was in connection with the International Medical Congress in
Rome. On my arrival I was visited at my hotel by Lombroso and
Tamburini; and they appointed me a secretary of the Psychiatric
Section (an honour due to my book, <i>The Criminal</i>), where I
met Ferri, Marro and others whose names and work were familiar to
me, including Dr. Kurella, who later became the friendly translator
of my Sex <i>Studies</i> and finally died during the Great War. But
I took my duties lightly. I spent nearly all my time in rambling,
in ecstasy and at random, about the great city I had all my life
desired to see, and found&mdash;an almost unique
experience&mdash;that it even surpassed my anticipations. It is
only in Rome, as I still continue to feel, that one realises what
it means to belong to the human species. It was the classic Rome
that absorbed me, and to such an extent that the memory of Shelley
never once entered my head though in earlier years the pyramid of
Cestius near where his ashes repose had seemed to me the most sa
ced spot in Rome. Then I went on to Naples and visited Capri, where
I found the famous Blue Grotto disappointing, spent a memorable day
at Pompeii, and revelled among the treasures of the delightful
Naples Museum. On the way back I joined Symons for a few days in
Venice, though I stayed in the house on the Zattere of the
hospitable scholar Horatio Brown, J. A. Symonds's friend and
literary executor, who met me in true Venetian fashion at the
railway station in his gondola and conveyed me to his door on the
canal.</p>

<p>Three years later I went to the next International Medical
Congress in Moscow, and on this occasion Symons was with me all the
time. We fitted in a visit to Munich and Bayreuth for
<i>Parsifal</i> on the way, as well as to Warsaw, and took St.
Petersburg (as it then was), Prague, Budapest, Vienna, and the
Rhine on the return journey. This expedition, full of deep
interest, was alloyed by various discomforts, especially by the
tedious journeys and the extreme (quite unusual) heat of Moscow. In
both expeditions medical objects played the smallest part in my
aims. I had by this time altogether abandoned any thought I might
once have had of general medical practice and saw the last of it in
1894, when once more I went as <i>locum tenens</i> to Probus, and
felt on leaving that such work was not for me. (When again in
demand for the year following at Probus I introduced Barker Smith
in my place, and for many years after he was my appreciated
successor there.) But I have never ceased to be to some degree in
touch with general medical work, and have remained throughout a
member of the British Medical Association, for which, at my
election, as I am always pleased to remember, I had two such
distinguished sponsors as Hack Tuke and Augustus Waller.</p>

<p>Fountain Court, with the two little rooms which I rented from
Symons until he gave up the chambers on his marriage in 1901, was
for my purposes absolutely ideal. The chambers consisted of four
rooms at the top of the building, two overlooking the Court and
occupied by Symons, two of smaller size overlooking Essex Street
which were mine. A narrow passage joined Symons's rooms to mine,
but there were two separate doors on to the landing (double doors,
so that, when we wished, it was possible for each of us separately
to "sport the oak" and exclude importunate callers) and each of us
with his visitors was completely shut off and independent of the
other, while yet we were in close touch whenever we so desired. It
was part of the arrangement that Symons should be free to put
anyone else in my rooms when I was away in Cornwall; I do not
recall that he ever made use of this freedom except during one
season for W. B. Yeats the poet, and again to instal Verlaine
during his brief visit to London. On that occasion Verlaine wrote a
little poem about the "Coin exquis de ce coin délicat."</p>

<p>That indeed is how it appeared to me and how it will always
remain in memory. It was an oasis of silence and beauty in the
midst of the City desert. I still think with pleasure of the Court
bordered on one side by the ancient Middle Temple Hall rich in
memorable associations, of the fountain gently plashing, of the
tree beside it with the seat on which on summer nights, when the
Temple gates were closed, Symons and I would sometimes come out to
sit in the silent Court, now become as a Court of the Alhambra,
marvellous in its deep peace only broken by the gentle plash of the
water.</p>

<p>It was pleasant, too, to have at hand so agreeable and congenial
a companion always so delightfully fresh, so vivaciously Celtic, in
his sensitive appreciation of the beauty of things. It was
pleasant, again, when one grew tired of talking of art or of life,
to lie back on his lounge and listen as he played the piano, or to
accompany him to music-halls, for as music-hall critic to the
<i>Star</i> he had the entry to all, and they were then at their
finest and most distinctive period of evolution.*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* In the <i>British Journal of Medical
Psychology,</i> Vol. XII, Part IV (1932), appeared an elaborate
article by an American medical writer entitled: "The Case of Arthur
Symons: The Psychopathology of a Man of Letters." This study is,
throughout, incorrect and misleading. The writer, though familiar
with Symons's writings and aware of his insanity in later life (of
which Symons himself published a version) had never met him, had
failed to understand his temperament and wrongly diagnosed his
mental disorder. His "facts" are frequently perverted or imaginary,
his conception of Symons's character opposed to the reality, his
deductions astray, and his interpretation of the books he quotes
unreliable. The Editors of the <i>Journal</i> (who had not known
that Symons was still living) much regretted the publication but
decided that nothing could be done to mend matters.]</p>

<p>It was pleasant, also, to be able to wander down on to the
Embankment in the twilight on every evening, and walk up and down
between Blackfriars Bridge and Westminster Bridge, ravished by
this, at that hour, loveliest scene that I know in any city of the
world. It was in those years I discovered that loveliness and I
cherish it still. Now indeed (I write in war time) this magic
beauty has attained an exquisite height it never touched before.
For of old there were always crude glares one had to overlook; they
are all gone now, and for the first time, and perhaps the last, we
see all the undesigned magnificence of that mysterious dream which
Nature and Man have wrought together on the evening waters of the
Thames. When at last Symons gave up his chambers I was not there to
bid that loved spot farewell. I have never felt able to enter
Fountain Court since, often as I have passed its gates. But it
amuses me to think that I accidentally retained the key to my rooms
on that upper floor and could enter them by stealth this evening if
I so wished.</p>

<p>The foothold of those little rooms not only enabled me to go
easily about London by day and by night, but was convenient for
seeing friends and acquaintances. It was here that my relationship
with Amy slowly ripened into intimacy, for her home was in the
suburbs within easy reach. Nothing was concealed from Edith. But
there were difficulties of various kinds, and even for years I was
not happy over the relationship, for all the peace and refreshment
it brought me. Especially it troubled me that Edith, often
obscurely and sometimes definitely, resented it, notwithstanding
that she herself exercised, and had initiated, a freedom which I
regarded as identical. There arose, moreover, entanglements on
Amy's side which I need not explain&mdash;though there would be no
discredit for any of us in explaining them&mdash;which led to
incidents painful alike to Amy and to me and to Edith. I had not
desired, I may say, that Amy should in any way whatever bind
herself to me; I told her that I could not answer for my affection,
that very likely it would not last, and that she must regard
herself as perfectly free. At one time I felt that the situation
was intolerable. I resolved to terminate the relationship and to
cease seeing or corresponding with Amy, while she on her side,
willing to second what seemed to me best, took a situation on the
Continent and remained there for several years. But on my side the
resolution was a complete failure. As soon as I felt completely cut
oft from Amy my dejection became so obvious that Edith clearly saw
it was useless to expect me to be able to persist in the effort.
After only a few weeks I was again in correspondence with Amy.
Still much had been achieved even by this failure. It enabled me to
realise that whether or not this relationship was to be a big thing
in my life I could not destroy it by a mere exercise of will power.
It enabled Edith to see that I had at all events been willing to
make an effort, though in vain, and that the situation must be
accepted. Then the whole problem was thrust into the background
during three years when Amy was abroad and I was unable to see her
except on her rare visits to England, or when I chanced in the
course of a Continental tour to contrive a meeting of a few hours.
Thus in the end Edith and I conquered a difficulty which might well
have been fatal to our union. I should say that she never at any
time felt any personal dislike for Amy, who was indeed of a sweet
and generous nature which attracted the affection of all, men and
women alike, who knew her. As the years passed, Edith placed more
and more confidence in Amy and it became a genuine satisfaction to
her to know that in her own absence Amy was near me. On her part,
Amy had never shown the slightest sign, even in the most intimate
moments with me, of animosity against Edith: it would have been
unreasonable, indeed, but in such matters people are not
reasonable, women least of all, and therefore it is worth noting
that we never discussed together Edith's attitude or temperament.
That would to me have been an impossible disloyalty, and Amy
instinctively respected my feelings. Edith sometimes found this a
little difficult to believe; but it was true. She had a horror of
being "talked over." It was also a torture to her to think that
anyone would feel "sorry" for her. That remained a trouble when all
other trouble in the matter had passed. She was reconciled to the
facts, but when she knew or suspected that they might be a subject
of scandal among people who would be "sorry for her," she felt the
situation intolerable.</p>

<p>It was a long time before there was complete and permanent
reconcilement in her mind. "Life is so funny," she wrote me in
August, 1895, "but really nothing matters but love, and I love you
dearly and truly for always." That was her fundamental faith. Yet
during many, many years there would be occasional revulsions and
outbursts of bitterness. She would sometimes say that what she felt
(though I could have said the same of most of the women to whom she
was herself intimately attracted) was that Amy lacked the strength
of character and mental force which could alone make it safe and
fitting for her to enter our hies. But Edith herself possessed
fully all the power of mind and character which I needed in an
intimate soul comrade. They are precious qualities but are not
necessarily accompanied by other previous qualities of sweetness
and gentleness which I also craved and found in Amy. I felt, and I
still feel now that all is over, that I could do no other, that
under all the circumstances my attitude was not unreasonable, and
that even if by a great effort I could have thrust away from me for
ever that beautiful influence which soothed my life, I should
merely have succeeded in crushing my own spirit, with whatever
possibilities for use in the world it possessed. Yet also at the
same time I well understood how Edith, too, with her special
temperament, could be no other than she was, that her moments of
wounded pride for herself, and even for me, were inevitable, and I
could not resent her resentment, for I knew that with her pride the
deep springs of her love also gushed forth. So I shared her pain,
even if I sometimes rose in rebellion against it, as well as
endured my own.</p>

<p>I find traces of those revulsions of hers in letters written a
few years ahead. In March, 1898, both Claire and Amy
notwithstanding, she could end up a letter: "I miss you terribly,
my own Love, who are woman and man. Your own child Wifie." A year
later she had gone in June to stay with a friend in London, leaving
me at Carbis to keep an eye on the animals and the servants. It so
chanced that just then Amy was staying not far away in Cornwall and
she proposed to come over for a few hours one day to my Studio. I
mentioned this to Edith. In her next letter, in which she tries to
comfort me in the loneliness of which I had complained, she writes:
"Do cheer up, sweetheart, and if you <i>must</i> spoil Carbis Bay
for me, why do, for after all she can never rob me of all the best
and sweetest memories of my life which laugh in the blue sea and
will never be stolen by a mere player at life's realities." I had
not the faintest wish to spoil Carbis Bay, but it scarcely seemed
to me that Amy's little visit&mdash;which I could hardly have
forbidden even if I wished to&mdash;could possibly do that. It duly
took place&mdash;though I was careful not to accompany her when she
went to see St. Ives and in my scrupulosity never showed her even
the outside of the Count House&mdash;and left a benediction of
lovely memory which soothed me for long afterwards.</p>

<p class="caption">Ellis in his Study at Hawkes Point, Carbis Bay,
1897</p>

<p>Edith, as was often the case, reacted from her sudden outburst.
Ten days later I find her writing from Claire's home, to which she
had moved on:</p>

<p class="quote">"My Love, your letter is indeed a veritable
epistle of St. John, and it has done me more good than all the
heart exercises and drugs in London. I only have realised lately
how much more I love you than I ever did, or you could not make me
suffer so hideously. And though I may not yet comprehend you, you
also don't quite see why I feel things; but all is sure to come
right, for love carries folk through everything in the end...I'll
soon be back and nestle you close to my silly heart and see if that
will do it good."</p>

<p>A little later she wrote to me from Carbis:</p>

<p class="quote">"The demand that when we love that love should be
true to <i>us</i> and to our share in it is all anyone who lives
and thinks can ask: to <i>demand</i> more is to court deception,
estrangement, and misery. I've arrived at this conclusion after
<i>intense</i> suffering about Amy, but I shall never suffer again.
Do what you will&mdash;be what you will and don't feel you must
ever <i>make</i> me understand. I shall ask no questions; but we
will be both free in the real sense of the word&mdash;free to
respect and love the love of others, free to <i>trust</i> our own
love in the face of everything...This is the best of me, so I give
it to you as a gift from the woman who loves you."</p>

<p>It was probably about this time (as usual my letter is undated)
that I wrote to her from Carbis, where she had left me in
charge:</p>

<p class="quote">"I am well and peaceful and working&mdash;but
always with a yearning unsatisfied ache of love to you in my heart.
There is no news; everything goes on quite well and the hirelings
seem to be always working&mdash;an immense lot of painting and
tarring done by Robert last week. Your letter is gentle. But I can
see you do not understand, even the tiniest bit. I wish that in
love people could see straight into each other's hearts and that it
was not necessary to try to put things into words which are always
inadequate. I may do things that hurt you on the surface and for
the time, because I am a person who must love in my own way and my
love would be poisoned if it were forced; but if you could only
<i>see,</i> you would know that right deep down I belong, and
always must belong, wholly to you, and that I could never do
anything that would <i>really</i> hurt you when you understood
exactly what it meant. Human beings are very complex things, and no
one can have a human being constituted <i>exactly</i> as he would
like&mdash;probably we shouldn't like it even then&mdash;but it is
a very great deal to have the fundamentals right."</p>

<p>Again she wrote to me from London (after describing the physical
exercises which by the physician's advice she was learning, under a
good teacher, in order to improve the condition of her heart and to
reduce the tendency she was now showing to put on fat):</p>

<p class="quote">"I am feeling ever so much happier and very close
and sweet to you: your last letters have made me feel and know
things that are lovelier to know than if events had never come to
produce them. I am much more terribly in love with you than I have
ever been; but you too must have patience with my way of doing
things and seeing things. To feel close to you and sweet is the
best cure for my heart&mdash;of that I am sure. I love to feel you
my child, but I get 'uppish' when the man of science is too
rampant; the best thing we can all be, is to be little children.
I'm getting sicker and wearier than ever of complex things and
modern things.&mdash;Your letter has just come and I smiled: if
<i>you</i> could sce into <i>my</i> heart you'd see I'm ashamed at
my want of faith (an inherited vice), and that I hate confessing
I'm wrong, but I believe I've been making a huge mistake&mdash;so
there! Chuckle over that, but try and go on loving me, for to me
'Thee art the one man i' all the world as I do love!' God knows I
ache to hold you to my breast at last."</p>

<p>The fluctuations continued when any jar, real or imagined,
occurred to cause them. Six weeks later I left her peacefully happy
in Carbis with the old lady, Mrs. Drake, whom she always called
"the Mother." On August 3rd she wrote:</p>

<p class="quote">"I think of you and love you and
wonder!&mdash;wonder much in the mother part of me and in the wife
part too. You are as free as air&mdash;choose whichever way seems
the sweetest and best to you, for I am sure to bind is to lose and
to fetter is to destroy [words she again applied to love, nearly
twenty years later, in her book on Hinton]. I shall never leave you
nor forsake you: the only thing that can happen is a shadow, but
that may disappear in time. I am more complex than you have ever
guessed: you are more impenetrative in some ways than I ever knew.
I am a devil, you are a saint&mdash;the complexities that arise are
manifold. But love solves more than this. I am growing strong now
to live, and it is best, for I'd hate to leave you in the silence
where you could never explain and I could never understand. As it
is&mdash;all is bound to be well in the end."</p>

<p>A week later she wrote:</p>

<p class="quote">"My own sweet Baby, eh! man! thee ought not to go
far from your mammy's apron-strings for thee wants thy bottle
sadly! I wish I had kept that letter of yours, but if you
<i>meant</i> nothing against me, well, I am sorry I read it as
such. You never realise what a proud devil I am, and how I eat my
heart and soul out rather than stoop to the one I love best i' all
the world. I ran to send a wire to comfort you, darling, and I
trust it will, for I long to put my arms round you and cheer
you...Try and be happy and know I am always <i>really</i> in love
with you, but I fear I'm a woeful proud crittur. My heart is not
quite right yet somehow, but a real loving letter from you will
soon set it so, your own Sweetheart."</p>

<p>It is not to be supposed that these episodes are of frequent
occurrence in the letters, which during all these years&mdash;never
more so than between 1895 and 1900&mdash;are for the most part full
of sweetness and tenderness, of playful banter, of all the little
intimacies of daily life. It is only at intervals that there occurs
such a letter as&mdash;a few months later than the last
quoted&mdash;the following:</p>

<p class="quote">"My poor Boy, my heart is aching and aching for
you, and my eyes (not boy's eyes but woman's eyes) keep filling at
the thought of you. Oh! dear, oh dear! <i>why</i> have you and I to
keep making one another miserable, when no other person could ever
be really as much to the other as you and I are? Try and be cheered
a wee for it <i>must</i> all come right in time and we may be ever
so much nearer through it. I feel an intense desire to see you, and
am sad and tired, and want you to realise I want to make you happy,
but like you I can't do it at the expense of all my
personality...Come home, dear, dear child, and you shall be fed and
hushed and comforted by your wifie."</p>

<p>It was probably somewhere about this time that she wrote out and
sent me Emily Dickinson's poem "Proof" on the tests of love,
ending:</p>

<p class="poem">"This dost thou doubt, sweet?<br>
Then have I<br>
Nothing to show<br>
But Calvary."</p>

<p>The path of love may well have sometimes seemed to each of us
the path of Calvary. But, as all Christendom has testified, the
path of Calvary is not the path of failure.</p>

<p>Thus we slowly achieved the conquest of a great difficulty. But
it must be added that in the process our marital relationship in
the narrow sense was permanently brought to an end. This happened
on Edith's proposal, I no longer know in what year, and in our
letters there is not the slightest change by which it might be
detected. I made not the slightest objection. On her side, in
addition to any feeling she had regarding my relationship to Amy,
she had experienced from the outset a dislike to the mechanical
contraceptive preliminaries of intercourse. On my side I felt that
in this respect we were relatively unsuited to each other, that
relations were incomplete and unsatisfactory, too liable to jar on
one or other of the partners. The loss was in our case a gain. We
had secured all that that "golden key to the deepest secrets of
intimacy" has to give and we could now develop our relationship
better without it. In all other respects our physical intimacy
remained the same, and nearly to the end we would find consolation
in lying or sleeping together, a nearness she sometimes deeply
craved. Some years after the period I am here concerned with, it
happened once that&mdash;whether by deliberate resolve or sudden
impulse I never knew&mdash;Edith proposed to me that we should go
back to our early relations and henceforth suffice to each other. I
allowed the proposal to drop without discussion and she never
brought it forward again. The whole matter seemed entirely to pass
from our minds; so much remained that it seemed to leave no
blank.</p>

<p>It is, I know, not uncommon, almost indeed the rule, after some
years of married life, for the passion with which it may have begun
to die down into calm friendship or cool indifference, or worse.
With us the real love&mdash;it was scarcely passion&mdash;gave
place to none of these things. On the contrary, it grew; it grew
into passion, and this more than a spiritual passion since the
yearning tenderness of the body was not excluded. Only one thing
was left out, a real and definite thing, yet so small in comparison
to all that was left that we scarcely missed it. Even years after
her death and all was in seeming over, I would find myself
exclaiming inwardly: My sweetheart!</p>

<p>The greatest of all the revelations which my life with Edith
brought me was this discovery that not only affection but the
deepest passion of love can exist and develop continuously even
when the relationship of sex in the natrow sense has ceased to
exist. That it may require some such relationship for its
foundation, I believe. But what I have learnt is that passionate
love&mdash;that is to say a love deeper and more intimately moving
than simple affection&mdash;may continue for ever in its absence
and stir the heart long years after the woman who inspired it is
dead. I know by experience that love can last as long as we last. I
know how it is that in old days when they expected to Hie again
they said that love is "eternal." I can understand that threefold
sigh of joy over a dead lover: <i>Amavimus Amamus Amabimus.</i></p>

<p>It is time to refer to an event of a more external nature which
made a mark on the lives of both of us, and for my own work in the
world was of far-reaching significance: the prosecution of the
first published volumes of my Sex <i>Studies</i> for "obscenity."
This took place in 1898. But first I must touch on Edith's literary
activities which, on a serious scale, began in this year and
chanced to be connected with my <i>Studies.</i> I have indicated
that the early years of marriage were for her a time of comparative
repose and freedom and expansion. But her energetic nature soon
began to manifest itself. The practical details of domesticity, the
occasional help she at first gave to me as an amanuensis, the
progress of her continuously developing career as a lecturer and
speaker, the pressure of intimate emotional struggles and those
duties of friendship which she always took so seriously, the ever
increasing activities of the little farm&mdash;all these were not
enough to absorb her. She also found herself as an artist (which
she slowly came to feel her chief function) and wrote her first and
most powerful novel, <i>Kit's Woman,</i> or, as it was entitled in
the first edition, <i>Seaweed.</i> This was begun even before we
moved into the Count House, and was completed by 1898. I call it
her first novel, for she herself attached no importance to the
story called <i>Love and Honour,</i> which she wrote at about the
age of eighteen, to run through numerous numbers of the
<i>Manchester Magazine,</i> though it was never even completed.
<i>Kit's Woman</i> was a real work of art, well planned and well
balanced, original and daring, the genuinely personal outcome of
its author, alike in its humour and its firm deep grip of the great
sexual problems it is concerned with, centring around the relations
of a wife to a husband who by an accident has become impotent. I
say it was "genuinely personal," but it is not, I now add, till
long after I wrote those words that it has seemed to me that the
story was consciously or unconsciously inspired by her own
relations with me and of course completely transformed by the
artist's hand into a new shape. In that shape it splendidly
presents exactly what I have attempted to present in the preceding
pages: the triumph of a deeper passionate love over physical
passion.</p>

<p>The bold sincerity of the book's outlook and the occasional
unconventional freedom of its language caused it to be banned
sometimes by prudish people, and offensively classed by
coarse-minded people. But there should have been no doubt about the
real natural purity and lofty idealism which inspired the book, and
still less concerning its splendid assertion of the spiritual
supremacy of love. It received the warm commendation, even the
enthusiastic admiration, of many excellent judges; in my opinion,
which may be prejudiced, it is a book too good to be allowed to
die. But it was too outspoken a book to find a publisher easily and
it thus came about that it was accepted by the unconventional
publisher who had already just arranged to issue my
<i>Studies.</i></p>

<p>For many years I had been slowly working my way towards those
<i>Studies,</i> which I regarded as my chief life-work. In 1894 I
had published <i>Man and Woman: a Study of Human Secondary Sexual
Characters,</i> which constituted the prolegomena to the
<i>Studies,</i> in the sense that it was a book to be studied and
read in order to clear the ground for the study of sex in the
central sense in which I was chiefly concerned with it. <i>Man and
Woman,</i> primarily undertaken for my own edification, had itself
been developing from very small beginnings during some ten years.
It embodied not only much careful thinking and balanced
generalisation, but far more tedious labour in the collection,
sifting, and classification of data than appear on the surface. It
received almost no attention at all from reviewers, who had given
so much attention to my first two books four years before, in part
perhaps because of the very various aspect of the subject it
presented, in part possibly because it included a chapter on
menstruation which alarmed modest editors. But it had a large and
continuous sale through several revised editions (the eighth and
last in 1934) and in various languages, it stimulated workers in
several fields to initiate new and fruitful investigation, it
received privately the high commendation of authorities of
different kinds. I was especially pleased when Dr. Beddoe, then the
chief English anthropologist, always kind and helpful to me as to
many others, wrote pleasantly that it was "a great little
book."</p>

<p>That task being completed, I turned to the <i>Studies</i>
themselves. The volume I resolved to put into shape first was
"Sexual Inversion." That resolve was a mistake. It was indeed a
kind of accident. Homosexuality was an aspect of sex which up to a
few years before had interested me less than any, and I had known
very little about it. But during those few years I had become
interested in it. Partly I had found that some of my own most
highly esteemed friends were more or less homosexual (like Edward
Carpenter, not to mention Edith), and partly I had come into touch
through correspondence with John Addington Symonds, for whose work
I had once had an admiration which somewhat decreased with years.
He had already printed privately two small books on the subject,
one on Greek paiderastia, and another, more novel, but of less
value, on the modern aspects of the question. He was feeling his
way towards the open publication of a comprehensive work on the
subject. He now proposed to join forces with me. I agreed and I
drew up a scheme of the book with the parts I proposed to be
assigned to each author. He accepted my scheme, remarking that I
had assigned the most important chapters to myself, but making no
demur. I had no wish to take the chief share, but it seemed clear
to me that it was on the scholarly and historical side alone that
Symonds could properly come into the book. He set to work on his
share of the collaboration and he sent me a collection of
"histories" he had been able to collect among friends; these were
duly included in the work I eventually published. But before we
could make any progress or even meet, Symonds died, suddenly,
during an epidemic of influenza, in Rome. Thus our attempt at
collaboration came to nought. I do not regret it. A highly
individual writer cannot write in association with another writer,
all the less if they are both highly individual. In the early days
of my friendship with Olive Schreiner we planned to write a paper
together but speedily realised that it was impossible. Arthur
Symons and I planned to write a volume of essays on Spain together,
and that plan also was eventually abandoned as impracticable. The
collaboration with Symonds would have been still more unfortunate,
not only because of incongruity of style but because the
significance of a book on inversion would have been greatly
discounted by the fact that one of the writers was known to many as
personally concerned in the question of homosexuality. But I
loyally attempted, though already rather doubtful of their value,
to use as much as possible of Symonds's booklets and other
fragments, and in this I had the consent of his literary executor,
Horatio Brown. For the first version of the book, with the joint
authorship declared on the title-page; I succeeded through my good
friend and translator, Dr. Hans Kurella, in finding (in 1896) a
German publisher before I had found one in England. Kurella
entitled it for the German public (though this title was not one I
approved of) <i>Das Konträre Geschlechtsgefühl.</i> It was never
published in English, for at the last moment, when the English
edition was already bound and on the eve of publication, the
Symonds family seem to have taken alarm and Brown bought up the
edition, though numerous copies nevertheless (not of course by my
connivance nor to my benefit) succeeded in getting into
circulation.</p>

<p>That was in 1898. I go back to the interval after German
publication when my thoughts were occutied with the question of a
suitable English publisher. I selected Williams and Norgate as a
small firm who issued quietly some serious scientific books, and
thus seemed fitting publishers for mine. It so happened that they
submitted my MS. to the judgment of a dear and highly valued friend
of mine, a distinguished alienist, Dr. Hack Tuke. He had for nearly
ten years previously, as editor of the <i>Journal of Mental
Science</i> and in other ways, been helpful to me, and had a high
opinion of my co-operation; the relationship had taken on a
friendly character and he had invited me to his country house and
introduced me to his wife.*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* It is a small world, and long years after
her death I learnt that I had an interesting link with Mrs. Hack
Tuke. I possess a fine miniature, handed down from my maternal
grandmother, of Mrs. Stickney, who was the mother of Mrs. William
Ellis, no relation of mine but a famous and prolific author in her
time. Both mother and daughter (who in early life had lived in
Suffolk) were friends of my grandmother's, my mother told us, and I
had long wanted to know more of the Stickneys. When I found
recently that Mrs. Hack Tuke was by birth a Stickney, and closely
related to the attractive Mrs. Stickney of my miniature, I was much
annoyed that the discovery came too late.]</p>

<p>Hack Tuke was not prudish or illiberal, but he was a Quaker
brought up in an old-fashioned school, which could not possibly
view sympathetically any detailed approach to the problems of sex.
He advised Williams and Norgate against publication. At the same
time, with characteristic loyalty, he told me of the advice he had
been asked and had given, and explained his position: as a book for
specialists he had nothing to say against my study, but he felt
that a book could never be confined to specialists, and so might
exert a demoralising influence. "There are always," he said, "the
compositors!" I had not the slightest resentment at his attitude,
which I accepted as inevitable, and his regard for me remained
unchanged; our friendly relations continued as before, until his
death which followed not long after, and before the book was
published.</p>

<p>Then I heard through an able scientific friend, whose own
original work received but little recogntion, F. H. Perry-Coste
(later he wrote it "Perrycoste"), of what seemed a most promising
opening for publication. A man of some wealth, he told me,
interested in scientific and philosophic subjects which made no
appeal to the larger public, was about to set up a small printing
and publishing house for the unostentatious issue of a few such
works. This seemed exactly the sort of publisher I wanted. He was a
certain "Mr. J. Astor Singer," and his agent in London was his
brother-in-law, a certain "Dr. Roland de Villiers." The former was
always in the background and never visible, but I was soon in the
presence of the latter, undoubtedly a German, probably of the
Rhine, though familiar with English, a large, gentle, fleshy man
with something of the aspect and the stealthy tread of a cat. The
publication was speedily and easily arranged on a financial basis
which, under all the circumstances, I regarded as satisfactory.
From that point of view, indeed, I had no serious complaint against
De Villiers; he fulfilled his pecuniary engagement with me and it
is quite possible under the circumstances that the author obtained
more money from the book than the publisher. Nor could I seriously
complain of the other volumes which he proceeded to arrange to
bring out in conjunction with mine. They were, indeed, not all
scientific or sociological, for they included Edith's novel,
<i>Seaweed,</i> but they were serious and original books, and when
they dealt with sex it was in a manner which I regarded as entirely
proper. But as I learnt to know more about De Villiers, various
puzzling and rather disquieting traits began to become clear. He
was tricky. After first giving the publishing firm a name which
suggested connection with one of the most famous London publishing
houses, he finally fixed on another name, the Watford University
Press, which was even more objectionabie, since there was not the
faintest ground for dragging in the word "University." He had,
indeed, it appeared, a perverse love of mystification even for its
own sake. The mysterious "Mr. Singer," the supposed wealthy
principal in the concern, of whom De Villiers would speak with
reverential awe, was always out of reach; sometimes he was staying
on the Riviera; if much wanted he was travelling in Mexico; clearly
he was a creation of De Villiers' brain. There was, however, "Mrs.
Singer" living in the same fine house with De Villiers, ostensibly
his sister-in-law, but really, I was in time given to understand,
his wife; the money employed in the transactions was largely in her
name. It began to appear that "Dr. de Villiers" himself was largely
a fiction.</p>

<p>The fact was that Perry-Coste, who thought to do me a service by
telling me of this opening for publication, really knew nothing of
De Villiers; he was misled by Mr. (later the Right Hon.) J. M.
Robertson, who, in his turn, had himself been misled to the extent
of publishing two or three books with De Villiers, and transferring
to him the magazine he had previously edited himself. We were all
misled. None of us had the slightest idea who "De Villiers" was.
Only the police knew, and at first even they were ignorant. So far
as I am concerned, I never knew the details of De Villiers' career
even twenty years afterwards, until, literally, yesterday, when at
length I had the curiosity to read the history of the prosecution
of my book as contained in a volume of reminiscences entitled <i>At
Scotland Yard,</i> written by Mr. John Sweeney and published six
years after the trial. Sweeney was the detective charged by
Scotland Yard to work up the case. His account of the whole affair
is clear and intelligent, even amusing, and, allowing for the fact
that it naturally takes for granted the police point of view, quite
fairly accurate wherever I can check it. He states that the real
name of "Dr. Roland de Villiers" was Georg Ferdinand Springmuhi von
Weissenfeld, born in Germany, and the son of an eminent judge; he
was educated at Giessen, where he obtained high honours in science,
medicine, and literature, and married a German lady of good family.
By his dubious conduct, however, he became estranged from his
father, and at length, after forging cheques, he fled from Germany
and settled in England in 1880. Here he lived as a swindler and was
once sentenced to twelve months hard labour for forgery and other
offences. He practised all sorts of frauds. Once he established a
Brandy Distillery Company, Ltd., which consisted only of himself,
and by circulating prospectuses containing photographs of
vineyards, none of which belonged to him, he secured capital to the
amount of about £60,000, out of which he paid a dividend of ten per
cent. He accumulated innumerable aliases, and to avoid confusing
the identity of the various characters he had invented he kept a
register in which he entered each alias with its own specific
signature. He and his wife, also, had thirty distinct banking
accounts in London under different names. Even his servants were
used to aid his mystifications, and housemaids, cooks, and nurses
would at times pose in the drawing-room, robed in excessively smart
gowns, as the wives and daughters of statesmen, ambassadors, and
other celebrities. There are also tales of his unscrupulous sexual
depravity. Sweeney, who speaks with authority on this matter, calls
him "a fascinating criminal," even "the most extraordinary criminal
of modern times." Of all this I knew nothing whatever. The whole
man, however, it eventually became clear to me, was a mass of
mystification. I never regarded him as a criminal; even now it
seems to me that he was essentially a man afflicted by a peculiar
mental trait which it would have been psychologically interesting
to investigate. He was always seeking to mystify others, even in
the smallest matters. But he was himself the chief victim of his
mystifications and died of them at last.</p>

<p><i>Sexual Inversion</i> appeared with no undue delay. The
Watford University Press had laid down expensive linotype printing
plant, and the appearance of the volume was unexceptionable. It was
issued quietly, as I had desired, only announced by prospectuses
posted to doctors and others, and sent for review to a few medical
and scientific journals. Not many reviews appeared, but they were
respectful and appreciative without being enthusiastic. This was
all I had expected or desired. But suddenly things altogether
ceased to be as I expected or desired.</p>

<p>There happened in those days to be in London a little Society
called the Legitimation League for the advocacy of unconventional
ideas on marriage and parenthood, upholding a formal
acknowledgement of union in preference to legal marriage, and
seeking to raise the position of the illegitimate child. The League
published an equally unconventional periodical called <i>The
Adult,</i> a vigorous little paper edited by George Bedborough, who
was also the Secretary of the League I had no connection whatever
with the League or <i>The Adult.</i> But the League was in touch
with De Villiers and it stocked a few copies of my book, without,
however, exposing it or announcing it for sale. At that time a
Society of this kind was regarded as rather alarming and even
anti-social. It thus happened that Anarchists would attend the
League's meetings although its members had no sympathy with
Anarchism. In this way the League attracted the interest of the
police, and so also it came about that the Bedborough prosecution
was engineered by the Anarchist section of Scotland Yard under
Chief Inspector Melville, whose death, it so chances, was reported
only a day or two ago as I write. Continuing to be worried over
this movement, the police at length excogitated the brilliant idea
that they could crush the Legitimation League and <i>The Adult</i>
by identifying them with my <i>Sexual Inversion,</i> obviously,
from their point of view, an "obscene" book. Sweeney, who had much
experience of Anarchists, regularly attended the League's meetings
in his capacity as detective, was treated as a friend of the
movement, and won the confidence of the honest and unsuspicious
Bedborough. When the police had completed their case, Sweeney came
one day to the Society's office and purchased of Bedborough a copy
of my book. Two or three days later, on the 31st of May, 1898, he
arrested Bedborough. That same day, at Carbis Bay, I received a
telegram informing me of the arrest from a lady personally unknown
to me&mdash;Lillian Harman, daughter of the American Moses Harman,
a great pioneer of sex movements in his day&mdash;who then happened
to be on a visit to London and in Bedborough's company at the time,
and soon after I heard to the same effect from De Villiers, who
added that he had been privately informed that I also was to be
arrested. From that moment he himself timidly disappeared
(ostensibly to Cologne, though it is quite possible that he
remained all the time in his own house at Cambridge for he was an
adept in secret passages and concealed cupboards), after
authorising me to obtain legal representation and undertaking to
defray the expenses, an obligation he duly fulfilled.</p>

<p>I went up to London on the 6th of June to make arrangements for
the defence in so far as De Villiers and myself were concerned,
which was not directly, and the Legitimation League saw to the
defence of Bedborough. Never having been in such a position before,
I was at a loss to know what lawyers I should entrust with the
defence, though my rooms were at the centre of Law, so I called
upon W. M. Mackenzie, a young barrister in the Temple and the only
lawyer with whom at that time I was in touch (introduced by Olive
Schreiner) and whom, indeed, I had formerly in his early days of
struggle endeavoured to help by giving him to edit for the Mermaid
Series the plays of Rowley, though that scheme, with many others,
was brought to nought when the Mermaid Series was wrested out of my
hands. Much later he became Lord Amulree. He advised me to go to
Messrs. Humphreys at Holborn Viaduct, which I accordingly did and
found Mr. Humphreys a kind, capable, and reliable adviser through
all the difficult circumstances of the case.</p>

<p>I was alone at Carbis when the news of Bedborough's arrest
reached me. Some days earlier Edith had gone to London to stay for
a week or so with Miss Ellen Dakin at Wetherby Gardens. Miss Dakin
was an old and dear friend; they had first met when Edith was
lecturing at William Morris's at Kelmscott House on "What Women can
do," probably somewhere about 1888, and she was much impressed by
Edith's personality and the skilful way she answered the numerous
questions addressed to her. It was the beginning of a friendship
which lasted without a cloud until Edith's death. Miss Dakin, whose
father had been a Lord Mayor of London, moved in a conventional
social world which might seem altogether alien to Edith's habits
and tastes, yet she always enjoyed it, always remained her
unconventional self in it, and her tender affection and admiration
for Miss Dakin's beautiful and unspoilt character in a conventional
environment was profound. On the 24th of May she wrote:</p>

<p class="quote">"My Love, <i>what</i> a time I'm having! Nelly is
superhumanly kind. Yesterday was a heavenly blue day, warmth and
sun enough to waken the dead. In the morning I went with Nelly and
bought me a Paris silk blouse. Then I went on to Dr. Birch's and
met Emmeline Pethick [afterwards Mrs. Lawrence] there for a moment,
was with Birch two hours; heart much more irritable and weaker; but
he says it is the result of influenza poison, and guarantees I will
be all right if I have no strain and no worries!! Examined me well
and says I am as good as a doctor, and put some funny thing in my
mouth which in an hour took all the pain out of my back and made me
feel so different&mdash;he thought it would but was not sure. Well,
then I went alone to the Circus Restaurant and had stewed beef, new
potatoes, asparagus, a glass of claret and coffee. Then I drove on
to Emmeline's and spent one and a half hours with her. She looks
very sweet and nice and gazed with great toleration at my clothes!
Then on to Woodhouse [her dentist], Sir W. Richmond, who had just
come up from sketching Gladstone, was there in his Court dress and
stars; he had such lovely legs; I told Woodhouse I'd love to have
legs like that. Well&mdash;tell Henry [the farm man] that I had a
big double tooth out and a bad tooth filled and was one and a half
hours in the dentist's chair and never uttered so much as a groan.
He said if I did not have the tooth out at once it might mean
serious inflammation. I looked at him with very grave blue eyes:
'Now&mdash;without gas?' I said, and the thrush flapped its wings.
'Yes,' he said very firmly and got the devilish thing in his hand.
I threw down my glove and after feeling as if my head had knocked
at the golden gate I heard: 'Good brave girl!' and he had my hand
in his. He is more a darling than ever and told me a lot about
himself. He wants to see your photo, so I'm going this morning to
show it to him and to let him take the pack out of my toothless
gum, as he put it in so that I could go to the Richter Concert. We
went and I sat next to an old, old foreigner who had played for
years in the orchestra and comes always. He begged me to stay in
London for a month and go to all the Concerts, for 'I see you are a
musician&mdash;you can sit for hours at home&mdash;just start the
melodies on the piano and then&mdash;you are in Heaven, for dey all
come floating in de brain.' I laughed so merrily he laughed too,
though at what he never guessed.<br>
<br>
I told him skylarks were my musicians, and ducks and hens,
etc.!&mdash;but it is curious how I find out instinctively what is
good in music&mdash;what comes from a man's soul or only from his
violin. Oh! I <i>was</i> happy and a month of it would do me worlds
of good. This morning we shop, and this afternoon De Villiers
[about <i>Seaweed</i> which he was publishing] and Honor [Brooke]
come, and to-night we go to <i>The Liars.</i> I feel like a child,
am cared for and spoilt right and left, and it does suit me down to
the ground. Next year I shall be in London all June and feast on
civilisation. I'm sorry to say I've no wish to come home, but I
feel lovingly sweet to you and I wish we could hear all these
things together. We <i>must</i> go to Bayreuth!&mdash;I'm
Wagner-hungry [in later years she quite lost her taste for Wagner]
and Oh! I've not had half enough music yet. We go to Knightsbridge
to-morrow morning, to <i>The Little Minister</i> in the afternoon,
and then I pack in the evening. Tell Henry on a wet day to paint
the inside of my study windows and tell Janet' before I come home
to scrub my couch. The bliss of having trained servants about is
lovely, and Crisp [the butler] is back again, having married the
cook. [She would always insist on treating the butler as a human
being, even in the dining-room!] I'm lying in bed, waiting for my
silver tray, silver egg-cup, etc., and I'm supremely restful and
content,&mdash;and at last out of pain in my back and heart. I
suppose I shall be homesick some day, but now I think with horror
of that house and its cares&mdash;only you and Jock stand in it as
things I ever want to see again. I'm thinking sweetly, too, of the
Sundts [dear friends up to the end]. Ever your Wifie."</p>

<p>Next day she wrote:</p>

<p class="quote">"My Love, I shopped all the morning yesterday and
brought me real pretty things; then we had a late lunch at home and
went to Dale's, and the fitter was killing; he said he <i>could</i>
not believe the measurer and was thankful to see me. I gave one of
my roars and asked him if I was the only woman with a proper
breathing apparatus he had ever fitted. 'Well, madam, ladies
nowadays lengthen their backs and take in their waists so much.' I
told him when I saw men doing that I would perhaps begin. Then we
came home and rested in Nelly's boudoir, but neither Honor nor De
Villiers came. Then dinner and <i>The Liars</i> which I enjoyed
immensely. I had Alice's [a servant at Carbis] dirty-looking note,
saying the white cock was dead, which Crisp brought on a silver
salver&mdash;all I wished was that they were all dead. I'm getting
anxious&mdash;I could stay here a month without a qualm and I'm
generally very homesick. This morning I am tired, but I'm in bed
always till ten, and then we are going to have a long, long time
with the pictures and a late lunch, and then Miss Dakin [Miss Ellen
Dakin's sister] is going to drive me two hours in the Park with her
two bays, her tiger, and her jolly carriage, as we can't get seats
for <i>The Little Minister</i>. Claire writes to say that when I
get there I shall never go! But, sweetheart, one day you will see
me back, and now you realise what a bad time I have when you are
away. Tell them to send on Friday 1 lb. butter and 4 doz. eggs to
B., and to ask Mrs. F. if she wants any butter. I found I had more
cash in the Bank than I thought and it is a great relief; can send
you w some if you like. I dread that long journey to-morrow. This
<i>is</i> a lovely house to stay in, and Nelly is <i>so</i> good
and seems so happy to have me. Emmeline sees me off to-morrow. You
sweet old love, you don't know how I appreciate the way you are
giving me my holiday in peace by looking after things. I expect it
will do me a world of good. I went again to Woodhouse and he says I
am sound for a year he thinks. <i>Wasn't</i> I brave? I nearly
wired to tell you. You won't get such long letters after to-day for
two reasons&mdash;I shall never be alone and there won't be much to
tell, and, as you know, what there will be will be difficult to
write. I've felt most spiritual in London somehow&mdash;like my old
soaring self without the ethics, a person of aspirations and
ideals. I wonder if it is the good dinners or what? Candidly I
believe Alice drives me mad; these quiet well-trained servants rest
my soul and body like hymns, and they've never told me yet they are
'sweating like mud!' I look and am an utterly difrterent person,
and I'm beginning to think I'm more at home in London than in
Cornwall. But it will pass, I suppose, and I shall long for the
wind and the dairy and the dogs, but now&mdash;no!! The weather is
very warm, and to-day rather dark, but the lovely peace of the
streets, the absence of cobble-stones, the delicious thud of
omnibuses, the picturesque grouping of hundreds of keen faces, the
delicious dresses and flowers, soothe me so, and make me think of
all those clodhoppers with fatigue. Of course&mdash;as the wife of
a scientist&mdash;I realise that it is a mere swing of the
pendulum, but never again will I stay so long in that climate; I
could never do the work I mean to do without the touch now and
again of a complex world with its art, its music, its dancing, and
its more graceful way of sinning. Goodbye, sweetheart,&mdash;I hear
the clock striking nine, so my breakfast will soon be here. Your
own Wifie. Such a sad letter from Miss G.&mdash;&mdash;, evidently
another in a trap.&mdash;Eh, but, mon, we're pretty well
off&mdash;Eh?"</p>

<p>I reproduce these self-revealing letters almost in full, for
they are characteristic of her in those too rare moments when she
was&mdash;even though ill&mdash;free from the irritation of strains
and worries, and they show how her wonderful buoyancy of spirit
could, under favourable conditions, even surmount illhealth. I
could not indeed easily match them from later letters for unalloyed
light-hearted cheerfulness. As the years went on, anxieties and the
physical distress of chronic ill-health tended to form a background
even to her brightest moments. She might well put two exclamation
marks after the physician's advice to avoid worries. Even as she
wrote the new blow was impending.</p>

<p>It fell, as I have said, on the 31st of May, a day or two after
Edith had reached Claire's home in the north. I wrote at once to
tell her. It is probable she replied with a telegram, but in any
case she replied by letter on the 2nd of June:</p>

<p class="quote">"My love, I'm just starting off on my way to
you,&mdash;you poor old Love. Never mind, I'll stick to you and
help you, and I'm at last <i>glad</i> to come home to you and cheer
you and love you and comfort you. We'll live in England and spit at
them, and two together can pull a boat that would else sink. If I
get a wire to-night I shall be off to-morrow to you as fast as
civilisation can bring me. Claire sends love and hopes all will be
well. Your own Wifie. Here is cheque for £2."</p>

<p>None was ever more staunch in emergencies, so prompt, so
resourceful, so consoling. She whose physical temperament made her
apt to fall into nervous terrors over mere nothings, whose health
was always uncertain, who had just been told that the condition of
her heart was worse and that she must avoid all worry, simply and
as a matter of course flung all such considerations aside when a
real trouble faced one whom she loved, and revealed, as Froissart
said of the Countess of Montfort, the heart of a lion. Through all
those trying and vexatious days&mdash;and by repeated delays they
were spun out for nearly six months&mdash;she was as often as
possible by my side, always bright and cheery, always helpful; it
was, more especially, by her exertion among friends that perhaps
the largest part of the Bedborough Defence Fund was raised. She
made little of the misfortune which thus overtook her own book, by
ill luck only just published (the special copy she had bound in
leather for me is dated May) and at first carried off by the police
in their indiscriminate raid, so that until reissued some years
later in a completely new edition, under the title of <i>Kit's
Woman,</i> it had no real circulation.</p>

<p>I quote a few passages from her letters to me during this
June:</p>

<p class="quote">"The indescribable tenderness I have towards you
because of this attack is like being 'under conviction.' You sweet
old love, I'll feed 'ee love 'ee and tend 'ee. I never knew I loved
you so <i>terribly</i>&mdash;it has taken ever so much out of me,
but in a way I'm glad it has been, for I know a lot now and we
shall soon be together again...Never doubt I love you, for I feel
sure it would <i>kill</i> me if anything awful happened to you. I
wish for many things I could be there. I'm so afraid folk may
imagine your wife is either antagonistic or thinks you an invert,
and it is good for the cause that people who are one should face
these things together. Years ago I told you I'd rather you'd do
this than love me, and to-day, if all England were against you, and
you in prison, I'd repeat it. I'm very restless and can settle to
nothing, longing to be with you in London. If the case still goes
on I think I shall run up next week for a few days...I am much
comforted with your sweet note; it made my heart bump on another
side for love of 'ee. De Villiers is a coward; if <i>you</i> had
gone to Cologne there would have been no need for you ever to come
to Carbis again. I think there is something funny about him...An
unutterable tenderness is over me: I feel as if I'd like to take
you and carry you far away from all this respectability to a fair
land where it is warm and full of flowers. I'm terribly depressed
to-day, one of those warm, close Cornish days, I wish you were
here&mdash;wish you could get down and come to my arms. I've a wild
wish to suckle you almost, and when I got your letter it made me
set my teeth for fear they hurt you, but never mind, if they make
England impossible for us we'll sell all and go abroad on what I
have and Live our lives as friends and lovers and dreamers. I'm not
a bit the money-loving beastie I appear&mdash;love is all to me and
I love you more than ever, for I've never found you fail in
essentials. You can no more get free of me than you can of your own
guts, as Janet [in <i>Kit's Woman</i>] says. Send me a wire if
anything new turns up, and of course I'll do anything any time.
Good night, my sweetheart. Oh! dear! <i>what</i> a thing it is to
love your man a thousand times more six years after marriage than
before!"</p>

<p>The whole course of the case&mdash;in which I had no legal
standing, although my book was the ostensible subject of it, and no
power over the decisive steps of the defence&mdash;was profoundly
unsatisfactory. There was little but confusion, muddle,
disappointment, even rascality, from first to last, and in the end
the issue was never, after all, fought, because Bedborough decided,
and under all the circumstances I have never blamed him, to plead
guilty. In the forefront of the indictment, <i>Regina v.
Bedborough,</i> was placed as the "first count" the charge that
Bedborough, who really had no connection at all with the production
of the book, had "sold and uttered a certain lewd wicked bawdy
scandalous and obscene libel in the form of a book entitled
<i>Studies in the Psychology of Sex: Sexual Inversion."</i> But the
other counts dealt with the publications of the Legitimation
League, which had no claim to be scientific, and with which I had
no connection, just as the Legitimation League had no connection
with my book. The issue was thus, perhaps deliberately, confused,
for it was possible to uphold my book and to disapprove of the
League's publications, or to uphold the League and disapprove of my
book. On this and no doubt other accounts not a single prominent
scientific or medical person came publicly forward for the defence,
and though I received, with permission to use them, the most
handsome testimonials from the leading authorities in the
medico-psychological sphere, foreigners as well as British, the
writers were not prepared to go into the witness box on behalf of
the book. I was not even prepared to go myself, for I could not
possibly give proofs of the reality of the confidential cases
reported in my book, which my solicitors thought it very desirable
to do, and I knew also that those same defects which have always
prevented me from attempting any kind of public speech would make
me a bad witness, while I could not claim any recognised position
in the medical world which would give authority to my evidence. It
thus came about that the defence was from the first made mainly a
question of "freedom of the press," and a "Free Press Defence
Committee" was set up, consisting, for the most part, of the most
variegated assortment of secularists, anarchists, radicals, and
unconventional literary free-lances. The secretary, Henry Seymour,
was an anarchist. I had never heard of him before, though he was
prominent in the small anarchist party of London; but he wrote to
me immediately on Bedborough's arrest, and thenceforth this
admirable little man took the leading part in the defence, as
staunch as Edith, and even more unwearied and selfless, for he had
no personal concern in the matter and yet was willing to sacrifice
his own time and labour and business interests in this impersonal
cause. When the trial was over he was the one person in the new
crowd the case had brought me in contact with that I was able to
look back on with pleasure and I continued to meet him at intervals
for some years afterwards.*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* He became prominent in the gramophone
industry, wrote a technical book on the manufacture, and invented a
widely approved sound-box. His activity for Anarchism diminished,
but in late life he developed an enthusiasm for the Baconian theory
of Shakespeare, edited <i>Baconiana,</i> and threw into the cause
his characteristic energy. He died in 1938.]</p>

<p>The variegated Committee certainly included many sound and more
than a few brilliant people. Such were Grant Allen, Belfort Bax,
Robert Buchanan, Herbert Burrows, Mrs. Mona Caird, Edward
Carpenter, Walter Crane, Mrs. Despard, A. E. Fletcher, G. W. Foote,
Frank Harris (who brought the <i>Saturday Review,</i> which he then
edited, to the side of the cause), G. J. Holyoake, H. M. Hyndman,
George Moore, Frank Podmore, H. Quelch, J. M. Robertson (who wrote
vigorously about the case), Henry S. Salt, William Sharp, Bernard
Shaw (who was helpful in journalistic quarters), H. M. Thompson
(editor of <i>Reynolds'</i>, which devoted much sympathetic
attention to the case), John Trevor, etc.* But there was not a
single doctor of position among them and the official men of
science deliberately stood aloof.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* W. T. Stead, though not on the Committee,
was sympathetic and spoke up plainly in his <i>Review of
Reviews;</i> later he became a friendly and admiring reader of the
<i>Studies.</i>]</p>

<p>The perils of the defence arose not only from defective and
rather compromising support from without but still more fatally
from failure within. The solicitor for Bedborough's defence was
chosen by a prominent member of the League from among his own
acquaintances. How anyone could have chosen a solicitor who bore
his character so clearly marked on his limp, shady, and shabby
figure, it is not easy to understand. He was unsatisfactory from
the first, inattentive to the case, not to be found when wanted and
scarcely helpful when found. But we rested our hopes on the counsel
who had been selected with care and judgment to champion the cause
of freedom and science. This was Mr. Avory, later a judge but then
a rising barrister who had not yet been given any great occasion
for distinguishing himself.* He espoused the cause with an even
personal ardour and believed that it furnished the great occasion
for which&mdash;he had long been looking. I am convinced he would
have made a splendid defence. But it was not to be.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* He amply distinguished himself in later
years and died as recently as 1935 unquestionably, it was said by
<i>The Times,</i> the ablest as well as the oldest criminal Judge
on the Bench.]</p>

<p>The case lingered on for nearly six months before coming to
trial. Then, as later appeared, Bedborough went to Scotland Yard to
see the Police Commissioner in charge of the case (possibly by
invitation from the Commissioner, who thought it might be better to
compromise matters), and it was arranged that he should plead
guilty to the chief counts of the charge and the case be dismissed
or the sentence "deferred." How this arrangement affected the
solicitor's conduct has never been clear to me. It all seems a
muddle. But at all events, although the solicitor had £200 in hand
wherewith to fee counsel, he never paid over the fee, and the
etiquette of the Bar made it impossible for Avory to appear. So
that when the case was called Bedborough was not represented and my
book not defended. After the trial was over the solicitor's conduct
in the matter and his appropriation of the fee was investigated by
the Law Society (in which my solicitor happened to occupy an
important ofcial position) and his name was struck off the rolls.
But that was but a sorry consolation for us. For in ruining himself
he had also ruined our defence.</p>

<p>During the first agitated weeks I had had to go up and down
frequently between London and Carbis, with or without Edith. The
autumn months we spent together in Carbis waiting for the postponed
trial to come off, and when the date was finally fixed we went up
together toward the end of October. It took place at the Old Bailey
on the 31st of that month. De Villiers, of course, remained in
mysterious concealment. Humphreys, my solicitor, considered that
the judge might possibly call for me. So, accompanied by Edith, I
remained in a room off the Court&mdash;undisturbed, for my name and
the book were not even definitely mentioned in the
proceedings&mdash;and then at length Humphreys came to tell me the
result. It fairly corresponded to what we had been led to expect.
The defendant, having pleaded guilty, was released on his own
recognisances. The Recorder of London, Sir Charles Hall (formerly
attorney-general to the Prince of Wales, afterwards Edward VII,
and, I am told, personally a capable and amiable man) was sitting
as Judge. He addressed to the defendant the following remarks
(taken down by a shorthand writer employed by the defence): "You
might, at the outset, perhaps have been gulled into the belief that
somebody might say that this was a scientific book. But it is
impossible for anybody with a head on his shoulders to open the
book without seeing that it is a pretence and a sham, and that it
is merely entered into for the purpose of selling this filthy
publication." That elegant sentence caused me more amusement than
resentment even at the time&mdash;for I knew too well what the
official judgments of the world are worth&mdash;and I still take a
mischievous pleasure in reproducing it. I cannot recall how we
received the news of the outcome of the trial, but I think our
chief feeling was one of relief that the strain was at last
over.*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* How promptly we were organising our next
step is shown by a note written by Edith two days later on the
train when returning to Carbis: "My love, I've just bought the
<i>Sketch</i> and you are in it with such a decent defence of
you&mdash;I only hope that old puzzle-headed Recorder will see it
and sneeze. Mind he has a pamphlet too. Get the tickets and we'll
leave this pure country for the sunshine, and do come home on
Saturday. I shall sleep at Maudie's till you do&mdash;never slept
after two this morning, heart very bad again. Get a pound and a
quarter of Cooper's tea to bring home as we shall need some abroad.
Take care, my Beloved old Pal.&mdash;I <i>hate</i> your libellers
like parsnips." That was her favourite symbol for repulsive
things.]</p>

<p>I remember that I went from the Court to the office of the
<i>Daily Chronicle</i> to see Massingham, the editor, who had been
preparing to take up the question of the scientific value of the
book when the trial was over, but he had evidently been deeply
impressed by the Judge's dictum; he merely sent his secretary out
to me to make a few non-committal remarks, and next morning the
<i>Chronicle</i> published a leader which was a beautiful
counterpart to the Judge's observations. Ostentatiously following
the Court's example by refraining from mentioning the names of
author or book, the writer is good enough to give me credit for
"scientific intentions," but "the courts of the law and the
criticisms of the Press are the responsible organs of public
opinion in such matters," and "we cannot take the view that the
book has any scientific value whatever;" on the contrary "in the
discharge of our duty to the public we feel bound to say that the
book in question ought never to have been written or printed;" for
it is "a highly morbid production," and "worthless as science even
if the science it professes to advance were worth studying." In
later years Massingham became more appreciative of my work, and
sought me out as a contributor to the <i>Nation.</i> Yet it is
worth while to quote this characteristic example of the high
journalistic temper to match the high judicial temper. Law and the
Press were indeed well matched, and between them they thought that
they had dismissed me and my book from the world. Yet
I&mdash;rather the spirit of Man I chanced to embody&mdash;have
overcome the world. My "filthy" and "worthless" and "morbid" book
has been translated into all the great living languages to reach
people who could not say what a Recorder is, nor read the <i>Daily
Chronicle</i> even if they ever saw it. Unto this day it continues
to bring me from many lands the reverent and grateful words of
strangers whose praise keeps me humble in face of the supreme
mystery of life.</p>

<p>For look how the world is made. See what happens to those who,
as the men of old days put it, fight against God. They blindly
achieve the exact opposite of that which they vainly imagine they
have accomplished. Here was I, a shy solitary insignificant student
who chanced, a little before his fellows, to feel and to see and
patiently to work out a problem which would soon visibly concern
all men. But meanwhile what he had done was a crime, for which no
descriptive terms were too opprobrious, no language of abuse too
strong. The mighty engines of Social Order and Respectability were
set in motion to crush this infamous thing. What they really
accomplished was to enable that infamous thing to crush them. I had
modestly chosen to issue my book in the quietest way I could find,
almost privately. Order and Respectability killed, not the book,
but the method of publication (incidentally also the publisher),
and I immediately turned to the United States and placed my
<i>Studies</i> in the hands of an active medical publishing house
with a high reputation and an army of travellers. By the method
which Order and Respectability closed to me my books would perhaps
have sold by the dozen; by the method Order and Respectability
compelled me to adopt they have sold, and continue to-day to sell
steadily, on a far larger scale, in an ever increasing circle round
the world. The creatures who were the puppets of this show began to
fall to pieces when it was scarcely over. The Judge died first,
suddenly, still in the prime of life, so swiftly after the trial
that one might well believe the home truths he could not fail to
hear concerning his part in it had struck him to the heart; many of
the others soon followed, and Dr. Roland de Villiers, that
fantastic figure from an alien underworld strangely associated with
books whose mission concerned him so little, was destined to end
tragically within a few years.</p>

<p>I may, indeed, here go forward a little to round off the story
of the whole episode. Directly after the trial I completed (and De
Villiers' press privately printed) <i>A Note on the Bedborough
Trial,</i> in which, without directly defending my book or
answering any criticism, I calmly set forth my position and stated
my resolve to continue my own work in my own way but no more to
publish it in England. Then I at once proceeded to complete Vol. II
(now Vol. I). Although De Villiers had been invisible from the time
of Bedborough's arrest until the trial was well over, I was still
unaware of the grounds for his extreme caution and altogether
ignorant of his past; he had backed me up throughout the case and
supplied promptly all the financial aid needed for the joint
representation of himself and me, leaving me a free hand to control
the defence. I felt rather bound to him on this account alone, and
on the ground that he had suffered through my book. I had nothing
to bring against him except his unpleasant passion for
mystification and his seemingly excessive timidity over the case.
So that I agreed without hesitation to place the publication of the
next volume in his hands. I stipulated firmly, in accordance with
my declared resolution, that it should not be published in England,
and De Villiers readily proposed to issue it only from Leipzig. I
knew that he was connected with Germany and I believed that he
would be in a position to carry out his proposal in this matter. A
year later the book duly appeared as published, according to the
title page, at Leipzig by "The University Press" and at
Philadelphia by the F. A. Davis Company, who copyrighted it in
America. The book was sold as quietly and unobtrusively as I
desired. But before long I discovered that it was stocked in
England and I found reason to suspect that the supposed publication
at Leipzig was merely one of those mystifications in which, as I
well knew, De Villiers was so great an adept. The situation worried
me; I felt that, in view of my declaration after the issue of the
Bedborough trial, I was being put into a false and unpleasant
position. I was in doubt what course to take, the more in doubt
because De Villiers continued to treat me with all consideration,
and I had no definite complaint to make concerning his methods of
handling the book.</p>

<p>The problem was solved without any action on my part or indeed
any knowledge beforehand. The police, who had at length established
the identity of De Villiers and worked out his history, were again
on his track. One day in January, 1902, a strong force of
detectives, having first guarded all the exits, entered the large
and luxurious house in the best quarter of Cambridge where, it
appeared, my publisher and his wife were then hying under the names
of Dr. Sinclair Roland and Mrs. Ella Roland. There was an elaborate
system here of concealed cupboards and passages to hide in or
escape by. But all precautions had been taken, a systematic search
was made, and a secret panel at last discovered revealing a passage
into which one of the detectives entered and flung himself on the
haggard fugitive found there with a loaded revolver which was
speedily struck out of his hands. De Villiers was handcuffed. A few
minutes later he appeared strangely agitated and called for a glass
of water which was brought by a servant. He took a few drops,
gasped, and fell dead. The coroner's jury decided that the cause of
death was apoplexy. It seems possible. But Sweeney states that he
was at the time wearing a ring which a few years before he had
boasted to contain behind the seal a poison to kill a man and leave
no trace behind.*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* I am quoting from the reminiscences of John
Sweeney, the detective who at an early stage was set to watch the
activities of the Legitimation League, <i>At Scotland Yard,</i>
1904. It is no doubt a fairly reliable account of the whole affair
from the police standpoint, and Sweeney regards De Villiers as the
most amazing criminal of modern times. He admits that he wrote
largely from memory, though a few of his statements and opinions
concerning the Bed-borough case are to my knowledge incorrect.]</p>

<p>That was the tragic end of the first publisher of my
<i>Studies</i> and of the first edition itself. Several thousand
copies were stated to have been found in the house at Cambridge and
were ordered to be destroyed. There was nothing left for me to do
but to declare, as I promptly did, that I had no objection to offer
to this course since the agreement entered into with me had been
violated by the method of issue.</p>

<p>Thereupon I at once entered into an agreement with the F. A.
Davis Company of Philadelphia for a new, revised, and enlarged
edition of the two volumes, issued in the reversed order, in which
they now stand, and followed during the next ten years by four
other volumes and finally, after a long interval, a supplementary
seventh. The F. A. Davis Company remained the sole publishers of
the <i>Studies</i> in English until 1936 when, difficulties with
that Company having arisen, they were transferred to Random House
of New York and re-issued in a cheaper and more compact form, and
the sale no longer restricted, as hitherto, to professional
readers.</p>

<p>A few days after the Bedborough trial Edith and I had returned
to Carbis, where we found that some of our poorer neighbours were
under the impression that I was in prison, though I am not aware
that they therefore thought any the worse of me. Exactly three
weeks later we embarked at Plymouth on a in Orient liner on the way
to Gibraltar for Tangier. After six months of wearing suspense and
constant absorption in some new phase of the prosecution and the
repeatedly postponed trial, and after this compulsory acquaintance
with some of the least pleasant traits of our national
character&mdash;its narrow puritanism, its intellectual timidity,
its hypocritical conventionality&mdash;we both felt the imperative
need to escape from England for a while, and Islamic Africa seemed
a fascinating change. "It is an old story now but it aged us both,"
Edith wrote in a lecture fifteen years later. On her side,
moreover, there was the ill-health and increasing cardiac trouble
already mentioned in her letters. It was largely on her account
that Tangier had suggested itself to me as likely to be a
beneficial winter resort. A little while before, the editor of the
<i>British Medical Journal</i> had been to Tangier in search of
health and written about his visit an interesting series of
articles. It seemed to me both an attractive place to visit and a
health resort likely to benefit Edith. On the first point I proved
entirely right, but less right on the second. Edith, for her part,
eagerly accepted my proposal; adventure always appealed to her and
she never lacked spirit to meet it. The difficulties and
discomforts&mdash;though no serious complaint came from her, full
of keen enjoyment in her novel and instructive
experience&mdash;were greater than I anticipated, and I never again
attempted to lure her from the safe and beaten paths of tourist
travel.</p>

<p>In abandoning England for a while I was by no means abandoning
or even postponing my work. The second (now the first) volume of
the <i>Studies</i> was to appear as soon as possible. I was
completing it, with a more feverish activity than I ever applied to
any other of the volumes, almost up to the day of leaving England.
It so happened that a girl secretary, Miss Bacon, formerly with W.
T. Stead, had in his offlice conceived an admiration for me and my
work as well as far Edith, and had agreed to come down to Carbis,
occupy our cottage, take charge of Jock, and generally overlook
things in our absence. (She died, in a little cottage of her own
close by, only last winter, twenty years later.) She was an expert
shorthandwriter and typist, and I dictated to her from notes the
whole of my Study of Periodicity, and was thus enabled to make
rapid progress. It was the only occasion on which I have ever
adopted this method.</p>

<p>I regard the Bedborough case, which filled for me the greater
part of 1898, as the turning point of my life. It was not the
opening of a new chapter as was my return from Australia at the age
of twenty, or the publication of my first books speedily followed
by marriage about the age of thirty. I was now in the midst of the
long period of active and sustained work which lasted until the
<i>Studies</i> were completed in 1910, and may even be said to have
been maintained until 1915 when, partly although not entirely
through anxiety, and depression over Edith's steadily failing
health, I began to be conscious of a permanent even though not
pronounced failure in my own physical and mental vigour. In 1898 I
had not even reached the most mature period of mental power, for
the prosecuted first edition of <i>Sexual Inversion</i> was
distinctly inferior in many respects to the later volumes of the
<i>Studies,</i> although in a subsequent edition (1914) it was
fully brought up to their level, and I do not suppose that I have
ever thought better or written better than in the <i>Impressions
and Comments</i> which date from 1912 to 1923. Yet, none the less,
the year of the Bedborough case was in my interior life a turning
point, even the chief turning point I have ever encountered. It was
the end of the upward climb of life, and as we never seem to be
standing still it was the beginning of what I felt to be the
descent. Until then, although I always looked older than my age, I
had retained an instinctive feeling of youthfulness. It seemed to
me that I was young and that life was all ahead. I believe that I
always had an inner feeling of deference towards an adult, as
though I had not quite realised that I was myself an adult, and I
know that it was always with a certain surprise that I heard that
anyone prominent in the world was not so old as I was. But now,
somehow, this instinctive feeling was suddenly and for ever killed.
I realised that I was no longer young. This realisation, which was
mainly due to that ageing effect of the prosecution to which Edith
alluded, was confirmed by the appearance, about the same time, of
various signs which we associate with old age. My hair began to
turn grey at the temples, and the process continued, until now,
twenty years later, it will soon cease even to be grey and be all
snowy white. I knew that this sign is of no great significance; my
friend Mackay never became grey, yet he died younger than I am now,
while my father, who was always more robust and healthy than I have
ever been, began to turn grey at thirty; so that I might accept as
true the consoling remark which Céline, the charming waitress at
the Boulant Restaurant in the Latin Quarter I had frequented many
years earlier, made to me when a year or two after this period I
found her still the same and still at her old post while I, as I
remarked, was growing grey: "Les cheveux ne comptent pas." Yet when
one knows that one's hair is turning grey one can no longer retain
the instinctive feeling that one is still a youth. A few months
later, also, at the age of forty, I had to adopt eye-glasses for
reading and really needed them earlier. My eyesight had been most
excellent in early life, as befitted the son and grandson of
sailors, and still remained so for far sight. But with the
appearance of grey hairs I had to use glasses, and the youthful
assistant at the optician's as he handed me the glasses, and I
expressed regret at the necessity for using them, responded lightly
that it was merely the usual accompaniment of old age. Then, also
about the same time, I found it desirable to wear artificial teeth.
I had had very fine teeth, as my father had, though mine began to
decay comparatively early and his remained all sound in old age; a
few years earlier an admiring charwoman had asked Edith if my teeth
were my own; henceforth it would no longer be possible to answer a
question of that kind so satisfactorily, though even to-day only
one incisor has gone, for I have long since endeavoured to make up
for that early dental neglect which most people of my generation
suffered from in early life. All probably within the same twelve
months, these various signs came to me to show that I was no
longer, as I had hitherto supposed, on the upward path of life but
on the downward path.</p>

<p>My work, however, still lay mostly ahead, and this new view of
life made no change in my calm and steady attitude towards that
work, which I still continued to pursue, without rest, but also
without haste. That there was no general recognition of it troubled
me not at all. From the first a few people whose good opinion was
worth having had known and admired my books, and therewith I seem
to have been content. Some years before the period I have now
reached Remy de Gourmont, a penetrating critic who was also severe,
had said to a friend of mine that I was "the most advanced person
in England." But it was not till some ten years later that I first
saw myself in a <i>Times</i> review casually included among
"celebrities." And it was probably about this same time that I
heard that an artist I knew at Carbis, a good painter with little
recognition, had remarked to another that I was among the
"arrived." It interested me, I remember, to hear this, for it was a
point on which I had no assurance of my own. Not that I was worried
over the matter. I suspect that below the surface there may have
been a serene confidence that I stood for something the world could
neither give nor take away, and that there was no need to worry.
But I am not certain even about that. I am only certain that from
first to last I have never had any ambition in the world beyond the
deep instinct to attain self-expression, which instinct was
accompanied by the conviction that thereby only could I fulfil the
desire of my heart to help others. Fame, for one who is by
temperament and taste a recluse, could be nothing but an
embarrassing superfluity.</p>

<p>We spent one night, more than enough, at Gibraltar, in the Royal
Hotel, and next day crossed to Tangier. I recall that as we sat on
deck together in the midst of the Straits, Edith found that one of
her teeth required the dentist's attention, and we realised for the
first time that we had left Europe and civilisation behind. There
was no doubt about that when we entered the harbour. Tangier made
an ineffaceable impression on both of us. It was still Eastern in
character, more Eastern than any other spot in the Western
Mediterranean. Here one could learn to feel and to understand not
only the spirit and the aspect of Islam; one was also plunged back
into the atmosphere of the Old Testament and helped to understand
that of the New, while at the same time, to my surprise, I found
that I was also brought near to the classic antiquity of Greece and
Rome. No purely visual experience anywhere in the world has ever
been so helpfully instructive to me. Edith on her side entered into
the novel experience of this adventure with all the eager enjoyment
of her alert and sympathetic temperament, and began at once, as
usual, to make friends in various directions, the first of these
being Dukali, the picturesque and goodlooking young Moor, assigned
to us at the hotel (Villa de France), who came down to the wharf to
rescue us from difficulties on arrival and was henceforth our
agreeable guide and companion on every little expedition. In a
different sphere we made friends with Dr. Alexander Hill, at that
time Vice-Chancellor of Cambridge University and Master of Downing
College, with whom I had been in touch through correspondence over
a book on the brain which he had at one time agreed to write for my
Contemporary Science Series, and who was at this time spending a
short time in Tangier with his wife. Another figure I recall was
that of the Shereefa of Wazan, with whom we once or twice spent an
afternoon, amused by the lively description of her experiences in
Morocco, as the English wife of the most sacred Islamic figure in
the land, a difficult position in which she had maintained her part
as the sensible practical Englishwoman, very conscious of an
Englishwoman's traditions and rights. Some years later she
published the narrative of these experiences. Once we arranged to
pay an afternoon call on the outskirts of the city. Edith had an
introduction to an American artist and his wife who had settled a
mile or two out, and they had invited us to come and see them.
Edith rode on a donkey, I walked, and we were accompanied by Dukali
and another Moorish attendant who professed complete knowledge of
the house we wished to visit. At last we entered a beautiful estate
and were finally asked into a drawing-room quietly furnished in the
best oldworld English manner. A lady entered, with whom Edith
entered into conversation. As this conversation developed, I, who
as usual took but a small part in it, began to realise that Edith
and the courteous hostess were playing at cross purposes. Edith
herself had no perception of this; while she had an incomparably
keener vision than I for the external surface of life, and would
often banter me on my lack of observation, I was more sensitive to
influences that are below the surface and less perceptible to
people of strong and dominating personality. At last I intervened,
and then it was revealed that we were visiting Miss Drummond Hay,
daughter of a famous diplomatist who had once been much associated
with Morocco. She graciously assured us that we had really done
quite the right thing in calling on her, as we apologetically
withdrew and at length found the American artist in his studio.</p>

<p>While the spectacle of Tangier was full of delight and
instruction for both of us, it was less beneficial for Edith's
health than I had expected. She seemed indeed improved, and could
not fail to be since she was always so greatly influenced by mental
impressions, but the climate and the conditions were evidently not
specially favourable for heart troubles, nor was an expensive and
pretentious hotel, not too well provided with luxuries or even the
comforts which in Europe would be a matter of course, altogether
conducive to well-being. After spending three weeks at the Villa de
France, we moved down to a Spanish hotel of more modest and homely
character, on the beach; it was the hotel at which R. B.
Cunninghame-Graham, one of the most original and fantastic
personalities of my time, was wont to stay at from time to time; he
was not there at that time, and I was sorry for he was a man I
should like to meet; I have since heard from a common friend that
he would like to meet me; but the meeting has never come
about.*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* It is now too late. It chances that as I
revise these pages (in March 1936) he died a few days ago in Buenos
Aires at the age of 84.]</p>

<p>We only stayed a week at the Spanish hotel. Here we were fully
exposed to the three-day spells of the <i>levante</i> wind which
had on us, on me especially, an abjectly depressing influence;
perhaps, too, we began to rebel against the exotic atmosphere,
however fascinating to watch, of this un-European world. We found
at our new hotel a homely Californian of Lancashire origin with his
wife, Davis by name, an orange-grower bound on a mission in
connection with the European orange-growing industry. They were
about to visit Malaga on this business. We resolved to accompany
them, and finally left Tangier at the end of December.</p>

<p>It was an exquisitely bright, warm, and calm Mediterranean day
which we spent reclining on deck on the passage of the Hall Line
boat from Gibraltar to Malaga, where we arrived just too late to
enter the harbour that evening. Next morning we explored the city
for an hotel. But while Malaga ostentatiously proclaims its really
magnificent claims on the health-seeker, there was not, then at all
events, a single hotel in the city which could even on the surface
be acceptable as a livable residence for any but hurried business
men. In this dilemma an excellent and serviceable little
English-speaking Spaniard in the Hall Line's office, who later was
often helpful to us, came to the rescue and told us of the Hotel
Hernan Cortez in the pleasant suburb of Caleta, conveniently
situated on the tram line. Even this hotel was mainly a restaurant,
the favourite evening resort of well-to-do Malagans, and the elect
place for banquets which occasionally disturbed our nights with the
sounds of revelry. But even with this drawback, which was on one
side an advantage, it suited us admirably. (It has since been
completely rebuilt in the modern manner, and some thirty years
later I even saw it advertising itself in the London <i>Times</i>.)
The spectacle of Andalusian life in its most characteristic aspects
was constantly before our eyes. To Edith it was a perpetual source
of delight, and with all her ignorance of Spanish she came into
touch with it, being viewed with evident favour by all the
Spaniards of various degree with whom she thus formed an imperfect
acquaintance. She even persuaded an old woman, one of the servants
at the Hotel, to agree to come as servant in our Cornish cottage,
though eventually I convinced her, as she would have realised in
time for herself, that it would be unwise and unkind to remove the
old woman from the Andalusian home she had never left to so
uncongenial and alien a clime. Our most prized Spanish acquaintance
was a most beautiful, distinguished, and accomplished Sevillean
dancing girl, Dolores. Our good Spanish friend at the shipping
office, Mañuelito, had conducted us one night to an obscure
old-world dancing place so hidden away we should never have
discovered it for ourselves, the Chinitas, and not long afterwards
altogether abolished. I regard it as one of the best of the old
unspoilt haunts of Spanish dancing. Dolores was the chief dancer
there at this time; when Mañuelito introduced us between the dances
and we all drank little glasses of Manzanilla together, we found
her to be a sweet and gracious woman as well as a fine dancer. The
Chinitas became a favourite haunt, and sometimes special dances
were performed for our benefit on the table in a sideroom at the
expense of numerous bottles of Manzanilla. One day we went to see
Dolores and her father, a courteous old bullfighter, at their home,
while her fiancé eyed us jealously from the background, and later
Dolores and her sister (a dressmaker) lunched with us at our hotel.
Arthur Symons, who had come after a winter in Seville to stay with
us for a few weeks, shared in some of these delightful experiences.
For Edith they were a revelation as well as an unforgettable
delight; later in the year she wrote a story inspired by Dolores,
whose photograph, given by the dancer, always remained a cherished
possession.</p>

<p>One evening I found seated next to me at dinner a gaunt dour
Scotsman who was obviously ill. He addressed me, recalling that we
had met at lunch some years before. It was J. F. Nisbet, the
dramatic critic of <i>The Times</i> and author of a then oft-quoted
book on <i>The Insanity of Genius;</i> at this time he was
correcting the proofs of his last and most reflective book, <i>The
Human Machine.</i> In a dying state, as he doubtless knew, he had
yet left his family to come to Malaga alone. A remarkable
personality, an able and busy journalist, a vigorous and
independent thinker, he was also a man who had sought, in his own
sardonic fashion, to live, so burning the candle at both ends. It
was to Symons that he talked most frankly of himself and of his
experiences with women: "I like to drive them three abreast." He
returned to England almost immediately after we left, though it was
still March, and died in London a week or two later.</p>

<p>We found the winter climate of Malaga during January and
February almost perfect. We could usually lunch in the garden under
a lemon tree, and the sun on our south room, from which we could
sometimes see the African coast, was so hot that at times it almost
hindered sleep at night. At the end of February the weather began
to be less settled and delightful, for March is a disturbed month
even in Malaga. The time had come to bid farewell to everyone, for
Edith had by this time made many friends and acquaintances,
including the highly intelligent English consul, who had proposed
that Symons and I should accompany him on an expedition, which
unfortunately was prevented by weather conditions, to open out an
unexplored cavern in the neighbourhood; Dr. Visick, the kind and
shrewd old English doctor, whose advice Edith had once or twice
required; and Mr. Johnson, an Englishman who spent every winter at
the Hernan Cortez and had various playful little encounters with
Edith who used to banter him on the two charming young Spanish
<i>comadres,</i> godmothers as she would call them, who came every
week with castanets to spend an afternoon in his room; he duly
carried out a promise she extracted from him, to liberate secretly
on the morning of his departure a fettered canary kept by the
landlord's children.</p>

<p>We started for Cordova, accompanied by Arthur Symons, and after
a few days there went on to Seville for a week; here we parted from
Symons and, after a day or two in Ronda, settled in Algeciras for a
week to await the P. and O. liner at Gibraltar for our return home.
There were no good hotels in that pleasant little old town in those
days, and ours, the Cuatro Naciones, was dirty and uncomfortable,
with a fleabitten little maid to wait on us; Edith, with her good
housewifery instincts, always looked back on the Four. Nations as a
nightmare. It was, indeed, the only drab spot in her joyous
memories of Spain, which she always desired to revisit though
circumstances never again permitted; whenever I went to Spain
afterwards it was alone.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch8" id="ch8"></a>Chapter 8</h2>

<p>We arrived at Plymouth on the 26th of March, Palm Sunday
morning. There were a few hours to wait for the train to Carbis
Bay. It was a wintry and cheerless day; we wandered disconsolately
through the dreary and lifeless streets of an unbeautiful English
town on a dead Sunday morning. Edith felt poignantly the contrast
to the warm and beautiful and living land with its friendly people
that we had left behind. It was a contrast she always felt on
returning to England from the Continent or America, though it never
seemed quite so keen to her as on that Sunday morning in Plymouth.
She was at heart thoroughly English, and her home was English, and
so were nearly all her chief friends. But in external
manifestations she was not English; the cold, formal, prudish,
conventional, undemocratic Englishwoman was absolutely alien to
her. Every stranger, of any class or of none, was to her a possible
friend. She knew of no class distinctions, whether of superior or
inferior; wherever she might be, it was natural to her to give
help, when it seemed to be needed, or to ask help, with the
spontaneous directness of a child. Naturally, she was sometimes
rebuffed, and would feel the rebuff, though it never made any
difference to her. But this was not apt to happen outside England.
Foreigners responded more sympathetically, and were delighted to
find an Englishwoman to whom it was so easy to respond. She was
democratic, she loved beauty, she was full of vivid interest in
life, and so it happened that, closely as she was bound to England
and great as was the devotion that held her to her English friends,
she still felt at times an alien in England, and never quite
abandoned the dream that it might some day be possible to settle in
some more congenial land.</p>

<p>We soon fell again into the routine of our old life, however,
and I was glad to greet the early Cornish spring with blood already
filled and invigorated by the sunshine of the warmest winter I had
ever spent since leaving Australia. I had completely outlived the
troubles of the prosecution, and with fresh and restored mind I sat
down in my boat summer-house at Hawkes Point to write swiftly and
without premeditation a little book, <i>The Nineteenth Century: A
Dialogue in Utopia.</i> This book, suddenly prompted by the
extravagance of the one-sided eulogies of the nineteenth century
then appearing at its close, I poured out from the exuberance of a
refreshed spirit and published in the same year. I recognise that
it may not be completely achieved, and it was never meant as an
adequate estimate, but it sets forth many of the beliefs which have
ever been parts of my personal creed.</p>

<p>We spent the greater part of the year quietly at Carbis Bay,
going up to London, separately or together, for a few weeks now and
then, and in November Edith, already eager to be abroad again,
crossed over to Brussels to stay for a week or two with staunch and
life-long friends, the Sundts, who had been originally, like some
other faithful friends, tenants of one of the Cornish cottages. At
Brussels, as usually happened when she went abroad, she was able to
write to me that she was "supremely content." After Morocco and
Spain, a Continental visit no longer seemed formidable to her, and
occurred from time to time during the next sixteen years. Eight
years at farming had exhausted the ardour with which she had at
marriage turned from London and ethics and the Fellowship House to
the natural earth and its primitive products. Not yet ready to
abandon them altogether, she was now thirsting for a wider vision
of the world, for beauty and for art. "I find I'm anything but a
real ethical person nowadays," she wrote to me in this year, "and
am rather wondering how I am to get my artistic needs satisfied in
my brief life."</p>

<p>In health she had been benefited by the winter in the south, but
her heart trouble remained, and in May (never a good month for her
in Cornwall) she was suffering much from this cause. In June she
began to consult an old physician, a distinguished heart
specialist, Dr. Sansom, who treated her with much kindness and
consideration, without fee, as the generous manner of doctors is
with the wives of doctors. At the first interview he said she had
evidently had shocks, and before she left, suddenly asking if he
should put her character into one word, he smilingly wrote
"Militant." (It was in days before that term meant a violent
suffragette.) Sansom gave her much wise and helpful advice up to
his death some years later. It was in this year also that, as I
look back, I think I can begin to trace an attraction which became
of almost supreme importance in Edith's spiritual life, affording
satisfaction not only to her deep affectional impulsion towards
women but also to the artistic cravings now becoming prominent.
During the long winter interruption in the south her love for
Claire seems to have fallen back to its old level of friendly
appreciation on which it calmly remained for the rest of her life.
But there was always a place in Edith's heart, a sacred and
beautiful place, only to be filled by a woman who must be more than
a friend in the conventional sense, a woman on whom she could
expand a love which was like passion, even if an etherealised
passion, and lavish those tender refinements and protective cares
of which she so well knew the secrets. It was Lily who occupied
this place in her heart, during the brief period she knew her, more
securely than any other woman before or after, and at her death was
worshipped as Edith never worshipped anyone else, not even her
mother, who had never been a real living person for her. Lily was a
St. Ives artist who lived with an elder sister, by whom she was
jealously tended and guarded, in a little home of refined culture.
She had studied in Paris without, however, being touched by the
Bohemian life of the Latin Quarter, and as the sisters had private
means she was not dependent on her art for a living. The family was
of Scotch-Irish origin from Ulster, and Edith, who made no
distinction between different kinds of Irish, regarded Lily as the
exquisite flower of the typical Irish spirit and for her sake
adored everything Irish all the rest of her life. In any case, Lily
was certainly quite unlike the homely and kindly family she
belonged to. She was a creature of fascinating charm that was felt
alike by men and women, by rich and poor. She possessed, moreover,
that artistic temperament which at this time so appealed to Edith.
Much as Edith always admired the clean, honest, reliable
Englishwoman, there was yet, as I have already indicated, something
in that type that was apt to jar on her in intimate intercourse;
she craved something more gracious, less prudish, pure by natural
instinct rather than by moral principle. In Lily she found the
ideal embodiment of all her cravings. Lily was not indeed an artist
of original achievement: her work in painting (though I doubt if
Edith would have admitted this) never rose above respectable
mediocrity, however much trouble she spent on it, and she achieved
nothing in any other field. Yet there was in her the temperament of
the artist, and the atmosphere of art and beauty was always around
her. She loved poetry, she was an amateur actress on occasion. She
was genuinely musical and played Chopin and Grieg with delicate
skill. The key to her nature lay, I think, largely in her fragile
constitution. There was always something delicate and ethereal
about her; she was a sprite rather than a human spirit;
fastidiousness with her took the place of morality, yet leaving her
fancy free to roam without restraint; she had no strength of
character, always inclined to follow the path of least resistance,
and she was dreadfully afraid of being bored. I think it was that
last trait which counted much in the attraction, certainly real,
she felt for Edith, although a nature such as hers could scarcely
fail to respond to one so rich and strong and impulsive, with a
vigorous earthly vitality such as she herself never possessed. A
year or two after Edith came to know her well Bright's disease was
diagnosed, and a little later she was dead, at about the age of
thirty-six.</p>

<p>Edith and Lily only came to know each other slowly.
Circumstances&mdash;especially the circumstance of the elder sister
who ever watched over Lily like a mother&mdash;seldom permitted
more than occasional and difficult private meetings. Sometimes
these were stolen and took place in a quiet little wood between St.
Ives and Carbis. But they often met more openly in Lily's studio at
Porthminster. On one occasion I gave up my studio at Hawkes Point
for the day, to enable them to picnic quietly there. It was but
rarely indeed that they could spend the night together and that
Lily would hurry to Carbis with her little nightdress at a late
hour when she had almost been given up. Of all those meetings there
was only one which stood for ever after in Edith's memory in a halo
of beauty, an October night which always lingered in her memory. In
what the special beauty of that night lay it was not for her to
tell, or for me to ask, only to divine, but I know that she always
recalled the anniversary of it as one of the sacred days of her
life. She was indefatigable, as she always was, in her devotion and
endlessly inventive in a lover's attentions. At such times she had
all the air and spirit of an eager boy, even the deliberate poses
and gestures of a boy, never of a man, and on one side of her,
deeply woman-hearted as she was, it was more than a pose, with her
restless activity and her mischievousness and her merry ringing
laugh, which suited so well with her wellshaped compact head and
her short curly hair. To Lily this boyish ardour was certainly
delightful, as delightful as was Lily's ethereal fragility to
Edith. For notwithstanding that element of wholesome grossness in
her love of the earth and even sometimes in her humour, Edith felt
an intense repugnance to all grossness in love; even a trace of its
presence, or a suggestion of viciousness, more than once brought to
nought her nascent attraction to a woman.*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* It was significant that never, even at her
fiercest moments, did Edith bring out the vulgar swear words which
so easily cone to women of rather similar temperament. But she
could on occasion cut or crush ruthlessly with her own more
original and pungent speech.]</p>

<p>Lily's purity, with its brightness and its reserve&mdash;a
reserve that seemed to both of them deeper than the more
superficial reserve of the English&mdash;and its flashes of
audacity, together with her charming wit, and the touch of the
instinctive artist in all her actions, suited Edith perfectly.
Throughout her life she had numerous intimate relationships with
women, but no woman, before or after, ever appealed to her so
deeply, or satisfied her so utterly, as Lily. I think she more or
less clearly realised that fragility which was a note of Lily's
character as well as of her physical constitution, and knew that
they could never be mates in soul, for Lily had no soul, but she
knew also that there is a sphere of love in which that counts for
nothing (there was doubtless the thought of Lily in her mind when
many years later she wrote a little play called <i>The Pixy</i>),
and it was precisely because Lily embodied something that was
entirely unlike and outside herself that the fascination she
exerted was so strong. They were never sufficiently long together
for Lily's weakness of character to grow into a barrier between
them.</p>

<p>I can see that after she began to know Lily there was in Edith's
love for me a subtle change which had not been produced by her
affection for Claire. She no longer called me "sweetheart" or said
that I was both woman and man to her. I remained her "boy," her
"child," always her "comrade," and "the one person in the world who
understands me." I am sure she realised that Lily was not only
ethereal but fragile, the last person in the world to rely upon. I
never felt the slightest tinge of jealousy, for Lily so clearly
represented something with which I could not compete. I would as
soon have been jealous of the beauty of a star. Lily was for Edith
a star, a star to which for all the rest of her life the chariot of
her spirit was attached.</p>

<p>It was in June, 1903, that Lily faded swiftly, gently, away,
after a few months' illness. During those months Edith's keen
desire to be at her side was rarely gratified. She was seldom
admitted to see her, scarcely ever alone. It was not even evident
that Lily desired to see her. The rumour reached us that Lily had
made fun of her and had no wish to see her. (There was a light,
irresponsible, unconsciously cruel attitude in her behaviour where
I was concerned, for though she was always nice to me, and I was
always friendly to her, I knew that she had sometimes spoken
slightingly of me and of my love for Edith, in this unlike any
other intimate friend of Edith's, before or after.) I sought to
soothe her pained heart by saying, quite honestly, that in the
languor of illness the supreme desire is for peace and that she was
not strong enough to resist the influences by which she was
constantly surrounded. This view probably proved acceptable, and
these painful experiences seem to have been effaced from Edith's
memory. The figure of Lily, immutably radiant and unstained, became
for ever fixed in her mind. Simply and slowly, she dedicated to her
a kind of worship which increased rather than lessened as the years
went by. Lily's portrait was ever on her desk or by her bedside,
closer even than mine, and carried about in all her journeyings.
Every little present that Lily had ever given her was cherished,
constantly used indeed, but guarded with anxious care, Lily's
cushion, Lily's looking-glass, Lily's cup, Lily's table-cloth, most
of which I now possess, and Lily's brooch, which was always on her
and was cremated with her at last. The books she had given
Lily&mdash;especially one or two of mine and Swinburne's
<i>Tristram of Lyonesse</i> which they had read together&mdash;were
secured and treasured. (It is I who treasure them now.) Edith had
found out&mdash;what Lily at first characteristically neglected to
mention&mdash;that she already had an intimate woman friend
belonging to an earlier period, and though this friend lived far
away in America, Edith succeeded in coming into touch with her,
exercising all her skill and patience to overcome prejudices, and
securing at last her regard and friendship. She was a frequent
pilgrim to Lily's grave at Lelant, with tributes of flowers, long
after the spot became neglected by all others who had loved her;
and during all the remaining years at Carbis when worried or
depressed she would drive off to Lily's grave, to linger alone
there for an hour or so and find rest and consolation. She had
even, in the first abandonment of grief, purchased the neighbouring
plot as a grave for herself, though before finally leaving Carbis,
and when she had decided in favour of cremation, she gave it up.
Moreover the whole conception and working out of a beautiful
anthology of love poems, <i>The Lover's Calendar,</i> was really,
in her own mind, dedicated to Lily. I cannot quite recall when the
idea first occurred to her but I think it was when Lily was still
alive. When the volume was at length published, in 1912, she wrote
in the Preface that she had compiled it during the past twelve
years. But it certainly was not until some time after Lily's death
that it took definite form and that she was able to see that the
lovers' calendar included not only the seasons of love, but that,
as she says, "death also, and the union of spirits after death, may
make a claim on the reader's desire for romance and adventure as
powerful as the passionate love of those who are still on earth;
and these two facts must enter into the calendar if the cycle of
Love is to be complete." it was only thus that the anthology could
become for her, as she called it, the "epitome of a love-history."
Although its compilation was never her sole occupation it was
always during those years much in her thoughts, and it really
involved much labour and correspondence, more trouble indeed than
any of her original books, except only the <i>James Hinton.</i> Yet
it always remained a cheerful task of love. It was the only one of
her books in which I took any active part beyond criticism and
discussion, yet only in small part. Most of the writers she
selected from she discovered for herself, and all the selections
she independently made for herself in accordance with her own
standards. I am sure that every passage was tested by what seemed
to be its suitability to the case of Lily and herself and its
congruence with what seemed to her the spirit of Lily. It is in
this way that the anthology attained a fine, beautiful, and exalted
harmony, though anthologies are so numerous that I am not aware
that its qualities were ever widely appreciated and its sale was
small. She was, however, perfectly content. The book was not made
for fame or profit. It was her monument to Lily, an exquisite
shrine at which she could carry on a kind of worship of Lily. I
might indeed say that, unlike as many of the circumstances were,
Lily came to occupy in Edith's mind and heart much the same place
as, with better reason no doubt, Edith came to occupy in mine.</p>

<p>But Edith went further in cultivating a relationship with Lily
after death. Lily not only lived a glorified and sanctified life in
her mind and heart, but came to be regarded as a still living
personality capable of coming into touch with her, of guiding her
and consoling her. It is probable that Edith had never definitely
and decisively abandoned the traditional belief in the persistence
of individual spiritual life after death. But it had not been a
vital or influential faith. Much as she loved her mother, whom she
had never known, she never at any time regarded her as a
continuously Hying personality with whom she could come in contact,
though latterly she imagined her as a beautiful spirit in
<i>Love-Acre.</i> When a dear friend from school days, Flo, a
lovely and gracious personality I well recall, died in India soon
after our marriage, Edith received a great shock, but the
possibility of still entering into communication never crossed her
head. It was only as regards Lily that this idea arose, and Edith
seemed to have little wish or impulse to extend it to other
persons. She was never the adept of any methodical system of
Spiritism. She was led naturally and slowly by her own inner and
outer experience, so that I can scarcely say how or when the
movement began. I remember&mdash;though this was scarcely the
beginning of it&mdash;how once when she was standing in the main
road at Carbis near the Count House with a friend (I mention this
circumstance as in the absence of any witness one might possibly
suspect hallucination), a lady, a complete stranger spending a few
days at St. Ives, walked up to her, desired to see some ornament
she was wearing, and, rejecting everything else, fixed on Lily's
brooch, and said she had been sent to bring a message of
consolation from the friend associated with that brooch. The
strange lady was never seen again, and her message remained a
mystery, but it left its impress. I think this may have occurred
before Edith came into touch with a medium of high repute whom she
saw at intervals during the remaining fourteen years of her life,
and whom she seems to have first met within twelve months of Lily's
death, I think in Cornwall. Swedenborg professed to come to her
through the medium not once only, though she had never taken any
interest in Swedenborg, and never at any later time made more than
rather perfunctory attempts to investigate his doctrines. This
medium, who refused to practise for money, claimed to have been
consullted by high personages and was considered notably
successful. Edith had much regard for her, and she seems to have
had much regard for Edith, so that a friendly relationship arose.
Long after Edith's death I saw in the papers that she and her
husband had committed suicide together.</p>

<p>It must be said that in these experiences Edith by no means
displayed abject superstition or lost her shrewd powers of
estimating human nature. Not only was she without any taste for
spiritualism in general which, she wrote in the last months of her
life, is "often as unspiritual as prostitution is in regard to
love, and merely materialism on another plane"&mdash;but she was
usually suspicious of mediums, especially those who practised for
money, and inclined to regard mediumship as a dangerous and even
demoralising activity. Some persons assured her that she would
herself make an excellent medium, but though she thought this
possible, she refused absolutely to make the attempt. Her
experiences with her medium were certainly remarkable, even though
one sought to explain them, as I sought, by thought-transference.
Lily would speak to her through the medium in what seemed her own
natural voice in life, talk of familiar things, foretell the
future, give advice which was usually good, and utter words of love
and encouragement and comfort. Thcse spirit interviews were
consoling and helpful to Edith. They never led her astray; she was,
indeed, always prepared to believe that they might be deceptive,
though at the same time willing to fortify her own resolutions by
Lily's approval. Thus she was encouraged in her plan of a lecturing
tour to America, for it was communicated to her that this would be
successful and prosperous, as up to a point it was. Some years
before her death it was foretold to her that she would live to
publish eight books, and this proved exactly true, for though she
handed over the ninth (on James Hinton) to her publishers, she
never lived to see it published (that has come about only this
week, two years later, as I write). Not long before her death she
told me it was said to her that she would either die very soon or
live seven years longer; yet she never hastened to carry out an
intention of modifying her will, and actually died before that was
done. All such prophecies, indeed, she took, not indeed sceptically
but without the slightest attempt to make herself their accomplice.
I think she attached more importance to the vague and general
admonitions she received, such as one she often repeated: "What
seems an impediment is a star." What she found in her
"spiritualism" was not a method of discovering events, but, as she
said in the paper already quoted: "To reach true spirituality one
must be able to forge the lost with the found, and wed the words of
life and death, a new birth not only in civilisation but in humour
and joy." It was a special personal religion which she had created
for herself, with Lily as its supreme deity, and her special medium
as its sole priestess.</p>

<p>In addition to communications of this mediumistic order, Edith
also believed, from a fairly early period, that she had occasional
visitations from Lily's spirit apart from intermediary aid. At rare
moments, without definite sensory manifestations, usually in her
own room at Carbis, she would become conscious for a while of
Lily's presence. (She would sometimes say that at these times her
favourite cat behaved strangely as though some mysterious presence
pervaded the room.) These experiences never became definitely
sensory, but she found them consolatory. I have said that all this
was to her a kind of religion, but a private and esoteric religion.
She would naturally tell me, for there was nothing that concerned
her she hid from me, and she would speak of it to a few special
friends, but always quietly and with restraint, as something too
sacred and intimate for expansiveness. She made no attempt at
propaganda, and was incapable of exploiting her experiences in
self-glorification. To spiritualism of any kind she never referred
in her books. It was only towards the end that this attitude was
modified. Her last novel, <i>Love-Acre,</i> published in 1914, is
faintly tinged by her religious outlook, especially the Epilogue
with its reference to "Emanuel," though few readers would recognise
that this meant Emanuel Swedenborg. During the last few months of
her life, when with increasing disease and failing mental power her
natural restraint and reticence diminished, she wrote indeed a
lecture, which she delivered to small audiences, on "Communication
between Worlds." Here she openly declared her faith, and spoke of
her own personal experience, even obscurely alluding to "the Lily
of Heaven." She proposed to include this in the book she had
planned, <i>The New Horizon</i> (posthumously published), but it is
so slight, so uncharacteristically stuffed with quotations, that,
after some hesitation and with the support of a sympathetic friend,
I decided that it would be inadvisable to publish it.</p>

<p>In all this I took no active part. It may seem, indeed,
altogether alien to my temper and habits of mind. Yet I never
adopted, and was never even tempted to adopt, any attitude of
ridicule or contempt. There was never the slightest trace of that
element of discord which arose between Robert Browning and his wife
when she became attracted to Spiritualism. Edith regarded me as
very scientific and she was pleased that I, most genuinely,
admitted that my mind was always open and that I could not pretend
to offer any scientific explanation of her experiences. Then,
sometimes, she would playfully remark that after she was dead she
would come and pull my hair to see what I would say. (She never has
been manifested to me, gladly as I would encounter that
manifestation, and however I might explain it.) I, on my part,
recognised that her head was not turned by her experiences, that
she devoted no undue thought and attention to them, but (until near
the end) remained her shrewd and sensible self. I am always
tolerant to what is natural and sincere. But in this matter my
attitude was more than that of toleration, it was nearer to
reverence. I realised that in this revelation of Lily as a source
of spiritual succour Edith was making her nearest approach to the
consoling power of mysticism. She was not naturally possessed of
the mystical temper, much less so than I am. To me it had come in
youth through a natural interior development, with no strong
impulse from without. She was rebellious to such development. Her
egoism was too strong, her sensibilities too acute, her temper too
dominant and energetic for the mystical spirit to be natural or
easy to her. It could only come through the crushing shock of love
swiftly passing to loss, and even then she was never entirely
subdued to it. But such as it was, it was her religion, the only
real religion she ever had, the true heaven of her soul, and there
was nothing for me to feel but reverence.</p>

<p>I have run far ahead. I must return to Lily's death, long before
any suggestion of "Spiritualism" had arisen.</p>

<p>This summer of 1902 at Carbis was a sad and depressing time for
Edith. She kept up and worked, but she felt it hard to live and
sometimes doubted if she would live. It was a cold, wet and wintry
summer, bad for her health, which was poor, the heart more than
ever troubling and the darting pains in her knee, which later were
to develop into severe neuritis, now beginning. Her favourite dog,
Jock's son, who had always been delicate, had to be shot after a
distressing illness; the only cow on the farm fell ill and died; we
both of us were at this time suffering from lack of money. She had,
moreover, the strain of a very busy season, letting cottages and
catering for a number of people, though this was beneficial in so
far as it occupied her thoughts and helped to relieve the financial
situation. For literary work she had lost all spirit and
inspiration.</p>

<p>It was evident that a real change and some form of effective
medical treatment were becoming imperative. At this point Dr.
Sansom's advice proved of the greatest help. He told Edith she must
go to Aix-les-Bains, not merely for the sake of the treatment but
because the air and situation would suit her case, and he gave us
an introduction to his old friend, Dr. Blanc, the leading physician
at Aix. This was not a place that would ever have occurred to me. I
have always had the greatest horror of fashionable health resorts,
notwithstanding my pleasant experience of Harrogate, the only place
of the kind I had had an opportunity of really knowing, and I have
never even yet so much as passed through the Riviera.*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* This is no longer true. In 1923, with my
dear friend of later years, Françoise, I spent two summer weeks at
various spots on the French Riviera, which was then only beginning
to become a summer resort.]</p>

<p>As my choice of Tangier on the previous occasion indicated,
something a little unusual and adventurous appeals more to me, even
in the matter of health resorts. But the wise old physician showed
an admirably sane judgment. Edith accepted his decision and I at
once fell in with it and promised to accompany her. It was decided
that we should go rather late in the season, in October, when
prices at Aix would be more moderate and when, also, Edith's own
summer cottage-letting season would be over. I left ten days in
advance, passing through Belgium, in order to spend a few hours
with Amy, and remained in Paris until Edith joined me and we
started for Aix. Of Belgium and Paris on this visit I can recall no
definite memories. My recollections begin when the train stopped at
Dijon and the varied and attractive contents of the luncheon basket
we there secured called out Edith's always vivid interest in
novelties; at this point, also, we fell into conversation with a
young fellow traveller who was a member of an archeological
exploring party in Egypt and, it turned out, a student at Toronto
of a friend of mine, Professor Mayor.</p>

<p>On arriving at Aix we went to an hotel (the Germain) we had
chosen beforehand as being inexpensive, but which proved not to our
taste, for it was situated in a cramped position, low down in the
town, and crowded with visitors, while the small room assigned to
us with its tiny washing basin in the old French manner altogether
repelled Edith. So next day when we called upon Dr. Blanc he kindly
took us to the Hôtel d'Albion, where his influence, my position as
a doctor, and the advance of the season enabled us to secure rooms
fairly within our means. This hotel&mdash;pleasant and comfortable
and in every respect well equipped and managed without being
luxurious&mdash;suited us perfectly. We could not have been better
situated. We had two good rooms, leading into each other and with a
fine view, which had not long before been occupied by the Duke of
Norfolk when on a pilgrimage to Rome, and before that during a
succession of years, by a fashionable and famous French portrait
painter, Carolus-Duran. Edith, always so swift to react to a new
favourable environment so long as she had any vitality left, was
delighted with everything, and her restoration, on the psychic side
at least, was almost immediate. It was, I think, on the third day
after our arrival that she awoke in the early morning and was
inspired to begin writing a humorous Cornish story. It was the
first time she had been able to write since Lily died. This little
story initiated a series which she now continued with a new ease
and skill. She discovered that she was an artist in the short story
as well as in the novel, and she revealed a new development of the
Cornish humour she had already shown in <i>Seaweed;</i> it was now
brighter and more sparkling, the artist's hand lighter, and the
ability to utter profound things playfully more accomplished. Most
of the stories were based on some slight real experiences, though
one, purely imaginary, "The Subjection of Kezia," was a complete
success, as the public recognised when, after she had transformed
it into a playlet, it had a long run on the stage of several London
theatres. Yet even Kezia was a transformation of reality, for I am
sure that in drawing Kezia she was thinking of herself and
objectively studying all that moody contradictoriness which she
well knew that she herself was apt to display in her intimate
domestic life. These stories were sent to Mr. Pethick Lawrence, who
had become the husband of our friend Emmeline Pethick, and was at
this time editor of a London evening paper, the <i>Echo.</i> He
approved of them and they appeared, one every week, in the
<i>Echo,</i> and eventually (1906) in a volume, <i>My Cornish
Neighbours,</i> which was dedicated "To Havelock." It was a book
which met with the warm commendation of good judges and the
appreciative enjoyment of a considerable public.</p>

<p>Our month's stay at Aix, so far as I recall it, was of unalloyed
though peaceful enjoyment. It was so to me&mdash;though in the
first place Edith's health had been my sole guiding
motive&mdash;scarcely less than to Edith. She would take her
prescribed bath, be carried back to bed in a sedan chair according
to the custom of Aix (I have a photograph I took of her on one such
occasion as she looks out laughingly from the curtains), and when
she had rested we would explore the neighbourhood, inhaling the
clear and calm air of this high valley, delightful even in late
autumn, sit beside the beautiful Lake of Bourget, and enjoy the
variegated spectacle of the ever shifting stream of cosmopolitan
visitors. Occasionally we would go for a longer excursion. The most
memorable of these was to Chambéry, whither we went chiefly in
order to walk out to the home of Madame de Warens and young
Rousseau at Les Charmettes. That day, the 24th of October, remains
memorable in my life. I was impelled to visit Les Charmettes by no
enthusiasm. It had indeed happened that Rousseau's <i>Reveries,</i>
found among my grandmother's books, had perhaps been the first book
in French I had ever read for my own pleasure and its gracious
music had impressed me; I had, moreover, read the
<i>Confessions</i> at eighteen and been mightily interested. But
Diderot was my hero, not Rousseau. Les Charmettes merely seemed a
pleasant and easy little excursion. It was indeed an agreeable
rural walk to the seemingly deserted little villa. Few visitors, it
seemed, ever came. We tugged the rusty iron bell-pull and the bell
rang out loudly, but there was no response, and we wandered around
until we found at last the woman in charge, who admitted us and
showed us about the empty and solitary building. It was a
revelation of what can be achieved by a happy blending of chance
and neglect with a fine artistry in veneration. Here was a little
museum of sacred relics. Yet the prevailing impression was that of
a small country house lived in more than a century ago and
untouched since it was left. Of any attempt at renovation or
restoration, which the energetic Anglo-Saxon could not have
resisted, there seemed to be none, and so the ancient charm still
adhered to these ancient decorations, to these bed coverlets now
falling to rags. The very air that Rousseau and his "maman" once
breathed seemed still here. The aspect of decay and death became
the very evocation of life. I have never by any external
environment seemed brought so close to the hearts and bodies of
people who died more than a century before. When we looked out
together from Madame's (as we supposed it to be) bedroom window at
sunset and saw the delicate colours painted on the distant
mountains, and when we walked back with lingering feet to Chambéry
from that spot enchanted by memories of the past, I felt that a new
interest had come into my life, and henceforth Rousseau, no longer
the merely extinct volcano he had once seemed to me, had become a
Hying and fascinating human creature with an inexhaustible
complexity I can never completely unravel. That visit has always
been hallowed with beauty in my memory, and it has taken on a new
beauty since the companion of my heart who shared it with me has
now, like Rousseau, become an enchanted memory.</p>

<p>We left Aix early in November with regret, for it had been a
time of new inspiration and vigour as well as of keen enjoyment for
Edith, and for me of unalloyed happiness. It is usual after the
course of baths to go to some other health resort for a brief rest
before returning to the ordinary routine of life. Dr. Blanc
recommended Montreux on the Lake of Geneva. On the way there we
spent a night at Annecy, associated with more memories of Rousseau
and Madame de Warens, and at Montreux, with Clarens close by, we
were again in their atmosphere. But Montreux itself left little
impression on us&mdash;the Castle of Chillon is its best
memory&mdash;and as the grip of winter was now tightening on
Switzerland we were glad to leave for Paris, whence Edith returned
direct to London while I again went rough through. Belgium to miss
no chance of a glimpse of Amy. A few days after reaching London we
were again at Carbis for the winter.</p>

<p>For both of us Aix remained a beautiful dream, a dream that we
always hoped some day to realise again. The proposal would come up
from time to time, especially after some serious illness of
Edith's, but there were always difficulties in the way, usually of
money, and it remained a dream to the end. In the very last year of
Edith's life, after her return in shattered health from America, it
seemed on the point of realisation; it was a final hope to which I
clung, with memories of what had happened before, and I wrote to
Dr. Blanc to ask if he would advise me to bring her under the new
conditions of disease. He was still alive (he died a few months
later) and replied kindly, recommending a visit at once. But the
difficulties of travelling for an invalid under war conditions, as
well as the usual financial impediment, proved decisive, and I
shall never know what promises of restoration were unfulfilled in
Aix.</p>

<p>It was doubtless the delightful experiences of Aix which led
Edith the very next year (1903) to another stay in France, this
time as an independent housekeeper. She arranged with the artist
Cayley Robinson to take his flat in an ancient house on the Quai
Bourbon in the Ile Saint Louis in Paris for the month of June. We
were accompanied by Priscilla, the housemaid, who had now become,
as she remained till she left us nearly ten years later to join her
sister in Australia, a companion and friend equally liked and
appreciated by both of us, wayward and trying as she was for all
her charming qualities. Edith had found her some years earlier in a
characteristic manner. She always naturally and instinctively
entered into conversation with the people near her on a railway
journey, and in this way one day meta nursemaid who was out of work
and looking fora place. She liked her appearance, and Priscilla was
engaged immediately as housemaid; not long after, her sister became
our cook and her brother our farm-man and gardener, a stolid,
reliable and faithful fellow, who stayed on as long as there was
any work to do; he came to see me in London only a few days ago.
But Priscilla, in whom there had from infancy been a fragile and
morbid strain (she died at thirty-six) was different from the
others, with a refinement and good taste, an unaffected love of
Nature and of art, which were doubtless in large part the fine
flower of her delicate and sensitive temperament. A friend of
Edith's, who could speak with knowledge on such matters, once
remarked that Priscilla was a real lady. I, who at all events knew
Priscilla better, could say the same; the gracious impulses of fine
breeding seemed to come to her instinctively. Exasperating she
could often be, but she was really devoted to both of us (with for
me sometimes a tender recognition of intimate insight), and we both
appreciated her. She suggested to Edith some of the traits of the
housemaid, Wilmot, described in her novel <i>Attainment,</i> who
was "more like a blackbird than a girl," or of the race of
mermaids, seeming to have the subconscious impulses cf a creature
whose nature it was to fly or to swim.</p>

<p>Our month in the Ile Saint Louis was not so memorable as the
stay at Aix, but it was full of novelty and exciting interest to
Edith, who enjoyed this attempt at French housekeeping and the
triumphant efforts, through imperfect French and much gesture, to
wrestle with marketing problems. It was pleasant to me also to
guide her into an enlarged knowledge of Paris and things Parisian
including the Opera, which before I had always religiously avoided
as merely conventional, but where I now enjoyed with Edith Rameau
and Dukas and Debussy, and once at the Trocadéro my beloved Gluck.
To Priscilla it was a unique and never repeated experience.</p>

<p>In these middle years of our life few experiences stand out. The
strands of our existence were being more intimately twisted
together and outwardly a certain routine was established. After the
marriage of Symons and his departure from Fountain Court, I had in
1901 taken a small flat in Rectory Chambers, Church Street, near
the old Chelsea church. Here, although quarters were cramped, it
was possible for Edith to come when she wished, and even for
Priscilla to sleep on a bed couch in my study. (That simple little
couch has been in use for nearly forty years, and I recline on it
now in the revolving sun-hut of my country garden). From time to
time I went abroad, usually alone now that Symons was married, and
there were occasional interesting little excursions with Barker
Smith to ancient haunts of my family in Suffolk. But most of the
time I was in Cornwall at the Count House.</p>

<p>There was indeed one episode (belonging, I think, to about this
time) which I cannot altogether pass over since it was perhaps the
most painful that came to us from the outside. A new admirer of
Amy's, who considered himself aggrieved, sought revenge by an
attack on my domestic peace. It is unnecessary to describe the
circumstances, which were not directly due to Edith or to Amy or to
me, and, rightly understood, reflected no discredit on us, while
they caused acute pain to all three. A manuscript reached Edith by
post one day, containing the story, under a transparent disguise,
of my relations with Amy. There were, of course, no essential facts
here of which Edith was ignorant, but the sting of the attack lay
in its vulgarity and in the diabolical ingenuity with which
plausible suggestions and perversions of truth were woven with real
facts, in the manner most likely to make me appear ridiculous and
to wound a wife of Edith's proud spirit. Nothing more malicious
could be devised. When Edith read it in her study she fell to the
floor. But deeply as she was wounded, and even though she could
scarcely help feeling that there was some truth in the perverse
falsifications the narrative insinuated, her unfailing loyalty was
proof against so despicable an attack. She treated it with the
contempt it invited from one of her temper, and acknowledged it
with a brief and dignified reply.</p>

<p>There was one little element in this episode which has left a
comic memory. The writer of the letter, in his aggrieved
malevolence, had, it appeared, at some time previously employed a
detective agency to watch my movements. There was little indeed in
my usual studious routine of life in London, and almost daily
visits to the British Museum, to satisfy a detective. But it so
happened that, during the period when I was thus unconsciously
subjected to observation, there fell a day which of all days in my
life I might mischievously have selected as most fitted to worry a
detective. Edith came to town with Priscilla, to spend the night at
the Euston Railway Station Hotel and leave early next morning to
lecture in Manchester. Priscilla had never really seen anything of
London and Edith arranged that I should employ the day in showing
her the sights of London she most wanted to see. Priscilla was
eager and indefatigable, and it was a pleasure for me to enjoy her
enjoyment and the reaction of her sometimes sensitively fine taste.
I have never in any city had so extensive a round of sight-seeing,
because for myself I prefer a more parsimonious reception of new
impressions, and I cannot recall all the places we visited. We went
to Westminster Abbey, I remember, and the National Gallery, and the
British Museum, and then to a restaurant in Soho where we had with
our meal a well-deserved bottle of French wine, and then to St.
Paul's, where we climbed to the Whispering Gallery and then up to
the deserted top of the dome (this incidentally enabled the
hitherto shy Priscilla to release on the stones a copious stream)
in order to view London from a height, and then to my rooms in the
Temple for tea, and thence to Charing Cross foot-bridge to see the
Thames at dusk, before the at length satisfied and happy Priscilla
was sent off to Paddington, where she was to catch the night-train
home. For a poor detective there could not be a more tedious and
unprofitable day's work. I shouid have liked to see that
detective's report. All that I heard of it was that it contained
the statement that we had gone to a hotel in Fleet Street, which
indeed we passed though I was ignorant even of its name, and that I
was "leading a very immoral life with women." Since then I have
been suspicious of the absolute reliability of private
detectives.</p>

<p>I here introduce the cheerful letter I received from Edith,
staying at the Midland Hotel, Manchester, a day or two after she
left Euston (April 17th, 1904):</p>

<p class="quote">"My darling Boy, all is well over&mdash;it was a
most intelligent audience, a good debate, and I had to defend my
own mysticism. One man said he thought Carpenter was my disciple.
Gallichan was there and spoke to me afterwards. My stepmother was
the first to come, and looked very staggered when I held out my
hand and spoke nicely to her. My brother had left a note last night
saying that she and he were dining with friends at the Hotel, but I
never saw them, and she said that Job [the nickname for Edith's
half-brother Arthur] was so terrified of a scene that he never came
to the dinner and was in bed in a rage that she was going to hear
me as it would upset me; but it did not a bit. I hear Nelly [Dakin]
has written saying I looked <i>lovely!</i> She says I <i>must</i>
go on lecturing. This is such a glorious playhouse of a hotel, I'm
revelling in it, and could telephone all over England from my
bedroom if I wanted. My father's lawyer heard I was here and came
to see me, and millions of relations come to-morrow morning. A. is
here and very sweet. Post just going, so I close. I love you
always."</p>

<p>The finally hurled missile recoiled on the head of him who
discharged it, and thereby ensured his complete exclusion from
Amy's life. Our relations remained the same. The wound in Edith's
heart, however, would from time to time rankle. At intervals, at
long intervals it might be, during all the years that followed she
would refer to "that manuscript." In a sense it never made any
difference; yet it was a blow that had come to her, as reasonably
enough she could not help feeling, through me. Love that lives is
fed by pain as well as by joy, and alike in her experience and in
mine that was found true.</p>

<p>It so happened, however, that throughout the ten years that
followed this humiliating episode, whatever troubles we might have
to traverse, no shadow from within or from without, real or
imaginary, fell across our love together. Edith followed the
shifting and sometimes disturbed path of her own intimate
friendships with women, always with me for her closest confidant. I
remained quietly devoted to Amy, of whose society I gradually
secured more without any anxieties and with Edith's slowly
increasing approval. Edith and I entered upon the long period which
most surely and firmly rooted our deep affections in a soil from
which no power in or out of the world could ever tear them up.</p>

<p>So far as I am concerned, I am sure, as I look back, that this
process was intensified by Edith's state of health and her now
frequent and severe illnesses. I was myself never ill, although my
constitution was not robust; I was liable to minor ailments, but I
seldom needed to spend a day in bed, and I never once required real
nursing during the whole quarter of a century of my married Life. I
was always the nurse and not the patient. I will not say that I am
sorry the parts were not sometimes reversed, for I know the care
which Edith was prepared to spend at the slightest signs of illness
in me, and the anxiety she when the smallest shadow of risk seemed
to be experienced, over me. But I realise how acutely one's love is
sharpened and deepened when the thing one loves is the perpetual
object of one's tender care. In all Edith's real illnesses I was
never her doctor; I never desired that responsibility and she never
professed any faith in my medical skill, while for slight disorders
she was a skilful doctor to herself. But I was invariably her
nurse, and as such she always accepted me, not only as a matter of
course and of necessity&mdash;for our circumstances and the size of
our dwelling would usually not have admitted a professional
nurse&mdash;but to her entire contentment and satisfaction. She was
always peculiarly sensitive in regard to intimate contacts with
strangers and it was a trial to her that anyone but me should be
present to assist her in the intimacies of the sick room. During
all the years I knew her, and through all her illnesses, I cannot
recall that she once had a nurse (except for massage and similar
special treatments) until the last year or two of her life, when
circumstances had changed. I was always her nurse, by day and by
night, if need be, though Priscilla might help from time to time,
and kind friends would come in to sit with her for an hour or two
while I went out for a walk or lay down to rest. Under such
conditions my work could only be done at odd moments or not at all,
and sometimes weeks passed in this way, once at least a whole
month.</p>

<p>The earliest of the more serious illnesses at this time was in
1905. In that year I had given up my little flat at Chelsea in
order to share with Edith a larger flat near Battersea Park which
she had taken over from acquaintances who were unable to complete
their term of occupation. She would come here from Cornwall from
time to time, bringing up Priscilla to do the work, and I cannot
recall being there by myself. In the spring I had gone away alone
on one of my numerous visits to Spain. I mention it because it was
one of the most memorable. Barcelona, as often before, was to be
the chief centre. I stopped at Nîmes on the way, and at Gerona, and
I also spent a few delightful days in Majorca. But, above all, I
made my first and unforgettable visit to Montserrat. The two
perfect May days I spent in the clear air of that serene and lovely
height mark the most prolonged period of sustained and almost
ecstatic exaltation I have ever reached. For a moment, for an hour,
possibly for a day, I have sometimes attained such inner joy
before, and even, though of this I am less sure, since; but never,
unless possibly at Sparkes Creek, has the experience of joyous
exaltation been so prolonged, for with that economy of joy, that
fear of reaching the dregs of the cup of pleasure which I must
regard as one of my traits, I left when I might still have spent a
day there. In my <i>Soul of Spain</i> I have tried to give some
record of that visit. A few years later I went again. I was wise
enough to know that I could not repeat the experience, but I was
seeking to obtain material for a more elaborate study of Montserrat
I wished to write, though now I know it will never be written. The
days of that second visit were sad days. My mood had changed; my
vigour had diminished, so that I had to abandon the fascinating
climb up to San Jeronimo I sought to repeat; the place itself,
beginning to be vulgarised, had changed for ever.</p>

<p>We spent the summer at Carbis, and Edith was in the midst of her
busy summer season when she was attacked&mdash;not for the first
time or the last&mdash;by pneumonia. We were in the Count House,
but the end of July was approaching, when the house had been let to
a large family. The date was postponed a little, but could not be
further postponed. Edith was slowly recovering; nothing was needed
but that she should continue to rest peacefully at the Count House.
The agitation of moving, of transforming the house for tenants, of
travelling to London, of settling in the sordid environment of
Battersea was all clearly undesirable and risky. But there seemed
nothing else to do and it was done. The lungs healed, but the
strain on the exhausted nervous system was too much. She fell into
a state of listless depression and melancholy, incapable of
physical activity or mental interests. As I now recognise, she was
suffering from the same condition which, again as a result of the
exhaustion of disease, overcame her, in a more serious form, ten
years later, the reaction of an organism normally active and alert
even to excess. Nothing seemed to avail. Priscilla was helpful and
friends were kind. I remember especially that Conrad Noel (son of
my old friend Roden Noel), at this time a curate in the north of
London, would find time to come across London, a troublesome
journey then, several times a week to cheer and interest her, and
succeeded better than most. Her London doctor at the time was an
able man, himself of neurotic temperament, and energetic in his
methods; he made every attempt to stimulate her to activity, but
with no brilliant results. I remember that on one occasion he told
her to exercise her will resolutely and walk round the lake in
Battersea Park. She was docile enough to obey. I accompanied her
and she succeeded in achieving the feat, but only with immense
effort. Salvation came at length in the way it most often came to
her, with a change to new air and scenery and the stimulation of a
fresh interest. I persuaded her to come with me to Reigate, where
my sister Louie kept a little foothold of two rooms; these I
arranged to take for a fortnight or so. Priscilla came with us and
slept on a couch in the sitting-room. It was a complete success.
Here within a few days, in the bright autumn air of this height, in
the pleasant little pine wood close by, Edith swiftly began to
revive. This revival was considerably aided by the attractive and
fantastic figure of a woman who also haunted the wood. Of course
Edith soon made her acquaintance, and found her to be an
accomplished person of musical training and moving among artists,
so that an immediate and seemingly mutual interest arose. No real
friendship, however, developed, for it appeared before long that
the fascinating dryad of the wood was in practical life a morbid,
mischief-making creature with a constitutional lack of veracity. So
the acquaintance was ultimately dropped. But so long as she
remained the bright-haired dryad she performed a useful function.
Edith was soon completely restored. When we returned to Battersea I
lose for a time the thread of memory.</p>

<p>The other chief illness of that period was more prolonged and
even more distressing. She had been complaining, even for years, of
occasional darting pains in the knee. Now, I think with the onset
of winter, this knee began to become seriously bad, and extremely
painful. Our good friend, Dr. Nichols of St. Ives&mdash;for whom
Edith always had much friendly regard though without great faith in
his medical skill&mdash;was kind and attentive, as he always was,
and treated her in the orthodox manner for rheumatism, with a
prolonged course of salicylates and later by immobilising the
joint. I came later to regard the neurotic element as most
prominent in the condition. Day after day, week after week, month
after month, she was confined to bed&mdash;which was at the Count
House at this time side by side with mine&mdash;and I was seldom
far away so as to give all my best attention to nursing her. The
evening and early night were to me the most trying time, for then
she would be delirious&mdash;a condition largely due, no doubt, to
the salicylate, for she was always susceptible to
drugs&mdash;referring to the people and things of her girlhood, and
struggling to get out of bed and go out on the moor, so that,
sometimes with Priscilla's aid, it might be necessary to hold her
down. With the passing of the winter the acute stage passed, but
the immobilised limb had become helpless; she was lame, unable to
walk, and, still confined to bed, only able to move across the room
on crutches. It was at this time as she lay in bed that with my
camera I took a series of pictures which, among all the innumerable
snapshots I had at one time or another taken of her, remain my
favourites. One, indeed, suggests her to me at once more
beautifully and more truthfully than any portrait I have of her
before or since. She reclines on the pillows in a posture of
complete repose reading a book, with the usual vase of flowers on
the little table between her bed and mine dimly visible in the
background, and on the wall the St. Ursula of Carpaccio, given her
by Stopford Brooke before we had ever met, which still hangs near
my bed (and there it still hangs, now thirty years afterwards). In
this position of restful repose all sense of strain has passed from
her face; the full, half-closed eyelids, the eloquently expressive
underlie, the softly rounded chin, speak only of a happy yet still
vitally alive calm, so often absent, so lovely and so satisfying to
me when present. One sees in her face, what was indeed the fact,
that this illness, distressing as it had been to me and painful to
herself, had not left her nervously exhausted, like the attack of
pneumonia. Her spirit was as ardent as ever. Soon she was
downstairs, and with too eager a delight in her new method of
locomotion she fell with her crutches in front of the house, and
learned to be more careful. Much trouble was needed to bring motion
back to the joint. When that was almost achieved she hastened to
London, though still rather helpless, and the crutches were soon
thrown aside and forgotten; vigorous treatment by heat and light
baths and similar methods completely restored her power of
motion.</p>

<p>It was such illnesses that bound me to her with new cords of
attachment vibrating in my heart with an anxiety perpetually
stirred by the mischances which her temperament and her
adventurousness induced, and never henceforth allayed until the
end. She accepted my care for her with a matter-ofcourse air, just
because it was her nature to give all for love as a matter of
course and to expect the same from those who loved her. She was
hurt if she suspected that I ever spoke of it. She delighted to
have me within call and ready to render any little service she
needed. Sometimes she would snub me in the presence of friends, and
if they protested she would reply: "It's good for him!" She had the
idea that I was becoming successful and exposed to the demoralising
influence of adulation which it was her business to counteract. I
understood this; there was no shadow of protest on my part when she
treated me as a child who needs sharp correction in the small
details of domestic life. I accepted this attitude calmly, even
when it was a trifle embarrassing. "Nobody contradicts me now,"
wrote Queen Victoria after her husband's death, "and the salt has
gone out of my life." I am sure that Queen Victoria hated to be
contradicted, and I sometimes resented being scolded like a child,
but no one treats me like a child now, and the savour has gone out
of my life. (It is nearly twenty years since I so wrote and it is
no longer true, for I have happily spent a large part of that
interval with a beloved friend whose attitude towards me has been
in many respects like that of Edith.)</p>

<p>Little things, little joys and little worries, and the routine
of work, broken from time to time by Edith's illness, seem to have
made the whole web of our lives during this period. There were no
great external troubles and no intimate conflicts to rend us apart
and bring us back with a clash of reunion. The nervous irritability
of Edith's temperament was still there, but I fully understood it
now, and indeed preferred it to fall on me rather than on others,
when it was apt to cause trouble. She used to repeat with amusement
the remark concerning her of a neighbouring farmer, an excellent
man with whom she had various dealings: "Not a better little woman
in the world," so it was repeated to her, he had declared, "but, my
God! tread on her toes, and you'll know it."</p>

<p>It was perhaps owing to the comparative calm of our life
together at this time, and also to briefer separations&mdash;in
1905, for instance, I find that we were together in Cornwall and
London for all but nine weeks of the whole year&mdash;that for a
period of some seven years after 1902 I find to my astonishment
that I have preserved almost none of her letters. I had no notion
that such an immense hiatus existed. There must have been a large
number of letters written during this period, for we were never
absent without writing daily. I imagine that they were concerned
merely to assure each othe of our welfare, to record briefly the
day's doings and make arrangements for the future. That this was so
is confirmed by one or two of her notes which have been
accidentally preserved because I used them, as was my custom with
odd scraps of paper, to make notes on. The extraordinary thing is
that this hiatus exists not only in the series of her letters to
me, but also of mine to her. She seems to have preserved even the
slightest note of mine&mdash;in flagrant opposition to her lifelong
habit of destroying all letters immediately&mdash;written during
the first years of our marriage, and the larger number of those
written during the last years. I preserved most of those she wrote
during the early years and nearly all written during the last
years. But both of us, unknown to each other, systematically
rejected as unimportant all the letters of the middle period. It
seems to be evidence of a curious kind of pre-established
harmony.</p>

<p>The chief events during these years were our various little
holidays and visits abroad. We usually took them separately. On her
part there were friends abroad with whom she could stay, or others
on holiday whom she desired to join. On my part, though it was
always a pleasure to go about with her, I had become nervous, on
account of her health, of taking her abroad or to any strange place
by myself. Yet, wherever I went, even with Amy, she was constantly
in my thoughts, and I was making mental notes of beautiful spots or
comfortable hotels to which I might bring her. She was, I think,
sometimes doubtful of my anxiety to do this. From time to time,
however, we went away together, especially to Suffolk, which I was
beginning to know well, and made pleasant visits to favourite
resorts of mine, to Ipswich and Lavenham and Clare.</p>

<p>I do not seem to have spoken as I should of those visits to
Suffolk which, once or twice or thrice a year, formed so pleasant
an interlude during more than twenty of the busiest years of my
life. They constituted an essential part of what has formed the
chief hobby I have pursued in my career: the study of the families
from which I spring. I was not pursuing any snobbish search for
noble ancestors, and I was not surprised to discover that my
ancestry has been persistently middle-class as far back as I can
go, even though on various middle-class levels. Until I was near
the age of forty I knew nothing whatever about my forefathers more
than two or three generations back and had never felt the faintest
desire to know. But then my father handed over to my keeping a few
old documents and letters which he had received from his father.
One among these specially aroused my interest: the will on
parchment of William Powle, who had died at Great Waldingfield in
Suffolk in 1727. What he was I had no idea (for I strangely
overlooked that he described himself as a clerk in holy orders),
but I knew he was an ancestor, for I had an Uncle Powle who had
been named, I knew, from a family back in our history. I resolved
to go to Great Waldingfield to find if any Powles still lived
there. It was natural I should consult my friend and old
fellow-student Barker Smith on the matter, for he had been born at
Castle Hedingharn, only a few miles away from Great Waldingfield.
That village is within a walk of Sudbury, so we planned to spend a
few days at Sudbury and explore. At Sudbury we set up at the "Rose
and Crown," a fine old inn with a courtyard, close to the
church&mdash;an inn we stayed at more than once on subsequent
visits&mdash;and next day set out for the village. We soon
discovered that the name Powle was unknown at Great Waldingfield,
so we proceeded to the churchyard to investigate the gravestones, I
taking one section and Smith another. Before long Smith announced
that he had discovered an altar tomb with a long Latin inscription,
well preserved since it was inscribed in slate, recording the
virtues of the Rector of the parish, the Rev. William Powle. From
that moment I was embarked on a research which I followed up
eagerly and persistently in leisure hours during the years that
followed, constantly adding to my store of family history. It may
not have been on this occasion that we called on the Rector, Canon
Stokes, who had published a little ecclesiastical history of the
church; he was kind and helpful and took no fee for supplying me
with Powle entries from the Register. I can say the same of other
Suffolk rectors whose help I needed in my research.</p>

<p>But it was a research which demanded far more than visits to
churches and rectors, though all that could be done in that way I
accomplished, visiting the churches or homes, all in Suffolk (save
one at Dartford in Kent), of some half dozen old parsons from whom
I was doubly descended by the cousinship of my parents. I found
valuable material in the Manuscript Room at the British Museum (as
well, of course, as in the Library itself), among the old Wills at
Somerset House, as well as in the local Suolk Probate Registry, in
the Record Office, and also in the Suffolk Archidiaconal archives,
where I was shut up alone to do my worst in a little room piled up
with old documents. I also came into friendly touch with the two
chief Suffolk antiquaries of that day, Mr. Edgar Powell and Mr.
Muskett. The former in an appendix to his book on the Powell family
had sought and set forth the genealogy of my Powle family (quite
distinct from his main subject) in a most helpful way, and the
latter had not only published many essential documents concerning
my Kebles, but he possessed and later presented to the British
Museum the interesting Diary of Adam Winthrop (father of the famous
founder of Massachusetts), who had therein furnished a glimpse of
the activities of his neighbour, Paul Powle, the ecclesiastically
troublesome grandfather of the excellent William Powle.</p>

<p>I write this reminiscence in 1937, and I tell of experiences
which are now in a dim past. But as I look back I am impressed by
the time and energy, and I think I may add skill, which I expended
in selecting and following up clues in so unfamiliar a field.
Evidently I was here exercising in a new field the same qualities
of flair and judgment and persistence which I had already long been
developing in a totally different field of research. It was a
research always full of pleasurable excitement. But the most
delightful memories that remain with me are the walks planned with
my dear and quaint old friend Barker Smith to some remote church or
village, with rests by the wayside, when Smith, as an enthusiastic
field naturalist, would perhaps discourse on flowers he had
plucked, with lunch on bread and cheese and ale at an inn, and at
length, our mission for the day accomplished, the simple meal in
the evening, perhaps on delicious Suffolk ham, at the hotel where
we had put up.</p>

<p>The outcome of my research, which took many years to complete,
was the gratification of my curiosity concerning the chief families
I was descended from for as far back&mdash;about the fifteenth
century&mdash;as I could go with certainty. Altogether the mass of
information was considerable, and I could make an interesting
book&mdash;which I no longer expect to make&mdash;concerning
English middle-class people, often parsons, and the families they
intermarried with&mdash;Kebles and Powles and Peppens and Ellises
and Olivers and Grays and Wheatleys and Havelocks&mdash;a pleasant
picture on the whole though, unfortunately, the man I know most
about, and who was not a parson, Paul Powle, came to be justly
described by Archbishop Laud as "very troublesome." Laud would have
said the same of me, though not on similar grounds, and I have been
so regarded by the judicial successors of the old ecclesiastical
courts.</p>

<p>It was, indeed, an interesting and unexpected result of my
ancestral explorations to find out how strangely I had, without
knowing it, combined and reproduced special marked traits of my
forefathers. Speaking broadly, I may say that my own character and
activities blend the two temperaments most pronounced on both sides
of my ancestry: the adventurous temperament of the sailor and the
spiritual attitude of the good parson. That is true even though I
knew too much of the sea ever to want to be a sailor, and that a
brief thought of entering the Church, long before I had ever heard
of any parson ancestors, was already dispelled before I sailed for
Australia. But even in more detailed traits, however we may choose
to figure to ourselves the nature and course of hereditary genes,
it was remarkable to find a distinct resemblance to this, that, or
the other ancestral family or some definite ancestor; persistence,
fidelity to a principle against one's own interests, a calm
indifference to opposition, a tendency to place responsibility on
women, a spontaneous and unconventional mysticism, a natural temper
of moderation&mdash;these are not matter-of-course traits and I
knew nothing of their existence among my ancestors when they were
already developed in myself and in my attitude to life, even though
freshly constellated.</p>

<p>For the most part, however,&mdash;though Edith's agile mind and
impulsive disposition often led to new adventures which were apt to
become new worries&mdash;I recall these years as mainly lived in
what for me was a routine of steady work, apart by myself at my
studio at Hawkes Point all the mornings and afternoons, while she
always had her hands full of a number of things (and at one time
had a studio of her own in St. Ives), even though sometimes it
seemed to her that I left her alone too much. I was sorry, but my
work made it inevitable; and while I had not in Cornwall a single
friend or a single distraction other than work to take me away from
her she had many friends to occupy her lonely hours. I usually
returned for lunch, and would bring with me to please her any rare
or beautiful thing I had found on the way, some late honeysuckle,
or gorgeous autumn leaves, or January's gorse, or those feathery
"palm" sprigs which always rejoiced us as the earliest sign of
spring. She was never without flowers, even in winter, and the
Cornish violets she so loved might generally be had from Lelant all
through the winter. Fresh flowers on the table and in the rooms
were a luxury she found it hard to be without, however scarce money
might be. She would certainly have agreed with Mahomet when he said
that if a man finds himself with bread in both hands he should
exchange one loaf for some flowers, since the loaf feeds the body
indeed, but the flowers feed the soul. There were, too, always a
few to be sent to some dear friend in London, and she never failed
to place some in my bedroom, though sometimes&mdash;suspicious, and
not always without reason, of my swift observation&mdash;she would
later ask me if I had noticed them. Every May, in due season, I
found by my bedside a little vase of the delicate <i>Stellaria</i>
or stitchwort which is my favourite wild flower, and on rare
occasions she gave me the white roses to which she attached a deep
and special significance. In June of 1891 she had written to me:
"The white roses brought you a message. Did they give it, I
wonder?" and a quarter of a century later, a few weeks before her
death, she bought in the street and gave me a white rose, that same
or the following day writing (for a little meeting at which she was
giving readings from my books): "When many years ago&mdash;about
twenty-eight&mdash;I first read the <i>New Spirit</i> I knew I
loved the man who wrote it. To-day, in reading <i>Impressions and
Comments,</i> I realise that the man who had written both books is
worthy of love and forgiveness and eternal comradeship." Now, more
than twenty years still later, I watch in my garden a lovely white
rose of June&mdash;"Snow Queen" or "Swansdown"&mdash;slowly
unfolding, and my thoughts go tenderly back, still wondering over
the message they were to bring.</p>

<p>It was, I think, in 1906 that we left the Count House. Tin had
for the moment gone up and a certain smart little man succeeded in
engineering a company for the plausible purpose of opening up the
old Chy-an-Wheal Mine to which the Count House belonged. The house
was accordingly required and the Company offered a few pounds as
compensation. Edith stood out for a more substantial sum and
eventually obtained it, though the mining scheme, as might have
been foreseen, was a failure, and slowly died out after the
shareholders' money had been wasted. The little farm was thus
brought completely to an end and we moved into the Moor cottages,
which Edith had long rented in order to let furnished.</p>

<p>The two Moor cottages in a single building stood inland at an
isolated and awkwardly situated spot behind the mine and off the
road, only approached by rough paths. It was a beautifully peaceful
place, with no houses in sight, facing the south, the grounds
running down to a little streamlet near to a well. This position,
so admirably suited for two writers, to some extent compensated for
the inconveniences of the cottages. They were small plain ordinary
labourers' cottages containing altogether four small and four very
small rooms. The two upper front rooms were the best and with the
pleasantest outlook. That in the right-hand cottage became Edith's
study and bedroom, that on the left mine. We had proposed to put in
a door joining the two rdoms, but the landlord refused permission
to knock the two cottages into one.*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* They have since been united by a little
porch. Many years later an artist friend, Mr. Bernard Sleigh of
Birmingham, when staying at St. Ives, painted, and kindly presented
to me, a little sketch of the cottages which now (1936) hangs in my
country bedroom.]</p>

<p>That refusal caused me many moments of acute anxiety at times.
When Edith's health was uncertain, as it often was during the
period at Moor cottages, I vividly recall how sometimes at night I
would press my ear to the thick wall in the endeavour to re-assure
myself but not daring to enter the cottage and so probably cause
unnecessary disturbance. Indeed, this would not have been easy, for
when we became settled it was arranged that Priscilla&mdash;who
usually slept in Edith's cottage and only when some friend was
staying with us in mine&mdash;should lock me up at night so as to
be able in the morning without disturbing me to enter and light my
fire. This locking me up at nights was often a joke with Edith.</p>

<p>So long as there were no upsetting disturbances the lives of
both of us went on comfortably in Moor cottages. I have said that
we were now two writers. The forcible disruption of the
farm&mdash;though several fields and animals and a stable, with
Bert, Priscilla's brother, to look after all, were still
retained&mdash;had definitely determined that literary vocation,
germinal in her youth, towards which, through all her farming
activities, Edith had been slowly tending. The revulsion from
ethics and the conventionalities of London life which she
experienced on marriage, the enthusiasm for Nature, the delight in
farming and gardening, constituted a necessary phase in her
development, a necessary fertilising process in her spiritual life,
but their work was done, and in her uncertain state of health a
rough natural life had become even harmful. She was now acquiring
the habit she retained occasionally for the rest of her life of
spending the early hours of the morning writing in bed, sometimes
as early as four o'clock, for she was always fresh in the morning,
and thus, moreover, escaped the household noises and interruptions
to which she was more sensitive than I have ever been. On
well-inspired days she would prop herself up in bed with cushions,
so that she could enjoy the pleasant prospect from the window, and
with her bed-table before her&mdash;the bed-table specially made
for her which now rests in my bedroom for my eyes to fall on
tenderly&mdash;and a cat or a dog or both lying on the bed, she
would do most of her work, having breakfast in bed, and then,
perhaps, if the impulse persisted, writing on till towards lunch
time, when she would have her bath and dress, the day's literary
work finished. I also had breakfast by myself in bed, and before
that meal I would read, never having been able to write before
breakfast. I had given up my studio at Hawkes Point, and Edith had
two large plain summer-houses made and set up in the grounds of the
cottages, a few yards apart from each other, one for me to work in
and the other for herself. They were, though fixed, of the same
size and type, with one side unenclosed, as the revolving shelters
which we knew nothing about then but learnt to know later, and I
recline now (1937) in one of them in my Sussex garden. It was here
that much of my last volume of my Sex <i>Studies</i> was written,
and here in good weather Priscilla would lay lunch. In the
afternoon Bert would bring the trap round and Edith would go for a
drive, perhaps to St. Ives, usually by herself, for I never cared
for driving (or later for motoring), while I went for a walk. In
the evening after dinner we would each go to our separate rooms and
beds, she to fall asleep instantly and I to read for a while. That
was our usual way of life, and at Moor cottages, where so few
external influences could enter to cause disturbance, it became an
almost stereotyped routine.</p>

<p>The only disturbances came from within and were chiefly due to
Edith's health. For the rest, our life together would have been at
this period singularly peaceful and happy. I can recall no incident
that marred our quiet harmony at Moor cottages, although one may be
sure that there were sometimes the little nervous storms that
Edith's temperament rendered inevitable. She was happy in her
creative work&mdash;novels and short stories and lectures to be
written and occasional articles in the <i>Daily
Chronicle</i>&mdash;and as soon as her morning's work was done she
was impatient till she could read it to me: "When can I read you
what I have written this morning?" After lunch or shortly before
dinner usually suited me best, and she was eager for my opinions
and criticisms, not always pleased with them at first but
disappointed if there were none. After the publication of her first
book she had little or no difficulty in finding a publisher, except
for <i>The Lover's Calendar.</i> The admirable little volume of
humorous stories, begun at Aix, <i>My Cornish Neighbours,</i>
appeared in 1906, dedicated "To Havelock." Next year came the
considerably revised and rewritten version of <i>Seaweed,</i> now
entitled <i>Kit's Woman: A Cornish Idyll</i>, and dedicated "To All
My Loyal Friends." In 1909 followed a novel, <i>Attainment</i>.
This book, which we talked over beforehand more than over any other
of her books except <i>James Hinton,</i> arose out of the idea,
which had occurred to her many years earlier, of embroidering a
novel around some of her own experiences in the Fellowship House.
It was to be a free and artistic version of those experiences and
to represent some of the successive phases of her own development.
The idea appeared to me excellent and I warmly encouraged her to
carry it out. The heroine is an intentionally vague image of
herself, the servants introduced are more exact pictures of
servants of her own, and the hero was in part suggested by me and
or or two friends. She introduced three characters suggested by
Stopford Brooke, William Morris, and Thomas Davidson whom she
realised quite fairly well though she had not known him. The book
seems to me well done, yet it is scarcely a success, for with her
usual impatience, and her anxiety to complete and publish, she
brought it to a premature end with the heroine's marriage. The idea
was thus suggested that marriage was attainment, though that was
far from her intention and rendered the story more feeble and
futile than if she had carried out her intention of carrying the
heroine's development further. Well written as it was, I thus count
it the least satisfactory of her books. In sending it to me on
publication, for I chanced to be away in London, she wrote from
Moor cottages: "my Boy, here is your <i>Attainment</i> with my best
and truest love. But for you it would never have been written, and
but for you probably never given to the world in this very nice
way: I wish you were here to let me hug you and then tell you you
had ashes on your waistcoat! I feel very near to you and I
<i>do</i> love you. Your own Wifie." A few months later she wrote
concerning her next book: "My Darling Boy, I'm glad you like the
Preface. Why do I feel so near to you? I told Olive in my letter
that nothing could divide you and me. It couldn't, could it? D.
[her dearest friend during those years and a sweet, unselfish
woman] really comes to-night. Love to Amy."</p>

<p>The Preface was that to <i>Three Modern Seers,</i> revised
lectures on Hinton, Edward Carpenter, and Nietzsche, which appeared
in the following year, 1910, with the words: "This book is
dedicated to my husband, Havelock Ellis, whose help in my work has
been its greatest stimulus." She had herself been a little doubtful
about the success of this book, which was entirely different in
character from her previous books, but I had always had faith in
it. This faith was justified, for the book found, and still finds,
numerous and appreciative readers.</p>

<p>This work was all done in a struggle with physical disabilities.
She was always suffering, or liable to suffer under any stress or
strain of fatigue or worry, from her heart and circulation. There
was cardiac hypertrophy and dilatation and a tendency to
pseudo-angina pains. She was stouter in body at this period than in
early years, when she was quite slender, and this increased weight,
which diminished again in later years, added to difficulties
further increased by the hilly Cornish district and the boisterous
climate. It was imperative that she should always guard against
these risks, she with her eager and sudden impulses, her disregard
of self, her helpfulness, her generosity of spirit, her pride which
disdained any confession of weakness. So it was that I, who had
come to know her so well, slowly acquired a perpetual emotional
undertone of anxious apprehension such as I had not known in the
earlier years of our life together, when I had too easily entered
into her reckless spirit of adventure. Now my love grew mixed with
fear, and fear made my love more sensitive while love sharpened my
fear. When I knew that she was safely tucked up in bed writing on
her little bed-table I was at rest. My worst moments were when her
afternoon drives in the pony trap, mostly alone, were unusually
prolonged, for I would recall the dangerous accident that had once
happened to her on such a drive. She would be impatient if I asked
her when she would be back; any sense of compulsion was intolerable
to her, and there was no saying what matter of interest might not
arise to cause delay. So when I thought she was due to return I
would leave my papers and come down to pace the garden path, with a
growing and, as I knew, unreasoning nervous apprehension in the
deepening dusk if her return was delayed, as it sometimes was, for
an hour or more. Then at last, and long before the trap appeared in
sight, I would hear from the curves of the steeply undulating path
the welcome tinkling of the little Spanish bells, brought from
Malaga and fastened to the pony's harness, and I was at the garden
gate to greet her. Anxious or not, I was always there to meet her
on her return, and a friend spending a few days with us, who once
accompanied her on the drive, still recalls what she describes as
the radiant love on my face when I lifted Edith down from the
trap.</p>

<p>Nevertheless I went to London as usual, though at longer
intervals, and when arrangements with Edith allowed, sometimes, as
she may have thought, only too readily. But if the tender and
devoted D. was able to be at Moor cottages I was even more at rest
regarding Edith's welfare than when I was there myself. "I am happy
so long as I know you are all right," I would say to her. "Then you
would be happy if I were dead?" she would answer in a puzzled way.
But, as I tried to explain, my happiness in absence from her was
bound up with the feeling that she was always within reach, and
that we were each threading a path that would soon bring us
together again. Nor was it true that I was at peace away from her.
The undercurrent of apprehension was ever beneath the surface of my
mind. It was always acutely stirred when a telegram reached me in
London. I would tear it open with feverish haste. It was, indeed,
oftener than not from her, not necessarily to convey any serious
news, but to send a word of cheer or tell of a change in
arrangements. The terrible telegram I dreaded was long in coming,
yet it came at last, and was the more terrible because I was not
there to receive it in time. Now when I take a telegram into my
hand I may smile sadly to myself, and open it leisurely, assured
that it cannot be terrible.</p>

<p>There was a serious illness one winter at Moor cottages, apart
from the more constant strain of the heart trouble, a prolonged
attack of broncho-pneumonia. I felt acutely at this time the
separation in different cottages. I was her sole nurse with
Priscilla's assistance. So for some time I spent the nights in my
dressing-gown on a narrow couch near her bed, and found this a
great mental relief during a period of anxiety. The illness was
prolonged, and necessarily slow. But her mental activity asserted
itself at an early stage. In the course of two or three mornings
she dramatised in one act a little story, "The Subjection of Kezia"
in <i>My Cornish Neighbours</i>. Kezia was a living figure into
which Edith had wrought, no doubt consciously, traits of her own
nervous irritability, and the story dramatised admirably, with a
real knot simply and cleverly unravelled. I warned her how hard it
was for an unknown dramatist to receive even consideration at the
hands of managers, but, swift as usual in thought and act, she sent
it off at once to Mr. Otho Stuart, who was then producing some
remarkable plays at the Court Theatre. Almost by return of post, to
our delight, he replied accepting the play and stating that he
wished to produce it immediately. Edith's joy was tempered by the
consideration that she was still too ill to go to London to oversee
the production, and a little later, while she was yet confined to
her bed, the playlet was put on. I sat by her bed while this great
event was in progress and one of her most valued friends, Mr. Frank
Fowks, of the South Kensington Museum, had the good inspiration to
send a telegram to assure her it was a real success.</p>

<p>So it turned out. As a curtain-raiser. <i>The Subjection of
Kezia</i> was played for many weeks at various leading London
theatres, as well as in the provinces. It was, indeed, Edith's one
unqualified popular success on the stage, and a year or two later,
when she sold her rights in it, she had, for those few hours work
on a sick-bed, received a hundred pounds. It also brought her into
personal touch with leading actor-managers, who were ready and
anxious for any promising idea for a play, and incidentally it gave
her a free entry to the theatres, now not only her chief recreation
but an opportunity to study the methods of the stage. At the same
time her large circle of friends and acquaintances began to include
a contingent of actors and actresses, often of course on the pounce
for good parts.</p>

<p>This new stimulus in her life, which remained active to the end,
reinforced the influences which were already at work to effect a
change in the current of her existence and mine. The removal from
the Count House had brought to an end the already waning attraction
of farm life. The recent illness and the condition of her heart had
made it clearer than ever that the climate of Cornwall, as Dr.
Sansom had told her long before, was not the most favourable, while
here also she was cut off from good medical advice and help. Her
new mental activities, moreover, called for her frequent presence
in London, although, after the earlier break on marriage, she never
again wished to live there entirely, shut off from the country life
she had come to love. Now there was a new motive. The first and
immediate step was to give up the Moor cottages, too cramped and
uncomfortable, as well as too isolated for one so sociable as Edith
and also so liable to be an invalid. She resolved to make Rose
Cottage on the main road, now the only cottage left to her, the one
Cornish foothold. She had had this cottage on long leases over many
years, and it had proved profitable for letting purposes. Once we
had lived in it for a few weeks, but had not found it home-like.
Gradually, however, with her usual ingenuity, Edith had introduced
a number of improvements; it had become as pleasant and comfortable
as one can expect an old Cornish cottage to be. Henceforth it was
our Cornish home, whenever we were at Carbis during the remaining
six years of her life. Now it is more heavily burdened with
memories, sweet or sad, than any home we ever lived in together.
She had put my name into the lease so that on her death what she
regarded as a valuable source of profit might benefit me. But I
have never seen it since; I transferred it with the furniture, for
a trifling consideration, to one of her friends. It is still often
in my thoughts, and Carbis Bay is now to me a Paradise from which,
by my own resolve, I am for ever excluded.</p>

<p>I will go back a little to give some extracts from Edith's
letters (which I again began to preserve in 1909), serving to show
how life was dealing with both of us. I had resolved to take a
larger flat than the small three-roomed one I occupied at the top
of a little building near the Tate Library in Brixton, very
inconvenient if ever Edith stayed with me. For the advantage of us
both I selected a more commodious flat (on the first floor, as it
was still not easy for Edith to mount many stairs) in the
Canterbury Road, not far away, opposite the Police Station. It was
a solid and well-constructed building, erected some thirty years
earlier and considered a notable achievement when flats were still
a novelty. It proved to be my London home for twenty years, during
most of that time, indeed, my only home. On September 7th, 1909,
Edith wrote from the Moor cottages:</p>

<p class="quote">"My Darling Boy, I think that the flat idea sounds
splendid. Offer them £46 at first and let me one room for £10. Be
in it before I come up and I will bring a bed and a few things with
me. I should not disturb you a bit as I can always&mdash;as I do at
the Club [the Lyceum, where she sometimes stayed]&mdash;cook my own
breakfast, etc., and I should be <i>so</i> glad to have one room I
could lock up and go to whenever I wanted. If you think £15 fairer
I could perhaps manage that, or £12, whichever you think. [I agreed
to the £10, and I always prepared her breakfast, which she had in
bed.] I shall be very anxious to know if you do this. If there is a
vile paper it could be papered later, and I prefer a stained floor
as you know. They began the 'Kezia' week in Manchester last night.
Wish I could have afforded to be there. I have had to have the
Hinton lectures re-typed as they are scribbled all over and no
publisher would look at them. I've read the new Nietzsche Life and
I don't see I can say much more unless I put in another person's
thoughts, and in my book <i>[Three Modern Seers]</i> Nietzsche is
the least important 'seer.' D. sends her love. We are both sitting
in the garden in the sun, but there is a sharp wind. We go to
Prussia Cove to-morrow for the day, and Gertrude Russell [Hon. Mrs.
Rollo Russell] who is at the Lizard, may come over on Thursday;
they are selling Dunrozel [the Hindhead estate where we had
occupied the charming bungalow]. Don't say you would not like me to
have a room in your flat&mdash;I wouldn't disturb you. I'm used to
seeing to myself lately."</p>

<p>We evidently settled in before September was over, but two
months later, when leaving London for the winter, I let the flat
for a time to Mrs. Montefiore, a friend who was at that time a
prominent feminist and suffragette. She is referred to in a letter
of the 21st of November from the Moor Cottages:</p>

<p class="quote">"My Darling Boy, I am very anxious to know how you
are. It is very cold but gloriously sunny...Do take care and stay
in one room, use mine if you like, and get Amy to nurse you and
come whenever you want. I hope you have just said Mrs. Montefiore
is a lecturer and social worker. I expect it is only prostitutes
they don't want, though in these days how one is to know t'other
from which Heaven knows. The place looks perfectly sweet and all
newly done up...I love you very, very much, and though you try me a
bit at times I know I try you ever so much more; but we <i>do</i>
love one another, and nothing and no one will ever alter it."</p>

<p>The next letter I have preserved is written in the early spring
(March, 1910) and is in the same tone. After practical details, she
concludes:</p>

<p class="quote">"I do trust you will be all right. I hate to think
what a poor time you have had lately, but all shall be sweet for
you when you come back. I love you <i>very</i> deeply, and nothing
could ever make me unlove you. Like Tryphena, the worst of me is in
my tongue. God bless you!"</p>

<p>And a few days later:</p>

<p class="quote">"Bitterly cold here. I don't feel a bit
vital&mdash;sort of worm, and neither man, woman, nor kid. Do take
care, for it is madness to be in London now. I shall be delighted
to see you back, for nice and sweet as N. [the dear friend then
staying with her] is I can't concentrate on my work the same and I
want to get new work done. My photo is coming out in the
<i>Bookman.</i> Glad Symons is so much better."</p>

<p>Early in May she went over to Paris, to see special friends, and
notably for the first time the American woman W., who had earlier
been the chief friend of Lily, and a fellow artist, though it was
only gradually, owing to Lily's silence, that Edith heard of her
existence&mdash;so that relations had been difficult. But Edith
skilfully overcame the difficulties and the two became genuine
friends in their joint affection for the dead Lily. Letters or
cards came to me nearly every day.</p>

<p class="quote">"Safe and well and happy. Lovely crossing. I do
hope you are enjoying your brief period of peace. Shall I never
disturb it again?...W. is charming. I am feeling quite different,
and we talked sweetly of Lily and of the future. I think of you
always."</p>

<p>And on the corner of the card in D.'s hand: "Love from D."</p>

<p class="quote">..."I've just heard the King [Edward VII] is dead,
and there is no news from you. I do trust you are all right. All
here so sweet to me, and my little D. is adorable, but we wish you
were here. My heart yearns to you, and yours to me I know. This is
a dreadful thing for us&mdash;I liked my king, and the new one will
be no use in all the crisis. D. sends a big kiss and I send more
than you ever realise. Take care, dear, and write sweetly to your
wifie."</p>

<p>She was in France again fora short time at the end of August,
and it was arranged that I should come over to Normandy fora day or
two before going to see Amy in Belgium.</p>

<p class="quote">"My Darling Boy," she wrote on the 24th of August
from the Hotel du Prince de Galles in Paris. "All is well. I'm a
different person at once in this land of sparkle. It is like being
at home. Same room, hotel deliciously comfie. I have my café at 9,
and no lunch&mdash;only a biscuit any time I feel like it. W. and I
are like splendid men pals. She talks easily about L. and has had
her new friend for five years, a singer and as tall as herself, so
I look like a hyphen between two big American words. W. is changed,
a quiet resignation on her. She seems quite to have accepted what I
struggled to make clear years ago&mdash;that L. was sick of me and
only waiting to see her. Thank God she thinks no evil of
her&mdash;that is what L. would have wished, and no one can o take
away from me my own memories. I walked about Paris all alone
yesterday, did several miles I fancy. I had on my new hat with a
lovely ruffle D. has sent me, which has turned me at once into a
<i>chic</i> French woman. I travelled with a charming American girl
musician and gave her the roses Montefiore brought me. She declared
I was not English: 'The English women are dead&mdash;dead.
You&mdash;oh! you are alive&mdash;My! so alive.' When I told her my
age she did laugh! They all spoil me here. W. kissed me once on the
lips and pushed her hands through my curls; 'I expect L. rather
liked your curls,' she said. Yesterday a funny little look came on
her face and she said: 'Do you know, sometimes you have L.'s
identical intonation and, a little, her smile?' It seems to be so
natural to be with her somehow and there is not an atom of
strain...We start on Saturday for <i>le bon Dieu</i> knows where
but I'll let you know; anyhow I fancy we shall stay a night or two
with Montefiore's friend at Duclaire near Rouen. I feel as
lethargic as a cat and as alert as a snake and a dragonfly in one
body."</p>

<p>A few days later she wrote from Duclaire:</p>

<p class="quote">"The holiday of my life! We are having everything
splendid here, with Monte's friend, for five shillings a day.
To-morrow we settle in Caudebec. Get a new hat before you come and
reach us on Sunday at latest."</p>

<p>I duly arrived on Sunday (4th of September, 1910) to meet the
little party at Lillebonne, going on shortly after to Belgium,
visiting Louvain, and spending days or nights at Malines (where I
heard a memorable recitation on the Cathedral carillon), Brussels,
Antwerp, and familiar Bruges. Both Edith and I were back in London
a week or so later.</p>

<p>I may seem, these letters suggest, to have over-emphasised
Edith's illnesses and my anxieties at the Moor cottages. She was by
no means always ill there, nor I always anxious. In the good season
of the year especially, it was a place of delight and of joyous
work for both of us. I remember how I would walk up and down the
narrow paths on one side or the other, between the potato rows, or
near the sweet peas, dreaming or thinking out my work, glancing up
now and again to perhaps catch her bright face at the window. (She
loved sweet peas, growing them in quantities, and one year this was
rather a sore point with me, for she put up a notice that they were
for sale. Proud as she was in some respects, she had none of the
foolish conventional pride from which I could not quite free
myself, and she would sell a pennyworth of flowers with the radiant
delight of a child over the transaction.) It was in the summerhouse
she had set up for me in these grounds that I had at length brought
to a conclusion the task of my <i>Studies</i>.</p>

<p>That work, the task of my life, had been in my mind for more
than thirty years. It had first glimmered vaguely before me, as I
have already told, in Australia, while I was pacing up and down the
avenue at Burwood after my school duties for the day were over. It
began to grow stronger, though still formless, when three years
later, at Sparkes Creek, the inspiration Bashed upon me that I must
have a medical education, or my work could not be done. A year or
two later on my return to England I had begun in a small way the
collection, which I have never since ceased to carry on, of data,
notes and memoranda. Then, during the years of study at the
hospital, the scheme of <i>Man and Woman</i> slowly grew, as a
preliminary study to clear the ground for the investigation of the
sexual impulse itself; I anticipated it would not be more than a
pamphlet, but in the ten years that passed before I had completed
it for publication, in 1894, it had become a good-sized book, and
it continued to grow until it reached its final eighth edition in
1934. Meanwhile, the <i>Studies</i> themselves were slowly, vety
slowly, taking shape in my mind. It was, as my nature is, a natural
growth. I never at any stage drew up a systematic outl ne
beforehand. I never knew far ahead what shape it would take. I was
only very sure that it was there, and would grow. It was
intertwined with all sorts of other work. I never feel able to work
at one subject long at a time&mdash;for my work is play and play
demands freshness&mdash;but always I knew that the <i>Studies</i>
were my main work, and whatever else I might be doing I was always
consciously or subconsciously furthering the progress of that work.
When I see myself praised; as sometimes happens, for my erudition,
I smile, for I am not a scholar who lives surrounded by books but a
dreamer lying in the sunshine, and erudition is the smallest
qualification for the work that I have done. The supreme
qualification has doubtless been a deep inner sympathy and an ever
closer personal touch with other human beings, combined with an
artist's power of expression. It happened at the same time that I
am interested in many things, and that at every moment I have at
once instinctively felt the bearings of every fact I encountered on
the main interest I had at heart, noting it down accordingly. It
was thus that during long years I acquired a vast amount of
miscellaneous material to be woven into my <i>Studies,</i> and
incidentally acquired the undeserved reputation of immense
encyclopaedic erudition, whereas it is the artistic skill and
critical judgment expended in using the material rather than its
mere accumulation for which credit should be assigned, if credit is
due.</p>

<p>The first volume was published in German, in 1896, in English
shortly afterwards, and the others slowly followed at intervals
during the next fourteen years. Sometimes, as I felt myself growing
older, the fear of death would come over me, but if I shuddered it
was solely at the thought that I should leave my work unfinished.
That thought never had the slightest influence in hastening it; to
me it was natural to work, if without rest, still, after the
Goethean maxim, without haste. So, finally, the last, the longest
and most important volume,* was brought to an end in the
summer-house that Edith had made for me&mdash;as she had made so
many of the conditions that favoured my work&mdash;on that quiet
southern slope at the Moor cottages. In my pocket diary for the
year 1909, at the date of the seventh of August, I find pencilled
the entry&mdash;and in the whole series of diaries it is the only
entry that is not a bald statement&mdash;in the words of the great
Elizabethan, George Chapman: "The work that I was born to do is
done."</p>

<p class="footnote">[* I mean Volume <i>VI, Sex in Relation to
Society</i>. Many years later (in 1928) I published a large volume
of supplementary Studies.]</p>

<p>A deep calm joy possessed me, a serene exultation. I could enter
into the emotion that stirred Gibbon when he wrote the last words
of his <i>History</i> in the summer-house at Lausanne. Certainly I
had not, like him, achieved an immortal work of scientific art. My
work, I knew, must in the nature of it be always crumbling and
every day grow a little more out of date. I have myself had to
re-write parts of it.*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Now as I revise these pages, in the summer
of 1937, I have just completed a new and for me final edition of
the chief volume, <i>Sex in Relation to Society,</i> for
publication at length in England. Again I am reclining in a
summer-house, this time the revolving shed in the quiet garden of
the Sussex cottage where I mostly live, surrounded by the loving
care and devotion of the dear companion of my last years.]</p>

<p>Neverthelss, I felt that my satisfaction was justified. I had
not created a great work of art. But I had done mankind a service
which mankind needed, and which, it seemed, I alone was fitted to
do. I had helped to make the world, and to make the world in the
only way that it can be made, the interior way, by liberating the
human spirit. The gratitude of men, and of women, has made me
humble. I have sometimes felt that the taunt might be flung at me
which was flung at Jesus: "He saved others, himself he could not
save." Yet, I am well assured, with as little truth in the one case
as in the other, for I have never sought any salvation for myself.
I have been well content to be a Knight of the Holy Ghost. As I
write these words I recall that Edith's pet euphemism for the male
sex organ was "the Holy Ghost." Well, be it so! For I have always
instinctively desired to spiritualise the things that have been
counted low and material, if not disgusting; and where others have
seen all things secular I have seen all things sacred.</p>

<h2><a name="ch9" id="ch9"></a>Chapter 9</h2>

<p>It was by chance, and not by design, that the conclusion of my
<i>Studies</i> almost coincided with the change in our external
life which severed many of the links with Cornwall. It was an
innovation when in 1909 I took the larger London flat which
contained a room for Edith. Previously, when spending a few weeks
in London, she had taken the furnished flat of some friend, as mine
was too small for more than a few days' visit, though we had on
occasion fitted Priscilla into a small couch in my study. But
pleased as Edith was with the new arrangement it had to be modified
in a year or two.</p>

<p>As her activities in London increased Edith found the journey to
Brixton, especially at night, too fatiguing; it was also rather
disturbing to my regular habits and early hours which were the same
for me in London as for both of us at Carbis. It thus came about
that in 1912 she took a flat at the top of a doctor's house in
Harley Street, the doctor (Dr. Jensen) being a friend whose patient
she had shortly before been. Here she was comfortably and centrally
situated; here I could go to see her, and she could come from time
to time to spend a few days at my flat, no longer as a tenant, but
as a welcome guest. This was an arrangement that suited us both. It
was always a joy to me to make her as happy as I could, to provide
all the little comforts she needed and appreciated, to think of the
things she most liked to eat, to bring her breakfast in bed, to
prepare her bath, to serve her and wait upon her in all
things&mdash;for we were now nearly always alone, with more skill,
no doubt, than in the earlier days when she had been my sweetheart
in a more conventional sense than she had now become in a deeper
sense.</p>

<p>We were nearly always alone because Priscilla had now left us.
This happened, suddenly in the end, at Rose Cottage, in 1911. She
had been ill, a prolonged and persistent feverish attack, and Edith
sent for a Dr. Hamilton at Hayle, a kind and sensible Scotchman in
whom she had acquired confidence, to attend her. But convalescence
was slow and Priscilla remained weak and irritable. She had
latterly manifested something of that independence and self-will
which old servants&mdash;she had been with us ten
years&mdash;usually assume, but which Edith in her uncertain health
sometimes found intolerable. An incompatibility of moods thus
arose, and one morning this culminated in a determination on
Priscilla's part to go home at once. So Edith drove her to the
station and we never saw her or heard from her again, although her
brother, the devoted Bert, remained with us a year or two longer,
and has in recent years come to see me. Edith felt the loss and was
hurt, for she had come to look on Priscilla almost as her child.
From time to time she would propose writing to ask her to come
back. That, I easily persuaded her, would have been a mistake, nor
would Priscilla, I knew, ever come back. She looked upon Edith as
she looked upon her mother. But, as happens to people of limited
and morbid nervous energy, she was a philosopher. She sought to
guard her sensibilities. You must forget, she would say to me, what
you can't have. It was part of this philosophy, having cut herself
off from us for whom she cared more than for any other people in
the world, to make the cut complete. So she never again gave a
single sign. It was not indifference but the reverse. She went out
to Queensland to join her married sister, who had once been our
cook, with her set up a shop, and died from complications of
influenza just a year before Edith.</p>

<p>The immediate cause of this shifting of our centre of gravity to
London was, however, the success of Keia. As soon as possible,
Edith came to London and before long was on friendly terms with all
concerned in the production of her playlet, especially the actress,
Beryl Faber (Mrs. Cosmo Hamilton), who in the chief part had
largely contributed to its success. One day Edith went down to the
pleasant house and grounds which Beryl and her husband occupied at
the village of West Drayton, thirteen miles from London. Now Edith
and I, since realising that Cornwall could not be our permanent
home, had often talked of taking conjointly some little house with
a large patch of ground, not too far from London, where we might
peacefully enjoy our old age together. On coming to Beryl's Edith
exclaimed that that was the kind of place she would like, and her
hostess immediately told her that the adjoining piece of ground
with a clump of cottages in the middle was at that moment to let.
They went across to view it. Woodpecker Farm, as it was called,
consisted of a piece of land ten acres in extent, with a compact
half-timbered building used as three cottages and a large solid old
barn with stables. The building was ancient, with much rough-hewn
oak, dating back at least three centuries, I suppose, but
altogether out of repair, ruinous in places, infested with vermin,
occupied by the lowest characters in the village, gaol-birds and
the like, who seldom paid their rent. Edith was enthusiastic; with
that keen vision for the possibilities of a place, which had been
tested before, she knew how much could be made of Woodpecker. She
went to interview the landlady at once; and before she came away,
as her impetuous manner was, she had almost committed herself and
me to take the place on the longest lease possible.</p>

<p>When she broke this news to me, that day or the following, I
was, naturally enough, dubious, and not less dubious when a little
later I accompanied her to view our future estate. There was no
doubt about the possibilities, but to convert them into actualities
the £50 of the builder's estimate would, I knew, go but a little
way, and I caught the smile on the face of the landlady's business
agent who accompanied us round. But Edith brushed away my caution.
Difficulties were always a stimulus to her; she was fortified by
opposition. She declared that it was too late to go back
honourably, and that if I refused to share the responsibility she
would find someone else. That would hardly have been feasible, as I
knew. But I yielded, and even entered into the spirit of the
adventure, subduing any hurt feelings over the manner&mdash;so
natural to her temperament though so alien to mine in which I had
been drawn into it. At the same time I spent sleepless hours at
night over the burden we were assuming that neither of us was
really able to bear.</p>

<p>The first blow to Edith's satisfaction over Woodpecker came soon
after the lease was signed and long before the place was ready for
us to enter. Beryl Faber, whose presence as a friendly neighbour
had been one of the chief attractions of the place, announced that
in consequence of a disagreement with her landlord she was leaving
West Drayton immediately. It was not the first time that Edith, who
never found it easy to learn by experience, had encountered a
similar experience. She had, in the early years of our marriage,
taken a little cottage in Cumberland on a long lease to be near an
old school-fellow friend, whose family shortly afterwards were
obliged to give up their estate, and that cottage had been a source
of much worry. Woodpecker, however (after a preliminary fumigation
to dispel the vermin), was progressing favourably. Edith, always
fertile in excellent ideas, was making the place ever more
convenient and more agreeable, and so of course piling up the
financial indebtedness of both of us, while there was always some
new and unexpected expense to meet. Priscilla, too, who was part of
the original scheme, had left us before we actually entered into
possession, and for some time the servant difficulty was a source
of worry, but after one or two unfortunate experiments a devoted
young woman arrived whom Edith had befriended because she was about
to have an illegitimate baby, and she remained with us, always full
of gratitude, until a year or two later she married. There was,
however, for a time, the faithful Bert, who duly came up together
with the pony and the donkey, and most of the Cornish furniture.
Edith had a telephone, which (unlike me) she henceforth regarded as
essential, brought across the grounds and set up at her bedside,
and finally, in 1911, we settled in Woodpecker.</p>

<p>It had become a charming spot, nor had our difficulties yet
dispelled Edith's sanguine hopes for the future, while I, too, was
happy to live in summer under the great walnut tree where, when
possible, we would have our meals, being both at one in the
instinct to live out of doors, she even more than I. In winter,
however, difficulties became pronounced. To try to meet the serious
expenses Edith occasionally took a paying guest from among her
acquaintances, not a proceeding that was really agreeable to either
of us. It helped to arouse in Edith a distaste for Woodpecker. At
last she realised that the cost of the place was more than we could
bear, and that any prospect she had earlier cherished of its paying
for itself was remote. After we had been there two years a wealthy
American lady, who had lately entered the circle of Edith's friends
and became highly esteemed by her, paid a visit to Woodpecker, fell
in love with the place, and offered to take it over from us with
all it contained. The offer was on a liberal scale, covering much
of the outlay, and was soon accepted. Of my share of the purchase
money, indeed, I saw little, for Edith argued characteristics lly
that her debts were urgent and I could wait, so my repayment was
postponed to a time that never arrived. With strangers honourable
and generous in money matters beyond the wont of women, Edith was
willing to let friends wait, though always with sanguine confidence
that all debts would ultimately be repaid. So ended our attempt to
set up house together on an equal basis. We planned other attempts
but circumstances never permitted us to make them.</p>

<p>That settlement at West Drayton in August 1911, the first for
nearly twenty years within a few miles of London, marked, I have
already indicated, a new stage in Edith's development. She was now
easily able to go up to London every day if she liked (I went more
rarely), driving to and from the station. Now she was able to
exercise her personal magnetic influence as well as her social
qualities, heightened by the intellectual vigour slowly matured
through the inner and outer experiences of her active life in
Cornwall. She was already an effective lecturer when I first knew
her; as a speaker as well as a personality she sometimes aroused
enthusiasm; it was soon after our marriage that a friend had
declared to her that she was "the light and hope of our future
civilisation," a saying that I would later sometimes playfully
recall to her. But in the early years she was also a little crude,
narrow, and inexperienced, apt to be over-serious and too
high-strung. A touch of exaltation, for good or for evil, was no
doubt often present to the last; though blended with compensating
elements, it was a part of her temperament. But there was also at
the core a solid structure of firm fibre, needing long to mellow
but susceptible of much refinement. Now, approaching the age of
fifty, but still youthful in mind and spirit, though her hair was
soon to be touched with grey, she had gained both insight and
breadth, for she had probed life deeply and become tolerant, her
seriousness blended with a swift humour, often daring but never
belittling what it touched. She could grasp sympathetically the
character of the most various people she met and say the word that
unlocked the heart of each.*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* For illustration I quote from two letters
she left behind, one from a man, one from a married woman, each of
whom she had only met once or twice. The man wrote: "I feel I must
tell you how much I valued your kindness to-day. It is such a
wonderful thing to find someone who understands without condemning
or consoling too much. 'Broadminded' people do harm by exaggerated
tolerance, and yet I cannot tell you what it means to find someone
who keeps a sense of proportion. I wish I had met you ten years
ago." The woman writes: "I wish I could tell you how all you said
at the Club that day remains with me. The vitality and the
vividness was so impelling, and the strange thing was that you were
speaking directly to me as an individual soul. I shall carry a
wonderful memory of you to make into a reality in my life. The
width of the world is in your sympathy. I wonder if you know how
you touch us who only draw near for a moment in a life-time.
Courage inspires courage, and after I had been with you I felt I
could do anything that had to be done and in the right way." There
must have been many who wrote to her, or could have written, as
these two persons wrote. ]</p>

<p>As a public speaker she had gained in power and range and was
easily able, on occasions either grave or gay, to speak
extemporally, though, always desirous to do everything well, she
would if possible think out every speech beforehand.</p>

<p>The centre of her social activities henceforward was the women's
literary and artistic Club in Piccadilly, the Lyceum&mdash;the
house happened to have once been that of her early idol
Byron&mdash;and here she could transact business, meet friends, and
largely increase her already large circle of friends and
acquaintances. Here she found the medium in which her long
repressed social activities might harmoniously expand. She was, I
believe, the chief founder and organiser of a Poetry Circle which
offered hospitality to various prominent writers of the day; she
was congenially active in arranging the dinners in connection with
this Circle, and a much appreciated speaker at these functions. I
was never present, for they were alien to my tastes, but I heard
the rumour of them. She seems to have been popular and a general
favourite at the Club, whatever jealousy and dislike may possibly
have been felt by a few. Her winning simplicity and directness of
manner, her humanity, her ready wit, with an occasional mischievous
sting disarmed by the small woman's genuinely childlike
disposition, overcame the shock, in so respectable an environment
of outspokenness and unconventionality. She never hesitated to
express vigorously her opinion of any proceeding in the Club
management of which she disapproved, and the democratic attitude
long cultivated in her Cornish farmyard remained unimpaired in
Piccadilly. Thus she took a human interest in the head porter, a
Frenchman of rather superior type, once or twice even took him to
the theatre, without making any secret of the matter. I doubt
whether any other member of the Club would have dared to be so
outspoken or so unconventional, or could have been so with such
impunity.</p>

<p>While she was luxuriating in these metropolitan activities it
must not be supposed that troubles were absent. They could never be
long absent from one of her equally adventurous and sensitive
temper. Her health, indeed, was fortified by various beneficial
courses of treatment. But the efflorescent excitement of her life
was compensated by an underlying sombreness of outlook, a deeper
grip of the fundamental tragic verities of life and death. This
largely dated from an episode which belonged to the early part of
this period.</p>

<p>Her successive intimate relationships with women usually ran a
fairly natural course. If they once or twice ended in
disappointment, it was an end in which she acquiesced, an end which
was merged in ordinary friendship. A strong compelling attachment
had never drawn her to a person who failed to respond. That,
however, was what now happened. A woman of high character and
considerable distinction as a doctor fascinated Edith's love and
seemed at first to respond to that love in the same spirit. But she
quickly realised that there was in it what she felt to be an
abnormal element alien to her own nature and traditions, and became
cold to all further advances. Gradually a genuine ordinary
friendship grew up between them of precious quality with, on
Edith's side, a beautiful element in it of affectionate
tenderness.*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* The friend died, unmarried, a few years
after Edith, still in early middle life.]</p>

<p>But meanwhile for many months&mdash;most of the time in
Cornwall&mdash;Edith passed through a period of almost melancholic
depression and desolation, constantly apt to brood over the love
she had missed, or seeking how she might gain it. I had never
before seen her in this mental state, since it was unlike the
natural grief and dejection over the death of Lily. Doubtless it
was some relief to her that my sympathetic ears, to which she ever
simply and spontaneously at once brought every trouble, were near
her at this time, though there was little help I could give. As I
look back it seems to me that the state into which she had thus
fallen was an early manifestation of the more serious state of
cyclothymic depression which more or less clouded her intelligence
in the last winter of her life. But this time the cloud passed when
her trouble was resolved by its transformation into a calm and
mutual friendship.</p>

<p>It was during this period that she wrote most of the stories,
all more or less coloured by the thought of Death, collected under
the title of <i>The Imperishable Wing,</i> a title I had suggested
from Rossetti's line&mdash;"The Wind of Death's Imperishable Wing."
These mostly sombre stories never became so popular as the earlier
collection, <i>My Cornish Neighbours,</i> but they bore witness to
a real advance in art. There is a deeper insight, a firmer touch, a
more virile grasp of the last essential verities of life, and while
the humour is less gay and reckless it is more finely subdued to
the ends of art, and attains at times an almost Shakespearian
quality in its nearness to tragedy. In one of these stories,
scarcely one of the best, "Clouds," she symbolised her own state
during this period of dejection, but transmuting her emotion, as
she was always able to do, into art, and embodying it, as her way
was, in a masculine form. It was, I believe, the same episode in
her life that partly inspired another of her writings of about the
same date (included in 'shill's privately printed posthumous volume
of her <i>Stories</i>), <i>Heaven's Jester, or the Message of the
White Rose</i>, though there is also in it the influence of Lily.
In form and style it shows that she had begun to be interested in
Oscar Wilde's prose stories. It is unlike anything else she wrote;
its interpretation was not quite clear to me, and, as ever, I never
asked her to explain it, though it is a beautiful and intimate
thing. "Heaven's Jester," I gathered&mdash;for I do not remember
that she ever told me so&mdash;was a name Lily had playfully given
her, or, as she put it, so inscribed in the register of Heaven, and
thus given her the part she was henceforth to play on earth.</p>

<p>In this poignant legend she expresses, once and for all, her
love and reverent worship for women, body and spirit, and the
melancholy underlying the gaiety with which she could shake her cap
and bells, an attitude associated with Lily's death, "Thy soul,
after her passing from earth, had barely gained thy body again
before the cap and bells were donned by thee;" that is to say it
was just after Lily's death that her humour matured and that she
wrote My <i>Cornish Neighbours.</i> The Jester is represented as
giving his cap and bells to a deformed beggar who had asked for
them, and his precious instruments to his coldhearted lady who
could draw no music from them, and in the morning he is found dead
with the faded petals of the white rose she had given him on his
breast, "Maker of men," he had prayed, "pour into a Fool's heart
the understanding of higher joy and pain. Make my spirit at one
with the great order." She had written, or completed, <i>Heaven's
Jester</i> when on a visit to Normandy with an earlier friend of
Lily's in August of 1910, and I imagine that it may have been that
companionship which made more vivid to her the nature of her
relationship to Lily and helped to inspire <i>Heaven's Jester,</i>
"When Death claims thee, and thy cap and bells are laid aside,
God's Jester shall sleep with a white rose on his breast. 'Dead,'
they will say, but not At last thou shalt hear the eternal song of
the souls of women and be satisfied." There is, however, more in
<i>Heaven's Jester</i> than an allegory of her love of women. On
every page it contains in brief sentences some statement of her
deeper experiences and beliefs concerning Life and Love and Death.
As I now read and re-read this little allegory it seems to embody
the only statement she ever made of her own secret feelings
concerning her nature and function as an artist. "Nothing can take
from me what the sun made of me through his shining," the white
rose says to the Fool. "Even as I die the fragrance remains.
Nothing can rob thee of the hours when all things seemed possible
because of thy hopes and her vows. Love is pain, but over-love is
peace. Turn thy tears into help and pity for those who dwell in
dungeons and are not yet registered in Heaven as wise or
foolish...On thy knees, then, and pray for strength and courage,
with thy cap and bells in readiness by thy side, and joy within thy
heart."</p>

<p><i>Heaven's Jester</i> is so intimately personal and impressive
that I now lovingly seek to penetrate its meaning. But when she
gave it to me to read for the first time, the impartial criticism
with which I always read her work the first time&mdash;and it was
so she desired me to read it&mdash;led me to form a not altogether
favourable opinion. I thought that, notwithstanding its beauty, it
was a little obscure and imperfectly achieved. That seems to have
been the judgment also of the editors to whom it was successively
submitted, only to be rejected. It was not published until Edith
visited America, when it appeared in <i>The Little Review</i> in
1914. Before that date she had written another paper, "The
Philosophy of Happiness," more simple and direct in form, if less
intimately personal, which was a final statement of much she had
sought to set down in <i>Heaven's Jester,</i> and is quite free
from the melancholy which fills <i>Heaven's Jester.</i> "The
Philosophy of Happiness"&mdash;which was published in the English
<i>Everyman</i> and the American <i>Forum</i>&mdash;as well as
sometimes given as a lecture&mdash;was perhaps Edith's best piece
of prose and certainly the most mature and the most serene
statement of her experiences of life.</p>

<p>Before leaving <i>The Imperishable Wing</i>, I may refer to a
story in it called "The Idealist." It is notable as the only story
Edith ever wrote dealing with the problem of inversion, and the
tragedy of the invert's position in the world. Yet on the surface
it contains not the faintest reference to inversion. With her
artist's instinct she transformed the situation; she merged this
special problem in the general problem of the abnormal and
symbolised it in another anomaly of which she had only an
imaginative insight, making her hero&mdash;clearly suggested by a
local ne'er-do-well of her acquaintance famed for the zest and
skill with which he discovered the bodies of the drowned&mdash;a
fisherman with a kind of necrophilic attraction to corpses. So she
transformed her deep feelings on this problem into a little work of
art. The transformation was not the result of timidity. She also
vaguely planned, or sometimes talked to me about, a long novel
which was to deal more openly with the same subject. Had she lived
I have little doubt this scheme would have matured. She was slow in
approaching a subject, but when she had fully come up to it and
grappled with it and mastered it she never lacked courage to
declare what she had found. During twenty years in which this
problem had been more or less clearly present to her she had never
written about it or discussed it with strangers, but now at length
her mind was made up. At the same time that she wrote "The
Idealist" she was also preparing two lectures, sometimes more or
less combined in one&mdash;"Eugenics and Spiritual Parenthood,"
"Abnormality and the Spiritual Outlook"&mdash;in which she set
forth paths of useful social activity and high spiritual function
which remain open to the invert notwithstanding all his
disabilities. She was thus able to help many who suffered from
homosexual disabilities, though doubtless there were others whom
her attitude and her plain-speaking shocked. The first time she
gave one of these lectures was to the Eugenics Education Society
(later the Eugenics Society), but they never again invited her to
lecture. She delivered the lectures, however, on various occasions,
both in England and America. It was at this period that with her
growing maturity of outlook and increased confidence she became
more impressive than ever before in personal intercourse. This was
felt even by those who made no demand for sympathy or help. A woman
friend, a fine artist of recognised ability, who had known her from
her teens though not intimately, has attempted to describe this
impression in a letter I received but a day or two ago: "One
couldn't analyse the attraction&mdash;it was just the radiation of
her personality, not what she said but just the absence of
barriers. One has to climb so hard to get over the walls with most
people&mdash;but she was just <i>there</i>. It is impossible to
forget her." Her intimate personality had, with the slow progress
of her development and the ripening of her experience, became more
and more expressed in all her activities, public and private. She
was already a good lecturer and speaker when I first knew her,
exerting influence by the persuasive power of her personality and
speech, by no means only on cultured people, for she was able to
arouse real enthusiasm among the working-class audiences she
addressed in early years in the north at Ancoats. But she was
constantly making herself a better speaker. As she had never learnt
ejocution, practised speakers were puzzled at her method of voice
production and its success. They were simple and natural methods,
and, with her beautiful ringing honest voice, the expression of her
whole personality. On the platform, as everywhere else, she sought
to do her best, to dress and look her best, to speak as well as she
could, simply, with conviction, persuasively. For many years she
carefully practised her lectures beforehand in private, and spoke
with the paper before her even when she almost knew the lecture by
heart. She had no flights of eloquence, but the slow, grave,
simple, convinced tones with which she uttered the things that
seemed to her the most worth while in life were more impressive
than any arts of the orator. With growing experience she attained
greater freedom and, except for her more important lectures, she
learnt to speak without notes, especially at formal dinners as of
the Lyceum Club, and here she seems to have achieved much success,
so that her help was frequently sought. She was always nervous
beforehand, though all her special qualities of temperament and
training fitted her for this part.</p>

<p>But the same qualities came out just as vividly in her personal
private life, where I was myself best able to know them. They came
out not only in her ready wit and quick repartee, in her swift
impulse of helpfulness towards everyone who seemed to need help
wherever she might be, but in every spontaneous gesture. Her
movements responded unconsciously and immediately to her emotion.
Well I remember how it would happen during the latter years that,
perhaps recovering from an illness, when some dear friend, woman or
man, would enter the door, she would sit up in bed, fling wide her
extended arms as in the instinctive first movement of an embrace,
perhaps without a word, with an eager expression I cannot describe,
but can never forget. Nothing could be more natural, more
beautiful, more pathetic. Her whole organism was the expression of
herself.</p>

<p>The appreciation in which she was held by the members of the
Lyceum Club, of which she was so active a member, well came out on
an occasion (zoth July, 1912) when she invited the whole of the
members of the Club Poetry Circle, with which she was specially
associated, to spend the day at West Drayton. They formed a large
party, not entirely confined to members of the Club. It was the
only occasion on which she ever invited a large party to our house,
not merely because of my dislike of such functions, but because,
sociable as she was, she preferred at most two or three friends at
a time. The member of this party I was most pleased to greet was
Henry W. Nevinson, the only time I have met him, a man for whom I
have a high regard, while on his side he has frequently written of
my work with sympathetic admiration. It was he indeed at a much
later date who was to preside at a dinner to be given in my honour
in celebration of my seventieth birthday. But such functions are
not to my taste and I declined the honour. On this occasion at West
Drayton my part was subordinate, and I was able to realise the
affection and admiration felt for Edith. It was clearly expressed
afterwards in various poems written in description of the visit and
notably one by Miss Close too long to reproduce but charmingly
telling of the hostess's "right royal welcome," adding that it was
"echoed by the Philosopher within," of Edith's familiarity with the
pigeons, and of the "loaded boards" in the lovely cottage that
"groaned" 'neath the bounteous cheer and sparkling wine.</p>

<p>It was during those years that most of my associations of her
with London were formed. During the earlier years we had seldom
been in London together except to pass through. The times I had
spent in London were usually the times when she was most busily
occupied in Cornwall, and when she came to London it was generally
my part to keep watch at Carbis. But now during these years in
London, even though we were often living under separate roofs,
there were constant and sometimes daily meetings appointed at
places that might suit the convenience of one or other of
us&mdash;at railway stations, at restaurants, at concerts, at the
British Museum Reading Room. Railway stations, especially, were
always peculiarly associated with her, for during our life together
it was constantly my part on her numerous excursions to see her off
or to meet her on her return, and, especially during the later
years, to go up to town with her, when we would separate for the
day or longer and meet again at the station for the return journey
to our country home, I nearly always arriving first at the station,
but she never failing to appear at least a minute or two before the
train was due to leave. There grew indeed to be countless other
places where we would meet or visit together, scattered about the
main throughfares of London. Whenever nowadays I go about London on
my business or my recreation I constantly come upon them: here she
stood; here we met; here we once sat together; just as, even in
places where she never went, I come upon some object, however
trifling, which leads, by a tenuous thread of suggestion, to her.
So that it sometimes seems to me that at every step of my feet and
at every movement of my thought I see before me something which
speaks of her, and my heart grows suddenly tender and my lips
murmur involuntarily: "My Darling!" Thus the streets of London,
even when I walk them carelessly beside some unheeding friend, have
a new poignancy to me, sometimes "Stations of the Cross" on the way
to Calvary, sometimes the starry arch of a Milky Way.</p>

<p>A frequent meeting-place at this time was the Down Street Tube
Station, just round the corner from the Lyceum Club in Piccadilly.
Knowing my unsociable dislike of coming to the Club she had
thoughtfully fixed this conveniently near but retired spot, where
we could meet to go together for lunch or dinner, or just to see
each other for a brief space and talk over any plans of mutual
interest. But of all our meetings here, which her bright presence
made starry, the one meeting which stands out in memory makes of
that obscure little station a Station of the Cross on the way to
her and my Calvary. For it was here one autumn day in 1913 that she
came to tell me that she had just been found to be affected by the
disease that was in a few years to kill her. Some years earlier she
had insured her life for £200 and, in spite of her heart trouble,
our good medical friends at St. Ives, and even the Insurance
Company's medical examiner, took a cheerful view of her health, a
justified view indeed since the cardiac conditions improved. That
£200 was pledged to cover a loan in case of her death. Now she
wished to repeat this performance, for there was again another loan
and a large bill for a special course of medical treatment, into
which she had slipped without quite realising what it involved and
felt that she must pay off even if it meant another loan. The sum
was far too large for me to advance, and hence the scheme of the
insurance to serve as security. But medical examination revealed
the presence of glycosuria, possibly a permanent diabetes, with the
impossibility of effecting an insurance on her life, and it was
this discoveryy just made, that she imparted to me with a grave
face that evening when we met in Down Street. Long and long we
slowly paced in serious communion up and down that little street,
surveying the new aspect of our future lives thus suddenly
revealed, for there had been so far not the slightest symptom in
her general health to indicate the disease. At her age, as she
knew, it was not speedily or necessarily fatal, as it would have
been in a younger person. It was a disease in her family, however,
and she knew its serious character, though never taking
it&mdash;for that was not her way&mdash;too seriously, adopting the
dietetic treatment at that time regarded as necessary so far as
seemed practicable, but not with punctilious rigidity, while the
medical aspects of the disease became to me a subject of acutely
painful interest. It was not, I may remark, until just after
Edith's death that the discovery of the insulin treatment made so
great a change in the diabetic patient's outlook.</p>

<p>As I look back, it seems to me that from that time dated a new
and more realised depth of tenderness in our love for each other.
That is not to imply that love had grown cold. On the contrary,
during all these middle years we had been growing closer in
communion, there had long ceased to be any serious shadow of
disturbance over the harmony of our lives together, and even our
absences&mdash;though these had never been due to any desire for
separation&mdash;had become very brief, however frequent, as they
remained till the end, except for her visits to America. But this
very smoothness of our lives in all essentials may have diminished
the need for the expression of love. It is a curious fact that
about this time&mdash;though, it must be said, about a year before,
and not after, the discovery of the glycosuria&mdash;after having
by a common and unrevealed impulse failed to preserve each other's
letters for so many years, each of us, still unknown to the other,
began to preserve letters again and so continued until almost the
end. I can only suppose that we found that they were now better
worth keeping. She realised more than before that she might soon
have to leave me; I, who had long felt the shadow of her loss in
front, now knew that there was a more definite reason than before
to justify that feeling.</p>

<p>I have been telling nothing of our varied external movements.
But from 1912 I can record some of them from her own letters. In
that year while we still possessed the Drayton cottage Edith, after
having for several years shared with me the rent of the Brixton
flat, began to feel that, in a state of health which demanded a
long course of treatment in Central London, the strain of
travelling to and from Brixton was too great, while she also became
a little prejudiced against the flat since she had discovered
(which I had not) a slaughter-house concealed close by, having on
one occasion heard the cries of animals in the early morning, after
which she constantly imagined that she could hear them as she lay
in bed. She wrote to me from Drayton in August: "My darling Boy,
the awful woe lifted a bit when I got home and found your sweet
letters. I had felt you needed me no more and I felt I <i>must</i>
die. I was very ill all Friday and when I got to the Ranee's [the
Ranee of Sarawak] she poured champagne down me. You see it is a
whirl and readjustment for me as well as you and such thousands of
things to see to. The tenants have fled from Rose Cottage, say it
is damp and stuffy. I shall have to go down when I get from here.
Will you care to come with me? I thought everything over when I was
at the Ranee's (I only just got home when I sent you wire) and came
to the conclusion I could only be an awful strain on you and not
feel free either, and with the slaughter-house and the long
distance I made up my mind to ask Jensen to have me as a tenant,
and have taken a large and lovely unfurnished room at the top of
the house for £50 a year. It has gas fire, electric light and all I
could ever want in the world. I told J. that as I was having
treatment and must be near my Club, and as you and I <i>had</i> to
be quiet and unstrained, conventions must go to the winds. You see
he has others there as tenants, so I don't see it is so unusual.
I'm dead beat and D. and A. came to-day. C. goes tonight, so I
shall be alone when you come. I love you ever&mdash;nothing and no
one could ever replace you. When I got your dear letters I felt
steel and iron had been cut from my heart. We are <i>both</i>
strange and trying folk, but we love one another and under this new
arrangement we shall meet and love in peace. Jensen does not mind
my having my cat a bit. Your own loving Wifie." One feels in this
letter, as in some others of the same period, a certain
over-excitability of strain and nervous exhaustion in an enfeebled
state of health. Her varied mental, emotional, and physical
activities, her vivid interests, her consuming energies could not
be restrained, especially in the feverish atmosphere of London
where she now felt her life mainly to be&mdash;but they were often
more than her constitution could well bear. The seeds of the
diabetic poison were being planted.</p>

<p>I do not think it could have been prevented. The long seclusion
of Cornwall had been highly favourable to her development. But she
had exhausted the possibilities. She hungered for a full
environment in which to expand her new powers. Excess of energy,
both physical and spiritual, was in her temperament. She responded
to all the stimuli of a rich social atmosphere, not taking her
colour from it but, rather, giving it her colour. "The Road of
Excess leads to the Palace of Wisdom," said Blake. I do not deny
it, but it is a dangerous road, and if the only road, I, at all
events, shall never reach that Palace. My instinctive tendency has
always been to temperance as hers was to excess. If she drank two
glasses of wine when exhausted and felt better, she would propose
to drink a third glass. I also found two glasses good, but I knew
by experience that two are more than three, and had not even a
desire for the third. I claim no moral superiority; our differing
instincts were matters of temperament and heredity. At the same
time her instinct of excess never led her into any vice. There also
she was safeguarded, perhaps, by instinct, and certainly by deep
conviction.</p>

<p>I went down to Cornwall with her in September as she had
proposed, and we stayed there peaceably nearly three weeks. On the
day after our return to London she wrote to me from Harley Street:
"Oh! my Boy! This strange world after Carbis! I've never regretted
leaving anywhere so much. I miss you horribly. Now isn't that
strange? But it is true. I will be at the Queen's Hall entrance
to-morrow and will get the tickets this morning on my way to the
Club. Have tea with me after as I've heaps to tell you.
Havelock&mdash;I think it is <i>because</i> I love you that I get
so frenzied, or else I'm best dead. I seem never to have had quiet
for years and last night what passed between J. and me made me feel
dreadful. I got a horrid pain in my heart and felt I must run back
to Cornwall. Of course by this morninig I just feel nothing and
realise that he is strained. But I will tell you when I see you. I
feel I want to see you so badly and to kiss you well after my
jig-jags. Please try and help me not to be like that. It is your
<i>apparent</i> callousness to me sometimes that makes me want to
put pins in you. Anyhow, of one thing I am sure and that is that I
love you and love you more than you can guess."</p>

<p>She was no doubt right about that appearance of callousness. I
have always been conscious of it. Thirty years afterwards, in my
later life, I suspect it may be that same "apparent callousness"
that has sometimes made it difficult for my dear Françoise to
realise how much I love her. Partly it is that my affections tend
to be deep and equable and calm; when love is established it never
occurs to me either to give or to ask any declarations of love,
while for Edith (as perhaps for women generally) love never seemed
sure without visible proof, it might vanish at any moment, so that
the continual evidence of its existence was necessary, and its
realisation an ever fresh, vivid, and joyful experience. Partly,
also, I am not demonstrative even when the sense of love is urgent,
and I feel an instinctive and unconquerable repugnance to furnish
any expected and, as it were, conventional response. At such times
it seems to me that silence is more than all speech. Priscilla,
with whom I had something in common, when once charged with
indifference, replied: "One is always saying 'Thank you' for
trifles, so how can one say 'Thank you' for real things?" Edith at
least knew how I felt, and in writing of me she recalled a saying
of mine to the effect that I wished I had a tail like a dog that I
could wag. But, all the same, it was something that she craved and
missed.</p>

<p>Two days later Edith wrote to me from Harley Street to Clare,
where I was spending a day or two near Amy: "Your dear letter just
come. I went to the theatre alone; saw the Lawrences there and the
Ranee, etc. Came home and made cocoa, and my cats loved me, and I
slept almost philosophically and woke quite so. Wrote a short
letter to <i>Chronicle</i> on play, and about twenty others, and am
going to have my breakfast and bath and then to Drayton and dining
with Miss C. to-night at Kensington. Do have a good time with Amy
and tell her to love you up and comfort you. I wish I could but I
seem no good to anyone really. Be prepared to settle down in
Drayton on 21st. It will be very nice and I shall just take a
first-class season again in the cold weather. Much tender and
lasting love from your Wifie."</p>

<p>We went down to Drayton together for our last winter there. We
had, indeed; completely given up the place, but returned by the
kind proposal of the new proprietor. She had gone to India and
suggested that we should occupy Oldmeadows (as she had re-named the
place since Americans regard the woodpecker as unlucky) to look
after it during her absence. Except that it was winter, so that we
could not live out-of-doors under the big walnut tree, this was
probably the pleasantest part of our whole occupation. The place
had been much improved and made more luxurious since we left, while
we were relieved of the burden of anxiety and responsibility which
the undertaking had placed upon us, and Edith no longer felt called
upon (as she sometimes had during our tenancy) to invite some
friend or acquaintance to stay as a paying guest. In November she
went down to Carbis with a friend, Mrs. M., for a week or so to put
Rose Cottage in order for new tenants, leaving me at Drayton.
Thence she wrote:</p>

<p class="quote">"My darling Boy, I'm in heaven&mdash;the glorious
sea and sky and clouds as never anywhere but here. I'm trying to
knock Mrs. M.'s ethics into a cocked hat. Don't expect
letters&mdash;I want to read and dream and forget pens and
paper."</p>

<p>But the Cornish climate is capricious. Two days later she
wrote:</p>

<p class="quote">"The sight of your writing this morning almost
made me weep. I had a fearful dream and woke at two unable to sleep
again. I dreamt you were dead. I felt I should have to get out in
the drenching rain and wind and come to you. Then I fell asleep at
five and dreamt that Beryl [the actress friend who induced her to
take Woodpecker and had since died] was there and said: 'Curls, we
shall soon be together again.' It is cold and stormy and terribly
wet here now...I hate you to be lonely and of course you must not
stay there if you hate it. My eternal love to you. W."</p>

<p>It is a perpetual source of amusement and wonder to me to think
how from the first, separately and together, she and I had
cherished ideals of freedom and independence, both in theory and in
practice, and cast contempt on the narrow self-absorption of
domestic love, and, as it would seem, had done everything to make
such love difficult or even impossible. And yet the love we
achieved during a quarter of a century seems to lie beyond even the
imagination of those conventional couples who proclaim the duty end
the beauty of mutual devotion, never leave each other's side,
loathe the ideals of freedom and independence&mdash;and in their
hearts loathe each other. Just after writing that letter Edith
foolishly took a long walk while the gale was still raging, to
please the friend staying with her, and with consequences that
might be anticipated. "My Darling One," she wrote two days later,
"I've had a very severe angina attack but slept at last last night
and am staying in bed all day; so I shall be <i>quite</i> well
to-morrow; no lung trouble. Thank God you love me&mdash;I love you
and know that neither of us could live long without one
another...Dr. Rice came in yesterday, says I had better stay in bed
to-day and sees I know myself best. All are quite kind and good and
my room is sweet. Don't worry <i>a bit</i>&mdash;you know I always
come out all right. No sun here&mdash;only shrieking wind and
fearful rain and hail at intervals. You would have hated it if you
had been here. Bless you, your own wifie."</p>

<p>"I know that neither of us could live long without one another."
I had forgotten she said it, yet I have always known that, in a
sense, it is true. That she had found me was from the outset, I
knew, beneath all her turbulent independence and deep reserve and
playful mischief and agitating moods, and at times something that
was almost contempt&mdash;it was always, I knew, though not in her
nature to say so, nothing less than a miracle. The realisation of
it remained unobliterated even in the final decay of body and mind.
No one could take, in the smallest part, my place; she could not
admit more than one person to the inmost springs of her being. (I
recall how when she would speak of what I would or should do after
her death I once said I hoped I would die first and she replied,
gravely and quietly, that that was selfish.) I felt as I watched
her dying and saw, after an interval, her last sighing breath
softly rise and fall away for ever, that life for me was over. I
might go on living, cheerful and content, working more assiduously
than ever, always ready to help when my help was needed, even
loving and beloved, yet realising, perhaps rather sadly, that there
was little I any longer really needed. The whole world seemed an
insubstantial and evanescent dream. My thoughts were instinctively
with Prospero on his island. I might not be a magician&mdash;though
that is what a dear friend, who was also her friend, likes to call
me&mdash;but Prospero's vision of the world was becoming my
vision.</p>

<p>I felt that my real life had come to an end. And in a sense it
was true. My main life-work had been completed at her side and with
her constant support. I saw nothing that greatly mattered awaiting
me in the future. But for me also a miracle was possible. Gradually
in my slowly developing emotional life it was achieved. For I have
of late always felt that, while the memory of all that Edith meant
is for ever alive within me&mdash;even to-day almost to a day
twenty-two years after her death&mdash;the years I have since spent
with my dear Françoise, who so often recalls to me Edith, are
nothing less than a miracle, for they include the years of most
unalloyed happiness I have ever known.</p>

<p>To resume. In a few days Edith was back with me at West Drayton,
and for some months there were no letters, since I never cared to
leave home in winter, except for a day or two in town about once a
week, and she had no further occasion to go away except for
frequent long days in town. We often went up together, separating
on arrival in London, though we would sometimes meet again during
the day, and it is noted in my pocket diary that, on the 12th of
February, 1913, repeating the experience of more than twenty years
earlier, we went together to hear Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. On
the 31st of March we finally left Woodpecker, and during the summer
Edith's headquarters were at the Harley Street room and mine at the
flat, where she also came occasionally to sleep, though meetings in
town were easy and frequent. Early in the summer Edith went with a
dear friend to spend a fortnight at Bruges and Ostend. "My darling
Boy," she wrote from the Hotel Marion at Ostend, "I am really
having a wonderful time of rest and peace and loveliness. This air
is superb and we all three get on splendidly and are already
planning heaps of tours in Spain and Italy and all sorts together.
I'm sleeping beautifully, drinking beer, and feeling cold water
paradise as in Spain. I wish you were here. I love you more and
more, and my hopes are you will soon have a long rest too."</p>

<p>She found rest and peace at last. When I go to that quiet garden
at Golders Green, over which her ashes were scattered, and sit in
silence&mdash;as she would sit by Lily's grave and come back
refreshed and would surely so have sat by mine&mdash;while the
laburnums let fall their gold and the hawthorns are covered with
their thick rich pink blossoms and the roses begin to burst their
buds and the birds gently sing, my heart too is at rest. For I know
it would please her well that all of her that was mortal should
rise again into this life of peace,</p>

<p class="poem">"Where, like an infant's smile, over the dew,<br>
A light of laughing flowers along the grass is spread."</p>

<p>She went on to Lausanne for a short time to stay with an old
friend there. It proved to be, little as she guessed it, her last
Visit to the Continent. Soon after her return I went on what may
perhaps have been the last of my numerous visits to Spain and I
well remember Edith coming to see me off at Victoria Station and
expressing approval, rare from her, of the new light tourist suit I
was wearing. That suit was perhaps not auspicious, and this tour
was altogether the least happy of all my visits to Spain. I started
happily, indeed, on a day of exquisite loveliness and spent the
night in Paris, leaving for Spain the following morning. On
reaching Toulouse I felt so fresh and eager that I determined not
to waste the night there but to push on to Barcelona by the train
that left a few hours later. Part of the time I occupied over a
good dinner in the excellent and handsome station restaurant, and
walked up and down the platform until the train was due. Evidently
I gave the impression of a foolish and well-to-do English tourist,
for as I climbed up into the carriage a youth pushed in front of
me, turned round facing me and called out: "Où est l'homme avéc le
bagage?" while behind me an elderly man pressed on, with: "Passez,
monsieur, passez!" Then they vanished, I gave them no thought and
settled down comfortably and semisomnolently, after my good dinner,
into a corner seat. It was not until I entered my room at the
familiar Barcelona hotel that I found that my
pocket-book&mdash;entirely my own unusual negligence, for tailors
had not yet adopted the useful practice of furnishing the breast
pocket with a button&mdash;had disappeared, and then I recalled the
significance of the unremarked incident at Toulouse. I record this
as the only episode of the kind that has ever happened to me during
all my wanderings. It deprived me of part of the money I had
brought for my holiday, together with various precious little
objects that were of far more concern to me, and, though I seek to
worry as little as possible over the irreparable, it spoilt the
charm of my holiday at the outset. Barcelona, also, I found, had
changed since I was there last, and grown more commonplace. A wave
of municipal reform had passed over it, shortly before my arrival,
for the correction of what was regarded as license. The free and
racy spirit of the soil had been banished from its amusements
leaving a tame vacuity only too familiar at home. I left Barcelona
to spend a day or two at Ripoll, and then by the road to France
over the Pyrénées I had long promised myself the pleasure of
traversing, and found it full of delight. Hence I went slowly on to
the French Catalan city of Perpignan, a revelation to me more than
twenty years previously and now at length revisited. As I wandered
about its streets reviving old memories I became conscious that I
was feeling out of sorts, so I sat down outside a café and ordered
a vermouth, my usual resort in a foreign city under such
circumstances. But no refreshing effect followed and, being a
fairly good judge of the significance of my own sensations, I
realised I was in a state of fever. Returning to the hotel I found
I had a temperature of 102° and that, for the first time in my life
when alone and far from home, I had fallen ill. What exactly was
the matter I could not be certain though later I came to the
conclusion that I had been attacked by the intestinal form of
influenza. It was naturally aggravated by the conditions and the
impossibility of resting in peace. I could scarcely touch the
elaborate hotel meals, and the simple dishes I sought to order
instead could not be provided. My mind remained receptive, and I
was never prostrated; I was able to spend part of the time
wandering about the new cities I visited on my slow and painful
progress towards home&mdash;such notes as I wrote have their place
in my <i>Impressions and Comments</i>&mdash;but during all those
days my life was a nightmare. I had planned to meet Amy at
Granville for a week's tour in Normandy, and at the appointed date
I was able to be there on the quay to receive her. But for several
days longer my condition remained the same, with an inevitable
consequent exhaustion. The turning point occurred at Etretat. It
was the first place I had reached at all touched by the sometimes
despised English influence, and as we passed along one of its
streets I spied an attractive little shop where "English Tea" was
announced. We entered the cosy deserted little room. I have never
anywhere, even in Moscow, found tea, or indeed any other beverage,
so delicious. It seemed a real elixir of life. I came out feeling
strong and cheerful, and before long appetite began to come back.
When we reached England I was almost my normal self again.</p>

<p>Even this is not the whole story of this accumulation of little
misadventures. Directly after seeing me off Edith had sent a card
to my hotel at Barcelona: "My heart misgave me as I saw you go. I
would have given <i>anything</i> to be going with you. Do take
care...I am <i>really</i> with you in heart if not in body." It was
a premonition of living insight, but two or three days before I
fell ill in Perpignan she also was attacked in London by precisely
the same kind of illness, aggravated by anxiety when she heard from
me of my illness, though she was relieved to know that Amy would
soon be with me. She was in the midst of the turmoil of moving from
Harley Street and the final misadventure of this series occurred
when, in the course of dealing with my correspondence while I was
abroad, amid this outer disorder and mental confusion of illness
she was unable to account for a cheque sent from America, on which
I had been relying. She felt sure she had put it in a "safe place,"
and was more distressed than I was at her inability to find it,
"the one thing I have failed you in," she wrote, and it was her
high pride never to fail in the tasks of love. However, that final
mischance of this unfortunate holiday was put right when we
discovered that she had by oversight returned the cheque to America
with the receipt. To console me, so far as possible, for the loss
of my pocket-book with its precious souvenirs, she now gave me
another, inserting into it a little card on which she had written:
"To my precious Comrade and Boy and all sorts of other people a
life of twenty-two years together." Now that pocket book will have
its place among my sacred possessions together with the last
similar pocket-book my mother also gave me not long before her
death.</p>

<p>I have detailed this accumulation of petty troubles around my
last visit to Spain because they were unique and present a contrast
to the otherwise delightful series of my visits to foreign lands.
For a time the charm seemed broken; and in fact I have never
planned another visit to Spain. But, as I could not know when I
first wrote this record, to France&mdash;at all events, Touraine
and the Pyrénées and the Riviera&mdash;other expeditions as
delightful as any that went before still lay ahead in the lovely
society of my Françoise.</p>

<p>Edith had been spending an active, agitated and worried time; it
was under such circumstances that she often succumbed to illness.
She was preparing to make a new turn in life: "I am resigning all
Committees (at the Lyceum Club), even the Poetry, so that I can at
last live as an artist." She was giving up her room in Harley
Street and setting up a tiny cottage in a friend's grounds at
Stanwell; she was winding up all sorts of affairs, with the
inevitable result that she was encountering all sorts of urgent
expenses which she was unable to meet. This spurred on her literary
activities and led to still further overwork. At the same time she
was actively organising a big Swinburne memorial dinner wherewith
to end up her more prominent functions in the Lyceum Club. It was
in the midst of this whirl that she was knocked over by the
influenza attack so strangely like mine. Before hearing of mine she
wrote to me at the Normandy address I had given her on the 28th of
June, which happened to be one of my worst days at Nantes, though
she had not yet heard of my illness. "My Darling One, I am very
ill. Cannot get right at all&mdash;somehow. Heart worse than it has
ever been in a way, and had fever, and have been in hell. I'm
wretchedly weak and sleepless. Don't come home as I may pull round,
but I feel the smash up I have dreaded for years has come at last.
It is the Swinburne Dinner on Monday and Heaven knows what will
happen. Try not to let it spoil your holiday, but God only knows
what it will be to see you again. Letters are pouring in for you
and I don't feel fit to cope with them for my own are beyond me. I
dread it all&mdash;and if I die I shall leave all in confusion and
what can I do? I may be better and could not bear you to come home
for me." Two days later the Swinburne dinner took place and her
spirit was equal to the occasion as it always was; then, two days
later, after hearing that I also was ill, she wrote: "My Darling
One, I've been in an awful state of agitation about you. I felt you
were very ill and I have been too&mdash;could digest nothing for
days. However, the rest at Granny's [an old friend, Mrs. Fowke] did
the trick to a certain extent and though I <i>felt</i> very
indequate everyone said I was wonderful. It was a magnificent
evening. I sat between Robert Ross [Oscar Wilde's literary
executor] and Lord Dunsany. The latter I just loved. He took a huge
fancy toand I thought as they stood together&mdash;he towering over
her&mdash;what a marriage it might have been. He is a real poet and
such a dear, and he liked me too. Such a child! I never got to bed
till three, but, do you know, at the end of the dinner they all
rose with one accord and said what a dear I was and sang 'He's a
jolly good fellow' till I thought the roof would come off. I nearly
cried and could only say 'Ohl you dears!' Right and left I was told
of my <i>charm!</i> and May Sinclair was so nice to me...To-day and
to-morrow I pack up and put everything in the Stanwell cottage till
I leave. Rest is my one craving. Do take care and tell me how you
are and when you come home. If before the 15th I will wait for you.
I love you ever and thank God Amy is there to take care of you.
Kiss her for me."</p>

<p>I returned to London earlier than she expected, but as she
received no notice beforehand of my arrival she had already left
London, as arranged, to spend a few weeks with her dear friend of
that period. In many ways it was a good change for her but it
failed to give all the rest she desired and needed. She was still
ill, and worried over various troubles including demands for
payment of old debts (though I was helping beyond the usual
household allowance to the utmost of my ability) and she was
stimulated to literary activities beyond her strength. At the same
time she was in a social atmosphere she found trying. I quote a few
sentences from letters written when staying with her special dear
friend.</p>

<p class="quote">"My poor heart and brain are bad indeed, the
eternal frontal headache making me wonder how to go on. I've been
terribly worried all the time...It's no use upbraiding me, I should
only get desperate. These awful headaches and melancholy keep me
sleepless, and I try to hide it all from &mdash;&mdash; who gets
bored if she is not gay and I do what I can, but I feel so
strangely alone. If only you and I had a central place together or
I saw more of you in peace (not snatches of days), or I felt I
could die somewhere in peace, I should feel better, I
think&mdash;and if <i>only</i> we'd money. I've done all I can and
I'm writing <i>hard</i>, and re-writing <i>Kit's Woman</i> [in the
dramatic version]. I've written a fine new First Act and we are
going to dramatise <i>Evensong</i> as a first piece while we work
out the <i>Jester</i> play. But it all wants a clear head and
strong heart and I've neither. All this eternal chatter threatens
our peace and being weak it worries me. I miss the treatment, and
don't believe I shall ever be strong, and but for my debts want to
die badly...Oh! Havelock, my own darling one, can you tell what I
suffer? I pray you are better. Write and tell me you love me and
don't want always to be away from me. I feel that I'm not wanted
anywhere and yet I have such love. Your own Wifie who longs and
longs to see you, is so sweet but cannot realise, the darling, that
it is so difficult to work with a head like this...I feel a sort of
awful hopelessness about everything. I shall see you and that seems
the only thing that gives me life. These women roundmake me despair
and I feel I can't do anything but leave her to them, as it all
worries her so. Oh! Havelock, don't feel you don't want me. I let
myself drift into thinking you only want Amy and not me and my poor
brain is tired and suffering and worrying over money...Your letters
are like miracles. All sorts of horrors have happened here. I fell
iller than before and my heart is pretty bad. All I feel I want in
the world is to get into your arms and be told you want me to live.
Be prepared for a wire and meet me if you are able for I shall be
fit for nothing. My one great longing is to see your dear face...I
arrive at Euston at 3. I just want to go to bed and rest and rest.
It is all sad, sad, and I feel in utter despair, but surely you
will comfort me. Do love me and tell me I'm not an utterly
impossible human being as I'm beginning to think."</p>

<p>During the next nine months we were mostly together, not
separated for more than a few days at a time, so for this period
there are no letters. But those that I have quoted reveal the
strains to which she was subjected and make clear the devastation
in her health that was soon to be revealed. That happened in the
autumn, a few months later, as I have already told.</p>

<p>Our lives had, however, become more equable again, and even the
recognition of the diabetic disorder, while it caused some anxiety,
was a useful injunction to a quiet life. At the little cottage at
Stanwell, indeed, where much of our time in the late summer of 1913
was spent, we were necessarily already quiet. Stanwell is a small
Middlesex village some miles from any railway station, and the
cottage&mdash;probably the smallest of all the small dwellings we
ever occupied&mdash;was a tiny modern three-roomed building,
intended for servants, in the stableyard of a large house belonging
to friends of Edith's, who had offered to rent it to her. She had
snatched at the chance as it was at no great distance from West
Drayton, and it not only enabled her to find a convenient shelter
for herself, and her things from Harley Street, but settled a
greater dimculty by offering a comfortable home for the horse and
donkey now displaced from West Drayton. On the whole, however,
though we made the best of it, this was a makeshift arrangement not
altogether agreeable or comfortable for either of us. I expect we
were pleased when the time came to go to Cornwall, although it was
a trial to Edith to leave her animals behind, even in good hands,
and awkward to be deprived of her trap. We went to Cornwall fora
month in September, back to Stanwell and occasionally to my flat,
then to Cornwall together in November to remain there until March.
All this time we were never separated save now and then fora few
days.</p>

<p>During the autumn the dramatic version of <i>Kit's Woman</i> was
performed by one of the best Stage Societies of that day. It was
well played, received with applause, and the author called before
the curtain at the close. But one felt that the larger and more
conventional section of the audience had been puzzled and even
shocked. No manager, however friendly, was inclined to give the
play a run. Edith never realised not only that a good novel will
not necessarily make a good play but that the accepted limitations
of the stage less easily lend themselves to a writer who is
daringly and instinctively unconventional.</p>

<p>It was during this long period, when there was no occasion or
need to discuss serious questions in letters, that the idea of a
visit to the United States germed and developed in Edith's
adventurous mind. She was over fifty years of age, and though in
some respects her health had improved it was deeply undermined. Yet
her spirit was as high as ever and her energies as fresh; so,
indeed, they remained until the end. No adventure daunted her and
risks stimulated her.</p>

<p>Various factors entered the inception of the American
enterprise. Her friendship with the two American friends of Lily
had been consolidated during their visit to Europe and they had
invited her to stay with them in New York. She was beginning to
form other connections with the United States, partly through the
Lyceum Club, partly through her writings, which were bringing her
into touch with American editors and publishers. It seemed to her
that as other schemes for financial retrievement had failed to
remove money troubles, perhaps an American lecturing tour would
achieve that result, and there were many to encourage that idea.
Then, too, it seemed to her that the beloved spirit of Lily was
also waving her on in that direction; from time to time she was now
seeing a medium, of remarkable powers and high repute, able to
evoke&mdash;however the manifestations may be explained&mdash;the
seeming spirit of Lily with wonderful vividness and truth, and
messages came encouraging her to go to America and foretelling
great success there. It was true; but at what a cost the message
failed to tell. By March the scheme had taken definite shape. Some
rather vague proposals had come from America for one or two
lectures which would probably lead to more, and it was ranged that
she should sail in the early spring.</p>

<p>In preparing her lectures for this American visit the idea
occurred to her&mdash;spontaneously, I believe&mdash;to write a
lecture on Havelock Ellis. She at once proceeded to do so, I can no
longer recall where or when, but evidently about this time. I
offered no active opposition to the idea, but I scarcely liked it,
for it seemed to me rather too intimate a thing to do. When it was
completed I accepted it as satisfactory, perhaps still a little
coolly, and it was duly delivered on various occasions in the
States. Since her death, I have to confess, my attitude to that
lecture has altogether changed. Instead of being a little ashamed
of her frank discussion of my personality and career, I am
profoundly grateful to her. It is now to me among the most precious
things she ever wrote. I am for the first time able to appreciate
it, in an almost impersonal manner; I realise how discriminating,
how forbearing, how just, how manysided it is, and with how deep
and sympathetic an insight into the central parts of my nature. It
is written by the person who knew me best and longest, and nothing
that anyone else has written about me can be put beside it. She
wrote it, moreover, at the moment when we had at length reached the
summit of the long and difficult path of life we had climbed
together, and when she was herself at the point of complete
development, so that it is easy to believe that, as some think, it
is one of the best things, outside her artistic work, she ever
wrote. It was first published, after her death, in the New York
<i>Bookman</i> for July, 1918, and later (1924) appeared in the
volume of Essays by Mrs. Havelock Ellis privately printed by Joseph
Ishill at Berkeley Heights, New Jersey.</p>

<p>In January of this year 1914 my old friend Olive Schreiner had
come from South Africa to England after an absence of many years,
and I had run up from Cgrbis to London for a few days to greet her.
She had soon gone on to Italy and, undergoing a special treatment,
settled in Florence, whence she wrote complaining of her loneliness
and saying how pleasant it would be if I could come out to Italy. I
was not at that moment anxious to go, but Edith, though never eager
for me to leave her, urged that I owed it to so old and dear a
friend not to neglect her wishes. Olive in a later letter wrote:
"Dear Havelock Boy, don't come for my sake. I'm so sick and faint
all the time it will be no pleasure to you. Unless, indeed, the joy
of seeing you makes me better." I agreed to go in March. It was an
easy and pleasant tour and I never regretted it. Indeed when a few
months later the Great War unexpectedly broke out I was thankful
that I had gone.</p>

<p>I went up to London a few days before Edith, who followed and
stayed with me for a week at theflat, which she arranged to occupy
with the devoted servant Annie during my absence. Just before she
left Carbis to join me she wrote in the only letter I have for that
period since the previous summer:</p>

<p class="quote">"My darling Boy, so thankful to get your wire.
Awful gales and sheets of rain last night. I was demented with
people all day...Get in plenty of fire-wood and coal, please, and
leave us any odds you have. I've still that horrid pain but quite
normal, thank goodness. I think it is all neuralgic rundown pains
now, and that I shall be better away from here...All I've to do is
to keep alive and lecturing. It's a big thing but worth it. I hope
we won't be an awful nuisance, but it is a joy to be able to kiss
you again before you go. I feel sure you would regret it terribly
if anything happened to Olive and you had not gone, but if
<i>you</i> are not all right I shall never forgive myself either.
Now I must away to thousands of poddles.* You are deep in my
innermost heart and no man, woman, or child could ever uproot
you."</p>

<p class="footnote">[* This was her favourite word for all the
little odd necessary tasks that are outside the regular ordinary
routine of life. It seems a good word, but I do not know where she
got it from, and the dictionary affords no help; possibly it is
connected with the verb "potter."]</p>

<p>I know that that constant refrain of her letters was the
utterance of her deepest self, and whatever happened when disease
began to undermine that self, I have never ceased to know it.</p>

<p>In referring to this as the only letter written during that
period I have deliberately left out of account a special letter of
altogether unique character. From an early period she had realised
the likelihood that she would die before me and been anxious to
leave everything in order and spare me all unnecessary trouble.
With this object she wrote a letter of instructions for me to keep
at hand but only to open immediately on her death. One or more such
letters she had withdrawn as the circumstances altered, and
replaced by another. In February of this year 1914, in view of her
visit to America, when we were at Carbis Bay together she wrote the
last, inscribed "In case of my death," which she never expressed
any wish to reclaim. It remained in my pocket-book for more than
two years before the time came to read it, but I introduce it at
the time when it was written. In addition to her wishes in regard
to cremation, to instructions regarding business affairs, debts,
and souvenirs for friends, the envelope contained this letter, the
most measured and deliberate statement of her attitude towards me
and towards life. In previous years, at moments of exhaustion or
exasperation, which may or may not have been justified, she had
sometimes spoken to me bitter words which seemed to be uttered with
intense conviction. In the last year, when her mental integrity was
enfeebled by disease, she sometimes spoke, not only to me but of
me, in ways that were altogether without justification. But in this
year 1914 her mind was not only completely intact but she had at
length reached the full growth in character and intellect of her
slowly developed personality. The words she wrote at this moment in
secret, knowing that they would only reach me as a voice from the
grave, I can now read with a solemn joy which there is nothing to
impair. "My Precious Boy," the letter opens, "When you read this I
shall be in beauty and rest at last and no one is to fret a moment.
If it is possible I shall help you more than I ever could here
because of the illnesses I've had to fight. There is no death for
real love and we love one another for always. I hate to feel I've
ever been a hurt and a strain but no one can understand better than
you why this has been and why I've been such an impossible
creature&mdash;born too soon and dead too late. Just <i>try</i> to
do all the things I'm putting down on enclosed if you can. Bless
you for all the love and care you've given me always. Your own
Wifie."</p>

<p>The Italian journey was uneventful. I went direct to Florence
and joined Olive in a large dull cosmopolitan hotel, of a type I
should never have chosen myself. I found her in fair health and
spent ten days there. Then I went on alone for a few days at
Ravenna and Bologna. I had planned to stay at Rheims, Laon, and St.
Quentin, none of which cities I had seen before, on the way home.
In the end I omitted St. Quentin, for it happened, as it had often
happened to me before, that as I approached home I speeded up my
journey. I have often wished since that the intuition, if such I
may term it, which led me to visit for the first time that part of
France at that moment had drawn me to other neighbouring places
since ruined. But I am endlessly thankful that I was among the last
persons to see the original Rheims intact. The cathedral, above
all, to me singularly lovely and its windows glorious, remains
enshrined, however faintly, in my memory for ever.</p>

<p>I came back to the flat at Brixton, where Edith stayed on with
me for a week, when she had to join her boat at Southampton, the
<i>Minneapolis,</i> of the American Transport Line, with,
characteristically, only £10 in her pocket to meet expenses in
America. With tender solicitude&mdash;the tenderness of our love on
both sides was never greater than at this period&mdash;she
affectionately commended me to Amy's care, and arranged a little
code by which she could inform me by wireless on nearing New York
how she had fared...I was not accompanying her to Southampton; the
brief stay there she had reserved for the dear woman friend whom I
have before alluded to, but her last evening in London was devoted
to me. We went for dinner to one of our favourite resorts near her
Club (where she was spending the night for convenience), the
Popular Café in Piccadilly. A kind of sad exaltation filled both
our hearts and seemed to find external expression when the band
began playing Tchaikovsky's <i>Chanson sans Paroles,</i> one of the
things that Lily used to play. The beautiful memory of this time
together often came to me during the weeks that followed, and to
her also, for she referred more than once to the tender look which,
she said, then shone on my face.</p>

<p>During the two days or less that elapsed between bidding me
farewell and finally losing touch with England I had six letters
full of love and cheer and last instructions, in case she never
returned.</p>

<p class="quote">"My Sweet Boy," (she wrote) "I felt I must fling
out of the train into your dear arms...I am sure to <i>feel</i> how
you are and you must just rest on my breast and know I am ever your
Wifie...At last I've realised some of the awfulness of this
separation, but I mean to do the game&mdash;out and out. I was so
dead beat we scarcely spoke and went each to our rooms. I'd have
slept long but my cough was so bad...Do, do take care. You are more
to me than you have ever known: it is a strange world and grows
stranger day by day. I wish you were here. I see you now with your
dear eyes all gone in, getting your breakfast, but you are not
alone. I am there every inch of the way. I broke down when you'd
gone and was so thankful no one was in the carriage...At last I am
off. Such letters and wires and wonderful love, to send me, like
Whittington, to my fortune, though Annie has my cat who has now
three tabby kittens. A lovely day and I am sure, in Lily's gentle
hands, all will be well. My heart aches at going and yet I know it
is the <i>only</i> way. Even if I fail I shall have done all I can.
I trust you and Amy are closer again. I can't <i>bear</i> you to be
hurt. Just use my love and everlasting tenderness. The temper is
the mere growl of a dog too stupid to know how else to show he is
ready to die for what he loves. Soon now I'll be back." Then when
the ship <i>was</i> losing touch with England came the final
message by wire: "All well. Delicious weather. Love. Wifie."</p>

<p>Yet even that was not the end of her loving messages. She was
ever inventive in the art of loving, full of tender solicitude, not
only for me but for all who were dear to her, and on the eve of
leaving London, when spending the night at the Club, and full of
business, she found time to write three more letters which she
secretly left with her friend the Club porter to post at intervals
during the following week so that there might be little break in
her communications to me during the voyage. These letters reached
me at regular intervals with a glad surprise and they arrived in
what was evidently the order in which they were written and
intended to arrive, and yet with no apparent numbering on the
envelopes. But to-night, nearly six years after they were written,
it occurs to me to remove the stamps and I find&mdash;with an ache
of the heart at this last fresh sign of her tender care I may ever
discover&mdash;beneath each stamp, in her hand, the date when the
letter <i>was</i> to be posted, to which dates the postmarks duly
correspond. It is a little thing, but the thoughtful care behind
such little things is of the essence of the art of love, and it was
altogether characteristic of her that even at this moment of high
pressure, in the early dawn of the day of her departure, she could
not fail therein.</p>

<p>"My sweet Boy," she wrote in the first, "I shall always see your
deep-set eyes wherever I am. Somehow, after all these years, I want
to bring some of the depth and loveliness your mother brought you.
I am always with you&mdash;always loving&mdash;and it is not so
very long before I come back to you and the new home. I feel Amy
will perhaps yet be more to you than ever before. Try and put
yourself into the 'dangerous age' as you put yourself into my
tantrums. I can't bear you to not have letters so, you see, through
Pottier, I <i>can</i> get at you! This with my eternal love.
Wifie."</p>

<p>"My darling One," the second ran, "Just a wee line to cheer. By
this time I shall be just looking forward to coming home. I mean to
be victorious in all sorts of ways and understand more and more.
Take care of my precious baby for me, for that you are. All these
days of disappointment my very bowels have yearned over you. She
has not <i>meant</i> to leave you, for she loves you and she has
been a sweeter woman than I for you, and that is why I want to get
you close again. Cheer up and eat slowly and good nourishing food.
All will be well or Lily would not have told me to go. I kiss you
tenderly and love you ever. Your Wifie."</p>

<p>She was here troubled over some temporary misunderstanding with
Amy to whose care she had commended me during her absence. The "Eat
slowly" was a frequent injunction of hers, vainly, I fear, for it
was natural to me to eat quickly. It is an injunction which now,
twenty years later, comes with a sad smile, for it is no longer
needed. With a troublesome throat affliction of which I cannot see
the termination I am unable to eat except slowly.</p>

<p>The last, timed for Friday, is short: "This, my Sweet, is to
wish you a happy week-end. Get into the sun with Amy and forget all
dull and painful things and be happy, for life will be full for us
when I come home. Everything points to it. Take care, take care.
Your own Wifie. I've been writing since four to get all done."</p>

<p>And the wonder of it was that all this love and tenderness and
passion on a sea of adventures, apart or together, then and
throughout, was on both sides without, in the narrow physical
sense, any elements of sexual emotion! We neither of us thought of
that aspect of it at the time. When one loves one cannot analyse
love. But now, as I look back, I feel all the novelty and the
fascination of it as well as its instructiveness. In due course the
wireless came. It signified that all was well. From that time to
her return early in July, a little over two months later, she took
every opportunity to write, so that I have some twenty-five letters
covering the period, and can follow all her movements. Moreover, I
think for the only time in her life, she kept a private diary, in a
leather-bound volume furnished with a lock, partly for my benefit
and partly to aid her own memory. My letters to her were not
preserved, and my life during this time is almost a blank in
memory, though it has left a few traces in <i>Impressions and
Comments.</i> I was living and working quietly in my flat, never
out of London but once. That break is all that stands out from the
darkness. I went in June for a fortnight's ramble with Amy, in the
country and by the sea in East Anglia. There had been during the
earlier part of the year a cloud of misunderstanding (referred to
by Edith), almost the only one that ever arose and which soon
dispersed. This little tour at the best season of the year was
probably the most beautiful, and almost the last, that we ever
enjoyed together. She had now reached middle age and had really
begun, however late, to feel the confidence of being complete
mistress of her own actions, while I, equally late, had finally
conquered an element of misgiving, latent and concealed, which had
sometimes marred the joy of our relations. Now we felt a careless
and joyous freedom as we went about openly, two independent persons
occupying our separate rooms, not ashamed to enjoy each other's
society, and indifferent to the speculations of other people. It is
one of the compensations which alleviate the burden of increasing
years. I recall all that bright interval. For the rest I was
vegetating in my rooms, writing, and looking forward to Edith's
letters. She was living for both of us.</p>

<p>On board the <i>Minneapolis</i> she wrote a letter to me from
time to time: "She is a lovely boat and though I have felt queer
now and again I've not missed a meal. M. [a friend who was crossing
in the same ship] is very sweet and I sleep nearly all day and
night and feel much better already, though my cough has not gone
get...I nearly cried for you last night, the big black waves were
so dark and the sky so grey, and I began to wonder if I had not
been a big little fool, but I know it is all for the best...I'm as
brown as a berry. I've been drefful homesick for you again and do
pray all is well. One word <i>Come</i> and I shall beg, borrow, or
steal and come back. People have spotted me and I've been reading
to them all this afternoon. I see you so plainly, my Darling, and
love you so much. It seems intolerable not to have a word from
you&mdash;I feel I can't bear it and yet I've just got to...They
are all so sweet to me. I chose our seats at table near a groom and
some very ordinary folk, but it has been no use. They all say the
usual thing and tell me I shall take the States by storm. I feel
very humble. It is love I love, all your love and that of my
friends seems to help me day by day. The cough still persists a
little and the pain in my side, but it will go, I know...The
ex-Attorney-General of Philadelphia prophesises great things for me
and has given me a lot of hints. I am sure this was the one thing
to do to save me in health and purse. The only thing is the awful
silence of these days and not knowing how you are...We are nearing
now. I sent a wireless yesterday. I hold you close and am your
loving wifie."</p>

<p>Her arrival might well have been disconcerting and even
overwhelming. The last days of the passage were the worst and the
ship reached New York through a thick fog. Here, plunged suddenly
into the deafening whirl of what seemed to her a strange and
terrific city, she learnt immediately that the season was so late
she could only give a few lectures and that, moreover, the friend
she expected to stay with had suddenly been called away to Europe
to the bedside of a dying relative. But she had no time to be
dismayed, her diary and her first letter plunge at once into the
stream of exciting events, and she realised almost immediately that
there was no need for dismay. The beautiful hospitality, the
unfailing cordiality, the simple helpfulness of Americans&mdash;for
which her warm gratitude and admiration never
ceased&mdash;surrounded her from the first moment. She was taken
into the house of Dr. and Mrs. (also Dr.) Maclean and their
unbounded kindness and high social position were of the greatest
aid to her throughout the visit. There were half a dozen
interviewers awaiting her and great as was her horror of
interviewing up to this time, she felt, as she said, that she must
enter into the game, and played it exultantly, indeed with a
frankness and good humour scarcely common even in America. A large
number of the most prominent women in New York were brought to be
introduced to her, she was made a member of some of the best social
clubs, and a round of visits to important people and interesting
sights began at once. No wonder that on the third day she wrote: "I
was <i>so</i> tired yesterday I could scarcely crawl about." But
that, one understands, is America, and that mainly is why all the
persistent pressure brought on me by Edith and by others has never
sufficed to carry me there.</p>

<p>"I've just fallen right on my feet; things are opening
wonderfully," she wrote in this same first letter. Even in her
second letter she wrote that it was arranged she was to come over
to America again on the 1st of November, and her lecture agent
began at once to arrange a tour for that future visit. "I am the
woman of the moment and it is <i>so</i> funny. They all seem to
love me and I am fascinated with these terrific youthful faces
here. This afternoon fourteen of the most prominent women in New
York are coming here to meet me and yesterday I was at the house of
a wonderfully beautiful woman as a <i>lioness.</i> It is all to me
a strange experience. I am getting a little used to the
expressions. So much is so very French. I am being taken
<i>such</i> care of, and am keeping very well on the whole, but
this <i>vitality</i> in the air is tremendous."</p>

<p>A week after her arrival, on May 5th, she wrote: "My Beloved
Boy, your letter has come at last and has taken a
fortnight!...Everything is opening, and Mrs. Maclean says more has
opened for me in a week than for most in years. Every day we motor
to glorious country'and every impression I had of America is
fading. It is <i>wonderful,</i> and so rarely refined in the corner
I have crept into. I'm reading three times this week, and, as you
know, I go to Chicago (a thousand miles further from you) on
Monday...Oh! my sweet! Every bit of me rejoiced to see your writing
this morning. It just seems years since I left you. This sorrow to
you [the passing trouble in regard to Amy] has been shared and I
love you more and more. Perhaps I have never fully realised the
union and love between us until this separation. I am growing
stronger day by day&mdash;getting the old throw back of my head.
This dry sunny climate, the delicate food and ways&mdash;all so
French and beyond it&mdash;the love I'm getting and the
understanding and the surety of success, simply is curing me. Mrs.
Maclean says she can't let me go back. There's even a cat and dog
in the house! They have put me as a temporary member in the three
best Clubs here and I tell you your wifie is just spoilt to death.
Oh! Lily, Lily, how well you knew and how wonderful it all
is...With the deepest, tenderest love a woman can feel for a man,
your Wifie."</p>

<p>All this time her Diary and her letters continued to be mainly
the swift and summary record of crowded and delightful days:
meetings with distinguished and interesting people, visits to
attractive resorts and great hospitable houses, receptions in her
honour, her reading of her plays and stories and her speeches,
interviews with journalists, arrangements for future lectures and
articles. (At one of these readings, as she notes in her Diary, she
was introduced by Ernest Seton Thompson as "a prophetess from the
wilderness, neither wholly woman nor wholly man but wholly human.")
It is an animated and attractive record but it has little interest
for anyone but me now. She was revelling in the environment that
most completely suited her, and she was organising the future, an
occupation in which she always delighted, and which had not in it
the tiring strain of actual execution. There is never once in her
swift enthusiastic letters the faintest jar to the music of love
and tenderness that sounds throughout them, and that was always the
sign that all was well with her in health of body as well as of
spirit.</p>

<p>"We have passed the Rubicon," she wrote on May 9th. "I've given
all this fortnight to details and experiences and we've won. I am
the rage. It shows how I have been hurt that it is just nothing to
me except that it is a joy to realise the wonder of this new
civilisation. You simply <i>must</i> come with me in November and
then we'll go to Bermuda or somewhere for the winter. It will heal
you and me too. I am an utterly different creature already in this
dry stimulating climate. I went to the Robert Ingersolls the othr
night and the first person I saw was little Dorothy C. you and I
held years ago in our arms&mdash;a girl of twenty. It knocked me
over somehow...I read at the Cosmopolitan Club to 250 of the picked
women of New York, expert actresses, etc. They just adored me, but
I felt terribly nervous. They speak so sweetly of you...We motored
down the Hudson to a lovely Club House among the magnolia trees and
twelve of the leaders of society were invited and I was again the
guest of honour. Mrs. D., the great actress, was there and had
heard me read the day before. She said I had magnetism and a voice
which would hold any audience spellbound. It is <i>all</i> here
now. I wonder why people love me so. They do, you know, quite
genuinely, and if I could only believe a little of what they say I
think it would help, but the knocks have been too great. I
<i>long</i> so to see you, sweetheart, and if all the women leave
you I am with you and love you deeply and truly and for ever and
ever as a mother her babe and a woman her comrade."</p>

<p>She duly went to Chicago fora week, staying at Hull House, where
Jane Addams sweetly gave up her own room to Edith and swiftly won
her most heartfelt admiration. There was again the constant round
of interviews, receptions, luncheons, dinners, readings of plays
and stories, lectures, speeches and sight-seeing, especially of all
that concerned social reform in this vividly alive and progressive
city. Again also she was everywhere met with the same warm hearty
enthusiasm, both for her own sake and, as she recognised, for mine.
"It is just as if I had died and woke to real understanding...They
said things about you I thought would choke me. God knows what I
said&mdash;I felt there was at last the realisation of all my
struggles. I said I would drag you over the ocean and the land by
your beard if you would come no other way. I've never realised such
enthusiasm." Every day or two she wrote me swift loving letters
full of her joy and wonder, though now and then there would be a
touch of sadness. "I am again the woman of the hour or week, but I
must have died last summer&mdash;I realise so many things now." It
was a reference to emotional experiences touched on in letters of
that period already quoted in their place. Again she refers to
"what I felt last year at &mdash;&mdash;. I shall never quite get
over that, I know. I am always near and close to you and I am
getting on well. Everyone says I look well and happy, but really
I've grown more philosophic." As she writes, however, a little
later, summing up her visit: "I've had the great adventure and
<i>the</i> time of my life. I just never can be grateful enough to
America for understanding what you and I stand for."</p>

<p>At this stage, near the end of her visit, there appeared in her
letters the sole little cloud on the sunny tenderness of her
affection. I had been a little worried and hurt by the frankness
with which she had spoken to interviewers of me and of our
relations. She who had always viewed interviewing with contempt,
who had once reproached me for giving a quite impersonal little
interview, was now publicly entering into details of our private
relationship. Some of the statements she made even admitted of
total misunderstanding and were duly garbled into absurdity when
copied into the newspapers. I knew that she had been animated by
the desire to clear up misunderstandings the extent of which she
doubtless exaggerated, and the mere existence of which was to me in
any case a matter of indifference, and that she felt she was only
entering into the American spirit and method of emphasising at once
both our mutual independence and our unity. But some of our English
friends were a little shocked, and I knew that even some American
friends smiled. I wiote several times in succession to convey my
own feelings on this matter; whether, as may be possible, too
emphatically, I do not know, for she preserved none of these
letters. Instead of soothing my ruffled sentiments she became
herself irritated and showed it in the letters she wrote during the
week or two that followed the reception of mine. Then the cloud
passed. But, as I look back, I see its significance. It
foreshadowed the greater cloud which, in the heightened exaltation
and nervous exhaustion of her second American visit, appeared
unexpectedly and more persistently in our sky.</p>

<p>On May 21st she wrote: "I told Mitchell Kennerley you were
distressed at the personal interviews, but he says they are
inevitable and I <i>knew</i> it. You see it dissipates all idea you
and I are not at one, and if you don't say some things they make
them up." In a following letter she says: "You have hurt me badly."
Later, on June 7th, the feeling was nearly past. "Yes, I've
conquered, and however much you may hate some of the interviews
they were inevitable. I'm booked well for the autumn; I mean to be
here on November 1st and want you to venture. I can protect you
easily aid the sun and warm places would do you good. No more
English winters for me. I will tell you all when I come. I happen
to have 'caught on' for some reason. Even your name would never
have done it alone and most of the women have never heard of you.
Now&mdash;the men declare&mdash;they realise why you have done what
you have! They just love me. It is very funny. I ought to lose my
head, but it is scarcely touching me, though the feeling that all
our worries will be over is a great sedative. I expect I'll just
live to pay my debts and fling out to a greater America...Aren't
you proud of me? It was a bit plucky, you know, to do Whittington
and win, but then if I failed you ought to have loved me more. I
<i>long</i> to see you, but don't worry me about those interviews.
If you were here you would realise how little it really matters
except to open a way for publicity at the start. I've been to see
Ella Wheeler Wilcox twice in her lovely home, and she wants me to
stay there. She called on me and amused me awfully. She has had to
write against my theories on love. I am thankful you and Amy are
drawing closer again. Our best theories don't comfort us if they
are carried out on our aching hearts I find. Love to you ever." But
even a week later my objection to the interviews still stuck in her
mind. "Somehow I can't get over the things you said about these
interviews. If I am a free individual I have a right to do what is
best and in this case it was best for us both." But that was the
last of it, and in the letters that follow she is tenderly looking
forward to our meeting and hoping that we should go direct to
Clare, a place for which she had an affection, for a few first days
together. That proposal for some reason, however, failed to prove
convenient.</p>

<p>Everything had opened out for her wonderfully in America, as she
wrote in her last letter before leaving: complete social success
and new friends on every hand, so that much as she had moved about
she had never once stayed at a hotel, several of her books accepted
by publishers, plays likely to be produced, articles wanted by
leading journals, lectures successfully arranged for the winter.
She felt gladly confident that she would live to pay off all debts
and obligations. But she was evidently becoming a little tired
after all the activities and excitements of this great reception so
unexampled in her experience. Her health was no longer
satisfactory. She wrote tenderly in these last letters but there
was in them once or twice a shadow of doubt concerning the love of
those loved ones she had left in England for "the poor fool who is
here worshipped as a divinity." There were numerous references in
those letters to fatigue and headaches and bad nights, though her
last words were of cheer. She needed the refreshment of the voyage
across the Atlantic to home.</p>

<p>That voyage proved entirely beneficial and restorative. It was
the good season of the year, the passage was throughout pleasant
and uneventful, she could rest quietly with the comfortable
assurance that her quest had been achieved. At the same time she
made, as she made always, some delightful friends. I think it was
on this passage that with her quick discernment she detected that
there was an understanding between the captain and a lady
passenger. They were secretly engaged, she was travelling across
simply to enjoy his society, but they had arranged that no one was
to know. Edith's penetration of the secret made both of them, who
shortly after were married, her good friends until the end. In
whatever society she might be her vividly alert and sympathetic
nature could always find elements of joy and interest. When she
arrived in London at the beginning of July she was in excellent
health and all signs of diabetes, clearly marked just before she
left New York, had disappeared.</p>

<p>She came to see me at the flat for a few days and then we went
down to the little cottage at Stanwell where the pony and donkey
had been well tended during her absence. Here we spent two months
peacefully and happily, seldom apart, except when now and then we
went up to London for a day or two, and we usually went up together
and came down together. That cottage was the most absurdly small
cottage we had ever lived in together. But we had seldom had a more
harmoniously serene time in any of them. Fortunately it was a
rarely beautiful summer, that summer in which the Great War was to
break out. Near-by there was an old park, of which the house was
uninhabited, and by arrangement with the caretaker we spent a
considerable part of every day here in preference to the grounds in
which the cottage stood. After breakfast, while Edith settled the
little household affairs&mdash;in which I also had taken a
share&mdash;I would go across to the park carrying her rug and the
bed-table on which she wrote, together with my own papers, and
settle down to work beneath a large tree in that peaceful and
beautiful retreat. (I remember writing there a paper on
"Masculinism and Feminism" which Edith was to deliver as a lecture
in America on my behalf, and I wrote with a special regard to her
delivery of it.) An hour or so later she would arrive with her
papers and settle down to work beneath the same tree a few feet
away; we had seldom found it possible to work together in the same
room, but here in the open it was easy. Then she would return to
prepare our simple lunch and I would shortly follow. In the
afternoon we would again be in the park and then after a cup of tea
we usually went for a drive, for, though in Cornish days I rarely
cared to go with her driving, when the conditions were changed and
we were both in an unfamiliar district I was content to accompany
her. It was rather a strange equipage, for since the pony was
growing old Edith ran him together with the donkey, who was ever
willing and well-paced. Then home to dinner, usually cooked for us
by the gardener's wife in the cottage opposite, and early to
bed&mdash;she in the large room above and I in the little room
below&mdash;where our rest was sometimes disturbed by the loud
clatter of horses' hoofs along the adjoining road.</p>

<p>As I looked back on those summer weeks for some years afterwards
and before I knew how much of my life still lay ahead, they seemed
to me the lovely and peaceful sunset of the long working-day of my
life. It also came to seem tragic since we never knew how fateful a
war was approaching nor how fatally her health and life were about
to be crushed. Yet it has always seemed beautiful. No period of our
life together remains more vivid in memory, and none happier. It
was a honeymoon at the end of our life together, yet of a rarer
kind, for love had grown deeper and more tender than at that first
Lamorna honeymoon. This, too, was in a delightful though unlike
spot and there could be no more splendid summer weather. She was
also in better health and spirits after the sea-voyage than for
years past, fairly free from worries, and looking forward to her
lecturing tour, while the thought of leaving me filled her with an
unaccustomed gentleness which now seems like an unconscious
premonition of the end. We were both in the fullness of our mental
power to work for the world, and could lie down through the day
under the great beech tree working together, while the doves were
softly cooing, and the doom of war was still concealed in the
future. But now we were in August and the Great War was beginning.
Even in this little village remote from the railway we felt its
presence. (And, so it chances, to-day, twenty-four years later, in
another remote little village, again a great war seemed
approaching, and gas-masks only a few days ago were officially
issued to us.) Indeed the landlord of the public-house near by,
where we would go for our supply of ginger beer, had once been a
personal servant of Kitchener, in whom he was full of admiring
trust, and we would look in to hear the latest news or to exchange
opinions about the situation. Then the great Metropolitan
reservoir, which happened to be situated just outside the village,
had to be guarded by pickets and so there were many men in khaki
about. One day as we walked along the road we met a young officer,
and Edith, in her characteristic way, cheerily asked him as he
passed how things were going. "Oh!" he replied still more
cheerfully, "we'll soon cut up the Germans like pork." Edith made
no response, but she had had experience in cutting up pork, and in
the years that followed she more than once referred to the remark
which the brutality of war had evoked from that wholesome, pleasant
boy.</p>

<p>Her attitude towards the war was spontaneously, and not as the
result of any discussion or argument, identical with mine. She had
friends in every camp, most of them of course zealous patriots,
many of them pacifists and conscientious objectors, one of her
dearest friends a German living in London. Her relations with all
of them remained unaffected. She was, as she always had been,
absolutely opposed to war. At the same time she believed that
England had played an honourable and justifiable part in entering
the war, though she was far from sharing the cant current at the
time concerning the wonderful results to ensue. But she maintained
a singularly disinterested and aloof attitude, aided in this, no
doubt, by the fact that none near and dear to her were actively
engaged. She was never disturbed by any war-scares, nor was she
ever moved to take the smallest part in any of those various kinds
of "warwork" into which the women around her were feverishly
plunging, not that she cherished any rigid pacifist principles
against so doing, but simply, I think, because the whole operation
of war was so alien to her that she could not interest herself in
assisting it. Later, in America, which had not yet entered the war,
she was careful to maintain a correct attitude, as a foreigner, by
refraining from discussing the merits of the war or championing the
cause of her own country, though she privately hoped that the "war
fanatics" would not draw America in. This attitude of courtesy was
misinterpreted by the German propagandists in the States, and she
was approached by an emissary from the German Embassy with a large
financial offer which, needless to say, she rejected with indignant
surprise. After her return to England the war was beginning to
touch London nearer, but she remained calm and indifferent even in
the face of risks, for those nervous persons who may be terrified
by imaginary dangers are often courageous in the face of real
danger. It was while watching a Zeppelin raid, in which she showed
not the slightest fear, that she caught her fatal illness.</p>

<p>During these months, I have said, we were seldom apart. Now at
last, in August, I have a letter from her. She had gone to spend a
day or two with an old friend who had recently taken a house at
Speen, a small village, some miles away from the railway, in
Buckinghamshire. Thence she wrote: "My darling Boy, so glad of your
dear letter. I've a lovely scheme for you and me if you can fall in
with it. Daphne has a furnished cottage close by this one and will
lend it to us for two or three weeks in September early. I shall
pay a girl to come in and do for us, and of course provide meals.
It is ideal, a revolving shelter in the garden, <i>absolute</i>
quiet and not a soul near, fine woods, and air like Suffolk. Don't
fix up anything else but come and let us for once be in peace
together as we were in Condon's garden. [She is referring to a
happy fortnight we had spent years earlier when, escaping from the
constant demands on her of farming and domestic life, we took rooms
in the house of a farmer's daughters, at Carbis Bay, close to our
own place but in peace.] This air and quiet is superb. Till we meet
and always, your tender old Wifie."</p>

<p>This was entirely characteristic of her swift impulses and
decisions and her aptitude for organisation. It all took place
exactly as she had planned, and it was all as she described, though
even more delightful. The cottage, now pulled down, was very
ancient, "The Old House" it was named, and it belonged to a refined
invalid lady of old family who had gone to America and never
returned until the war was over. She had made it comfortable and
furnished it with taste, so that we found there all that we needed.
Speen is in the Chiltern Hills, and the clear exhilarating
air&mdash;though for me less invigorating than that of
Suffolk&mdash;the little woods of beech or pine into which we could
freely wander without meeting a soul, those tree-covered heights
which became glorious in tint as autumn approached, were a joy to
us both. We were both able to work in the little garden, she in the
revolving shelter (such as I lie in at this moment nearly
twenty-five years later in Suffolk) and I reclining in a hammock
chair close by, usually just out of her sight, so that I might the
better concentrate my thoughts, though this was a disposition not
altogether to her taste for she liked to be able to see me. In the
early morning Elsie, the girl who waited on us, would come in time
to prepare our baths and the breakfast, and then having done the
morning's house-work and laid our cold lunch, returned home; we ate
the lunch by ourselves, first sometimes, after due consideration,
going to the village inn with a jug for some ale. In the late
afternoon Elsie would return to prepare the dinner, and when the
heat of the day was over, and our work, we would often go for a
walk, less often for a drive, as the walks were pleasanter. One I
well remember and repeated more than once, through the fields and
up the hill as the colours of sunset began to tint the sky and the
slopes, in which we would share a communion of bliss. Under such
conditions I was able to write well and easily. It was then, I
remember, that among other things I wrote, and without an effort,
an article published in the <i>Edinburgh Review</i> (and intended
for expansion into a long chapter of a book on the genius of
Europe, which will ever remain unfinished) on the psychology of the
English people. It was animated by a patriotic enthusiasm, aroused
by the war, which I had never felt before. I may add that I have
never felt it since.</p>

<p>The delightful month at Speen was soon over. Before it was over
it became necessary for Edith to make frequent visits to London.
She was becoming oppressed by all the preparations necessary for
this long and important visit to the United States. It was not
merely the preparation for the lectures, which had gone on
satisfactorily, but an equipment, in dresses and other necessaries,
for it was not her way to embark on any enterprise without careful
organisation. There were also many affairs to wind up in England.
This meant, again, a worrying financial strain, and to it was added
a failure in health. The fresh vigour with which she had returned
from the voyage in June was lost and the diabetic symptoms had
returned. She never ceased, and with insistence, to urge me to
accompany her. But on that point I was adamant. Indeed I have
always rejected the most tempting offer to go to America, and if
she could not persuade me certainly no one else ever could. Once
when she and Olive and I were lunching together she returned to
this point, but Olive took my side and declared that I must be left
free to decide for myself. Still her indomitable energy, and the
hope that animated her for the future, surmounted all difficulties,
and the preparations for the venture were completed as planned.</p>

<p>Early in October she took away her dear friend of those days for
a quiet farewell visit to a seaside resort in Suffolk I had
recommended to her, having myself once stayed there enjoyably with
Amy. This visit was the occasion of the next letter I have, and it
is a letter which well reveals the climax of the relationship which
had grown up between us and the mutual comprehension it involved:
"My Darling Boy, how sweet you are! X is tender and more sweet than
ever before and looks at me as I never thought possible for her
nature. We are very comfie here anal in spite of the extravagance
it was the only way. [Not being able to get into the hotel I
recommended, which had closed for the season, they had gone into
another more expensive one near by.] Beautiful food, huge fires in
our rooms, lovely beds, perfect weather. I've just wakened from
seven hours perfect sleep and am a new creature. I believe I should
have smashed entirely. Thank you for all the relief about the
money. I shall get through now, I believe, but it <i>has</i> been a
strain. I keep thinking of you and dwelling in your heart. Yes, I
had seen the papers. Now it is my turn to ask why fabrications get
into the papers. Funny! That I have helped you in <i>Man and
Woman!</i> I guess I have, but not in the way they think. My brain
has ease at last and I can think. We went to the lovely harbour of
&mdash;&mdash; or wherever it is yesterday and sat in a sheltered,
sunny spot from 11 to 3.30, and no lunch as we have big breakfasts
and dinners. We may go to &mdash;&mdash; to-morrow. We do as the
moment prompts, and we went to the Ritz Theatre here last night. My
love ever, my precious one that no one can separate from me. Love
to Amy. W."</p>

<p>The last days passed rapidly in a whirl of preparations so that
I can no longer recall any details. I smile sadly as I realise how
blind we both were to Fate, how little intimation either of us had
of the significance of those days. With tender affection on both
sides, there was less of the solicitude we had felt before her
first plunge into adventure across the mysterious unknown Atlantic.
We both felt, I imagine, that it was no longer mysterious and
unknown. She was merely repeating an experience that had proved
altogether successful; the only difference was that this time a
still greater success awaited her. There seemed no occasion for
anxiety. I failed, as much as she failed, to realise that this
separation was to be for a much longer period, that far greater
strain would be incurred, that she was going at the most trying
season of the year, and that she was in a bad state of health. As I
look back I seem to see us standing at length on the final height
of our life's course together, more at one than we had ever been
before, and from that moment I was to remain there rooted for ever
to the spot where we had been entirely at one, while she was to
slide, slowly or rapidly, down a terrible slope, beneath my eyes,
and no power on earth could give strength enough to my arms to hold
her still within my grasp and against my heart. And if I had
accompanied her it might have been so different!</p>

<p>Yet one moment remains, and will ever remain, vividly in memory,
and that was the last. The night before she had spent at the Club
to be near her dear woman friend, and thence she wrote: "My
precious Lamb, this is just a sweet good night. Our bodies are
apart only as they are when you are in Brixton and I in this Club.
Nothing and no one can ever separate our spirits. After this no
more homelessness for <i>we</i> will make one home possible for us
both. Just try and think I'll soon be back, and if either of us
crosses over to fairyland and rest, we know it should know that it
is well worth while and be ready for our next job. I just hold you
close and love you. W."</p>

<p>The last hours this time were to be given to me alone. I went
down with her from Fenchurch Street to Tilbury Docks, where her
ship, the <i>Minnetonka,</i> lay, and she was anxious I should see
the cabin in which she was to pass the voyage. But the official
fear of enemy activities had by this time increased, the
regulations were strict, only passengers could be allowed on board,
and there was no one who could give me a permit to enter the ship.
We lingered on the hither side of the narrow gangway while the
crowd of passengers drifted across. At last I handed over her
dressing-bag, a wedding present which had accompanied her on all
journeys throughout our life together, and she too passed across.
We stood gazing at each other, while the crowd now more eagerly
surged on board. Long and sadly I gazed as though I knew that I
should never see quite that same woman again. Only a few feet of
gangway, but it stood over an abyss which would never be completely
bridged.</p>

<p>Then at last, when the tension could no longer be borne, I moved
away, waving my hand as I disappeared among the crowd, and the
vision passed from my eyes. I recall restlessly pacing up and down
the desolate railway platform while at the hour of noon hungry
workmen swarmed across the line to dinner. After that there is a
long blank in my memory.</p>

<p>There was, however, one more letter next day, written as the
ship passed down the river: "My Beloved Boy," she wrote, "I thought
I had blood in my tight throat when that awful moment came. I
caught myself moaning while I was trying to laugh and joke. Never
mind&mdash;it is already so many hours to the time we meet again. I
hate to go, but it is the only way. I wish you were here lying
peacefully in the sun. I shall soon be back and no distance can
part our love. I've my job to do and I'll do it. A pathetic note
from X; she is feeling it badly. Take care, my own, take care, and
write often and in love. The pilot takes this soon. It will be long
before I hear, but my thoughts are always with you. Your own
Wifie."</p>

<p>What I experienced with this woman&mdash;I feel now many years
after her death&mdash;was <i>life</i>. She was the instrument that
brought out all those tones which the older I grow I feel to be of
the very essence of life, tones of joy sometimes but oftener of
anguish, not happiness. I smile when I find people cheerfully
talking of "happiness" as something to be desired in life. I do not
know what happiness may be, but it is not life. I have lived. And
this woman by her peculiar temperament, by her acute sensibility,
by her energy of impulse, by her deep hold of my most sensitive
fibres, struck out the notes of joy and anguish which are love and
which also are life. For love as I have known it is a passion more
of what we call the soul than of the body; unlike the passion that
is alone of the flesh, it is a flame that continues to burn even
long years after the body that may seem to have inspired it is
turned to dust. But it is because I have known love that I have
lived and that my life and my work in the world have been one. My
work, I am often told, is cool and serene, entirely reasonable and
free of passion, but without that devouring passion of the soul my
work would have been nothing.</p>

<p>I speak of a flame. Yet when I inhale the scent of a flower this
woman loved, or gaze on a picture or a book that meant much to her,
I am wrapped away from the world and caught up into another sky. I
realise what are the only things in life that have any value for us
and I know&mdash;what all our science as well as our art has so
often asserted&mdash;that the so-called "realities" are nothing,
that it is the things that are made of space and time, out of
emptiness, our symbols and our pictures, that are alone the eternal
things.</p>

<p>I continue my narrative. The day before she left I had sent a
little letter to New York: "This is a line to meet you, I hope,
when you arrive, and to tell you how I am with you in the spirit
all the time and thinking of you and loving you and praying that
all goes well with you&mdash;as I still have faith that it will. I
am always looking forward to your safe return (with or without
money!) and to the prospect of our settling down peacefully for a
time in Speen or Carbis, if possible without any worries. In the
meanwhile I shall be shut up in my flat, safe no doubt though
rather dreary, and trying to work hard. I shall be writing to you
twice a week at least&mdash;though you mustn't be worried at delays
for the mails seem so uncertain in length of passage&mdash;and,
anyhow, alive or dead, I shall always be loving you." The following
day I wrote: "I have just got back from Tilbury and am feeling very
desolate without you. I always seem to see your sweet face, and am
sorry I could not see your cabin so as to picture you there...I
always seem to love you more and more and your last absence doesn't
make this one any easier...Your lovely and unexpected letter just
comes as I was going out to post this. Thank you, Darling. It is a
great help to me and I shall read it over and over again till I
hear from you." That was Saturday, and on the following Tuesday I
wrote: "On Saturday evening when I was undressing, thinking of you,
and feeling very lonely and sad, your unexpected wire came. I have
felt much cheered ever since, though still low and sad, Amy thinks,
and doesn't know what to do with me; she came to take me to dinner
on Sunday but I preferred to be alone with thoughts of you; went by
myself to concert in the afternoon. I am quite well and working
fairly, and shall no doubt get along all right...It is nice to feel
that in less than a week you will be in New York and I shall have
word from you."</p>

<p>In due course, when the <i>Minnetonka</i> was nearing New York,
there came the little wireless message, this time not so absolutely
reassuring as after her first voyage. Meanwhile, a week after
leaving London, she had written on board a letter to send me from
New York. Here is the greater part of it: "My own Darling Boy,
Never shall I forget your beloved face as I left it. I tried to
smile to the end, but it was as if I had blood in my throat. It was
<i>awful,</i> and the whole journey has been awful, but I shall
feel better if only I hear you are safe, and that you are not
missing me as I miss you. This silence for all those days seems to
make it a year! It is the worst of the whole thing. I've been eaten
up with remorse at coming and yet I see no other way to freedom. It
has been a horrible voyage&mdash;thank God you were not here to
endure it. I've been ill more or less all the time, but I've never
stayed in my cabin more than half a day. Now I am better, but have
had no heart to write till now. I've a nice cabin and my stewardess
is a dear, but that is all. The ship is demoralised over the war.
There is scarcely any cargo, so that it is not steady: they've been
chased once, the captain was ill at the beginning, and Karl
Schneider, the chief engineer, in charge of the ship. Everyone half
in panic and the war gloom is everywhere. Mrs. Ryan [a friend who
chanced to be crossing in the same ship] has been ill all the time,
but it's been a comfort to know someone. I've not been able to work
at all; there are ten children near me, my heart has been very
weak, my head bad, and the weather horrible except for a few days.
One awful gale made me feel I wanted to die and get it over. We
<i>hope</i> to get in Tuesday morning, but who can tell? I feel I
shall <i>hate</i> America and wonder if I shall even get through,
but I expect it will be different when once I am in New York. The
war news seems pretty awful. Turkey in now, and I suppose Italy
will follow. The whole atmosphere reeks of despair. My heart is in
England, and oh, my Boy, my Boy, I hope you have not heard the
cries I've called you with. I feel already ten years older, but
I've the sense to realise that the voyage is the worst part, as
when I get your letters I shall feel better. Thinking has been
impossible. I gave it up at last in despair and just sat in my
deck-chair and watched that awful sea. I keep wondering and
wondering how you are and the Pater. [My father was dying when she
left.] I shall come back the moment I see myself pretty clear of
debt. This is the only way. Nevertheless I dread it all because I
am not strong. I'll never again cross in a boat I do not know well.
My Darling, go away with Amy to the sea some fine days, do anything
and everything to make you happy, and when once I come back I'll
see to it we are together and at rest at last. <i>If</i> the
Germans win we must live in California&mdash;eh? I'm dying and
longing to get your dear letters. Love is a terrific thing. It was
like sawing my bowels out when I left you. Never again must you see
me off. All the time I've pictured your grey dear face which I love
more and more and for ever and ever. God bless and keep you. Love
to Amy."</p>

<p>"Together and at rest at last." I smile sadly as, after an
interval of nearly six years, I read once more that expression of
her constant desire which now can only be fulfilled when one day my
ashes are scattered where hers already lie. But deeper than smiles
or tears is the love that rings out in such letters as these. I
have never attempted to disguise how keenly I sometimes suffered,
how at moments all my nervous system was jarred by the temperament
at once tortured, fierce, and tender of my life's comrade, but when
it is realised&mdash;and I myself never failed to realise
it&mdash;how I received for a quarter of a century the deepest love
of this woman who had such a genius for loving combined with her
acute and shrewd intelligence and whose nature went so eagerly into
manifold affections, it cannot seem surprising that the stamp of
that flaming love, long purified of earthly stain, has been burnt
so profoundly into me that all other love that comes to me now
often seems only a kind of play, even if a heavenly play, and I
remain for ever hers.</p>

<p>Now when, sixteen years later, I read these words I leave them
standing. I could not tell when I wrote them that deep love and
comradeship in life were not over for me. Yet deep as is the love
and comradeship which binds me to the cherished companion of my
later years, deeper than ever after the many years it has lasted,
some of them bringing me more unalloyed happiness than I ever knew
before, nothing can ever efface the stamp made on my being during
the most active period of my career by Edith.</p>

<p>When she reached New York, as Edith had herself anticipated, the
gloom of the voyage was quickly dispelled by the sunny, stimulating
climate and the warm welcome of sympathetic friends. She wrote on
November 6th from the National Arts Club: "My Precious Boy, oh! the
loveliness of getting a letter from you after that <i>awful</i>
voyage. They won't let codes go now and I felt eight shillings was
well spent to save you anxiety, as I feared you might see in the
papers what an escape we had and the <i>Olympic.</i> I never felt
so horrible in my life as when I felt I might leave you all those
debts to face. E. and M. and his wife and the K's met me, and oh!
how kind, and Miss Tarbell here had all ready for me. A lovely
large room and every comfort. The houses are so wonderful, and oh!
the love I left here to find again. I lecture on you next Thursday
at the Court Theatre and that is my challenge to New York. The
inevitable section is awake on you and me&mdash;our 'decadence,'
etc. Who cares? I sent you <i>Love-Acre</i> yesterday with my
deepest and tenderest love. Oh, God! Havelock, never think I don't
love you. It is awful the homesickness and longing for you and I've
had no English letters yet but the one you wrote before I left, and
I love it so. Yes&mdash;in life and death, my Sweet...Those darling
K's have taken a flat under theirs, furnished it and put their
secretary to sleep there and told me I am to have it as my
headquarters always and leave my things and wander where I will. He
declares I have saved him and he says nothing material he can do is
more than a ripple. I've accepted. Why not? It is my turn now to be
taken care of or I'll die...I will write regularly every Tuesday
and Friday and Sunday. I shall risk that horrible Atlantic to come
back. I just fold you to my heart and long, long, long for a
letter."</p>

<p>The same notes recur in the letters that followed, the
homesickness, the longing for my presence if only I could face the
cost and the journey, gratitude to her loving and generous friends,
meeting with distinguished people, a whirl of social receptions,
public speeches, business arrangements. And amid it all, references
I now find so significant to her health, and how easily she was
exhausted. She had not been in New York a fortnight before she was
knocked over by an attack of influenza specially af-Tecting her
throat though dispersed by skilful and heroic treatment. She wrote
on November 13th: "Of all miracles I've ever had, the fact that
your lecture was ever given is one&mdash;the day before I got the
grippe, here taking the form of tonsilitis. Myl how sick I was, had
to leave the luncheon table, worse than any sea-sickness. Then that
Mrs. F. pestered me for hours with her mental healing and stayed
till ten, and I thought I should never survive, but a dear thing
here by name of Mary Austin massaged me till nearly one, and the
wonderful Mitchell [Kennerley] sent me a wonderful gargle and by
power of will I went with help to the Court Theatre and you see the
result in the papers. The last ten minutes my voice broke, but the
applause was great. They all loved it and you. It was a crowded
theatre and I was told that everywhere there was the greatest
enthusiasm. General Gordon's daughter and Ingersoll's daughter were
emphatic in their praise and love. They are all so dear and sweet
to me. I am relaxing at last. Don't worry a wee bit, my sweet Love,
I shall be all right in a day or two. Everything that can be done
will be done, and I love you every second and for all time and all
eternity. I've had four letters from you, Darling, and only one
from &mdash;&mdash;." At the end of this long letter she mentions
that Mrs. Maclean is sending her a nurse who can do wonders with
ice packs and so on, and in the next letter she writes: "Nurse G.,
who only takes very special people, has given me three nights
treatment and only took three dollars a treatment. 'Your husband
turned me from a savage to a human being,' she said." But, as she
mentions in a later letter, this attack left behind much exhaustion
and a severe cough.</p>

<p>In the letters I wrote to her between the 23rd and the 30th
November I find: "It is not possible for me to come out, but even
if it were possible I fear I should be a worry to you and I should
certainly be wretched. I shall rejoice to see you again, but you
must not feel homesick or come back before you are quite ready. If
you were here now I really do not quite know what we should do,
without money and with no Rise Cottage [which was let]; London is
not <i>very</i> attractive, even in an ordinary winter. The weather
seems to have jumped suddenly from September to January, and it is
very cold. But I am quite well though not very strong. One still
feels the war all the time, though nothing is going wrong and I
hear the War Ofrice is cheerful just now as to the situation. I
quite believe there may be a Zeppelin raid and possibly an attempt
at invasion. But we are prepared for them and they may do good by
making people realise what war is like. I seldom go anywhere except
now and then to the Museum and an occasional Sunday concert. There
is little temptation to go to the seaside this weather, and with
troops swarming everywhere. Amy also has no wish to go&mdash;and is
busy with house full of Belgian refugee friends, etc.&mdash;but I
am planning to go a long walk in the country with her some day.
Olive cane to lunch and I have just had a card that she enjoyed'her
visit and that I am looking 'much better'...I am always loving you
and praying that all goes well with you. I often think how sweet it
would be alone with you, away from cities, as in the Rose Cottage
dining-room&mdash;even with the door wide open! [An allusion to her
rather excessive love of fresh air, as I thought, in the winter at
Carbis.]...To-motrow I have to go down to Folkestone over eater's
affairs. There is to be just a stone kerb with simple inscription
round the grave at Folkestone (where Miss C. will plant roses) and
his name will be added (according to his wish) on my mother's
tombstone at Redhill...The war goes on steadily but so slowly that
one is now settling down to it and it does not weigh on one so
much. Most of the best things said about the war seem to come from
America. But one is always aching for the poor Belgians, and it is
terrible how all the charming old things are being destroyed there.
The Belgian doctors are in a state of great destitution. I've sent
my case of surgical instruments, dating from student days, as an
anonymous contribution...So many poddles always&mdash;literary,
probate of will, correspondence, household, etc.&mdash;that little
time is left for real work. But there is always time to love you,
and I am constantly thinking tenderly and anxiously of you. Now
that you are well advanced I feel that I can begin to look forward
to your return."</p>

<p>She wrote to me from New York on the 21st November:"My Precious
Boy, I was so glad to get your letter. I am staying with E. and H.
[her old friends, associated with Lily] and got it as I was coming
from my bath. I am having a lovely time at last. This drastic
treatment and tonic have pulled me through: I've only hoarseness
and a desperate night cough. Things are opening up, and I'm to
lecture in West Virginia, Milwaukee, Buffalo, and courses in
drawing-rooms, etc., and on Thanksgiving Day I take the night train
to Chicago...I've never imagined such kindness as these folks
show&mdash;all alike...Dear old Pater! how sweet he is. I wish I
could see him once more before he boards the greater
<i>Winifred</i> [the last ship my father commanded]. I am always
with you, loving you more and more. People do so love you here. I
must bring you once, you can hide as easily as possible...Write to
Chicago when you get this. I've taken a studio and bathroom close
to the Maurice Browns and there I cater for myself while I work
like a black for three weeks. Some of the worry poison is at last
escaping out of me. England nearly killed me. Here it is like Speen
air, only more so, and brilliant sun. Take care, my little
Havelock. Ohl if I could just kiss you, my Havelock."</p>

<p>I do not need to rely solely on her own letters as evidence of
the enthusiastic cordiality of her reception in America. Apart from
her letters and the reports of the newspaper interviewers, letters
reached me from American correspondents, then and later, testifying
to the same effect. A new woman friend, who occupied an adjoining
room at the New York National Arts Club, and saw much of her during
her serious illness, wrote to me even more than ten years
later:</p>

<p class="quote">"I shall always see her as she was here at first,
so interested in everybody and everything, and herself so
interesting, and her beautiful nature, so warm and kind she was."
She adds in connection with the illness:</p>

<p class="quote">"I realised how worried she was, so many times she
said to me: 'I do not want Havelock to know how ill I am, he would
be so worried.'"</p>

<p>Again, Huneker, the noted musical critic with whom I had long
been in friendly touch, wrote to me also some years later:</p>

<p class="quote">"I had met Mrs. Ellis here, we talked of you, she
worshipped you. A glorious intelligence, hers, and a noble woman.
My wife and I sympathise with you&mdash;no mere lip-service
this."</p>

<p>A few days later she wrote:</p>

<p class="quote">"I go to Chicago to-morrow, but, alas! I can't get
my studio till October 1st, so must go all alone for three nights
to a hotel. The war news scares me for England, but it is a time
when we must all face <i>anything.</i> This is only a wee line to
reassure you. I'm being just adored and everything is being made as
easy as it can be, but my strength is so limited, alas! Oh, my Boy!
I'd give anything to fold you close. Take care, and know I am your
own Wifie."</p>

<p>She wrote next day in the train (I give but brief passages from
this long series of letters full of details of her doings):</p>

<p class="quote">"Here I am speeding my 1000 miles to Chicago with
less trouble than in going from the Club to Brixton. I've had a
wonderful few days, but my cold has been troublesome...I went to
the Opera and for five hours I heard <i>Parsifal.</i> Oh! if only
you had been there. War seemed an impossibility. Then I slept at
the Kehlers and Kehler saw to everything. They are all waiting on
me hand and foot in the train...The war has made people save as
they are doing at home and everyone says I am lucky to have got any
work at all. I speak first on Sunday night on Edward Carpenter.
<i>Love-Acre</i> has already made me some real friends. You
<i>must</i> come over one time. There are things you would love
here. You are always in my thoughts, my precious one."</p>

<p>And she wrote on arriving at the Auditorium Hotel in
Chicago:</p>

<p class="quote">"Here I am, my Boy, safe and sound and easier in
the throat; I just rarely spoke for twenty-four hours and rubbed in
things. I've a lovely room and bath in this huge hotel leading into
the Little Theatre building, and I shall cook in my room, having
everything I want in my boxes."</p>

<p>On December 1st:</p>

<p class="quote">"My Precious Boy, Your letter has just come
telling me of the Pater's funeral, but I've not had one telling of
his death. Dear, dear old Pater. I wish I had seen him once more,
for I've a very tender spot for the dear old thing. I hate to have
been away when this happened, and yet it was the only way. Here I
am in Chicago, the wealthiest city, and Lily is doing her work. I
met Hamlin Garland, the novelist, at the Setons, and he has given
me wonderful invitations. Everything is opening and you will see I
am on my job. The Carpenter was a great success, though it was a
pouring night. I'm staying here. I <i>dare</i> not run risks. I
cook for myself when I'm not invited out, which is nearly always,
and in bad weather I need not go out at all. It is economy, as I
have to guard my throat, and this address opens up my
possibilities. Dr. Kiernan comes; he looks well and has given me
something to help the stuffiness in my nose. He thinks I look
pretty well. I'm still weak but otherwise getting on. Oh! if only
you were here! I know I could protect you and there are such
interesting things going on. My plays are in rehearsal. I am sure
some great things will open out. Emmeline Lawrence is staying at
Hull House for a few days and I go there to dine to-night. I'm
having daily birthdays with presents from gold pens to electric
reading lamps. If only you were here I'd enjoy it as well as learn
and earn from it. I was laughing to myself last night. Imagine
<i>me</i> years ago, in Chicago, not knowing anyone the first few
nights, sleeping alone in a huge hotel! I go to Milwaukee for the
day to lecture on Carpenter. Do take care and I will earn a new
home at last."</p>

<p>That idea constantly recurs. She was upborne by it through the
incessant fatigue of this&mdash;as it really was for her sensitive
and fragile nature&mdash;heroic adventure. But the new home she was
earning was not in this world.</p>

<p class="quote">"I expect I will have a lot to tell you in my next
letter. I can't get away from that telephone which brings me new
chances ever and anon. If only I had more strength, and money to
buy really nourishing food. Here a sixpenny breakfast costs a
dollar. God keep you, my precious Havelock, and soon now my face
will be turning homewards."</p>

<p>I quote largely from her long and frequent letters because they
were a chief interest in my own life at this time. There is little
worth quoting from my own letters. I was lying as quietly as
possible, only anxious for the end of this solitary uncongenial
winter in the London climate&mdash;unfamiliar to me at this season
for many years past&mdash;not inclined to do much work, not seeing
many people. Even of Amy I saw little, as she was at this time
almost entirely absorbed by various home duties. My letters are
filled with the small details of my life and of the little items of
business I was transacting on Edith's behalf, such as the payment
of old bills; all interspersed with affectionate solicitude for her
welfare. On December 3rd I wrote:</p>

<p class="quote">"I went down to Folkestone for five hours on
Tuesday, the whole time taken up in arranging the Pater's little
affalrs. He left everything as clear as possible, but it still
means a number of things to do. The war will change all my
immediate literary plans. But somehow I find no time for work and
am doing very little&mdash;there seem so many small things to do. I
have not yet been able to finish off the new edition of
<i>Inversion.</i> You will know more about the war than I do. There
is much dissatisfaction here at the way the news of naval disasters
is being stupidly held back, although published at full length in
the American papers...I have no news and go on quietly as usual.
Idly only dissipation is an occasional Sunday concert. I am always
thinking of you with love. I shall rejoice to see you again, but am
not specially anxious you should come back in the bad weather or
into the gloom of war, and of course shall be glad if you can
fulfil your purpose and make money."</p>

<p>Next day another letter followed:</p>

<p class="quote">"I wrote to you this morning to Chicago and am now
sending this to New York by another mail going a few hours later.
We are having a tremendous storm and I have rather a bad cold in
head and throat&mdash;but I expect that in London this time of
year. I only trust that your throat and cough are better. I've sent
you the <i>Times Literary Supplement.</i> I don't know any paper
which takes a larger and more reasonable view of the war. So free
from bitterness...Your letters are always so lovely."</p>

<p>And on December 9th I wrote:</p>

<p class="quote">"I was glad to get your letter this morning,
though a little troubled that you do not feel strong. I trust that
by now you have been examined to see how the diabetes is, and I do
pray that you are doing everything wise and sensible. All is well
with me; to-day has turned wet and mild like Cornwall, and at once
I breathe easily as if by magic. My time, however, is much taken up
by poddles, especially winding up the Pater's little affairs, which
involve endless red tape; I had to spend the whole morning at
Somerset House to-day and am not near the end of it yet. Poor Amy
is very much worried and has to spend all her time nursing her
mother. So my proposed day in the country is indefinitely
postponed. I have written an article on 'Kultur' for <i>The New
Statesman,</i> but that is all the literary work I have found time
to do lately. Fisher Unwin has asked me to write a book on the
Psychology of European Nations. It happens, curiously, that that is
<i>exactly</i> what I intend my next book to be; I've had it in my
head and partly written for years, but I do not intend to give it
to Fisher Unwin. [Six years later, however, the book still remained
unfinished. Now, twenty-three years later, I must still say the
same.] You needn't be scared about the war so far as England is
concerned. The Germans are making no progress and not likely to.
And if they <i>do</i> make any desperate attempts, we've now had
ample time to prepare...I am always so thankful that people are so
sweet and helpful to you. That is what reconciles me to your being
in America. I am constantly thinking of you. I fold you close in my
arms and look forward to your safe return as soon as ever you have
done all there is to do."</p>

<p>On 5th December she had written from Chicago:</p>

<p class="quote">"My Sweetheart Boy, so much happens here every
minute I scarcely find time or energy to write letters; but life is
so wonderfully organised, everything without effort or disturbance.
I never see a servant in my room, and yet it seems as if I had six
clean towels and two clean sheets every time I went out for a walk.
My cough is rather hacking, this Lake is so damp and cold and
windy, but here is the money and here I stay till the 22nd at
least. This hotel loves me, and I'm treated out so much I simply
take cocoa and rusks in between. 'Porky's Cissy' [the last Cornish
story she ever wrote] was loved by the men yesterday, and to-morrow
I lecture on you. I get a <i>fearful</i> longing for you at times.
I just love you, and in life or death I am closer to you than ever
you can know. Take care, my Pet."</p>

<p>Four days later:</p>

<p class="quote">"My beloved Boy," she wrote, "this silence is
awful, I've only had one letter since I came here and I just feel I
can't go on. I feel so weak, but a wonderful doctor woman is
examining me to-day. She lost her great friend in March, and I can
help her and she comes to all my lectures. She gave me electricity
last night, which did me good, as I'm so weak and this awful cough
and cold still lingers...I'm struggling with the war articles. My
room is very quiet and I am a lot alone and that saves me. The
lecture on you was a great success, heaps of men and the theatre
crowded; they loved it. It will nearly be Christmas when you get
this, my darling, and my heart will ache and ache. I feel it is
years since I saw you. We must go to California next year. I can
protect you and I can't stand another winter without you. My
eternal love to you."</p>

<p class="quote">"So much is happening," she wrote on the 13th
December, "I do not know where to begin. Thank Heaven for three
letters from you this week and that all goes well. It must be our
last winter apart and never again a winter in England. The waste of
energy and joy is too much. You must come to California with me
next year. My success is now assured. One has to work hard, but my
success is assured. I am getting over the 'flu. Dr., one of the
medical wonders of Chicago, gives me electricity often. She tells
me I am magnificent and will put all her skill to get rid of the
evil which she thinks will all go and that I shall live till I'm
iii! The women doctors have taken the Orchestral Hall, which holds
just on 3,000; have invited me to give the 'The Abnormal in
Eugenics' for women only, and they guarantee no worry and no
expense and a cheque on all left after expenses. They just 'Dye
us&mdash;you and me&mdash;and this is one of their ways of showing
it. Three times in a day I was asked to speak and did it as if I
loved it, but the society part is as terrible to me as to you." She
goes on to tell of all she was doing and of the interesting people
she was meeting. "Oh, my Loved One, that you were here and I could
fold you to me and wish you a happy New Year. Love to Amy and bless
her for looking after you."</p>

<p>Next day, for she was writing now nearly every day, so much was
there to tell, she wrote:</p>

<p class="quote">"This is another letter to beg you to do something
for us both. This is going to be a huge coup for me on February
4th, under the Medical Women's wings. Nothing would so add to it as
if you sent me a paper to read with my own. The title of the whole
thing is 'Sex and Eugenics,' or how to combine sane eugenics with a
fine spirituality. I shall include my 'Abnormal' article and, of
course, say other things I feel strongly about, but I want you to
send, to meet me in New York, on or about January 9th, a paper I
can read as from you and also any odd scraps and suggestions on my
own side. My lecture on 'The Loves of To-morrow' was heard by a
most intelligent audience; thirty people were sent away from my
lecture and seats were put in every spot. Men come to my lectures
and women doctors. They do love you so, in a genuine sense, so
write a nice and fine and glowing thing, chiefly for women. There's
a tendency here to pass laws on every blessed thing. Now I must
finish the <i>Craftsman</i> article which baffles me."</p>

<p>It was, I think, in response to this appeal that I revised and
completed the paper on "Feminism and Masculinism"* begun when we
were writing together under the beech tree at Stcnroell, with a
special eye to its effectiveness when spoken by Edith. It was duly
sent out in time, proved, I believe, to be what was wanted, and was
eventually published (1916) in my <i>Essay in War-time.</i></p>

<p class="footnote">[* "Masculinism" was, if I am not mistaken, one
of the numerous words which I devised (like auto-erotism) and
introduced into the language and which later became a part of more
or less current English.]</p>

<p class="quote">"Your three welcome letters are here, one by one,"
she wrote on 17th December, "and what a relief they are. The war
news yesterday made me feel very bad; four thousand miles is an
awful way and I just feel I ought never to have left. Do be careful
for my sake. God knows how anxious I shall be. It is horrible. I am
terribly overdone as I simply can't afford to spend what I ought to
have in food to keep me going at this pace. Those awful
interviewers wake me up at eleven at night and early morning. On
the whole they are not so bad, and of course it is getting me
notoriety (alas!) and work. I can't move out now but someone knows
me. I've earned £110, which is not bad in these war times, and
other things are to follow. The big coup is the medical paper. Send
me as your share to last at least twenty minutes and give the
scientific side of eugenics and sex. I'm lecturing, writing and
rehearsing for the plays in February. I think of you till I ache
and ache to see you. Oh! Havelock, go and stay with Amy if there is
a bit of risk, so that at any rate you will be together or with
someone. It is indeed hard to keep hate out of one's heart. It has
been bitterly cold here, snow always about, and below zero, but one
does not feel it like the English damp and cold. We must be in
California for next winter. Your <i>Impressions</i> is very much
loved here and so are you."</p>

<p>And she goes on to tell of her lectures and journeys:</p>

<p class="quote">"I return here to read my plays before the Drama
League of America, and the big lecture on February 4th. So far that
is all that is booked, and if no more comes I shall start for home,
but if more comes I shall stay longer. I just long, long, long to
see you, my Precious One, and I love you always."</p>

<p class="quote">"My sweetest Boy," she writes three days later,
"it is a horrible thing to be separated; the war news here seems
dreadful. A cable will bring me back at once, if it is possible to
come, if anything is wrong. There is bound to be an invasion, I am
sure, and they will do their worst. I should feel happier if you
were with Amy. I can only pray and wait and I seem to get a lovely
lot of letters from you. The miracle is happening with me. I can
scarcely find time to cope with all the wonders that are befalling
me. This medical affair on 4th February is to be a tremendous
thing. I begin by explaining Eugenics as the science of good
breeding in more than one way; it must include kindness and
consideration for those unfit who are <i>here,</i> etc.; leading
from this to responsibility of mothers and teachers to teach
<i>truth</i> about sex, etc. Yours will come in then on the social
and scientific need for eugenics, etc., and I shall move on to
abnormality and general laws of spirituality about sex and
eugenics, etc. There are one hundred prominent women on the
Committee. My photo (Genthe's) is to be posted everywhere (thank
goodness I shall be away for a time), and it is hugely advertised.
It will lead to far more work than I can do, but will book me up
for another time. I am splendid so far. Dear Dr. I told you of is
giving me electricity whenever I can get time to walk over to her
office, and she says I'm splendid. I am eating well now, as I was
getting very weak with doing so much and not eating. Dr. Lobdell
and Miss Cook (who are getting up this thing) come in often and
drag me down to dinner&mdash;cocktails and steaks and laughter.
'Mystics must be fed,' they say. I love my quiet room, but shall be
glad to see the real country again."</p>

<p>And she goes on at length to tell cheerfully of her movements
and the people she is meeting.</p>

<p>In the letters that immediately follow&mdash;I give but a few
sentences, for they are long and full of her constant movements,
her plans, her impressions of people&mdash;she is approaching the
climax of this American tour, and overflowing with the exuberance
of her delight in all the beautiful new experiences that were
coming to her. But one feels gradually creeping on&mdash;and I see
the significance of it better now&mdash;the morbid excitement of
the high-tensioned life around her; it was difficult even for her
energy and her delight in this new world to keep up with it; the
whirl was growing vertiginous, and her rapidly written letters,
with occasional almost unconscious repetitions, seem to reflect
that whirl.</p>

<p>She wrote on the 26th of December ("17 below zero and sun like
midsummer") from Wyoming:</p>

<p class="quote">"My darling Boy, how <i>did</i> you manage to get
me two long letters on Christmas Eve when I arrived, and two more
yesterday morning? It was a strange journey of 25
hours&mdash;Madame Schwimmer and I; she is so like Olive and we are
having wondrous talks. This is a <i>wonderful</i> house. I've never
imagined anything in the world like it. It is all new life to me in
the midst of all this horrible war and lust of killing.
Well&mdash;Lily was right&mdash;it is all opening. I stay here till
the 1st, when my dear Mrs. Ward takes me to a huge charity ball at
Buffalo, and the next day I go back to Chicago, the kind and
wonderful, to give my lecture (which I have re-written) on the 4th
on Olive...Oh, Havelock, my darling&mdash;this sun&mdash;this
life&mdash;this new world. I pray the fanatics may not induce war.
Thank you, my Love, for all your letters. They are such a relief
when one gets all this war news in the papers. Now I am off to my
bath and to dress and go in the snow. God bless you, my sweet."</p>

<p>On the last day of the year she wrote:</p>

<p class="quote">"This has been a lovely restful week for my body,
but oh! what heaps and heaps I've had to do. I ought to rejoice as
so many people can find no work, but I can't keep up. I am feeling
very anxious over the war news. They are all <i>mad.</i> I do pray
you will take care. To-night at seven will be your New Year and I
pray all will be well. Anyway, I am earning money at last...I shall
soon be out of debt at this rate, but of course the expenses are
pretty big. They have mended me up here and they say it is always
to be my home. It is the simplest and most informal and yet
dignified house I have ever been in. I am keeping pretty well, but
I run no risks. This climate suits me so much better than
England...I hope to send you something nice for your birthday. I
rarely buy anything. My one idea is to make and not spend, but I
found I was getting very weak for want of good food, so I am
careful of that now. I have been writing since five...It is so
wonderful to <i>never</i> feel an alien&mdash;always to be taken
for what one has tried to be."</p>

<p>New Year's Eve had ever been one of her great anniversaries,
full of tender and precious memories, but mails were uncertain and
no messages came from any loved ones.</p>

<p>From Buffalo she wrote on the 2nd January, amid the busy details
of her doings and her plans:</p>

<p class="quote">"I never had such an attack of homesickness as on
New Year's Eve. I am praying that after my long night journey
to-night to Chicago I shall find several letters there. I am indeed
in full swing now, three lectures this next week and four long
journeys. This awful news of the <i>Formidable</i> is here this
morning, and I am feeling I cannot bear the suspense of what is
happening day by day. Would you like me to throw up everything and
come home, or will you come out? It makes me sick unto death."</p>

<p>Four days later she wrote en route to Buffalo, whither she was
returning from Chicago to lecture:</p>

<p class="quote">"Here I am on the train to Buffalo. Oh! the rest
to be away from people. I've been nearly demented over you' Since
Christmas Day to <i>yesterday</i> I've not had a single line. I
began to lose my poise at last as I had letters from other people
by different mails. The relief made me just sit down and hold my
breath, and when I read about the little baby Havelock curl it was
almost more than I could bear. [This memento of my infancy, a
little brown curl cut from my head at the age of fourteen days by
my mother and found in my father's desk at his death, I had
forgotten in the stress of the last six years, and Edith forgot it,
too, but on searching in the desk I find it there still.] You know
in spite of work and being spoilt and all the rest, fits of
<i>awful</i> homesickness come over me at times&mdash;the longing
to be utterly myself and not be in the public eye. This is the
relief of being in the train, but even there now I am not quite
safe. When I arrived in Chicago Sunday morning I found heaps to do
and all the afternoon I had rehearsals, and who should speak to me
through the telephone but &mdash;&mdash; [a man who had meant much
to her more than twenty-five years before.] It quite agitated me,
especially when he informed me he had nearly been killed that
morning in a railway accident. The next day he came to see me and
it was the funniest feeling&mdash;a sort of conjuring
trick&mdash;the old and the young, smiling and struggling so
differently. Of course I made myself very nice and it was a long
time before he was himself. We compared many notes. He never
mentioned you, though I spoke of you in and out. My three plays
will be very beautifully done. The bathos of life! Chicago to be
the place to make me after all! If this lecture is a success they
are going to offer me about £600 a year to speak once a week there
for forty weeks in the year, going where I like; so that we could
live in a lovely little house about forty minutes away. But don't
hold your hair! I shall make no answer till I've been to you and
England...It is a mighty strenuous life, I was at it from five
yesterday morning till I got on the train at night at eleven, but
it is all under weigh now. I go to New York Friday night (the
nighttrain saves me hotel bill, and I love the rest and
freedom)...No copies of your <i>Impressions</i> to be got now in
Chicago, so you see what I've done! But you hamper me, I find, as
much as help me. People are afraid to have me at the Clubs. I
lectured on Olive to a crowded house on Monday and they said it was
'the sanest lecture on the woman question they had ever had.' I am
giving E's brother the £5 she lent me, so you see I am getting
things shipshape a bit. Tickets are going like fire for the 4th,
and one hundred of the finest women in Chicago, including Jane
Addams, will be on the platform. They say so much about my 'light
and help.' Funny, I'm only a babe. The woman doctor gives me
electricity, and I'm off and on but ignore symptoms whenever
possible. Money freedom I am determined to have. You may imagine I
am busy, but I love you and will give you a splendid time yet. Keep
my baby curl. I love it and you."</p>

<p>From New York, where she had arrived into a whirl of excitement
and confusion, she wrote, after a disturbed night, in a rapid and
occasionally rather incoherent letter:</p>

<p class="quote">"It is now four in the morning and the only chance
of quiet I see. I am really alone at last. I am very busy, but am
told I look very well. If only I had money to stay in a hotel here,
but that will come."</p>

<p>Then she speaks of a surprise party of a hundred people to meet
her, including Ruben Dario ("a celebrated Spanish poet who knows
you: he stammered all sorts of compliments often: said I was the
best interpreter he had ever had;" he, too, was lecturing and was
also to fall ill and die the following year.)</p>

<p class="quote">"Thank you for all your dear letters and advice.
My correspondence is now enormous. Oh! the joy of being away for a
few quiet hours from the American voice, and yet how kind they
are...Now good morning, my sweet Boy. I am desperately homesick at
times. I could never do all this in Europe."</p>

<p>This letter, like the others, is full of her doings, the
lectures she was giving, the people she was meeting, the articles
she was writing. Two days later:</p>

<p class="quote">"My word! Things are indeed coming at last. I
can't keep pace with them. I need to lie in a quiet field for weeks
to cool my head...Madame &mdash;&mdash; wrote and asked me to go
with her in her box to hear Christabel (Pankhurst) speak on
Wednesday. I went out of curiosity. It was all buttering of the
Americans and a vilifying of the Kaiser. Madame &mdash;&mdash;
shouted from the box; and I had hard work to keep my tongue, but I
did, when I heard people all round me call her Joan of Arc.
Yesterday Madame &mdash;&mdash; was at my lecture and called me
aside. I had been spotted in that box with her by some men from the
German Embassy here. My God! Havelock, they sent her to me to offer
me huge sums of money to follow Christabel and in discussions
oppose her&mdash;'the only woman who would be fair to both sides.'
I went deadly quiet&mdash;it made me see how wretchedly poor people
get caught. When I refused she tried other arguments. I said: 'What
I want to say will be because I've an unpaid mouth and because
condemnation on either side is to me as low as war itself.' She'll
try again, but I won't see her more than I can help. She is
dangerous, I fancy, but beautiful and intellectual. I think it
abominable to come to a neutral country and make strife."</p>

<p>By this time the little paper, "Masculinism and Feminism," I had
written for her to read at her great Chicago meeting, came to hand.
She had been eagerly expecting its arrival, and was delighted with
it, especially (as I knew she would be) with the words I had
contrived to introduce: "To Hell with your laws!" At the same time,
also, amid all her wild press of activities and excitements, she
found time to spend some trouble in seeing newspaper editors and
getting better terms than the agent could foi a little article I
had written on the war: "with my dearest love," she said, "and glad
to do you this good turn."</p>

<p>Letter swiftly followed letter, all full as ever of unalloyed
tenderness, of affectionate anxiety, the desire to fly home when
she heard of air-raids, swift notes of her journeys, of her delight
in Washington and her horror in Indianapolis, of constant lectures
and readings and interviews and meetings, of the interesting and
enthusiastic people she was constantly seeing, of her continuous
hard work, sometimes, in addition to all else, dictating for six
hours a day, and of her joy in it all and her hope of financial
success. Then, suddenly, on February the 4th, the day of the great
occasion in the Orchestral Hall in Chicago, to which she had so
long been looking forward, there was a change; the beautiful
tenderness, undisturbed for so many months, I might say so many
years, was ruined into irritability and querulousness and
resentment.</p>

<p>No doubt such a break was bound to come on the nervous side,
even if it had not been followed by a break on the physical side.
It had even occurred, as I have duly set forth, on her previous
visit, when the strain had been incomparably less, but a slight
break that time had quickly repaired and not the precursor of any
physical breakdown. Now the strain was in every way immensely
greater and more prolonged while the power of resistance was
diminished. It was marvellous that she had proved so equal to it,
that the energy of her spirit could carry through so triumphantly
her frail nervous system and her delicate constitution, still
further debilitated by the slow progress of disease.</p>

<p>Yet I have no wish to disguise the fact that, great as was this
accumulating burden, it was I who, innocently as I supposed, added
the last straw, if indeed it may not be considered a whole
bundle.</p>

<p>From the time that Edith left I had been living in retirement
and loneliness in my Brixton flat through the uncongenial London
winter climate, deprived not only of her society but, save for
occasional visits, also of Amy's, who was then fully occupied with
her own affairs. Here, it so chanced, there came to see me towards
the end of December, duly furnished with an introductory letter, an
American woman, a stranger alone in London for the first time in
consequence of trouble. I need not here describe her. She was not
unknown in her own country, but her name was quite unknown to me
though my books had been an influence and an inspiration in her own
work. To me as a person she had never given a thought, but the
author, it appeared, at once affected her as favourably as his
books. On me this first meeting simply left a pleasant impression
which, aided by sympathy with her lonely situation in a strange
city far from husband and children, induced me to invite her to
come again. The second visit sufficed to bring us into a
relationship of friendship, I may say of affectionate friendship,
later combined with admiration and gratitude, which has on both
sides continued to subsist during the following six years to the
present (now over twenty years), though during the greater part of
that time we have seldom met. An American of Irish origin, she
attractively united the good points of both nationalities. They are
not my English traits; she was quicker, more daring and impulsive,
than it is my nature to be. But we soon found that, both in
emotional attitude and mental outlook, we had much in common and
never jarred on each other. I had rarely known a more charming and
congenial companion and I had never found one so swiftly.</p>

<p>The relationship&mdash;I speak more especially concerning my own
attitude in it and she showed herself beautifully willing to accept
my attitude&mdash;was one of calm friendship, even though there was
a sweet touch of intimacy about it. There was thus no trace of
guilty consciousness to spoil its delight. It was not my habit to
practise deceit, but here I never even felt the need of secrecy.
Yet it was some weeks before I mentioned my new friend in my
letters to Edith. The reason was that I wished to feel sure first
about my new friendship. To form a friendship so quickly was such a
novel experience in my life, to firm any new friendship had indeed
so rarely, if at all, happened during the previous twenty years of
steady emotional equilibrium, that I needed to know first exactly
where I stood. That this new friendship could prove a shock to
Edith, who herself was constantly forming vivid new friendships, I
innocently failed to recognise even as a possibility. It had come
so naturally, so charmingly, so unsought, at a moment when in my
loneliness I needed it so much, without even realising that I
needed it, and it had come by so strange a chance in the person of
one who combined the qualities of two lands both so congenial to
Edith, that it seemed to me that I was forming a new bond with her
rather than breaking an old one. It thus came about that when I
once began to write about my new friend, I wrote about her in every
letter, so that it seemed to Edith my letters were all full of this
new friend. That was the way in which in some degree&mdash;to what
degree it is not possible to unravel&mdash;I innocently contributed
to the tragic procession of events which filled the following
eighteen months, and beautiful as my new friend was to me and
continues to be to this day, I have sometimes been tempted to wish
that I had not met her.</p>

<p>My honest stupidity was the result of abstinence. I have always
been in favour of frequent absences in love, and I even think that
a deep and real and vital love is scarcely otherwise possible. I
think so still. But we had never before been subjected to so long
an absence and one so complicated by distance. With people of calm
and solid character, like my father and mother, the constant
absences of nine months duration, through over thirty years of
married life, led to no difficulties, but I and still more Edith
were of different temperament. It had indeed often before happened
that a letter on one side or the other had, from impulse or
accident, contained a thorn, but a succeeding letter or telegram
had removed the thorn, which never remained to rankle. But three
weeks must pass before I could know the result of that letter and
in the meanwhile I had sent at least six more letters, each with
its thorn, and the wounds had grown too poisonous when at last I
realised and put forth my best efforts to cure them. It would have
been easy had I known at once; when at last I knew it was too
late.</p>

<p>By ill fortune it happened that the first letter reached Edith
just before the great day, so long anticipated, of her most
important lecture and the reading of my paper, at the Orchestral
Hall in Chicago on the 4th of February, precisely at the moment
when the accumulating physical strains and nervous exaltation of
her tour were at the climax. Her sense of deep love for me and of
spiritual communion in life and in death had never been so firm and
so unalloyed as during these months, and on this mood my letter
broke with a shattering blow. "If I lost Havelock," she had said
with largeeyed seriousness, I have lately heard, to a woman friend
in Cornwall some twenty years before, "the earth would rock." It
was absurd that my letters, which came from a heart so devoted to
her, should produce an earthquake, but in the exalted state into
which she had been wound up it now seemed to her that the earth
rocked. She said to me later in the year, using the words of Oscar
Wilde, that "every man kills the thing he loves," and that she had
been killed in March, referring, I suppose, to these letters,
though it was in February that she received them, March, however,
being the month in which, owing to additional physical strain, her
health really began to break down.</p>

<p>But all that month I was innocently continuing to pour poison
instead of balm into the wound I had without knowing it made. I
lived alone in my flat with my chief thoughts eagerly fixed on the
days when the American mail arrived, and my chief consoling
distraction lay in the occasional little excursions, usually to a
concert, with my new friend. To me a deep love which had grown ever
stronger through a quarter of a century of trials and proofs was
something far too solid ever to be shaken. My love was sure, and I
knew it was sure, just as I knew hers to be sure. But it was not
her nature ever to feel sure. She had a natural vein of suspicion,
and an intense selfdistrust which it seemed to her that past
experience had justified. So that when in letter after letter with
simple frank abandonment, such as I had always used to her, I
poured out the praises of my new friend, having nothing else of
interest to communicate, Edith was bewildered; her natural tendency
to doubt was fortified by the undoubted fact that such a sudden new
friendship was a novelty in my life; her own friendships had often
been just as sudden and warm, and I had never felt any need for
doubt or fear; but my nature, she probably felt, was different. She
took indeed the precaution of checking her own judgment by the
unusual course of showing some of my letters to the only intimate
friend she had in America&mdash;the friend who had been Lily's
friend&mdash;who remarked, as Edith later told me, that they were
"strange." That they may well have seemed to an outsider, as often
also Edith's own letters would have seemed to an outsider; we each
wrote only for the other's ey c. Unfortunately none of these
letters are extant to quote. It happened a few weeks later when
Edith was staying in an American house that the police came on some
mission; it had nothing to do with her, but in her nervous,
high-strung condition and with all the incalculable results of war
conditions in her mind, she hastily destroyed some personal
letters, including mine, which she thought too intimate for
strangers to see. She regretted this later, when I told her she
must be exaggerating the character of my letters, and I also regret
it. But I am well aware that she was right in the main, for I wrote
with freedom, strong in the security of a sense of loyalty,
though&mdash;such is the ingenuity of self-torture&mdash;that it
was for Edith the very fact that my new comradeship was of the soul
rather than of the body that made her feel she had been
dispossessed in my heart. I have not, and never had, any thought of
blaming her, nor even of suggesting that her impulse was
morbid&mdash;though it was certainly in part the result of her
nervous high tension and physical exhaustion&mdash;for Amy also
felt in much the same way, and with equal unreason. So many
applications are there of that oft-invoked saying of Pascal's that
"the heart has its reasons which reason knows nothing of."</p>

<p>My unfortunate letters, as I have said, began to reach her on
the eve of her great day. I had so little anticipated any evil
effect of them that I had not thought to guard against this.
Indeed, at first they seemed to have no evil effect. She wrote me a
long and sweet letter of six large pages on the morning of the 4th
of February, a little sadly but with no bitterness:</p>

<p class="quote">"My Darling Boy, Here on the great day of my
public life I awake at five and write my English letters, for never
am I alone now. I got all three of your letters and read them when
resting after my Turkish bath. Of course I got a fearful jump when
I realised there is another &mdash;&mdash;. If it makes you happy I
am glad, but somehow it is a kind of strange realisation which
makes it still easier for me to die. I <i>want</i> to die, and yet
I am at my zenith, and if I can only live two more months I shall
not die in debt. Everything is opening, as Lily
said&mdash;everything, but oh! the reporters and the chatter is so
very trying. Yesterday I spoke at a banquet of 600 men&mdash;such
fine men&mdash;at the Chamber of Commerce. It was a unique
experience. It is curious how I have felt a strange feeling about
you for some time&mdash;a realisation how it is a law of life that
a vacuum fills. Thank God someone has put life and joy into your
sad face...Be careful for I realise so much here how
hero-worshipping is like drug-taking. I've had to cope with it, and
even sometimes had to be brutal, in a way, as it is mawkish. A
curious aloofness from the world makes me feel sure that at last I
am nearer leaving it than I thought. Houghton Mifflin will soon
publish my plays. They are sweetly acted at the Little Theatre and
<i>The Pixy</i> is fine. Of course I'm pretty tired. I've never
worked so unrelentingly night and day as now. I've never time even
to put a button on or to think, but it is telling at last. I
lectured on Olive at the smartest Club here on Tuesday and they
went crazy over me; they have given me the run of their beautiful
Club: it is close by here and a great rest...I am terrified of
to-night. It is a huge hall, but my voice carries, even in a
whisper, almost all over it. They are all crazy over my voice.
Isn't it dear of these medical women? Dr. Lobdell takes the
chair...I wonder how you spent your birthday, Dear One? Which of
the &mdash;&mdash; came, or did they come in relays? Now I must
have my bath and my breakfast, go through my lecture, and then
dictate to any typist. After lunch I mean to cut off the telephone
and sleep. People say I look splendid. With my dearest love and all
tender hope for your happiness, Your Wifie. P.S.&mdash;I drank to
you and your new &mdash;&mdash; in a cocktail last night."</p>

<p>The lecture seems to have been an immense success. She gave me
no account of it, but sent the newspaper reports as she always did
of all her doings and her interviews. She had bravely wound herself
up to this greatest effort of her great adventure, but she was
evidently already showing signs of fatigue, for she told me once
how Dr. Lobdell had seen her beforehand, told her she needed a good
dinner, and took her off and gave it her. Directly after the
lecture, over a bottle of champagne, half a dozen prominent people
who were present wrote me kind greetings with loving and admiring
words about Edith on a single sheet of paper to which Edith also
put her name and a few words to her "sweetheart boy;" (she was
apparently going to write "baby"). She signed last, using, by a
strange mistake which she never observed, her usual maiden
signature, "E. M. O. Lees," which she had not used for over twenty
years. It was a revealing little indication of the nervous
disturbance which this life of high strain was producing.</p>

<p>She wrote, enclosing this sheet, three days later. In the
meanwhile more letters had come from me which seem somewhat to have
irritated her. These new letters were probably in the same key as
those that immediately preceded; they could have contained nothing
fresh about my American friend, for there was nothing more to tell,
then or later, and any wish to cause irritation was never farther
from my heart than at this time. The long letter she had written in
the early morning of her great day was a little excessive in its
reference to a desire for death, but it was always natural to her
to be a little excessive, and for the rest it was simply sincere,
affectionate, natural, with a touch of mischievousness, altogether
characteristic of her normal level. The effort of this lecture,
however, had evidently produced a profound reaction, and the
elasticity with which she was wont to recover from such reactions
could no longer be discerned. There is a note of exhaustion and
weariness now in her letters, a rather querulous, irritable tone,
for the first time since she left England, something more than the
old passing moods. In this letter of the 7th of February, she
dreads&mdash;a foolish fear, as she might have known&mdash;that her
secrets will be given to another woman; all the old apprehensions
and anxieties that accompanied, by no one's fault, the coming of
Amy recur to her mind and she recalls them because it seems to her
that perhaps they are coming over again.</p>

<p>A few days later she had regained much of her poise and saw
things in a juster perspective, though the details she gives of her
life showed how severe a strain she was putting on her already
over-strained constitution:</p>

<p class="quote">"My darling Boy," she wrote on the xoth with the
old tenderness, "I fear my last letter was not very bright. I had a
stupid feeling, in spite of all they say here, that those who love
me best are better without me so long as I am a money-earning
machine: you know it is a long time to be away from the old country
and you all, and often my heart gets very sore and sick: you see I
am not <i>really</i> strong enough to work like I am doing. Outside
the feasts people ask me to, I live more or less on things that I
cook for myself and that cost very little&mdash;my big room and
bath are my only extravagances. Well&mdash;the lecture came out for
me just £51 when all expenses were paid. You see the Hall and
advertisements and things cost just on a hundred, but it was a fine
advertisement and has led to many other lectures. I have opened a
little account in a bank here (if anything happens to me Dr. Efie
Lobdell will see to everything for you);"</p>

<p>and she goes on to give particulars of the various little
accounts she was settling in England.</p>

<p class="quote">"I am doing all I can and need no upbraiding. [But
there was never a touch of upbraiding nor any occasion for it.] I
am deciding not to come back yet. I vowed I'd get out of debt, and
I will; up till after Easter there are always openings here, and
now they just adore me, so I had better make the best of it while
it lasts. They are all wonderful to me. I spoke to 500 women at the
Dramatic luncheon the other day, and last night to zoo nurses at
the biggest hospital here, and to-morrow I speak in the
drawing-room of the tinned meat millionaire; I sat next the
President at the Dramatic luncheon and next but one to Christabel
Pankhurst: they go crazy over my voice. So you see I am hard at it
all the time. The intimate loneliness is pretty 'fierce' as they
say over here, but I mean to die in peace over debts. Sebastian
Hinton [grandson of James Hinton] dines with me on Friday and goes
to the plays. They are only on for a fortnight, but will lead to
other things; <i>The Pixy</i> is perfection, and the men adore it.
I have made several inquiries about M. [my new friend]. Some like
her very much and some say she needs balance. Greet her from me and
say I hope she will stay, and cheer and comfort you till I get
back. I am just eating bread and Bovril as I write, and I've been
writing since five. I've had to have a typist several days and have
dictated six hours at a time. It cost me 27 dollars, but it could
not be helped...Now I must stop. The home letters are <i>so</i>
welcome, but they seem to come so rarely. God bless and keep you,
my precious Boy. I think I am growing up at last. Chicago is a
terror of a place, but so wonderful too."</p>

<p>But three days later she writes sadly, feeling her loneliness in
the midst of the crowd, longing for the presence of "someone who
cares," and it seemed to her that I had ceased to care.</p>

<p class="quote">"I'm terribly busy&mdash;never so much in my life.
I am determined to stay till I am out of debt. The fact that I can
see you do not <i>really</i> need me is of course not making me
feel I shall hurry; but I just take a day at a time...The plays end
to-night&mdash;there was not standing room last night. To-morrow I
give a little dinner here to my company...I am very sad and lonely,
but I mean to do my job, and when all my debts are paid surely the
Jester can rest. I always speak nicely of you, but I shall cease
saying some things, as I've no wish to pose in America as a deluded
<i>wife.</i> I am almost beginning to hate my popularity. It is the
real beautiful intimate love I am craving, and every expression of
wonder and adoration here makes me long to go to Lily. I feel so
strange to be always impersonal. I feel sort of stunned as if the
'belonging' between you and me had got its death blow. I only want
to die because I feel in human nature there is nothing for me any
more&mdash;only in Nature and music."</p>

<p>The depression of that letter was in part due to an interval
without letters, for although they were sent with unfailing
regularity the mails were becoming irregular. Two days later she
wrote cheerfully once more:</p>

<p class="quote">"My darling Boy, your two letters are here at
last. I was beginning to have a sort of feeling I was dead and not
buried somehow. It takes so long to hear and I am so dreadfully
lonely in spite of all the worship here. I'm never in bed till 12
and at it at 6.30, so ought not to feel lonely. I could not do
one-quarter I do here in England. I love all you say and perhaps I
have exaggerated the situation with M. You see I'm a Tobias-Jester
and have been so badly hurt I am only longing always to die...No,
dear one, I did not want anything for placing the article&mdash;on
the contrary, shall I send you something for the use of the
'Feminism and Masculinism'? I thought I would use it again, and
then, if you like, place it here for you...I gave a little dinner
last night to my theatre company, as the plays are over, and they
loved it, and it was Valentine's Day and I felt very homesick. I
think sweetly and tenderly of you, and I love you as no one else
can do more. I envy you an Irishwoman."</p>

<p>The strain of this exacting life was telling on her
consitution.</p>

<p class="quote">"My Precious Boy," she wrote on February 24th,
enclosing a medical report of her condition, "I am afraid you will
be a little troubled at enclosed report, but I am sure I shall be
better when I get out of this terrible noise and rush. You see I've
been doing enough for seven folk, but I saw no other way nor do I
yet. I'm not here to sit and think about things but to do them.
Thank God&mdash;if anything happens, slowly and surely from here
results will come to you, and these wonderful people who really
care will help you. I have been very troubled over conditions of
the war, and somehow just terribly lonely in spite of all. I am
glad you are happy, I see it is all for the best and my only prayer
for so long has been to pay my debts and go. But I don't suppose
I'll go. I never do, do I?...Dear Mrs. Ward and Miss Westcott are
coming to Buffalo to take care of me, so you see I am in good
hands. The sun and fresh air will revive me at once. In this cheap
room I never see light all day. I just feel done. I am now going to
keep any money in Express notes, instead of in the Bank, so that if
anything happened you could get it at once...I'm only writing this
just to ease you in case I'm very ill. I've not known how to sit up
some days, but it's all right. Your letters have been so welcome. I
don't want you to worry. I do hope M. is out of trouble. People say
she is deep and sweet and good, and that is beautiful. Tell her
from me to take care of you always, and Amy too...Later. Having had
my bath, eaten my breakfast, and read my mass of letters, I feel a
warrior again in a way. The letters have partly done it. Someone
has told them in Washington that in an interview I said I was not
married. I wish I'd brought those 'Marriage lines' to upset them!
Oh! I'm <i>so</i> tired and feel, once I get somewhere beautiful
and quiet, I'll die as a sheer luxury. Of course my success has
brought on petty jealousies, and I'm confronted with such
absurdities all the time...Speen I shall see about later. But will
you care for it? I wonder? God keep and bless you always."</p>

<p>From Buffalo she continued to write me two long and tender
letters every week, as she had never failed to do however overcome
she might be by work and exhaustion.</p>

<p>She was a little easier at Buffalo, with more quiet and
sunshine. But there is a pathetic note continually being sounded
through all these brave and loving letters. She feels how serious
is the state of her health, she is not sure she will live to return
home, "the worship and understanding amongst all these people make
me almost want to live to repay it, but Tobias and the Jester long
to die;" the continual strain, the almost constant society and yet
no one with whom she could be her own natural unconstrained self,
the long hours and late nights&mdash;for one who loved freedom and
was accustomed to much solitude and liked to go to bed as early as
a child&mdash;could not fail to be destructive. "Oh, God! how I
pine for solitude!" she breaks out. "Interviews and journalism, and
incessant voices that clip-clap all day long: they are the dearest
people and the most generous in the world, but they never think you
want to be alone." She was being forced, moreover, to temper the
childlike unadulterated enthusiasm of her first impressions of
America. She was beginning to realise that her success aroused
jealousies and evoked injurious rumours and stimulated "the eternal
thirst for thrills in newspapers." She was a little disturbed at
the foolish report that she was not legally married, as it seemed
to be injuring her work, and, again, when an advanced young
journalistic woman whom she had befriended, but who thought she had
not sufficiently shocked the public, published an article on "Mrs.
Ellis's Failure." She was beginning to feel lonely amid the crowd,
and longing for home and for love, and yet tempted to feel that she
had no home to go to and no lover. It seemed to her that I was well
content and happy without her, and she scarcely realised that my
willingness that she should stay on in America as she herself
proposed was based in part on the glowing reports of her own
earlier letters, and in part on my belief that she was better there
than in the war-disturbed atmosphere of London. So reasonable an
attitude may well have seemed too temperate. In her impulsive
temperament, ever doubting and self-distrustful, it was not easy to
understand how near to her in heart I remained. "My darling Boy,"
she yet breaks out in the middle of one of the Buffalo letters,
"don't think I don't understand. I love you always&mdash;deeply and
more than you can ever have realised, but more and more I see how I
ought never to have been allowed to be born or to grow up. I'm a
waif and an alien."</p>

<p>The irregularity and long delays of the mails, for my letters,
though always faithfully despatched, now took about a fortnight to
reach her, was constantly unfortunate and almost tragic. The letter
that reached her was never the response to her immediate need and
mood, but to some experience of a month before which by this time
she had perhaps quite outlived. I realise how sound was the
instinct which had led her, in spite of all my obstinacy, to
persist in trying to persuade me to accompany her to America. She
needed me. My presence would have been a perpetual help and relief
to her. Moreover, all the germs of misunderstanding would have been
killed at the outset. But I had known well, as I know still, that,
even if it had seemed practicable, the life that she was living in
America would for me, with my totally different temperament, have
been an impossible life of torture, and that the seclusion which
she promised to secure for me would have been absurd in a land
where I was so well known by a reputation she was herself helping
to make more conspicuous.</p>

<p>The next letter (of March 4th from Washington) has had for me a
sad significance because I see in a little incident it
narrates&mdash;a little inevitable incident when travelling among
strangers&mdash;the last straw bringing breakdown to her exhausted
and over-strained organism.</p>

<p class="quote">"My Precious Boy," she wrote in this long letter
[marvellous how her love found time for these long letters, so
clearly and neatly written], "your two letters yesterday nearly
paralysed me. I expect in my tiredness I've hurt you and yet I've
never meant to. You know how lonely and mistrustful of myself I
always am, and somehow old memories <i>will</i> cling when I hear
of new women in your life, for women, I'm daily realising, are
maniacs over nntorieties. I'm pursued by it all here, and it makes
me adore Nod and Ricky and Tom [the cat, the donkey and the horse].
It is all right. I have no earthly right to feel or say a word. I
had actually posted you that newspaper where I said about loving
the woman one's man loves when, the day after, your letter about M.
came. I laughed and cried together. I hear a good bit about her
now&mdash;all think she is sincere but needs ballast...I've broken
down. That week in Buffalo with Mrs. W. was terrible. We were all
in rooms together, and the incessant voices and noise and
interviews, as well as five lectures in four days, has just sent me
crazy. How I ever got through only Lily knows...I'm longing,
longing to comfort you and the intolerableness of this dreadful
separation threatens sometimes to break me up altogether. We got
here in the worst blizzard I've ever encountered. Like all
millionaires, Mrs. W. saves pennies and gives pounds, and we
carried our hand baggage from one station to another. I refused
till she&mdash;76&mdash;began to take it, and then of course I took
up mine. When I got here everyone saw I was nearly done, for they
put me to bed, where I've been for two days with all my old aches
and pains for the first time in America: but don't worry, as I'm
well on the mend, and for two nights I've slept beautifully, but my
heart is pretty bad. I am going to send you a week-end cable for my
birthday treat to tell you I love you more than you have ever
known. I expect to be back the middle of May, but have an enormous
amount to do yet, though I seem to work day and night. There is to
be a big house-party to-morrow and I lecture on you! The clergyman
has even announced it from the pulpit. If I can help M. over here,
tell me. I wish you and I could somehow live in a quiet spot here
(and there are gorgeously beautiful spots within a reasonable
distance) and spend half the year here and half over there. If the
Germans win I could never live in Europe. So much here suits me.
Perhaps when M. is back you will feel differently about it. I've
the offer of a lovely cottage in the Adirondacks, if Fate keeps me
this side, but if so I shall fret myself to death...Love to A. and
tell them all to take care of you. Tell Olive the moment it is safe
to send it I am going to send her a cheque for her birthday and
bless her for me. Mine will be a queer one this year, but I am glad
to be here for it. Now, my Precious Boy, be comforted. I do not
mean to be cross or cruel or naughty. I am tired and in spite of
all very lonely for someone to hug me tight that I want. It's all
very well to be a prophet, but it's a damned lonely show."</p>

<p>On March 8th, the day before her birthday, that anniversary of
which she always thought so much, I cabled my greetings and love to
her, and at the same time she was characteristically cabling to me,
by way of giving herself a birthday treat, to say that she was
better and resting, "with tenderest love always and birthday
thoughts from me." At the same time she wrote a note to tell me
that she had really had a bad angina attack at Buffalo, but was now
very busy again with plans and correspondence though having with
her hostess a time of "<i>comparative</i> rest; she is so like
me&mdash;eternal energy and fuss and kills us all with plans all
day; but she is lovely."</p>

<p>The next day, her birthday, she wrote a long and more deliberate
letter, full of tenderness twined in with business.</p>

<p class="quote">"My Precious Boy, I wrote a hurried note yesterday
as the sleigh was waiting at the door, and now&mdash;on my
intimately lonely birthday&mdash;I write again. I've cried a little
in the early morning. Havelock, I'm really not very well, but I
suppose I would be worse in England. It is bitterly cold, and that
congests me, but the dryness is so splendid. The snow lies on the
ground and the birds are singing and the sun shining, and I am
lying in bed writing. I am waiting to hear of certain dates for
lectures, and then I shall know what to do. The mails are terribly
uncertain&mdash;it seems like a new death when I don't hear. I fear
you are angry with me and yet in my heart I resent nothing. All I
can say is that I've never felt myself since I realised a new love
in your life and yet it is not a bit jealousy. I think it is I am
dead sick of complications of all kinds, and of hard work and of
trying to leave you free of debt and also this life is very lonely
for the lover in me. The two new books and the book of plays will
ease my mind, as royalties will come in regularly...I shall come
back&mdash;mines or no mines&mdash;the moment I've done all I can
do. I make a new resolve to-day. After these books&mdash;<i>New
Horizon</i> and <i>Hinton</i> are off my chest, never more any
ethics or propaganda. If I live it shall be only drama and artist
work&mdash;nothing else...Your royalties ought to increase. So many
say they are buying your books after my lectures. I am so busy I
feel quite bewildered. I think it best to wait here till the hum of
everlasting voices and cities lull in my brain a bit. I've
perpetual headaches, but I'm used to those. They say it would be
dangerous to cross, but when I am ready I am coming, though in many
ways I feel you are more peaceful without me. <i>Later</i>.
Miracles and marvels! Your lovely cabled message has reached me. I
am sure that is M. who has taught you how to send it. My! how glad
I am to get it. The sun is radiant and I shall come home the moment
I see a free chance. To-day I have the proofs of my plays, so they
are coming out quite soon. I've heaps and heaps to do yet. I love
you always as you know, and I am struggling to live. Your own
Wifie."</p>

<p>On the very next day she wrote again to say that Mrs. Ward had
persuaded her to stay on and rest till her next lecture.</p>

<p class="quote">"It is good discipline, too, to live more simply
than the peasants in Cornwall, and never, even on my birthday, see
a small liqueur. The servants made a cake and set it covered with
little candles; they all love me."</p>

<p>In these letters, brought back to the familiar homely thoughts
aroused by her birthday, she seemed almost her old self again. Only
a few small points might need to be excepted as the outcome of
overstrain. Yet even they were part of her old self: exaggerated
fears, exaggerated hopes. More significant in its revelation of the
crushing blows&mdash;in themselves insignificant&mdash;that were
now disorganising her sensitive exhausted overstrung nature was the
following letter, written from Mrs. Ward's house on St. Patrick's
Day, a great anniversary with her on account of its association
with Lily. It is all the more piteous because even beneath its
distracted doubts and fears, justified or unjustified, there is
clear to see the deep ocean of love. Small points in the letter
remain rather obscure to me; it is evident that the sudden
realisation of the censorship and the incident (cautiously withheld
in this letter)&mdash;misunderstood, as she later
discovered&mdash;which alarmed her into destroying the letters had
induced considerable reticence:</p>

<p class="quote">"My Darling Boy, at the end of what was as unlike
a lovely St. Patrick's Day as can well be imagined your five
letters all at one time arrived. Thank God. M. [her chief man
friend in America] had sent me a lovely little shamrock plant, some
whisky in a little flask for my journey (as all in this New Thought
house would faint if they saw anyone drink), and a bottle of
wonderful Californian water which has already done me good. I have
been <i>very</i> ill&mdash;so ill that I cannot imagine why I did
not die. I should have left here long ago but for that. Everyone
seems to have had the grippe, or something. That is why I sent a
cable, knowing what the newspapers here are, and not knowing what
you might see. I broke in Buffalo, and I've had a lot to bear, as
Mrs. Ward, sweet as she is, has obsessions about thrift and is
forty times more restless than I am, so that her own family cannot
stay here lung, and those around her are mostly self-interested. I
am very sorry, for I really care for her. I wish you would write
her a little note of thanks for all her kindness to me. Yesterday
morning when I woke I wrote long letters to you and to Y, and later
thought it wiser to burn them and all the letters you both have
sent me. The thing I have dreaded ever since you wrote of M. has
come. I have never been well since you told me, but thank heaven
you did. All the time I have felt forebodings of the Bedborough
Case atmosphere. X sent me enclosed, but thank goodness I casually
mentioned M.'s friendship with you when he was here, having also
heard about it among the Socialists in Buffalo. [The enclosed was
an innocent&mdash;but meaningless&mdash;little newspaper cutting
incidentally mentioning that M. was working with H. E. in London.]
When no letters came, all this time I've been so ill, I was
frantic, knowing so well what can be made of things here. Then
imagine what I felt yesterday when H. [an old American friend in
New York] wrote that the Censor had not only forbidden a silly
baby-cable for St. Patrick's Day to Y. but demanded to know its
inner meaning. She seemed very agitated and said there was no
knowing what they would do. I dragged myself out of bed, dressed,
and burnt all your letters, as M.'s name has been in all lately;
and I thought it better, in case I die&mdash;for I've had about
enough to kill two of one sort or another&mdash;to destroy all
letters I had here, not because of anything that mattered, but
because of newspaper gossip which will overpower me, I know, and
make it impossible for me to come again. I still feel that you do
not realise that the adoration of these women must be taken in a
different way to what we are used to, but it is all too late and
you have probably been hurt at what you think is my jealousy. It is
not that&mdash;it is soul and heart and body weariness of perpetual
everlasting crucifixion...We can have Speen cottage till end of
June. I shall want to be with Y. a little while. She is very sweet
and beautiful, and if only I could trust anyone or anything maybe I
could get joy out of it; but things have hurt too badly I fear, and
like Tobias I only want Love-Acre. Poor little M., but she can't
grumble; she is only paying her price, as we all do. The unbearable
loneliness in this illness has been awful. I was amazed at my
courage in staying, yet what could I do? When I get to New York I
will try to place your various papers. I have at last finished my
long article on war and one to give later as a lecture at
Washington. I am going to a wonderful doctor in New York at once
about my heart&mdash;it is so very painful. Here it is bitterly
cold and deep snow on the ground...I can't imagine what it will be
like to be in an orchard at Speen...You will be missing M. and be
very anxious about her. I wish I could say nicer things but I seem
always to say the wrong one. I am going to entirely reorganise my
life when I return so that I need never be a burden on you or
anyone. Money alone can do this and I must make it. Y. will come
over with me if' have to come again, but there are signs this last
fortnight that the tide is turning. And now we shall be dubbed
'free lovers.' It does not really matter&mdash;nothing does. But in
face of my serious condition and exhaustion I shall probably prefer
the wilderness and not attempt the impossible against overwhelming
odds. I shall probably know next week the dates of my final
lectures and book my passage, but I've heaps to do yet. My plays
will be published by Mifflin on April 24th, under title <i>Love in
Danger,</i> then there will be the Cornish Stories to get into
shape, and the lecture book too [probably <i>New Horizon,</i> not
published in her lifetime]. Then I am going to try to get the plays
on in New York. Don't think unkindly of me, Dear One. I am sad and
terribly spent and want freedom; and money alone will bring it, and
I've not health to make it and enjoy doing it. Always the fear of
breakdown. I shall try now to get a few well paid lectures in
England. I just hold you to my heart and love you always, and am
sorry if my pride or pain cannot support all things at all times.
Your Wifie."</p>

<p>I have reproduced this letter in all its significant passages.
It is altogether characteristic of her in times of trouble with its
swift transitions of subject and mood and throughout its firm
underlying devotion. Here and there it may be a little unjust to
me, a little unreasonable. But I am not concerned to justify
myself. I only feel her "unbearable loneliness" which I know that I
could have comforted, as so often in times of trouble before. I
still do not see how I could have gone to her. But in any case, I
have certainly, to use her own phrase, "paid the price."</p>

<p>I am bringing forward in detail those more intimate relations on
which my private thoughts and feelings were concentrated. But I do
not wish to suggest that these were visible to the outsider or even
that they interfered with the general course of my literary and
other activities in the world. I may say indeed that I had never
been more busily occupied than I was at this time, nor do I think
that at any time my work was of better quality. I was writing
essays which were later to take a prominent place in my books, the
<i>Dance of Life</i> and <i>From Rousseau to Proust,</i> and I was
writing those <i>Impressions and Comments</i> (the First Series was
published in 1914) in which my literary style is supposed to have
reached its highest point. In a different field it was in this year
that the final much revised and enlarged edition of <i>Sexual
Inversion</i> was issued. I was also producing a number of mostly
short articles suggested by the war in progress and appearing
immediately in the best English or American journals (many of them
later in two volumes of <i>Essays in War-Time</i>) never of a
pronounced "patriotic" character, though on the other hand they
could not be considered definitely "pacifist."</p>

<p>My correspondence with friends and acquaintances went on, I
believe, much as usual, though it is not easy to produce samples in
proof. But I may refer to the letters addressed during some forty
years to my friendly scientific acquaintance&mdash;carefully
preserved and docketed by him and returned to me by his son after
his death&mdash;and I find a few of this date. He was an ardent
Rationalist, and various points I now omit in my letter were
connected with queries of his, now scarcely intelligible, connected
with his own work. My letter is dated January 6th, 1915:</p>

<p class="quote">"My dear Perrycoste, yours to hand. I have
wondered how you are occupied these times and have once or twice
been on the point of writing to you. Somehow I have always been
extremely busy (in spite of the fact that the general depression of
course affects the sales of my books) and of late also private
affairs have required much attention, in consequence of the death
of my father, at 87, in full possession of all his faculties; I was
pleased to note that he accepted the coming of death quite
cheerily, being willing to go, he said, as he had 'had a good
innings.' In spite of his traditions no humble reliance on the
Blood of the Saviour! In saying that his affairs have taken much
time to settle I do not mean that there is any 'estate' to speak
of, for he lived on a pension and left five children...I am glad to
hear you are making progress with the <i>mag. op.</i> I rapidly
read with much interest the first volume issued, and should like to
see the rest. The difficulty with me is that I can find so little
time for reading. The spirit indeed is willing, but after all the
unavoidable work is accomplished for the day the flesh is
weak...Some time ago you sent me a card asking about Ferrars [a
British Government official retired from Burma and occupying a
teaching post in Freiburg University, who under the name of 'H.
Hamill' had published a pioneering book <i>The Truth Tie Owe to
Youth</i>]. I have since had a message from him indirectly. It
appears that the war broke out before he had left Freiburg where he
remains, able, I suppose, at intervals, to witness the
bomb-dropping prowess of the Allies. I was in the National Gallery
this morning. Formidable protection precautions have been adopted
therewith timber and water and sand&mdash;not to mention that all
the best pictures have been stored away.&mdash;My wife is in
America lecturing. Notwithstanding the depression there she is
successful and the climate suits her. On account of her absence I
am spending the winter in London, and am thus able to bear
heroically the absence of that anti-cyclonic weather which is so
delightful in Cornwall and so appalling in London. All such good
New Year's wishes as may be possible!"</p>

<p>The next letter to Perrycoste is dated April 8th and deals with
a forthcoming book of his which he had sent me in proof and which I
describe as "vigorous and stimulating.</p>

<p class="quote">"I am in complete agreement with your main
propositions, though personally I view most of these questions from
a slightly different angle. I should myself be inclined to say that
you overrate morality, which I regard as simply conformity to the
ever shifting <i>mores</i> of the moment, and underrate the
importance of religion which is the expression of the fundamental
emotional nature. The importance of the religious emotions (as of
the sexual emotions) may be measured by the obvious magnitude of
the harm they incidentally wreak.&mdash;I am rather surprised you
never mention Salornon Reinach's <i>Orpheus</i> which seems to me
the best (and most authoritative) history of religion on a
free-thought basis. I think Marett's book on primitive religion
quite enlightening. You seem to me to overrate Petrie who is
first-class as an Egyptological explorer but very lacking in broad
and judicial vision when he begins to <i>discuss</i> things. I
entirely share your admiration for Lecky. But how&mdash;oh
how?&mdash;can you leave out of consideration Westermarck who in
his masterly <i>Origin and Development of the Moral Ideas</i> has
long and carefully documented chapters on 'The Belief in
Supernatural Beings,' 'Duties to Gods' and 'Gods as Guardians of
Morality'"</p>

<p>The next letter, of April 18th, is largely a continuation of the
same discussion:</p>

<p class="quote">"I rather fear that your distinction between an
absolute and eternal morality, which you accept, and the general
<i>mores</i> of all the world is suspiciously like the
religionists' distinction between their own absolute and eternal
religion and the religions of all the world. I don't myself admit
the existence of any rigidly absolute and eternal morality, but
regard all morality as a matter of relationship, as I set forth in
an article on the 'Art of Morals' in the <i>Atlantic</i> last
year."</p>

<p>Then in response to my correspondent's request for the loan of
Ripley's <i>Races of Europe</i> I reply that I should be pleased
but can only lend it for a few days as I constantly need to refer
to it for its bearing on my next book on European psychology, which
however was never completed.</p>

<p class="quote">"My darling Boy," (Edith wrote on March 22nd) "Oh!
it is so wonderful to be in New York again and yet and
yet&mdash;all seems so different now. I travelled from 9 in the
morning to 7.20 at night and loved the solitude and the beautiful
scenery. Mitchell and Bliss Carmen met me and dragged me off to a
good dinner, and I came to the National Arts Club and slept like a
child...I had a nice shock the day before I left Wyoming. A
detective in plain clothes arrived at the house and everyone got
very excited. I set my teeth and realised that it was worse I'd
burnt those harmless letters than if I had kept them. He had come
to arrest one of Mrs. Ward's servants about the stealing of a
watch!! But my precious letters have all gone. However it is best,
for if I died the curiosity in this America would raise my body!
The Socialists have got hold of your helping M., and Mrs. Ward even
asked me if I'd show her just one of your letters. You see, we're
both thought to be free-lovers, and she wanted to see if you really
cared for me!! If, as I shall be, I am badgered by interviewers, I
shall say my work is not in that range and that I believe in free
speech, but I do not believe in defying laws except by trying to
alter bad ones into good ones. They all think I look very
changed&mdash;Genthe and Mitchell and Miss Tarbell&mdash;but I'm
going to do my best to live. The pain in <i>my</i> heart and
rheumatism is more than I can bear, so I'm going to see a doctor
to-morrow...All the vulgarity of those dreadful old days and the
Bedborough case is coming back. You, shut up in your flat, can't
realise what, it is to be trying to do mystical and lovely work,
and then to be faced by things like that where to escape intrusion
is impossible. You did not mean it, and I know would not have done
it for the world&mdash;it is only the invariable truth that 'all
men kill the thing they love.' I fear the gossip has done for me.
It is as in a flash this shadow has come, and it is no use saying
'why can't people see?'...I will leave details till I come. I have
no heart or strength to write long letters. You see you don't see
<i>what</i> I mean. It is not you have ceased to care&mdash;it
is&mdash;well, just what it is, and perhaps only a woman knows what
that is...That you cannot see it is the comedy&mdash;that I do is
the bathos and the pathos in one. However, love remains, if it is
love, whether it wears a veil or has its finger to its nose. God
keep and bless you in this new thing and may she make up for all
our failures. Your comrade who loves you."</p>

<p>In all the contradictoriness and contrariety of this long
pathetic letter, from which I reproduce a few characteristic
passages, one sees the expression of an organism over-sensitive and
overwrought and almost altogether distraught. Forms of terror are
evolved from little or nothing. The detective's mission becomes
personal to herself, the naive American inquisitiveness becomes an
attack on her character and work, and the pleasant friendship I had
so innocently confided to her became a 'new thing' that is to fill
all my life to the exclusion of herself and everyone else.</p>

<p>The next letter, written two days later, shows how these
hobgoblins of the mind spring from a profoundly injured physical
body, and, as ever, she at once began to respond to treatment.</p>

<p class="quote">"My darling Boy, I am being saved by the skin of
my teeth. These lovely New York friends have just seen and realised
and not a moment has been lost. I've had an introduction to Dr.
Northrop the oxygen specialist&mdash;old Henry Irving took it every
day he was acting here, and Julia Marlowe, and all sorts of people
have kept well through it. Two treatments have eased me to bear
agony in my heart. It has brought life to my face and eyes again.
Then the (free) hair and scalp treatment daily&mdash;for they say
the roots are being killed&mdash;by the greatest specialist in the
world is a bit restoring it, and doing my awful headache good.
'What does not kill you strengthens you.' I am re-valuing once
more, and as I do it I get news that another of my great rocks has
slipped out to sea. Mrs. Drake [the early friend who had come to
the rescue when she broke down as a schoolmistress thirty years
before] was dying when they wrote. Somehow I feel what I want most
is a little ease from physical torture and mental sadness and I am
getting a new strength once more, but I can't travel yet, and
anyway I've far too much to wind up and do...Everyone here is so
good. I am being helped and it is heaven after hell. It has all
sobered me and changed my outlook, and I see the way to walk very
definitely. Life is one damned thing after another, and one's
dreams are one's only realities...God bless and keep you and may
life give you what you need most. My love ever. Your comrade from
beginning to end."</p>

<p>One feels in that letter not only the exhaustion of disease and
overstrain, but also the inevitable reaction from the exuberance of
the first contact with America to what was, after all, a more sober
attitude in spite of the delusions that had been mixed up with the
process of reaching it.</p>

<p class="quote">"My darling Boy," she wrote on March 27th, "I got
your letter much more rapidly this time. Oh! how much good it did
me! I had just heard of the beautiful death of the mother and it
soothed me as nothing but Love-Acre and music can. She said good
night at six and slept without a struggle or even a murmur. It is
as if my deepest foundations are passing to newer spheres...To me
<i>you</i> are the amazing revelation. You will be glad to hear I
am being saved but it has been a very near thing. Dr. Northrop who
gives me the oxygen says I must take it without fail every day for
a month at least. The heart has been in as much pain as years ago
at Carbis, and the specialists say my poor head-scalp was as tight
as a billiard ball. No wonder I've had all these dreadful
headaches. No one will ever know what I have endured before I
broke, both in mind and body. Work to me is a help and a
stimulant&mdash;it is the other things...About the cottage [at
Stanwell, which had unexpectedly been required by the owner, so
that our furniture had to be removed.] I am so sorry you have been
worried, but my directions were plain with Mrs. Mole's place or a
safe locked store-room, but Mrs. Rogers alone knows how to move the
things as Lily's picture, etc., must be carefully moved. I ought
not to have troubled you at all. You need not worry over me.
Whatever happens I've friends here who will nurse me. I am trying
to nourish myself, but somehow I seem to have lost care, but it
will all come back I guess. The spring always tires us all. With my
tender love and do not get too entangled in difficulties, your
tired old comrade."</p>

<p>For a long time there have been no letters from me to quote.
Their absence I have already explained. The answer to her letter of
March 27th is the first she preserved after this gap, and so it may
be brought in here. It is slight but its tone is that of all my
letters:</p>

<p class="quote">"My darling Wifie, I have been to dinner at
Smith's [I and Barker Smith, who had recently lost his wife, at
this period invited each other to dinner on alternate Sundays at
his home and my flat, the meal here being entirely prepared by me]
and then by myself to a Queen's Hall Concert, and now I write a
little letter to you, as in the rapid letter I wrote to catch the
mail on Friday I had not time to comment on all the points in
yours. I was very relieved that you approved of storing the things
at Shoolbred's. But why do you think I found it a 'trouble'? I was
very glad to arrange it for you, and even if someone else had
arranged it I should still have been equally concerned. I had
specially told Mrs. Rogers that care has to be taken of the
picture...Yesterday was a very fine day, and I went with Amy for
three hours into Buckinghamshire for an enjoyable little walk to
two charming villages. The sunshine was beautifully warm but we
could not find any primroses in the woods yet. I keep very well
(though one is still surrounded by colds and coughs) and always
busy. I often lie awake at night thinking of you, and looking
forward longingly to your return. I hope to hear you are feeling
much better. Take care of yourself, Precious One. I wish you knew
how much you mean to me. Always your loving H."</p>

<p>It is a simple letter and calm, perhaps too calm in face of her
pain and agitation. But it had become my part in life always to
remain calm in face of her agitation and so to seek to soothe her
pain, knowing that that pain was likely to pass swiftly away. I had
not yet realised that she was now reaching a point where the
strength to throw aside the burdens which her organisation placed
on her was itself swiftly passing away.</p>

<p>The four letters that follow were written by Edith during the
acute period of a serious attack of throat ulceration, which was
not rapidly subdued even by the devoted care of physicians and
friends. I note in all these letters that, as so often occurs
during an attack of acute physical illness, all her nervous doubts
and suspicions disappeared, the old familiar outlook was restored,
and there was nothing but love and tender forethought.</p>

<p class="quote">"My darling Boy," she wrote on April 2nd, "my
heart aches and aches to see you. I'm very ill&mdash;a dreadful
throat with a temperature of 102 and the least exertion makes me
worse. We hope I shall be all right in a few days as this morning I
am better than last night when the ulcers burst...Somehow I've
never recovered and I'm worried and distracted over the war and you
and all sorts. Of course this is taking my money, and no more
lectures except Chicago are coming in. I sail if all is well on May
7th but I'm beginning to wonder if I shall ever get back. It has
been too great an adventure, and those shocks and things threw me
back. I need no more discipline...I can't write more. If I've hurt
you I'm sorry for I love you so very much and feel like you that
when we are apart it is like a child alone. I feel utterly
desolate. Bless you always, my own one."</p>

<p>The next three are in the same tone, and detail the course of
the illness. It suffices to quote a few lines from each:</p>

<p class="quote">"I'm still very ill, so ill they've nearly taken
me to a Hospital but I know I'm getting better...You need not
worry. Dear Mrs. Edward Brown (Miss Margaret Wilson's cousin,
through whom she has come to me) has a room next to mine for day
and night nursing; she is a born mother and nurse and oh! what she
has been to me in these dreadful nights. She says I am a little
warrior, and she will be here till Mary Prendergast takes her room,
to be secretary and nurse. All my plans are at sea, but I know that
probably I shall live to cross over and suffer again and again.
I'll send a cable when I'm out and about, but it will be some days
yet. They say strain and debility has brought it. <i>Don't
worry</i>. No letters from England for nearly a fortnight and an
awful blizzard raged when I was at my worst. If I go to a hospital
I shall tear up all letters and see all is packed up safe, but I
<i>know</i> I am to be better again. I love you and will cable at
week-end if possible...Well, my Boy, the greatest throat specialist
in New York has had to be sent for, after eight days of incessant
agony in the throat, he has been twice and says it is being under
par and he should imagine shock. He cut deep and I bore it bravely
at the times he gave no anaesthetic, but collapsed later and not
even oxygen pulled me round for a long time. He says I must give up
lecturing and journeys for some time...It is all
sad&mdash;sad&mdash;and no wonder I half dread coming back to new
complications. I'm as weak as a child so forgive more. I can't help
feeling this is the finish and almost hope it is. I'm old now and
can't start life all over again...The worst is over as I've had an
hour's sleep without choking and pain. Now it is a question of
convalescence if no collapse comes...I crawled off to the
specialist to-day and he finds the throat very evil yet but thinks
there may be no more ulcers. Forbids me to speak publicly for ten
days, so I've had to give up practically all. I sail on the 8th by
the <i>St. Anne's</i> or the <i>Philadelphia</i>. I don't feel I
shall ever reach England but you know who has charge of my things
here. My love ever."</p>

<p>At this point a letter of mine is preserved. It scarcely seems
to show an adequate sense of the serious character of her illness,
but I was always upheld by the slowly accumulated experiences of
her acute illnesses in the past and her swift and wonderful
recuperative powers. I had not realised, and never realised even to
the end, how these powers were being undermined by disease.
Moreover, although my love was doubtless more firmly resistant to
the attacks of accident and mood than hers it was not in my nature,
as it was in hers, to feel the acute sudden poignancy of love in
emergency, or perhaps even to respond to it adequately when
presented to me.</p>

<p class="quote">"My own darling Wife," I wrote on April zoth,
"your three letters of the 5th, 8th and 9th have all arrived during
two days, and tell me how bad you have been with that awful throat
and that you now seem to be recovering. Of course I still feel very
anxious and long to get later news. I do trust you will be able to
convalesce nicely, and wish you were leaving earlier as the rest
and peace of the voyage at this lovely time of the year may do much
good. And I trust too, you will have no worries, financial or
other. You speak of fearing complications over here, but do not say
what they are, not serious, I hope. That blizzard you mention seems
to have been a bad one; I hear of it in a letter this morning (from
Maine) as one of the worst ever known. We have been having the most
lovely spring days lately, but the spring is late; no wild
primroses yet out near London or (I hear) in Buckinghamshire yet.
Those I enclose [one remains yet in the letter] came from Cornwall.
It is so delicious to feel the approach of spring, and all one's
cares would melt away entirely if only I felt assured that you were
well and flourishing. I am keeping you company with a bad cold in
my head and on my chest, more bronchitic than any I have ever had
(getting old!) but I don't feel ill in myself though a little
tired, and easily get about. Otherwise I go on quietly as usual, as
when you left, except that now I have the joy of looking forward to
you and the spring. I take out your new photos sometimes to look
at, but they make me long too much to see you and hug you. There is
no news at ail here. I have not heard from M. for nearly a
fortnight, nor seen her for nearly two months, but suppose she will
be back to London soon for a little while. Nice if Speen proves
possible. I am always thinking how lovely to be with you there. I
am now going to sit in the Old Garden. Good-bye, my Precious
Darling. Your always loving H. I always feel so grateful to the
dear people who are looking after you so nicely."</p>

<p>I reproduce this letter in full, for the tone of it, without any
doubt, is that of all the letters that are missing.</p>

<p>On the 15th she had written from the Hotel Flanders:</p>

<p class="quote">"This, my darling Boy, is only a line. I'm
convalescing but I'm terribly weak. Poor me! I just seem unable to
face it all. I'm moved here to be near the throat-specialist for a
week or so. The only thing now is to get strength at a minimum of
expense. Try not to worry. I try, but I'm in hell with those old
nervous feelings and the worst weakness possible, and the noise in
New York is <i>awful.</i> I'll try and cable, but I've no money now
and it has been a fearful time. I love you ever.&mdash;Oh! this
ghastly war.&mdash;I've written for Speen Cottage. Try not to
worry. I've done my best and any way I feel you are safe. My
Dear&mdash;I fear I've hurt you and yet I've suffered so and my
heart seems broken. Your own Wifie."</p>

<p>Next day she writes, for once not dating the letter but the
post-mark is of the 16th:</p>

<p class="quote">"My Precious One, just a line on receipt of your
lovely letter. Oh! God! have I hurt you and I love you
so&mdash;such a love and yet I seem to have hurt you and you me.
I'm trying to recover. If I had had this break on the ocean I
should have died. I've never felt so ill&mdash;never&mdash;but I'm
struggling on. Yes,&mdash;my poor brain has been tired and I feel
no use in the world...We will pitch our tent together, my Love, and
let no one hurt us. Save money and I will come here once more to
finish all debts and you perhaps with me. Deep down I am so close
that <i>nothing</i> can take me away&mdash;not even death."</p>

<p>There was nothing more until the 22nd and then she sent a cable
from Brookline, Mass.</p>

<p class="quote">"Convalescing with Dr. Keisker, tender love."</p>

<p>mdash;to which I believe I cabled a reply&mdash;and on the same
day she wrote:</p>

<p class="quote">"My own Precious Boy, Oh! Child!&mdash;oh! my
Darling&mdash;I'm aching and aching but you are suffering and in
despair. At last I am with Dr. Laura Keisker and her sisters in
their lovely home here. [Dr. Keisker had been a correspondent of
mine for some twenty years.] They want you to come but I know you
can't. Get M. and Amy to see to you, and cheer up. I'm trying to
get strong. I've had a brutal and horrible attack, and the
complications, and I was nearly alone in the hotel at last.
Mitchell has been divine. I would have died but for him, and he
persuaded me to come here and got me somehow on the train. It was a
terrible journey, but I've relaxed and am in bed in a wonderful
room and such weather, but I toss over you all the time&mdash;lest
I've hurt you. My Pet&mdash;it was just that eternal belonging
which made me feel the foundations of the deep were gone when you
seemed to have gone. I love you so, and maybe my illness and
tiredness broke me up. I can't write much&mdash;I'm terribly
weak&mdash;terribly. [There is an irregularity in the handwriting
of this letter, though it remains dear, never seen before.] There
is nothing to do but to lie and sleep and relax and give in:...My
plays are published here this week&mdash;if only I could have borne
up to speak at the Dramatic League and Chicago. Oh! Havelocki let
us come and live over here one day."</p>

<p>I never took seriously this invitation to go across to America,
which also came, I think, in a letter from Dr. Keisker. I regarded
it as a kind formality on the part of Edith's hostesses and in my
replies I seem not even to have meitioned it. The crisis appeared
over, the date of departure was close ahead; so that even if I
could overcome the practical difficulties, the journey seemed
useless. I never supposed that though there was no emphasis in the
invitation, they really were anxious that I should come over to
take the respons ility of bringing the invalid back, an invalid
whose convalescence was by no means so advanced as her letters
seemed to indicate. Perhaps&mdash;in spite of that "They want you
to come, but I know you can't"&mdash;perhaps I failed here. And my
heart contracts at the thought that if the positions had been
reversed she would never have failed me. Long before she would have
begged, borrowed, or stolen the necessary money, and flown across
to my side. But I know, and she knew, that my nature and my
devotion were not of that impulsive kind. Once, once only, on her
return, she gently referred to my neglect to respond to that
invitation, without any reproach. I made no defence. But I
understood then that the issues had seemed graver on that side than
I had realised on this side.</p>

<p>It was a week before the next letter, the last from America, was
written. It is dated April 29th:</p>

<p class="quote">"My darling Boy, I'm dreadfully weak and ill yet.
I shall of course sail on the 8th if able, and you'll get a cable,
but I'm not fit to face anything. Dear&mdash;send Lily's picture
when you can to T.&mdash;it is safer there. The things at
Shoolbreds will furnish a flat for you, and Amy and M. if I die,
but I don't suppose I shall. I never do. All this cruel illness has
taken my strength and money, and Failure is in my brain and heart.
Dr. K. and all are so good but it is no use&mdash;I've endured the
unendurable. Oh! Havelock&mdash;if stupid interviews are in the
papers they are cooked up from last year. All sorts of things are
wanted from me next year but I'm having to let them slip. You will
upbraid but I've done my <i>uttermost</i>&mdash;every way. Last
night was the first real long sleep. The quinsy poison got in me
and I was forlorn and lost in New York, as people were afraid of my
throat. Hell&mdash;hell&mdash;hellit has all been. Mitchell has
been divine&mdash;just divine&mdash;he got me here
somehow&mdash;will send my forlorn person across to you&mdash;for
what? Oh! Havelock&mdash;Havelock darling&mdash;I feel that the
foundations of the deep have gone if you are merged in someone
else. I've never recovered it&mdash;and yet I'm glad of it in a
great way&mdash;glad you've someone to help and comfort you. I've
done my uttermost...I've had grippe, quinsy, etc. and <i>had</i> to
get about too soon. They want me to stay on till I'm better. I
don't know anything&mdash;I'm too ill to worry and yet I worry all
the time. I love you always and belong&mdash;if only, only I could
see you and be comforted and blest&mdash;your own Wifie."</p>

<p>Well indeed I knew that attitude, so inconsistent, so wrong, so
natural, so childlike. I knew that my arms alone could soothe her
to peace, and perhaps have saved her. I knew it was the moment when
she needed me most, and the whole ocean lay between us. Well may
she have found my eyes sad, sad with a prophetic inextinguishable
sadness, when we gazed so long at one another across the gangway at
Tilbury.</p>

<p>When this letter reached me the 8th of May had passed and no
cable came to tell me of her departure. I grew restless and wrote
again. The letter came back following her and only reached her some
weeks after her return. She preserved it. Here it is; so few of my
letters of this period have survived that it may be well to
reproduce it in full:</p>

<p class="quote">"My ever darling Wifie, I have been restlessly
awaiting cable to say you sailed on Saturday, and it has not come,
and so I suppose I must conclude that you have not left. I shall be
very anxious until I hear from you, but in the meanwhile it is
better to chance another letter to New York. The <i>Lusitania</i>
was a great shock to me, more than anything that has happened in
the war, and all the more as the news came on the very day you were
to sail. If, however, you were coming on the American Liner it does
not mean any real risk to you, and in any case all sorts of
precautions will now be taken. However you will doubtless do what
seems best, and I only wish you could have left a little
earlier.&mdash;I had your sweet and pathetic letter of the 29th
yesterday and am so sad that you still feel weak and depressed. Of
course you need not feel depressed; you have had great success, not
'failure.' In the same way it is of course quite ridiculous to
refer to me as 'merged in someone else'; I can't think what I can
have said to put so silly an idea in your head. M. is quite nice
and a very pleasant companion, but she has no power to help or
comfort me; I should never dream of telling her I <i>needed</i>
help or comfort. It will make no difference at all to me when she
goes away. It takes me years to get really attached to a person.
Amy means much more to me. And you know, or you never will know,
that only <i>one</i> person has really hold of my heart strings,
for good or for evil. I shall never have any peace or happiness
till I can put my arms round you once more. You are never out of my
thoughts. I long to get away from London after six months here
without the smallest break (the sight of the lilacs makes me feel
faint) but I couldn't bear to go away with <i>anyone</i> but you. I
would give anything to know you are on the way
back.&mdash;<i>Why</i> should I 'upbraid' you, my Darling? I cannot
think of any reason why, and there is nothing but love for you in
my heart.&mdash;I wanted my cable to you, 'All well,' to mean a
great deal and comfort you a little. Always your belonging H."</p>

<p>To measure one's feelings towards the people one cares for is
never quite pleasant. But I felt called upon to do it under the
circumstances, and, having done it, I can recognise still to-day
that as regards Edith every word yet remains true. If there is some
modification as regards M. and if I should now speak of her with a
greater degree of affection that is simply in accordance with what
I have said in this letter: "It takes me years to get really
attached to a person."</p>

<p>The cable, which had been left to a friend to despatch, came at
last. All the unhappy circumstances of her departure I only learnt
later. She had sensibly selected an American boat, the
<i>Philadelphia,</i> to travel by, as probably safer than an
English vessel since America had not yet entered the War. It so
chanced that the news of the torpedoing of the
<i>Lusitania</i>&mdash;one of the most fateful and for most people
the most dramatically tragic events of the war&mdash;reached New
York the day before the <i>Philadelphia</i> left. The result was
that passengers for England with one consent rushed for greater
safety at the last moment on to the <i>Philadelphia,</i> which thus
became overcrowded and excessively uncomfortable. At the best, it
was an old boat overrun with vermin and sickening fora sensitive
invalid to travel in. Naturally, also, the whole boat was filled
with the atmosphere of nervous apprehension and the perpetual
expectation of danger. Edith was too brave to be crushed by this
atmosphere, but she had her own more abstract nervous terrors,
always associated with illness, when she craved for my arms, and
the whole voyage seems to have been a nightmare of agony to her,
though she fortunately had two kind women acquaintances on board,
who were a source of comfort. But the Atlantic voyage, which under
better conditions had been a restorative, failed now when she
needed it most. There could, indeed, have been no worse experience
fora scarcely convalescent invalid. It was one of those mischances
which henceforth were so often to befall her.</p>

<h2><a name="ch10" id="ch10"></a>Chapter 10</h2>

<p>The ship was to arrive at Liverpool, and the day before it was
due I went up to Liverpool and was careful to select a comfortable
hotel, the St. George, for her reception. The formalities to be
gone through next day before I could reach the ship-side were so
confusing that the <i>Philadelphia</i> was already being moored
alongside the wharf when I came up to it. I speedily saw her amid
the sea of faces on the ship and she immediately saw me. "Are you
alone?" was almost the first question she asked. It appeared
afterwards that a silly journalistic woman acquaintance on board
had suggested to her that I would come accompanied by my new friend
M., and in her shaken mental condition she had accepted this
suggestion as a possibility. But in the delight of seeing her I
overlooked the disconcerting significance of this question. On her
side, too, the excitement of seeing me at last had a vivifying
effect so that at first I could see little change in her appearance
and felt reassured. It was a sweet reunion. When all the
formalities of landing were at length accomplished she came with me
to our comfortable hotel and she spent by my side the most restful
night she had known for many weeks. But after the prolonged and
extreme phase of nervous exhaustion she had passed through it was
far more than one night's rest that she needed. Next morning she
was not inclined to get up; she wished to spend a few days quietly
at the hotel before moving on to London. I argued against this; it
seemed to me awkward and inconvenient for her to spend the day in
bed in an hotel; Liverpool was not a pleasant city to stay in; it
would be better, and she would be more free, if we went direct to
London, to the Brixton flat. So I argued: I knew that in the past
if she were firmly convinced of the desirability of staying she
would have resisted my arguments and I would have been willing to
drop my objections. But after a time she yielded. I failed to
understand that she yielded not because she was convinced but
because she was tired and weak; she had lost her old energy of
resolute self-assertion. She dressed and we came to London. But
before we reached Brixton, she began to show distressing signs of
exhaustion and irritability; I realised that her instinct had been
right and that it would have been better to prolong the peaceful
and happy period of rest which had begun so beneficently at
Liverpool. It was not the last mistake I was to make. During a
quarter of a century I had been slowly acquiring knowledge by which
I continued to be automatically guided. I could not quickly realise
that the conditions had changed and that my knowledge was no longer
to the point. I was, however, soon to receive very definite
indications of the profound underlying change that had taken place.
There was usually indeed the old affection in her attitude towards
me. Soon after her return she wrote a careful letter (keeping a
copy, as was not usual with her) to the man friend on whose help
and kindness she had much relied in America but whose conduct at
the end had seemed to her strange and incomprehensible. In this
letter she referred beautifully to my steadfast devotion. I fancy
there may have been a feeling at the back of her mind that the
qualities, to which she was by no means insensitive, of surface
chivalry and gallant attentiveness in her brilliant American friend
had for a moment seemed to reveal a lack in me, and it would have
been a legitimate feeling. But it must have been soon after her
return, at Brixton, when she was in bed one morning, not feeling
well, that Amy called. I left them alone for a while, and Amy with
kindly intentions, but not happily inspired, spoke of my care and
kindness, and hoped that would soon help her to get strong. A few
minutes later when I returned to the bedroom after seeing Amy out,
I found that during the moments she was left alone she had
swallowed a number of morphia tablets. Nothing had happened to
worry or upset her, only the visit of Amy for whom she had long had
a genuine almost affectionate regard. The act was unpremeditated,
inconsequential, a child's act. She quietly told me at once what
she had done: she meekly swallowed the simple emetic I hastened to
prepare; the tablets were speedily returned and no ill results
followed. I think she was rather pleased at the concern I showed.
That revealed to me, more clearly than anything else had, that her
nature had been undermined and the fibres of her soul as well as
her body weakened. For never before, in any mood of depression, had
she given evidence of suicidal thoughts, to say nothing of suicidal
attempts; they could not enter the cheerful, sanguine, courageous
scheme of life which was in part natural to her and in part slowly
built up. But this was not the last incident of the kind in the
months that followed, to render even more acute the anxious
apprehension with which my thoughts were concentrated upon her.</p>

<p>After a few days at Brixton we went to Speen, according to the
plan she had made in America, with my full agreement, for the weeks
we had spent in the same old house there the autumn before were
still a delicious memory. At the same time the horse and pony and
trap which had been left in the care of the Stanwell friend were
also sent to Speen. It turned out a beautifully bright and warm
summer; we could not have been more pleasantly and comfortably
situated. We had, I know, many calm and happy moments together, and
the letters I received during the occasional days when I was away
in London bear witness to her affection. But, somehow, it is the
more poignant and anguished moments which have cut deepest into my
memory, and I know that even the more peaceful hours of my life
there that summer had beneath them a perpetual undercurrent of
apprehensive solicitude. Certainly, if ever I was at fault before,
I know I cannot reproach myself with coming short in love and
tenderness at that time. In one way I was better able to help her
than ever before because, largely owing to her absence in America,
I had been able, by living simply and working, to improve my
financial position and so to assist her with greater ease in the
little money troubles which, as ever, often beset her. I remember
my simple pleasure in being able once, when in the nervous flurry
which would easily affect her in these days she lost two pound
notes when taking her ticket at Marylebone, to replace them at once
in spite of a protest on her part; I could not always have done
that so easily in earlier days when we sometimes had literally to
count our pence. It was during this summer that stumbling on the
rather rough lawn she fell and sprained her ankle, whereupon I
sprang towards her exclaiming unconsciously and to her pleasure:
"My baby!" It was my business and pleasure, when the foot was
getting better, to rub it with embrocation as soon as she was in
bed at night; sometimes I gave it a kiss during this operation, and
she liked that little token of love and would playfully hold up the
foot, like a child, to be kissed when I approached.</p>

<p>But there are more painful memories. I was constantly reminded
how, in spite of a show of the old energy, she was really enfeebled
in body and mind as never before. The book on James Hinton which
she had been working at for years had necessarily been laid aside
during the American visit. Some time before, with her sanguine
enthusiasm she had secured from the publishers a considerable
advance on account of royalties&mdash;a plan I have always
avoided&mdash;and now the publishers were worrying and almost
threatening her over the long delay. They knew of her activities in
America and naturally could not believe that she was not well
enough to complete the book. She started toiling at it again, but
it was a peculiarly difficult book not only on account of its
subject but because of the vagueness and repetition of Hinton's
copious MSS. In the morning I would take down her
cushion&mdash;"Lily's cushion," which I cherish yet&mdash;and her
large despatch box of papers to the revolving shelter on the little
lawn, and here she would come to puzzle over her task, arranging
the endless slips of notes she had made into order and pinning them
on the table before her, while I would recline in my hammock chair
with my work near by, turning the shelter round from time to time
in accordance with the sun or wind; if I were not in sight as she
worked she would complain, though for me it was rather easier to
work when not in sight. I could see she was not strong enough for
the mental strain of this tedious task, but it would have worried
her more to leave it undone. Once or twice a week she would go to
London for the day, or for a day or two, with or without me, for
appointments at her Club, and sometimes we would go to Brixton. She
would drive to High Wycombe, leaving the horse and trap at the Red
Lion. In the evening she would often be exhausted. There was, too,
a new and alarming feature about this exhaustion. Often in earlier
times she would be tired and irritable after one of these full days
into which she put so much activity. But after a good dinner, with
a little claret or burgundy, she would at once become herself
again, full of her mischievous cranks and quips. Now there was an
ominous change. The dinner was the same but it no longer had the
same effect. It was precisely in the evening after dinner, in the
hour or two before bedtime, that she was most depressed. Evidently
her resilient strength was going; she could no longer react
normally to the refreshment of food; it was merely an added strain.
She would sit before the great fireplace of the Old House, and I
near her, in a spirit of complete dejection which nothing would
move, and bring forward afresh the grievances which no arguments
could touch. The old tenderness had not gone, but it was in
abeyance and could not be aroused even when she lay in bed with the
doors open between us. Sometimes she could not sleep, and then, I
am sure, her melancholy was at its worst. She told me one day that
in the early morning she had quietly gone down to the well just
below my window with the intention of throwing herself down it,
but, she added, had not, at the last moment, the courage to do it.
My state of mind became even more apprehensively anxious, and
though it was a lovely summer and I had much work, and the little
garden was an ideal study, I could not but feel the strain which
was upon us both.</p>

<p>There was always some unhappy incident to increase the
depression. She had been affectionately attached to the pony she
had had for so many years and to the donkey of beautiful
disposition born on the farm at Carbis&mdash;Tom and Rickey, as
they were called&mdash;and had always carefully looked after their
welfare and comfort. Now they were both growing old and unhealthy,
and she felt that the last duty of putting them safely and easily
out of life was laid upon her, even though she felt that with their
death she was severing one of the last ties that bound her to
earth. She arranged that they should be destroyed in accordance
with the best humanitarian method. One day we drove into High
Wycombe&mdash;she had latterly been harnessing pony and donkey
together&mdash;for the last time. To me was assigned the duty of
seeing the deed properly done&mdash;as formerly when Jock was
shot&mdash;while she went into a stable, for though she never
lacked courage, there was no need to court unnecessary pain. After
that, when she went to London, she was driven to and from the
station by a local man. In the evening I would walk a mile or so
along the peaceful silent road amid the hills to meet her, and hear
her clear voice talking to the driver perhaps five minutes before
the trap appeared. On other days, we would towards evening, if not
earlier, take a little walk together into the woods which are so
delightful around Speen, and of such walks my memories are happy,
for that time at Speen, nor indeed any time that ever I spent with
her, was not all pain. This I may still see in her letters during
all this period. They reveal that immense tenderness which had
accumulated around us, even though that tenderness became sometimes
so poignant that perhaps neither of us knew whether it was joy or
pain.</p>

<p>Soon after we went to Speen her friend Y. joined her there and I
stayed in London.</p>

<p class="quote">"My darling Boy," she wrote immediately after I
left, "I do pray you are all right. You looked so sweet when you
went away and I loved you more than you ever can tell. Y. is
utterly dear. She knows how to massage for circulation, but I never
slept till 4 for no reason at all. If you care to go with Amy for
your week to Somerset <i>now,</i> do, or I can arrange for Y. to
return later. Let me know by return...These motor drives and
massage and the realisation of many wonderful aspects of love in
you too, and perhaps even in me, may give me the cure here after
all outside Aix. The back of my head is very bad but Y. thinks she
can help it. We've talked out lots of things. When you come back we
can easily have M. here one day. I hope and feel when you see me
next I may have turned the corner. I shall think of you with M.
to-morrow: say I hope she will come here before she sails. <i>I
mean this.</i> I've waged it out at last. I miss you and long to
hear you are rested. No more as it makes my head ache."</p>

<p>A little later she wrote in pencil:</p>

<p class="quote">"My darling Boy, I am feeling very ill&mdash;my
head and congestion with the cold wind is more than I can bear.
Last night was horrible&mdash;I just feel I can bear no more. Y. is
so sweet but she must be feeling it a dull time. I long to see you
but I am glad you are free to work and see people. With my love
always, your Wifie."</p>

<p>That note, undated, shows how the strain of physical depression
sometimes kept her outlook normal; the next, which must have been
written very soon after, shows less physical but more emotional
depression.</p>

<p class="quote">"Alas! I still feel far from well. I had best just
sleep <i>away.</i> You have all got those who can be more than I
can ever be now. Something has killed me I know. Y. writes and
talks and thinks of her new friend always and you have all you
need. I am a mere incumbrance. If all is well we shall motor up on
Tuesday if fine. My longing to see you is very great but somehow
the sadness of worse than death is over me. I know I am very ill
and just cannot die. I hope Amy and M. are all right and a comfort.
I will wire on Tuesday if we are on our way. Be prepared, darling.
I may come on to Brixton. Your ever loving and despairing
Wifie."</p>

<p class="quote">That letter is characteristic of what I am sure
was often her state of mind during the twelve months after the
breakdown in America, if not indeed until the end. There had always
been moods of self-depreciation&mdash;her own inferiority was so
brutally hammered into her in childhood&mdash;which her sanguined
self-assertion, the "masculine product," as Adler called it, could
not entirely crush. But now that brave spirit had been broken by
disease, and the selfdepreciatory mood was unfettered. So I explain
so much in her actions at that time. It was not true, it was never
less true, that those she loved no longer had need of her. But it
had become difficult for her to believe. In another letter a few
days later she writes from the Lyceum Club, where she often spent
the night to avoid the fatigue of coming out late to Brixton:</p>

<p class="quote">"Your letter is very beautiful and perhaps you are
right in all you say. A young married woman is dying in this Club,
with two doctors with her now, from an overdose of something. I
wonder what maggot got in <i>her</i> brain. Y. is very sweet and I
am a little easier. I saw S.S. [her friend and doctor] yesterday
and she says I must do no brain work for two months and have no
worry at all."</p>

<p>There are no more letters until a month later; we had been
together at Brixton and at Speen. Then, on the 26th of June, I went
for a few days to Somerset with Amy&mdash;the last time it chanced,
that I ever went away with her&mdash;and Edith arranged for Y. to
come to Speen the day before. It was the last of many excursions
together, for not long afterwards Amy decided to marry, which
brought our more intimate relations to an end, but to this day (in
1939), more than twenty years later, we remain affectionate
friends. But by one of the mischances that were always befalling us
at this time, on that very clay that Y. arrived she had an accident
with her motor-cycle and was slightly injured, and Edith waited at
the station in vain. Edith wrote next day to tell me of this
trouble:</p>

<p class="quote">"Tragedy pursues us...We got here at 8.30 and I am
glad we did it now. She is fearfully bruised but sweet and very
brave. If I had wired or gone back to you I should have put you out
or worried you and I did not want to do that. So my dream-week of
motoring won't be and it is all a big expense, but it can't be
helped...I wake every hour, but escaped the worst torture as I had
a big battery treatment yesterday. I do hope you are all right. Why
I still live is a puzzle, for I shall always feel in the way as you
know, but I may get to America once more. I am hoping for a wire
from you as I write and then I can post this. We've been lying in
the sun and I have slept quite a long time. I shall come up on
Friday for a long treatment, and then to you at the flat and go
straight to bed. Have a lovely time of peace and sunshine,
darling."</p>

<p>Next day, still depressed, she writes to me in Somerset:</p>

<p class="quote">"I am glad you are having such a nice time and at
last recovering from your cold. Y. is much better but her bruises
are pretty bad. Yes&mdash;it has been a great disappointment not to
motor, but I am at last learning that to live hour by hour as well
as one can is the only thing left for me to do. I shall try to see
M. on Friday before treatment and then come on to you. I am very
sad and feel that now you are going up in health and wealth and I
am not&mdash;only longing to die and can't. Heigho! My love to you
and greetings to Amy."</p>

<p>She refers to Aix. It was natural that at this breakdown in
health we should think of the breakdown of ten years earlier and
how swiftly she had risen up, body and spirit, under the reviving
influence of that beautiful valley which had remained a dream of
delight to us both. It is true the illness was not the same nor
were the circumstances of the time the same. So I wrote to our old
friend Dr. Blanc, still the leading physician of Aix&mdash;though
he died a few months later&mdash;setting forth Edith's condition
and asking whether he thought it would be benefited by a visit to
Aix, and whether war-conditions would admit of such a visit. He
replied with friendly kindness, urging us to come, as he was
distinctly of opinion that a visit would be beneficial, and that
war-conditions had caused little change at Aix. But when we
examined the matter more closely, it seemed clear that it was
undesirable for an invalid to face the difficulties and delays of
the journey under war-conditions, while the expenses of such an
expedition were beyond my means, or hers. So we were both content
to abandon all further thoughts of Aix.</p>

<p>But, in Edith's mind at all events, there were thoughts of our
going together farther afield than Aix-les-Bains. She was already
beginning to look forward to another visit to America, expecting,
with her ever sanguine spirit, to carry on to a better issue the
success which had been so disastrously interrupted on her last
visit. She had always longed for me to accompany her to America,
and now that cherished idea became more insistent; she never quite
gave it up, even to the end of her life, when she was arranging the
details of another American adventure. In October of this year,
1915, writing to her lecture agent, she says: "Everything is
opening before me in quite a wonderful way. The moment the war is
over I shall make arrangements to return to the States. Probably my
husband will come with me, though he might not stay long in New
York." There were, I imagine, several elements in her desire fit my
presence, though she scarcely formulated them all definitely. There
was the real need, amid the loneliness of an alien crowd, of even
the mere physical comfort of my nearness which always meant so much
to her in moments of depression. There was the desire to make clear
to the world that in spite of the doubts which, as she nervously
imagined, had spread abroad I stood openly beside her in close
association. She would protect me, she said, against the social
life which she knew I found so repulsive. But she also once
proposed that I should sit on the platform while she lectured about
me! I thought, and many of my friends thought, that for anyone who
was naturally and habitually such a recluse, the situation would be
a little ridiculous. Olive Schreiner took this view and
remonstrated to Edith that I must just be left to decide for
myself. But Edith could not entirely give way, and finally I made a
half-promise that I would perhaps join her in Bermuda or
California. It was the only occasion on which we ever had any
difference of inclination on any question of an expedition
together, big or little.</p>

<p>It was to this that the next letter (July 12th) refers, written
when she was spending a night, as sometimes happened when she
wished to be in town, at the Lyceum Club:</p>

<p class="quote">"I also have a headache&mdash;partly with the idea
that you are 'crushed' about America. Pray don't be. The chances
are I'll be much further than that by October; and if not I will
not dream of letting you go if you hate it. The people who
<i>love</i> me are always ready to do what <i>they</i> like, but
not what will save me!...If I can come to you I will wire, but I
expect not. Y. was very sweet, but I felt, as I am feeling more and
more, that you all just need to feel I'm 'safe' and that to me
means dead. Edward [Carpenter] thinks America would do you a lot of
good. He thinks I look very strained...I love you and hope you will
have a nice time with M. Your ever loving Wifie."</p>

<p>The reference to being 'safe' refers to a remark of mine once
that I was content, even though not with her, so long as I knew
that she was happy and safe. It was not, I fear, a felicitous thing
to say, and she had responded at once: "Then you would be content
if I were dead?" Next day she wrote: "My darling One, I also was
feeling dreadfully depressed, but I believe it is this awful war.
Child&mdash;don't worry. I am trying all I know how to get strong.
I cannot bear you to be sad&mdash;it <i>hurts</i> as mothers are
hurt." "Just a good-night from her mother to her babe," she wrote
two days later from the Club. "Bless you, my darling, and give you
something more worth while than I am. What will cure me will be the
renewing power to help."</p>

<p class="quote">"This, my Darling Boy, is only a line to say that
if you <i>want</i> me, I'll come to sleep on Saturday night, and go
to Mitcham with you in the morning. M. will tell you what a nice
time we had yesterday. I've decided not to say any more about
America to you. It is for you to choose, as it is for me to choose.
It seems my only way to go, and if I must go alone I must take
chances once more. I felt I could never be separated from you so
long again or I'd die, but you see I never die, and it is no more
selfish of me to leave you than for you not to come with me. Anyway
I feel it is my only throw to get square about money. Life anyway
is too sad for words. You have two devotees left with you, and I
have only a cursed sense of duty to comfort me. I think of you and
love you more than you know and am facing more than I ever did in
America. I shall never dread dying because I leave what I had
imagined once would miss me."</p>

<p>Then, as still, that difficulty over America was poignant for
me, and the consciousness of failure accompanied my profound
instinct against going. I note the melancholy touch of desolation
at the close of her letter, and next day she wrote:</p>

<p class="quote">"I feel&mdash;like always when there is anywhere
to go with me&mdash;you do not really want to go to-morrow."</p>

<p>Yet she had never been so surrounded by devoted friends as at
that time, nor, so far as I was concerned, had I ever felt so
tenderly near to her. That I was never anxious to go to see
strangers was true enough.</p>

<p>The visit to Mitcham, to the house of an artist acquaintance,
duly came off. It was almost the last little expedition we ever
went together. The artist (Hagborg) utilised the opportunity to
make a drawing of me. At that time Jo Davidson, the sculptor, had
just modelled my bust, in two sittings, with feverish energy. Edith
had come to the studio to see the result and I have elsewhere
recorded her remark to the effect that it was not like me, and his
retort: "You have never seen him!" I expect she would have found
more like me the vividly alive bust executed twenty years later by
the Hungarian sculptor, Strbol.</p>

<p>In her next letter, it so chances, she refers to this visit to
Davidson's studio: "The bust gave rie a conglomeration of
feelings." I imagine that she was impressed, as I was, by the
burden of reflective melancholy the sculptor had found in my face.
The bust must, however, have had some resemblance, for some five
years later, when I first met Joseph Conrad in a theatre, his first
remark was that he had recognised me afar as he had seen the bust
in Davidson's studio. The remark, if I may accept it, was
significant of accurate observation in memory.</p>

<p>There is an interval of over a month during most of which we
were together at Speen, I busy in writing and sending off articles,
mostly to America, and Edith, among other things, struggling with
her study of Hinton.</p>

<p>The only letter in this interval was when Y. was staying with
her for two or three days and I was in London:</p>

<p class="quote">"It always seems as if I was walking on one leg or
had lost an arm when you are away. We went to the Coliseum and had
a French lunch but all but three shillings has gone. Y. returns to
town by the 6.30 so you will arrive before she leaves and I may
want a few shillings to refund which I will return from my cheque.
I had my treatment and E.S. says I am much better, but must go
slow. I hope you are having a lovely time, my Sweet One, and
thinking only of what I feel for you and not of any rough things. I
love you ever."</p>

<p>A letter from Whiteley's Stores to Brixton on a morning we had
gone up from Speen together runs:</p>

<p class="quote">"My Darling Boy, your sad face haunts me. Surely
there is enough anguish in the world without people who love one
another as we do adding to it. Have a sweet time with Amy, who will
do you good. I shall be rested by myself perhaps and arrive
to-morrow at High Wycombe to meet you by your train. I've had a big
scrimmage but got a lot done...Bless you, my Child&mdash;I'll teach
you as Duse did her acting lovers&mdash;how to be kind to me. You
are not to think it is even half your fault. Your own loving
Wifie."</p>

<p>I do not know what that letter referred to but the note of
reaction in it is one that often followed moments of irritable
anger or scorn. I never quarrelled with her, but I can well believe
my face was sad for I felt how deeply and perilously disease had
touched her.</p>

<p>The next letter (September 17th), more than a fortnight later,
and the last I possess written to me from London, begins with the
same words:</p>

<p class="quote">"Your face haunts me but so does my own...My heart
feels tired and I long to die. However such is love. I love you and
ever shall and while you really need me shall be there. Sleep and
rest and bring your dear self safely here to-morrow."</p>

<p>During the weeks that followed, when we were always together at
Speen or at Brixton, there were no letters, but I well recall how
worried we were as to how we would spend the winter. She was
undergoing electrical and other medical treatment in London, coming
up for this about twice a week when at Speen, but we neither of us
regarded it as desirable to spend the winter in town, where we
never had spent it once since our marriage. I saw no alternative to
Cornwall, and was even hopeful of benefit there, although I knew
that in some respects it was no longer an ideal climate for Edith.
After all, our home was still there&mdash;a peaceful home in a mild
and wholesome air; she had dear friends at St. Ives, and the common
people all round regarded her as almost one of themselves. Moreover
the tenancy of the couple to whom she had sub-let Rose Cottage was
now ended. But Edith displayed a strong repugnance such as she had
never shown before, though, it is true, after twenty-five years of
work that was sometimes drudgery and worry, Carbis was already
losing the attraction it once held for her. But she could give no
reason for her repugnance nor put forward any alternative plan. So
my proposal conquered, and if, as the result seemed to show, I was
wrong, I do not know what else could have been done, and at all
events she never reproached me.</p>

<p>When staying at the Lyceum Club, she had been waited on by an
American housemaid who was leaving the Club. She was drawn, as
servants usually were, to Edith, who had found her good and
attentive. The girl's family had belonged to Cornwall; she wished
to go there herself, and graciously consented to come from this
Piccadilly Club to our simple little cottage as a general servant.
That turned out to be another unfortunate event; there was no end
to them now.</p>

<p>After so long an absence and the departure of the tenants, Rose
Cottage required much attention. Edith went down before me at the
beginning of November to see to this, accompanied by her friend Y.,
but without the new servant, On the way down, she had met in the
train a casual acquaintance, who told her of Cadgwith, near the
Lizard, and of a pleasant house to stay at there. Meanwhile, I was
feeling the strain of the summer, though busy with work, and
suffering just then from neuralgia and abscess in the mouth. She
wrote next day, after referring to money difficulties:</p>

<p class="quote">"I would not go to Cadgwith but I simply am tired
to death, and this cottage has only two rooms available as yet and
it is all confusion and I can't cope with more difficulties yet. I
ran and flew and worked yesterday and walked to St. Ives for food
and then from Carbis station, and that horrible Dr. came in at 8.30
and stayed till ii, our first night. I'm up now at 6 and settling
heaps of things. It is really sweet here and you'll love it, but
endless little things to do. Y. is quite sweet so far. I keep
thinking how strong I'll make you here&mdash;we should have a
lovely winter. We go to-day to Cadgwith; I've heard of nice rooms.
I think we'll come back Saturday night. I shall try to rest
completely. I am sending you a little cream. Remember after next
week I shall be able to put you up, but I shan't be straight as
they've left the place in an awful mess. <i>Later.</i> Your letter
here. Darling, it distresses me dreadfully. Do take care. Let me
hear at Cadgwith. I love you and long for you to be better."</p>

<p>She little knew, and my apprehensive mind never guessed, how
sadly the "lovely winter" would turn out.</p>

<p>But it began well. Her first letters from Cadgwith were the most
buoyant and cheerful I had received since her return from America
and they were the last that ever were so. It must have been in
answer to the first of these, which somehow I do not seem to have,
that I wrote the last letter of mine she seems to have preserved,
and on that account, and because it is fairly typical of those that
are lost, I quote it in full.</p>

<p class="quote">"My darling Wifie, I was disappointed to have no
letter from you this morning, but it has come in the middle of the
day, and I am most delighted and relieved to hear that everything
seems all right and that you were able to rest in bed. It is still
as bad as ever here, howling wind and pouring rain. Do take care
and don't do anything silly for Y. or anyone. I enclose a little
note as a present&mdash;to spend on being careful. When your letter
arrived Smith [my old medical friend] was here and had just dug his
knife into me with most beneficial results. I had had another awful
night. Now if I avoid cold I hope to be soon all right. Amy looked
in this morning and brought me some ox-tail soup, and will probably
look in again. I got my <i>New Republic</i> article [on Rémy de
Gourmont, then lately dead] finished yesterday, in time, but it was
a heroic effort. I shan't attempt anything more at present but
little poddles. I suppose it is the result of rundownness, etc. as
I have no bad tooth. I am quite comfie and all right here, and in
my recent condition have been thankful to have no one to inflict
myself on. Always your loving H."</p>

<p>She wrote from Cadgwith on November 7th.</p>

<p class="quote">"My Darling Boy, Really Fate <i>is</i>
kind&mdash;the weather as far as sun goes is like June and this
place is gorgeous and cheap and comfortable. You and I must come
some day soon. Yesterday we walked five miles and took our
lunch&mdash;wonderful sands and valleys and Cornish sweetness. War
and wrangles seemed unknown. We go back alas! to-morrow to
secretaries and servants and cleaning. Y. is so dear about it all
and is helping me in all kinds of ways. We leave here early
to-morrow. I'm drinking absolutely nothing of alcohol in this
lovely air. I sleep and eat and walk like a 25 one and am purposely
not doing a line of work...To-day we go to the Lizard in the little
pony jingle we can hire and stay out all the time it is light. This
coast is very guarded and they are very particular about
lights...Try not to do too much head work at first when you come
but sleep and enjoy what I shall have ready for you. I shall send
off your little box of goodies separately. Well, darling&mdash;take
care. Your letters make me ache for you, for none of us except M.
and she is away, seem much good to you."</p>

<p>She repeated more than once, on her return, the hope of going
again with me. But that was not to be. The end was approaching too
rapidly. Nothing remained but the wish to go alone and capture the
memories of her presence in the spot where she knew the last rays
of unclouded brightness that Life was to bring her. But for one
reason or another that was not possible until six years later. Then
I found Cadgwith even more pleasant than she had reported, and
spent three winter months there, together with my old friend Arthur
Symons. It was not only a pleasant and wholesome shelter from
winter such as I had scarcely before found even in Cornwall, it was
a spot rendered beautiful to me with the thought of her, occupying
her room and sleeping in her bed, and now, as I write, I am cheered
by the thought of going there yet again to commune joyfully once
more with that invisible presence. Since these words were written I
have been there peacefully again and again during the winter
months, by myself, and finally, though not with Edith, with my dear
Françoise.</p>

<p>She spoke in that letter of Fate being kind, but, alas! during
all that period Fate was never kind to her for more than a moment,
and before that same day had ended the sun was overclouded. She
wrote on returning to Carbis Bay:</p>

<p class="quote">"A tragedy always has to end my good times. We'd
had a perfect few days and on Tuesday in walking on the upper path
to Kynance Y. slipped on a high stile and hurt her back badly. I
wondered if we should ever get here but we've managed it. In the
middle of the night I had a violent stomach attack, partly as a
result of chill and shock. I got through but was horribly weak
yesterday when I had so much to do and nothing ready in this house
and Millie [the new servant] arriving at night; but I managed it
and am a little better this morning. Y. will be in bed a day or
two, but, thank goodness, is easing. Millie is wildly delighted
with the 'picture world' and seems cheerful and willing. It won't
be ready for a fortnight. I am thankful you are out of this
muddle."</p>

<p class="quote">Her enfeebled and highly-wrought state made her
unduly sensitive to minor shocks, though even yet, it seemed, she
was able to cope with them successfully; but all those minor
strains, I now see, were preparing a further break-down.</p>

<p>Amid the confusion of the cottage, with workmen painting and
distempering, the new servant learning her work, a typist busy, her
friend disabled in bed, she wrote (November 10th) to me
cheerfully:</p>

<p class="quote">"However we are getting on, and if only Y. could
get easier it would be better. We had such a lovely holiday, and so
far not a horrid time except for confusion and illness...I am
writing at six in the morning to get done. I feel I shall never get
to the 'Hinton' again...I shall be thankful when you and I are
settled in; it will be very comfie and I hope we shall stay a long
time...Well&mdash;my precious, how are you? Give my love to M. and
Amy (I am writing to her one day) and love me even as I do you.
Your tired old Wifie."</p>

<p class="quote">And the next day she wrote with the same spirit,
but it was clear the physical strain and domestic worries all day
long were becoming too much for her. She ends up:</p>

<p class="quote">"Six is the only hour I have to write to you and I
feel too weak to do it. Forgive more. When once you are here I do
hope we shall settle for some time. This continual moving is
killing me. It seems years since I saw you and I love you and long
for you, but not in this confusion. With my love and
tenderness."</p>

<p>And next day it is still the same story:</p>

<p class="quote">"My darling Love, oh! it rains and rains and I
wish I could see you, I'm feeling like a lonely child and long for
you, but not till it is straight. I can't get Y. proper things to
eat, and I've no money at all and just long to die, and I've pains
and nausea again and no wonder, for I got very wet yesterday. I
feel just to see you and hold your hand would be lovely. How are
you, I wonder. It seems years since we parted. <i>Later.</i> I've
worked like a navvy, and there is some semblance of order out of
chaos. My pet, are you so weak yet? You shall be taken such care
of, and have orderliness and rest. Good-bye."</p>

<p>Little troubles went on accumulating, and a few days later she
wrote:</p>

<p class="quote">"My Darling One&mdash;Oh! This awful gale! It has
broken a window&mdash;uprooted the evergreen tree&mdash;turned over
one of the sheds [in which we worked] and smashed it&mdash;and what
with the rush and all, I am so weak I don't know what to do. I want
you so I feel I'll just be meek and sweet for aver and ever! Come
directly moment you can. The mere sight of you will revive me. I
love you and long for you and belong to you. My pride is all
broken. The continual waiting on Y. and the gale and the other
things make me wonder what will happen next. Oh! <i>I want you
so!</i> Say you are coming and Y. will go. We'll have no animals
but just one another. ** Your letter just come. I feel a hunger for
you so intense. I <i>must</i> see you, and yet I would not have you
come a day before you want to. But I feel just to hear you say you
love me and really need me would be heaven. I have a horrible fear
one of us will go and the other be left, and then what should we
do? Oh! Havelock&mdash;Havelock&mdash;I feel like your little lost
child who has the hope of seeing you soon. Come to me&mdash;come.
Come and comfort me. My foot is aching and wants you to kiss it...I
fear all sorts of things and want to be reassured as you used to
reassure me. To-day the chimney smokes to add to things, but the
house looks more shipshape. You in it seems to me all it
needs."</p>

<p>(And now, as I write, it is Christmas Day more than six years
after her ashes were scattered on the grass, and I sit alone in the
room at Cadgwith where that "lovely holiday" was spent, and a soft
lullaby strain of music reaches me from a neighbouring room, and my
arms are once more gently enfolding her and she lies on my breast,
and my kisses and my tears are falling on her curly head.)</p>

<p>In a few days I was to be with her, but during that short period
letters continued to come swiftly, sometimes long letters,
sometimes two a day, and they were all in the same tone, and all
had the same refrain of longing and tenderness. I might seem to
detect in them the obscure realisation that there would never be
another opportunity and that into these last letters, as in one
sense they were, she must crowd the whole of her love.</p>

<p class="quote">"My Darling Love," she wrote in one, "It is only
six and I am in pain again. I feel the only thing that matters is
to see you. I want you under my care and T don't mind what I give
up for it. I want you to come the <i>moment</i> you are ready, but
I wired yesterday for Tuesday [I have preserved the wire, for I
must somehow have felt that everything was now becoming precious],
so that you knew you had not to rush or hurry. Y. is less selfish
than of old, but I dread Millie giving in as her weakness is not
being treated as a servant, and Y. is the last person to understand
this; it makes a great strain. But it is you&mdash;you&mdash;I
want. I've a horrible feeling you are very ill. Olive says you look
so ill. Dear Heart&mdash;write and say the moment you <i>want</i>
to come and it can be managed...I shall be all right when we are
together and able to lead regular lives. I will take much care of
you. It is absurd to long for anyone as I do for you...Your sweet
letter has come. I'm just longing for you. Y. is going on Thursday,
so come when you can. Oh! to see you...The second post has brought
your present of Panopepton. I fear I am confusing you with all
these alterations, but it is so difficult to know what to do. I
have a terror of this weather for you, and I feel we must be
together as soon as possible...<br>
<br>
"Just to feel your hand and hold it&mdash;just to know you forgive
me the pain I've given you as I do you, though I never meant it.
We'll talk and plan a sweet old age together...I felt last night I
should literally drop dead. I don't know how we will get through
till Y. goes. Everyone says how tired I look but I'll be all right
directly moment you come...I've had a fearful time seeing Y. away,
and my poor heart is very bad, but <i>don't</i> worry about me. I
must endure and strive. Poor [W. H.] Hudson, who is with the Ranee
here, is also broken up and is <i>so</i> depressed. She is sweet. I
feel broken. I am no use to anyone. I feel a pathetic feeling that
you too dread being with me. A new love is born in me&mdash;the
love born of gratitude and understanding of how you've loved me in
the most beautiful sense. Your fur is warming me outside as your
love inside. Come when you want. I feel only one thing
matters&mdash;to see you and hear you say I am worth while."</p>

<p>Next day, and just before I left London to join her, she wrote
once more, and it is the last letter I ever had from her which I
count as real:</p>

<p class="quote">"Your wire is a great relief. I felt awful
yesterday, and am staying in bed to-day, as I'm just as if I'd been
skinned and peppered all over, and the war news is dreadfully
depressing. You seem to think I shall be annoyed with you or
something. Child&mdash;I'm always suffering and longing to be dead,
but I want you more than anything in the whole world. Y. evidently
wanted her holiday by the sea in luxury (which for once it could
not be), and it will always be so...I am going to try very hard to
be all you want and not be a burden...I slept like a log last night
and wondered at last if it was coma. [A few months later it was
so.] I was horribly lonely and all in me cried out for you. Try and
stay down till we've let the place in February, and then we'll have
a little time at Mullion before London. I am organising this place
to go easily, and it will look very nice. As soon as my poor brain
and heart have recovered I must get at the Hinton book. That
through, all will be well. [Her death took place almost immediately
after it was sent to the publishers.]...Pay Wilkinson what you can,
Darling. Thank God at any rate we have a roof over us, and warmth
so far, and we 'belong' and have weathered through to a new love
and life together. Such loads of horror everywhere. Never
mind&mdash;you will soon be here and we will help one another to
the end. I will be at St. Erth and have a cab there or at Carbis
Bay...Come to me soon and know I am just yours in a new and
wonderful way. Your Wifie."</p>

<p>I linger over those letters. During the previous six months
after her return from America she had been so often in a morbid
mood of depression and suspicion and doubt. But the change to her
old home environment by the sea, and all the practical activities
it involved, although trying for her physically, had largely
restored her mental balance and brought to the surface the deep
love which had, through a quarter of a century of life together,
become the deepest part of herself, not to be destroyed even by her
own destruction. It seemed, indeed, after being so much overclouded
in America, to come to the surface in a new birth, and with a
pathetic simplicity of expression rarely before manifested, for it
was natural to her to be proud, independent even in love, and to
veil the intensity of feeling in playfulness and mischief. No doubt
it was physical weakness, the outcome of disease, which had broken
down that spirit. When at last, a few months later, this phase of
tender dependence passed, to yield to an unreal reaction of assumed
pride and independence, a more fundamental dissolution was taking
place, and the end was not far off.</p>

<p>I returned and all at first went smoothly. It was joy and peace
to her to have me quietly at her side and it was a great
satisfaction to me to be there. I felt that we were doing the best
that under the circumstances was possible. Those recurring moods of
melancholic suspicion which had so tortured me at Speen remained
absent and she seemed on the road to recovery; I had not realised
that what was happening was simply a transition to a different
phase of disorder, and one perhaps even more serious. But she was
obviously below her old level of health and spirit; the diabetes
was active in spite of care, and even the increased dependence on
me&mdash;so unlike the mischievous bravado of old&mdash;was
pathetic.</p>

<p>It must have been soon after my arrival that, the long strain of
the summer telling on me at last, I experienced a kind of general
lassitude of condition which much alarmed her and she wrote (as I
long afterwards learnt) to friends that I was seriously ill. She
made me stay in bed in the morning and insisted on making and
bringing up my breakfast. But in a few days I clearly saw that even
this little strain was too much and we brought it to an end. Soon
it became my turn always to prepare her breakfast. I overcame my
phase of lassitude and was indeed strong enough during the
following months&mdash;upheld, I am very sure, only by
love&mdash;to endure the greatest tension I ever had, or ever shall
have, to endure.</p>

</p>

<p class="caption">Edith Ellis, about 1914</p>

<p>It was natural that I should be more tender and attentive to her
than I had ever been before and that she should appreciate this
more than she ever had before. She occupied as a bed-sitting-room
the room on the ground floor that had once been the cottage
parlour, and in my bedroom over it I was able through the floor to
hear any sound and to come at once if needed. I wrote, when
indoors, in the dining-room and there we both sat in the evening.
Nearly every morning she liked to walk&mdash;the only method of
progression now left&mdash;to St. Ives to see some of the numerous
good and charming friends she possessed there; that was the best
relief and diversion for her sociable nature under the gathering
physical and mental burden. I would stand at the gate and
<i>wave</i> to her till she disappeared in the curve of the road,
or often I would accompany her to the verge of the town, then
turning to the moor on the left to settle down with my papers and
for work. So things went on as quietly and happily as might be
until at least after Christmas. The tragic events of this winter
stand out so vividly that the background of ordinary life is
dimmed. I remember that Christmas seemed rather sad, but the war
alone would suffice to account for that. Just one characteristic
little trait dwells in my mind. A dear German Jewess friend in
London had been accustomed to send her a Christmas tree of the
German brand, with its little candles and other traditional items,
and it was always a delight to Edith's childish temper. This
Christmas the tree came as usual, though, owing to the troubles of
the time, it was very small and of inferior workmanship. But Edith
cherished it, and now and then after Christmas she would bring it
on the table at dinner time and light the candles fora few moments
and I would note with a quiet sad smile with what
patience&mdash;for patience was never her strong point&mdash;she
would over and over again carefully restore the little tree's shaky
balance. I doubt if these things any longer brought her joy, but
they came to her with the echo of the joy of happier days. On New
Year's Eve, also, the last of her life, she was able to carry out a
still more old-standing custom, associated in her mind with the
beloved Lily whose fascinating personality had once played a
leading part in it. This was the annual entertainment of the St.
Ives Artists' Club. She was driven there and back&mdash;while I as
usual went to bed&mdash;and she took the new servant Millie with
her, as she had formerly always taken Priscilla, to enjoy the
fringe of the festivity.</p>

<p>It was Millie who proved the instrument for striking a decisive
blow at Edith's unstable mental poise. She slept next door, so that
we could feel freer, though there was a small spare bedroom in the
cottage, but she had lunch with us. That was a trait of Edith's
democratic feeling, though it had not been usual in our married
life, and now not only I but Edith also, in her present state of
mind, found this uncongenial society very trying. Millie had not
the quiet and disarming charm of Priscilla, she was used to
American habits, acid while she had been drawn to Edith in happier
days at the Lyceum Club, she had not had time to know her
thoroughly and to balance her sharp tongue and uncertain moods
against her warmly human disposition, her boundless generosity and
kindness, all the fascination felt by those who really came to know
her. Moreover, these were now not so easy to know. So an attitude
of instinctive hostility grew up on both sides, and culminated one
day in words of such unrestrained rudeness spoken by the justly or
unjustly offended Millie that she had to be told to leave the house
at once. As she went out of the front door she called up the stairs
that she was very sorry for me, a mark of sympathy which I curtly
repelled.</p>

<p>In earlier and happier days that little incident would soon have
been outlived. In Edith's tempestuous career there had been many
such violent scenes which she quickly forgot or laughed over. But
disease had now worn thin the fibres of her nervous system and this
insignificant clash sufficed to jangle them all. Millie, quite
naturally, stayed on for a while next door until she could find
employment, but this greatly disturbed Edith. She felt that here
was an enemy close at hand to work against her among the
neighbours. Even if this suspicion had been reasonable, it was
quite unreasonable to suppose that a stranger could do her harm in
a place where she was known so well and so generally liked. But
even if in germ the idea was plausible it sprouted up in her mind
during the weeks that followed into imaginations that could
scarcely be regarded as within the range of sanity. She felt sure
the neighbours were talking against her, especially they were
saying that she was a drunkard; so, although entirely against her
tastes and habits, for she had always enjoyed a glass of wine at
dinner, she firmly refused to touch any alcoholic drink. She even
began to suspect that neighbours were planning an attack on the
cottage for purposes of robbery, and carried a few of her little
treasures to St. Ives for safe keeping with friends there. Our
doctor neighbour, who was accustomed to look in from time to time
to see how Edith was getting on, took these symptoms very
seriously&mdash;no doubt not unreasonably&mdash;and formed the
worst prognosis. He was a typical Irishman, a delightful talker and
of kindly heart though of violent speech, himself in delicate
health and of pessimistic temperament. His opinion of the case was
frankly alarming.</p>

<p>I cannot say that during the weeks that followed I had much
chance of gathering counterbalancing hopes. What changes there were
only made her condition more pitiable and my anxiety deeper. In all
her ways she became the opposite of her old normal self. She who
had always been so full of energy, so fond of organisation, so
house-proud, and so jealous of the slightest interference in
household management, seemed to have lost all will-power and all
self-pride. There was nothing she could do, and the care of the
house as well as of her fell into my hands. It was fortunate that
the local woman whom she had engaged after Millie's departure to
come in every morning to do the housework, although a stolid silent
creature without the smallest initiative, was not without a stupid
kind of comprehension. She had herself once had some kind of
nervous breakdown, and she took her orders from me and went through
her work and seemed blind to everything, though Edith, full of
vague terrors, would dread her arrival in the morning. It was my
only consolation during all those melancholy weeks that she never
dreaded me and, indeed, could not bear to be away from me. She
never had a harsh word for me, never an unpleasant memory came to
the surface, no wilful mood, for her wilfulness had left her with
her will; all that defiance and independence, which had once seemed
almost a part of her love for me, had disappeared.</p>

<p>I would prepare our breakfast in her little bed-sitting-room
while she lay in bed, with the cat sitting up on her bed-table; she
never forgot to know how to look after his wants, though she was a
little confused and awkward in making the tea. Then the woman would
arrive and in due course the hot water was taken up to the little
room we called the bathroom. Here I would conduct her and leave her
for her bath; there had been nothing she regarded as more
indispensable then the morning tub. But now, as I knew, it would be
very difficult for her to take it. Sometimes I would go down and
walk up and down the garden for half an hour in the hope that,
feeling thus abandoned, her will would be stimulated to action. I
would come back to find her still standing beside the bath. Then it
was equally difficult for her to dress. There was some objection to
every garment, and this dress, she said, was too old to wear (it
hangs in my cupboard now, eight years later, laden with memories)
and that one too good for everyday. Then as she came downstairs she
would sometimes sit down on the stairs and remain there
obstinately, for an indefinitely long time, doing nothing. So with
her correspondence; I would suggest to her to send a line to her
dear friend Y., and she, the readiest of letter-writers, would sit
with her pen in her hand in front of a postcard and be unable to
write a word. At meal time, again, she, who so enjoyed her meals,
would sit before the dish I had ordered or (in the evening) myself
prepared, and take nothing, until, suddenly and rapidly, she would
eat a little. In the afternoon, with less difficulty, I was usually
able to persuade her to go for a walk with me but, so as to avoid
the fatigue of going uphill, it was always the same dull flat
little walk, to Longstone and then a little way inland. Yet, dull
and rather melancholy as they were, those little walks linger in
memory as the times which at this period she seemed most nearly
like herself. At night I would see her into bed, and tuck her up
with the thoroughness she always required, as of old, and leave her
with the indispensable good-night kiss. But I knew, as I went to my
own room above, through the thin flooring of which I could hear
every sound, that that was not likely to be the end. She could
sleep but little and was depressed in this at all events like her
old self in nervous moods&mdash;by the feeling of loneliness. Worn
out by anxiety, I would try, if not to sleep, at all events to
rest. But I knew that for her there would not be much rest. I would
go down from time to time, unable to resist the appeal of her
restlessness. But sometimes, worn out and weary, I would hear her
calling and long fail to respond. But, more often, I would come
down, and get into the little bed and lie close beside her with my
arms around her, and then it was that she had most rest, though for
me the only rest was her rest.</p>

<p>A few years earlier I had read and been deeply touched by the
narrative in the third volume of Edmond de Goncourt's
<i>Journal</i> of the slow mental decay which preceded the death of
his deeply loved and closely associated brother Jules. In after
years I have sometimes recalled to memory&mdash;for I have felt
that I could not bear to read it again&mdash;that account of
increasing failure of nervous adjustment to life which seems so
like the history of Edith during these months. But there was
another pdint also about it as it returns to memory: one feels that
the narrative is the more pathetic because of a scarcely hinted
undercurrent of remorse. Edmond had clearly been irritated by the
nervous awkwardness of his brother as his mental weakness became
more manifest; he had failed to understand, and the realisation of
his failure stung him. It has been a consolation to me to feel
that&mdash;however much I may possibly have failed Edith, before
then and after, I do not know&mdash;I never failed her, scarcely
even from sheer fatigue, during those weeks at Rose Cottage when
she was relying solely upon my support. I never failed in
understanding or in tenderness or had any desire outside her.</p>

<p>When I first knew Edith, before our marriage, I had sent her (as
I have set down in the proper place) what has ever seemed to me as
deep and true a statement of the meaning of love, in the essence of
its passion, as has ever been made, the greater part of the fifth
chapter of the third book of <i>De Imitation Christi,</i> in the
little translation I had made of it. Edith profoundly appreciated
that sheet of manuscript, from the first and always. She must often
have carried it about with her, for it became worn and faded; she
cherished it to the last and it lies before me now. I quote a few
lines:</p>

<p class="quote">"A great thing is love, a great and altogether
good thing; for love alone makes every heavy burden light, and
every unequal burden equal. Because it bears the burden without
being burdened, and makes every bitter thing sweet and delicious.
Like the living and ardent flame of a torch it ever rises and
safely passes through all."</p>

<p>For once in my life, during those last months at Carbis Bay, it
was mine to know the full truth of those words so strangely
inspired in a medieval monk of the Low countries. Such, then, is
the power of love that I seemed none the worse for the constant
strain. It affected my health apparently not at all, certainly less
than the weeks at Speen during the previous summer. And I think
that the significant difference was that there was something to do,
and that something useful and appreciated. My service was accepted
and my love was answered. That makes all the difference in the
world, even to physical health.</p>

<p>The old friends at St. Ives would come to cheer her. They were
in touch with our doctor neighbour and they could see for
themselves how unlike herself she had become. They were naturally
concerned, and although they saw how I had accepted the situation
they seemed almost as much concerned for me as for her. We
consulted together as to the best course to take; I suppose it was
the first time I had ever consulted over her welfare in her
absence. But she seemed to be growing worse rather than better; the
time might soon come when further help was absolutely necessary,
and there was no proper accommodation to offer a nurse, even had a
suitable nurse been within reach.</p>

<p>We thought of Dr. Hamilton of Hayle as the best man to give
advice and help. She was fastidious about doctors, knowing how
peculiar her constitution was, but she liked Hamilton, and five
years earlier, when Priscilla was seriously ill, had called him in
rather than any nearer doctor. He was one of those solid, kindly,
quiet, reliable men who so often come out of Scotland, in all but
kindliness the opposite of our Irish neighbour. He came, was
willing to take charge of the case, and proposed that she should go
to the Convent Nursing Home at Hayle, conducted by trained nurses,
which Hudson had only a few days left. This seemed to us the best
possible arrangement under the circumstances, and I agreed at once.
We anticipated difficulty in persuading Edith to go, for in all her
illnesses she had never before been taken away from home, and in
fact she was full of nervous terror over the removal; but in the
end it proved easier than we expected; her old spirit and will had
gone, giving place to a pathetic childlike docility mingled with
her nervous fears. Her devoted old friends from St. Ives, Mrs.
Moffatt Lindner and her sister&mdash;Gussie and Blue, as she always
familiarly called them&mdash;came and packed her things and
accompanied us in the carriage to the Convent, and she
affectionately greeted Sister Mary Basil, whom she already slightly
knew, at the door&mdash;it was fortunate that an affection for nuns
had persisted from her early days at the Convent in
Manchester&mdash;and was led away to the room I already knew which
Hudson had occupied. I took rooms a few minutes walk away, so as to
be within reach if needed. In accordance with Hamilton's quite
reasonable line of treatment, she was here to be entirely excluded
from her world, not to see any friends, not to receive any letters;
I alone was to see her, for a little while every day.</p>

<p>Therewith, little as I or she knew it at the time, my active
life with Edith came to an end. We were to plan otherwise; but it
was never to be; it was never henceforth vouchsafed to me to be of
much use to her. In the following year, ten months after her death,
when on a visit to Arthur Symons at his country cottage, feeling
rather unwell for some unknown reason, after lunch I lay back in an
easy chair before the large old fireplace and against my usual
custom fell asleep. It seemed to me that I was sitting, with Edith
beside me, in front of much the sort of fireplace I was actually
before, such as we had often known, and in response to some remark
of hers I could not recall, I said playfully: "You don't know how
useful I am!" There was no cause for grief present to my sleeping
mind, and no idea of her death; but it seemed to me that repressed
tears came into my eyes. Then she seemed to rise, to stand behind
me, and bending over, without a word, kissed away my tears. That
dream was true to the deepest spirit of both of us, even during
those last weeks in Cornwall. It was never to be completely true
again.</p>

<p>Now began a period during which I was tortured as I have never
before or since been tortured for so long in my life. I was
outwardly calm; then and since I confided to no one; yet even
to-day, when all is receding into the past, when nothing matters,
it is only with an effort of resolution that I force myself to
write of these weeks.</p>

<p>At first, it is true, things may possibly have seemed to me
easier, though only in seeming. Every morning, after calling at the
Home to inquire about the patient, I would take the train to Carbis
Bay, to look after things there, to superintend the woman helper,
to attend to my own and Edith's correspondence. Often I would go up
the moor to lie there with my papers, as in old days, trying to
attain a sense of rest, and it really seemed that there was a
decreasing need for anxiety and that in her seclusion from the
world Edith was improving. But&mdash;unfortunately, it
proved&mdash;it occurred to me that recovery might be stimulated by
allowing her to receive some little sign of affection from her dear
friend Y. So, having obtained the permission of doctor and nurses,
I wrote to Y. and suggested she should send flowers or fruit, but
without any letter, addressed directly to Edith. She did so at
once. On the afternoon of the morning on which the parcel arrived I
called as usual at the doctor's, on returning from Carbis Bay, to
hear his daily report. He met me with a serious face. It
appeared&mdash;to combine the information I obtained from various
sources&mdash;that she seemed as usual that morning and that on
receiving the parcel she simply remarked: "So she has found me, has
she?" Hardly an hour later, by means of an ingenious subterfuge,
which showed premeditation, she eluded the good nurses who were
watching her with care, though they had seen no reason to take
precautions, locked herself in he lavatory&mdash;having just left
it, but making a sudden excuse to return by herself for a
moment&mdash;and threw herself from the window. She was found on
the concrete pavement below moaning: "My foot, my foot." She had
injured her foot, and also severely cut her head. For some days she
lay in bed, only imperfectly conscious. But that incident was a
turning point in her disorder, the melancholic shadow that had more
or less hung over her for at least nine months was entirely
dissipated.</p>

<p>The precise psychic mechanism of the suicidal act I have never
been able to grasp. Her acts were often impulsive and incalculable.
But I could always grasp their significance. This act alone
continues to puzzle me. It is true it was definitely the act of a
disordered person. Still even a disordered mind is moved by
motives, however unreasonable they may be. Why should a token of
affection from a dear friend, who was associated with no seriously
painful memories, have had this potent influence for evil?
Moreover, how far was the act consciously planned, how far
subconsciously accomplished by a sort of secondary personality? She
herself, after she regained full consciousness as well as later,
would tell me how puzzled she was over this question. She certainly
retained no consciousness&mdash;and I knew her toi well to doubt
her honesty&mdash;of any suicidal intention on that morning; it is
well known that any sudden shock which abolishes consciousness
abolishes also the memory of the immediately preceding events. She
could only conclude, although unable to understand, that it was an
accident, that she had overbalanced. But it very certainly was not
an accident; she herself, by some force which for the moment
possessed her, had suddenly and definitely planned the act.</p>

<p>The physical results were not permanent, though she walked
lamely many weeks afterwards; the psychic results might even be
said to be beneficial. Yet the effects were unfortunate, and
perhaps decisively evil. For henceforth the doctors were prejudiced
and definitely established a bad diagnosis while the Mother
Superior of the Convent grew nervous and desired a speedy removal
of the patient. So the social environment, otherwise favourable for
recovery, was rendered unfavourable. It was not understood that
this act was really the climax of self-destructive thoughts which
had haunted her since the illness in America. She not only never
again made any attempt of the kind, but, so far as I could observe,
she never again had any suicidal impulses.</p>

<p>The patient had sought violent death, but, with the usual irony
of life, it was the doctor whom sudden death overcame. One Sunday
morning, about a week after this incident, that good kind man,
seeming in excellent health, arrived to dress the patient's wound
and reported good progress. I exchanged a few pleasant remarks with
him. Within less than an hour, completing his round in his car, he
lighted a cigarette while the chauffeur turned homewards, and fell
back dead. It was yet another of the tragic mischances which
dragged Edith's feet down the slippery path of those last few
months. The medical man who carne to replace Dr. Hamilton was not
helpful.</p>

<p>Meanwhile she was slowly emerging from the mental confusion
which followed the fall. The fact that the almost comatose
condition which had first supervened never developed into a fatal
diabetic coma showed how much vitality she even yet possessed. Her
mental condition greatly improved, as so often happens in
association with physical lesion; most of the symptoms which had
disturbed us passed away. She remained pathetically tired and
dependent in spirit, though that, also, was in her unnatural. Never
had she so clung to me for strength and consolation. Every evening
I would spend alone with her, lying close beside her on the bed,
but outside the bedclothes, with my arm across her. This greatly
comforted and soothed her; gradually she would fall asleep and then
I would try to slip quietly away and out of the Hospital to my own
sad rooms. But it was not always easy to do this. I would have
given anything to be able to stay with her, but the nuns offered no
indication of willingness to permit such a breach, of the rules.
She would plead with gentle and smiling Sister Mary Basil that I
might be allowed to lie beside her, "only like brother and sister",
but it was in vain. I had to go out into the dark night, quietly
closing the Hospital door, almost beneath her window, behind me,
and as I walked away in anguish&mdash;again and again it
happened&mdash;I heard her clear and beautiful voice penetrating
the silence and dying away: "Havelock! Havelock! Havelock!"</p>

<p>I would sit down in my alien room and perhaps try to
read&mdash;I still have a book I was reading then and have never
yet read more of it&mdash;but when I look back at this period it
soothes me to think that whatever experiences life may yet hold it
is only once that love can call upon us to ascend Calvary.</p>

<p>Yet even when the heart is most wrung some sweetness comes to
ease the pain. When I recalled the previous summer and the
suspicion and alienation then brooding over her mind, there could
not but be a delicious feeling in this tender need of my touch, in
this involuntary cry for my presence. Even though in normal days
she had usually kept a tight rein over that need and veiled it with
mischievous speech, she was at all events more herself than ever
since she sailed for America. Her old self might be outrageously
impatient or bitter, no doubt often provoked by my awkwardness or
stupidity, but swiftly grew tender and apologetic at my pain. So
now, it would happen that I had not been an hour in my solitary
room after having thus grievously torn myself away, before she had
scribbled on any odd fragment of paper a few words of love and
consolation and sent it across to me by the special nurse. In the
agitation of those days only two of these notes were saved. They
show, even in their incoherence, how the unbalance of her mind
threw her the more helplessly into my arms. The first is on a small
scrap of an old letter: "My Loved One, I <i>want</i> you <i>so</i>
much at once. You must come, please, and you can go whenever you
want&mdash;10.30 or whenever you like, but because I love and want
you tell this sister when I may expect you, for I want you, Wifie."
The next is in shape more like her usual letters, though in
substance distracted:</p>

<p class="quote">"April 12, 1916. My Beloved, Don't be hurt. I love
you so. Come as early as you can to-morrow and we will map out the
near future and the further future if Lily wills. She alone can
send me to heaven. I'll do all I can for you and all in this near
crisis and would give all to-night for one of you who love me so
much to send me to sleep, but you alone I need this moment. Sister
is helping me with that ham, and I am loving you. I long for you,
but won't upset them, and you always understand. Ohl to be with you
here, and they want me to go soon and you and I need each other for
ever. I long to see you and I want you to come early. I'm just as
ever yours and you can tell the fifty darlings who love me if I die
that all is well. I kiss you, sweetheart, and will help you later
and you me. Come soon. Your own Wifie."</p>

<p>I have not before mentioned this special nurse, and it is
necessary to go back a few weeks. After the fall from the window,
everyone became so alarmed&mdash;though she never had another
impulse of violence&mdash;that the stay at the Nursing Home could
not be prolonged and a new solution of the problem had to be found.
It was considered by the doctors, and I agreed, that admission to a
hospital for the insane, as a voluntary patient, would be the best
method, and Doctor Hamilton wrote to one or two well-known asylums
in and near London. But the suicidal attempt proved an insuperable
difficulty. They would not accept her as a voluntary boarder. The
question of her certification as a lunatic was raised. But that was
more than I could bear, except as a last resort when every other
effort had failed. I knew what it would mean to her, and the
thought of carrying her off by some ruse, when she was still so
alive to everything round her, and leaving her a prisoner in an
asylum was more than I could bear. Then it was suggested&mdash;I
think the idea arose in my own mind&mdash;that a trained mental
nurse should be brought down, so that the patient might have
skilful attention and at the same time the Mother Superior be in
some degree relieved of responsibility. I agreed at once. Dr.
Hamilton communicated with a London mental nursing institution and
in due course the nurse arrived. In this long chain of fatal events
she represents a link which I look back on with satisfaction, for
she took us safely across a perilous point and there was never any
further mention of an asylum after she arrived. By a rare chance
she was at once a capable and experienced nurse and a human,
youthful, and agreeable person, with no offensively professional
airs; we discovered, some while after she came, that she was
married. Edith, so sensitive to personality, accepted her at once,
and became more soothed, so that, if I remember well, I soon ceased
to be tortured by my farewells at night. Nothing happened to
disturb her; she was slowly recovering from the fall, and seemed to
be more herself mentally. The loss of will-power had gone, as well
as the fantastic notions; she was craving for strength and
activity; and, while before she came she could not be persuaded to
touch any stimulant, she now begged me to bring her champagne,
though she was not allowed to have it.</p>

<p>But although all was going well, the Mother Superior still
wished the patient to leave as soon as possible. The nurse
suggested and recommended a Nursing Home in London, specially for
convalescent mental and nervous cases, situated near the Crystal
Palace. This was an excellent plan; I accepted it, and agreed all
the more readily as the Home was within a bus drive of my Brixton
flat; Edith took it to be a general Nursing Home, but that involved
no difficulty.</p>

<p>At about this period indeed&mdash;while the events of these days
are stamped on my mind I cannot always place them in the exact
order&mdash;Edith asked me, indeed implored me, to take her to the
Brixton flat. I could not see my way to do so under all the
circumstances. But I am still tortured by the possibility that her
impulse was right and that if I had had her close beside me at that
turning point her mental health might have been furthered and any
alienation from me have been prevented. Her own feeling I
understand perfectly. My presence had always meant rest to her, and
tender, devoted love. To be with me seemed to her at this time,
more than ever before, refreshment and almost salvation. But she
had no clear recollection of her own state during the weeks we had
just passed through. She knew she had been very ill, and not
herself, but it was only a vague dream to her, at most a nightmare.
She was unable to realise the tension of my anxiety, or the
apprehensions which all around her were feeling. She had forgotten,
moreover, that she did not really any longer like living in the
flat and that it was not in any case a fit place for an invalid. I
would have everything on my hands and often be obliged to leave her
alone, so that, should any tragic event occur, I should feel, and
others would feel, that the blame fell on me. But she was not in a
condition to realise the force of these considerations. Even if she
had been I think she would, in my position, have flung them aside.
For years she had loved Swinburne's poem, "The Leper," and often
read it aloud in her beautiful impressive voice in her public
readings even to the end.</p>

<p>It is true that I fancy she was perhaps thinking, when she read
it, more of Lily than of me. But I take it to myself now. It is one
of the strange things that give unity to my life that at the outset
the first verse of that poem should so often have sung itself
joyously in my youthful brain as I carried my two buckets of water
from the well at Sparkes Creek:</p>

<p class="poem">"Nothing is better, I well think,<br>
Than love; the hidden well-water<br>
Is not so delicate to drink."</p>

<p>That seemed to express my outlook on the threshold of life,
though now, as I near the end, it is the last verse that I say over
again in my brain:</p>

<p class="poem">"A scribe's work writ awry and blurred."</p>

<p>And I wonder whether that may not sum up my experiences of love
in the world. For whatever the world may think of me, of good or of
evil, of myself I only think as of a lover, very humbly, a lover
who has fallen far short of perfection. Nothing in the end really
matters but love. For other things are of the individual but love
is of the species. It is Nature, or, as the early Christians said,
Love is God.</p>

<p>When we reached Paddington Station, I had the first indication
of a change of phase in her mental state, and that the pathetic
phase of loss of will power was at all events over. She went
towards the telephone box to arrange to go and see at once her
friend Dr. Ettie Sayer. In my nervous apprehension concerning her
ability to look after herself I tried to lead her away and to
continue the journey as arranged. But her old spirit of
independence revived; she fiercely resented my attempt to control
her actions; so I desisted. We went to Ettie Sayer's, had breakfast
with her, and then continued the journey to the Home at
Sydenham.</p>

<p>Here at first everything went well. It was a comfortable and
well-managed place, and Edith's native receptiveness of new
impressions, her open-hearted impulses of friendliness came into
renewed play, even with a morbid exaggeration, for she only slowly
realised that this was exclusively a Home for convalescent mental
and nervous cases. She was delightfully conscious of her renewed
energy, though, as soon became clear, at all events to her friends,
this was not her own sane and normal energy. It was arranged that
our old friend Dr. Barker Smith, who had from of old given her his
advice from time to time, should visit her in his medical capacity
during her stay. I well remember his first visit (and he also
referred to it lately to me nine years after) when she was lying in
bed the second day after her arrival. She sat up as he entered the
room, flung her arms wide open as he approached, embraced, and
kissed him. She had never done so before, having no close personal
affection for him, but I seem to understand the wave of emotion
which merged up in her at that moment. She realised the crisis she
had passed through, and on seeing again this old friend out of the
past it seemed to her that she had come home again safe and sound.
Possibly, also, she remembered that Barker Smith himself had once
had a sad mental break-down, and a fellow-feeling was part of this
impulsive out-going.</p>

<p>For the time all seemed to be moving in the right direction. She
was pleased with the Home and noted it down in her address book as
a place to be recommended. I came to see her from Brixton nearly
every day and my visits were always welcome. There was no shadow
between us. But that implacable Fate which with damnable iteration
dragged her apart from me during all those months again
intervened.</p>

<p>An American woman, a stranger but a friend of Edith's dear
friends in New York, was passing through London, and Edith invited
her to call at the Home. She game and was evidently fascinated, as
so many were even to the end, by Edith's vivid personality and
delightful conversation. She stayed so long that Edith&mdash;with
the defective sense for the proprieties which now marked
her-'&mdash;took on herself the duties of hostess and invited her
visitor to spend the night at the Home. But there was no vacant
room, the Superintendent happened to be away that night, and the
nurses could not act on their own authority. The visitor seems to
have been lacking not merely in tact, but in common sense. But
Edith was furious; she had always had the highest sense of a
hostess's duty to a guest, whatever her poverty or her weariness,
and always succeeded in being a lavish and charming hostess. So
that when circumstances baffled that deep-rooted impulse it was a
serious shock in her state of unstable equilibrium. The visitor had
no choice but to leave the house, on her way finding an opportunity
to send me a vaguely disturbing telegram to announce Edith's
departure at once, which was somehow delivered at my door at four
in the morning. I had been too long on the rack of apprehension for
any further twist of the screw to produce much effect. I lay
quietly in bed until there would be some means of conveyance to the
Crystal Palace and arrived before breakfast. She was prepared to
leave and received me cheerfully, without much surprise. We had
breakfast peacefully together. I settled the account and we left.
She had swiftly decided&mdash;for her old aptitude for swift
decision had now returned&mdash;to go to an old friend in the west
end of London. For a few weeks she staved with various old friends,
often, I fear, with discomfort to herself, and sometimes, I knew,
to the discomfort of her friends, who could not help realising that
she was scarcely in a normal condition. I was helpless, and her
mood of pathetic dependence on me was changing to a mood, much more
painful, of ostentatious independence. She said this was out of
consideration for me, in order that she might give me no more
trouble, and so much was the quality of her mind changed that I was
no longer able to discern clearly whether or not such a notion
expressed her genuine feeling and was not a pretext. Certainly the
underlying movement was a change in her cyclic mental
state&mdash;in what later might have been termed her schizoid
temperament&mdash;from morbid apathy to morbid energy. In this
reaction from one extreme to the other she not only Jost all wish
to return to my flat but suddenly and unexpectedly arrived one
morning to carry away all her heavy luggage.</p>

<p>She herself rejoiced in this return of energy, unable to realise
how factitious it was. She knew she had been nervously and mentally
ill, though the details were obscure to her. Her great desire now
was to go back to Cornwall, not merely to settle up affairs at the
cottage but especially, I am sure, to demonstrate to friends that
she was restored to health and was now again her old self. I knew
this visit would be a mistake, and I asked her lawyer and Dr. Ettie
Sayer, the two friends in whom she was now putting most trust, to
assist me in persuading her not to go, but they professed to be
helpless in the matter. I knew that I was now helpless. I talked
matters over with Olive Schreiner, knowing her affectionate regard
for Edith. Her advice was decisive; she said that in a state of
mental instability such as Edith was in people were always liable
to turn against those who were nearest and dearest to them; she
advised me to go away to Spain for six months. I replied that the
more serious Edith's condition the less possible it was for me to
go away. I must be on the spot in case of emergency, to be ready
when she needed me. All that I would agree to do was to go quietly
into the country for a few days. Soon afterwards I went, in
consequence, to Brandon in Norfolk, staying at the "White Hart,"
where I had often stayed before in happier circumstances, and
walked about in misery for two or three days while a steady rain
fell.</p>

<p>My quiet and brief withdrawal from London without notice to
Edith may seem a simple thing. But it was really unique in our life
together. Never before had I made any movement without keeping in
touch with her. And by the tragic irony of life&mdash;which in a
novel we would condemn as not lifelike&mdash;she also, who had
never before gone anywhere without making arrangements with me, she
also on that very same day went off to Cornwall without a word to
me. Her mind was, I realise, firmly made up to go to St. Ives to
demonstrate her health and sanity to her friends, but she knew I
was opposed to her plan, and so for fear I might make it difficult
she decided to slip away quietly. She had not gone alone. Beside a
faithful little servant, Annie, to help in settling up things at
the cottage and packing what she would need for a new home in
London, she had also taken down with her an ambiguous youth she had
lately met by chance in an omnibus, and finding he had just been
left an orphan took him under her protection, called him her
"adopted son," and as he was almost penniless, though trying to get
on the stage, she assisted him with gifts and clothes, though
really far from able to afford such generosity. He was a worthless
youth, who repaid her kindness with callous indifference, and in
later years I was told that he found his way to prison.</p>

<p>The incidents of that sad journey to Cornwall, so eagerly
undertaken, I never heard in any coherent shape. She was too deeply
wounded, largely, she felt, through me, ever to talk about it, and
I only heard little fragments from the reports of friends who felt
the matter was too painful to say much to me about. But I knew that
she went to her old and really devoted friends, determined to show
that all her mental and physical vigour had come back to her, and
quite prepared to emphasise it by a little artificial energy and
merriment. But when she came away the memory of her that remained
was of a gloom that nothing had occurred to change. Our pessimistic
friend the Irish doctor had spread about the worst rumours as to
her mental state, and when she reappeared he felt it his duty to
let her friends know that they must be cautious for she might be
"dangerous." So that when she came to them wearing her old radiant
air and expecting a joyous welcome, she was received with alarm and
reserve, and not even allowed to see the children. Nor was this
all; not only was her eager wish to rehabilitate herself dashed to
the ground. In that small centre of gossip where she knew nearly
everyone of all classes and all knew her, rumours, true and false,
could not fail to spread concerning her illness and disappearance.
They soon reached her when she was in the midst of them; she heard
that she was to be shut up in a lunatic asylum, that I had "signed
papers" to enable this to be done, and even that orders were now
out to carry her away. As happens when the mind has lost its normal
stability, while she could obstinately refuse to accept reasonable
statements, even from me, she had become easily credulous of
unreasonable statements, and ready to believe the worst of these
stories. Leaving Annie to complete arrangements at the cottage so
intimately associated with our life together, which she (or I) was
never to see again, she hurriedly returned to London with the boy
by the night train, viewing with alarm everyone who approached the
carriage door. Yet even then, and, as her actions showed, never at
any time after, did she in heart turn against me. Her love&mdash;as
to-day, nearly ten years later, I see more clearly than ever when I
look back&mdash;was so deeply founded in the mysterious depths
below consciousness that nothing could upset and no loss of mental
stability loosen it. I had acted, it seemed to her, with a
treachery she could not have conceived possible, but it seemed
weakness, weakness she must guard against but deserving of pity and
not forfeiting love. When the train reached Paddington in the early
morning, and it was not clear to her where to go, the thought of
the old refuge in time of trouble instinctively came back to her:
"We will go to dear Havelock," she said. "Dear Havelock indeed!"
exclaimed the youth (as she told me afterwards), callously
reminding her of the rumours they had heard. They came and came in
vain. I was not there to comfort her. I arrived back from Brandon
some hours later in equal need of comfort; my heart aches
still.</p>

<p>It is easy to understand that with thoughts and activities so
tied to Edith at this period my ordinary public work in literature
was impeded. But it was not entirely arrested. That, indeed, I
could not in any case afford. I was still writing
articles&mdash;for the most part more or less round the
War&mdash;for the chief English weeklies, the <i>Nation</i> and the
<i>New Statesman,</i> and in the course of the year. I published a
miscellaneous collection of these under the title of <i>Essays in
War-time</i>. I was also making occasional <i>Impressions and
Comments</i> for the Second Series of that work, not, however,
published until five years later, in which I am pleased to think my
art of writing reached its highest point. I was at the same time
certainly doing much of the laborious preparatory work for my
proposed big volume on the Genius of Europe. A long absence of
letters to Perrycoste is an index to the general state of my
correspondence at this time. The first letter in 1916 to Perrycoste
was written from Brixton in July, to arrange a meeting, and I quote
a few sentences: "We can have a little meal somewhere in this
neighbourhood and generally discuss our own and the world's
affairs...I have had an exceedingly trying time since last autumn
owing to the distressing nervous breakdown of my wife, poor health
of my own, and general worries due to present circumstances. It is
only during recent weeks that I have attained a little peace and
been able to resume work." Next month I had occasion to write to
Perrycoste again, and I quote a paragraph: "I hope your <i>Usages
of War</i> will get itself published. It seems to me the subject is
quite interesting just now, and I should myself have probably found
it very helpful in writing some of my <i>Essays in War-time</i> of
which the proofs are now coming in. If I have a spare set, and you
would care to see them, I should be pleased to send them on." The
next letter to Perrycoste is dated September 6th: "I am now
enclosing the rough proofs of my <i>Essays,</i> in case you care to
glance at them, and then throw them away. I do not expect you will
always agree, and they are, also, far too slight and popular for my
own taste! I hesitated considerably about republishing them at all.
I take much more interest in my big book on Europe...Glad to hear
that there is some chance of your <i>Usages of War</i> appearing.
But it ought to be published <i>at once.</i> The subject is
interesting now and next year it may be less so. We shall be more
interested in peace then." But I am here in advance of my narrative
and close to the fatal end of this phase of my life.</p>

<p>It must, however, have been immediately after Edith's final and
unhappy visit to Cornwall that she formed a resolution that was in
flagrant contrast to the whole past tenor of her life, and up to
now would have been unthinkable to her. Whether, as I now suspect,
the idea was put into her head by her lawyer I shall never know,
but she decided that she must have a legal separation from me. It
was a legal separation only that she had in mind&mdash;not a
separation in any other sense, not even a separate domicile. Her
deep love remained unshaken; she still realised that we belonged to
each other. But she had come to believe&mdash;and nothing
henceforth shook the belief&mdash;that I had been proposing to shut
her up in an asylum. She felt, for the first time, that she could
not trust me; I had done what, in my place, she could never have
done; I had been weak, probably led away by others, but my weakness
had amounted to a treachery from which she must in future guard
herself. Once, a little later, only once, she spoke to me quite
gently about her feeling in this matter. I should have known, she
told me, that in those periods of depression all that she needed
was to be alone with me and have my loving care and companionship,
and she would not fail to come through. But the memory of that time
was a vague dream to her; she knew she had been ill, but the
details were dim and altogether forgotten. She was never able to
see, and I was never able to make clear to her, that she had been
having my love and devotion and companionship by day and by night,
until the growing difficulties seemed insuperable, and that even
then I had not consented to her certification for an asylum but had
successfully eluded that decision by bringing her to the Home at
Sydenham. It was a simple position but she could never accept it;
she used to say she "had proof" (which of course she could not
produce), and if I seemed to be emphasising my care for her she
would assure me that it should never be necessary again and she
would never more be a burden to me. I will not be sure that she was
unconscious of the cruelty of her words, for she well knew that in
love are no burdens. It was part of her new policy&mdash;reversing
the habits of a lifetime&mdash;never to ask my advice or consult me
beforehand. So not until the contract of separation was arranged
and drawn out was her lawyer instructed to send it to me for my
acceptance. It was a pathetic yet characteristic proof of her
tenderness, even over this seemingly hostile action, that she
carefully impressed upon the lawyer that the document was to be
sent so as to reach me in the morning and not in the evening lest
it should worry me and prevent sleep. She was distressed when she
heard from me later that he had carelessly disregarded her request.
But in my state of tense and prolonged anxiety, the document hardly
came as a new trouble, even though it raised a new problem, but
almost as a relief. During the next day or two I asked the advice
of Olive Schreiner; I think she was the only friend to whom I did
confide the matter, as she was the friend of us both; she was not
perhaps the wisest of counsellors, but my mind was really made up
already. Without hesitation she advised me to accept the proposed
arrangement.</p>

<p>I was the more willing to do so because I fully entered into
Edith's motives and altogether shared them. I recognised that there
was no change in her love and that it was not even a personal
separation that she desired, far from it. What she had come in her
disturbed mental state to think was that, owing to some strange and
altogether unexpected perversity or weakness on my part, I had
become a menace to her personal freedom. She had always been the
most independent of beings; she had always resented, and from me as
much as from anyone, the lightest touch that seemed to be of
compulsion; in that respect, at all events, she remained her old
self. I delighted in her freedom, and in her impulsiveness, even
when it happened to be a little embarrassing, for it is in my
nature to feel such delight. I had never applied or desired to
apply any compulsion. So that I was glad to give her the proof that
this was so&mdash;however sad that it seemed to be
necessary&mdash;and I was even relieved to be assured that I should
never even be called upon to apply any compulsion to her, for that
possibility had been a source of torture to me during the past
months. This "Deed of Separation," as Edith's legal friend (whom I
also personally knew) wrote in submitting it to me, was a matter
for amicable arrangement, a mutual agreement to be settled
"voluntarily without any pressure." It set forth that Edith "may at
all times hereafter live separate and apart as if she were sole and
unmarried," and that I should not "for any purpose whatsoever use
any force or restraint to her person or liberty." That was the
essence of the Deed, and it merely stated a position which we had
both of us accepted and acted on throughout our life together as a
matter of course. A clause was added, due to the fear that I might
be saddled by her debts, that she would indemnify me against all
debts and at all times keep and maintain herself, which also had
been a mutual understanding from the first. There was a final
clause which was deeply significant and, as I well know, expressive
of her underlying feeling throughout: "It is expressly agreed and
declared that in case the said parties hereto shall at any time
temporarily live together as man and wife the same shall not put an
end to or render void the separation or any of the covenants herein
contained."</p>

<p>We went one morning to the rooms of the Law Society in Fetter
Lane, and, in the presence of two lawyers, duly signed this
document. Then we left the lawyers&mdash;I wonder what they said to
each other&mdash;and went away in a taxi to have lunch together,
just as though nothing whatever had happened. I cannot, indeed,
recall that we ever talked on the subject again. Her mind was now
at ease on that point and I had accepted the arrangement once and
for all.</p>

<p>It seems a strange deed of separation, perhaps one of the
strangest ever drawn up. Yet it meant exactly what it said and it
meant no more than it said. It made no change in my love for her,
and I am very sure it made no change in her love for me. She showed
that in every little way. She still wore her wedding ring; she
still carried round her neck the locket in which she bore a little
portrait of me together with that of her dearest woman friend (I
treasure that locket yet). She still cherished all the proofs of
our love and still continued to manifest her tenderness by tiny
gifts. Most significant of all, when during the next few weeks she
took for herself a flat in the north of London, almost her first
care was to arrange that the room next to her own living and
bedroom should be fitted up as a bedroom for me.</p>

<p>That, indeed, sadly revealed that the new arrangement had in one
sense produced a more real separation on my side than on hers,
although no change in my love. I passively cooperated in all the
arrangements for the new flat, which was in the same building as
that of an old friend of hers, though not one to whom she felt
closely attached. It was more expensive than any place she or I had
ever taken before, but I now felt unable to remonstrate that it was
beyond her means. I accompanied her on all her visits to agents and
upholsterers. It was not until long after that I suspected she had
a motive beyond the obvious one in desiring me to accompany her on
these visits. She had always been open as the day with those she
loved, and I. failed to realise that the presence of a husband is a
guarantee in business arrangements of this kind. Scheming had
always been foreign to her nature, and it was hard for me to
recognise how disease was subtly changing her mind. When the room
was ready for me, however, I always refused to come and occupy it.
The feeling may have been an unworthy one&mdash;I am willing now to
think that it was&mdash;but it seemed to me a little ridiculous for
a man to share rooms with a wife who had just arranged a legal
separation from him. So I only occupied the room once, and that on
the night she died. It grieves me now, for she had always nervously
dreaded sleeping when no one was within reach. Only a few weeks
earlier I had been at her side day and night, a perpetual source of
comfort. Now, as I learnt at the end, the same need was returning
and she had to beg friends to come and stay the night at the flat.
Fortunately, wherever she might be, there were always devoted
friends at hand, and at this time I knew there were at least two
whose tender sympathy and help meant much for her. After some weeks
she converted the room intended for me into a lecture room, with a
little platform, and here to scanty audiences, chiefly of friends
and acquaintances, she gave lectures and readings at frequent
intervals. She was anxious I should come to "take the chair," at
one of the lectures, just to show, she said, that we were not
really separated. She well knew that I always refused any kind of
public appearance. But I am sure she was disappointed. It would not
have been a really public appearance since often less than half a
dozen people came, and perhaps none of them strangers. Now, ten
years afterwards, this remains among the things I would gladly do
when the chance to do them has passed away for ever.</p>

<p>She was now entering into that stage of furious activity which
represented the exalted phase of the mental circular state which in
its opposite period of helpless depression she had passed through a
few months earlier in Cornwall. It seemed to her that she was her
normal self again, and that large new possibilities of work were
opening out in all directions. New friends who had faith in her
ideas, as well as new parasites who hoped to profit by them,
gathered around her. To me it seemed sadly as though the mainspring
of a watch had broken and was swiftly unwinding itself to the final
end. A friend who saw her at this time, after a long absence, with
clairvoyant eyes, wrote to another friend: "Mrs. Ellis is dying.
What can be done?" But nothing could be done.</p>

<p>The number of plans and schemes with which she actively occupied
herself during these last four months seemed almost endless. There
were not only the lectures and readings which she gave almost daily
at the room in her own flat, sometimes elsewhere, and even planned
to give at the Bechstein (now Wigmore) Hall, the owners of which,
after giving permission, later withdrew it. She was starting a
little publishing business at her flat, which she called The
Shamrock Press, employing a firm of printers near by, who printed
off for her, from the plates in her possession, the sheets for a
considerable edition of her volume of short stories, <i>My Cornish
Neighbours</i>; I found several big bales of these sheets at the
flat after her death and, not knowing what to do with them in the
midst of the Great War or even where to store them, I left them
behind to be destroyed. Among other proposed publications was a
pamphlet by the popular novelist, Marie Corelli&mdash;not a writer
who would normally have appealed to her&mdash;and she extravagantly
motored up to Marie Corelli's house at Stratfordon-Avon, where her
persuasiveness prevailed upon the novelist, who, however, shortly
after, wrote withdrawing her permission, as her agent would not
agree, though the letter showed that she had been won by Edith's
personality. The hire of the car, by the way, she never paid, but
it was proof of the trust she inspired&mdash;and a trust that when
she was her real self she never betrayed&mdash;that the car-man
took her a number of other long journeys which remained unpaid,
until, after her death, I gradually settled nearly the whole of the
large bill, for he was a poor man, and I carefully, selected among
her many debts those which seemed to me to mean most to the
creditors, though by our separation arrangement I was not
responsible for any. She always loved motoring&mdash;though she had
never before indulged in it by these reckless and dubious
methods&mdash;and it always stimulated and benefited her. Another
scheme was to buy a car and make it pay by hiring it out; she had
at her death paid several instalments for its purchase, and they
were never refunded by the dishonest sellers. Perhaps more
important than any of these schemes was a film-producing company
she began to establish in order to assist in raising the level of
the screen. She was herself to write some of the scenarios, and she
had obtained the co-operation of a film-actress of some promise and
a manager of some experience, though I understand that neither of
them would have proved quite satisfactory. But her death occurred
before the company was really constituted, though money for shares
was already being offered and given by friends and sympathisers. At
the same time her dramatic and literary interests combined in a
plan to take the Little Theatre in Chicago during the coming winter
season. She was also studying to write on Swedenborg; she wanted to
take one of her secretaries to the British Museum Reading Room, and
obtain the use of a private room there; I dissuaded her from making
what seemed to me an impossible request; in some matters she was
still ready to accept my judgment even to the end, distracted by
strange notions as her mind had become. This list of her activities
is by no means complete: I will only mention one other, not
connected with any thought of financial profit, and that was her
interest towards the end in the Sufi movement led by Inayat Khan. I
hardly think this movement would have appealed to her in earlier
days&mdash;and it is not clear to me how far its leader was a
charlatan&mdash;but it appealed to her now, as to others whose
minds were becoming imperfectly balanced, and she tried to serve
its cause and to make it more widely known.</p>

<p>It is not surprising that in this feverish medley of incongruous
activities&mdash;through which she was receiving highfrequency
electrical treatment from her friend Dr. Ettie Sayer who possessed
a very special installation&mdash;she required two secretaries. It
is perhaps also not surprising that, with her original sanguine
temperament now running uncontrolled, she believed that schemes
which really needed half a dozen guiding brains would swiftly bring
in money. Some of them really gave promise of doing so; a certain
amount of money came in and she obtained more by borrowing from
friends and acquaintances in a way she would never have done in
earlier days. (I later repaid various such debts.) But she lavished
it so recklessly on herself and others that she was sometimes
actually penniless and scarcely able to obtain food. I never knew
that till after the end, for she observed her vow of independence
from me, or I would have taken means to help her. But I was
troubled by her extravagances and I remember gently reproaching her
for sending me a telegram when a postcard would have served. She
replied in an almost shy way which touches me still that a telegram
was "more affectionate."</p>

<p>In her letters of this time, however, the affection was far from
unmixed, nor was it at our meetings. It was that, perhaps, even
more than what seemed to me the embarrassing situation caused by
our legal separation, that held me much aloof. It sometimes seemed
difficult for her to write to me without bringing in ancient
grievances which we had really long outlived, or the new fantastic
charges I had vainly sought to explain as baseless. I had come to
realise that explanation was fruitless in her morbid condition. I
recall how, again and again, I wrote to her, gently, almost
hopefully, that there were cobwebs in her brain, and that when
these were swept away all would be well. She kept none of these
letters and I find that I kept none of hers.</p>

<p>But I find one of July I had preserved, and it shows not only
how her feverish activities were wearing her away, but how like she
was to her old self when she forgot these cobwebs, and how closely,
through everything, we remained associated.</p>

<p class="quote">"My Darling Boy, I'd a lovely day yesterday,
ending with a long visit from Edward C. [Carpenter] and George.
They had supper here and Edward was divine. I want so to read his
<i>Life</i> and I hope he will send me a copy. All the Hinton stuff
[MS. of her book] goes in at three on Wednesday, so if you like I
could come on, with what I don't finish and send to-day, to the
British Museum at 11 that day, and bring my secretary with
typewriter in case of emergency, as she can then take it to be
mended on her way home and you can lunch with me if you will. I'm
full of adventures and there is no doubt whatever about the
future&mdash;none. Whelan is delighted and glories over my success.
I've heard from Bourchier and Otho Stuart to-day. <i>Such</i> a
batch of letters from America. Thank you for the photos&mdash;just
what is needed. I am looking forward to asking you to be a
shareholder in our Company (Cinema). A splendid chance to invest
money.<br>
<br>
"P.S. Cannot get away to Museum as there is an urgent Committee
here at 11.30, but do come here as soon after 9 in the morning as
you can and look over what I have ready to take at three. You can
be quite alone in my room as the committee is in lecture room. Stay
on while you can. I am giving 3 speeches on Friday, and Mrs.
Wentworth James is paying me to go to her At Home and speak before
my lecture on Friday.&mdash;Thank you for [reading lamp] candles
just received. Yours ever, Wifie."</p>

<p>When she came to my flat there was always the same uncertainty.
She would come now and then, without announcing her visit
beforehand, when she happened to be free or anywhere in the
neighbourhood, accompanied by a friend (she told me she had been
"warned" not to come alone), always impelled, I am sure, by the
loving impulse of her old self, but it nearly always happened that
before she had been long in my room the new morbid self would come
to the surface, and (sometimes first putting the friend in another
room) she would cast at me all the now familiar charges of my
falsity and my designs on her freedom, of which she had "positive
proof." I would endure the flood of speech patiently, knowing that
she was an ill person against whom all argument was powerless; but
it would sadden and leave me crushed. One such visit was typical.
She was accompanied by her dear friend Y., who told me afterwards
how lovingly Edith had spoken of me in proposing the visit and how
pleased she (Y.) was at that disposition. But Edith had not long
then been in the room when, in Y.'s presence, the old charges were
launched again with the old indignation. I bore the invectives
gently, with scarce a word. On their way back, as she later told
me, Y. reproached Edith for her harshness, and Edith replied: "But
think of the things he said to me!" Y. was rendered speechless.</p>

<p>My visits to her, which I always announced beforehand or made in
response to her invitation, went off more easily, though not
altogether happily. For I always felt that though she was genuinely
pleased that I should come to her, my good reception was partly
also due to my being a guest, for she never lost her impulse of
graciousness to a guest. She would busy herself to make me
comfortable; she would prepare me a little meal with her old skill,
often a very simple meal (and I later knew why), though a glass of
wine was never lacking; the familiar accusations were not brought
forward. All this time, also, and to the end, she was showing
tender thought by sending me little presents, as I to her, and
occasionally we would meet for a Promenade Concert at the Queen's
Hall. The last concert she proposed we never went to; it seemed to
me that the Symphony for that night was uninteresting, and I wrote
to her to postpone our concert meeting for a few days. But the
concert was postponed for ever; the time had arrived for her fatal
illness and I do not forgive myself for that postponement. It so
chanced that a few days later I went to a Promenade Concert by
myself and sat next to a young woman who in the course of it began
to sob bitterly, no doubt having lost some dear one in the war. How
often, in the period that followed, a sob was in my own heart at
those concerts endeared to me by beautiful memories.</p>

<p>Before that, somewhere towards the end of August, Edith came
with a friend on her last visit to Brixton. It is the season when
Muscat grapes, a favourite luxury for both of us, are cheap, and I
had placed aside a bunch to give or take to her on my next visit.
But when she went away she left me, as often before, sad and
crushed; that the grapes were forgotten is almost all I can recall
of the visit.</p>

<p>Yet her letters were often still touched by the old tenderness
that never died. I have one of August 28th:</p>

<p class="quote">"My Darling Boy, I have been too utterly busy to
write and even now I've no time to do it fully. Come here if
possible to-morrow at 12.30, stay to lunch, and I'll explain
everything. I've had to go to Stratford-on-Avon from Friday to
Monday on business and had a glorious time including an hour alone
with Marie Corelli who has taken a great fancy to me, including the
promise to publish her next book through the Shamrock Press. I am
in full swing and can soon prove that I am no failure in any way. I
hope to find you better, so do come and lunch alone with me here.
Your loving old wife."</p>

<p>A few days later (1st September):</p>

<p class="quote">"My Darling Boy, I would have gone to the
Promenade Concert but until Tuesday I am very busy. Here is a
patent tie thing you put under your tie to keep it nice. Wednesday,
if you like, we can go to a concert but let me know early. I was to
have gone to Stratford to Marie Corelli to-day to see about many
things but so much to do. Do send us more typing when you care to
as we are getting on well at last. With love and hoping you are
better, believe me yours as ever, Wife. Shall we dine together
Wednesday and go to concert later?" It was the concert I fatally
postponed.</p>

<p>These letters were significant and pathetic. We see the feverish
activity and we see what was a key to it. She realised her
breakdown of energy and will-power during the winter: "I can soon
prove that I am no failure." Yet these final letters are in the
main just the rapid, simple, spontaneous, businesslike,
sympathetic, affectionate letters she had written of old, sometimes
with little mistakes, and forgetfulness, the inevitable results of
the immense press of affairs she was plunging into.</p>

<p>The end draws near. Sunday, the 3rd of September, was the day
when the first Zeppelin was brought down in flames to the north of
London. She wrote next day:</p>

<p class="quote">"My Darling Boy, I am sorry you are not well. But
who is, with the war, worry, and work? I was at our front door at 3
a.m. on Sunday, watching Zeppelins, etc. I was not a bit afraid but
nearly everyone here was. As you do not seem very keen on seeing me
yet, just choose when you can, or care to, next week. If you care
to come here to lunch at one to-morrow I shall be alone till 3.30
when I read Swinburne. Do take care and let me see you soon. Yours
as ever, E.M.O.Ellis."</p>

<p>And next day a card: "Will be at Museum as near 12.30 to-morrow
(Wednesday) as I can. Want to see you. Take care. W." But on the
Wednesday she sent a card: "I am so sorry not to have lunched with
you to-day as Iam staying in bed with a sort of rheumatic chill;
and as I lecture to-morrow I had better remain in the house until
it is over." And on the following day a friend wrote a card for her
to say that "as she has rather high temperature she cannot go out.
She will write as soon as she is able and sends her love."</p>

<p>It appears that on the early Sunday morning the inmates of
Sandringham Court where she had her flat were awakened from sleep
by the rumour of the approaching Zeppelins. Throwing a few garments
over her pyjamas, chiefly a cloak, Edith went to stand in the
street doorway, with the little group of other inmates doing
likewise. One of them, a woman&mdash;I do not know who she
was&mdash;complained of feeling cold. Edith, impulsively and
characteristically, removed her own cloak and placed it round the
other woman, who selfishly accepted a protection which proved to be
at the cost of the giver's life. During the next few days the chill
developed. She gave to an interviewer a few words of impression of
the scene she had witnessed&mdash;the last words she ever gave for
publication. It was significant of illness poisoning her brain that
she drew several cheques at this time with no money at the bank to
meet them, so that they all came back; when she was her normal self
she had always had the greatest horror of a dishonoured cheque, and
her mental disorganisation could not be more conclusively shown.
But I believe that she still continued for a few days longer the
series of lectures and readings, which she had planned to extend
months ahead, in the spare room at her flat she had converted into
a little lecture room. However few the audience, they were a
pleasure and a stimulation to herself, and a friend has told me
that, though she might look fatigued when she began, she would
become her old radiant self, to the last, when delivering a
lecture. After her death I found on her desk&mdash;seemingly the
last thing with which she had been occupied before illness struck
her down&mdash;on the top sheet of a writing pad, under the heading
"Readings from Havelock Ellis," the words: "When many years
ago&mdash;about 28&mdash;I first read <i>The New Spirit</i> I knew
I loved the man who wrote it. To-day, in reading <i>Impressions and
Comments,</i> I realise that the man who has written both books is
worthy of love, forgiveness, and eternal comradeship, as a fine
spirit forges into beauty, however long it takes, and that not one
of us but many write not with ink but blood." With her last effort
of failing strength she had evidently been setting down the
introductory notes for a reading from my books. That writing pad is
now one of my cherished possessions.</p>

<p>For early September I had planned a visit of a couple of days
with my old friend Barker Smith to Clare in Suffolk. It was a
favourite spot of mine; I had often stayed there before, once with
Edith; I never expect to go again, even though, as I can now add
twenty years after the event, I spend happily my last days in
Suffolk only a short distance from Clare. We were preparing to
leave London on Monday the 11th and to return on Tuesday or
Wednesday. But after the 7th no further news of Edith reached me; I
began to grow anxious at the prolonged delay, and on the Saturday
made up my mind to go unannounced to her flat early next morning to
be assured that all was as well as might be before I left London. I
could not possibly have gone away in doubt, and that brief Sunday
morning visit still remains a memory, to redeem a little of the
misfortunes and stupidities which accompanied me in that period of
life.</p>

<p>I found her in bed with a nurse by her side. She was recovering,
I was told, from an attack of pleurisy. I could quite believe that
she was recovering for her physical condition seemed satisfactory,
while she was bright and cheerful; mentally, indeed, she seemed her
old self. It is well known that a physical disorder often has a
clarifying effect on a clouded brain, and even in ordinary times I
had often noted in Edith that any illness that kept her in bed
tended to have a beneficial psychic effect; so that I had often
felt more at ease about her when she had to rest in bed than when
she was energetically careering over the country. Also, I am sure,
my visit gave her pleasure. Once, whenever illness came, her first
thought was for my presence. In her new frame of mind, when she had
absurdly decided that she was to ask nothing of me, she had
refrained from giving news of herself. So that my spontaneous
anxiety, and this sudden visit&mdash;the first I had paid to her
flat without previous arrangement&mdash;joyfully reassured her
doubts, for she never understood my seeming aloofness. I felt her
pulse. I told her to put out her tongue, and she did so, but said
directly afterwards, with her mischievous playfulness, remembering
our formal separation: "You know you must not give me orders now!"
She assured me&mdash;as I seemed also to be able to see for myself
though I ought to have better realised the uncertainties&mdash;that
she would soon be well. She urged me to go to Clare; it would do me
good, she said. I knew that she had dear and attached friends who
were caring for her, while her skilful friend, Dr. Ettie Sayer, and
a kind local doctor were medically watching her. It seemed that all
was well. I stooped down to kiss her, but she would not let me for
fear there might be any infection. So I kissed her hand. It was the
last kiss I was ever to give her in life.</p>

<p>We are the idle playthings of Fate, and I went away feeling
happier and more at rest than I had felt for a long time past.</p>

<p>That same day she asked a friend to send a postcard to reach me
on Monday morning before I left London: "Mrs. Ellis is improving
hour by hour and the fever is diminishing. Instead of being as in
the beginning 103° it is now only 100°. And all is sure to be well
in a few days. She sends her love, and hopes you will have a good
time while away." On Monday from her bedside, in the hand of the
same friend came the last words she ever addressed to me: "your
wife has just got your kind letter and wishes me to say that she is
going on well, has no fever now, and the doctor says she is a
miracle as usual. She has a mountain of grapes by her bedside! Mrs.
Ellis has written to Mrs. Schreiner to ask her to stay here a few
days and sleep in her lecture room. She hopes you will have a
lovely time, and says she and Y. thought it the loveliest place
they had ever been in." The letter was awaiting me at breakfast in
the Bell Hotel at Clare on Tuesday morning, and seemed so
reassuring that a half-formed intention&mdash;for I was not
entirely without anxiety&mdash;to return to London that day was
changed and with Barker Smith I resolved to stay till Wednesday.
But all this stay at Clare save at one or two points is a dim
dream, effaced from memory. On Wednesday I duly returned and on
opening the door of my flat at Brixton I found on the floor a
telegram with the words: "Mrs. Ellis dying. Come at once." It had
been sent on Tuesday, by whom I never heard and never inquired. For
years, knowing the uncertainty of her health, I had opened
telegrams with apprehensive haste as though by a premonition that
some day by a telegram the fatal news would reach me. At last it
had come and I was not there to receive it. I open telegrams calmly
now.</p>

<p>At once I took a taxi and went to Maida Vale. The knocker of the
flat was muffled, everything was peaceful and in order, and the
nurse was by the bed. Not long before, a nurse who stood very high
in her own professional world had learnt to know and admire Edith;
she had appeared on the scene and taken superintendence of the
nursing arrangements. Doctors and nurses and friends had all been
at hand, to do everything that could be done. Only I had been
absent. I helped to lift her in the bed, when that was necessary to
shift the sheet, all that remained for me to do. I stayed in the
room, or in the next room, for the eight hours of feeble life that
remained to her. She was comatose; she had entirely lost the power
of speech or of recognition a few hours before I arrived. She gave
no sign at all. A cylinder of oxygen such as had helped her during
her serious illness in America made no difference now. After some
hours I went and lay down on a bed in the next room, the first and
last time I occupied the room she had been so pleased to prepare
for me a few months earlier. When the end was approaching one of
the two nurses who remained with her came to call me. Her breathing
was shallow but calm and regular. She who had lived so vividly, so
eagerly, often so tempestuously, died in perfect peace. Not the
slightest shudder passed over her as her spirit sank to silence,
merely the breathing grew slower; then there was a pause, then
another breath; then no more for ever. The two nurses quietly left
the room and left me alone, silently alone beside her silence.</p>

<p>It has often since seemed to me strange that I, who have lived
in hospitals, and attended the sick, and wandered through so many
regions of the world, in the whole of a life that is now little
short of seventy years (now indeed over eighty) should only have
seen two people die, and that those two should be the two women
nearest to me in the world, my mother and my wife. I am glad that
it has been so, and that the two persons whose departing spirits I
have been privileged to inhale should be just those.</p>

<p>In the early morning I slipped quietly away from the flat while
the nurses rested, and returned in profound melancholy, however
undemonstrative, to Brixton. During the next day or two I learnt
all that I was ever to know concerning my dead woman's last
conscious hours on earth. Her last letter to me, with its note of
cheerful optimism, seems to have sprung out of the little flameof
vitality which so often ushers the approach of Death. Next day
there had been a sudden change for the worse, too sudden,
fortunately, for her to realise it clearly. The fever in her lungs
was doubtless passing off, but it had used up her small vital
force, and the lurking diabetes came to the front to spread its
fatal veil of coma over her consciousness. But at first this veil
was imperfect. She could still sometimes recognise the persons
around her and from time to time, the nurse told me, she would
utter names of those dear to her, her friend Y.'s, mine, and, as I
would have known if never told, most often, Lily's. One incident of
that night is graven for ever on my heart. Unable to speak, she
pulled at the arm of the drowsy nurse beside her and pointed to the
picture of me on the wall in front. What she wished was not clear
to the nurse, who was too sleepy to try to find out. I can only
suppose that she desired me to be sent for. And another
thought&mdash;another memory from twenty-five years
earlier&mdash;has often come, even deliciously come, during the
years that have passed since that night. We know that in those who
have reached the final point of consciousness, as in coming near
drowning, the significant picture of the past life may float across
the final vision. Twentyfive years earlier, after our brief
honeymoon at Lamorna, she had written to me of the little "house" I
had playfully selected for her on the cliff with its foxglove
towers: "You made me think of how beautiful men could be...I think
when I'm dying I shall see that house and smell the fern-roots and
look into that blue sky and see the gulls and feel as near to the
heart of a great mystery as I did then." And now she was dying, and
the memory of me was tugging at the failing heart. I do not feel
foolish to believe that the vision she had foreseen passed at the
end before her dying eyes. And the old cry for me, now voiceless,
rose again within her, and she plucked at the drowsy nurse's sleeve
and pointed to the portrait on the wall.</p>

<p>She made no further spontaneous movement, though consciousness
was not yet abolished. In the morning when her doctor friend came
she was able, in response to her question, to recognise her by
saying "Ettiel" After that, nothing.</p>

<p>Some time previously, when it became clear that we should
henceforth be living little in Cornwall, Edith had given up the
grave she had too hastily bought near to Lily's grave in Lelant
churchyard. We then decided, after discussing the matter, that the
best method of burial is cremation, and of the rightness of that
decision I am ever more convinced. The cremation was arranged,
accordingly, at Golder's Green Crematorium. She had expressed the
wish that if any words were spoken they should be by Edward
Carpenter, for whom she had for so many years felt an affection and
admiration, almost a discipleship, such as she experienced for no
one else. Carpenter, no longer in robust health, was unable to come
from his home in the north at such short notice.* So we decided
that nothing should take place at the cremation save only the
playing of the organ, in which, at my suggestion, was included
Handel's familiar Largo, a piece which had always given her
peculiar joy and satisfaction; I think it somehow served to express
her own large and soaring and confident aspirations.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Shortly afterwards, however, he read a paper
about her at the first meeting of the Edith Ellis Fellowship, a
little group which met from time to time during several years.
(This paper was later prefixed to the volume she had planned,
entitled <i>The New Horizonn in Love and Life.</i>)]</p>

<p>There seemed to be many persons present&mdash;though no formal
notice had been given, and many who desired to be present were thus
prevented&mdash;but I was scarcely aware of them. I only know that
Olive Schreiner came, though ill, because, as she said, she knew
Edith would have liked her to. When the coffin is to glide into the
great furnace any special friends who so wish may come forward to
witness the consummation which is otherwise invisible to the
congregation. Algernon West and I went forward, as also (at his
request) Inayat Khan. As I gazed at that beautiful sight, at that
vast and seemingly liquid mass of golden intense heat, in which the
coin was so swiftly swallowed up, my pain at this last vision of
all that remained of the being who for all my active life had been
so near to me and so dear was merged into joy at the glory of the
vision. I realised how fitting it was that one whose spirit in
life, beyond any I ever knew, had been a flame, should pass from
the world in actual flame, a chariot of fire, to rise into the air,
and to become one with the panorama of sky and sea, with those
things on the earth to which she had been so exquisitively
sensitive because she herself was of like nature and destined to
join them. So no tear stained my cheek, as none had when the last
breath left her body. It has not been so since. Often, as I have
walked the street, at some memory or some scene, I have felt tears
brimming over my eyes, and even now&mdash;when it is ten years but
a few days since she left&mdash;it is so still.</p>

<p>Three days later I came with two or three friends to the
crematorium, to witness the scattering of the ashes over the quiet
and beautiful garden. This method of disposal seemed to me far
better than preservation in an urn, though it was only later that I
learnt from a friend that she once had actually expressed a wish
for her ashes to be scattered over the earth or the sea. The
attendant with the basket of ashes on his arm walked slowly and
gravely about scattering the ashes with his hand as he went. All
that was volatile of her body had passed into the air, and I was
glad that what remained would continue to live in the roses or even
only the grass.</p>

<p>No memorial of this ceremony was set up at the crematorium at
the time. I could not have borne the expense even if the wish to
put up any memorial had occurred to me. But a few years later it
was arranged that tablets might be set up in the clerestory to the
memory of friends whose remains had here been cremated. In due
course, some seven years afterwards, when able to afford the rather
considerable cost, I had a tablet set up in the central position of
a bay facing that part of the grounds where the ashes had been
scattered. After the arrangement had been made, I agreed to the
offer of Algernon West to take a quarter share in the expense, for
though I would gladly have taken it all myself I could not deny
this satisfaction to so good a friend who had tendered her his
whole-hearted devotion before I had ever met her, and never
withdrew it, even after her death assuming all the troublesome
duties of executor. The inscription I set up was one of the
earliest, by its date apparently much the earliest, for people do
not set up memorials to friends who died seven years previously. It
ran:</p>

<p class="poem">The Ashes of Edith, the wife and comrade of
Havelock Ellis, were scattered over this garden on the eighteenth
of September, 1916.</p>

<p>The formula of this inscription, sometime since imitated, was
new when I devised it, the old tombstone formula previously used on
crematorium monuments seeming to me unsuitable. I have left a space
on the tablet, so that it may one day, I hope, record that I have
been able to</p>

<p class="poem">"Marry my body to that dust<br>
It so much loves."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, from time to time, when the sun shines, I travel
across London to wander for a few minutes at least around that
spot, just as she herself, from time to time, used to go from
Carbis to the grave of her beloved Lily at Lelant to soothe her
nerves with peace, and come back refreshed. There the picture comes
back to me of the ashes of what I held so dear slowly scattered, in
a sudden gleam of bright sunshine, over the grass and amid the
flowers. And I stand once again alone in this lonely and pleasant
spot which holds so few memories of the dead and attracts so few of
the living. But in the years that have passed my favourite sister,
Louie's, remains have also been cremated here, and in the same bay
I have placed a little tablet to her memory, her dearest friend
Muriel Brown sharing in this, and still more recently it has been
Muriel's turn, and to her memory a tablet has been set up close to
Louie's. Sometimes there blows there a strong exhilarating breeze
from the west, such as we knew it to blow in Cornwall, and I meet
it with a sad joy as 'pass slowly round the garden and recall how
Edith wished that her friends should not be sad at her death but
rather make merry in her name. At such moments it is Nature that
makes merry in her ashes. The lawn that was smooth to receive those
ashes sometimes grows high and wild with various grasses in full
flower, and big patches of red sorrel and sheep's parsley here and
there, and scattered golden celandines and lady's slipper, where a
little apart is a huge bed of roses, white and red. She ever loved
flowers, and could never feel content if none were at her side,
even of the simplest, while roses were to her the most sacred
symbol of love. I know not if any of those who once loved her ever
come to this garden. For my part I am glad to hasten year after
year to the one spot where her mortal remains are still alive, if
only in leaves of grass. It was in flowers that her restless and
aspiring spirit sought peace and joy. Now she is among flowers and
flowers have become her very flesh.</p>

<p>To bring back my general mental attitude and external activities
during the months following Edith's death I cannot do better than
quote from my letters to Perrycoste. The first (November 17th) was
after an interval of some two months:</p>

<p class="quote">"Thank you much for your kind and sympathetic
letter. For a long time my wife's health had caused great anxiety
and distress; she was much unlike her old self and mental condition
impaired with the progress of the disease (diabetes). But just
latterly she had seemed more like herself, so that the sudden end
was the greater blow...As you may imagine all this has been a
source of additional grief to me, although I know that the end
(pneumonia leading to diabetic coma) could not have been more
merciful and gentle...She is constantly in my thoughts, and it is
quite true, as you say, that living entirely alone, as I do, one
dwells on things more, though I have no wish to recall too much the
painful and pathetic memories. I have various invitations to go
away (even to Florida) but, as you know, I do not care to stay with
friends, though I have just now been staying with one of my sisters
at Tunbridge Wells. I am very sorry to be shut out of Carbis Bay as
no place suits me so well in winter, but there are far too many
memories there, and I am trying to get rid of the lease of the
cottage to a friend. So far, also, I have had little strength or
spirits for work, and there are, too, a great many anxious worries
to deal with, for of late my wife lost critical judgment and
plunged so recklessly in new schemes of activity that the
liabilities are considerably more than can be met."</p>

<p>In my next (February 19th, 1917) I wrote:</p>

<p class="quote">"Thank you much for your sympathetic letter of 21
Nov. I am getting along as well as I could expect, and though
living alone&mdash;and through the wretched London winters after so
many winters in Cornwall&mdash;there is always someone or other to
see. I am also now doing a fair amount of work. Thank you also for
returning the <i>Edinburgh</i> [with my article on the Psychology
of the English]. You seem to be right as to sending to France
because although the regulations as published referred to enemy and
neutral countries, it is also taken to cover <i>allied</i>
countries. At present I am in correspondence with the War Office
with regard to a permit to send MSS. to American Magazines and as
several 'References' are required I have taken the liberty of
mentioning your name among others. I trust you will not object, and
I do not imagine they will trouble you. It is a completely
unnecessary piece of red-tapeism because, permit or no permit,
anything sent is still at the absolute discretion of the Censor. I
quite appreciate your criticism of my article: you must remember it
is really only an <i>abstract.</i> The whole essay is very much
longer and stuffed with facts and references. It will altogether be
a big and laborious book.&mdash;I wonder what has happened about
your War book.<br>
<br>
"In telling you of the order observed at the cremation at Golders
Green, I rather had it in mind to ask you if any suggestions have,
to your knowledge, been offered for the use of those who object to
religious funerals of the orthodox kind. It is rather an important
question now that so many people do object, and often submit merely
because they know of no satisfactory substitute; and really it is
not easy to compete with the Church's rite, which in its way is
very fine and was still finer before the last Elizabethan revision.
Speechifying at such a moment is not always attractive, or
possible, and I agree with an old seventeenth century parson among
my ancestors who forbade any Funeral Sermon at his death and gave
excellent reasons against the practice. It certainly seems time
that suggestions were put forward."</p>

<p>The next is dated August 15th:</p>

<p class="quote">"I am pleased to have your letter. There is
another on my table which I have been meaning to thank you for.
Just now, however, I am spending a few days with my sisters and
will therefore keep to the main point in your last."</p>

<p>It seems to have been an anthropological point connected with
left-handedness, and I conclude the passage about it:</p>

<p class="quote">"The literature is enormous and I have a quantity
of cuttings and references; I could look up any special point if
you liked. I regard myself as naturally lefthanded though
right-handed by education. I was a lefthanded bowler at cricket as
a boy and cannot throw a stone with my right hand. I regard a
certain muscular inaptitude in my case as perhaps due to the
conflict between nature and education in this matter...I am sorry
to hear there is little chance of seeing you in London this year. I
had a wretched winter with depressed health and strength and no
inspiration for work. And I very much miss the winter in Cornwall
though I feel quite unable to go down now; I have been arranging to
transfer the remainder of lease of the Carbis Cottage (which we had
greatly improved), but so far this has only led to a most worrying
muddle. With the warm weather my health, spirits, and power of work
considerably revived, and I am now getting along as well as I can
hope to, though finding life rather lonely. I work steadily at my
psychology of European peoples and write occasional articles for
the <i>New Statesman.</i> Glad to hear that you have satisfactory
news of your son's progress."</p>

<p>It was natural that my first feeling should be that with her my
life had ended. In a sense, indeed, that was true. She was an
integral part of my life during its period of most intense
activity, the long period, that is to say, devoted to the
elaboration and publication of the work which I have always
regarded as my chief task in life. I had my own world of dreams and
should have had even if we had never met. But my most intimate
points of contact with the outer world were mainly in her, through
her, or, at the least, with her close against my side and sensitive
to every movement, so that at first it seemed that she had now
entered my dream world and that the real world had receded.</p>

<p>Grief is one of the greatest mysteries of life. In losing a
beloved person one is plunged into sorrow. Yet at the same time one
is raised above all doubts and fears and anxieties into a sphere of
joy which nothing can henceforth touch. While the loved one lived
there is always doubt whether the love will last; there is always
fear of giving or receiving hurt; there is always apprehension of
harm to the being who is so dear. Now one is raised for ever above
all doubt and fear and anxiety. One enters the heaven of complete
and eternal possession which nothing can henceforth touch. To think
of the loved one is now of all pleasures the greatest. What one
truly loves is veritably one's own soul, and to lose one's soul, as
religion makes clear, is to gain it, for love is, in a certain
sense, religion. All the ardours of religious love&mdash;even its
saints and its relics and its shrines and its Holy Places&mdash;are
but the transformations of the simple facts of natural love.</p>

<p>We are bidden not to build ourselves a melancholy prison in old
age and shut ourselves up with our memories. I have built no
melancholy prison but rather a Place of Joy. Its windows and its
doors open on to the streets of to-day where crowds of living
figures move, and those figures are scarcely less living to me than
the lovely dream figures within. To-day, more than ten years since
she died, I have more friends, dearer and more intimate friends,
than I have ever had in my life before, and they bring me as sweet
a devotion, as unmixed a joy, as have ever been brought to me, or
perhaps&mdash;I somehow imagine&mdash;to any man. So that I can
truly say that, while I have lived more deeply in earlier days, I
have never at any time lived so happily. I should have been false
to all that she thought meet if, when she was gone, I had abandoned
myself to melancholy or refused to accept all that life might yet
have to give me. Some of my dearest friends to-day are women who
knew her and still think of her with tenderness and admiration, and
that is a bond which I always remember and which makes them the
dearer to me. One of them, whom I count the dearest, who gives me
the name of "Faun" and who inspired my essay on "The Play Function
of Sex," wrote to me two years after Edith's death, in French, of
"the fauns, with flutes to their lips, who play behind the bushes,
and conquer so easily, Havelock, because all the wisdom and all the
light of the world is theirs;" and now many years later, I know she
would still say the same. For to "play" has become more natural to
me than it ever was before, now that the work of life is over, and
its anxieties done with. But the people who come to see me and who
tell afterwards how "gay" I was, how "cordial," do not know that
inner life from which those qualities spring, the fount of joy, so
often touched with melancholy, the presence of influences out of
the past.</p>

<p>And when I speak of "play" in connection with Françoise I must
make clear&mdash;especially now (in 1939) that I write more than
twenty years since our relationship began&mdash;that the "play" has
in course of years sometimes merged in phases so serious that they
might seem tragic. The pure "play" belonged to the earlier years,
more conspicuously during periods of summer holiday, such as her
profession at that time as a teacher made possible, in various
parts of France, at St. Cloud (in the house of my old friend
Marguerite Tracy), on the summer Riviera (only beginning to be
sought, and I had always kept aloof from the winter Riviera), the
Pyrénées, the only mountains I love, and notably Touraine, a stay
which later remained in our memories as a sort of honeymoon.</p>

<p>During the ten years and more after Edith's death the Brixton
flat remained my headquarters, with an ever increasing store of
books and papers, but I would take a charming little cottage at
Frieth in Buckinghamshire for the six summer months, living alone
and delighting to receive for beautiful and intimate visits my more
special friends, while in winter I would go for three months to
Cadgwith in Cornwall or somewhere on the south coast. But at last
Brixton seemed in various ways to have become impossible, and at
the same time Françoise found too severe the strain of teaching, so
we in a large measure combined our domestic lives, partly in a
house at Herne Hill and partly in a country house with large garden
at Wivelsfield Green in Sussex, and she gave me some aid with
secretarial work and domestic organisation, also undertaking work
as a translator, while our relationship became closer and more
complex, all the more so through illnesses of hers and later of
mine, when she was my most devoted and capable nurse.</p>

<p>Finally, after some ten years of occupation it seemed necessary
to give up also these two houses. I was too ill to go in search of
another. Françoise went on my behalf. Finding nothing suitable in
the neighbourhood, she went, to my great satisfaction, to hunt in
Suffolk, and here speedily found, and at once fixed on, a little
house with two acres of ground which she considered charming and
exactly suitable. I have confirmed her judgment from the first. The
whole place comes nearer to my ideal&mdash;a modest ideal no
doubt&mdash;than any place I have ever lived in. Apart from its
special attributes Suffolk is more attractive and interesting to me
than any other county in England, its climate seems to suit me
better, and it was the home of most of my ancestors on both sides
during at least several centuries. It is an additional pleasure
that Françoise has come to love it almost as much as I do. I had
never ventured to expect that I should spend my last declining days
in Suffolk, and as I lie in bed and gaze through the window at a
prospect of which I never grow tired I am well pleased to think it
may be the last to greet my dying eyes. By a curious chance I
happen here to be in the parish of Washbrook, of which for a short
time in the middle of the seventeenth century my ancestor George
Peppen was the vicar, and the first time I was able to take a
little walk I went to his charming old church and stood in his
pulpit.</p>

<p>I no longer, it will be seen, enter into the details of my
intimate life. It is still too near and too closely associated with
those still living. It would be possible to tell of many beautiful
experiences with various beloved friends of fine personality during
these past twenty years, and if I do not write at length of the one
who during that period has been nearest and dearest of all, that is
not because I would fail to appreciate her wonderful and complex
character, or even fail to observe het various points of
resemblance to Edith, for whom she had genuine admiration, even
physical points, and it was a school-fellow friend of Edith's who
remarked that Françoise had the same hands. I have grown so close
to her that the thought of possibly surviving her, since her health
is not always strong, has become intolerable to me.</p>

<p>Nor will I enter into details of my external and literary life,
which during these years has pursued an easy and successful course,
though with a more random freedom since the main tasks of life are
over. It also proved&mdash;with no deliberate seeking on my
part&mdash;much more financially profitable. At one time, through
my American publishing friend Mr. Doran, I was invited to write a
short weekly article on almost (though not quite) any subject I
pleased for the Hearst journals; the proposal hardly seemed
sympathetic and at first I refused. But eventually on
reconsideration I agreed, and had no cause to regret doing so. One
morning's work was frequently all required, and at one time, aided
by a favourable exchange, it brought me in £30 a week. Then, with
but slight revision, I was able to make of the articles two widely
appreciated volumes, <i>My Confessional</i> and <i>Questions of
To-day.</i> Much more important was <i>The Dance of Life,</i>
published in 1923. This book, planned a long time before actual
publication, was mainly elaborated from essays written during the
ten preceding years, and, without being deliberately so intended, I
had in mind that, more nearly than any other book of mine, it would
approach to being a statement of my philosophical outlook on life.
It hardly seemed to me likely to find a large public. As regards
England I was quite right, for here its sale has been quite small
from the first, whatever the opinions held by good judges. But in
America, to my surprise, the book met with a very different
reception from readers of all classes. It became a recognised "best
seller," a unique experience for any book of mine. For one
half-year the royalty that reached me amounted to £1,000. The sale,
moreover, was well sustained and continued even when the book was
issued in cheap editions. A much larger and more complex work, much
more characteristic of the author, no doubt, in most eyes, appeared
in 1927, a supplementary volume (that is to say Vol. VII) of the
Sex <i>Studies.</i> I regard it as scarcely, if at all, less
important than most of the original volumes, though some of its
contents were of much narrower scope; I could not have produced it
earlier, since some of the subjects discussed I had only slowly
learnt to grasp while others had only recently come to the front.
One book finally remains to mention: <i>From Rousseau to
Proust.</i> Published in 1935, it will probably be my last book of
any consequence. It brings together nearly everything of any
interest which I have written on the literature of France, the
literature to which, throughout life, I have given more attention
than to any other. It is not of course intended to present any
continuous development. Nor is the large space devoted to Rousseau
meant to suggest any discipleship on my part. It simply means that
during the past forty years I have come to regard Rousseau not only
as a most complex and interesting personality, but the most
important and influential force to appear in our western world
since Jesus.</p>

<p>I do not discuss in detail these latest twenty years of my life;
they are not only too near, they are less closely related to the
central facts of my life than the happenings of earlier years. But
there is a reason why I may still, as I look back, finally say
something about the deep and instructive lessons I learnt in that
earlier life through my intimate association with Edith. It has
always been a pleasure to me to recall, as it was also to her, how,
years after our marriage, when we were travelling down to Cornwall
together, two strangers in the carriage also going down to St.
Ives, inquired of friends, as we afterwards learnt, who we were.
The Havelock Ellises, they were told. "Oh, no!" was the rejoinder,
"they could not have been married, they were so interested in each
other!" And the interest did not exclude, it was even bound up
with, an acute interest on both sides in other people.</p>

<p>What from the eye of strangers, who saw only the surface, was
"interest," was for me what I can describe as "passion." I have
shown how the bond of sex in the narrow sense, which was never very
strong on either side, passed out of our lives at an early stage,
and therewith, according to accepted conventional notions, passion
should have passed away. But it was not so, it was the contrary.
During all the quarter of a century of our married life I
constantly noticed, amid my various practical and emotional
activities, how my love was ever growing deeper and more
comprehensive, a spiritual love, if you will, yet also in the large
sense a bodily love, for I cannot experience, or even conceive, any
true love of the soul which is not also a love of the body. And
that it was so also with her, even though it was her instinct, as
it was also mine, to conceal the depths of feeling, I can have no
doubt. It is not only my own assumed knowledge; it was the
conviction, spontaneously given to me, of those who knew her. On
her first voyage to America in 1914 she formed a friendship with a
woman passenger who, as her swift instinct speedily divined, was
secretly engaged to the captain and later married him. "She always
talked of you," this friend wrote to me after her death, "with such
pride and such affection, as though the first freshness of married
life had never become dulled. Perhaps you realise how much she
idolised and idealised you, perhaps not." And whether I fully
realised I can never myself know. But I know something of all that
was expressed in the cry from the hospital at Hayle: "Havelock!
Havelock!" of which after many years the echo still rings in my
ears. "There are no voices that are not soon mute; there is no name
with whatever emphasis of passionate love repeated, of which the
echo is not faint at last." I know it. The beautiful voice was soon
to be mute. But the emphasis of passionate love in that name
repeated in the distance still leaves an echo, only to die when I
am dead. That constitutes the great discovery in love that I have
made. Passion transcends sex. I shall never belittle the great
roots of sex in life. I know I could not love any man as I have
loved this woman. But I have discovered that the sexual impulse of
physical attraction may pass away and give place to a passion that
is stronger than it. That is a discovery with a significance for
life and for the institution of marriage which has not yet been
measured. And I smile when I see the ephemeral creatures of a day
sneering at love. We who are not the creatures of a day, who live
greatly, and do the work of the world, we are moved by love so
that, rather than belittle love, we would even see a sense in the
final extravagance of Dante, and end, as he ends, on the
omnipotence of love, "L'amor the move it sole e l'altre
stelle."</p>

<p>I have always instinctively avoided superlatives in the language
of love for I know too well how common they are and how evanescent.
I have never in my life, that I can recall, addressed anyone as
"Dearest," however justifiably I might have done so; I have always
felt we cannot rely on our feelings, and we cannot know whether
what we feel to-day we shall always feel.</p>

<p>To an outsider who contemplates the life we led it may seem at
times an unnatural, uncomfortable, defective, and abnormal life
compared to that of all the married couples who, to outward view,
lead so placid an existence of smooth routine. Yet when one is
privileged to see beneath the surface of these lives one realises
that they are for a large part dead, with boredom gnawing at the
core, unreal, paralysed, corrupt, selfish, fruitless. How few must
the exceptions be! We at least were alive. It can rarely indeed
have happened before that a person of the same vibratory emotional
sensitiveness has been mated with a person of the same poignantly
acute and manifoldly radiating energies. If we missed the placidity
of inertia we gained a greater measure than is given to most of
that joy and pain which are the essence of life and we were
spending our strength for what seemed to each of us the greatest
causes in the world:</p>

<p class="poem">"to enrich<br>
The whole world with the sense of love and witch<br>
The heart out of things evil."</p>

<p>Is it not enough?</p>

<p>Browning addressed the author of these words after her death as
"half angel and half bird." Deeply as Edith in early life entered
into the spirit of Elizabeth Browning, especially in <i>Aurora
Leigh,</i> I would never so address her. I would sooner put it: "O
Lyric Love, half devil and half child." For she was love, generous
and tender and passionate, and she was lyric aspiration, and she
was half-devil, mischievous, merry, sometimes instinctively cruel.
"Much of the angel and something of Billingsgate," our friend Henry
Bishop, the distinguished artist, once told her after an eloquent
outburst. "Devilkin," one of her friends affectionately nicknamed
her, and she was more than half child, sensitive, proud, alive to
the smallest joys and the smallest pains, poignant and
pathetic.</p>

<p>To the pathos of her I am never quite reconciled. I am
reconciled to her death for I know that she herself was ready to
welcome it. I am reconciled to live without her physical presence,
for I could do that even while she was alive, and her spiritual
presence is nearer than it ever was. But I am never reconciled to
the pathos of this little woman with the temperament of genius,
born before her time into a hostile world, an everlasting child, so
eager and so sensitive and so trustful (for her acquired shrewdness
and suspicion was but a reaction to her trust), wounded on every
hand, tortured by the very make of her nature, and herself a
torturer, yet to the end an absolute and adorable child&mdash;that
I have never been reconciled to. I hold perpetual dialogue with
myself. I repeat all the wise reasons why I should be at peace as
she is at peace. Yet it never ceases to wring my heart.</p>

<p>It is in the inconsistencies of her temperament that I find the
reason for the seeming inconsistence in my own feelings about her
during the period immediately following her death. I tried to
escape from the thoughts of her, often so sad, that streamed in on
me from within and from without and absorbed myself in work. Yet
again and again it happened, after I had been in society and no
thought of her had had room to intrude, that when I came away, at
once, by no volition of my own or any suggestion from without, my
scattered thoughts are gathered up together in a sweet nest of
refuge with her. None the less, with all the practical motives
which I had to go to Carbis to occupy the cottage&mdash;which,
moreover she had often told me it would be to my interest to keep
on in case of her death&mdash;or to dispose of the lease and
furniture satisfactorily, the associations that clung round it were
so poignant that I never even considered all the advantages of
going, but felt as my grandfather Wheatley had felt when on his
wife's death he had given away all that belonged to her.</p>

<p>For I can only repeat that she is still ever with me, and when,
as at this moment, I recline on the lawn of my remote cottage
garden, and the warm sunshine pours down on me, and I hear the
birds and watch the apples swelling and bending from the laden
branches, in this deep peace such as she loved, she lives in my
spirit and by my side, she might be the butterfly that at this
instant hovers close to my face. I am in eternity and can afford to
smile at the simple souls who hope at some remote period after
death to be able to recognise a sleek white-robed angel in
heaven.</p>

<p>My love is a perpetual revelation to me, for it is so contrary
to all I have heard of the transitory nature of love. My
intellectual self looks on with an amused surprise while my real
self throbs swiftly to any casual contact with the things she once
touched, when I kiss her picture as I go to bed, when I cherish
tenderly the things she herself had cherished. It is a perpetual
revelation that after I had lived with her tempestuously for a
quarter of a century, in pain as well as in joy&mdash;that more
than ten years after she is dead love should retain its fresh
original sensitiveness.</p>

<p>It may be true that, as Bertrand Russell has said (in <i>A Free
Man's Worship)</i>, the Past has a "magical power," but, as he
adds, that power is not due to illusion: "What was petty and
transitory has faded away, the things that were beautiful and
eternal shine out of it like stars in the night; its beauty, to a
soul which has conquered Fate, is the key of religion." If I now
see less of what was "petty and transitory," I am the better able
to see the rest, even though I never at any time failed to see
it.</p>

<p>Intensely woman as she was in many ways, she had the loyalty,
the sense of honour, the straightforwardness of a man, and indeed
in a higher degree than all but the rarest men. Impulsive as she
was, she had none of the incalculable abandonments, and shrewd as
she could sometimes be, none of the incalculable reserves which may
be observed in the women who are all women, who may be adorable but
scarcely such as one can ever lean on with all one's weight. Yet
while her deep instincts were so stable, on the surface she was
restless, vivacious, fond of novelty, changeable, almost
capricious, even in her affections, in a way that was not the
fashion of my temperament, and, for her, mere habit was never, as
for so many, itself a tremendous force. So that when I often look
back now I may sometimes feel like one who has been long tossed and
buffeted amid the waves and at last thrown on to the shore,
shipwrecked and naked, but able at length to rest on the firm
ground,</p>

<p class="poem">"Liete, no, ma secura<br>
Dall' antica dolor."</p>

<p>So at least I sometimes felt in the first year or two of my life
alone, before the memory of old anxieties was swallowed up in a
serene possession of its joy.</p>

<p>My life of a quarter of a century at Carbis is enshrined in
memory as a dream of loveliness. I know that it was not so at any
moment while I was living it. I know that the past tends to</p>

<p class="poem">"orb into the perfect star<br>
We saw not when we moved therein."</p>

<p>I know that some of the most anguished moments of my life have
been spent there, for these too come back to me vividly, so vividly
that I have not even the strength to tell of them. But I know also
that of all the places I have ever lived in anywhere in the world
there is none that holds for me so many and so various and so
magical visions of loveliness. I know also that nowhere have I
carried out my own life-work so happily and so fruitfully, under
the open-air conditions that suit me best, as in Carbis Bay. And in
all the world there is no place so filled by manifold joyous
activities of life, intimately mixed with the deepest experiences,
of the woman who shared by my side the same glad receptivity to its
loveliness and all whose pains and sorrows my heart partook of. It
was her bright presence that first drew me to that spot and it was
with her in my care that I left it for ever a quarter of a century
later. She is for me the living spirit that fills all Carbis Bay. I
cannot imagine it without her; I could not revisit it, since she
can never return.</p>

<p>I know well the defects of the woman I loved. I do not idealise
her or experience any illusions. I remember nothing so poignantly
as the sufferings I have endured, unless it is those I have, even
innocently, inflicted. There can rarely have been anyone who has
known much better or more variously than I have the beauty of the
world, and absorbed more eagerly the beauty of Nature, of Art, of
human character and impulse. The memory of the torture remains. I
could almost echo the words of Ninon de Lenclos: "If I had known
what my life was to be I would have killed myself." I see life
whole, coldly, nakedly, all round, and though I am glad it is over,
though I would not live it again, yet now that I seem to view it
whole I view it with joy, even with ecstasy.</p>

<hr>

<p>Many years later I take up my pen anew. It is now many years
since Edith died, and I have myself lately passed my eightieth
birthday, which has been greeted with what I suppose I may regard
as a final tribute to the position I have reached in the world.</p>

<p>The tale of my life&mdash;in the sense I set forth, at forty
years of age, to tell it&mdash;is ended. As I now look back, it
seems a simple tale, yet full of mystery and wonder. The outcome
has proved so immeasurably larger than the initial promise, as
others saw it and as I myself saw it. A shy, nervous, not very
robust child, who looked out on the unfamiliar world with the eyes
of a stranger, whose first teacher asked his indignant mother if he
was "quite right in his head," throughout his school life almost
insignificant, a dreamer, without the smallest impulse to earn his
living in any of the recognised vocations, without any kind of
worldly ambition, an ineffective and backward lover, however
devoted, unfit for social life, still more unfit to carry out any
function in the public eye, and, while never idle, only able with
difficulty to support himself in comfort until the threshold of old
age, and with the continual dread of spending his last years in
destitution&mdash;that is one side of my life. But then there is
another side to this man's life. The perfectly right places opened
out before him, and these happenings have continued, as
miraculously as ever, during all the years that have passed since
the term I have placed to this story. And the weaknesses and
defects were overcome, not by any effort of masculine protest to
create artificially what was not there, but by accepting the facts
of constitution and temperament as they come from Nature and making
of them an act by which failure could be woven into success. So
that, as I look back, I seem to see one who was, instinctively and
unconsciously, an artist in living, one who used, honestly and
courageously, the material of such mixed quality that was put into
his hands at the outset and slowly wrought the work that Nature and
his own nature&mdash;they seemed to him one&mdash;had set him to
do, together with his own life, into one large and harmonious
whole, so that all he lived he wrote and all that he wrote he
lived. That&mdash;though it seems perfectly simple and natural to
me to be just myself and never to expect any consequent benefit to
accrue to me&mdash;I can now see, is something that is extremely
rare. It helps me to understand the love and reverence in which I
am held by so many men and women, some of whom I know, others whom
I have never seen and who are scattered all over the world. It has
seemed strange and wonderful to me; it had never entered into my
wildest dreams of life; indeed I have never had dreams of life in
which I myself played any prominent part. I could not understand
why what was so simple and natural and inevitable to me should mean
much to others. But perhaps it is only just that the world which
has brought so many miracles into my life should in the end be
rewarded by finding in me a miracle.</p>

<p>I say that my life is over, yet the way that I say it may
suggest that in some respects I am still much alive. I have never
been so free from care as I am now since my seventieth year; I have
never been so happy as to-day when I have by my side a tender
companion whose devotion and sympathy enfold me in radiance, so
that sometimes I am almost disposed to begin the narrative of a
second and later life. I have never had so many lovely and loving
friends. I have never had so much power of enjoyment or so much to
enjoy&mdash;now that with the coming of years I am a little better
able to reverence the things on which I may not close my hands. I
have even in some degree lost the early sense of being a stranger
in the world, a lost child who had strayed from a home he could
only fondly recall. The world I was born into was alive, full of
things that were repellent to me, of ways of hying that I thought
disgusting, of ideas and traditions that denied everything that I
instinctively thought fitting or beautiful. In the world of
to-day&mdash;even though fascinating things have departed&mdash;the
things that it was my nature to crave and that I thought it almost
Utopian to demand have in large measure been realised. The vulgar
crowd has lost much of its brutal selfishness, its sordid ugliness;
a new graciousness has become interfused with life, a faint
perception that Hying is an art. I cannot see now a girl walking
along the street with her free air, her unsvcrthed limbs, her gay
and scanty raiment, without being conscious of a thrill of joy in
the presence of a symbol of life that in my youth was unknown. I
can to-day feel in London, as in earlier days I scarcely could even
in Paris, that I am among people who are growing to be gracious and
human.</p>

<p>I am glad to be alive, even though, when the moment comes, I
shall go to meet Death as eagerly as a young man meets his
bride.</p>

<p>But even these words are not, as I supposed, the end. It is only
now (May, 1939) that I have really entered the final phase. Those
eleven years, even with troubles, have held many events and moments
of quiet happiness. And by far the most important event has been
the last when my health was already breaking down, and I had to
give up both my houses at Herne Hill and at Wivelsfield Green in
Sussex. I was not strong enough to enter on the search for a new
home. This was undertaken by my beloved Françoise who has ever
remained far more than merely my devoted nurse and capable domestic
organiser. She attained a success far beyond what I could have
hoped or even imagined. Suffolk has always been my favourite
county; it is for me the most interesting, and it suits my health
better, and I have had many delightful excursions into various
regions of it. But the idea of spending my last days in Suffolk
scarcely even developed into a dream. Françoise discovered and
immediately fixed on a perfect home for me. It is by far the best
home I ever possessed anywhere, surrounded by all my inherited and
acquired treasures, and in the midst of a beautiful garden which
all admire. There is the amusing addition that in the middle of the
seventeenth century my ancestor George Peppen was the Vicar of
Washbrook, as the parish then was. To save me all trouble Françoise
made me stay in Felixstowe while she conducted the removals and set
up the new house, which I entered in June, 1938. Now, however much
of an invalid, I can He in bed and gaze contentedly on a scene of
charming peace.</p>

<p>There is still more I would like to write, but I have not the
strength and it no longer matters to me.</p>
