<h2><i>STINGING NETTLES</i></h2>

<h3><i>A Novel</i></h3>

<p><i>"She was really quite happy in the palace, but the fact that
she could not get out, gave it, she thought, the impression of a
prison, and she took to gazing out of the window, and
sighing.</i></p>

<p><i>"A cluster of green-and-white flowers beneath her window,
particularly excited her longing, and when she finally made her
escape, the first thing she did was to pluck them eagerly. Alas!
they were stinging nettles, and hurt her so cruelly, that she
wanted to run home again. But the door was shut, and she could by
no means get it open."</i></p>

<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>Chapter One</h2>

<p class="cpb">&sect; I</p>

<p>LUCIE sat in the depths of the big pale-green brocade couch that
filled one corner of the dressing-room, and watched the other two
women changing their clothes.</p>

<p>She shared their depression and felt alien and even uneasy amid
the cold mechanical splendours of the great hotel; they were none
of them used to this atmosphere of luxury and extravagance; not one
of them had ever worn any but "ready-made" evening gowns, and,
though Luck herself was in orthodox attire, she shared the grim
humiliation of Sophie and Aurora, who had to change from
cotton-backed satin and cheap chiffon into tweeds and "useful"
coats.</p>

<p>It was a cold February and there was a long journey before both
of them, one by train, the other by tram; in each case a dark
stretch of sordid travelling.</p>

<p>She felt very keenly for Sophie, who was very vain and had hoped
a great deal from this evening.</p>

<p>And nothing had come of it.</p>

<p>Poor Sophie, she stood for one bitter moment in her Japsilk
petticoat, gazing at herself in the superb pier-glass; she was, in
a fleeting sort of way, lovely to look at, but she was thinking,
and Lucie was thinking, that loveliness didn't seem to
matter&mdash;much.</p>

<p>Sophie would have liked to stare longer at herself in the
mirror, to pose and turn and change the attitude of her plump,
rounded limbs; the tiny glass at home would seem more inadequate
than ever now; but the attendant, exquisite, aloof, was holding out
skirt and jumper, stockings and shoes.</p>

<p>Lucie, in her useless sympathy, felt that their garments looked
not alone shabby but dirty compared to the white polished enamel
paint, the gleaming mirrors, the sea-coloured hangings, the
dressing-table strewn with gold articles.</p>

<p>She glanced, her brow wrinkled and her lips caught in, at
Aurora; that good-natured girl was already in her walking-dress and
dragging an out-of-date travelling hat over the hair she had taken
such pains to arrange a few hours previously.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bearish, her mother, sat, cross and tired, against the
wall, wrapping the pink slippers in paper and putting them in a
cloth workbag she had brought for the purpose.</p>

<p>Lucie's glance went from her peevish figure, to the rows of
sable and brocade coats hanging round the walls, to the immaculate
silhouette of the maid giving disdainful attention to Sophie, and
then flickered to the mirror, where she could see her own tall,
pale, fair, tired reflection.</p>

<p>"I wish we had not come," she thought.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bearish folded up the wisp of a pink satin frock and put it
in the bag with the narrow ill-cut slippers.</p>

<p>"You'll stain the stockings, putting the black shoes over them,"
she warned her daughter; her voice was very pleasing and cultured;
though her appearance was, for this place, quite blatantly shabby,
she seemed more at her ease than the younger women; she was by
birth an aristocrat, her real name was Hesselquist and she was the
divorced wife of a Swedish diplomat.</p>

<p>Lucie rose; she wanted very much to get away, back into their
usual surroundings, where they could "talk it over". She glanced
furtively at Sophie, who was ready now, and looked both unimportant
and untidy, with her finery in a parcel under her arm.</p>

<p>Lucie felt unreasonably impatient; it wasn't worth doing it,
like this. She put a half-crown she could ill afford on the end of
the dressing-table, for the sake of the moral fillip given by the
maid's added respect, despising herself for the feeble
subterfuge.</p>

<p>"My lip-stick has melted and messed my bag up," complained
Aurora, showing a handkerchief and fingers that appeared
blood&mdash;stained: her Northern breed showed in her heaviness,
her placid exterior.</p>

<p>"You don't need to put any more on now," replied Mrs. Bearish
sharply. "Do be quick, or we shall miss the train."</p>

<p>Sophie was dangerously silent: Lucie knew she was passionately
sullen and dreaded her coming mood.</p>

<p>"Let us go," said Lucie, her nerves on edge to see Mrs. Bearish
still fidgeting with her parcels, dropping them, repacking them and
searching to see if she had forgotten anything, while Aurora tried
to get the smear off her fingers and to rescue the remains of the
lip-stick, looking impassive and heavy in her dark worn clothes
against the artificial luxury of the hotel room.</p>

<p>Lucie drew Sophie towards the door.</p>

<p>"Come home with me," she said. "We will take a taxi and have a
good talk&mdash;it is so late&mdash;Aunt Lydia said you were to
come back with me if you wanted to."</p>

<p>"Oh, mother won't bother," said the younger cousin, shortly.</p>

<p>"Will you come?"</p>

<p>"Suppose I may as well," was the vague and careless answer.</p>

<p>Lucie looked sadly at the pretty face, disfigured by
disappointment and temper; her own mood gave a sharp edge to her
critical faculties, always too alert for her own comfort.</p>

<p>Sophie, whose chief asset was her looks,&mdash;was Sophie "going
off"? Didn't her nose look heavy and her lips thin, and weren't her
eyes weary behind the dark stuff she was beginning to put on her
lashes? The elder woman's mind was touched with a dreary
terror&mdash;Sophie was twenty-eight, still unmarried&mdash;was it
always going to be like this?</p>

<p>Mrs. Bearish was ready at last. Lucie gathered her cloak round
her with a sensation of relief in any sort of action; her thoughts
hovered uneasily round one point; she looked covertly at her own
image in the mirror&mdash;saw herself at an uncommon angle, almost
in profile; these great glasses, so cunningly arranged, were
disconcerting; she saw no attractiveness in her frail fairness. She
was graceful, but her clothes weren't right; still, she surveyed
herself indifferently; she was older than Sophie, married and "done
for"; it did not matter what she looked like; with Sophie now it
was different.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; II</p>

<p>As she moved to open the door, two women came in, almost
throwing it back in her face. They carried perfume with them,
personal, heavy.</p>

<p>They were large, and talked loudly; without taking the slightest
notice of anyone, they swung to the dressing-table. The maid,
instantly obsequious, waited on them silently. Lucie had seen them
dancing voluptuously in the hotel ballroom; she hated them swiftly
and intently, hated their opulent clothes, their rich
appointments&mdash;most of all hated their odious self-assurance;
their triumphant flaunting of sex.</p>

<p>One of them, seated at the table, gazed into the glass with an
anxious scrutiny that was cruel in its eagerness, and began very
skilfully to make up her face, using a hare's-fud; when she opened
her mouth, her teeth showed yellow between the carmined lips.</p>

<p>She was hard-featured, middle-aged, yet completely at her ease
and dominant. The other, laughing and smoking together
continuously, ordered the maid from one service to another, while
she powdered her back with a puff that had a long scarlet handle.
The original texture of her skin was lost, and creams, massage and
powder had destroyed any likeness to a human body, save when the
powerful muscles moved as she twisted her shoulders.</p>

<p>Lucie's party, entirely ignored, slipped out of the room, almost
shamefacedly, through the gilt doors.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; III</p>

<p>The after-dinner dance given nightly to "guests" was over, and
the corridors, resplendent in mirrors, gilt furniture, palms, and
cream silk upholstery, were emptying.</p>

<p>A few men, dull, yet watchful, stood about; their glances
travelled idly to the little group of women in walking costume,
then, still impassive, flickered away; Lucie was glad when the
street entrance was reached.</p>

<p>Her host stood by the fourfold plate glass door, drawing on a
pair of unworn white gloves; he was talking to the only other man
who had been at the incongruous dinner, a young Indian, spectacled
and serious, whose greenish, chinless face was blank of all
expression.</p>

<p>"Goodbye, and thank you so much, Mr. Sackett," said Mrs. Bearish
wanly; the other dispirited women took leave of him with equal
brevity. Sophie spoke to him with a rude shortness.</p>

<p>Mr. Sackett, a middle-aged American, plain and dull, too well
dressed, smiled on them with gentle gravity, and they passed
through the swing doors into the street.</p>

<p>The air blew keen through the arcades of the hotel; rain slashed
the outer side of the pillars blanched by the electric light;
London stretched before them, dark, wet and silent.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bearish looked back to see if the host was following to
offer any courtesies. No one appeared save the opulent porter,
eyeing them with gloomy apathy.</p>

<p>An air of profound disappointment was over all of them, so
generally felt that no one needed to voice it.</p>

<p>"I have such a headache," said Mrs. Bearish; "and we really
shall lose that train, Aurora."</p>

<p>"There is time enough, mother," said the girl. A group of men
were leaving the hotel, and her gaze ran over them as she spoke.
"We can even walk&mdash;and must&mdash;there is no chance of a 'bus
on a wet night."</p>

<p>Mrs. Bearish accepted this; never, under any circumstances, did
they take cabs.</p>

<p>They said goodbye to the other two, and turned away down the
wet, dark length of Piccadilly.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; IV</p>

<p>There was a magnificent shop at the corner of the arcade where
pictures and carvings were sold. The glooming light showed a gilt
and blue statue of the Madonna with a lovely baby in her arms.</p>

<p>Lucie thought how warm and sweet and comfortable she looked,
what a fair ideal this was&mdash;worshipped, adorned, adored
maternity.</p>

<p>In the doorway of the shop crouched a filthy woman in dreadful
tatters; she was also a mother; a diseased child clutched at her
greasy jacket.</p>

<p>Seeing the two women, she staggered up and passed on, muttering.
Lucie then saw that she carried a second child, not yet born.</p>

<p>Now behind the expensive plate glass among the charming,
luxurious objects made to divert wealthy leisure, the clean pretty
Madonna smiled.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; V</p>

<p>As Lucie raised her hand to a cab that was sauntering past in
the bleached light of the hotel electricity, she saw Sophie
glancing back furtively, and felt both sorry and
impatient&mdash;after such a dreadful evening, did she still think
that Peter Sackett was interested in her?&mdash;could she still be
interested in him?</p>

<p>She was relieved when she had the girl beside her in the stuffy
darkness of the taxi, and they were hurrying along the glistening
length of Piccadilly, the shining, wide, wet road, towards the
furnished flat in Chelsea which was all she had of home.</p>

<p>Then, as she expected, Sophie Falconer broke out:</p>

<p>"Why did he ask us? Wasn't it awful? Dinner in the
grill-room&mdash;and he yawned! Why didn't he ask me to dance? He
was bored. And he brought no other men."</p>

<p>"I don't think he knows how to do things," said Lucie. "I
shouldn't bother about him," she added feebly.</p>

<p>Sophie sat in fierce silence; the street lights, as they flicked
past, showed her face and throat and hands white with a pearly
whiteness against her dark clothes. She looked quite lovely in the
blotted light and shadow so swiftly moving, save for the blight of
envy and bitterness that distorted her features; sheer pity for her
plight made Lucie's heart contract.</p>

<p>"You don't like him, so don't bother about him, Sophie," she
said again. "I suppose he just asked us all out of a little sense
of friendliness&mdash;nothing else."</p>

<p>She could not for sheer weariness expatiate on the theme; ever
since her cousin Sophie had met Mr. Sackett, a hospital
acquaintance of war days, at a charity féte where the girl was
selling programmes, and he had at once arranged a little
dinner-party in her honour at London's most expensive hotel, she
had heard and seen nothing but excited speculations and excited
preparations for the epoch-making event.</p>

<p>They did not know much about Mr. Sackett save that he was very
rich and lived in Park Lane, but this was quite sufficient
groundwork for the most golden dreams&mdash;those poor desperate
dreams Sophie was so well used to.</p>

<p>Both Mrs. Bearish and Mrs. Falconer, experts in all varieties of
love affairs, had been certain the man would propose to Sophie,
either during or after the dinner episode; they had all been
equally sure that he would bring some wealthy compatriot who would
"do" for Aurora. Never had high hopes fallen so flat&mdash;Peter
Sackett had taken them down to the grill-room, brought as his sole
contribution, the nervous Hindu, who never opened his lips, and,
without paying the least individual attention to any of the women,
talked aridly and endlessly of himself.</p>

<p>Then he had trailed them to "watch the dancing," and had sat
beside Sophie and yawned till it was time for the desperate Mrs.
Bearish to give the signal for the martyrdom to end.</p>

<p>Lucie loathed the whole episode so intensely because it was so
typical of Sophie's life, of the life she had lived herself till
her marriage, of the lives of nearly all the girls and women in the
half-professional, halt middle-class <i>set</i> of
twentieth-century Bohemians in which she moved.</p>

<p>"Those awful women!" burst out Sophie from her dark corner. "Did
you see them? and how they were dancing? They make me sick&mdash;I
don't think we ought to have gone."</p>

<p>Lucie's honesty of nature could not allow her this solace to her
discomfiture&mdash;those women, awful to her, too, were, she knew,
most hateful because successful.</p>

<p>"Well, it is funny in a way," she said, with an effort at
cheerfulness. "I mean&mdash;all these preparations, and then such a
host! Mrs. Beamish looked so cross&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Aurora pawned her grandfather's watch to buy her frock,"
replied Sophie. "She got the dress in Sloane Street at a
sale&mdash;it's faded, really, and the lace torn. It will take her
salary for two months to get the watch back. Do you think that
funny?"</p>

<p>Something in the dry bitterness of the girl's voice broke
Lucie's control.</p>

<p>"Don't!" she exclaimed sharply. "It's indecent. I can't bear it,
all this plotting and scheming&mdash;about&mdash;men. I don't
believe, anyhow, you would have ever married that awful
American&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That is no reason why he should not give me a good time,"
replied Sophie sullenly. "Besides, I might marry him&mdash;why not?
Don't you suppose I'm sick of this sort of life?"</p>

<p>"What sort of life?" asked Lucie, as the cab jerked up against
the curb and stopped. "It is life, anyhow, and as good as the
next."</p>

<p>"I'm tired of being just respectable enough to miss all the
fun," flung out Sophie defiantly. "It isn't life&mdash;we're
outside everything that matters."</p>

<p>Lucie gave her a key.</p>

<p>"Run up; there will be some cocoa upstairs, in the thermos," she
said, as she stepped out.</p>

<p>As she paid the man, she felt the wild wet wind blow from the
river on her face and circling her body under the fight cloak; she
was glad of it, though it made her shiver.</p>

<p>Even a touch of the wind could put things into proportion for
Lucie Uden. "I must not be overwhelmed by this chaos round me," she
told herself. "Everything is over for me&mdash;but it doesn't
matter&mdash;I must remember that it doesn't matter."</p>

<p>She ran upstairs into the tiny flat, and straight into the
living room, where Sophie Falconer was turning up the gas fire.</p>

<p>A few plates and cups, cake, biscuits and a thermos stood on the
table which was imitation antique.</p>

<p>The room was quite pretty in a sort of sham way, but filmed with
London dirt. All Lucie's good taste could not make a success of a
furnished flat; she had very little money to spend on herself,
though she was the wealthy, successful member of her set and earned
several hundreds a year steadily, even during the War.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; VI</p>

<p>But there always had been a heavy drain on Lucie Uden's
earnings&mdash;first Mrs. Falconer and Sophie, her aunt who had,
somehow, brought her up from the death of her wayward mother and
the disappearance from conventional society of her impossible
father, and the cousin who had been like a sister in intimacy and
exactions, if not in sympathy or understanding. Neither Mrs.
Falconer nor Sophie made very much headway in their respective
professions of journalism and music, and they were, besides,
shiftless and extravagant; but Lucie loved her aunt, and thought
she loved Sophie, and had never ceased to "help" the girl in her
wayward and erratic career the bourne of which was devoutly
supposed to be a wealthy marriage.</p>

<p>Then there was her young Italian husband, an incompetent
engineer who had dropped out of the only work he had ever held soon
after their marriage; and the baby that had lived five months...The
husband was delicate, violent and melancholy; he had returned to
his parents in the South, to escape an English winter. Lucie was
glad of the very real excuse of her work that prevented her from
accompanying him, for the three years of her marriage had proved an
utter disillusion; she was completely, though without rancour,
estranged from the alien nature with which she had mated; she
believed that her emotional nature had died with her only child.
She was thirty and felt beyond further experience. "What I haven't
had, I've missed," she said to herself often enough, and she was
glad to live quietly in Chelsea with her work and plans for Sophie
and talks with Mrs. Falconer, and little rounds of work and
diversion in a world that hardly knew her as Madame Simonetti, but
was very friendly towards her as Lucie Uden, the quite well-known
designer of clothes, furniture, textiles and, in fact, everything
that could be covered with decoration.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; VII</p>

<p>She arranged the supper deftly and quietly, glancing now and
then at Sophie, who sat hunched up over the gas fire.</p>

<p>She had removed her hat, and her hair was untidy; there were too
many pins in it and a damaged black bow; she bit her nails and
pulled at her rather thin lips.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Bearish was very disappointed," she said gloomily.</p>

<p>Lucie poured the cocoa with a steady hand.</p>

<p>"Don't keep on about to-night," she answered, with a quick
animation in her pleasant voice. "Aurora has her office job; she is
all right, really."</p>

<p>"All right?" Sophie took up the word acidly. "Earning three
pounds a week because she knows four languages&mdash;sitting in an
office from nine to six&mdash;living in a wretched boarding house
at Surbiton?"</p>

<p>"Well, who is better of?" asked Lucie softly, handing the
cocoa.</p>

<p>"That's it&mdash;who is? There are thousands and thousands of
us&mdash;all so much alike, all wanting what we can't get&mdash;all
secretly fighting each other&mdash;" The girl was overwrought, and
her lip quivered; the cup of cocoa that to Lucie was suddenly
ridiculous, shook in her hands.</p>

<p>"Don't!" said the elder woman sharply.</p>

<p>"I know." Sophie laughed, a quivering sound very different from
the trill with which she had tried, earlier in the evening, to
charm the wooden Mr. Sackett. "It makes me sick...women...crowds
and crowds of us...hordes ... swarms&mdash;flung about all over the
place&mdash;the men sick of us&mdash;dead sick."</p>

<p>"Drink your cocoa," interrupted Lucie quickly. "You're
cold."</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; VIII</p>

<p>They were silent for a moment; Sophie was seeing the two
expensive women in the hotel, Lucie a dead child in its cradle; "as
well, perhaps," thought the bereft woman dully, "since she, too,
was a girl."</p>

<p>Two pictures she saw as she gazed at the flame of the gas
fire.</p>

<p>She saw herself going into a shop in Regent Street and buying a
baby's frock, "for a little girl, please, something rather
expensive."</p>

<p>Pride and joy thrilled in her voice&mdash;for her little
girl&mdash;for her baby. She bought a cream-coloured silk dress,
smocked; it cost nearly three pounds; it was a ridiculous
extravagance. She saw herself standing by a cot in the room of a
farmhouse in Sussex; it was dawn and the marsh beneath the window
looked like a map with the silver tracery of dykes. She had been up
all night and felt ill.</p>

<p>A dead baby was in the cot wearing the cream silk smocked frock
and kid shoes too large for the tiny stiff feet.</p>

<p>Apple blossoms lay on her pillow and an ant had crawled from it
and was crossing the pinched, distorted little face.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; IX</p>

<p>Over the chimney-piece hung the large engravings of a man and
woman, obviously portraits, in the dress of seventy or so years
ago.</p>

<p>"Why do you keep those hideous things there?" asked Sophie, as
her restless gaze fell on these pictures.</p>

<p>"I don't know. There is something stable about them," answered
Lucie vaguely from the depths of her sad dream.</p>

<p>"Ghastly! Look at the woman! What a dress! What a life!
Someone's grandmother, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Lucie quietly; "she was&mdash;someone's
grandmother."</p>

<p>"I should have hated to live in those days."</p>

<p>"Would you?" asked Lucie, with a queer look.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>Chapter Two</h2>

<p class="cpb">&sect; I</p>

<p>SOPHIE, in a mood to resent anything, was vexed by Lucie's
tone.</p>

<p>"Well, I should not have cared to have lived then," she said
pettishly; "nor would you, I should have thought. Lord, we couldn't
have lived like we do. Think of the freedom. We do do as we like,
really."</p>

<p>Lucie, huddled in one of the pretty chintz chairs, stirred her
cocoa; she was not listening to her cousin, but thinking that she
didn't like cocoa, really...any more than she liked "dressing up"
to have dinner in the grill-room of a big hotel.</p>

<p>"Think how dull it must have been," persisted Sophie.
"'Revolting woman' hadn't been heard of&mdash;there was nothing one
could do."</p>

<p>"Dull?" said Lucie. "Yes, I suppose so&mdash;but freedom can be
dull, too!"</p>

<p>"That's silly," answered Sophie. "If we are ever dull nowadays
it is because we haven't got enough freedom&mdash;"</p>

<p>Lucie rose; the room was close, with the fumes from Sophie's
careless flare of gas, yet her limbs were chilled and she had a
headache.</p>

<p>Somehow, these familiar surroundings, with her own work and
books about, seemed almost as revolting as the atmosphere of the
huge hotel; both seemed to lack stability, order, permanence: the
luxurious hotel, the cheap furnished flat, seemed symbols of a
bitter relentlessness, of the coming and going of unsatisfied,
struggling people. Lucie had a sensation of everything whirling
round her, in and out of chaos. "I've got that horrid feeling that
nothing is real," she said wistfully.</p>

<p>"Lots of people have," replied Sophie unsympathetically. "I
expect it is the War&mdash;at least, everyone says everything is
the War."</p>

<p>She picked up a cigarette-case, but did not open it; she seldom
smoked save when men were present.</p>

<p>"Let us go to bed," murmured Lucie wearily; "it is most
frightfully late. Your room is ready."</p>

<p>"I'm not sleepy a bit," replied Sophie. "And it isn't late,
really. You've got a dowdy mind, Lucie. Why shouldn't we sit up all
night? I often do."</p>

<p>Lucie thought, but did not say, that her cousin well might do as
she pleased, considering her lazy life; for herself there was work
she had to do, to get bread-and-butter for all of them and to be
able to send cheques out to the ailing husband in Italy, who was
too "proud" to live on his family.</p>

<p>She sat down again, unable to cope with Sophie, who always had
her way with her.</p>

<p>"You won't be able to work if you sit up so late," she said
feebly.</p>

<p>"Work!" cried Sophie. "Why should I have to work?"</p>

<p>"You ought to plod at the singing," said Lucie, exasperated.</p>

<p>"There's nothing in it; you simply can't get money that way. I
ought not to have to be trying&mdash;plodding spoils one's
looks."</p>

<p>This was a reference to Sophie's well-known grievance against
her father's family, who were "comfortably off" and offered her no
assistance whatever, and appeared only dubiously impressed by her
charms and gifts.</p>

<p>Lucie steered away from the subject; her depression had deepened
into a sense of foreboding, as if something queer and nasty was
going to happen to one, or perhaps both, of them.</p>

<p>"Of course you've been successful," went on Sophie. "You don't
know what it is to have to struggle without a reward."</p>

<p>Lucie was used to that, too; she moved near the window so that
she could hear the rain.</p>

<p>"Why don't you give it up and get married?" she said
desperately. "You've had plenty of chances."</p>

<p>"With penniless men," answered Sophie sharply. "Wow is that
going to help?"</p>

<p>"Well, if you can't get a Mr. Sackett&mdash;" smiled Lucie
dismally.</p>

<p>The vanity of the other woman retorted sharply:</p>

<p>"I could if I wanted to. He isn't the only one who admires
me."</p>

<p>"Why bother about the men so much, now we are free?" asked Lucie
wearily. "You said yourself there are too many girls."</p>

<p>"Freedom! What is the good of talking! Money brings the only
freedom," she added sharply.</p>

<p>Sophie looked at her, not without malice; these two women,
forced by circumstances into this intimacy, really often irritated
each other very much. Sophie's jealous disposition, soured by
continual set-backs on the lines of her desires and some very
conspicuous failures, always instantly resented any hint of
disapproval or "preaching" on Lucie's part.</p>

<p>She genuinely despised the elder woman for her marriage, which
she called, in the jargon in which she spoke and thought, "a
hopeless mess."</p>

<p>"Heard from Pio lately?" she asked in a thin artificial
voice.</p>

<p>At this mention of her husband Lucie did slightly wince. "Oh,
yes; he writes frequently," she answered bravely. "Getting
better?"</p>

<p>"Much. All right again, I think."</p>

<p>"Coming back?"</p>

<p>"No," said Lucie firmly. "He is quite happy in Sicily&mdash;he
always hated this country, really. He is helping his cousin with
some orange growing."</p>

<p>"You don't think of joining him?" Sophie's sneer was
blatant.</p>

<p>"No," answered the other woman quietly. "I've got my living to
earn over here. You know all that, Sophie."</p>

<p>The girl shrugged her shoulders in an artificial fashion.</p>

<p>"Well, you always talk as if you liked all that old-fashioned
business of cooking and serving and Darby-and-Joan&mdash;but you
don't live up to it," she said. "You are glad of this freedom,
aren't you? Being able to live like this, and no one asking
questions&mdash;"</p>

<p>Tears were in Lucie's hazel eyes and her whole body shivered
with fatigue and sadness.</p>

<p>"I took what came my way," she said quietly. "What is the use of
going over it? Everything is over for me, of course." The
simplicity of this view seemed to Sophie grotesque; she wondered if
Lucie could really be so oblivious to her own youth, charming
personality and great attractiveness.</p>

<p>As she sat there now, entirely unconscious, She looked, in her
long grace, with her pale-brown hair and delicate features, an
entrancing figure of soft, womanly allure.</p>

<p>"Do you really mean to stick to that man?" asked Sophie
sharply.</p>

<p>Lucie heard the words like an ugly clamour breaking the dreams
about her heart, but she answered at once and quite casually:</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;of course; don't be silly."</p>

<p>"Lord!" cried Sophie. "Silly! Why, it just means you're done
for&mdash;he over there and you here&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't know what you mean&mdash;we get on quite well
together."</p>

<p>"With Europe between you!"</p>

<p>Lucie rose, and drew the curtains to open the window a little
and feel the rain on her hands.</p>

<p>"I shall go out there presently. Anyhow, there is no divorce in
Italy&mdash;if that is what you mean, Sophie."</p>

<p>"You would be divorced if you could, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"No. Not for anything."</p>

<p>Sophie was exasperated.</p>

<p>"You've not been tempted."</p>

<p>Lucie tried to turn it off with a laugh.</p>

<p>"No, and I am not likely to be. I've 'settled down,' you
know&mdash;and quite off the track of that sort of thing."</p>

<p>Sophie had to wish to suppose her cousin likely to inspire
emotional adventures, so she agreed with this.</p>

<p>"I suppose not," she answered, rising. "But if you
were&mdash;could you still cling to these old-fashioned
stunts?"</p>

<p>"I hope so," said Lucie. "Yes, of course."</p>

<p>"I don't believe it&mdash;I don't believe any woman could or
would. Now, if a nice man was to make love to you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"They wouldn't. And I don't meet any," answered Lucie
incoherently. "Do come to bed. I'm half asleep. Don't keep talking
about it, you've no idea how middle-aged and past everything I
feel."</p>

<p>Sophie yawned and lounged to the door; her prettiness was
eclipsed; with her rather dull hair ruffled and her pale, tired
face and her nondescript clothes, she looked a middle-aged woman,
her bust and hips, and lines round her mouth showed her <i>age</i>
plainly.</p>

<p>"Toby Entwhistle is coming home next week," she said, with a
funny little lift of her upper lip that was like an unpleasant
smile.</p>

<p>Lucie shut the window sharply.</p>

<p>"I thought he was in Baghdad&mdash;for good," she said
carefully.</p>

<p>"He isn't. Coming home to look for the jobs that aren't here.
You'll be glad to see him."</p>

<p>"Why?" challenged Lucie, with her back to the window. "Oh, he
used to admire you a lot, didn't he?"</p>

<p>Lucie ignored this.</p>

<p>"You've heard from him?"</p>

<p>"I often do. He is always writing to me or mother. Yesterday
there was just a line to say he was coming back that's all."</p>

<p>"You saw a good deal of him during the War&mdash;when I was in
Italy?" asked Lucie, as they went out into the tiny corridor.</p>

<p>"He was about with the others," said Sophie carelessly. "We
hadn't much use for him."</p>

<p>The odious slang hurt Lucie; in silence she turned up the gas in
the slip of a bedroom which Sophie made such frequent use of; it
was an airless place, over-furnished, of course, but clean and in a
way pleasant.</p>

<p>"I shan't stay here long," said Lucie, with a sudden hint of
passion. "I must get a place of my own, some sort of a home."</p>

<p>"What is the use of a home without something to put in it?"
asked Sophie brutally, sitting on the bed and dragging off her
shoes without untying the laces. "I hope you don't mean to bury
yourself in the country," she added, with a touch of anxiety; fir
Lucie in town was very useful to her. "You'll never get on if you
leave London."</p>

<p>"Get on, get on!&mdash;Where to? What for?"</p>

<p>The words whirled foolishly in Lucie's tired head; she stared at
a cheap photogravure of "The Golden Stairs" that hung above the
fumed-oak bed; the peace and dignity of the poet's vision struck
across her mood even through this poor medium.</p>

<p>"That is all just as true as anything else, Sophie," she said
irrelevantly.</p>

<p>The girl glanced up.</p>

<p>"What? That fairy tale?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;fairy tales <i>are</i> true."</p>

<p>Sophie laughed shortly.</p>

<p>"Well, good-night."</p>

<p>"Good-night. Do try to sleep," said Lucie.</p>

<p>They kissed without affection, and Lucie returned to the little
sitting-room as Sophie, half-undressed, was idly searching the
bamboo bookshelf to see if there was one of the second-hand novels
she hadn't read.</p>

<p>Lucie closed both doors with a sense of resolution; it was good
to be alone.</p>

<p>She "tidied" the sitting-room, carried the supper things into
the kitchen in readiness for the daily woman, came back, lowered
the gas fire and sat beside it in the low chintz chair, staring at
what were to her, the most beautiful objects in the room: a gaudy
china parrot in yellow and orange that stood behind a bowl of
apples and nuts on the little sideboard.</p>

<p>She was, quite suddenly, not sleepy; a new almost feverish
vitality flooded her being; she felt almost overwhelmingly alive,
sitting alert in this little room, in the sleeping city.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; II</p>

<p>Toby Entwhistle was returning to London. He had been in the East
four years; during the War she had been in Italy and not seen him
when he renewed his acquaintance with the Falconers, who, though
they had formerly snubbed him as an utter nobody, were not
displeased to have another very personable young officer to go
about with during his leave.</p>

<p>Lucie counted up how long it was since she had seen him. Not for
long before&mdash;why, it must be eight, ten years&mdash;why, they
must have been boy and girl then.</p>

<p>There had never been any kind of a love affair&mdash;only,
somehow, they had liked each other. Then Mrs. Falconer had
disapproved of the modest youth who was so hopelessly "no good" to
any one of them&mdash;then the War, and her marriage...Queer how
distinctly she remembered him.</p>

<p>He hadn't married.</p>

<p>Lucie sighed, stirred in her chair...And now he was coming
home.</p>

<p>Home!&mdash;to what?</p>

<p>Socially he was, like herself, a mere waif and stray,
orphaned&mdash;a "nobody" struggling for existence, never master of
so much money as when on active service&mdash;nothing definitely
but a good soldier. She was curiously pleased to remember how often
she had heard that of him&mdash;she, tied to an invalid who looked
upon the War as a "nuisance" because it took all the good doctors
out of the country.</p>

<p>He used to like all the things she liked. How wonderful, to have
another chance, with this kind of man...</p>

<p>But she was bound&mdash;"done for"; everything was over for
her&mdash;quite definitely over&mdash;and of course he would not
care about her now.</p>

<p>He would be fallen upon by all these overwhelming girls and
women, flattered and caressed, f or&mdash;"a good time" and "fun."
Sophie would be glad to go about with him as long as he paid for
her; Aurora would "take him up"; though their ultimate prey were
rich husbands, these desperate huntresses were eager for any other
victims in the meanwhile; and they were but two of these "free"
girls who seemed to Lucie to be stampeding the very meaning out of
life.</p>

<p>"I am a fool to be even giving it a thought," she told herself.
"Of course I am free too; I've got the right to any love that comes
my way&mdash;but it won't come&mdash;I'm not the sort. Marriage
isn't much nowadays, at least a marriage like mine. Pio wouldn't
care what I did," she thought. "But there is nothing I want to
do&mdash;I'm done for. I feel quite old&mdash;I looked a hag
to-night."</p>

<p>A clock outside struck half-past one. Lucie walked up and down
the narrow strip of matting.</p>

<p>She recalled Sophie's words.</p>

<p>"I can do exactly as I like," she repeated, half aloud.</p>

<p>She was self-supporting; she had no one to consider; Pio, idling
in Sicily, was so completely estranged by differences of
temperament and character that he would hardly care what she did;
rigid faithfulness to Pio, such as she had preserved hitherto,
seemed really rather grotesque.</p>

<p>She glanced half guiltily, half defiantly, at the engraving of
the woman in the crinoline.</p>

<p>"After all, Sophie is right," she admitted. "They are hideous,
and I will take them away. I do belong to this time J live in. I am
quite independent&mdash;it would be silly to be bound by rules and
conventions that don't any longer exist."</p>

<p>She looked at herself in the mirror with the border of gay
fruit, looked almost apprehensively...Could she still make herself
lovely if she wanted to do something better than go round with
Sophie and girls like Sophie and women like Mrs. Falconer, to
clutch at "luck"?</p>

<p>Fatigue was over her like a mantle, but her soul was alert. She
thought of the Burne-Jones picture. "I wonder if I could get
something like that out of it, after all."</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; III</p>

<p>She put out the gas and went into the corridor, which was in
darkness; her fingers went mechanically to the bracket where the
matches were kept, and struck one. As the light flared out she saw
the white square of a letter on the floor; she must have stepped on
it when she entered.</p>

<p>Usually she looked for the post; to-night she had been
preoccupied by the failure of the evening. She stooped and picked
up the letter; the match went out; but she had seen the Italian
postmark.</p>

<p>From her husband.</p>

<p>Funny to think of it lying there while she and Sophie talked;
while she thought of Toby Entwhistle.</p>

<p>But what difference would it make? It would be a friendly
letter, as usual. And probably he wanted money.</p>

<p>She lit the gas in her bedroom...cold now, and tired.</p>

<p>"It doesn't matter about Pio," she told herself. "He doesn't
want me, and I can do exactly as I like. As Sophie said.
Free&mdash;we women are all free."</p>

<p>She noticed her own fair hand as she opened the thin
envelope&mdash;really a fair hand, frail and lovely.</p>

<p>The letter was quite brief&mdash;the name at the top that of a
hotel in Florence.</p>

<p>He, her husband, had left Sicily, after quarrelling with his
family; he was ill, seriously ill. He had taken a furnished house
on the coast, and wanted her to come out and nurse him...<i>at
once;</i> he was both appealing and imperative...<i>at
once.</i></p>

<p>"I can do exactly as I like," murmured Lucie. "Of course, I
shan't go."</p>

<p>She lit a night-light; she was afraid of the dark since the baby
died, afraid of her own nerves.</p>

<p>She put out the gas, undressed and got into bed.</p>

<p>It didn't seem real that she had a husband; what he asked of her
was grotesque.</p>

<p>He was a weakling.</p>

<p>How he had cried when the baby died; sobbed and screamed like a
hurt child.</p>

<p><i>Their</i> baby, that seemed grotesque, too.</p>

<p>She lay down, flicking the letter off the coverlet with a
shudder.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; IV</p>

<p>Seriously ill.</p>

<p>If he died she would be really free.</p>

<p>But it was too late. Nothing could happen now.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>Chapter Three</h2>

<p class="cpb">&sect; I</p>

<p>LUCIE could not sleep; she lay still, overwhelmed with gloom and
depression, her body inert, her mind active.</p>

<p>She longed for sleep, she longed for the dawn.</p>

<p>Looking presently at the travelling clock that stood behind the
night-light on the chimney-piece, she saw that it was three
o'clock.</p>

<p>At the same moment a streak of white light showed under the
door.</p>

<p>Lucie heard a footstep; Sophie entered, leaving the electric
light up in the corridor as she shut the door.</p>

<p>"I couldn't sleep," she said. "What is the use of trying? I
thought you would be awake."</p>

<p>"But I shall go to sleep soon," answered Lucie, "do go back to
bed, dear."</p>

<p>Sophie took no notice of this; she sat on the side of the bed
and yawned.</p>

<p>She wore a tweed coat over a thin draggled night gown and her
hair as it had been all the evening; hair pins sticking in a rough
mass of locks and the greasy bow on one side.</p>

<p>Lucie resented her appearance; she detested this habit of the
wrong garment at the wrong time; she thought of the clothes she had
given Sophie.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" she asked in a voice as free from irritation
as she could make it.</p>

<p>"We've got a party at the studio tomorrow. I didn't tell you, we
want you to come."</p>

<p>Lucie knew at once that she had not meant to ask her; but on
thinking it over had changed her mind.</p>

<p>Lucie was used to not being asked to "parties" arranged by
Sophie.</p>

<p>She did not want to go to this one, but was fearful of giving
offence.</p>

<p>"All right, we will talk of it to-morrow," she answered. But
Sophie did not move.</p>

<p>In the thick wavering light of the night-light she looked a
clumsy hunched figure in the heavy incongruous coat. "Simon Kaye is
coming," she said.</p>

<p>Lucie heard the name with dread; Sophie's tortuous love affair
with this man stretched back years; Lucie had never understood it,
lately she had not even tried.</p>

<p>"I thought that was all over," she said, feebly dropping her
head on the pillow. "You said so, Sophie."</p>

<p>"I found I couldn't bear it&mdash;I wrote to him and he came to
see me. I think it is all right now."</p>

<p>"You mean you are going to marry him?" asked the other
woman.</p>

<p>"Mother asked him for to-morrow," evaded Sophie. "She got the
party up for him, really."</p>

<p>"I don't understand why you bother about other men."</p>

<p>"Oh, just a distraction, I suppose. Besides I don't bother. They
come after me."</p>

<p>"Don't let them. Concentrate on Simon Kaye if he is really the
one."</p>

<p>"You know he is&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, then&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He doesn't want to marry. Mother says he's too absorbed in
money making now&mdash;but that it is going to be all right."</p>

<p>Lucie sat up in bed; her nerves were on edge; she had listened
so often to the futile, painful confidences about Simon Kaye.</p>

<p>"Sophie&mdash;it's nearly ten years that this has been going on.
Do put it out of your head," she urged feverishly. "If he wanted to
marry you, he would&mdash;that seems so plain. Don't let him keep
you hanging about like this. It is worrying your mother so."</p>

<p>"You don't understand," answered Sophie with gloomy melancholy.
"I don't care for anything else."</p>

<p>Lucie lay silent.</p>

<p>Sophie went on talking.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; II</p>

<p>Her voice wandered up and down over the tangles of this
miserable passion of hers; she went over the interviews, the
letters, the telephone calls, the long silences, the waitings, the
disappointments&mdash;years of it now.</p>

<p>The man cared, but had never spoken; she cared, but could not
make him believe it&mdash;they had met and parted with "scenes"
time after time.</p>

<p>It was all so dreary and dull; the girl seemed weighed with
gloomy tragedy, that was without splendour or grandeur.</p>

<p>There was something cold-blooded even in her account of her own
suffering.</p>

<p>Her passion, like her youth, seemed abortive; she was like a
rootless flower trying to bear fruit.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; III</p>

<p>Lucie's head was aching furiously. She sat restlessly up in
bed.</p>

<p>"I wish you would give him up. He is making a lot of
money&mdash;too much for our set."</p>

<p>"I ought to have money, too. I ought to be mixing with the
people he is&mdash;I never have a chance of even meeting him."</p>

<p>"He is standing for Parliament, isn't he?"</p>

<p>"Well, then, that will absorb him even more."</p>

<p>"But I am sure he cares for me. He thinks he isn't good enough.
He told me once that there were other women and that he gambled and
drank. Of course I don't mind."</p>

<p>"Don't you, really?"</p>

<p>"No. I haven't got your ideas of marriage. I should go
crazy&mdash;'settled down' with sock mending and
cooking&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How would you live?"</p>

<p>"Like he does now, in chambers or a hotel&mdash;he could go away
for weeks if he liked&mdash;without me, I mean."</p>

<p>She spoke childishly, yet there was something unpleasant about
her manner.</p>

<p>Lucie put her hand to her beating head.</p>

<p>"That's it&mdash;you want to get married, like all of them, but
you don't want to be married. You want to lead the same old
life."</p>

<p>"Why not? Women are free now, aren't they?"</p>

<p>"Oh, this freedom!"</p>

<p>"I could never stand those stuffy Darby and Joan marriages."</p>

<p>"I know. But, Sophie, don't fool about with all these other men
if you are so keen on the one."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"It's silly."</p>

<p>"I don't think so."</p>

<p>Lucie felt angry; her cousin's half insolent indifference,
unmoved apathy on these matters hardly ever failed to rouse her;
and now she was so tired.</p>

<p>"It isn't decent. It is vulgar."</p>

<p>"I don't mind," said Sophie.</p>

<p>"Those women we saw to-night," said Lucie. "What are they? They
just take what they can get out of men ... any men. Well, it's
going near it to do what you do&mdash;"</p>

<p>Sophie seemed flattered.</p>

<p>"I can't help attracting men," she smiled.</p>

<p>"You could. Don't think so much about it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Everyone does."</p>

<p>"I know," admitted Lucie, "we know too many women of the same
kind&mdash;it's men, men, men, all the time, either angling for
them, or abusing them, and it's all so ineffectual&mdash;no one
seems to be satisfied even when they do get married. There they
still are, scrambling with the others.&mdash;for what?"</p>

<p>"Well," sneered Sophie, "you aren't leading an orthodox married
life yourself, are you?"</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; IV</p>

<p>Lucie saw the shadow-blotted shape of her husband's letter on
the floor.</p>

<p>"I tried to," she said bitterly. "You know I tried to. And at
least I leave it alone. N? need because I made a failure for you to
do the same."</p>

<p>Sophie peered at her curiously, almost malevolently; she was
secretly glad that Lucie's marriage had gone to pieces, for it
seemed to dispose of, in its failure, many of Luck's annoying, prim
and old-fashioned ideals.</p>

<p>She did not answer now; beyond a point it was not expedient to
offend her cousin, who, though this was never admitted, represented
the Falconers' main source of income.</p>

<p>"Do go to bed," whispered Lucie from the pillow. Sophie
rose.</p>

<p>"Mother thought that you might like to buy some of the cakes and
things for to-morrow."</p>

<p>"All right."</p>

<p>"We could go out tomorrow morning and get them," added Sophie,
"and I must have some new shoes and stockings."</p>

<p>"All right," said Lucie again; she knew she would have to pay
for these items and probably a few other things besides.</p>

<p>But this couldn't be mentioned for fear of hurting their
feelings.</p>

<p>"It is much more difficult to take than to give," was one of
Mrs. Falconer's favourite sayings; and Sophie's attitude was that
the utmost Lucie could do was less than she "owed" her relations,
more gifted, but not so commercially successful.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; V</p>

<p>Sophie had gone, but Lucie could not sleep.</p>

<p>She reached out of bed and picked up her husband's letter.</p>

<p>She was glad that Sophie had not seen it; Sophie, though, seldom
did see anything that did not directly concern her personally.</p>

<p>The air was cold, but not fresh; the room looked wretched in the
smudged flicker of the night-light; everything in it seemed worn
and untidy, confused and purposeless.</p>

<p>Lucie put the letter&mdash;thin crackling paper it was, like a
bank-note&mdash;on the table by her bed and dragged the blankets
over her shoulders.</p>

<p>She thought of Sophie with sharp distaste; the chaos that
surrounded all of them appalled and confounded her; what did they
all want, these striving anxious women like Mrs. Bearish and Mrs.
Falconer, these girls like Sophie and Aurora? Wan or noisy, sullen
or gay, sluts or neat&mdash;all somehow desperate&mdash;what did
they want?</p>

<p>A living, first of all...and after?</p>

<p>Lucie thought of her own case; she was gifted, skilful, her work
was in demand, she could earn a good income, and in this she was
very fortunate; she realized how very fortunate she was.</p>

<p>A man in her place with her luck and talent and opportunities
would be having a very good sort of life.</p>

<p>Then why shouldn't she, since women were as free as men now?</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; VI</p>

<p>What was the use if you were a woman ... you were tripped up
ever time, just by the fact you were a woman.</p>

<p>What was work, or success, or talent, compared to your
womanhood?</p>

<p>You wanted to be loved.</p>

<p>More than anything you wanted that.</p>

<p>You wanted children and a "home."</p>

<p>All your instincts and passions drove you toward these
things.</p>

<p>In your youth they tormented and allured you.</p>

<p>You lay awake at night trembling for fear you should miss
them.</p>

<p>"Supposing no man ever wants me?"</p>

<p>"Supposing I never have any children?"</p>

<p>Marriage was the only way for a woman like you&mdash;and you
married.</p>

<p>There wasn't much choice and you were diffident, very romantic
aid you married the man who made most obvious love to you, who was
able, if only a little, to compare with your secret ideals.</p>

<p>And then you were caught&mdash;"done for."</p>

<p>Your work, your individuality, your chances went by the board,
you were swept into another's life...</p>

<p>You had your baby and lost it.</p>

<p>You had a sick man to nurse.</p>

<p>You could never think of love any more, nor of children.</p>

<p>You were a good woman and you had ideals; it was just over and
done with for you, and you didn't care, for you were stunned
emotionally.</p>

<p>And with this heavy blight over you, you must work&mdash;you'd
been fool enough to marry a penniless sickly man&mdash;he was
looking to you now.</p>

<p>Fool, no doubt&mdash;but you thought you loved him, you wanted
so desperately to be loved, you dreamed you could make it
wonderful.</p>

<p>And what else offered save bleak negation?</p>

<p>That which was within you and too powerful for your poor control
betrayed you.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; VII</p>

<p>And now Lucie's sad mind, half delirious with fatigue, turned
and beat on another problem.</p>

<p>Supposing you weren't respectable, supposing you disregarded
this fetish of marriage?</p>

<p>Wouldn't that be real freedom?</p>

<p>Why was the idea so terrifying?</p>

<p>How little you knew of those other women, the women you mustn't
talk about&mdash;or know about, really. And you didn't know.</p>

<p>What men said about them, when you weren't there, how they lived
and how they spoke among themselves.</p>

<p>You read about them, you saw them, you heard, sometimes,
references to them, newspapers were full of them, you suspected
them among women you met casually or knew by name&mdash;they were
feminine creatures like yourself, but intensely unreal to you.</p>

<p>You supposed men, even quiet-looking men, knew all about them
and judged or condemned them according to their natures. You
couldn't do that.</p>

<p>It was all shut away from you; you were a "nice" woman and you
had to get married or be an old maid.</p>

<p>But you often wondered about those other women.</p>

<p>You had to wonder, for you simply didn't know.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; VIII</p>

<p>Lucie Uden wept into her pillow,</p>

<p>Not from active unhappiness or definite pain, she was past
both.</p>

<p>But from wild yearnings and desperate home sickness of the
soul.</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
"The harvest is over and I have garnered no grain<br>
When evening falls there will be no home lights for me,<br>
Only the long gray road that leads into the darkness."</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; IX</p>

<p>It was all so ordinary.</p>

<p>If people remarked upon her career at all, it was only to say
how stupid she had been, a woman of her gifts, to get married at
all, unless she could have secured a man of wealth and
position.</p>

<p>Even Mrs. Falconer had appeared rather relieved at the failure
of Lucie's attempt at domesticity.</p>

<p>"A woman like you doesn't want to shut herself up in a nursery,
my dear girl."</p>

<p>And though she had been sorry when the baby died, she had been
quite definitely glad when Pio's cough had taken him to Italy.</p>

<p>No, there weren't many women in Lucie's set who could have
sympathised with her secret anguish&mdash;some of them thought that
a "good time" and "fun" could be got out of an independent income
and a husband abroad.</p>

<p>Anyhow&mdash;it was all so ordinary.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; X</p>

<p>Lucie put her husband's letter under her pillow.</p>

<p>She tried to recall something about him that was pleasant...she
went over his love-making, his emotional scenes with her, his gusts
of jealousy, his displays of quick crude passion.</p>

<p>Useless, not a spark of any sentiment save compassion could she
arouse.</p>

<p>There was nothing there that had been worth while&mdash;nothing
whatever.</p>

<p>She told herself that it didn't matter&mdash;she had to keep on
telling herself that.</p>

<p>She was just part of the general chaos&mdash;whirling about like
a speck of dust before the wind.</p>

<p>It was all so ordinary.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4"></a>Chapter Four</h2>

<p class="cpb">&sect; I</p>

<p>THE "party" at Sophie's studio was crowded by all the people
Lucie had seen there before.</p>

<p>No one knew why Sophie had this studio; but she had always kept
it up; it was really the one staple thing about Sophie, for the
Falconers moved about every six months and the studio remained the
one permanent address.</p>

<p>It was "off" Kensington High Street and very expensive for the
wretched accommodation offered, always dirty and generally occupied
by diseased cats, who were made more than free of the place by
Sophie, whose one definite enthusiasm appeared to be centred on
animals.</p>

<p>There was not much furniture; what there was was most
characteristic of Sophie.</p>

<p>There was a piano for her to "practise on," a long glass for her
to "pose" before, a divan for her to lounge on, and a hideous
collection of all kinds of litter spilling from boxes, bursting
from portfolios, hung upon pegs and thrust into cupboards. [To-day
it had been tidied.]</p>

<p>The rubbish was crammed away into corners behind draperies, a
row of dirty, chipped mascots were dusted and put on the
mantelshelf surrounding a large press photograph of Sophie, which
she had touched up herself with black and white paints, and a
straggling collection of snapshots of men many of whom Sophie
didn't know.</p>

<p>The few Sowers Lucie had bought&mdash;few, because they were so
expensive in February, were arranged in odd jars, and Mrs. Falconer
had brought extra tea equipment and arranged it on a side
table.</p>

<p>All three women had spent the morning doing this and going round
the shops, and now, after a nondescript meal on the marble topped
table of a "tea-shop," they stood cutting sandwiches and taking
cakes and biscuits out of cardboard boxes and paper bags.</p>

<p>Lucie felt wretched; tired, first from her sleepless night,
then, from the scurry round the shops, the rushing from tube to bus
laden with parcels, the "tidying" of the studio.</p>

<p>Sophie had been disagreeable and difficult, at once stubbornly
set on the "party" and apathetic about it; she had been tiresome
over the purchase of the shoes and Lucie had known her own temper
wearing thin.</p>

<p>The sights of the morning had depressed her also, like a living
commentary on her thoughts of the night.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; II</p>

<p>In the artificial brightness of the tubes, two sickly babies,
stifling for fresh air, stunned by the blast and rattle, wailing
till they were shaken and thumped: in the buses a press of women in
unsuitable, fantastic costumes, some painted, all more or less
anxious, haggard, loaded with parcels of finery, hung with beads,
crippled with fancy shoes, with faces powdered, dirty, wrinkled or
smooth, with teeth discoloured, bad or false, clutching frivolous
bags of beads or silk or velvet, thrust together in the great
square buses, shrill or silent, jaded or giggling,&mdash;a great
press of women being swept along the packed London street.</p>

<p>On the pavements hoards, swarms of women, gazing in the shop
windows, pushing into the tea-shops, some dragging bored and
unwilling children, most of them alone. Lucie had felt like an ant
in an ant-heap; she wished a great wind could blow them all
away.</p>

<p>Women, women everywhere.</p>

<p>There were so many of them the world was beginning to be run to
please them; they had money, too, pennies if not pounds.</p>

<p>Cunning men made it their work to beguile their pennies out of
them&mdash;first clothes, all kinds of clothes&mdash;line on line
of great shops, marble, gilt bronze, pile carpets, music, yards of
mirror, to sell things people could do without.</p>

<p>Stacks and stacks of newspapers and magazines and novels written
for women, carefully prepared to catch and please them, cinema
after cinema, theatre after theatre, catering for women, for all
these myriads of swarming women, uneducated, unwanted, restless,
discontented, powerful by force of number&mdash;like locusts. On
the hoardings, in the buses and tubes, on the covers of books and
papers, women, heads and figures of women, pretty, well-dressed,
comfortable.</p>

<p>Everything to beguile and flatter woman through her vanity, her
idleness, her foolishness, to cheat her into imagining herself
beautiful, pursued, potent and mysterious.</p>

<p>Paints, dyes, creams, beauty parlours, <i>"try us and be like
Cleopatra or Ninon de l'Enclos"</i>&mdash;novels, serials,
newspapers, <i>"read us and see the wonderful things that happen to
you adorable creatures."</i></p>

<p>Cinemas, theatres with the same appeal, shops, exhibitions,
dubs, hotels, all clamouring for the attention, the time and the
pennies of the women&mdash;all sham, fraud, bluff.</p>

<p>And hireling labour (itself feminine, discontented, restless,
with wandering eye on the "pictures," on the novelette in the
pocket) looking after the children of the well-to-do, and the
children of the poor "shifting for themselves."</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; III</p>

<p>Sophie had gone into the little dark cupboard of a room
adjoining the studio to dress, and Lucie finished setting the tea
cups while Mrs. Falconer sat by the gas fire, smoking quickly and
nervously, cigarette after cigarette.</p>

<p>She was tired and overwrought and Lucie yearned over her; Mrs.
Falconer was both charming and lovable, but so wild and weak she
had coiled her life into one knot after another; daring, violent
tempered, unreasonable, yet generous and warm-hearted, well born
and well educated, gifted and of a fascinating personality, she had
made a failure of everything she had touched, including her
daughter, whom she idolised almost to a point of insanity.</p>

<p>She had had, as she often said, "an awful life"; her husband had
been a worthless scoundrel, and she had been through the bittered
embarrassments of sordid poverty; she had quarrelled with her own
family, her husband's family and most of her friends; she was
always courageous, dramatic and agitated, scheming for Sophie, and
full of "plans."</p>

<p>Her work, brilliant in itself, was not marketable; she spent a
lot of time raving against the taste and judgment that would have
none of her or Sophie.</p>

<p>She began about her daughter now, as soon as the door had closed
on her.</p>

<p>"How do you think she is looking, Lucie, she seems to me very
pale&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She wants her face washing and a smile," thought Lucie,
wearily, aloud she said:</p>

<p>"I think she is all right&mdash;we were late last night."</p>

<p>"You ought not to have gone," said Mrs. Falconer vigorously.</p>

<p>"Sophie wanted to go."</p>

<p>"Poor child! The man was put off by those Bearish women."</p>

<p>"Sophie asked them."</p>

<p>"She is always so generous. But Mrs. Bearish should look out for
herself. She never asks <i>us</i> anywhere."</p>

<p>Mrs. Falconer, whose whole disposition was composed of
inconsistencies, was always veering in her opinion of her friends;
at one she would be enthusiastically generously fond of them, at
another perversely jealous.</p>

<p>"It is good of you to have helped us, Lucie." She gave her niece
one of her endearing smiles, and Lucie quickly bent and kissed
her.</p>

<p>She really loved Mrs. Falconer, and it was largely for her sake
that she put up with Sophie, and the life they all lived.</p>

<p>Mrs. Falconer squeezed her hand in silence, never ceasing to
smoke in feverish haste; she was marvellously young in appearance,
eager, vital and charming, and she attached an almost crazy
importance to this question of age; in reality she was an elderly
woman, and the effort to compete with women twenty years younger
than herself was not the least of the strains on her nerves and
temper.</p>

<p>"Oh, Lucie," she cried suddenly. "I do hope he comes this
afternoon&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mr. Kaye?"</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>Tears pricked Lucie's lids, swollen from lack of sleep.</p>

<p>She thought of Pio's letter, unanswered&mdash;waiting for her
when she got home...</p>

<p>Mrs. Falconer continued to talk of Sophie&mdash;Sophie's beauty,
brilliance, wit, fascination, her love affairs, the love affair,
her ill-luck, her health, all dramatically, with fine choice of
words.</p>

<p>Sophie wanted to go on the stage as a dancer. She must
go&mdash;it didn't matter that she had had little
training&mdash;her individuality would be sufficient.</p>

<p>Lucie hardly listened; she knew it all by heart; knew also that
Sophie's dancing had been "turned down" by every manager or agent
who had seen her performance.</p>

<p>And as her mother talked of her, anxiously, passionately, with
abstracted eyes and tired, nervous lips, the girl appeared.</p>

<p>Her hair was fluffed out and her face powdered; she wore an odd
sort of green tulle dress, not at all fresh, white stockings and
cheap velvet shoes; like her mother she was obsessed by this idea
of youthfulness; the one object of her dressing was to look
girlish, even childish; she had set her whole personality at
eighteen and she was so immature that strangers frequently took her
really to be that age.</p>

<p>She had almost succeeded in deceiving herself into believing
that she was a young girl, and into thinking that people who had
known her "hawking" round for twelve years or so, thought so
too.</p>

<p>She at down now on a stool by her mother's chair, clasping her
hands round her knees and tucking her feet under her skirt;
although she was graceful, her ankles were clumsy and her legs
thick; she made no effort to finish "getting the tea"; it was Lucie
who did that, piling up the cakes (she disliked sweet things),
slicing, toasting, boiling the kettle on the gas ring, measuring
out the tea.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; IV</p>

<p>Lucie had a curious feeling about tea; she rather dreaded
it&mdash;it was so inevitable&mdash;it always turned up at a
crisis.</p>

<p>In all the horrible moments of her life there had always been
someone hurriedly making tea as if it was a panacea against all
ills.</p>

<p>To the sick excitement of long journeys had always been added
someone's lament <i>"if only I could get a cup of tea"</i>; the
dread discomfort of "moves" was associated with <i>"I'm dying for a
cup of tea"</i> and in moments of shock, or loss, or anguish, there
was always&mdash;<i>"do try to take a cup of tea."</i></p>

<p>Whether you liked it or not it haunted you; it was always there,
insistent, you found yourself sipping or gulping it in your strange
and dark hours.</p>

<p>And did you not read of it, linked up with all wretchedness?</p>

<p>A warm tea pot and soiled cup by the suicide's bed, or on the
table beneath which the murdered woman sprawled&mdash;<i>"They made
themselves a cup of tea, and then"</i>&mdash;the prelude to many
and desperate and awful acts.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; V</p>

<p>The guests began to arrive; Lucie looked at herself in the long
glass; she thought she appeared utterly "washed out" in her neutral
coloured dress and black hat; the lines in her face were heavy, her
pressed down hair no colour at all.</p>

<p>"It doesn't matter," she told herself resolutely, "and I must
not let myself get so depressed; everything is all right really,
just because my little corner of the world seems wrong I must not
think the whole universe is."</p>

<p>Mrs. Falconer was all animation now, greeting everyone with
effusive kindness, confidential with the women, coquettish with the
men, flattering to everyone.</p>

<p>The room was soon full of noise and clatter; Lucie, glad of
something to do, went to and fro with plates of sandwiches and
cakes. Her mind, tired, alert, supersensitive, would note and
analyze the people among whom she moved despite her resolve to be
cheerful and sensible.</p>

<p>They were nearly all women, of course.</p>

<p>And, it went without saying, free and independent women; so free
and independent that it would have been considered fogeyish to
mention the fact&mdash;it was just taken for granted.</p>

<p>Lydia Copeland was there, the prettiest woman in the room,
dressed in jade green, with "real" gold hair, but bloodshot eyes
and a sunken mouth, insolent to the women, defiant to the men, a
clever young actress of disreputable history, vulgar, amorous, a
shrew and as hard as flint. Near her was Julia Jarrett, well
groomed, well dressed, prim and silent with "pince-nez" and white
kid gloves; Lucie remembered her (it seemed yesterday) as an
unattractive child; now she was a welfare worker and studying for
the bar. Beyond was Hester Foy, plain, fusty, wearing hideous
clothes smelling of naphtha, sweetly superior, middle-aged,
outwardly placid, inwardly soured, thwarted, sick, by profession a
singer, like Sophie, unmarried, very "refined."</p>

<p>Then on the divan behind them were the girls, Ellen Bowness, the
only child of a wealthy home, spoilt, idle, silly, expensively
dressed, painted, giggling, hollow-chested, gaunt, but bright and
good-humoured.</p>

<p>She did not belong to this set at all but was there for
"fun"; her parents rather admired Sophie's voice, and Mrs. Falconer
had desperately encouraged them; they were well off and might be
"useful."</p>

<p>The other girl, Pamela Raitt, was far more pleasing in
appearance, but jaded, tired, soiled; she worked as a secretary to
two different men; one in the mornings, one in the evenings, she
made just thirty-five shillings a week.</p>

<p>Then there was Mrs. Bearish, faded, shabby, yet finished and
elegant (Aurora would come in later after her time at the office),
talking to a quite well-known and brilliant woman, Louisa Kingdom,
who shouted and gesticulated with ink-stained fingers, and dragged
on and off her head a dirty tweed hat and looked pale and sandy and
vicious like a ferret.</p>

<p>And near there, two large elderly women, Harriet Dornett and
Ellen Barden, ardent feminists, who took up "causes" and were rude
and offensive in appearance, jabbering their own particular jargon
to Clara Biddulph, a haggard woman of sixty dressed like sixteen,
with a hat like an inverted flowerpot hung with streamers, and
knobbly toes showing through satin shoes; she appeared to think the
two reformers rather wonderful, but then she was a literary agent
and had to keep "nosing" for possible clients as well as avoiding
those who weren't and never could be anything but impossible from a
commercial point of view.</p>

<p>Sophie lounged over a table with her great friend of the moment,
Elinor Kennaway, whose chinless face showed the entire upper set of
long teeth beneath a parrot's nose and lovely eyes; they were
playing with a sheet of paper and "planchette" and had gathered
round them the only men present.</p>

<p>The men were very ineffective, sufficient only to give the
faintest flavour of masculinity to the party, like one drop of
sherry in a huge sponge trifle.</p>

<p>One of these, Mr. Dodd, was a very old friend of the Falconers
whom he regarded as superior beings; he was so very unpresentable,
so hopelessly not a "gentleman" that he was only tolerated at these
gatherings because he enjoyed them and he had to be kept in a good
humour somehow for they owed him a great deal of money and intended
to owe him a great deal more.</p>

<p>A civil servant of thrifty habits, short to deformity,
red-haired, with the bewildered, grave countenance of a chimpanzee,
Mrs. Falconer had actually been able to flatter him into thinking
he was a valuable member of society and an ornament to the
brilliant set in which she moved.</p>

<p>He adored her and thought both she and Sophie the most wonderful
of beings; behind his back Mrs. Falconer laughed at him and Sophie
sneered.</p>

<p>Lucie disliked him, disliked still more the familiarity he was
allowed&mdash;ah, how she disliked it all!</p>

<p>Another of the men was a starved-looking Irish charlatan, who
had wonderful gifts in the way of making other people believe he
had strange psychic powers, and who specialized in ghosts, spirits,
elementals, or whatever happened to be the last thing in horrors;
another was a provincial actor who had trained his face to look
classic in the limelight and his figure to wear stage uniforms till
there was nothing human about his appearance save his encroaching
puffiness and stoutness&mdash;these two defects being at least
pitilessly real.</p>

<p>And the third man was a young clerk who was wrong altogether,
appearance, manners, voice, clothes; he had come out of the War (he
had served a year in England at the end of things) with the title
of Captain, and insisted on this, and let the women insist on it,
till he felt he was what enthusiastic Mrs. Falconer, in her delight
at his admiration of Sophie had called him&mdash;"a typical English
soldier."</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; VI</p>

<p>Lucie looked from one to another, looked back again, tried,
feverishly, to "make conversation" first to one and then at
another.</p>

<p>"Am I wrong in thinking them all hideous, cheats, frauds,
selfish, abortive? I must be. They all seem satisfied with each
other. And who am I to judge?"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch5" id="ch5"></a>Chapter Five</h2>

<p class="cpb">&sect; I</p>

<p>LUCIE sat down beside a pale young woman who was rather a
successful journalist; Lucie spoke to her of her little boy; she
was the only woman in the room who had a child.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mayes responded cordially; the boy was "in the country,"
she didn't see him often; her work kept her in town; he was three,
she was really only just beginning to recover from the "awful" time
she had had when he was born.</p>

<p>She slid with relish into a brutal account of her confinement,
the state of health it had left her with and her precautions to
prevent the recurrence of such a catastrophe.</p>

<p>"My husband wants a little girl! I tell him he can have the next
himself&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Lucie mechanically and moved away, under the excuse
of taking Miss Dornett's empty cup.</p>

<p>She was at once swept into the conversation between this lady,
Miss Barden and Mrs. Biddulph, in which the violent Louisa Kingdom
had now powerfully joined.</p>

<p>Mrs. Biddulph listened vaguely while the other three boomed and
shrilled.</p>

<p>They were all on the same committees, belonged to the same
societies and clubs, wrote on the same subjects.</p>

<p>The object of their venomous energies seemed the pursuit,
punishment and castigation of man.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; II</p>

<p>Had you not known they were honest, good, earnest, pure women,
you might have likened them to harpies, flying about in search of
filth, and finding it, flapping and screaming with triumph with
their claws full of foulness.</p>

<p>They knew all the disgusting things in the
world&mdash;intimately; there was no sore so deep hidden that they
had not found it out and explored it; there was no vice so secret
that they had not proclaimed it aloud; there was no disease, nor
passion, nor crime, nor emotion, they had not turned over and
examined.</p>

<p>They were social reformers.</p>

<p>They loathed man; they lost breath trying to relate his sins and
wickedness; he was bestial, he was hideous&mdash;a Minotaur; and
they must save the young virgins from him.</p>

<p>They were so pure that the thought of marriage offended them, so
spiritual they thought of child-bearing as an outrage; but they
knew backwards the holes and corners where foul and creeping vices
hide.</p>

<p>They were feminists.</p>

<p>They used terms that would have been obscene if they had not
been "scientific"; they flung about words that had never been on
decent women's lips since they were coined; they drew their
instances and statistics from the police courts and the hospitals,
the gutters and the slums of Europe.</p>

<p>They scorned as cowards women who would not join them, and they
proclaimed with gloomy satisfaction the fast approaching day when
man would be a chained monster, bound by the delicate hands of
women, scourged by the whips wielded by the angelic and triumphant
sex.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; III</p>

<p>Sophie was singing.</p>

<p>She had a full rich voice on which a good deal of money had been
spent (Lucie's money), but it was all to pieces now for lack of
practice, and Mrs. Falconer, tired and nervous, stumbled in the
accompaniments.</p>

<p>Sophie posed.</p>

<p>Drooping, watchful, rigid with vanity and jealousy of every
other woman there, yet apathetic, she dragged through her
songs.</p>

<p>Lucie was appalled by a sense of failure; Simon Kaye had not
come; he never did; and there was that letter to write to Pio.</p>

<p>Sophie danced.</p>

<p>Twisting gauze veils, she slopped through a series of poses to a
melody on the gramophone, looking self-conscious and sullen; the
men were enthusiastic in their praise; the women had an air of
reserved judgment.</p>

<p>Mrs. Falconer, smoking furiously, gazed at her daughter with
fierce eyes of love and admired her in warm phrases.</p>

<p>Aurora Bearish slipped in, bringing a foreign young man who
appeared both shy and impertinent; the gas was lit; Mrs. Falconer
kept saying "Hush!"</p>

<p>Sophie continued to circle aimlessly round the room, waving the
chiffon scarf; soiled tea cups and bitten piece of cake were piled
up in corners, crumbs were over the cheap mats, the sandwiches
began to dry and curl; the tobacco smoke had drowned the opulent
perfumes used by Lydia Copeland and Ellen Bowness; the gas fumes
made the air acrid and heavy.</p>

<p>Lucie sat in a corner now next Mrs. Bearish, who whispered to
her about her work; the woodcuts, the designs for costumes, the
Eastern textiles, her illustrations...Oh, yes, she was doing quite
well&mdash;it was all quite successful. Even as she spoke she felt
how utterly little she cared if her work was praised or not; what
did it matter save as a means of earning money?</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; IV</p>

<p>Oh, to get away from it all&mdash;to some ordered path of sober
riches, or of austere poverty! Oh, for leisure and peace and the
long day to live through in pleasant work and happy play&mdash;to
feel well and content among quiet serene people, to love and be
loved, walking the homely happy ways of every day.</p>

<p>To be noticed and valued as a woman, not as a money earning,
fame catching asset&mdash;to be done with the struggle and the
tumult, the press and clash, the uproar and the confusion&mdash;to
have the grass beneath your feet and the stars above your head,
fruit and flowers in your lap and a child in your arms.</p>

<p>Oh, to get away from it all!</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; V</p>

<p>At last Sophie stopped; her mother praised, petted and coaxed
her; she said she had a headache, and there was a hunt for
aspirin.</p>

<p>People began to leave; eager plans were made for other meetings;
Mr. Dodd suggested "a dinner in Soho"; the Irish charlatan, Hamish
O'More, invited everyone to a ghost-raising, the women shrilled and
tittered; the younger ones tried to combine a party to go to some
"palais de danse"; they all talked at once and Lucie's head
throbbed steadily.</p>

<p>The young clerk, Mead Preston, lingered and with much
familiarity and swagger asked Sophie&mdash;"Tommy" as he called her
with an air of being witty "out to supper."</p>

<p>He included Mrs. Falconer as an afterthought. She declined, and
Sophie, with a smirk under her rude apathy, thrust a flop hat on
her disordered hair, dragged on a coat belonging to her mother, and
went off leaving the other two women to "dear up."</p>

<p>"I am so glad he asked her," declared Mrs. Falconer, "it will
take her mind off things&mdash;he is so much in love with
her&mdash;it is wonderful how she turns their heads&mdash;poor
child!"</p>

<p>"Sit down," said Lucie. "You're tired. I'll do this and get a
little supper&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And something for Sophie when she comes back; she will be worn
out&mdash;I thought she would have broken down&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Because Mr. Kaye didn't come?"</p>

<p>"Lucie," said Mrs. Falconer earnestly and impressively, "it is a
tragedy&mdash;and I can do nothing!"</p>

<p>"Why does she go out with this young man?" asked Lucie rather
sharply.</p>

<p>At that moment she hated Sophie, who appeared to her a fell
figure, for Mrs. Falconer leant back and cried quietly, looking old
and broken.</p>

<p>"I did so hope he would come, I did so hope it would be all
right for her&mdash;she is breaking her heart and I can't bear
it."</p>

<p>Lucie leant heavily against the back of the chair looking
hopelessly down on the other woman, round them the litter of the
feast, the gas-laden, smoke-tainted air.</p>

<p>Mrs. Falconer began to lament her fate, to bemoan Sophie's
destiny with dreadful emotion and force.</p>

<p>Lucie sank to the low stool at her feet and caressed her
hands.</p>

<p>She had heard it all so often before and there was nothing to be
said.</p>

<p>She could think of nothing that would put things right but
plenty of money, and she would never be able to command plenty of
money.</p>

<p>Mrs. Falconer's piteous laments continued; the outcry of a brave
soul, an impetuous and generous soul.</p>

<p>"Sophie's life is going to bits like mine did," she said. "And I
can't bear it! I can't bear it!"</p>

<p>"She'll be all right&mdash;she'll get married," answered Lucie
faintly.</p>

<p>"Married!" cried Mrs. Falconer. "I wish she would, but if it
isn't that one man, it won't help Sophie much&mdash;not unless he
had money&mdash;" she finished vaguely.</p>

<p>"Marriage is one of the best things we've got," said Lucie. "It
seems to me a woman must get married unless she is a saint or a
monster."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's out of date," answered Mrs. Falconer impatiently.
"Surely we have all learnt that women were not made for
domesticity."</p>

<p>"Then why aren't you happy about Sophie with her admirers and
freedom?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Falconer sat up, lit a cigarette and smoked in silence.
"Sophie ought to work," said Lucie, "she has too much time to
brood."</p>

<p>"Sophie can't work while her heart and mind are agitated by this
love affair&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, as I said, marriage&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mrs. Falconer interrupted.</p>

<p>"Sophie wants <i>success.</i> She sees other women with all they
want who don't work&mdash;look at Lydia Copeland, she hasn't a
tithe of Sophie's looks or charm or brains&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But she is a horrid woman," said Lucie quickly. "Common
and&mdash;she has been divorced, hasn't she? And she isn't living
with her present husband. And she has got a daughter hidden away in
a cheap boarding school&mdash;she talks noisily about <i>'living
her own life'</i> and <i>'the right to be an
individuality.'"</i></p>

<p>"She leads a very pleasant life," said Mrs. Falconer
obstinately, "and of course a woman can do anything nowadays if she
is clever."</p>

<p>Lucie could not argue further; she turned away and began to
collect the soiled cups and plates and to put the remains of the
cakes and biscuits into tins.</p>

<p>Mrs. Falconer, wholly absorbed in the problem of Sophie, sat
over the gas fire talking vaguely, disjointedly, yet passionately
and intensely about her daughter and herself and their
"ill-luck."</p>

<p>It was all utterly illogical; even while Lucie's sympathy and
affection groaned over the distress of the woman she loved, her
clear brain showed her the unreasonableness of these typically
feminine temperaments.</p>

<p>That was the worst of it&mdash;unreasonableness!</p>

<p>Something you couldn't deal with or argue with, that tangled and
coiled you up till you felt half crazy yourself, that led to
injustice, violence, hatreds and furious indiscretions. Minds
without logic or philosophy or sense of law or order, feminine
minds swayed by emotional impulses, strong jealousies, blind
vanity, hungry cravings, natures shaken by thwarted instincts and
suppressed desires, unstable, fluid, on the verge of perpetual
hysteria, unbalanced to the edge of insanity&mdash;did not Lucie
know the type?</p>

<p>Had she not been brought up by it, lived with it, did she not
meet it every day among the women who composed her
acquaintances?</p>

<p>She was herself an exceptional woman in so far as she could see
and judge the temperaments of these others and herself, infected in
so far as that she could not, dare not stand clear of all these
discontented, piteous and dangerous women.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; VI</p>

<p>Gamblers&mdash;that is what women were&mdash;they wanted "luck"
and "chances"; they staked their sex, their looks, their
personality&mdash;they coined themselves, as it were, into currency
with which to purchase their desires; they hadn't any imagination
or power of thought; they weren't really intelligent, most of them,
only cunning.</p>

<p>And so few were, in any sense of the word, educated.</p>

<p>And they were so greedy; they were out for the real big prizes;
they claimed idleness, luxury, admiration as a birthright; they
schemed, contrived&mdash;gamblers always&mdash;evading work,
evading responsibility, snatching at "chance," clutching at
"luck."</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; VII</p>

<p>Yet Lucie yearned over Mrs. Falconer; she went up to her now and
kissed her thin smooth cheek.</p>

<p>"I do wish I could make it different!" she whispered. "I do
wish!"</p>

<p>And Mrs. Falconer caressed her warmly, and the two women cried
together a little from sheer weariness of heart.</p>

<p>Yet all the time the elder resented the younger's feeble
success, her poor marriage&mdash;Sophie had not achieved even
this&mdash;passionately jealous was the maternal heart for
Sophie.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; VIII</p>

<p>Could some being of some other sphere, of angelic power but
human compassion, have brooded over these two then, and seen into
their hearts, would he not, for all their weaknesses and follies,
have pitied them?</p>

<p>Knowing what their sweet natural uses were, seeing how they had
been used by the passing breath of a civilization into which their
flickers of lives had been cast, would he not have pitied them?</p>

<p>Truly there was cause for divine tears in the story of Elizabeth
Falconer once so gay, so brave, so bright and alluring, full of
warm impulses and generous thoughts, suppressed, but not trained,
threatened, but not guided by the dull dictates of nineteenth
century Christianity, left penniless by an extravagant father,
married at eighteen to a handsome ruffian, watching her family "go
to pieces," trying to "reform" her husband, trying to earn her
living, on the stage, by writing, using her wits desperately,
losing caste, following the black sheep she had married into his
own sooty pastures until she had to cast him off and struggle on
alone with two little children on her hands, intriguing, scheming,
using her charm and her sex as her only weapons, borrowing
shillings from women, taking pounds from men, dragging from sordid
lodging to sordid lodging, familiar with debts, police courts,
humiliations, of bittered poverty, seeing only the horrible side of
things, consorting with a queer flotsam and jetsam of failures and
knaves, quarrelling, fighting, weeping, starving and shabby, shaken
by passionate friendships with men that ended
in&mdash;nothing&mdash;lying awake in her dingy bed to hear her
drunken husband smashing the bell or breaking the window below, or
meeting him at street corners, thrusting a few shillings into his
hand "to keep him quiet"&mdash;yet remaining always a refined
gentlewoman, and never becoming utterly submerged or indeed much
soiled by the putrid waters flowing round her. And then, the
prosperity brought by Lucie's success, and the unwise, untrained
spending of it, and Sophie's jealousy, and Sophie's failure, and
still the struggle and the scheming, and the plots, and the
quarrels, and the hot resentment against encroaching age and
increasing languors of body, and the bitterness of her own empty
hands...and the end of all things not so far away now.</p>

<p>The abominable husband was dead these ten years and his family,
through this and Lucie's success, reconciled; very few of her
present acquaintances knew what her life had been; but she could
never forget; it had made her what she was.</p>

<p>And what of the younger woman who had grown up by her side
through all her wretchedness and misery?</p>

<p>Starved and silenced, shabby and ashamed, outcast in every
sense, untrained, uneducated, used to swirling passions and
desperate scenes, familiar with bitter tears and angry outcries,
suddenly finding she could earn money, quite a lot of money, with
her gifts, writing, painting, designing feverishly, just for the
money, delighting to spend it freely, in the most obvious ways on
all of them; then, like her own mother, like Elizabeth Falconer,
tripped and flung by her emotions.</p>

<p>Married recklessly&mdash;earning money to keep a sick
husband&mdash;earning money to keep a baby, to keep all of them;
now, in full youth, left with an invalid and a little grave.</p>

<p>And so they cried together, poor women, such fools, so scourged
and lashed by that enigma we call Destiny.</p>

<p>And presently Lucie went back to finish "tidying up" and Mrs.
Falconer lit another cigarette and asked Lucie if...she could
manage ten pounds by the end of the week.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch6" id="ch6"></a>Chapter Six</h2>

<p class="cpb">&sect; I</p>

<p>LUCIE kept thinking of her answer to that letter of Pio's while
she was giving Mrs. Falconer supper in the great, marble, gilt and
glass palace of a tea shop. She was thinking of it afterwards, when
they went back to the studio to wait for Sophie.</p>

<p>She did not speak of it; she talked, rather rapidly, about her
work.</p>

<p>There was quite a demand for her articles, her designs, her
illustrations; Mrs. Falconer brightened into some glow of pride in
her achievement, especially as Lucie had provided the ten
pounds.</p>

<p>"You ought to have a studio and gather people round you,
Lucie."</p>

<p>Lucie, who worked in the "spare" bedroom of the furnished flat,
said nothing; she knew that she could never afford a studio.</p>

<p>"You have really got a wonderful career," added Mrs.
Falconer.</p>

<p>Lucie smiled.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I don't really care for a career," she said gently.
"And I don't like crowds."</p>

<p>"You're so unsociable."</p>

<p>"I suppose so."</p>

<p>"There is no end to what a woman like you could do. You don't
make the most of yourself."</p>

<p>Lucie's smile was unsteady now.</p>

<p>"It seems rather useless&mdash;doesn't it?"</p>

<p>"You're thinking of Pio?"</p>

<p>"Oh, well&mdash;" Mrs. Falconer shrugged in irritation. "How
could he count?&mdash;these days&mdash;"</p>

<p>Lucie hated the last two words; she thought they meant nothing
at all, yet they were always used as final and weighty arguments;
how could "these days" be different from any other&mdash;were we
not, save in shifting transient custom, the same as the citizens of
Memphis, the inhabitants of Susa or Tyre?</p>

<p>"Pio is not so well," she said suddenly. "I ought to get home
and write to him to-night."</p>

<p>Mrs. Falconer ignored the first part of this sentence.</p>

<p>"I must wait for Sophie," she said. "Perhaps she means to go on
to a theatre and sleep here."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," assented Lucie; Sophie's plans were always vague; she
never told anyone in advance what she might do or not do; the
possession of the "studio" helped her to all sorts of
irresponsibility and confusion of daily life.</p>

<p>"You're tired," added Lucie. "Go home and I'll wait for
her."</p>

<p>How ironic the word "home" sounded to her own ears; Mrs.
Falconer, who was perpetually "moving" at present occupied
furnished rooms, that she did not like, at Richmond.</p>

<p>"I suppose? ought to be here when she returns," said Mrs.
Falconer wearily speaking from some dim echo of her own girlhood's
conventions, "but I suppose it doesn't matter even if she does
bring the young man up&mdash;girls are so free now&mdash;"</p>

<p>"As free as weeds&mdash;as plentiful, as unregarded, as often
trampled on by indifferent feet," said Lucie bitterly.</p>

<p>"I don't know. Women get a very good time now&mdash;so many
doors open now." Mrs. Falconer spoke flatly; she was really old and
tired.</p>

<p>Yes, plenty of open doors now&mdash;but open on what? Arid
avenues leading to nothingness.</p>

<p>"Do you want me to stay?" asked Lucie, putting on her hat. "I
had that letter to write and some work to finish&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Is Pio really ill?"</p>

<p>"He seems to think so."</p>

<p>"He was always nervous and fanciful&mdash;I don't suppose it is
anything. I wish Sophie would make haste. It is horrid for you
going back to that lonely flat. We must take a place together. Toby
Entwhistle is coming back soon. I'm hoping he'll give Sophie a good
time&mdash;"</p>

<p>Thus Mrs. Falconer, vaguely, wearily, yet with such notes of
tenderness and affection that Lucie felt the silly tears against
her lids. What a "good time" would Elizabeth Falconer have given
them all had she the means!</p>

<p>How she would bloom and glow even now if some of this "luck" she
had been waiting for all her life came her way at last.</p>

<p>"Toby is very fond of Sophie," she continued. "I've often
wondered if it wasn't to be him, after all&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She saw a good deal of him during the War?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;how long ago the War seems!"</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; II</p>

<p>The War&mdash;how long ago indeed, and how little difference it
had made to any one of them; it was so vast it had simply passed
over their heads like a huge waterfall over the sight-seers
beneath.</p>

<p>Lucie had been chained to her work, her husband, the coming and
going of the baby. Mrs. Falconer had "hunted for jobs" for which
she was too old, Sophie had "picked up" officers who had danced
with her, and written to her and taken her out and disappeared and
worked in a remount stable just long enough to be photographed in a
Stetson hat and breeches and "wangle" this picture into the press
with the caption <i>"famous young singer working in the common
cause";</i> everything had been difficult and agitating and
nightmarish, high prices pinched and Lucie's work wasn't so well
paid and they all talked a great deal about the wonderful things
that were just going to happen to them&mdash;<i>"when the War broke
out, my dear, and there was an end of that!"</i> Mrs. Falconer
called herself one of the "new poor" and Sophie threatened a
decline if Simon Kaye was killed.</p>

<p>But being a wealthy young business man who knew how to "wangle"
as well as Sophie did herself, this adored object never got nearer
danger than Hounslow, rather to Lucie's secret regret.</p>

<p>And so they had gone on, talking, talking, sometimes cheering,
sometimes crying, shaken by scares, exalted by patriotic outbursts.
And then it was over and hadn't really made any difference; life
was the same combat among snatching desperate hoards.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; III</p>

<p>Sophie returned.</p>

<p>She was sullen and out of humour, but smiling a little because
Lucie had seen her with an admirer.</p>

<p>Lucie had to make cocoa; they drank this and ate "the remains of
the tea" and talked about nothing, just a vague flow of emotional
words from Mrs. Falconer and Sophie's short answers and Lucie's sad
interjections.</p>

<p>Then they "cleared up" again and put out the gas and went out
into the winter evening, putting on old wraps and bits of fur not
fit to see the daylight, for it was very cold.</p>

<p>Lucie saw her aunt and cousin into a Richmond bus and then
turned to wait for hers which stopped a little higher up the High
Street.</p>

<p>She was thankful to be alone though her thoughts were poor
company.</p>

<p>It was difficult to be serene when your life fell ruined about
you, when everything round you seemed so out of proportion,
distorted, grotesque, when the whole fabric of which you formed
part of the pattern seemed to you pulled awry in its very warp and
woof.</p>

<p>And Lucie was not of a soured or gloomy nature, there was
nothing in her of the reformer or crazy idealist; she was easily
pleased and thought the world a wonderful place.</p>

<p>It was just that she was an ordinary woman wanting ordinary
things and therefore she was out of tune with her time, her
environment, her "set."</p>

<p>She knew, quite well, that her soul was sick, and she thought
that every woman she knew must have the same secret malady
of&mdash;"nonfulflment." Yes, whether they blustered or drooped,
were gay or melancholy, these swarms of unmated or wrongly mated
women, "emancipated," "free," with their "careers," were just like
diseased fruit, full of bitter dust round the withered core. Bus
after bus passed Lucie as she stood on the curb and she took no
notice of them.</p>

<p>How to discern behind all this the universal pattern?</p>

<p>How to feel it all temporary and fleeting and preserve your
calm, your dignity&mdash;to find your womanhood not quite
worthless, not utterly unwanted?</p>

<p>Sacrifice&mdash;this was supposed to be the salve for spiritual
aches.</p>

<p>But Lucie had nothing to sacrifice.</p>

<p>"Inly this freedom, this dreadful freedom that I don't value at
all."</p>

<p>She walked on, not in the direction of Chelsea.</p>

<p>There was that letter to answer; she might send a cable; the
Strand Post Office was open till very late; all night, she thought.
Quickly, for all her fatigue, she turned along Knightsbridge; her
walk was of a noticeable grace and several people turned to look at
her; at Sloane Street she took a bus and sat in the far corner,
conning over the words of her wire.</p>

<p>What message could she send him that would reassure and help
him?</p>

<p>She did not like to think of him as ill; she shuddered to think
that he might die; the death of the baby had given her a horror of
all death.</p>

<p>But he was not likely to die; he had always been very nervous
about himself, making a great "fuss" about his health; she wished
he had stayed in Sicily with his relations; who could be looking
after him in Tuscany?</p>

<p>Of course his relatives expected her to go out to him; she knew
what they understood by the word "wife."</p>

<p>And as the bus spun heavily through the empty stretch of
Piccadilly, Lucie admitted to herself that this was about what she
would do, and what she had known she would do, from the moment she
opened her husband's letter.</p>

<p>She would go out and fetch him back and try again to make some
sort of a home for him, or, if he was really ill, to see that he
was properly nursed; it would not make any difference to anyone.
Mrs. Falconer and Sophie would not like it, but all they really
wanted from her was the money and she would see that they got that
just the same; she had thought that there was nothing for her to
sacrifice but there was&mdash;her peace and comfort, the even
passage of the days; she knew that she could, if she wanted to,
earn her living and look after her husband as well; she was indeed
so used to standing alone, with the full financial responsibility
of other people on her shoulders, that this did not trouble her at
all; there was some money at the bank, some more coming in.</p>

<p>She would go to Italy.</p>

<p>There did not appear to Luck anything heroic in this decision;
heroic things had never come her way; she was acting on the
dictates of a sense of duty.</p>

<p>It was curious how many senses Lucie had, for she had never been
taught or trained in any ethics or morals; yet deep rooted in her
soul were these instincts, convictions, ideals of honour and
chastity, duty and sacrifice.</p>

<p>Often she wondered at them herself for she had grown up in an
atmosphere where such things were simply unknown.</p>

<p>Yet Lucie knew of them and cherished them passionately, if
secretly.</p>

<p>Sophie called her narrow-minded and Mrs. Falconer said she must
have inherited a "nonconformist conscience" from some forgotten
ancestor.</p>

<p>And Lucie, though a free-thinker, really did admire
nonconformity and all it stood for.</p>

<p>She left the bus at the plinth of Nelson's column and crossed
Trafalgar Square to the old-fashioned, dowdy Post Office that seems
so jostled and overshadowed by the buildings and the buses and the
scurrying crowds.</p>

<p>A cold wind whistled up from the river, cutting up the heavy
length of Northumberland Avenue, and there were not very many
people about; along the corner railing fluttered a row of newspaper
placards with stabbing headlines&mdash;an indecent divorce case, a
brutal murder, a political crisis, a free insurance scheme, the
likeness of a woman smudged in printers' ink, lifted and dropped by
the indifferent gusts of the wind from the sea.</p>

<p>Lucie turned into the electric glare of the post office; it was
full of people and all looked tired; the floor was littered and
acrid dust filled the nostrils; a shabby woman with a baby stood in
front of Lucie at the telegraph form desk; as she scrawled her
message the child was sick, dribbled a bit of stale milk over the
mother's cheap but "smart" coat, blinked its dull eyes, as if in
hopeless appeal at the pitiless radiance of the electric light.</p>

<p>"I wish I didn't notice these things," thought Lucie.</p>

<p>She wrote her cable.</p>

<br>

<p class="telegram">COMING AT ONCE. WRITING. LOVE. LUCIE.</p>

<br>

<p>And handed it to the tired clerk who impassively ticked off the
words, as he must have ticked off so many thousands of words,
frivolous or dangerous or vital.</p>

<p>The act of sending this cable strengthened Lucie and gave her a
certain sense of stability, gave an order to her motives and
actions. She was a wife going abroad to fetch a sick husband home;
she tried to make that real to herself&mdash;to cling to this fact
as to a sheet anchor.</p>

<p>When she left the post office, the people were coming out of the
theatres, and the cold streets were full of clash and hubbub,
racing taxis and gorged buses, women in evening dress bending
before the wind as they darted for the openings in the
Underground.</p>

<p>Lucie remembered then how late she had sent her cable off and
how annoyed Pio would be to be knocked up at night for it; she
often did this foolish sort of thing and she felt vexed as she
hurried homewards.</p>

<p>There was very little chance of a bus now so she walked.</p>

<p>This part of London was very familiar to her; several years of
her childhood had been spent in lodgings in a street off St.
Martin's Lane, and the Free Library there had been her University;
she had educated herself by means of the books there, and she was
more cultured than most women she met for she had been a very
studious and industrious child.</p>

<p>Opulent motorcars passed her, flooded with pearl-coloured light,
occupied by women richly dressed in entrancing arrangements of fur
and feather, lace and velvet. It really did seem to Lucie, as she
trudged along, that the vulgar idea, that life was a fairy tale to
these people, had much foundation.</p>

<p>Yet that she could have used her own gifts and looks to climb
into affluence with, had never occurred to her; apart from
everything else, there was a shyness, a timidity, a reserve about
her nature that would never permit her to make a "bid" for anything
of worldly value.</p>

<p>By the arcades of the huge hotel where Peter Sackett had given
his mournful dinner yesterday, she managed to scramble into a bus,
crowded of course with women, haggard, adorned, excited, talkative
after their evening's entertainment.</p>

<p>How tired Lucie's eyes were of faces, how tired her ears were of
voices&mdash;how sick she was of this drag into and out of buses,
the dust and the mud, the press, the perpetual movement, the
indifference, the apathy, the fatigue, the false excitement, given
off by the swarms of people and poisoning the air.</p>

<p>How she dreaded the blast and chatter of that journey to Italy,
the discomfort and turmoil and noise of Florence, the coming back
with a sick man; she was so tired&mdash;her whole body shrank from
fatigue as a burnt limb from the flame.</p>

<p>When she reached her flat, she bathed and crept into bed.</p>

<p>There were always dreams.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch7" id="ch7"></a>Chapter Seven</h2>

<p class="cpb">&sect; I</p>

<p>THERE were always dreams.</p>

<p>Lucie, whose reading was as great as her experience was little,
was an adept in dreams; her mind stored with a thousand images
could entertain her with many-coloured fantasies.</p>

<p>Nothing remarkable or romantic had ever happened to Lucie Uden;
she had known no early love-affairs, no lover had ever kissed her
save her husband, she remembered no men as friends, she knew very
little about men; her world had always been overwhelmingly
feminine.</p>

<p>But she had her dreams of heroes and giants, austere and stately
males, gravely intent on noble works, haughty and cold save to one
woman's kiss, unresponsive save to one woman's embrace. Between
sleeping and waking, or wholly asleep, did not much magnificence
hover round Lucie Uden's dreams as if the triple Hecate,
mysterious, awful, had risen from the moonbeam of some silent pool
to shake her inverted torches over this lonely woman's solitary
pillow?</p>

<p>To-night, drugged by fatigue, she lay very still while the
common images of the day were effaced from her memory and reality
faded into the magic realms of sleep over which so many strange
gods preside.</p>

<p>In this kingdom how many riches may one possess!&mdash;how many
glorious sights behold!</p>

<p>A procession of white camels wearing scarlet laced with gold,
marching across burning silver sand to some vast, wonderful,
monstrous city where kings feasted and slaves toiled, Susa,
Persepolis, Samarkand, Delhi, Memphis or Babylon.</p>

<p>A vase of white alabaster, warm-coloured, traced with the gold
lines of a faint pattern, filled with vivid oranges, and long hard
pink grapes, and thick twisted vine tendrils, and cloven peaches
soft with silver bloom, and over all trails of jasmine with tiny
dark foliage and white roses, perfectly curling perfect petals
about the secret heart.</p>

<p>And now a jungle where the great grasses grow high, high above
the head, their spear-like points starred with angry flowers,
purple scarlet, aware, agape, and overhead in the torrid blue,
unknown birds swirling while you press on, twisting between the
grave stones until you find IT, the great idol, mountain high,
squatting in the depths of silence, staring down with inhuman eyes,
lit by the rays of the million jewels IT wears. And then orchards
blossoming to the verge of the sea, casting a chift of petals on
the quiver of the summer wavelets and a boat moored to one of the
dipping boughs where you might sleep&mdash;so long!&mdash;and never
wake to sorrow.</p>

<p>And again, an old, old monk smiling in a cell and all the walls
dreamed away and thousands of stars sailing in to hear him play on
two reed pipes.</p>

<p>With horse and man the armies gather, shaking the earth from
Asia into Greece, denting the plains of Africa by weight of
armaments, staining the waters of the Hellespont with reflections
of their glory, hordes, hordes swarming round their kings, robed
and crowned and eager for their prey!</p>

<p>Oh, windy moors and storm-blown skies, and rocky cities circled
by ancient walls, and open seas unflecked by foam, and little
islands like lily-buds, close as if one stem bore them all, and
wide roads leading to imperial gates, and sunny chambers inhabited
by peace and overlooking fields clouded by innumerable flowers, may
I not in my dreams visit you all and be content?</p>

<h2><a name="ch8" id="ch8"></a>Chapter Eight</h2>

<p class="cpb">&sect; I</p>

<p>LUCIE, with a secretiveness alien to her nature, but which she
felt in this case to be very necessary, did not tell anyone of her
project.</p>

<p>She arranged her business and her money, got her passport,
packed her bags and bought her ticket before she said anything to
Mrs. Falconer.</p>

<p>Her husband had replied to her wire and letter accepting, as a
matter of course, her consent to come out to him; he said he would
meet her at Turin and enclosed a long list of medicines she was to
bring out.</p>

<p>Lucie wrote again&mdash;a page of arguments for his return to
England&mdash;and she prepared the flat as well as she could for
his arrival; she had it for another six months and they would have
to manage with that for the present.</p>

<p>Her little moment of exultation when she had made her resolve to
go, had soon faded and she felt utterly dispirited and tired; the
fact that her husband would be able to meet her at Turin proved to
her that he was not really very ill and she dreaded meeting him
again and listening to his lamentations and wild schemes which she
would have to discourage while trying to be compassionate and
kind.</p>

<p>And perhaps he would resist the idea of returning to England; he
had never been anything but difficult.</p>

<p>The Sunday afternoon she went to the studio to tell Mrs.
Falconer and Sophie, she found Mrs. Bearish there, chattering in
the bitter yet careless way she did when in fairly good
spirits.</p>

<p>She was complaining of her daughter Aurora, who despite all her
efforts was still unmarried, and who had had so many "little" love
affairs with "queer" men that she was really now "licked bread and
butter."</p>

<p>Sophie was on the divan with a novel and a headache and Mrs.
Falconer smoked and listened and was very charming and
sympathetic.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Bearish had gone, Sophie went to the piano and sang
odd bits of music; she never seemed to know anything right through;
and when this was over, Lucie told her aunt that she was starting
for Italy on the Friday&mdash;"to fetch Pio home."</p>

<p>Mrs. Falconer disapproved&mdash;utterly.</p>

<p>"Why can't he come alone?"</p>

<p>"He is really ill."</p>

<p>"Nonsense! Rubbish! You must not dream of going."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I've made up my mind already&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If anyone must go, send Sophie, she wants a change."</p>

<p>"It is too much to ask of her," said Lucie, who knew that her
husband loathed Sophie, with whom he had often violently
quarrelled, "it is my job, really."</p>

<p>"I suppose you want to go," sneered Sophie. "You always liked
Italy."</p>

<p>"No, I don't want to go," returned Lucie, with some feeling. "I
don't want anything, I'm very tired&mdash;but I feel I ought to
go."</p>

<p>"And expect us to praise you for doing something heroic, I
suppose?" said Mrs. Falconer, with that cruelty she was always
ready to show to Lucie.</p>

<p>"I feel I ought to go," repeated Pio's wife dully.</p>

<p>Sophie picked up her novel as if the conversation bored her, and
Mrs. Falconer talked violently about Lucie's marriage, any
marriage, Pio, his people, all foreigners, with powerful choice of
words and deep inflections of scorn.</p>

<p>Lucie's heart burned, but she was used to sitting patiently
under her aunt's invective, well schooled not to answer back.</p>

<p>"I feel I should go," she repeated at length. "He is my
husband," she added.</p>

<p>At this, as if in sullen displeasure, Sophie flung out of the
room into the closet, banging the door after her.</p>

<p>And Mrs. Falconer smoked in silence as if Lucie had said
something very silly and offensive.</p>

<p>Lucie also sat silent; she was quite sickened by these continual
quarrellings and emotional scenes, confused by them, too; both her
aunt and cousin made her feel as if she was in the wrong.</p>

<p>It was difficult, too, to defend her marriage, and perhaps her
resolve to go to Italy did seem pretentious and
priggish&mdash;perhaps it was mere convention and worn-out
tradition guiding her action.</p>

<p>Faintly she tried to justify herself to her aunt's angry
silence.</p>

<p>"You see," she said, "I don't really much care for this London
life&mdash;I'm afraid I'm one of the women on whom a career has
been rather wasted&mdash;you know what I would rather have had,"
she added with difficulty. "No one wants me here&mdash;I might as
well go to Italy."</p>

<p>"Of course, my dear girl," said Mrs. Falconer acidly. "You will
do exactly as you please&mdash;as you have always done. I don't
pretend to have any authority."</p>

<p>Lucie did not answer; usually, in sheer weakness, she gave in
during these arguments with her aunt, but some instinct (she knew
not what to call it), was urging her to go to her husband,
something far stronger than any lingering pity or affection she
might have felt for Pio.</p>

<p>Only once before had she shown this strength in resisting the
dominant influence of her life, and that was on the occasion of her
marriage.</p>

<p>Mrs. Falconer knew she would not yield now, and the two women
parted, as they had so often parted, in sadness and coldness.</p>

<p>But that was not the end of opposition for Lucie.</p>

<p>Sophie, the next day, came and lectured her on the "pain and
distress you are causing my mother" and everyone to whom Mrs.
Falconer mentioned her journey (Lucie herself would not speak of
it) quite frankly laughed at her; there didn't seem to be a woman
of their acquaintance who approved of Lucie Uden's resolve.</p>

<p>And Lucie, during the last days of her stay in London, felt
lashed by scourges of scorn and hostile criticism.</p>

<p>"I wish I felt more like a free, liberated, emancipated woman,"
she thought, "and not so dreadfully desirous of someone, something
to shelter behind."</p>

<p>Mrs. Falconer veered to a distressed affection more hard to
resist than her anger.</p>

<p>"Mind, you are to come straight back, whatever Pio says or
does&mdash;you can't possibly nurse him&mdash;and mind, if he is
ill, you are to put him into a nursing home the moment you get
back&mdash;you control the money."</p>

<p>And then she would wander off about Sophie and her mysterious
love affair, and the last intrigue to catch the attention of Simon
Kaye, who, inflated by money as a balloon by air, was ever floating
further away above their heads.</p>

<p>Lucie paid over about half the money she had in the Bank, gave
them the use of her flat while she was away, and presented Sophie
with a few evening frocks, thus salving her conscience and
placating their discontents.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; II</p>

<p>And so, on a bitter iron-gray morning in February, a nervous,
tired, rather shabby young woman was among the passengers on the
boat-train from Charing Cross, having two small valises as her sole
luggage, and her passport, money and ticket pinned inside her
dress, after the manner of timid female travellers.</p>

<p>She was now no longer to be considered as Lucie Uden, the quite
well-known designer and illustrator, but Signora Lucia Simonetti,
Italian subject, returning to her country and her husband.</p>

<p>She wore a serge dress, a poney skin coat, a wine-coloured felt
hat and veil, suede gloves and shoes; the ugliness of these clothes
depressed her, yet she was used to clothes both ugly and cheap.</p>

<p>She felt herself so little, so inadequate, so foolish, so
unwanted&mdash;so old compared to the pretty women she saw
travelling with her, escorted, fussed over; she never expected that
kind of thing, she had never had it, nor was she in the least
envious or jealous, but she felt very self-conscious, lonely and
"unwanted."</p>

<p>Mrs. Falconer had wept when she had said "goodbye," and Lucie
wept now, gazing out of the window of the train, to think of her;
but by staying she could have "done no good."</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; III</p>

<p>A sense of exhilaration at the sight of the gray tossing sea,
the long curved arm of the harbour, the waiting boat, the scurry of
porters, officials and sailors&mdash;the sight of your own
coastline, of a few swooping gulls, of the juicy dusters of seaweed
round the iron piers of the steps&mdash;the smell of the sea and
the rain&mdash;the sense of a voyage, of transition, of all common
daily things having stopped like a run-down clock; the cold
pinching you, the wind dragging at your hair and clothes, the rain
slashing your face&mdash;yet a sense of the eternal in all these
things and you one with the eternal!</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; IV</p>

<p>Long discomfort of railway travelling, a dash across a city
looking alien, more travelling in a rocking tearing train, sleeping
huddled up with a green shade drawn over the electric light, waking
to hear the "clink, clink" of axes testing the wheels, throat and
nose dry from steam heating, blasts of damp cutting air when you
opened the window, waking cramped, touzled, dirty, "tidying"
yourself as best you could, pitched into the restaurant car to
drink bitter coffee and eat reheated rolls in common with people as
soiled, as absorbed, as queer as you felt yourself; pitched back to
your seat to stare out of the window at rain, rain, across the
fields of France, heavy with headache and stiff with cramp, sick of
the commonplace yet grotesque folk among whom you had spent so many
hours, clutching your money, your ticket, your passport&mdash;so
into Italy, so into the station, cavernous, iron, dirt, vile smells
of Turin.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; V</p>

<p>Lucie climbed out of the train, a fellow passenger handed down
the two valises, she stood with them at her feet, staring down the
length of the huge covered station; on the roof the rain drummed
steadily.</p>

<p>She could not see her husband.</p>

<p>The train roared away.</p>

<p>Lucie felt isolated, ready to cry. Supposing he was not able to
come?</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; VI</p>

<p>She saw him coming down towards her, leaning on a stick.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch9" id="ch9"></a>Chapter Nine</h2>

<p class="cpb">&sect; I</p>

<p>LUCIE recognized him by the heavy blue overcoat he wore and the
long thick Jaegar scarf wound about his throat; both garments were
familiar to her; his face she would hardly have known.</p>

<p>She felt shaken by nervous embarrassment; the man was like a
stranger; she tried to force herself to seem natural.</p>

<p>"I hope we are not late&mdash;have you been waiting long?"</p>

<p>"I thought you would have come sooner," he said, and kissed her
without a smile. "I have been waiting here two days."</p>

<p>His voice was queer, rasping and yet fluting; he looked so
terribly ill that her frightened gaze turned from his face; he
leant heavily on his stick as if he really needed support.</p>

<p>"Where are the papers for your luggage?"</p>

<p>"I have only these."</p>

<p>"Why?" his face expressed instant annoyance.</p>

<p>"I thought we would go back at once," said Lucie. "You got my
letter?"</p>

<p>"Yes. But I'm not going back. Your climate kills me."? porter
had her valises now and they were walking out of the station.</p>

<p>"I think you ought to come back," said Lucie wearily. "Please
do, Pio."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Falconer has been persuading you," he returned angrily.
"Of course I shall not come, <i>Dio Cristo!</i> I should never have
been allowed to come alone&mdash;have suffered from it."</p>

<p>"You said you were so much better."</p>

<p>"I am, much better. But still I am not quite well. I want a
little care, good food and peace&mdash;what? never get in
these hotels."</p>

<p>"Where are you staying?" asked Lucie.</p>

<p>"Opposite." His breath whistled in gasps, he was walking at a
crawl. "The big hotel. To-morrow we will go to Viareggio."</p>

<p>"Viareggio?"</p>

<p>"I have taken a house there, where we can be quiet&mdash;the
doctor said&mdash;I was to have sea air."</p>

<p>They stood under the entrance of the station, the rain poured
down steadily; streets, buildings, sky, looked mud-coloured; a
sharp wind from the Alps drove the rain, using it as a weapon to
slash and drive at houses and people.</p>

<p>"I hate this place," said Pio.</p>

<p>Slowly they crossed the wet piazza, followed by the porter, and
passed the glass doors of the hotel and into the lift.</p>

<p>Porter and liftman looked at him anxiously; he seemed absorbed
in some secret trouble and not to notice anything.</p>

<p>Luck, acutely self-conscious, saw the glances and shivered.</p>

<p>There were more glances from the chamber maid as Pio asked her
to see that tea was brought up to their room.</p>

<p>"He is very ill," thought Lucie, and she was horribly
afraid.</p>

<p>When he had first written to her that he was ill, she had had
the swift thought&mdash;"if he dies, I shall be really free," now
she was as frightened as if she had greatly loved him; shocked as
well as frightened, for she had ceased to think seriously of the
question of his health; he had been always ailing and sickly; but
now surely he was in the grip of something fatal.</p>

<p>Still wearing his heavy overcoat and muffler and holding his
light gray felt hat on his knee, he sat silent, staring in front of
him.</p>

<p>Lucie had not expected any display of affection or gratitude;
she was used to his acceptance of her utmost with no hint of
acknowledgment; but he had remained, according to his nature, "in
love" with her, and her presence had never before failed to evoke
from him a certain emotion of pleasure and excitement.</p>

<p>But now he was utterly listless.</p>

<p>Lucie sat by the window; she felt giddy, as if she was still in
the rushing train, stiff and constrained as if she was still
crushed in a narrow space with a crowd of strangers, bewildered and
aching in all her faculties and limbs.</p>

<p>The room was large and very clean, furnished with the light
Austrian wood pieces, immaculate linen covered the bed, the long
glass in the wardrobe gleamed spotless; the window opened into a
tiny balcony; it was very high up; the piazza with the tram
terminus, the station, the converging streets, looked like the
lines of a map dotted with minute figures.</p>

<p>The chamber maid brought up the tea,&mdash;thick white china,
butter in thin pats, honey in little saucers, rolls and a pot of
tea.</p>

<p>Pio did not move, but as Lucie closed the window through which
the rain was drifting, he motioned to her to leave it
open.</p>

<p>Lucie took off her hat, opened one of her valises and put some
of her things out; she noticed with a furtive eye of dread an array
of medicine bottles on the table by the bed; there was a faint
acrid smell in the room.</p>

<p>Her husband's luggage, expensive trunks, portmanteaux and cases
stood about, looking familiar yet alien; on the dressing-table was
the ivory and silver toilet set she had given him and a gold watch
in a travelling case.</p>

<p>She poured out the tea and was glad to drink the thin fragrant
beverage.</p>

<p>"How long have you been here?" she asked.</p>

<p>"One night."</p>

<p>"You shouldn't have come&mdash;I could have travelled straight
through."</p>

<p>"I wanted to come&mdash;it has been very dull."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;but if you are not feeling very well&mdash;it is a
tiring journey&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am quite well&mdash;almost cured&mdash;only I had a little
fever that pulled me down&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But when you wrote to me&mdash;asking me to come&mdash;you
thought you were worse?"</p>

<p>"I had a nasty turn with a bad cold and the doctor said that I
ought to have someone to look after me&mdash;he said it was most
unfair that I should be left alone&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But, Pio," faltered Lucie, "you went home for your people to
look after you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do not talk of Sicily," he replied fretfully. "I wish the whole
island was at the bottom of the seamy father has become imbecile,
my sister is ill, my brother is impossible, they do nothing but
borrow money, I get no comfort there, no encouragement, no place
even to live in!"</p>

<p>Lucie gazed at the rain which was making a wet patch on the
polished floor.</p>

<p>"Besides," added Pio, "we have been separated long enough. I do
not like this kind of life&mdash;you said you would come out, it is
your aunt prevents you and your friends, they hate me and want to
separate us."</p>

<p>This was true enough, but omitted one important particular;
Lucie was the breadwinner.</p>

<p>"I had work to finish," she said.</p>

<p>"You can work here as well as in England."</p>

<p>"I can't&mdash;really&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I will not come back to England&mdash;the doctor says I must
have the sun."</p>

<p>"Who is he, this doctor?"</p>

<p>"Dr. Villari very good, I think he understands my
case&mdash;besides I have taken this house&mdash;and our tickets
for tomorrow."</p>

<p>Lucie knew that to argue further would be to provoke violence;
she drank her tea while he lay back in his chair as if exhausted by
so much talking.</p>

<p>Pio Simonetti was a Sicilian, about thirty years old, of pure
inbred race, from an old and decaying family long resident in a
hill town more ancient than Rome.</p>

<p>He was tall, always too slender, handsome in a dark hawk-like
fashion, with the fine eyes and sweeping brows so usual in the
South, thick waving hair, coarsely modelled nose and lips and a
sallow dull complexion.</p>

<p>In the four months since Lucie had seen him he had changed
considerably; he was now so thin that all the hollows and contours
of his skull were visible, the skin hung flaccid in a double circle
under each eye, the hair was thinning on the temples and sprinkled
with white, the full lips were of a bluish colour and painfully
compressed.</p>

<p>"I will now take a rest," he said and rose as if with an
effort.</p>

<p>As he moved he began to cough.</p>

<p>He sat down again and continued coughing.</p>

<p>Lucie was used to his cough but she had never seen anything like
this; he beat the air convulsively, he writhed, he twisted, in
torture, the sweat stood on his forehead; he motioned to Lucie to
give him one of the medicines on the bedside table; she did not
know which to give as they were all different from those he had
used at home, but she gave him a glass of water from the wash
stand, and the paroxysm subsided in a gasp of whispered curses.</p>

<p>In silence she helped him out of his coat and muffler and on to
the bed; he was handsomely, even extravagantly dressed; he had
never spared money on his clothes and his personal appointments.
Propped up on one elbow, he poured himself out a dose from one of
the bottles ready.</p>

<p>"I am always to have these," he whispered, "when I cough. It is
nerves&mdash;my lungs are quite sound&mdash;the doctor says
so."</p>

<p>He sank back, panting, on the large clean pillow.</p>

<p>"And that 'sirop'&mdash;the red&mdash;I take two tablespoonfuls
at five and they will bring up some eggs and Marsala which I take
soon after to keep my strength up."</p>

<p>"Very well," said Lucie.</p>

<p>She went and sat down by the window trying to recollect her
wits; Pio was very soon in a heavy, and, as it seemed to Lucie, an
unnatural sleep.</p>

<p>It was clear he was very ill; even her ignorance could see that;
also it was obvious he was set against a return to England.</p>

<p>He had even undertaken liabilities as to a house, doctors, etc.,
that she would be able to pay off; there seemed to be nothing for
it but for her to at least go to Viareggio and see this doctor and
find out the truth.</p>

<p>It did not besides seem to her that he had the strength for the
journey to England&mdash;perhaps he would gain this
shortly&mdash;or perhaps he was daily becoming worse.</p>

<p>Anyhow he claimed her, expected, exacted her services and time,
her presence and assistance as well as her money, and she did not
see how she could repudiate these claims&mdash;since he had
quarrelled with his family, he had no one save herself.</p>

<p>She almost smiled to think of the complete selfishness of his
reception of her; not one word had he said of her health, her
comfort, her journey, her possible fatigue.</p>

<p>Yet against this she tried to put the effort he had made in
coming to Turin, and to the station, the care he had taken with his
appearance&mdash;she supposed anyone who was ill was selfish.</p>

<p>Rising wearily she went to look at him as he slept.</p>

<p>She knew now, beyond any shadow of doubt, that she cared nothing
for him, was not even interested in him; this sudden sight of him,
this realization of his ill-health, had effectively killed any
sparks of sentiment she might have been endeavouring to cherish;
she loathed sickness and this man's malady repelled her absolutely;
she did not feel dislike or contempt, only indifference for the man
and horror for the disease.</p>

<p>As she looked back into the past she felt a blushing amazement
that she had ever been able to cheat herself into taking this man
for any semblance of Love.</p>

<p>He was sunk deep into the pillows, his breath came in hoarse
snores; now and then his limbs twitched under his fashionable
clothes; he had the appearance of utter futility.</p>

<p>Surely he was drugged; Lucie looked at the bottle from which he
had taken his dose; it was labelled <i>"goceie Mafenjie"</i> which
told her nothing.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; II</p>

<p>Lucie washed and changed her frock and felt rested, even
reanimated despite the senseless figure on the bed.</p>

<p>She went again to the window and stepped out; the rain had
almost ceased; the sky was showing a pale washed blue through the
rifts in the watery clouds; a man with a close packed basket of
roses on his back passed below, a faint tremulous indefinable
excitement stirred Lucie.</p>

<p>She could imagine how wonderful it would be to come here, young
and happy, with health and love for company...she would have liked
to go out and see the strange famous town, which she did not know
at all; but he had asked for his medicine at five&mdash;and might
wake before and miss her. He always displayed his fiercest jealousy
of her slightest independent action.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; III</p>

<p>Again Lucie reminded herself that she was absolutely free; she
lived in an age of feminine "emancipation"; there was hardly any
length of freedom to which women might not go, she was able to earn
her own living, and there was not only no one with any authority
over her, but no one who had any right whatsoever to offer her
advice.</p>

<p>And those most interested in her affairs, Mrs. Falconer, Sophie,
her few friends, would certainly absolutely applaud her in any
assertion of independence she chose to make.</p>

<p>She could hardly exaggerate the extent of her own freedom;
whatever course seemed best to her own judgment she might securely
take.</p>

<p>And she knew perfectly well what was the obviously sensible and
prudent thing for her to do&mdash;perhaps also the wisest and
kindest&mdash;that was to refuse to listen to anything Pio might do
or say and insist on his return to England and his entry into a
good nursing home; if she did this, and saw that he was well
treated and paid for him out of her own not too easily earned
money, she knew that everyone would consider that she was behaving
quite well, even generously.</p>

<p>Or, if he was quite obdurate about this course, she could give
him a small sum of money and let him return to Sicily, or drift
about Italy, as he wished, while she went home and resumed her own
life.</p>

<p>And why, in resuming that life, should she submit again to that
other tyranny of Mrs. Falconer and Sophie?</p>

<p>There also, there was no real obligation on her, over and over
again she had repaid anything she might have owed for being just
barely clothed and scarcely fed and not in the least educated;
since she was sixteen she had earned rather more than her
own keep and everything she knew she had taught herself, with
hardly encouragement. Why, therefore, did she not cut herself free
from both Mrs. Falconer and Pio and live her own life free from
emotional entanglements&mdash;really, her own life, at last.</p>

<p>There were so many things she would have liked to do that
she had never been able to dream of doing&mdash;yet things
that were quite in her power to do, if she could only have stood
upright, given herself room to move.</p>

<p>Travel, for instance, and leisure for her work, and some beauty
of surrounding and adornment. But what was the use?</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; IV</p>

<p>What was the use of talking of freedom for women, when the sheer
fact of your sex trippled you every time?</p>

<p>Lucie always came back to that.</p>

<p>You weren't free, you simply couldn't be free, when all the
instincts of your nature (instincts how strong, how terrible!) were
driving you to find a mate, and the only way for you to secure this
mate was marriage, an institution but ill adapted for the
independent woman.</p>

<p>And what was the use of freedom if you weren't trained to use
it?&mdash;if, from generations of enclosed women, you had inherited
the wish to be enclosed and protected&mdash;if you hated to stand
alone and be free&mdash;simply made a mess of it, if you tried.</p>

<p>And this without being a fool or a dinging sentimental
coquette&mdash;but a creature intelligent enough to know
yourself.</p>

<p>Intelligent enough to know that you, as a woman, because you
were a woman, never could be really free, because of your nerves,
and your emotions, and your physical weaknesses, your lack of
mental stability, your desperate need of love.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; V</p>

<p>Lucie looked again at the bed; the sleeping man had never
moved.</p>

<p>How he had trusted her!</p>

<p>He was passing as quite a wealthy man, taking a fashionable
villa, going to expensive doctor after doctor, lending money to his
family&mdash;his clothes costly, all his habits luxurious&mdash;and
without troubling even to be grateful or pleasant, he was quite
certain that she would support him in everything, never mentioning
whose money it was, playing the dutiful wife as if every penny was
his.</p>

<p>And Lucie knew that he had not relied in vain; she knew she
could not go back on him.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; VI</p>

<p>She tried to be very honest and sincere with herself; to think
the problem well out; this man stood for a good dead in her
life.</p>

<p>She had set him up, as the primitive Greeks had set up their
Xoamen, those first formless images of the Gods they worshipped,
rude, with hardly any likeness to a human form, but the best they
could achieve.</p>

<p>But these archaic statues, "handless, footless, eyeless," were
draped in embroidered veils, adorned with boughs of myrtle,
drenched in scented oil and decked with wreaths until they became
beautiful to the gaze of the worshippers.</p>

<p>And Lucie had done the same, since this man must stand for at
least one God to her; she had lavished herself and her money to
disguise and elevate him.</p>

<p>Was it for her, the priestess of this poor altar, to strip the
idol bare and show it for the wretched block of wood it was?</p>

<h2><a name="ch10" id="ch10"></a>Chapter Ten</h2>

<p class="cpb">&sect; I</p>

<p>A WAITER brought up the eggs and Marsala and Lucie roused her
husband, not without difficulty. She had switched on the electric
light and the square of sky in the open window looked the colour
and texture of a violet.</p>

<p>Lucie prepared the eggs; the yolks had to be given in a
tablespoonful of Marsala, the whites cast away.</p>

<p>She broke one yolk (her hands shook from fatigue) and Pio was
angry.</p>

<p>His face was very red and his eyes bloodshot; Lucie was used to
what he called his "feverish attacks."</p>

<p>"We had better have dinner upstairs," she said quietly.
"No&mdash;? have ordered it downstairs," he answered. "I do not
like to be up here&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But you are not? t&mdash;you have, I'm sure, a
temperature."</p>

<p>"I'm quite well," he said petulantly. "It is this wretched cold
pulled me down."</p>

<p>She helped him off the bed; then gave him the <i>"sirop,"</i> a
French patent medicine that was, he declared, doing him great
good.</p>

<p>"Dr. Villari recommended it."</p>

<p>Lucie, glancing at the bottle, saw the stuff was supposed to
cure consumption.</p>

<p>"Do let us have dinner up here, I am tired, too," she said in a
kind of panic.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Falconer might have travelled with you," he said, "to help
you. It will not tire you to come down to the restaurant."</p>

<p>Lucie felt as if it would not only tire but kill her to enter a
public place, under the fire of those alien eyes, with a man so
ill.</p>

<p>But it was, of course, beyond her strength to argue with Pio,
and when he had laboriously and painfully adjusted his dress, they
descended in the lift to the restaurant, which was a large and
fashionable café attached to the hotel, not, as Lucie had hoped, a
quiet dining room.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; II</p>

<p>Under ordinary circumstances, Lucie would have enjoyed the scene
for she was, in her proper disposition, normal and cheerful
minded.</p>

<p>She liked Italy and the Italians; she liked their obvious
characteristics of gaiety and exaggeration, of enthusiasm and
violence, she liked their <i>"parradre,"</i> the flair they had for
making life a picturesque and brilliant business&mdash;on the
surface at least.</p>

<p>The large room was crowded; the lights were very bright, the
talk very noisy, a considerable orchestra, on a raised platform,
turned over their music in an interval between the swaggering
melodies.</p>

<p>The company was predominately male; the hordes of women that
bewildered and depressed in England, were (as yet) absent in Italy;
Lucie had always noted this, and that it gave the country a virile,
assured, straightforward air, perhaps wholly false to the real
character of the people.</p>

<p>But there it was, very definitely, that sense of masculinity,
jolly eating and drinking of hearty meals, loud martial music,
brisk swaggerings, bold oglings and unabashed stares, much
flaunting and self-assurance on the part of a sex obviously
predominant that could still afford to be courteous and tender
towards women that still had leisure (plenty) to make love.</p>

<p>Lucie liked men; the one she had married was the only one who
had loved her; she had no male friends, but a great many
acquaintances and there were a great many more, not even
acquaintances, whom she met daily, at home, in the course of her
business. And she found them all kind, pleasant and decent
folk.</p>

<p>Man as a wolfish pursuer, man as a leering satyr, man as a
"beast," she had never seen. She knew of course that he must exist,
because she had heard so much of him from other women, but for
herself he had never come her way; she had found men invariably
nice, frank and helpful.</p>

<p>Whenever she had told Mrs. Falconer or Sophie this, they had
hinted that it was because she was a plain woman.</p>

<p>Lucie was quite prepared to believe them, but she could not help
thinking from the viewpoint of her own experience.</p>

<p>And she liked to talk to men because they always kept to such
wholesome topics&mdash;when you got alone with a woman she nearly
always talked of things you didn't like&mdash;always sex.</p>

<p>Sometimes woman giggled, sometimes she laughed, or preached, or
lamented, or gossiped, but the subject was always the
same&mdash;sex.</p>

<p>Often she said ghastly things&mdash;sometimes, if she was young
and pretty, she was charming about it; sometimes, she was quite
hideous; but it was always sex.</p>

<p>And Lucie wasn't interested in sex as sex at all.</p>

<p>Therefore she always preferred the company of men, or gatherings
where there were men present to keep the women in check.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; III</p>

<p>The café was surrounded by huge plate glass windows giving on
the street; on them the rain drops gleamed; people came and went
quickly through the four-fold door; the place was steam-heated,
stuffy and stale; a great number of the men were in uniform, gay
jovial fellows in the gray or blue cloaks, high collars and tight
tunics of the infantry and artillery, with handsome faces and fine
figures, noisy, swaggering, charming, but too often with the
flushed cheeks and pouched eyes of debauchery. The umbrella stand
was full of swords, the pegs above laden with peaked caps, waiters
hurried to and fro with cries of <i>"vengo!"</i> carrying heaped
dishes of savoury food and baskets of fruits and straw-coloured
<i>"fiaschi."</i></p>

<p>Lucie and her husband took their seats at a little table near
the entrance to the hotel; she was so heartened by the cheerful
humanity of the scene that her thoughts went from the sick man and
she forgot her fatigue.</p>

<p>The waiter was pouring <i>"asti-spumante"</i> into her glass and
the orchestra began to play Ernani.</p>

<p>Lucie's blood bounded; she felt it all worth while; the music
took her spirit up with a rush; it was all worth while&mdash;even
to be in trouble, in difficulties.</p>

<p>She looked round at the other women there, a few middle-class
wives, robust and hearty, a few <i>cantatrice</i> with the
officers, good humouredly and straight-forwardly painted hussies,
knowing their job well, with no pretence of knowing anything else,
each type of woman, in her different way, happy and at ease.</p>

<p>Lucie wished that her life had fallen on some conventional lines
of virtue or vice; how easy, how untormented by problems might one
live in some definite estate mapped out by one's forbears, taught
and trained by responsible parents, financed sufficiently to be
able to avoid sharp discomforts, not so much as to have a deceptive
freedom. Supposing now it was Pio who had the money and she was
incapable of earning any&mdash;it would all have been so
simple!</p>

<p>It was this standing alone and deciding for oneself that was so
terrible.</p>

<p>The orchestra swept into the famous quartette&mdash;Paulo
Quinto.</p>

<p>Such music always moved Lucie, she had never outgrown the thrill
of martial melody, of swinging verve, of any call to noble deeds;
in many ways she was very simple, she was almost piteously eager to
respond to any heroic emotion. Gazing at the orchestra she saw her
own reflection in the glass beyond them, pale, with the bright hair
piled on the top of her head, and the mouse-coloured dress; and she
saw Pio's profile and the way he was bending over his plate.</p>

<p>Sharply she turned from the reflection to the reality; he had
eaten nothing, his fallen face expressed utter woe and
suffering.</p>

<p>"Take some wine," said Lucie faintly.</p>

<p>He emptied his full glass, but with an effort; he complained
feebly about the food, the cooking; her appetite was gone also; she
could eat no more; the music ceased; nothing but noisy talk filled
the room.</p>

<p>Pio leant back in his chair; Lucie thought his countenance
hardly human; she deliberately drank another glass of wine in the
hope that it would dull her senses.</p>

<p>Several people were looking at them; she caught the word,
<i>"moribundo."</i></p>

<p>Supposing he began to cough, supposing he fainted.</p>

<p>The publicity of the position was agony to her nerves always
super&mdash;sensitive; she had even more than the usual English
dread of anything in the nature of a public scene.</p>

<p>"Shall we go upstairs?" she asked.</p>

<p>She tried to think it courage and to admire him for it, but
inwardly she raged against his crass selfishness that could never,
never consider her point of view.</p>

<p>Her overwrought mind raced round all sorts of horrible
possibilities&mdash;supposing they were asked to leave the hotel,
supposing he collapsed in the train to&mdash;morrow?</p>

<p>Food was put before them and taken away untouched. Pio asked for
brandy, and drank it neat.</p>

<p>At last he consented to leave; they were playing a waltz now; he
had to lean on her to get to the door; more people than before
stared at them.</p>

<p>In the lift he began to cough, by the time they reached their
room he was choking.</p>

<p>Lucie gave him his drops, gave him water, opened the windows,
waited till the hideous paroxysm had passed.</p>

<p>When he could speak he whispered that he wanted to go to
bed.</p>

<p>Lucie helped him to undress, helped him to drop, exhausted,
gasping, into the large clean bed, and to arrange over his chest
the medicated cotton wool, the wad of flannel, the double fronted
wool vest that he wore at night.</p>

<p>Then he demanded the light out and the night-light lit. Lucie
obeyed and moved about silently, folding up his expensive
clothes.</p>

<p>"Is this consumption?" she thought; she had never heard a
definite name given to his malady; she knew nothing of any
diseases; what she had read of consumption did not tally with this,
she thought.</p>

<p>But she knew enough to know that, if it were, she was running an
almost crazy risk of infection.</p>

<p>She poured some of the powerful disinfectant she had brought
with her into a saucer and stood it in a corner.</p>

<p>Pio was watching her; he cursed as fluently as his cracked voice
would allow.</p>

<p>"What are you doing that for? There is nothing the matter with
me. What will the hotel people think?"</p>

<p>"I might catch your cough," said Lucie quietly.</p>

<p>"You are always thinking of yourself," he muttered.</p>

<p>Lucie smiled; it seemed to her really funny; her sense of humour
helped her a good deal when dealing with Pio.</p>

<p>She threw the disinfectant out on to the balcony; as she did so
she caught a glimpse of the gay town below; people were going out
for the evening, mounting trams, springing into "carriages,"
walking about in the cool wet evening.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; IV</p>

<p>"I'm cold&mdash;cover me up," came Pio's harsh whisper behind
her; she returned to his bedside and found he was shuddering and
shivering as if in an ague; his face was livid and his hand, when
she touched it, stung with icy coldness.</p>

<p>She tucked all the bedclothes round him, she piled on his coat
and her own, and at last every garment he had taken off and still
his teeth chattered; he wanted her to ring for the chambermaid and
ask for more blankets, but she shrank from that; and presently the
fever began to mount and he tossed off all his coverings
frantically; a purple flush gave his face a fleeting likeness of
health; he muttered and twisted and finally slept.</p>

<p>Lucie wanted to cry, but she was too tired, and there was no one
to comfort her if she did; it was only eight o'clock and she was
shut up here for the night&mdash;with nowhere to sleep.</p>

<p>There wasn't even a couch or an easy chair, and she was far too
timid to ask for one. For as long as she could, she sat up by the
open window, in the stiff chair, gazing down at the lighted piazza
and the front of the station; then, when her fatigue was no longer
to be borne, she undressed, put on her thick dressing-gown, wrapped
herself in her travelling-rug and lay down, with a shudder, on the
edge of the bed where the sick man sprawled in his delirious
sleep.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch11" id="ch11"></a>Chapter Eleven</h2>

<p class="cpb">&sect; I</p>

<p>THE train rocked and swayed south, rattling through the
incessant tunnels on the Ligurian coast, skirting the tossing
winter sea.</p>

<p>Lucie sat in a corner of the over-heated dusty carriage; beside
her was the remains of a cold chicken and spotted Sausage in a
grease-proof paper and a little empty bottle of Chianti.</p>

<p>Opposite sat her husband, flushed after his food and in quite
good spirits.</p>

<p>He was already full of plans&mdash;began to discuss them, in his
hoarse voice, which came raspingly to Lucie between the clangings
of the train.</p>

<p>"He is not so ill after all," thought Lucie with relief.</p>

<p>He had passed the entire night in a sleep of stupor, and save
for one coughing fit when he awoke, had seemed notably better
to-day; he had even expressed some pleasure in Lucie's society and
some satisfaction that she was really with him again at last.</p>

<p>"He takes me for granted," thought Lucie dreamily. "He really
thinks that I love him and I am delighted to be here on any
terms."</p>

<p>There was something dreadful and pathetic in this belief of his;
it frightened Lucie.</p>

<p>He told her of the difficulties he had found in securing a
house; at Viareggio it had been hopeless; he had had at last to
take one at Forte dei Marni; Lucie read between the lines of his
narrative that people had been frightened of the state of his
health; he had been asked to leave two hotels in Viareggio "because
of his cough"; Lucie could only wonder how he had contrived to
secure this house he had now taken.</p>

<p>He described it, vaguely, he had no gift of words, and added
that he had engaged Marianna, the servant who had been with them
when they were in Italy before, when he had been for a short time
attached to a Belgian tramway company, and they had lived in Parma,
Naples and Rome.</p>

<p>Twice they had been in Viareggio for a holiday, and on one of
these occasions engaged Marianna, a native of Pietrasanta, who had
moved about with them till the War had driven them back to
England.</p>

<p>She had now, Pio said, left a situation to come back to
them.</p>

<p>This further depressed Lucie; they could not, must not, stay in
Italy, and now there was this further obligation to Marianna!</p>

<p>He had promised her a high wage, too, he seemed to have
absolutely no regard for money.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; II</p>

<p>In and out of the tunnels&mdash;light and the tossing gray
sea&mdash;darkness, foul, full of rushing clang and blast and
clatter, smeared with electric light.</p>

<p>Lucie was stiff and cramped and weary; her mind kept turning
over and over endless anxieties, troubles, problems.</p>

<p>On her knees were some stale English newspapers and magazines
bought at Turin station; they were full of the woman problem and
sex warfare, the claims and clamours of women, women, women,
demanding the right to work, full equality with men in every
direction, the opening of every gate still closed, the removal of
every obstacle that still remained to their complete emancipation;
and in the same papers specious advertisements of paints and
powders and beauty masks and frivolous useless clothes and
jewellery, and a story written by a woman for women where the
heroine struggles ("primitive woman with primitive man") in the
passionate grasp of the brutal villain.</p>

<p>That and the advertisements are the only true things in the
paper, thought Lucie, that is what we are really like&mdash;the
rest is just clap-trap-rot&mdash;humbug.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; III</p>

<p>Lucie put aside the newspapers with disgust; Pio had fallen into
a heavy sleep now, huddled in the corner, there was not even his
poor talk to distract her thoughts.</p>

<p>Everything seemed so far away from the original scheme of things
which was so simple and so direct; the sexes seemed smudged one
into the other, the woman acquiring masculine qualities, the man
aping feminine to please the women who were the majority and had
the most odd shillings and pence to spend&mdash;the men really
hating the women because they were so unwomanly, the women really
despising the men who were giving in to them, all the broad
outlines of sex difference lost, obscured, denied, yet everyone, in
one way or another, secretly centred round sex.</p>

<p>That was why the War had been popular, really; the men had been
men, then, right up in the saddle with the women hanging round
waiting for a glance&mdash;and they had simply loved it; every
unattached woman and a great many who weren't, had enjoyed the
War.</p>

<p>But it was over and there were no more uniforms or bands, or
riotous leaves or farewells or home-comings, no longer any drama or
emotion or excitement in the air.</p>

<p>It was over, blowing down, in its cross-winds, the social fabric
of the moment and over the ruins we all scrambled, hordes, swarms,
swarms...</p>

<p>Lucie had just read the report of a sermon by a woman
preacher&mdash;she made jokes about St. Paul, about her hat, about
the bishops...the wit and daring of it&mdash;in a church too!</p>

<p>They said she was wonderful&mdash;she and the other women
(plenty of them now) who spoke in churches.</p>

<p>But they proved St. Paul right, by their mere presence; as long
as the Church was a Church, the women were silent; when the
Christian religion had become something you had to explain away by
pretending it was something else, when you were ashamed of hell
fire, and apologised for heaven (symbolism, of course, you said,
and how beautiful!) then the females whooped in through the broken
doors and joked over the desecrated shrines, like magpies
chattering over a ruin.</p>

<p>It was quite safe.</p>

<p>Saint Paul was dead.</p>

<p>You could say what you liked about him&mdash;you could be
"funny" about God.</p>

<p>It helped fill the Church.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; IV</p>

<p>It was all disintegrating, the whole of Europe; like the dead
empires of Assyria, of Africa, of Greece and Rome; why not? Why
should we expect to escape?</p>

<p>But it would not be fire from heaven that would bum, or
barbarian hordes who would overwhelm us, but the dry rot from
within&mdash;the rule of the women.</p>

<p>They were beginning to rule.</p>

<p>It was like the Church&mdash;the State was just something you
gassed about at elections and in newspapers&mdash;there wasn't any
patriotism or statesmanship&mdash;the Big Business Men "ran"
Parliament, they "ran" the country, the aristocracy limped behind
them, picking up the crumbs they dropped, marrying them. (Oh! this
blessed institution of marriage whereby titles and money, may
exchange hands so decorously!) The people, while they were
comfortable, didn't bother, and when they weren't so comfortable
made those uneasy movements that caused some sop to be thrown to
Cerberus, some fresh cry yelled from the hustings&mdash;and the Big
Business Men "managed" it all so nicely.</p>

<p>Like a big shop.</p>

<p>Where, of course, no one made any profits.</p>

<p>And now there were the Big Business Women coming along, and they
were going to look after us all, so efficiently.</p>

<p>On the ruins the magpies scolding, and chattering, and flapping
their wings.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; V</p>

<p>Lucie tore the newspapers across and cast them out of the window
as the train cleared a tunnel; a strong wind seized them instantly
and swept them away.</p>

<p>Lucie tried to sleep; Pio was snoring; his head fallen forward,
a purple smear on either cheek-bone; she noticed the thinning of
his wavy hair on top, the premature greyness over the temples, the
way his slight frame struggled with his breath.</p>

<p>So far they had had the carriage to themselves.</p>

<p>At Genoa some people got in, second-class passengers who could
not find room anywhere else.</p>

<p>A family.</p>

<p>The mother sat opposite to Lucie; she had a baby of a few weeks
on her knee, another baby about eighteen months settled beside her,
while the third, a child of three or so, sat on a little cushion at
her feet.</p>

<p>The husband sat in front of her, smiling shyly at them all; the
two babies were soon asleep; the father gave the elder boy
biscuits, carefully wiping his mouth and fingers after each
nibble.</p>

<p>They were middle-class Italians, heavy, handsome, clean and
happy; the children were very beautiful.</p>

<p>The mother in her totally unconscious attitude of repose and
protection formed a picture from which Lucie could hardly take her
eyes; the tiny infant in the white frock lay so comfortable and
placid on her wide knee, the little sister in her cherry-coloured
hood slept so confidingly in the lovely curve of her arm, pillowed
so softly against her soft side, the boy sat so quiet and secure in
the fold of her gown; all were so endearingly like each other, like
her, and like the dark mail who kept smiling at them all.</p>

<p>Lucie shuddered in her bitter misery; how could there be any
doubt that here was the one thing for a woman?</p>

<p>You might miss it, as she had missed it, you might never have a
chance of it&mdash;but that couldn't alter the fact.</p>

<p>Find any woman doctor, lawyer, chemist, engineer, and see what
they look like beside this simple creature and her children.</p>

<p>See how she is made, soft and curved, weak and patient,
especially for this one task, see the little things pressed round
her, happy; see Love, fluid from one to the other, and Beauty, and
more than all, divine Content.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; VI</p>

<p>With the twilight they reached the last station, descended from
the high train, and stood on the long icy platform; the cold took
the breath; the Apennine Mountains, crowned with marble, seemed to
be very near; the cypresses on the hillside were black against the
chill winter sky fading round the intense stars.</p>

<p>A hunch-backed porter took Pio's smart valise and her shabby
bag, Lucie remembered him, she felt so friendless she was pleased
that he remembered her with the cheerful courtesy of the Tuscan
peasant.</p>

<p>A little <i>"carozza"</i> waited for them outside the station;
it was nearly dark and so wintry that no one was abroad.</p>

<p>Pio was shivering now, complaining, coughing, bent over his
stick, his good spirits of the morning were totally gone; when
Lucie spoke to him he was curtly rude.</p>

<p>In great discomfort they rattled and banged in the spring-less
carriage over the abominable road of ruts and stones; it was quite
dark by the time they reached the sea; they drove about a mile
along the belt of pines and a tramline and stopped at a little
wooden gate in the low railing that enclosed the pine trees.</p>

<p>Marianna came running out of the darkness with a lantern; she
greeted Lucie noisily, as if she had seen her yesterday; Pio cursed
her for a fool.</p>

<p>They crossed the belt of pine trees and went into the house.</p>

<p>This was the back entrance and led into the kitchen; it all
seemed very vast and very ill-lit.</p>

<p>The coachman left the valises and was paid; Pio, trembling and
gasping, was helped upstairs by the two women.</p>

<p>He was in a state of collapse; Lucie assisted him into bed, gave
him his drops, waited on him, listened to him, sat still till he
was asleep.</p>

<p>Then crept downstairs.</p>

<p>Marianna was making coffee in the big kitchen, the smell
heartened Lucie; she was half delirious with fatigue. "Where is the
doctor?" she asked.</p>

<p>"He will come to-morrow, Signora."</p>

<p>"What does he say&mdash;do you know?"</p>

<p>"Poor <i>padrone,</i>" answered Marianna, with philosophical
calm. "He cannot live six weeks."</p>

<p>Lucie sat down on the kitchen chair.</p>

<p>"Does he say so&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch12" id="ch12"></a>Chapter Twelve</h2>

<p class="cpb">&sect; I</p>

<p>MARIANNA had the serene, cheerful philosophy of the true
peasant; she was a robust, middle-aged woman, with fine shining
black hair and twinkling eyes, noisy, humorous, vulgar, incredibly
hard-working and faithful.</p>

<p>Lucie had always understood and liked her; to Pio she had been a
continual source of irritation; so Lucie guessed that he had been
desperate when he had turned to her again.</p>

<p>It was quite obvious why she had come; she passionately admired
her <i>"signora"</i> who had before been extravagantly good to her
and her family in the matter of wages and tips and presents.</p>

<p>Lucie, who spoke Italian well, now questioned her as to what she
knew.</p>

<p>It was very little; Martinelli, a poor hanger-on of Pio's, a
general odd job man, had come to her at Marsa where she had had a
place and asked her to come at once to Forte dei Marni where Pio
had just taken this villa.</p>

<p>"How did he get it?" asked Lucie dully. "In Viareggio everyone
drove him away."</p>

<p>"It belongs," said Marianna, "to a Russian Princess, very far
away and the <i>custode</i> is blind. The doctor said it was
nothing serious," she continued cheerfully. "When it happens he
will say heart failure."</p>

<p>She put a little meal in front of Lucie and watched her eat,
which the tired woman did slowly and mechanically, drinking too,
the red Chianti that did, a little, blur the edges of things.</p>

<p>Marianna told, quite impartially, of the dreadful trouble they
had had with the <i>padrone;</i> he had been so violent, raving for
his wife, complaining of everything, abusing her and the poor
Martinelli who had been helping to look after him.</p>

<p>"And so difficult with the money, <i>signora,</i> he gives me
five francs a day for everything. And it is not enough," she
grinned.</p>

<p>Yes, Pio had always had queer ideas of economy; Lucie recalled
with a pang that he had asked for money that morning to pay the
hotel bill and that she had, out of delicacy handed him her pocket
book with over fifty pounds in it; he had changed it into Italian
money and kept it; she could command about ten shillings.</p>

<p>"We must humour him, Marianna," she said quietly, "if there is
so little time we mustn't thwart him&mdash;I'll see you get your
money."</p>

<p>Strange to think that this woman and everyone here who knew them
thought that it was all Pio's money!</p>

<p>"And the doctor says that you had better not sleep in the same
room," continued Marianna brightly, "but I did not dare make you a
bed up in the other room, the idea made the <i>padrone</i>
angry.</p>

<p>"Why didn't the doctor put a nurse in?" asked Lucie.</p>

<p>"There aren't any who would nurse that disease! You must always
say it is heart trouble, <i>signora,</i> or no one will come near
him."</p>

<p>A bell clanged through the silent house.</p>

<p>"The <i>padrone!"</i> screamed Marianna and clattered
upstairs.</p>

<p>Lucie sat in the large clean kitchen facing what was before her;
she was sure that she couldn't do it, would never really be
expected to do it; some help must come from somewhere.</p>

<p>She was morbidly sensitive to the horrible and unpleasant, not
at all sure of her nerve or her courage; Pio was a coward, moral
and physical, he didn't want to die, he didn't know what was the
matter with him; she couldn't stand by while he found out.</p>

<p>And this great house and the loneliness&mdash;and every possible
inconvenience; it was unthinkable; all her hope rested on the
doctor; he must have some plan, some scheme, surely he would
come over early to-morrow and see him; and then there was the
money; a lot of money would be needed, there would be so much
wanted; she must go on earning money&mdash;somehow.</p>

<p>Marianna came hurrying back into the kitchen.</p>

<p>"He wants you, <i>signora,"</i> she said cheerfully, "I ought to
tell you, the doctor said, that he had two loaded revolvers hidden
somewhere."</p>

<p>Pio had always had those revolvers.</p>

<p>"Why didn't the doctor take them away?"</p>

<p>"He tried to, but the <i>padrone</i> would not give them
up&mdash;" the bell clanged furiously. <i>"Per l'amore de Dio</i>,
go upstairs, <i>signora!</i>"</p>

<p>"You sleep downstairs?"</p>

<p>"Yes, next the kitchen."</p>

<p>Lucie took the candle and went out into the wide passage and
slowly up the stone stairs; after her came Marianna's cheerful:
<i>"buona notte e dolce riposo."</i></p>

<p>Pio was waiting for her, propped up in bed, flushed and
angry.</p>

<p>He complained bitterly about Marianna; the woman got on his
nerves; she would have to leave, she was very wasteful.</p>

<p>He gasped out a lesson on economy, he reminded Lucie that she
was a careless housekeeper, he told her (for the thousandth time)
how his mother had saved the soap and the string, dried the grapes
and bleached the linen and how marvellous her cooking had been; now
and then he interrupted his diatribe to give her directions for his
comfort.</p>

<p>She put everything he asked for on the little table by the bed,
she put the horrid harsh little dinner bell within easy reach, and
the pile of thick woollen vests and night shirts ready on a chair,
she arranged the little wick floating in the glass of oil, cursed
for her clumsiness because it burned badly at first.</p>

<p>There were two beds in the room, the empty one was near the open
window; when at last he was asleep and she lay down on this, the
rain was driven in over her.</p>

<p>Twice she fell asleep and each time the bell roused her; first
he wanted the eggs and Marsala; secondly he was so drenched with
sweat she had to change his soaked flannels and the sodden bed
linen, and then hold him up while he fought for breath in a hideous
cough.</p>

<p>When the drops had reduced him to stupor, Lucie, wearing the
poney skin coat for warmth, lay face downwards on her bed and
faintly cried.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; II</p>

<p>With the next morning Lucie took a keen and troubled survey of
her surroundings.</p>

<p>The Villa Calvini stood in the narrow belt of forest, mostly
pines, that runs, almost uninterruptedly from Livorno to Spezia,
growing straight on to the sands and edging the <i>"pianura,"</i>
that stretches at the foot of the Apennines which rose two miles or
so back from the sea.</p>

<p>These villas, owned by wealthy people who used to let them only
in the summer, were placed at intervals from Viareggio to Marsa,
each in its one square of <i>"pineta"</i> and each facing full on
to the beach and sea; they were built and equipped solely for the
purposes of a few weeks' idle holiday and Lucie found that hers was
absolutely the only one that was inhabited, therefore she was
isolated in about two miles of empty houses; she was also situated
about the same distance from the little town of Forte dei Marni,
where all food and medicine must be bought and which was out of the
season, largely shut up or abandoned.</p>

<p>Trams ran along the road at the back every hour into Viareggio;
to go and return would take three hours; if the weather was bad,
they did not run at all; Viareggio also was empty and shut up.</p>

<p>The house itself, in Lucie's eyes and for Lucie's purpose, could
hardly have been worse; it stood in a wide strip of pine-wood, the
trees crowding right up to the house, the end of which opened on to
the road and the tramline and the great gates of another villa,
also empty; in front was a few yards of garden, filled with
tamarisk, eonymus rushes and rosemary, and a wattled fence and
wooden gate, that gave straight on to sand, but a little above high
tide mark.</p>

<p>The house was square, with wide wings, in the middle one story,
at the sides ground floor only, so that there were two large
terraces flanking the middle structure, which consisted of,
downstairs, a wide hall space and a small dining-room looking on to
the sea, a kitchen at the back, facing the <i>"pineta,"</i> and, up
the wide flights of stone stairs three bedrooms, two in the front,
over the dining-room and hall, and one at the back over the
kitchen; all the rooms opened into each other, and on to the strip
of landing as well; that which Pio had taken, opened as well on to
the right hand terrace, under which were two more bedrooms, one
opening from the dining-room, and a narrow corridor which led to
lumber rooms and a back entrance.</p>

<p>Under the other terrace (which was reached by a door at the end
of the strip of landing) ran one huge room, the <i>"salotto"</i>
which had another door into the <i>"pineta"</i> at the back.</p>

<p>The house, in the stairway, was open from floor to roof, which
gave it a peculiarly desolate appearance; all the windows were
rounded at the top, and the bottom ones were heavily barred by iron
that the sea had coated with red rust.</p>

<p>The walls inside were painted a dark blue-gray, and the
furniture was of the barest and most bizarre description.</p>

<p>There were neither curtains nor carpets, and the floors were
covered with dark purplish tiles&mdash;the stairs were rough gray
stone; there were iron bedsteads in all the sleeping rooms and
plain chairs and tables, in Pio's there was a cheap suite of
satinwood.</p>

<p>The dining-room was sepulchral with the dark walls, barred
window, black table, long and narrow like a coffin, and six black
chairs placed round it; on a shelf was a rusty samovar and a broken
fiaschi stand, on a small side-table a phalanx of half-empty wine
and medicine bottles and directly under the window a thin, bald,
horse-hair sofa.</p>

<p>The <i>"salotto"</i> across the entrance was even more
grotesque&mdash;the immense size of the room was filled with little
wooden tables, dumpty chairs and deck chairs, there was an enormous
empire couch with bolsters to match, in red damask, and an old
gilt-framed mirror.</p>

<p>The whole house was incredibly dark, damp and chill; great
patches of wet and mildew showed on every wall and the tiled floors
were perpetually oozing.</p>

<p>In the kitchen was the usual Italian arrangement, three little
receptacles to burn charcoal in, for cooking, and no oven, in the
<i>"salotto"</i> was a ghastly looking anthracite stove, and in
Pio's room was a more amenable and smaller affair that burnt
wood.</p>

<p>There was no other heating arrangement whatever; the place was
wired for electric light, but there were no fittings; water had to
be fetched from the well in the front garden; there was no
telephone available nearer than Forte dei Marni, and the doctor
seemed to live up the mountains and could only be reached by
letter.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; III</p>

<p>When Lucie had thoroughly realised all these conditions, she
felt, even more than at first, that the situation was absolutely
grotesque, and that she could not be shut up in this alien place
away from any glimmer of help or even sympathy watching the
progress of a loathsome disease, preparing for a ghastly death bed,
and all that appertained.</p>

<p>She had not the strength of either mind or body needful for such
a task, nor was she supported by any inner time of fervour, of love
or devotion; she did not even believe in the prolonging by skill or
labour the last stages of incurable maladies.</p>

<p>She was actuated by nothing but a sense of duty.</p>

<p>And there was always the money question; she must go on with her
sketches and her articles or all four of them, Pio, Mrs. Falconer
and Sophie and herself would come to disaster; there were no
resources for any of them beyond her own work.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; IV</p>

<p>The weather was far from the ideal Italian winter, but
unutterably stormy, sombre and cold; the barred windows of the
Villa Calvin looked on the endless stretch of tossing gray waters,
low hanging clouds, and a tumbled beach and sand piled with
driftwood and ridges of soaked flotsam and jetsam of the sea.</p>

<p>The incessant noise of the heaving waves as they spent
themselves on the shore became almost intolerable; only the tinkle
of the tram-bell marked the passing of the hours; no creature could
ever be observed on the wide expanse visible from the windows save
occasionally some huddled wretch in dingy rags searching for sea
coal amid the flying spume.</p>

<p>The interior of the house was always dark, dismal and gloomy,
very little light penetrated to the lower floors through the many
doors and windows of which the slightest wind would rattle in many
miserable wailings.</p>

<p>Even if the anthracite stove had been in order, it seemed
impossible to get this fuel, so the only warm room of the house was
Pio's bedroom; the rest was cold with a chill penetration of
iciness impossible to describe.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; V</p>

<p>Lucie sat down to write an urgent letter to the doctor.</p>

<p>In the middle of it, Marianna told her that the poor Martinelli
was in the kitchen.</p>

<p>Lucie hastened, glad to meet this link with the outer world,
hopeful of some relief.</p>

<p>But this man, whom she secretly suspected of being a pleasant
rogue, could do nothing; he shrugged and smiled and lamented in the
amiable Tuscan fashion, and seemed very faithful and
willing&mdash;but his expressive "<i>macche!</i>" was all the
advice he could give.</p>

<p>He was employed on the little mountain tramway now and couldn't
come very often.</p>

<p>Marianna reminded him, uneasily, that the <i>padrone</i> had
forbidden him to come at all&mdash;he must please whisper, for he
was only smuggled into the house.</p>

<p>The trouble was about a rabbit Pio had ordered through
Martinelli, and which had proved costly and scraggy and uneatably
tough.</p>

<p>Martinelli referred, with polite regret, to the violent outburst
it had provoked and accused Marianna, of ruining the creature in
the cooking; at which she passionately defended herself, both
voices soon rising above all discretion.</p>

<p>The invalid's bell rang.</p>

<p>Martinelli instantly sobered, was pushed out, promising to come
again and to find the doctor and send him immediately.</p>

<p>Lucie went reluctantly upstairs; the man was healthy and
good-humoured, she wished he could have stayed; Marianna had told
her he would sleep there at night for a small sum, and help in the
heavy morning tasks; this would have been such an immense relief
that she resolved to broach the subject.</p>

<p>"Was that Martinelli?" demanded Pio fiercely.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;he came to see how you were."</p>

<p>Pio broke into a stream of Sicilian curses only too familiar to
Lucie; they had no effect on her whatever.</p>

<p>Then in his awkward English he told her the story of the rabbit,
with bitter gravity and livid fury.</p>

<p>"Don't," said Lucie, "don't."</p>

<p>He had to stop for the cough seized him and the next few minutes
were filled with the vile details of his unclean malady.</p>

<p>This strengthened Lucie's desire for any help she could
obtain.</p>

<p>"Listen, Pio," she said, as he began to breathe more normally,
"Martinelli is willing to sleep here and run errands and help
before he goes to work&mdash;I should like him to do so.</p>

<p>"I will not allow it&mdash;he is a liar, a cheat,
<i>garfarone</i>&mdash;he comes not inside this
door&mdash;<i>Madonna Santa!</i>"</p>

<p>"Pio," said Lucie rather unsteadily, "we are so shut in
here&mdash;it is so lonely&mdash;he would be a kind of link with
things&mdash;"</p>

<p><i>"Accidenti!"</i> shouted Pio, "Are you in love with this
<i>figlio di cane!</i>"</p>

<p>Lucie smiled; Pio really was humorous, you had to smile&mdash;he
was just funny like Punch and Judy&mdash;poor Pio!</p>

<p>"You'll hurt your throat again," she advised. "I won't have him
if you don't wish."</p>

<p>"I should hope not," gasped her husband from the pillows, "am I
not master in my own house?"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch13" id="ch13"></a>Chapter Thirteen</h2>

<p class="cpb">&sect; I</p>

<p>IT rained without ceasing for three weeks, the clouds never left
the hills, the sea never calmed, there was no relief to the biting
cold; no one came near to Villa Calvini.</p>

<p>Lucie had written to the doctor, sent telegrams, telephone
messages from the piazza&mdash;there was no response.</p>

<p>She seemed completely abandoned to her evil fates; she was
beginning to be paralysed; the thing had got hold of her, was
absorbing her; all her world had narrowed to the Villa Calvini; she
had taken up a burden that she was not allowed to forget for an
instant, and she was already becoming engrossed by it; England
seemed so far away.</p>

<p>So few people wrote to her; Mrs. Falconer's warm-hearted
epistles and Sophie's illiterate scrawls were the only links, and
they, it was easy to see, were as wrapped up in their troubles as
she was in hers.</p>

<p>The monotonous routine had gripped her soul, it was like the
treadmill; she dare not stop, even to think.</p>

<p>This was the manner of her existence.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; II</p>

<p>The days were just bearable, you pretended then, that things
weren't so bad, there was always the desperate hope that the
doctor, or <i>someone</i> might come, there was a sort of show of
order and decency, method and punctuality that helped&mdash;there
was a secret feeing that at the very worst you could run out and
fly down those two miles to the village and see some human, kindly
face.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; III</p>

<p>But the long wintry nights&mdash;ah, they were hell opened.</p>

<p>The day began with Marianna's journey to the piazza; she went
off, good cheerful soul, never later than eight, with the big red
handkerchief she called her <i>"faggotta,"</i> a list of medicines
and generally a message to be telephoned or wired to the
doctor.</p>

<p>Lucie would then have her own breakfast and perform the long
laborious toilet of the invalid; few were the days when he would
remain in bed; then there was his room to do, as he would never
have Marianna near it, and his stove to keep replenished, his
medicine and food to prepare and bring up.</p>

<p>Then perhaps she would have just time to write a letter or so
before he wished to be put back into bed where he would take the
midday meal.</p>

<p>Lucie had hers at a little table at the foot of his bed, since
he could not endure her out of his sight, and when this was over
and he had been made comfortable and the room tidied again and the
stove filled, she could count on about two hours while he
slept.</p>

<p>In this interval she wrote her articles and drew her designs,
always using the table at the foot of the bed.</p>

<p>When he awoke there was more medicine to prepare, patent food to
make, tea to be carried upstairs, everything to be tidied once
more, any odd job of mending or washing to be done till it was the
moment to bring up his supper, and have her own, facing him in that
ghastly téte-â-téte.</p>

<p>After this, elaborate precautions for the night, and then, if
he slept once more, another hour or so to herself either to
work again by the dubious light of the oil lamp in the cold dining
room or to talk in whispers with Marianna in the kitchen.</p>

<p>And all day long the sick man's groans, lamentations, bitter
grumblings, and terrible cough.</p>

<p>He complained of everything she did and he varied this hourly
nagging with fits of demoniacal violence.</p>

<p>He was as repulsive morally as he was physically. Lucie could
not discover one endearing trait in his character; her compassion
became withered with contempt.</p>

<p>So passed the days that Lucie began to look upon as her best;
there were many others when she could hold on to no order or method
at all, days of dreadful pain or sickness for the sick man, of
perpetual running up and down the stone stairs for her, of
continual preparing of remedies, administering of tasks loathsome
beyond description.</p>

<p>There was no office so menial, no duty so repellant, that
he could spare it her; because he did not like the servant she must
do everything.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; IV</p>

<p>But at their worst the horror of the days was as nothing
compared to the horror of the nights.</p>

<p>Then she lost grip on reality and seemed plunged into a world of
delirious evil.</p>

<p>She had resolved never to disturb Marianna, who worked so hard
and cheerfully, nor, probably, could she have done so, as the tired
woman slept so heavily in the room beyond the kitchen where so
little could anyhow be heard.</p>

<p>Lucie slept now in the other front bedroom that opened
from her husband's; he insisted that the communicating door be
never closed between them.</p>

<p>Here she would contrive to bathe with a small can of precious
hot water, with the stone floor and damp walls and the light of a
candle, putting on afterwards her woollen dressing-gown and shoes
and a scarf over her head.</p>

<p>Then, if lucky, she might have an hour's sleep; at twelve, two
and five, he took eggs and Marsala; often he fancied coffee, and
she would go downstairs into the vault-like kitchen, and blow up
the charcoal and make it; she did not know how to get a spirit lamp
or thermos in this place of closed shops.</p>

<p>Sometimes he would demand food and she would cook that; often he
wanted brandy or wine; always they were all his garments to change,
several times as the fever sweat drenched him.</p>

<p>Numb and cold, often with chattering teeth, for the window in
his room stood always open, Lucie would go about these tasks,
breaking eggs, pouring out medicine, rearranging his bed, up and
down the icy stairs, opening the door on to the terrace to put out
the foul garments in a bath of disinfectant, snatching what sleep
she could, half an hour here, an hour there, with Pio's querulous
voice, Pio's clanging bell, Pio's deadly cough always in her
ears.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; V</p>

<p>Most of all she hated the dawns.</p>

<p>That breaking of cold icy light above the desolation of the
tossing gray sea and deserted shore, that first glimmer of
colourless white light in the sick room showing the dying flame of
the night-light, the ravaged features of the sick man, her own
haggard reflection in the long mirror of the wardrobe, the thought
that there was another day to be lived through&mdash;these things
brought her endurance almost to the breaking point.</p>

<p>Sometimes, if he was asleep, she would huddle into her own
little bed, that she had dragged into the room away from the damp
walls and try to dream.</p>

<p>But no dreams ever came to her now.</p>

<p>Sometimes she would sit by her window staring at the melancholy
stretch of tumbling waves and cry a little from sheer
wretchedness.</p>

<p>Her salvation was always Marianna with strong black coffee; one
of the brightest spots of the day this when the smiling woman came
up with the tray and pot and cups and lit the stove.</p>

<p>This was the only moment she was allowed in the sickroom and Pio
always grumbled; she had wakened him up, she talked too loud, she
had burnt the coffee; Lucie found it amazing how many causes of
complaint he discovered.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; VI</p>

<p>He still had command of all the money; she had to manage on what
he doled out day by day.</p>

<p>As she had not been able to leave the house since she arrived,
she could not change a cheque in Viareggio, even if this were
possible and she did not wish to draw on the small reserves in the
London Bank even if she could change English money here, which was
not likely.</p>

<p>So she had to run a bill at the chemist's and pinch herself in
sheer food to buy the things he needed.</p>

<p>Several times she had asked for more money to be met by a scene
followed by prostration on his part so that she felt it was killing
him to mention the matte? and had to desist.</p>

<p>One evening, in desperation, she confided her trouble to
Marianna.</p>

<p>That good creature was prompt with a solution of the
difficulty.</p>

<p>"But, <i>signora,</i> why don't you take some when he is
asleep?"</p>

<p>Lucie thought she would; it had simply never occurred to her to
do so before, but she supposed it might be a usual expedient of
wives dependent on their husbands.</p>

<p>She was doubly anxious to get money, because Agostino, the blind
<i>custode</i> of the Villa, was always hovering about, taciturn,
and suspicious, and Marianna warned her that he was expecting a
tip.</p>

<p>Lucie felt in the power of this man, who was a brutal, ruffianly
looking fellow and who evidently was doubtful of the nature of
Pio's illness.</p>

<p>He was barely civil, and his dark figure, tapping his way round
the garden or feeling his way round the house, and peering in with
sightless blurred eyeballs through the barred windows, added to
Lucie's nervous terrors.</p>

<p>Through the cheerful lies of the doctor, Marianna and
Martinelli, Lucie was found in the hateful position of deceiving
this man and telling him, almost every day that the <i>padrone</i>
was better.</p>

<p>He came in and out as he liked and she did not dare stop him;
Pio, it seemed, had ordered a <i>capuana</i> or bathing hut on the
beach from him; another expense, and who would use it?</p>

<p>So this evening Lucie crept upstairs to steal some of her own
money.</p>

<p>Pio kept it in a small tin box in his bottom drawer, and the key
under his pillow.</p>

<p>He had just had his drops and did not stir as she stealthily
withdrew the key by slipping her fine hand under his head.</p>

<p>In a few moments she was in possession of a little wad of paper
that gave her the first sense of pleasure she had known since she
had landed in Italy.</p>

<p>She left about half the money, relocked the box, returned the
key and crept downstairs again to Marianna, who praised her warmly
and gave her a glass of wine.</p>

<p>Lucie laughed&mdash;for the first time since she had entered
that house.</p>

<p>She could not stop laughing and presently she leant her head on
the corner of the kitchen table and cried, the money scattered in
front of her; Marianna dried Lucie's tears with her own coarse
handkerchief.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; VII</p>

<p>A few days after this the doctor came.</p>

<p>Lucie had always thought of him as something benevolent,
fatherly, helpful; she cherished still the idea that he must have
some scheme for her deliverance, some plan to suggest.</p>

<p>Marianna and Martinelli were both noisy in his praise and even
Pio seemed to like him, and though Lucie thought it "queer" that he
should not have made a point of coming sooner, still, she believed
the excuse of the influenza epidemic in the hill towns.</p>

<p>So when the clatter of the outer bell woke her from her first
snatch of sleep and Marianna rushed upstairs with a shawl over her
head, shouting "<i>il dottore! il dottore!</i>", hope leapt up in
her anxious heart.</p>

<p>Pio had been awakened also, and she hurried in to him, to
quickly arrange him and light the big lamp.</p>

<p>There was not time for her to dress and she hardly gave a
thought as her long high camel-cloth dressing gown was as decorous
as a monk's robe, and round her plaited hair she had twisted her
dun coloured veil, to protect herself from the bitter draughts.</p>

<p>She ran quickly downstairs, hoping for a few words with the
doctor before he saw his patient, rehearsing in Italian what she
must say to him, how she must represent the desperate urgency of
her case.</p>

<p>Marianna had run out to unlock the large <i>cancello,</i> the
gate on to the road and Lucie's trembling fingers were trying to
light the dining-room lamp when she heard voices in the
kitchen.</p>

<p>Marianna was there with her candle and Martinelli, Wet and cold,
beating his arms across his chest, and a second man in a
riding-cloak.</p>

<p>Martinelli triumphantly introduced him&mdash;"<i>il signor
dottore</i>."</p>

<p>Lucie looked at him with incredulous dismay; he was short,
stout, bald, with a rough black beard, glasses, bad teeth and
complexion, one arm bandaged and in a sling; he was dirty, his
clothes cheap and tawdry.</p>

<p>"Ah!" he said with a coarse peasant accent, "this is the time of
night to call&mdash;and catch the ladies in their chemises!"</p>

<p>Lucie then saw that he had been drinking; she tried to collect
herself to put forward her tale.</p>

<p>"Doctor, I've been very much wanting to see you&mdash;" Pio's
bell clanked furiously.</p>

<p>Marianna, cheerfully blaspheming, dragged the doctor to the
door.</p>

<p>Martinelli, shivering, began expatiating on the difficulty he
had had in finding and bringing the doctor, and complaining of
hunger and fatigue.</p>

<p>Lucie dully blew up the fire and put on coffee, broke eggs into
the frying pan and got out bread and sugar.</p>

<p>The servant came back and Lucie went upstairs to her own room
and lit the candle; her little travelling watch showed her that it
was nearly two o'clock.</p>

<p>The door was half open into her husband's bedroom, she could
hear his peevish tones and the doctor's deeper voice&mdash;petulant
lamenting and jovial reassurance.</p>

<p>Lucie sat on the bed and waited.</p>

<p>Presently Pio also became more cheerful under the doctor's
reassurances; glasses clinked, there was a smell of spirit.</p>

<p>They were drinking together.</p>

<p>The doctor spoke about his bandaged arm&mdash;poisoned during an
operation, he said, he made a joke about it.</p>

<p>Lucie's teeth chattered.</p>

<p>Neither of them mentioned her; they began to tell each other
vulgar stories about some women they both knew. Lucie with a
trembling heart appeared in the doorway. Pio introduced her, with a
queer flash of pride.</p>

<p><i>"Bella bionda,"</i> smiled the doctor without rising.</p>

<p>"He finds me much better," said Pio, "he says I shall be cured
before I leave here."</p>

<p>"I'm glad," answered Lucie.</p>

<p>She looked at the doctor and something in her bearing made the
man rise and take his leave with many pleasantries for the patient
whom he called <i>"Don Pio."</i></p>

<p>At last he left the room and Lucie followed him downstairs; he
turned into the kitchen where there was light, even a little warmth
and Martinelli, eating fried eggs while Marianna slept with her
head on the table.</p>

<p>"Doctor," said Lucie, "what is the state of my husband's
health?"</p>

<p>He looked at her curiously.</p>

<p>"Better. Much better&mdash;your nursing has done
wonders&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But&mdash;it is incurable?"</p>

<p>"Ah, that&mdash;yes!"</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;how long?"</p>

<p>He shrugged.</p>

<p>"Four five&mdash;six months."</p>

<p>"Can he travel?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;he nearly killed himself going to Turin."</p>

<p>"But I can't stay here&mdash;like this, you must see how
impossible it is&mdash;"</p>

<p>He grimaced.</p>

<p>"I can suggest nothing."</p>

<p>He was scrawling prescriptions in a dirty notebook.</p>

<p>"It is not right I should be left here with him," continued
Lucie. "It is very lonely and he is often violent&mdash;I have no
authority over him, he does things that I know are wrong&mdash;he
drinks too much&mdash;even brandy when he has a fever."</p>

<p>Pio's bell clanged.</p>

<p>"I can't go," said Lucie. "Martinelli, run upstairs and tell him
so, Marianna is asleep&mdash;get him to sleep&mdash;keep him
quiet."</p>

<p>Martinelli drained his glass of Chianti and ran upstairs.</p>

<p>"You see how it is," she added. "Something must be done."</p>

<p>The man seemed a little sobered by her urgency, but he could
only shrug and grimace.</p>

<p>"Even you are ungettable," she continued. "Never at
home&mdash;useless for an emergency&mdash;and coming so
seldom."</p>

<p>"I will come when I can. It is a long way."</p>

<p>"Is there any doctor nearer?"</p>

<p>"None."</p>

<p>"How often can you come?"</p>

<p>"Every fortnight, three weeks, month&mdash;I can do
nothing&mdash;nothing at all!"</p>

<p>"Is there anyone who would come to help me nurse?"</p>

<p>"No one would come to nurse tuberculosis, it is so
infectious."</p>

<p>Pio's bell rang again; this time Marianna woke.</p>

<p>Martinelli came down the stairs, flushed and uneasy.</p>

<p>"He is like a devil," he said. "Go up, <i>per l'amore de Dio,
signora."</i></p>

<p>The doctor took a hasty leave, all three of them shouted and
clattered out into the wet night; through the barred window Lucie
saw the group by the light of the lantern Marianna carried; the
doctor had his arm round the servant's waist.</p>

<p>Pio rang for the third time.</p>

<p>Lucie went to the bottom of the stairs and called up.</p>

<p>"I am coming in a moment&mdash;please don't ring again."</p>

<p>She could not face him just yet; she had to have a moment in
which to recover from her bitter disillusion, her miserable
humiliation.</p>

<p>She was, it seemed, quite abandoned, there was no one who had
the slightest interest in her&mdash;and now it wasn't a question of
weeks but months...how could she go on...how could she?</p>

<p>Marianna returned, elated, good soul, by the doctor's
compliments.</p>

<p>"He will be able to come more often now, <i>signora,"</i> she
said volubly. "He goes to visit la bella Violetta, whose husband
keeps the café, and he is away&mdash;so the doctor can come over
and this makes an excuse for his wife&mdash;only it must be late at
night."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch14" id="ch14"></a>Chapter Fourteen</h2>

<p class="cpb">&sect; I</p>

<p>MARIANNA put out the kitchen lamp and went to bed. Lucie crept
upstairs, so absorbed in her own wretched thoughts that she had
forgotten Pio's unanswered bell and Martinelli's description of his
mood.</p>

<p>Therefore she turned mechanically into her husband's room,
meaning to put out the lamp and settle him for what remained of the
night.</p>

<p>But he was waiting for her, he sat on the edge of the further
empty bed, wrapped in his blue dressing-gown, with his revolver
across his knee.</p>

<p>"So, you have come at last!" he said in Italian, "did you not
hear me ring?"</p>

<p>Lucie looked at him uneasily; his display of bizarre emotions
always seemed silly and childish to her northern temperament.</p>

<p>"Do get into bed, Pio," she said, "you will take a chill."</p>

<p>He began to rave, he heaped on her all the vileness he had
learnt in Sicilian gutters.</p>

<p>"I know why you stayed behind in England, you are a woman of a
hundred lovers! You must leave me lying here while you entertain
the doctor! I know his reputation! And did I not say Martinelli was
not to enter the house&mdash;but you send him up to me! And you not
even dressed!"</p>

<p>He had no power to move Lucie; the grotesqueness of the
situation brought a faint smile to her pale face as she remade his
bed and rearranged his table.</p>

<p>"I am nearly well!" he continued, in his own language, the harsh
tones and broken accents of the south. "I shall be better in a week
or so&mdash;you'll soon stop this going away at night&mdash;how do
I know what you do&mdash;you are a bad woman&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Come back to bed," said Lucie; she observed that between the
brandy he had been drinking with the doctor and the usual nightly
fever, he was in a real delirium.</p>

<p>Under her quiet gaze his voice trailed off, he even obeyed her,
staggered back to his bed and got in, slipping the revolver, a
cheap Belgian affair with a mother-of-pearl handle, under his
pillow.</p>

<p>Lucie put out the lamp and went into her own room, leaving as
usual, the communicating door open.</p>

<p>Despite everything, she really wanted to laugh. To the English
woman, the whole dreadful business had, at times, an aspect of
sheer farce. She heard him muttering and tossing, but lay still and
soon fell, not into a sleep, but a miserable drowsy stupor.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; II</p>

<p>Lucie roused, suddenly and completely.</p>

<p>Her room was full of stormy moonlight, and the glow from the
night-light in the other room; her husband was peering at her
through the crack of the door.</p>

<p>She saw this instantly and lay perfectly still; slowly he
rounded the door and came into the room; he was still in his
dressing-gown and carried the revolver.</p>

<p>Lucie felt her heart leap and knew that she was afraid.</p>

<p>No longer did he appear grotesque or farcical, but horrible as
the horrors of some long outgrown childish nightmare.</p>

<p>His long black hair clung damp to his wet forehead, his lids
were drawn up so that the whites showed above the eyeball, and his
lips were curled back from the glistening teeth.</p>

<p>Never had Lucie guessed that a human being could look so
fearful; she saw she was face to face with madness&mdash;with
<i>possession;</i> it was no sane human soul that looked out at her
from that distorted countenance; his whole gaunt figure seemed to
be rigid and lambent with the furious energy of some evil
power.</p>

<p>Never before had she feared him. For all her nervous timidity,
she was no physical coward. Sheer terror held her for a second as
this awful figure advanced on her with the revolver. She knew he
meant to murder her and she did not want to die that way.</p>

<p>A light chair stood by her bed; she thought, "I will seize that
and knock his arm up."</p>

<p>As she turned to grasp it, he turned away and walked to the
window and stood there, looking out, and muttering.</p>

<p>She saw the moonlight on the metal muzzle and on the ghastly
face; she lay still.</p>

<p>He began talking about a dog that was outside and that he was
going to shoot.</p>

<p>He opened the window and looked out.</p>

<p>Lucie waited for the shot.</p>

<p>But he did not fire.</p>

<p>Muttering to himself, he reeled back to his bed.</p>

<p>When Lucie crept after him she found him in deep
insensibility.</p>

<p>But the revolver was hidden.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; III</p>

<p>With this incident began a new reign of terror for the
unfortunate woman in the Villa Calvini; she lived in the hourly
dread of murder or suicide.</p>

<p>With the greatest cunning he contrived to conceal both his
revolvers and four razors he was in possession of, together with a
loaded leather stick he always carried about, in itself a deadly
weapon.</p>

<p>By no ruse or subterfuge could Lucie get from him any of these,
and the violence provoked by any attempt to do so, was almost
impossible to support.</p>

<p>He, also, to deaden his pains and miseries, began to drink
furiously, brandy, wines and liqueurs.</p>

<p>Lucie had no control over this and he gave his commissions
direct to Marianna, and nothing could shake that faithful
creature's conviction that sick people must have what they
wanted&mdash;and, after all, was he not the <i>padrone</i>?</p>

<p>So the drink went up to Pio, and endless medicines, compounded
of hideous drugs, to "cure his cough."</p>

<p>He had an utter reliance on medicines; so many as seven
different bottles would stand together on his side-table mingling
their sickly and acrid odours; then there were the patent
medicines, and the patent foods, and a variety of pills.</p>

<p>Dr. Villari balanced the rarity of his visits by the quantity of
his prescriptions; two or three evenings a week Martinelli would
slink furtively into the kitchen with a fresh one that Marianna
would pounce on to take to the <i>pharmacista</i> in the
morning.</p>

<p>Lucie liked the man less and less; he was cringing and whining
and always had to be tipped and fed; also she could not but see
that he, the chemist, and the doctor were in league to squeeze
money out of her; she had already spent pounds of her cherished
money in nauseous messes that were worthy of some
<i>esculapicio</i> of the Middle Ages.</p>

<p>She was quite sure of Marianna's honesty, but her incredible
ignorance and her very devotion made her the accomplice of the
others; she really implicitly believed in the doctor and in
his medicines.</p>

<p>And so hard did she work and so lonely and dismal was the life
she led that Lucie could not grudge her the excitement of
Martinelli's visits nor her faith in the miraculous powers of the
concoctions she dragged home so devotedly from the Piazza.</p>

<p>But though Lucie was, in so many things, foolish and incapable,
and not at all clever in expedients whereby to help herself, she
had more excuse for acquiescence in her intolerable position than
might have appeared at first to an outsider.</p>

<p>She was an Italian subject and should she provoke him, he had a
legal right to force her to stay with him, or in the case of an
attempt to escape, to stop her at the frontier; she could not get
her passport endorsed without his consent.</p>

<p>True she had the power of the money, but her means were so
limited that this did not amount to much, and gave her no position
of authority, since everyone believed that every penny was his.</p>

<p>Then again, she was so friendless; she had quieted Mrs.
Falconer's agitation by saying all was normal and well with her and
would have disdained to have burdened that poor woman with any of
her troubles; she had no other friend or relative to whom she would
have cared to appeal, and in Italy her slight acquaintance had been
scattered by the War.</p>

<p>If she left the Vida Calvini there was nowhere she could go.</p>

<p>For this reason she was more or less in the hands of the doctor
and his crew they had it in their power to disclose the real nature
of the illness and to have her turned into the street.</p>

<p>She knew that no one would take them in.</p>

<p>It would mean the hospital at Lucca for Pio, since there were no
private sanatoria in Italy that she knew of nor any nursing homes
for infectious cases, even if she could have afforded such an
expense.</p>

<p>It might have been possible to get a nurse, but she did not know
how to set about it, and again she was afraid of the expense,
besides dreading to attract attention to her case.</p>

<p>Agostino, the blind <i>custode,</i> already had his suspicions,
despite Marianna's cheerful lies and was continually hanging round
the house, grumbling and lamenting the good offers for the summer
season that he had had to refuse.</p>

<p>Lucie was sure that if Pio had not paid six months' in advance
they would have been turned out; she heard through Martinelli that
the man had been complaining to the doctor, who was plainly in a
dilemma.</p>

<p>Here again she could trace the sordid intrigues that had made
profit out of her misery; the doctor had plainly thought that a few
weeks would have seen the end of Pio, that he and Agostino would
have shared six months' rent and the sum to be extorted for doing
up the house and that the whole affair would be forgotten by June,
when the villa would be let as usual for the season.</p>

<p>That was why the two of them had selected, out of all the villas
that were in Agostino's charge (he seemed caretaker of six or
seven), that which was most decayed, out of repair and least
desirable, and whose owner was far away.</p>

<p>Lucie could hardly believe in the existence of the mythical
Polish lady, who appeared to take no interest in her property
whatever.</p>

<p>So March ran into April; Lucie had been in the Villa Calvini two
months and there was no abatement in the cold cruelty of the late,
wet and windy spring.</p>

<p>Lucie played out her tragedy in the midst of the comedy of the
jackals and carrions; Agostino, fearful of the reputation of the
villa, circling round, more bitter daily; the doctor, fearfully
remembering his glib lie, "it's heart disease, he'll be dead in a
few weeks, and you'll get a year's rent and the house done up for
the season"; Martinelli, ready to beg, to tease, even to blackmail
the chemist and the wine merchant whose gross overcharges she dare
not question; and close by, unconscious of it all, the sick man,
with his deliriums, his furies, his agonies, his concealed deadly
weapons, his pitiful needs, his loathsome symptoms, his other
weaknesses and his horrible power.</p>

<p>He appeared to Lucie to be slightly better; her treatment was
sane and she toiled over him with unremitting labour; despite the
drink, he did appear to be getting stronger, to the utter confusion
of Dr. Villari, who paid two more rollicking midnight visits.</p>

<p>The third time was his last; he found Pio in one of his blackest
moods, depressed and violent.</p>

<p>As the doctor jovially entered the room, Pio pointed his
revolver at him from the bed, and cursed him to hell for a useless
charlatan.</p>

<p>Dr. Villari fled; he was only a peasant who had somehow or other
scraped through his examinations at Lucca, he had neither
knowledge, experience nor courage.</p>

<p>He told Luck roundly that her husband was mad and that he should
not come again, and left her to deal with the situation, while he
rattled off in the high gig to find consolation with "la bella
Violetta," whom he was presumably treating for recurrent malaria in
the absence of her husband.</p>

<p>Even Marianna's smiling optimism was a little dashed by such
complete abandonment, such absolute isolation, and the word "mad"
so emphatically used by the departing doctor.</p>

<p>She began to refuse to go upstairs and to lock herself into her
room at night.</p>

<p>And Lucie knew she was warning the few people likely to come to
the house that her master was dangerous and likely to put a bullet
through anyone he saw approaching as he had indeed threatened to
do.</p>

<p>As this was perfectly true, Lucie could not attempt to check the
woman's tongue, though she winced to think what tales she might be
telling on the Piazza, and what fantastic medley of true and false
must be being spread by the doctor and Martinelli.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; IV</p>

<p>So the Villa Calvini became more and more shut away from any
outside interest or happening, avoided by the few who might have
come on account of this fear of violence.</p>

<p>A very real fear in Italy, as Lucie knew, where bloodshed was
common enough and ghastly crimes frequent; the country was
distracted by riots that at times approached civil war and the four
carbineers who constituted the sole police force of Forte dei Marni
were otherwise engaged than in protecting a foreign woman from a
crazy husband.</p>

<p>There might have been things that Lucie could have done to save
herself from such a situation but she could not think of them; she
was inexperienced in everything save the scrambling Bohemian world
of London, and she would, with the instinct of her race and type,
literally sooner have died than have made any spectacular or public
appeal.</p>

<p>In all those two awful months she had never tasted the outer air
save from the terraces for a few moments.</p>

<p>From there she would look down into the pine trees and the
half-hidden roofs of the empty houses on either side, or in front
on to that intolerably prospect of stunted tamarisk, euonymus and
laurel in the strip of garden to the desolate storm and barren sea,
or at the back to the enclosing pines that hid the road and the
tops of the mountains that seemed so utterly far away.</p>

<p>Any attempt at further liberty only provoked further explosions
of wrath from the man who was at once her jailer and her chain that
she had ceased to resist.</p>

<p>It simply wasn't worth it; and she had to remember he was
dying.</p>

<p>Besides she had begun to be indifferent about everything except
dragging through the days and nights; her health was suffering and
her spirits was crushed; what she still possessed of cheerfulness
and vitality she spent to hearten the wretched invalid during his
fits of creeping gloom.</p>

<p>She stuck to her task doggedly with just this idea of doing
things decently and performing her duty; she truly did not much
care what happened to her; she had no hope for the future; she felt
herself utterly worn out; her highest dream of what she would do
when it was all over, was going somewhere with Marianna for a
rest&mdash;not a long one, for there was always Mrs. Falconer and
Sophie to work for, and there would be other things to pay.</p>

<p>Pio had a lot of debts; almost every day there were disagreeable
letters of this kind to answer.</p>

<p>Very often she was sure she would not live to see it "all over";
every night she went upstairs in literal fear of her life; Marianna
was sure she would be murdered and told her many gruesome tales of
wives killed by their husbands&mdash;after all, it was a common
thing in Italy.</p>

<p>Lucie would very gladly have died if this could mean peaceful
oblivion.</p>

<p>But Pio was a rotten shot and she dreaded mutilation; also the
scandal of such open disaster among these aliens.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; V</p>

<p>She had brought two little books with her from
England&mdash;"Julius Caesar" and "Phantastes"; she read them
continuously to give herself some serenity; there were not any
other books in the house; these two were of immense help to her;
she almost knew them by heart.</p>

<p>"I'm quite worthless," she told herself, "what does it matter
what happens to me? I'm just a superfluous woman."</p>

<p>She knew no one was interested in what she was doing, or even
could be&mdash;no one would ever know.</p>

<p>Sometimes she thought&mdash;"when it is over, I'll be free!
Really free!"</p>

<p>But she always answered herself&mdash;"never, you'll never
recover from what you are doing now, never forget what you are
experiencing now, you're one with foulness and evil, disease and
madness, you'll never be the same. You can't be. Your life is over.
There is no hope at all."</p>

<p>Sometimes she thought how wonderful it would be if someone
somewhere loved her, loved her enough to come and search her out
and pity, perhaps praise her. But why should anyone love her?</p>

<p>She was changing, becoming ghastly thin and very white, her
shabby clothes hung on her, she lived in the poney-skin jacket or
the camel-hair dressing-gown; it was so cold.</p>

<p>And still it rained and the wind blew incessantly and the gray
tumble of the waves never ceased.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch15" id="ch15"></a>Chapter Fifteen</h2>

<p class="cpb">&sect; I</p>

<p>THERE came a day, a real red letter day, when Lucie had to go
into Viareggio.</p>

<p>The café on the Piazza had no more brandy, and Pio could not be
without brandy for a single hour.</p>

<p>Also there was some new patent medicine he had read of in the
paper, he wished to try, and which the local chemist did not stock,
so he gave a sour and reluctant consent to Lucie going to
Viareggio.</p>

<p>When she was safely in the empty electric tram really going out
of Forte dei Marni, her spirits rose, despite her shabby clothes
(she had brought so few with her and had had no opportunity of
replenishing them) and the large chintz bag she had brought to
carry her bottles in.</p>

<p>It was raining and there was hardly anyone abroad; the tram
passed miles of shut-up villas; still it was a little break
in the hideous routine of the days.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; II</p>

<p>Here and there you could see someone working in the vineyards or
gardens, now and then an ox-cart passed with a cheery driver; there
were glints of light on the mountains, a few fishing boats on the
sea; at the Viareggio dazio a pleasant red faced official searched
the tram for contraband and gay peasant women got in&mdash;the rain
clouds lifted as you were swept through the town; one of the cafés
was open and even one of the shops; the world was very interesting
really, it was only you who was unfortunate.</p>

<p>You always had to remember that&mdash;it was not the world that
was queer or horrible, but just your own experience. And that was
largely your own fault. You'd been such a fool.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; III</p>

<p>Lucie bought two bottles of brandy and went to several chemists
before she could find the patent medicines.</p>

<p>When she did procure these they proved to be so bulky and heavy
that she could hardly drag her bulging bag.</p>

<p>There were a great many things that she wanted to get and she
had a little money, for she had sent a cheque to Mrs. Falconer
asking her to change it into Italian money and post to her; Mrs.
Falconer had kept half owing to "urgent necessity," but Lucie had
received enough to replenish Pio's pillaged cash-box and to have
just a little in hand.</p>

<p>But there was no time as she had promised to catch the next tram
back, which just gave her an hour in Viareggio, so she dutifully
took up her stand by the <i>fermata</i> between the big hotels and
the row of wooden shops along the sea.</p>

<p>She had brought her watch in her hand-bag and by this she had
five minutes to wait, so she ventured to walk along to the shop she
had noticed&mdash;a <i>merceria</i> with the windows full of cotton
goods.</p>

<p>Lucie wanted stockings, she wanted light dresses against the
heat, she wanted something for fancy work, she had a passion for
sewing, only second to her passion for clothes.</p>

<p>The temptation was too much for her; she went in and bought
these things, simply revelling in the enthusiastic courtesy of the
black-haired woman in the shop.</p>

<p>And just as she was paying she heard the tram, abandoned her
purchases and dashed out in a wild panic.</p>

<p>Too late; it had only stopped a second as there was no one
waiting, and was now speeding towards the <i>dazio</i>!</p>

<p>For a second an almost grotesque sense of disaster overwhelmed
her; she would have to wait an hour for the next tram and that
meant that she would not be home till six&mdash;two hours late.</p>

<p>However, when she reacted from this panic fear, she thrilled to
think that she had a whole hour of liberty.</p>

<p>She made quite an orgy of it; leaving her bag and parcel with
the sympathetic woman in the <i>merceria,</i> she went back into
the town.</p>

<p>The main street was quite lively and full of pleasant
people&mdash;<i>healthy</i> people; Lucie bought some sweets for
Marianna, and at the newspaper shop, a needle art journal, then a
length of orange ribbon, and some orange chiffon she saw in another
<i>merceria,</i> and at the chemist's some heavily scented soap and
<i>cipria.</i></p>

<p>These things gave her extraordinary pleasure; she really for a
moment forgot her miseries in the joy of them; she saw several
other things that entranced her starved mind and when she noticed
the lovely fishing boats with their rust and gold, red and yellow
sails, hurrying home down the canal she almost forgot Pio.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; IV</p>

<p>With wistful eyes she watched the people, all seemed happy,
busy, part of some group or family; she averted her gaze from the
children.</p>

<p>It seemed to her quite natural that these others should be as
they were, and she as she was; she had always felt apart, slightly
a pariah, a bit of an outcast.</p>

<p>When you had never been wanted, when your father was a black
sheep, kicked out by his family, who had died disgracefully, and
you had been brought up by a passionate unhappy woman in the barest
poverty, and amidst the most sordid surroundings, uneducated,
untrained, barely fed, barely clothed, used to calculating on
chance, and luck, mixing wholly with vulgar or queer people, never
seeing, even as a child, decent orderly ways of established family
life, never knowing or expecting any protection, used to shifting
for yourself, and earning, not only your own bread, but that of
other people, you were apt to take unhappiness for granted and to
bear your burden in silence without complaint or searching for
relief.</p>

<p>It had occurred to Lucie dimly that, if she had been differently
brought up, she would hardly have borne what she was bearing, and
she saw, not dimly at all, that if she had not lived in this era of
emancipated womanhood neither her own tragedy nor Mrs. Falconer's
would have been possible; both their lives (Sophie's too) had gone
to pieces because they had been so free, so unprotected,
unquestioned, unadvised, uncontrolled, using the liberty of men
with the hearts and brains of women.</p>

<p>She was tired when she reached home; she had not thought of
taking any food and lately she was easily exhausted.</p>

<p>It was dusk and seemed very late, she had a guilty remorseful
feeling, when she saw Marianna waiting for her at the gate.</p>

<p>It seemed dreadful to think that she had spent nearly two pounds
on herself.</p>

<p>Yet she thought of her treasures with a secret thrill even
now.</p>

<p>Marianna took her parcels with explosive excitement, and a
string of Tuscan curses.</p>

<p>The <i>padrone</i> was furious.</p>

<p>Of course Lucie had known he would be, but she turned a little
sick as she listened to the woman's almost admiring recital of his
displays of rage when the five o'clock tram had come without
her.</p>

<p>"Marianna, he's mad," she said wearily.</p>

<p>Slowly she went upstairs, taking the brandy and medicine with
her in the hope of distracting if not pacifying his wrath.</p>

<p>He was sitting, fully dressed, at the foot of his bed, and as
she entered, he turned on her a face of bitter hate.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry I'm late," she said dully, "I missed the
tram&mdash;it was very punctual and my watch was slow, I think." He
did not answer.</p>

<p>"I got your medicine and the brandy. I thought you would like to
see these papers."</p>

<p>She put some illustrated papers on his table and he pushed them
on to the floor.</p>

<p>"You've been away from your home four hours," he said
furiously.</p>

<p>"I couldn't help it. I've told you how it was."</p>

<p>"That was a lie. You went in to meet someone." Lucie smiled
despite herself.</p>

<p>"Pio, who could I know in Viareggio? The place is empty,
too."</p>

<p>"I believe nothing you say."</p>

<p>"Oh, well&mdash;I suppose it doesn't matter, don't nag," she
answered. "I'm so tired."</p>

<p>"You've been at my cash-box, too," he said fiercely. "There is
nothing missing," she blushed as she spoke. "Everything is turned
about."</p>

<p>"I had to take some money. For the chemist. I put it back."</p>

<p>She turned to leave the room, useless to argue with him, useless
to remain.</p>

<p>He called after her, in his hoarse, dreadful, broken voice.</p>

<p>"I am glad the little girl died as you are not a fit woman to
bring up a daughter."</p>

<p>Lucie did not smile now.</p>

<p>Very seldom had he power to hurt her; sometimes, as now, he
could strike to her heart.</p>

<p>She went heavily downstairs; Marianna, waiting for her in the
wide hall, was frightened at her face.</p>

<p><i>"Signora</i>, what is the matter?"</p>

<p>"Nothing. I'm tired."</p>

<p>She went into that dark, cold dining-room where one candle on
the black table hardly dispelled the shadows, and sat on the hard
narrow couch under the barred window with her hands clasped in her
lap.</p>

<p>The servant peered at her anxiously.</p>

<p>"I feel as if I can't go on," said Lucie.</p>

<p><i>"Dio bonino!"</i> murmured Marianna; she was quick enough to
see that her mistress was nearer to breaking point than she had
ever been. "Is he going then to live for ever, this
<i>'diavolo'</i>?"</p>

<p>"Longer than I am, I think."</p>

<p><i>"Macche!"</i>
</p>

<p>Marianna sought about for comfort; she undid the parcels and
admired the contents; she held up the two lengths of light cotton,
one pale yellow, one pink, in the ghastly light.</p>

<p>"That is what they use for little girls," she said. "How
pretty!"</p>

<p>"Don't," said Lucie sharply, "don't. Please."</p>

<p>Again the woman looked at her shrewdly.</p>

<p>"Send to his family&mdash;make them come. Hasn't he a sister?
You'll be ill, and then who will look after him?"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch16" id="ch16"></a>Chapter Sixteen</h2>

<p class="cpb">&sect; I</p>

<p>LUCIE wrote to the Simonetti in Catania, wrote a rather
desperate and emphatic letter and enclosed the money for the
fares.</p>

<p>At the end of April they came, the brother and sister.</p>

<p>Pio, strangely enough, favoured this visit; he seemed to think
it would mean two more people to wait on him, and to domineer over;
that it might mean two more to help his wife simply never occurred
to him.</p>

<p>He was certainly much stronger now and would spend hours out of
bed, prying round the house, grumbling at the way Marianna did the
work, supervising the cooking and creeping round the garden to
catch any possible intruders on his domain.</p>

<p>On these journeys he would collect the largest stones he could
find to fill his pockets; these he would keep and on his really
good days sit at his window and aim them at the stray dogs (of
which a horrible quantity began to prowl with the warmer weather)
that wandered into the garden from the beach.</p>

<p>Lucie had nerved herself to wait for the yell from some victim,
but Pio was, as she had told herself, a rotten shot, and never hit
any of the gaunt, unhappy beasts.</p>

<p>The two Simonetti arrived, two pale sickly, undersized
creatures: he, a school teacher of about forty-five, she, a
delicate woman of Lucie's age, widowed, who looked after a very old
father.</p>

<p>Lucie had seen the sister during a brief visit to Sicily, but
this was the first meeting with the brother.</p>

<p>Both of them arrived in a black melancholy, shuddering and
sighing; they loathed the country, the weather, the house.</p>

<p>The girl, Catering, who was a gentle, amiable, feminine
creature, caught at once an ague-ish cold and shuddered in bed in
the third bedroom upstairs.</p>

<p>The brother, Rosario (a name so ironically chosen), wandered
about in an overcoat too large for him, a travelling rug over this
fastened at the neck by a safety pin, a huge tweed cap drawn down
to his collar, and a <i>scaldino</i> perpetually in his hands.</p>

<p>His linen and person were dirty, he shaved once a week, he was
in wretched health and subject to fits.</p>

<p>Lucie was sorry for him; he was trying to bring up a wife and
six children on a miserable pittance and was simply stupefied by
poverty, ignorance and disease.</p>

<p>Lucie put her case to him with the best heart she could and
asked his advice, the assistance of the family; she begged him to
find some doctor to undertake the case, or go at least to see
Villari.</p>

<p>For a week he would not go because it rained; he neither read
nor, save when forced, spoke; his one diversion was to suck lumps
of sugar and make himself odd cups of coffee in the kitchen to
Marianna's intense vexation.</p>

<p>Every night he took a bag of sugar and a bottle of Marsala to
bed with him into the dismal room off the dining-room that he
occupied.</p>

<p>In the huge peaked cap and bunched shawl (he wore these even at
meal times) he looked like some sick and rather foul bird.</p>

<p>He never spoke to Pio save to quarrel with him, and never went
near him if he could avoid it; he was terribly afraid of infection,
almost as much as he was afraid of fresh air and water.</p>

<p>He insisted on having his own cup, plate, knife and fork kept
separately and washed up separately, he shuddered away from
everything that had been in his brother's room.</p>

<p>When at length he was induced to go in search of a doctor, he
lost his way and returned from a barren errand; the second time he
took the money Lucie gave him to pay Villari with to buy a gaudy
umbrella in Viareggio.</p>

<p>He was so pleased with it that she hadn't the heart to be
angry.</p>

<p>Of course he was obviously useless; he believed his brother mad,
and said so; he could offer no advice nor help whatever.</p>

<p>Once Lucie, after difficulty, smuggled down the two revolvers
Pio had left on his bed and begged Rosario to unload them.</p>

<p>He took them out into the garden gingerly; he couldn't find out
how they opened and Lucie had to take them back as they were.</p>

<p>The climax came one day when Pio had to stay in bed; he insisted
that his brother should go and visit him there and at last the
shivering wretch was induced to go up.</p>

<p>He took a tumbler in his pocket, and seized an opportunity when
the patient was dozing to fill this with Pio's special wine and
drink it off.</p>

<p>Encouraged by his success, he produced an empty medicine bottle
and was emptying the precious brandy into it when Pio opened his
eyes.</p>

<p>Before the sick man's yells of fury the thief fled; Pio came out
on to the stair head and threw the abandoned bottle and glass after
him, Catering rushed from her room in screaming hysterics.</p>

<p>"They had better both go," said Marianna grimly, "and the devil
keep them."</p>

<p>That night Pio was taken very ill; the two Sicilians locked
themselves into their rooms till the morning.</p>

<p>"Yes, they had better go," agreed Lucie.</p>

<p>They were only too willing; both borrowed money from her, and
carried off all the Marsala and sugar in the house in the newspaper
parcels they called luggage.</p>

<p>With half-amused irony Lucie asked the man what he would suggest
she did with the brother he fled from.</p>

<p>"Send him to the hospital at Lucca," he answered. "And that is
too good for him. He ought to be in a <i>manicomio.</i>"</p>

<p>When she went upstairs again after seeing them off, Pio stoutly
cursed them, and said, if they ever wrote to him, their letters
were to be destroyed.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch17" id="ch17"></a>Chapter Seventeen</h2>

<p class="cpb">&sect; I</p>

<p>THAT disposed of the Sicilian relations&mdash;quite definitely;
Lucie bore them no ill-will, she always answered kindly the
pathetic letters of the old father whom she remembered as a fine
old man, in every way superior to his children, and she wrote
affectionately to Catering, who occasionally sent her melancholy
lamentations.</p>

<p>But it was useless to think of them as likely to be of any use
whatever in any emergency; the whole crowd of them were literally
"all to pieces"; as she and her family were, Lucie reflected
grimly.</p>

<p>If she had belonged to a conventional family, or set, if she had
come of orderly, decent stock, there would have been someone to say
now&mdash; "What has become of Lucie Simonetti? We must go and help
her."</p>

<p>But there was no one save those in positions even more
precarious than her own.</p>

<p>Mrs. Falconer, generous, impulsive creature, would have come out
to her if she had the means, and would have disentangled herself
from Sophie, but Lucie knew that she could not have endured the
life of the Villa Calvini for a week; neither would Pio have
endured her; they had never met save to violently quarrel.</p>

<p>So Lucie spared her aunt agitation by writing to her that Pio
was getting better and that she was quite happy and
comfortable.</p>

<p>He did indeed appear to be getting better; with the passing of
the late bitter spring, with the coming of the delicious days of
sunshine and warm breezes, with the calming of the winter seas, he
did indeed seem to be stronger.</p>

<p>He would go out now, nearly every day, to the wooden
<i>capuana</i> Agostino had erected on the sand, and sit there for
an hour or so; on several occasions he went into Viareggio by the
tram, to Lucie's complete mortification and the scandal of all who
beheld him.</p>

<p>Of all the mental tortures she had endured since she came to
Italy, none perhaps had been so acute, as this slow pacing through
the lively street of the gay little town with the sick man on her
arm, everyone's eyes on them in disapproval while he coughed,
choked, blasphemed, vomited...and she stood beside him, rigid.</p>

<p>It was strange that she saw no looks of sympathy; her fidelity
to the sick man provoked no kindness; she appeared to be regarded
as part of the offence.</p>

<p>They were moved on out of the cafés where they stopped to give
him a rest, and turned out of the cabs they had hired; everyone was
afraid of Pio's cough, his ghastly looks; there was a national
campaign against tuberculosis.</p>

<p>Lucie never went on these expeditions without the fear that they
would be forbidden the use of the trams; they were still very
empty, and they were always left to themselves in the corner they
had chosen.</p>

<p>Pio never noticed any of these things; his lack of
sensitiveness, of all control and reticence, his complete
absorption in himself, and yet his absolute ignorance of what his
illness really was, never ceased to amaze Lucie; he had just
accepted the crude lies of the doctors that "his lungs were all
right" and had no fears for himself at all, nor any suspicion that
he was an object of fear and abhorrence to anyone.</p>

<p>In Viareggio he found another doctor, a fashionable physician
this, who promised to come out to Forte dei Marni once a week.</p>

<p>Lucie's hopes rose again; here seemed some help, some normal,
decent aspect.</p>

<p>But a month passed and Dr. Bonami never came. More telephoning,
wiring, letter writing for Lucie; more curses, blasphemies, furies
from Pio.</p>

<p>It was well into June now, the weather of a heavenly softness,
the blue air full of swallows, the sea a calm and sparkling azure,
the mountains clear as jewels in their sharp-cut lines; the vine
round the kitchen door showed hard little grapes, the tamarisk in
the front garden bloomed, on the beach beyond the gate flowered sea
lavender, rosemary and thrift.</p>

<p>Agostino went round the empty villas airing them, sweeping them;
the old fishermen were building the <i>capuane</i> and thatching
them with boughs.</p>

<p>All the villas were let; by July the place would be full.</p>

<p>Lucie looked forward to this with lively dread; almost better,
she thought, the gloom and isolation of the winter, than to be
overwhelmed by wealthy holiday makers, to have her sordid tragedy
staged amid the frivolity, the luxury, the curiosity of a
fashionable resort.</p>

<p>Pio, on the other hand, looked forward to it with pleasure; he
ordered several summer suits from his London tailor, he sent two as
a present to his father.</p>

<p>Lucie had just paid the bill and it had leapt at once to its
former proportions.</p>

<p>She was writing short stories 'now, as well as articles, and
they were fairly successful, but it was hard keeping abreast of the
expenses and so far from her market.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; II</p>

<p>At last Dr. Bonami arrived by the afternoon tram; he was an
immaculate-looking man with a curling black beard, an exquisite
linen suit, a fine hand, a fine signet ring, in every way a
contrast to Dr. Villari; he began by saying that he must catch the
same tram back which gave him just ten minutes.</p>

<p>He asked Pio to come into the garden, and even there stood far
away from him; he wrote out several prescriptions, he made several
vague remarks, he kept looking at his watch; Lucie had no chance to
speak to him alone.</p>

<p>He made no promise of a second visit.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; III</p>

<p>It began to be hot; they were able to sit in the garden, or on
the terraces, and to have all the doors and windows open; to the
shivering agony of stone floors and fireless rooms succeeded the
languor of the heat; Pio's sufferings were augmented and Lucie was
faint with exhaustion; the warm weather entailed more work; it was
difficult to keep food, impossible to procure ice, insects began to
swarm, and the garden to look parched and arid.</p>

<p>Lucie made up the two cotton dresses and washed them herself,
Marianna had enough to do with the other laundry.</p>

<p>No one would take their linen, nor come in to wash it. "How is
it you aren't afraid of infection?" asked Lucie once.</p>

<p>"My father died of it," Marianna answered, "and we all slept
together, eight in one room, till my mother woke to find him dead
beside her&mdash;he had a cough just like the <i>padrone."</i></p>

<p>"He died in May," she added reflectively, "they always door
November. Now the <i>padrone</i> has passed May he will live till
November."</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; IV</p>

<p>The early mornings were lovely as any imagined Paradise.</p>

<p>After the horror of the nights, Lucie would step out into the
rosy pale gold of the dawn and gaze at the murmuring stretch of
dove-coloured sea, the silver sands, the fragrant boughs of the
pines where the swallows had hung their woven nests, and feel, even
at her worst moments, some balm.</p>

<p>The villa garden at her right was crowded now with roses and
oleanders, that to the left was full of camellias, lilies and
syringa; as both houses were empty, these flowers faded ungathered,
and Lucie, with her arid garden and bare house, longed for some of
these blooms with wistful eagerness; she had the northerner's
thrilled delight at the free-blooming of exotic flowers.</p>

<p>They were such wonderful roses, mostly white, drooping,
trailing, massed with bloom; in the early dawns they looked almost
luminous, and the perfume hung in the golden stillness, a cloud of
fragrance.</p>

<p>Pio also remarked the flowers, and asked Marianna to procure him
some from Agostino. Lucie forbade her to ask any favour of the
blind man, knowing too well how evilly he was disposed towards
them, but told her to buy some flowers on the Piazza and say they
were from next door&mdash;Villa Ghisleri, as it was called.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; V</p>

<p>Pio became very ill again; he could seldom leave the house now;
the nightly fever began early in the afternoon; by dusk he would be
raving in delirium; violent fits of convulsions now followed his
bursts of temper, he suffered from ghastly delusions, maniacal
terrors, the fever, the brandy, the heat, wrought on him literally
to the point of madness.</p>

<p>His days were passed in such an agony of suffering, that Lucie
felt herself half crazed by her inability to help.</p>

<p>After one night spent sitting by him on the floor where he
crouched, clutching her arm and gibbering in insane terrors, now
weeping like a child, now howling like a dog, she went desperately
into Viareggio to find Dr. Bonami.</p>

<p>She had to wait three hours before she could see him; then the
interview was very brief.</p>

<p>Dr. Bonami could not undertake the case; it was too far, the
season was beginning, he had his hands full. And it was hopeless.
Really he could do nothing.</p>

<p>He was not very sympathetic, only coldly civil; he rather
grudged the time this shabby, haggard woman was taking up; he
sensed her poverty, he thought her rather queer.</p>

<p>Many people did; there was some kind of spiritual stigma on
Lucie Uden.</p>

<p>She was not yet broken to the point of asking for pity; she had
stated her case without emotion, and without complaint she took her
leave; she asked him to send his account.</p>

<p>The sleek doctor hesitated as he opened the door of his
consulting room, some faint uneasiness stirred him.</p>

<p>"You look ill yourself, <i>signora.</i> You are just in the
state to take the infection. Get into the fresh air as much as you
can."</p>

<p>Lucie turned into the blazing street giddy and faint; she had to
walk slowly, and her heart seemed to jerk in a funny way.</p>

<p>It was the hottest part of the day, she had no parasol, and her
shoes were heavy and unsuited to the cotton frock&mdash;queer that
there were never enough francs for new shoes or chance to buy
them&mdash;she recalled the still unused ribbon, soap and chiffon
with regret; the rent was nearly due and she would have some
difficulty in scraping it together.</p>

<p>She had half-an-hour to wait, so she walked slowly along the
sea-front, between the wooden shops, now all open, the cinemas, the
cafés, the bathing-places, and the long row of smart, gay hotels
and private houses all beginning to get ready for the season.</p>

<p>Lucie felt this the very nadir of her fortunes.</p>

<p>To-day she had no heart to even look into the shops, nor to
resent that she wore a rush hat Marianna had bought for a lira on
the Piazza.</p>

<p>She had to go back and tell her husband that she had failed to
get the help he craved; she had to pass other nights like last
night, more and more of them till that awful end she must face
alone.</p>

<p>She wished that he had some belief in some religion, then she
would have gone to the village priest, who looked a kindly man; but
the mere mention of such a thing was sufficient to bring on one of
his attacks; he was that most unmanageable creature, a bigoted
atheist.</p>

<p>This attitude of his had closed another possible way of relief
for Lucie.</p>

<p>She had one acquaintance in Viareggio, an Englishwoman married
to an Italian engineer employed on the tramway, who had recently
come to the town. Lucie had written to her after seeing the
husband's appointment in the papers, and she had paid two furtive
visits to the Villa Calvini that had been like beams of
light&mdash;but, Pio hated her, she had a large family, her husband
was afraid of infection and, good and kind and sweet as she was,
Lucie could not expect her to come again; she had, however, sent
over the resident English chaplain, a nervous elderly man, with a
sickly sister.</p>

<p>They meant to be kind, but Pio would never see them, nor allow
Lucie to return their visit or go to church. One disastrous time
when they called with a little book "Consolations for the Dying"
and a tiny picture of the Crucifixion and found him in the garden,
he was so rude they had never come again.</p>

<p>Lucie did not blame them; they had meant very well, even when
they had told her, by way of comfort, that "every day you live now,
will be a beautiful memory in the future when your dear one is at
rest."</p>

<p>She was sorry that she had been cut off even from this company,
and help, but here again she could not appeal for pity, she had,
even to the friendly little Englishwoman, more or less pretended
that she was "all right."</p>

<p>Neither had she let Dr. Bonami know the depths of her torture;
always she made the best of her husband, invested him with dignity,
dressed him up in some virtues, veiling the truth with deep
instincts of pride and shame; he was her husband.</p>

<p>No words, hardly any action could have expressed her utter
wretchedness as she returned through the burning heat to that
dismal house that seemed so truly cursed.</p>

<p>Her health and spirits were both so shaken that she could see no
hope or consolation anywhere; she doubted her power to continue to
infuse into Pio even the modicum of courage with which he got
through the awful hours.</p>

<p>For, though he never said a word of gratitude or appreciation,
he did cling to her with a pitiful desperation, he turned to her in
his agonies, and called on her in his terrors, and she knew that he
had an implicit though unspoken faith that she would never desert
his need.</p>

<p>As she turned into the long path between the black pines into
that dismal house, where Marianna was awaiting her so anxiously,
she felt that the world was, literally, black about her; without
sleep, without food, exhausted by incessant labour of mind and
body, at that moment Lucie's nerves nearly betrayed her.</p>

<p>"Give me a glass of wine," she said, "the doctor won't come. No
one will come. I've got to go on alone."</p>

<p><i>"Dio Bonino!"</i> ejaculated Marianna, and cursed the men of
medicine for paltry cowards.</p>

<p>Lucie drank the wine and ate a piece of bread.</p>

<p>"It is quite reasonable, really," she said, faintly, "we are so
far away&mdash;and it is so hopeless&mdash;why should anyone
trouble?"</p>

<p>"But the <i>padrone</i> thinks that you will bring the doctor
back with you, <i>signora!</i> He is suffering very much!"</p>

<p>"I know! I know! But a doctor couldn't do anything."</p>

<p>"He thinks so, though," said Marianna shrewdly.</p>

<p>Lucie went upstairs.</p>

<p>Pio lay dressed on the bed; adorning the table beside him was a
large bunch of the roses from next door; Lucie recognized them at
once.</p>

<p>When she met the eager, beseeching look he turned on her, she
could not give him the truth.</p>

<p>"Dr. Bonami is very busy, Pio. He will come as soon as he
can."</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; VI</p>

<p>Later, she asked Marianna about the roses.</p>

<p>"Agostino brought them, <i>signora."</i></p>

<p>"How strange!"</p>

<p>"I suppose he wanted a tip, <i>signora."</i></p>

<p>"Is the villa let?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>Lucie hoped it might remain empty; it belonged, she knew, to a
famous Florentine surgeon who was very seldom there; he owned a
good deal of the property and had been largely responsible for the
opening up of the place before the War, when he had introduced it
to German friends, who had built many of the houses.</p>

<p>Agostino had mentioned him with awe as a very great man
indeed, and Marianna spoke of him as very old, ninety, she thought
he must be, and eccentric, <i>"motto"</i> in fact.</p>

<p>"I wish Agostino would not bring the flowers," said Lucie, "I
expect he has no right to touch them."</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; VII</p>

<p>Pale, exquisite, fragrant, these roses drooped amid the acrid,
sour odours of the sick-room, and seemed to look at her, in the
yellow night-light glow, as she sat through the summer night,
leaning against the low bed and supporting against her shoulders,
the wet, sunken head of the so slowly dying man, as he muttered and
tossed in a delirious stupor.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch18" id="ch18"></a>Chapter Eighteen</h2>

<p class="cpb">&sect; I</p>

<p>SHE was able to sleep about two hours that night (it was strange
how little sleep she was able to live with now) and when she woke
it was the pure hour of the dawn.</p>

<p>She tip-toed into her husband's room; he was still unconscious
and had no need of her; so she went across the landing and opened
the door on to the right hand terrace.</p>

<p>At once she smelt the roses next door; they were so lovely under
the open sky that she was sorry for those wilting in the
sick-room.</p>

<p>It was a day of ethereal calm, sky and sea seemed one luminous
vapour, blue as a hyacinth, the heat was gentle, the minute waves
so languid they scarcely broke against the shore.</p>

<p>The swallows darting in and out of the pines were the only live
creatures visible.</p>

<p>The pellucid, transparent light, the sweet stillness, the soft
warmth, affected the sad tired woman with some faint transient
pleasure.</p>

<p>Suddenly she heard a man whistling&mdash;beautifully like a
bird&mdash;joyously.</p>

<p>It came from amongst the trees and oleanders.</p>

<p>She stood quite still, listening.</p>

<p>There was someone in the garden; through the pines and the
bushes she caught a glimpse of a white jacket, then a door closed
and the whistling ceased.</p>

<p>Lucie went indoors.</p>

<p>Late that day she found a chance, as she stood stirring a patent
food over the charcoal fire, to ask:</p>

<p>"Marianna, is there someone next door? I saw&mdash;and heard
someone this morning."</p>

<p>"It was the professor, <i>signora</i>&mdash;he came down
yesterday and went back to-day."</p>

<p>"But isn't he very old?"</p>

<p>"Old, indeed&mdash;with a long beard&mdash;<i>cosi</i>." She
measured a yard down her body.</p>

<p>"This wasn't an old man."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch19" id="ch19"></a>Chapter Nineteen</h2>

<p class="cpb">&sect; I</p>

<p>IT was fully July and a great heat shimmered over the land; even
here, at the edge of the sea, the breezeless days were almost
intolerable.</p>

<p>One by one the villas had opened and they were now all full of
idle people, who lounged all day in pale garments in the
<i>capuane</i> or on the seas, or bathed from gay boats on
the placid water.</p>

<p>They were of all nationalities and had little in common but
their wealth; the men in white linen or shantung silk, the women in
flimsy fine draperies with vivid parasols or lace hats, the
children in their fragrant muslins and embroideries, all gave an
impression of frivolous pleasure-loving ease.</p>

<p>Many of the women, South American, French, Italian, were lovely
as exotic flowers in their exquisite robes of cord, or lemon
coloured, azure, lilac ivory-white or jade green organdies and
chiffons, that floated round them like the petals of a flower and
gave them the ethereal aspect of fairy creatures as they moved
languorously through the heat haze, slowly along the golden sand at
the verge of the hyacinth-hued sea.</p>

<p>It seemed hardly possible that this was the shore where the
winter-waves had beaten in such long monotony of greyness and where
one or two starved creatures had struggled with the winds in
searching for some driftwood among the scattered spoils of the
storm.</p>

<p>Lucie's isolation was as acute as ever, but of a different kind;
before she had been alone amid melancholy loneliness; now she was
alone among gay holiday-makers on whose useless leisure she felt
her presence a blot.</p>

<p>In many ways life became more difficult; food went to those who
could pay the most for it. The faithful Marianna, for all her
shrewdness, was often not able to bring back enough eggs, milk,
fruit and vegetables for the sick man and for what she did get she
had to pay a price that was a strain on Lucie's resources.</p>

<p>The two women themselves lived on what was almost an allowance
of scraps; Lucie had little appetite and only ate as a duty.</p>

<p>Pio never left the house now and she never left him, save for a
moment in the garden. She felt her health being steadily
undermined&mdash;and her spirits sinking, sinking almost beyond her
power of raising them; she had become so sensitive that she hardly
liked to go on the terraces for fear of being observed by the
strangers on the sand. She had to often do so, however, for Pio
fancied to take his meals there and would sit in a dressing-gown
glowering at the passers-by.</p>

<p>The little villa to the left, Villa Tristan, had been taken by a
brassy-haired American with an invalid mother and Lucie dreaded the
bright eyes of this woman whose voice rose like the squeaking of a
parrot from her garden and who dipped every morning in blue satin
and corsets.</p>

<p>There did not appear to be many English people there and Lucie
was thankful. Nothing, she knew, could be so hateful as the English
abroad, unless you were placed, which she was very far from.</p>

<p>But she was not to be wholly spared even this.</p>

<p>One morning Marianna told her she had not been able to get any
milk and had been bold enough to ask the servant of the
<i>inglese</i> at the villa the other side of the road if they
would sell some, as it was for a sick man and they had their own
<i>podere.</i></p>

<p>The other had promised her best endeavours and Marianna was
elated; but Lucie's pride got another twinge; she knew the villa in
question and feared that whoever could afford to live there must be
far more opulent than kind.</p>

<p>However she really wanted the milk and she allowed Marianna to
call that evening.</p>

<p>The result was about a pint of skim milk and a message to the
effect that Mrs. Heaton was sorry but cook had required a great
deal for mashing potatoes, but there might be some more
to-morrow.</p>

<p>The next morning Lucie happened to be at the gate; Marianna was
away at the Piazza and the vegetable woman had come, Lucie had run
out in response to the clanging of the <i>canallo</i> bell, leaving
Pio fuming.</p>

<p>And while she was bargaining with the pleasant old woman and
giving the donkey a crust of bread, the two English people came out
of their gate and as the road was narrow came face to face with
Lucie.</p>

<p>They hesitated; they had, though Lucie did not know it, been
asked by the English chaplain to be "kind" to a fellow
countrywoman.</p>

<p>The man, immaculate, expressionless, in spotless white, did not
know whether to raise his hat or not; he half did so, then changed
the action into that of settling it on his head; the woman,
fragrant in a Paris frock of the delicate blue her eyes might have
been, save for nature's malice.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry to hear your husband is ill," she said, with a manner
of steely affability&mdash;the great lady to the tenantry.</p>

<p>"Thank you. He is very ill," Lucie was conscious of her cotton
dress, her worn shoes, her arms full of cabbages, and of the boring
glance of the other woman's eyes on these things.</p>

<p>"I shall be glad to give you the milk," said Mrs. Heaton. "These
are two excellent cows we have&mdash;cook is using a great deal
now, as we entertain rather a lot, but if you care to send round
every evening&mdash;milk," she finished, with an air of finality
"is <i>so</i> necessary for invalids."</p>

<p>"Thank you," answered Lucie.</p>

<p>Again the two English hesitated; the man bowed slightly; Lucie
would not help them; with a "Good-morning" they moved away.</p>

<p>Lucie went back to the house with a heaving heart; the incident
had stung.</p>

<p>It was hard not to be bitter, not to feel rebellious.</p>

<p>She tried not to hate Mrs. Heaton; the woman was just acting up
to her code, and taking advantage of the well-bred Englishman's
right to be abominably rude.</p>

<p>If she knew anything about you&mdash;if her father had been at
school with yours, or your husband was in a crack regiment, or your
boy was at Osborne or Sandhurst, or you had a relative with a
title, or lived in an orthodox way with lots of servants, certainly
she would have been sympathetic, kind and helpful&mdash;it probably
wasn't her fault that she could only act according to her
grandmother's code&mdash;just as she could only spend her
grandfather's money&mdash;independent action was as impossible to
her as earning her living.</p>

<p>Miss Pardoe, the American lady, had also been spoken to by the
English chaplain before he closed the church and went away for the
summer; she discharged the burden on her conscience with
promptitude.</p>

<p>Her maid gave a message to Marianna. Miss Pardoe felt it
wouldn't be right for her to call at a house of sickness as she had
a delicate mother, and she couldn't ask Madame Simonetti to call on
her as her mother didn't like strangers, but perhaps they'd meet on
the sands some day.</p>

<p>Lucie didn't answer the message and she didn't send for the
milk.</p>

<p>She was now left comfortably alone.</p>

<p>And soon ceased to think at all about these people.</p>

<p>The monstrous routine of the day and night gripped her very
soul; she saw the pleasure-makers from the window as the Lady of
Shalott might have seen the shadows in the magic mirror.</p>

<p>And with less interest.</p>

<p>She was now having, in the course of her nursing, to perform
tasks of a nature so menial and so revolting that a year before she
would have sickened at the mere recital of them; there was no
loathsome detail of the foul disease she had not dealt with, no
horror of this living decay of a human body that had been spared
her.</p>

<p>She often wondered if her task would have been ennobled or
rendered impossible altogether if she had loved him&mdash;and then
wondered if his own mother could have loved him as he was now.</p>

<p>All that was good and pleasant in the unhappy man (and there
must have been much of both) was consumed, burnt away by the fires
of his malady; he was like a creature without a brain or a soul, or
possessed by some evil power.</p>

<p>His senses were preternaturally sharp; he knew when Lucie left
the room; he seemed to know when she left the house; he followed
every detail of her tasks with minute precision and never failed to
exclaim against any omission.</p>

<p>She had to keep his extensive wardrobe in perfect order, ties,
collars, socks, gloves, handkerchiefs, all graduated according to
size, colour or quality.</p>

<p>Every day his various pairs of boots and shoes had to be dusted
and polished, his endless suits of clothes aired, shaken or
repressed.</p>

<p>And when he was free from too great pain or discomfort and she
had succeeded in the dreadful task of slightly raising the clouds
of black melancholy that overwhelmed him, he would tell her stories
of his early amorous adventures&mdash;dwell with pleasure on the
incredibly crude vices that had helped to bring him where he was,
describe the vile orgies of unspeakable places in Naples, Milan and
London.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; II</p>

<p>When the shivering fits were on him and nothing but human warmth
would heat his deadly cold, Lucie, as she held him in her arms,
thought of the knight and the leper whom he brought into his bed to
warm.</p>

<p>His task could not have been more loathsome to him than hers was
to her; sitting by the sick man's bed, holding him in his gibbering
icy shudderings&mdash;afterwards gripping his hand when the fever
mounted and the summer night was to him peopled with hideous
monsters.</p>

<p>He pictured them to her; he seemed to think that she had some
power over them and that as long as she was there they could not
wholly overwhelm him.</p>

<p>She repeated:</p>

<p>"There is nothing there, Pio, there is nothing there," seemed to
have some soothing effect, for if she was long silent or tried to
creep away, the wretched man would fall into screaming convulsions
of terror.</p>

<p>Again and again he would tell her about what was in the
room&mdash;a leering cat on the pillow, fat snakes under the bed,
soldiers pacing up and down the terraces, voices in her room, a
dead child in the empty bed, in the air rows and rows of faces, all
calling out to him "Fool! Fool!"</p>

<p>She went so carefully with him every step of the awful way he
trod that she shared all his agonies; his sufferings were like her
own, she seemed actually to see and do visible battle with the
hosts of evil that encompassed him.</p>

<p>One dawn, after a night of foul terrors, when the delirium had
left him, he caught her hand and held it over his gaunt ribs.</p>

<p>"You wouldn't deceive me, would you?" he gasped.</p>

<p>She was used to his angry jealousies and she answered
mechanically.</p>

<p>"No, Pio, of course not."</p>

<p>But this time he meant something else.</p>

<p>"You would not stay with me like this unless you loved me?"</p>

<p>Lucie winced.</p>

<p>"I shouldn't want you to stay&mdash;for pity&mdash;I'd rather
die in a ditch."</p>

<p>"Not pity&mdash;Pi&mdash;no&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Love, then, you do love me?"</p>

<p>She had to utter the monstrous lie.</p>

<p>"Of course I love you."</p>

<p>"I don't think you could stay if you didn't," he said
wistfully.</p>

<p>"What makes you say that?" she asked unsteadily.</p>

<p>"I thought you might be getting tired," he answered.</p>

<p>"I haven't said so&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;and if you love me you must be glad to be here."</p>

<p>Lucie had no answer; she was shocked by this new aspect of
Pio.</p>

<p>"If I die," went on Pio (it was the first time he had spoken of
such a possibility), "I want you to promise not to marry
again."</p>

<p>This seemed to Lucie grotesque; yet somehow she did not want to
make any such vow; it seemed to her like a parody of something
sacred.</p>

<p>"Well, you promise also," she evaded&mdash;"I might die
first&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, with a man it's different," he returned peevishly. He did
not press his point.</p>

<p>"If you love me," he added, "you wouldn't care to marry
again."</p>

<p>"What should I do&mdash;with the rest of my life, do you think?"
asked Lucie.</p>

<p>"I suppose," he said gravely, "you would think of me."</p>

<p>"All the rest of my life? And nothing else, Pio"</p>

<p>"Yes, you said you loved me."</p>

<p>Lucie was startled by this conversation; had he then, after all,
a soul?</p>

<p>She felt rather ashamed.</p>

<p>He was fiercely sincere, and she was deceiving him for what she
did was not even from motives of pity, but from sheer sense of
duty, the coldest of compassion.</p>

<p>And he counted on her love; in a subtle way Lucie now felt that
she was wronging him by offering him devotion under a false guise;
it added to her trouble.</p>

<p>She became very tender, hoping, as she loved no one (nor was
ever likely to) that she might persuade herself she did love
him.</p>

<p>But that same night he was hunched up in bed again, nursing his
revolver and cursing her as the author of all his miseries.</p>

<p>She thought it was going to be the end that night; her heart
failed her with dread at the things she had to see.</p>

<p>The revolver was tossed about on the coverlet between them like
a child's toy in its cot. With the dawn she got it from him but he
wept for it pitifully and she put it under his pillow.</p>

<p>She was kneeling by his low bed, holding his twitching
hands.</p>

<p>The glorious light of the pure day streamed into his disordered
room and softly touched those two wretched figures in their
dishevelment.</p>

<p>"Pray for me to die," said the sick man. "Pray for me to
die."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch20" id="ch20"></a>Chapter Twenty</h2>

<p class="cpb">&sect; I</p>

<p>PIO had fallen asleep in the downstairs bedroom; it was evening
and Lucie sat at the barred window and watched the fishing
boats.</p>

<p>The room was full of shadow and the light suit and whitish face
of the sick man showed smudged outlined shapes.</p>

<p>Lucie had "Phantastes" on her knees; she was trying to bear
things; it seemed impossible to face the end.</p>

<p>He was so afraid.</p>

<p>She couldn't make him brave.</p>

<p>It would be awful and she would be so alone.</p>

<p>And there would be afterwards, everything there to do alone.</p>

<p>Under those alien eyes.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; II</p>

<p>The holiday-makers were all indoors; presently they would come
out again when the moon was up, but for the moment the sands were
deserted save for the fishermen.</p>

<p>They rowed out casting their nets; the floats were marked with
bunches of fresh greenery that looked like trees growing out of the
smooth pearl-coloured surface of the water; boats and rowers
appeared of a dovelike hue in the twilight, the translucent sky was
pale and tinted as a fading violet.</p>

<p>On the sand a little group waited, dark against the luminous
water.</p>

<p>The scene was curiously beautiful to Lucie; her imprisoned
spirit seemed to leap away, away and sit with the rowers in the
little boat on the wide freedom of the seas.</p>

<p>Ah, to be rowing away, away, towards the sunset&mdash;on the
eternal quest; it may be we shall reach the Fortunate Isles!</p>

<p>Ah, the longing, the yearning, the homesickness of the
soul&mdash;and yet a certain exaltation, as if nothing mattered so
very much and your voyage was sure to come to you, soon or
late&mdash;at the latest not so very long.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; III</p>

<p>Lucie crept into the kitchen to fetch a light, he hated waking
in the dark.</p>

<p>While Marianna lit the lamp, Lucie arranged an enormous lemon, a
bunch of hard green grapes and a white rose on a blue plate; she
took something very like that upstairs every night: she liked to
look at it during the dark hours of her vigil; she thought Pio
liked to look at it too.</p>

<p>"The professor has come back next door," said Marianna.
"Agostino is so pleased. I think he is going to tell him of the
<i>padrone."</i></p>

<p>"What do you mean?" asked Lucie anxiously; she dreaded to hear
of the coming of this learned, eccentric, famous man.</p>

<p>"He is afraid the <i>padrone</i> will die in the middle of the
season and ruin the villa, and he wants the professor to say it is
infectious and that we must go."</p>

<p>"But he can't say that unless he sees the <i>padrone,"</i> said
Lucie anxiously.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;but Agostino means to persuade you to call him
in&mdash;and to persuade him to come, he doesn't take patients
here, you see, he is too rich."</p>

<p>Lucie was used to this kind of intrigue, the Tuscan nature
appeared to delight in them; they were very difficult for a
northerner to combat.</p>

<p>She had always felt that the blind man was dangerous, a secret
enemy working against her in the dark.</p>

<p>"I have always tipped him well," she said desperately, "and the
rent was paid the moment it was due&mdash;and we give no trouble.
So much wants doing to the house, but I have never asked for
anything."</p>

<p>But Marianna understood the situation as viewed by Agostino.</p>

<p>"He does make what he would in the usual way, signora&mdash;and
the other tenants complain, they say they can hear the
<i>padrone</i> coughing from the beach and screaming and swearing
too&mdash;Agostino thinks he is mad."</p>

<p>"But this place is for sick people," said Lucie faintly.</p>

<p>"They don't like people to die here," answered Marianna, "and
then they're frightened of the infection&mdash;the maid of
<i>'l'Americana'</i> next door said she was terrified lest you
should ask her in&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I wonder," interrupted Lucie bitterly, "how they account for it
that I'm not dead."</p>

<p>"They think," replied the servant cheerfully, "that you are sure
to catch it&mdash;I'm often asked if you've begun to spit blood
yet."</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; IV</p>

<p>Lucie now felt herself driven to her last defences; she wished
she had moved from her coveted and conspicuous residence in the
winter when it might still have been possible to find some humbler
place where they would have been unobserved; if they were turned
out now it would be utterly hopeless even to look for rooms or
indeed any accommodation.</p>

<p>The season was very successful and Lucie knew that every bed for
miles round was let at a high price.</p>

<p>Certainly she had the house till next January by a proper
agreement, but if Agostino chose to dispute this she knew of no
means whereby she could resist him; he would have doubtless all his
countrymen on his side, and he had really let the house on false
pretences, since he was assured that the illness was brief and
non-infectious, when in reality it was the one malady of all others
dreaded by the Italians who appeared to think that it spread with
the swift devastation of smallpox or typhus.</p>

<p>Lucie's one hope lay in keeping Professor Ghisleri at bay; she
learnt that he was only there for six weeks and she could only pray
that he would be too occupied with his friends to think of her and
her affairs.</p>

<p>Marianna, however, was not so sanguine. She said Agostino was a
favourite with the great man, who had performed seven operations on
him to preserve the modicum of eyesight he possessed; Dr. Ghisleri
was also unfortunately very interested in the Villa Calvini that
had been built by one of his German friends.</p>

<p>"Agostino is sure, <i>signora,</i> that he will say that the
<i>padrone</i> is to be moved."</p>

<p>"They can't throw us out by force," said Lucie, but in her heart
she feared they could; she no longer had any faith in anything, nor
any expectation of help or sympathy.</p>

<p>It seemed to her that it would be far better if he, in one of
his agonies, should shoot himself and her and send them both into
the oblivion where he would no longer be afraid nor she afraid to
see him afraid.</p>

<p>To what possible purpose was it all being prolonged? What was
the sense of this double martyrdom? What object was there in this
painful sacrifice this anguish of service to an abhorrent disease,
in itself the fruits of f ignorance, folly and vice?</p>

<p>Lucie believed in no faith that could help her to an answer; she
could not even believe in any Power directing it all, any
Intelligence directing human destinies; it seemed to her that
things just happened, as the wind freshened from the sea or died
away, as the stars shone or were veiled by clouds.</p>

<p>Nothing could express the indifference of it all to this sick
man and to herself; her miseries would never be compensated
anywhere, what she had suffered never rewarded; the sunlight mocked
at her penitential days, the pure air that flowed in through her
open window reproached her for the monstrous futility of the vile
tasks that filled her wasted hours.</p>

<p>She knew that she could never be the same after this; everything
seemed petty and meaningless to her now save this kind of inner
life she had led where she tried to find some guidance through the
maze of her material experiences.</p>

<p>She began to see the gibbering shapes the sick man saw, to tread
with him the dark paths opened through the delirium of fever, heat
and alcohol, to feel time and space vanishing into the chaotic
realm of unchecked delusion, phantasmagoria and vision.</p>

<p>She often thought that it was very likely she would die of the
same disease; she was so thin, so exhausted, so giddy&mdash;it
seemed hardly possible that she should escape.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; V</p>

<p>August came in with devastating heat; the fever never left the
sick man now; he scorched all day, writhing like one at the stake,
burnt by his own poisoned blood, groaning, cursing, blaspheming,
whatever had created him for such a fate.</p>

<p>Lucie tried to keep the wine and brandy away from him, but he
would have them, and Marianna was skilful in smuggling them up to
him; in her mistaken devotion she believed that he should "have all
he asked for."</p>

<p>His violence became not a matter of moods but continual; he
overturned most of the food brought him, he smashed his medicine
bottles and glasses, he flung whatever lay nearest to his hand at
Lucie; he gave way to convulsions of sheer fury until he nearly
strangled in a cough.</p>

<p>But what was worse to bear was his constant cry for a doctor;
his demand for help, his pathetic belief that there was someone,
somewhere, and that would not make the effort to find it; no longer
could she make excuses about Dr. Bonami; he had to guess himself
forsaken there, and the knowledge added to his wretchedness.</p>

<p>Lucie had another fear now; he had taken a violent dislike to
Marianna and threatened to shoot her if she came into his room;
Lucie warned the woman but the terror remained; the impulsive
creature might rush upstairs when his bell rang, and he always had
the revolver under his pillow day and night.</p>

<p>Suicide or the murder of herself seemed to Lucie within the
bounds of legitimate tragedy&mdash;but that he should shoot
Marianna and they both live to see it was simply intolerable.</p>

<p>For the first time she had a real fear of the tawdry weapon, and
decided that somehow it must be taken from him.</p>

<p>The flimsy news-sheet that Marianna brought from the Piazza
every morning was now full of a case in which a man suffering from
consumption and neurasthenia had made a holocaust of his family and
servants, shooting down one after the other with an old service
pistol.</p>

<p>Lucie, standing as it were, very much with her back against the
wall, now thought of the man next door.</p>

<p>Hardly a day passed that the blind man did not creep round to
the kitchen window and urge Marianna to send for his master, and
although Lucie read the manoeuvre, she began to see here some
glimmer of hope.</p>

<p>Whatever the attitude of this stranger, he must save her from
the worst; he must get those revolvers away, he must prescribe some
treatment, stop the brandy and give some narcotic; his very
presence in the house would hearten Pio and Marianna.</p>

<p>She would be able to show him, too, the elaborate precautions
she was taking against infection, and, if he insisted that they
leave the Villa Calvini, he would be almost forced to discover some
other asylum.</p>

<p>Even if this was the hospital at Lucca, well, she could take a
room near and go in to see him every day; even that would be better
than what might happen if they went on like this.</p>

<p>It was not an easy thing to do to thus expose herself to a
stranger, one who probably already disliked her and would view her
with prejudice and perhaps animosity, one who would come, as it
were as an emissary of all those alien people whose pleasure was
being spoilt by the tragedy in their midst, and also would only
trouble with her at all to please a favourite servant and to save a
dead friend's home from desecration.</p>

<p>It was the last sacrifice of poor Lucie's pride, and not made
without a struggle.</p>

<p>She told Marianna if Agostino again suggested a visit from his
master to accept; she could not bring herself to send a formal
message.</p>

<p>Professor Ghisleri had been pointed out to her by Marianna when
he was passing from one <i>capuana</i> to another, laughing and
joking with his friends.</p>

<p>Lucie had seen a stout old man in a big Panama with a red face
and a long white beard; he was not, as Marianna said <i>"molto
simpatico,"</i> neither did he look very overbearing.</p>

<p>His own villa was now so overgrown with oleanders that Lucie
could not see anyone moving in the garden, only the glimpse of a
white jacket or muslin skirt between the foliage as his friends
came and went.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; VI</p>

<p>Early one morning Marianna announced that she had delivered the
message (to Lucie like a flag of surrender) to the hateful
Agostino, who had gone off in triumph.</p>

<p>"Of course he won't come for days," said Lucie, "he knows so
many people here."</p>

<p>But she ventured to tell Pio, who was immensely gratified and
received the news, poor wretch, as a new hope.</p>

<p>That day he slept after the midday meal, and Lucie, after
drawing the blinds and arranging the room, went downstairs to sit
with Marianna in the kitchen; she had some work to do, but for the
moment the desire for human companionship was too strong to be
resisted.</p>

<p>Besides she had some of this endless patent food to make.</p>

<p>She had hardly reached the kitchen before the front door
bell&mdash;not that of the <i>cancello</i> on the road, but of that
giving on to the sea&mdash;rang for the first time since Lucie had
been in the Villa Calvini.</p>

<p><i>"Dio bonino!"</i> cried Marianna, rushing out, "it is that
<i>figlio d'un cane</i> hawking fish and he will wake the
<i>padrone</i>."</p>

<p>Lucie went on mixing the brownish paste of the patent food.</p>

<p>In a second Marianna was back, flushed and breathless and wiping
her hands on her apron.</p>

<p>"It is the Professor!" she gasped.</p>

<p>Lucie winced, with the sensation of being taken unawares.</p>

<p>"He must be fond of Agostino," she thought bitterly; aloud she
asked:</p>

<p>"Where is he?"</p>

<p>"Waiting in the <i>salotto, signora."</i></p>

<p>Lucie wanted to ask:</p>

<p>"Does he seem pleasant?"</p>

<p>But she felt that would be too childish.</p>

<p>"Tell him I am coming in a moment," she added and while Marianna
returned to the <i>salotto</i> she crept upstairs.</p>

<p>She was wearing her yellow cotton frock with the full skirt and
cross-over bodice; it was tumbled and her hair was falling down
(she had soft hair that <i>was</i> apt to fall down); she meant to
have made a better appearance before the great man, but she did not
dare to keep him waiting so she just bundled up her hair and washed
her hands. Pio was asleep, and his room, she thankfully noted,
perfectly tidied.</p>

<p>Her heart thumped painfully as she went downstairs. She had
always been socially timid and she had not the courage or one nerve
she had had when she had first entered the Villa Calvini.</p>

<p>As she pushed aside the huge heavy door and entered the large
darkened ( for the shutters were closed) hideous <i>salotto,</i>
she was shivering with a pitiful nervousness.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch21" id="ch21"></a>Chapter Twenty-One</h2>

<p class="cpb">&sect; I</p>

<p>A MAN was standing by the heavy worn red empire divan, not the
man whom Marianna had pointed out but a much younger man of very
remarkable appearance.</p>

<p>Lucie was quite confused; mechanically she asked him to sit
down.</p>

<p>He sat down on the red divan and she on one of the wooden chairs
opposite him.</p>

<p>She did not look at him; the lights were very dim and greenish
as if they were under water.</p>

<p>"Your husband is ill, <i>signora?"</i></p>

<p>She always quick with details, noticed at once that his accent
was not Tuscan, but one that, with her limited knowledge of Italy,
she had never heard before.</p>

<p>"He is very ill. There isn't any hope, really. But he doesn't
know. I want to give him all the hope? can&mdash;he&mdash;he
couldn't stand&mdash;knowing."</p>

<p>"You had Dr. Villa? to him&mdash;and Dr. Bonami?"</p>

<p>Lucie flushed to find him so well-informed; she kept her eyes
averted, a common trick of hers when speaking to strangers.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;they neither cared to come any more. It isn't a
pleasant case." Her pride was making her desperately frank. "I've
no right to suggest you take on any case two other doctors have
dropped&mdash;but? suppose you are too famous to care about
that&mdash;"</p>

<p>She halted&mdash;she was having difficulty with her carefully
rehearsed speech, not saying the things she meant to say and making
mistakes in the foreign language, feeling that she was at her worst
and making a bad impression.</p>

<p>"Why did you send for me?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Agostino continually suggested it-I believe he is worrying
about the house and hopes you will help him-"</p>

<p>"Never mind about that, <i>signora.</i> Tell me about the
case."</p>

<p>His voice was kind and gentle and Lucie sitting awkwardly and
not looking at him told her story.</p>

<p>She told it briefly and unemotionally.</p>

<p>When she had finished he spoke at once.</p>

<p>"Have you any children?"</p>

<p>"I had-she died suddenly-at five months."</p>

<p>He made a little regretful sound.</p>

<p>"Ah, tubercular meningitis?"</p>

<p>A pity.</p>

<p>"Yes-it was a pity," said Lucie dully.</p>

<p>"You look after your husband entirely yourself,
<i>signora?"</i></p>

<p>"Yes." Lucie recalled her fears. "I am very careful-all the
linen is my own. I wash everything infectious myself-the windows
are always open."</p>

<p>"I have observed them."</p>

<p>"I wash the room out with disinfectant every day," she continued
eagerly. "I try to keep him in the back bedroom when the beach is
crowded-I know his cough is bad-"</p>

<p>He rose abruptly and Lucie felt herself snubbed.</p>

<p>"Will you take me up to the patient, <i>signora?"</i> he asked.
"Certainly."</p>

<p>Lucie preceded him upstairs; she was acutely conscious of his
footfalls behind her; she was confused and felt giddy.</p>

<p>Pio was awake; he had evidently sensed the stranger in the
house, for he lay on his side watching the door.</p>

<p>"My husband," said Lucie.</p>

<p>The doctor approached the bed.</p>

<p>"I will see you before I go, <i>signora</i>." He spoke
courteously with an air of dismissal; when she had left the room he
shut the door.</p>

<p>Lucie went downstairs and sat on the red divan in the dim,
<i>salotto,</i> trying to analyze her impressions.</p>

<p>He was of great size; she had never seen or imagined a man of
such a build, as powerful as the Farnese Hercules, and as perfectly
proportioned, so that, while not very tall, he appeared not in the
least clumsy or heavy.</p>

<p>His head and face were of the same noble make, compact,
graceful, flowing and bold in line, tanned to a deep red-brown, his
thick, wavy, yet close-growing hair was a curious ashy gray colour,
with an auburn hue in it; his whole personality was the most vital
thing Lucie had ever met. He wore the usual costume of the
visitors, a shantung suit, shirt and sandals, and he looked as
utterly unlike a doctor or any professional man as could well be
imagined.</p>

<p>Lucie wondered why he had come to the Villa Calvini; she knew
now that it could not possibly be as part of Agostino's
intrigue.</p>

<p>When she heard him coming down the stairs, she went into the
corridor to meet him. Glancing up she saw that Pio's door was
closed, a thing the sick man never permitted.</p>

<p>Lucie waited.</p>

<p>"The young man is dying," he said, "but you knew that."</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Lucie, "how long will it be?" She managed
awkwardly, not looking at him.</p>

<p>"I could not tell. Perhaps some months. There is great
resistance&mdash;great tenacity. I will come again to-night."</p>

<p>This gave Lucie a sensation of pure joy.</p>

<p>"You will really look after him?" she asked incredulously. "As
long as I am here I will come, <i>signora."</i></p>

<p>"And the house?" she asked in her relief. "Will there be any
difficulty about us remaining?"</p>

<p>"Why should there be?" he seemed surprised.</p>

<p>"Agostino seemed vexed&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh! If he bothers, you tell me. He won't, though&mdash;"</p>

<p>With the graceful <i>"a revedula"</i> not to be translated into
any other language, he had opened the heavy doors and was gone.</p>

<p>As he crossed' the little garden he whistled.</p>

<p>It was the whistle of the man Lucie had heard in the spring.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; II</p>

<p>Pio was soothed and gratified by the great man's visit; in some
way the interview seemed to have restored to him some grain of
self-respect, some modicum of self-control; it was a long while
since he had been o amenable.</p>

<p>Marianna also was pleased and excited; the whole household
seemed to have taken on a little dignity, a little composure, to be
rescued somehow from the verge of that howling limbo that appeared
to be engulfing them all.</p>

<p>As Lucie was having her supper at the foot of Pio's bed,
Marianna entered with a cluster of huge white roses; Agostino had
brought them; he had seemed extraordinarily civil.</p>

<p>Pio and Marianna talked with excited enthusiasm of the new
doctor; he was sure that he was going to be cured and she was also
as confident; he overlooked her presence in her room as she
arranged the colours and he questioned her about Professor
Ghisleri.</p>

<p>Lucie sat silent.</p>

<p>She knew the woman knew nothing since she had pointed out the
wrong man and that all the garrulous tales she was reeling off now
were but so many four-hand gossipings of the Piazza.</p>

<p>"He is very fond of the ladies," finished Marianna, with a
vulgar wink.</p>

<p>"Well, there is no one here to attract him," said Pio. "Is he
married?"</p>

<p>"Oh, three or four times over, I think," grinned Marianna, and
she began to relate some voluble scandals that had no sound of
likelihood at all.</p>

<p>"He is coming again this evening," said Lucie. "Don't let him
find us discussing him&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't care what he is as long as he cures me," remarked Pio,
as Marianna went downstairs with the supper tray. "And there is no
need to bother about you&mdash;he won't notice you after all the
women here, and I hope you know how to behave&mdash;you're so
thin," he rambled on peevishly, "and I don't like your
clothes&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't, either."</p>

<p>"I wish you would get something bright."</p>

<p>"How can I, Pio, when you won't let me go into Viareggio?"</p>

<p>"You should have brought more things with you."</p>

<p>Lucie was glad that he was distracted from his own miseries. She
went into her own room and took out the length of green chiffon she
had bought in Viareggio and put it over her shoulders; she wore a
white crepe dress, the one house frock she had brought with her;
she looked, she thought, as she peered at herself in the little
square of mirror above her chest of drawers, "washed out" as her
dress; there was no colour about her save the green jade scarf and
the piled up bright hair.</p>

<p>She was not thinking at all of her appearance; she was very
anxious that Dr. Ghisleri should not think her a fool; she was
anxious that he should approve of the way she had treated her
patient; she hoped, too, that Pio would not make too bad an
impression on him; she very much wanted Pio to be civil and well
behaved.</p>

<p>She had hardly returned to her husband's bedside when she heard
Marianna speaking below and a step on the stair; she did not go to
meet him but remained seated by the window; the room was full of
shadow.</p>

<p>He entered and sat on the edge of the patient's bed, greeting
him pleasantly and easily. Lucie he saluted quickly, then took no
more notice of her; "he does think me a fool," she thought.</p>

<p>Pio, gratified at being the centre of attention, was cheerful,
even amiable; the two talked together as if they were alone in the
room.</p>

<p>Lucie had an extraordinary sensation of the futility, the
frivolity of the whole thing that, up to now, had been so
tremendously important&mdash;the sick man marked for death, his
rows of neat clothes and piles of linen and ties and socks that he
would never wear, hidden away in drawers and cupboards, his shining
ranks of medicine bottles that were of no use to him, all his
glasses, his brandy, his wine, his pitiful array of this and that,
and she, in her last year's frock and twist of cheap green stuff,
how futile, even ridiculous it all was!</p>

<p>It was this man talking so pleasantly, so courteously with that
little strange accent that made it appear so empty and meaningless;
all his movements were serene and noble and grand; in his very
quiet was some immense force; beside him the sick man appeared like
a poor wizened doll and all the furnishings of the room so much
trumpery.</p>

<p>Yet he was not even looking at Lucie and he was talking of
commonplace things&mdash;things that even Pio could understand.</p>

<p>Pio began to tell him of his illness; poor Pio, how childish it
sounded, his ignorant recital of his sordid woes&mdash;his request
of "something for his cough."</p>

<p>Dr. Ghisleri listened with a sweet gravity.</p>

<p>"I will bring you," he said, "something for your cough."</p>

<p>It was so dusk now that Lucie could only see the white glimmer
of his shape, the white length of the bed; she rose to get the
lamp.</p>

<p>"Your wife should go out," said Dr. Ghisleri quietly. "It is
very beautiful in the moonlight."</p>

<p>Pio stared; even to Lucie this was a daring heresy; it was also,
so long since anyone had taken any interest in her, that she was
quite confused.</p>

<p>"She does not care to go out," answered Pio sullenly. "But you
should insist&mdash;no one should remain always in the house. She
never goes out."</p>

<p>"I cannot be left alone," protested Pio, and Lucie, fearing he
would make a display of odious selfishness, spoke; she had lit the
lamp and put on the red shade.</p>

<p>"I get some fresh air on the terrace?&mdash;I go out into the
gardens&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is not enough, <i>signora."</i> He rose. "Downstairs I will
give you a prescription."</p>

<p>"Cannot you give it to me?" asked Pio peevishly, "I do not like
to be left alone."</p>

<p>"I will send the woman up to you&mdash;"</p>

<p>Before the voice of authority Pio was silent; Lucie followed the
doctor downstairs; she was flattered that he wanted to speak to her
yet afraid of some reproof.</p>

<p>All was in darkness downstairs, as Lucie always remained in
Pio's room in the evening, lamps were never lit anywhere else.</p>

<p>"I will get a light," said Lucie.</p>

<p>"There is no need." He turned to the kitchen door and called
Marianna, "sit upstairs a moment or so with your master."</p>

<p>The woman darted away, full of voluble good will.</p>

<p>They went into the <i>salotto</i> where a faint light still
lingered.</p>

<p>"You must get out more," he said urgently, "you cannot long
resist this life."</p>

<p>"I am all right," answered Lucie&mdash;"my husband&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Your husband!" he repeated quickly, "a degenerate&mdash;a moral
imbecile&mdash;he is not responsible&mdash;you know that?"</p>

<p>"He has&mdash;fits," faltered Lucie.</p>

<p>"Epilepsy. He drinks too much, also."</p>

<p>"I know. I have no control."</p>

<p>"I will see he has no more. And all that medicine&mdash;throw it
away."</p>

<p>"He believes in it."</p>

<p>"Is he wealthy?" asked the doctor, abruptly.</p>

<p>"Oh! no!" said Lucie taken aback.</p>

<p>"All those things&mdash;those drugs, wines, spirits, cost a good
deal of money."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I&mdash;" Lucie did not know what to say, the sense
he thought her foolish, hurt.</p>

<p>"Don't waste any more money in that fashion."</p>

<p>She tried to defend herself from the charge of monstrous
ignorance.</p>

<p>"I knew it was all wrong. I wanted to please him."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>Lucie laughed weakly.</p>

<p>"Don't ask me that&mdash;it goes too deep&mdash;I know that what
I'm doing is quite crazy&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, you do know that?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;but there was no other way. Will you give him some
sort of medicine&mdash;just to satisfy him?"</p>

<p>"I will bring something to-morrow." He moved towards the door,
as if impatiently; he crossed the big hall and at the front door
added, "I will think what must be done." Lucie watched him
disappear into the summer gloom.</p>

<p>Marianna, creeping downstairs to say that the <i>padrone</i> was
asleep, asked her if she had remembered to ask the doctor about the
revolvers.</p>

<p>"No," said Lucie. "I forgot."</p>

<p>The revolvers seemed very unimportant.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; III</p>

<p>When she went upstairs she found that Pio had only been feigning
sleep to rid himself of Marianna.</p>

<p>He had a bottle of brandy on the bed and was drinking the
alcohol in a medicine glass.</p>

<p>"Pio, how did you get that?" she asked in dismay.</p>

<p>He explained that he had long had it concealed as a reserve
(where he did not say) and that he was taking it for a pain on the
chest; it had already, he declared, made him feel better.</p>

<p>Lucie had to resign herself; she knew that it was useless to
inflame him by opposition, she hoped he would drink himself into a
stupor.</p>

<p>With unusual pleasantness he discussed his new physician and his
renewed hopes, every few minutes filling up his glass, until the
bottle was half empty; he insisted on his medicine and his Marsala
with the raw eggs, and after he had taken these, he fell into a
deep sleep or swoon, though apparently burning in a high fever.</p>

<p>Lucie went through her usual routine, left the night-light, the
room in order, and went to bed.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; IV</p>

<p>She was now the lightest of sleepers and the faintest sound
roused her; she was soon sitting up on the bed, listening; she was
dressed, for weeks now it had not been worth while to take her
clothes off.</p>

<p>He was moving about his room.</p>

<p>Lucie felt that horrid leap of sheer fear that she never could
quite control when she found herself alone with this man in the
depth of the night, so entirely alone with this awful power of
madness.</p>

<p>She went to his door which stood, as usual, wide open.</p>

<p>He was standing in front of the long mirror in the wardrobe at
the foot of the bed, dressed completely in evening clothes, white
tie, waistcoat and gloves, and he was patting and easing his coat,
that hung loose on his emaciated body, into position, while he
chattered and whispered to himself.</p>

<p>The contrast between his dress and his appearance, so incredibly
wild, ghastly and haggard, the horrible interest he was taking in
himself, that low, incessant, madman's gibber, made Lucie actually
recoil.</p>

<p>He heard her, swung round, drew the small revolver from his hip
pocket and pointed it at her; his face expressed the most
concentrated malevolent hatred.</p>

<p>"Pio, put that down," she whispered thickly. He dropped the
weapon to his side.</p>

<p>"Go and get me some breakfast," he said. "Can't you see it is
getting late?"</p>

<p>Lucie went up to him; he had not stood for so long for days and
she thought he would soon fall.</p>

<p>"There is plenty of time," she said, and took the weapon from
his slack fingers.</p>

<p>"As if I hadn't the razors," he said contemptuously. "Pio, get
into bed you will be so ill to-morrow."</p>

<p>He leant against the side of the cheap Austrian wardrobe; above
the rigid black and white of his dress showed his dreadful hollow
face stained with the colours of decay, his twisted, black, damp
locks, his eyes full of blood.</p>

<p>"I certainly mean to kill you," he muttered. "You are the cause
of all my troubles, you always stand between me and the light."</p>

<p>"I'll get you some coffee," said Lucie. "You would like some
coffee?"</p>

<p>"You've never loved me," he went on, "I certainly have a right
to kill you."</p>

<p>He sank down, exhausted, on the end of the bed.</p>

<p>"Who is that crying?" he asked, "always someone crying! Am I
never to have a moment's peace?"</p>

<p>Lucie went down into the kitchen and made the coffee and carried
it up to him; he was still seated on the end of the bed, lamenting
to himself; she had taken away the little revolver, but he still
had the large one and this he now held across his knee.</p>

<p>He drank the coffee greedily, but, when he had satisfied
himself, he threw cup and pot on to the floor.</p>

<p>It was bright day before she could get his clothes off and
arrange him back in bed.</p>

<p>Marianna was on the Piazza before he slept and she could change
her clothes and stagger downstairs to heat more coffee&mdash;now
for herself.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch22" id="ch22"></a>Chapter Twenty-Two</h2>

<p class="cpb">&sect; I</p>

<p>MARIANNA had set wide the folding doors on to the garden, the
spacious passage was full of sunlight.</p>

<p>But Lucie shivered.</p>

<p>She felt as if all her power of resistance had gone; she had
hardly the strength to make herself the coffee to which she was
looking forward so eagerly.</p>

<p>But she did make it and was drinking it when she heard a tap at
the door; she went into the corridor to see Dr. Ghisleri standing
in the sunshine.</p>

<p>"So early&mdash;" she stammered, dazed, taken aback.</p>

<p>"It is half-past eight, <i>signora."</i></p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;yes&mdash;I rather lost count of time."</p>

<p>She endeavoured to put on an air of formality, she led the way
into the huge, sombre, crowded <i>salotto.</i></p>

<p>"Is your husband asleep?"</p>

<p>"Yes, at last."</p>

<p>She sat on the red divan trying to collect herself, to control
herself; she had never guessed he would come so early, find her so
unprepared, disfigured with fatigue; she had a despairing feeling
that she was going to break down, to give way.</p>

<p>He stood quite near her and she dare not look at him. "You had a
bad night?" he asked gently.</p>

<p>Lucie clasped her hands tightly in her lap.</p>

<p>"He&mdash;he went off his head a little&mdash;it is so
dreadful&mdash;yet funny, that's the worst of him, he can't be
tragic&mdash;he put on his dress clothes and wanted
breakfast&mdash;he didn't know what he was doing&mdash;he has only
just gone to sleep&mdash;"</p>

<p>She was desperately afraid that she was going to laugh and she
knew that if she did all hope of retaining self-control was
gone.</p>

<p>"I nearly came back last night," said the doctor, "why didn't
you send for me?"</p>

<p>Lucie simply hadn't thought of that; she was so used to doing
everything for herself, by herself.</p>

<p>"I never would have thought of disturbing you," she
answered.</p>

<p>"I was awake all night."</p>

<p>"And I am really used to it&mdash;I'm not really afraid&mdash;I
don't think he will ever do anything&mdash;only&mdash;dressed
up&mdash;it was funny."</p>

<p>Her lip began to tremble, she heard her own feeble laughter, she
heard herself saying:</p>

<p>"I do wish I could die&mdash;I do wish I could die&mdash;it
would be so much&mdash;easier."</p>

<p>Almost instantly she caught at her self-control again, in quick
repentance of having thus betrayed herself.</p>

<p>"I really am tired," she faltered, "it has been such a long
strain."</p>

<p>The doctor came and stood in front of her; she looked up; for
the first time she gazed full into his face.</p>

<p>Lucie knew exactly what was going to happen, she thought she had
known it since she had first seen him.</p>

<p>He bent slowly and kissed her gently on the mouth. As he raised
his head, he touched, with a very tender gesture, her shoulder.</p>

<p>"You dear woman," he said.</p>

<p>Lucie could not speak, her thoughts trailed into an incoherency
of bliss; she could not grasp anything but the exquisite pleasure
this man's presence gave her, the astounding ecstasy of his kiss,
his endearment.</p>

<p>Lucie sat still in a childish pose, she felt her hair slip from
its coils down her back.</p>

<p>Pio's bell sounded through the empty house.</p>

<p>The doctor turned to her instantly, as one who had complete
authority over all her actions.</p>

<p>"I will go up. You stay here&mdash;" He used the "thee and thou"
of his beautiful language. "Is the woman back?"</p>

<p>"I hear her in the kitchen&mdash;if you could, would you get his
revolver away&mdash;for his own sake&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He has a revolver?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>He left her and she heard him go into the kitchen and then
ascend the stairs.</p>

<p>She never thought of disobeying him, of rushing upstairs in her
usual fashion, or even of going into the kitchen to help prepare
Pio's breakfast.</p>

<p>Everything was different&mdash;everything always would be
different now.</p>

<p>As surely as any slave sold in the market-place she had changed
masters; it was no longer round that sick man her whole being would
revolve, but round this stranger.</p>

<p>She only knew this very obscurely; she did not reason or analyze
at all, but she was aware of it, in her heart and soul, as a
salient fact.</p>

<p>Already, the monstrous monotony, the hideous routine of the days
had been broken through; Pio had his door shut, she hadn't answered
his bell; presently Marianna came in with food on a tray; her
breakfast&mdash;"the doctor said she was to eat it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"All this trouble for me!" said Lucie; but she made no further
protest.</p>

<p>She was eating when he came down and Marianna was beside her,
gossiping over, quite light-heartedly, the little budget of the
Piazza.</p>

<p>Dr. Ghisleri smiled, as if he was pleased to see her a little
happier.</p>

<p>"I have given him something to make him sleep," he said, "when
he is due to wake, about three, I shall come again. And you must
promise me, <i>signora,</i> that you will sleep."</p>

<p>"Will there really be nothing to do?" asked Lucie.</p>

<p>"Nothing."</p>

<p>"We shall miss the bell," grinned Marianna.</p>

<p>Lucie followed him to the door open on the brilliant sunshine.
She cared for nothing except that he had said that he was coming
again.</p>

<p>They did not look at each other; they parted with a formal
greeting.</p>

<p>Lucie turned to Marianna.</p>

<p>"If the <i>padrone</i> is really comfortable, I think I will
sleep&mdash;' feel giddy."</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; II</p>

<p>She went into her husband's room; the green persiane shutters
were closed and there was a faint aromatic perfume in the air. Pio
lay straight and still, completely at peace; all the medicine
bottles, all the bedside paraphernalia was gone.</p>

<p>Lucie went downstairs again.</p>

<p>"Marianna, where have all the bottles gone?" she asked.</p>

<p>"The doctor told me to throw them all away," said the servant;
she also, it seemed, had gone cheerfully over to the new master.
"And the <i>padrone</i> is not to have any wine or brandy and very
little food."</p>

<p>"I've often told you that," Lucie reminded her.</p>

<p>"But now it is the doctor who says it," replied Marianna with
simplicity. "He got the revolver, too, and the razors."</p>

<p>"Did he?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;didn't you see them in his docket?"</p>

<p>"I didn't notice."</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; III</p>

<p>It all seemed so simple now, so normal and ordinary; the sick
man lay placidly asleep; Marianna went about her work singing;
there was no bell clanging from upstairs, no trays t be carried up,
no long elaborate toilet to make&mdash;(an hour spent perhaps in
dressing a man up and then a hasty tearing of everything off as he
collapsed); she was to have her dinner downstairs; never again,
Marianna told her, was she to eat in the sick-room, the doctor had
said so.</p>

<p>There <i>was</i> actually a little leisure; she could go on the
terrace without being called in; she could stay in the garden
without fear of a scene.</p>

<p>She lay on the red divan and overslept hen usual dinner-hour;
Marianna had to wake her, she sat up, drowsy.</p>

<p>"The <i>padrone</i> has never stirred," said Marianna, joyously.
"Such a wonderful sleep."</p>

<p>Lucie tiptoed up to look at him; it was quite true that he had
not stirred, the very bedclothes were the same.</p>

<p>Lucie ate a better meal than she had done for some time. It had
not been easy to even touch food while Pio was retching and
coughing a foot or so away.</p>

<p>Afterwards she felt less light-headed; she was able to take a
coherent survey of what had happened.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; IV</p>

<p>Lucie tried, deliberately, to damp her own exultation; in cold
blood she dragged out all the conventions, traditions, saws,
maxims, she had somehow absorbed during her youth; she had never
yet, on any occasion lost her head, and she brought out all her
stock of prudence and common sense to prevent her doing so now.</p>

<p>"I've known him about twenty-four hours. I've seen him three
times. I know nothing about him, not even his name or if he is
married. He has the reputation of being eccentric, bizarre, and too
gallant. It is obvious that he is not an ordinary person. I suppose
that it is natural to him to flatter women. I suppose I looked
pitiful, and he was really sorry for me."</p>

<p>She thought of the kiss with tingling amazement. She had always
been so austere in all her ways, so exactly faithful to her husband
that the thing seemed incredible. She remembered how she had felt
bound to Pio by his first kiss, really pledged to marry him because
he had kissed her. She had always been a secret fanatic on the
subject of chastity and fidelity.</p>

<p>Not for a second did she blame Dr. Ghisleri for what had
happened; she knew that she could have prevented it, if she had
wanted to, and that she had not wanted to.</p>

<p>"I must have been very unnerved and overwrought," she thought,
her mind falling into the clichés of the moment, "and what must he
think of me&mdash;that I'm cheap, of course."</p>

<p>Yet there was something in Lucie that took no notice at all of
all this cool clever reasoning, that simply laughed at every truism
she brought forward.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; V</p>

<p>When he arrived, Lucie was very cool and still, her hair and
gown very neat, a piece of needlework in her hands. She met him
herself at the open door and asked him into the dining-room that
had not the informal air of the huge dim <i>salotto.</i></p>

<p>They exchanged commonplaces about the patient, she sitting and
sewing, he standing by the window, but he was not long to be fenced
off with formalities.</p>

<p>"How do you come to be here?" he asked suddenly and
impatiently.</p>

<p>Lucie was always very frank. There was a kind of devastating
honesty about her&mdash;born, perhaps, of defiant desperation.</p>

<p>"There was no one else to do it. The doctors sent him here for
his health. I didn't know it would be so long when I came. Indeed,
I meant to take him back to England&mdash;but he wouldn't go."</p>

<p>"His family?"</p>

<p>"They came&mdash;but they were no use. They were afraid."</p>

<p>"Your family?"</p>

<p>Lucie stitched quickly.</p>

<p>"I haven't any. Not in the ordinary sense like most people. My
father was&mdash;no good; his people never bothered about me, my
aunt did what she could&mdash;her husband was like my father. They
are both dead now&mdash;but we&mdash;never recovered from them. My
father's family are very respectable&mdash;some of them have
money&mdash;they are dreadfully afraid of losing it&mdash;they,
well, they don't really bother about me&mdash;two of them are
doctors, and they did advise me not to come out, there is only my
aunt and cousin. And they have their own troubles, their own
work&mdash;we are professional people and earn our own
livings."</p>

<p>"You&mdash;work?"</p>

<p>"Designing," said Lucie. "I can't do much here, there isn't the
room or the materials, but I draw and write articles and stories. I
do quite well," she added, utterly without satisfaction, "but when
you're a woman, your life mixes your work up, rather."</p>

<p>"I see&mdash;so you earn all the money to keep this going as
well as look after that man upstairs?"</p>

<p>The question was fiercely crude, but Lucie was not offended.</p>

<p>"I had to."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"I am married to him."</p>

<p>"Why did you marry him?" asked Dr. Ghisleri even more
abruptly.</p>

<p>"Well," said Lucie, "I'm a woman, you see&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If you are a woman?" he interrupted. "But you never loved that
man&mdash;do not tell me that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I've never loved anyone," said Lucie, "but I wanted to be
married."</p>

<p>"Why did you choose him?"</p>

<p>"He chose me, that was what I liked. And then I thought I
ought&mdash;to stick to him&mdash;because I'd let him make love to
me. And I thought he was picturesque. Different."</p>

<p>"He is picturesque enough!" said the doctor, grimly. "A woman
like you? Wasn't there anyone to tell you anything?"</p>

<p>"No. I was always free. Independent. No one cared&mdash;no one
had any right to interfere. My aunt just raved against him and that
just made me obstinate. I thought&mdash;quite sincerely&mdash;that
we should be happy. I knew nothing at all about anything."</p>

<p>"And the baby died?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Lucie quickly. "Don't. I've been an irritating fool.
But I've paid."</p>

<p>"That man has been tubercular, obviously, seriously, at least
ten years."</p>

<p>"No one told me. He went to so many doctors and they all said
nerves, bronchitis. When&mdash;the baby was ill, no one told me.
They said she had had a fall. They spoke of germs. I had to
guess&mdash;afterwards. I didn't know he was epileptic. He's always
had fits. I thought them just rage."</p>

<p>"He has been epileptic all his life."</p>

<p>"Well," said Lucie, rising, "I've got to see it through." She
lifted her glance to him where he stood, massive, blocking out the
light.</p>

<p>"You are very unconventional, aren't you?" she added unsteadily.
"I am, too. And I've been tired lately and overwrought." She sought
for her words carefully. "This morning you were very kind. It moved
me, because I've had no one to bother&mdash;don't think I make
anything of it," she finished awkwardly, "or, that it was of the
least importance."</p>

<p>"It was the most important thing that ever happened to you," he
answered, "or to me."</p>

<p>Luck moved to the door.</p>

<p>"You are making&mdash;light&mdash;of me. I think I've deserved
it," she said desperately.</p>

<p>"Are you afraid of me?" he asked.</p>

<p>She turned at that.</p>

<p>"No. Not even of your mockery. Not even of the truth."</p>

<p>"You are."</p>

<p>"No," said Lucie passionately, "I'm not. Nothing more can happen
to me. I'm immune. I've had&mdash;a good lesson. I want just to be
free&mdash;I wish you would leave me alone. You came to see my
husband."</p>

<p>"That damned Sicilian!" he cried hastily. "Do you think he
interests me? I've hundreds a year of such cases. I know these
southerners. I came here to see you, entirely because of you."</p>

<p>"It isn't possible," said Lucie sincerely.</p>

<p>He looked quite grave, but she felt he wanted to laugh, and this
put her more defiantly on her dignity.</p>

<p>She opened the door.</p>

<p>"Will you come upstairs, now?" she added.</p>

<p>"Will you come out with me this evening?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said at once, quite courageously.</p>

<p>He went upstairs; he would not allow her to follow.</p>

<p>"What did you give him?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Morphia," he said grimly. "And it won't be pleasant when he
wakes up."</p>

<p>Lucie waited downstairs; she was in a state of deep agitation,
her main feeling now was anger, she wanted to hurt this man; he
certainly thought she was "cheap"; that feminine bugbear oppressed
her terribly.</p>

<p>She had only a moment more alone with him before he left; then
he said "goodbye" at the door.</p>

<p>"I have told your husband I am taking you out this evening. What
is your name?"</p>

<p>She told him, and they looked at each other and laughed.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch23" id="ch23">Chapter Twenty-Three</a>
</h2>

<p class="cpb">&sect; I</p>

<p>LUCIE, with her ingrained habit of looking at things from other
people's point of view, felt that Pio dad been very summarily
treated; she knew that never would he have consented to such
monstrous innovations on the tyranny of his days, if he had not
been both relieved and dazed by the morphia.</p>

<p>When he aroused from the drug, he was dull and drowsy and showed
no resentment for the loss of his medicines or his weapons, made no
protest as to Lucie's change of habits, nor any protest against her
going out.</p>

<p>But Lucie knew that he was passive merely because he was dazed
and she was sorry for him; nothing is more pitiful than a fallen
tyrant, and this one had been so utterly deposed; he was now
completely in the power of the stranger, as completely as Lucie had
been in his.</p>

<p>He asked for more morphia and showed impatience for the arrival
of the doctor; yet when he came Pio shrank from the hypodermic
needle; Lucie had to allow it to be plunged into her arm to show
that it didn't hurt and then it took half-an-hour's coaxing and
reasoning to induce him to receive the relief for which he
longed.</p>

<p>Lucie stood by the window watching the moonlight on the sea,
listening to the doctor's infinite patience, gravity and sweetness
with the poor creature he was trying to help; it seemed impossible
not to believe that he was intensely interested in the case and
deeply devoted to the patient.</p>

<p>At last the sick man was asleep, free for a while again from his
misery; the doctor carefully put his things away; Lucie poured out
water and he washed his hands. "Now we will go out," he said.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; II</p>

<p>It was a most extraordinary sensation to Lucie to pass into the
freedom of the sands and the vastness and the night; it seemed
absurd that a few months confinement could have produced this sense
of strangeness in everything; she had never walked along the sands,
nor, indeed, been anywhere save those hurried rushes to
Viareggio.</p>

<p>The moon was full and shining just above the placid waters; the
waves breaking on the smooth sand made a delicate sound; there was
no other.</p>

<p>They turned towards Fiumetto, walking slowly by the edge of the
water; Lucie had a thin peacock blue cloak over her cotton dress;
it was very old but she liked the colour; as they walked, she kept
looking back at the light in the open windows of the Villa Calvini,
the light in her husband's room.</p>

<p>"Why do you do that?" asked Dr. Ghisleri. "He is not so
important."</p>

<p>"He is very important," said Lucie, "to me."</p>

<p>"You are merely wasting time, health and money," he replied.
"The man ought to have been dead a year ago. You've kept him alive
artificially&mdash;and why? There is nothing in the fellow. Nothing
at all."</p>

<p>Lucie was shamed by this and it made her hard.</p>

<p>"Why did you give him morphia?" she asked, quickly. "T? give you
a little peace," he answered.</p>

<p>"Is it better for him?"</p>

<p>"Oblivion is better than suffering."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;it can't be for long, can it? Unless it is all over
very soon&mdash;won't it be worse?"'</p>

<p>"I shall increase the dose," he answered, as if amused, "and
what do you know about it?"</p>

<p>"Well," said Lucie, "you are going away next month, aren't
you?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Up the mountains," he answered quickly.</p>

<p>"And I shall be left alone again. I was thinking of the
morphia."</p>

<p>"I will show you how to administer it&mdash;but I hope he will
be at peace before then&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He won't," answered Lucie, "and you know he won't. Didn't I say
he was tremendously important?"</p>

<p>"To us?"</p>

<p>"To me, at least."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid it is the same thing."</p>

<p>"No," said Lucie, looking at the moon, "you are free.
<i>Really</i> free. Like a man always is. I think you have always
been free. And proud of it."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And I haven't. I'm waiting to see what it will be like. I've
always been independent financially, and free of
relations&mdash;but tied up&mdash;with sentiments."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>He was troubled, she thought, and agitated, but she did not look
at him, but always at the moonlit sky and water on her right
hand.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;just this. You're so free and I am on such a tight
chain&mdash;we can't be friends."</p>

<p>He was silent; they were walking very slowly.</p>

<p>"I'm not quite the same as all the other women," continued
Lucie.</p>

<p>"Which other women?"</p>

<p>"The other women you've&mdash;kissed."</p>

<p>"No, you are not," he agreed gravely.</p>

<p>"I'm not really light or easy. You'll smile, but it is true. So
it wouldn't be quite fair for you to behave as if I was&mdash;just
because I interest you and the situation is&mdash;queer."</p>

<p>She could not say any more and he did not speak so they walked
in silence till they saw the little stream glittering in the
moonlight.</p>

<p>"I must get back," said Lucie.</p>

<p>They turned; she saw that she had impressed and even saddened
him, disturbed his gay serenity.</p>

<p>She had spoilt, deliberately and cruelly, the wonder of their
meeting, spoilt the enchantment, defied the magic; and this in
defiance of her own heart, which she held in
abeyance&mdash;desperately.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; III</p>

<p>For her feeling for him was one of complete worship and
adoration; she had never believed it possible that any such
emotion, so sudden, so powerful, could possess her; she had never
met anyone for whom she had even faintly, felt what she felt for
this man; his extraordinary strength of mind and body, his
knowledge, his air of power and composure, his health and gaiety,
the position he held, rich in honour, friends, authority, the
sweetness and charm of his overwhelming personality completely
enthralled her; it was because she was so utterly his that she made
this stand for her own individuality, that she tried to hurt him to
balance her own secret hurt which was the certainty that he did
hold her "cheap," that she was to him but a passing interest.</p>

<p>Too soon they reached her gate; Lucie felt the chill over her
spirit strengthen as she looked up at the open window, the shrouded
light of her husband's room.</p>

<p>Her freedom had been so short; they had not been away from the
house half an hour; her heart failed at the thought of going back
again.</p>

<p>At that moment she wished that he had left her undisturbed in
the dull resignation of her former misery.</p>

<p>He stood, downcast, holding the gate open for her; he, so
magnificent, so free, whose life was so full, downcast because of
her&mdash;it seemed fantastic.</p>

<p>"Are you suffering?" asked Lucie, incredulous yet
triumphant.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, and left her quickly.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; IV</p>

<p>Lucie had satisfied her creed, mollified her traditions,
conventions, re-established her pride.</p>

<p>He would understand now that she was a virtuous woman and that
she would by no means become one of the figures in those episodes
Marianna used to gossip over; it would have been quite unbearable
if he had thought her capable of a light love affair.</p>

<p>But it was equally unbearable to let him go like that.</p>

<p>She felt that after her rebuke (clumsily administered, it seemed
to her now, and priggish), he would not trouble about her any more;
he would look after Pio, formally, till he had to go away and then
there would be an end.</p>

<p>Pio did not disturb her that night, but Lucie did not sleep
well.</p>

<p>Dr. Ghisleri did not come next morning; Lucie performed her sick
room duties mechanically; Pio was quiet, drowsy, seemed better; he
was openly impatient for his new saviour and wanted Marianna to
fetch him.</p>

<p>But this Lucie would not allow; if he was coming on a formal
footing she had no right to expect even a daily visit; there was no
actual need of him.</p>

<p>She told Pio this.</p>

<p>"It is quite a concession that he comes at all. He has been very
good."</p>

<p>"Good?" said Pio peevishly. "I suppose I shall have to pay
him!"</p>

<p>Pio's point of view generally came as a shock to Lucie. "I
hadn't thought about the paying part," she said. "No. You are
always so extravagant. Who is to give me the hypodermic if he
doesn't come?"</p>

<p>"I can."</p>

<p>"Indeed not. I wish to have proper attendance. If the man is
paid he'll do what he's paid for."</p>

<p>Paid? What could anyone pay such a man that would equal the
value of his mere presence in the room, his word, his look, his
smile?</p>

<p>"I shall certainly send for him," grumbled Pio. "It is not right
that I should be left like this."</p>

<p>Lucie did not remind him that he had been left altogether by his
other doctors and that he had shown no surprise, nor gratitude nor
any acknowledgment to her for the help she had now procured.</p>

<p>While he lay and complained and coughed and groaned, she sat at
the open window, her silly bit of white embroidery in her hands;
every time she raised her eyes from this she could see Dr. Ghisleri
moving about among the <i>capuane</i> and the groups of bathers,
laughing, talking and joking with them all; he seemed to know
everyone and to be welcomed eagerly everywhere; what was so alien
to Lucie was his world in which he was so important, flattered and
popular. Lucie watching him, knew that he would be important,
flattered, a remarkable and conspicuous figure anywhere; there was
not a man in the company among which he moved to compare with him,
his perfect physique, so massive and so graceful, the noble
handsomeness of his features was less extraordinary than his
personality, the impelling charm that was so personal to himself,
his air of splendour and yet simplicity.</p>

<p>His titles of "doctor" and "professor" seemed absolutely
ridiculous.</p>

<p>He looked more like a soldier, a traveller or a man of great
affairs.</p>

<p>One of the women detached herself from her friends and joined
him, as he wandered among the bathers; she wore white lace through
which the sunshine moved and carried a parasol like a half-closed
rose.</p>

<p>Lucie put down her work and watched the couple in their idle
sauntering.</p>

<p>The woman was talking on in an animated fashion and his manner
was very gallant; presently they crossed the sands and disappeared
in the garden of his villa.</p>

<p>Lucie left the window.</p>

<p>He had everything and she nothing; he must see, a dozen times a
day, women more delightful, more beautiful than she was, while she
saw nothing but this sick man.</p>

<p>Any transient interest he felt in her must soon pass when he
compared her with those other women; she had no chance, no weapons,
not even a pretty gown, a little leisure, a pleasant background;
she must be associated with sickness, a gloomy shabby house,
trouble and distress.</p>

<p>She sat by Pio's bedside till he went to sleep, grumbling still,
then she went out on to the terrace that overlooked the Villa
Ghisleri; the pink parasol was moving among the oleanders and rose
bushes.</p>

<p>She heard the woman's laughter; the moment was very bitter.</p>

<p>"But it is better than if I had let him go on pretending, better
than giving everything for nothing."</p>

<p>She had to hold on to her old creed:</p>

<p>"Everything is over for me. And it doesn't matter."</p>

<p>But she could not long remain on the balcony and listen to that
light laughter; she returned to her vigil by her husband, who
tossed and groaned and muttered in his sleep; then she crept
downstairs to arrange some food for his awaking; on the half-way
landing Marianna met her.</p>

<p>"The doctor is in the <i>salotto.</i> He wants to see you,
<i>signora,</i> before he goes upstairs."</p>

<p>An agony of exultation, of dread, swept over Lucie&mdash;he had
come&mdash;he was going to say he wouldn't come again.</p>

<p>She entered the <i>salotto</i> and he was standing where he had
stood the first time they had met.</p>

<p>"I thought I should never get rid of that chattering magpie," he
said. "You must have wondered why I did rift come."</p>

<p>His direct simplicity made her complicated emotions appear a
paltry confusion.</p>

<p>"I did not really expect you," said Lucie. "Will you come up? He
is just asleep."</p>

<p>"The better for all of us," answered Dr. Ghisleri, impatiently.
"No, I will not go up. I came to see you."</p>

<p>"I thought you wouldn't bother with me any more," answered
Lucie. In her heart she was thinking wildly, "supposing I don't
evade or refuse this any more? Supposing I just face it
out&mdash;to the most, or the least it is going to be?"</p>

<p>As if he read her thought, he appealed to her:</p>

<p>"Be frank with me&mdash;you must be frank with me."</p>

<p>"I'm trying," answered Lucie, "I'm trying to be frank with
myself. It is difficult."</p>

<p>"To me," said the man impatiently, "it is simple. Are you still
afraid that I don't know what kind of woman you are? As well try to
teach a gardener the difference between a lily and a rose!"</p>

<p>"Then," said Lucie, quickly and unsteadily, trying to put into
words more than novels could convey, "if you do understand, what
are you going to do with me?"</p>

<p>"We can be friends," his agitation was as great as hers, through
her own distress she marked that with amazement. "I am much older
than you&mdash;I can help you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We can be friends."</p>

<p>"You don't want that?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't want that."</p>

<p>"You know it isn't possible," said Lucie in despair. "What do
you want then?"</p>

<p>She looked at him.</p>

<p>"I want you to stay away."</p>

<p>"That isn't possible, either."</p>

<p>"Just came to see him. 'Please go up now. Please do." He
hesitated a second, then went; she heard him whistling softly as he
ascended the stairs.</p>

<p>Lucie sat on the hard, shiny, red divan, trembling, shivering;
it was as if he had bewitched her; not only had he made clear to
her what she wanted, he had nearly made her say so.</p>

<p>And she kept telling herself that it wasn't possible any of it
meant anything to him.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch24" id="ch24">Chapter Twenty-Four</a>
</h2>

<p class="cpb">&sect; I</p>

<p>LUCIE had said that Pio was very important and she had no other
idea beyond acting as if he still was the centre of her existence;
the day revolved round him as usual; but in her own mind he had
sunk into complete insignificance; so had the letters from home;
that day she had received the usual kind, warm epistle from Mrs.
Falconer, and one of Sophie's ill-spelt illiterate scrawls, full of
stilted phrases and unreal sentiments; neither meant anything at
all.</p>

<p>The old world seemed alien beyond expression; nothing mattered
save herself and this man. He was coming again this evening; before
then she had to reason out things with herself.</p>

<p>Pio gave no trouble, the hours were suddenly blank of
employment; in the <i>salotto</i> she sat working at her design for
a book-cover, trying to reason it out.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; II</p>

<p>It wasn't easy to reason out a tumult of emotion, you became to
feel that your logic was out of place, that your arguments were
feeble and ineffective.</p>

<p>What standard were you arguing from, to begin with? Did any of
the old rules, the ancient conventions, fit your case?</p>

<p>You couldn't talk of temptation of the devil when you didn't
believe in the devil, any more than you could think about God
watching you when you didn't believe in that kind of a God.</p>

<p>You couldn't pretend that the civil ceremony in a London
registry office, had anything in it of a sacred sacrament, you
hadn't made any vows at any altar.</p>

<p>Yet you had given years of your life, your money, your time,
your submission, to a man who had never done anything for
you&mdash;not even been tender or kind or civil; because of you he
had lived in ease and comfort, even luxury, he had received
consideration and respect...but for you he would now be in a
hospital with paupers.</p>

<p>Because of his obstinate ignorance about his own health you had
lost your child and were precluded from others; you had been
married in name only for a long time now; the man was a stranger,
he repelled you, you disliked him; yet you had served him in the
most menial capacity, you had tended him at the risk of a violent
death.</p>

<p>You were his wife.</p>

<p>All tradition, custom, laws, written and unwritten, held you in
your place.</p>

<p>But supposing that all these same traditions, customs and laws
were really, in these times and circumstances, just so much junk
that should be cast aside as rubbish?</p>

<p>Your marriage wasn't like the marriages for which those laws
were made; those marriages, at the worst, fed, sheltered, protected
the women; you had had nothing; everything your husband possessed
you had paid for; his house, his servant, his clothes, his
medicines, you paid for them all, and you never let anyone know,
his pride was intact he was "the master."</p>

<p>Could he ask more than this?</p>

<p>Was your very soul his, too?</p>

<p>It seemed grotesque to suppose it...and yet...you couldn't tell.
You didn't know.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; III</p>

<p>The doctor came again that evening and sat with the patient for
an hour, talking, smiling, interesting, amusing, heartening the
sick man; he had brought him books and a bottle of pungent,
aromatic perfume, and he told him that he must get well and come
sailing with him and playing bowls on the sand.</p>

<p>And Lucie sat dutifully with her sewing, trying to understand
him, trying to understand herself.</p>

<p>Presently when they seemed completely absorbed in their talk,
she stepped out on to the terrace, leaving the door open behind
her; there, standing in the moonlight by the low stone parapet, she
could hear the voices and see the warm coloured room, the white
bed, the man in white sitting beside it, the white roses; beyond
all, flashed an amber yellow from the golden silk shade she had put
on the lamp.</p>

<p>From the doctor's conversation she learnt (and noted very
eagerly) something of his career.</p>

<p>She gathered that he was north Italian and had been educated in
Venice; she should have known, she thought, that he was no Tuscan,
the type of the man was Teutonic, not Latin.</p>

<p>He spoke enthusiastically of the Apennines and Monte Altissimo
where he was soon going with his friends. He had a passion for the
mountains.</p>

<p>She heard Pio ask peevishly:</p>

<p>"And what will become of me when you go away?"</p>

<p>"You will be cured long before then," answered the doctor,
lightly.</p>

<p>But Pio continued grumbling; he was becoming restless and asked
for the morphia, but he wanted the needle tried on Lucie first.</p>

<p>"I am neurasthenic," he reminded the doctor, "and? cannot stand
any shocks."</p>

<p>"It is perfectly true, and I will fetch the <i>signora."</i></p>

<p>He came instantly on the balcony; Lucie did not move.</p>

<p>"Will you come out again afterwards?" he asked in a low voice.
"I think I deserve it."</p>

<p>"I'll come," whispered Lucie.</p>

<p>She followed him back into the room; he filled the syringe with
water and she put out her arm.</p>

<p>Pio, propped up with pillows, stared at them with eyes that
seemed smudged in charcoal in his livid face.</p>

<p>This time he did not know that she was going out; probably he
didn't care, but Lucie felt guilty towards him; this irritated her
but she could not suppress the feeling; it was monstrous too that
he should lie there absorbed in his own failing body, cringing away
from a pin prick while she was so shaken by a tempest of
emotion.</p>

<p>"I must have ether," Pio was saying, "you promised me ether
to-night&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I have brought it," replied Dr. Ghisleri, "so perhaps we
<i>can</i> spare the <i>signora?"</i></p>

<p>"No&mdash;Lucie does not mind, she isn't sensitive and you can
tell best that way if the needle is too sharp."</p>

<p>The doctor took Lucie's fair fragile arm in his large shapely
skilful hand and turned back her sleeve, above the elbow.</p>

<p>It was the first time he had touched her since he had kissed
her; they had never shaken hands.</p>

<p>To Lucie the moment was almost unbearable; it seemed impossible
that Pio should be unaware of the feeling that seemed to fill the
very air.</p>

<p>She felt the doctor's hand fluttering on her arm; he seemed
struck with distressing agitation.</p>

<p>"I cannot do it," he said and dropped her arm. "The signora is
too thin," he added to Pio.</p>

<p>The sick man swore.</p>

<p>"Not so thin as I am!"</p>

<p>"But for you it is necessary," replied Dr. Ghisleri sternly,
"for her it is not."</p>

<p>Pio gave way, whimpering, and Lucie saw the other man shoot him
a glance in which passionate contempt, hatred and impatience were
for one second revealed.</p>

<p>But he was instantly pleasant and gentle again and Lucie could
barely detect the effort with which he bade her wait outside.</p>

<p>"Our presence upsets your husband," he said, very
courteously.</p>

<p>Lucie went downstairs and out into the garden. She sat on the
wooden seat beneath the euonymus hedge, under the pines. The bats
were flying and looked up at the yellow square of light in the open
window.</p>

<p>She could not think at all; her whole being was absorbed by some
unnameable sensation which she could barely control.</p>

<p>She watched the window.</p>

<p>Presently the shutters were lightly closed.</p>

<p>Lucie shuddered as she gazed through the open door. He came
down, he called out "good night" to Marianna and she answered
cheerfully from the kitchen.</p>

<p>He came into the garden; Lucie rose and they went in silence out
to the sands.</p>

<p>"How long," he asked, with a kind of soft violence, "do you
think I can go on like this?"</p>

<p>"A man like you," said Lucie desperately&mdash;"you&mdash;you
must be used to it&mdash;I can't believe it means so much to
you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A man like me!" he repeated, "what do you think I am."</p>

<p>"I can't argue," answered Lucie, "and I can't walk. I'm
tired."</p>

<p>"Come to the sea."</p>

<p>The moon was behind a cloud now and they stool in soft warm
darkness; Lucie felt the dry spikes of the sea lavender drag at her
thin skirt.</p>

<p>They went to the <i>capuana,</i> the only one that was never
used.</p>

<p>"Is it yours?" he asked.</p>

<p>"For him?"</p>

<p>"Yes. A senseless extravagance," she admitted, "but he likes to
keep it on. He likes to think he will be well enough to use
it."</p>

<p>"You're crazy," he said and repeated again and again <i>"sei
matto, sei matto."</i></p>

<p>They found the wooden step and mounted to the little platform
with the open rail in front of the one room bathing hut; it was not
locked and he opened the door and brought her out one of the hard
wooden chairs.</p>

<p>Lucie sat near the rail and listened to the swish of the sea; it
was high tide and the waves broke almost at the foot of the
<i>capuana.</i></p>

<p>He leant against the rail and she could just see the glimmer of
his white coat.</p>

<p>One or two people passed, dim shapes that laughed and talked in
the darkness; the moon gleamed again for a moment and was gone
beneath the deep, troublous, swift-moving clouds.</p>

<p>Out of the sick room, out of the house, Lucie felt more at
peace.</p>

<p>No one claimed her here; she had at least the semblance of
freedom.</p>

<p>The man beside her was quite silent; a few drops of rain began
to fall; the few people abroad turned back to the lighted villas;
several passed the hut where these two remained motionless.</p>

<p>"How I like the rain!" he said quietly. "How I like the rain on
the mountains, or on the sea!"</p>

<p>His voice seemed different to the voice of the man who had
spoken to Pio; the clouds gathered closer over the moon, the rain
fell faster, yet still only sparsely so that the drops might almost
be counted.</p>

<p>Suddenly and yet gently he put his arm round her and, drawing
her close to him, kissed her; from his hair, his clothes, his whole
person came the perfume of the sun, the open air, the sea; he was
redolent of all the fragrance of nature; beneath the thin silk of
his jacket, Lucie felt the powerful structure of his body and the
heavy beating of his heart.</p>

<p>"Why do you do this to me?" she whispered, "after what I
said?"</p>

<p>"Because I am a man and you are a woman," he answered
simply.</p>

<p>Lucie would not yield; she was obstinate in her denial of the
truth.</p>

<p>"Tell me what you mean," she said insincerely; for she knew it
all, without words.</p>

<p>He released her and sat on the top step of the little ladder
that led to the sands; he raised her foot and slipped the shoe off
and kissed her high instep; he began to talk to her; the passionate
lovely words of his beautiful language flowed round her like music
in the darkness; he praised her, he extolled her; his words seemed
to robe and crown her; he told her again and again and again that
he loved her...loved her...loved her.</p>

<p>Lucie was amazed, incredulous, cowardly; she sat hunched up,
rigid, not daring to believe it true; trying to discount it by all
her dusty little precepts, her anaemic rules, her lifeless
conventions.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; IV</p>

<p>Were you so ignorant, so befogged, so occupied with your
pinch-beck virtues, so absorbed in unreal stupid artificialities,
so besotted with your tiny world that you thought passion was
extinct, that you could not believe men ever spoke to women like
this?</p>

<p>Have the giggles and leers of fools, the idiotic jests of
degenerates, the froth and fume of lies, written, spoken, the
jingle of clipped slang, the hooting laughter of the diseased, so
deceived, chilled and beggared you that you may not see the God
unveiled?</p>

<p>So fooled you that you try to turn aside&mdash;to evade&mdash;to
be suspicious, even to cheapen and deride, to say&mdash;"it cannot
be true&mdash;things like this don't happen."</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; V</p>

<p>She had not the courage to believe him; to believe herself; she
tried to remember all she had heard of men who "made love" easily,
of the fate of women who made themselves "cheap"; she still could
not get away from that ridiculous value she put on herself and her
irreproachable virtue.</p>

<p>"My darling," he called her and "my treasure, my life, my love,"
and more sweet to her, <i>"donna mia, donna mia";</i> he said her
hair was gold and silver and coffee mingled; he said she walked as
if she was leading a dance of the Gods; he said she was an empress
among women, and to all ages, all eternities, "his, his."</p>

<p>And still Lucie crouched on her chair and did not answer. The
rain drops had ceased and a little wind had risen, so that the
waves fell with a louder sound.</p>

<p>With the most delicate tenderness he passed his hand over her
slim foot, and kissed the hollow of her instep; she felt the caress
through every fibre of her body.</p>

<p>"Why don't you speak to me, darling?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid it isn't true&mdash;it can't be&mdash;I could not
bear that long silence."</p>

<p>She was sure he smiled; he put on her shoe very deftly and she
rose.</p>

<p>"You said you weren't afraid of anything," he said gently.</p>

<p>"Now I am&mdash;afraid."</p>

<p>"Of what? I am here," he answered sweetly, "and you need no
longer be afraid of anything."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid it isn't true&mdash;it can't be&mdash;I could not
bear that you should jest with me&mdash;I couldn't bear it," she
whispered. "Don't you see? That makes me a fool. I am. You said so.
Crazy. I&mdash;I wish I could play too&mdash;like you do. I can't.
I'm too crude. Don't come after me. I can't believe it."</p>

<p>She passed him swiftly as he stood on the step; he called her
name sharply; she ran back to the house; the Italian <i>"scherzo"
"scherzo"</i> was ringing in her head: "think how often he has said
that&mdash;to other women&mdash;and meant it as much...or as
little...I wish I was beautiful...more beautiful than them all...to
make him suffer...like this."</p>

<p>She knelt by the bed and clutched at the cheap cotton coverlet.
She buried her face in the coarse sheet.</p>

<p>"My God! My God!" The conventional exclamation came,
unconsciously, "if it could be true one day, I'd gladly die the
next&mdash;just one day."</p>

<h2><a name="ch25" id="ch25">Chapter Twenty-Five</a>
</h2>

<p class="cpb">&sect; I</p>

<p>DR. GHISLERI came the next morning punctually to the Villa
Calvini; he went straight upstairs without waiting for Lucie and
attended to his patient with his usual careful, pleasant serenity,
his usual delicate skill and gentle kindness.</p>

<p>Lucie was in the room waiting on him quietly, bringing what he
needed, answering his questions; he took no more notice of her than
if she had been a hired nurse.</p>

<p>Lucie was sure that he meant to "have done with her" and that
her second desperate repulse was the final one.</p>

<p>And when he had finished his utmost for Pio, answered his
rambling questions, soothed his fears, listened to his complaints
with that sweet comprehending gravity that was so entirely lovable;
he said, still ignoring Lucie:</p>

<p>"I am afraid that I shall not be able to come to-night nor
to-morrow. I am making one of a party for a fishing expedition
to-night. And to-morrow I go up the mountain for several days. A
long standing arrangement, my friends count on me."</p>

<p>"But you are coming back?" asked Pio surprised and vexed.</p>

<p>"I am not quite sure. I am due at my hospital in a week or so.
But I am lending my villa to a colleague of mine who will look
after you."</p>

<p>He rose.</p>

<p>"Please, <i>signora,</i> do not let me disturb you. Do not come
down with me."</p>

<p>He had not even looked at her but she understood him
perfectly.</p>

<p>This was the end; she might never see him again.</p>

<p>He had extricated himself deftly and cleverly (never could he do
anything clumsily), and there was no more to be said, though there
would be a great deal more to be suffered.</p>

<p>Not by a glance nor an inflection did she seek to detain him;
she let him leave the room, she heard him cross the garden,
listened for the gate closing behind him; an unbearable sound. It
was over.</p>

<p>"I wonder what would have happened if I hadn't been afraid?"</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; II</p>

<p>It was very hot; the line of the sea glittered into the sky in
one dazzle, the sand sparkled white, in lounging attitudes the
bathers lay about beneath their tents or parasols or in their
painted boats.</p>

<p>Marianna kept washing the tiled floors over with water which
dried immediately; the green <i>persiane</i> were kept closed, the
striped cotton curtains hung in the still air before the open front
door.</p>

<p>Lucie went about her duties mechanically; all the time, her
attention was devoted to the sick man; none of her thoughts were
with him.</p>

<p>She realized, in a detached sort of way, that there were many
things she might do&mdash;things that, she believed, other women in
her place would do.</p>

<p>She might send for Dr. Ghisleri; under the excuse of her
husband's illness, she could do so quite easily, and he could
scarcely refuse to come; she might even go to his house as she saw
so many others going, or wander on to the sands and meet him there;
but it was not possible for her to even contemplate any action;
emotionally she was purely feminine; without great violence to her
own feelings she could not be anything but passive; it never
occurred to her to create scenes; she simply did not know how to;
neither could she "flirt" or coquet, endeavour to chain or
enslave.</p>

<p>He had ended it and she had accepted that as final.</p>

<p>Agostino came that afternoon to fetch some sun umbrellas. He was
full of the all-night fishing trip, he repeated several times that
his master was going away up the mountains.</p>

<p>He seemed elated, to rejoice that his master was free and going
to prove it; he said that his master was always fascinated by the
<i>"belle blonde,"</i> but that the fascination never lasted long.
He recounted with relish the many hearts he had broken.</p>

<p>Lucie, waiting with the keys of the shed while he and Marianna
found the umbrellas, listened and understood. The man owed her a
grudge, his master also; he had hoped that Professor Ghisleri would
move the sick man, instead of which he had been attracted by the
fair-haired English woman; and now that was over and he was going
away.</p>

<p>"You are fond of your master?" asked Lucie.</p>

<p>The man's harsh face, weather-beaten, vicious with the filmed,
almost sightless eyes, turned to her with a repulsive leer.</p>

<p>"He is a great man, <i>signora."</i></p>

<p>"Is he married?" asked Marianna.</p>

<p>"Married!" Agostino laughed, "No."</p>

<p>"A pity," said Marianna, "a fine man like that&mdash;" Lucie
locked the shed and they turned into the house.</p>

<p>She went upstairs leaving the man gossiping with Marianna over a
glass of wine...boasting of his master and how "free" he
was&mdash;</p>

<p>Yes, he was free enough; the sea and the mountains were his and
all the world; she had just this sick-room.</p>

<p>How long the sunny hours seemed and how purposeless.</p>

<p>When at last she could open the shutters on the cool of the
twilight, she saw him on the sands playing bowls with a boy and two
women; she wondered if he had ever spoken to either of them as he
had spoken to her last night.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; III</p>

<p>Towards night Pio became restless and wanted more morphia; waves
of fever surged over him and his cough came on in strangling
convulsions; he became very angry that he was denied wine or
brandy.</p>

<p>Lucie would have to give him the drug herself for the first
time; she thought of this with nervousness, she hoped that he might
sleep without it.</p>

<p>About the time that it was due, he did in fact fall into a half
delirious sleep; Lucie had everything ready but she resolved not to
give him the drug while he was unconscious.</p>

<p>She put out her lamp and lit the night-light. Leaning in the
wide-flung window she could see the boats rowing out to the fishing
schooner with the lantern at the mast; hear the men singing and
laughing in sheer gaiety of heart.</p>

<p>The now waning moon was mounting a dusky space filled with
silver fire, her image broke into a path of gleaming patines on the
dark water; the songs and the laughter fell more faintly on her
listening ear; the ship with the lantern moved away further and
further, till it was a twinkle like a fallen star on the most
distant verge of the sea.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; IV</p>

<p>Pio woke and screamed out for her; Lucie sprang from her bed and
hurried to his bed that showed white and stark in the full moon
beam.</p>

<p>"Don't leave me. Don't leave me," he whimpered.</p>

<p>"I am here, Pio," she said, "what is the matter?"</p>

<p>"I thought you had gone away. And there are so many hideous
things in the room."</p>

<p>She sat on the edge of the bed and put her arm round his ruined
body.</p>

<p>"Don't think of the hideous things, Pio," she said passionately.
"Look outside, the moon, the sea, look how beautiful it is. There
isn't any evil anywhere."</p>

<p>He seemed soothed; his burning head with the lank, sweat-soaked
hair, drooped against her cool shoulder in the thin muslin
night-dress; his awful breathing (it seemed as if the air bubbled
in his chest) echoed through her body.</p>

<p>"They have run on to the terrace now," he muttered, "but they
are waiting for me."</p>

<p>"There is nothing there but the moon, Pio&mdash;so old and
calm."</p>

<p>He moved restlessly.</p>

<p>"What is that smell? Disinfectant&mdash;a different one."</p>

<p>"Yes. It is what Marianna washed the floors with. It is quite
pleasant."</p>

<p>"It reminds me," whispered Pio. "When I was a boy&mdash;in
Syracusa&mdash;I went to a <i>'casa dei deventissento'</i> and they
wouldn't let me in because I had only two lire...there was that
smell...and then at Milan...all the women...underground...naked,
crying <i>'faccia nuova! faccia nuova!'</i> and that smell."</p>

<p>Lucie put him back on the pillow.</p>

<p>"Don't go," he begged faintly. "I always loved you...it was all
silly after I met you. Don't go. I'm afraid."</p>

<p>Lucie could not answer, could not speak, she was so powerless to
save him from the black Tartarus where his spirit already hovered,
so incapable of ever following the dark ways where his tortured
mind wandered; how did she know that real fiends did not pursue
him, that for him the moon was not in truth Hecate with power to
bring foul monsters from the sea?</p>

<p>"Don't you see," he said again, "don't you see all those
eyes?"</p>

<p>"No," answered Lucie, faintly, "I don't believe in evil. I
won't."</p>

<p>He cowered down into the bed; to watch his torments was in
itself a torment.</p>

<p>"Shall I close the shutters, Pio, to shut out the moon?"</p>

<p>"No, no&mdash;with the shutters closed I can't
breathe&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Shall I give you the morphia, Pio? Dr. Ghisleri said you could
have it, if you wished."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, give me the morphia&mdash;quick."</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; V</p>

<p>When Lucie went downstairs that morning she found the house open
and Marianna away at the Piazza; she went very early now, because
it was beginning to be the end of the season, and fewer provisions
were brought to the market, and these were greatly in demand by the
still large number of visitors.</p>

<p>Lucie arranged the sick-room, making it cool and fragrant, going
up and down the stone stairs with trays and pails of water; she had
a certain pleasure in this task; order and decency did so much to
mitigate the sordid horror of the illness; the freshly washed
floors, the well-dusted room, the newly laundered linen, the
shining array of toilet articles, the gleaming glass and crockery,
the bowls of water, the perfume of orange and lavender-water, lemon
and vinegar, the scent of the pine trees flowing in through the
permanently opened windows, were all as so many weapons with which
to fight at bay the inevitable conqueror.</p>

<p>She put some sprigs of rosemary and vine in a glass by his bed
for him to see when he woke, darkened the room and crept downstairs
to make herself some coffee; she was rather flushed, with her hair
and her cotton gown and cotton apron disordered; while the coffee
was heating on the charcoal, she poured some water into a big
yellow bowl and washed her face and hands; it was already very
hot.</p>

<p>She wondered if the fishing party had returned yet; she wondered
if she would get a glimpse of him before he left for the mountains;
she resolved to work hard during the coming hours so as not to have
time to think.</p>

<p>Her hair had fallen to her shoulders now and she turned to run
upstairs and put it up; as she crossed the wide scullery corridor
she saw, through the open door, Dr. Ghisleri coming up the
path.</p>

<p>Lucie waited at the bottom of the stairs; she tried swiftly to
understand her own feeling, but she could have given no possible
name to the feeling that possessed her.</p>

<p>He came across the threshold as if he was entering his own
house.</p>

<p>"I thought that you were not coming back," said Lucie. "You knew
I should."</p>

<p>He turned into the little dark dining-room where the shutters
were still closed.</p>

<p>"You knew I should," he repeated violently, as Lucie followed
him; he leant against the black table where she took her solitary
meals.</p>

<p>"I suppose I did know you would," answered Lucie slowly, "or I
couldn't have borne it."</p>

<p>It was her tribute to the nobility in him that she tried to be
desperately honest; when in his presence she tried to divest
herself of the least trace of subterfuge or sham.</p>

<p>He looked at her as she stood just inside the open door in her
cotton gown and apron with her fallen hair and earnest face and
closely clasped hands; she was tall but she had to look up to him
and her head was tilted back a little, the whole of her figure and
the edges of her hair touched by the sunlight from the corridor;
the look on his face was of trouble and anguish.</p>

<p>"Why do you treat me like this?" he asked. "You are such a
child. Where did you come from? I never met anyone like you. You
<i>do</i> love me?"</p>

<p>Lucie's hands clasped tighter; she tried passionately to be
truthful and to be clear; to make him understand.</p>

<p>"I don't quite know what people mean by love&mdash;really. I
don't know if I love you. I want you to love me."</p>

<p>"Don't you want to belong to me?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Any woman would. A man like you. I couldn't flirt or play
with you&mdash;I've been trying to tell you that."</p>

<p>"But you know you are mine," he insisted. "What then are you
afraid of?"</p>

<p>"Of the end of it. Of your going away. Of being just an episode
to you," said Lucie quickly. "It couldn't mean much to you. A man
like you. It would be everything to me. Don't you see?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Do you see my case?"</p>

<p>"Ah, you! You have everything."</p>

<p>"I have nothing. Everything is over for me but you. I have
hardly slept since I met you&mdash;<i>Dio!</i> Such nights! I tried
to get away on the sea. I had to put back before the others. I
can't go to the mountains&mdash;they mean nothing to
me&mdash;without you."</p>

<p>"It isn't possible," said Lucie desperately. "It isn't possible
that I should turn the current of your life like this."</p>

<p>"Then you still do not understand what this means to me. It is I
who will suffer most. You will go on. But I shall be
broken&mdash;utterly."</p>

<p>Lucie left the door so her figure was no longer flecked by
sunlight.</p>

<p>All her obsession with her own point of view could not prevent
her from seeing that he was deeply moved; hitherto she had regarded
him wholly as a splendid, but devastating force that must be kept
at hay; now she began to feel for him, to see the position from his
point of view, to lose her self-consciousness.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I am not being fair," she said, "I'm thinking of things
too much from my point of view.
Being&mdash;cautious&mdash;cowardly. That's hateful. I haven't even
told you my gratitude."</p>

<p>"Gratitude!" he interrupted, not without bitterness.</p>

<p>"I haven't even told you what I think of you. I could kneel to
you. You will always be the first thing in my life. Always. I'm
grateful to you for loving me. Grateful. If you do love me."</p>

<p>"Love you, darling?&mdash;you are the only creature I have ever
met worthy to be called woman."</p>

<p>Lucie gave a trembling smile at the extravagance of this; yet
reversed, it would have been no more than the truth; in this man
she had met for the first time, her ideal of manhood.</p>

<p>"And you thought I wanted to make you the heroine of an
<i>amorette?"</i> he asked, unsteadily.</p>

<p>Lucie sat down by the black table; she was trembling so that she
could not stand.</p>

<p>"Well, well," she whispered, "what do you want with me? What are
you going to do with me?"</p>

<p>His hand rested on her bowed shoulder in the lightest most
tender of gestures.</p>

<p>"What do you want?"</p>

<p>Lucie was silent, staring down at her locked hands. "Do you want
children?"</p>

<p>"My children?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>His hand passed in a delicate caress over her fallen hair; there
was a moment's silence; a sense of peace stole over Lucie, a sense
of exultation and delight inexpressible.</p>

<p>She rose up and sat down again.</p>

<p>"You won't shut yourself away from me again?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No. My coffee is boiling over. I must go."</p>

<p>"I will make it for you. Kiss me first."</p>

<p>"No," said Lucie, "no."</p>

<p>She rose and sat down again...</p>

<p>"We haven't battled it out," she said with a kind of broken
violence. "I' won't be your mistress. That is as true as anything
else I've said."</p>

<p>"You seem to think," he smiled, "that you are going to do what
you like with me."</p>

<p>Lucie smiled, too, but unsteadily; they heard Marianna in the
kitchen and he went to fetch her coffee.</p>

<h2><a name="ch26" id="ch26">Chapter Twenty-Six</a>
</h2>

<p class="cpb">&sect; I</p>

<p>DR. GHISLERI did not go to the mountains; most of his friends
left Forte dei Marni. Agostino and his friends grumbled that they
had never stayed so late in the year; the season was nearly over,
everyone of importance had already gone.</p>

<p>These grumbles came to Lucie's ears; she knew that there must be
others worse than these that she did not hear, the comments of the
acquaintances she had forsaken, the indignation of his friends, the
murmurs of his relations; she knew that she would not be spared;
scandal was already probably busy with her; for this she did not
care in the least, since it was an alien world, but for him she
felt vexation, even remorse; it seemed to her that she was
interfering too terribly in his life and giving him nothing in
exchange, and, though she knew that he must have braved many
scandals before, yet there were new features in this episode that
would render it inexplicable to these people.</p>

<p>She had two instances of the insatiable curiosity the affair was
awakening; both Mrs. Heaton and <i>"l'Americana"</i> from the Villa
Tristan risked the infection and asked her to tea.</p>

<p>Lucie laughed to think of the terrific bombardment of questions
awaiting her; she declined both invitations and her secret enemies
became open ones; both ignored her when they saw her next and she
learnt from Marianna that they and their servants were the prime
inventors of the stories that began to circle the little coterie of
idle people, all wealthy, happy, enjoying themselves, without a
care, and all combined to attack and slander the poor creature
imprisoned in their midst.</p>

<p>But they had now no power to bend Lucie; she lived in a kind of
enchantment that no practical considerations could disturb; Dr.
Ghisleri came two or three times a day to the Villa Calvini, but
she seldom saw him alone; a few moments in the morning before
Marianna came back from the Piazza, perhaps a few moments in the
afternoon if he came when Pio slept, now and then a precious half
hour in the evening, walking along the sea shore.</p>

<p>The rest of the time he spent in the Villa Calvini was devoted
to Pio; he talked with him, read to him, performed all the services
of nurse and doctor, serving him with all care, attention, delicacy
and skill.</p>

<p>Not since he had been a student had the great doctor, used to
assistants and nurses, performed for anyone the menial offices he
performed for Pio.</p>

<p>He insisted that Lucie do as little as possible; he was
distressed if he saw her with a tray or a glass; he tried to put
all associated with the illness in the background so that she
should not be aware of it; and he did so fill the house and her
life with his fragrant personality that the sick man was but a
veiled horror, a mitigated and bearable anguish.</p>

<p>And Pio himself, under this so constant and so skilful
treatment, such as few could have often enjoyed, lost half the
hideous symptoms, half his racking miseries and pains; the doctor
lent him every object invented for the comfort of the sick; special
bed-rests, cushions, perfumes, chairs came to the Villa Calvini;
Pio rallied to such an extent that Marianna predicted his recovery;
Lucie served him with complete abnegation of self; had any of their
pleasure making women who defamed her ever waited on their sick
with such devotion they would have considered themselves
saints.</p>

<p>Her days were now ordered differently; she had good meals eaten
in peace, she slept at least half each night, she bathed, half an
hour's real liberty every day, she had another half-hour's walk,
afternoon or evening; she went twice into Viareggio and bought
clothes and books, all this on the stern insistence of Dr.
Ghisleri; she lost her pallor and her giddiness, her mental
confusion, her queer fancies, even some of her haggard thinness.
Emotionally there was a truce between them; they never spoke of the
future; they were content with those few snatched moments
together.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; II</p>

<p>It was in every way a perfect communion, an affinity of mind, a
similarity of taste, an equality (in masculine and feminine degree
of intelligence and culture), a kinship in originality of outlook
and point of view, both enthusiastic, ardent, vital, daring, both
passionate and each the object of the other's passion.</p>

<p>It was a companionship of incredible delight.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; III</p>

<p>He was in every way immeasurably her superior, in strength, in
intellect, in knowledge, in character.</p>

<p>To Lucie, used to being the best informed and the most
intellectual of her company, t was an unending joy to be with
someone whose every word showed him her master.</p>

<p>There seemed nothing he did not know, had not seen or
experienced; he had had a wonderful life, joyous, laborious, full
of work, love, friends, adventure, honour; he had rendered great
services to mankind and received much foul opposition, bitter
attacks and snarling calumnies, but he had never lost his
fortitude, his serenity, his gay sweetness, his views; his ideas
were wide and sane and free as the mountains and sea that he so
deeply loved.</p>

<p>And this gallant spirit, so wise, so calm, so brave, so lovable,
was bound to a body as magnificent as any humanity could show;
radiant with the health of the athlete and the temperance of the
philosopher.</p>

<p>Beside him Lucie felt frail and weak, needful of protection,
dependent, and in her mind a school child eager for guidance; she
even could forget that people called her a clever woman; she found
herself exquisitely in her place, the woman leaning on, relying on
the man, obeying him in the tenderest subjection.</p>

<p>But it would all have to end soon; in a few days he was due back
at his hospital; his clinic was waiting for him; his friends were
writing impatiently; his patients complained.</p>

<p>Lucie was acutely aware of the passing of each hour.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch27" id="ch27">Chapter Twenty-Seven</a>
</h2>

<p class="cpb">&sect; I</p>

<p>THE first week in September a Russian lady gave a concert in her
villa; this was to mark the final end of the season; within a few
days from that the place would be as empty as it had been when
Lucie first came to the Villa Calvini.</p>

<p>Dr. Ghisleri told her of the concert and asked her to go with
him to it; she knew that he cared nothing about such things and
that all the people present would be those who had gossiped about
her and also that their presence there together would be the final
scandal.</p>

<p>"I know," he said when Lucie put these objections before him,
"but I like a woman who can hold her own."</p>

<p>She knew instantly then that he was being assailed far more
fiercely on her account than she had realized; she asked formal
permission of Pio which was reluctantly granted and that warm still
September afternoon she went with Carlo Ghisleri into the very
midst of his friends, facing an immense curiosity, a great
antagonism, dislike and jealousy.</p>

<p>It was a curious experience for Lucie; she did not want to go
but she never thought of refusing his wish.</p>

<p>He approved her appearance; she wore a full dress of a dark
orange cloth, a long white cloak and a black velvet hat with long
ribbons; he begged her to wear a silver clasp of the lion's head
which came from his mountaineering cape.</p>

<p>"Your friends will recognize it," said Lucie, "I know." Lucie
went back and sewed the clasp on to her white cloak.</p>

<p>The Villa Laodamia where the concert was held was very opulent;
the wealthy aristocratic audience sat under trellises of vines
among exotic flowers; the wide flung doors of the salon that opened
on to the terrace displayed a room furnished with Eastern luxury.
Everyone knew Carlo Ghisleri; as they crowded round him Lucie felt
terribly alien and alone.</p>

<p>He presented her to most of the women, then took a stool beside
her chair under the vines; it was as if he sat at her feet.</p>

<p>Lucie felt the whispering, the staring, the comment, the barely
suppressed amazement.</p>

<p>"I suppose they think I am a shameless hussy," she thought, and
she wondered why there should be such excitement over her; it was
common knowledge that several of the great ladies there were
notorious for their gallantries; it was not by any means a
puritanical society that was passing judgment on her; but as Dr.
Ghisleri never left his place beside her despite all the
invitations from one beautifully gowned woman after another to come
inside the house, she was indifferent to whatever their judgment
might be.</p>

<p>The music was poor and the concert dragged.</p>

<p>Lucie then promised Pio to be home by five; as a thin piece of
Corelli's came to an end, she reminded Carlo Ghisleri of this.</p>

<p>He rose instantly, and with the briefest of nods to his friends
followed her out.</p>

<p>"Why did we go?" asked Lucie as they crossed the road to the
Villa Calvini.</p>

<p>"I wanted them to see you."</p>

<p>He seemed both amused and elated. Lucie rather shrank from
enquiry into his reasons.</p>

<p>As they passed his house he asked her to go in and pick some of
the last oleanders in his garden.</p>

<p>"I would rather not," said Lucie, "Agostino dislikes me so and
so do your servants."</p>

<p>"Ah, you have heard some of the croaking of the frogs in the
marsh?" he said sharply.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I hoped not. It is that stupid woman of yours."</p>

<p>"Poor Marianna! She means no harm. And I do not care."</p>

<p>He opened his garden gate.</p>

<p>"Please go in. I want to think that you have walked
here&mdash;and gathered the flowers I have planted."</p>

<p>Lucie entered; his words seemed to her like a farewell. Sadly
she plucked the boughs of oleander, the long gray-green leaves, the
pearl-pink flowers would ever after seem to her symbols of
melancholy.</p>

<p>He showed her that the ground was covered with clover that he
had brought from his beloved Tyrol.</p>

<p>"You dislike Italy?" said Lucie.</p>

<p>"The people&mdash;not the country," he answered. "Sometimes I am
sorry that I was born a few miles the wrong side of the
frontier."</p>

<p>She had her arms full of flowers now.</p>

<p>"I must go back. Pio will be looking for me."</p>

<p>"I will come with you."</p>

<p>They found Pio still asleep and Marianna in the garden washing
at the <i>pozzo;</i> her sister Stella had come over from
Pietrasanta and the two women were chattering happily together.</p>

<p>In the dim <i>salotto</i> Lucie took off her hat and cloak and
sat down on the red divan; across her knees was the sheath of
oleanders.</p>

<p>"I am due to leave next week," said Carlo Ghisleri standing
close to her.</p>

<p>"I know."</p>

<p>"Will you come with me?"</p>

<p>Lucie was completely startled.</p>

<p>"And Pio?" was all she could exclaim.</p>

<p>"Ah, that husband! How much more am I to do for him? I've nearly
cured him&mdash;that is the curse of it&mdash;hell live for months
now&mdash;a century!"</p>

<p>He spoke with such useful humour that Lucie laughed; the
situation was grotesque.</p>

<p>"I can't leave him."</p>

<p>"You can leave him perfectly well. You have made a fetish of
him, you are making me do the same&mdash;<i>Dio
possente</i>&mdash;he thinks I am his slave! I will put a nurse in
here, two, three nurses, I will install a doctor to look after him.
But I must take you away."</p>

<p>"And the scandal?" said Lucie. "I suppose you are used to this
sort of thing. But I've always been intensely&mdash;well,
respectable."</p>

<p>"Not really. You have only been pretending. And as to scandal,
believe me, that could not be worse than it is now."</p>

<p>"I am sorry it is so bad. But it does not seem to matter when it
isn't true. I've got the consolations of virtue," she smiled
unsteadily.</p>

<p>"It isn't virtue," he answered quickly, "it is just an obstinate
adherence to obsolete codes&mdash;your state is just negative,
instinctive, a woman's terror of the unconventional. You put me to
the torture for the sake of this man you care nothing about."</p>

<p>"Leave me," said Lucie, "I would never ask you to stay."</p>

<p>"Leave you to face this alone?"</p>

<p>"I could, really. He is so much better now. And you could send a
nurse."</p>

<p>"The poor devil would hate that."</p>

<p>"I believe you are really fond of him yourself," smiled
Lucie.</p>

<p>"I've made him my job. Fond of him!"</p>

<p>"You are looking after him from a sense of duty, though."</p>

<p>"No," he spoke lightly but with an air of finality, "it is
merely because of you&mdash;you know it and you have sacrificed me
to him cruelly."</p>

<p>"Never that," said Lucie wistfully.</p>

<p>"You have." He turned his fine head, the head of a conqueror, a
hero, towards her. She saw the full outline of the clean shaven
face in the light that filtered through the shuttered window. "You
never think what this means to me&mdash;the price I have to pay for
these few moments with you&mdash;I, who have need of you close in
my arms, must wait for one snatched kiss, be spied upon, maligned,
jeered at, endure that man upstairs&mdash;these lonely nights, the
sight of your toiling for him&mdash;I who would possess you in
utmost peace, away from every eye, must stand like this exposed to
the vulgar scandals of the Piazza&mdash;"</p>

<p>He spoke with such force that Lucie was frightened.</p>

<p>"This happens at the wrong end of my life. I am too old for you,
my flower. Had I been a younger man, I had dragged you away at
first&mdash;by force."</p>

<p>His voice was touched by wistful sadness now; to Lucie he was
ever associated with youth, the epitome of virile manhood, she
could not understand his regret.</p>

<p>"To have met you at first! To have lived my life with a woman
like you beside me&mdash;but there is yet time&mdash;will you come
away with me?"</p>

<p>"No," whispered Lucie, "don't ask me, it is pain for nothing. I
never could."</p>

<p>"Because of that young man? Do you owe him anything? This
sacrifice is madness, Lucie, madness. If it was a child, or someone
who could recover, or someone who had any claim on you&mdash;but
this wretch who has battened on you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He loves me, too," said Lucie.</p>

<p>"Is that a virtue? Any man would love you. Listen. I wrote to
his relations, I've frightened the truth out of them. When he was
eighteen he was sent to a hospital for epilepsy where he stayed two
years&mdash;he escaped army service because of 'tubercular
tendencies.' You were never told? You never thought to ask?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Will you come away with me? Will you end this hideous comedy? I
will tell him you must have rest, a change, it's true
enough&mdash;he shall be looked after like a prince&mdash;"</p>

<p>Lucie was silent; she tightly clutched the oleander boughs,
chilled to her very heart.</p>

<p>He leant forward and touched her hand.</p>

<p>"Lucie&mdash;have pity on me."</p>

<p>She could not answer; it was impossible to find words that were
honest to him and to herself and to that abstract truth that was
outside both of them.</p>

<p>He straightened himself; never before had she seen his gay
serenity darkened, the sadness, the agitation that shook him now
was the more terrible.</p>

<p>"How much more do you want of me?" he asked. "You are
insatiable. Thwarted passion kills, Lucie."</p>

<p>She rose stiffly, the forgotten flowers fell from her lap
between them.</p>

<p>"Do you think I don't suffer?" she asked dully. "Do you think it
is easy for me? Do you think I don't agonize for you to take me?
And that if you were to touch me&mdash;" Her tired voice trailed
off. "I'm only a woman. It is you who should have mercy."</p>

<p>Through the quiet house Pio's bell jangled; Lucie turned
unsteadily towards the door.</p>

<p>"You're going?" Carlo Ghisleri asked sharply.</p>

<p>"Yes. To Pio."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch28" id="ch28"></a>Chapter Twenty-Eight</h2>

<p class="cpb">&sect; I</p>

<p>THE place was empty now; the fishermen were taking down the
<i>capuane</i> and moving the pleasure boats away; one by one the
villas were being shuttered up.</p>

<p>Carlo Ghisleri had strained his absence from Florence to the
utmost; he had sent away two of his servants; Agostino and the
woman who remained grumbled furiously; Lucie did not care to think
of the mischievous scandals that were brewing; she had heard that
Dr. Villari had joined in the evil tongues and she told Carlo
Ghisleri who sent for him in such a style that he came at once,
cringing before the great man.</p>

<p>The little village doctor was shown the patient, reproved for
his treatment of the illness, for his abandonment of the case,
dismissed, with cold courtesy, a note for double his fee in his
pocket.</p>

<p>It was kingly treatment and Dr. Villari was humbled as a beaten
cur, but Lucie knew they had not stopped his tongue.</p>

<p><i>"L'Americana"</i> received her punishment too; Dr. Ghisleri
held the Villa Tristan for a friend in Germany and he refused to
renew her lease for September, October and the following
summer.</p>

<p>"The addled hag wishes to stay and spy on us," he said. "Another
enemy," remarked Lucie sadly.</p>

<p>She was rather startled at this increasing volume of malice and
dislike, the bitter intensity of the winds of scandal.</p>

<p>Then the obsequious Martinelli had become so offensive that he
had been forbidden the house. Lucie would have continued to
tolerate him, to pay him, feed him, and give him all the oddments
of the establishment, but Carlo Ghisleri had, at first sight of the
man challenged him haughtily; Martinelli's excuses for his presence
were cringing and profuse, but later when the doctor's back was
turned he became impertinent in a horrible jocular way.</p>

<p>When he next came, Carlo 'Ghisleri, whose methods were swift and
impetuous in such matters, turned him out in such a manner that he
was not likely to come again.</p>

<p>"A man you should not even know the existence of," he said in
fierce disgust.</p>

<p>"He seemed fond of Pio," protested Lucie feebly.</p>

<p>"Ah, <i>bambina!"</i> he smiled in despair, "you are really
hopelessly crazy."</p>

<p>But Lucie thought "another enemy" and, when he is gone, "they
will all be about me."</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; II</p>

<p>But she could not dwell much on anything; she was absorbed in
preparing for the moment of farewell.</p>

<p>It would be no ordinary parting.</p>

<p>He was going back to his own world, his life work, his
relations, his friends, a hundred strong interests that must dim
her image, that must break the enchantment, scatter the magic.</p>

<p>And what of her desolation?</p>

<p>Was another winter in the Villa Calvin, shut up with Pio,
possible?</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; III</p>

<p>Carlo Ghisleri wore a very fine gold ring on his little
finger.</p>

<p>His liking was for silver and Lucie wondered at this ring which
looked so curious on his fine, shapely, skilful surgeon's hand.</p>

<p>She asked him what it was.</p>

<p>"My mother's wedding ring," he said, "she gave it me when she
was dying&mdash;with all her thanks for a lifetime's happiness. All
the others married but I made a home for her in Florence. She lived
and died in perfect felicity. Her little ring is the one thing I
would not part with."</p>

<p>From that moment it became the one thing that Lucie wanted.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; IV</p>

<p>She ventured to ask him (her voice faint and cowardly, her lips
trembling) when he was going.</p>

<p>They had just left Pio's room and were standing in the front
doorway, the lamp light behind them, before them the warm autumn
night, the moonlight filtering through the fir boughs.</p>

<p>"I am not going."</p>

<p>The hot joy that leapt through her veins was in her amazed
answer.</p>

<p>"Is it possible?"</p>

<p>"I have resigned my hospital appointments."</p>

<p>That hurt her&mdash;unbearably.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no&mdash;I didn't want that&mdash;you can't, you
mustn't&mdash;what of your friends?"</p>

<p>"It isn't the first time I've sent them all to the devil."</p>

<p>"Your patients?"</p>

<p>"They can die or recover without me. You need me more.".</p>

<p>"I cannot take so much," said Lucie, ashamed.</p>

<p>"I am doing it for myself," he answered. "Do you not think I am
master of my own destiny?"</p>

<p>All Lucie's feminine dismays, curiosities, regrets, fears seemed
in her own eyes so much pettifogging foolishness in the light of
this attitude of his; he had never bothered her with his affairs or
his career; he would tell her with endless delight how he had tamed
a Cigard to waltz to his flute playing, how he had dragged rickety
children into the sunlight and cured them, how he had slept under
his cloak on the Dolomites and watched Aldebaran hanging so near he
might have plucked him and set him to light the hut; but he had
never spoken of his achievements, his operations, his wealthy
patients, his official positions (he had had an <i>ospedale de
campo</i> in the War, the most advanced on the Carvo front and some
high rank and many decorations), or any of the practical side of
his life; so she did not know what his sacrifice meant or really
entailed and how far it would be resented, or made much, or little
of.</p>

<p>"You see," he said, "how lightly I hold all I possess&mdash;and
how high you rate that young man compared to how low I rate my poor
patients&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How long will you stay, then?"</p>

<p>"Till you are free&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Free! I used to think I should be&mdash;when this was
over&mdash;but&mdash;I shall be more entangled than ever
before&mdash;" <i>"Via,</i> until you are rid of this incubus,
then. No, you'll never be free, Lucia&mdash;you are too much of a
woman&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But if&mdash;Pio&mdash;goes on and on?" asked Lucie dubiously.
<i>"Patienza!</i>&mdash;you have the house till January?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well, if he survives till then, I will move him into my house,
and you shall go into the Villa Tristan. I am keeping it for you.
That is why I made that old woman go."</p>

<p>They moved slowly down to the gate; the moon was not yet up and
the stars were veiled in a warm haze.</p>

<p>"Pio," said Lucie, "is the only one getting much out of this. He
is happy, anyway. Isn't it awful that we have got to take such care
of him just because his being there is so terrible for us?"</p>

<p>She looked back at the pointed window of the room where the
drugged man slept; it did seem fantastic that he should in this
vampire way, batten on her unhappiness, flourish on her very life
blood, find ease, relief and salvation at the hands of the man she
had to torment.</p>

<p>"It is all wrong, somehow," said Lucie.</p>

<p>His voice, calm and caressing, came out of the soft
darkness.</p>

<p>"It is we who are wrong without eternal complications. There is
nothing else awry. Feel the beauty of this night, the wind, the
stars, listen to the movement of the boughs and the waves&mdash;how
calm, my Lucie, how peaceful."</p>

<p>They stood by the gate and the reed thatched fencing that
protected the garden from the sea winds; they could feel the
solitariness of the shore, the loneliness of the closed houses, the
empty gardens on either side of them; there was no light anywhere
save the muffled glow of the cloud-veiled stars and the dim
illumination in the sick man's window.</p>

<p>A soft breeze rushed quickly past them; full of perfume and
whispering sweetness, the salt of the sea and the fragrance of the
pines and the mountain chestnuts whose long yellow leaves were
beginning to be wafted down to the sea in the rapid waters of the
streams.</p>

<p>"Are you not a little happy to have someone to stand by you,
Lucie?"</p>

<p>He put his hands delicately on her shoulders, and she could just
see the dim outline of his white-clad figure.</p>

<p>The wind fluttered her gown and scarf, loosened her hair and
curled a long lock against his bare neck as he stooped towards
her.</p>

<p>"Put your arm round me," he whispered, "don't I deserve
that?"</p>

<p>But Lucie dare not; the rising passion between them, the
enchantment of the night, were things not even to be imagined in
cold blood; she stood shivering while he kissed her arms, from
wrist to shoulder, her throat, her face, never her lips.</p>

<p>All the while she was conscious of the wind rushing past;
pulling at her clothes, her hair, of the sound of the pines and the
waves and the misty glitter of the stars behind the fast flowing
vaporous clouds.</p>

<p>At last, like one in a dream, so purged was she from any
ordinary considerations; she put her arm round his shoulder and
stretched up to lightly kiss his face as he bent over her; and then
he let go of her violently&mdash;almost pushed her away and opened
the gate.</p>

<p>She could hear him sigh and the misery of it overwhelmed her;
she began to cry, childishly, putting her hands before her
face.</p>

<p>"My heart will burst," he said, "my heart will burst&mdash;" He
caught hold of her, roughly, in the dark.</p>

<p>"Look in the bushes&mdash;look."</p>

<p>Through her tears she saw three glow worms, tiny blots of
radiance in the wind-filled night.</p>

<p>"They have come to you, darling&mdash;fairy things&mdash;three
fairy babies to comfort you, three little children coming, three
dear, dear children&mdash;I am with you always&mdash;Lucie!"</p>

<p>He kissed her again, very gently now, and was gone.</p>

<p>Lucie looked at the glow worms; her fancy leapt with his;
children, her children&mdash;the spirits of them somewhere in the
warm wind, in the shrouded stars, in the soft waves, in the
delicate lights in the bushes...</p>

<p>She went slowly into the house; the candle in her room showed
her that her arms were bruised and marked from his kisses; she sat
with them folded over her heart and thought how strong he was and
how easily he could have crushed her light breath out of her frail
body and how gladly she would have died that way, caressed by the
warm wind in the dark garden.</p>

<p>In the next room the sick man slept heavily. The night breezes
flowed in through the open window and touched his pillow and his
damp hair and fluttered the long leaves of the melancholy oleanders
in the glass by his bed.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch29" id="ch29">Chapter Twenty-Nine</a>
</h2>

<p class="cpb">&sect; I</p>

<p>BY the middle of October, the weather, still golden, became cold
and the stove in the sick man's room had to be lit and all his
clothes warmed before they could go near him and early, but bitter
storms of wind and rain began.</p>

<p>Lucie was oppressed by the complete isolation in which they
moved, herself, her husband, her servant and Carlo Ghisleri, and by
the sense of the approaching winter.</p>

<p>The life was intensely unnatural; the isolation was not the
isolation of the country but of empty houses, deserted gardens and
an untrodden street. The Villa Calvini out-of-repair,
half-furnished, built solely for a pleasure place during the heat,
was in no sense a home and the whole household was run round a
dying man.</p>

<p>Everything that was normal or healthy or cheerful had to be
indulged in with guilty furtiveness. When Lucie bathed, Pio would
drag himself to the window to stare at her with his watch in his
hand to see that she was not absent longer than the fifteen minutes
allowed her; her snatched walk was always clouded by the dread of
being late, her few moments with Carlo Ghisleri were agonising
delights.</p>

<p>And beyond this quiet where they moved in their abominable
routine, they knew there was the circle of malicious eyes and
stabbing tongues watching, slandering, waiting.</p>

<p>Lucie felt the strain, her nerves could scarcely resist the
tension put on them. It was not easy to bring the deadly round of
everyday into line with her moments of exultation: it was not easy
to spend their pale glorious hours of the sweet autumn sitting by
Pio's bed, making Pio's foods, tending Pio's fires, comforting
Pio's fears, writing, drawing, to earn the money for it all, and to
see Carlo Ghisleri bound now to the same fruitless toil, he, the
great doctor, tending with such patience this hopeless sordid
illness of the man he disliked.</p>

<p>And worst of all to know what they were saying of him, to learn
from snatched sentences of Marianna, the gossip of the Piazza, the
café, the chemist's shop where the loungers were mouthing his name
and hers, asserting that she was not Pio's wife, but a woman
"hanging on" to him for his money, that the family had tried to
dislodge her and failed, that she was a penniless foreigner, and he
a wealthy nobleman, that she and the doctor were giving him morphia
that they might be free of his demands, his suspicions&mdash;</p>

<p>All these things Lucie heard. She knew that Carlo Ghisleri had
heard them, also, for he ceased to get his morphia in the village
and sent to Florence for it, and now and then he would let escape
some passionate outburst against the foul mouthed idlers who were
getting their comedy out of this tragedy.</p>

<p>They were so exposed, so pinned up in the public view, so
conspicuous in their isolation and the extraordinary features of
their situation.</p>

<p>They were continually under espionage.</p>

<p>Agostino, malevolent, bitter, found continual excuse to circle
round the house, eavesdropping, prying with his almost sightless
eyes. Catering, the old housekeeper, prowled in and out the Villa
Calvini on self-invented errands with white jealous face and
viper's tongue.</p>

<p>Lucie begged that the woman might be sent back to Florence; but
she was old and ill, and had been his mother's servant; he told
Lucie that it was beneath her to notice the base spite of a poor
peasant.</p>

<p>And Lucie tried to think it was; nevertheless she found the
strain of the position almost unbearable.</p>

<p>She suggested to Dr. 'Ghisleri that a nurse should be put in
charge to break the tension a little and spare him his menial
task.</p>

<p>"It would only be another spy," he answered simply, "for I do
love you and she would see it. I might as well," he added, "have
stood naked in the Piazza and asked them to throw mud at me as do
what I have done."</p>

<p>"But you are free," said Lucie, "no one has any claim on
you."</p>

<p>She never could quite understand why his behaviour should give
rise to such an enormous scandal as he admitted it had caused; but
she knew nothing of the social life of Italy, nor the
conspicuousness of his position nor his hosts of jealous
enemies.</p>

<p>She felt that he had sacrificed far too much; she could see no
way in which she could make her gratitude manifest; there were
moments of black depression when she saw herself as a mean fool to
have made a holocaust of the fortunes and happiness of the splendid
man she loved for the sake of the deceased weakling she
despised.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; II</p>

<p>Carlo Ghisleri had been so happy before he met her; he had had
everything; his life had been joyous, wonderful, laborious, useful,
radiant..</p>

<p>She was used to unhappiness, trained to abnegation, schooled to
poverty, broken in the humdrum, the deadening struggle, the sordid
competition, the stale and sour devices of the overcrowded
population of a big city; but he had never known any of these
things.</p>

<p>Always dominant, born to ease, honour, position, always holding
his own by sheer force of intellect and power of achievement, this
was the first time that circumstances had mastered him, the first
time his passions had betrayed him; love, hitherto, he had treated
with a laugh; no woman had ever altered or interfered with his
life; women had served him for romance, for amusement, for pleasure
but he had always had them well in hand; they had been very
secondary in his life and he had never taken any of them in the
least seriously.</p>

<p>And now he had been overthrown utterly; his whole life pulled
down about his ears, his friends for the first time outraged, his
enemies, for the first time, given cause for ridicule, for
slander.</p>

<p>And he was getting nothing out of it; the knowledge of this hung
on Lucie's heart like a dead weight.</p>

<p>And every day that Pio lived made the situation more difficult,
the future more dark and uncertain.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; III</p>

<p>They had their wonderful moments; a walk along the shore, a walk
inland, a word in the garden or on the terraces, when they would
forget everything mean and horrible in the joy of their perfect
companionship.</p>

<p>He instructed her in a thousand beautiful things, all her timid
struggling aspirations he encouraged and confirmed, he taught her
his cult of nature of the rain and wind, sun and sea.</p>

<p>There was nothing in him that had any kinship with the horrible,
the morbid, the cruel, or the indecent. He transmuted everything he
touched into terms of strength and beauty and sweetness.</p>

<p>His endless patience, his deep compassion, his enthusiasm, his
tireless good humour, his wide vision and calm sanity, his wisdom
and knowledge, all seemed to Lucie to be godlike qualities, lifting
the man above the ordinary level of humanity.</p>

<p>There were other aspects of him also, of direct and overwhelming
appeal to Lucie; he was above everything an athlete, a famous
fencer, horseman, oarsman, mountaineer; his magnificent physique
had been magnificently used just as his exceptional brain had been
put to exceptional service.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; IV</p>

<p>She went with him, one afternoon, of ruddy sunshine, to see a
peasant's child, whose leg was broken and which he had set; she sat
under the heavy laden vines and waited while he went into the
little white house with the citron covered walls.</p>

<p>She watched while he and the child's father carried her out into
the sunshine and made a bed for her under the vine. The peasants
all loved him.</p>

<p>When they left, the mother gave her a bunch of red dahlias and a
bough of the citron tree with the half-ripe hard green fruit among
the dark, glossy, pointed leaves.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; V</p>

<p>They stood on a little arched bridge amid trees and lush fields
that were, she told him, like England.</p>

<p>A man was mending the bridge and they talked to him while they
watched his work. All three were laughing like children.</p>

<p>And Lucie saw the water spiders hurrying over the surface of the
dark water and the long trail of clematis over the sunny stone
which told how the archbishop had blessed the bridge, long before
any of them were born.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; VI</p>

<p>He told her how he had watched by a woman's death bed, all
through the winter night in Venice, he a young student then, who
had left his companions merry-making to tend this old forsaken
creature.</p>

<p>And he was weary, for she lay in an unchanging stupor and the
room was miserable and foul.</p>

<p>His one companion was the noise of the storm, the wind from the
Adriatic thundering at the feeble casement.</p>

<p>At last he rose and opened the shutters and a gust of the fierce
wind blew a yellow bird right into his hand.</p>

<p>It was a strange bird such as he had never seen before; bruised
and exhausted, with drenched golden feathers, it lay in his
hand.</p>

<p>"It was like you, my Lucie. So you came to me."</p>

<p>"Did it stay?"</p>

<p>"Only till the morning. When the storm was over and its feathers
were dried and it had eaten my bread and milk, it flew away. Far
out to sea. I never saw it again. And Lucie, I would not have kept
it, my darling, I would never have kept it."</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; VII</p>

<p>Pio's illness took on a new phase; the morphia ceased to bring
him peace, the increased doses only secured to him brief intervals
of oblivion, his terrors, his suspicions, his violences returned,
he began to dislike Carlo Ghisleri, to resent his constant presence
in the house, to abuse, revile and belittle him behind his
back.</p>

<p>This pitiful ingratitude was Lucie's sharpest trial; she had
hoped that Pio would be enabled by all the patient care and
exquisite skill lavished on him, to face his fate with some
equanimity, to show some appreciation of the perpetual sacrifice he
was exacting.</p>

<p>Lucie felt the first smouldering of rebellion against Pio;
hitherto she had always, in her secret heart, regarded him as
inevitable and any escape from him as unthinkable.</p>

<p>And she hadn't resented him or blamed him, she had just been
indifferent to him; now she did begin to resent him, to chafe under
his authority, nearly to hate him.</p>

<p>It had all gone on too long.</p>

<p>He began to be an alien, an intruder in her life; it was the
other man to whom she belonged, he was keeping her from her
rightful owner; a fury new to her rose now in her spirit when he
scolded, nagged, abused and exacted, her patience was no longer
real, but a mask.</p>

<p>One wet, cloudy, windy afternoon that was like a foretaste of
winter, the mask slipped without Lucie's volition.</p>

<p>He had been intolerable all day; Lucie was exhausted with going
up&mdash;and downstairs on his errands, with making him messes he
demanded and then turned on to the floor.</p>

<p>And worst of all, Carlo Ghisleri's patience had worn thin that
morning; he had taken her by the shoulders in the passage and told
her she was a fool to spend herself in such service and that he
could not stand by to see her do it. Then he had left her abruptly,
and for all she knew he might be on his way to Florence by now.</p>

<p>She did not really believe that he could forsake her, but a
horrible uncertainty gnawed at her heart; it seemed incredible that
he should continue to support such a situation.</p>

<p>And then, suddenly, as she was holding to his lips a cup of
camomile tea that he had insisted on, the sick man broke out at her
like a lunatic.</p>

<p>With a shaking gesture of his gaunt hand he scattered the hot
liquid over her arm and dress.</p>

<p>"You've brought me to this," he gasped. "You&mdash;always you.
Get out of the light&mdash;you are always between me and the
light."</p>

<p>She thought him delirious; the glare of the black eyes under the
frowning brows was not sane; but this time she did not feel that
any excuse lay in his condition: she hated him.</p>

<p>"Take care how you speak to me," she said, for the first time
harshly.</p>

<p>The tone had instant effect on, him, his mood leapt to
frenzy.</p>

<p>"I know what I know&mdash;I am not blind nor deaf," his fury
fell naturally into cheap phrases. "I know why he comes here, I
know why he gives me stuff to keep me in bed&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Pio," she interrupted quickly, "if you mean Carlo Ghisleri, he
comes to look after you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Because you ask him to&mdash;" he sneered.</p>

<p>"For God's sake don't say any more&mdash;it is
unbearable&mdash;"</p>

<p>She moved away, stood between his bed and the stove, hardly
knowing what she was doing, wringing her hands and staring blindly
at the stormy sky and tossing sea.</p>

<p>Pio spat out foul words at her, hideous words in his Sicilian
"patois"; then with horrid agility jumped out of bed and put his
hands round her throat.</p>

<p>Lucie was flung back, her right palm went full on the hot stove;
conscious of nothing but disgust and horror, she fought off his
feeble yet demoniac clutch; it was grotesque, hideous, repulsive
beyond conception, this struggle with the weak ferocity of a dying
man; he fell between the two beds, coughing, choking, cursing, his
shawl, flannels and wraps huddled on his ghastly body, his hands
clawing the air for her throat.</p>

<p>Lucie shrieked for the first time in her life and dashed
downstairs without any attempt to help him; Marianna was in the
kitchen peeling potatoes; Lucie ran in, dropped on to the stool by
the fire and rested her head on the corner of the tiled range,
breaking down at last into wild hysterical weeping.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch30" id="ch30">Chapter Thirty</a>
</h2>

<p class="cpb">&sect; I</p>

<p>IT was like the breaking of a spell, the spell of order, decency
and control, that till now had always rested on the Villa Calvini;
Lucie had never broken down before, never shown any signs of
weakening, of rebellion, never anything but a calm, controlled
front.</p>

<p>Marianna gazed at her in amazed dismay.</p>

<p>"What has happened now, <i>signora, per l'amore di Dio!</i></p>

<p>"He wanted to kill me," sobbed Lucie, without raising her
head.</p>

<p>"What is there in that?" asked Marianna. "He has often done that
before&mdash;<i>via</i>."</p>

<p>"He called me dreadful names&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Is it the first time? <i>Dio!</i> Here is his bell!"</p>

<p>"I'm not going up," said Lucie.</p>

<p>The bell clanged furiously.</p>

<p>"I won't go," repeated Lucie hysterically, "I won't! I
won't!"</p>

<p>Marianna ran upstairs, reappeared immediately to say that the
<i>padrone</i> was back in bed, howling and moaning for his
wife.</p>

<p>"I won't go," muttered Lucie.</p>

<p>Marianna was distracted; she could not credit that this
distraught, desperate woman, with the tear-disfigured face and the
clenched hands was her composed mistress, who hitherto had been so
resigned, patient and even cheerful.</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>signora,</i> do go up&mdash;think how ill he
is&mdash;he's crazy, too!"</p>

<p>"I also am ill&mdash;and I'm crazy," answered Lucie between her
wild sobs, "and I'm going away."</p>

<p>Even as she spoke, she saw this as an avenue of escape.</p>

<p>She would go away from all of them, from the intolerable sick
man, from the love that must be always thwarted and denied, from
the cruel spectators who watched and slandered.</p>

<p>She would wire to the Simonetti to come and look after their
son, and she would go somewhere far away where no one could find
her.</p>

<p>She had sufficient money, her own money, she was free; no one
could blame her; her health, her life was in danger; she had his
finger marks on her throat; and her soul was in danger, too; not
long could it survive such degradation, such humiliation, such
starvation.</p>

<p>"I'm going away," she repeated, "I'll take you if you like,
Marianna."</p>

<p>The woman gave her a wild look and ran out of the kitchen.</p>

<p>Lucie no longer cared what she thought or said, what gossip or
scandal was raised; she bowed her head on her thin arms and wept
forlornly, her fallen hair close to the little <i>farello</i> where
the coffee simmered on the charcoal.</p>

<p>She heard Marianna return, she heard Carlo Ghisleri's voice, but
for the first time she remained indifferent to his presence, she
was shameless in her complete abandon.</p>

<p>"Lucie!" She heard a new note of anxiety in his voice, but it
did not move her, she would not raise her head.</p>

<p>Pio's bell clanged again; for the first time she heard Carlo
Ghisleri swear fiercely.</p>

<p>Lucie's sobs turned to crazy laughter.</p>

<p>"You too! We shall all be raving maniacs soon! It isn't to be
borne&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What did he do?"</p>

<p>"Nothing that he hasn't done before&mdash;it was the way of
it&mdash;the horror&mdash;the grotesqueness, he touched me too, and
I've grown to loathe him so&mdash;Oh! go up to him and stop that
cursed bell!"</p>

<p>The doctor looked at her with something of the same dismay as
Marianna had felt; he also had come to look upon her as the one
person who was always controlled, resigned, schooled to
endurance.</p>

<p>He offered her some brandy; Lucie would not raise her head.</p>

<p>Insistent, the bell clanged once more.</p>

<p>"Oh, for God's sake," moaned Lucie.</p>

<p>He left her to return in a few moments and find her in the same
attitude.</p>

<p>"I have done what I could for him, but he wants you&mdash;Lucie,
you should go. The poor devil really did not know what he was
doing."</p>

<p>Lucie raised her distorted face.</p>

<p>"I will not go."</p>

<p>He turned to the servant.</p>

<p>"Go upstairs and say that your mistress is resting now, but that
she will come up presently. Sit with him till he falls asleep."</p>

<p>Marianna went at once, piteously anxious to be of service and,
as soon as he was free of the servant's presence, Carlo Ghisleri
raised Lucie from her miserable position; but she resisted him.</p>

<p>"I never meant to do this&mdash;I wanted to bear it and be
brave, but it's happened, I've made a shameful display. I want to
go away&mdash;from you, too, from both of you&mdash;I want to be
free&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My poor Lucie, my poor child&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't want," said Lucie passionately, "your sacrifices or
your love&mdash;what is the use of it? You daren't kiss me. I won't
stay to be slandered&mdash;to be abused&mdash;to be
threatened&mdash;you see what has happened, I've broken down. I
can't go on."</p>

<p>"You would not stop when I wanted you to, Lucie. I knew that
this must happen. You undertook too much."</p>

<p>Lucie was sitting by the kitchen table; she drank the brandy in
the wild hope that it would steady her aching head, her throbbing
nerves.</p>

<p>"Come out in the open air," he said. "We can't talk in
here."</p>

<p>"Yes, take me away from the house&mdash;anything as long I don't
have to go upstairs&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I have given him morphia. He is very weak. There isn't much
more of it for him, the poor wretch lives in a delirium."</p>

<p>"Come outside," said Lucie desperately.</p>

<p>They hurried, as if driven by their passions like a wind, from
the house out into the deserted seashore.</p>

<p>It was warm, but a stiff breeze was blowing and the clouds hung
low and dark over a ruffled sea.</p>

<p>There was no one abroad, no boat, no bird, no beast&mdash;only
the long line of empty houses in the pine wood, the strip of sand,
the sea on one hand, the mountains on the other&mdash;shutting you
in.</p>

<p>"The whole place is like a prison!" cried Lucie.</p>

<p>They walked quickly towards Tonfalo.</p>

<p>"Lucie, you will never be happy if you leave him. Your are not
the kind of woman. You must stay now&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You never spoke so before," answered Lucie, "you wanted me to
go&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Lucie, you must have some pity on poor human nature&mdash;but I
never thought you would come&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And you would have despised me if I had," said Lucie
bitterly.</p>

<p>"It would always," he answered simply, "be the same to me
whatever you did. How could I ever despise you?"</p>

<p>"I must get away," said Lucie quickly. "It is nerves&mdash;I see
things&mdash;I'm all to pieces. I can't face seeing him die,
either. I can't face all this scandal. I can't bear to be with you.
Like this."</p>

<p>The wind rose and rain began to fall. In silence he took his
light jacket off and put it over the shoulders of her white frock.
The air was darkening about them and they seemed alone in a great
space of wind and water.</p>

<p>"If it is more than you can bear," he said at length, "I must
take you away."</p>

<p>"No. I want to go away&mdash;alone."</p>

<p>The wind dragged at her dress, unbound her hair and sent it
flying across his shoulders; the rain beat in their faces.</p>

<p>"Ah, you are in rebellion&mdash;against me, too!" he said
sadly.</p>

<p>"This is what I am like&mdash;really. The other is only
pretending. I haven't been quiet&mdash;all my life. Because I was
afraid to let myself go. But this is what I am&mdash;wild,
rebellious&mdash;I've always been like that. Passionately
rebellious against the&mdash;awful life I have had.":</p>

<p>She spoke in deep breaths as she laboured against the wind and
the rain, her bare, sandalled feet sinking into the salt sand with
every step, the flying spray from the surf tossing about her as she
moved.</p>

<p>"I knew," said Carlo Ghisleri.</p>

<p>"I don't think you can know&mdash;what my life has been like. So
sordid. So little. So stupid."</p>

<p>She said no more; she could not tell him that her woe and anger
now was not wholly because of her present atrocious bondage, but
because of all the other miseries that rose up to confront her, the
tragedy of Mrs. Falconer, the tragedy of Sophie, both clinging to
her and not to be shaken off, the tragedy of the dead baby...all
the old unhappiness waiting for a moment like this to cry aloud and
knock at her heart.</p>

<p>He saw that she was becoming exhausted and drew her aside into
one of the few remaining capuane which stood solitary near the now
swollen stream, a primitive structure, such as the poorer people
used, of rough boughs interlaced, on which the dry russet leaves
still hung.</p>

<p>The wind had ripped Lucie's white dress from waist to hem and
soaked her thin petticoat, her long hair hung dark on to her
shoulders; she looked at her companion whose thin shirt was wet
through.</p>

<p>He saw her glance of concern and smiled.</p>

<p>"I enjoy it. There cannot be too much wind or rain for me. But
you would like to return?"</p>

<p>"No. It is better here. One feels free," said Lucie. "Why do you
smile?"</p>

<p>"T? see what a woman you are&mdash;you don't want to be free.
You know you are going back to that man."</p>

<p>"Do you wish me to?" asked Lucie.</p>

<p><i>"Via!</i> You don't respect my wishes in the least. You are
pleasing yourself all the time. Even in looking after this man you
have been pleasing yourself, my Lucie."</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" cried the woman angrily. "That isn't fair!"</p>

<p>"It's true. You never did what you did'&mdash;an extraordinary
feat of endurance and courage, <i>cars,</i> because you were
thinking of this poor devil's body or soul, but because you
wouldn't fall beneath your own standard&mdash;you haven't kept me
at arm's length for any reason but those abstract principles of
yours. You've so grown into your code that you don't know
yourself," he smiled again, very tenderly. "You've got to be what
you call respectable, darling, or you can't survive. Therefore, let
us go back."</p>

<p>Lucie felt humbled; this man could read her too easily; she knew
perfectly well that she had not got it in her to cut clear anything
that bound and clogged her; she was too passive, too timid, too
hopelessly feminine.</p>

<p>"I've just made a fool of myself," she said drearily. "Of course
I'll go back. Are you sorry for him?" she added irrelevantly.</p>

<p>"A little, because he loves you, Lucie. You never loved him and
I think he always knew it&mdash;I have a fellow feeling for the
poor wretch&mdash;never to have you wholly&mdash;now not to have
you at all. To be despised by you. Ah, Lucie, if he knew why we
serve him, he might prefer to crawl out into the ditch to die.
Think of that."</p>

<p>Lucie remembered Pio's own words, which Carlo Ghisleri had never
heard and she shivered uneasily.</p>

<p>"You seem to think that to be fond of me is a curse."</p>

<p>"I am sorry for any man who loves you, Lucie&mdash;you absorb so
much of one&mdash;you are too much a woman, there is no end to
you&mdash;you do not stand for peace of mind."</p>

<p>"You speak as if I had ruined yours."</p>

<p>"You've broken up my whole life for me. Made an end of it," he
smiled, <i>"v</i>i<i>a,</i> let us go home."</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; II</p>

<p>Through the north-west wind and rain they went back to the Villa
Calvini.</p>

<p>"There is really nothing but this, Lucie. The day, the night,
the seasons, the earth, the sky, the mountains, the forest. And in
the forest the little house where the woman cooks the food for the
'man who comes home from work."</p>

<p>"The fairy tale?"</p>

<p>"Yes, the fairy tale. The child sits at the woman's knee and she
tells him of giants and mermaids, kings and goblins, and big wars
and big cities and ships and castles, and the man listens for he
knows them all, potentially they are all in him. The child listens,
for he, too, knows them. One day, he will go out and find them. And
perhaps the man will go too. But the woman must stay in the little
house, keeping the fire, cooking the food. She knows that some day
they must come back to her. She is eternal, Lucie. Life, circling,
always comes back to her.</p>

<p>"That is all there is&mdash;just those three in the little
house. The rest is just the wind, and dreams&mdash;and tales."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch31" id="ch31">Chapter Thirty-One</a>
</h2>

<p class="cpb">&sect; I</p>

<p>IT was the first day of November and Lucie had been out with
Carlo Ghisleri very early in the gray stormy morning and he had
dragged home for her a huge bough of cypress heavy with blue
berries that they had found beaten down by the east wind that tore
along the coast.</p>

<p>Later, when he came again, she met him in the hall and took him
into the <i>salotto</i> where the big bough was propped up behind
the stove.</p>

<p>"Pio wants to get up," she said; she was very quiet and resigned
now; she never lamented or showed any irritation, she never spoke
of the future. "He seems changed this morning. Much better," she
smiled faintly. "He is sitting up in bed now, looking at patterns
for spring suits, matching them with the tie I sent him last
Christmas&mdash;and is worrying where we are to go when the lease
of the house is up."</p>

<p>Carlo Ghisleri looked at her tenderly; he, too, had lost
something of his radiant glance, something even of his serenity of
late; but still, with proud and sweet composure he was able to turn
everything he handled into something strong and beautiful.</p>

<p>"Let him get up, then, <i>cara,"</i> he said.</p>

<p>"He has been in bed two months. I thought people would say that
we were trying to kill him."</p>

<p>"They will say that anyhow. Let him get up."</p>

<p>"And out&mdash;he wants to go out. I think he wants it more than
he ever wanted anything," said Lucie. "You see, I've been
trying&mdash;since you spoke about it, not to let it all be for my
own sake&mdash;trying to see it from his point of view. So I
thought&mdash;if he could go out&mdash;"</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; II</p>

<p>The storm had abated and pale sunshine illuminated the rain
washed coast as the sick man was helped by doctor, wife and servant
down the gray stone stairs, all three people supporting and
absorbed in this poor human being to whom they had given their most
tireless devotion.</p>

<p>It had taken Lucie over an hour to dress him; so slow had been
the progress, so frequent the rests, the pauses, the changes of
mind as to what he should wear; now he was arrayed in the clothes
he liked best, an expensive light suit, patent boots, the very
extravagant tie Lucie had sent him at Christmas, a covert overcoat
and a pale felt hat, with exact adjustment of rings, watch and
chain, cane and handkerchief. He had even contrived to shave
himself with the safety razor Dr. Ghisleri had given him.</p>

<p>The ravages of his illness were, of course, far more apparent
than they had been when he was in bed, or seated in a dressing-gown
in his own room; he looked a bitter caricature of humanity, a
devilish fantasia on youth and humanity.</p>

<p>It seemed impossible that anything so bowed and shrunken, so
hollow, so feeble, so distorted of feature and twisted of limb
could move and speak.</p>

<p>But the intense delight that this adventure gave him, and his
resolution not to let his weakness spoil his pleasure was apparent
in the set of his slack lips, the steady gaze of his sunken
eyes.</p>

<p>Marianna rejoiced as whole-heartedly as if he had been someone
dear to her instead of the tyrant who had abused and threatened her
with such heartless ingratitude.</p>

<p>He wanted to go all over the house; he peered into the dark
dining-room where Lucie had her meals; he went into the
kitchen.</p>

<p>There was a pile of persimmons on the table; he looked at the
smooth yellow fruit greedily and asked why they hadn't been brought
up to him.</p>

<p>"They are not ripe," said Lucie gently. "Perhaps one will be
this afternoon."</p>

<p>He went into the <i>salotto</i> and handled her writing paper,
her sketches, her books.</p>

<p>Lucie shivered with distaste; she had become resigned to him up
in his bedroom&mdash;but as part of her daily life&mdash;</p>

<p>He saw the big cypress branch and pointed to it with a shaking
finger.</p>

<p>"Who brought that in? It is too heavy for you&mdash;"</p>

<p>Lucie felt a sick rage she could not repress rise against him
always when she was endeavouring to be compassionate, he did
something that repelled her; she could not meet the look in his
eyes now and still pity him.</p>

<p>"I brought it in," said Dr. Ghisleri.</p>

<p>"For me?" asked Pio, and he looked from one to the other with a
hateful furtive glance.</p>

<p>"For the <i>signora.</i>"</p>

<p>"Ah!"</p>

<p>He said he wished to go into the garden and they helped him down
the <i>salotto</i> through the door at the back; he poked round
with his stick under the shrivelled vine and withered apple tree;
then he directed that they should take him to the low wattled fence
that separated the strip of <i>pineta</i> (it was in no sense a
garden) from the villa of Carlo Ghisleri.</p>

<p>This fence, at first but a couple of feet in height, had lately
been added to, till it was above the measure of a man, and all the
undergrowth had been cut away so that there was neither foothold
nor concealment along the whole length of the boundary between the
two houses.</p>

<p>"It has been altered," said Pio, peevishly.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Carlo Ghisleri. "You see, I thought of
that."</p>

<p>"Of what?" asked Lucie.</p>

<p>She had seen Agostino working on the fence and never given the
matter any attention.</p>

<p>"Signor Simonetti," said the doctor ceremoniously, "is timid. He
dreads burglars. He is afraid of people breaking in at night.
Therefore I thought that if T made this fence impossible to climb,
impossible, do you notice, signor?&mdash;he would be in no fear of
anyone breaking in by way of my premises."</p>

<p>"Let us go into the front garden," said Pio, sullenly.</p>

<p>They helped him to totter slowly there and led him by his
request to the gate which he examined suspiciously.</p>

<p>"That is safe enough," said Lucie, "Marianna locks it every
night, never later than ten. And you have the key of it, and the
front gate, in your room."</p>

<p>"One might climb it," answered Pin; he looked at the man
supporting him and Lucie read in his eyes the crudest calculation
as to the possibility of that man climbing that gate; Lucie
understood about the fence now; so Pio had just wished to get up
that he might spy on her.</p>

<p>"I think you had better come in now," she said dully. "No, no,"
panted Pio, "I want to see the doctor's house&mdash;I want to go
next door&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Very well, I will take you," assented Carlo Ghisleri. But Lucie
could not go.</p>

<p>"I will wait here."</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; III</p>

<p>She went up on to the terrace and watched them; it seemed a
profanation to see that man seated under the oleanders, his feet on
the Tyrolese clover.</p>

<p>He was drinking and smoking, the doctor standing beside his
chair.</p>

<p>The sunlight had faded to be seen no more that day; sky and sea
were even in colourlessness; in the east was a darkness as of a
coming storm; two slim warships showed on the horizon, steaming
from Spezia to Leghorn.</p>

<p>How curious to think there was a world of strange happenings
going on now beyond the confines of the Villa Calvini.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; IV</p>

<p>As he was helped upstairs again he remembered the
persimmons.</p>

<p>He would go and count them; Marianna, he said, was a thief and
the fruit was expensive.</p>

<p>Thirty-three! That was far too many to buy at once. Thirty-three
persimmons!</p>

<p>He would remember that and see that he got them all.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; V</p>

<p>Towards evening when Pio slept, they went out into the sombre
chill twilight and walked quickly along the gloomy shore.</p>

<p>They always tried to get as far as the little <i>capuana</i>
Tonfalo which was so rough that it was not worth the trouble of
pulling down, for the wind whistled beautifully through the dry
bamboo canes and withered branches, the real pan pipes; Lucie's
children, he said, calling to her, babies' voices, whispering,
laughing.</p>

<p>Then they would talk of these dream children till they became
radiant with the brightness of their dreams, bewildered with the
glory of the mirage.</p>

<p>But to-night Lucie listened with a distracted ear to the music
in the reeds.</p>

<p>"Did you see what he meant this morning?" she asked sadly. "He
has horrible suspicions."</p>

<p>"Well, <i>cara,</i> what would you? Anyone would think what he
thinks, you know."</p>

<p>"Not in England," said Lucie, stoutly.</p>

<p>"We are in Italy. In any place&mdash;you are, well, not a common
type of woman, and I have behaved far better," he smiled, "than
anyone would give me credit for&mdash;"</p>

<p>Lucie was still saddened and bewildered; she had never been able
to imagine, to stage one of these intrigues that other people
seemed to credit so easily; grossness always eluded her; she didn't
quite believe in it.</p>

<p>"I don't think people are like that," she said at last. "No one
would&mdash;do that kind of thing&mdash;with a sick man&mdash;and
people like Marianna, and Agostino about&mdash;it would be vulgar,
wouldn't it?"</p>

<p>"I always knew you didn't understand, much."</p>

<p>"Of what?"</p>

<p>"Passion."</p>

<p>"Oh! I don't know. I've nothing to go by. I can't tell if my
feelings are the same as the labelled
ones&mdash;passion&mdash;perhaps not&mdash;not if it means that
sort of thing, coming down at night to&mdash;to meet
someone&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;all that Pio thinks. I couldn't
do that. I don't see how one could."</p>

<p>"There certainly are not," he agreed drily, "many facilities
here."</p>

<p>Lucie looked at him wistfully and curiously; for the first time
she felt alien and far away; for the first time she
thought;&mdash;"How much there is in his life I don't know of; how
many times he has done 'this sort of thing'; how much he knows and
understands that I never can!"</p>

<p>He was quick to notice her abstraction.</p>

<p>"<i>Via</i>&mdash;hark at your babies scolding you for your sad
face&mdash;"</p>

<p>Lucie bowed her head against the singing reeds; poor pretence
babies, sometimes they did not help you&mdash;much.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; VI</p>

<p>Pio had chloral every night now and Dr. Ghisleri always came to
give it to him about nine o'clock.</p>

<p>This evening when he came Lucie told him:</p>

<p>"Pio is much better. Even after that exertion this morning. He
has slept all day and is still drowsy."</p>

<p>She went up with him into the tidy lamp-lit sick-room which was
fragrant from the bay leaves simmering in the pot boiling on the
stove.</p>

<p>Both the door on to the terrace and the window stood open for
the sick man had more than ever difficulty with his breathing.</p>

<p>Luck went out to the terrace and stood in the dark amid the
blowing tops of the pine trees that swayed together in the quick
sea wind.</p>

<p>Very soon Carlo Ghisleri game out to her.</p>

<p>"We must telegraph to his people," he whispered. "He is
dying&mdash;fast."</p>

<p>"The end?&mdash;really the end?"</p>

<p>"Really the end, Lucie."</p>

<p>"Can I do anything?"</p>

<p>"No. Wait here for me. I shall return."</p>

<p>When he had gone, the woman crept to the door of the room and
stood looking in at the lamplight and the figure in the bed, lying
as she had so often seen it lie&mdash;no difference in any of the
familiar details which appeared as ever, monotonous, eternal; yet a
few hours now and the figure would not be there and the room would
be shut up and her duties ended.</p>

<p>Ended&mdash;really the end!</p>

<p>She tried to convince herself of the reality of things by
words.</p>

<p>"My husband. Dying. I shall be free."</p>

<p>She found she was shuddering, her teeth chattering, she crossed
the sick-room and went downstairs.</p>

<p>Dr. Ghisleri was in the dining-room, writing on telegram forms
by candle light, Marianna was standing beside him; Lucie crept into
the kitchen; she selected two of the ripest persimmons and put them
on a green plate, laid a silver spoon and some sugar beside them
and carried them upstairs.</p>

<p>Pio had not moved; he lay on his back and his breathing was like
a continuous snore.</p>

<p>"Pio," she said, "Pio, I've brought up the
persimmons&mdash;look&mdash;"</p>

<p>He took no notice and she set the plate down; she went on her
knees and took his cold, damp, bluish hand in hers.</p>

<p>"Pio," she whispered desperately, "I have tried, you know, don't
you?"</p>

<p>The words sounded so paltry, and she could not have explained
why she was on her knees to him, what possible wrong she had ever
done him, but there she knelt, beseeching as if she had been a
penitent.</p>

<p>"Pio&mdash;you do know&mdash;don't you&mdash;that what you
thought&mdash;this morning&mdash;"</p>

<p>She could not say it; the words seemed so stupid, and the dying
man had taken no notice save to flutter his hand a little, a
gesture she took to mean "do not disturb me."</p>

<p>She stooped and kissed him.</p>

<p>He opened his eyes at that.</p>

<p>"It is a long time since you have kissed me."</p>

<p>Ah! she had cause for remorse, after all!</p>

<p>"Pio, I won't leave you."</p>

<p>He seemed pleased.</p>

<p>"And Dr. Ghisleri? Will he stay?"</p>

<p>"He will stay."</p>

<p>"I am getting better, am I not?"</p>

<p>"Yes, oh, yes, Pio."</p>

<p>"I am tired. I feel as if I was breaking to pieces."</p>

<p>He closed his eyes and dozed again.</p>

<p>Lucie stole downstairs.</p>

<p>Carlo Ghisleri was still seated at the table which was strewn
with telegrams to every member of the Simonetti family.</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Lucie. "They won't come. And he doesn't want to see
them."</p>

<p>"They must come. I shall insist."</p>

<p>"For his sake?"</p>

<p>"For yours, you stupid woman."</p>

<p>"They can't help me."</p>

<p>"They can. They can stop these evil tongues&mdash;ruffians as
they are, they can give a face of decency to the thing.</p>

<p>It is incredible that they should stay away&mdash;if they do,
the scandal here will be intolerable."</p>

<p>"Ah! scandal!"</p>

<p>Lucie thought he troubled too much about scandal.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; VII</p>

<p>For two days and nights they never left him alone; as he still
lingered on the third night, Carlo Ghisleri took the night watch
while Lucie slept downstairs.</p>

<p>Marianna had not taken her clothes off either for all those
hours; her sister had come to help, and an odd woman, very poor and
pale, had offered herself for any menial task in this crisis; she
was a meek creature who was not afraid of infection as her own
husband had died of consumption.</p>

<p>So the little household was altered and everything about it
became different and strange; odd meals were snatched at strange
hours, everyone spoke in whispers; the lassitude of sheer fatigue
overcame Lucie; the shivering monotony of those long hours by the
bedside of the torpid man, always with the window open and the wind
and rain beating in till her head ached with neuralgia, dulled her
spirit; it became just a question of endurance; the fierce effort
of the spent runner at the end of the race.</p>

<p>Pio appeared to be unconscious, often delirious, often asleep;
but he knew when she left him and when Dr. Ghisleri was not within
call he appeared to have a vital need of both of them.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; VIII</p>

<p>All the Simonetti replied (the wires were prepaid) but none
could come; the word "impossible" figured in all their excuses.</p>

<p>Lucie was rather relieved, but Carlo Ghisleri was deeply
angered, and exclaimed passionately against these <i>"cani dei
Siciliani."</i></p>

<p>"Is there no one in England who would come?" he asked. "No one,"
said Lucie.</p>

<p>"You ought to have someone here&mdash;your uncles, now." Lucie
smiled; his ideas of family life were so different from hers; she
never could make him understand.</p>

<p>"You've no idea what a 'stray' I am. I'm quite alone."</p>

<p>"But this aunt you lived with?"</p>

<p>"I have to look after her. She&mdash;she's, oh,
emotional&mdash;she came&mdash;when&mdash;the little girl
died...she made it worse."</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; IX</p>

<p>The fourth day he still lived, kept alive by champagne and
morphia; the doctor slept (such sleep as he could snatch) in the
little room that had been Lucie's, and she rested in the gaunt
downstairs bedroom, with the other women.</p>

<p>It seemed as if Pio could not die, nor the rain stop. The women
kept whispering together about the priest, but Lucie paid no
attention till Carlo Ghisleri said to her:</p>

<p>"If he does not receive extreme unction, it will be
difficult&mdash;afterwards."</p>

<p>"But he would loathe it&mdash;and he doesn't think he is
dying.</p>

<p>"I know. But I have sent for the priest&mdash;he will come up
when&mdash;the patient is&mdash;no longer conscious&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Is that possible?"</p>

<p>"I have arranged with the priest&mdash;he is a very good friend
of mine."</p>

<p>"It is all queer," said poor Lucie, "Pio joined the English
Church when we married to please Mrs. Falconer&mdash;and then does
the priest know I'm a heretic?"</p>

<p>"I told him," said Dr. Ghisleri gravely, "that you belonged to
the Church of Ireland."</p>

<p>"Oh! But I can't live up to that. Do keep him
away&mdash;it's&mdash;it's&mdash;ghastly&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You'll do what I tell you&mdash;for once," he replied.</p>

<p>So that morning the priest came, to the intense gratification of
the women downstairs; Lucie saw him from the window of the black
bedroom; he was struggling with a huge green umbrella that swayed
in the deluge and carried under his arm a small box.</p>

<p>But the doctor would not allow him to come upstairs; Pio might
be conscious.</p>

<p>Three times that day the priest fought cheerfully through the
gale with his umbrella and his box, waited awhile in the kitchen to
hear the doctor's verdict, then departed, struggling with wind and
rain.</p>

<p>Another wild night closed over them and still Pio lived.
"To-morrow," said Lucie, "is Sunday and the anniversary of the day
the little girl was born&mdash;November the 6th." At length the
beating rain had diminished a little and they stood out on the
terrace in darkness and eager wind. "It will be to-morrow," said
Carlo Ghisleri, "this cannot go on."</p>

<p>Some of her old terrors returned to Lucie; in sheer weakness she
turned and clung to him.</p>

<p>But he would not admit that there was anything ugly or horrible
about this.</p>

<p><i>"Via,</i> Lucie, <i>via</i>&mdash;feel the good clean spirits
in the rushing winds, blowing through the house and purifying it!
How much power and splendour abroad to-night! And he&mdash;not
suffering, Lucie, passing on to blend with the great winds, done
with the old stupidities, the pains and follies! Smile for him,
Lucie, laugh with him!"</p>

<p>He put his arm around her and she closed her eyes; powerful,
sweet, the wind blew out of the darkness, lapping round them, like
waves, like flame.</p>

<p>"Grief is only weakness, <i>cars.</i> The strong are always
happy. Think how we have found one another. Think how much more
important that is than any death."</p>

<p>She said faintly:</p>

<p>"Could you kiss me&mdash;now? Then I will go back to him."</p>

<p>He kissed her with that deep tenderness she valued more than
passion, and she turned, out of the dear, friendly night, the
magnificent wind, the unseen trees, into the lamp-lit room.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; X</p>

<p>She never left Pio till the next day, at six o'clock, he
suddenly sat up and asked for a piece of money.</p>

<p>There was some in his drawer and she rose, fetched this, and
gave it to him; Carlo Ghisleri had just left the room and she was
alone.</p>

<p>Pio took the money, fumbled with his night shirt as if to find a
pocket and whispered; "Come nearer."</p>

<p>Lucie sat on the edge of the bed; he turned, but blindly, it
seemed, towards her; she put her arms round him.</p>

<p>A quick transformation passed over him; it was as if someone had
got tired of jerking a puppet about, had cut the string and let it
fall.</p>

<p>She controlled herself to lay him back on his pillow, then, as
the last breath surged out of his broken lungs, she ran from the
room and down into the kitchen where Carlo Ghisleri was talking to
Marianna.</p>

<p>"It is over!" said Lucie.</p>

<p>As she spoke she saw the figure of the priest trudging away down
the avenue.</p>

<p>The doctor ran to the window and called lustily after him; it
was the first time he had raised his voice in the Villa
Calvini.</p>

<p>Marianna ran, weeping, upstairs, the other women were instantly
in tears; Lucie feverishly washed her hands in the bowl in the
sink; she could not think at all.</p>

<p>The priest, smiling cheerfully, turned back and came into the
kitchen with his umbrella and his little box.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch32" id="ch32"></a>Chapter Thirty-Two</h2>

<p class="cpb">&sect; I</p>

<p>LUCIE noticed, really without much sense of the meaning or even
the reality of it all, that the priest went quickly upstairs with
Carlo Ghisleri and that the women followed, throwing shawls over
their heads; two men, who had evidently been waiting somewhere
about the house tiptoed after them; one was Martinelli, the other a
gaunt pockmarked creature whom Lucie dimly recognized as the
<i>"fidangato"</i> of Marianna's sister.</p>

<p>The house suddenly seemed in the possession of strangers; Lucie
felt herself completely a foreigner; everything had been taken out
of her hands; she followed the others upstairs.</p>

<p>The priest was standing between the two beds; he had put on a
purple stole and had vested in a surplice; on the bedside table,
hastily cleared of medicine, was spread a cloth, on which was a
little vessel of holy water, oil and cotton wool, a clean towel and
a branch of yew.</p>

<p>Two candles burnt on this table and Carlo Ghisleri standing by
the bed held a third; everyone else was kneeling.</p>

<p>Lucie could not see Pio; he was sunk deep among the pillows. She
knelt down inside the door; Carlo Ghisleri crossed over to her at
once and gave her a cushion; returning instantly to his place.</p>

<p>The priest was saying, very quickly, a Latin prayer, Carlo
Ghisleri gave the responses; several times the priest made the sign
of the cross over Pio and appeared to be directly addressing him;
when he paused, Carlo Ghisleri recited a Latin prayer.</p>

<p>To Lucie the scene was incredible; she could not attach it,
anywhere, to human experience; she followed every detail with
dreadful curiosity; the care with which such an unashamed pagan as
the doctor was taking part in the complicated ceremony, the weeping
of the others, for a man they had never liked, their humble piety
in such contrast to their daily blasphemy, the assumption that Pin
was alive&mdash;all the thrice familiar details of the sick-room
looking unfamiliar&mdash;all combined to make a spectacle of
phantasmagoria to poor Lucie, weak from strain, dazed from
sleeplessness.</p>

<p>Everyone was murmuring Latin now&mdash;some kind of litany she
supposed, while the priest anointed, with a morsel of cotton-wool,
the forehead of the man in the bed.</p>

<p>Lucie noticed that the sprinkler was a branch from the big bough
they had dragged home and that Pio had resented; she noticed the
bottles of digitalis, of camphor, of ether, standing, unimportant
at last, huddled on the back of the drawers.</p>

<p>"I am noticing all the wrong things," she thought
desperately.</p>

<p>It was over; they all trooped out of the room; the windows were
shut, the first time for nearly a year, the shutters were closed
over the cold wet evening; the poor odd woman came hurrying
upstairs again with two huge candles in large stands; Marianna
followed her with two more; they placed them round the bed and lit
them.</p>

<p>Lucie wondered where they had been so instantly procured; the
two women knelt again and began telling their beads.</p>

<p>Lucie went downstairs; her whole being seemed to drift into a
void, she could hardly tell what had happened, whose house this
was, what position she occupied; but her bewildered wits rallied to
the fact of the priest; she liked him and he ought to be thanked;
she felt very grateful to him.</p>

<p>She heard him talking with the doctor in the dining-room, and
then it occurred to her that the priest might have heard some of
those tales about her and think her a "wicked" woman; this idea was
curiously painful and she shrank back; but her very strong sense of
obligation forced her to enter the room.</p>

<p>The doctor was again writing out telegrams; the priest was
drinking a glass of wine; she was sure they were talking of her;
she heard the word <i>"Sicilians"</i> spoken with great
contempt.</p>

<p>As she entered, they both rose and looked at her with the same
expression, one which she could not interpret.</p>

<p>"I want to thank you for all your goodness and patience," she
faltered, "I do appreciate it&mdash;very much&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My dear, dear child," interrupted the old priest; he took her
hand and patted it. "There, there, I'm glad it is over&mdash;you
could not have stood much more of it, there, there, my poor child."
This genuine and warm kindness where she was looking for coldness,
perhaps reproof, unnerved Lucie; the tears came into her eyes and
she leant against the wall.</p>

<p>"How thin she is!" continued the old man. "You will have to take
use of her&mdash;" he addressed the doctor, "she has been so
wonderful."</p>

<p>"I'll look after her," answered Carlo Ghisleri, glancing up from
the sheaf of telegrams; it occurred to Lucie that he was comporting
himself exactly as the master of the house; he went outside with
the priest who said farewell and blessed Lucie as he passed, and
she sat alone in the candle-lit room.</p>

<p>She should now be perfectly free; there was no longer anyone to
shackle her, but she felt as bound as before; after all she had
only changed masters and she hardly knew the quality of this one;
she imagined that already he was different to what he had been.</p>

<p>She heard him go upstairs; she heard the women come down.
Marianna, with a swollen face looked in and asked her if the
<i>padrone</i> had a pair of white socks.</p>

<p>Lucie shook her head, then Marianna said, triumphantly, that she
had bought a pair on the Piazza, some days ago for this
occasion.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; II</p>

<p>Lucie drank a glass half-full of brandy, and went into the
<i>salotto</i> where a lamp had been lit.</p>

<p>Her husband had been dead a few hours and already her whole
universe had been changed.</p>

<p>The <i>salotto</i> was heaped with Pio's clothes which Marianna
kept bringing down in boxes, in armfuls, in drawers, in valises,
and piling them up, on tables, chairs and the red divan.</p>

<p>"The doctor," she said importantly, "says that if they are not
brought down at once they will have to be destroyed and that many a
poor man would be glad of them."</p>

<p>To Lucie these stacks of clothes were the last touches of
nightmare; only the alcohol enabled her to endure it without an
hysterical outburst.</p>

<p>Coats, overcoats, suits, boots, shoes, slippers for every
possible occasion, socks, handkerchiefs, fancy waistcoats,
waterproofs, heavy underclothing, heaps of scarves, piles of
handkerchiefs, motor outfits, travelling rugs, dressing cases,
valises, trouser presses, dozens of odds and ends, useless,
extravagant; hundreds of pounds of her money, spent so lavishly, so
foolishly&mdash;heaps of sheer waste lying at her feet.</p>

<p>The doctor came down.</p>

<p>"What do you want to do with these things, <i>cara?</i>"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>He glanced over the assorted piles.</p>

<p>"No one but a fool would have so many clothes," he remarked. "I
will send them to a hospital in Florence. I did not mean you to see
them."</p>

<p>"Where am I to go?" asked Lucie forlornly.</p>

<p>"I will take you away."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no&mdash;? couldn't go."</p>

<p>She dare not look at him; she was more constrained with him than
she had ever been before.</p>

<p>"Very well. To-morrow then. You cannot stay in this house," he
answered gently. "Do you want to go upstairs?" he added.</p>

<p>She stooped and took from the piles of clothes at her feet the
purple golden tie Pio had worn when he last went out, and a small
red Easter egg.</p>

<p>"Will you give him these? He bought the egg for the baby. You
see he kept it. No, I won't come up.</p>

<p>"It isn't ugly."</p>

<p>"I know&mdash;but I won't&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You are right. It is ugly always."</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; III</p>

<p>He persuaded her to come out into the fresh air; it was quite
dark and still raining, but the wind had dropped; when they had
gone a few paces she looked back at the Villa Calvin; the door on
to the terrace was open and she could see, not the familiar red
glow of the sick-room lamp, but the four flames of the huge
candles.</p>

<p>"I want to go back," shivered Lucie.</p>

<p>He took her back and begged her to eat something or go and
rest.</p>

<p>She would do neither.</p>

<p>"Can't you make all these people go away?" she said; she had
seen Agostino in the kitchen and the doctor's old housekeeper.
"There are so many of them and my head aches so&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You can't send them away," he answered indulgently.</p>

<p>"They have come to sit up all night with Pio. They mean it as a
mark of respect. You must give them wine, brandy, anything you have
and they will be quite happy."</p>

<p>Lucie was repelled.</p>

<p>"What do they do?"</p>

<p>"Oh, just drink and tell tales and keep the evil spirits
off&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is horrible&mdash;I won't have it."</p>

<p><i>"Via,</i> it doesn't do any harm and they like it. It is the
custom here. It would be a scandal to refuse." He spoke as if he
was humouring a child and Lucie resented it.</p>

<p>"We have our customs, too," she said, "and this isn't one of
them."</p>

<p>"Well, Pio wasn't English, was he?"</p>

<p>Lucie nearly wept with vexed grief.</p>

<p>"I don't like it and I don't want it," she protested.</p>

<p>She would have liked to have said that her wishes should be
respected, but she felt the futility of that.</p>

<p>"I think the poor devils deserve it," answered Carlo Ghisleri,
"they've been looking forward to it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A low superstition&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, you've got some superstitions, too."</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; IV</p>

<p>Lucie locked herself into the ground floor bedroom off the
dining-room; the whole crowd of Tuscans had tramped joyously
upstairs carrying fiaschi, bottles of wine and brandy, glasses and
sweet cakes.</p>

<p>Lucie could hear them overhead, laughing, shouting, telling
stories, singing.</p>

<p>She was angry with Carlo Ghisleri for allowing this; she felt it
an outrage; he was already, she thought, taking too much of an
upper hand.</p>

<p>Despite the sleeping draught he had given her, she passed a
hideous, wakeful night.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; V</p>

<p>Lucie remained all the next day shut in the bedroom downstairs;
the women, weeping now, kept coming and going with food, dismal
tales and pious ejaculations.</p>

<p>She would not come out to see the doctor nor allow him to come
in and see her; she sent a message to say that she would see him in
the evening, when all was over.</p>

<p>She heard him whistling and singing about the house and that,
too, seemed to her an outrage; she could not divest herself of the
Gothic idea of death.</p>

<p>When it was dark, Marianna, howling now, and wringing her hands,
came to say that the <i>padrone</i> had been taken away to the
<i>"cappello"</i> in the <i>"campo santo."</i></p>

<p>Pio really gone; the house empty of Pio, at last.</p>

<p>"Everything is packed," said Marianna, grinning through her
tears.</p>

<p>"Packed?"</p>

<p>"<i>Si, signora</i>&mdash;and Stella has gone over to light the
fires, and Agostino has taken over a lot of things&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't understand."</p>

<p>"We are going to the Villa Tristan," grinned Marianna. "And
there won't be any more bell ringing or messes to make, <i>grazia a
Dio!"</i></p>

<p>Lucie went into the dining-room, it was empty; then into the
<i>salotto,</i> where Carlo Ghisleri waited for her; all the
clothes had been cleared away; two large corded boxes stood in the
middle of the floor.</p>

<p>Carlo Ghisleri seemed indeed to have subtly changed. He wore
rough mountaineering clothes and high boots, and he was smoking a
pipe.</p>

<p>Lucie, waiting at the door, stiffened; she felt desperately
helpless and lonely; she felt that in dignity and power she had
lost by Pio's death, and that this man had gained. Never had she
seen him so dominant, so completely at his ease, in such high good
humour.</p>

<p>"What is this Marianna is saying? I want to stay here," said
Lucie.</p>

<p>He took out his pipe.</p>

<p>"You can't. Everything has been taken to the other house. There
is no light here or fire or food."</p>

<p>"You should have asked me if I wished to go."</p>

<p>"There was no question. You must eat, sleep, rest. You can't do
those things here&mdash;it is impossible. Besides the house must be
dismantled, fumigated&mdash;I know not what rubbish&mdash;make
haste and put your coat on."</p>

<p>Lucie hesitated; she was too utterly worn-out to resist, yet she
did not wish to give in meekly.</p>

<p>"I thought I was to be free," she murmured.</p>

<p>He smiled.</p>

<p>"Free! You!"</p>

<p>She put on her hat and coat and followed him.</p>

<p>She waited while he locked up the empty house, she let him take
her arm and lead her to the Villa Tristan, that was ablaze with
cheerful light.</p>

<p>Marianna came running to meet them with cries of welcome.</p>

<p><i>"Signora,"</i> she said, "I gave him the
persimmons&mdash;thirty-one I put in with him&mdash;if he counts
them, I hope he'll remember he had the other two."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch33" id="ch33">Thirty-Three</a>
</h2>

<p class="cpb">&sect; I</p>

<p>THE house of the Villa Tristan consisted of one smallish room
entered directly from the front garden, out of which a staircase
wound to two rooms above.</p>

<p>There were two other doors in this central apartment, one at the
back leading to a kitchen, and two little bed-chambers built on at
the back, one to the right leading to a little slip of a place with
a big window; the corner by this door was cut off by a huge open
fireplace; the window was the same side as the staircase.</p>

<p>There were two low chairs piled with dull silk cushions in front
of the fire, a long plain trestle table and two stools the same,
and a straight cupboard and sideboard in one, at the back.</p>

<p>On the right wall was an almost life-size reproduction of one of
the fragments of the <i>"gigantomarchia,"</i> the plaster yellowed
to the likeness of marble.</p>

<p>The walls were warm cream-washed and that portion above the
sideboard had been decorated by some skilful hand in charcoal and
white chalk, the subject, "Poseidon surrounded by sea-nymphs."</p>

<p>Either side of the frieze hung big boughs of orange, fruit and
leaves.</p>

<p>There was nothing else in the room whatever this first evening
that Lucie crossed the threshold.</p>

<p>It was all very strange to her, unlike anything she had ever
seen before; she knew that it wasn't so with Carlo Ghisleri; it was
the Villa Calvini that had been strange to him; how incredibly
cheap and shabby he would have found the places she was used to
live in, she thought.</p>

<p>There was a good meal on the table but she could not eat; she
sat in the low chair staring dazedly at the huge log fire; she felt
worn out and broken, numb to all feeling, beyond words strange.</p>

<p>And he, who had gone through so much more than she had, who had
taken all her burdens on his shoulders, who had performed duties to
her unthinkable, showed no trace of fatigue or gloom; he coaxed her
to drink some white wine in a blue glass; Lucie, drinking, looking
at him as she drank, saw unabashed triumph and satisfaction in his
face, a pagan splendour in his bearing, a steady passion behind his
serenity.</p>

<p>Lucie put the glass down.</p>

<p>She felt so miserably inadequate; that sick man, "my husband,"
had given her stability, dignity, an anchor; now she was utterly
adrift, indeed the "stray" she had called herself; "taken in and
fed like a homeless cat," she told herself.</p>

<p>Among strangers, too&mdash;what did she really know of these
people, their manner of looking at things, their ways and
customs?</p>

<p>It was easy for him to be serene and happy&mdash;was he not in
his own country?</p>

<p>Was he not in his own world?</p>

<p>For he was a man.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; II</p>

<p>Seeing her reserved depression, he said "goodnight" and left
her; Marianna followed him and shortly returned with a bunch of
keys.</p>

<p>"I have locked the <i>cancello</i> and the door, <i>signora,</i>
and the doctor said I was to give you the keys."</p>

<p>"He is trying to please me by letting me think I am free,"
thought Lucie, "like blowing bubbles to amuse a child."</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; III</p>

<p>There was a fire in the bedroom, too, a square white room with a
deep bed filled with silk cushions and covered with silk blankets.
Above the bed was a lantern that gave a soft light and under it a
cast of one of the Della Robbia <i>"Innocenti."</i></p>

<p>The very simple furniture was white, hand-painted with green
laurels and inscriptions in German; on the table by the bed was a
handsome watch, hanging on a stand and a purple vase of white
roses.</p>

<p>After Marianna had gone Lucie sat by the fire in sheer
weariness.</p>

<p>What did she want, she asked herself, what was wrong now?</p>

<p>She wasn't grateful, she wasn't happy; one duty accomplished,
others rose up, like spectres. Mrs. Falconer, Sophie, urging her to
return, as if their whole lives hung on her presence; taking it for
granted that she would return, when she was free and devote her
life to them; well, she was free now&mdash;free of Pio, anyhow. And
this other man?</p>

<p>She was in his house now, all her affairs in his hands, he set
up as dictator over her life. What did they want or expect of each
other? Like a pursued animal released from a trap darts back there
again to be rid of the hunters, so Lucie's mind doubled to the
prison from which it had escaped.</p>

<p>Marriage.</p>

<p>There is nothing else for a woman, she thought, I must try and
make him marry me.</p>

<p>And where did her freedom, her independence go?</p>

<p>As wife to a man like Carlo Ghisleri she would be his mere echo,
in a few years his slave; once again her own tastes, thoughts,
wishes, would be completely overshadowed, not this time by weak
tyranny and sickness, but by a superior intellect, a stronger
character.</p>

<p>Already he had set her down in his surroundings; she ought to
have been pleased and grateful, but&mdash;</p>

<p>Supposing Pio had been an ordinary husband and the baby had
lived; yesterday there would have been a birthday cake and presents
and a little party&mdash;Mrs. Falconer, happy and pleased, Sophie
married&mdash;she with another baby by now, Sophie with one,
too&mdash;everything ordinary.</p>

<p>"Yes, I should have liked best to have had it ordinary," sighed
Lucie.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; IV</p>

<p>Next day the whole air was sun-washed, the long storm over at
length.</p>

<p>He came early while Marianna was on the Piazza and Lucie was in
the bright little garden that had been freshly filled with dahlias
and geraniums.</p>

<p>"I was horrid last night," said Lucie. "So tired I really slept
last night."</p>

<p>"I meant that you should," he answered.</p>

<p>He followed her into the house.</p>

<p>For a while he spoke of her affairs, the Villa Calvini, the
transference of her property to her present residence, the writing
to the Simonetti family.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Lucie. "And what are you going to do with me?"</p>

<p>"I'm going to marry you," he answered. "You'll have no less, I
know. And it is wrong. I am too old for you. My life is too stormy.
I never meant to marry. In a few years you'll be an old man's
nurse&mdash;and you&mdash;you may not like my manner of
living&mdash;but&mdash;" his voice the beautiful quality of which
made music of his words, took on a note of anguish, "I couldn't let
you go, Lucie."</p>

<p>"I don't want to go. I'll marry you. You know that."</p>

<p>"At once? So that we can go to Florence together?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I'll speak to the <i>sindaco</i> to-day," he said joyously.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; V</p>

<p>That evening he brought her bad news.</p>

<p>"Impetuous fool that I am! In Italy a widow can't marry for a
year after her husband's death. I had forgotten."</p>

<p>"I'll wait," said Lucie.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;cannot wait. The time has been long enough
already."</p>

<p>They looked at each other; it was an impasse.</p>

<p>"You've got to go to Florence and I've got to go to
England&mdash;that will pass the time. I'm happy like this,"
pleaded Lucie.</p>

<p>"Lucie&mdash;will you come away with me now? You've no longer a
husband to consider."</p>

<p>"You won't even consider it! What is marriage&mdash;to a woman
of your intelligence? What hinders you? You say no one cares what
you do&mdash;Lucie, what weighs with you now?"</p>

<p>"The&mdash;children."</p>

<p>He did not press her further; they held the matter in
abeyance.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; VI</p>

<p>Followed golden winter days of perfect companionship, of walks
along a sea shore that no longer appeared desolate; of days spent
on the mountains and in the mountain villages.</p>

<p>Yes, Lucie actually climbed those mountains that, seen so often
from the Villa Calvini, had appeared as prison walls.</p>

<p>They spent all day and every day together; with the dusk he
always came to say "goodnight" and Marianna would lock him out and
give Lucie the keys.</p>

<p>They arranged Pio's affairs with decorum; everything he had left
of any value was sent to his family; his clothes were given to the
hospital in Florence; everyone who had anything whatever to do with
his illness was handsomely rewarded; the health authorities took
over the Villa Calvini and cleaned and disinfected it; the cost of
this was a strain on Lucie's limited resources, but far less than
it would have been had not Carlo Ghisleri been behind her, watchful
for her interests.</p>

<p>Among the books and papers she had left in Sicily and Pio had
brought away with him, she found his letters to her&mdash;nearly
four hundred love letters.</p>

<p>They burnt them in the garden one clear afternoon, in front of
the agaves and geraniums and all other papers and photographs
relating to the dead man, sprinkling them with oil, salt and
wine.</p>

<p>The charred scraps of paper floated away over the seashore, the
sea-lavender and sea pinks, withered and dry; and when they went to
the gate to watch them disappear into the still ether, they saw
them all drift to one point where on a hillock of sand a woman
cloaked in gray knelt and blended with the winter twilight.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; VII</p>

<p>She found a way to recompense Don Jiacinto, the priest.</p>

<p>She ordered a full requiem service with organ and choir and the
new set of funeral hangings that could only be brought out for
<i>"persona signorile,"</i> and she paid double the modest sum he
asked.</p>

<p>Lucie could not go herself for she had no mourning; Marianna
took her place with gloomy importance and told everyone that her
mistress was too stricken with grief to appear.</p>

<p>But Lucie and Carlo had gone up the hills to escape the tolling
of the bells.</p>

<p>That day they walked for hours through the chestnut woods
through which they could always look down on that great space of
light, the sea and sky like liquid silver, between Spezia and
Livorno.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; VIII</p>

<p>At last there was nothing more to do; no possible excuse for
remaining in Forte dei Marni, no glimmer of reason for prolonging
the enchantment.</p>

<p>Mrs. Falconer wrote desperately, urgently, pleading,
commanding.</p>

<p>And Lucie's work was suffering; she wasn't earning anything; and
there were still debts of Pio's to be paid.</p>

<p>And he&mdash;he had his own world to face, his own business, his
own affairs, his friends, his family.</p>

<p>Lucie did not want to know what kind of letters he was
receiving, but she could guess.</p>

<p>Scandal, gossip, blackmail, back-biting&mdash;she had'
resolutely put these out of her head.</p>

<p>But she was aware that they existed, and were waiting to spring
on them, just round the corner.</p>

<p>"I don't see how we can part," she said helplessly. "I've grown
to look to you for everything. To learn everything from you. If
only we could have been married. I'm frightened to part like
this."</p>

<p>And yet there was no alternative; they had discussed the
position over and over again.</p>

<p>They could do nothing without a scandal that would be
intolerable unless they separated.</p>

<p>As they were both Italian subjects, a marriage in England was
not feasible, at least they thought so; and she shrank from his
coming with her, or following her to London; she wanted to lead his
life, not to draw him into hers.</p>

<p>No, better that they should part; she could come back soon, in
May or June, when each had ordered their affairs, and take a villa
in Como or Lago della Garda, perhaps with Sophie or Mrs. Falconer
or both, and next December (still a whole year off!) they could be
married.</p>

<p>This plan which seemed to both of them cold and nebulous was the
best they could evolve after many heart breaking conferences, some
tears on her part and some curses on his; to give the thing more
permanency she wrote news of her secret engagement (hideous word!)
to Mrs. Falconer and he told his family.</p>

<p>Still they became restless and unhappy, as the days shortened
they passed hours of veritable anguish.</p>

<p>"Lucie," he said, when she had begun packing (actually packing
for departure), "we could be married before you left. Don Jiacinto
would do it&mdash;"</p>

<p>She looked up amazed.</p>

<p>"Of course! I never thought&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He is a. very good friend of mine. I belong nominally to the
church. So do you."</p>

<p>Lucie laughed.</p>

<p>"It sounds crazy."</p>

<p>"Well, we are crazy&mdash;both of us."</p>

<p>"Would it be legal?"</p>

<p>"Well, then&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It would be a marriage," he persisted. "I thought," he added,
"you might make it do."</p>

<p>He spoke with such a mingling of humour and anguish that Lucie
laughed again.</p>

<p>"Well, I haven't done much to oblige you," she smiled, half in
jest. "If Don Jiacinto doesn't mind&mdash;but I don't see what good
it would do you," she finished.</p>

<p>"I would take you away for these last few days you are in
Italy."</p>

<p>She could not look at him; she had difficulty in controlling her
own importunate heart.</p>

<p>"You must," he said almost roughly. "Via, what more do you want,
you impossible Puritan&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It's grotesque!" said Lucie. "Oh, I'm getting all muddled up
again. I don't know what is right&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't care," he replied, "there is no need to complicate
it&mdash;we've only got a few days. Will you do it?"</p>

<p>He caught her and held her, which wasn't fair, she thought.</p>

<p>Only a few days&mdash;</p>

<p>She said "Yes."</p>

</h2>

<p class="cpb">&sect; I</p>

<p>LUCIE could not have put into any words or by any medium
expressed, her attitude towards this man.</p>

<p>He seemed to have come into her life like a veritable magician,
turning her hopelessness into joy, transmuting her shabby existence
into splendour, giving her a new vision and a new strength, filling
her barren days with a thousand interests.</p>

<p>And he had cured her of the blight of loneliness that had fallen
over her mind and soul; she had no thought or feeling or fancy so
intimate that he did not discern and sympathize with it; he
understood all her foolish, complicated emotions, all her leaping
untaught enthusiasms, all her fears and reticences: she could hide
nothing from him; that was his most splendid flattery, that he did
not love her for any one aspect, or any false aspect carefully
presented to him, but for what she really was; he knew all her
faults, weaknesses and limitations and glorified them with his
tenderness.</p>

<p>All she had in her of good he encouraged and praised; Lucie's
ardent timid nature expanded gratefully in such an atmosphere; she
had had so little commendation in her own life, but he was not
afraid to be prodigal with his praises, even of her cooking and her
needle-work, the little, little things she loved.</p>

<p>There was nothing that did not appear beautiful when seen
through his eyes, he invested a weed, a lichen cup, a shell, a
pebble with all the splendour and mystery of the Chimera or the
Gorgons, all the shining wonder of the ancient world.</p>

<p>He saw nature in a clear radiance, always serene, always lovely,
kind to those who loved her, kind even when she dealt them
death.</p>

<p>To him cities were but incidents, the forest, the sea, the
mountains were to him the only realities; <i>"levabo
oculos"</i>&mdash;he could in very truth.</p>

<p>He acknowledged no evil but disease, that devil to whom man is
ever building temples with his towns and factories, his damp
churches and sunless monasteries, and he acknowledged no God save
that all-pervading Presence which is only made manifest t? those at
one with Nature.</p>

<p>His life had been all decisive action; regardless of censure,
jealousy, fame, success, he had gone from one endeavour, one
achievement to another, always serene, modest, dominant. Lucie
could have worshipped him for this alone; she was so used to an
atmosphere charged with feminine vacillations, gambles with chance,
scrambles after luck, emotional instability, hysteric crises, with
the mood and whims of a weak sick man, with a variety of fretful,
feverish folk who could not make terms with life or come to grips
with the central facts of existence that such a char-. after as
his, resolute, calm, in every trait magnificent, seemed t? her
godlike; she felt that however long she lived, or however far she
travelled from him, she would be more lonely or more sad now she
had once been loved by such a man.</p>

<p>Her present shining felicity which pervaded her whole being as
the clear winter sunshine pervaded every field and lane, wood and
stream of the Tuscan landscape did not seem to Lucie to have any
permanency; it had too much of the nature of enactment, it partook
too much of the magic of a dream.</p>

<p>She did not believe in this future they discussed so
rapturously, she could not credit anything save the golden sweet
present.</p>

<p>And through all his speech to her ran the note of regret, of
yearning.</p>

<p>"I am too old for you, Lucie. This should have happened twenty
years ago."</p>

<p>"You are youth itself," she would answer, but he would shake his
splendid conqueror's head.</p>

<p>"See my gray hair, Lucie. Ah, what a life we should have had
together, we two&mdash;what I could have done with such a woman as
you beside me!"</p>

<p>And her radiance would be dimmed by anguish for that impossible
glory she had missed.</p>

<p>She dare not think of it&mdash;dare not.</p>

<p>"Still I have met you," she insisted on the triumphant fact.
"Think of a life empty of you! I can't. How can I be grateful
enough? I was afraid of you at first when Pio died. I wanted to be
free! Now I want to be a slave. Your slave."</p>

<p>They stood where the gleaming ripples of the little stream
flowed down from the mountains, stood where the sweet water ran
through the smooth sand into the salt of the Tyrrhenian Sea.</p>

<p>The hills were hyacinth purple against the crystal blue of the
winter sky, and belted beneath their marble crags and peaks by the
lavish gold of the chestnut trees; purple, too, the ocean beneath
the wide pallor of the evening air and empty as if man did not
exist.</p>

<p>The wind blew keen and pure with frost from unknown lands, and
sharp and bright the horns of the young crescent moon showed
through the sombre boughs of the pines. Lucie leant against her
companion.</p>

<p>"What does it matter if there is nothing more?" she said. "Even
if I am to be emptied into the air as a glass of water into the
sea, at least I have had these moments."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch35" id="ch35">Chapter Thirty-Five</a>
</h2>

<p class="cpb">&sect; I</p>

<p>"I WON'T go," said Lucie desperately. "I won't leave you. Why
should I? I am afraid of this parting, afraid to go away."</p>

<p>"It is better that you should go, Lucie," he answered. "We could
not continue this life. And I should do you a wrong to keep you
from your people and your home any longer."</p>

<p>"If you could understand that I have neither!" exclaimed
Lucie.</p>

<p>But there was the double-edged goad always urging her spirit,
the goad of Mrs. Falconer, the goad of the money.</p>

<p>"I ought to go," she added sorrowfully.</p>

<p>"How you torture yourself with this sense of duty," he smiled,
"our last, our worst superstition. If you do not care for these
people, do not go back to them. There are other places besides
London where you can spend this miserable year."</p>

<p>"My aunt loves me. And Sophie looks to me. It is the habit of
all my life to feel responsible towards them. It has been like
chains. Always."</p>

<p>"And you are going back to it?"</p>

<p>"Only for this little while. Only just to see what I can do for
them," pleaded Lucie.</p>

<p>"And yet you were dreaming of freedom when Pio died?"</p>

<p>"I know. But? haven't got it in me to be free. All the liberty
and independence I've had has been wasted on me. I'm glad to give
it up, glad. I've never known what to do with it."</p>

<p>"No woman ever has, Lucie."</p>

<p>"In England we have a great many who seem to&mdash;very
successful and resolute and wonderful, but I&mdash;it never did me
any good to be so independent, to have my own living at my finger
tips, to have no one to check or direct me&mdash;look at my work.
It is rather good, really. I can do a lot of things quite well. But
I could never give that side of me a chance really&mdash;because I
wanted things that did not fit in with a career. And now&mdash;I
don't want to do anything over again. I'm just absorbed in being a
woman&mdash;that makes you passive&mdash;serving, waiting&mdash;I'd
rather make babies' bonnets than paint, I'd rather cook your dinner
than write, I'd rather have you love me than be famous, or useful
or powerful. You see what it is to be a woman!"</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; II</p>

<p>Lucie shrank from the Roman Catholic marriage, it seemed to her
it was her lover's conversion to her superstition.</p>

<p>"It would be some sort of ceremony to bind us together," he
argued. "It would make me feel that you were really mine when you
were so far away."</p>

<p>But Lucie knew there was something else he liked about it the
adventure, the "craziness," the <i>"panache,"</i> the romance, for
these were things she herself loved; the dull and the commonplace
were abhorrent to both of them, and he had never submitted to
either though she had had to live with both so long.</p>

<p>But even while she hesitated they were foiled, as before, by
practical difficulties; there were no people whom they could trust
as witnesses, and Don Jiacinto was not likely to be prevailed upon
to arrange a wholly clandestine ceremony.</p>

<p>They laughed, like two children baulked of a mischief, and spoke
of it no more.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; III</p>

<p>The preparations for departure filled the first days of January,
they were seldom alone and never at leisure.</p>

<p>Lucie had gone to Livorno for the French and English visé on her
passport, and therefore she decided to take the train from Pisa
instead of returning to Viareggio. He would come with her till the
last possible moment they would be together.</p>

<p>So one clear cold afternoon it was really over; farewells had
been said, the weeping munificently rewarded Marianna embraced, not
without heart stirrings, and Lucie and Carlo Ghisleri were in the
little <i>"carrozza"</i> rattling towards Pietrasanta station.</p>

<p>Lucie was surprised by the warmth of the greetings from the
peasants and little shop-keepers as they passed by; whatever
scandal might be abroad these humble folk she scarcely knew by
sight regarded her with simple good will; they halted at the little
flat church to say goodbye to Don Jiacinto and he gave them his
blessing.</p>

<p>"As good as a marriage," said Carlo Ghisleri.</p>

<p>It was curious to be in a train again, among ordinary people;
Lucie felt shy and awkward, half afraid of her companion, who, in
orthodox attire and surroundings, seemed more than half lost to
her; she had again the sensation of being an alien in his world,
while he was in high spirits and great good humour.</p>

<p>They had entered an empty carriage, but at Viareggio four men
got in; Lucie was surprised at her companion's sharp exclamation of
vexation, until she saw him instantly surrounded by the four
voluble newcomers.</p>

<p>His friends.</p>

<p>Lucie moved further into her corner and pulled down her gray
veil; these would be some of the people who hated her, had reviled
her and would find their tales confirmed now.</p>

<p>"It looks just like an elopement," thought Lucie, not without
humour.</p>

<p>She appraised the four men covertly; they all had the very
distinguished air of aristocratic Italians who get their clothes in
London and their servants in Paris; one was a handsome young
soldier, in the showy uniform of the <i>"granateri";</i> all were
extremely well-mannered and never as much as glanced at her. Carlo
Ghisleri held his own with admirable composure.</p>

<p>"Perhaps he is going to pretend that he isn't with me," thought
Lucie, and she was quite prepared to act up to this if it saved him
embarrassment.</p>

<p>But at this moment he turned and presented his friends to her
one by one&mdash;strange to hear herself called "la Signora
Simonetti," and to hear him' speak to her in the third person.</p>

<p>They bowed to her with smiling politeness. Lucie liked all of
them; the young soldier's glance gave her the facile admiration of
the southerner.</p>

<p>Indeed Lucie with a sun-kissed face and bright hair curling
under her smoke-coloured cavalier hat, in her heavy gray travelling
coat, white doeskin gloves and elegant shoes looked a different
creature to the haggard hopeless woman who had journeyed into Italy
a year ago.</p>

<p>Lucie in love took some trouble with her appearance, Lucie
flushed with happiness was a bright graceful charming creature with
a personality both wilful and passionate and yet dignified.</p>

<p>She smiled and talked now quite easily, pleased with the
amiability and courtesy of the strangers, and then was suddenly and
painfully checked' by a chance glance of Carlo Ghisleri's face; he
looked both sombre and displeased and shot her a glance of haughty
reprimand.</p>

<p>Lucie rose instantly, complaining of the heat of the carriage,
and stepped out into the corridor.</p>

<p>The train was rushing past the long belt of wild forest that
before the War had belonged to an Austrian Archduke and Lucie
looked unseeingly at the shapes of the great trees in their golden
foliage as they tore by. In her agitation and abstraction she
slightly leant against the door, which, after the careless Italian
fashion was not latched. It gave, flew wide open and Lucie saw the
steel and gravel of the line whizzing beneath her feet. Instinct
made her stand motionless; the men in the carriage all sprang
forward; the young soldier who was the nearest caught hold of her
and pulled her back; it took two of them to close the door which
had swung against the wind.</p>

<p>Pisa was reached almost immediately and Lucie found herself on
the platform of the huge iron and brick station feeling both
foolish and humiliated.</p>

<p>"Why are you angry with me?" she asked at once, as soon as her
companion had finished with the porter.</p>

<p>"To laugh with those men! And we have to part in a few
hours."</p>

<p>"Aren't they your friends?"</p>

<p>"Friends, no!"</p>

<p>"Well, I was only civil."</p>

<p>"I shall never like to see you like that with strangers. There
you are too English."</p>

<p>"I suppose I am," said poor Lucie in amazement. He vented his
irritation now on the meeting.</p>

<p>"Are we never to be free of this espionage, never at peace? Why
must we run on those fools? This will be all over Florence."</p>

<p>"Does it matter?" asked Lucie wearily.</p>

<p>He looked at her more kindly.</p>

<p>"If you were a woman who used for her reputation, you wouldn't
say that."</p>

<p>"I'm not. If I'm offending the customs of your country, I'm
sorry. But I don't feel as if I was doing anything scandalous."</p>

<p>Her lip quivered and she let down her veil.</p>

<p>"You need not resent it that I dislike to compromise you," he
answered. "For one so puritanical you are very careless of
appearance."</p>

<p>Lucie sighed with dismay; they had come near to
quarrelling&mdash;at the last minute; the scene had, too, that
horrible element of the ridiculous that Lucie was too quick to
discern; the argument on the long, dirty, empty platform with their
hand luggage at their feet, while the blowed porter waited at a
respectful distance with her trunks.</p>

<p>Carlo Ghisleri had arranged, with complete prudence, that he was
to see Lucie to the hotel where she had wired for rooms, then to go
to Livorno and meet her there to-morrow when she went for her
visé.</p>

<p>Under this scheme they had but half an hour and it seemed
impossible to Lucie that they should part like this.</p>

<p>"Take a later train," she suggested, "and let us go and have tea
somewhere."</p>

<p>"Do you mean that?"</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>"I don't deserve it," he said quickly. "Forgive me, darling. But
it is better for me to go at once."</p>

<p>They looked at each other but the moment was too strong for
them.</p>

<p>"I told my friends that I was going on to Livorno on business.
We might meet someone in Pisa," he still hesitated.</p>

<p>"I really don't care. I want you to stay."</p>

<p>"Where did you wire for your room?"</p>

<p>"To the <i>'Splendide.</i>'"</p>

<p>"An unbearable place&mdash;for commercial travellers. I will
take you to the <i>'Tritone.</i>' You will like that&mdash;"</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; IV</p>

<p>It was a cold but radiant day, of flashing sunbeams under
luminous rain-clouds; the still spaces of the air lay like a wash
of light over the beautiful town, the double curve of the
time-stained marble palaces sweeping all the high banks of the
yellow tumbling waters of the Arno that raced to the sea now so
near, spanned by the graceful arches of the noble old bridge.</p>

<p>The cold had disbanded the usual groups of students and idlers
and the town seemed empty; in its obvious decay, in its ruined
beauty, in its majestic lines telling of an older more leisured
age, in something forlorn in the barren river and deserted palaces,
it touched the heart with a sense of melancholy, of yearning, of
regret.</p>

<p>Lucie however felt the clouds lift from her heart as they
rattled through the cobbled streets in the shabby little
<i>"vettura"</i> with Carlo Ghisleri by her side; she always
reacted to the stimulus of beauty.</p>

<p>They drove towards Pisa Marina, feeling the sea breeze in their
faces as the low clouds shifted and raced across the liquid depths
of the blue ether, and stopped at a lonely and deserted point at
the end of the left side of the Lung' Arno.</p>

<p>Lucie saw a flat-topped house of the usual mediaeval type,
yellowish marble with horseshoe arched windows, heavy stone
balconies and delicate pilasters.</p>

<p>Above the door was a faded coat-of-arms painted on a shield.</p>

<p>The interior of the place was as peaceful, as ancient seeming as
the outside; a placid old man received them without surprise and
immediately consigned Lucie the whole of the "<i>piano nobile</i>";
the place was empty, appeared to have always been empty and to have
little hopes of ever being anything else; the ground floor was
furnished as a restaurant, and either this paid, or the proprietor
had some other way of earning his living.</p>

<p>"It is not the season," said the old man calmly. "I don't quite
know why we keep open."</p>

<p>Lucie was delighted with the place, so remote, dignified, so
full of character and personality, and Carlo Ghisleri was pleased
with her pleasure.</p>

<p>"We will dine here," he said, "there are several late trains to
Pisa."</p>

<p>They sat at one of the long tables already covered with a limp
white cloth; tea of course was out of the question, there was good
coffee and damp sweet biscuits and marzipane&mdash;but for dinner
you could have anything you liked.</p>

<p>Lucie went upstairs while her companion ordered this dinner, a
matter of time and ceremony.</p>

<p>There were two bedrooms, two antechambers and a <i>"salotto"</i>
in the centre, all with painted canvas walls representing sylvan
scenes in sad tones of green, the main room having a huge Venetian
candelebra in coloured glass, and a suite of red plush covered
furniture arranged exactly on the red tiled floor; this opened into
the large balcony; each bedroom on to a smaller one, all looked
directly down on to the narrow roadway, the low parapet and the
turbid waters of the Arno.</p>

<p>All the rooms were sombre, shadowy with a worn and threadbare
look in all the furnishing yet full of melancholy, dignity, and sad
distinction.</p>

<p>Lucie, shuddering in the cold enclosed air, asked the slipshod
old chambermaid for a fire in one of the bedrooms, and the
<i>"salotto"</i>. She glanced at herself in the long, dull,
greenish mirror, in her gray clothes, nothing bright but her hair;
she looked, in the depths of the old looking-glass, as if she was
some ghost returned to her ancient home.</p>

<p>How far off already seemed the Villa Calvini&mdash;Marianna,
Villa Tristan&mdash;the memory of Pio, how further off still
(relegated indeed to an impossible distance) that world to which
she was so soon returning&mdash;Mrs. Falconer, Sophie, London.</p>

<p>To Lucie, sharply aware of the atmosphere, keenly alive to
surroundings, it seemed as if this place cut her off from all she
had experienced and all she was going to experience; the present
moments were isolated, unique.</p>

<p>She went downstairs smiling.</p>

<p>"You like the place?" asked Carlo Ghisleri.</p>

<p>"Of course, but it is haunted, I think."</p>

<p>"I like that. Haunted by real lives, not by the mere echoes of
gettings up and lyings down and eating and gossiping. Things really
happened here."</p>

<p>"It was a private house?" asked Lucie.</p>

<p>"The palace of the Sebaldi&mdash;one of the daughters loved your
poet Byron when he was their neighbour here." Lucie pulled on her
gauntlet gloves.</p>

<p>"Shall we go out? There is nowhere to sit," she said. "The
<i>'salotto'</i> is so cold&mdash;what time is dinner?"</p>

<p>"At seven&mdash;you must be hungry."</p>

<p>"And your train?"</p>

<p>"Oh, there are plenty of trains."</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; V</p>

<p>They walked the cold twilight streets of Pisa. The keen air,
blowing up from the sea, along the deep dark river, made Lucie
shiver through her thick coat; yet it was a pleasurable sensation;
above the sharp outline of the sombre palaces along the Lung' Arno
the sky now clear of vapour, paled to a pellucid azure tinged with
saffron; they crossed the first bridge they came to and stood on
the middle of the beautiful arch, looking down into the rapid
ochre-ish waters.</p>

<p>He told her how he won a race here years before&mdash;rowing
from Florence "in the Venetian manner" and he showed her the steps
where he had landed.</p>

<p>"Afterwards we had dinner at the <i>'Tritone'</i>&mdash;it was
gay then. Now it has changed management and decayed, the whole city
has decayed."</p>

<p>Lucie looked at him as he leant on the parapet of the ancient
bridge. His serene and stately figure so magnificently above the
common make and size, his noble good looks, made him appear as if
he, like the city, belonged to another and more spacious time.</p>

<p>The dim lights, at long intervals, began to show along the
embankment, the primitive illumination of the scattered lamps,
scarcely changed from that of the Middle Ages, were in keeping with
the ancient city.</p>

<p>The moon, nearly full and glowing white, mounted through the
purple flush of the dusk, and showed above the shadowed forms of
the silent palaces.</p>

<p>"Lucie," said the man quietly, "I should not have been vexed
to-day. But it has been a long strain. This constant espionage!
This living under the microscope! My nerves are chafed."</p>

<p>"I should not have thought that possible," she answered
gently.</p>

<p>"Nor I. But it happened. I was deeply vexed we met those men. As
soon as I am in Florence I shall tell them that you are going to be
my wife."</p>

<p>"Just as you wish. As you said, I am careless of those points.
Living as I've lived makes you simply grasp at the realities, when
you get them, without counting the cost," smiled Lucie.</p>

<p>"Even if some tale, some scandal got to England, would you
care?"</p>

<p>"No.&mdash;I'm too happy."</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; VI</p>

<p>They prolonged the pleasant dinner in the big, dim, half-empty
restaurant.</p>

<p>He would go by the 8.45&mdash;he would go by the 9.30. He missed
that and there was a two hours' wait for the next.</p>

<p>"It is childish to go at all," said Lucie. "Stay and we can go
by the first train in the morning."</p>

<p>"Stay here?"</p>

<p>"Why not?" Lucie drank her white wine slowly. "According to you
I've no reputation to lose and I like to have you near. And no one
knows. I do feel that a relief, too&mdash;to be among strangers and
not to have to think of the effect one is making!"</p>

<p>"Yes. It was killing me. More than you know, Lucia. I'll
stay&mdash;if you really want it."</p>

<p>"I really want it."</p>

<p>It did indeed seem incredible that he should leave her
now&mdash;horrible that he should go away in the night leaving her
alone; something might happen to one of them before the morning;
Lucie clung to the flying skirts of Fate.</p>

<p>"No, no, you mustn't go."</p>

<p>They went up to the big <i>"salotto"</i> where a generous fire
of orange wood burnt; the room was pleasantly warm. "Did you
<i>sign</i> the book for me here?" asked Lucie. "Yes, they think
you are a relation under my charge&mdash;they are half-dead. Don't
trouble about them."</p>

<p>They sat in the faded red chairs with no light but the blaze of
the logs.</p>

<p>"Read to me, Lucie. That English poetry that I cannot understand
but which is so beautiful. She fetched one of the little books she
had bought in Viareggio and sat at his feet. By the firelight she
read:</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
"I sing of Brooks, of Blossoms, Birds and Bowers,<br>
Of April, May, of June and July flowers,<br>
I sing of Maypoles, Hock-carts, Wassails, Wakes,<br>
Of Bridegrooms, Brides and of their Bridall-cakes.<br>
I write of Youth&mdash;of Love&mdash;"</p>

<br>

<p>The flame faded.</p>

<p>"I can't see," said Lucie.</p>

<p>He took her hand; the flame spurted up as another log
caught.</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">
"I sing of Time's banshifting; and I write<br>
How Roses first came red and Lilies white<br>
I write of Groves, of Twilights&mdash;"</p>

<br>

<p>"What have you put on my finger?" asked Lucie. It was his
mother's wedding-ring.</p>

<p>"Will you wear it always&mdash;always?"</p>

<p>The book dropped, she bent her head on his knee and her eyes
were hot with sudden tears.</p>

<p>"Always&mdash;always."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch36" id="ch36">Thirty-Six</a>
</h2>

<p class="cpb">&sect; I</p>

<p>INCREDIBLY far away seemed everything to Lucie; these transient
moments had more permanency than any long period she had known; it
seemed intolerable that this should end, yet it did not matter at
all that it was so fleeting; it <i>was</i>, it had actually
happened and the whole of her life would be filled and changed, as
a clear white glass is filled and changed when a rich coloured
perfumed wine is poured in.</p>

<p>She sat at his feet, looking into the big open fire.</p>

<p>"Supposing I had never met you, what should I have done with the
rest of my life?" she asked, looking up at him.</p>

<p>His look was one almost of anguish.</p>

<p>"The rest of life?" he replied tenderly. "I cannot be with you
always, <i>cars,</i> for you are so young."</p>

<p>"It doesn't matter," cried Lucie passionately. "You know it
doesn't matter. You and I&mdash;I am sure we are together for
always. For eternity, I am sure. I don't know what I believe, but I
do know that&mdash;we are united for a span far far beyond this
life&mdash;in some other star&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What does it matter if it is true or not as long as you believe
it?" he answered under his breath.</p>

<p>"I do believe it. I feel you, when you are not there, about
me&mdash;I am sure of you, nothing that has happened would make any
difference. You remember, when we first met, I, who was so reserved
and shy&mdash;I came to you at once, was never offended, never
frightened. I tried to hold on to worldly conventions&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah, these conventions, Lucie!"</p>

<p>"They are far away from us to-night," she answered, her radiant
face golden in the fireglow. "Think of all the years I shall
remember this&mdash;a long life perhaps&mdash;but never have a
moment like this moment."</p>

<p>She touched his fine hand where it grasped the arm of the
chair.</p>

<p>"And you? What have I given you in exchange for what you have
given me? I've just smashed into your life...taking
everything...you've been hurt because of me, and angered. And what
have I, so wild and weak to give to you? A man like you?"</p>

<p>She felt his hand tremble under hers. As he answered the mellow
quality of his voice roughened with emotion.</p>

<p>"I've always found life magnificent, Lucie. I've enjoyed every
hour of my existence, work and play, but never, even in my most
ardent youth, did I dream of such splendour as you have revealed to
me&mdash;I held Love lightly for I had never seen his wings
unfurled yes, I do believe now in immortality&mdash;it must be
so."</p>

<p>"To think that we have found it&mdash;you and I," said Lucie,
hoarsely, "this union that we believe in it&mdash;you and
I&mdash;always&mdash;for all eternity. I understand it all. Why man
invented Heaven this life isn't enough&mdash;"</p>

<p>He rose abruptly, so that she was still kneeling at his feet.
"Promise me this, Lucie&mdash;you have got to promise me. You are
to do as I bid you. Always."</p>

<p>"Anything you ask of me."</p>

<p>"If anything happens to me you are not to come to me."</p>

<p>"Why should you say that?" shuddered Lucie.</p>

<p>"You are not to see me as less than I am now. You are not to
know me&mdash;ill&mdash;.-disabled&mdash;old&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I want to be with you always. Why do you speak so?"</p>

<p>"Lucie, 'Lucie, promise. No matter why I ask. This promise means
everything to me. Promise."</p>

<p>"I will do what you tell me. You know that."</p>

<p>"And you will be happy&mdash;Lucie&mdash;always happy? Whether I
am with you or not?"</p>

<p>Lucie rose to her feet.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you speak as if I was going away for ever&mdash;don't
say these things&mdash;Oh, don't!"</p>

<p>She put her slim arm round his massive shoulders holding him
tightly in her sudden fear, but he put her aside with desperate
quickness.</p>

<p>"What do you think I can endure? I've had four months of this,
Lucie. My God&mdash;the nights I've had&mdash;Lucie, you should
have gone away before!"</p>

<p>She almost shrank from the intensity of the emotion shown in his
swift words; from head to foot shivering she leant against the old
red chair.</p>

<p>"I bring you nothing but anguish," she murmured, her radiance
clouded.</p>

<p>"Why do you deny yourself to me? You are mine but I must not
touch you. You do not wholly trust me&mdash;you keep me on the rack
because of some fear&mdash;of me, of the world&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That is not true," said Lucie smiling sadly, "or should I be
here to-night?"</p>

<p>She looked at him and suddenly all her strength failed; she did
not know what to do or say; she shivered, cold with excitement, her
throat was constricted and her hands shook; she glanced round the
dark old room, now like a cavern of shadows, then back to the fire
from which the flames had faded leaving a still, red, glowing
heart.</p>

<p>"Why did you ask me to stay?" he questioned out of the warm
gloom that almost obscured him.</p>

<p>"I wanted you to respect me," said Lucie dully.</p>

<p>"Respect you! My poor child, what words you use! And
you&mdash;speaking of eternity&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I can't argue," she said, "I can't. I'll go now. In the morning
we'll talk again."</p>

<p>"You'll go&mdash;to sleep?"</p>

<p>"Oh! Sleep!"</p>

<p>She crossed to her ante-room door and opened it. The inner light
of the other fire fell over her figure. He was beside her very
quickly and took her fingers from the handle.</p>

<p>"Lucie&mdash;if I were to kiss you now&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You won't!" she whispered quickly, looking down, huddled
together, shut away upon herself, like a wild creature foiled at a
touch. "Goodnight, goodnight&mdash;"</p>

<p>He put his hand on her shoulder and lightly turned her round;
she could not, with all her gathered forces, have resisted the
lightest manifestation of his strength.</p>

<p>"Please leave me," she begged, "please. I want you to go
away."</p>

<p>He let go of her and she slipped into the narrow dark
ante-room.</p>

<p>"You have conquered," he said; she saw him turn in a downcast
way towards the dying fire.</p>

<p>Lucie stood by the cold white bed; her fire was also only a heap
of ashes now, giving the faintest radiance; the moon high in the
heavens showed in the arch of the window faintly illuminating the
dark green wall paintings, the melancholy glades, the drooping
trees, the ruined temples and solitary huntsmen.</p>

<p>Lucie had put out her candle because of the great shadows it
made; hastily she had opened her valise, taken out a night-dress
and a yellow silk shawl and a pair of yellow leathern slippers.</p>

<p>Quickly she bathed in the icy water, undressed, let down and
combed her hair, and then, with the shawl over her shoulders,
crouched down by the embers, her face in her hands.</p>

<p>"What have I done?" she thought. "It must be something wicked
for I feel so unhappy. Turning away from him was like killing
something."</p>

<p>She shivered.</p>

<p>Supposing he was estranged? Supposing they never met again? All
their future hung on the chances, the vicissitudes of every
day.</p>

<p>Nothing was certain, except Death.</p>

<p>That was certain&mdash;Death.</p>

<p>She might die before she could come back.</p>

<p>And he? He had spoken of ill health&mdash;of age&mdash;of
disablement.</p>

<p>Supposing this is all I've got just these little, little
hours?</p>

<p>She was on her knees now, her chilled hands clasped on her
breast.</p>

<p>Who was there to consider but this one man? Who has ever done
for me what he has done? How can I be sure enough of any other
moments to put these aside?</p>

<p>She went to the window and looked at the moon and the silver
heavens that bleached the palaces opposite and the strong waters of
the Arno hurrying to the great spaces of the sea.</p>

<p>Shivering she drew her shawl closer and left the sombre
bed-chamber; the ante-room was dark, in the empty <i>"salotto"</i>
a little glow lingered from the fallen logs, glittered in the
hundred facets of the candelebra and showed again sad woodland
scenes, old, gloomy painted on the walls.</p>

<p>Through the window now, the moon, as if it had followed her,
poured down the misty colourless light.</p>

<p>Lucie passed into the second ante-chamber; a faint lint of light
showed under his door; she knocked on it with her cold fingers.</p>

<p>She heard his step and did not move; he opened the door; he was
still fully dressed and held a candle.</p>

<p>Lucie looked up at him, her hands were clasped tight; it was
rather the attitude of a penitent child.</p>

<p>"I am sorry," she said, "I was wrong. Kiss me now." The yellow
silk shawl fell from her shoulders and at his feet; still he
neither spoke nor moved.</p>

<p>"Kiss me," repeated Lucie.</p>

<p>"I will not take you from your altar," he answered unsteadily,
<i>"Madonina!"</i></p>

<p>Lucie shook her head.</p>

<p>"I'm not. Only a woman. A woman, do understand. Oh, God, do you
think I have not suffered, too! Take me."</p>

<p>He drew her across the threshold, striking out and dropping the
candle.</p>

<p>"If you had not come&mdash;" the words were like a sob through
the swathes of hair he held to his lips.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch37" id="ch37">Chapter Thirty-Seven</a>
</h2>

<p class="cpb">&sect; I</p>

<p>THE next day they went to Livorno; Lucie was so filled with an
inner rapture that the fact of her impending departure made no
impression on her; neither her, heart nor her mind could receive
any image or thought of unhappiness. The day in the straggling
sea-port, in parts so sordid, in parts so opulent, to her consisted
of hours of unclouded delight; her radiant spirit leapt the
immediate parting to the near future when there would be no
parting. How fresh, how magnificent, how vivid the world looked
that clear winter's day&mdash;with what zest the crisp sea sparkled
under a sky of crystal brightness, touched with what magic were the
soaring palms and the tufted tamarisks in the gardens that
stretched along the ocean-side, how entrancing was the little
restaurant where they had their meal, how beyond measure fragrant
the close packed bunch of small hard roses and odourless violets
tied up with silver paper that she carried back to Pisa; and what
enchantment was over the short railway journey when she looked at
the sparse pine forests veiled in white vapours, the ground a-bloom
with bluish lichen full of cups that held the frost dews.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; II</p>

<p>But that evening when she looked at her ticket, her passport,
her valises waiting to be strapped, reaction gripped her in an
anguish of fear.</p>

<p>"I can't go," she said, "why should I? It is ridiculous."</p>

<p>She turned to him with an impulse that was almost like an outcry
of terror.</p>

<p>"How can I bear to let you go?"</p>

<p>"Lucie," he answered gently, "have you' really nothing else in
your life that matters to you?"</p>

<p>What was there? Even Mrs. Falconer, even Sophie, even the
necessity of earning money, were as nothing compared to the
necessity of her love.</p>

<p>"What prevents me from staying?" she added. "If I cannot come to
Florence, I could wait here&mdash;somewhere near&mdash;"</p>

<p>She was answered by the anguish in his face.</p>

<p>"You want me to go?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Lucie. You must go. If you would not burden me with a
remorse that will kill my soul&mdash;return to England."</p>

<p>Lucie sighed.</p>

<p>"Perhaps it is better, but it seems wrong."</p>

<p>"It is wrong," he replied, "but it must be&mdash;Lucie, I gave
you life and liberty, I saved you from engulfing horrors&mdash;use
what I gave you. You have so many years ahead all weaving fresh
patterns for you. You must live your life, healthy, happy,
loved&mdash;never must you be caged or cramped or
saddened&mdash;least of all by me."</p>

<p>"I don't understand. You speak as if we were going to
part&mdash;for ever."</p>

<p>He put his hands quickly on her shoulders.</p>

<p>"And if we were, Lucie? If we were? You would remember your
promise? You would not betray me by disobedience?"</p>

<p>"I have promised," whispered Lucie, with dry lips.
"But&mdash;why do you speak like this? Aren't we going to be happy?
Aren't we going to be together? What should get in the way?"</p>

<p>He laughed now and tried to soothe her, but she continued to
tremble; their ecstasy was built on such a frail foundation; the
rushing minutes were being swept so ruthlessly into the formless
dark, so transitory seemed this blaze of joy, a dizzy pinnacle for
one instant gained, in one instant lost as the weak foothold
crumbles and the inadequate adventurer sinks to dull levels.</p>

<p>But you can never forget the blaze of splendour that you saw,
the whole glory of the outspread earth, the complete blaze of the
entire heavens.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; III</p>

<p>Yet it seemed impossible that they should part; the pain and
passion of those last hours transcended joy and became agony.</p>

<p>The train left in the early morning, bitterest hour of the day,
and through all the sleepless night the white spectre of the dawn
beckoned them, grim and cold.</p>

<p>Only a few hours&mdash;only two hours, only one hour.</p>

<p>And now the pallid light shows above the house-tops, reveals the
running waters of the Arno, slips through the sad green curtains,
touches the melancholy sylvan scenes, the wide space of ashes of
the spent fire and the exhausted woman, half-unconscious on her
lover's shoulder while he draws her bright shawl tenderly over her
chilled body.</p>

<p>"Lucie&mdash;it is time."</p>

<p>"I know," she whispered. She had seen the pitiless light pick up
the cold white space of the bed, the embers of the desolate hearth,
the forlorn huntsmen in the melancholy landscapes on the walls.</p>

<p>"Did you sleep a little?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I think&mdash;a little&mdash;"</p>

<p>"In my arms, Lucie, you slept in my arms."</p>

<p>She raised herself and put her long hands behind his neck.</p>

<p>"This is for all time, you know," she said, with passionate
gravity. "To all eternity."</p>

<p>"For all time&mdash;mine, my own. Think of it,
Lucie&mdash;perhaps we are immortal in our spirits and have ages on
other stars&mdash;if we are not, in the elements to which we shall
return we shall mingle&mdash;always together&mdash;ah, kiss me once
more."</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; IV</p>

<p>In the cold <i>salotto</i> they drank their coffee, Lucie in her
heavy coat and veil, her valises strapped, her hands gloved, her
bag ready with her ticket, her passport, her money.</p>

<p>She was not wholly sad; the after-glow from such raptures as
hers cannot so easily fade away; but he was controlling with
painful difficulty an overwhelming agitation.</p>

<p>She tried to talk of her return.</p>

<p>"Shall I come in May?"</p>

<p>"Lucie&mdash;you must not come till you can be with me
always&mdash;do you think I could see you now as anything but my
wife? We cannot meet as friends, Lucie."</p>

<p>"In October, then?"</p>

<p>"It is too long&mdash;I must come to England."</p>

<p>He put his coffee cup down on the table, she heard it rattle
sharply and glanced up, his hand and arm were trembling with
unnatural violence.</p>

<p>He saw her glance and said quietly,</p>

<p>"That is why you must not come till I send for you."</p>

<p>"Is it&mdash;serious?"</p>

<p>He tried to reassure the instant terror in her voice and
face.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no&mdash;I have been too strong, too healthy, I am
spoilt for the least inconvenience. Do you think I cannot cure
myself as I have cured so many others?"</p>

<p>Lucie was reassured, not wholly satisfied.</p>

<p>"What is it?" she asked.</p>

<p>He laughed, evasively.</p>

<p>"Did? not say that I was the one who would be smashed up by our
meeting, Lucie?"</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; V</p>

<p>The last farewells were a blur; Lucie could never recall what
they had said or done; she passed the lonely journey hardly knowing
where she was, awake to life at Paris where his cable waited her
and wrote to him, pages covered in passionate haste.</p>

<p>At Calais another wire, at Dover another; these were all that
Lucie could ever remember of that journey.</p>

<p>And then there was the great, hideous, foul London station, and
Sophie on the platform, waiting for her, in untidy mourning.</p>

<p>Lucie, even then still flushed and radiant with her bright green
scarf and her handsome travelling clothes, felt an instant downward
rush of her spirits at the sight of this figure.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch38" id="ch38"></a>Chapter Thirty-Eight</h2>

<p class="cpb">&sect; I</p>

<p>LUCIE had returned full of warm thoughts for Sophie; she had
written to her in almost extravagant terms of affection which had
been quite sincere, she had resolved on several measures for
Sophie's happiness tinged with the brightness of her own joy.</p>

<p>But Sophie in the draggled black, looking pale and hard and
thin-lipped, appeared suddenly in the light of an insoluble
problem.</p>

<p>Her greeting was chilly, and as casual as if they had met
yesterday.</p>

<p>"I've been waiting here for twenty minutes, the train is
late."</p>

<p>Lucie fell instantly back into the old habit of constraint; they
kissed awkwardly.</p>

<p>"Where are you going?" asked Sophie.</p>

<p>"I thought of an hotel for a night or so."</p>

<p>"My mother couldn't have you&mdash;the flat is too small and she
has to leave on Wednesday. I'm sleeping at the studio."</p>

<p>Lucie tried to brace herself against the rush of disappointment
and depression the very word "studio" brought up.</p>

<p>In the taxi she furtively studied Sophie, and with a shrinking
feeling of repulsion, for the girl gave out an atmosphere of bored
gloom that was like a miasma.</p>

<p>She was still dressed with an affectation of childishness; her
dusty hair was fluffed and pulled out under her dingy bag cap, her
skin was neglected, her eyes very clumsily darkened so that there
appeared to be soot in her lashes and brows, every detail of her
dress was wrong from the safety pin at the throat of her coat to
the pinched velvet house shoes; Lucie could not find anything to
say to her.</p>

<p>"Your letters have been very scrappy," said Sophie, with dry
sententiousness. "We really don't know how things stand&mdash;I
suppose you'll explain."</p>

<p>"There is nothing to explain," answered Lucie, desperately, "I'm
going back to Italy in the autumn. I told you."</p>

<p>"It seems very strange. I should have thought you would have
waited a little."</p>

<p>"I am waiting. Nothing is announced."</p>

<p>"I suppose <i>not,"</i> said Sophie acidly. "My mother doesn't
care for you marrying a foreigner again. She has been very, very
shocked by Pio's death."</p>

<p>"But she knew for so long," said Lucie, and added in her
thought, "and disliked him so much."</p>

<p>"It was a great shock," insisted Sophie. "She was so fond of
him."</p>

<p>Lucie could not answer this; it was grotesque.</p>

<p>"I told you I was not wearing mourning, Sophie," she said,
gently.</p>

<p>"I prefer to wear it. I also was very fond of Pio," said Sophie,
primly.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; II</p>

<p>At the hotel she announced that she would stay there, too; Mrs.
Falconer had asked her to keep Lucie company; with secret dismay
her cousin consented; this homecoming was a heavy business, but the
thought of Carlo Ghisleri was sufficient to keep her radiant.</p>

<p>At lunch Sophie began to talk; Lucie wanted to go out and send
off a cable but she listened patiently while Sophie talked on over
the empty coffee cups.</p>

<p>The same talk; about herself entirely, as if there really was
nothing in the world but Sophie Falconer.</p>

<p>Lucie and her experiences were pushed aside as if they were of
no account whatever; Sophie was exactly where she had been a year
ago, except that she was a shade more dusty and dingy, a shade more
melancholy and vain.</p>

<p>The history of this twelve months was like the history of every
twelve months before from the time that Sophie, at fourteen, put
her hair up and went to an Art Students' Dance looking really
lovely and behaving with sulky rudeness.</p>

<p>She and her mother had lived in Lucie's flat till the lease was
up; then they had gone to stay with one of Mrs. Falconer's old
friends; this had ended in a devastating quarrel&mdash;Sophie the
cause with her slovenly, lazy ways and her sharp tongue.</p>

<p>Then they had "borrowed" the tiny flat of a journalist friend;
then they had gone to sea-side lodgings, then back to another even
more minute flat where Mrs. Falconer lived alone while Sophie slept
at the studio.</p>

<p>Sophie had practically given up singing; she was having dancing
lessons again; with immense effort Mrs. Falconer had "papered" the
Steinway one afternoon when Sophie had danced and sung; Sophie
reported immense praise but a total lack of engagements; then she
had had through the influence of a friend of Lucie's, a position as
secretary in a concert hall and left at the end of a month after a
furious and mysterious quarrel with her employers; that was
Sophie's year.</p>

<p>Mrs. Falconer, of course, had done nothing, she had been totally
absorbed in Sophie and Sophie's "career."</p>

<p>They had lived on what Lucie had sent them, on borrowed money,
on debts; moving continually from place to place, half of what they
had was never paid for; they were in severe financial straits now;
Sophie "hoped Lucie would come to the rescue&mdash;my mother is so
worried."</p>

<p>It was a miserable chronicle; Lucie only held her heart up in
this tide of wretchedness by the thought of her lover. But the
worst had not come.</p>

<p>"I want you to help me," said Sophie. "Apart from the money.
With Simon Kaye. You seem to have done so well for yourself I
thought you could help me."</p>

<p>"Done so well?" echoed Lucie faintly.</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose you aren't marrying a man old enough to be your
father, if he isn't very well off," said Sophie sharply. "We made
enquiries about him in Florence and he is very well off."</p>

<p>"Oh, Sophie! I hope he never hears of that!" cried Lucie in
dismay. "I never thought about the money. He has sufficient, I
know."</p>

<p>Flushed and humiliated, she rested her face in her hand; she
simply could not speak of Carlo Ghisleri to Sophie, nor even, she
feared, to Mrs. Falconer; they must think what they liked about the
affair.</p>

<p>"Is it still Simon Kaye, Sophie?" she added.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Sophie, with a self-conscious smile. "I've seen
a great deal of him lately. He thinks he isn't good enough for
me."</p>

<p>"Well, that isn't much of a difficulty," said Lucie.</p>

<p>"Oh, there is some obstacle, I don't know quite what. He is so
busy&mdash;preoccupied. My mother says men don't have leisure to
fall in love nowadays. You can't get hold of them."</p>

<p>Lucie thought of Carlo Ghisleri and what he had put aside for
her sake.</p>

<p>"What do you want me to do?" she asked with a sinking heart; she
feared that this fantastic business was as stationary as it had
been a year ago.</p>

<p>"You might ask him out to lunch or dinner and a theatre. I
suppose you'll take a flat in town now and do a little
entertaining."</p>

<p>"No," said Lucie, resolute at last, "I simply can't afford
it."</p>

<p>She looked up from the cloth as she spoke and saw Sophie
smirking and fluttering her eyes at the big plate glass mirror
opposite in which was reflected a young man lunching alone.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; III</p>

<p>Some of the evil taste of all this was effaced by the meeting
with Mrs. Falconer; she had prepared a really homely little tea in
the tiny flat and she greeted Lucie with warm and unrestrained
affection; she wept over Pio, but she was inclined to be
enthusiastic over the second marriage.</p>

<p>"We can all go to Italy in the autumn, a season in Florence
would do Sophie a world of good," she said.</p>

<p>But underneath all the pleasantness and charm and energy of Mrs.
Falconer, Lucie perceived the same chaos, the same confusion, the
same hysterical emotions, the same drifting, procrastination and
muddle, the same mental instability; it was still all "plans" and
"schemes" and "talk"; there was nothing definite, no principle, no
industry, no concentration&mdash;all was like scattered spume.</p>

<p>And Sophie sat crouching over the gas-fire biting her nails
while her mother talked.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; IV</p>

<p>Plans, schemes, illusions evolved out of chaos and to chaos
destined to return, and talk, talk, talk, while the lazy smoke
ascended from Mrs. Falconer's endless cigarettes and the air grew
acid from the flaring gas fire, and the fragments of cake and bread
and butter grew dry on the soiled plates.</p>

<p>Sophie pulled out a piece of work, machine made lace and cheap
cambric, some impossible undergarment, neither warm, nor pretty,
which she had been so long making that it was crumpled and dirty;
she put half-a-dozen stitches in it and dropped it to return to her
nail biting.</p>

<p>Lucie could not see her as the wife of the prosperous, pushing,
vulgarly successful Simon Kaye&mdash;nor indeed as any man's
wife.</p>

<p>When they returned to the hotel, it was too late for Lucie to
write to Italy and her head ached and her spirit was sickened. It
did not seem possible that this was the same world as the one she
had left, that this bright, conventional, comfortable hotel, all
cretonne and plush, electric lights, bells, and pages, could be
existing at the same period as that old, quiet hostel in Pisa.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; V</p>

<p>Sophie, lounging on the bed while her cousin unpacked, said:</p>

<p>"I wish you would take those trophies off, Lucie...all those
rings."</p>

<p>"Why?" Lucie looked shyly at the sacred wedding-ring and a
little gold signet ring Carlo Ghisleri had also given her. "It is
not very ostentatious, is it?"</p>

<p>Sophie did not answer; she wore a tattered blue crépe de chine
dressing-gown that had once belonged to Lucie; she had pulled about
her shoulders the dingy manes of her hair, powdered her face and
darkened her eyes; as she lolled on the rose-coloured quilt, she
kept glancing at her reflection in the wardrobe glass and
rearranging her pose self-consciously.</p>

<p>She showed no interest whatever in what Lucie had been through,
no sympathy or understanding whatever.</p>

<p>"I should have thought you would have wanted to be free," she
remarked.</p>

<p>"Freedom is no good to women&mdash;it's just a snare," said
Lucie quickly, "You can't be free like a man is&mdash;the kind of
freedom you can get is no good."</p>

<p>"Oh, isn't it? You're just hopelessly old-fashioned."</p>

<p>"Well," said Lucie, wearily, "you mean to get married
yourself&mdash;to Simon Kaye&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Eventually, I suppose so&mdash;But we shan't live the ordinary
kind of life."</p>

<p>"How, then?"</p>

<p>"Like this, I suppose&mdash;a suite in a hotel, and we shall
each go away when we want to without asking each other
questions&mdash;I don't mean to mend socks, or interview the cook,
or get up early to see him off in the morning&mdash;"</p>

<p>She rose, slipped to the door and opened it.</p>

<p>"Don't," said Lucie, "there is someone outside."</p>

<p>"I know."</p>

<p>Lucie knew, too; she looked over her shoulder; a young man was
passing down the corridor; Sophie, fluttering her lids, hung in the
open door, the young man shot into his room.</p>

<p>"Sophie, how can you bother when you are so fond of someone
else?" exclaimed Lucie miserably.</p>

<p>"Don't be silly," said Sophie, tartly.</p>

<p>The tears fell on Lucie's hands as she knelt by her trunk; it
was all so horrible; Sophie seemed like a caricature of womanhood,
her actions a caricature of love.</p>

<p>There was something almost fell about her, too, in her hardness,
in her cold conceit, in her lifeless vanity; in the glance she
turned on Lucie was a glint of malevolence wholly
disconcerting.</p>

<p>"I've been a weak fool again," thought Lucie. "Why did I come
back to this? They don't want me. Only the money. I might have
hidden myself anywhere but here."</p>

<p>But she was in the toils again; the chains of duty, of
obligation, of sentiment, were already heavy about her; she never
seriously meditated evasion of them.</p>

<p>Sophie loitered about the door; when the young man opposite put
out his boots, Sophie was putting out her shoes with her gown
slipped off her shoulder.</p>

<p>Lucie clenched her hands; if it had been coquetry, deli-ate,
charming, she could have condoned it, but this passionless,
deliberate wantonness, with neither gaiety nor grace was an
offence.</p>

<p>"Sophie is undeveloped, she can't understand what&mdash;a parody
her behaviour is. She can't help being ill-bred, either. She was
never taught."</p>

<p>So Lucie strove to make excuses, as all her life she had been
making them, for what she knew was inexcusable.</p>

<p>"Is Toby Entwhistle still in town?" she asked, with an effort at
pleasantness.</p>

<p>Sophie gave one of her self-conscious smiles.</p>

<p>"Oh, Toby! He hangs about the studio a lot. A sort of tame cat.
I'm getting fed-up with him. He's mean."</p>

<p>She looked again at herself in the mirror.</p>

<p>"I'm in rags," she added sourly, "you'll have to take me out
to-morrow and buy me some clothes. Good night." She drifted out,
slamming the door.</p>

<p>Lucie clutched at Carlo Ghisleri's photograph that lay hidden
under a pile of clothes and kissed it desperately while the tears
of loneliness and homesickness dripped down her tired face.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="c39" id="c39">Chapter Thirty-nine</a>

<p class="cpb">&sect; I</p>

<p>LUCIE found that Mrs. Falconer and Sophie, for all their chaotic
vagueness had already planned out what she was to do with the
months she had to spend in England.</p>

<p>Mrs. Falconer had nowhere to go to and she wished to leave
London, so that Sophie might have a free hand in the conduct of her
mysterious love affair; "a girl," Mrs. Falconer had decided, "can't
do much with a mother always in the background."</p>

<p>So she suggested that Lucie and she should go away somewhere and
leave Sophie in the studio. Torquay was the place chosen; Mrs.
Falconer took a fancy to the idea and insisted on it with much
enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Lucie could not feel that the arrangement was pleasing; she was
so wrapped in her inner emotion that she wanted nothing but peace;
even Mrs. Falconer's emotional affection jarred; she did not care
for Torquay where she had been with Pio when his lung trouble was
first suspected; she associated the place with the cadaverous
figure of her husband, weighing himself in the chemist's shop and
battling out in wind and rain to buy him exotic and costly
fruits.</p>

<p>Still she would be free of Sophie's icy gloom and intolerant
egotism and free of the blast and glare, clatter and screech of the
overcrowded city.</p>

<p>And after all, what did it matter where she went?</p>

<p>The entire financial burden of this scheme fell on Lucie. She
had to pay for herself and Mrs. Falconer, even to her aunt's
endless cigarettes and she had to send a weekly sum to Sophie to
enable her to "carry on"; her cousin also had to be supplied with
half the few clothes she had brought from Italy.</p>

<p>All this meant hard work for Lucie; she had a book of stories
and illustrations coming out in May and she had had the luck to
sell a set of fabric designs; these, however, would not be paid for
yet and meanwhile she had to depend on odd articles and drawings
and back royalties.</p>

<p>This meant hard work and plain living; Lucie was used to both
but she could not but feel the weight of her shackles the more so
when her acquaintances remarked how much money she must be making
and how well known she was getting to be; she was earning a good
income but the strain on it was too heavy.</p>

<p>A few days after her landing, found her in cheap lodgings in
Torquay with Mrs. Falconer; her whole inner life was centred round
Carlo Ghisleri; she did, literally, live for his daily letters; she
did, literally, count the days, ticking them off on a paper
calendar, till she should be able to go back to him again; for the
rest, the servitude of the Villa Calvini was hardly less exacting
than the servitude of Sackville Road, Torquay. It was equally work,
repression, negation, monotony with the company of an unbalanced
person in the house and bitter glacial weather without.</p>

<p>A long severe and dark winter that seemed to hold no hope even
of the late melancholy English spring&mdash;that seemed to make
Italy&mdash;Pisa&mdash;Love&mdash;as far off as an ancient fairy
tale.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; II</p>

<p>If Lucie lived for Carlo Ghisleri's letters, Mrs. Falconer lived
for Sophie's; they came, not only every day, but sometimes by every
post; the two women talked of nothing else but Sophie and Sophie's
affairs; Lucie was mistaken in thinking that she could escape her
cousin by leaving London, Mrs. Falconer's infatuated obsession was
nearly as irritating as the presence of the object of it, and
infinitely more heart rending.</p>

<p>Lucie spoke very little about the man who occupied her entire
heart and soul; her engagement had been formally announced, most
people seemed to think it some purely business arrangement by which
she had "done rather well for herself;" some were slightly shocked;
some gave her good advice as to the recklessness of marrying a
foreigner&mdash;again. Lucie never explained, or justified herself,
or talked about it at all; it mattered so little what anyone said,
or thought, or did.</p>

<p>Mrs. Falconer, who always took a position of authority, one day
demanded to see one of the Italian letters and when Lucie gave it
to her, she spelt out some of the beautiful phrases.</p>

<p>"Why, the man's in love with you?" she said with surprise and
suspicion.</p>

<p>"What did you think?" returned Lucie.</p>

<p>"Oh! You are always so calm and cool, I never thought&mdash;of
course one must make allowances for the flowery language&mdash;and
these foreigners are so emotional."</p>

<p>Lucie said nothing.</p>

<p>At night she had the little travelling cape he had given her
over her bed, his letters under her pillow, his ring on her finger
and in her dreams it did really seem to her that she conversed with
him, beheld him, clasped him again.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; III</p>

<p>His letters, wise, passionate, eloquent, have had one mournful
note running through them; his health gave him anxiety; nothing
much, of course; he would be well in October when she came out, for
her sake he would fight this vague fear.</p>

<p>He mentioned it very seldom&mdash;always lightly. But Lucie
thought of "the cloud no bigger than a man's hand."</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; IV</p>

<p>So the dull days passed without incident, without definite
action, Lucie always subordinate, bound to the service of another,
thinking of Carlo Ghisleri, talking of Sophie Falconer; day after
day the faded lodgings, day after day the walks in the cold windy
streets, day after day waiting for the postman, letters and talk,
letters and talk.</p>

<p>The woman, stiffened by duty, strengthened by hope, yet felt her
soul cry out within her; her glimpse of what life might be made;
this the very epitome of abnegation.</p>

<p>In May the book came out; they had a little money; Mrs.
Falconer, who had begun to fret after Sophie, proposed an instant
return to London.</p>

<p>On top of this came one of Sophie's maundering, illiterate
letters announcing in fulsome yet stilted phrases that at length
she was "engaged" to Simon Kaye.</p>

<p>She added that she had taken a furnished house in Hampstead for
Mrs. Falconer, herself and Lucie.</p>

<p>Mrs. Falconer went by the next train to London; Lucie was to
pack and follow; Sophie would meet each of them in turn with Toby
Entwhistle.</p>

<p>Lucie was tired of this name. Sophie wrote so continually of
this young man who seemed to be dangling and dragging behind her in
a manner after her own heart, hopelessly in love with her, yet a
confidant of the Simon Kaye affair; Lucie pictured him as quite
invertebrate, her old-time interest in him had utterly
vanished.</p>

<p>But now there was no time for anything but boundless gratitude
that Sophie had at last settled her marriage and that Mrs. Falconer
was finally so happy.</p>

<p>Still she wired to Florence.</p>

<p>"May I come in August? Homesick. Lucie."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch40" id="ch40">Chapter Forty</a>
</h2>

<p class="cpb">&sect; I</p>

<p>LUCIE told herself that she ought to be very happy; indeed the
news about Sophie was of the "too good to be true" variety; Sophie
married as Mrs. Falconer so desperately wanted her to be married,
would mean that she could return to Italy with her conscience clear
as regards her duty to her aunt and cousin.</p>

<p>Yes, it was almost too wonderful! She could not help feeling
sceptic as to Sophie's powers of accomplishing anything so
satisfactory; she recalled with loathing Sophie's other engagement
during those early feverish months of the War, a miserable, hectic,
dismal affair which the young man had put an end to and which had
ended in the humiliation of rude letters between Mrs. Falconer and
the should-have-been mother-in-law&mdash;just a "row."</p>

<p>Lucie tried to put these depressing thoughts out of her head,
but she felt chilled and full of a sharp distaste for the immediate
months as she descended from the Torquay train.</p>

<p>Toby Entwhistle was there to meet her; she knew him at once and
stiffened slightly; she did not relish the escort of Sophie's "tame
cat."</p>

<p>"It is a great many years since we met," she said.</p>

<p>"Seven," he answered and turned to the porter.</p>

<p>He was a stout young man in a belted waterproof, quite
distinctly good-looking and healthy, with rather more than the
usual Anglo-Saxon reserve; he seemed both shy and modest, but at
the same time solid and strong; as he directed the putting of the
luggage on to the cab, Lucie noted his thick neck, his broad
shoulders, and his capable hands; she wondered that he should be
hanging round Sophie or even in her set at all.</p>

<p>As she entered the taxi, she hesitated not knowing if he was
going to accompany her or not; but his face that had already a warm
golden look, flushed deeply.</p>

<p>"I have to go now. I shall come over to-morrow," he said.</p>

<p>"It was good of you to come at all&mdash;and to know me so
quickly," smiled Lucie.</p>

<p>"You haven't altered," he answered gravely, "goodbye."</p>

<p>Lucie drove away through the crowded station yard; her heart
sank with a further throb of depression. How she detested this
travelling, this moving about, this changing from one furnished
house to another, these expedients of apartments and hotels, this
awful sense of chaos, of confusion, of homelessness.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; II</p>

<p>The house of that hybrid type called dubiously "Queen Anne" by
people ignorant of architecture, did not serve to raise her
spirits; she marked at once the dead fern in a tarnished Berares
pot at the window of what was she knew the drawing-room, the faded
blue studio curtains that retained the original colour only in the
folds and through the opening of an upper sash window, the
discoloured metal of a geyser.</p>

<p>It was Sophie who opened the door, Sophie dishevelled in the
most sordid kind of way and looking white and bitter.</p>

<p>She said nothing and Lucie followed her into the gimcrack
passage with the worst forebodings of her journey realized. Of
course everything had gone wrong again.</p>

<p>"I suppose you want to see your room," said Sophie, when, the
luggage all in and the door shut, she began to slop up the
jerry-built stairs. "It has been an awful business getting
everything ready," she added sourly.</p>

<p>"I was quite willing to have helped," said Lucie. "Aunt
Elizabeth wanted me to stay in Torquay&mdash;haven't you got a
woman?"</p>

<p>As she spoke, she noted the gaping holes in her cousin's
stockings, the burst satin slippers, the threadbare velveteen skirt
falling at the waist, the line of dirt where the dingy hair was
pinned up from the neck.</p>

<p>"No," said Sophie; she flung open the first door they came to,
"this is your room, the best&mdash;it's cheap for what you are
paying for it&mdash;"</p>

<p>Lucie had divided the money she had lately received into equal
shares giving Mrs. Falconer half, and agreeing to pay half the
expenses of this house and housekeeping; this so-called business
arrangement seemed to please her aunt, so she had given in to it;
the form of the thing was a matter of indifference since she knew
that the substance always was that she must pay for everything. So
Sophie's remark stung bitterly; she could not answer. Sophie
slouched away.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; III</p>

<p>The house was of a type only too familiar, dirty, ill-furnished,
everything torn, or cracked, or chipped, or broken, destitute of
all objects of comfort or use and crowded with "ornaments" that
made the name a grinning irony.</p>

<p>When Lucie came down, Mrs. Falconer was getting the tea. She
looked haggard and distracted and her friendliness for Lucie
appeared to have diminished a great deal; the influence of Sophie
was obvious.</p>

<p>With a few commonplaces, grimly received, Lucie helped arrange
the cups; her cousin came in and announced that there was nothing
in the house but a loaf.</p>

<p>Mrs. Falconer groaned.</p>

<p>"Haven't any of the things come?" she asked, wearily. "No,"
replied Sophie, "I must go to the shops, I suppose&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear," cried the harassed mother, "two miles, walk for
you!"</p>

<p>"I seem to be here to play the Cinderella," answered Sophie,
grimly.</p>

<p>"This is dreadful," said Lucie quickly, "has everything gone
wrong, Sophie?"</p>

<p>"I should think you could see it had," retorted Sophie and went
out, slamming the door so that the rickety building shook.</p>

<p>"You must not take any notice&mdash;she has had a dreadful
time," said Mrs. 'Falconer.</p>

<p>"What has happened?" asked Lucie desperately.</p>

<p>"He has gone off&mdash;won't answer. It is the most terrible
tragedy, Lucie."</p>

<p>"But this can't go on&mdash;she must be told to give him
up&mdash;you can't stand the strain."</p>

<p>Mrs. Falconer turned on her with dramatic suddenness.</p>

<p>"You are the last one who should say anything," she cried in
overwrought accents, "you can't even understand Sophie's
feelings&mdash;it's all very well for you, you've had your chance
and secured it."</p>

<p>Despite the ugly vulgarity of the words, she was a figure of
such deep pathos that Lucie did not even feel angry.</p>

<p>Mrs. Falconer went out after Sophie; Lucie heard an upper door
open and shut; tired from her journey, sick with disappointment,
she had to go into the dreary little kitchen, make herself some tea
and cut herself slices of bread; she was too dispirited to go out
and get anything else.</p>

<p>This opening scene was entirely typical of what life was to be
in the Hampstead house.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; IV</p>

<p>Carlo Ghisleri wired:</p>

<p>"Wait till October. Not so well. Writing."</p>

<p>Lucie felt as if he had forsaken her, abandoned her to that
bleak, chaotic dreariness from which she had originally come, and
to which, no doubt, she belonged.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch41" id="ch41">Forty-One</a>
</h2>

<p class="cpb">&sect; I</p>

<p>ALL these happenings, however, were not the most important in
Lucie's life; she had far too much Celtic blood for the material to
be the most important to her and her tremendous recent experience
when her soul had reached the furthest horizon of its ambition in
the love of Carlo Ghisleri had drawn her still more definitely out
of the world of concrete fact into the region of spiritual
adventure.</p>

<p>Her spirit rested, as it were, in the triumph of complete
achievement. It had nothing more to strive for, it was replete with
victory, quiet with a marvellous content.</p>

<p>That there were difficulties, troubles ahead, that her return to
Italy appeared to grow more and more uncertain, were but surface
ripples of agitation on the surface of her inner serenity.</p>

<p>She had hardly ever believed that she would become Carlo
Ghisleri's wife, nay, had she leant a willing ear to her inner
voices, she would have known that the parting at Pisa station was
for no short or definite period.</p>

<p>It was with no sense of shock that she read his news, his
failure to re-establish his health, the fierce and venomous
opposition to the marriage. Somehow she had known that the powers
of darkness must combine against anything so heaven-sent as their
love; she felt that furious opposition had hitherto kept them apart
but had not been able to prevent their meeting, but was now
sundering them again; but this did not seem to matter to Lucie; the
experiences of those few months were sufficient for her whole
existence.</p>

<p>It was not that she trusted to his constancy, or was so sure
that he would keep faith with her, or so resolved to return to him.
It was the perfect and unmistakeable conviction that nothing
material could possibly interfere with their spiritual communion,
which was something far stronger than she could understand and
extended to spheres that she had no knowledge of; therefore the
first fierce longing to return to him had been soon assuaged, her
rebellion, against the separation had been brief, she withdrew
herself into an inner exaltation, a profound resignation that she
had no means of expressing.</p>

<p>It was the least part of her that moved through the distasteful
life of the Hampstead house, she lived most in her dreams, her
reveries and in those moments when she would watch the peaceful
moon rise above the Heath, or hear the wind, like battling eagles,
dash against the frail walls. Then the sense of the relativity of
time and space would be borne joyously upon her, she would actually
be on the shores of the Tyrrhenian Sea, in the rose garden, in the
green-painted room at Pisa.</p>

<p>And all vague longings, yearnings, aspirations, all old
restlessness, fevers of the spirit and discontents, with which she
had been familiar since a child, had been effaced by the meeting
with this man; it was as if he had solved every mystery for her,
satisfied every need, fulfilled every ideal; his presence had made
on her a unique impression of virility, of power, of splendour and
immortality; it seemed as if he had clasped, not only her body, but
her soul, to his breast, and comforted it to all eternity.</p>

<p>Her distress at his illness was mitigated by his assurances as
to his similar state of feeling, he declared that he could ignore
even this misfortune in the certainty of the eternities before
them.</p>

<p>Lucie could not think of him as ill, to her he was always
invulnerable, a God, and she never questioned his decision that she
must not see him while he was afflicted by any malady.</p>

<p>As for the campaign of invective against which he had had to
contend and which doubtless had aggravated his ill-health, directly
the result of overtaxed nerves, she was neither troubled nor
amazed.</p>

<p>She could see the affair from the point of view of an outsider;
she must have appeared an obvious foreign adventuress, smashing
into his life, ruining his future, absorbing his interest; he was
reputed to be well off, and she did not doubt that his relatives
had been insistent on the money point of view; they would be,
naturally, incapable of appreciating her complete indifference to
money and her capability of earning all she required; their
attitude was another good reason for postponing her return to
Italy; though several had written to her in friendly fashion, yet
she knew the majority of them to be hostile, and it was unthinkable
to make him the centre of unkindness, antagonism and
controversy.</p>

<p>Her romance was entirely secret save in one instance, and that
was in the case of Toby Entwhistle.</p>

<p>She saw a good deal of this young man and had at once slipped
into habits of quiet familiarity with him; he was reserved,
distant, yet entirely friendly, and, as she found him in such a
confidential position with regard to the two other women, she had
been led to speak, rather desperately, of Sophie.</p>

<p>This was easy, as Mrs. Falconer had suggested, even insisted,
that Toby should go about with her, and Lucie, though she
mistrusted her aunt's caprice, did go with the young man on one or
two very small expeditions; he was in some sort of indefinite
temporary government position and had plenty of leisure.</p>

<p>Lucie discovered immediately that he was not remotely enamoured
of Sophie; he was simply very sorry for her, touched by the
miserable love affair she had confided to him, impressed by Mrs.
Falconer's brilliancy, flattered by that lady's appeal to him to be
"good" to poor Sophie, and perhaps lonely and glad to be of use or
importance to any one; for, though attractive to women, he was not
easily stirred by them, and was too fastidious in his choice of
male acquaintances to have many friends.</p>

<p>Like so many Englishmen with the fighter's physique and the
sceptic's manner, he had a strong strain of the ascetic and the
mystic emphasized by a childhood as unhappy as Lucie's and an
isolation more complete than hers.</p>

<p>Gravely he went over the problem of Sophie, with the concern and
impartiality of an elder brother; Lucie smiled to herself; he knew
so little of Sophie after all and she could not further enlighten
him without definite disloyalty; to tell the truth about Sophie
would always sound like malice.</p>

<p>He had been quite touchingly kind; hearing of his wholehearted
service, and knowing how they had used him and how slightingly and
sneeringly they spoke of him, Lucie felt a strong impulse to make
amends to him by some sincerity of behaviour.</p>

<p>She told him about Carlo Ghisleri and the story of the Villa
Calvini.</p>

<p>He understood at once, he appeared to put Carlo Ghisleri where
she put him herself, to become in a curious dumb way his disciple;
Lucie thought that, with the same gifts, the same chances, he might
have been the same sort of man.</p>

<p>Although Mrs. Falconer referred to him succinctly as
"old-maidish," Sophie called him "soft," to Lucie, he had something
of Carlo Ghisleri's quality of virility, that quality she found so
woefully lacking in the men she usually met in London; indeed she
had very strongly the woman's instinctive dislike to the "artistic"
man, she always associated talents with weakness; she could hardly
bring herself to admit painters, poets, musicians, or actors as
belonging to real manhood; these people, nearly always vain,
jealous, diseased, effeminate, sickly, feeble, were the objects of
her secret contempt; she had all the primitive woman's passionate
admiration of physique and brain as against talents and gifts; all
her nature drew her towards action, strength, simplicity.</p>

<p>She would have said with Philip:</p>

<p>"My son, are you not ashamed to play the flute so well?"</p>

<p>She admired talents when a man used them as mere adornments as
did Carlo Ghisleri; but, save in a few rare instances, the
professional artist was an abomination to Lucie; therefore she
regarded Toby Entwhistle favourably in comparison with the other
men of Mrs. Falconer's set.</p>

<p>But she was not long to preserve this friendship which she had
faithfully detailed to Carlo Ghisleri and which was the one thing
in her present surroundings touched with beauty.</p>

<p>Sophie became instantly jealous; she invented and carried tales;
she put on her cousin's interest in this young man the construction
a charwoman would have put; she filled the air with the miasma of
suspicion, spite and malice.</p>

<p>Lucie felt this long before anything was said.</p>

<p>"I can't go on living like this," she thought, "I must find some
way out."</p>

<p>It was not easy; their financial affairs were so entangled that
it would take a good deal of common sense and tolerance to put them
straight and neither of these assets could be expected from Mrs.
Falconer or Sophie. Lucie could run the one establishment but would
have found two a difficulty. She had besides great reluctance to
force an issue; a huge pity and love for Mrs. Falconer, a great
hope that all might yet come right.</p>

<p>Meanwhile she had to work hard and always rather desperately.
They were living in the most extravagant way as regards house and
service; the shabby furnished place and the inefficient daily
woman, Sophie's careless housekeeping (she insisted in keeping
these reins of power in her hands), cost more than would have run
an ordinary.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; II</p>

<p>August came and life was still running in this groove; it was a
year since she had first met Carlo Ghisleri.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; III</p>

<p>However much her inward content, the outer details of her days
became intolerable; "the dweller in the innermost" became affronted
in the secret shrine.</p>

<p>Lucie took what distractions offered, she went about partly to
pass the time, partly to please Mrs. Falconer, who urged on her a
wide social life, for Sophie's sake; so Lucie took her cousin to
parties and at homes and to several of the charity fétes that had
become so fashionable.</p>

<p>Lucie, in this manner, met all her old acquaintances again;
nothing had happened to any of them; they were still only just
successful enough to keep their heads above water. Aurora Bearish
had "taken" to spectacles and had received a raise in her salary.
Mrs. Bearish had quarrelled with Mrs. Falconer. Lydia Copeland had
gone on tour, her second divorce was pending, Julia Jarret was
still studying for the bar, and Hester Joy was under expensive
treatment for hysteria.</p>

<p>Ellen Bowness was still brightly following the round of the
London season and Pamela Raith had taken to very cheap journalism,
she had now quite definitely lost her looks. Louisa Kingdom was
still writing "brilliant" articles against men and matrimony and
Harriett Dornett and Ellen Barden were still hot feminists,
viciously on the trail of masculine iniquities.</p>

<p>Sophie's one-time great friend, Elinor Kennaway, was running a
coquettish sort of tea-shop in one of the suburbs.</p>

<p>Clara Biddulph was "running round" just the same.</p>

<p>Poor Mr. Dodd came up on Sundays to the house at Hampstead and
brought boxes of cigarettes and boxes of chocolates and gave rather
furtive sort of dinners in Soho, which he appeared to think was
quite a daring sort of place.</p>

<p>Yes, it was all the same, stale, unprofitable somehow, to Lucie
at least, utterly wrong.</p>

<p>The women more than ever depressed and repelled her; she felt
absolutely alien in their midst; the feverish chase for luck and
chances, the intrigues to catch the attention of the men, the
scramble to get into marriage, the struggle to get out of it, the
desperate dressing-up of dubious and fading charms, affected her
with mental nausea.</p>

<p>The steady withering of these women who had never bloomed made
her shudder; they turned from children into hags, slowly but
definitely, they had no prime, no summer, they knew no content, no
fulfilment, they passed from the arid expectation of greedy youth
into the bleak disappointment of old age, masking both stages with
dye and paint, impudence and the battle-cries of feminism, that
modern monster that is both Harpy and Chimera. The restless faces
of these women pursued Lucie everywhere, not only among her own
acquaintances, but in all the places to which she went in the
overcrowded buses and tubes, in the foolishly magnificent shops,
amid the sickly splendours of the restaurants and tea shops, where
sweets, gilding, fox-trots and sneering waitresses with coiffures,
surrounded swarms of idlers chewing artificial pastries.</p>

<p>Statistics said there were two million superfluous women; it
seemed to Lucie as if this entire number daily crowded the London
streets. Nor did Lucie find any pleasure or relief in the set to
which she belonged; the receptions, public dinners, and private
gatherings of these intellectuals, thronged by the successful
people, the trying-to-be-successful people, and their more or less
feeble-minded followers who thought publicity was synonymous with
greatness, simply deafened and stunned Lucie's spirit; the
clap-trap platitudes of the professional artist, the idiotic
enthusiasm of the jackals, the delighted smirks of the lions, the
threadbare airs and graces of the professional beauty, the studied
languors and niceness of the great ladies whose husbands had bought
their titles, their mansions, their pedigrees, five minutes ago,
the blast and clatter of the whole society which was indeed a
Vanity Fair where everyone screamed their wares, banged their
drums, or gesticulated in front of their painted booths, all filled
Lucie with one idea&mdash;that of escape.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; IV</p>

<p>"You should take Sophie out more," said Mrs. Falconer in hostile
tones. "She mopes so much in the house."</p>

<p>Lucie felt a crisis approaching; this time one she would hardly
be able to avoid.</p>

<p>"Sophie has refused the last few times I have asked her."</p>

<p>"Because she thinks you don't want her."</p>

<p>"That is being morbid&mdash;really&mdash;she ought to get some
work," said Lucie, desperately, "and put Simon Kaye out of her
head."</p>

<p>Mrs. Falconer ignored this.</p>

<p>"You go about a good deal with Toby Entwhistle," she said with
tightened lips.</p>

<p>"I like him."</p>

<p>"Why does Sophie not go with you?"</p>

<p>"She says she dislikes him, is tired of him, and that he is
always giving her impertinent advice."</p>

<p>"You," replied Mrs. Falconer, deliberately, "have turned him
against her. He was devoted to her till you came along."</p>

<p>Lucie controlled her rising indignation.</p>

<p>"Why should she care as she is so wrapped up in another man?"
she asked.</p>

<p>"When are you going back to Italy?" demanded Mrs.</p>

<p>Falconer.</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"I've told you."</p>

<p>"I suppose your marriage is off. For God's sake don't make a
fool of yourself with this young man. He hasn't a penny or any
likelihood of ever making any. I should have thought you would have
had your lesson in that direction."</p>

<p>Lucie could not explain; she could hardly bear to mention Carlo
Ghisleri to anyone, least of all to Mrs. Falconer.</p>

<p>Her aunt continued, with emphatic bitterness, with dramatic
directness.</p>

<p>"A woman like you ought to have the world at her
feet&mdash;you've got talents, looks, success, you're popular. You
let it all slip through your fingers. Can't you see the life other
women of your sort are leading? You go on making a fool of yourself
again and again."</p>

<p>"What do you want me to do? asked Lucie.</p>

<p>"Take a house in town, entertain, advertise yourself,
dress&mdash;you can easily get credit if you haven't the
money&mdash;" The same tirade; Lucie listened dully.</p>

<p>"You see I don't like that," she said when Mrs. Falconer had
finished.</p>

<p>Her aunt returned angrily to the other grievance.</p>

<p>"As for the way you are behaving with this commonplace young
man&mdash;you might have been content with being engaged six weeks
after Pio's death&mdash;"</p>

<p>Lucie rose.</p>

<p>"What do you mean&mdash;the way I am behaving?"</p>

<p>"I know what Sophie tells me."</p>

<p>"But you are always for freedom, for having men friends, look
how you have allowed Sophie to go about&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Mrs. Falconer was never to be reduced to any consistency of
behaviour or opinion.</p>

<p>"I will not have this going on in my house," she said. "Toby
Entwhistle doesn't come here again. You must find another place to
carry on your intrigues, my dear girl."</p>

<p>She left the room.</p>

<p>Lucie, hearing such a word applied to her sober, decorous
acquaintanceship (it was hardly friendship) with the quiet Toby,
could scarcely help smiling; she knew this outburst was purely
jealous hysteria on Mrs. Falconer's part. Jealousy, not on her own
account, but on that of Sophie, who daily seemed to be more plainly
stamped failure.</p>

<p>Still Lucie was very tired of hysteria; it was becoming as
common as cigarettes or sweets or face powder.</p>

<p>How to get away from it all?</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; V</p>

<p>Her next letter to Carlo Ghisleri had something of a desperate
note, his answer was, for the first time, touched with despair.</p>

<p>He had no hopes of his health.</p>

<p>He forbade her to come out to him.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch42" id="ch42">Forty-Two</a>
</h2>

<p class="cpb">&sect; I</p>

<p>LUCIE was waiting, body and soul, for deliverance from hope and
fear, for the final immaterial fulfilment of her inner
forebodings.</p>

<p>In September it came.</p>

<p>She received a letter from Italy by the afternoon post, just as
she was about to go out with Sophie to a <i>thé dansant,</i> a
charity affair at one of the big hotels.</p>

<p>Standing in the mean little room, wearing the white cloak and
black velvet hat he had so approved of, she read the mandate of her
inexorable fate.</p>

<p>A slight stroke had warned him of the uncertainty of his days,
the impossibility of his marriage; he bade her remember her promise
not to come to him.</p>

<p>"You would be my nurse, not my wife. There could be no children.
Lucie, my one love, spare me."</p>

<p>Lucie did not read all the letter; she thrust it into the bosom
of her yellow silk dress and went downstairs to join Sophie.</p>

<p>As people have been supposed to walk a pace or so after being
fatally wounded or shot, so Lucie went through that afternoon.</p>

<p>She spoke and even laughed with her acquaintances, she sat on a
gilt settee with crowds of other women filling the walls and
watched a few couples circle round the shining floor; the men
looked sallow and bored, the girls self-conscious and faded; the
orchestra played mechanically, spacing their pieces out with
intervals as long as possible; Sophie, "out of it" as usual, smoked
to show how up-to-date she was and kept glancing at her reflection
in a plate glass mirror behind the grand piano.</p>

<p>Lucie saw everything with the clear-sightedness of a disembodied
spirit; so utterly detached was she from the scene that she viewed
it with the cold indifference a sick man in his agony might turn on
a book of pictures fluttered in front of him.</p>

<p>She saw the stout Jewess who had organized the entertainment
dancing with the lifeless youths whose tickets she had paid for,
perspiration making her paint and powder into a paste, white
draperies swathed dexterously over the costly corsets that dragged
her together; her feet bulging above gilt shoes, her legs bulging
between cross-over ribbons, her huge hat scratching against the
palm fronds, the aquamarine pendant on her broad bosom lying as
flat and as soft as if it was on a cushion in a jeweller's
window.</p>

<p>Her husband, eager, servile, on whom Plutus in a moment of even
intenser blindness than usual had bestowed great wealth, moved
about rapidly from one to another of the manless women trying to
soften the acidity of their neglected state by the sunshine of his
Eastern smiles.</p>

<p>There were not half-a-dozen men in the room. They, after the
manner of Englishmen, appeared not to trouble about the women at
all, but stood in a listless melancholy as if awaiting an
opportunity to escape. When they were constrained to a perfunctory
politeness, they performed their courtesies with an air of painful
reserve and furtive terror as if they were aware they belonged to a
precious minority that was being fiercely pursued.</p>

<p>The very efficient lady secretary of the organization that was
(presumably) benefiting from this inept display of vanity and
boredom, moved briskly about with ready smiles and the flick of
fashionable draperies.</p>

<p>Lucie had often wondered if anyone really could be as refined
and gracious as she appeared to be, as perpetually good-humoured
and grateful.</p>

<p>As the orchestra continued to play, as the dull couples
continued to gyrate, as the silly little cups tinkled and the
plates of cakes were passed languidly from one to another, Lucie
began to feel an immediate desire to get away.</p>

<p>"This is all absurd," she thought, "I must go to Italy. I ought
to be there now&mdash;I must go to Italy by the next boat."</p>

<p>She rose.</p>

<p>"I am going home," 'she said to Sophie. For a second she thought
of making a confidant of her cousin, of making some appeal to her
affection, to her sympathy; but the impulse was at once gone.</p>

<p>Sophie glanced up.</p>

<p>"I shall stay," she answered, "I may be late. I think of going
to the studio."</p>

<p>"Isn't Toby coming to supper?" asked Lucie.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't care if he is."</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; II</p>

<p>Lucie reached "home," ironical name for the cheerless, dirty
place furnished by alien fingers for the sheer purpose of easy
gain; Mrs. Falconer was out; the daily woman had left; Lucie was
glad of the loneliness.</p>

<p>She went upstairs to her disliked bedroom and began feverishly
throwing clothes into her trunk; if she had had sufficient money in
the house she would have left by the night-boat. As it was she felt
a relief in packing; without pause she flung in her garments and
all the personal objects of hers about the room, his photograph,
his little gifts, books, mantle, bag&mdash;all the dear intimate
trifles he had given her; what pleasure there was in this definite
action at last after these long stagnant days!</p>

<p>"I cannot stay away," she kept saying to herself: "He doesn't
mean me to keep that promise&mdash;he must need me&mdash;"</p>

<p>She was on her knees by the trunk absorbed to the exclusion of
every other thought in this idea and folding up her clothes rapidly
with cold hands when an intense stillness seemed to fall on the
empty house.</p>

<p>It had been still before but this was like an intensification of
that silence, as if the outer world had suddenly become remote.</p>

<p>Lucie looked up, checked in her absorption and glanced at the
half-open door.</p>

<p>She was apprehensive of a footfall on the stairs, but there was
no sound whatever.</p>

<p>Then, as she still stared, she believed that she saw Carlo
Ghisleri, as she had last beheld him, in his dark travelling suit,
looking at her with such intense and passionate appeal that she
closed her eyes as if they had gazed too cose on naked
flame.</p>

<p>But, with her eyes closed, she beheld this figure of her lover
the same, no blotting of her material vision could obscure him from
her perception.</p>

<p>And she heard him say, very law and distinctly, in Italian.</p>

<p>"Lucie, have pity on me."</p>

<p>She opened her eyes on to the horror of emptiness; for one
second her feeling quivered between panic and exaltation.</p>

<p>She knew now that she could never go back to him. Catching
mechanically at her cloak and her bag she ran downstairs and out of
the house.</p>

<p>More mechanically than by her own volition, she made her way to
the Post Office, and sent him this message.</p>

<p>"I obey. But what shall I do with the rest of life?"</p>

<p>The autumnal twilight was closing in; Lucie walked rapidly away
from the houses and out on to Hampstead Heath.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; III</p>

<p>She passed the pond and "The Spaniards," walked round that
wooded height where the whole of London can be seen flat about the
river.</p>

<p>A tawny-coloured mist rose from the city almost obscuring it;
the upper heavens were a frosty white against which the smoked
trees showed black; the long path was dry and dusty, the foliage
that covered the slope was rusty-brown above the worn turf; a chill
steady' breeze was blowing and in one or two of the distant houses
on the Heath a little light twinkled, with that heart-rending look
of home which makes all but 'the very happiest hearts ache.</p>

<p>The forlorn woman sat on one of the low benches and shivering
looked down at the huge city being gradually blotted into the
mist.</p>

<p>She was bereft, homeless; she had shelter, not a home, she had
relatives, but she belonged to no family.</p>

<p>And Love, who was to have created all these things for her, had
failed; she was banished from his presence.</p>

<p>He was still there, still faithful, more than ever she relied
upon his deathless constancy, but he was bankrupt&mdash;she stood
stripped, lonely, as she had always stood and he could not help
her.</p>

<p>Lucie folded her hands in her lap and the tears came to her eyes
and ran over.</p>

<p>How monstrous, how incredible, that he should be ill&mdash;a man
so magnificent, so vital; how ghastly that such a love as theirs
should have such an end.</p>

<p>It was a bitter hour for this poor woman who had bloomed for
such a brief while in the sunshine for which she so desperately
craved; for the first time in her life she felt definitely bitter
towards the world, towards the whole miserable system that made
such an existence as hers possible, towards the worthless father
she had never known who had assumed no responsibility towards her,
whose self-indulgence had left her with jangled nerves and
bequeathed her the legacy of a starved, pinched childhood, and a
womanhood unprotected, unadvised; against her smug relations with
their tenth-rate morality, their moral cowardice, their
hypocritical pleasantness (now she was established as a
money-making unit), which could never quite disguise their nervous
fear she might be some burden on them yet. Apprehensively they
always spoke of their limited incomes; limited also were their
hearts and minds, their generous impulses; for all they had ever
concerned themselves about her she might have been in the gutter by
now, probably would have been had she not possessed a few gifts of
commercial value.</p>

<p>And now she was forlorn after her gorgeous hopes, there was no
one to care, to bother, to even remotely sympathize.</p>

<p>She might go on as she had begun, snatching a forlorn livelihood
among the jostling ranks of superfluous women, decking up barren
charms, getting what excitement she could out of the seething
crowds of professional people like herself who derived a living out
of the artistic requirements of the British public.</p>

<p>And what was ahead?</p>

<p>She looked shudderingly down at the city now closely enfolded in
the autumn mist. Just to be another of those myriad women down
there, just to be one more in the packed dubs, the crowded tea
shops, the sweltering buses, the dingy offices, the press of the
hungry streets, a thing no one really wanted.</p>

<p>Her work?</p>

<p>Plenty of men could do that better, plenty of women as well.</p>

<p>Her career?</p>

<p>She knew that she might be what Mrs. Falconer had called a
social success, quite popular, even liked, with a few odd men to
take her about and drink and smoke in her flat and call her my dear
girl&mdash;even to make her a pal, or a chum; but she also knew
that such a prospect was abomination.</p>

<p>She wanted the big things, the real, deep, sincere emotions, the
passions that touch high-water mark.</p>

<p>And how, once she had loved Carlo Ghisleri, could she tolerate
the shame she had disliked before?</p>

<p>She was aware of her graces of person, of some delicate feminine
charm, of a certain lovable personality; in the mirror of Carlo
Ghisleri's adoration she had, with all modesty, read something of
her worth.</p>

<p>But was she to do what the other women of her acquaintance did,
take her womanly attractions as assets into the market place to
bring off business deals, to flatter and wheedle, to beguile men
into favouring her, into giving her 'a good time'?</p>

<p>She knew she could not; never had she been able to act on Mrs.
Falconer's advice on "managing men," never could she do what Lydia
Copeland did with such success and Sophie with such failure.</p>

<p>In her misery, as she sat shivering there in the autumn mist and
chill, she saw nothing ahead of her but withdrawal into some
retreat where she could continue to earn the money for her aunt,
her cousin and herself, from some kind of nunnery where she could
exist on her love for a man who she was never to see.</p>

<p>Yet this was but a poor solution, a mere negation, a passive
submission, a death in life.</p>

<p>She moved at length, drearily, with stiff limbs, walked lonely
and slow through the bleak English dusk.</p>

<p>"Oh, Carlo, Carlo, Carlo!"</p>

<p>It seemed impossible that he had forsaken her, impossible that
even now he would not find some means to rescue her; she uttered
his name like some desperate prayer; through her sad wretchedness
glimmered the conviction that he was near her and would help, even
now.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; IV</p>

<p>Through the raw mist, scented with decaying leaves, and the
smoky twilight one star hung, remote and chill, above the dark
height of the Heath.</p>

<p>Lucie looked at it and, remembering how he and she had viewed it
that last September, trembling above the peaks of the Apennine
Mountains, she was utterly overcome and stood still, in the
melancholy dusk, cold to her inmost soul with bleak despair.</p>

<p>A man's figure came up out of the gloom and paused beside
her.</p>

<p>"I thought I knew your white cloak," he said.</p>

<p>It was Toby Entwhistle.</p>

<p>Lucie recalled, through her dull misery, that he had been asked
to supper; although Mrs. Falconer declared she disliked him, she
still frequently invited him to the house.</p>

<p>"Oh, you found no one in," said Lucie stupidly.</p>

<p>"No," he answered good-humouredly. "Of course it doesn't matter.
I thought I might meet one of you if I came up here."</p>

<p>Lucie was making a convulsive effort at composure.</p>

<p>"Sophie has gone to the studio, she may be late&mdash;I'm
dreadfully sorry. I don't quite know where Mrs. Falconer is and
I&mdash;"</p>

<p>Her voice faded in her throat, she was conscious now of fatigue
and cold, of the lassitude of nervous exhaustion.</p>

<p>"I have had bad news from Italy," she added.</p>

<p>"Bad news?" His voice was kind and anxious.</p>

<p>"Yes. Dr. Ghisleri is&mdash;ill."</p>

<p>"Are you going out to him?" asked Toby quickly.</p>

<p>They were walking away slowly side by. side through the cold
dusk.</p>

<p>"No. He will not allow it."</p>

<p>"I can understand that."</p>

<p>"You can?"</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>"I am bound," shivered Lucie. "I promised. I think he was always
afraid of this. Knew it in his heart, really. I think we both
did."</p>

<p>Then, shuddering lest she should betray her secret agony, she
added quickly.</p>

<p>"I had better go back now&mdash;will you come? Perhaps Sophie
has returned and got some supper."</p>

<p>"You can't go back to that dark cold house. Supposing no one has
returned? Let us go somewhere and get a little food."</p>

<p>Lucie did not demur; to-night she did not care for Sophie's
jealousy or Mrs. Falconer's nerves, and she was grateful that the
one person of her acquaintance whom she could have borne to see,
was the person who had found her this evening of bitterness.</p>

<p>Certainly Toby Entwhistle understood. Remembering the intensity
of her voiceless prayer that some relief would come into her
stricken desolation, she thrilled with mysterious comfort at the
strange thought that her lover had somehow sent this other man to
stand by her; she was very sure that Carlo Ghisleri would have been
glad for her to have this companion now.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; V</p>

<p>Yet presently, when she looked at him across the tiny white
table of the quiet restaurant, she disliked him, she resented him,
for his look of youth. She became fearfully jealous of this one
possession he had, which her lover did not possess&mdash;the one
possession that out-valued all the others. She marked with envy his
ruddy golden face, firm and unlined, his clear hazel eyes, his
young hands...if only she could have met the other man at his age;
the irony of the comparison between the two men sickened her; the
little meal seemed forlorn compared to those she had shared with
Carlo Ghisleri, as the damp dark of the London streets seemed
melancholy compared to those sparkling Italian autumn evenings.</p>

<p>Lucie glanced at the other couples scattered round the long
room, glowing with warm apricot light; certainly to some of them
the surroundings held magic, the moment enchantment; how horrible
to know that she never could or would find either, ever again.</p>

<p>Very early she rose to go home, though she dreaded the return to
the house in Hampstead and to the two antagonistic women, to whom
she must "explain."</p>

<p>As they neared the tube station, she half mechanically asked
Toby Entwhistle to come up and see them soon.</p>

<p>"I am going away soon," he answered. "I've given up my job. I
hate town really. I'm going into the country to do a little
farming."</p>

<p>Lucie looked at him in surprise; he flushed.</p>

<p>"I'm not the kind to get on in business," he added, smiling and
awkward. "And London doesn't seem to me quite worth while&mdash;to
men like me," he added modestly.</p>

<p>"Come and see us before you go," said Lucie sadly; she felt his
going would emphasize her loneliness. "I think you are right," she
finished. "Goodnight."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch43" id="ch43">Forty-Three</a>
</h2>

<p class="cpb">&sect; I</p>

<p>THIS episode was the end of the incongruous household at
Hampstead, which had always been like a house of cards built at the
edge of a volcano.</p>

<p>Mrs. Falconer made one of the scenes that caused Lucie an almost
physical illness. She refused to believe the Italian news, she
vowed that Lucie had sneaked away from Sophie at the <i>thé
dansant</i> to meet Toby Entwhistle on the sly, and that he had cut
the supper as a deliberate insult.</p>

<p>The fact that neither she nor Sophie had returned home till an
hour after the time named to the young man, did not soften her keen
invective.</p>

<p>Lucie, sickened, yet bore it without anger; her aunt still
seemed to her a pathetic, even a heroic figure; her furies were so
plainly traceable to the one source, wounded jealousy, because
Sophie was such an utter failure and because one more young man had
proved indifferent to her; in painful self-deception she had always
counted every male acquaintance as a possible husband for her
daughter and every man who disappointed her, received the emptied
vials of her wrath and scorn.</p>

<p>Sophie, pallid and acid, went to join Elinor Kennaway in the tea
shop venture; she did not say goodbye to Lucie, who found her going
a great relief; it had been hard to endure her cousin's rude
manners, her bitter spyings, her rush down to the post to secure
and steam the letters in the morning, her telegrams, telephones,
letters to Simon Kaye, her gloomy sulks, sham headaches, and sham
heroics, laziness, and the obsession of what she called "a great
passion." Fostered by her unhappy mother's infatuation for her,
this woman was now really not only a useless, but an evil,
creature; it was as if her soul rotted while her undesired beauty
decayed and she gave out a miasma of putrefaction. When she had
gone, leaving her poisoned sting behind her, Mrs. Falconer made one
last effort for the domination of Lucie.</p>

<p>"You have driven your cousin out of this house. I also shall be
forced to leave. I will not endure that young man here again."</p>

<p>"I can't forbid him the house," said Lucie, wearily, "nor meet
him outside. I sickened of that with Pio. You quarrelled with him
just the same, you know."</p>

<p>"And for the same reasons&mdash;because of your underhand ways.
I suppose you have broken your engagement with this Italian?"</p>

<p>"As you can't believe what I say about that, I have asked him to
write to you himself."</p>

<p>This did not appease Mrs. Falconer in the least.</p>

<p>"I do not pretend to understand your affairs," she declared,
"but I do know how you have behaved towards Sophie&mdash;"</p>

<p>Lucie could hardly bear the repetition of that name.</p>

<p>"Why doesn't Sophie get married?" she asked vehemently. "She
wants these men always behind her but she doesn't want to marry
them, or says so&mdash;she affects to despise Toby, and yet she
must raise all this because I am civil to him and I won't be rude
to him because of Sophie."</p>

<p>This was a long and daring speech for Lucie to make to her aunt,
and she made it with a kind of desperation as of one lashing at a
tangled web that bound them; all the confusion of these complex yet
foolish feminine emotions were raising up grinning spectres of
tragedy. Lucie felt herself being engulfed, drawn down, sucked into
a vortex of these desperate women's passions, so small, so puerile,
so childish in themselves, yet capable of such devastating
results.</p>

<p>Mrs. Falconer left the house; she flew to the refuge of another
homeless creature like herself, Clara Biddulph, who had got the
loan of a little cottage in Kent.</p>

<p>She demanded money from Lucie before she went and Lucie gave her
rather more than half of all she possessed in the world, or was
likely to possess for some time.</p>

<p>Like Sophie, she departed in anger, without farewells; the
banging of the door after her made the cheap little house shake.
Lucie, who still loved her, sat in her desolate bedroom and
wept.</p>

<p>It was all so ordinary, so commonplace; it was what always
happened when grown women lived together&mdash;that is, free,
emancipated, modern women, who despised the ancient laws, tore up
the ancient landmarks, and blotted out the ancient records. What
was this freedom but loneliness? What was this license but
despair?</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; II</p>

<p>Again Lucie found herself alone in a wretched furnished house,
full of the atmosphere of restlessness and discontent, burdened
again with the debts, obligations and bitterness of this
extravagant yet sordid London life; faced with the prospect of
steady work to earn not only her own living, but that of the two
women towards whom she was in this queer position that, the more
they quarrelled with her, the more she felt in honour bound to
supply their needs.</p>

<p>Mrs. Falconer at least must be given money, the ultimate end of
which would be, of course, Sophie.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; III</p>

<p>She was, of course, really free at last.</p>

<p>Free to go where she liked, do what she liked, behave as she
liked in a period and a city that allowed everything to women.</p>

<p>There was no husband, brother, father, or guardian, no family,
or organization, or code, responsible for her; no one had the right
to even advise her; she was quite, quite free.</p>

<p>Free to hang herself, if she wished, without anyone to stay her
hand or to lament her afterwards.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; IV</p>

<p>Carlo Ghisleri sent an eager reply to her agonised query: "What
shall I do with the rest of my life?"</p>

<p>His passionate affection, his everlasting love, was bitter-sweet
to the lonely woman.</p>

<p>"You will marry," he wrote, "you will have children, they will
be my children too, the children of your thoughts of me, of our
infinite love, during what remains to me of life. I live only in
your happiness, and only this way can such a woman as you find
happiness."</p>

<p>Lucie thought of the glow-worms in the garden of the Villa
Calvini, of the music of the reeds on the lonely shore.
Happiness?</p>

<p>She knew she could never achieve that again, never, never. But
his words raised a faint glow in her heart, opened up the one
prospect that made the future appear endurable.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; V</p>

<p>She lively lonely as an anchorite in the miserable little house
that she could not afford to leave till the lease was up.</p>

<p>She worked and she kept herself from suicide by Carlo Ghisleri's
letters.</p>

<p>Lucie had letters from Toby Entwhistle, too he told her of his
farm; he was making, or would make, about the weekly wage of a day
labourer, but he wrote as if he were happy.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; VI</p>

<p>With October, the month that should have seen her triumphantly
returning to her lover, Lucie became f Tightened of her loneliness;
she went out desperately everywhere she was invited, she lived
between her clubs, other women's clubs and other people's houses
and public buildings, she seldom returned to the Hampstead house
save to sleep.</p>

<p>She began to look for some other place in which to live, in
London, again a furnished flat or house.</p>

<p>"I shall shape in time," she thought, "into a perfect specimen
of the modern woman."</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; VII</p>

<p>One evening she was going out to a public dinner; for lack of
company she had been talking to the old woman she had induced to
come in place of the bizarre servant of Sophie's choosing. Lucie
liked to talk to this humble creature whose speech was full of the
homely things of life that are the great things, too, births and
weddings and deaths, work and illness, the struggle, the toil, the
brave heart that makes it all worth while.</p>

<p>Lucie moved from the narrow kitchen into the bleak drawing-room
and turned up the electric light.</p>

<p>The night was cold and windy and she did not really wish to go
out, yet it was better to go than to stay in this empty house, by
the desolate hearth.</p>

<p>The bell rang; Lucie turned her head sharply; very few people
indeed came to see her here, and none at this hour; all her
entertaining was done at the club. Mrs. Jennings shuffled to the
door and opened it on the bitter wind and Toby Entwhistle. He saw
Lucie through the two open doors, "may I come in?"</p>

<p>"Of course&mdash;but I am just going out."</p>

<p>She spoke with confusion. "I did not know you were
coming&mdash;"</p>

<p>He entered: she thought she detected a shiver of disgust as he
looked round the room; she remembered how Carlo Ghisleri would have
hated the place.</p>

<p>"Isn't it dreary?" she said. "I am moving soon."</p>

<p>"It is pretty bad," he agreed. "I always hated this place. But
Sophie would have it."</p>

<p>"Poor Sophie!" said Lucie; she seated herself on the faded
cretonne couch, her white cloak over her black velvet dress, her
fair hair shining in the unshaded electric light; she looked at
Toby shyly; he seemed changed, even more ruddy, golden, fresh with
the fragrance of the country, young and healthy, vital and
pleasant.</p>

<p>She asked him what he was doing; it was nothing much, or odd,
only what so many other men, ex-officers, were doing; he had put
all his savings into a tiny place in Sussex and was trying to work
it; with the help of his pension he could command a bare
living&mdash;but he liked the life.</p>

<p>Lucie looked at him curiously as he spoke; it seemed to her that
he was like Carlo Ghisleri, not outwardly, but in the spirit of his
manhood, and that she was in the presence of the same essence in
another vessel as it were.</p>

<p>She thought of the lines of Dr. Donne:</p>

<br>

<p class="verse">"Once or twice I loved thee<br>
Ere I knew thy name or face."</p>

<br>

<p>It was a curious sensation; she trembled and glanced behind her
as if she expected to see Carlo standing there urging her to see
himself in this other man, to accept from this other what he could
no longer offer himself.</p>

<p>"I must go." She rose. "Will you come with me?"</p>

<p>"I will take you to the door."</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; VIII</p>

<p>In the cab she said:</p>

<p>"You must be near where? used to live."</p>

<p>"Yes, quite close."</p>

<p>"You knew?"</p>

<p>"My little girl is buried there," said Lucie, "I want to go, but
I do not dare."</p>

<p>"I've been," he answered quietly. "It's&mdash;all&mdash;in
order."</p>

<p>When they reached the garish stream of light in front of the
hotel and saw the people hurrying out of the wind into the warm
vestibule, Lucie did not move.</p>

<p>"I won't go in," she whispered, "I don't think I could to-night.
I'm tired really."</p>

<p>"Where would you like to go? I hoped you might come out with
me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;I'll go&mdash;back" She could not say "home."</p>

<p>They did not speak on the return journey. Lucie looked out of
the window at the empty, cold, wind-swept streets; some mystic
power was urging her to some action, she could not tell what; all
was confusion to her save that she felt sure that Carlo's spirit
was with her, controlling her as the mesmerist controls his
subject.</p>

<p>As the taxi stopped, she turned; Toby was looking at her, his
earnest comely face had an expression of frowning concentration, an
anguish of intense feeling.</p>

<p>Lucie bent and kissed him as Carlo Ghisleri had bent and kissed
her; she thought that this was what she was being impelled to do,
that in this way she had established a chain of passion between
them or rather, linked from one to another the same passion that
rose in each.</p>

<p>The young man did not speak; she felt his deep breath. She went
into the house without speaking to him or looking back.</p>

<h2><a name="ch44" id="ch44">Chapter Forty-Four</a>
</h2>

<p class="cpb">&sect; I</p>

<p>THE mechanical notes of the gramophone ground out a gasping
syncopated fox-trot, <i>"You're only just a cross-eyed nigger
doll";</i> by the big polished box that held the whirring black
disc and the gleaming silver arm, was a gilt paper sack of
chocolates and an open case of cigarettes.</p>

<p>The big pleasant room was overheated and too full of people;
five couples were dancing; pressed close together, they moved
slowly, taking pains not to keep time to the gramophone.</p>

<p>By the huge fireplace a sickly girl in a very low frock was
seated in an attitude that showed her champagne silk stockings to
the knee; she had a box of chocolates on her lap and kept biting
the ends of one after another, then hurling the rest into the
flames as each centre met with her disapproval.</p>

<p>Near the large curtained window two youths lounged, talking
about themselves.</p>

<p>The hostess, a middle-aged woman with a young figure, was making
Turkish coffee; her daughter, seated on a jazz cushion on the
floor, was feeding a debauched Pekingese with cocoanut kisses she
claimed to have manufactured herself; the obese dog spat out the
sickly sweet.</p>

<p>All the women wanted to dance and there were not enough
partners; the air was charged with feminine jealousy and
competition; the men, all third-rate in physique, added to the
usual rudeness of Englishmen the insolence of conscious value; all
the women flattered them, wooed them, covertly, in the clipped
staccato slang of the moment. They called each other "grinning
apes" and "priceless fools" and "ugly rotters"; they threw their
half-chewed sweets and cakes at each other; the men complained of
the size of the girls' ankles and suggested that they looked as if
they had been "pulled through a hedge backwards"; the girls
screamed incivilities to the mien to which the wits replied "thank
you."</p>

<p>The gramophone whizzed to the end of, "<i>You're only a
cross-eyed nigger doll</i>," and another record was put on,
<i>"Cheese parings"</i>; to the bumping grunts of this the girls
performed a shivering kind of Eastern bazaar dance that a low music
hall would have banned a few years ago; some of the men said,
"filthy," upon which the girls went up and made faces at them.</p>

<p>It was a very pleasant party, very up-to-late, given by very
popular delightful people; anyone in the room was quite a
well-known and brilliant member of the upper ranks of the artistic
set.</p>

<p>Lucie had often been here before; she had rather liked coming
for the sake of the gaiety and distraction, but she had never been
to a large gathering like this; she sat in a corner by the
gramophone wondering why she felt quite so utterly "out of it"; how
it was that she could not throw some glamour over the scene, take
some part in the game all the others played so naturally.</p>

<p>This sort of thing had been her life, more or less, always, and
yet she was so alien to it, as if she had been transported there
from another planet.</p>

<p>The dancing ceased; the men wiped sweat from their sallow,
pimpled faces, the girls powdered complexions already dried by
cosmetics; cigarettes were flung from one to another, painted lips
showed the yellow of real, or, the dead white of artificial teeth;
all showed as much of their limbs as possible; everyone knew that
only true modesty dared such license; one knew now that only prudes
covered up their persons.</p>

<p>They talked of nothing but sex, which they seemed to find a
witless joke; the very word marriage evoked cackles of laughter,
the funniest thing in the world was someone in love; the women
ridiculed absent women's efforts to get married, or their marital
difficulties, if they were; the whole company seemed to think
anything either sacred, or indecent was really "funny"; they told
tales of women who "couldn't keep their hands off men," and
everyone seemed really amused. Plays were mentioned if they were
obscene or likely to make money; pictures, if they were suggestive,
an actress or singer, if any spicy anecdote attached to her name;
everyone was minutely acquainted with recent divorce court
cases.</p>

<p>The women laughed at stories that belittled women; the men
laughed at stories that jeered at manhood; all of them expressed
themselves as greedy for money they didn't have to work for. The
air became heavy with smoke, the gramophone droned out: <i>"I just
love you when you're squirming."</i> Not a single word of sense was
spoken; if the conversation rose above the lowest level (by any
rare chance), a dense illiteracy was displayed; yet all these
people were somehow earning their own livings and showed
considerable shrewdness in the conduct of their own affairs.</p>

<p>The older women warned the younger not to get married: "Husbands
are such a bore," and "we've got other occupations now." The
younger women answered "No fear!"</p>

<p>Yet the eyes of all of them shone with longing for love,
insatiate vanity and fierce desires, while the men's gaze was dull
and apathetic, jaded with the frank grossness, the un-alluring
freedom of the women whose sole hunting ground this was; but they,
the men, were indifferent, for they were free of other pastures
which fact the women sensed angrily but dare not admit save in
jeering innuendo.</p>

<p>"And so they'll go on," thought Lucie, "there is no end to
it&mdash;it isn't as if they were all young&mdash;some of these
creatures in sacks and girdles must be forty&mdash;fifty. They
dress like that wretched child of twelve&mdash;and she knows as
much as they do."</p>

<p>She thought of the sea, of the Apennine hills, of the golden
chestnut wood and belt of pines, of the peasant coming home tired
and the children meeting him on the road, of the woman stirring the
pot over the fire.</p>

<p>What had Carlo Ghisleri said?</p>

<p>The little house, the man, the woman and the child by the fire;
all the rest, fairy tales they tell each other before they go to
sleep. "And I sit here like this."</p>

<p>She rose.</p>

<p>"I must be going," she said in excuse to the fat man who had to
move to let her pass, "I'm leaving town tomorrow," she added on a
swift impulse.</p>

<p>"What for?" he asked amused, "to grow cabbages?"</p>

<p>"Something of the kind," answered Lucie.</p>

<p>"I never can think," he protested, "what people do in the
country."</p>

<p>"Well, plant cabbages," smiled Lucie, "I'd rather a man planted
good cabbage than wrote a bad book," she added gravely to the
prosperous author. "In fact I think I'd rather a man planted a bad
cabbage than wrote a good book&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, London is good enough for me," he answered, "it's a grand
life."</p>

<p>"It's some busy," said an American behind him. "You women get a
good show. I ask you."</p>

<p>"Do you think so?" questioned Lucie. "Yes," she added, "a good
show. Like the cattle in the pens on a market day."</p>

<p>He grinned.</p>

<p>"I guess a lot trot home without being bid for."</p>

<p>"Well, you've got your freedom," said the best-seller, who
rather liked talking to Lucie, who was a lion in her way and always
a conspicuous personality. "And it must be rather good fun&mdash;to
successful ladies like you."</p>

<p>Lucie smiled.</p>

<p>"Do you remember the old fairy tale? The imprisoned princess who
longed for the green leaves and white flowers she couldn't reach
outside her window? And how at last after infinite pains she
escaped? And how bleak it was outside? And she wasn't a princess
any more but just a drab nobody&mdash;and when she tried to get
back, the door was shut."</p>

<p>"But she got the flowers?"</p>

<p>"Oh, they were stinging nettles!" said Lucie, "and they hurt her
very much."</p>

<p>He looked at her shrewdly, with a more human expression than she
had ever seen on his exultant face before.</p>

<p>"What has that to do with your visit to the country?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"I'm going to see if I can push the door open, after all," she
answered.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; II</p>

<p>Lucie had found courage to push open the churchyard gate; the
last leaves dropped from the hawthorn by the wall; beyond the meek
mounds, the tilting headstones, the whole marshland to the sea lay
a wash with winter sunshine.</p>

<p>The air was humid, yet fresh; though the clear spaces of the
heavens were veiled by tremulous clouds, the atmosphere was full of
quickening light that here and there, and now and then, deepened
into a hesitant mote or beam of sunshine.</p>

<p>Here, even standing in the churchyard, Lucie had no sense of
death or extinction or any pause in nature's endless life; it was
late autumn verging into winter; yet there was not the common
association of these seasons with decay, desolation and loss, not
at least to this woman who stood so near her little child's
grave.</p>

<p>It was but the intake and the outlet of a breath; the fields
were not barren because they were bare.</p>

<p>Opposite the low Saxon church a long field ran down the slope to
the marsh; the crop had been harvested and grass had grown over the
stubble, mingled with camomile daisies, fleabane and sowthistle,
for the season had been moist and sunless; sheep grazed over these
rich leavings; and, in one corner, the figure of the brown
ploughman guided the dun horse along the fresh soft furrows of the
newly turned earth.</p>

<p>Beyond, an orchard hung heavy with the unheeded fruit. Nature,
heedless of profit or gain, flung her gifts in opulent profusion;
pears, apples and damsons showed in abundant warm colour among the
dry curling leaves.</p>

<p>Lucie moved slowly to the little grave; near it stood a Roman
altar that had for two thousand years crowned this height above the
marsh.</p>

<p>She was melted by an infinite sadness; the sting, the horror,
the nightmare dreads and terror were gone.</p>

<p>The earth was kind and the heavens were pitiful, the rain was
sweet and the wind friendly, lovely was the caress of the sun,
beautiful the darkness of the night, and every waving blade of
grass, and every high tree were symbols of peace and nobility.</p>

<p>Lucie, standing between that ancient pagan stone and the grave
of yesterday, felt time and space merge into eternity; how
desperately we cling to our invention of days and years, centuries
and epochs, and what do they mean?</p>

<p>We are sure of nothing but the light and the dark and the
flowing in and out of nature's breath which we call the
seasons.</p>

<p>Lucie was then one with the old Roman who had set up that altar;
he was no further away than her own child, she felt the veil that
divided her from both of them blow thin in the wind that blew now,
as two thousand years ago, up from the near-by coast where the
legions of Claudius crossed the sparkling sands.</p>

<p>Are not the winds the same now as then? Do the clouds pile the
same over the North Downs and cast their flying shadows the same
over the marsh?</p>

<p>And why should we think we have changed because we have made
ourselves a few new toys?</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; III</p>

<p>Lucie left the churchyard and turned away from the village up
the narrow road that wound to the top of the hill.</p>

<p>She drew in the air with delight and everything she saw was
pleasant to her roused senses.</p>

<p>The white thatched Sussex cottages divided the loaded orchards
from the little gardens that edged the road; gardens now packed
with spotted lilies, ragged China asters, dahlias and Michaelmas
daisies that bent and drooped across the red tiled path; beyond
were the cabbages, purple-green, firm and fresh, hung with big
crystal drops and now and then one last rose, flaunting red or
fading pink.</p>

<p>Across the crimson tiled front of one cottage a twisted vine
trailed amber leaves and hard bunches of northern grapes; close to
another, the pure white plumage of ducks showed vivid in the dark
shade of a willow-hung pond.</p>

<p>A wide blue wain loaded with straw went by, the glossy horses
moved easily between the red shafts; then came a team of three
dragging a great tree lashed with chains; the men who iralked
beside the great, shining, patient animals were lean and
earth-coloured and silent. Two children with tow-coloured hair and
blue pinafores were pulling the berries from the damp, strong,
gaudy brambles in the hedge. Lucie kept her upward path.</p>

<p>An old man passed with a huge pannier of mushrooms on his back,
the pink and white and brown of them showed where the lid gaped; he
walked steadily, easing the strap across his chest with an
earth-stained hand.</p>

<p>Acorns falling from the cups, chestnut glossy between the split
shells, lay beneath the wayside trees; among the last odd flowers
of the shorn hedge-row, the stray colour of purple loose-strife,
clover or wild parsley, the last wisp of honeysuckle, the last star
of the bramble blossom among the swelling fruit.</p>

<p>Now at the very apex of the height Lucie could see straight
across the marsh shadowed by drifting clouds, to the mist that
bounded her vision and was the sea.</p>

<p>A woman went by, plain and drab; under her flat hat her face was
seamed like a map of life.</p>

<p>She carried a basket of eggs and a white hen.</p>

<p>Lucie looked after her wistfully; these people seemed to her
infinitely more important than those of her own class, nearer to
all that is vital and everlasting.</p>

<p>She valued more the shapeless shoes, the spread figure and the
spoilt hands of this woman than the neat daintiness of those others
with their chocolates, gramophones, naked mascots and restless
eyes.</p>

<p>Gnarled and bent was this peasant, ugly, perhaps grim; but she
was satisfied; she had washed the new-born baby and folded the
shroud over the empty cradle, she had held her children to her
bosom, and sewn her man's shirts and cooked his dinners, and sat in
a hollowed place with her descendants about her and thanked God for
her daily bread, and the sharp sweet toil of the light and the
deep, deep, quiet sleep of the darkness. She was rich in all
fundamental riches.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; IV</p>

<p>Lucie had a letter from her aunt in her pocket. Mrs. Falconer
had quarrelled with Mrs. Biddulph and made it up with Mrs. Bearish
whose flat she was now sharing; Sophie had quarrelled with Elinor
Kennaway over a young airman who wasn't interested in either of
them, and left the tea shop; she was going to take up dancing again
"quite seriously," wrote Mrs. Falconer, "this time."</p>

<p>She enclosed a newspaper cutting with a blatant photograph of
Simon Kaye; his vulgarity was very apparent now; his expensive
clothes were beginning to drag round his figure; in a few years he
would be obese.</p>

<p>Lucie had heard the rumour of his engagement to a flamboyant
widow, whose first husband had left her an odd million made from
some concoction pleasing to fools.</p>

<p>Poor Sophie! Poor Mrs. Falconer! Poor women all of them, so
astray, so unguided, so perverted from their natural destinies!
There was no helping them; as they were, so they would be, till
they shrivelled in their sterility and their thwarted natures gave
them sour peace.</p>

<p class="cpb">&sect; V</p>

<p>Lucie came to a tiny farm standing square in a flower-garden and
shaded by a walnut-tree; a gate at the side stood open on to a yard
where there was a stack of hay, another of straw, a dog, and a boy
clipping sheep.</p>

<p>A young man with a khaki shirt, sleeves rolled up, a very old
pair of breeches and muddy leggings, was standing on a ladder
drawing a jade green tarpaulin over the haystack; his hair showed
the colour of the rick above his thick burnt neck; he was covered
with chaff and dried chips of clover and grass.</p>

<p>On the midden heap a gold cock stood gravely; piles of fresh
sawn wood were stacked beneath a huge hollow oak; beyond were the
dipping teeming fields and the blue veiled sky closing all in like
a tender embrace.</p>

<p>The young man was Toby Entwhistle.</p>

<p>Lucie went in.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch45" id="ch45">L'Envoi</a></h2>

<p>Two bare-foot boys came down the lane; the youngest had only
just learned to walk; they were fair and thick and serious and
shabby.</p>

<p>The elder clutched a stick with a flutter of rag attached, the
younger dragged a tin jug with a hole in it into which he
continually cast lumps of earth; they pattered into the garden and
ran round the house; their unconscious radiant faces were as
beautiful as Love could make them.</p>

<p>"Mummie," they called, one like an echo of the other, and Lucie
stood still behind the walnut-tree for the pleasure of hearing
those voices in that eager call.</p>

<p>This was what she had received in exchange for all she had put
aside; this was what she paid for by hard work, self-denial, some
poverty&mdash;a strenuous, monotonous life&mdash;her whole heart
cried out in gratitude&mdash;"What a small price! Ah! God! what a
paltry price!" In her hand was a letter from Carlo Ghisleri, one of
many such letters that filled with constant illumination the
existence of Toby Entwhistle's wife.</p>

<p>The man who had left the world and lived alone between the hills
and sea where they had met, lived only in the thought of her and
her happiness&mdash;"in our dear boys the dear, dear boys."</p>

<p>Carlino she called the elder, Carlino of the glow-worm and the
whistling reeds, Carlino, fairy-fire and fairy music incarnate.</p>

<p>She had sent him her photograph with the little boy beside her
and the grave heavy baby on her knee.</p>

<br>

<p><i>"Tu sei una vera 'Mater Adorabilis.' Ed io ti
guardo e adoro. Io ti guardo, ti redo e piango! E cosi vera
l'espressione del volto desiato...io vivo nella gioia della
contemplazione del tuo angelico e affectuoso volto...sorriso degli
amati bimbi...Carlino che batte col mio cuore...spazio e tempo non
hanno ormai per me una existenza...Io vivo nella veduta del trio
astro...ogni tristezza e scompiasa del mio cuore..."</i></p>

<br>

<p>The boys ran into the house, Toby was lighting a bonfire; the
wind swept the smoke across the marsh.</p>

<p>Lucie folded away her letter, went into the kitchen and began to
peel apples into a yellow bowl.</p>

<p>She looked through the open door at the figure of her husband,
dear and kind, so loved and valued, blending with and exalting that
other love she held immaculate, that other who lived in the thought
of her and blessed the husband who made her happy and the children
who had fulfilled those dreams of his that had eluded his own
fulfilment. The little boys ran out to their father with sudden
war-like shouts.</p>

<p>Luck put the apples on the fire.</p>

<p>Toil and the home fire, food, drink, sleep and waking, the
glance of a man to a woman, and the shout of children. What more
can there be?</p>

<p>There isn't anything else&mdash;never has been&mdash;never will
be.</p>

<p>"Save only my dreams, my fairy stories, the smoke blowing
seawards from my bonfire, from my hearth chimney, the words that
come from my heart when I tell my children tales, dreams and fairy
stories, and tales and smoke from my dead flowers and from my dear
hearth, all wafted seawards to thee."</p>

<p class="cp"><i>THIS IS ONLY ONE WOMAN'S STORY.</i></p>
