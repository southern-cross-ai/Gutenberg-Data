<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>THE RISEN DEAD</h2>

<h3><i>The Storyteller</i>, December 1907</h3>

<p>Sir Geoffrey Swayne was hanged at Tyburn.</p>

<p>A merry, reckless, roaring soul had been Sir Geoffrey, and if it
was said of him that in ten years he had never gone sober to bed,
yet was it confessed that he was a pleasant, humorous gentleman in
his cups, just as he was a pleasant, humorous gentleman in all the
other traffics that made up his rascally life. If he lost his money
at the tables, he did so with an amiable smile in his handsome eyes
and a jest on his lips. If at intervals, more or less regular, he
would beat his wife, periodically kick his servants down stairs,
and systematically grind the faces of his tenants, yet all these
things he did, at least, with an engaging joviality of
demeanour.</p>

<p>In short, he was a very affable, charming scoundrel, and all
England was agreed that he richly deserved his end. And yet, the
humour of the thing&mdash;and it was just such a jest as Sir
Geoffrey would have relished had it been less against
himself&mdash;lay in the fact that although none of the rascally
things he had done could be considered by the law of England reason
enough for hanging him, the crime for which he was
hanged&mdash;that of highway robbery&mdash;was the one crime it had
never occurred to him to commit.</p>

<p>The thing had fallen out in this wise:</p>

<p>Sir Geoffrey, riding Londonwards, from his home near Guildford,
one evening in late March, had been held up on Wandsworth Common by
a cloaked figure on a huge grey mare. The failing light had gleamed
from the barrel of a pistol, and the highwayman's tone had been one
that asked no arguments, admitted of no compromise. But Sir
Geoffrey in the course of his blustering career had become a useful
man of his hands. One blow of his heavy riding-crop had knocked
aside the highwayman's pistol, another had knocked in the
highwayman's head and tumbled him headlong from his saddle.</p>

<p>Sir Geoffrey was master of the situation, and, mightily pleased
by it, he bethought him of the spoils of war, which were his by
right of conquest. Without a qualm&mdash;nay, with a laugh and the
lilt of a song on his lips&mdash;Sir Geoffrey had dragged the
stricken tobyman into the shelter of a clump of trees, and
exchanged his own spavined horse for the fellow's splendid mare, on
which he had blithely pursued his road.</p>

<p>But before he had gone a couple of miles he had caught the
sounds of a numerous party galloping behind and rapidly gaining on
him. Now Sir Geoffrey's conscience&mdash;if so be he owned
one&mdash;was at rest. He had done no wrong, leastways no wrong
that should make him fear the law, and so he rode easily, never
thinking of attempting to outdistance the party which came on
behind&mdash;a thing he might easily have done had he been so
inclined, bravely mounted as he was.</p>

<p>So the others came on, hailed him, and when he paused to ask
them what they craved, came up with and surrounded him.</p>

<p>'We have you this time, "Scudding Tom,"' they cried, and fell to
ill-using him, pulling him down from his horse, and bestowing upon
him epithets for which he was utterly at a loss to account. But he
was not a patient man. He had been assaulted, and it was a thing he
would not suffer, although, as he plainly saw, they were sheriff's
men that had set upon him. So he blithely laid about him, and
contrived to crack a couple of heads before they had bound him and
flung him, helpless, down upon the road, livid, blasphemant, and
vastly furious.</p>

<p>A stout rubicund gentleman, in black with silver lace, who had
stood well apart whilst the fighting had been in train, came
forward now, swelling to bursting point with his own importance,
and denounced Sir Geoffrey for the tobyman who had robbed him an
hour ago. He was, he said, Sir Henry Talbury of Hurlingston, in the
County of Kent, one of his Majesty's Justices of the Peace. He had
been to collect certain sums of money in London, and was returning
with a leather bag containing a hundred guineas, of which this
ruffian had relieved him.</p>

<p>Sir Geoffrey heard him, and having heard him realized the
situation, spat from his mouth the filthy rags with which he had
been gagged, and spoke&mdash;</p>

<p>'You pot-bodied fool,' said he, for he had a rare virulence of
tongue upon occasion. 'You gross, beer-fattened hodman, let me free
of these bonds, and get you back to your pigs at Hurlingston ere I
have you flayed for this business. I am Sir Geoffrey Swayne, of
Guildford, as you shall learn more fully to your bitter
sorrow.'</p>

<p>The little man's fat face lost some of its plethoric colour, but
it was in rage that he paled, and not in any fear that Sir
Geoffrey&mdash;being tightly bound and helpless&mdash;might inspire
him.</p>

<p>'Are ye so, indeed,' he snapped, and his little eyes looked evil
as a rat's. 'I have heard of ye, for a gaming, dissolute
scoundrel.'</p>

<p>'Oh 'sblood!' panted Sir Geoffrey, writhing in his bonds. 'You
shall be spitted for this, like the Christmas goose you are.'</p>

<p>'And so, 'tis to highway robbery that your debaucheries have
brought ye?' The little man sniffed contemptuously. 'I'm nowise
surprised, and ye shall hang as a warning to other
scapegraces.'</p>

<p>And hang he did as Sir Henry promised him. Under the flap of his
saddle they had found a bag with Sir Henry Talbury's name upon it
and the hundred guineas he had mentioned contained in it. It was in
vain that Sir Geoffrey told the true story of his meeting with the
tobyman, thus explaining how he had come by the grey
mare&mdash;which had proved his undoing, for it was the mare, not
the man, that had been recognized. The fellow who rode that great,
grey beast was known to the countryside as 'Scudding Tom', and
nothing more, his identity never having been revealed. The court,
whilst praising his ingenuity, laughed at his tale. They realized
that he was Sir Geoffrey Swayne&mdash;he had brought a regiment of
witnesses to swear it&mdash;but they were no less satisfied that
Sir Geoffrey and 'Scudding Tom' were one and the same person. It
sorted well with his general reputation, and besides Sir Henry
swore to him as being the man who had robbed him, and whether he
swore in good faith or out of revenge for the things Sir Geoffrey
had said to him when he was overpowered, it might be difficult to
say.</p>

<p>But Sir Geoffrey was hanged, and the world was done with him,
although Sir Geoffrey was nowise done with the world, as you shall
hear. His lands&mdash;or what was left of them out of all that he
had gamed away&mdash;were forfeit to the Crown, and his widow stood
thus in peril of destitution. Not even his handsome body did they
leave. For when it was cut down, still warm, from the gallows, it
was sold to Dr. Blizzard, a ready purchaser of such commodities for
dissecting purposes.</p>

<p>But the old doctor had bought more than he knew of this time,
for upon the insertion of the knife into one of Sir Geoffrey's
legs&mdash;the point at which the doctor had elected to start his
work&mdash;Sir Geoffrey had suddenly sat upright on the slate
table, stretching his limbs, and letting forth a volley of
blood-curdling imprecations, which all but slew the doctor by the
fright they gave him.</p>

<p>Then, memory of past events returning to his wakening mind, the
rake had checked himself, blenched a little and looked awesomely
about him. The doctor, quivering in every nerve, his teeth rattling
in his head, vainly sought to crush himself behind a tallboy, to
protect himself from the material, and pattered long-forgotten
prayers to heaven for protection against the immaterial&mdash;for,
scientist though Dr. Blizzard was, he could not here discriminate
with which he might have to do.</p>

<p>'Rat me!' spluttered Sir Geoffrey, still looking about him, 'and
is this hades?' He shivered, for he was naked. 'It is colder than I
would have credited from what they told me,' said he. He caught
sight of the doctor's scared, grey face, horn-rimmed spectacles,
and wig gone rakishly awry in the efforts the man made to conceal
himself.</p>

<p>'Faith!' he pursued with a chuckle, 'but it's a place of
surprises. You've a monstrous mild look, sir, for
Satan&mdash;neither tail, nor cloven hoof, nor pitchfork? Gad's my
life! but you're a disappointment.'</p>

<p>He swung himself down from the table, and found his limbs so
cramped that he howled a second in pain.</p>

<p>At last, perceiving what manner of resurrection was this, the
doctor took heart and came forward. 'God 'a mercy!' said he, 'I've
heard of such things, but I'd never have believed it.'</p>

<p>'You've an odd turn of speech, old Lucifer. Are you a devil, or
are you not?'</p>

<p>'I'm no devil,' the doctor answered testily.</p>

<p>'Then who the devil are you?'</p>

<p>'Man, you were hanged at Tyburn this morning,' quoth the doctor
a trifle irrelevantly.</p>

<p>'Was I so? Egad! I was coming to think that I had dreamed
it.'</p>

<p>'Oh, it was no dream. You were hanged. You are Sir Geoffrey
Swayne.'</p>

<p>'Then I'm in hades, after all. But of your pity lend me a cloak,
for it seems I'm more in danger of being frozen here than
burned.'</p>

<p>The doctor gave him the garment he craved, and explained the
situation. Sir Geoffrey was incredulous. The doctor heaped up
arguments, cited precedents.</p>

<p>'It is recorded,' he said, 'of a woman, in the reign of Edward
III, regaining consciousness after having hanged for
four-and-twenty hours, and of another woman at Oxford a hundred
years ago who came to life again after having hanged for
half-an-hour, besides other instances I've read of, yet discredited
until now.'</p>

<p>The doctor was waxing excited, and Sir Geoffrey had much ado to
restrain him from running out to tell all London of this
resurrection.</p>

<p>'I'm dead,' he told the doctor, with a grin, 'and dead you'll
leave me, or, by heaven, it's dead you'll be yourself. I was
hanged, and there's an end to it&mdash;leastways until I've had a
talk with that Kentish lout they call Sir Henry Talbury.'</p>

<p>He told the doctor the true circumstances of his case, and he so
succeeded in convincing him of the truth of it that the old man was
won over to befriend him, and put him in the way of having justice
done him after all. But that night Sir Geoffrey sickened of a
fever, and was forced to keep his bed some days, so that a week had
passed before he was able to leave the doctor's house, and make his
way to Hurlingston.</p>

<p>Blizzard lent him ten guineas and made him a present of a suit
of black Camlett, a hat, and a brown <em>roquelaure</em>, his own
clothes having been reduced to rags by the violence that had
attended his arrest. Thus equipped, Sir Geoffrey arrived at
Maidstone at six o'clock in the evening of the first Monday in
April. From Maidstone to Hurlingston was a distance of some four
miles, which Sir Geoffrey covered afoot, reaching Hurlingston Manor
as dusk was falling.</p>

<p>He stepped briskly up the long white drive that wound its way
between regiments of trees, to the clearing that fronted the grey,
severely architected house. From long French windows to the left a
shaft of light, emerging through half-drawn curtains, fell with a
golden glow upon the lawn. One half of the window itself stood
open, for it had been warm as a day of summer. Sir Geoffrey paused,
and his eyes roved towards that glowing aperture. He hesitated in
his original intention of boldly asking for Sir Henry. He turned
aside, and still pondering, he drifted rather than walked, until he
was in line with the opening, and able to look into the room. A
second he stared with dilated eyes, then with a sharp indrawing of
breath he sped forward, nor stopped until he was crouching at the
window, peering into the room.</p>

<p>Within sat the Justice of the Peace, like a toad with its legs
wide, and his wig on his knee. He was sucking contentedly at a
long-stemmed pipe, and at his elbow was a decanter and a
half-filled glass of sparkling yellow wine. His huge dome-like head
shone in the light of a pair of candles that stood in their massive
silver sticks on either side of the papers spread out in front of
him.</p>

<p>Before him stood a woman all in black&mdash;a tall,
nobly-proportioned woman, with a high nose and a handsome,
high-bred face. She was speaking, and her fine eyes were full of
supplication. Sir Geoffrey drew nigh and listened as he deemed he
had the right to, for the woman was Lady Swayne.</p>

<p>'Sir,' she was saying, 'of your charity I do implore you again
that you investigate this matter, and as sure as you're sitting
there you shall discover that Sir Geoffrey was no robber, whatever
may have been his sins. Sir Henry, you have made a widow of me. Do
not make me a beggar also. I ask for justice&mdash;tardy
justice&mdash;that my husband's estates be not confiscated from
me.'</p>

<p>Sir Henry withdrew his pipe from his gross lips.</p>

<p>'Madam,' said he, 'your husband was found guilty by judge and
jury. He was "Scudding Tom," the highwayman&mdash;there's never a
doubt of it.'</p>

<p>The curtain rings rang harshly on the ensuing silence. The woman
turned her head and screamed; the man looked up and gasped for
breath. His face blenched, the pipe dropped from his nerveless
fingers and broke into a dozen fragments on the floor; for there,
between the dark green curtains, the lamplight falling full upon
his face, which gleamed a ghostly white against the black
background of the night, stood the wraith of Sir Geoffrey
Swayne.</p>

<p>He stood there, enjoying the sensation his advent had created, a
sardonic grin on his white face, a glitter mighty evil in his bold,
black eyes.</p>

<p>The woman was the first to gather sufficient courage to address
the apparition. Sir Henry had a desire to crawl under the table,
and if he did not indulge it, it was because his limbs, palsied
with fright, refused their office.</p>

<p>'Is that you, Geoffrey?' the woman whispered hoarsely, craning
forward, her face white to the lips. 'Speak!'</p>

<p>And then a cunning notion shot through Sir Geoffrey's subtle
mind. Of what avail to protest his innocence? What proofs had he? A
judge and jury had found him guilty; the thing was done with. He
must play a subtle game if he would retrieve his lands from
confiscation, and the nature of it was at once apparent to him.</p>

<p>He stepped airily forward a pace or two, and the curtains fell
together behind him with a shudder.</p>

<p>'My name, madam, is not Geoffrey. It is Jack&mdash;Jack Haynes,
better known to the vulgar as "Scudding Tom," gentleman of the
road. Your servant, madam, and yours, sir.' He made a leg first to
the lady, and then to the knight.</p>

<p>Sir Henry's colour was returning. It came back in a flood until
it seemed as if he were doomed to apoplexy. A grunt escaped him. He
sought words in which to utter his amazement, his perplexity and
his dawning dismay. But the woman was beforehand with him. She had
stared a moment at her husband in unbelief. Then, as if
convinced&mdash;and well she might be, knowing Sir Geoffrey
hanged&mdash;she swung round upon Sir Henry, her arm dramatically
outstretched.</p>

<p>'You have heard him, Sir Henry,' she cried. 'You have heard what
he says. Will you believe me now, when I tell you again that you
were mistaken? Here is the proof I needed. Will you do me justice
now?'</p>

<p>'Wait, madam,' growled the knight. Then to the man: 'What brings
you here?' he demanded.</p>

<p>'I am tardily come, sir,' answered the other, 'but I could not
come before. I&mdash;I was detained. Yet am I here now, and, it
seems, still in time to do some good. I am come to tell you that it
was I who robbed you of your hundred guineas, and not Sir Geoffrey
Swayne, whom you have hanged for the deed. 'Tis said that I
resemble him, and indeed it must be so since you swore to him as
being the man who robbed you. 'Twas an unlucky thing for him that
when I held him up he should have knocked me from my mare and
bestridden her himself, for the mare was well known&mdash;and
belike 'twas the mare convinced men so easily that he was "Scudding
Tom". So much for the ways of justice!'</p>

<p>Sir Henry stared at him with fallen jaw, and his thoughts were
far from pleasant. This fellow was indeed the very image of Sir
Geoffrey, so like in figure, feature and in voice, that neither he
nor the man's own wife could have sworn that he was not Sir
Geoffrey himself, but for the unquestionable fact that Sir Geoffrey
was hanged a week ago. The sight of that incredible likeness
convinced him of the error there had been. The man he hanged was
the very counterpart of this one. Small blame to him, then, for
having sworn away the other's life. Yet a sudden choler stirred the
fat old knight, as much against himself for the life he had sworn
away, as against this fellow for having been the cause of it.</p>

<p>He heaved himself to his feet, acting upon a sudden impulse. His
neglected wig tumbled from his knee and lay on the ground beside
the pieces of his shattered pipe, whilst its owner lurched across
the room in the direction of the bell-rope.</p>

<p>'Whither away, Sir Henry?' came Sir Geoffrey's voice suavely;
and, moved to look over his shoulder, the knight's progress was
arrested, and his heavy underlip shuddered in affright against his
teeth, for he was staring into a levelled pistol. 'I have not
walked into the lion's maw without precautions, sir,' said he.
'I'll trouble you to sit.'</p>

<p>But the woman, who had been considering him with scrutinizing
eyes, raised a hand and waved it imperiously to Sir Henry.</p>

<p>'Ring the bell, sir,' she bade him briskly.</p>

<p>'Madam,' smiled Sir Geoffrey, 'be not harsh with me. Besides,
upon what charge would you have me taken?'</p>

<p>'Upon the charge of highway robbery,' thundered the knight.
Nevertheless he sat down, as he was bidden. 'By your own
confession, it was you who robbed me on Streatham Hill.'</p>

<p>'Bloodthirsty tyke,' returned the other. 'Have you not hanged
one man already for that deed? Gads, my life, sir, you may not hang
two men in England for one man's offence.'</p>

<p>Sir Henry considered him a moment, writhing under the insolence
of the fellow's tone. 'Your resemblance to the late Sir Geoffrey is
very thorough,' said he drily. 'It is little blame to me for my
mistake. But if we have hanged one man for your robbery of me, yet
there are counts enough besides, against you on which to hang you
as well.'</p>

<p>'Maybe; but you'll drop the subject, or there'll be one count
more&mdash;the death of Sir Henry Talbury.'</p>

<p>His lips smiled, but his tone was resolute, his eyes alert. Sir
Henry, finding the subject as little to his own taste as it was
objectionable to his visitor, dropped it there and then. Sir
Geoffrey crossed to the door and turned the key.</p>

<p>'Sir,' said he, 'and you, madam&mdash;for Sir Geoffrey I am
sorry, though the world has it he was a nasty rogue. But I am here
to prove that, at least, he was not the thing for which they hanged
him. He was no robber. Restitution must be made to his widow. I
have his death upon my conscience. I'll not have more.'</p>

<p>'Why, there we are at one,' Sir Henry agreed. 'Since I have seen
and heard you, it is my wish, no less than yours, that Lady Swayne
should not suffer more than already she has done. Will you
depose?'</p>

<p>'Let me have pen, ink and paper, and it shall be done at
once.'</p>

<p>Sir Henry supplied his needs, and Sir Geoffrey sat down to
write.</p>

<p>'You'll be so good as to sit there&mdash;as far from the bell as
the width of the room will allow,' he bade the knight. 'Make an
attempt to have me apprehended, and I shall take a look at the
colour of your brains&mdash;if so be you have any.'</p>

<p>'Damme, you knave&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Peace, sir. Do you not see that I write?'</p>

<p>They left him to it, Sir Henry and Lady Swayne sitting silently
in his presence, whilst his quill scratched its way across a sheet
of paper, his pistol beside him on the table ready to his hand.</p>

<p>At last the confession that should save Sir Geoffrey's lands,
now that it could no longer save his life, was accomplished. When
it was done, he rose and went to ring the bell, then admitted the
servant who answered the summons, and relocked the door when he was
inside. In the presence of the magistrate, the lady, and the
lackey, he swore to and signed his depositions, and they appended
their signatures as witnesses. He emptied the sand-box over it,
and, bowing to them, his bearing grave, his lips mocking, he strode
off in the direction of the window by which he had entered. He
paused, his hand upon the curtains, and looked back over his
shoulder.</p>

<p>'Lady Swayne,' said he, 'I have done you some service this
night. Let your gratitude see to it that I may go my ways without
fear of pursuit.'</p>

<p>She nodded her assurance. His roving eye smiled a moment on the
knight.</p>

<p>'Good-night, old beer-barrel,' said he, and so leapt out into
the darkness, and was gone.</p>

<p>Lady Swayne shivered a little, and, moving to the table, took up
the paper he had written and studied it a while. The bewildered
lackey unlocked the door and departed at a curt nod from his
master. A thin smile parted the lips of the woman, it was almost as
a faint reflection of the smile that had haunted Sir Geoffrey's
face.</p>

<p>'Madam,' said Sir Henry, with a rough attempt either at seeking
or at giving consolation, 'you'll bear me no deep ill-will for my
error. I deplore it grievously. I shall ne'er forgive myself. And
yet, madam, the estates shall remain yours&mdash;have no doubt of
that; and if all they say be true, belike you'll enjoy them better
alone than in Sir Geoffrey's company. He was no over-pleasant mate
for any woman; a bullying, drunken, wife-beating scoundrel,
who&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Sir,' she broke in, 'he was my husband. Will you be so good as
to ring? I'll be departing now.'</p>

<p>It was a week before Sir Geoffrey found his way home to
Guildford. He had tarried by the way until the last of Dr
Blizzard's guineas was exhausted. One night, at last, he strode, as
bold and debonair as ever, across the threshold of his home and
bade a servant, who was new to him, to conduct him at once to Lady
Swayne.</p>

<p>He stood in his wife's presence, the door closed; they two
alone.</p>

<p>'Helen, my girl,' he cried&mdash;for on occasions he could be a
very lover to the wife he had so often beaten&mdash;'you played
your part bravely at Hurlingston. It is as much to you, sweetheart,
as to myself that I owe this re-unition. I'm with you again, my
girl; and if I may not safely live in England, we'll sell the old
home and begin life anew in a new world.'</p>

<p>She let him say no more. She had risen, and was regarding him
from under knitted brows, her lips compressed, her bosom heaving
under its black satin bodice.</p>

<p>'Mr. Haynes,' said she, at last, 'have your wits deserted
you?'</p>

<p>His jaw fell, the boldness left his air and glance. 'God 'a
mercy!' he gasped. 'Were you deluded too, then? Did you not
recognize me? Helen, I am Geoffrey Swayne.'</p>

<p>'Go tell it to fools, man,' said she. 'Geoffrey Swayne was
hanged at Tyburn, as all the world knows.'</p>

<p>'Aye, hanged was I, and yet I came to life again.'</p>

<p>'A likely story&mdash;such things are common happenings,' she
smiled ironically.</p>

<p>He took a step forward, his brow black as thunder now. 'Madam,'
he snarled, 'you are fooling me. You know me, yet will not own to
me. Saw you not the writing of my depositions? Knew you not the
hand? And if that were not enough to convince you, look you on
this.' He thrust back the hair from his brow, revealing a long
livid scar above the temple. But the sight of that identifying mark
left her unmoved.</p>

<p>'Sir Geoffrey had just such another scar,' said she quietly. 'He
came by it in this very room, one night when he was drunk. He had
raised his whip to strike me, but lost his balance and fell,
cracking his head against that hand-iron. Aye, your likeness to Sir
Geoffrey is very amazing, yet are you not Sir Geoffrey,' she
continued. 'You are Mr Haynes, known to the vulgar as "Scudding
Tom", gentleman of the road, against whom there remains sufficient
to hang you. Bear you that in mind,' she added impressively, 'nor
push me too far, lest I forget my gratitude.'</p>

<p>He was upon her like a panther. He caught her wrist until it
seemed he must snap it, all the blackguard in him risen like scum
to the surface of his vile nature.</p>

<p>'Madam, you shall be whipped,' he promised her through his
teeth. But the bell-rope was within her reach. Too late he sought
to drag her from it. She had caught it in her free hand, and his
dragging her sent a clanging peal reverberating through the
house.</p>

<p>He let her go, and fell back quivering with rage, his face
ashen. She recovered, and spoke coldly to him.</p>

<p>'Mr Haynes,' said she, 'I will forgive you this out of
consideration for the service you have rendered me. I will even do
more. You spoke just now of seeking your fortune in the New World.
I counsel you to follow so excellent an intention. In England you
go hourly in danger of capture, and "Scudding Tom" will
unquestionably hang if he be taken.'</p>

<p>The door opened, and a servant stood before her. She bade him
wait outside until she summoned him again. Then, to her husband,
she continued:</p>

<p>'So follow my advice, and get you to America, as you proposed.
In return for the service you did me by your depositions, I'll pay
you half-yearly the sum of fifty pounds for life, so long as you
remain out of England; and here you have your first six months'
pension, which will enable you to get you beyond seas. Go now, and
God be with you, and lead you into better ways of life. You have
widowed me by your evil courses, and a widow I'm like to remain.'
Her tone was full of a meaning he did not miss. He stared a moment,
then his eyes moved to the roll of notes on the table before him,
where she had placed them.</p>

<p>Fury had failed him; he sought to cajole.</p>

<p>'Helen, my girl,' he began. But the heart of the too-often
beaten wife had been broken overlong ago to be still sensible to
prayers of his.</p>

<p>'Robert!' she called, raising her voice, and instantly the
servant reappeared. 'You will re-conduct this gentleman, and lend
him a horse to ride to Bristol. Give you good-night, sir.'</p>

<p>With distorted features, Geoffrey Swayne turned to fling out of
the room. But she called him back. 'You've forgotten something,'
said she, and she pointed to the notes upon the table. A moment he
looked at her almost furtively, a suggestion of crouching in his
attitude, something akin to that of a hound that had been whipped.
Then he took the notes and thrust them into his pocket.</p>

<p>In silence he went out of the room, and so out of her life.</p>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>THE BARGAIN</h2>

<h3><i>The Storyteller</i>, July 1908</h3>

<p>Mr Hawkesby stirred in his great chair and, half awake, opened
his eyes to blink at the fiery reflection of the evening sun, which
glared at him from the glass of his tall, well-furnished bookcase.
Incuriously he looked round to see what had disturbed his slumbers,
then he leapt wideawake to his feet, so violently that a little
shower of powder rained from his carefully dressed hair to settle
upon the neck and shoulders of his velvet coat.</p>

<p>Leaning against the solid mahogany table, midway between the
open window and the chair in which Mr Hawkesby had rested, stood a
man, a stranger, in a suit of homespun the worse for wear, ragged
stockings, and a pair of silver-buckled shoes all spattered with
mud and dirt. Hawkesby's face paled, for nature had not made him
overvaliant. His first thought was that he had to do with a
thief&mdash;and a thief who knew what he was about, for in the
handsome, inlaid secretaire yonder reposed a bag containing three
hundred guineas&mdash;rents collected that morning by Mr Hawkesby's
bailiff.</p>

<p>The stranger raised a hand in a mild gesture of
supplication.</p>

<p>'I beg that you'll not be alarmed,' said he, his manner that of
a gentleman. 'I'm no robber. You'll be Mr Hawkesby?'</p>

<p>'I am,' answered the man of the house, his voice sharp. 'How
came you here?'</p>

<p>The stranger waved a white, slender hand, a hand at odd variance
with his clothes, in the direction of the open window and the
blossom-laden trees of the orchard beyond. 'That way,' he said.</p>

<p>'Oh, that way?' Mr Hawkesby mimicked him; for, seeing him so
tame, his own courage was returning fast. 'And what may you be
wanting with me, my man?'</p>

<p>The other left his position by the table, and took a step
towards the young squire. Mr Hawkesby retreated towards the
bell-rope.</p>

<p>'Keep your distance, my man,' said he, his tone less
arrogant.</p>

<p>'Don't ring, Mr Hawkesby!' cried the other in a tone of such
sudden alarm that Hawkesby paused, his fingers on the rope. 'I've
come to ye for shelter. 'Tis a hunted man I am this day.'</p>

<p>'You're glib enough with my name,' said Hawkesby. 'What may
yours be?'</p>

<p>'Look me in the face, sor, an' ye'll never need to ask,'
answered the other with a smile that was between sorrow and
jauntiness. Hawkesby looked as he was bidden, and he saw that the
man wore his own hair, black as coal and tied in a queue, from
which a few escaping strands had matted themselves about his brow.
It was a fine, distinguished countenance, but Hawkesby was not
aware that his eyes had ever encountered it before. He said so, and
a whimsical smile lifted the corners of the intruder's close-lipped
mouth.</p>

<p>'Black hair, black eyes,' he recited, 'arched eyebrows, hooked
nose, thin lips, sallow complexion, a mole on the right of the
chin, and a scar over the right temple'&mdash;he pushed back his
matted hair, and showed a milk-white line&mdash;'stands five foot
ten, and is of a slender shape. Have ye read that description
nowhere of late, Mr Hawkesby?'</p>

<p>Hawkesby fell back a pace.</p>

<p>'Egad!' he exclaimed, and then again, 'Egad!'</p>

<p>'Just so,' said the Irishman, with a shrug.</p>

<p>'Then you're&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Miles O'Neill, your most obedient, Mr Hawkesby,' said the
Irishman, making a leg.</p>

<p>In a quiver of apprehension, not of the man but of the things
that might result from the man's presence, Hawkesby now approached
his visitor.</p>

<p>'In Heaven's name, why are you here, Mr O'Neil?' quoth he, and
his face was pale, his blue eyes wide with horror.</p>

<p>'I lay at Appleby last night&mdash;at Mr Robertson's,' said the
fugitive. 'He tould me that should I need shelter farther south,
I'd find it at your hands. I was for rachin' Lancashire, and I'd
niver have throubled ye, but that from Orton hither I have been
followed.'</p>

<p>'Followed?' cried Hawkesby in alarm. 'Followed hither? And by
whom?'</p>

<p>'By a dhirty rogue who caught a glimpse of me as I was lavin'
Orton. Shure, an' he dodged me footsteps ivery moile of the foive.
Half a moile from here I led him through a confusion of lanes, and
lost him. Glory be to God! There's a thousand guineas on my head,
but the earning of them'll not be his, the dhirty shpy.'</p>

<p>'How knew you this to be my house? How knew you me?'</p>

<p>'More by luck than controivance, faith! I was hidin' in the
orchard there, and seein' a window convaniently open, I bethought
me that beloike I'd find closer hiding-room within doors. By your
coat-of-arms over the fireplace yonder I saw that I'd found luck
for the first toime since I joined the Prince's banner.'</p>

<p>Hawkesby looked at him out of eyes that did not exactly beam
with welcome. He had contrived to keep the Tories in ignorance of
his connection with the Cause, for all that it might be a matter of
common knowledge in the ranks of Charlie Stuart's followers. His
had been but a half-hearted devotion, for he was by no means a man
of rash impulse. His head governed his heart always; it governed it
now, and he misliked the risk he might be running in harbouring
this notorious rebel.</p>

<p>Still, the man before him looked in sore need of aid. His face
was pale, and there were black lines beneath his eyes that lent
them a haggard look. In what sorry condition were his garments we
have already seen. Yet he bore himself with a certain jauntiness;
when he spoke of being hunted he did so with a devil-may-care
manner that should have earned him sympathy from a stone image.
Hawkesby was not altogether insensible to this, and he felt, too,
that he would be for ever shamed did he turn this fugitive out of
doors without more ado. So, however reluctant he may have been at
heart, outwardly at least he made a decent show of befriending
O'Neill. He invited him to rest in the great easy-chair, whilst he
went in quest of food and wine.</p>

<p>'For, I take it, you'll welcome refreshment, Mr O'Neill,' said
he.</p>

<p>'It's little enough of it I've had since the shlaughter at
Culloden,' laughed the Irishman as he dropped into the great chair
and stretched his dusty legs luxuriously.</p>

<p>Hawkesby fetched him some cold pigeon-pie, a loaf, and a flask
of French wine, and, setting the things before him on a small
table, he bade his visitor fall to. O'Neill did so with a will, and
when he had eaten he turned a scornful eye upon the slender,
lily-shaped glass his host had set before him.</p>

<p>'Have ye no such thing as a bumper, now, about the house, Mr
Hawkesby?' quoth he. 'There's a health I'd be after dhrinkin' with
all me heart.'</p>

<p>Hawkesby rose with a shrug of impatience to fetch the thing his
guest craved. O'Neill filled it to the brim, and emptied it twice
in brisk succession&mdash;thereby exhausting the flask. He drank
first to Mr Hawkesby's long life, and next to the Duke of
Cumberland's short shrift. Hawkesby fetched more wine&mdash;a brace
of flasks this time. The rebel's eyes sparkled at sight of
them.</p>

<p>"Tis a power of dust gets in your throat a-walkin',' said he.
'Aye, an' the weather's hot an' all. Here's long loife to ye agin,
Mr Hawkesby.' And again was a bumper poured down that amazing
gullet. 'Ye're not drinkin' yerself,' he expostulated, making
himself mightily at home.</p>

<p>'If you'll pardon me,' said the other stiffly, 'it is not my
habit of an afternoon.'</p>

<p>'By me sowl, ye should acquire it, thin,' was the laughing
answer, and O'Neill emptied the second flagon into his tall glass.
'Ye're missin' a power of loife!'</p>

<p>Hawkesby sat himself on the arm of a chair, and craved news of
the Prince.</p>

<p>'Where left you his Highness?' quoth he. 'Is he still in the
heather, know you, or has he contrived to ship for France?'</p>

<p>But the question did no more than suggest a fresh toast to the
rebel. He raised his glass to the light, and eyed the blood-red
colour of the wine with a fond glance.</p>

<p>'Here's a health to his Hoighness, where'er he may be!' He
drained his bumper. '<em>Super naculum!</em>', he laughed, as he
turned it up, and made a bead on his thumbnail.</p>

<p>'You've a fine thirst, sir,' said Hawkesby a trifle tartly.</p>

<p>'An' it's yourself would have the same, bedad, if ye'd run with
the Scots from Culloden. But it's an iligant wine,' he added
politely as a further reason.</p>

<p>'The battle should never have been delivered as it was,' said
Hawkesby, who, like many another, could criticize what he could
never have had a hand in doing. 'The Prince should have fallen back
behind Nairn Water.'</p>

<p>'Maybe,' quoth the Irishman pensively. 'But ye'll allow it's an
ill thing to fall back on water or behind it.' And he reached for
the wine, to add point to his meaning. 'I'll give ye the sow's tail
to Geordie!' said he, and with that the flagon was emptied.</p>

<p>Hawkesby affected not to notice that again the wine was done,
lest hospitality should force him to fetch more. A gallon of good
French claret should be, he thought, enough for any man; and
Hawkesby was careful by nature to the point of stinginess. Once
more he sought to draw his guest into talking of the Cause, and he
did so with moderate success for a little while. But presently
O'Neill sank back in his chair and fetched a sigh.</p>

<p>'Shure, talkin's dhry work,' said he, and he held a flask to the
light to make certain it was empty.</p>

<p>The hint was over-broad to be ignored. Hawkesby fetched another
brace of bottles from his cellar, swearing to himself, however,
that they should be the last. He was beginning to dislike his guest
exceedingly. There were more toasts when he returned. If O'Neill
had been half the fighter that he was the drinker, surely the side
he fought for should have been victorious at Culloden. He pledged
all manner of men and all manner of events; it was 'long loife' to
this, and 'bad cess' to that, until his last bumper stood before
him and he appeared at a loss for a subject. Indeed, there was by
then an ominous flush to his cheek and a sparkle in his eye that
had not been there when first he had clambered into Mr Hawkesby's
room.</p>

<p>Hawkesby began mightily to fear for him now&mdash;and more for
himself. Here was a plight! The man was a rebel with a thousand
guineas on his head; he had been recognized and followed from Orton
to this neighbourhood. What if he were to become too drunk to move,
and so were to be found in Mr Hawkesby's house? He began to
expostulate with his guest. He spoke of caution, and as politely as
he could he suggested to O'Neill that there was danger for him in
drinking as he was doing. He went so far even as to seek to remove
the last bumper. But O'Neill's hands shot out at that sign of
danger, and his fingers encircled the glass in a resolute
clutch.</p>

<p>'Bedad!' he hiccoughed. 'The man was hanged that left his dhrink
behind him.'</p>

<p>'I'm thinking, sir, that should the same fate overtake you it
will not be from the same cause,' was Hawkesby's irritable answer.
But the Irishman was not to be offended. He emptied his glass, and
got unsteadily to his feet. His wits were surely all soaked in wine
by now, for he waved his hand in the air and broke suddenly into
song.</p>

<p class="poem">It's Geordie he came up to town,<br>
Wi' a bunch o' turnips in his crown;<br>
Aha, quo' she, I'll pull them down,<br>
And turn my tail to Geordie!</p>

<p>'For Heaven's sake, sir!' gasped Hawkesby, in very real
affright; 'You'll have the house about my ears. Silence, man, if
you value your life at a farthing! Are you not afraid?'</p>

<p>'Afraid?' roared O'Neill; and it almost seemed for a moment that
he was offended. Then he laughed aloud and long, and for an answer
broke into another Jacobite ditty&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">O that's the thing that ne'er can be,<br>
For the man's unborn that'll daunton me!<br>
O set me once&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Abruptly his song ceased. His mouth remained opened&mdash;nay,
fell wider&mdash;and his eyes stared with a sudden look of horror
past his host at the window to which Hawkesby had his back. With a
premonition of what was afoot, Hawkesby swung round, then stood,
his face livid, scarce breathing in his affright.</p>

<p>Leaning on the sill of the open window was a man of swarthy
complexion, whose face was rendered villainous now by the leering
grin with which he surveyed the room's occupants.</p>

<p>A three-cornered hat was set rakishly upon his loose, untidy
hair, and he wore a scarlet riding-coat of velvet, very soiled and
frayed, with tarnished gold lace and dirty, torn ruffles. Seeing
himself observed, he waited for no invitation to enter, but set his
hands upon the sill and vaulted lightly into the room. He was a
tall, powerfully built man, and he flourished a long, gleaming
pistol.</p>

<p>'Mr Hawkesby, your servant, sir,' he leered, with an ironical
bow. 'Mr O'Neill, your very humble servant.' And coolly stepping
aside he locked the door.</p>

<p>Hawkesby looked askance at O'Neill. The Irishman's knees had
been loosened, either from drink or from fright, and he had sunk
limply to a chair, where he sat staring foolishly at the
intruder.</p>

<p>'Bedad!' he muttered at last in a thick voice. 'Ye're as
persevering as a shpider. I t'ought I'd losht ye, me friend.' And
as he spoke his hand went fumbling towards the breast of his coat.
The bully's weapon came level with his brows.</p>

<p>'I'll trouble you to put that pistol on the table,' said he,
with a snarl; and O'Neill sheepishly relinquished the weapon he was
slyly drawing.</p>

<p>Hawkesby stepped to the bell. His was the courage of despair. He
braced himself, and&mdash;</p>

<p>'What do you want, my man?' he demanded, with pretended
firmness.</p>

<p>'Just your friend, O'Neill, yonder,' said the fellow, with a
grin. 'He's worth a thousand guineas to me.' Hawkesby laid a hand
on the bell-rope. 'Oh, ring away, Mr Hawkesby; ring away!' the
ruffian airily encouraged him. 'Fetch in your servants; fetch in
the whole town to see how you shelter and befriend a rebel.'</p>

<p>Hawkesby's hand fell back to his side. The affair looked ugly.
He turned to O'Neill to see how the rebel took matters, hoping in
his heart that the fellow would surrender before more harm was
done. But O'Neill made no shift to move. Instead, he was settling
himself more comfortably in his chair. He eyed the spy with a
from-head-to-foot glance of contempt.</p>

<p>'An' who the dickens may you be, me man?' quoth he.</p>

<p>'I'm a loyal subject of King George's.'</p>

<p>'Bedad, ye look it, sor,' answered O'Neill, as bold as brass;
'ye look it; and ye look, too&mdash;if one may judge by
externals&mdash;as if there moight be a price on your own dhirty
head.'</p>

<p>Hawkesby, watching the bully, saw the shot strike home. The
fellow's eyes dropped uneasily, he shuffled where he stood, and
there was a pause before he answered, still truculent, but with
half the assurance gone out of him:</p>

<p>'You'll be leaving my affairs alone, and you'll be treating me
respectfully. The constable'll be none too inquisitive if I hand
over to him the notorious Mr O'Neill.'</p>

<p>'Maybe; but Mr O'Neill'll be after arousin' the constable's
inquisitiveness,' said the rebel, with an ugly look. It was plain
he saw the weak spot in his opponent's hide. Hawkesby was thinking
briskly. An idea had come to him&mdash;an inspiration. He had
accounted himself lost, for the sheriff would want to know where
O'Neill had been captured, and the bully, not a doubt of it, would
inform him. He was cursing the hospitality he had extended to this
drunken fugitive; he had begrudged it when he saw how dear it was
like to cost him in wine; how much more, then, did miserly Mr
Hawkesby not begrudge it now that he saw how dear it was like to
cost him in good gold guineas?&mdash;for clearly this fellow must
be bought off. His voice, cold and precise, cut into the momentary
silence.</p>

<p>'It is quite clear,' said he to the spy, 'that you are in no
condition yourself to approach the constable. You'll need to go
before the sheriff, and there'll be awkward questions asked.'</p>

<p>'I'm no fool,' snapped the spy, 'and you'll not make me one.
They'll welcome me very cordially when I take them Mr O'Neill.
They'll not ask many questions&mdash;saving, perhaps, as to
whereabouts I came upon him. Why, if they had a grievance against
me&mdash;which I'm not saying that they have&mdash;this day's work
should earn me a pardon.'</p>

<p>'That's as it may be,' sneered O'Neill.</p>

<p>'Just so; but you'll not alter it with talking.'</p>

<p>'I might alter it with something else,' interpolated Hawkesby,
in a tone that drew the brisk attention of the others. 'Listen to
me, now. If you yield up Mr O'Neill, and even if no questions are
asked concerning yourself, the Government's a mighty slow
paymaster. You may wait a long time for your thousand guineas.'</p>

<p>'True,' the man confessed.</p>

<p>'Will you strike a bargain with me, now? What'll you take, money
down?'</p>

<p>The fellow looked up, licking his lips&mdash;it was a lick of
anticipation.</p>

<p>'You speak me very fair,' said he, his head on one side, his
glance shifting from one to the other of the men. 'I'll take five
hundred guineas for my bargain.'</p>

<p>'Don't listen to the thafe!' said O'Neill contemptuously.</p>

<p>'You shall have a hundred,' was Hawkesby's answer.</p>

<p>The man laughed scornfully. 'You're jesting,' said he. 'Come,
now; say four hundred, and Mr O'Neill may go his ways for me.'</p>

<p>'One hundred,' repeated Hawkesby doggedly. It was in all
conscience money enough to pay for having entertained O'Neill. More
he would not give, betide what might. But neither would the other
abate further. Seeing Hawkesby resolute:</p>

<p>'Come, Mr O'Neill,' said he at last, his pistol raised to enjoin
obedience, 'we had best be moving.'</p>

<p>'Aye,' said O'Neill gloomily, 'I'm thinkin' we had. I'm much
obliged to you, sor&mdash;&mdash;' he began, turning to Hawkesby.
But Hawkesby broke in excitedly:</p>

<p>'No, no! You must not go.'</p>

<p>'Well, well,' said the bully, 'you shall have him for three
hundred guineas. Now that's reasonable. He's worth a thousand to
any man. Three hundred guineas, money down, and he's yours.'</p>

<p>Hawkesby stood with his shoulders to the mantelshelf, his face
very white, his lips very tight. He must clear himself from this
position. His neck would certainly be stretched if O'Neill were
taken in his house. Yet, three hundred guineas was a deal of money!
And then the devil&mdash;or else something that the spy had
said&mdash;breathed a wicked suggestion into his miserly soul.</p>

<p>'Three hundred guineas is all that I have by me,' said he, in a
hard voice. 'Yet you shall have the money.' And thus the bargain
was concluded, and Hawkesby took a heavy bag from the secretaire,
where it was locked, and banged it on the table. The spy peered at
the yellow contents, weighed it appreciatively in his hands.</p>

<p>'I'll take your word for the amount,' said he, and with a
flourish of compliments he took his leave, and departed by the way
he had come. Hawkesby, meanwhile, turned a deaf ear to O'Neill's
warnings. At last, when the man had disappeared, the rebel leapt to
his feet. In his excitement he seemed completely sobered.</p>

<p>'Mr Hawkesby,' said he, 'I'm eternally your debtor. Yet forgive
me if I tell ye ye've done a mad thing.'</p>

<p>'How?' asked Hawkesby, his eyebrows going up and his hand toying
idly with the pistol O'Neill had placed on the table when the spy
had bidden him.</p>

<p>'In allowing that ruffian to depart with the money. You should
have kept him here till I was gone. It is odds he'll go fetch the
constable, and still seek to earn his thousand guineas.'</p>

<p>'Aye,' said Hawkesby, with a singular smile. 'It is odds he
will.'</p>

<p>'Then, bedad, give me the pishtol, and let me after him before
he's clear of the orchard.' And, making shift to go, O'Neill held
out his hand for the weapon. Instead, the muzzle was presented at
his head.</p>

<p>'Stand where you are, Mr O'Neill,' said Hawkesby, in a voice of
steel. There was no timidity about him now. He was safe and brave
behind his pistol. He backed across the room, the weapon levelled
at the rebel, who eyed him with fallen jaw. For the third time in
that afternoon Hawkesby's hand went to the bell-rope. This time his
fingers closed upon it, and peal after peal went reverberating
through the house.</p>

<p>'What are ye doin'?' gasped O'Neill.</p>

<p>Hawkesby showed his teeth in a ghastly smile, his face
livid.</p>

<p>'Mr O'Neill,' said he, and his voice was crisp and cold, 'if
that ruffian fetches the constable, he'll be too late. You heard
what he said. You are worth a thousand guineas to any man. You are
worth that sum to me. I've bought you, and I'm&mdash;going to sell
you again. I've driven a shrewd bargain in you.'</p>

<p>The rebel stared at him a moment, unbelief in his face. Then he
drew himself up, the last vestige of his drunkenness departed, and
a singular smile&mdash;a mocking, cynical, yet exultant,
smile&mdash;upon his hawk face.</p>

<p>'So that is your loyalty to the Cause; that your devotion to the
Prince?' said he. 'Bedad! If ever Charlie comes to his own he shall
hear of this. But since it's so&mdash;why I'm glad it's so. You are
mighty well served, Mr Judas Iscariot Hawkesby; three hundred
guineas is a mort of money to lose over any man.'</p>

<p>'It's hardly lost,' sneered Hawkesby. Then, as O'Neill moved to
the window, 'Stand, or I fire!' he shouted.</p>

<p>'Foire, and be hanged,' said O'Neill. And Hawkesby, angered and
desperately afraid of losing his prey, fired one barrel after the
other. But the only sound that broke the stillness of the room was
the click of the hammer on the empty pan and O'Neill's soft
contemptuous laugh. The pistol was not loaded.</p>

<p>There came a sound of feet, and a knocking at the door.</p>

<p>With a last laugh O'Neill dropped from the sill and sped through
the orchard like a hare, to vanish in the twilight. Hawkesby,
shaking in every limb with the fear that had come upon him born of
an awful thought that had arisen in his mind, sprang to open. In
flowed a stream of servants, and after them, walking briskly,
stained with dust, came Mr Robertson of Appleby. At sight of him,
Hawkesby checked the words that were on his lips. He caught his
visitor by the lapel of his coat and drew him aside. His habit of
caution was with him now, excited though he was.</p>

<p>'Did Miles O'Neill lie at your house last night?' he
whispered.</p>

<p>Robertson stared at him a moment. 'No,' said he at last; 'but it
is odd you should ask, for I came to tell you that Miles O'Neill
was taken last night at Penrith. I heard of it this morning.'</p>

<p>'I have been robbed!' screamed Hawkesby. 'Robbed of three
hundred guineas.'</p>

<p>They saw the disorder of the room, with its strewn flagons, and
they opined him drunk. By the time he had convinced them he was
sober it must have been too late, for his ingenious visitors were
never taken.</p>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>THE OPPORTUNIST</h2>

<h3>Premier Magazine, July 1920</h3>

<p>To follow the early career of Capoulade down its easy descent of
the slopes of turpitude were depressing and unprofitable. He had
reached the stage at which he pocketed his pride and&mdash;like the
adaptable opportunist that he was&mdash;passed from the artistic
plane of swindling to the clumsier methods of purse-cutting and
housebreaking. The pursuit of the latter brought him one night into
the domicile of Monsieur Louvel.</p>

<p>Old Louvel was a man of fortune and the owner of an unique
collection of old Italian jewels, and this was the lure that
attracted Capoulade. Did rumour prove well founded he hoped to
derive enough profit from this night's work to enable him to lead,
hereafter, a life of ease and honesty in some foreign land; for
Capoulade was disposed enough to be honest once it should cease to
be worth his while to be dishonest.</p>

<p>He stood in Louvel's room at dead midnight, facing the press
which he had been at considerable preliminary pains to ascertain
was the repository of the treasure that was to make him
honest&mdash;a treasure useless to Louvel, a mere hoard of artistic
miserliness. Six steps across the room; twenty seconds to cut a
panel; five minutes to secure the booty and make good his
retreat&mdash;that was all that he now asked of Fortune to the end
that his salvation might be wrought. Yet niggardly Fortune denied
him even that little.</p>

<p>For even as he took his first steps towards the press a loud
knock fell upon the street door. It reverberated through the silent
house, it found an echo in Capoulade's heart, and sent an icy chill
through the marrow of his spine.</p>

<p>The knocking was repeated, vigorous and insistently; and
Capoulade groaned to reflect how soundly they must sleep, how fine
and rare the opportunity that was being ruined for him.</p>

<p>Then came other sounds&mdash;shuffling steps of slippered feet
descended the stairs; the street door was opened. Voices sounded
awhile, then the slippered feet reascended, accompanied now by a
heavy, booted tread.</p>

<p>Physically Capoulade was a coward, but morally he possessed the
courage of ten men. So averse was he from going empty-handed from
that treasure-chamber that he decided at all costs&mdash;despite
his thudding heart and chattering teeth&mdash;to remain until this
newcomer should have gone either to bed or back to the streets from
which he had been so inopportunely admitted.</p>

<p>A moment later he repented this decision in a passion of alarm.
The steps were approaching the very room in which he stood. A shaft
of light entered under the closed doors and thrust out along the
gleaming parquet to Capoulade's feet. Swift and silent as a shadow,
he crossed to where a curtain masked an alcove, and there he hid
himself, prayers on his lips and a knife in his hand, desperate and
vicious as a cornered rat.</p>

<p>The door opened, and old Louvel, in nightcap and white quilted
dressing-gown, advanced, candle in hand. He was followed by a tall,
showily dressed young gentleman, Theodore Louvel, his son, who
filled in Lyons the high office of agent to M. Turgot, the
Comptroller-General.</p>

<p>In silence the old man crossed to the press, unlocked the double
doors and threw them wide.</p>

<p>'There,' he exclaimed, anger quivering in his voice, 'let the
evidence of your own eyes satisfy you.'</p>

<p>He held the candle aloft, so that its light shone upon rows of
shelves&mdash;all empty.</p>

<p>His son took a step forward, staring. From behind his curtain
Capoulade stared, too, in amazement and chagrin.</p>

<p>'But what does it mean?' cried Theodore at last. 'What, then,
has become of the treasure?'</p>

<p>There was a dry, contemptuous laugh from his father.</p>

<p>'Ask yourself rather than me,' he croaked. 'You have not by any
chance kept an account of the sums of which you have drained me in
the last two years? When I remonstrated with you, you laughed. When
I sought to restrain you by refusing you the money which you
demanded, then, like a dutiful son, you threatened my life. Thus,
you said, you should inherit that which I withheld.'</p>

<p>He turned his vulture face upon his son, and a smile of mockery,
ineffably bitter, twisted his lipless mouth.</p>

<p>'I have given you the rope you needed, and you have hanged
yourself. In two years you have had from me five hundred thousand
livres&mdash;and all is gone. I sold my treasures little by little,
and there is nothing left.'</p>

<p>'I'll not believe it!' cried Theodore.</p>

<p>Louvel shrugged his narrow shoulders.</p>

<p>'Believe it or not, it is true. There is nothing for you. You
may kill me now, if you will. I have seen to it that my death, at
least, shall not profit you.'</p>

<p>With black, scowling brows Theodore faced his father, pondering
him as if he would read the mind behind that cynical old mask.</p>

<p>'It is a lie!' he said at last, between his teeth. 'How do you
live if you have nothing&mdash;eh? Answer me that.'</p>

<p>The old man leisurely closed the press and placed the candle on
the table.</p>

<p>'You would, perhaps, deprive me of the little I have retained to
ensure me from perishing of hunger?'</p>

<p>'Ah! You confess, then, that all is not as you represent it?'
was the quick retort. 'You can save me from this ruin that
impends&mdash;and save me you shall&mdash;you must! Do you hear?
You must!'</p>

<p>'You had better kill me, and take what you can find,' the old
man mocked him. 'I would as soon perish by your hand as starve. The
deed, too, would set a fitting climax to our relations.'</p>

<p>'Will you not understand that it is but a loan that I
require?'</p>

<p>'It has always been a loan.'</p>

<p>'This time I will repay&mdash;I swear it.'</p>

<p>'You swear it? <em>Farceur!</em> Out of your beggarly salary
from the Comptroller-General?'</p>

<p>Theodore took a turn in the room, his face as white as his
powdered hair, his eyes anxious. At length he paused.</p>

<p>'It is but ten thousand livres I need, and it is the price of my
salvation from ruin and shame.'</p>

<p>'So has it always been,' sneered his father.</p>

<p>'But I will repay you, I say!' was the vehement, almost frenzied
answer. He plucked a paper from his pocket. 'Listen!' he insisted.
'You are acquainted with Madame Lobreau?'</p>

<p>There was nobody in Lyons to whom that lady's name was not
familiar. Under years of her capable management the Grand Theatre
of Lyons had been raised from a mere puppet-show until it might
have rivalled the most brilliant playhouses of the capital, not
excepting the famous Comdie Franaise.</p>

<p>'Do you propose to murder her in her bed and steal her
jewels?'</p>

<p>Theodore swore furiously under the spur of this sarcasm.</p>

<p>'Will you listen to me seriously?' he demanded. 'This lady holds
her managerial privilege from the Comptroller-General, in whose
power it lies to deprive her of her theatre. I am the Comptroller's
agent in Lyons, and it lies within my power to dispossess her. Now,
it has occurred to a certain Monsieur de Noirmont that, considering
the handsome yields of the Grand Theatre, it should be worth his
while to deal liberally with me to the end that I might enable him
to step into Madame Lobreau's shoes. I trust I have made myself
clear?'</p>

<p>'Yes, yes.'</p>

<p>Old Louvel was always ready to be interested in schemes that
promised profit. The proposal to dispossess Madam Lobreau of the
fruits of her labour and talent was a rascally one. But at heart
old Louvel himself was a rascal, worthy father of his worthless
son.</p>

<p>'Then listen to this,' rejoined Theodore. He unfolded his paper
and read aloud:</p>

<p class="newspaper">In consideration of the Grant Theatre of Lyons
being placed under my control and management, I hereby agree to pay
the Sieur Theodore Louvel the sum of 10,000 livres, and further to
allow him an annuity of 8,000 livres for as long as the said Grant
Theatre shall continue under my management.<br>
<br>
Henri de Noirmont</p>

<p>Old Louvel, who had stood hand on ear while his son read the
agreement, pursed his lips like one in thought.</p>

<p>'Let me see it,' he requested. His son delivered him the paper,
and the old man examined it, assuring himself of its genuineness.
Then he pondered again.</p>

<p>'Very well,' he said slowly at last. 'You shall have the ten
thousand livres by tomorrow evening as a loan, but this agreement
remains in my hands as security until I am repaid.'</p>

<p>Theodore protested blusteringly. But his father held so
stubbornly to the condition that the Comptroller's agent was forced
in the end to submit.</p>

<p>'But I must have the money early in the morning.
Monsieur&mdash;er&mdash;the man in whose debt I stand has given me
until noon tomorrow to find the money.'</p>

<p>'If by noon tomorrow Madame Lobreau is no longer manager of the
Grand Theatre the money will be at your disposal. Tell me,' he
added, 'how soon may I expect to be repaid?'</p>

<p>'I shall place M. de Noirmont in possession of the theatre in a
fortnight. I dare not do it sooner, for the sake of
appearances.'</p>

<p>'Very well.'</p>

<p>The old man locked away the document in a secretaire, took up
the candle, and re-conducted his son.</p>

<p>After Capoulade had heard the street door close upon the
departing Theodore and the old man mount the stairs on his way back
to bed, he crept out of his alcove.</p>

<p>His feelings were those of a man who has been swindled. He had
come there at the peril of life and limb to possess himself of old
Louvel's collection of Italian gems, only to learn that these had
already been sold to pay the gaming debts of that villain Theodore.
He was naturally indignant.</p>

<p>He advanced moodily towards the window and opened it with
caution. He paused in the act of bestriding the sill, and chuckled
softly at his own inspiration. He took the night into his
confidence.</p>

<p>'To make opportunity your slave is the whole philosophy of
life,' he said.</p>

<p>Next morning he waited upon Madam Lobreau at her residence,
representing himself as an actor fallen upon evil days.</p>

<p>'You are come,' she greeted him, offering him a chair, 'to seek
my help. Hlas, monsieur, you come too late!'</p>

<p>'Madame,' loftily answered that tatterdemalion, 'you are
entirely at fault.' He sat down with the air of one who has the
right to do so. 'I do not come to seek your aid, but to offer you
mine.'</p>

<p>He stemmed her questions with a gesture which&mdash;were he the
actor he had announced himself&mdash;might have made his fortune as
<em>Sganarelle</em>. No man was ever more sensitive to his
surroundings than Capoulade, and already he was saturated by the
theatrical atmosphere in which he found himself.</p>

<p>'Madame,' he announced dramatically, 'you have been dispossessed
of your theatre.'</p>

<p>'Is it known already?' she exclaimed.</p>

<p>'Not to the world at large. But to me&mdash;Capoulade&mdash;even
the very reason of it is known.'</p>

<p>'Monsieur,' she protested, bridling, 'I have heard enough and
more of these trumped-up reasons. A cruel, an infamous swindle has
been perpetrated to rob me of my rights&mdash;the rights earned by
years of labour.'</p>

<p>'Adversity, madame, is blunting the edge of your judgement.'</p>

<p>And in lordly gesture he waved the dirty ruffles that hung like
weeping willows over his dirtier hands.</p>

<p>'The reasons known to me are not the lying, trumped-up reasons
expressed to you and to be laid before the Comptroller-General by
your enemies. The reasons that I bring you are the real ones.'</p>

<p>And he proceeded to disclose to her the infamous compact
existing between Louvel and a certain M. de Noirmont.</p>

<p>Madame Lobreau went white and red by turns as she listened.</p>

<p>'But yes,' she cried. 'It is no more than I might have
suspected. You convince me that it is the truth. If we could but
lay proof of it before the Comptroller-General, how I should
trample upon those that would ruin me!'</p>

<p>Capoulade launched his thunderbolt.</p>

<p>'Madame,' said he, pulling a paper from his pocket, 'the proof
is here. Listen to the agreement signed by Monsieur de
Noirmont.'</p>

<p>She heard it in amazement, and, what time he was reading the
terms of that scandalous contract, subconsciously she was taking
stock of him, and neither his shabby raiment nor his keen, wolfish
face was of a quality to inspire her with confidence.</p>

<p>'Monsieur,' she asked him, when he had finished reading, 'how
does it happen that you are in possession of this document?'</p>

<p>He looked at her out of his keen black eyes, scenting the
suspicion that was awake in her. He wisely deemed it a time for
frankness.</p>

<p>'Madame,' said he, 'I am here to serve you&mdash;that is my
guarantee that you will not betray me. I am not exactly an actor.
Such parts as in my time I have played have been played upon that
broad stage we call the world. In short, madame'&mdash;and he
dropped his eyes in a delicate assumption of shame&mdash;'I am just
a thief.'</p>

<p>'And you stole this paper from M. Louvel?' she asked.</p>

<p>He bowed.</p>

<p>'It occurred to me that by appropriating it I might at once
perform a worthy action and compensate myself for my trouble.'</p>

<p>'But how compensate yourself?' she enquired, knitting her
brows.</p>

<p>Capoulade explained that such a document should not be without
its marketable value. She agreed, and offered to purchase it for a
<em>louis d'or</em>. Capoulade gasped.</p>

<p>'Twenty francs, madame?' Then he laughed. 'Perhaps it has not
occurred to you that I might easily get a thousand times that sum
from M. Louvel.'</p>

<p>'Then in your own interests you had best take it to M. Louvel,'
was the uncompromising answer.</p>

<p>Capoulade rose with great dignity.</p>

<p>'I am an honourable man, madame,' he informed her, 'and I prefer
to be on the side of honour. Therefore I come to you, for I should
prefer to deal with you.'</p>

<p>'But if you find me unreasonable you would no longer scruple to
go to M. Louvel?'</p>

<p>'I should scruple, madame, but I should go,' said Capoulade.</p>

<p>Thereafter they bargained for the best part of an hour, the
negotiations being protracted by madame's distrust of Capoulade. It
was not until he rose to leave her that she made up her mind.</p>

<p>'Very well, sir,' she said. 'You shall have a thousand livres;
five hundred now in exchange for that document, and my note of hand
for the other five hundred, payable when I am once again in
possession of the theatre.'</p>

<p>Capoulade considered.</p>

<p>'If I agree, madame,' he asked, 'how do you propose to act?'</p>

<p>'Why, I shall go straight to Paris and place the matter before
the Comptroller-General.'</p>

<p>'You might bungle the affair,' he objected, 'in which case I
should lose five hundred livres. I insist, madame, upon
accompanying you, and you must consent to be guided by my
advice.'</p>

<p>She made some demur at first, but ended by agreeing, reflecting
that his advice might, after all, be useful.</p>

<p>Madame Lobreau took a post-chaise that very evening, and,
accompanied by Capoulade, now in a suit of black and looking almost
respectable, she set out for Paris.</p>

<p>She possessed some little influence, and by exerting it she
obtained, three days later, an interview with M. Turgot, the
Comptroller-General. Accompanied ever by Capoulade, she was ushered
into the great man's room in the Tuileries.</p>

<p>There, for once in his life, the little rogue was rather out of
countenance. He was overawed by the splendour of his surroundings,
and not a little scared by the elegant man with the weary face and
wide-set eyes who sat at the ormolu-encrusted writing-table.</p>

<p>'I am come to tell you, monsieur, that your agent in Lyons is a
rogue,' was madame's uncompromising opening. 'He abuses the
authority which you have vested in him by selling appointments for
his own profit.'</p>

<p>Now, it happened that Monsieur Turgot placed the utmost
confidence in Louvel. He flashed his searching glance upon the
pair, and Capoulade shivered.</p>

<p>'You allude, madame, to the revocation of your licence for the
Lyons theatre,' said the Comptroller in a voice that was as weary
as his countenance. 'My agent gives the soundest reason for the
step, which I approve whilst deploring its necessity.'</p>

<p>Madame breathed gustily.</p>

<p>'May one enquire your agent's reason, monsieur?'</p>

<p>Monsieur took up a paper.</p>

<p>'Amongst others, madame, he finds that a class of play is being
encouraged in which the new and unhealthy doctrines of the rights
of man, and the like, are being exploited.'</p>

<p>'But, monsieur, that is utterly false.'</p>

<p>'I must prefer my agent's judgement,' said that composed and
weary gentleman.</p>

<p>Madame gasped as if for breath. Then:</p>

<p>'If I can lay proof before you, monsieur, that Louvel has
dispossessed me so that he may earn a bribe, what then,
monsieur?'</p>

<p>'Such an abuse of authority shall be punished.'</p>

<p>'Good,' said madame, with satisfaction. 'Will you give yourself
the trouble to read this?'</p>

<p>And she produced Capoulade's document.</p>

<p>Monsieur Turgot perused it with frowning eyes. He turned it
about in his fingers.</p>

<p>'You pretend that this is genuine?' he said contemptuously.</p>

<p>'Certainly, monsieur,' snapped Capoulade.</p>

<p>The Comptroller's eyes were levelled upon him for a moment.</p>

<p>'Who is this?' he enquired.</p>

<p>'My secretary, monsieur,' replied madame.</p>

<p>'Ah! And how does this document, if genuine, come to be in your
hands?'</p>

<p>Again it was Capoulade who interposed.</p>

<p>'It&mdash;it was&mdash;procured, monsieur.'</p>

<p>'Procured, was it? Now listen to me, both of you. In view of
your categorical accusation of Monsieur Louvel, I shall summon him
to Paris. If he prove guilty he shall be fitly punished and your
theatre shall be restored to you. But if, as I suspect, this
document is a forgery, then the law shall deal with you both, and
rigorously.'</p>

<p>Madame Lobreau was assailed by momentary panic, partly allayed,
however, by Capoulade's show of confidence.</p>

<p>'Sir,' he said, 'may I, in the interests of justice, venture
upon a suggestion?'</p>

<p>'In the interests of justice all suggestions are welcome,'
replied M. Turgot sardonically.</p>

<p>Capoulade bowed.</p>

<p>'Then, monsieur, I would very respectfully submit to your
consideration that not Monsieur Louvel's word but only the
subsequent events themselves can prove whether this document is
true or false, and I would suggest, again very respectfully, that
you allow the events to speak.'</p>

<p>M. Turgot frowned thoughtfully.</p>

<p>'And how long do you suggest that the matter should lie in this
suspense?' he asked.</p>

<p>'A fortnight, monsieur, should prove long enough,' said
Capoulade.</p>

<p>The Comptroller pondered the matter yet a moment.</p>

<p>'Be it so,' he said, and upon that dismissed them.</p>

<p>The fortnight that ensued was for Madam Lobreau a period of
considerable anxiety, which not all Capoulade's assurances sufficed
to allay. When, at the end of it, there came a summons from
Monsieur Turgot, that anxiety was converted into positive alarm.
She obeyed it, nevertheless, and Capoulade went with her to the
Tuileries once more.</p>

<p>Monsieur Turgot was very grave, and his manner less weary and
sardonic than when last they had seen him.</p>

<p>'Madame,' he announced, 'I have here a letter from my Lyons
agent, Theodore Louvel&mdash;a letter received five days
ago&mdash;in which he announces to me that he has found in a
certain Monsieur Noirmont your successor at the Grand Theatre.'</p>

<p>'Ah!' said Capoulade.</p>

<p>'Immediately upon receiving it I desired Monsieur Louvel to wait
upon me. I judge no man unheard. He has just arrived, and is
awaiting audience. I deemed it well that you should be present at
the interview.'</p>

<p>Nervously madame expressed her gratitude. Capoulade trembled a
little.</p>

<p>Theodore Louvel was introduced&mdash;raffishly elegant and
impudently at ease, no whit discouraged by the presence of Madame
Lobreau, though guessing she was there as a plaintiff.</p>

<p>'A complaint has been lodged against you, monsieur,' said the
Comptroller, when Louvel had made his bow and his compliments. 'It
is alleged by Madame Lobreau that the reasons you urged for
dispossessing her of the theatre are ill-founded.'</p>

<p>Theodore smiled deprecatingly.</p>

<p>'Of course, monsieur, but I can affirm that I had no interests
to serve other than those of his Majesty.'</p>

<p>'Naturally,' said Monsieur Turgot. 'And yet madame goes so far
as to say that you were bribed by M. Noirmont.'</p>

<p>'That,' replied Theodore, 'is an obvious calumny.'</p>

<p>'True,' said Monsieur Turgot. 'And yet madame's story is oddly
circumstantial. She can even tell me the sum paid by this Noirmont.
It was, she says, ten thousand livres.'</p>

<p>Louvel's aplomb fell from him for a moment. He stood
chap-fallen, and his colour changed. But his recovery was swift. He
repudiated the charge with all the heat of offended virtue.</p>

<p>'Look at this, monsieur,' said the Comptroller, 'and tell me if
you have ever seen it before.'</p>

<p>He held out the document which Capoulade had sold to Madame
Lobreau.</p>

<p>Louvel took it nervously, but as he scanned it he recovered his
composure. He almost laughed when he placed it on the Comptroller's
writing-table.</p>

<p>'An impudent and an obvious forgery, monsieur. Noirmont's very
name is misspelt.'</p>

<p>'Yet,' was the slow answer, 'this document, if forged, as you
say, is oddly prophetic. It has been in my hands a
fortnight&mdash;a fortnight, do you understand? Can you explain how
it came to foretell so accurately the name of the man to whom the
control of the Lyons theatre has since been granted by you?'</p>

<p>'Why&mdash;why&mdash;&mdash;' faltered Louvel; and there he
paused, staring in dismay at the smiling Comptroller. He was
utterly bewildered&mdash;utterly without answer to so incredible a
statement. 'But that is not possible, monsieur,' he cried out at
last.</p>

<p>'I tell you that it is so, monsieur. You cannot explain the
circumstances, eh? It is at once mysterious and convincing&mdash;a
remarkable combination. Be good enough to wait in the ante-room,
Louvel. We shall talk of this again.'</p>

<p>The dumbfoundered agent stumbled blindly out of the room in the
wake of the servant summoned by M. Turgot. Then for some moments
the Comptroller wrote rapidly, watched in silence by Madame Lobreau
and Capoulade.</p>

<p>'There, madame,' he said at last, 'is an order to my new agent
in Lyons to restore you possession of your theatre. In all the
circumstances I will ask no questions about this document you
brought me. I confess that I am curious, but if I knew all perhaps
my duty would not permit me to deal with you as generously as I
desire to deal.'</p>

<p>Bewildered, but clear, at least, upon the all-important fact
that she was once more in possession of her theatre, Madame Lobreau
expressed her thanks and took her leave.</p>

<p>'What did he mean?' she asked Capoulade when they were outside
the palace.</p>

<p>Capoulade grinned. In his immense relief he was proud of his
exploit.</p>

<p>'Why, you see, Louvel was right,' he confessed. 'You see, that
document&mdash;<em>enfin</em>, I wrote it as well as I could from
memory, after hearing Monsieur Theodore read it to his father. I am
afraid my spelling&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'You wrote it?' Her voice became shrill. At last she understood.
'Then it was a forgery. Why, you have swindled me.'</p>

<p>'Ah, no, madame. I undertook that your theatre should be
restored to you, and I have your note of hand for five hundred
livres payable when that shall be accomplished. It is accomplished,
madame. But,' he added, as an afterthought, 'I must improve my
spelling.'</p>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4"></a>THE PLAGUE OF GHOSTS</h2>

<h3>The Storyteller, September 1907</h3>

<p>Capoulade had made the discovery that honesty is the best
policy. He was in hiding in an alley near the Carousel at the time,
and in hourly expectation of capture and harsh treatment as an
anti-climax to his three years' career of ingenious and successful
crime.</p>

<p>He was persuaded that from this Paris, to which an evil hour had
brought him, there could be no escape, for he was well-informed
that M. de Sartines' ubiquitous agents were diligently seeking him.
So he set his wits to work, and resolved upon a course whose
boldness would have appalled a stouter but less ingenious spirit.
If he would find safety he must look for it under the very wing of
the Minister of Police. Such was the resolve he took. Dishonesty,
he realized, was stale, it was failing him in his adversity, and he
would mark his scorn of that fair-weather friend by abandoning its
pursuit, and ranging himself hereafter on the side of law and
order&mdash;always provided that M. de Sartines should prove the
astute opportunist he was reputed.</p>

<p>The brilliant notion once conceived, he was not the man to delay
its execution. The same spring day, whose waking hours had been
devoted to its conception, saw him, towards noon, in the
ante-chamber of the famous Minister. Thus far he had penetrated
without hindrance, and he now sent M. de Sartines a message to the
effect that a certain M. Qulaure, whose acquaintance with criminal
methods was vast, sought to place his services at the
Lieutenant-General's disposal.</p>

<p>From the ante-chamber to the chamber is but a step; yet it was
the one step in his journey from the Carousel to the presence of M.
de Sartines which Capoulade had expected to find fraught with
difficulty. Instead, he found it astonishingly, discomposingly,
easy. He had not been waiting more than a few moments when an usher
approached him with the message that M. de Sartines would see him
at once.</p>

<p>He took a deep breath, like a man about to plunge into deep
waters, and he might have been observed to pale a little. Here was
the situation he had boldly sought; yet, despite his unparalleled
effrontery, he did not relish it now that it had arrived. The
notion which had seemed a finely daring one two hours ago, seemed
now incalculably rash, and he found himself wishing that he had
given it longer consideration before so recklessly proceeding to
act upon it.</p>

<p>Thus, feeling very much as the fly may have felt after it had
accepted the spider's invitation to walk into its parlour, he
stepped into the famous policeman's office. At a littered
writing-table he beheld a richly apparelled gentleman, in the prime
of life, with a hooked nose and a pair of eyes grey and wide-set
that were submitting him to an undisguised and searching
scrutiny.</p>

<p>'Monsieur Capoulade,' said that gentleman, in the most affable
voice in the world, 'I have been expecting you for some days,
although I had not presumed to hope that you would do me the honour
of a spontaneous visit.'</p>

<p>Capoulade felt his knees sinking under him, as many another
criminal had done in the presence of that dread man from whom
nothing seemed concealed. 'Monsieur&mdash;&mdash;' he gasped, and
there he stopped, his cheeks blanched and his ferrety eyes as wide
as he could make them. What, indeed, remained for him to say?
Sartines laughed musically.</p>

<p>'You are surprised that I should know you?' murmured the
Minister, with a lift of the eyebrows, and it flashed through the
little rascal's mind that if ever he had need of effrontery, he had
need of it now.</p>

<p>His aplomb returned. 'Immensely flattered,' he answered, with a
bow.</p>

<p>Sartines' smile broadened. He liked self-possession, accounting
it one of the qualities that make for worldly success.</p>

<p>'I understand from your message&mdash;although you sent it under
a <em>nom de guerre</em>&mdash;that you are seeking service with
me, and that you suggest that your acquaintance with criminal
methods should render you a valuable agent?'</p>

<p>'Yes, monsieur,' answered Capoulade, a world of mingled hope and
despair in his mind. 'I am sick of crime, and I have a mind not
only to be honest, but to make war upon the dishonesty of
others.'</p>

<p>Sartines settled himself comfortably in his chair, and for ten
minutes Capoulade could make nothing of the conversation that
ensued, which was now serious, now rallying on the Minister's part.
Suddenly the Lieutenant-General asked a question.</p>

<p>'Monsieur Capoulade, are you interested in ghosts?'</p>

<p>Capoulade's eyes dilated slightly.</p>

<p>'Monsieur, I have never met one.'</p>

<p>'I can afford you the opportunity,' was the Minister's calm
reply. 'If you care to avail yourself of it, I have employment for
you, if not&mdash;there is always the Chtelet.'</p>

<p>Capoulade shuddered, and moistened his lips.</p>

<p>'I should have preferred, monsieur, that you could have
entrusted me with some affair in which I should have to deal with
ordinary mortals; but if you give me to choose between the Chtelet
and the ghost, why, then, I must take the ghost.'</p>

<p>'Then it is settled. My information is that the Chteau de la
Blanchette, in Maine, is infested by a plague of ghosts. You should
be acquainted with the place, for I understand that you burgled it
six months ago.'</p>

<p>'I knew nothing of the ghosts, or I should have hesitated,'
rejoined Capoulade, with an effrontery that provoked a smile from
Sartines.</p>

<p>'You know now,' said the Minister, 'and if you are anxious for
an affair with ordinary mortals, you shall have that as well. A
deal of spurious silver is circulating in Maine at present, and my
agents trace its source to the town of La Blanchette. Since you are
going there to rid the Chteau of its plague of ghosts, I will
further entrust it to you to rid me the town of this plague of
coiners. I should not be surprised if the elucidation of one
mystery affords the explanation of the other. Former agents of mine
have failed over this same task. To you shall belong the honour of
succeeding. I may take it that you accept?'</p>

<p>Sartines was justified in his assumption, for poor Capoulade was
between the sword and the wall, and must be content with any terms
that were offered him. And so, entrusted with this double mission,
he left Paris for Maine that very afternoon.</p>

<p>He travelled by post without incident as far as Chartres; and
here his luck came signally to his assistance, thrusting him into
conversation with a neighbour who had joined the coach at the
post-house of that city. In itself this was a trivial matter, a
daily happening among travellers; but in Capoulade's case it had
this much of interest that ere they had been acquainted an hour the
conversation between them had turned upon the supernatural. It was
this new travelling-companion&mdash;a healthy, hearty, rubicund
fellow, of some forty summers&mdash;who had introduced the subject.
And Capoulade had not allowed it to be lightly thrust aside by
other topics. Ghosts were concerning him very closely just then,
and he was of a mind to discover all that he could concerning their
habits. His companion seemed no less anxious to pursue the subject,
with the consequence that Capoulade had presently mastered the
facts&mdash;surprising by virtue of the coincidence they
covered&mdash;that his name was Coupri, that he was the intendant
of the Sieur de la Blanchette, and that he was on his way to the
Chteau de La Blanchette to investigate a matter of supernatural
apparitions with which the place was said to be plagued.</p>

<p>'Nobody has resided at the Chteau for the past five years with
the exception of a Monsieur Flaumel and his son, who are acting as
stewards. They are honest fellows both, and the estate has thriven
under their rule, of which they render my master a six-monthly
account. Of the ghosts they know nothing, and refuse to believe in
their existence. But six months ago M. de la Blanchette's two
children went down there with a nurse, intending to remain for the
vintage. Three nights was all they could endure, and they were
obliged to return to Paris lest the children's minds should suffer
from the terrors to which they were nightly submitted. A month ago
Madame de la Blanchette, herself, accompanied by a maid, went to
Maine in consequence of her doctor having ordered her a few weeks
in the country. She slept at La Blanchette one single night, and
returned to Paris next morning, vowing that nothing would ever
cause her to set foot again across that accursed threshold. It is
in consequence of this that my master is sending me down to see
what I can discover.'</p>

<p>Capoulade looked at his stolid, merry face, and envied the man
his courage. 'You are not&mdash;not afraid?' he suggested.</p>

<p>'Afraid?' roared the other. 'Fichtre! I am taking a brace of
pistols to bed with me. I promise you I shall solve this
mystery.'</p>

<p>Capoulade sidled closer to him. Here, indeed, was the very
comrade he needed. He put on a sober, mysterious air.</p>

<p>'I perceive that you are sceptical,' said he, a note of reproof
in his voice. 'It is a dangerous attitude in which to approach the
supernatural. Your patience, monsieur,' he cried, waving aside the
other's threatened interruption. 'You are referring to matters of
which my knowledge may be more extensive than your own. I am an
investigator of the supernatural.'</p>

<p>'A what?' exclaimed Coupri, making of his companion a closer
scrutiny than hitherto. There was about Capoulade, with his
unpowdered black hair tied in a stiff queue, and his keen, sallow,
almost wolfish face, an air that lent colour to his amazing
statement.</p>

<p>'I am an investigator of the supernatural,' he repeated. 'I have
made it the subject of some profound researches, which have taught
me, at least, that it is an ill thing to approach such a task as
yours in the spirit of mockery by which I deplore to see you
actuated.'</p>

<p>Some of the high colour left Coupri's healthy cheeks.</p>

<p>'But, name of a name, monsieur!' he gasped, 'am I to understand
that you believe&mdash;that your studies have made you a believer
in such things?'</p>

<p>'A staunch believer,' said the rogue impressively, 'convinced
against my will, converted by mortal terror from such unbelief as
is inspiring you to make a jest of the matter. Your pistols are
very well, my friend, if there is chicanery at work&mdash;and,
indeed, I do not say that there is not. But such weapons will prove
of little avail if it should be a question of&mdash;of the
impalpable.'</p>

<p>In Coupri's eyes the matter of the ghosts of La Blanchette began
to assume formidable proportions. He sat glum and silent for a
moment; then he laughed, to convince himself that it was a laughing
matter.</p>

<p>'Bah!' he scorned. 'All may be as you say, but at La Blanchette
I am convinced that there is nothing but trickery, and I shall deal
with it with powder and lead. They will prove great
exorcizers.'</p>

<p>But despite this outward fanfaronade his mind was grown uneasy,
and of this Capoulade was quick to detect the signs on the fellow's
honest countenance.</p>

<p>'Monsieur,' said he, speaking very seriously, 'if I were not
afraid of presuming upon our slight but interesting
acquaintance'&mdash;here he bowed to his companion&mdash;'I would
suggest that you take me with you to La Blanchette. You might find
the fruits of my studies of service.'</p>

<p>He had timed his proposal excellently, and it was pounced upon
with flattering eagerness by his fellow-traveller. 'Together,'
ended the honest Coupri, 'we cannot fail to solve this mystery, I
with my natural weapons if the ghosts be flesh, you with your
supernatural ones if they be spirits.'</p>

<p>Thus was the matter arranged between them, and Capoulade
concluded from the adroitness with which he had worked to the end
he desired, that M. de Sartines might congratulate himself upon his
new agent.</p>

<p>They arrived at La Blanchette on the morrow, and Coupri made no
secret of the business that had brought him, presenting Capoulade
to the elder Flaumel as a fellow-servant who had been chosen to
accompany him.</p>

<p>Flaumel frankly laughed at them.</p>

<p>'Come now,' said he, with scornful amusement, 'to what old
wives' tale has the sieur been listening? There are no ghosts at La
Blanchette. Jacques and I have dwelt here these ten years, and
never sound nor sight of them has disturbed our slumbers. A night,
a couple of nights at the most, will convince you, mon cher.'</p>

<p>'Madame de la Blanchette has ordered us not to stir from the
chteau until I can present her with some explanation of these
disturbances. I hope the ghosts will take an early opportunity of
manifesting themselves, or my stay may be protracted. The sieur
wishes to make holiday here with madame. He considers that it is
time he occupied this chteau of his. But madame refuses to
accompany him until the mystery has been cleared up.'</p>

<p>Flaumel shrugged his narrow shoulders.</p>

<p>'My explanation&mdash;the only explanation,' said he, 'is that
madame had the <em>migraine</em> when she was here.'</p>

<p>'But what of the nurse and the children?' cried Coupri.</p>

<p>'Pish!' he sneered. 'The nurse was no doubt frightening them
with some ghost stories, and succeeded in frightening herself as
well. The sleeping apartments are gloomy enough for the rest.'</p>

<p>And with fresh expressions of his scorn, the old steward passed
on to other matters and asked for news of the sieur. Capoulade had
been scrutinizing him closely, but had seen in his demeanour
nothing to excite suspicion. Besides, why should the fellow have
set himself wantonly to frighten women and children&mdash;assuming
that he had a hand in the apparitions?</p>

<p>He was a slender man, whose countenance had been mellowed by age
into a set of benignity, oddly contrasting with the villainous
countenance of his son Jacques. Capoulade looked at the younger
Flaumel's low forehead, flat nose, and eyebrows between which there
was no division, and mentally pronounced him a knave to be
watched.</p>

<p>He spent the remainder of the day roaming the grounds, where all
was green with the fresh, pale green of spring, and Coupri went
with him, but talked little. They supped with the two
Flaumels&mdash;there was no woman at La Blanchette&mdash;and when
they had supped, it was the elder Flaumel who lighted them to their
rooms.</p>

<p>Coupri had insisted that he should lie in the chamber occupied
by madame during her recent visit, and he further insisted
Capoulade should have a room in its immediate neighbourhood. To
this Flaumel made no difficulty, and Coupri was conducted to the
bedroom known as the sieur's chamber. It was a lofty apartment,
panelled in oak to a man's height, and half-filled by the great
canopied bed. Facing the bed, above the wainscot, stood a
life-sized portrait of the present Sieur de la Blanchette's
great-grandfather&mdash;a rakish gentleman of the time of the
fourteenth Louis. Seen in the yellow, flickering light of their
tapers, the apartment wore a sombre, gloomy air&mdash;in itself
almost enough to complete the rout of Coupri's courage.
Nevertheless, it was with a brave display of being at his ease that
he drew the pistols from his bosom and laid them on a chair at his
bedside.</p>

<p>'If any ghost disturbs me, my good Flaumel, I will see how it
takes a charge of lead.'</p>

<p>Wishing him good-night, and still laughing over that last
pleasantry, Flaumel withdrew, and escorted Capoulade to his room
across the corridor. That done, he stepped back and rapped on
Coupri's door. The intendant opened it at once.</p>

<p>'Monsieur Coupri,' said the steward, between seriousness and
mockery, 'I must confess that, after all, I am not quite easy
concerning you. You are sleeping so far from our apartments, my
son's and mine. I am satisfied that you will not be troubled, and
yet, perhaps it is best to be prepared for anything. If you will
step down the corridor with me I will show you where Jacques and I
are lodged, so that you may call us should you require
anything.'</p>

<p>Troubled by this half-descent from his lofty scepticism on the
part of Flaumel, Coupri went willingly with the steward, to be
shown the whereabouts of the latter's quarters. That done, he
returned to his chamber, closed and securely locked the door; then
taking a copy of Monsieur Le Sage's droll story of 'Le Diable
Boiteux' from his pocket, he flung himself, fully dressed as he
was, upon his bed, his pistols within easy reach, and disposed
himself for his vigil.</p>

<p>For best part of an hour he read undisturbed, and reassured by
the peace of the room, his late qualms might have been dissipated
but that whenever he looked about him, peering into the shadows
that lay thick about the chamber, the gloom of the place chilled
his courage anew.</p>

<p>Suddenly the stillness was broken. Reclining on his elbows he
lay and listened, and he felt his flesh creeping as he did so.
There was a sound as of someone faintly scratching on the wainscot
opposite; and for all that his eyes were on the spot, he saw
nothing.</p>

<p>'A mouse,' he sneered aloud, as if seeking to encourage himself
with the sound of his own voice. 'What a poltroon I become!'</p>

<p>The next instant he had fallen back with a stifled scream. A
rush of cold air had swept past him, extinguishing his candle in
its passage. Again he strove to master himself, and for all that
his pulses thundered fearfully, he put forth his hand and groped
for his pistols. Clutching one of them, he sat up and waited, his
teeth chattering in his head. He wished in a subconscious sort of
way that Capoulade was nearer than across the corridor, and that
there were no locked doors between them. Then he ceased to wish
anything, ceased to think anything, as a grim horror took him and
held him spellbound. Fronting the bed at a man's height from the
floor, a white, luminous patch was spreading, like a phosphorescent
cloud, and out of it boomed a horrid groaning sound followed by a
shriek of hellish laughter.</p>

<p>The sweat stood in icy beads on Coupri's brow. He bethought him
of prayers learned in childhood, and he pattered them in a frenzy.
Then from out of the luminous cloud a form began to shape itself, a
figure immensely tall, swathed in a winding sheet, and&mdash;horror
of horrors&mdash;surmounted by a hideously grinning skull with
eyeballs of glowing fire. And the shrieks of it filled the chamber
and froze the very marrow in Coupri's bones.</p>

<p>Then in a flash his late scepticism recurred to him, and with it
his resolve to test the ghost with lead. Mechanically almost he
raised his pistol, and blazed with both barrels at the apparition.
A burst of laughter answered him; next a glowing skeleton hand
slipped from the cerecloth and held out two bullets which it let
fall on to the parquet floor. Coupri heard the double thud of their
fall, then, with a scream, he swooned.</p>

<p>When he recovered there were lights in his room, and Capoulade
and the two Flaumels were at his bedside. Their questions as to
what had happened he could but answer with entreaties that they
should let him depart at once from that hideous chamber, and so in
the end it was arranged that he should spend the remainder of the
night in Capoulade's room and Capoulade's company.</p>

<p>But it was not until next morning, not until the comforting
light of day had dispelled the horror of the night, that Coupri
could be induced to tell his companion what had chanced. Capoulade
listened attentively and very gravely, but when the end of the
story came his glance brightened a little. After they had broken
their fast, he took Coupri for a ramble through the grounds, and
then it was that he communicated an idea that had occurred to
him.</p>

<p>'Does it not seem somewhat strange that a spirit being a thing
impalpable, a thing of no substance to be affected by bullets,
should yet have the wherewithal to grasp those same bullets and
fling them back?'</p>

<p>'Ask me not,' groaned the intendant. 'Who am I that I should
explain these marvels? Never again will I doubt; never again will I
mock.'</p>

<p>'My good Coupri, you go too fast. To doubt unreasonably is
assuredly an ill thing, but in this case I will make bold to say
that nothing has happened yet to warrant any change from your late
scepticism.'</p>

<p>'Nothing?' gasped Coupri. 'Do you say nothing has happened?'</p>

<p>'I will add, Coupri, that, with your permission, it is I who
will sleep in the sieur's bedchamber tonight&mdash;I hope to some
purpose.'</p>

<p>Coupri, like the good soul that he was, sought to dissuade the
young man; but Capoulade would not be dissuaded; he insisted that
in the Sieur de la Blanchette's interests, it was Coupri's duty to
further him in this last attempt to solve the mystery of this
plague of ghosts; and Coupri let him have his way.</p>

<p>He had yet to contend with the opposition of the two Flaumels,
when they met at supper. After last night's happening, following as
it did upon the two former scares, they seemed, themselves, to have
abandoned their scornful attitude, and they entreated Capoulade not
to expose himself. But he was firm in his determination.</p>

<p>'I cannot believe Coupri's preposterous story,' was his
astonishing declaration. 'The poor fellow has been the victim of a
morbid imagination. The proof lies in the fact that we could find
no bullets when we searched the chamber, although he swears he saw
them cast there.'</p>

<p>Flaumel shrugged his shoulders, and Capoulade drawing a brace of
pistols from his pocket proceeded to load them under the eyes of
the company. He placed them on the table, and the talk proceeded
desultorily until Flaumel rose to make fast the doors.</p>

<p>From the hall they heard him calling, agitation quivering in his
voice, and Coupri and Capoulade started up and ran out to him. He
was standing on the steps outside the door, and when they came up
he told them of a white, shrouded figure that had passed round the
corner of the house. They started in pursuit, but though they made
the tour of the chteau they saw no indication of Flaumel's
vision.</p>

<p>'Mon Dieu!' groaned the old man, as they were re-entering the
hall. 'Am I too become a visionary, or is the place really
accursed?'</p>

<p>Capoulade's answer was one of contemptuous incredulity.</p>

<p>'Monsieur Flaumel, for shame! I had thought better of you. You
are becoming the victim of these old wives and their fancies. I am
for bed.'</p>

<p>He re-entered the dining-room, passing the younger Flaumel, who
was coming forth in quest of his father, and taking up his pistols,
Capoulade accompanied the others to the floor above. At parting
with Coupri, he exacted a promise that should he hear a shot he
would at once repair to him.</p>

<p>'But,' he added, 'do not keep awake to listen for it; for the
odds are greatly against your hearing it. I shall laugh at you in
the morning.'</p>

<p>With that they parted, and Capoulade entered his bedroom and
closed the door. He set the pistols he had carried on a chair, as
Coupri had done the night before, and his candle beside them. Then
he lay on the bed and waited.</p>

<p>Two hours went by, and Capoulade was beginning to fear
disappointment, when, suddenly, there came, as on the previous
night, the scratching on the wainscot to attract his attention. But
instead of looking in the direction of the sound, he furtively
peered behind him. He saw what he had expected. One of the panels
of the wainscot at the head of the bed slid silently aside, leaving
an open gap. Then came the rush of cold air which had so frightened
Coupri, and Capoulade was in darkness.</p>

<p>He lay quite still and watched the luminous cloud appear, and as
he watched his thoughts were very busy, but no thrill of fear
unnerved him. The gibbering, howling skeleton grew clearer.
Capoulade smiled grimly in the dark, and left the pistols on the
chair untouched. From his breast-pocket he drew a fresh one,
levelled it with a steady hand, and fired one barrel at the
apparition.</p>

<p>A frightful scream rang through the chamber&mdash;no shriek of
laughter this&mdash;and the ghost tumbled forward and down a height
of some six feet, striking the floor with a thud.</p>

<p>In an instant Capoulade had his candle alight again, and he was
leaning over the prostrate form, which had ceased to glow now that
the candle's yellow light was upon it. He stooped and pulled aside
the sheet, then rolled the figure over on its back and plucked away
the cardboard death's head.</p>

<p>Beneath that mask the ashen face of the younger Flaumel was
revealed, and in one of his clenched hands Capoulade found two
bullets. Above the wainscot, where the Sieur de la Blanchette's
portrait usually stood, a black gap now yawned.</p>

<p>In that moment the door opened, and Coupri, looking very white,
stood on the threshold.</p>

<p>'<em>Voila!</em>' said Capoulade, pointing to the figure. 'I've
laid the ghost. But he'll recover to answer M. de Sartines'
questions yet.' Then, suddenly, his hand went up, levelling his
pistol once more and covering the elder Flaumel, who entered.
'Throw down that pistol, or you're a dead man,' he commanded
savagely, and the old man obeyed him.</p>

<p>When father and son were fast under lock and key, Capoulade
added one or two words of explanation to make things clear to
Coupri's slow mind.</p>

<p>'Last night, after you had laid your pistols down, Flaumel
called you from the room on pretext of showing you where they
lodged. Whilst he was doing this, his son was drawing the bullets
from the charges of your pistols. They did the same by me tonight,
when the old man led us round the chteau to hunt a spectre. But I
had a third pistol in reserve to exorcize the ghost with.'</p>

<p>'But,' stammered Coupri, still bewildered, 'to what end should
they have sought to frighten all who came to the chteau?'</p>

<p>'Who shall say? There are men whose minds never rise above
childishness.'</p>

<p>But Coupri shook his great head. 'No, no,' said he, 'that is no
explanation. It must be that, for some purpose, they wanted to have
the chteau to themselves, as during the past five years.'</p>

<p>Capoulade looked at him, then he smote his thigh with his hand,
and swore a great oath. 'You have said it,' he cried, for he had
suddenly remembered his second task&mdash;the discovery of the
coiners who were pouring spurious silver into Maine. He now
recalled Sartines' words, that the elucidation of one mystery would
probably afford the explanation of the other.</p>

<p>They made search in the chteau, and at last, in a secret
chamber, to which they found access through the passage opened by
the Sieur de la Blanchette's picture, discovered crucible and
moulds and other implements of that nefarious craft, beside a
quantity of base coin in bags. All this, together with their two
prisoners, they conveyed to Paris.</p>

<p>M. de Sartines complimented Capoulade upon his address and
definitely enrolled him in his army of secret agents. And if
Capoulade kept back one of those bags of Flaumel's coins, to the
end that he might obtain good value for bad money, it must be
remembered that the transition from dishonesty to honesty is not
accomplished all at once.</p>

<h2><a name="ch5" id="ch5"></a>THE SWORD OF ISLAM</h2>

<h3><i>Premier Magazine</i>, Auguest 1914.<br>

<p>Ordinarily Dragut Reis&mdash;who was dubbed by the Faithful 'The
Drawn Sword of Islam'&mdash;loved Christians as the fox loves
geese. But in that summer of 1550 his feelings acquired a far
deeper malignancy; they developed into a direct and personal hatred
that for intensity was second only to the hatred which the
Christians bore Dragut.</p>

<p>The allied Christian forces, under the direction of their
emperor, had smoked him out of his stronghold of Mehedia; they had
seized that splendid city, and were in the act of razing it to the
ground as the neighbouring Carthage had been razed of old.</p>

<p>Dragut reckoned up his losses with a gloomy, vengeful mind. He
had lost his city; and from the eminence of a budding Basha in the
act of founding a kingdom he had been cast down once more to be a
wanderer upon the seas.</p>

<p>He had lost three thousand men, and amongst them the very flower
of his fiery corsairs. He had lost some twelve thousand Christian
slaves&mdash;the fruit of many a desperate raid by land and water.
He had lost his lieutenant and nephew, Hisar, who was even now a
captive in the hands of his inveterate enemy, Andrea Doria. It is
little wonder that he lost his temper, too. But he recovered it
quickly, that he might set about recovering the rest. He was not
the man to waste his days in brooding over what was done. Yesterday
and today are but as pledges in the hands of destiny.</p>

<p>So he returned thanks to Allah, the Compassionate, the Merciful,
that he was still alive and free upon the seas, with three
galeasses, twelve galleys, and five brigantines; and bent his
energetic, resourceful, knavish mind to the matter of making good
his losses.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, he had been warned by the Sultan of Constantinople,
the Exalted of Allah, that the Emperor Charles, not content with
the mischief he had already wrought, had, in letters to the Grand
Signior, avowed his intent to pursue to the death 'the pirate
Dragut, a corsair odious to both God and man.' He knew, moreover,
that the emperor had entrusted the task to the greatest seaman of
the day&mdash;to the terrible Admiral of Genoa, Andrea Doria, and
that the Genoese was already at sea upon his quest.</p>

<p>Now, once already had Dragut been captured by the navy of Genoa,
and for four years, which it afforded him little satisfaction to
remember, he had toiled at an oar aboard the galley of the
admiral's nephew, Gianettino Doria. He had known exposure to heat
and cold; naked had he been broiled by the sun, and frozen by the
rain; he had known aching muscles, hunger, and thirst; filthy,
crawling things, and the festering sores begotten of the oarsman's
bench; and his shoulders were still a criss-cross of scars where
the bo'sun's whips had lashed him to revive his flagging
energies.</p>

<p>All this had Dragut known, and he was not minded to renew the
knowledge. It behoved him, therefore, to make ready fittingly to
receive the admiral.</p>

<p>And by way at once of replenishing his coffers, venting a little
of his vengeful heat, and marking his contempt for his Christian
pursuers, he had made a sudden swoop upon the south-western
littoral of Sicily. Beginning at Gergenti, he carried his raid as
far north as Marsala, leaving ruin and desolation behind him. At
the end of a week he stood off to sea again with the spoils of six
townships and some three thousand picked captives of both
sexes.</p>

<p>He would teach the infidel Christian dog to allude to him as
'the pirate Dragut, a corsair odious to both God and man.' He would
so, by the beard of Mahomet!</p>

<p>He put the captives aboard a couple of his galleys, in charge of
his lieutenant, Othmani, and despatched them straight to Algiers,
to be sold there in the slave market. With the proceeds Othmani was
to lay down fresh keels. Until these should be ready to reinforce
his little fleet, Dragut judged it well to avoid encounters with
the Genoese admiral, and with this intent he kept a southward
course along the coast towards Tripoli.</p>

<p>Towards sunset of the day on which Othmani's galleys set out
alone for Algiers, a fresh breeze sprang up from the north and blew
into the corsair's range of vision a tiny brown-sailed felucca, as
it might have blown a leaf in autumn. It was hawk-eyed Dragut
himself who, lounging in the poop of his galley, first sighted this
tiny craft.</p>

<p>He pointed it out to Biretta, the renegade Calabrian gunner, who
was near him.</p>

<p>'In the name of Allah,' quoth he, 'what walnut-shell is this
that comes so furiously after us?'</p>

<p>Biretta, a massive, sallow fellow, laughed.</p>

<p>'The fury is not hers, but of the wind,' said he. 'She goes
wherever it blows her. She'll be an Italian craft.'</p>

<p>'Then the wind that blows her is the wind of Destiny. Haply
she'll have news of Italy.'</p>

<p>He turned on his heel and gave an order to a turbaned officer
below. Instantly the brazen note of a trumpet rang out, clear above
the creak and dip of oars. As instantly the rowers came to rest,
and from the side of each galley six-and-twenty massive yellow oars
stood out, their wet blades glistening in the evening sunlight.</p>

<p>Thus the Moslem fleet waited, rocking gently on the little swell
that had arisen, and its quality was blazoned by the red and white
ensign charged with a blue crescent, which floated from the
masthead of Dragut's own galley.</p>

<p>On came the little brown-sailed felucca, hopelessly driven by
what Dragut accounted the breeze of Destiny. At last, when she was
in danger of being blown past them, Dragut crossed to meet her. As
the galley's long prow ran alongside of her, grappling-hooks were
deftly flung to seize her at mast and gunwale, and but for these
she must have been swept over by those gigantic oars.</p>

<p>From the prow, Dragut himself, a tall and handsome figure in
gold-broidered scarlet surcoat that descended to his knees, his
snowy turban heightening the swarthiness of his hawk face, with its
square-cut black beard, stood to challenge the crew of that
ill-starred felucca.</p>

<p>There were aboard of her six scared knaves, something betwixt
seamen and lackeys, whom the corsair's black eyes passed
contemptuously over. He addressed himself to a couple who were
seated in the stern-sheets&mdash;a tall and every elegant young
gentleman, obviously Italian, and a girl, upon whose white,
golden-headed loveliness the corsair's bold eyes glowed
pleasurably.</p>

<p>'Who are you?' he demanded shortly, in Italian.</p>

<p>The willowy young man answered for the twain, very composedly,
as though it were a matter of everyday life with him to be held in
the grappling-hooks of a Barbary pirate.</p>

<p>'My name is Ottavio Brancaleone. I am from Genoa on my way to
Spain.'</p>

<p>'To Spain!' quoth Dragut, and he laughed. 'You steer an odd
course for Spain, or do you look to find it in Egypt?'</p>

<p>'We have lost our rudder,' the gentleman explained, 'and we were
at the mercy of the wind.'</p>

<p>'I trust you have found it as merciful as you hoped,' said
Dragut. He leered at the girl, who, in affright, shrank nearer her
companion. 'And the girl, sir? Who is she?'</p>

<p>'My&mdash;my sister.'</p>

<p>'Had you told me different you had been the first Christian I
ever knew to speak the truth,' said Dragut, quite amiably. 'Well,
well 'tis plain you're not to be trusted to sail a boat of your
own. Best come aboard, and see if you can do better at an oar.'</p>

<p>'I'll not be trespassing on your hospitality,' said Brancaleone,
with that amazing coolness of his.</p>

<p>Dragut wasted no time in argument. It was not his way. Of the
grinning, turbaned corsairs who swarmed like ants upon the prow he
flung a half-score down into the felucca. Brancaleone had time to
stab but one of them before they overpowered him.</p>

<p>The prize proved far less insignificant than at first Dragut had
imagined. For, in addition to the eight slaves acquired&mdash;and
the girl was fit to grace a sultan's harem&mdash;they found a great
chest of newly minted ducats, which it took six men to heave aboard
the galley, and a beautifully chiselled gold coffer full of gems of
price. They found something more. On the inside of the coffer's lid
was engraved the owner's name&mdash;Amelia Francesca Doria.</p>

<p>Dragut snapped down the lid with a prayer of thanks to Allah the
One, and strode into the poop cabin, where the girl was
confined.</p>

<p>'Madonna Amelia,' he called softly, to test her identity. She
looked up at once. 'Will you tell me what is your kinship with the
Admiral of Genoa?'</p>

<p>'I am his granddaughter, sir,' she answered, with something
fierce behind her outward softness, 'and be sure that he will
terribly avenge upon you any wrong that is done to me.'</p>

<p>Dragut nodded and smiled.</p>

<p>'We are old friends, the admiral and I,' said he, and went out
again.</p>

<p>A mighty Nubian bearing a torch&mdash;for night had now
descended with African suddenness&mdash;lighted him to the galley's
waist, where, about the mainmast, lay huddled the seven pinioned
prisoners.</p>

<p>With the curved toe of his scarlet slipper the corsair touched
Messer Brancaleone.</p>

<p>'Tell me, dog,' said he, 'all that you know of Messer Andrea
Doria.'</p>

<p>'That is soon told,' answered Brancaleone. 'I know nothing, nor
want to.'</p>

<p>'Therein, of course, you lie,' said Dragut. 'For one thing, you
know his granddaughter.'</p>

<p>Brancaleone blinked, and recovered.</p>

<p>'True, and several others of his family. But I conceived your
question to concern his movements. I know that he is upon the seas,
that he is seeking you, and that he has sworn to take you alive,
and that when they take you&mdash;as I pray God they
will&mdash;they will so deal with you that you shall implore them
of their Christian charity to hang you.'</p>

<p>'And is that all you know?' quoth Dragut, unruffled. 'You did
not, peradventure, sight this fleet of his as you were
sailing?'</p>

<p>'I did not.'</p>

<p>'Do you think that with a match between your fingers you might
remember?'</p>

<p>'I might invent,' said the Italian. 'I have told you the truth,
Messer Dragut. Torture could but gain you falsehood.'</p>

<p>The corsair looked searchingly into that comely young face, then
he turned away as if satisfied. But as he was departing Messer
Brancaleone called him back. The Italian's imperturbability had
suddenly departed. Anxiety amounting almost to terror sounded in
his voice.</p>

<p>'What fate do you reserve for Madonna Amelia?' he asked.</p>

<p>Dragut considered him, and smiled a little. He had no particular
rancour against his prisoner; indeed, he was inclining to
admiration for the cool courage which the man had shown. At the
same time, there was no room for sentiment in the heart of the
corsair. He was quite pitiless. He had been asked a question, and
he answered it without malice.</p>

<p>'Our lord the Sublime Suleyman,' said he, 'is as keen a judge of
beauty as any living man. I do the girl the honour of accounting
her a gift worthy even of the Exalted of Allah. So I shall keep her
safe against my next voyage to Constantinople.'</p>

<p>And then Brancaleone's little lingering self-possession left him
utterly. From his writhing lips came a stream of vituperation,
expressions of his impotent rage, which continued even after the
Nubian had struck him upon the mouth and Dragut had taken his
departure.</p>

<p>Next day a slave on Dragut's galley who had been taken ill at
his oar was, in accordance with custom, unshackled and heaved
overboard. Brancaleone, stripped to his delicate white skin, was
chained in the fellow's empty place. There were seven men to each
oar, and Brancaleone's six companions were all Christians and all
white&mdash;or had been before exposure had tanned them to the
colour of mahogany. Of these, three were Spaniards, two were
Italian, and the other was a Frenchman. All were indescribably
filthy and unkempt, and it was with a shudder that the delicately
nurtured Italian gentleman wondered was he destined to become as
they?</p>

<p>Up and down the gangway between the rowers' benches strode two
Moslem bo'suns, armed with long whips of bullock-hide, and it was
not long ere one of them, considering that Brancaleone was not
putting his share of effort into his task, sent that cruel lash to
raise a burning weal upon his tender flesh. He was sparingly fed
with his half-brutalized companions upon dried figs and dates, and
he was given a little tepid water to drink when he thirsted, which
was often. He slept in his shackles on the rowers' bench, which was
but some four feet wide, and, despite the sheepskins with which
that bench was padded, it was not long ere the friction of his
constant movement began to chafe and blister his flesh.</p>

<p>In the scorching noontide of the day he collapsed fainting upon
his oar. He was unshackled and dragged out upon the gangway. There
a bucket of sea-water was flung over him to revive him, and the
too-swift healing action of the salt upon his seared flesh was a
burning agony. He was put back to his oar again with the warning
that did he permit himself a second time the luxury of swooning he
would have the whole ocean in which to revive.</p>

<p>On the third day they sighted land, and towards evening the
galleys threaded their way one by one through the shoals of the
Boca de Cantara into the spacious lagoon on the north-east side of
the Island of Jerbah, and there came to rest.</p>

<p>It was Dragut's intention to lie snug in that remote retreat
until Othmani should be ready with the reinforcements that were to
enable the corsair to take the seas once more against the Admiral
of Genoa. But it would seem that already the admiral was closer
upon his heels than he had supposed, and that, trackless as are the
ocean ways, yet Andrea Doria had by some mysterious means contrived
to gather information as he came that had kept him upon the
invisible spoor of his quarry.</p>

<p>Not a doubt but that the folk on that ravaged Sicilian seaboard
would be eager to inform the redoubtable admiral of the direction
in which the Moslem galleys had faded out of sight. Perhaps even
that empty felucca left tossing upon the tideless sea had served as
an index to the way the corsairs had taken, and perhaps from the
mainland, from Monastir, or one of the other cities now in
Christian hands, a glimpse of Dragut's fleet had been caught, and
Doria had been warned. Be that as it may, not a week had Dragut
been anchored at Jerbah when one fine morning brought a group of
friendly islanders with the alarming news that a fleet of galleys
was descending upon the island from the north.</p>

<p>The news took Dragut ashore in a hurry with a group of officers.
From the narrow spur of land at the harbour's mouth he surveyed the
advancing ships. What already he had more than feared became
absolute certainty. Two-and-twenty royal galleys were steering
straight for the Boca de Cantara, and the foremost was flying the
admiral's ensign.</p>

<p>Back to his fleet went Dragut for cannon and slaves, and so
feverishly did these toil under the lash of his venomous tongue,
and of his bo'suns whips, that within an hour he had erected a
battery at the mouth of the harbour and fired a salute straight
into the Genoese line as the galleys were in the very act of
dropping anchor. Thereupon the fleet of Doria stood off out of
range, and hung there, well content to wait, knowing that all that
was now required on their part was patience. The fox was trapped,
and the sword of Islam was like to be sheathed at last.</p>

<p>Forthwith the jubilant Doria sent word to the Emperor that he
held Dragut fast, and he despatched messengers to the Viceroys of
Sicily and Naples asking for reinforcements with which, if
necessary, to force the issue. He meant this time to leave nothing
to chance.</p>

<p>Dragut, on his side, employed his time in fortifying the Boca de
Cantara. A fort arose there, growing visible under the eyes of the
Genoese, and provoking the amusement of that fierce veteran, Doria.
Sooner or later Dragut must decide him to come forth from his
bottle-necked refuge, and the longer he put off that evil day the
more overwhelming would be the numbers assembled to destroy
him.</p>

<p>Never since Gianettino Doria had surprised him in the road of
Goialatta, off the coast of Corsica, on that famous occasion when
he was made prisoner, had Dragut found himself in so desperately
tight a corner. He sat under the awning of the poop of his galley,
and cursed the Genoese with that astounding and far-reaching
fluency in which the Moslem is without rival upon earth. He
pronounced authoritatively upon the evil reputation of Doria's
mother and the inevitably shameful destiny of his daughters and
their female offspring. He foretold how dogs would of a certainty
desecrate the admiral's grave, and he called perfervidly upon Allah
to rot the bones and destroy the house of his arch-enemy. Then,
observing that Allah remained disdainfully aloof, he rose up one
day in a mighty passion, and summoned his officers.</p>

<p>'This skulking here will not avail us,' he snarled at them, as
if it were by their contriving that he was trapped. 'By delay we
but increase our peril. What is written is written. Allah has bound
the fate of each man about his neck. Betide what may, tonight we
take the open sea.'</p>

<p>'And by morning you'll have found the bottom of it,' drawled a
voice from one of the oars.</p>

<p>Dragut, who was standing on the gangway between the rowers'
benches, whipped round with an oath upon the speaker. He
encountered the languid eyes of Messer Brancaleone. The repose of
the last few days had restored the Italian's vigour, and certain
thoughts that lately he had been thinking had revived his
courage.</p>

<p>'Are you weary of life?' quoth the infuriated corsair. 'Shall I
have you hanged ere we go out to meet your friends out yonder?'</p>

<p>'You're very plainly a fool, Messer Dragut,' was the weary
answer. 'Hang me, and you hang the only man in all your fleet who
can show you the way out of this trap in which you're taken.'</p>

<p>Dragut started between anger and amazement.</p>

<p>'You can show me a way out of this trap?' he cried. 'What way
might that be?'</p>

<p>'Strike off my fetters, restore me my garments, and give me
proper food, and I'll discuss it with you.'</p>

<p>Dragut glowered.</p>

<p>'We have a shorter way to make men speak,' said he.</p>

<p>Brancaleone smiled, and shook his head.</p>

<p>'You think so? I might prove you wrong.'</p>

<p>It was odd what a power of conviction dwelt in his languid
tones. The corsair issued an order and turned away. A half-hour
later Messer Brancaleone, nourished, washed, and clothed, once more
the elegant, willowy Italian in his doublet of sapphire velvet and
in pleasantly variegated hose of blue and white, stepped on to the
poop-deck, where Dragut awaited him.</p>

<p>Seated cross-legged upon a gorgeous silken divan that was
wrought in green and blue and gold, the handsome corsair combed his
square black beard with fretful fingers. Behind him, stark naked
save for his white loin-cloth, stood his gigantic Nubian, his body
oiled until it shone like ebony, armed with a gleaming
scimitar.</p>

<p>'Now, sir,' growled Dragut, 'what is this precious plan of
yours&mdash;briefly?'</p>

<p>'You begin where we should end,' said the imperturbable Genoese.
'I owe you no favours, Messer Dragut, and I bear you no affection
that I should make you a free gift of your life and liberty. My
eyes have seen something to which yours are blind, and my wits have
conceived something of which your own are quite incapable. These
things, sir, are for sale. Ere I part with them we must agree the
price.'</p>

<p>Dragut pondered him from under scowling brows savagely. He could
scarce believe that the world held so much impudence.</p>

<p>'And what price do you suggest?' he snarled, half-derisively, by
way of humouring the Genoese.</p>

<p>'Why, as to that, since I offer you life and liberty, it is but
natural that I should claim my own life and liberty in return, and
similarly the liberty of Madonna Amelia and of my servants whom you
captured; also, it is but natural that I should require the
restoration of the money and jewels you have taken from us, and
since you have deprived us of our felucca, it is no more than
proper that you should equip us with a vessel in which to pursue
the journey that you interrupted. Considering the time we have lost
in consequence of this interruption, it is but just that you should
make this good as far as possible by presenting me with a craft
that is capable of the utmost speed. I will accept a galley of
six-and-twenty oars, manned by a proper complement of slaves.'</p>

<p>'And that is all?' roared Dragut.</p>

<p>'No,' said Brancaleone quietly. 'That is but the restitution due
to me. We come now to the price of the service I am to render you.
When you were Gianettino Doria's prisoner, Barbarossa paid for you,
as all the world knows, a ransom of three thousand ducats. I will
be more reasonable.'</p>

<p>'Will you so?' snorted Dragut. 'By the splendour of Allah,
you'll need to be!'</p>

<p>'I will accept one thousand ducats.'</p>

<p>'May Allah blot thee out, thou impudent son of shame!' cried the
corsair, and he heaved himself up in a fury.</p>

<p>'You compel me to raise the price to fifteen hundred ducats,'
said Brancaleone smoothly. 'I must be compensated for abuse, since
I cannot take satisfaction for it as between one honourable
Christian gentleman and another.'</p>

<p>It was good for Dragut that his feelings suddenly soared to a
pitch of intensity that defied expression, else might the price
have been raised even beyond the figure of the famous ransom that
Barbarossa had paid. Mutely he stood glowering, clenching and
unclenching his sinewy hands. Then he half-turned to his Nubian
swordsman.</p>

<p>'Ali&mdash;&mdash;' he began, when Brancaleone once more cut
in.</p>

<p>'Ah, wait,' said he. 'I pray you calm yourself. Remember how you
stand, and that Andrea Doria holds you trapped. Do nothing that
will destroy your only chance. Time enough to bid Ali hack off my
head when I have failed.'</p>

<p>That speech arrested Dragut's anger in full flow. He wheeled
upon the Genoese once more.</p>

<p>'You accept that alternative?'</p>

<p>Brancaleone met his gaze blandly.</p>

<p>'Why not? I have no slightest fear of failure. I have said that
I can show you how to win clear of this trap and make the admiral
the laughing-stock of the world.'</p>

<p>'Speak, then,' cried Dragut, his fierce eyes kindling.</p>

<p>'If I do so before you have agreed my terms then I shall have
nothing left to sell.'</p>

<p>Dragut turned aside and strode to the taffrail. He looked across
the shimmering blue water to the fortifications at the harbour's
mouth; with the eyes of his imagination he looked beyond, at the
fleet of Genoa riding out there in patient conviction that it held
its prey. The price that Brancaleone asked was outrageous. A galley
and some two hundred Christian slaves to row it, and fifteen
hundred ducats! In all it amounted to more than the ransom that
Kheyr-ed-Din Barbarossa had paid for him. Yet Dragut must pay it or
count his destiny fulfilled. He came to reflect that he would pay
it gladly enough to be out of this tight corner.</p>

<p>He came about again. He spoke of torture once more, but in a
half-hearted sort of way; for he did not himself believe that it
would be effective with a man of Brancaleone's mettle.</p>

<p>Brancaleone laughed at the threat and shrugged his
shoulders.</p>

<p>'You may as profitably hang me, Messer Dragut. Your infidel
barbarities would quite as effectively seal my lips.'</p>

<p>'We might torture the woman,' said Dragut the ingenious.</p>

<p>On the words Brancaleone turned white to the lips; but it was
the pallor of bitter, heart-searing resolve, not the pallor of such
fear as Dragut had hoped to awaken. He advanced a step, his
imperturbability all gone, and he spat his words into the face of
the corsair with the fierceness of a cornered wildcat.</p>

<p>'Attempt it,' said he, 'and as God's my witness I leave you to
your fate at the hands of Genoa&mdash;ay, though my heart should
burst with the pain of my silence. I am a man, Messer
Dragut&mdash;never doubt it.'</p>

<p>'I do not,' said Dragut, convinced. 'I agree your terms. Show me
a way out of Doria's clutches, and you shall have all that you have
asked for.'</p>

<p>Trembling still from his recent emotion, Brancaleone hoarsely
bade the corsair call up his officers and repeat his words before
them.</p>

<p>'And you shall make oath upon this matter,' he added. 'Men say
of you that you are a faithful Moslem. I mean to put it to the
test.'</p>

<p>Dragut, now all eagerness to know what plan was stirring in his
prisoner's brain, unable to brook further suspense in this affair,
called up his officers, and before them all, taking Allah to
witness, he made oath upon the beard of the Prophet that if
Brancaleone could show him deliverance, he, on his side, would
recompense the Genoese to the extent demanded.</p>

<p>Thereafter Dragut and Brancaleone went ashore with no other
attendant but the Nubian swordsman. It was the Genoese who led the
way, not towards the fort, as Dragut had expected, but in the
opposite direction. Arrived at the northernmost curve of that
almost circular lagoon, where the ground was swampy, Brancaleone
paused. He pointed across a strip of shallow land, that was no more
than a half-mile or so in width, to the blue-green sea beyond. Part
of this territory was swampy, and part was sand; vegetation there
was of the scantiest; some clumps of reeds, an odd date palm, its
crest rustling faintly in the breeze, and nothing else.</p>

<p>'It is really very simple,' said the Italian. 'Yonder lies your
way.'</p>

<p>A red-legged stork rose from the edge of the marsh and went
circling overhead. Dragut's face empurpled with rage. He deemed
that this smooth fellow dared to mock him.</p>

<p>'Are my galleys winged like that stork, thou fool?' he demanded
passionately. 'Or are they wheeled like chariots, that I can sail
them over dry land?'</p>

<p>Brancaleone returned him a glance that was full of
stupefaction.</p>

<p>'I protest,' said he, 'that for a man of your reputation you
fill me with amazement. I said you were a dull fellow. I little
dreamed how dull. Nay, now, suppress your rage. Truth is a very
healing draught, and you have need of it.</p>

<p>'I compute, now, that aboard your ships there will be, including
slaves, some three thousand men. I doubt not you could press
another thousand from the island into your service. How long, do
you think, would it take four thousand men to dig a channel deep
enough to float your shallow galleys through that strip of
land?'</p>

<p>Dragut's fierce eyes flickered as if he had been menaced with a
blow.</p>

<p>'By Allah!' he ejaculated; and gripped his beard. 'By
Allah!'</p>

<p>'In a week the thing were easily done, and meanwhile your fort
there will hold the admiral in play. Then, one dark night, you slip
through this canal and stand away to the south, so that by sunrise
you shall have vanished beyond the skyline, leaving the admiral to
guard an empty trap.'</p>

<p>Dragut laughed aloud now in almost childish glee, and otherwise
signified his delight by the vehemence with which he testified to
the unity of Allah. Suddenly he checked. His eyes narrowed as they
rested upon Brancaleone.</p>

<p>"Tis a scurvy trick you play your lady's grandsire!' said
he.</p>

<p>The Genoese shrugged.</p>

<p>'Every man for himself, Messer Dragut. We understand each other,
I think. 'Tis not for love of you that I do this thing.'</p>

<p>'I would it were,' said the corsair, with an odd sincerity. And
as they returned to the galleys it was observed that Dragut's arm
was about the shoulders of the infidel, and that he spoke with him
as with a brother.</p>

<p>The fact is that Dragut, fired with admiration of Brancaleone's
resourcefulness, deplored that so fine a spirit should of necessity
be destined to go down to the Pit. He spoke to him now of the
glories of Islam, and of the future that must await a gentleman of
Brancaleone's endowments in the ranks of the Faithful. But this was
a matter in which Brancaleone proved politely obdurate, and Dragut
had not the time to devote to his conversion, greatly as he desired
it. There was the matter of that canal to engage him.</p>

<p>The Italian's instructions were diligently carried out. Daily
the fort at the Boca de Cantara would belch forth shot at the
Genoese navy, which stood well out of range. To the admiral this
was but the barking of a dog that dared not come within biting
distance; and the waste of ammunition roused his scorn of that
pirate Dragut whom he held at his mercy.</p>

<p>There came a day, however, when the fort was silent; it was
followed by another day of silence, in the evening of which one of
the admiral's officers suggested that all might not be well. Doria
agreed, laughing heartily in his long white beard.</p>

<p>'All is not at all well with that dog Dragut,' said he. 'He
wants us within range of his guns. The ruse is childish.'</p>

<p>And so the Genoese fleet continued well out of range of the
empty fort, what time Dragut himself was some scores of miles away,
speeding for the Archipelago and the safety of the Dardanelles as
fast as his slaves could row.</p>

<p>In the words of the Spanish historian Marmol, who has chronicled
the event; Dragut had left Messer Andrea Doria 'with the dog to
hold.'</p>

<p>Brancaleone accompanied the Moslem fleet at first, though now
aboard the galley which Dragut had given him in accordance with
their agreement. And with the Genoese sailed the lovely Amelia
Francesca Doria, his chest of gold, the jewels, and the fifteen
hundred ducats that Dragut&mdash;grimly stifling his
reluctance&mdash;had paid him. On the second day after leaving
Jerbah, Messer Brancaleone and the corsair captain parted company,
with mutual expressions of goodwill, and the Genoese put about and
steered a north-westerly course for the coast of Spain.</p>

<p>It was some months ere Dragut learnt the true inwardness of
Messer Brancaleone's conduct. He had the story from a Genoese
captive, the captain of a carack which the corsair scuttled in the
Straits of Messina. This fellow's name, too, was Brancaleone, upon
learning which Dragut asked him was he kin to one Ottavio
Brancaleone, who had gone to Spain with the admiral's
granddaughter.</p>

<p>'He was my cousin,' the man answered.</p>

<p>And Dragut now learnt that in the teeth of the opposition of the
entire Doria family, the irrepressible Brancaleone had carried off
Madonna Amelia. The admiral had news of it as he was putting to
sea, and it was in pursuit not only of Dragut, but also of the
runaways, that he had gone south as far as Jerbah, having reason to
more than suspect that they were aboard one of Dragut's galleys.
The admiral had sworn to hang Brancaleone from his yardarm ere he
returned to port, and his bitterness at the trick Dragut had played
was increased by the circumstance that Brancaleone, too, had got
clear away.</p>

<p>Dragut was very thoughtful when he heard that story.</p>

<p>'And to think,' said he afterwards to Othmani, 'that I paid that
unconscionable dog fifteen hundred ducats, and gave him my best
galley manned by two hundred Christian slaves that he might render
himself as great a service as ever he rendered me!'</p>

<p>But he bore no malice. After all, the Genoese had behaved
generously in that he had left Dragut&mdash;though not from motives
of generosity&mdash;the entire glory of the exploit. Dragut's
admiration for the impudent fellow was, if anything, increased. Was
he not, after all, the only Christian who had ever bested Dragut in
a bargain? If he had a regret it was that so shrewd a spirit should
abide in the body of an infidel. But Allah is all-knowing.</p>

<h2><a name="ch6" id="ch6"></a> THE POACHERS</h2>

<h3><i>Premier Magazine</i>, December 1915</h3>

<p>They were a hangdog-looking pair as they rode into Liphook on
that sunny morning of May. One was short and weedy, with bony
shanks and a hungry countenance, the other was a little taller and
a deal bulkier, but bloated of face and generally flabby. They were
dressed in a soiled and tawdry imitation of their betters, and each
looked every inch the gallows-bird that he was.</p>

<p>They drew rein on the little patch of rugged turf before the
Lame Dog, and the portly Nathaniel, without dismounting, called for
a nipperkin of ale, whilst the weedy Jake&mdash;who had received
some elements of education, and was never weary of parading his
scholarliness&mdash;became engrossed in the contents of a bill
nailed to the post that bore the sign of the inn.</p>

<p>It had for title the arresting phrase, 'One Hundred Guineas
Reward.' It began with WHEREAS, and ended with GOD SAVE THE KING,
all in fat letters. In between there were some twenty lines of
matter in smaller type, with the name of THOMAS EVANS boldly
displayed amidst it.</p>

<p>Ominous as was this advertisement to the rogue who, under the
style of Captain Evans, had now for some months been working the
Portsmouth road, it nevertheless filled Master Jake with envy. It
spoke of fame and success in his own line of industry, such as
seemed far indeed beyond the reach of himself and his
colleague.</p>

<p>They were a pair of London foists&mdash;to use the term of their
own thieves' cant&mdash;a couple of sneaking pickpockets who never
should have attempted to soar to higher things, and who were
bitterly regretting their recourse to robbery in the grand manner.
So far it had not proved profitable; at least, not commensurately
with its perils. Yesterday evening, grown bold under the spur of
necessity, they had attempted to demand toll from the London
coach&mdash;thereby usurping the privileges of Captain Evans
himself; but they had bungled the matter through inexperience, and
had been ignominiously driven off by the guard's blunderbuss.
Indeed, but that the guard himself was so scared that he could not
keep his limbs from shaking, they might have brought away a charge
of lead apiece for their pains.</p>

<p>You will now understand Jake's feelings of envy as he scanned
that proclamation. He felt that it would be many a year before the
justices honoured himself in like fashion, before his own unkempt
head became worth a hundred pounds to any man who could come and
fetch it.</p>

<p>In his nasal, sing-song, cockney tones, he proceeded labouredly
to read the advertisement aloud for the benefit of his unlettered
associate. He was interrupted by the advent of the ale. When they
had paid for it, they had but fourpence left between them, and,
unless fortune were singularly benign, they were very likely to
starve. Sullen and downcast, they departed and rode on side by side
with no word passing between them. For sixpence either would have
cut the throat of the other that morning. They turned out of the
highway into a pleasant, well-hedged by-road a little way beyond
Liphook, and they ambled slowly forward in the dappled shade with
the fragrance of hawthorn all about them. It was their unspoken
hope that here they might chance upon some lonely
wayfarer&mdash;preferably of the weaker sex, or at least someone
who would give no trouble. And the very next turn in the road
brought them face to face with one who, in the distance, looked a
likely quarry. This was a slight gentleman astride of a tall, roan
mare with a white blaze. He was dressed all in black, like a
parson, yet with more worldliness and elegance than would have been
proper in a parson. The three-cornered hat over his auburn bag-wig
was pulled down to shade his eyes; for our gentleman was reading.
The roan was proceeding at a walk, the reins loose upon her neck,
whilst her rider, gripping her flanks easily with his knees, was
deeply engrossed in the book he held, which was a translation of
the diverting adventures of a Salamanca student named Gil Blas.</p>

<p>Our rascally twain sighted him from afar, and by common impulse
drew rein, and looked at each other. Jake winked portentously. Nat
nodded, and licked his lips. Then, again by common impulse, they
quietly backed their screws round the corner they had just turned,
and there, out of sight of that solitary and studious wayfarer,
they waited. They had one pistol between them, and it was
Jake&mdash;the gunner of the expedition&mdash;who had charge of
this. He drew it, looked to the priming, breathed on the barrel,
and rubbed it on his threadbare sleeve to increase its lustre.</p>

<p>Round the corner plump into that ambush rode our student,
and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>'Stand!' thundered Jake, levelling his weapon.</p>

<p>The rider looked up, checking instantly as he had been bidden,
and displaying a keen, wolfish face that did not seem to tone quite
well with his studious habits and demure apparel. Indeed, a certain
raffishness hung about him despite his clothes. He seemed
compounded of an odd blend of courtier and lackey.</p>

<p>He considered the rogues who challenged him, and they found his
expression disconcerting.</p>

<p>He displayed none of the sudden terror they had hoped and
expected to inspire. Instead, his glance was vaguely contemptuous
in its nice mingling of amusement and surprise. Calmly he closed
his book and slipped it into his pocket, whilst from under his left
arm he took the heavy riding-crop that had been tucked there.</p>

<p>'What's this, you rabbit-suckers?' he demanded.</p>

<p>Jake thrust his pistol a couple of inches nearer, as if to
insist upon its presence.</p>

<p>'It's this,' said he, 'and it's your purse we want. Come, sir,
deliver!'</p>

<p>'Now, here's impudence, ecod!' was the amusedly scornful answer.
'Am I to be hunted on my own preserves by a couple of poaching
tykes?'</p>

<p>He moved suddenly. Swift and abruptly as a flash of lightning
his heavily loaded crop smashed down upon the dirty hand that held
the barker, and knocked the weapon into the dust. Then he had
plucked a pistol from his own holster, and thus in the twinkling of
an eye made himself master of the situation.</p>

<p>Jake nursed his injured hand, grimacing with pain. Nathaniel
snatched up his reins, stricken with sudden panic. But his flight
was arrested as soon as conceived.</p>

<p>'Stand, hog!' our gentleman summoned him; 'or I'll turn you into
bacon with a bullet.'</p>

<p>They stood at his mercy, and he surveyed them with that sardonic
eye of his.</p>

<p>'On my life, you're a fine pair of tobymen!' he admonished them.
He read their true natures as easily as he had read the diverting
history of the Salamanca student. "Twas an ill hour in which you
left your town kennels, you rats, to turn gentlemen of the pad and
take toll in the heroic manner! Turn out your pockets, you
cony-catchers, and let us see how you have thriven! Turn 'em out, I
say, and hand over your poachings!'</p>

<p>They obeyed him with a ludicrous alacrity, and revealed the
miserable state of their affairs. Our gentleman in black surveyed
with an eye of scorn the copper coins in Nathaniel's dirty
palm.</p>

<p>'How long have ye been poaching upon my preserves?' he demanded.
Receiving no answer: 'Speak out, you muckrakes!' he bade them. 'I
am no sheriff's officer. I am Captain Evans, of whom you may have
heard.'</p>

<p>Jake needed but this confirmation of what already he had
suspected. He fell to fawning upon the notorious gentleman of the
pad, and proceeded to relate a moving tale of misfortune. The Bow
Street runners had been on their trail in town, and they had taken
to the country for a change of air and of method. So far, however,
they had not prospered as highwaymen. They had robbed a parson two
days ago, but his purse had held but three poor shillings, of which
all that remained was the fourpence Nathaniel had displayed.
Finally came the admission that they were hungry; and thus a
business begun with a fiercely bellowed 'Stand and deliver!' ended
now in a piteous whine for alms.</p>

<p>Captain Evans considered them. At length he addressed
Nathaniel.</p>

<p>'Get down, pig-face,' he commanded, 'and fetch me that
barker!'</p>

<p>Obediently Nathaniel dismounted, picked up the fallen pistol,
and delivered it to the captain. Evans dropped it into his pocket.
Then, restoring his own weapon to its holster, he took the heavy
crop, and, tucking it under his arm again, he finally addressed
these rogues.</p>

<p>'Ye inspire me with little confidence,' said he. 'Still, I have
a better notion. If I were to toss you a guinea, you would be in no
better case when that was eaten. I'll do better by you, and,
meanwhile, I'll mend your emptiness. Follow me, but at a distance,
for I'd not have it thought I keep such rat-bitten company!'</p>

<p>On that he wheeled his mare about, and rode off briskly along
the road by which he had approached. The twain looked at each
other. Nathaniel's prominent eyes asked an obvious question.</p>

<p>'Ay,' said Jake; and they set out to follow.</p>

<p>The captain led them a half-mile or so down that by-way, then
for a short distance along a narrow, grassy lane to a cottage that
stood back in a little patch of land&mdash;a little, white-washed
house set in a miniature orchard, as innocent-looking a retreat as
could have been conceived. Within the gate he waited for them to
come up with him, and when the horses had been stabled in a
lean-to, he conducted them within doors to what was at once the
kitchen and the living-room. He bade them to table, and, having set
meat and drink before them, took his own seat apart, and smoked
thoughtfully while they noisily satisfied their hunger.</p>

<p>From time to time he would fling them a disdainful glance, and
from time to time they would steal awed looks at him, noting his
boots of fine leather and his silver spurs, the cut of his handsome
black coat, and the extravagance of his ruffles&mdash;which,
incidentally, were not as clean as they might have been, although
that was too nice a point for our tatterdemalions.</p>

<p>Captain Evans was a man of ideas. It was not for nothing that he
had been reading the adventures of Gil Blas that morning. He had
been greatly taken with the description of the retreat of the
robbers who captured the Salamanca student, and he was romantic
enough to desire on a lesser scale to organize a somewhat similar
band in the pleasant county of Hampshire&mdash;at least, the notion
assailed him when he came to consider how he might turn these two
starveling thieves to account. They were to form the nucleus of the
band, which he would rule as captain absolute. Thus, you see, he
was concerned with improving upon the heroic traditions of the high
toby.</p>

<p>He unfolded his scheme to the twain, when at last they had fed.
It was as yet a little vague and inchaote in its details, but the
main lines it should follow were plainly indicated, and he expected
it to be greeted with enthusiasm. At the conclusion he addressed
himself more particularly to Nathaniel.</p>

<p>'Well, pig-face,' he questioned, 'how does it seem to you?'</p>

<p>'My name,' said the flabby rogue, 'is Nat.'</p>

<p>'Maybe, but pig-face becomes you better. Will ye work with
me?'</p>

<p>And he looked from one to the other.</p>

<p>Jake agreed with alacrity to the plan, profoundly honoured to
serve under so illustrious a leader. Nathaniel, more reluctant
because resentful of the lack of respect shown him by the captain,
required to be persuaded by his fellow. But in the end it was
settled; the twain were to be enrolled under the captain's
banner.</p>

<p>The nature of the active service upon which they were to
adventure had yet to be considered, and the captain promised to
consider it forthwith. Meanwhile, since they showed signs of
slumber as a result of their gross overfeeding, he let them rest
for today and recuperate their energies.</p>

<p>'Ye'll be snug and safe here, so that ye lie close,' he assured
them, rising. Then he issued an order, 'Now that ye've eaten, clear
the table and wash the platters clean. 'Twill be some employment
for you while I'm gone. I shall be back tonight.'</p>

<p>With that he left them.</p>

<p>They heard the hoofs of the roan go padding down the lane, then
at last Nathaniel loosed his pent-up wrath.</p>

<p>'I'll be triply durned,' said he, 'if I turn scullion to any
ruffling cove of the pad! Wash the platters!' He snorted angrily.
'Skewer my vitals, do I look like a scullery wench?' He rose in his
rage at the indignity. 'And he called me pig-face, the dirty thief!
And&mdash;and you, Jake, ye fool, let him beguile you with his
smooth cant into promising to serve with him! Fine service, i'
faith! Us'll risk our necks while his lordship takes the plunder.
If ye've an ounce of sense in your ugly head, ye'll come away with
me this instant!'</p>

<p>Jake raised his weasel face, and looked at his fellow with
shrewd, narrowing eyes.</p>

<p>"Tis the way o' fools and drunkards,' he moralized, 'that they
must think all the world in their own case. Sit down, you cackling
Tom o' Bedlam, and listen! I know ye're an unscholarly, ignorant
cove that can't read for yourself. But didn't I read ye what it
said on a paper outside the Lame Dog at Liphook this morning?
Didn't ye hear that the Guvviment be offering a hundred guineas for
the capture o' this ruffling cove?' He paused a moment to give more
effect to what he was about to add. Then he closed one eye slowly.
'Us'll earn it,' he said softly.</p>

<p>Nathaniel stared, his mouth gaping, his eyes bulging. Then he
smacked his dusty breeches, and again invited someone to skewer his
vitals. Thereafter they discussed the matter.</p>

<p>Captain Evans returned towards evening, and he came at a
breakneck gallop, which in itself might have warned his newly
enrolled followers that something was wrong. He was breathing
heavily when he entered the kitchen, where the twain awaited him,
and his face gleamed white in the gathering dusk. He dropped to a
chair, and mopped his face with a handkerchief; raised a wig, and
mopped his cropped head as well.</p>

<p>"Od's life, my lads, a near thing!' he panted.</p>

<p>The sense of peril oozed from him like perspiration, and,
catching the infection of it, they sat still, watching him, and
awaiting his explanation.</p>

<p>"Twas that sleuth from Bow Street, Baldock&mdash;the shrewdest
catchpoll in the country. He's been on my heels this month past and
more. I fooled him once out o' sheer wantonness, and it is an
unforgiving dog, without humour. But I'll fool him again ere all is
done. He has never seen my face save once, and then it was so
disguised that he'd never recognize it. Yet this evening he was
within an ace of laying me by the heels. There was a trap set for
me. I had taken a fat purse 'twixt this and Petersfield, and I was
returning, when I stopped for a pint of claret at a roadside inn.
But for a friendly ostler who gave me a hint, I'd have had more
than my pint of claret, and 'tis odds ye'd never again have seen
Captain Evans, unless ye went to his hanging.' He stretched his
legs, and breathed more easily. 'Give me to drink, one o' ye. There
should be ale in the cupboard there.'</p>

<p>It was Jake who did him the service he asked, and fetched a jar
from the cupboard. There was little left in it, no more than a
cupful, but the captain drained it gratefully. Then he fished out
of his pocket a green silk purse with a glint of gold showing
through the meshes&mdash;a purse which he had taken that
afternoon.</p>

<p>'And now, my lads, we must part company,' he informed them. 'The
sleuths are too hot upon the scent, and the moment were ill-chosen
for the association we had thought of. If we stick together you
will but increase my danger, whilst I shall bring danger upon you,
too. I am for the West Country for a season, until the Portsmouth
Road is clear of Baldock and his runners. 'Twas but to warn you
that I returned tonight. You must fend for yourselves, my lads: and
here's to help you on your way.'</p>

<p>On the word he flung the silk purse on to the table, where it
fell with a mellow clink.</p>

<p>His generosity, both in this and in having taken risks to return
to warn them, must have touched hearts less vile. Them, however, it
left unmoved, save by greed and the sense of the need for urgent
action. Jake fastened a lean claw upon the purse, and his eyes were
two glistening beads.</p>

<p>"Tis very generous of you, captain,' said he; and it almost
seemed that he sneered.</p>

<p>Captain Evans rose.</p>

<p>'And now, fare you well,' he said.</p>

<p>As he spoke the pair of them leapt at him. Taking him utterly by
surprise, they bore him struggling to the ground under their
combined weight. He was strong and agile, and almost a match for
the pair of them&mdash;almost, but not quite. The fight that ensued
was fierce and long-drawn. The captain writhed and twisted,
grappled, kicked, and smote at them, and before he was overpowered
that savage, silent scrimmage had swept across the length of the
kitchen floor, raising a cloud of dust, knocking over chairs and
table in its furious course. But in the end they had him helpless,
bound hand and foot; sweating and panting from his exertions,
wigless, dusty, and with disordered garments, glaring at them with
furious eyes.</p>

<p>Nathaniel righted one of the chairs that had been knocked over.
They forced the captain into it, and bound him firmly to it with
cords which they had prepared. Thus powerless, his white face
writhing with anger and contempt, he cursed them fiercely for a
moment.</p>

<p>'What are ye at all?' he asked them thereafter. 'Could I be
mistook? Are ye a couple of dirty catchpolls who have tricked me
into believing ye are upright men?'</p>

<p>The flabby Nathaniel, who, winded by his labours, had dropped
wearily to a chair, had a miserable pretext ready.</p>

<p>'Ye called me pig-face!' he said, with a show of being
offended.</p>

<p>'I see,' said the captain. 'And it was that led you to remember
that I am worth a hundred guineas to any that can take me.'</p>

<p>He was on the point of adding something more, but it occurred to
him that invective was not likely to help him here, that never had
he been in more desperate plight since once when the constables had
actually fastened their talons on him. What saved him then was his
presence of mind, his ready wit. And that was the only weapon that
remained him now. He took their measure accurately. He saw that
they would no more be loyal to each other than they had been to him
did they perceive a course of profitable disloyalty. His first aim
must be to separate them so that he might deal with each in turn.
He threw back his head, and laughed&mdash;a thing so unexpected
that it set them staring at him in alarm.</p>

<p>'Faith,' he said, 'the situation has its humour! I've been a
fool, and I'm no such curmudgeon, after all, as not to know that a
fool must blame only himself, and pay the reckoning.'</p>

<p>"Tis the proper spirit,' said Jake. And he proceeded diligently
to empty the captain's pockets.</p>

<p>They yielded him another purse, a gold snuff-box with a jewelled
crest, a watch, a couple of valuable rings, and, finally, a brace
of barkers. He piled the plunder on the table, and Nathaniel fell
to inspecting it, chuckling.</p>

<p>The captain watched them, his wits busy.</p>

<p>'Perhaps ye've chosen wisely,' said he presently. 'Ye make
better thief-takers than tobymen. Ye'll turn king's evidence
against me, thus save your dirty necks, and pocket the reward that
Baldock covets. Ay, 'twas shrewdly thought.' He coughed. 'Gad, the
dust is thick in my throat. Give me a drink.'</p>

<p>'The ale is done,' said Jake, who had his suspicions of the
captain's amiable philosophy.</p>

<p>'Ay, plague on't,' growled Nathaniel, lifting the jar.</p>

<p>'True,' said Evans. 'I had forgot. But there's a bottle of
brandy upstairs in my bedroom&mdash;in one of the drawers of my
chest.'</p>

<p>Nathaniel's eyes glowed sombrely.</p>

<p>'Go fetch it, if ye will. Ye'll need to break the lock, maybe;
for I cannot mind me where I left the key.'</p>

<p>Nathaniel departed without further persuasion. They heard him at
work overhead, and the smash of woodwork told of the ardour of his
search. Since, as a matter of fact, there was no such bottle as the
captain suggested, that search was likely to be protracted.</p>

<p>The captain looked at Jake.</p>

<p>'Seize this chance,' he said softly. 'Set me free, and I'll pay
you twice the sum the Crown is offering for me. More, Jake, I'll
make your fortune ere all this is done.'</p>

<p>Jake scowled, displaying not the slightest sign of compliance.
But then the captain had not expected any.</p>

<p>'And who's to warrant me that?' sneered the rogue at last, when
he had overcome his surprise at the impudence of the proposal.</p>

<p>The captain nodded his head in the direction of the table.</p>

<p>'Why, there,' he exclaimed, 'you have a good two hundred
guineas' worth at the least. 'Tis twice as much as the reward, and
more easily earned. Sweep it into your pocket, man, and let us
begone while that drunken fool is busy above stairs. Make haste,
man! Cut me these cords!'</p>

<p>He watched the slow kindling of Jake's eye, the gradual
loosening of his mouth, and he was satisfied that the rascally idea
he had released was biting deep into the scoundrel's brain. Then
followed precisely what the captain had expected. Jake moved
furtively towards the table, his lips twitching, his whole
countenance alert and somewhat scared. He swept the two purses and
the rest of the plunder into his pockets. Then he took up the
pistols and examined them. One was his own weapon, of which the
captain had dispossessed them on their first encounter. It was
loaded and primed, and so he dropped it also into his pocket. The
other one was a barker that the captain had emptied that afternoon
to scare the postilion of the gentleman he had robbed. It had not
since been reloaded, and it may have been due to this that Jake
laid it down again.</p>

<p>Then, without another word or so much as another glance at the
prisoner, he stepped quickly and softly to the door.</p>

<p>Seeing this, the captain raised his voice in protest.</p>

<p>'Ye'll never leave me, Jake!' he cried, in simulated horror.</p>

<p>Jake leered at him over his shoulder in silence. Then he pulled
the door open, passed out, and closed it gently after him.</p>

<p>The captain smiled to himself and waited. He heard Jake leading
a horse into the open, while the fool above stairs continued his
quest for the phantom bottle. In another moment hoofs went thudding
down the lane, gathering speed as they receded. The captain laughed
outright. So far things had sped excellently, and he was rid of one
of his enemies. True, the thing had been achieved at considerable
cost. But our tobyman was no niggard with the fruits of his
ventures.</p>

<p>Minutes passed, then down the stairs, breathing noisily and
swearing fluently, came Nathaniel.</p>

<p>'Skewer my innards,' said he, as he entered, 'I can't find no
plaguey bottle.' Then he stopped short and looked about him.
'Jake!' he called. And then, 'Where's Jake?' he enquired.</p>

<p>'Gone,' said the captain.</p>

<p>'Gone!' echoed Nathaniel, uncomprehending. 'Gone where?' He
rolled forward into the room.</p>

<p>'Why, to some stuling-ken, belike, to dispose of the plunder. He
went off with it what time ye were rummaging for the brandy.' He
laughed at the other's blank face. 'Ye're a confiding
soul&mdash;nay, a durned confiding soul.'</p>

<p>Nathaniel rolled his eyes to the table, and saw its emptiness of
all save the pistol.</p>

<p>'Ye don't mean that he's bubbled me!' he cried, on a whimpering
note.</p>

<p>'What else?' wondered Captain Evans.</p>

<p>'That he's not coming back?' Nathaniel insisted, still
disbelieving his senses.</p>

<p>'Oh, he may be coming back. But if I were you, I should pray
that he may not, or at least I shouldn't stay for him.'</p>

<p>'What d'ye mean?'</p>

<p>'Gad!' said the captain. 'I vow ye're the flabbiest fool that
ever cut a purse. What do I mean? Why, isn't it plain? If he comes
back at all, he'll come back with Baldock, and take you together
with myself, turning king's evidence against the pair of us, and
thus making sure of the hundred guineas reward in addition to all
the rest.'</p>

<p>It was a blow that winded Nathaniel. His face turned first
purple, then pale. To express his amazement, his realization, and
his poisonous rage, he swore with a most disgusting fluency. Then
he paused.</p>

<p>'I'll not believe it!' he cried. 'He'll never be so dirty a tyke
as that.'</p>

<p>'You've but to stay if you desire to ascertain precisely how far
his villainy will go.'</p>

<p>'But, man&mdash;&mdash;' Nathaniel checked. His eyes alighted on
the pistol lying on the table. 'Nay, now. He'd never have left his
barker if he meant such business as that.'</p>

<p>'The barker! Ha!' said the captain, with an odd inflection; and
he added sharply, 'Look at it!'</p>

<p>Nathaniel snatched it up.</p>

<p>'Unloaded!' said he; and with that his last, lingering, hopeful
doubt was dissipated.</p>

<p>Utter consternation invaded his soul, and overspread his face.
To linger here now was to await certain capture, as the captain so
shrewdly had warned him.</p>

<p>'Odds rot the plaguey thief!' he snarled. 'If ever I meet him
ag'in, I'll&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>He stopped. He had no words in which to express the horrors he
would perpetrate upon the person of his treacherous associate.
Then, abruptly, he snatched up his ragged hat, pressed it upon his
no less ragged head, and made for the door.</p>

<p>Now, this was not at all as the captain desired it. He did not
himself believe for a moment that Jake would undertake any such
desperate adventure as to fetch Baldock. He was convinced, in fact,
that Jake would be perfectly and wisely satisfied with the result
of his treachery to his comrade as it stood, and would avoid a risk
in which he might well lose all, and find his way to the gallows in
addition.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he had no desire to be left pinioned there as he
was. He had rid himself of one of his captors, and was about to rid
himself of the other, and he flattered himself that he had
contrived the thing with a rare thoroughness; but, before Nathaniel
abandoned him, he must see to it that he was set at liberty.</p>

<p>'Hold!' he shouted. 'Are ye going to leave me here to fall into
his hands?'</p>

<p>Nathaniel shrugged, and lifted the latch.</p>

<p>'Is this how you repay me for warning you? For you'll admit that
but for my warning you 'ld never ha' smoked his full intentions.
You'd ha' lain in Petersfield Gaol with me this night. And would ye
desert me now?'</p>

<p>'Each for himself,' said Nathaniel callously, and opened the
door.</p>

<p>Then the captain played his trump-card.</p>

<p>'Are ye going to put another hundred guineas in that weasel's
dirty pockets?' he cried.</p>

<p>Nathaniel checked at that. He turned, his face grimly
resolute.</p>

<p>'No, by gad! No, sink me!' he declared.</p>

<p>'Come, now, that is better. Besides, my friend, I can show you
how to overtake him yet, and turn the tables on him.'</p>

<p>'How?' quoth Nathaniel, with fresh eagerness.</p>

<p>'How?' said the captain; and he smiled. 'Gad! There's not a
drawer or ostler in an inn on all the Portsmouth Road but is my
friend. They'll set me on his track, and when we've got
him&mdash;&mdash;But bestir, man; we'll talk of that as we go!'</p>

<p>Nathaniel produced a knife, and slashed away at the prisoner's
bonds. Evans rose, and stretched himself, a little numb from the
pressure of the cords upon his arms and legs. He straightened his
disordered garments, and bent down to dust his breeches.</p>

<p>'Give me my wig, Nat,' he said, pointing to it where it lay in a
corner of the room.</p>

<p>Nathaniel, unsuspecting, stooped to do his bidding, nor rose
again. For, swift as a cat, the captain leapt upon him from behind,
and bore him to the ground, wielding in his right hand the empty
pistol which he had snatched up from the table.</p>

<p>Pinned there, prone, with the captain's knee in the small of his
back, Nathaniel squealed like a stricken rabbit, what time the
captain mocked him.</p>

<p>'You pig-faced foist!' he said. 'You to play the tobyman! You to
rob in the grand manner! You to ruffle it on the pad! Odds my life,
you dirty thieving dawcock, I hope this will cure you of all such
vanity. And you thought you could hold Captain Evans&mdash;you!
Bah!'</p>

<p>The captain tapped him sharply over the head with the butt of
the empty pistol, and rose, leaving him stunned where he lay. Then
he adjusted his wig, took up his hat and riding-crop, and left the
cottage.</p>

<p>But in the lean-to an unpleasant surprise awaited him. The
horses stabled there were the two screws upon which Nat and Jake
had ridden. His own roan mare with the white blaze was gone, and he
realized that it was Jake who had taken her. In an exceeding
ill-humour, and breathing redoubled vengeance now that his chances
of overtaking Jake to effect it were considerably diminished, the
captain rode off on the better of those two sorry nags.</p>

<p>He made straight for Liphook and the Lame Dog, hoping there to
pick up news that should set him on the track of the renegade. The
news he found was of another kind.</p>

<p>'It is well for you, captain, that ye didn't come a half-hour
ago,' was the greeting he received from Tom, the drawer.</p>

<p>And thereupon the fellow told his tale:</p>

<p>'There was a gentleman here who swore he had been robbed this
very afternoon twixt this and Petersfield. With him was Baldock,
the thief-taker, who swore 'twas yourself had robbed the gentleman,
and likewise swore to lay you by the heels. And then, whilst they
were in the taproom, up rides a down-at-heel scarecrow of a fellow
on your own roan mare, captain. The gentleman who had been robbed
was sitting by the window, and no sooner does his eye light on this
traveller than up he jumps in a great heat, swearing that this was
the man who had robbed him.</p>

<p>'"Are ye sure?" cried Baldock, all of a shake in his
eagerness.</p>

<p>'"Certain sure," says the gentleman. "I couldn't be mistook;
though the rascal's face was masked there was no mask on the nag,
and I 'ld recognize that white blaze anywhere."</p>

<p>'That was enough for Baldock. He whistled, and in the twinkling
of an eye they had that scarecrow off the mare, and they was going
through his pockets. And there, sure enough, it seems, they found
some rings and other things of which the gentleman had been robbed
this very day.</p>

<p>'The rogue swore that he was not Captain Evans. He told a wild
tale of how he had come by those trinkets. He protested that he had
himself captured Captain Evans, and that he had him bound fast in a
place to which he offered to lead Baldock. But the Bow Street
runner laughed at him.</p>

<p>'"Ye've bubbled me afore, Captain Evans," says he, "and I'll be
blistered if ye bubble me again! I have ye safe this time." And
they carried the poor devil off to London.'</p>

<p>The captain's laughter pealed forth.</p>

<p>'I was sorry for the poor rogue,' said the drawer, 'and I might
ha' helped him. But, o' course, it weren't for me to be doing that
at your expense, captain.'</p>

<p>'Small need for sorrow on his account, Tom,' the captain assured
him. 'The rogue is well served for his impudence in setting up for
a ruffler of the pad. The high toby is a place for gentlemen, egad,
and he was no better than a poacher. What of the mare, Tom?'</p>

<p>'They took her along.'</p>

<p>The captain sighed.</p>

<p>'I've paid dear for my folly. Still, when all is
said&mdash;&mdash;Bah! Give me a pint of claret, Tom, and lace it
well with brandy. I am somewhat shaken by this adventure.'</p>

<h2><a name="ch7" id="ch7"></a>THE SENTIMENTALIST</h2>

<h3><i>Premier Magazine</i>, December 1919</h3>

<p>Captain Evans&mdash;to give him the rank he had assumed for
decorative purposes and without having any real claim to
it&mdash;rode out of Godalming alone and early one fragrant summer
morning, leaving his younger brother, Will&mdash;in conjunction
with whom he was in the habit of 'working', as the term was, the
Portsmouth Road&mdash;snugly abed at the Black Boar Inn. He was
bound for Petersfield, or, rather, for the Fox and Hounds, which
invites custom a mile or so to the north of that prosperous little
township, and he rode in answer to an urgent message from Tim, the
ostler, whom he subsidized to keep him informed of such movements
upon the road as it imported him to know in the way of business.
Tim had bidden him to be at the Fox and Hounds not later than noon,
intimating that he would then have an important communication for
our captain. But the captain, having risen early, found himself
breasting the slopes in the neighbourhood of Thursley by nine
o'clock&mdash;as recorded by a watch which a week ago had been the
property of the Bishop of Salisbury, and which could not,
therefore, be suspected of inaccuracy.</p>

<p>It followed that the captain had an hour or so to spare over and
above the necessary time in which to complete the journey without
undue exertion, and no sooner had he realized this than he caught
sight of a yellow chaise coming into view on the brow of the hill
above him. A man of quick decision&mdash;which, after all, is the
first essential of success in his difficult calling&mdash;the
captain swung his mare to the right, and vanished down a narrow
lane that opportunely offered itself. Fifty yards down this lane he
halted, swung aside again, and, putting the roan at a low fence on
his left, landed in a meadow. He rode gently back towards the road,
took up a position behind a clump of trees, and waited, vigilant
and invisible.</p>

<p>The carriage came lumbering down the hill, a two-horse
post-chaise, yellow as a buttercup in the morning sun, betraying
nothing of its contents. More pressed for time, the captain might
have allowed the hired vehicle to go unmolested. It was not his way
in these days to take risks where he was not sure of profit; but
with an hour or so on his hands, and the very freshness of the
morning stimulating his young blood to high adventure, he resolved
to investigate at closer quarters.</p>

<p>Back he went by the way he had come, and along the lane out into
the open road, there to turn and trot in the wake of the coach,
which was heading for Godalming. At a pace that, without being hot
enough to alarm the travellers, yet steadily lessened the distance
between himself and the chaise, Captain Evans drew alongside. It
was his intent&mdash;and in accordance with his usual
practice&mdash;first to reconnoitre, and then, if satisfied, to
ride ahead and turn to deliver the attack.</p>

<p>He was the last man to shirk a hazard, but he had long since
realized that for success on the high-toby, as on the field of
battle, prudence and the elimination of the unnecessary risk is as
essential as courage. He had, you see, an orderly mind even in
disorderliness, probably resulting from the fact&mdash;to be read
in Mr Whitehead's 'Life' of him&mdash;that he had been bred up for
the law by his father, a prosperous Welsh farmer. For the rest, he
had found the law more amusing in the breach than in the practice,
and the open road more attractive than a musty attorney's
office.</p>

<p>He drew, then, alongside of the coach, and looked boldly in, as
any other traveller might have done. Nor was there anything of the
ruffian in his appearance to alarm those who might come under his
inspection. He was dressed with sedate elegance in a riding-suit of
grey, with silver lace, and the lustrous brown hair under his
three-cornered hat was neatly clubbed.</p>

<p>To his vexation, he found that the curtains of the chaise were
drawn, which would make his projected adventure more of a leap in
the dark than ever. But even as he looked one of the curtains was
whipped aside, and straining through the window came the head and
shoulders of as delicious a piece of young womanhood as ever the
captain&mdash;something of a dilettante in these matters&mdash;had
contemplated with satisfaction. She seemed a part of that sweet,
fragrant summer morning; at least, she found in it a very proper
setting. Her complexion, now somewhat pale, was as delicate as a
dog-rose; her eyes, which were very wide, were as blue as the
flawless sky overhead; her hair was an aureole of sunbeams; and, to
complete the lovely appeal of her, from parted lips came a cry for
assistance. On her shoulder he observed, in his swift,
comprehensive glance, a man's lean brown hand endeavouring to force
her back into the chaise.</p>

<p>'Help!' she cried to him. 'Help! Oh, sir, deliver me!'</p>

<p>'Deliver you?' says the captain, taken aback. 'To be sure I
will.' And then he added, 'I am the very angel of deliverance, so I
am!' which was neat and quick of him, although the humour of it
must of necessity escape her.</p>

<p>Another moment&mdash;time to pluck a barker from his
holster&mdash;and he was roaring 'Stand!' in his grandest manner to
the postboy.</p>

<p>The chaise rattled and creaked to a standstill, and the captain
swung down from the saddle and threw open the door with an air.
Here was romance, and it was for him to play his part in it. Out of
the chaise came a fiery buck, in fine clothes and a mighty temper,
using language that left no doubt that he must be either a great
gentleman or a pickpocket. Considering a certain raffishness that
hung about him and the deep-bitten lines in his face, which
advertised an age beyond the first seeming, the captain placed him
without hesitation outside the former class, and came promptly to
the conclusion that he could have no business on so fine a morning
in a chaise with that gracious little lady.</p>

<p>The froth of foulness being blown off, we come to the ale of his
opening interjection.</p>

<p>'Who the devil are you, sir, and what the devil d'ye mean
interfering between a gentleman and his wife?'</p>

<p>'I'm not his wife, sir!' cried the lady. 'Don't believe
him.'</p>

<p>'I shouldn't dream of doing so, indeed,' says Captain Evans. 'Be
good enough to honour me with your commands, ma'am, and depend upon
their instant execution. I take it you want to be rid of this
gentleman's company?'</p>

<p>'I do, sir&mdash;I do!' she cried, hands pressed fervently
together in appeal to this potential rescuer, and fear in her
glance.</p>

<p>'You hear the lady and you see,' said the captain. 'I hope
you'll not stop to argue.'</p>

<p>The buck swore most unbecomingly through his teeth, threatened
to do horrible things to this intruder, but kept his fierce eyes on
the gleaming barrel of the captain's pistol.</p>

<p>'Sink me now!' he ended. 'D'ye make yourself this lady's
champion?'</p>

<p>'It's a fine morning for knight-errantry, whatever.'</p>

<p>'Knight-errantry, d'ye say? Faugh! Look now! I don't know who
the devil you may be, but since you come so cursedly
interfering&mdash;&mdash;' He broke off and glared at the captain.
'Now, why the devil should I be taking you into our confidence?' he
wondered savagely.</p>

<p>'To save the lady the trouble,' suggested the captain.</p>

<p>'Knight-errantry!' sneered the buck again; and then a gleam of
inspiration came into his bold eyes. 'You play knight-errant with a
pistol! Faugh!'</p>

<p>'I'll play it with anything you please.'</p>

<p>The morning sun and the little lady had between them got into
the captain's blood, so that business was quite forgotten.</p>

<p>'Will you? Will you take a turn with me as one gentleman with
another, so that we may settle this matter of your unwarranted
intrusion in my affairs?'</p>

<p>'You mistake,' said the captain. 'It's the lady's affairs I'm
intruding in, and not unwarranted, but by her invitation,
whatever.'</p>

<p>The gentleman sneered.</p>

<p>'You are splitting straws.'</p>

<p>'Shall I be splitting your windpipe?' says Evans, without
heat.</p>

<p>'Let us to it, then,' says the gentleman.</p>

<p>'With all my heart.'</p>

<p>Thereupon the gentleman peeled off his laced coat and put it
across the window, so that it hung half on one side, half on the
other, of the open chaise door. The captain observed that it was a
mighty fine coat, and wondered from force of professional habit
what the pockets might contain.</p>

<p>Then the buck lugged out his small sword and stood waiting. The
captain's preparations were less elaborate. He restored his pistol
to its holster and came forward sword in hand. The little lady,
standing now in the door of the chaise, with fluttering bosom and
eyes in which fear was deepening into terror, cried out at
this.</p>

<p>'Oh, sir, oh, sir, why do you consent?'</p>

<p>'I am wondering myself, ma'am.'</p>

<p>'Get your pistol again, sir. He will surely kill you. He is a
dreadful&mdash;dreadful man.'</p>

<p>'The last one I killed was much dreadfuller&mdash;yes, indeed,'
said the captain. He lied in this for the sheer humour of it, for
in all his wild career he had never yet made himself guilty of
taking life. With that he made a leg very prettily. 'Are you ready,
sir? Then on guard, if you please.'</p>

<p>The buck flashed the lady a malicious glance&mdash;a glance
which said as plainly as words, 'I'll deal with you presently, my
girl, and you shall pay for having brought this upon me'&mdash;and
so fell on guard.</p>

<p>In his readiness to fight, the captain found confirmation of his
first judgement of the fellow as an adventurer embarking upon a
shady enterprise. A gentleman sure of himself and his position
would have taken any way but this to settle such a matter as the
present one. Further, this same readiness to fight argued a
confidence in himself based, no doubt, upon skill and experience.
Now, the captain was no less confident of his own powers, being
himself a considerable man of his hands; but he realized at once
that, unless this affair were to have in one way or the other an
issue more serious than he could desire, he must end it almost
before it were begun.</p>

<p>It was a trick that had done him good service aforetime, and it
did not fail him now. Scarcely had the blades touched each other in
the first engagement than the captain dropped his point, whirled it
under and round his opponent's hand, and then straightened his arm.
It was all done in one movement with the speed of lightning, and at
the end of it&mdash;almost before the fine gentleman realized that
a disengage had taken place&mdash;there was a foot or so of the
captain's blade well home in his sword-arm.</p>

<p>The fellow uttered a howl of pain and rage, and the sword
dropped from his nerveless hand. Captain Evans wiped his steel with
a dainty lace kerchief, then sheathed it, and tossed the
handkerchief away with an air. Then he addressed his adversary, who
was swearing and groaning and clamouring for help to staunch his
wound, all in one.</p>

<p>'I think, sir, you're lusty enough to help yourself,' said
he.</p>

<p>Thereupon our gallant, evidently in mortal terror lest he should
bleed to death, pulls a handkerchief from the breast of his shirt,
and, holding one corner of it in his teeth and the other in his
left hand, sets about putting a bandage about his arm, going down
on one knee by the side of the ditch for greater ease in doing
so.</p>

<p>'Ma'am,' said the captain, 'there's a scoundrel disposed of, and
you may continue your journey in peace. To ensure it I'll escort
you some part of the way, if you'll suffer me.'</p>

<p>'Oh, sir!' said she consentingly, whereupon the captain slammed
the door of the chaise, swung himself up into the saddle again, and
ordered the postboy to proceed.</p>

<p>But at the first crack of the whip up jumped the wounded buck,
suddenly realizing what was taking place. In expectation of this,
the captain had pulled his mare squarely across the road to bar the
other's way.</p>

<p>'My coat!' screams the other in a frenzy. 'My coat, sir, if you
please!'</p>

<p>Now, it seemed to Captain Evans, as it must seem to you, more
than ordinarily singular that a gentleman in the buck's position, a
gentleman who apparently had lost so much that morning, should be
so supremely concerned with the trifling loss of a coat. So
impressed, indeed, was the captain that when miss would have thrown
the gentleman his garment he interposed, and bade her retain it as
a keepsake.</p>

<p>'You're a deal too hot,' he informed the buck. 'You'll be the
better for a cooling.'</p>

<p>And with that rode off in the wake of the chaise, leaving our
fine gentleman in shirt and breeches, the incarnation of dismay and
rage.</p>

<p>A mile or so they may have ridden, miss ever and anon putting
her head from the window to cast a remark at her escort, and her
escort doing his best to answer her becomingly, when at last she
gave the order to halt.</p>

<p>'Sir,' she said, 'could you not tether your horse behind and
ride with me? I feel that I owe you explanations.'</p>

<p>'Madame,' quoth he, very gallantly, 'I could no more be guilty
of forcing a lady's confidence than of refusing so charming an
invitation.'</p>

<p>And he proceeded to do as she suggested.</p>

<p>'You'll think that I have behaved very oddly, sir, in claiming
your assistance,' she began, as soon as he was settled at her
side.</p>

<p>'Since dealing with the object of your trouble, ma'am, I think
the behaviour very natural. What I don't understand is how you came
to be running off with that fellow&mdash;for that, I suppose, was
the situation.'</p>

<p>Round eyes looked at him in enquiry, and also in surprise at his
penetration.</p>

<p>'He called himself your husband, ma'am,' the captain explained,
'which I took to be an anticipation of his hopes.'</p>

<p>'Oh, sir, I must tell you everything, and cast myself upon your
mercy. Perhaps you will then direct me how to act.'</p>

<p>With that she told her story&mdash;told it with downcast eyes
and troubled countenance, her hands listlessly folded in her lap.
The gentleman's name was Lake&mdash;Mr Julian Lake he called
himself&mdash;and, met by chance at Ranelagh in the first instance,
he had followed her down into the country to Petersfield, where she
dwelt with her guardian, Sir Henry Woodbridge. He had come into her
life in a moment of crisis. A young gentleman&mdash;whose name she
left out of her story&mdash;to whom she was promised in marriage,
and to whom she was deeply attached, had run off with a lady whose
identity she also refrained from disclosing. And then Mr Lake had
swooped down upon her, an impetuous whirlwind of a lover, with an
air of the great world about him to dazzle her, and, as women will
in her case, she had snatched at this chance of showing her false
lover how little she was troubled by his defection. With her
consent, Mr Lake had written to her guardian; and her guardian, for
reasons which he had omitted to disclose to her, had replied,
refusing to receive the fellow or countenance his suit. Thereupon
Mr Lake had proposed the elopement, and in despair she had
consented.</p>

<p>They had set out from Petersfield soon after dawn that day. Mr
Lake had made arrangements for their marriage at Guildford. But
with every mile that they rode together the sense of what she was
doing, and the fear of it, increased in the heart of Miss Helston,
until in the end, being fully if tardily awake to the folly of
entrusting her life to a man of whom, after all, she knew nothing,
and for whom she felt no more than a simulated affection, having
its roots in pique, she frankly told him so, and begged him to
order the chaise to be put about, and either to conduct her or send
her back to her guardian. It was then that Mr Lake revealed himself
for the adventurer that he really was. Miss Helston was&mdash;or
would be presently, on attaining full age, to which she was very
near&mdash;a lady of very considerable wealth, and so you conceive
the rage and chagrin begotten in the heart of our gentleman, who
had been congratulating himself upon the snug acquisition of her
fortune. His conduct had been abominable. He had allowed her to
perceive that he would stop at no violence short of murder to
compel her to carry out her undertaking to marry him, and but for
the captain's very timely arrival on the scene, Miss Heston
trembled to think what might have become of her.</p>

<p>It was a very moving tale, and Captain Evans, who was a little
prone to sentiment, was deeply touched. Then he grew practical.</p>

<p>'And what's to be done now?' quoth he.</p>

<p>Miss looked at him with those melting, questioning eyes of hers.
They had clattered through Godalming while her tale was a-telling,
and were holding amain on the road to Guildford, the unreflecting
postboy intent upon carrying out his original instructions, without
regard to the change of passengers that had taken place.</p>

<p>'What&mdash;what do you advise?' she asked pathetically.</p>

<p>'Why, that you carry out your earlier intention of returning to
Petersfield and your guardian. What else can you do,
whatever?&mdash;unless you have friends with whom you would prefer
to stay awhile until you can make your peace with Sir Henry.'</p>

<p>'No, no!' she said. 'I'll go back to him. I'll go back to
Petersfield.'</p>

<p>Greatly relieved, the captain gave the necessary order. The
chaise went about, and set out to return in its tracks. And then
the captain bethought him of that important engagement of his for
noon that day with the ostler of the Fox and Hounds at
Petersfield&mdash;an engagement blown out of his mind by the
events, and no longer to be kept with any degree of punctuality. It
was striking one as they clattered for the second time over the
cobbled streets of Godalming.</p>

<p>'I&mdash;I am very hungry' says miss pathetically. It was not a
cry to which a man of heart could close his ears. 'I haven't tasted
food today,' she added. And at that he called himself a brute, and
awoke to the fact that his own appetite was keen enough.</p>

<p>They drew up, by his order, at the Swan&mdash;a house at which
he was unknown&mdash;and in a private room which he commanded
above-stairs they sat down a half-hour later to the best dinner the
house could provide and a bottle of the landlord's best Burgundy.
Having drunk a generous share of it, Captain Evans came to account
the time well lost, and the business appointment at Petersfield a
matter of small consequence compared with the sweet delight of
protecting and ministering to this choice, helpless wisp of
womanhood. That satisfaction with things as they were was soon to
increase to thankfulness, and he was to see in all that had
happened the hand of Providence befriending him. It was the
chamberlain of the inn who came presently to enlighten him.</p>

<p>'I hear, sir,' he said, in the course of his ministrations,
'that the Portsmouth Road will be safer for travellers after today.
That pest of the highway, Captain Evans, is likely to be laid by
the heels before night.'</p>

<p>'And is that so?' says the captain, with sharp interest. 'Now,
that's mighty good hearing&mdash;yes, indeed.'</p>

<p>'You're right, sir. A gentleman just arrived from Petersfield
tells me that the sheriff and his men had spread a net for the
rascal, in which he must have been taken before this.'</p>

<p>The captain poured himself the remainder of the wine with a
steady hand.</p>

<p>'Yet what all the world knows Captain Evans himself may
discover,' said he.</p>

<p>'Too late for that, sir. He'll be took by now,' said the
chamberlain with confidence as he withdrew.</p>

<p>The captain raised his glass to pledge the lady who all
unconsciously had been the means of saving him from what he now
surmised to be a bait trapped for him by that scoundrel Tim. Aloud,
he toasted her safe return, a toast to which she responded almost
gaily.</p>

<p>Her spirits, too, had improved under the invigorating influence
of meat and wine, and the dark cloud that had hung over her since
morning began at last to lift. She took an optimistic view of the
future, and envisaged a return to Sir Henry's house without any
serious misgivings. When he knew all he would forgive the escapade.
What troubled her far more at the moment, she confessed, was how
adequately to return thanks to her preserver.</p>

<p>'You have been to me the best friend that ever I had,' she told
him, 'for you came to me in the hour of my greatest need, and never
hesitated to afford me your assistance.'</p>

<p>He looked into the dainty face, with its so delicate complexion
and eyes of blue, over which the lids were shyly and alluringly
fluttering, and heaved a sigh.</p>

<p>'I am thinking we have been good friends to each other,' said
he. 'It will be something for me to remember afterwards.'</p>

<p>'Afterwards?' says Miss.</p>

<p>'To be sure, afterwards&mdash;when you and I have gone our
separate ways again, having each of the other just the memory of
this day.'</p>

<p>'It will be a very grateful memory to me,' said she; and he saw
the faintest cloud gathering again about her eyes.</p>

<p>'And a sweet one to me,' said he, and sighed again.</p>

<p>Now, it may have been that sigh of his that touched her, or the
Burgundy that had emboldened her, or both working conjointly.</p>

<p>'We shall meet again, of course,' says she. 'We&mdash;we should
be friends after what has happened&mdash;after the way in which you
have befriended me.' And she looked at him with such ravishing
candour for a moment that he was put out of breath and out of
countenance.</p>

<p>'You&mdash;you make too much of the little service I have done
you,' said he, faltering.</p>

<p>She frowned, and as her eyes were lowered he observed a sudden
deepening of the colour in her cheeks, and realized how ungracious
his words must have sounded. She pushed back her chair and
rose.</p>

<p>'Miss Helston,' he exclaimed, 'you must not misunderstand.
I&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I do not, sir. Your honest sincerity is very charming to me
after what I have suffered at the hands of your sex. I could not
fail to appreciate it deeply.'</p>

<p>But the sarcasm in the words cut him sharply, the more sharply
because he must suffer it in silence. What was there he could
say?</p>

<p>She crossed to the window and looked out upon the sunlit
inn-yard. A coach came clattering into it at that moment.</p>

<p>'Shall we be resuming our journey, sir?' said she. 'We have some
way to ride&mdash;that is, if I may still count upon the honour of
the escort.'</p>

<p>He got to his feet.</p>

<p>'Now, why do you say that to me?' he growled, half resentfully,
'Can't you see that I would&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>Her sharp outcry interrupted him. She swung to him, showing a
white, scared face: her bosom raced.</p>

<p>'Sir Henry&mdash;my guardian!' she cried. 'He is here! He saw
me! And there are people with him!'</p>

<p>Captain Evans received the news with positive relief. It would
make an end to a situation that was beginning to occasion him some
anxiety.</p>

<p>'In that case, ma'am, your troubles will be at an end.'</p>

<p>'Will they?' She looked at him, and then the door opened, and
from the threshold a tall, lean, sardonic gentleman stood regarding
them with a smile that was not quite pleasant.</p>

<p>Captain Evans blenched. But it was not the sardonic countenance
of Sir Henry that occasioned his disorder; it was another face
perceived over Sir Henry's shoulder, the round, jolly face of Sir
Thomas Blount, the sheriff of the county; nor did he pause to think
under the moment's shock that his own face could not be as well
known to Sir Thomas as was Sir Thomas's to him. He saw that behind
the sheriff there were several men, and he accounted himself lost.
Somehow they had trapped him when he failed to walk into the trap
at Petersfield. Perhaps they had come upon Mr Lake, and he had
assisted them with information. With his glance he measured the
distance to the window, mentally calculated its height from the
ground, and strove to imagine what might await him in the inn-yard
should he take the desperate decision to go that way. Meanwhile the
drawling voice of Sir Henry Woodbridge&mdash;a voice that sorted
excellently with the gentleman's sardonic countenance&mdash;was
speaking.</p>

<p>'It would appear, then, that we arrive in time. I say it would
appear so. And for your sake, Mr Lake, I sincerely trust that
appearances do not deceive me, otherwise it will be for my friend
Sir Thomas Blount to deal with you.'</p>

<p>He sauntered forward. The more corpulent sheriff rolled after
him.</p>

<p>'Egad, yes, my buck,' gurgled the latter. 'Ye're caught
red-handed in the hideous act of abduction. I've heard of you. I
know something of your affairs, Mr Lake, and if you've had the
services of a parson with this lady I promise you it shall go hard
with you.'</p>

<p>Then forth trilled Miss Helston's laugh, and there was no
mistaking its naturalness and freedom from anxiety.</p>

<p>'Why, Sir Henry,' she addressed her guardian, 'this is not Mr
Lake&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Of course not,' sneered Sir Henry the sardonic, and from that
Captain Evans, whose courage had revived upon discovering that he
was not himself the object of the sheriff's pursuit, very promptly
took his course.</p>

<p>'My dear,' he said, on a note of romantic sorrow, 'what purpose
can it serve to deny my identity?'</p>

<p>'But&mdash;&mdash;' she began, and there she checked. Something
compelling in her preserver's glance interrupted her, and
imposed&mdash;almost seemed to beg&mdash;silent acquiescence. And
meanwhile there was Sir Henry sneering.</p>

<p>'No purpose at all, sir. You very foolishly left the gentleman's
letter behind you, Mary. It only remains for you to tell me whether
you are yet married, whether this'&mdash;and he waved a slender
hand towards the table from which they had risen&mdash;'was the
wedding feast which we so inconsiderately interrupt?'</p>

<p>'We are not, sir,' said the captain, and, remembering what she
had told him, added, 'We were to have been married at
Guildford.'</p>

<p>'I remember that you mentioned it in your letter, Mr Lake. I am
relieved by the tense you employ. It is very well for you, sir,
that you can place it in the subjunctive and conditional perfect.
My dear&mdash;&mdash;' He crooked his arm, and proffered it to his
ward, with something between mockery and command. Then, melting a
little from his sarcastic haughtiness, 'Come, child,' he added,
'you shall yet come to thank me for saving you in time from this
broken gamester.'</p>

<p>'Ay, ay; but are ye sure that you can take his word for't?'
broke in the bustling little sheriff. 'I've been bubbled once
today, when I should have been able to put my hand on that rascal
Evans&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I am sure that I can take hers,' Sir Henry interrupted. He
stood squarely before his errant ward, and looked into her pale
face with its troubled eyes, that were now aswim with tears. 'Tell
me, Mary&mdash;in a word, yes or no&mdash;are you married to
him?'</p>

<p>'No,' she faltered. 'I am not.'</p>

<p>'That is enough, then. Let us be going.'</p>

<p>'Faith, it may be enough for you, Sir Henry,' quoth the
officious Blount, 'but it is not enough for me. Abduction is a
serious crime, Mr Lake, as you shall learn. Fetch him along, my
lads,' he bade his men. 'We'll lodge him snugly in Guildford Gaol
for tonight. He's a poor substitute for Captain Evans, but we'll
take him along.'</p>

<p>At that she flung away from her guardian's arm, and came running
to her preserver, fear, misery, and bewilderment all blending in
the appealing eyes lifted to him.</p>

<p>'Oh, why&mdash;&mdash;' she was beginning, when again he checked
her.</p>

<p>'Believe me, my dear, Sir Thomas knows his business. Protests
would never avail to turn him aside from it. He is, as you observe,
a very conscientious and perspicacious gentleman. Pray let him have
his way without waste of words. Good-bye!'</p>

<p>He bore her hand to his lips, and felt it tremble almost
convulsively in his grasp. More than his actual words, his glance,
so pregnant with a meaning that she could not read, commanded her
silence, and&mdash;whatever else might baffle her&mdash;made her
realize that this was the course which he desired that things
should take.</p>

<p>And so they parted, she to return to Petersfield in her
guardian's coach, he to be haled away a prisoner in a hired chaise
to Guildford. Until they had left Godalming behind them, it had
been his dread lest Sir Thomas should summon and question the
postboy who had driven him that morning. Fortunately, the bustling
sheriff neglected that detail as of no account, never conceiving
that the postboy's story could do other than confirm the matter
which the runaways themselves did not attempt to deny.</p>

<p>Captain Evans spent the night in Guildford Gaol, wondering where
exactly his knight-errantry would land him. He was visited on the
following morning by the sheriff. Sir Thomas was not in the best of
humours.</p>

<p>'You are in luck, Mr Lake,' he said sourly.</p>

<p>'I've not yet perceived it,' said the captain.</p>

<p>'But you will. I cannot proceed against you unless Sir Henry
Woodbridge prosecutes, and Sir Henry declines to do so.'</p>

<p>The captain sighed relief.</p>

<p>'That's vastly kind of him.'</p>

<p>'Kind! He doesn't do it to be kind to you, sir. He declines to
prosecute because he realizes that to do so would be to blow upon
the fair fame of his ward, Miss Helston. Out of consideration for
the lady he must forgo demanding upon you the punishment you
deserve. It was a fortunate thing for you, my lad, that he overtook
you in time to prevent the marriage. If he had found her your wife,
I believe she would have been your widow by now. Sir Henry can be
mighty hot, for all his cool ways. Remember that, sir, and let it
serve as a warning to you in the future. And now be off. I've work
to do. I've to be on the heels of that damned tobyman Evans, who
gave me the slip yesterday, and you're partly to blame for
that.'</p>

<p>'Oh, Sir Thomas!' cried the captain, and his tone was pained. 'I
swear you do me an injustice there. It's no fault of mine if you
didn't gaol your highwayman.'</p>

<p>'It will be if you keep me talking here,' snapped Sir Thomas,
and on that departed.</p>

<p>Captain Evans went off in a hired chaise to Godalming once more,
and there sought his brother Will at the Black Boar. His arrival
startled Will out of the deep dejection into which he had sunk, and
he came to his feet with an oath at sight of his brother.</p>

<p>'How did you escape?' he cried.</p>

<p>'Escape?' echoed the captain. It was impossible that Will should
have knowledge of his adventure. 'Escape what?'</p>

<p>'The trap that was laid for you at Petersfield.'</p>

<p>'Trap! Was it a trap?'</p>

<p>'Of course it was. That scoundrel Tim had sold you to the
sheriff, and his men were waiting for you until night at the Fox
and Hounds. Indeed, for all I know, they may be waiting for you
still. Gadslife, Tom, I'd forsaken all hope of ever seeing you
again. Where have you been?'</p>

<p>'With the sheriff,' says the captain.</p>

<p>'With the sheriff?'</p>

<p>'Ay&mdash;Sir Thomas Blount. I slept at Guildford Gaol, and
parted from him there two hours ago. Let me explain.'</p>

<p>'I confess it's necessary.'</p>

<p>The captain told his story. 'So that, you see,' he ended, 'what
time the sheriff and his men were waiting to take me, there was I
safely hidden in the sheriff's own hands. Humorous, wasn't it?'</p>

<p>But Will was blind to the humour of it. He looked reproachfully
at his brother.</p>

<p>'I suppose this ninny of a runaway girl beglamoured you, till
you nearly lost your neck in the business.'</p>

<p>"Pon my soul, Will, that's ungracious, seeing that she saved
me.'</p>

<p>'Saved you? Pshaw! If you hadn't allowed her to get you into
danger there would have been no need for her to have saved you.
You're an incorrigible sentimentalist.'</p>

<p>'I admit it. But it's been the salvation of me this time. And
you're not to suppose that I neglected business completely. You'll
remember that I came off with Mr Lake's coat.'</p>

<p>'Oh, Lake's coat!' sneered Will.</p>

<p>The captain dropped a bag of soft leather on the table. It
squelched down with a melodious chink.</p>

<p>'There's fifty guineas in that; it was in one of his pockets.
And here's a snuff-box&mdash;a pretty thing of gold and brilliants
worth at least half as much. I thought I'd like it as a keepsake.
Perhaps I am a sentimentalist.'</p>

<p>Will was mollified.</p>

<p>'But you've nothing of the girl's,' he complained.</p>

<p>'Nothing&mdash;tangible,' said the captain, and sighed. 'After
all, you're no doubt right. I am an incorrigible sentimentalist. I
must be.' And he sighed again.</p>

<h2><a name="ch8" id="ch8"></a>DUROC</h2>

<h3><i>Weekly Tale-Teller</i>, October 1915</h3>

<p>Duroc came down the Rue de la Harpe so stealthily that his steps
scarcely made a sound. He moved like a shadow, and when at last he
came to a halt before the house of the Citizen Representative
Clairvaux it was as if he had totally effaced himself, as if he had
become part of the general gloom.</p>

<p>There he paused considering, his chin in his hand; and perhaps
because the ground-floor windows were equipped with bars, he moved
on more stealthily than ever along the garden wall. Midway between
two of the lanterns slung across the narrow street and shedding a
feeble yellow light he paused again.</p>

<p>He stood now at a point where the shadows were deepest. He
listened intently for a moment, peered this way and that into the
night, and then went over the wall with the swift silent activity
of an ape. He found the summit of that wall guarded by a row of
iron spikes, and on one of these, for all his care, Duroc left a
strip of his breeches.</p>

<p>The accident annoyed him. He cursed all <em>chevaux de
frise</em>, pronouncing them a damnably aristocratic institution to
which no true patriot could be guilty of having recourse. Indeed
from the manner in which the Citizen Representative Clairvaux
guarded his house it was plain to Duroc that the fellow was a bad
republican. What with bars on its windows and spikes on its walls,
the place might have been a prison rather than the house of a
representative of the august people. Of course, as Duroc well knew,
the Citizen Representative had something to guard. It was notorious
that this modest dwelling of his in the Rue de la Harpe was
something of a treasure-house, stored with the lootings of many a
<em>ci-devant</em> nobleman's property, and it was being whispered
that no true patriot&mdash;and a Citizen Representative into the
bargain&mdash;could have suffered himself to amass such wealth in
the hour of the nation's urgent need.</p>

<p>Duroc advanced furtively across the garden, scanning the silent,
sleeping house. Emboldened by the fact that no light or faintest
sign of vigilance showed anywhere, he proceeded so adroitly that
within five minutes he had opened a window and entered a room that
was used by the deputy as his study.</p>

<p>Within that room he stood quite still, and listened. Save for
the muffled ticking of a clock no sound disturbed the silence. He
turned and very softly drew the heavy curtains across the window.
Then he sat down upon the floor, took a small lantern from his
breast and a tinder-box from his waistcoat pocket. There was the
sharp stroke of steel on flint, and presently his little lantern
was shedding a yellow disc of light upon the parquetry floor.</p>

<p>He rose softly, placed the light on a console, and crossed the
room to the door which stood half open. He listened again a moment
then closed the door and came back, his feet making no sound upon
the thick and costly rugs that were flung here and there.</p>

<p>In mid-chamber he paused, looking about him, and taking stock of
his luxurious surroundings. He considered the painted panels, the
inlaid woods, the gilded chairs and the ormolu-encrusted
cabinets&mdash;all plundered from the hotels of <em>ci-devants</em>
who were either guillotined or in flight, and he asked himself if
it was in this sybaritic fashion that it became a true republican
to equip his home.</p>

<p>He was a short, slender man, this Duroc, whose shabby brown
garments looked the worse for the rent in his breeches. He wore a
fur bonnet, and his lank black hair hung in wisps about his cheeks
and neck. His face was white and wolfish, the jaw thrust forward
and ending in a lean square chin; his vigilant quick-moving eyes
were close-set and beady as a rat's; his thin lips were curled now
in a sneer as he considered the luxury about him.</p>

<p>But that attitude of his was momentary. Duroc had not come there
to make philosophy but to accomplish a purpose, and to this he
addressed himself forthwith. He took up his lantern, and crossed to
a tall secretaire that was a very gem of the court-finisher's art
in the days of Louis XIV. Setting the lantern on top of it, he drew
from his pocket a bunch of skeleton keys, gripping them firmly so
that they should not rattle. He stooped to examine the lock, and
then on the instant came upright again, stiff and tense in his
sudden alarm.</p>

<p>A knock had fallen upon the street door, and the echo of it went
reverberating through the silent house.</p>

<p>Duroc's lips writhed as he breathed an oath.</p>

<p>The knock was repeated, more insistent now. To the listening
Duroc came the sound of a window being thrown up. He heard voices,
one from above, the other replying from the street, and guessed
that the awakened Clairvaux was challenging this midnight visitor
before coming down to open.</p>

<p>Perhaps he would not come. Perhaps he would dismiss this
inopportune intruder. But that hope was soon quenched. The window
rasped down again, and a moment later the flip-flop of slippered
feet came shuffling down the stairs and along the passage to the
door. A key grated and a chain clanked&mdash;this Clairvaux made a
Bastille of his dwelling&mdash;and then voices sounded in the
passage. The door of the house closed with a soft thud. Steps and
voices approached the room in which Duroc still stood immoveable,
listening.</p>

<p>At last he stirred, realizing that he had not a moment to spare
if he would escape detection. He turned, so that his back was to
the door, snatched up his lantern and pressed it against his
breast, so that while it might still light him forward, its rays
should not strike backwards to betray him. Then in three strides he
gained the shelter of the heavy velvet curtains that masked the
window. Behind them, his back to the casement, he extinguished at
last the light.</p>

<p>The door opened an instant later. Indeed had Clairvaux who
entered, candle in hand, in nightcap and quilted dressing-gown,
bestowed an attentive look upon the curtains he would have detected
the quiver that still agitated them. After him came a tall young
man in a long black riding-coat and a conical hat that was
decorated by a round tricolour cockade to advertise his patriotic
sentiments. Under his arm he carried a riding-whip, whose
formidable quality as a weapon of offence was proclaimed by its
round head in plaited leather with silver embellishments. He placed
it upon a table beside his hat, and the thud with which it dropped
to the wood further announced its quality.</p>

<p>The Citizen Representative, a short, stiffly built man whose
aquiline face was not without some resemblance to that of his
visitor, flung himself into a gilt armchair upholstered in blue
silk near the secretaire that but a moment ago had been the object
of Duroc's attention. He threw one knee over the other and drew his
quilted dressing-gown about his legs.</p>

<p>'Well?' he demanded, his voice harsh. 'What is this important
communication that brings you here at such an hour as this?'</p>

<p>The man in the riding-coat sauntered across to the fireplace. He
set his back to the overmantel, and the ormolu clock with its
cupids by Debureau, and faced the deputy with a smile that was
almost a sneer.</p>

<p>'Confess now,' he said, 'that but for your uneasy conscience, my
cousin, you would have hesitated to admit me. But you live in the
dread of your own misdeeds, with the blade of the guillotine like a
sword of Damocles suspended above you, and you dare refuse no
man&mdash;however unwelcome in himself&mdash;who may be the
possible bearer of a warning.' He laughed an irritating laugh of
mockery.</p>

<p>'Name of a name,' growled the deputy, 'will you tell me what
brings you, without preamble?'</p>

<p>'You do not like preambles? And a representative! Now that is
odd! But there, Etienne, to put it shortly, I am thinking of
emigrating.'</p>

<p>It was the deputy's turn to become mocking.</p>

<p>'It was worth while being aroused at midnight to hear such
excellent news. Emigrate by all means, my dear Gustave. France will
be well rid of you.'</p>

<p>'And you?' quoth Gustave.</p>

<p>'And I no less.' The deputy grinned sardonically.</p>

<p>'Ah!' said his cousin. 'That is excellent. In such a case, no
doubt, you will be disposed to pay for the privilege. To carry out
this plan of mine I need your assistance, Etienne. I am practically
penniless.'</p>

<p>'Now that is a thousand pities.' The deputy's voice became
almost sympathetic, yet slurred by a certain note of sarcasm. 'If
you are penniless, so am I. What else did you expect in a member of
the National Convention? Did you conceive that a representative of
the sacred people&mdash;an apostle of Liberty, Equality, and
Fraternity&mdash;could possibly have money at his disposal? Ah, my
good cousin, I assure you that all that I possessed has been
offered up on the sacred altar of the nation.'</p>

<p>Gustave looked at him, and pursed his lips. 'You had better
reserve that for the National Assembly,' he said. 'It may sound
convincing from the rostrum. Here&mdash;&mdash;' he waved a hand
about him at all the assembled splendours, 'it sounds uncommonly
like a barefaced lie.'</p>

<p>The deputy rose with overwhelming dignity, his brows
contracted.</p>

<p>'This to me?' he demanded.</p>

<p>'Why not?' wondered Gustave. 'Come, come, Etienne. I am not a
child, nor yet a fool. You are a man of wealth&mdash;all the world
knows it, as you may discover to your cost one fine morning. These
are days of fraternity, and I am your cousin&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Out of my house,' the deputy broke in angrily. 'Out of my house
this instant.'</p>

<p>Gustave looked at him with calm eyes. 'Shall I then go and tell
the National Assembly what I know of you? Must I denounce you to
the Committee of Public Safety as a danger to the nation? Must I
tell them that in secret you are acting as an agent of the emigrs,
that you plot the overthrow of the august republic?'</p>

<p>Clairvaux's face was livid, his eyes were bulging. He mastered
himself by an effort. 'Denounce all you please,' he answered in a
suffocating voice. 'You'll leave your own head in the basket.
Sainte Guillotine! you fool, am I a man of straw to be overthrown
by the denunciations of such a thing as you? Do you think to
frighten me with threats of what you will do? Do you think that is
the way to obtain assistance from me?'</p>

<p>'Seeing that no other way is possible,' flashed Gustave.</p>

<p>'Out of my house. Go, denounce me! Go to the devil! But out of
here with you!'</p>

<p>'Take care, Etienne!' The other was breathing hard, and his eyes
flamed with anger&mdash;the anger of the baffled man. 'I am
desperate, I am face to face with ruin. I need but a thousand
francs&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Not a thousand sous, not a single sou from me. Be off!' And
Clairvaux advanced threateningly upon his cousin. 'Be off!' He
caught him by the lapels of his riding-coat.</p>

<p>'Don't dare to touch me!' Gustave warned him, his voice
shrilling suddenly.</p>

<p>But the deputy, thoroughly enraged by now, tightened his grip,
and began to thrust the other towards the door. Gustave put out a
hand to the table where his hat and whip were lying, and his
fingers closed upon that ugly riding-crop of his. The rest had
happened almost before he realized it; it was the blind action of
suddenly overwhelming fury. He twisted out of his cousin's grasp,
stepped back, holding that life-preserver by its slender extremity,
swung it aloft and brought the loaded end whistling down upon the
deputy's nightcapped head.</p>

<p>There was a horrible sound like the crunching of an egg-shell,
and the Citizen Representative dropped, fulminated by the blow, and
lay in a shuddering, twitching heap, whilst the colour of this
nightcap changed slowly from white to crimson under the murderer's
staring eyes.</p>

<p>Gustave stood there, bending over the fallen man, motionless
while you might count ten. His face was leaden and his mouth
foolishly open between surprise and horror of the thing he had
done.</p>

<p>Not a sound disturbed the house; not a groan, not a movement
from the fallen man. Nothing but the muffled ticking of the ormolu
clock and the buzzing of a fly that had been disturbed. Still
Gustave stood there in that half-crouching attitude, terror gaining
upon him with every throb of his pulses. And then quite suddenly a
voice cut sharply upon the stillness.</p>

<p>'Well?' it asked. 'And what do you propose to do now?'</p>

<p>Gustave came erect, stifling a scream, to confront the white
face and beady eyes of Duroc, who stood considering him between the
parted curtains.</p>

<p>In a long silence he stared, his wits working briskly the
while.</p>

<p>'Who are you?' he asked at last, his voice a hoarse whisper.
'How come you here? What are you? Ah! A thief&mdash;a
housebreaker!'</p>

<p>'At least,' said Duroc drily, 'I am not a murderer.'</p>

<p>'My God!' said Gustave, and his wild eyes turned again upon that
tragically grotesque mass that lay at his feet. 'Is he&mdash;is he
dead?'</p>

<p>'Unless his skull is made of iron,' said Duroc. He came forward
in that swift, noiseless fashion of his, and dropped on one knee
beside the deputy. He made a brief examination. 'The Citizen
Representative represents a corpse,' he said. 'He is as dead as
King Capet.' He rose. 'What are you going to do?' he asked
again.</p>

<p>'To do?' said Gustave. 'Mon Dieu! What is there to do? If he is
dead&mdash;&mdash;' He checked. His knavish wits were racing now.
He looked into the other's round black eyes. 'You'll not betray
me,' he cried. 'You dare not. You are in no better case than I. And
there is no one else in the house. He lived all alone. He was a
miserly dog, and the old woman who serves him will not be here
until morning.'</p>

<p>Duroc was watching him intently, almost without appearing to
observe him. He saw the man's fingers suddenly tighten upon the
life-preserver with which already he had launched one man across
the tide of the Styx that night.</p>

<p>'Put that thing down,' he commanded sharply, 'put it down at
once, or I'll send you after your cousin.' And Gustave found
himself covered by a pistol.</p>

<p>Instantly he loosed the grip of his murderous weapon. It fell
with a crash beside the body of the man it had slain.</p>

<p>'I meant you no harm,' panted Gustave. 'Do you know what wealth
he hoards in these consoles, in that secretaire? You do, for that
is what you came for. Well, take it, take it all. But let me go,
let me get away from this. I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;' He seemed to
stifle in his terror.</p>

<p>Duroc's lipless mouth distended in a smile.</p>

<p>'Am I detaining you?' he asked. 'Faith, you didn't suppose I was
going to drag you to the nearest <em>corps-de-garde</em>, did you?
Go, man, if you want to go. In your place I should have gone
already.'</p>

<p>Gustave stared at him almost incredulously, as if doubting his
own good fortune. Then suddenly perceiving the motives that swayed
the other, and asking nothing better for himself than to be gone,
he turned and without another word fled from the room and the
house, his one anxiety to put as great a distance between himself
and his crime as possible.</p>

<p>Duroc watched that sudden scared flight, still smiling. Then he
coolly crossed the room, took up the dead man's candle and placed
it upon the secretaire. He pulled up a chair&mdash;there was no
longer any need to proceed with caution&mdash;sat down, and
producing his keys and a chisel-like instrument he went diligently
to work to get at the contents of this secretaire.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Gustave had gone like a flash the length of the Rue de
la Harpe, driven ever by his terror of the consequences of his
deed. But as he neared the corner of the Cordeliers he was brought
suddenly to a halt by the measured tread of approaching steps. He
knew it at once for the march of a patrol, and his consciousness of
what he had done made him fearful of meeting these servants of the
law who might challenge him and demand to know whence he was and
whither he went at such an hour&mdash;for the new reign of
universal liberty had imposed stern limitations upon individual
freedom.</p>

<p>He vanished into the darkness of a doorway, and crouched there
to wait until those footsteps should have faded again into the
distance. And it was in those moments as he leaned there panting
that his fiendishly wicked notion first assailed him. He turned it
over in his mind, and in the gloom you might have caught the gleam
of his teeth as he smiled evilly to himself.</p>

<p>He was his cousin's heir. Could he but fasten the guilt of that
murder upon the thief he had left so callously at work in the very
room where the body lay, then never again need he know want. And
the thief, being a thief, deserved no less. He had no doubt at all
but that the fellow would never have hesitated to do the murder had
it been forced upon him by circumstances. He reflected further, and
realized how aptly set was the stage for such a comedy as he had in
mind. Had not that fool compelled him to drop the very weapon with
which the deputy's skull had been smashed?</p>

<p>No single link was missing in the chain of complete evidence
against the thief. Gustave realized that here was a chance sent him
by friendly fortune. Tomorrow it would be too late. In seeking his
cousin's murderer the authorities would ascertain that he was the
one man who stood to profit by the Citizen Representative's death,
and having discovered that they would compel him to render an
account of his movements that night. They would cross-question and
confound him, seeing that he could give no such account as they
would demand.</p>

<p>He was resolved. He must act at once. Not three minutes had sped
since he had left that house, and it was impossible that in the
meantime the thief could have done his work and taken his
departure.</p>

<p>And so upon that fell resolve he flung out of his concealment,
and ran on up the street towards the Cordeliers, to meet the
advancing patrol, shouting as he went&mdash;</p>

<p>'Au voleur! Au voleur!'</p>

<p>He heard the patrol quickening their steps in response to his
cry, and presently he found himself face to face with four men of
the National Guard, who, as it chanced, were accompanied by an
agent of the section in civilian dress and scarf of office.</p>

<p>'Down there,' he cried, pointing back down the street. 'A thief
has broken into the house of my cousin&mdash;my cousin the Citizen
Representative Clairvaux.' He gathered importance, he knew, from
this proclamation of his relationship with one of the great ones of
the Convention.</p>

<p>But the agent of the section paused to question him.</p>

<p>'Why did you not follow him, citizen?'</p>

<p>'I am without weapons, and I bethought me he would probably be
armed. Besides I heard you approaching in the distance, and I
thought it best to run to summon you, that thus we may make sure of
taking him.'</p>

<p>The agent considered him, his white face&mdash;seen in the light
of the lantern carried by the patrol&mdash;his shaking limbs and
gasping speech, and concluded he had to deal with an arrant coward,
nor troubled to dissemble his contempt.</p>

<p>'Name of a name!' he growled, 'and meanwhile the Citizen
Representative may have been murdered in his bed.'</p>

<p>'I pray not! Oh, I pray not!' panted Gustave. 'Quickly,
citizens, quickly! Terrible things may happen while we stand
here.'</p>

<p>They went down the street at a run to the house of Clairvaux,
whose door they found open as Gustave had left it when he
departed.</p>

<p>'Where did he break in?' asked one of the guards.</p>

<p>'By the door,' said Gustave. 'He had keys, I think. Oh,
quick!'</p>

<p>In the passage he perceived a faint gleam of light to assure him
that the thief was still at work. He swung round to them, and
raised a hand. 'Quietly!' he whispered. 'Quietly, so that we do not
disturb him.'</p>

<p>The patrol thrust forward, and entered the house in his wake. He
led them straight towards the half-open door of the study, from
which the light was issuing as if to guide them. He flung wide the
door, and entered, whilst the men crowding after him came to a
sudden halt upon the threshold in sheer amazement at what they
beheld.</p>

<p>At their feet lay the body of the Citizen Representative
Clairvaux in a raiment that in itself seemed to proclaim how
hastily he had risen from his bed to come and deal with this
midnight intruder; and there at the secretaire, now open, its
drawers broken and their contents scattered all about the floor,
sat Duroc, white-faced, his beady rat's eyes considering them.</p>

<p>Gustave broke into lamentations at sight of his cousin's
body.</p>

<p>'We are too late! Mon Dieu! We are too late! He is
dead&mdash;dead. And look! Here is the weapon with which he was
slain. And there sits the murderer&mdash;caught in the very
act&mdash;caught in the very act. Seize him! Ah,
<em>sclrat</em>,' he raged, shaking his fist in the thief's
white, startled face. 'You shall be made to pay for this!'</p>

<p>'Comedian!' said Duroc shortly.</p>

<p>'Seize him! Seize him!' cried Gustave in a frenzy.</p>

<p>The guards sprang across the room, and laid hands upon Duroc to
prevent him having recourse to any weapons.</p>

<p>Duroc looked up at them, blinking. The his eyes shifted to
Gustave, and suddenly he laughed.</p>

<p>'Now see what a fool a man is who will not seize the chances
that are offered him,' he said. 'After that scoundrel had
bludgeoned his cousin to death I bade him go. He might have made
good his escape, and I should have said no word to betray him.
Instead he thinks to make me his scapegoat.'</p>

<p>He shrugged, and rose under the hands of his captors. Then he
pulled his coat open, and displayed a round leaden disc of the size
of a five-franc piece bearing the arms of the republic.</p>

<p>At sight of it the hands that had been holding him instantly
fell away.</p>

<p>The agent of the section stepped forward frowning.</p>

<p>'What does this mean?' he asked, but on a note that was almost
of respect, realizing that he stood in the presence of an officer
of the secret service of the republic, whom no man might detain
save at his peril.</p>

<p>'I am Duroc of the Committee of Public Safety,' was the quiet
answer. 'The Executive had cause to doubt that the Citizen
Representative Clairvaux was in correspondence with the enemies of
France. I came secretly to examine his papers and to discover who
are his correspondents. Here is what I sought.' And he held up a
little sheaf of documents which he had separated from the rest. 'I
will wish you good-night, citizens. I must report at once to the
Citizen-Deputy Marat. Since that fellow has come back take him to
the Luxembourg. Let the committee of the section deal with him
tomorrow. I shall forward my report.'</p>

<p>Gustave shook himself out of his sudden paralysis to make a dash
for the door. But the guards closed with him, and held him fast,
whilst Duroc of the Committee of Public Safety passed out, with
dignity in spite of his torn breeches.</p>

<h2><a name="ch9" id="ch9"></a>KYNASTON'S RECKONING</h2>

<h3>Premier Magazine, November 1914</h3>

<p>Under the date of the 18th August 1660, you will find the
following entry in the diary of Mr Samuel Pepys: 'Captain Ferrers
took me to the Cockpitt play, the first that I have had time to see
since my coming from sea, "The Loyall Subject," where one Kinaston,
a boy, acted the duke's sister, but made the loveliest lady that
ever I saw in my life.'</p>

<p>Edward Kynaston was short of stature, and of a lithe and
stripling grace, golden-headed, with a milk-and-rose complexion
that any woman might have envied, and a countenance so delicately
beautiful that it provoked from Mr Pepys the above ejaculation,
and, further (on the 2nd of January following), this tribute: '...I
and my wife to the theatre, and there saw "The Silent Woman." Among
other things there Kinaston, the boy, had the good turn to
appear...in fine clothes, and in them was clearly the prettiest
woman in the house.'</p>

<p>This Kynaston had been discovered by Sir William
Davenant&mdash;the same who boasted himself to be the son of Master
William Shakespeare&mdash;and such were his histrionic gifts and
personal beauty that even when women were admitted at last to the
English stage he continued for some time thereafter to be entrusted
with the principal female roles, since no woman could be found to
compare with him in the performance of them.</p>

<p>Some years later (on the 9th February, 1669) we find Mr Pepys
writing as follows: 'To the King's Playhouse, and there saw "The
Island Princesse," which I like mighty well as an excellent play;
and here we find Kinaston to be well enough to act again; which he
did very well after his beating by Sir Charles Sedley's
appointment.'</p>

<p>It is with this beating and its consequences that my story is
concerned. Ned Kynaston was by now in his twenty-second year, and
whilst he was still engaged in the main for female parts, yet upon
occasion he would play the youthful gallant&mdash;and have every
woman in the house enamoured of him.</p>

<p>In what way Sedley offended him we do not know, nor does it
greatly matter. We do know that Sedley was very prodigal of
offence, and although at this time a man well advanced in the
forties, yet age had not sobered him or given him dignity. He was
still quite the most outrageous of all the rakes about the court of
that prince of rakes, their sovereign. The audacity of his
intrigues was second only to that of his royal master. It has been
made the subject of a lampoon by his brother rake, my Lord
Rochester. Once when, as a result of what Anthony Wood calls his
'indecent and blasphemous behaviour', he had raised a riot in the
Cock Tavern in Covent Garden, and had been haled, together with my
Lord Buckhurst and some others, before Sir Robert Hyde&mdash;Lord
Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, sitting in Westminster
Hall&mdash;Sir Robert caustically commended to him the perusal of a
book entitled <em>The Compleat Gentleman</em>&mdash;a
recommendation which galled him worse than the fine of 500 by
which it was accompanied.</p>

<p>Pepys, too, tells us of a 'frolic and debauchery' of Sedley's
and Buckhurst's, 'running up and down all the night, almost naked
in the streets, and at last fighting and being beat by the watch
and clapped up all night.'</p>

<p>It is not difficult to conceive that so turbulent a rake may
have got foul of the players at the King's Theatre, and thus
provoked Kynaston. Be that as it may, Kynaston chose to appear on
the stage made up in so life-like a portrait of Sir Charles, and so
naturally counterfeiting his accent and his posturings, that the
whole house was convulsed with it when it had assured itself that
it was not Sir Charles himself who strutted there upon the
boards.</p>

<p>You imagine, I hope, the fine passion into which Sedley was
flung when he knew of it. Those who overheard his threats to have
the actor's life say that he foamed at the mouth in uttering them.
But he did not take the direct way to achieve his purpose expected
by those who were witnesses of his ravings. He did not send his
friends and the length of his sword to Kynaston. How could he?
Blackguard though he was by instinct and behaviour, it yet remained
that by birth he was a gentleman; and it could not have become a
gentleman to have so forgotten what was due to himself as to have
condescended to cross swords with a rogue and a vagabond of an
actor. Besides, Kynaston, for all his slight frame and almost
womanish beauty, was of an extremely virile spirit, and of a
singular address in all the exercises of his age. He
played&mdash;as indeed you shall see&mdash;as pretty a rapier as
any man in these islands.</p>

<p>So Sir Charles took another way&mdash;the way of the gentleman
with the plebeian. He sent a couple of hired bullies to waylay
Kynaston in the park one morning. They fell upon him, broke his
sword with their cudgels, and so belaboured him that he was left
almost for dead when they made off before the advent of those who
ran belatedly to the poor actor's assistance.</p>

<p>Such was the resentment of town and Court&mdash;for Kynaston was
a universal favourite&mdash;that for once the King frowned upon one
of those who modelled their conduct upon his own august pattern.
But beyond a transient coolness, his Majesty did not see fit to
visit any other punishment upon Sedley, and Kynaston, seeing that
there was none to avenge him, considered, so soon as he was
restored to health, how best he might avenge himself.</p>

<p>The cowardly assault had raised in him such a thirst for
vengeance as naught but Sedley's blood could assuage. He must take
steps to make it impossible for the rake to do aught but set aside
his gentleman's estate and measure swords with him; that much
accomplished, at whatever cost or consequences, Kynaston was
resolved to kill him without mercy.</p>

<p>He was about his murderous purpose on that sunny February
morning on which Sir Lionel Faversham tells us that he met him
outside the Dolphin in the Strand. He was dressed in a black camlet
suit, very sober and simple, yet of an elegance that heighted his
distinguished air. 'Actor though he was,' says Faversham, 'I'll
swear that no courtlier figure might you see in Whitehall.'</p>

<p>Faversham found him pacing there like a sentry, with a heavy
riding-whip tucked under his arm.</p>

<p>'Whither away, Ned?' he greeted him.</p>

<p>Kynaston tossed his golden curls, and with his whip he pointed
across to the Dolphin.</p>

<p>'I am staying for Sir Charles Sedley,' he replied in that gentle
and wonderfully musical voice of his. 'If you'll tarry here awhile,
you'll see a reckoning paid, and a rakehell carried home to bed.
'Twill divert you, Sir Lionel.'</p>

<p>'Odds my life, lad! Are ye clean mad?' cried Faversham.</p>

<p>Having a very real affection for the young man, and foreseeing
for him the worst possible consequences from such an affair, he set
himself urgently to turn him from his purpose. They wrangled there
awhile, and in the end, Sir Lionel's good sense prevailing,
Kynaston suffered himself to be led away. Faversham carried him off
to his own lodging in King Street, and kept him there out of
mischief until the morrow. By then the actor's rage had so far
cooled that he lent an ear to the reasonable counsel of his
host.</p>

<p>'I'll be advised by you, Sir Lionel,' he said at parting, 'and I
abandon all thought of repaying him in his own coin. 'Tis stupid
currency when all is said. Yet, sink me, it shall be the worse for
him! For you are not to suppose that I shall forgo the reckoning.
I'll present it in another form, and, when I do, you shall see
Sedley pilloried to the mock of the town.'</p>

<p>Faversham accounted all this to be no more than the vapourings
of a histrionic temperament, the last flicker of the flame of the
actor's resentment; and he deemed himself confirmed in this
judgement when, as the weeks went by, the whole affair was
permitted by Kynaston to fall into oblivion. Confidently he
accounted the incident closed, which but shows that, despite his
friendship for Kynaston, his knowledge of him did not go very
deep.</p>

<p>It would be about a month after these events that town and Court
were set agog by the advent of a new beauty at Whitehall in the
person of Caroline Countess of Chesterham. Her coming had been
heralded in advance in a letter from the septuagenarian Lord
Chesterham to his old friend Faversham, who had been cornet of
horse in a regiment commanded by his lordship at Naseby. He wrote
from the remote wilds of Cornwall, whither he had retreated some
years before, to announce that he had married a young wife.</p>

<p>What the town said of it is neither here nor there, and, in any
case, is very readily imagined. Also, it is readily imagined with
what curiosity the town looked forward to his announced visit, and
to see this girl whose beauty he extolled at such length in another
letter addressed to Lady Denham. His lordship wrote that, although
he had never thought to forsake his hermitage again, yet having
taken so young a bride he was sensible of the duty that he owed
her, and that since it was her desire to see something of the great
world, he could not find it in his heart to deny her.</p>

<p>A handsome house was made ready for them in Pall Mall by a
steward, and a posse of servants sent ahead. And a few days later
the news was put about that they had arrived.</p>

<p>Among the first to pay their devoirs were, of course, Sir Lionel
Faversham and Sir John and Lady Denham. To receive them they found,
however, none but the bride, installed in a nobly proportioned
drawing-room whose windows looked out upon the park.</p>

<p>They had naturally assumed from his lordship's letters that she
would be country-bred, but they found little to confirm the
assumption in her appearance and her manners. She was of striking,
of superb beauty&mdash;tall, straight, and slender, with a carriage
of such grace and supple dignity that a queen might have been proud
of it. If a fault there was in that glorious, gipsy-tinted face it
was that it too closely matched her bearing. It was cold and proud,
and it derived a something almost of boldness from the steady
glance of her magnificent sombre eyes. Her gown was in the very
latest mode of France, and her abundant, lustrous black hair,
intertwined with a string of pearls, was dressed in the very
noontide of fashion, whilst a round black patch&mdash;that very
latest of fashion's mad conceits&mdash;sat roguishly upon her chin,
and yet another on her cheek 'neath her left eye. Her voice was low
and cultured and very rich, and none could have been more
infinitely and nobly at ease than she when she explained the
absence of her septuagenarian bridegroom.</p>

<p>She informed her visitors that within ten miles of town they had
been overtaken by a courier, who brought them word that his
lordship's brother had a seizure, and was not expected to live,
whereupon his lordship had gone posting back at once, leaving his
wife to end the journey alone and to await him in London, whither
he would follow as soon as might be. She brought a little note from
him to Lady Denham, in which he implored the latter's good offices
of her&mdash;a charge which Lady Denham very amiably accepted,
entirely ravished by the grace and dignity of Lady Chesterham.</p>

<p>Faversham tells us that he withdrew perturbed in spirit. He had
conceived his old friend to have committed the regrettable
imprudence of giving rein to an infatuation for some rustic Hebe,
whereas instead he was driven to fear that he had fallen a prey to
an adventuress of talent, who would not be long in covering him
with that ridicule which so often falls to the lot of the old man
who marries a young wife&mdash;the Pantaloon in the Comedy of
Life.</p>

<p>The events most certainly nourished these fears of his, and did
credit to his discernment. Presented at Whitehall by Lady Denham,
Lady Chesterham created a greater sensation than in its day had
been caused by the advent there of Barbara Palmer. Her triumph was
to be read in the hostility with which the women received her.
Metaphorically they recoiled before her. That cold assurance,
amounting almost to boldness, which Faversham had detected in her
bearing, proved repellant to the majority of her own sex. They
discovered in her something almost approaching raffishness, which
disconcerted their own more veiled immodesty. And then there was
her astounding popularity with the men to quicken the venom of the
ladies of the Court. The latter looked on with noses at a
disdainful angle, whilst they stripped her character to its last
rag, tore her reputation into tatters.</p>

<p>Yet she thrived amazingly in the assiduous court that was paid
her by the brothers, fathers, and husbands of her instinctive
enemies. The sultan Charles himself was vastly taken with
her&mdash;which, after all, considering his temperament, was not
wonderful. He went the length of visiting her in her splendid
mansion in Pall Mall, a matter which caused Faversham to wring his
hands in despair, and pray that her husband's brother might get his
dying done with as much despatch as possible.</p>

<p>But there was worse to follow. All day, and often far into the
night, a line of chairs and coaches stood before her doors, and in
her ante-chambers, such was the press of courtiers that you might
have deemed yourself at Whitehall.</p>

<p>In her social tastes she proved herself extremely catholic. Not
merely were beaux and men of fashion welcomed; soon her rooms were
thronged with wits and poets, painters, writers of plays, and even
one or two actors haled thither in the train of Sir George
Etheredge, who himself belonged to two worlds. To all she was alike
gracious, until in the end, inevitably, she came to manifest to one
a special favour. And this one, to Faversham's dismay, was none
other than Sir Charles Sedley, that devourer of hearts, that
heartless blighter of reputations. And the worst of it was that the
first advances came undoubtedly from her. She it was who ogled the
rake and lured him on to pay his assiduous court.</p>

<p>Soon her name, coupled with Sedley's, was on the gay town's
lips. Faversham&mdash;immensely daring&mdash;breathed a warning to
her. She measured him with her bold black eyes, 'twixt raillery and
scorn.</p>

<p>'I protest I find him vastly amusing,' said she.</p>

<p>'I pray Heaven, madam, you may always say so,' said Faversham
impressively.</p>

<p>'You are more devout than witty, sir, which is to say, you are a
dullard,' was the fleeting answer with which she quitted him.</p>

<p>Some days later, in the Rhenish Wine House, which was full of
company at the time, Sir Lionel came face to face with Ned
Kynaston. The actor had a flushed, excited air, and his eyes were
bright.</p>

<p>'What's this I hear of Sedley, Sir Lionel?' he cried out, in a
voice that drew attention. 'They are coupling his name with Lady
Chesterham's. But an hour ago I all but had a duel on my hands
through it.'</p>

<p>Faversham's lips tightened. He froze. Were matters indeed gone
so far that her name was thus flung about a wineshop? Yet because
of his affection for Kynaston he tempered the rebuke that had
arisen to his lips.</p>

<p>'Lady Chesterham's affairs,' he replied gravely, 'are her own
and Lord Chesterham's, who, no doubt, will demand an account of any
who presumes to lend her name to scandal-mongers.'</p>

<p>'Faith, then, he'll need to be returning soon, or he'll find his
work done for him by another. Curse me, Sir Lionel, I tell you no
man shall say a word against her ladyship in my hearing but I'll
ram his lies down his dirty throat with the point of my cane!'</p>

<p>Faversham took him by the arm.</p>

<p>'Be silent, Ned!'</p>

<p>'Silent?' roared Kynaston. 'Shall I be silent what time that
foul fellow Sedley's verses upon her are being sung up and down the
town? I'll do more than write verses in her honour to prove myself
her slave!' And he declaimed, adapting:</p>

<p class="poem">I'll sing my praise of thee in trumpet sounds,<br>
And write my homage down in blood and wounds.</p>

<p>Faversham's grip upon his arm tightened. He dragged him out of
the tavern into the pale February sunshine.</p>

<p>'Art mad, Ned?' he growled. 'Another word in that strain in
public, and I shall quarrel with you. If you respect the lady as
you pretend, afford by silence some testimony of that respect.'</p>

<p>But the mischief was done. Kynaston had been abundantly
overheard. His words were, of course, repeated. The women got hold
of the story, and it suffered nothing in their fierce retelling of
it. This bold wanton was so lost to decency, so greedy of admirers,
that even players were admitted to sun themselves in her smiles. As
for Kynaston, there were no limits to what was said of him. It was
most plausibly suggested that, availing himself of the opportunity
her lack of circumspection was affording him, he meant to oust
Sedley from her favour, and thus take vengeance upon Sedley for the
beating he had received by his appointment. Since her tastes were
admittedly base, it was deemed not impossible that he might prove
victorious in this contest, though, to be sure, it would be a
victory that could bring him but little glory. Thus the ladies.</p>

<p>That pretty tale overran the town like wildfire. It came to
Sedley's ears, and set him in a seething passion. In this he went
off to Lady Chesterham's.</p>

<p>'Madam, what is't I hear?' he burst out at sight of her.</p>

<p>From the couch where she reclined she eyed him languidly.</p>

<p>'I see that you are come to set me riddles,' she drawled. 'But I
warn you that they weary me.'</p>

<p>'Riddles?' quoth he. 'Ay, a riddle in sooth. 'Tis said that you
favour that low fellow Kynaston; that you receive him here; that he
has the temerity to proclaim himself the champion of your good
name!'</p>

<p>'Does he so?' she cooed. 'I vow 'tis vastly sweet in him.'</p>

<p>'Vastly sweet?' he roared. 'Fan me, ye winds! Do you realize
what it means? Would you have him blast your fair repute,
madam?'</p>

<p>She considered him with half-closed eyes, smiling insolently
over the edge of her gently moving fan.</p>

<p>'Do you desire to be alone and absolute in the enjoyment of that
privilege?' quoth she.</p>

<p>He looked at her blankly a moment, speechless. Then he stamped
his foot.</p>

<p>"Tis not to be borne!' he cried.</p>

<p>'Who bids you bear it, sir, whatever it may be?' she countered
scornfully. 'Did I bid you to come pestering me with your sheep's
eyes and your sighs and your silly speeches? If the dear lad please
me, what is't to you, pray? Who gave you rights upon me? La, now! I
protest you weary me.'</p>

<p>'Caroline!' he began unsteadily. He advanced and stood over her,
glowering down into that mocking, gipsy-tinted face. He swallowed,
and began again. 'You are to understand, madam, that it is not safe
to play fast-and-loose with me.'</p>

<p>The jewelled fingers of her fine long hand moved her fan gently
to and fro again. Her lip curled.</p>

<p>'You are a mirror of the politenesses, sir.'</p>

<p>'Curse me, madam, I do not aim at politeness!'</p>

<p>'In that case you will be the less put about.'</p>

<p>'Ha! You rally me! You make a mock of me!' he raved, beside
himself with anger. 'You have brought me to this&mdash;to this! And
now&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>He flung his arms wide and let them fall again, his face very
pale.</p>

<p>She sat bolt upright.</p>

<p>'Sir Charles,' said she, 'I was warned of your presumption and
your ill-repute.'</p>

<p>'If that dog Kynaston has dared malign me&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Believe me, 'twere impossible&mdash;beyond the compass of his
invention. It is time, Sir Charles, you understood that you have no
right or claim upon me beyond such as it may be my pleasure to
confer. Such rights belong only to my husband.'</p>

<p>'Damn your husband, madam!' he snapped in his rage.</p>

<p>She rose, frowning.</p>

<p>'Sir Charles, you forget the respect due to me,' she rebuked
him, with a great dignity, her face forbiddingly cold. 'You have my
leave to go.'</p>

<p>He gaped foolishly, stricken by her sudden iciness.</p>

<p>'Forgive me!' he pleaded. 'I&mdash;I am a little disordered.
I&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Faugh!' she broke in. 'I could forgive your being disordered,
but I cannot forgive you for being maudlin and tiresome. Heaven be
my witness I never could endure a tiresome man. I give you
good-day.'</p>

<p>He flung out in a rage, not trusting himself to say another
word. In his heart he cursed her for a wanton who had but lured him
on that she might subject him to this humiliation. But anon, as he
cooled, he came to consider that perhaps he had been precipitate.
His vanity argued that her self-respect must have compelled her to
resent the too-masterful tone he had taken with her. He had been
foolish; he had displayed no more tact or judgement than an
oaf.</p>

<p>Hence it happened that he came contritely to her house upon the
following morning, intent to make his peace with her, confident of
his power to do so. He reflected that no cloud would ever have
troubled their relations but for that rascal Kynaston. The very
thought of the fellow was enough to fling Sir Charles into a fresh
passion. But he curbed his mood, bethinking him that to give way to
it was to suffer defeat in the end. After all, Kynaston was most
rarely handsome, and he had gifts&mdash;Sir Charles deemed it
prudent to admit his enemy's strength&mdash;which might entrap the
heart of a wilful, headstrong woman such as Caroline Chesterham.
Women were such fools in these matters, he considered. They never
could distinguish between a rogue and a gentleman.</p>

<p>He entered the spacious hall at the foot of the main
staircase&mdash;a hall which served the purpose of the mansion's
principle ante-chamber. Here he found the usual company assembled,
but, if anything, more numerous than usual, which put him out of
temper. Yet perhaps she would do him the honour of granting him
immediate and private audience?</p>

<p>He approached one of her splendid servants, and slipped a guinea
into the fellow's hand and a message into his ear. The lackey
pocketed the coin, and vanished. He returned almost at once.</p>

<p>'Her ladyship's compliments, Sir Charles, and she desires to be
private until she announces herself disposed to receive.'</p>

<p>Vexed, Sir Charles turned aside, and fell into absent-minded
talk with Buckhurst. Ten minutes passed, and then there was a
sudden stir in the courtly groups about the hall.</p>

<p>Down the stairs, serene and graceful, came a young man in a suit
of heliotrope satin edged with silver, a wealth of lace at wrist
and throat, his plumed hat under his right arm, and an ebony cane
dangling from his left wrist. His hair fell in a shower of golden
ringlets, a bunch of them caught in a heliotrope ribbon on a level
with his left ear.</p>

<p>It was Ned Kynaston. As Sir Charles stared incredulously he
could scarcely believe his eyes. A red mist rose at last before
them; he felt a tightening at the throat. He and some twenty of the
first gentlemen of the town were left there to cool their heels
like lackeys whilst she was private with this low-born fellow, who
descended now as self-assured and supercilious as though the house
belonged to him.</p>

<p>Men nudged one another, and Sir Charles felt every eye turned
upon him. He told himself that he was become their laughing
stock.</p>

<p>Then, on the fourth step from the foot of the stairs, Kynaston
paused.</p>

<p>'Her ladyship's compliments, gentlemen, to you all,' he
announced&mdash;ladies there were none present at this
levee&mdash;'and she bids me beg you to hold her excused, as she
desires to rest herself this morning.'</p>

<p>This was too much for Sedley. Rudely he shouldered his way
through the throng to the foot of the stairs, and every eye was
upon him, every face betrayed its gleeful expectancy of a
scene.</p>

<p>'So,' he growled, hoarse with passion, 'you play the lackey, do
you, Kynaston? Faith, I never saw you better fitted with a part to
suit you.'</p>

<p>The actor, still on that fourth step&mdash;a position which gave
a certain advantage over his enemy&mdash;paused to take snuff
daintily before replying.</p>

<p>'Ha, Sir Charles!' he said, in his clear, bell-like voice, and
never had an audience hung more intently upon his words. 'I have a
word for you in addition to what I have announced already.' He shut
his snuffbox with a snap, and dusted fragments of the Burgamot from
his ruffles. 'If her ladyship does not receive this morning the
fault, Sir Charles, is yours. I see no reason to spare you the
humiliation you seek when you thrust yourself in here despite her
ladyship's definite dismissal of you yesterday. Yet her ladyship
would have spared it you, and 'twas to that end&mdash;that she
might not be forced to single you out&mdash;that she determined
today, being informed of your presence, to deny herself to
all.'</p>

<p>Mad with anger and mortification, intent only upon insult, Sir
Charles flung forward with the retort:</p>

<p>'You lie, you dog of a play-actor!'</p>

<p>That was Kynaston's great opportunity. In a flash he took it;
took it like one who has been waiting in leash for it. His right
hand swung up, and he caught Sir Charles a buffet full upon the
cheek, that knocked him into the arms of Sir John Ogle.</p>

<p>There was a pause until Sedley recovered from his astonishment.
Then, bellowing blasphemy, he lugged at his sword. Instantly a
dozen hands fastened upon him.</p>

<p>'Not here, Charles!' cried Buckhurst. 'We'll not suffer it in
her ladyship's house. You shall not make her name the talk o' th'
town. Elsewhere, Charles! Elsewhere! Not here!'</p>

<p>Thus they&mdash;his own friends&mdash;committed him to it. He
glared at Kynaston, who, leaning now upon his cane, looked down
upon him with a crooked smile.</p>

<p>'You dog!' he roared. He was foaming at the mouth, his handsome,
dissipated face aflame with passion. 'I'll kill you for this! My
friends shall wait upon you!'</p>

<p>'You sent your friends to me once before. Faith, they were the
friends I should expect in you,' drawled the actor.</p>

<p>Through Sedley's furious mind there flashed then a suspicion
that all this was an elaborate trap in which he was caught. But
still he did not realize its details.</p>

<p>'It shall be cold steel this time!' he bellowed. 'Get measured
for your coffin.'</p>

<p>The meeting took place at eight o'clock next morning in
Leicester Fields, and it presented some unusual features. In the
first place, Ned Kynaston did not come to the ground with his
friends, as is prescribed by all sound authorities on the
formalities of the duello. And when Faversham and Etheredge, who
had consented to act for him, made their joint appearance at five
minutes to eight, their principal was not yet come.</p>

<p>Sedley, stripped to shirt and breeches, was already there with
Buckhurst and Ogle. Also there was such a throng of spectators that
every rank of life was represented. This was a matter that
increased Sedley's fury. If he must disgrace himself and soil his
sword in the blood of an actor, he would, at least, have desired to
have been private. However, being thrust into so unworthy a
position, he must perforce bear himself as best he could. He turned
to Faversham with a sneering laugh.</p>

<p>'Odds death, Sir Lionel!' quoth he. 'Is your friend like to keep
us waiting longer? I've gotten an appetite from this early rising,
and I'm in haste to get to breakfast.'</p>

<p>That taunt was followed by others that became more and more
barbed as time passed and still there was no sign of Kynaston.
Faversham tells us that, mortified, he was on the point of offering
to take his principal's place when at last a chair was espied
advancing from St Martin's Lane.</p>

<p>It must be Kynaston at last! But when the bearers had set it
down and raised the roof, out stepped, not Kynaston, but Lady
Chesterham, to the dumbfoundering of every man present. Instantly
she ran to Sedley.</p>

<p>'Sir Charles!' she cried, a note of appeal in her voice, and
tears in her lovely eyes. 'Forgive me for what I have done. There
will be no fighting this morning.'</p>

<p>Sir Charles looked down at her. He was very white, and his lips
were twitching.</p>

<p>'Madam,' he muttered at last, 'let me beg you to take some
thought for your name, and withdraw.'</p>

<p>'My name!' she cried. 'What care I for my name? I can take
thought for nothing but his life, Sir Charles.' (A spasm rippled
over Sedley's face.) "Tis my fault. 'Twas I bade him bear that
message to you. I'll not have him murdered for what was of my
doing.'</p>

<p>'Did he send you hither?' snapped Sedley.</p>

<p>'Send me? Not he, poor lad. He's safe enough, and no harm can
come to him. But you shall not fight him.'</p>

<p>'By Heaven, madam, shall I take a blow? And from such a dog as
that?' quoth he. 'The quarrel was of his seeking.'</p>

<p>'Nay, 'twas of yours; 'twas you gave him the lie. What could he
do, poor boy?' She looked up at him in distress and appeal; but he
remained unmoved before it, mindful only of his wrongs.</p>

<p>'Madam, let me entreat you to withdraw.'</p>

<p>'Not until I have your promise that you will spare him. Why are
you so set on killing him? What is his life to you?'</p>

<p>'What is it to you, madam?' countered Sedley fiercely, himself
forgetful now of spectators.</p>

<p>But if he was lost to shame she was a thousand times more
so.</p>

<p>'He is everything to me,' she answered; 'and I care not who
hears me! If he dies, I shall die. If you wish to kill me, kill
him. Ah, bethink you, he is so young, so gentle, and so
lovely&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>Perhaps that plea was ill-considered. Sir Charles stepped back,
his face set and scowling.</p>

<p>'This is idle, madam. Worse than idle. You humiliate yourself in
vain.' And he waved a hand to the assembled throng, all greedily
watching this extraordinary scene.</p>

<p>'You are resolved to fight, in spite of all that I have said?'
she demanded tragically.</p>

<p>'Madam, I am!'</p>

<p>'Be it so, then!' she answered, in a sudden fury. 'In that case
you shall fight me!' And before Faversham knew what she was about
she had snatched the sword from his side. Flourishing it, she
advanced upon Sedley. 'On guard, sir!' she challenged him.</p>

<p>'Madam, you are mad,' he answered; and he believed it. 'I
implore you to be more circumspect. There are those who hear
you&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I desire them to hear me,' she answered, and her voice seemed
to take on a deeper note. 'And they shall see me, too,' she
added.</p>

<p>And then the amazing thing took place. She tore off her plumed
hat, and with it tore away her lofty mass of lustrous black hair,
leaving in its place a ripple of golden locks about her neck. She
flung off the long black cloak in which she had been wrapped; her
furbelow fell away about her feet; and forth from that burst
chrysalis, under the eye of the gaping company, stepped Ned
Kynaston himself.</p>

<p>Kynaston indeed it was, and yet even now the face was hardly his
own: it was still in part transformed by the darkened eyebrows, the
olive-tinted cheeks, the patches under lip and eye, and other
cunning touches which the theatre had taught that masterly player
of feminine roles, and which had gone to make him in real life what
so often he had been upon the stage&mdash;the loveliest lady that
ever Mr Pepys saw in all his life.</p>

<p>Like a ripple over water ran the truth through the assembled
crowd, and after its first gasp under the shock of that revelation
a great peal of laughter broke upon the morning air.</p>

<p>Sedley looked on, white to the lips, cut and wounded to the very
soul of him. He had no delusions on the score of the laughter. It
was himself was the object of it; he it was who had been fooled to
the very top of his bent; he who must die under the ridicule that
would convulse the town. Had he not made love to Caroline
Chesterham? Had he not written verses in her honour? Had he not
languished and sighed and fondled her hand by the hour? Had he not
come to fight this very duel out of jealousy aroused by her?</p>

<p>With a snarling cry he hurled himself upon the actor. But
meanwhile Kynaston had kicked aside the discarded furbelow and
cloak, and stood free to receive this onslaught&mdash;graceful,
alert, and poised like a fencing-master.</p>

<p>Faversham would have interposed. But the actor waved him
away.</p>

<p>'In Heaven's name,' he laughed, 'let him have what he came
for.'</p>

<p>The blades met and jarred, then Sedley's was deflected; there
was a twinkling disengage, and Kynaston's point flew straight and
unhampered at the region of his opponent's heart. Within an inch of
the body it paused, and Kynaston drew back his arm. As all saw, he
had spared his enemy. Sedley came on again, and for the second time
the actor got within his opponent's guard, yet again he checked his
point at the very moment of touching the other's body. If aught had
been wanting to complete Sedley's humiliation it was afforded in
that fine display of fence, and the almost contemptuous mercy with
which it was accompanied.</p>

<p>The end came soon. Kynaston, supremely the master, made a fresh
opening, went in for the third and last time, and transfixed his
adversary's sword-arm.</p>

<p>Perforce that was the end, and Kynaston went off to breakfast
with his seconds; whilst the crowd dispersed to put this amazing
story about the town.</p>

<p>'I shall look to you, Sir Lionel,' said the actor, when they had
got to table, 'to make my peace with my Lord Chesterham should this
affair ever come to his ears. You'll have guessed by this that
'twas I, myself, who wrote the letters of introduction which I
brought to you and to Lady Denham. No doubt 'twas a gross libel on
his lordship, who, belike, has no thought whatever of marrying
again.' Then he sighed and laughed in one. 'Odds life! That house
in Pall Mall and the rest of it will cost me a year's earnings. But
Sedley's is the heavier reckoning. I promised you it should be
heavy.'</p>

<p>Heavy it was, indeed. Sedley left town immediately, unable to
face the ridicule in store for him, and for a year thereafter he
abode quietly in the country, no man knowing where. Nor does it
transpire that he ever attempted to pit himself against Ned
Kynaston again.</p>

<h2><a name="ch10" id="ch10"></a>JACK O'LANTERN</h2>

<h3>Strand Magazine, 1937</h3>

<p>Jack o'Lantern was the name bestowed upon him by the Bow Street
runners whom his elusiveness was exasperating. His real identity
was as unknown to them as his countenance, which he covered with a
black visor, whenever operating. The speed of his movements was
such that he seemed to multiply himself. No sooner was the
hue-and-cry raised in Kent for the robbery of a nobleman on Gad's
Hill at noon, than they heard of him holding up the Oxford coach
beyond Watford in the evening. They identified him by a general
description: his genteel methods; his good shape and his military
exterior; a laced hat cocked over the right eye, an elegant,
full-skirted coat, a steinkirk and so on. He rode a bay mare,
presenting, however, no peculiar characteristics.</p>

<p>On that afternoon in May when just beyond Kentish Town he
relieved Squire Kendrick of a purse of fifty guineas, a gold
snuffbox, a diamond ring of price and a handsome small-sword that
took his fancy, he was led by his ill-starred meeting with Mr
Richard Lessingham to depart from his usual practice of setting out
at once to put a score of miles between himself and the scene of
the outrage.</p>

<p>He could not have chosen a worse moment for the encounter. At
the best of times Mr Richard Lessingham would have proved an
awkward customer, for, like most men endowed with a strong dash of
rascality, he was a considerable fellow of his hands. Today he
happened to ride in a furious temper, feeling that life had
declared war upon him, and all but looking for an opportunity to
deliver battle.</p>

<p>He was the nephew and heir presumptive of that wealthy nawab Sir
John Lessingham, who, following a fashion and a taste for the
district, common in his day with so many of his kind, had built
himself out of the plunder of the Indies a handsome house in a
handsome park on the north side of Highgate Hill. For any
inheritance beyond the baronetcy and the little estate that went to
adorn it, Richard Lessingham must depend upon the relations between
his uncle and himself. Sir John had been more than generous with
him. He desired that his nephew and heir presumptive could cut a
prominent figure in the world of fashion wherein, himself, he had
failed. For English Society looked askance on these nawabs and
their suspiciously acquired wealth. To this end he made the lad a
princely allowance. But it had not proved liberal enough to meet
the extravagances of a vain, ostentatious, and fundamentally
worthless nature. Horses and cards and other extravagances had run
Mr Richard heavily into debt.</p>

<p>On the first occasion the nawab had relieved the obligations
with a laugh. The name of Lessingham would gather lustre from being
well gilded. Later he had relieved obligations again, but he had
not laughed. Later still he had stormed whilst paying, and warned
his nephew that he would pay no more excesses of the allowance. The
warning, however, was powerless to curb extravagances that by this
time had become settled habits. All that had resulted was that when
next Richard found his debts submerging him, instead of seeking his
uncle, he had sought&mdash;on the advice of a fellow-member of
White's to whom he had lost a deal of money at ombre&mdash;a
certain Mr Nicholas Magdalen, who in a back office in Essex Street
was amassing an incalculable fortune by the benevolent assistance
of young gentlemen of quality in financial distress.</p>

<p>Mr Magdalen, an elderly little man with a moist, red face and
greasy black hair that straggled untidily about a skull-cap, had
displayed a solicitude of the friendliest. He could not have been
more distressed over his new client's plight if Richard had been
his own child. He invited him to dismiss all concern. There was
neither sense nor right in that a fine young gentleman of his
quality and a future baronet should be plagued over a matter of a
mere couple of thousand pounds. His little short-sighted eyes
beamed through his horn-rimmed spectacles as he thanked his gods
that it was in his power to play the fairy godfather. The money
should be paid to Mr Lessingham's bankers without fail in the
morning. He would, of course, make a charge for the accommodation.
One had to live. But&mdash;again thanking his gods&mdash;Mr
Magdalen was no usurer, like some that he could name. Thirty per
centum was the uttermost interest he would consent to take,
considering how good must be the security that Mr Lessingham would
supply.</p>

<p>It became necessary to explain to the ignorant but immensely
relieved Mr Lessingham the exact meaning of the term 'security'.
His relief was diminished by the explanation. Dismay finally
replaced it.</p>

<p>'But I have no property. No property whatsoever.'</p>

<p>Mr Magdalen's smile was reassured. 'Not <em>in esse</em>, as we
say. No. But <em>in posse</em>, my dear sir, there is Lessingham
Park, which your uncle has entailed to go with the title.'</p>

<p>'But that's not mine yet.'</p>

<p>The benign smile of Mr Magdalen became broader. 'The prospect is
enough, my dear sir. It would not be enough for everybody. Nor
would I do this for everybody; for, of course, the risk is
considerable. If you should predecease your uncle, the post-obit
will be so much waste paper. But we can provide for that risk in
the rate of interest. I am afraid I must make it sixty per centum.
But, then, you'll not account that unreasonable,
considering...'</p>

<p>'What is a post...What d'ye call it?'</p>

<p>Mr Magdalen gently explained the nature and effect of the
post-obit.</p>

<p>'Ecod!' said Mr Lessingham to this wealth of instruction into
mysterious and unsuspected ways of finance.</p>

<p>He departed with the assurance that the cash would be at his
disposal on the morrow, and he came back again in six months' time
not only gloomily to confess that he could not find a matter of
twelve hundred pounds due for interest, but that he had pressing
debts for another thousand and didn't know where the devil to seek
it.</p>

<p>Mr Magdalen's undiminished benignity at once dispelled his
apprehensions.</p>

<p>'No cause to distress yourself, my dear young friend. We add the
interest to the principal, and that's the end of the matter. Forget
it. Amuse yourself. As for your present debts, I will provide the
thousand pounds at once.'</p>

<p>Six months later, Mr Lessingham found himself owing something
over two thousand pounds for interest, whilst one or two creditors
were pressing him for debts which in all amounted to about eight
hundred pounds. It began to be borne in upon the dull wits of the
nawab's nephew that a morass awaited him at the bottom of the easy
slope to which he had set his feet. The benignity of Mr Magdalen on
this occasion did not suffice to allay his very real anxieties,
especially when he discovered that whilst Mr Magdalen would again
be content to add interest to principal, he was by no means
prepared to advance the further moneys so immediately necessary.
The little estate, he pointed out, was not worth above twenty
thousand pounds, and the risks attached to post-obit made it
impossible to increase the capital liability already incurred.</p>

<p>Mr Lessingham was appalled. He made a mental calculation and
presented the results to Mr Magdalen. That he was capable of it
shows the extent to which his education in financial matters had
lately improved.</p>

<p>'Ecod, sir! At this rate in a couple of years' time Lessingham
Park will be your property, and all that I'll have had will have
been a matter of three thousand pounds. Blister me!'</p>

<p>'Sir John may die before then,' said Mr Magdalen hopefully.</p>

<p>'Damme! Sir John won't die in the next ten years. God knows he's
hale enough for another twenty.' Mr Lessingham sucked his breath in
sudden terror. 'What'll be owing you in twenty years at this
thieving rate?'</p>

<p>With pursed lips Mr Magdalen opined that it might be rather more
than the whole fortune of the nawab. But he begged Mr Lessingham to
dismiss such gloomy conjectures. Mr Lessingham, however, could not
dismiss them.</p>

<p>'Sold myself for a mess of pottage, ecod!' said he, and black,
vicious despair looked out of his livid face at the benevolent
little usurer. A snarl crept into his voice. 'I've a mind
to...'</p>

<p>'Now wait a moment. Wait a moment,' Mr Magdalen begged him.
'Between friends there are always ways of arranging matters, and I
hope, Mr Lessingham, sir, that you will consider me your friend.
There's a proposal I might make to you that I give you my word I
wouldn't make to another man living. 'Pon honour I wouldn't. Have
you...hem...have you ever thought of marriage, Mr Lessingham,
sir.'</p>

<p>'Marriage!' sneered the young gentleman. He became cynical.
'I've never met a lady well enough dowered.'</p>

<p>'That', said Mr Magdalen, 'is where I might help you.'</p>

<p>'Faith, ye're a marriage-broker, then, as well as a moneylender?
If your rate of interest is as unconscionable...'</p>

<p>'There's no rate of interest at all. The lady is perhaps the
wealthiest heiress in England, and her dowry will
be...ah...princely.'</p>

<p>Mr Lessingham's handsome face was darkened in a scowl.</p>

<p>'Let me know more of this. Be plain with me.'</p>

<p>Mr Magdalen was plain. And forth came a proposal which had
already been made to a half-dozen other young gentlemen of title,
actual or prospective, in straitened circumstances. Mr Magdalen
possessed a daughter who would one day inherit the ill-gotten
millions in which his only joy had been that of accumulating them.
It would, however, he felt, be vain to leave her the wealthiest
woman in England unless at the same time he could assure for her a
place in those exalted social circles where wealth enabled life to
be lived at its fullest and most brilliant.</p>

<p>It had become an obsession with the little usurer. The fact that
in the past five years the proposal had been declined by the needy
noblemen to whom it had been made, had merely served to sharpen Mr
Magdalen's desire to a desperate keenness.</p>

<p>On the understanding that he made the offer subject to the
lady's own consent&mdash;a consent which he opined, with an
appreciative eye for Mr Lessingham's attractive exterior, was not
likely to be refused&mdash;he invited Mr Lessingham to consider how
happy an issue from all his troubles lay for him in marriage with
so well-dowered a lady. He did so with confidence, gloating
secretly over the fact that Mr Lessingham was in a vice far tighter
than that in which he had held any of the gentlemen who had
declined him. Nevertheless Mr Lessingham was prompt, outraged and
virulent in damning the moneylender for his impudence. As
foul-mouthed as a drayman, he practised no decency in his comments
upon Mr Magdalen's probable ancestry. But when he came to express
assumptions concerned with Mr Magdalen's only descendant, the
moneylender checked him suddenly.</p>

<p>'Say nothing that will make it impossible for you to change your
mind,' he warned him, in a thin, hard voice from which all
benignity had departed. And at once he turned the screw of the vice
in which he held his debtor. 'There's a matter of two thousand five
hundred pounds for interest that was due from you yesterday. I
don't wish to be hard, Mr Lessingham, sir, but unless I have the
money by four o'clock this afternoon, I shall wait upon Sir John
with the post-obit in the morning, and ask him if he would wish to
redeem it.'</p>

<p>To Mr Lessingham this was a blow between the eyes. For a moment
it almost stunned him. Recovering, he was first violent, then
plaintive, then violent again. But Mr Magdalen, now tight of lip
and hard of eye, remained unmoved, and the end of the matter was
that Mr Lessingham went off to Highgate and Sir John with ruin
staring him in the face. For he knew his uncle too well to doubt
that the disclosure of how he had raised money on the prospect of
the nawab's death would put an end to all his hopes of inheriting a
shilling beyond the wretched little estate that went with the
title.</p>

<p>At all costs that knowledge must be kept from Sir John.</p>

<p>In sheer despair, rather than consent to marry the daughter of
that greasy little thief in Essex Street he chose the lesser evil
of an appeal to the already exasperated nawab.</p>

<p>He may or may not have been mistaken in making his prayer more
or less in the form of an accusation. It was Sir John's hardness
towards him, he urged, that had driven him into the clutches of a
rascally moneylender. To extricate himself completely he needed at
once a matter of six or seven thousand pounds. The nawab's reply
amounted to a sketch of his nephew's character as succinct as it
was accurate and blistering, at the end of which he bade him go to
the devil.</p>

<p>Mr Lessingham accounted that to marry Magdalen's daughter would
be tantamount to obeying this injunction. But if he was to avoid
the ruin of his hopes and the immediate possibility of debtor's
gaol, there was no choice but to consent to make this probably
greasy wench the future Lady Lessingham. It would be necessary to
humble himself to the dust so as to obtain from Mr Magdalen a
renewal of the offer he had so insolently rejected; and he must
lose no time. It must be done at once if he would prevent Mr
Magdalen's journey to Lessingham Park tomorrow with the
post-obit.</p>

<p>He came raging to the summit of Highgate Hill. Without eyes for
the fine prospect, with London under a haze at his feet, and the
broad ribbon of the Thames visible for a dozen miles with its
burden of shipping, he spurred his big black horse down the slope
towards Holloway.</p>

<p>It was at the foot of the hill that Jack o'Lantern met him, and,
to his undoing, was tempted to arrest his headlong course.</p>

<p>At the sight of the black-visored horseman and the levelled
pistol, Mr Lessingham stood, as he was bidden. But as for
delivering, it came to him as a climax of irony to swell his
already excessive rage that such an invitation should be issued to
a man in his desperate case.</p>

<p>Jack o'Lantern was, of course, not to know this. Nor had he any
means of perceiving that the horseman he had brought to a
standstill was a reckless, dangerous fellow at the best of times,
and in particularly savage mood this afternoon. By the time he
might have suspected it, he was beyond suspecting anything. For,
with sudden, lightning speed, Mr Lessingham's heavy riding-crop had
crashed into his temple and knocked him senseless from the
saddle.</p>

<p>When the highwayman recovered consciousness, he was lying on the
turf of a meadow beyond a belt of trees by which the horses were
tethered, with his assailant sitting cross-legged and watchful
beside him.</p>

<p>Mr Lessingham had taken the natural precaution of depriving him
of his weapons. He had drawn a second pistol from its holster, and
he had removed the sword the highwayman was wearing, a pretty piece
of workmanship with a mother of pearl handle and for pommel a milky
crystal the size of a pigeon's egg, that might have been a
moonstone. It was attached to a baldrick of red Spanish leather
adorned with a pattern of oak-leaves in gold bullion, and by this
it was now slung from Mr Lessingham's own shoulder. To make sure
that the rascal had no other weapon about him, Mr Lessingham had
gone through his pockets. Amongst some lesser effects, he had found
a gold snuff-box, and a heavy purse of red silk mesh that was
stuffed with guineas and contained in addition a diamond ring of
price. Perceiving no sin in robbing a thief, Mr Lessingham's easy
conscience regarded these valuables as a windfall, and he
transferred them to his own pocket. After that he sat down to await
the man's recovery, and he smiled as he waited, for it seemed to
him that nothing could have been more opportune. The encounter
which had so infuriated him had ended by bringing inspiration. It
prompted an easier way to deliverance from his difficulties than
that to which he had been so dejectedly riding.</p>

<p>Jack o'Lantern sat up, straightened his wig on an aching head
and in doing so became aware of the lump on his brow. He looked
about him with eyes that were still dazed, met the derisive smile
of Mr Lessingham and awakened a little further.</p>

<p>'What the devil...' he began, and checked there.</p>

<p>'Give yourself no concern, my friend,' said his captor. 'The
worst has happened to you, unless you show no more sense than a
woodcock.'</p>

<p>The highwayman's eyes alighted on the baldrick with the
oak-leaves pattern. He felt in his pockets. Then his lip
curled.</p>

<p>'So that's what you are,' said he. 'A dog that eats dog.'</p>

<p>Mr Lessingham laughed joyously, as a man will whose soul has
suddenly been delivered of a burden of care. 'A mastiff that dines
on poodles, if you will. But a tobyman by proxy, and that for one
occasion only, provided you show sense. In that case you may go
your ways to the devil when you've served my turn. In any other
you'll ride with me to the Bridewell.'</p>

<p>Jack o'Lantern gathered up his legs and embraced his knees. Out
of a lean, keen young face, wide of mouth and tip-tilted of nose, a
pair of astute eyes calmly took the measure of Mr Lessingham.
Whatever the rascal's emotions, he kept a mask upon them, and fear
was certainly not amongst them.</p>

<p>'Could you be plainer?' he asked.</p>

<p>'As plain as you please. Early tomorrow we take the road
together, hereabouts. That belt of trees will supply the screen
we'll need, and we'll wait for a certain hackney coach that'll be
coming from London on its way over the hill there. There'll not be
many hackneys come as far as this, so we're not likely to be
mistook, besides ye'll not stir until I've seen who rides in it.
When I give you the word, you'll halt it. You'll require the
traveller to strip himself and hand you his clothes besides
anything else in the way of baggage that he may have with him. When
you've delivered these to me, you may go your ways. Is it
clear?'</p>

<p>'Clear enough, codso! I'm to pull chestnuts from the fire for
you, so as if any fingers is burnt it'll be mine. But what do I get
for doing it?'</p>

<p>'It's what'll you get for not doing it. The gallows. That's what
you'll get.'</p>

<p>'Spoke like a gentleman,' said Jack. Then he passed a hand over
an aching brow. 'Ye've got a pistol at my head. I must stand and
deliver, I suppose. Do the dirty work ye're too fine to do for
yourself.'</p>

<p>'I'm glad ye're sensible. And speaking of pistols, an empty one
will serve your turn tomorrow. Our subject is an old man, and the
hackney driver's only thought will be to keep a whole skin. So
don't be building any false hopes.'</p>

<p>'Ye take no chances,' said Jack with the suspicion of a
sneer.</p>

<p>'None, as you'll find. Remember it. For tonight you'll be my
guest for bed and supper.'</p>

<p>'I had a notion that it was you might be mine, being as ye've
filched my purse,' said Jack.</p>

<p>Mr Lessingham got up. 'I'll trouble you to keep a civil tongue,
my lad. Get that into your brain-pan, and let it simmer there. Come
on now. Up with you.'</p>

<p>Jack o'Lantern came slowly to his feet. He stood swaying a
little, a hand to his head again.</p>

<p>'Odsbud! I'm giddy. Lend me your arm, sir.'</p>

<p>A smile twisted Mr Lessingham's full, cruel lips. 'I'll lend you
nothing. Step out ahead, and no tricks, you rogue, or you'll
forfeit your only chance of postponing acquaintance with the
gallows. You'll not slip through my fingers; not if you were as
slippery as Jack o'Lantern himself.'</p>

<p>Jack's only answer to that was a wistful smile. He went forward
staggering a little, Mr Lessingham following closely, his
riding-crop in readiness. Thus they reached the horses, untethered
them, mounted, and picked their way through the trees to the
road.</p>

<p>With the highwayman leading by half a length, so that the eye of
this captor who took no chances was upon his every movement, they
came, as dusk was closing in, to the Bull at Islington, where Mr
Lessingham had resolved that they should lie the night, in
readiness for the morrow's business of waylaying Mr Magdalen.</p>

<p>They left their horses with the ostler in the yard, and strode
forward towards an open side-door from which the light was shining,
the highwayman leading ever, with Mr Lessingham close upon his
heels. Voices met them, coming from a room at the far end of the
passage by which they were advancing, and what Jack o'Lantern heard
made him check in his stride. The movement was instinctive, but so
momentary that he seemed merely to have stumbled.</p>

<p>'And a bay mare, ye say, sir? I'll wager my bones that'd be Jack
o'Lantern, as sure as my name be Tom Bowles.'</p>

<p>Impelled by his follower, Jack perforce went on, and as he
reached the open door, the answer came delivered in a voice that
was shrill with rage.</p>

<p>'Jack o'Lantern or another. What's the odds? A crying scandal to
you all that such things should be done in daylight. In broad
daylight. On the King's highway. It shows the worth of your
vigilance. It shows the worth of all these measures of which Sir
Henry Fielding makes a boast. Measures that were to clear the
country of this vermin. Why, things were no worse a hundred years
ago.'</p>

<p>The speaker was still inveighing when Jack came to the doorway.
And Jack was not encouraged when in this speaker, a portly
gentleman in high leather gaiters and a short skirted frock under
the tails of which his hands were now thrust, he recognized the
victim of his robbery that afternoon.</p>

<p>Squire Kendrick's face was inflamed with the anger into which he
had lashed himself whilst denouncing the outrage suffered. For
audience he had a couple of rustics, the landlord in shirt sleeves
and apron, a man who held a constable's staff and a couple of
tough-looking fellows who at a glance might be recognized for Bow
Street runners.</p>

<p>It was not the sort of company into which Jack o'Lantern would
normally have cared to thrust himself. Yet now he swaggered in, a
smile on his lips, a jauntiness in his step, fully approved by Mr
Lessingham who followed more closely than ever upon the parlour's
sanded floor. Heads were turned to see who came, and the landlord
was detaching himself from the group to give welcome to these new
guests, when Jack's hearty hail momentarily arrested them.</p>

<p>He had taken a swift step aside, away from his companion, and
tossed up his head with a laugh of satisfaction.</p>

<p>'Well met, my hearties,' he greeted the Bow Street men, 'and in
the very nick of time. If it's Jack o'Lantern ye're hunting, I'll
be claiming the reward. For here you have him, led by the nose into
your very arms for you.' And he flung out a hand to indicate Mr
Lessingham.</p>

<p>There was a moment's silent, round-eyed amazement. Then it was
Squire Kendrick who moved. His head craned forward on his stout
neck, and his eyes bulging, he advanced on Mr Lessingham. Mr
Lessingham, more taken aback than any of them by what he accounted
a futile impudence, was uttering a fleeting laugh when Squire
Kendrick flung out an accusing arm.</p>

<p>'Seize him,' he roared. 'I recognize him.' And at the word the
Bow Street runners were upon Mr Lessingham like hounds upon a
stag.</p>

<p>He struggled, panting and snarling in their arms, turning a face
of fury upon the squire.</p>

<p>'What do you mean, you pot-bellied dotard? You recognize
me?'</p>

<p>The Squire was upon him, whilst the runners held him.</p>

<p>'I mean this, you impudent rogue. This!' He seized the
sword-belt of Spanish leather with the pretty oak-leaf pattern,
upon which the ready-witted Jack o'Lantern had counted when he so
boldly made his staggering announcement. 'I may not recognize your
face, for that was masked; but, ecod! I recognize my own baldrick,
ay, and the sword of which you robbed me this very afternoon, you
damned hedge-creeper.'</p>

<p>The constable rolled forward importantly. 'Here. Give way whiles
I search him.'</p>

<p>Lessingham abandoned the struggle, commanding himself now that
he began to recognize that violence would not get him out of this
trap. Forth from his pockets they brought a gold snuff-box on the
lid of which was the squire's crest, a hand holding aloft an
oak-leaf, and a heavy purse in which, in addition to the guineas,
there was a diamond ring of price which had left the squire's
finger three hours ago.</p>

<p>Mr Lessingham strove desperately to be calm. 'It looks like
evidence, but it isn't. I can explain it all.'</p>

<p>'Ecod! so you shall,' chortled the squire. 'At Bow Street
tomorrow morning. Keep your lies for the magistrate. Away with
him.'</p>

<p>'Tomorrow morning will be too late, you fools,' Lessingham was
suddenly beside himself, thinking of what would happen in the
morning. 'I have an engagement to keep tonight. An important
engagement. You shall hear me now, sir.'</p>

<p>They drove him to frenzy with their mockery until the squire,
wearying of the sport, bade them away with the rascal.</p>

<p>The constable was looking round. 'But where's the gentleman that
took him?' he asked.</p>

<p>He was answered by a clatter of departing hoofs on the kidney
stones outside. Jack o'Lantern was proving true to his fame. And it
was on the big black horse that he rode away, leaving the bay mare
as further evidence against Mr Lessingham.</p>
