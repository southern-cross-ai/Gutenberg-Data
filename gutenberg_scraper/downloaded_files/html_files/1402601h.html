<p>Production Notes:</p>
<p>This work combines several works published separately. The
main one, catalogued in the Battye Library of Western Australia
as "Report for the Information of His Excellency the Governor of
Western Australia, and the Promoters of the North-Western
Expedition of 1864, on the Voyage and the Resources of the
Districts Explored", contains reports dated 1864 to WA Governor
Hampton by James Martin (published separately in the Journal of
the Royal Geographic Society of London) and Frederick Panter,
together with Martin's 1863 and 1864 Journals. To these have been
added a journal of the captain of the ship <i>Flying Foam</i>,
undertaking the first voyage, and Panter's Journal of the 1864
voyage.</p>
<p>All were originally published in the <i>Perth Gazette</i> or
<i>The Inquirer and Commercial News</i> and are available on the
<i>Trove</i> website.</p>

<h2>1. <em>Report for the Information of His Excellency the
Governor of Western Australia, and the Promoters of the
North-Western Expedition of 1864, on the Voyage and the Resources
of the Districts Explored</em> by <span class="aa">James
Martin</span>.*</h2>
<p class="foot">[* This Report accompanied the narrative of a
second expedition, in which Mr. Martin was engaged, in 1864,
having the same objects as that of 1863, namely the discovery of
new tracts of pastoral country in North-Western Australia. The
commander of the expedition was Mr. F. K. Panter. (Text taken
from RGS Journal, Vol. XXXV (1865), pp. 268-289&mdash;ED.)]</p>
<p><span class="aa">The</span> voyage from Champion Bay to the
anchorage in Brecknock Harbour occupied 25 days, owing to a
succession of light and contrary winds after passing North-West
Cape. During this period two incidents only call for especial
remark; namely, a visit to Bedout Island, and the discovery of a
dangerous reef.</p>
<p>The visit to Bedout Island was resolved upon in consequence of
adverse winds. From careful observations made, the position of
the highest land seems to be in longitude E. 118° 56' 20",
latitude S. 19° 40' 45"; according to the charts, longitude E.
119°, latitude 19° 36' 20"; according to Norrie's list, longitude
E. 118° 52', latitude S. 19° 29'. These data show an extreme
difference in the position of the island amounting to 8 minutes
of longitude and 11 of latitude. Ships sailing in this direction,
therefore, should approach the island cautiously. The island is
about a mile in length; its mean breadth is half a mile. It
appears to be formed as islands are usually formed in the centre
of circular coral-reefs or atolls; it is merely a heap of
coral-sand piled up upon a sandstone point of ancient elevation,
whose dip is about 15° to the westward. This has gradually become
clothed with soil capable of supporting a coarse and stunted
vegetation. The rock forming the basis of the island is a
trappean sandstone composed of particles derived from the
decomposition of greenstones and basalts, consisting chiefly of
feldspar and hornblende grains, devoid of external crystalline
form, with which are mingled quartzose grains and mica-flakes
derived from other sources. The diameter of the encircling reef
is about 3 miles; the space between the reef and the island is
not more than 6 or 7 feet below low-water mark, in any place.
There was no water upon the island. The anchorage 3 miles to the
southward of Bedout Island, in 6 fathoms at low water, is good.
High tide at full and change of the moon occurs at 10.50
<small>A.M.</small> Rise of tide (spring) 24 feet. The island is
at present the resort of pelicans and turtles.</p>

<br>
<p>On Thursday, the 29th of March, we sighted Caffarelli Island
towards sunset, and sailed a course midway between that island
and the Brue Rock. But at 8.30 <small>P.M.</small>, it being very
dark and the weather threatening, we shortened sail; before this
was quite accomplished we struck upon a reef. After striking, the
vessel drifted into 25 fathoms water. At 8.45 <small>P.M.</small>
the anchor was let go, with 60 fathoms of chain. Half an hour
afterwards it became necessary to cast a second anchor, with 60
fathoms of heavier cable. During the night a gale from the S.S.E.
gradually sprang up. At noon, on the 30th March, the smaller of
the two cables parted, whereby we lost the kedge anchor and 70
fathoms of chain. The starboard anchor, weighing 12 cwt., with 60
fathoms of chain, dragged for about 30 minutes, when, just as the
preparations were made to unshackle it and try what sails could
do, it held; nor did the most violent bursts of the gale again
start it. This reef is not laid down upon the charts. The point
of the reef where we struck is between 5 and 6 miles from the
westernmost point of Caffarelli; the island bearing E.S.E. The
reef, on its northern and southern sides, is of a flattened
horseshoe shape, and it extends as far as we can see towards
Caffarelli. It is awash at three-quarter flood-tide. According to
the charts there should be a passage of 14 miles here, between
the Brue Rock and Caffarelli, with soundings from 15 to 25
fathoms.</p>

<h3><span class="aa">The District of the Glenelg; Climate,
Extent, Pastoral Resources, and General Capabilities of the
Soil</span>.</h3>
<p>Partially surrounded by sea and deeply indented with noble
harbours, this district, so far as longitude E. 125° 15', may be
said to enjoy a sea climate. The two periods during which
meteorological observations have been made are far too short to
admit of any precise conclusions on climatological questions even
with respect to the particular months during which they were
recorded; but as they do not differ greatly from results which
might have been predicated of the district, taking its
geographical situation alone as argument, they may be of some
slight value, although, doubtless, they will have to undergo many
alterations and corrections hereafter. These observations,
together with our experience of the weather and the appearance of
the country, rivers, and vegetation, all confirm the supposition
that there are two rainy and one dry season in the year. The
first wet season commences about December, and as we find the
country everywhere clothed with the richest vegetation of about a
month or six weeks' growth, whilst young leaves of such trees as
the eucalypti are parched with the sun, it is probable the first
and heaviest rains end in February; to these succeeds a period of
warm clear weather lasting until the end of March, when the sky
again becomes cloud-bearing, but at this season with
thunderstorms only. The mornings of April were almost always
cloudless, or with high cumulus and cirrus of small amount; but
in the afternoon or evening dense banks of cumulus appeared
generally upon the eastern horizon, working up against a westerly
or sea breeze, and terminating nearly every day in a thunderstorm
with rain. These storms rarely lasted more than an hour; they
travelled quickly. In the months of June and July the sky is
again cloudless, and the various grasses ripen slowly: the heat
of the noonday sun being tempered by exceedingly heavy dews and
cool sea-breezes. On one of the hottest days in July (19th),
1863, sitting in the sun or in the shade during midday bivouac
was a matter of indifference, although the thermometers at the
time stood at 122° in the sun and 94° in the shade, at a distance
of 45 miles from the coast-line and at an elevation of only 200
feet above mean sea-level. This, the hottest season of the year,
lasts until the heavy rains in December. During the latter wet
and the succeeding dry seasons the mean temperature appears high;
this is caused by the high readings of the minimum thermometers:
they seldom register less than 80° in April and 65° in June and
July, yet the nights rarely feel oppressive. Lightning to the
east and north-east occurs nearly every night in March, April,
and May. In June and July the days are bright and cloudless: the
nights cool and refreshing. The health of the party has in no
case suffered from climatic causes; slight inflammation of the
conjunctiva has attacked a few who have been subjected to
unavoidable exposure; there has been one case of diarrh&oelig;a,
and one of dysentery,&mdash;both yielded to a single dose of
chlorodyne; and one attack of fever, of a typhoid nature, which
was successfully treated with quinine.</p>
<p>The mean atmospheric pressure, temperature, &amp;c., is shown
in the following Table:&mdash;</p>
<p align="center"><a name="Table-1" id="Table-1"></a><img alt=""
width="640" src="1402601h-images/Table-1.jpg"></p>
<p>The hygrometric conditions, &amp;c., are detailed in the
annexed Table:&mdash;</p>
<p align="center"><a name="Table-2a" id="Table-2a"></a><img alt=
"" width="640" src="1402601h-images/Table-2a.jpg"></p>
<p>The direction of the winds, reduced to eight points of the
compass, and the force estimated by the Beaufort notation from
1-12 (observations being made at 9 <small>A.M.</small>, 3
<small>P.M.</small>, and 9 <small>P.M.</small>) are recorded in
the Table subjoined:&mdash;</p>
<p align="center"><a name="Table-2b" id="Table-2b"></a><img alt=

<p>The extent of the known portion of the Glenelg
district&mdash;that is, from the meridian of E. 125° 15' to the
sea-coast, and from the parallel of S. 16° 15', to the latitude
of Camden Harbour&mdash;includes only 2925 square miles; of which
area, deducting one-third for stony ridges, an excessive amount,
and the sea-inlets Doubtful Bay, George Water, &amp;c., 1,000,000
acres are suited to the depasturing of sheep. Of these 1,000,000
acres, about 100,000 acres are adapted to the cultivation of rice
and similar grain; 250,000 acres are especially favourable to the
growth of spices, sugar, tea, and coffee; even cereals at high
altitudes, and at certain seasons of the year, might be grown at
any rate in sufficient quantities to meet the requirements of a
pastoral and agricultural population. It is essentially a
wool-growing country; it would be difficult to conceive a more
luxuriantly grassed and watered territory; at the very lowest
estimate it would carry a sheep to an acre, but in some picked
spots there would be no risk in quadrupling that number of stock
per acre, especially if sheep-farming were here practised with
such intelligence as may be found in the tropical and subtropical
districts of the Eastern Colonies of Australia. The district,
however, is neither fitted for cattle nor horses, except they be
paddock-fed.</p>
<p>The islands westward of Brecknock Harbour, although quite as
stony as the Glenelg district, are superbly grassed and watered.
Augustus Island contains 56,000 acres of pastoral land, after
deducting 0.4 of its whole area on account of the deep bays with
which its shores are indented. Byam Martin's and Heywood's
islands give 20,000 acres more. There are, therefore, about
80,000 acres of the richest pastoral land upon these islands,
capable of carrying 80,000 sheep. All this country is so superior
in grazing capabilities to the best districts occupied in the
southern parts of Western Australia, that it is difficult to
institute a comparison.</p>
<p><i>Mineral Resources</i>.&mdash;Excluding building materials,
the chief mineral resources are copper and iron.</p>
<p>1. <i>Copper</i>.&mdash;Indications of copper-lodes are to be
met with in several parts of the Glenelg district; whether these
lodes will be found hereafter to yield sufficient quantities to
be profitably worked remains to be seen. Other specimens are
collected than appear in the following list; but as the means of
identification are not now to be obtained, their examination must
be made at some future time:&mdash;</p>

<p>2. <i>Iron</i>.&mdash;Hydrous oxides, veins of both
crystalline and amorphous iron-ore, together with nodular masses
of specular iron-ore, highly crystalline and of considerable
size, occur abundantly throughout the district. In Brecknock
Harbour, at the base of Mount Lookover, and in the summer bed of
the Glenelg, vast quantities of these examples may be found;
scarcity of manual labour alone can prevent these ores of iron
from becoming an important resource to the Glenelg district when
occupied. Titaniferous iron-sand occurs plentifully wherever the
formation is either basaltic or sedimentary; it is even found
largely predominating in soundings of from 10 to 15 fathoms, at a
distance of several miles from the coast-line.</p>
<p>Of the existence of an extensive gold deposit there is no
evidence. From the discovery of exceedingly minute particles in
the mud of the Glenelg River, and from the finding of a single
specimen of nagyagite, an auroplumbiferous telluret, search, if
made, should be directed towards the source of the Glenelg River
and thence southward as far as the FitzRoy River and the
"provincia aurifera" of the old charts.</p>
<p>Precious stones will not be found in sufficient quantity to be
of economic value; indifferent specimens of topazes, sapphires,
zircons, rubies, agate, &amp;c., will reward the seeker in almost
any stream-bed; more rarely beryl, chalcedony, porzellanspath,
obsidian, and flint, will be found.</p>
<p><i>Building Materials</i>.&mdash;The principal building stones
are basalt and sandstones of various kinds, micaceous,
argillaceous, and pseudo-crystalline. The latter, as it has no
tendency to split in one direction more than another, may be
termed a freestone: it is nearly white in colour, and can be
procured in vast quantities upon the surface. The argillaceous
variety is a flagstone well fitted for street flagging, steps,
&amp;c.; it would likewise be found effective in ecclesiastical
architecture.</p>
<p>Limestone yielding lime for building purposes is found in
several localities; the specimens obtained from the range of
hills to the westward of George Water contain the highest
percentage of lime. In the district of the Upper Glenelg there
are fine varieties of crystalline limestone of the saccharine
kind, together with large deposits of a true magnesian limestone
of a pearly lustre. Until an accurate examination of the
palæontological contents and petrological relations of these
limestones be made, their precise value cannot be more exactly
determined.</p>
<p><i>Indigenous Vegetable Productions</i>.&mdash;The following
is a very imperfect sketch of the resources which the indigenous
vegetation furnishes to this district. In grouping these
according to the products afforded by them, the variety,
abundance, colossal size of many and the durability of some,
first attract the attention. By far the greater number of trees,
valued for their timber, may be included among the Eucalypti,
several species of which here attain a height but little inferior
to the <i>E. globulus</i>, or bluegum-tree of Victoria. The
flooded gum-tree (<i>E. rostrata</i>), the white gum (<i>E.
acervula</i>), and the ironbark-tree (<i>E. resinifera</i>), are
all to be found here in situations where, although too distant
from the coast to export, they will prove invaluable to the
future settler. Other species of Eucalypti, <i>e.g</i>. <i>E.
aspera, ferruginea, citriodora, aurantiaca,
ph&oelig;nicea</i>,&mdash;besides their notable service in the
bush as ample shade-givers, will all prove useful woods to the
settler and to the artisan.</p>
<p>Upon the dividing ranges between the Prince Regent's River and
the Glenelg, and in many other localities, the <i>Callitris
verrucosa</i>, a pine not unfrequently met with throughout the
interior of the Australian continent, from Victoria westward and
northward to Champion Bay, Shark's Bay, and Arnheim's
Land,&mdash;here, in the above-mentioned district, attains a size
rendering it an object of great value. It is fitted for all the
usual purposes to which deal is applied in buildings generally,
and it occasionally reaches dimensions that suffice for the
making of masts and spars of moderate size. The wood is nearly of
equal value with the well-known <i>Dammara australis</i>, or
Kauri pine. Perfectly straight trees of the following
admeasurements are common:&mdash;Circumference near the base, 8
feet; 5 feet from the ground, 7 feet; approximate height of the
whole tree, 100 feet. Sir George Grey speaks of this tree (vol i.
p. 275) as "fit for the purposes either of building or making
spars for vessels"; he adds, "it is abundant and good, and could
be readily and cheaply exported, if they were cut in the vicinity
of the streams, and floated down to the sea in the rainy season,
whereby all land carriage would be avoided." This Callitris is
frequently associated with the <i>Araucaria excelsa</i> on the
higher ranges both inland and on the sea-coast.</p>
<p>A melaleuca, very closely allied to if not identical with the
<i>Melaleuca leucodendron</i> of India, from whose leaves the
cajeput oil of commerce is extracted, grows abundantly, and
attains an enormous size. There are many other trees yielding
timber in every respect suitable to the requirements of the
cabinet-maker, whether of plain or ornamental works.</p>
<p><i>Fruits</i>.&mdash;Amongst the edible indigenous fruits,
those of the "quandang" or native peach-tree (<i>Santalum
preissianum</i>) deserves first mention: the fruit,
notwithstanding its thin pericarp and strongly acidulous taste,
is grateful and largely available for food. Other fruiting bushes
of the same order (<i>Santalaceæ</i>) yield berries of a pleasant
flavour.</p>
<p>Three species of Cissus are found: two run along the ground or
entwine amongst shrubs, the third is arborescent. All bear fruit
in size, appearance, and flavour like the small black cluster
grape, and in bunches from ten to forty. The Baobab-tree yields a
drupe as large as a cocoa-nut: the pulp and seeds of this fruit
are very palatable; the bark and spongy inner wood, when soaked
in boiling water, afford an agreeable mucilaginous drink not
unlike maccaroni in taste. These trees attain an enormous
diameter (50 feet in one instance), but they rarely exceed 25
feet in height. The young leaves and seeds of the palm fruit are
of an excellent flavour: when green the seeds or nuts are not
dissimilar to the English filbert.</p>
<p><i>Native Vegetables</i>.&mdash;Amongst the indigenous plants
available as culinary vegetables the fine bean, which grows so
abundantly on the sand-hills of the coast, offers, when boiled, a
nutritious diet: as a species it is as yet unnamed The pea, Abrus
precatorius, is plentiful all over the district: its valuable
properties as a legume are recognised even by the aborigines.
Horses eat greedily the branches, ripe seeds, and leaves. Several
herbaceous members of the small family <i>Basellaceæ</i> may be
regarded as a substitute for spinach. The amylaceous roots of the
Dioscorea, "warrein", and Typha, "yun-jid" or "adjico", are here,
as in the southern parts of Western Australia, important articles
of vegetable food of the natives.</p>
<p><i>Fibres</i>.&mdash;The lemon grass, <i>Anatherum
schoenanthus</i>, is pretty generally distributed throughout the
district: this and one of the Liliaceæ, not unlike a dwarf
<i>Phormium tenax</i>, yield a fibre from which the aborigines
manufacture a strong and well-made twine. But of all the
indigenous fibre-yielding leaves that of the palm deserves
especial examination: it is a species of Livistonia growing in or
near to every stream; its leaf, even if the fibre prove useless
for cordage, will be valuable for the manufacture of hats,
umbrellas, &amp;c., suited to the climate. It might even be
employed in the making of any coarse kind of paper.</p>
<p><i>Medicinal Plants, Gums, &amp;c</i>.&mdash;In this division
of the indigenous vegetable productions, little can be safely
predicated until opportunity has been afforded for an
investigation into the medicinal properties of the plants already
discovered; which, doubtless, form a very inconsiderable number
of this class within even the limited area explored. The abrus
and the anatherum, the pea and the lemon grass, as of most
frequent occurrence, may be considered first. From the roots of
the former we expect a perfect substitute for liquorice in every
respect; from an infusion of the leaves of the latter, we know,
from Indian experience, we can obtain a tea acknowledged to be
stomachic, tonic, and useful in dyspepsia, From the
convolvulaceæ, one species of which is included in the genus
Ipomæa, we may extract deoretin, affirmed to be identical with
jalapin; from a second species, of the genus convolvulus,
scammony or a cathartic resin of equal value may be prepared from
the expressed juice of its roots and stalks. From the root-stocks
of the typha, extracts astringent and diuretic are obtainable. An
elastic gum, something like Indian-rubber, and gum tragacynth,
have been found. Sandaric resin can be procured from the pine and
gum-resins of various descriptions from several of the
eucalypti.</p>
<p>The bark of some of the trees indigenous to this district will
yield a tonic and stimulant, depending on the presence of an
alkaloid, which there is every reason to believe will make them
become an article of export ere many years. The unlimited
quantities of the melaleuca may be expected to produce an oil not
inferior to the cajeputi oil extracted even by the simple Indian
process. There are but few genera of the myrtaceous trees and
shrubs from whose leaves and flowers we fail to extract a greater
or lesser quantity of essential oil&mdash;aromatic, volatile,
though somewhat camphoric.</p>
<p>As perfume plants the <i>Chamælaucieæ</i>, the <i>Rutaceæ</i>,
and the <i>Labiatæ</i> abound in species; but to what extent they
will prove of value for perfume distillation is is difficult to
foresee. Lastly, the Acaciæ, producing flowers in the utmost
profusion (especially the large species fringing the upper
Glenelg and nearly all the freshwater streams of the district),
possessing such powerful and agreeable odours, may be indicated
as proximate objects of commercial value when this luxuriant
country shall become the home of an intelligent people.</p>
<p><i>Animal Products</i>.&mdash;To the geological character of
the land its almost universal pre-oolitic fauna may be traced.
Here, as elsewhere throughout the Australian continent, the
pouch-bearing mammals, Marsupiata, rank next to man, so far as
the development of their physical organization is concerned.
These native animals, particularly the larger species of the
Macropidæ, are extremely numerous in the Glenelg district: the
skin of the <i>M. major</i> and the <i>M. laniger</i>, or large
red kangaroo, as well as the skins of the smaller varieties, will
form no mean item in the resources of the early settlers; whilst
these fur-clad skins are regarded as articles of commerce, the
value of the carcase of the animals, as excellent meat, must not
be wholly ignored.</p>
<p>Of birds, which are numerous both as to species and
individuals&mdash;the emu, geese, ducks, the native turkey
(<i>Otis Australasianus</i>), the "ngowoo" or native pheasant
(<i>Leipoa ocellata</i>), the jungle-fowl (<i>Megapodius
tumulus</i>), the lyre bird (<i>Menura superba</i>), and very
many others, may be mentioned as valuable either for their flesh,
brilliant plumage, oil, or eggs.</p>
<p>The waters of the district, both fresh and salt, are rich in
products which await enterprise alone to raise them. Foremost
amongst these ranks the dugong (<i>Halicore</i>), a marine
herbivorous animal included in the Cetacea, observed in both
Doubtful Harbour and Camden Sound: its flesh alone, which is not
unlike beef, would make it a welcome visitant; but regarded as
the source of an invaluable oil, superior in a nearly twofold
ratio to the best cod-liver oil, its annual visit would give rise
to a fishery attended with greater profit, outlay and other
things being taken into account, than that of the sperm oil. The
pearl oyster of commerce, the species valued for its nacreous
substance, is undoubtedly to be found here plentifully, for the
aborigines who would not be likely to undertake any excessive
labour to procure them, very commonly wear them as an ornament
suspended round the neck. The <i>Tridacna</i>, a conchiferous
mollusk, found upon any point of the coast between North-West
Cape and the Prince Regent's River, might be included in the
pearl-oyster fishery; for although its shell has no valuable
nacreous lining, in it pearls of great beauty and of considerable
size are not unfrequently obtained. The trepang fishery could not
be profitably carried on by Europeans. Whales and seals have been
more than once seen within the harbours of this district. There
are fine beds of oysters for the table in Brecknock Harbour:
turtles, crabs, cray-fish, &amp;c., abound. Deep-sea fishery
would in all probability be a profitable occupation. The
fresh-water streams teem with fish of large size and of excellent
flavour.</p>
<p><i>Harbours, Rivers, and Internal Communication</i>.&mdash;The
district of the Glenelg is especially rich in bays,
river-harbours, and sheltered anchorages. Along its western
shore, from Collier Bay to Camden Sound inclusive, a vessel may
at all times select a safe position with good holding ground in
15 fathoms water, and shelter from either the islands or the
great coral-reef known as Montgomery Shoal. Doubtful Bay into
which the Glenelg flows after receiving the Gairdner and the Fish
Rivers, both considerable streams, and almost an innumerable host
of minor tributaries, any one of which in the settled districts
of Western Australia would be called a river&mdash;is a
magnificent sheet of water, 9 miles in length from north to
south, and 6 miles in breadth from east to west. Although in the
summer vast quantities of water may from all sides pour into the
bay, and the tides gain additional force thereby, yet as it is
thoroughly protected from every wind and from a heavy sea by a
range of islands and reefs to seaward, and the natural breakwater
of the Montgomery Islands and the coral-reef, 14 miles still
further to the westward,&mdash;as the holding ground is of the
very best,&mdash;and as there is an abundance of room in which to
work the largest ship,&mdash;Doubtful Bay, when this portion of
the Australian coast is colonised, will prove a harbour of refuge
second to none. From the great rise and fall of the tide also, 36
feet, this bay is a good site for works necessary to the
repairing of ships. A better terminus to the system of Australian
telegraphs, when connected with those of Europe and Asia, it will
be difficult to find. About the centre of a large mangrove-swamp
on the eastern side of the bay, there is a red conical hill,
which vessels entering by "Foam Passage" should get in a line
with the centre of the passage; at a distance of 2 miles westward
of "Foam Passage", the summit of the red cone will just appear
above the horizon within the bay (bearing true east by south);
this course should be kept for 2½ miles within the bay when
Success Channel, the western entrance into George Water, will
bear due north. The anchorage is safe anywhere within the bay;
but in the vicinity of the spot indicated by the above bearings,
a vessel at anchor will feel the tidal effect to a much less
degree than elsewhere. There is but one known shoal within the
bay, and that is situated at a distance of 4 miles from the red
cone, on a line bearing N. 31° W. from the hill. At spring-tides
this sand-bank was seen dry at low water. Soundings through "Foam
Passage" and to the anchorage recommended are not less than 10
fathoms at low water; sand and mud bottom. Wood and water are to
be had without difficulty in Doubtful Bay.</p>
<p>Brecknock Harbour, area nearly 20 square miles, is so
thoroughly land-locked that a ship once at anchor, need fear no
wind. The coast line within the harbour is everywhere indented
with beautiful bays. There are several picturesque islands, on
nearly all of which there is fresh water; every valley of the
main has its rippling brook of the purest water running down to
the beach. Ships entering from Camden Sound have but two dangers
to avoid; one is the bank extending northwards from the pinnacle
rock,&mdash;the other is the rocky bar between Careening Island
and the circular reef. Until further surveys have been made,
Rogers' Strait is considered a very dangerous entrance on account
of the reefs, and Camden Harbour a hazardous anchorage by reason
of its terrace-like bottom, which at some tides has not more than
half or three quarters of a fathom of water. Brecknock Harbour is
an excellent place for watering ships, and drift-wood is abundant
near the line of high water; but timber, fit for spars and the
repairs of ships, grows at too great a distance inland to be
available.</p>

<br>
<p>Vessels entering from Camden Sound should do so only with the
flood-tide and with a fair wind; the rocks to the south-west of
New Island, to be seen at all times, may be passed in
mid-channel; but on sighting the Pinnacle, which is close to the
southern shore, a course about one-eighth of a mile distant from
New Island will command the deepest water, running from 13 to 14
fathoms at the narrowest part of the entrance; when the Pinnacle
bears south, a course E. 10° N. may be sailed for 2½ miles, when
the northern entrance opens out into Camden Sound, bearing
north-west, all bearings true; thence, a course E.N.E. of 3 miles
may be steered, with 6 and 7 fathoms of water, either towards
Green Island or Camden Harbour. Vessels above 100 tons register
may select any spot within these limits, and obtain safe
anchorage. Vessels of less than 100 tons register, with a draught
of about 10 feet, after crossing the rocky bar north-east by
north of Careening Island, may find a perfectly secure anchorage,
anywhere in mid-channel, as far as the entrance to Camden
Harbour, with not less than 3 and 4 fathoms of water; all these
soundings are at low tide. For beaching a vessel on a soft
bottom, it would be difficult to find a better spot than the
sand-patch on Careening Island; whilst if a hard even bottom be
desired, for repairs of keel, &amp;c., the deep bay whose head
bears south-east from Mount Lookover, distant half a mile from
the base of the mount, will be found convenient and safe. The
time of high water within Brecknock Harbour, at full and change
of the moon, or the Establishment of the Port, is at noon; that
is 40 minutes later than in Camden Sound. Spring rise of tide 30
feet; neap, 12 feet. The tides rush through the entrances with
great force; it would not be advisable for any vessel to attempt
the passages under sail, with an opposing tide.</p>
<p>"Success Channel", the north-west passage from Doubtful Bay to
George Water, is safe for vessels of any draught, provided the
flood tide be made use of; and anchorage in George Water or
Maitland Bay is good; thence, to the lower rapids of the Glenelg,
distant 40 miles from "Foam Passage", the river Glenelg may be
described as safe and easy to navigate with cargo-boat or small
steamer. Above the rapids cargo-boats might ply, for fully half
the year, to a distance of 25 miles; but this last-mentioned
navigation would be uncertain between the months of May and
November. The Gairdner and Fish Rivers have a tide of not less
than 10 feet; water communication to a limited extent, therefore,
could be depended upon in these rivers for the same period as in
the case of the upper Glenelg.</p>
<p>With regard to the internal communication of the district, it
will suffice to state that there would be no great difficulty in
the construction of roads: but lines of railway would in several
directions entail great engineering difficulties, owing to the
naturally precipitous character of the hills, and deep
stream-beds of the rivers and gullies.</p>

<h3><span class="aa">The District of Roebuck Bay; Climate,
Extent, Pastoral Resources and General Capabilities of the
Soil</span>.</h3>
<p>The country explored to the eastward of Roebuck Bay between
the 17° and 18° S. lat. and along the sea-coast from the head of
Roebuck Bay to Cape Latouche Treville, although only 150 miles to
the southward of the Glenelg district, offers a remarkable
contrast in point of climatic phenomena. The mean temperature in
the shade is here only 64° lower than in the Glenelg district,
and the solar radiation 50 miles eastward of the sea-coast,
although generally 5° lower, is occasionally a few degrees
higher; nevertheless the amount of humidity in the atmosphere is
here very greatly decreased. In this month, May, the weather is
found to resemble that of the Glenelg District in July. Clear
cloudless days and nights prevailed, and only such winds, a few
miles inland, as serve to keep the air in a perceptible motion;
so that the days, although the thermometers read high, are not so
warm but that a man can walk 20 or 30 miles without inconvenience
from the heat; on one occasion, indeed, our exploring party
walked 45 miles of course between the hours of 6
<small>A.M.</small> and 9 <small>P.M.</small> The annexed
meteorological tables will in part account for this. The dryness
of the atmosphere is like that of the Champion Bay district in
the month of October or early in November, when a man can work
eight or ten hours of day in the open air without suffering on
account of heat. May seems to be an early spring month: the trees
are just coming into flower and the grass is everywhere green;
the natives take considerable trouble to burn their hunting
grounds to entice the game with young feed; but so speedily does
the grass grow again, that in a few days the burnt place is once
more green, before the ash of the former grass has been displaced
by wind or showers. For nearly a week before the party landed,
showers were occasionally seen to fall over various parts of the
country, but during the period of the land exploration no rain
fell. There was more or less dew every night, but an hour after
sunrise it had all disappeared.</p>

<p>The extent of explored country within the limits already
mentioned as far eastward only as the meridian of 123° includes
an area of 3300 square miles; but from what has been seen at the
most distant stations from our depôt, there is every reason to
believe that the same kind of country extends eastward at least
as far as the Fitzroy River, in long. E. 123° 30'; and southward
we know not to what extent. The known portion, however, contains
2,112,000 acres of perfectly level country,&mdash;so level that
with the exception of the sea-coast range of sand-hills and three
little hummocks near Cape Villarêt, no spot traversed eastward
from the depôt exceeded 50 feet in altitude. Of these 2,112,000
acres, perfectly level, well-grassed and almost treeless plains
occupy 80,000 acres, the one-half of which lie round the south
and east shores of Roebuck Bay, and the remainder inland from or
east of Lagrange Bay. These plains possess chiefly an alluvial
soil capable of growing many tropical productions; they are
fringed with belts of moderately large Cajeputi trees. In the
native wells, which are found on these plains at intervals of not
more than a mile, water is obtainable within 16 or 18 feet,
whilst within the belt of Cajeputi trees it is found plentifully
within 4 or 5 feet of the surface. The rest of the country
consists of grassy plains with shrubs and small timber chiefly of
the order Myrtaceæ, sub-orders Chamælaucieæ, Leptospermeæ,
Myrteæ, not growing so thickly as to impede rapid riding except
where thickets occur. These thickets are rather difficult to
traverse on account of the mass of dead wood, the accumulation of
years, not because of the density of the vegetation; once burnt
thoroughly, as thickets they would disappear. The grass is fine,
sweet, and plentiful; our route crossed no sand plains or barren
places; in May the grass averages one foot in height, and it is
quite green. A distinguishing feature between the grass of the
Glenelg District and that found here must be mentioned, as upon
it is based the comparatively low estimate of sheep-grazing
capability. The grass grows in <i>tufts</i>. (This is also the
case in certain highly valued parts of the already settled
districts of Western Australia.) For this reason, as it is as
well to under-estimate the carrying capability of a newly
discovered country, a deduction of <i>one-half</i> its supposed
carrying power is now made, although it is more than probable
that the experience of the future settler will declare the amount
to be greatly underrated. This premised, the known parts of the
Roebuck Bay District, within the limits already mentioned, may be
safely asserted to be capable of carrying upwards of one million
of sheep.</p>
<p>No evidence of mineral resources was discovered in sufficient
quantities to warrant more extended research. Building materials
do not abound. The indigenous Vegetable resources are very
similar to those already named in reporting of the Glenelg
country. The Baobab, palm, and pine do not occur here, and the
timber generally can only be described as affording an ample
supply of firewood and an inferior material for fencing. With
respect to perfume plants, however, the whole district is
particularly rich. Nearly every tree and plant in flower yields a
strong and grateful odour; the dwarf myrtle, so common here,
perhaps, has the most powerful odour; but some of the acaciæ and
small shrubs possess scents exquisitely beautiful. The perfume of
the heliotrope, the violet, the clove pink, the rose, the stock,
were all recognised; but many others, although delicious, were
such as could not be likened to that of any commonly known plant
or flower. Such animal products as are found here are already
included in the list given of those within the district of the
Glenelg.</p>
<p><i>Harbours and Internal Communication</i>.&mdash;Roebuck Bay
was well explored by Mr. Arthur Du Boulay, during the absence of
the expedition inland. Six days were spent in its examination. It
is a sheet of water at high tide extending 15 miles inland and
having an opening from Cape Villarêt to the opposite coast of
Dampier Land of no less than 22 miles; but if a line be drawn
from Cape Villarêt to Point Gantheaume, the land dry at low water
is at no point distant more than 4 miles from that line. The bay
is thus reduced for the purposes of navigation to a trifling
indentation of the coast line not exceeding an average breadth of
2 miles at the most. The whole of this is very shallow, 3 fathoms
at low water, with the exception of a narrow channel running
parallel from Cape Villarêt along the south-east shore of the
bay. At a distance of 1½ mile to the north of Cape Villarêt this
channel has a depth of 12 fathoms, but on tracing it up the bay
it is found to shoal rapidly and ultimately disappeared at 6½
miles in a north-east direction. If a line due north from Cape
Villarêt be drawn, after crossing the narrow channel just
mentioned, for 20 miles extensive shoals are formed which give in
no instance deeper water than 4 fathoms upon that line. The
anchorage, however, in or near this deep channel is good and the
ship is protected from the strong south-east breezes by the
sand-hills of the coast; nor is it found a bad anchorage during
south-west, south, east, or north-east winds. No strong wind has
yet been registered from the west, north-west, or west. Only one
detached rock, dangerous to shipping, has as yet been seen, and
that is situated off Cape Villarêt, at a distance of about 1 mile
north by west from the beach at the foot of the Cape; it is well
above water at low tide. The bay has a series of fine sandy
beaches from Cape Villarêt in a north-east direction for 12
miles; to these succeeds a mangrove fringe, attaining its
greatest density and breadth at the head of the bay. High water
at full and change occurs at 10 <small>A.M.</small> Spring-tides
rise 23½ feet; neap-tide 12 feet.</p>
<p>Lagrange Bay as a harbour is of still less value than Roebuck
Bay. It is only an indentation of the coast line to the extent of
4 miles at the deepest part. Viewed from the high land on Cape
Latouche Treville it appears to be shallow. There was no
opportunity to obtain soundings in Lagrange Bay. From the hammock
on Cape Latouche Treville, whose summit is 180 feet above mean
sea-level, an excellent view of the hay was obtained extending
all round its coast line to Cape Bossut and Casuarina Reef. No
considerable stream, perhaps not a creek, falls into the sea by
this bay.</p>
<p>Throughout the country explored in this district there is an
entire absence of rivers and even creeks, except a number of very
short ones between Cape Villarêt and Cape Du Boulay. Land
transit, however, is exceedingly easy, for the country is
perfectly level; the soil, at a greater distance than 2 miles
from the sea coast, is a red sandy loam without stone and only
rarely showing a very fine gravel upon the surface. It is
sufficiently hard for heavy drays to traverse it in any
direction: nor does it seem likely to cut up much with continuous
traffic.</p>

<h3><span class="aa">The Aborigines of the District of Roebuck
Bay</span>.</h3>
<p>The tribes of natives in the interior excel those of the
sea-coast in bodily structure. They are more muscular, taller,
and apparently more intelligent; at any rate, the expression of
their countenances is more pleasing: some of those we met had a
profile more resembling that of a Polynesian, or a
Kel&oelig;nonesian of the first division (New Hebrides, &amp;c.),
rather than that of the second division to which the Australian
belongs. Of the form of the head (it is an argument from the
particular to the universal, for my data are founded upon the
examination of the only human skull discovered during the
exploration inland),&mdash;it is as well perhaps here to give the
chief particulars. The facial angle, as indicating the
proportions of the cranial cavity and the grade of intelligence,
contrasts very favourably with that of the lower types of the
Australian native; whilst this angle of the latter is included
within an arc of 85°, that of the skull before me measures 94°,
or only 1° less than the average facial angle of the European.
The occipito-frontal diameter measures 7.23 inches; the
inter-parietal 5.31 inches; the vertical height from the
glabello-occipital line 45 inches; from the level of the
glabello-occipital line on each side, across the middle of the
sagittal suture to the same point on the opposite side 11.75
inches; the longitudinal arc from the nasal depression along the
middle line of the skull to the occipital protuberance 13.1
inches; the horizontal circumference in the plane of a line
joining the glabella with the occipital protuberance 20.7 inches.
The walls of the cranial cavity are less thick than in the skull
of an adult aboriginal of the southern parts of Australia. The
malar bones are prominent; the zygomæ make a wide curve outwards,
giving breadth to the face. The upper jaw is so prognathic as to
give a very oblique insertion of the teeth.</p>
<p>The eyes of the inland aboriginal are black, and set very
deep; the nose in some is a great deal flattened; the nostrils in
a few instances were observed to be larger laterally than
forwards; the mouth exceeds the average size, but, generally, was
well formed, and without the usual accompaniment of thick lips.
The chin is of proportionate size, neither long nor broad. The
lower part of the face is prominent; the teeth are beautifully
even and white. The hair, when allowed to grow naturally, appears
in spiral locks about three or four inches in length, spreading
out all over the head; its texture may be described as wavy-crisp
or frizzled, not strongly; and its colour is what is generally
styled a jet-black. The prevailing fashion in both sexes seems to
be, to allow the hair to grow long and then to gather it all
smoothly to the back of the head, and there tie it in a knot
about the size of a cricket ball. No instance was seen of the
addition of colouring or oleaginous matters as beautifiers of the
hair. The moustache and beard are about equally abundant; these
possessions seem as much treasured as coveted: some who rejoiced
in them carefully bound the beard beneath the chin with a
wrapping of string, others trained the moustache into a
horizontal spiral after the fashion of the King of Italy; others
again whose upper lips were deficient in quantity of hair, wore
<i>false hair</i>, that is, they supplemented that deficiency by
a piece of dark-haired opossum skin, cat to the required
shape.</p>
<p>In colour these natives are decidedly <i>black</i>; as black
as we might expect to find a people in a locality elevated but a
few feet above mean sea-level&mdash;with large tracts of alluvial
soil&mdash;and near enough to the equator to feel the influence
of the moister character of tropical heat. There are, however,
two shades very distinctly marked, like the blonde and brunette
of the white race; in one of these shades a bluish hue
predominates, in the other the colour might be described as a
reddish black.</p>
<p>These natives of the interior wear no clothing whatever, and
their shelter from the cold and rainy weather seems to be of two
forms: first, a hut of the rudest description, made of a few
boughs piled loosely together, affording but little shelter from
either wind or rain; and secondly&mdash;an arrangement somewhat
more complicated but equally defective&mdash;a platform of
brushwood laid evenly to a height of about one foot above the
ground, beneath the centre of which a circular hole wider at the
base than at the top, is scraped out of the soil, deep enough and
of sufficient size to contain the persons of one or two
individuals coiled up, as it were, beneath the overhanging sides
of the cavity.</p>
<p>This kind of habitation is used, doubtlessly, in dry but cold
weather; when it rains, it is probable they make use of the
platform of sticks above the hole, as a sitting or reclining
place; it would answer to keep them from the wet earth and that
is all. For the greater part of the year, their primitive hut
would suffice in exposed situations, if protection of any kind be
needed; but during the periodic tropical rains these people,
resident in a level country where no cave or other natural
shelter is at hand, must practice no mean amount of patient
endurance. They seem, nevertheless, to attain a good old age, in
spite of privations and exposure; we fell in with several old men
and women who had evidently lived many summers more than fall to
the lot of Australian natives in general.</p>
<p>Foremost among the ornaments in common use by these people
ranks the pearl-oyster shell of the coast. The centre of this
shell, that is, so much of it as can be ground into an oval shape
whilst retaining the nacreous substance very nearly flat, is
either worn plain or engraved. In the manufacture of these plain
ornaments, nothing more is required than the grinding away of
about two-thirds of the entire substance of the margin of the
shell, the drilling of a hole through it near one end of the
smaller diameter, and the suspending of the shell by one or more
thicknesses of the native string. But the more valued ornament,
after passing through the processes enumerated, has its nacreous
surface completely covered with a lace-like pattern composed of
four and five sided figures, combined in a very curious manner
and included within one or several parallel elliptical lines
running equi-distant from the ground edge of the shell. These
figures composed of three or more series of the lines, are
engraved to a depth of about .025 of an inch; then the spaces are
filled up with a black pigment, a mixture of gum and charcoal.
Amongst the minor ornaments examined may be mentioned a necklace
made of the claws of a crab (Porcellana, a genus of anomurous
Crustacea found only occasionally on the north-west coast of
Australia): the pieces composing the necklace were about the size
and shape of large bugles, similar to those used in ladies' fancy
work; and a hair-pin made out of a kangaroo's tooth&mdash;an
incisor of the lower jaw of one of the larger species of
Macropidæ. These natives are as fond of personal decoration in
plastic colours done in small round spots upon the legs, arms,
and upper parts of the body, as other Australian tribes. Some
years ago, at a famous native festival in south-west Australia,
several men were painted round the neck in imitation of the then
fashionable ladies' lace-collars, with lappets down the breast:
this was very neatly executed with a white paint made of
pipe-clay, laid on in minute spots with an extempore brush; this
kind of painting we also noticed in the case of an individual
amongst the group we first met in the interior, but the colouring
included four tints and extended down to the feet in a
harlequin-like pattern.</p>
<p>As this race of people have no rivers or deep-sea inlets to
cross, the craft already described as commonly used by the
natives of the Glenelg district is of rare occurrence here. The
instrument of most general utility is in the form of a scoop;
with this they dig wells, and the indigenous roots used as food;
it is their basket and portmanteau: their water-jug and shovel.
It is of very varied size and shape, both these latter depending
upon the elbow of the tree from which it is cut; so important an
instrument is it, that as a rule it receives the highest possible
degree of ornamentation; it is carved, sometimes inside and
outside, with closely adjoining parallel lines, disposed in a
zigzag pattern. Some of the larger scoops are not carried from
place to place with the tribe, but left beneath some bush in the
neighbourhood of a well: these larger instruments are those which
receive the maximum amount of decoration. For cooking purposes
they use large shells, species of Strombus and Triton; (the seed
of the mangrove undergoes a most elaborate process in its
preparation as an article of food). They also make bags of
kangaroo skin, fastened with a twine made of the fibres of an
Anatherum, and a species of the Liliaceæ; a kind of twine is also
made here of a mixture of opossum hair and vegetable fibre;
another kind, which was found in use only as a means of
suspending the engraved shells, was made of human hair alone.</p>
<p>These natives do not seem to be acquainted with the use of the
womera, or throwing-stick. The spears we saw with each tribe or
party we presume to be hunting-weapons; these are ill-shapen and
not barbed; in some cases they were pointed at both ends; in
every case they were intended to be thrown by the hand from the
middle: some natives carried bundles of small spears only 3 feet
in length; these were no doubt designed to spear small birds,
whilst the thrower was in ambush. The usual stone hatchet of the
Australian native is everywhere found on this coast. The kiley,
however, is a superior instrument to that used by the aboriginal
of the south-west coast; its shape more nearly approaches the
bomerang of the Eastern Australian: but it is not so effective an
instrument either in war or in the chase; both the kiley and the
bomerang of Australia are instruments as inferior to that used by
the ancient Egyptians as their weapon was inferior to that of the
Assyrian huntsman. But notwithstanding the inferiority of the
kiley of these natives, it is a weapon in their hands worthy of
attention in an engagement; on a shield obtained, there were
several indentations made by the kiley. The shield alluded to
differs from that common to southern tribes in being cut out of
the solid; it has a handle with a sufficient space for the hand
of the holder also cut out of the same solid piece. Although
heavy, it seems to have done the original owner good service in
warding off blows from the kiley in its bizarre and rapid
flight.</p>
<p>As concerning the natives of the sea-coast, it will suffice to
state that they are inferior to the natives of the interior in
physical development; they are less cleanly in their persons and
less industrious in the chase. The same extraordinary mutilation,
referred to by the officers of the <i>Beagle</i> when describing
the sea-coast tribes of this district (Stokes, vol. i., page 117)
was observed by members of our expedition; but the custom does
not extend beyond the tribes of the coast.</p>
<p>The language of both sea-coast and inland tribes, judging from
a limited vocabulary of about seventy words, is agglutinate, with
Malay affinities few, obscure, and only partially recognised; the
dialects prevail over exceedingly small areas, as is the case
with eastern Kel&oelig;nonesian tribes. The following vocabulary,
in the construction of which the Italian vowel sounds * are
adopted, will serve to illustrate these remarks:&mdash;</p>
<p class="foot">[* The vowels marked with a grave accent are
long, those with an acute are short.]</p>
<p align="center"><a name="Table-5" id="Table-5"></a><img alt=""
src="1402601h-images/Table-5.jpg"></p>
<p>By this it will be seen that the language ignores sibilant
letters; many of our consonants these natives cannot pronounce at
all; <i>e.g</i>. t, and its compound th, f, g, &amp;c. In short,
the language may be said to be composed chiefly of vowel and
liquid sounds, with a limited number of consonants. The terminal
h in many of the native words given above is very strongly
marked, and is characteristic of and points prominently to the
origin of the dialect. The letter r is rolled in the native
pronunciation after the manner of the French.</p>

<p style="text-align:right; margin-right:10%;">Schooner <em>New
Perseverance</em>,</p>
<p align="right">Fremantle, June 6, 1864.</p>
<p><span class="aa">Sir</span>,&mdash;I have the honor to forward
the following Report relative to the result of an expedition to
the North-west coast of Western Australia, under my command. On
2nd March, 1864, I left Fremantle in the schooner <em>New
Perseverance</em>, 105 tons, William Ouston, master. On the 3rd
of April the vessel anchored in Brecknock Harbour, after a
tedious passage of one month's duration, owing to light and
contrary winds.</p>
<p>The only incident worthy of notice on the passage up was the
discovery of a reef extending about six miles S.S.E. from
Caffarelli Island, in long. 123 degs, lat. 16 degs. This reef was
discovered by the vessel running on it during the night of the
28th of March last. In the course of a few minutes the vessel was
"backed" off, and anchored in 25 fathoms water, about half-a-mile
south of the place on which she struck.</p>
<p>The following morning the wind rose to a hurricane, blowing
from the S.S.E., and lasting fourteen hours. During this time the
vessel was obliged to remain at anchor, surrounded almost as she
was by the reef. One anchor, with 50 fathoms of chain, was lost.
Luckily the large anchor (which dragged a little) held her until
the fury of the storm abated.</p>
<p>The day after my arrival at Brecknock Harbour, I started
inland with a party, consisting of Dr. Martin, Mr. David Shields,
first mate of the vessel, and native Dunedale. We travelled over
about 90 miles of country, which for pastoral, and much of it for
agricultural purposes, could not be excelled. I shall refrain
from entering into minute details concerning the soil, its
capabilities, &amp;c., as Dr. Martin will do so in his report.
The country we travelled over is abundantly watered by rivers and
streams of pure water.</p>
<p>Two rivers&mdash;the one I named the "Fish" river, and another
known as the "Gardner" river&mdash;afford water communication
with the Glenelg, and thence to the sea. The two former rivers
are navigable at high tide for large boats, the river and fall
being 10 feet. The water on them is perfectly fresh at both
tides.</p>
<p>The only minerals which I can state with certainly exists are
copper and iron. We found good indications of the former on Mount
Double Cone (7 miles in a direct line from Brecknock Harbour).
The latter exists in large quantities on the beach and in the
vicinity of Camden and Brecknock Harbours, in many places it can
be picked up almost in its pure state, especially under Mount
Lookover.</p>
<p>Timber for building purposes, &amp;c., is not plentiful on the
land over which I actually travelled, but exists in large
quantities on the McDonald Range (information received from Dr.
Martin).</p>
<p>Stone for building purposes is plentiful, both inland and on
the coast.</p>
<p>From the large number of small pearl oyster shells picked up I
have little doubt that valuable pearl oyster beds might be found
with but little trouble.</p>
<p>I visited many of the Islands outside Camden Harbour, all of
which (with two exceptions) I found to be permanently
watered.</p>
<p>Augustus and Byam Martin's were the two largest islands I
landed upon. The former, which contains about 56,000 acres, is
luxuriantly grassed, and watered by numerous streams; the latter
is well watered, but not so well grassed, and contains 12,000
acres. All the islands are very stony, including the above two
islands, I think I may safely assert that in the vicinity of
Brecknock and Camden Harbours there is one million and
sixty-eight thousand acres of land, which could scarcely be
surpassed, if equalled. I have every reason to believe that there
are immense tracts of similar country both to the south and
eastward of Brecknock Harbour.</p>
<p>Both Camden and Brecknock Harbours contain secure anchorage
for vessels of any tonnage; the latter Harbour is almost
land-locked and contains a small island, on which at low water a
vessel might be left high and dry on an almost level sand beach
to undergo repairs, &amp;c. Soundings have been taken in both
Harbours, and marked on the chart.</p>
<p>On the 24th of April I sailed for Roebuck Bay. On the passage
down the vessel anchored close in to Cape Borda, on the northern
part of Dampier's Land; it had been my intention to land here,
but owing to the unsettled state of the weather I was unable to
do so. Grass could be seen growing, apparently similar to that
about Camden Harbour. Several times between Cape Borda and
Roebuck Bay we sailed close in shore, where we could see similar
land.</p>
<p>Natives were plentiful; some of them came down to the beach. I
have not the slightest doubt in my own mind that the whole of
Dampier's Land containing two millions four hundred thousand
acres is a rich pastoral country; from what I have since seen in
the vicinity of Roebuck Bay, which is bounded on the north side
by Dampier's Land, tends to confirm me in this belief; part of
the land is high and well timbered.</p>
<p>On the 9th May, I landed at Roebuck Bay; the following morning
I started inland, accompanied by Dr. Martin, Mr. D. Shields,
mounted constable Buck, and native, Tommy (Dunedale). We started
from Cape Villaret, and travelled 52 miles due east in a straight
line; the whole of the country (which we travelled over) was well
grassed, the only drawback being the absence of running streams,
but I know for certain that plenty of water can be obtained by
seeking on any of the "Flats," at a depth varying from six to
twenty feet; most of the native wells which I came across were
about eight feet deep, the deepest I saw was sixteen feet; out of
this one we were unable to get water on account of the way in
which it was sunk. Close to it we put down a shaft and obtained
good water eighteen feet below the surface; these are my reasons
for speaking so confidently with respect to the supply of water.
On the 15th May I returned to the beginning of the "Racecourse
Plains," about 8 miles in an easterly direction from Cape
Villaret, and close to the beach. It would be difficult for me to
describe finer plains than these, containing at the lowest
estimate 40,000 acres of splendidly grassed land; these places
are bounded on the north and east by Roebuck Bay, and on the
south by a belt of cajeput trees; all along this belt there is an
abundant supply of water at a depth of from two to six feet from
the surface, and in some actually on the surface.</p>
<p>We had friendly intercourse here, as else where in the
vicinity of Roebuck Bay, with the natives. They appear a quiet,
harmless race; the sea-coast natives differ very much in their
appearance from the natives inland. The latter are a fair fine
race of men, and for natives appeared very cleanly. The sea-coast
natives live almost entirely upon the pearl oysters and other
shell fish; for beds they scrape a hole in the sand, and light
fires at their heads and feet; the domestic habits of these
sea-coast natives very much resemble those of that well-known
animal, the "Pig." Their weapons are of the most rude and
primitive description; the only ornaments they wear are large
pearl shells ground into an oval shape, and hung round their
necks by a string made out of their own hair. At all their camps
we saw quantities of small pearl shells, which led me to believe
that pearl oyster bed exists here as well as at Camden and
Roebuck Harbours. On the 17th of May I started for Lagrange Bay
with the same party, with the addition of Mr. A. Du Boulay, and
Mr. H. Logue. The above bay is scarcely worthy to be called a
bay, its extreme depth being barely six miles, and to all
appearances very shallow. The land appeared similar round the Bay
to the Racecourse Plains; the country for ten miles north of the
bay is not so well grassed as that previously travelled over.</p>
<p>At our last outward camp under Cape Latouche Treville we found
a natives' well about five feet deep, with plenty of water in
it.</p>
<p>At this place we caught two natives, (a man and a woman): we
brought them to the camp and after giving them some trifling
presents, let them go again.</p>
<p>All the country over which I have travelled is thickly wooded,
but the only timber fitted for building and fencing purposes,
&amp;c., is the cajeput tree.</p>
<p>This tree is proof against the white ant, and, in a mercantile
point of view, is valuable for the oil which can be extracted
from it. Stone is scarce, except at Cape Villaret, and along the
coast line from thence to Cape Latouche Treville.</p>
<p>The whole country as far as the eye could reach appears
level.</p>
<p>No river runs into Lagrange Bay as was generally supposed.</p>
<p>A small estuary extends inland from it for about two
miles.</p>
<p>From Lagrange Bay I reluctantly turned and retraced my steps
to Cape Villaret, where the vessel was lying at anchor. Although
the time for which the New Perseverance was chartered will not
expire for another month, still I considered that it would not be
prudent to allow a shorter time for the homeward passage than had
been occupied by the outward one to Brecknock harbour.</p>
<p>During my absence to the eastward, Mr. A. Du Boulay started in
the whale boat, (according to my instructions,) with four hands
to explore Roebuck Bay.</p>
<p>He reports the extreme depth to be 14 and miles, at low water,
mud and mangrove the only impediments to a person crossing it on
foot, five miles from its mouth. He also reports similar country
to the Racecourse Plains extending in N.E. direction, (into
Dampier's Land.)</p>
<p>The natives at the head of the Bay were quite friendly; from
them he obtained the names of several animals, water, &amp;c.,
which, together with the native words obtained by Dr. Martin and
myself, may be of use to future settlers.</p>
<p>Hitherto I have omitted to state that game, such as the
kangaroo, turkeys, &amp;c., are very numerous near the
sea-coast.</p>
<p>Large beans and red peas, (both most prolific bearers) grow in
abundance, both here and at Camden Harbour, and also on all the
Islands I visited.</p>
<p>With the exception of iron, I saw no mineral indications near
Roebuck Bay.</p>
<p>Including Dampier's Land, the total number of good pastoral
land discovered may be safely estimated at five millions five
hundred and ninety-two thousand acres. The land in the vicinity
of Brecknock Harbour exceeds anything I have ever seen before,
from my own experience. I can confidently state that the Land in
the vicinity of Roebuck Bay would bear favourable comparison with
some of the best runs in Victoria.</p>
<p>The discovery of the land has cost (in fractions) the one
fourteenth part of a farthing per acre.</p>
<p>In Dr. Martin's report much more valuable information will be
found; it is only due to that gentleman to state that he was
always ready and willing to give me any assistance in his
power.</p>
<p>The master and owner of the vessel, Mr. Wm. Ouston, together
with his ship's company were always ready to render me any
assistance I required. In conclusion I can only state that myself
and those above referred to have done our best to make the
expedition successful; whether it has been so or not I must leave
to those who are better able to judge than myself.</p>

<h3><span class="aa">From Doubtful Bay to the Lower Rapids of the
Glenelg River.</span></h3>
<p><i>June</i> 22, 1863.&mdash;Doubtful Bay is a magnificent
sheet of water, 9 miles in length from north to south, and six
miles in breadth from east to west. Although in the summer vast
quantities of water may from all sides pour into the bay, and the
tides gain additional force thereby, yet, as it is thoroughly
protected from every wind and from a heavy sea by a range of
islands and reefs to seaward, and the natural break-water of the
Montgomery Islands and the coral reef, 14 miles still further to
the westward, as the holding ground is of the very best, and as
there is abundance of room in which to work the largest ship,
Doubtful Bay, if ever this part of the Australian coast should be
colonised, will prove a harbour of refuge second to none. From
the great rise and fall of the tide also, 36 feet, this bay would
be a good site for works necessary to the repairing of ships. A
better terminus to the system of Australian telegraphs, when
connected with those of Europe and Asia, I think it will be
difficult to find. There does not seem to be any agricultural or
even pastoral land in the immediate vicinity of the bay, and the
hills both of the islands and the main are of the most
precipitous character. The south-east shore is fringed with an
immense mangrove swamp, intersected by numerous deep creeks. It
has all the appearance of being the mouth of a large river. About
the centre of this mangrove swamp, on its western limit, rises
the Conical Hill we had in line with the centre of "Foam Passage"
when we entered the bay last night. It is a remarkable hill
rising abruptly from among the mangroves, of a deep red colour,
and without any other hill or land visible from our anchorage,
nearer than two miles. I believe it to be of the old red
sandstone formation, as are the islands to the westward of the
bay. Wood and water are obtainable in Doubtful Bay. The old red
sandstone here exhibits a great variety of the most picturesque
scenery. Outside the bay, in the islands, it attains its grandest
development, wrapping round older rocks and effectually
protecting them from the action of the tides and current. The
rock is a conglomerate of fine hard gravel of a dark red colour.
The character of the old sandstone, and the way in which it is
broken and worn away to form picturesque cliffs, is also well
illustrated in the smaller islands to the south of the entrance
to Doubtful Bay. A bold headland is here nearly separated from
the principal island by the action of the waves, which have
already worn away deep cavities beneath, and threaten soon to
complete the destruction they have begun. The dark, frowning, and
gloomy masses of rock are piled over one another in an order not
irregular, and the huge step-like terraces, by which one may
descend nearly to the line of high water, afford admirable
instances of stratification, joints, and faults. The larger of
the rugged, isolated, projecting fragments in the island, taken
as a type of the whole group, is from 100 to 120 feet in height,
and about the same in breadth and thickness.</p>
<p>At 8.45 <small>A.M.</small>, a party consisting of three of
the explorers, with one servant, and the master of the vessel,
left in the long boat to climb the range eastward of the bay to
search for a navigable entrance to the Glenelg. Fires, in groups
of two, sprang up from the sea-beach, where the party landed, to
the summit of the first range;&mdash;they are doubtlessly native
signal fires. At noon the tide was running into the bay at the
rate of four knots per hour. A great many more fires are now
springing up in all directions. At 3 <small>P.M.</small> a signal
was made from the shore, upon which we got under weigh. About a
mile and a half from our anchorage we met the party in the long
boat. They report a rugged country without soil, but with trees
and coarse grass growing luxuriantly, the latter was nearly three
feet in height. Among the trees seen were&mdash;eucalypti,
acaciæ, adansoniæ, palms, and a tree whose leaf, as to venation
and other features, closely resembled the camellia. The walk was
so fatiguing that the ascent to the highest point of the range
was not accomplished. The natives seemed very numerous, judging
by their fires and cooeeing, but they kept out of sight at first;
indeed, a near view of one individual only was obtained. This
native carried a bundle of unusually long spears. Before the
party rejoined the boat, however, several were seen in the
distance, as if watching the behaviour of their unlooked for
visitors. From the set of the tide, which seemed to come from the
north-eastern of the two supposed mouths of the Glenelg, as laid
down upon Grey's chart, we determined to examine it more closely.
At 4 <small>P.M.</small>, although the tide was just commencing
to run out, the wind was sufficiently strong to carry us about 2½
miles up the supposed river, to a point on the western shore,
where a few detached rocks to the northward protected us from the
force of the tide. We anchored in 10 fathoms water at about 50
yards from a rocky precipitous shore, about 30 minutes after
sundown. At one mile from the entrance of this passage, on the
eastern shore, there was a broad water-course, with mangrove
swamps on either side, trending from east by south.</p>
<p><i>June</i> 23.&mdash;Before breakfast a party went on shore,
and in an hour returned with numerous specimens of the flora,
together with geological and other specimens. Of the geological
collection, by far the most interesting were the basaltic
fragments. At 9 <small>A.M.</small> the tide was ebbing rapidly.
After breakfast another boating party returned with many
specimens of coral and sponge alive, obtained from just below
low-water line; also a trochus and triton, both of which I
believe to be undescribed species; rock-oysters were found
adhering in large clumps to the rocks and to each other, but they
were of small size. At a quarter past 10 <small>A.M.</small>, we
fired a gun as a signal to the land party, who forthwith came on
board, just as the anchor was weighed at the commencement of
flood-tide. The passage here is little more than half a mile
wide. About two miles to the north of our anchorage a reef of
rocks came out into mid-stream. Through the passage, in soundings
of from 8 to 17 fathoms, the tide was now rushing with immense
velocity; at one time it took three men at the tiller to keep the
vessel under command. Sailing through this critical pass, not
more than a quarter of a mile in width, the stream opened to a
wide expanse of water about 6 miles in breadth, from east to
west, with an apparently clear extent to north of about 9 miles.
There seems to be an opening to seaward on the south-west
boundary. This splendid sheet of water we propose to name George
Water: there was barely a ripple upon its surface, and during the
afternoon we were sailing gently through with a scarcely
perceptible tide, at a rate varying from two to three knots, and
in soundings exceeding 15 fathoms. On our passage we observed
dolphins, seals (<i>Phoc&oelig;na vulgaris</i> and <i>Leptonyx
weddellii</i>), and many aquatic snakes (both <i>hydrophides</i>
and <i>hydri</i>). At 3.30 <small>P.M.</small> the water shoaled
rapidly to six fathoms; the vessel was put about immediately, and
we then anchored in east longitude 124° 39' 15", and south
latitude 15° 45' 40". Before us stretched a long line of
mangroves with several openings: one of the latter a little
westward of our course. As soon as possible after coming to
anchor, the boat party, as yesterday, left with provisions and
equipment, for 24 hours, to search for a navigable passage to
that portion of the river which had been seen by Grey; from which
point we cannot now be distant more than ten miles in a straight
line. The force of the tide, strange to say, is not much
diminished here; further observations may, perhaps, show the
reason why. At 8 <small>P.M.</small> the boat party returned;
they had found the passage N.N.W. of our anchorage to be
navigable, with a muddy bottom, and boundaries on either side of
mangrove banks. At a distance of about four miles from the
vessel, the water-course divided at the base of a round hill, up
which our explorers climbed a part of the way; but night coming
on, they returned to the vessel.</p>
<p><i>June</i> 24.&mdash;At 9.25 <small>A.M.</small>, the boat
party again left to search for an opening to the eastward of the
mangrove bank. The stream immediately before us has a mud bar,
dry at low water, but, from soundings taken last night, with more
than a sufficient depth of water on it at high water; inside the
bar the soundings exceed 15 fathoms. An ibis, resembling the
<i>ibis religiosa</i>, or white ibis, was seen on the mud bar,
but beyond the range of our guns. A curious marine creature of
the order <i>Errantia</i>, family <i>Eunicidæ</i>, was this day
captured alongside the vessel. It may be described as an
elongated and distinctly annulated worm, possessing a well
developed head, furnished with tentacles and eyes, and a mouth
with an armed proboscis. The branchial tufts were developed only
slightly. At 1 <small>P.M.</small>, the boat party returned
unsuccessful as to their search for a navigable opening; so,
half-an-hour afterwards, we weighed anchor and crossed the mud
bar in from 3 to 4 fathoms water; an hour and a half after this
the ebb-tide commenced, and we cast anchor in 6 fathoms water
about a mile south of the confluence of the two broad streams
immediately before us. Two parties then made preparation to start
directly to examine the two streams. One of them, with the master
of the vessel and one man, went in the long boat, and undertook
the exploring of the western stream; the other, taking the gig,
pulled up the eastern. I belonged to the long-boat party; we
thoroughly examined our water-course and its tributaries, but we
found that all the creeks terminated in tangled mangroves,
through which the boat could not pass. At the junction on the
return trip, we met the party in the gig, equally unsuccessful:
mangroves baffling all in their attempts to get through. The head
of the broad sheet of water we entered yesterday, so far as we
have examined it, consists of numerous islands, having in many
cases their surfaces some distance below high-water mark. The
creeks which intersect these low mud islands are deep&mdash;from
6 to 17 fathoms&mdash;with steep sides covered with a dense
growth of at least five species of mangrove. At the head of one
of these creeks the water was only brackish at high water; this
fact, coupled with the appearance of flocks of cockatoos and
pigeons, argues the presence of fresh water at no great distance
from our anchorage. A white crested eagle-hawk was this evening
shot, whilst perched upon our topsail yard. Another white crested
hawk, with wings of a rich chocolate brown, the extremities of
the feathers darkening to almost black, was shot, whilst perched
upon a mangrove; this I believe to be an undescribed species; I
have therefore spared time to preserve the skin and skull. The
aquila fucosa we have seen already several times.</p>
<p><i>June</i> 25.&mdash;At 4 <small>A.M.</small>, two boat
parties were dispatched. In the long boat, Mr. Cooper and Mr. A.
Brown, with one servant, went to examine a gulley in which we
thought we saw a cascade on the 23rd, with a view to discover
some convenient spot where we might obtain a sufficient supply
(1000 gallons) of fresh water to fill up our tanks; we have only
600 gallons on board now; the stock require a plentiful supply,
as the temperature ranges rather high. The shore party in the gig
consisted of two of our party, with a man to bring the boat back
after they had landed. The shore party were to walk to a high
hill, distant about 5 miles, and from its summit to examine the
country, and if possible discover water communication with that
portion of the Glenelg seen by Grey. The man, after landing the
party, was to return to the vessel and then explore the creeks in
search of fresh water. The gig returned at 8 <small>A.M.</small>,
after landing us on a mud-bank where there were tracks of
alligators, both large and small. One large creature,&mdash;its
motion was too rapid to catch more than a glimpse (although from
that glimpse I believe it was an alligator),&mdash;ran down the
mud-bank opposite to which we were anchored, and with a loud
splash plunged into deep water. This was about the time of
sunrise. I watched some time, hoping to see it again, but in this
hope I was disappointed. Parrots, cockatoos, pigeons, and
kingfishers, were all most richly coloured; they were very
numerous here. Small birds, too, not larger than humming-birds,
fluttered about in great numbers.</p>
<p>The morning was occupied in taking observations to determine
the exact position of the vessel. Found the longitude to be 124°
39' 12" E., and latitude 15° 43' 10" S. Found a scarlet-and-black
pea in the pod, with leaves but no flowers. Found a half-ripe
bean floating past the vessel. The long-boat party returned at 1
<small>P.M.</small> After sailing down the western shore of the
broad reach for a short distance they landed at promising spots
and looked for water; and although they did not find water, they
collected some highly interesting geological specimens. Finally
they landed at the conical red hill, four creeks to the south of
the cascade gully;&mdash;(this latter, by the way, is no cascade
at all&mdash;but merely a vein of greenstone, which, glistening
in the sun, gave us the effect of falling water when we were
about four miles off); but, to continue: the party had landed and
were advanced some distance in the muddy bank of the little
stream, when they overheard natives among the mangroves. In a few
minutes about 20 natives made a bold dash to cut off the party
from the boat. A very numerous body were also seen rapidly
approaching in an opposite direction, that is from the south. The
first body of natives then advanced steadily in line, each with a
spear shipped in a woomera (throwing-stick) and a bundle of
spears held in the left hand. At 15 paces from our party, who had
now covered each his man, the natives were prepared to throw
their spears, as was seen by their left hands being lowered from
the spear about to be thrown. One of them then stepped in
advance, and just as he was in the act of hurling his deadly
weapon, the first shot was fired. Although the native fell, the
rest still advanced steadily. A second then ran forward: he fell
at the firing of the second shot. This made them pause for a
moment and then retreat in all haste behind the mangroves. During
the retreat, a third charge of shot was fired at one poor fellow
in the act of running away; none of the shots proved immediately
fatal. A ludicrous incident in the affair happened to the man in
charge of the boat. He was in the water endeavouring to prevent
the boat grounding when he first saw the natives; he immediately
took up the gun left for his protection, and found it was not
loaded. He at once loaded it, and then discovered there were no
caps left in the boat. The affray commencing, he levelled his
uncapped piece and commenced a series of shouts and grimaces that
rivalled, if they did not excel, those made by the natives. From
these details two conclusions may, I think, be arrived at. First:
That a species of discipline prevails among the natives; this was
evident from the regularity of their advance and retreat, and
their conduct under fire. The use of firearms was apparently
unknown to them; the rifles, judging by their approach to within
a distance of 15 paces, they probably mistook for a kind of club.
Second: That the attack was premeditated, as will be seen from
the following particulars:&mdash;Their personal decoration must
have occupied them some considerable time; their foreheads and
temples were ornamented with the figure of a half-moon, painted
in white. Each man carried a bundle of very long spears. They had
most likely seen us sail by their encampment last Tuesday
afternoon; indeed, we passed so closely as to see plainly that
the place was a native encampment, by the number of small fires,
the smoke from which just curled up above the mangrove and other
trees. After the skirmish our party passed by some of their fires
recently extinguished by scattering about, probably with a view
to conceal their proximity just before the attack. Around their
fires were strewn fragments of greenstone (syenitic) with
conchoidal fractures, broken so as to adapt the cutting edges for
making and pointing their spears, chips and shavings of which lay
in all directions. Specimens were obtained of this greenstone and
also the limestone (a brecciated limestone) which is used, after
burning, as a paint. Several other geological contributions were
brought away from the vicinity; they nearly all belonged to the
primary group.</p>
<p>None of the native weapons were secured, as it was not deemed
expedient to follow them into the mangrove thicket; and the whole
affair from beginning to end occupied so short a space of time
that not one of the party noticed even whether the spears were
barbed or not. The half-moon figure seems to be their war
standard: even the night previous to the encounter we noticed the
shape of the fires on the side of the hill above their camp, to
have a half-moon-like outline. In person the natives were tall,
broad-shouldered, muscular, and exceedingly black. Their hair was
straight and tied at the back of the head. They had no covering
whatever. Our party remained on the spot for about half an hour
afterwards, collecting such botanical and other specimens as lay
in their way. Just before leaving in the boat, the native women
and children, who, from higher ground, had surveyed the attack,
commenced a wail which resembled that fabulous Dutch concert,
where every performer contributed to the harmony by playing his
own melody <i>fortissimo</i>, all commencing at a given signal.
One remark more may be worth recording, perhaps, as it may tend
to prove how little communication takes place between the various
native tribes. When the attacks were made on Grey and Stokes, the
natives invariably retired when a shot was fired, or, at latest,
when the first man fell. Here, however, it was only at the second
shot that some connection between the boat party as a cause, and
the falling of their men, as an effect, seemed to dawn upon them.
The report of the rifles did not produce the slightest hesitation
or sign of fear. The afternoon was occupied in attending to
botanical specimens, securing various packets of seeds, and so
forth. A very pretty gomphrena was among the botanical
collections of to-day.</p>
<p>At 4 <small>P.M.</small> the land party returned. From the
summit of the hill they had seen the River Glenelg, distant about
six miles to the eastward, and they recognised the large lagoons
with streams running into them, as laid down in Grey's chart.
They also saw the River Gairdner and the land away to the north
as far as Camden Harbour. But the 30 or 40 miles of low flat
country, as shown upon Grey's chart, seemed from the position of
our party to consist of well-grassed ranges of hills, with here
and there fertile flats. The hill from which these observations
were made was about 600 feet above mean sea-level; but viewed as
this part of the country was by Grey from a distance of 15 miles
or more, and at an elevation of 1000 or 1200 feet, it doubtless
presented an aspect exactly corresponding to that mentioned on
the chart. The party also sighted the Glenelg running towards
George Water, and also its upper course above the rapids, taking
a general southerly direction. They also observed a chain of
mangrove marshes running from some swamps, on the northern side
of the hill, towards and into Camden Harbour. From these
observations and bearings it is probable the water we are now in
has no navigable communication with the Glenelg nearer than
George Water. Only one opening remains to be examined and that
lies in the north-east corner of George Water, so named after the
discoverer of the inland Glenelg. The inpenetrable
mangrove-swamps forming the northern boundary we propose to name
"Barlee's Impediment", after the Honourable the Colonial
Secretary of Western Australia. More tracks of alligators seen in
the mud to-day.</p>
<p><i>June</i> 26.&mdash;At 9 <small>A.M.</small> a large
alligator, not less than 20 feet in length, came out from the
mangroves abreast of the vessel and slowly floated along with the
receding tide, just below the surface of the water. With the
binocular glasses we could clearly distinguish the head, eye,
ridges of the back and tail, and observe the slow paddling motion
of the feet. The master of the vessel, whilst out with the
long-boat in search of fresh water, saw a small alligator, about
3 feet in length, on a mud-bank; he fired with shot, but these
glanced from the creature's back as if it had been a coat of
iron. At 10 <small>A.M.</small> the boats again left to buoy the
stream to an anchorage nearer the spot where they expect to find
fresh water. At noon the boats returned; they found an abundant
supply of fresh water and cut a road through the mangroves to the
water's edge in the creek. The master buoyed the passage to
within a few yards of the road. At 5 <small>P.M.</small> set sail
to go up to the new anchorage. Anchored again in one fathom
water, at low tide, about a mile and a half from last anchorage,
up the north-west stream, past the confluence. The tide even here
rises 36 feet. There is plenty of fresh water in the bush: almost
every little gully yields a supply. It is perfectly fresh, but it
has a slightly bitter taste, only just perceptible. During the
night an exceedingly heavy dew falls here. Lying on the deck to
sleep, we are obliged to make an awning of the mainsail.</p>
<p><i>June</i> 27.&mdash;At daylight the gig, manned by two of
our party, and one of the men, left the vessel, with provisions
for two days, to explore the north-east corner of George Water.
Shortly afterwards all spare hands left in the long-boat with two
hogsheads to fill with fresh water. At 9 <small>A.M.</small> the
first trip was accomplished: they brought back 130 gallons of
water. The obtaining of it, however, was very hard work. They had
cut down mangroves from the spring to the landing-place, a
distance of nearly 200 yards, and with the felled trees they made
a corduroy road over the mud: along this road the water had to be
carried in buckets to the boat. The road was passable on foot for
a man carrying two buckets full of water, but not solid enough to
bear a hogshead when filled; otherwise the watering might
speedily have been concluded. I was left, with the steward only,
in charge of the vessel: in the event of an attack by
natives&mdash;here the creek is not 50 yards wide at low water
and only 6 feet deep&mdash;I consoled myself with the belief that
if the steward could only load fast enough we could manage to
hold the Foam for some hours. The tide was still nearly 36 feet
here. Only four hogsheads of water were obtained to-day: the
softness of the mud proved a greater hinderance than was
expected.</p>
<p><i>June</i> 28.&mdash;At 1 <small>A.M.</small> the gig party
returned. They have found a passage into Grey's part of the
Glenelg, through the little bay to the north-east of George
Water; the accurate examination of this bay was abandoned last
Wednesday as unpromising. The Glenelg falls into this bay, which
I intend to name Maitland Bay, by a very narrow mouth, situated
on the eastern side, as I have hitherto firmly believed by every
indication: the appearance of the ranges warranted this
conclusion; and the fact that the chart of our voyage, plotted up
to the present date, leaves a blank of scarcely two miles between
our survey and that of Grey, made the case stronger; the banks of
each part of the river in the two charts trending towards the
other in the most unmistakable manner, and, seemingly, inviting
us to persevere and accomplish their perfect union. This might
have been done three days ago, had a more thorough examination
been made; but Wednesday's search in the same direction proved
useless, solely from over anxiety on the part of the explorers
engaged. They did not deem themselves justified in spending an
hour more in that direction; because (1) the stock of fresh water
(our total consumption exceeds 50 gallons per diem) was getting
low; (2) there seemed but little hope of a navigable river
flowing into Maitland Bay; and (3) to the north of our anchorage
a sufficiently broad and deep stream lay immediately before us.
This, after very accurate and determined examination proving to
terminate by numerous branches in mangrove-creeks, not passable
by the gig, and in many places traced to the very base of the
hills&mdash;this brought about the resolution to undertake the
land exploration of Thursday, and the boat trip of yesterday,
which have resulted so perfectly to our satisfaction.</p>
<p>Before quitting this series of mud-islands and
mangrove-swamps, I could have wished to preserve an accurate
delineation; but inartistic skill suffices not to record
faithfully any of the varied effects. Photography alone could
portray the minutiae; I can only compare the effect to that of a
level country with clumps of varied and exquisitely green trees,
having openings&mdash;now straight&mdash;now
serpentine&mdash;ever graceful; with a ground of crystal
reflecting every leaf with an almost exaggerated accuracy.
Reference to the meteorological journal will shew an almost
entire absence of wind and cloud during the past week. The tides
are regular, and at springs rise 36 feet. High water in the
"Impediment", at full and change, would be, by calculation from
observed tides, at 9 <small>A.M.</small> But the highest tides
occur three days after the full and change.</p>
<p>At 6 <small>A.M.</small> got the anchor home and, towed by the
long-boat, proceed south to the mud-bar, <i>en route</i> to the
newly found passage to the known part of the Glenelg. The
south-west passage from George Water to the sea bears south-west
from the anchorage of Tuesday last Native fires still discernible
to the West of Cooper's Creek, but at some distance inland.
Anchored at noon just inside Rocky Island at the mouth of
Maitland Harbour, in the north-east corner of George Water. At
2.15 <small>P.M.</small> got the anchor aboard and attempted to
tow with the long-boat, but we could only just keep our position
owing to the force of the tide. At 4.20 <small>P.M.</small> a
slight breeze from the south-east gave us a slight advance. The
shores of Maitland Bay are of old red sandstone, covered with
long coarse grass. Adansoniæ and Eucalypti prevail. A shrub (in
fruit) with a strong lemon odour was obtained here, as also some
varieties of Melaleuca, a white Hibiscus and some other plants in
seed. The soundings in Maitland Bay averaged 15 fathoms.</p>
<p>The mouth of the Glenelg was entered with some little
difficulty: a reef bars the entrance, but there is a deep channel
near the southern end of the reef. The mouth of the river is
about a quarter of a mile in width for the first mile; and it
takes a general south-east course. There are several small rocky
islands, in this first mile, from 25 to 50 feet in height. The
banks also partake of the same precipitous character. A sudden
bend of the river opens into a reach, having a northerly course
of about four miles; and a width in some places exceeding a mile.
This reach, like the first mile of the river, is studded with
islands and reefs running parallel to the general course. We
anchored to the north of a rocky point on the left bank, about
two miles up the reach, in 5 fathoms water, at 7
<small>P.M.</small> A little to the westward. and northward of
the anchorage, on the right bank, there are mangrove and mud
islands; and, no doubt, there is a tidal communication between
this part of the Glenelg and Barlee's Impediment; at each change
of the tide the set was observed to be stronger in the direction
of the Islands than in the direct course of the river.</p>
<p><i>June</i> 29.&mdash;At the dawn of day, the tide serving, we
hove anchor and continued our upward course. The wind was very
light, so our progress was slow. After passing the northern
termination of the first reach, the rocky banks of the river give
place to mangrove and muddy shores; the belt appearing from the
centre of the stream to be exceedingly dense. The course of the
river also is now generally east by north. At about 1½ mile above
the point the tide turned, and there being no wind we were again
compelled to anchor. Soon after this, the long-boat with a party
of six, left to take soundings and to explore the river. At 4
<small>P.M.</small> the tide left the vessel aground on a
mud-bank, and in half an hour she canted over to an angle of 30°
and remained high and dry. Tracks of alligators from the river up
the mud are to be seen on the north bank; any one may easily
understand, after an examination of mud-banks such as this on
which we grounded, how fossil tracks were preserved until they
were sufficiently hardened; here, on all sides, notwithstanding
the rush of tidal waters, tracks we know to be at least two tides
old, remain as fresh and as perfect as if just made. This we
observe both in the case of birds and heavy reptiles.</p>
<p><i>June</i> 30.&mdash;About 1 <small>A.M.</small>, the
long-boat party returned, having gone up the river as far as the
first rapids. They landed on the country marked in Grey's chart
"rich alluvial soil"; they found it level and covered with
luxuriant grass, in some places 9 feet high: in other places not
exceeding 3 feet and apparently adapted to the keeping of sheep.
They found fresh water in abundance and a second series of rapids
in the river. They report the river itself to contain sufficient
depth of water between half tides to sail the <i>Flying Foam</i>
up to within a short distance of the first rapids. At 7
<small>A.M.</small> hove the anchor and commenced towing upwards.
At half-past 11 <small>A.M.</small> got the vessel entangled
among the mangroves to our great hinderance. A north-east wind,
blowing in fitful gusts, ultimately compelled us to anchor again,
having accomplished a distance of not more than two miles. The
tide at ¼ ebb runs two knots per hour. At 5.30
<small>P.M.</small> aground: the vessel assuming an angle of not
more than 20°. At 11 <small>P.M.</small>, in a perfect calm but
with a favourable tide, we again hove anchor, and for two hours
drifted along stern foremost, to a position about one mile to the
eastward of Alligator Point, Long Reach. The river here gradually
narrows. The tide flows with great velocity in the little bend of
our evening anchorage. Duration of flood-tide, 5 hours; of
ebb-tide, 7 hours. Rise 28 feet. The mud contains a large
proportion of sand at this part of the river. Mosquitoes are both
numerous and troublesome.</p>
<p><i>July</i> 1.&mdash;At 1 <small>A.M.</small> at anchor in
mid-stream in Long Reach in 3¼ fathoms. At daybreak we found the
vessel aground at an angle of about 35°, with a ridge of rocks
just rising above the mud, and stretching across the river from
north to south, about 200 yards in advance of us. Ducks flying
about, but not within range. At 11.40 <small>A.M.</small> hove
anchor. Along the banks of the river at low water we see clumps
of oysters, and a shoal of porpoises has passed and repassed
several times. At noon cast anchor near what appears a favourable
spot for landing stock in three fathoms at high water. The
long-boat with two land parties left to search along the right
bank for a temporary depôt and landing-place. At sunset the two
parties met at the boat, when she was found to be about 20 feet
above the water-level at the time. The mud seemed very slippery,
so a line was sent from the vessel, and, the travellers having
seated themselves, a slight impetus was given to the boat, when
she glided down the mud at a flying pace into the water without
the slightest mishap. Had the temperature been 120° lower, we
might have fancied ourselves witnessing the Russian ice-hill
sport. The parties report favourably of the spot selected for
landing the horses, and the men have cut a road through the
mangrove-belt down to the river-bank. In the afternoon, from the
mast-head, took bearings of many of the hills shown on Grey's
chart. Mount Lyell bears E. 28° N., and is distant about 7¼
miles. At low water we are surrounded by detached rocks: it was
fortunate the anchor happened to be cast in the midst of a soft
mud-bank. At low water the vessel draws 5 feet of <i>mud!</i> The
mosquitoes are a perfect torment here. It is not possible to keep
them wholly away: although we sleep in our clothes, cap and boots
included, with thick gloves and veils, the little pests, assisted
in their onslaughts by minute sandflies, are continually finding
their way within our lines. In fact, our only means of obtaining
a few hours' sleep during these long nights, consist in
fortifying our position with an outer defence of opossum-rugs,
with the fur inside; and even under these apparently favourable
circumstances the enemy (occasionally with success) puts into
force every conceivable stratagem with a view to surprise us. The
flood-tide commenced at 11.15 <small>P.M.</small>, and in twenty
minutes the vessel was afloat; after the first hour of flood, the
rush of tide diminished and kept steadily on for three hours
more, when the usual eight hours of ebb commenced.</p>
<p><i>July</i> 2.&mdash;Before breakfast, two of the party landed
on the south bank to see what game could be obtained; after an
hour's absence they returned laden with spoil. One of two fine
cranes shot by them measured from tip to tip of wings, 7 ft.;
height, standing, 5 ft. 6 in; from claw to lower end of femur, 1
ft. 3 in.; length of femur, 1 ft. 1½ in.; colour, rose or French
grey, with a rose blush. Besides these, there were ducks, geese,
and a teal. These birds were obtained from the swamps in the
summer bed of the Glenelg, left bank; 1 never saw so many
varieties of birds or in numbers so great, in any other part of
the world. For breakfast we had geese obtained in a raid last
night; they were of excellent flavour, but not fat: perhaps they
are scarcely in season at present. The ducks are exquisite
eating; they fly over from one side of the river to the other in
vast flocks. At 45 minutes after noon we commenced landing the
horses, and in an hour they were all safe ashore, in very fair
condition. Not one of them has suffered more from the voyage than
a week's rest and green food will remedy. The landing, although
conducted in rather an every-man-his-own-master style, was
certainly as smart and as successful a work as could be wished.
At 3 <small>P.M.</small>, five of the party started with the
seven horses to travel up the right bank of the river to the spot
selected for the temporary depôt, whilst the long-boat under the
guidance of the master of the vessel carried a load of provisions
and stores by water. The long boat returned at sunset having left
the depôt party with the horses safely encamped.</p>
<p><i>July</i> 3.&mdash;A watering party went to the rapids with
two hogsheads. They returned at 4 <small>P.M.</small>, having
been detained only by the tide. Preparing now for bush
exploration. We propose first to examine the country between this
and Camden Harbour. Amongst many highly interesting botanical
treasures secured this day, I find a very beautiful bunch of
flowers gathered from one of the numerous white acacias, which we
here find growing plentifully on the banks of every fresh-water
stream. It is generally associated with the palm. As the palm
alone here seems to be an unfailing indicator of fresh water, so
this acacia would appear to be a finger-post to point out streams
plentifully supplied and constant. The tree here attains a height
varying from 15 to 30 feet; but at a mile or two of distance from
the mangrove-belt which fringes every salt-water stream, it
attains, in some instances, a height exceeding 100 feet. In every
detail it answers to the description of Mr. F.
Gregory&mdash;"very handsome tree, resembling an ash. . . . .
bearing a beautiful white flower, 4 to 5 inches across, having on
the inside a delicate tinge of yellow, and yielding a sweet scent
like violets." * Some bunches of this exquisitely beautiful
flower measured 3 + 2 + 2 feet. Where several of these trees
happened to be in flower, in close proximity, the violet-like
odour was perceptible at a great distance. Our old friend the
very beautiful pea,&mdash;of a bright scarlet colour, with a
jet-black spot on one end, is still met with in every ramble
ashore. These peas appear from the seed-pods to be precisely
similar to those of <i>Abrus precatorius</i> which come from the
East and West Indies, where they are used as beads. The leaves
and root of this plant taste like liquorice. In the West Indies
the <i>Abrus precatorius</i> is called wild liquorice. The roots
abound in sugar, and from experiments made since the return of
the expedition, I believe them a perfect substitute for liquorice
in every respect. These beautiful seeds are strung for necklaces
and other ornaments by the people of both Indies. Their specific
name (<i>precatorius</i>) was given from the fact of their being
occasionally made into Rosaries. De Candolle, speaking of the
<i>Abrus</i>, says, "these plants attain a height of about 9 ft.
The seed is a wholesome pulse." Hughes, in his 'Natural History
of Barbadoes,' treating of <i>Cajanus flavus</i>, a pea most
closely allied to A. <i>precatorius</i>, says:&mdash;"I know of
no part of this shrub but what is of some use. The wood is good
for fuel, and by the often falling of its numerous leaves the
land it grows upon is very much enriched; and its fruit is of
great service by affording hearty, nourishing food to man and
beast. The peas, green or dry, are boiled and eaten, and esteemed
very wholesome, especially if eaten in the wet time of the year;
for, being of a binding quality, they prevent diarrhoeas and
dysenteries, so common in wet seasons. The branches, with the
ripe seeds and leaves, are given to feed hogs, horses, and other
cattle, which grow very fat upon them." Nearly every word of what
is here said of C. <i>flavus</i> applies to the pea now found
growing abundantly in the Glenelg district. Here, too, the
aborigines have discovered the valuable properties of this useful
legume: for on the 31st July, on an island in Collier Bay, many
pods of this pea were found among the remains of a native feast,
although no plants were observed growing upon the island.</p>
<p class="foot">[* 'Journal of the North-Western Australia
Exploring Expedition,' F. Gregory, p. 18.]</p>
<p><i>July</i> 4.&mdash;Went to the depôt in the gig: it is just
below the first rapids, on the north or right bank of the
Glenelg, and within the limit of the summer bed: not a very nice
spot. The grass is plentiful, but rank: so much so that the
horses feed away to sweeter grass growing within a very short
distance to the north and east. Mount Lyell is just visible among
the trees, distant about 4½ miles north-east. Camden Harbour
would seem to bear W. 33° N. from us, and to be distant about 18
miles in a right line; but so many ranges of high hills
intervene, that we have no expectation of seeing the sea-coast in
that direction, until we are within a distance of a few miles. In
some fresh-water pools around the encampment, a lily of great
beauty grows abundantly.</p>
<p><i>July</i> 5.&mdash;At 8 <small>A.M.</small> walked to a hill
about a mile and a half W. 11¼ N., to seek ground for the
measurement of a base line, but no suitable locality was found.
The hill proved very rugged; in some places the stones had
sharply cutting edges, in others they were rounded and
loose,&mdash;piled in heaps; in all cases, owing to the luxuriant
clothing of grass, they were seldom seen before they were felt.
There is no great variety of grasses on our route of this
morning, but all are thickly growing, and in height run from 3 to
7 feet Nearly all the hills appear grassed to their summits. This
hill, which by Grey's chart is in a line with our depôt and Mount
Yule, afforded no extent of view to the north; a higher range,
about two miles distant cut off our view in that direction; but
to the east our range of view extended to Mount Lyell and its
neighbouring hills. The horses are eating better to-day; it was,
of course, no more than might be expected that horses after being
on board ship for a month, and being in the mean time transferred
to a new country, should, when landed, eat sparingly at first of
their new food. Even the sheep to-day looked round bewildered,
and showed but little disposition to eat. They cannot understand
at first that grass four feet high, somewhat coarse and dry, as
it is near the depôt, from the advanced period of the season, is
their destined food for the future. But in a few days all kinds
of stock will feed amply here. The little tree with melon-like
seed-pod and lemon odour is now in flower all about these hills.
Its yellow flowers and leafless stem look very curious as they
peer above the high grass. I saw no specimen exceeding 9 ft. in
height. Walking among the acacias after sunset reminds one
acutely of the little violets in the old country. In the
afternoon sought for beetles, but after a diligent search,
extending over nearly four hours, I was only rewarded with two or
three small specimens. A few Geocores and Mantidæ were seen, but
not captured. Whilst hunting for insects, I came across a dead
tree with the bark off, for a space of 3 ft. 6 in. all round. I
tested the wood with an axe&mdash;it was exceedingly hard, and
made the axe rebound. The barking I do not think to be the work
of aborigines, as it is so regularly done, and apparently with a
keener edge than the stone axe of the Australian native. As our
camp is situated close to the Rapids, as the tree is much older
than any of the trees in the immediate vicinity, and would
therefore be selected for marking by any white man, and, as
Grey's route on my copy of his chart runs close to this spot, I
am convinced that the tree is one marked by Grey's party.</p>

<h3><span class="aa">Land Exploration to Camden
Harbour.</span></h3>
<p><i>July</i> 6.&mdash;At 7 <small>A.M.</small>, barometer
30.105; thermometer 55.8; wind 0, cloud 0. Yesterday I found a
plant that had the smell and taste of mint, and another that
smelt strongly of musk. At 9.30 left camp with two of our party,
three saddle and two pack-horses, with a fortnight's provision,
having for our object to reach Camden Harbour, and examine the
country between the Glenelg and the sea along the north-west and
north boundaries of the district. Hanover Bay and the Prince
Regent's River we do not at present intend to explore. I should
describe the country between our starting-point and our noon camp
as well fitted for sheep, especially after the present growth of
grass has been burned&mdash;as for feeding it down, it would be
impossible. The riding over it now is very rough work, because we
keep as nearly as possible to our proposed course N. 57° W., over
hill and valley; but if the object was to find an easy road, I
can see no difficulty whatever. Pitched our camp at 5
<small>P.M.</small> on the western branch of the Gairdner River.
The afternoon's march has been much easier than that of the
morning, and we have passed over a greater distance (6 miles)
with less fatigue to our horses. From the summit of a range 600
to 700 ft. high, a beautiful prospect was obtained. The whole of
this day's track lies through a splendidly grassed country; few
birds have been seen, but kangaroo and turkeys have been noticed
beyond range. My two companions ascended a hill to the west, and
from the top they could see the line of swamps extending towards
Camden Harbour. During the night a heavy dew fell, and some
birds, uttering a cry I could not recognise, flew over our
camp.</p>
<p><i>July</i> 7.&mdash;Started at 7 <small>A.M.</small>; country
good at first and easy to travel over; rode two miles to the foot
of a double-cone hill, 500 feet high, then turning westward 3¼
miles round the base of two hills, one of them 700 feet in
height, and 2½ miles north of fine country to another hill 800
feet high, from which we had a magnificent view of sea and
islands in Brecknock and Camden Harbours, with arms of the sea
both north and south. From the hill to our camp, one mile, the
country was exceedingly rugged, with steep hills coming almost to
an edge up and down. In a rocky gully of coarse red sandstone I
obtained a large collection of shells. The grass was rather
coarse and rank, like coarse wheat-straw; the country more
rugged, but still easy and well grassed; noticed some poor
sandal-wood, also acacia, baobab, and palms, and a rose-like
vine. Good water, probably permanent, is found wherever palms are
seen. Camped near the southern arm of the sea, which terminates
in mangrove-swamps running towards a remarkable conical hill
nearly due south.</p>
<p><i>July</i> 8.&mdash;Travelled over a country with perfectly
easy succession of undulations, then crossing the heads of
several tidal creeks with mangroves, one of which we attempted to
cross but failed, found a particularly easy country with gravelly
soil stretching quite across the neck of the peninsula towards.
Camden Harbour. It was singular that our route of yesterday
should have been so remarkably rough; we chose it because it
appeared the better of the two, but our march of to-day, although
only a short distance from it, may be considered quite easy and
well grassed. At 1 <small>P.M.</small>, ascended a hill and took
bearings; pack-horses and all went up here; we had a magnificent
view of Brecknock Harbour; the green islands studding it and its
silvery unruffled surface, from the position in which we stood
could only be compared to emeralds in a broad setting of silver.
The view was so enchanting that I unwillingly ceased gazing at it
to resume the dry work of taking observations. Camden Harbour is
somewhat disappointing, it seems, as we look down upon it, so
small after those magnificent sheets of water Collier Bay,
Doubtful Harbour, George Water, and others. From Camp 4 we passed
to a hill about one mile south-east of Camden Harbour, 600 feet
high, and then on our return route to Camp 6, half a mile
south-east, where we noticed a remarkable geological
formation&mdash;quartz veins through sandstone. At 4
<small>P.M.</small>, resumed march 2½ miles west to the southern
heads of Brecknock Harbour, and after passing very tolerable
country formed Camp 7 in a well grassed and watered locality.
During the night some heavy four-footed animal trotted past at no
great distance from our camp, to the great terror of Peter, the
pony. I am curious to know what creature it could be; it was
evidently a heavy beast, and its motion I noticed very carefully,
and can only compare it to a distinct trot. Butterflies abundant
and beautifully coloured, but I do not catch as I cannot preserve
them.</p>
<p><i>July</i> 9.&mdash;At 8 <small>A.M.</small>, <i>en route</i>
passing over a particularly easy country, chiefly with a gravelly
soil of quartz, ironstone, old red sandstone, and trap. Here and
there this easy country was cut by belts of strong country with
coarse grass, but still not so rough in any place that a bullock
or horse team could not travel all the way. Passing south of the
double-coned hill, we made a course east by south, cutting all
the little streams that drain the MacDonald Range, under which we
camped at noon on the most eastern bend of the Gairdner. Under
the range there was fine grass and large timber; the river has
permanent water; in some of the pools was a carpet of lilies in
flower; palms abundant, water excellent, and characeæ and other
water-plants numerous. At 3.30 <small>P.M.</small> resumed the
march 4¾ miles to the first of the streams rising in the
MacDonald Range and flowing into the Glenelg, over magnificently
grassed downs, gently undulating, but elevated 240 feet above
mean sea-level, which I proposed calling "Hampton Downs"; they
divide the streams falling into the Gairdner and Glenelg.
Exquisite palms all around our camp.</p>
<p><i>July</i> 10.&mdash;To the Depôt camp. All the country we
passed over is beautifully grassed, but as we approached the
depôt the grass became coarser; the soil is a rich alluvium
nearly the whole distance. We found all well in camp. The parties
looking for land seem disinclined at present to leave a depôt
party here, but this is a magnificently grassed and well-watered
country, with a practicable natural dray-route all the distance
from Camden Harbour to this depôt. The whole of our route during
the past week is fringed by timber of sufficient size and in
sufficient quantities for all building and pastoral purposes for
many years to come; we have already seen 300,000 acres of land of
the finest quality for grazing, and at present, although it is
now drawing near to the close of the dry season, clothed with
grass of the most luxuriant growth. During our march of this
morning there were places where, as we rode along, we could not
see each other for the grass; in fact the grass-seed was at least
three feet above our heads. It is the opinion of us all that the
lowest estimate of the carrying power of this district is a sheep
to an acre, therefore 300,000 sheep might be fed upon it; but in
this estimate of land we do not include the sandstone ranges we
have seen, which, although so precipitous as to be impassable
save on foot, are still well grassed and available to the
depasturing of sheep, and in process of time, as the more easily
traversed land becomes stocked, would naturally be included in
the runs. But to what extent the ranges would increase the
pastoral lands of the district north and north-west of the
Glenelg, it is impossible now to conjecture; it is very easy,
however, to foresee that in a short period after the settling of
the country, ramblers in search of game, or shepherds would
discover easy passes through them, and feeding valleys to their
summits. Another matter worthy of notice&mdash;we have not yet
seen one of the many poisonous plants, the bane of the south of
this colony, and to eyes so well accustomed as ours to the
various kinds, they would if here, before this, doubtless have
become apparent.</p>
<p><i>July</i> 11.&mdash;On board the vessel; found all the
collections of specimens I had left behind excessively damp, and
the botanical ones I fear spoilt. During the last night the
mosquitoes prevented all chance of sleep, in spite of smoke or
any attempts at covering ourselves up. In the morning a shooting
party left for the lagoons on the south side of the Glenelg,
returning at noon with a goodly supply of game. One of the
silver-grey cranes measured 7 feet 6 inches from tip to tip of
wing, and 5 feet 10 inches from toe to beak.</p>
<p><i>July</i> 12.&mdash;A day of rest.</p>
<p><i>July</i> 13.&mdash;Went to the depôt, as it is proposed to
start this day on the south and west exploration; on our way up
in the long-boat saw eleven alligators on the mud banks, some we
estimated at 6 feet, others at 25 feet in length. Left the depôt
at 2.30. <small>P.M.</small> with two saddle and one pack horse,
carrying a fortnight's provisions. By a direct course steered for
Mount Lyell, distant 4¼ miles from depôt, and visible all the
way; reached it an hour before sunset, camped and then ascended
to the summit. It has changed its appearance very much since
Lieutenant Grey described it, and is now clothed with grass and
trees; from a clump of huge stones on the apex we had a
magnificent view of the surrounding country, extending over the
Prince Regent River on one side and the Glenelg district on the
other.</p>
<p><i>July</i> 14.&mdash;Left our camp at the foot of Mount Lyell
and steered a course generally S. 20° E. until noon, 4½ miles.
The first mile was over very rough but well-grassed country, with
the largest timber we have yet seen, and water everywhere; the
last camp was our first experience of water without palms, there
replaced by three species of acacia. The second mile was over an
excellent grassed and well watered country, the third and fourth
the same, but larger timber; the last half mile was over sandy
and rocky country very difficult to travel over, having deep
creeks and water-holes equally difficult to cross. When we struck
the Glenelg it was at a fine deep reach, one-eighth of a mile
broad, with little current in it, and its sides were fringed with
lofty eucalyptus and cajeput trees, with fine grass down to the
water's edge. Many new flowering trees were passed to-day, and
kangaroo seen several times. Palms everywhere around us. In the
afternoon, after two hours' particularly difficult travelling
both for selves and horses, we only made one mile, and camped in
a gully running into the Glenelg; we ascended the hill, out of
which the gully runs; it was nearly all stones piled loosely, and
spinifex here and there, but with a fair proportion of feed. I
was astonished to find a very fine acacia growing among the pile
of stones on the top of the hill, sufficiently large to enable us
both to climb it, and, sitting among the branches, to take
bearings. Here are rapids in the Glenelg, which in the rainy
season must afford a magnificent landscape, as the fall in the
rocky bed is not less than 50 feet Fish in the river and the
water extremely good.</p>
<p><i>July</i> 15.&mdash;<i>En route</i>, steering a general
course of S. 20° E. After travelling an eighth of a mile we
entered what we may well call "the Happy Valley;" this was a
valley running to the southward, of no great breadth (say an
eighth of a mile in the widest), clothed with a very carpet of
green grasses. The first pines we had seen here fringed our track
and formed, with the old red sandstone walls bounding the valley
on either side, picturesque clumps of eights and tens
intermingled with palms, acacia, eucalypti, and melaleuca, of
great variety and beauty. A deliciously cool and clear stream of
water flowed everywhere copiously along the valley; we disturbed
birds of varied hue, but mostly of brilliant colours; one kind of
parrot struck me as peculiarly beautiful, the head and tail of
bright green, the wings of a silvery grey hue; pigeons were
numerous, but small; at the upper end of the valley two stately
emus, at different intervals, gave us first an inquiring and
suspicious examination, and then in turn afforded us an
opportunity of observing their powers of retreating. The "Happy
Valley" terminated in a happier circular plain of about half a
mile diameter, covered with the most luxuriant grass, not less
than three feet in height and perfectly level; this plain was
bounded by timber of different kinds and a wall, broken here and
there, of old red sandstone behind the trees; the first Banksias
we met with grew here. From the plain we ran up a creek bounded
by rocky walls to its source in the dividing range, the route
being over a chocolate-coloured sandy detritus; the neighbourhood
had been lately burnt, was easy to travel over, well watered and
grassed, and had an abundance of fine timber. Our afternoon
course was over exceedingly difficult country for three quarters
of a mile, then, branching westward, to a gully running parallel
to that of the morning, we continued our course over a similar
country until we arrived at a large flat, where we camped for the
night. Just before making camp we saw extraordinary proofs of the
recent presence of some very large, and, I should say from the
tracks, five-toed herbivorous animal; during the day we saw a
large stone-coloured snake, black cockatoos, and numerous
kangaroos.</p>
<p><i>July</i> 16.&mdash;My companion went to the top of the
range bounding the eastern side of the swamp, and on his return
reported that the country S. 30 ° W. promised easier travelling,
and we therefore started on that course. After crossing the
Glenelg and a most important tributary, at a spot which we
denominated "Rocky Springs", we camped. An entomological research
produced me only 30 coleoptera, of three or four species; a
beautiful white moth with red markings rewarded me. Native fires
sprung up in all directions towards sunset; it is evident the
aborigines are close to us.</p>
<p><i>July</i> 17.&mdash;Ascended a hill 1300 feet high. There
are between this range and the Prince Regent River three distinct
high ranges; one about 12 miles S. 20° E. appeared clothed with
grass of the colour of that on Mount Sturt, and apparently as
coarse. All the country within this radius of 12 miles I should
describe as second-rate compared with the country north-west of
the Glenelg, but still it was well grassed on the strong ridges,
and magnificently grassed on the flats; it is equally well
watered, and possesses finer timber. The hill is singularly
uninteresting in a scientific point of view, no specimen of any
kind having been collected upon it except the cast skin of a
small lizard; no flowers, no insects, except ants and flies; the
latter are a daily pest except when travelling; a few butterflies
alone gave colour to the eye; clumps of spinifex appear towards
the apex.</p>
<p><i>July</i> 18.&mdash;Returned to the last camp, taking a more
southerly route. Thence N. 30° 10' W. to the Rocky Springs,
passing through some rich alluvial flats, having on our left a
stony range well grassed and timbered. We have several climatic
nuisances&mdash;flies by day, mosquitoes by night, and ticks
manifold both by day and night; beyond these trifling
discomforts, the climate, since we passed the north-west Cape,
may be described as heavenly; only just warm enough in the middle
of the day to make shade preferable to sunshine, and the nights
delightfully cool but not cold.</p>
<p><i>July</i> 19.&mdash;Whilst gathering palm-leaves to make a
fire, I noticed a very beautiful wasp's nest pedicillated
delicately to the under side of the green leaves; I was almost
too late, however, when I returned, to effect the capture of one
or two specimens; they seemed quite indignant at the intrusion,
and threatened dire vengeance if molested. The capture of one or
two of the ringleaders soon caused the rest to retreat, leaving
their city with its inhabitants, in every stage of waspdom from
the egg to the larvæ, an easy prey to my spirit bottle. Started,
and by picking our way carefully up and down the gullies crossed
the Glenelg, by cutting down the palm jungle, after an hour's
hard work, camped 1½ mile further on, having only accomplished 4¾
miles direct, at 1.30 <small>P.M.</small>, owing to one of the
horses having been severely cut the previous day. All the ground
passed over during the last three days has been recently burned
by the natives. The bed of the river here is drift sand,
indicating a river-bed in the summer of 300 to 400 yards in
width, fringed by lofty cajeput, eucalypti, acacia, and
occasionally dense palm-jungle. I noticed one fine white
gum-tree. After dinner I went upon an entomological tour about a
mile down the rivulet towards the Glenelg, but with partial
success only as to beetles, there being so few flowering trees
and shrubs in blossom at this season. In places here the white
ants are very numerous, and their hills are frequently from 5 to
6 feet in height with a diameter almost equal to the height.</p>
<p><i>July</i> 20.&mdash;The period of sunrise here is a daily
feast: a cloudless sky, not a zephyr stirring with sufficient
force to move the smallest leaflet, and a temperature perfectly
enjoyable, even clad, as we were, in our travelling garments,
which are simply our usual under-clothing, boots, trousers, and
outer Crimean shirt, a silk neckerchief, which serves as a cap at
night, a light cloth cap, with calico cover cut after the Indian
mode, with a well-projecting peak to protect the eyes from the
noon-day glare, and a veil about 10 inches square rolled round
the cap, except when flies and mosquitoes are troublesome; these,
with stout leather gloves only worn on state occasions, such as
breaking a road through prickly bush-rose vine, acacias, or
palms, complete our toilet of every day and Sunday. Started at
9.15 <small>A.M.</small>, and after crossing two broad reaches of
water at 1 <small>A.M.</small> crossed our southern track and
thence pursued our route down the Happy Valley, whence we passed
over 2 miles of stony ridges and 2½ miles of easy well-grassed
country, and camped on the Glenelg.</p>
<p><i>July</i> 21.&mdash;Travelled over easy-grassed country as
far as Mount Sturt, where we were long delayed hi crossing the
Glenelg, and by a reedy swamp running into the broad stream near
Mount Sturt; reached the depôt about noon. Went to the vessel to
pack away specimens and returned with instruments for measuring a
base line, and took lunar distances in the evening to determine
the exact position of the depôt. Since our departure all hands at
the depôt have been occupied in cutting grass for hay, any
quantity of. which is at present to be had for the cutting, and
it is of good quality and in such profusion all around us that
ships might obtain cargoes of it as quickly as it would be cut,
made, and pressed into bales. One of the first objects that met
our eye was a tolerably neat press, erected in the midst of the
camp, after the manner of a primitive wool-press; close beside
the press lay six wool-bales of well-pressed hay, and about a ton
of loose. During our absence a good addition has been made to my
geological collection, which now includes what I take to be a
fair number of specimens of the chief geological treasures
brought from the hills by the summer floods of past centuries;
many are of a highly interesting nature, either from their
exhibiting the general geological features of the district, or
from some peculiarity of conformation of strata or crystalline
arrangement.</p>
<p><i>July</i> 22.&mdash;The party propose to send some of the
hay on board to-day, from this I presume it to be their intention
to reship some if not all of the horses, which I cannot think a
wise proceeding, for these reasons: first, because a district of
unsurpassed fertility has been found and traversed, possessing
abundance of feed and water for half a million of sheep, together
with timber in far larger quantities than will ever be required
for building and fencing purposes; a district blessed with a
climate which, at this season of the year, is a joy to live in,
with evidences of continual and periodical summer rains of
sufficient amount to warrant us in the supposition that this is
no exceptional year of fertility, but that an annual supply of
grass of a like quality and in no less quantity might reasonably
be predicated; a district having a fine and securely land-locked
harbour in Brecknock Bay, with a country of almost unequalled
fertility immediately adjoining, and fit without road-making to
drive a bullock or horse team over it at once so far as even to
the very centre of the district: a district having a river
leading from the southern harbour, in Doubtful Bay, to the very
heart of the grazing country&mdash;a river I should describe as
safe and easy to navigate with cargo-boat, or a small steamer,
from George Water to the rapids, and south of the actual
river-entrance in the north-east corner of George Water,
perfectly secure for vessels of any class or size, especially if
the south-west opening of George Water into the sea should prove,
on our return trip, to be wider and less tortuous than the
entrance through which we sailed from Doubtful Bay. Here I must
admit that although the <i>Flying Foam</i> came safely through
the passage, and the actual river entrance from George Water,
still the work was hazardous (doubly so then from the fact of
ours being the first soundings taken there), but even now, viewed
from the most favourable point, a work fraught with visible
dangers to any vessels larger than cargo-boats of 10 to 15 tons.
At 10.30 started with Mr. Aubry Brown to measure a base line
south of Mount Yule. During the whole day it was exceedingly
sultry; being on a low mud-flat only just above low-water mark,
without wind or cloud, we certainly felt the heat more than on
any day since we landed in the Glenelg district. After finishing
our chain line and solar observations, we discovered a
convolvulus with the leaves and vine dry and dead, twined round a
mangrove; the seed was quite ripe; the signal for our recall
sounded from the ship, the tide was then high enough for us to
get on board without difficulty. Our usual mode of going on board
from the mud-banks has been by a process, compared with which a
mud-lark's trade on the Thames is clean work, much more
pleasantly described than performed, but this is a favourable
description of the process: after a toilsome walk along the
northern margin of the mangroves we reach a spot where, at low
tide, we are just able to wade through the mud and spots of water
left by the previous tide, and then by a decidedly muddy and
circuitous route reach a road cleared through the mangroves to
the edge of the mud-bank proper, when, although we have a
road-way paved with mangrove-logs, we sink up to our knees on a
bluish grey mud of the consistency of dough, and in some places a
man would sink over head in it if unacquainted with the
geography, and then by a series of ungraceful evolutions glide
alongside or into the boat to be put on board the vessel, objects
to be carefully shunned and commiserated; we wash and change our
garments and sit down perfect <i>bonnes bouches</i> for the
mosquitoes. In early evening, that is by the liberal use of
smouldering rags, we obtained a respite from the mosquito
nuisance, but from that hour throughout the night an unceasing
hum was kept up by clouds of these pests hovering about our
heads, but wholly defeated in my case by the manner in which I
was packed up in my rug on deck; as to sleeping below, of course
no one has been so venturesome as to attempt it during the past
month.</p>
<p><i>July</i> 23.&mdash;This morning I found an entomological
treasure in the shape of a tick upon my left arm: it was in the
same condition as we usually find them&mdash;the head buried in
the skin immediately over a vein, and its body swollen with its
stolen food; it was larger than those we found on the Upper
Glenelg. I tried the experiment of making it disengage itself by
putting the lighted end of a match to its body; but it required a
second application before it would show any signs of
relinquishing its hold. This individual seemed unfitted for the
experiment of drowning by oil from the hardness of its epidermis;
but other species, as soon as a drop of oil is placed on them,
disengage themselves quickly, owing, I presume, to the closure of
the spiracles by the oil and the consequent stoppage of their
powers of breathing. As they are frequently met with in many
parts of Australia, and as I am not aware of the existence of any
recorded observations on their anatomy or habits, I think it will
not be time thrown away to take measures to obtain as many
species as possible and make some enquiries into their history,
the more especially as I know no greater plagues to travellers in
these parts of the world. It is not so much the immediate as the
remote consequences that are to be dreaded, for if incautiously
the creature be detached summarily on its discovery, or rubbed
off by the hand, its presence being undetected, its head may
remain in the skin and then there is formed a hard callous lump,
which I have known to become a source of pain and anxiety for two
years after the first formation. Towards sunset two of the horses
and a party arrived from the depôt, and were got on board
preparatory to leaving the river. I am lost in amazement at this
resolve; for granting the cost of leaving a depôt here, I ask
myself, can they expect to find 500,000 acres of land, in any
part of the world, capable of carrying perfectly half a million
of sheep, at a cheaper rate? However our exploration will open to
some future occupants this tract of superb grazing country,
certainly inferior to none in the world that I have seen, and I
have travelled much. In the evening the whole party returned to
the depôt.</p>
<p><i>July</i> 24.&mdash;This morning an alligator was caught by
one of the sailors: it was 6 feet in length, head 1 foot 4
inches, first pair of feet 2 feet 5 inches, second 2 feet 9
inches, circumference 2 feet, and weighed 80 lbs. I skinned and
dissected the creature, preserving the cervical vertebræ, lungs,
skull, and skin. In the afternoon the remainder of the horses
arrived from the depôt and were got on board.</p>

<h3><span class="aa">From the Glenelg River to Collier
Bay</span>.</h3>
<p><i>July</i> 25.&mdash;In the early morning the long-boat went
to the depôt for the sheep, and returned at 8 <small>A.M.</small>
when they were forthwith put in their pens. During the day I was
employed in cleaning, preserving, and stuffing the bones and skin
of the alligator, a tedious operation, as some of the smaller
bones are so exceedingly thin that the slightest cut would have
easily passed through them. At dusk we left our anchorage and
towed down the river to long. E. 124° 43' 52", S. lat. 15° 43'
8", and stuck fast in the mud at 9.45 <small>P.M.</small> We did
not perceive this bank on our upward passage, or we might easily
have avoided it and continued to use the tide for another hour.
On reference to our chart of the river we perceive our track runs
along the northern edge of the bank: as shown by the soundings
this bank can scarcely be called a hidden danger, for it consists
of a deposit of mud about a foot in depth lying on a smooth bank
of sand, thus affording a safe berth to any vessel during the
receding tide; but of course if the vessel were not somewhat
flat-bottomed she would have a considerable list For two hours
before low tide we were left high and dry with the river running
placidly on either side of us. This change of anchorage of last
night was a boon appreciated by every individual on
board&mdash;we were actually enabled to sleep with our faces
uncovered. Just before leaving our anchorage a desperate attempt
was made to capture a large alligator floating in the river like
a log: one shot from a rifle was fired and the ball undoubtedly
struck the creature somewhere, for by its rapid lashing of the
water we can only suppose that it was in a flurry, at the very
least; but, alas! when the vessel's gig and a numerous party
reached the spot, no reward awaited them save the view of the
still troubled water. One can imagine the creature, when aroused
from its reverie by the leaden messenger, to give a look of
intelligence around it, and on catching a glimpse at the
advancing boat, to resolve, all things being well considered, to
explore the bottom of the stream and recline its aching head on
its customary mud-pillow, at any rate for a season.</p>
<p><i>July</i> 26.&mdash;At 8 <small>A.M.</small> left our
anchorage, and by dint of sail and towing proceeded down the
river at a tolerable speed. At 11 <small>A.M.</small> ran aground
on a mud and sand bank half a mile south-west of our anchorage of
June 6: the vessel was so far fortunate enough in her choice of a
berth, as to have avoided a mass of sandstone rocks and boulders,
which at low water we found immediately east of us, and against
which, if she had struck, an unlucky thumping would have brought
us to a stoppage less easily than the mud did; moreover the rocky
heap was a foot higher than the mud-bank, and the vessel could
not have assumed so upright a posture during the interval before
the flood-tide of the afternoon. The shoal patch I purpose naming
"Sunday Shoal". At low water many of the party and some of the
crew got over the side of the vessel to seek shells, &amp;c.;
they were so far rewarded as to find an abundant supply of hermit
crabs, which were new to many of them. None of the shells
obtained struck me as being very curious or new. The party on the
bank spread far and wide over the ground in quest of Glenelg
treasures,&mdash;I cannot say the treasures of the deep, for when
the vessel grounded the lead proclaimed ¼ less 1. Just before
sunset the vessel, in swinging with the flood-tide, bumped and
grazed upon the rocks in the bed of the river; there are not two
fathoms on the rocks at high water. After sunset we sailed to a
point in the river, long. E. 124° 42' 10", lat. S. 15° 45' 34",
three miles from our anchorage of the 28th June, and then
anchored to await the tide of to-morrow morning, so that we may
have daylight to pass the narrows and rocky islands; it would be
imprudent to attempt the passage in the night owing to the force
of the tide. We observed at our last anchorage that there was a
considerable set of tide out of the opening opposite to which we
were anchored. This would argue some other communication of the
river with the sea, besides that with which we are already
acquainted: this, although a question of great interest, would be
a matter, the solution of which would now be quite foreign to the
object of the present expedition.</p>
<p><i>July</i> 27.&mdash;Sailed at 7.45 <small>A.M.</small> with
tide and wind north by east, in our favour; notwithstanding this
it required the boat, manned with four hands, to keep way upon
the vessel from time to time. Cast anchor in Maitland Bay at
11.20 close to the anchorage of the 28th June. Nearly the whole
party was here engaged in securing a baobab-tree and collecting
seeds. The inner part of the baobab set us all to work chewing
away, some pronouncing it almost as good as cocoa-nut; but for my
own part I think it tasted more like Indian rubber. At 8
<small>A.M.</small> sailed and passed through the channel between
the two islands off the southern extremity of the bay and the
main, with soundings all exceeding 10 fathoms. With a variable
wind we proceeded down George Water until 1 <small>A.M.</small>
Tuesday, 28th July, when both wind and tide leaving us, we
anchored in 10 fathoms (mud), in longitude E. 124° 34' 10",
latitude S. 15° 51' 35".</p>
<p><i>July</i> 28.&mdash;After a night of the most refreshing
sleep, so well appreciated by us after our steamed and mosquito
bitten nights on the Glenelg, we arose to see before us what we
desired in the south-west corner of George Water; namely&mdash;a
far wider, shorter, and from this distance we judge, a safer
outlet to the sea than the south-east channel, by which we
entered from Doubtful Bay. Sailed at 11.15 <small>A.M.</small>,
calm; at 1 <small>P.M.</small> a breeze sprung up, and we began
to beat towards the south-west passage, but at 3.15
<small>P.M.</small>, just as we had sighted a series of native
fires close by the shore, a loud grating noise&mdash;whilst I was
making entry of the last sounding ½ 5&mdash;and the sudden
stoppage of the vessel showed us that we were aground on some
rocks, where in a few moments the receding tide left us at an
angle of 30°, on a comparatively flat rock with deep water on
either side. The master of the vessel left in the long-boat to
examine the south-west passage, and after dusk he returned,
reporting a deep and safe passage, not as I supposed, to seaward,
but into Doubtful Bay, not very far distant from the south-east
passage. Just before sunset the natives on shore lighted up many
fires, and gave us a "cooee", but whether of friendship or
defiance I know not; however, we returned the salutation in like
form, and continued this pastime for an hour or so, hoping to
entice them, if they possessed canoes, to pay us a visit. On the
return of the long-boat the propriety of landing and tying up
some presents (we had brought looking-glasses and other trifles
with us for the purpose) to the trees was debated; but it was
thought generally, that the articles, when found, might be taken
possession of with the idea that they had stolen them from us,
and that the idea of our leaving them there intentionally as
presents, would involve too complex a matter for their
understanding. When the tide suite, which will be about 9
<small>P.M.</small>, the master of the <i>Flying Foam</i>
purposes to sail down the newly explored channel, so it is very
improbable the natives will see us depart. About 9
<small>P.M.</small> set sail from the rocks, but the wind
failing, had to tow the vessel down the south-west channel. It
was a much safer passage from Doubtful Bay into George Water than
the south-east one. The soundings were equally good, and its
width on an average twice that of the other, whilst there was no
dangerous navigation at all to be compared to the northern
extremity of the south-east channel. Two points shown in the
chart were exceedingly rugged, and there were many parts of the
shores precipitous and some cliffs quite perpendicular. We
reached Doubtful Bay in half an hour after midnight, and after
cruising for some little time in search of a wind, anchored
S.S.W. (nearly) of the south-west passage into George Water.</p>

<h3><span class="aa">Collier Bay</span>.</h3>
<p><i>July</i> 29.&mdash;An immense whale (humpback) estimated at
6 to 10 tons, is sporting about the bay. From this anchorage the
two mouths of the Glenelg appear to be in the positions indicated
on Grey's chart, and the shores of the bay and adjacent islands
to be moderately but not precisely correct. At 11
<small>A.M.</small> sailed with wind and tide into Collier Bay;
the breeze lasted until after sunset and carried us well up into
the bay, but then dropped and left us to the mercy of the tide,
which drifted us back again to the entrance, from whence it is
rather a pretty sight. It is a magnificent sheet of water; we
sailed closer to the eastern shore than the western, as it was
the wish of the party to land and examine the country sighted
from Mount Lizard. What makes the bay so interesting as we sail
along is the beautiful geological sections displayed every here
and there by hills and cliffs; the distance of our course from
the shore is too great to admit of more than a general
recognition of strata, but as I do not purpose accompanying the
party on the preliminary exploration on foot, I promise myself a
ramble along the shores, in the hope of an augmentation to my
various collections. The country at the head of the bay is
remarkably rugged: hills of very irregular conformation
confusedly piled, with here and there a cone of graceful outline.
Beyond all a lofty blue range towers over, whose summits are rent
and split occasionally in a grotesque manner; lower down towards
the level there is now and then a cubical block of old red
sandstone standing quite bare, and, viewed at a distance over
half a mile, looking very like a red brick house. The soundings
up to the present time have all been good, the leadsman having on
no occasion called less than 12 fathoms, and very frequently no
bottom at 15 fathoms. Drifted at 8.20 <small>P.M.</small> into 20
fathoms water, and there cast anchor for the night. The moonlight
is exceedingly brilliant here; some of our party seated on the
deck have more than once enjoyed a game of chess by moonlight.
This comfort of free exposure of face and hands to the cool
evening air after the muffling up we had recourse to on the
Glenelg, during the month of our river experience (this applies
only to the river itself, mosquitoes being rarities in the bush a
mile or so distant) becomes a boon we well know how to
appreciate.</p>
<p><i>July</i> 30.&mdash;At 6 <small>A.M.</small>, left the
anchorage of last night, and sailed till 8 <small>A.M.</small>,
when we anchored in Shoal Bay in 4 fathoms. Here the long-boat
left with a crew of three, and three days' provisions, with a
view to walk to some high hills and examine the country which
appeared so promising from Mount Lizard. Some of those left on
board landed on two of the islands for an hour or two's stroll in
the morning. They found nothing worthy of note except an
abundance of beans and numerous tracks of turtles. They noted
well the spot, however, and intend to re-visit the place this
evening in the hope of surprising one of these turtle visitors;
it will be acceptable to us as a change of food. Close to the
turtle-tracks a vast quantity of fine beans grow; they are now in
every stage of development from the green pod to the perfectly
ripe seed. So plentiful are they that we contemplate sending our
spare hands who remain on board to gather some sacks full; our
stock of vegetables has long since been exhausted. They observed
recent tracks of large parties of natives, who beyond doubt
assemble on these islands to feast on the produce of the sea. A
few corals and shells were brought to add to my collection. About
6 <small>P.M.</small>, the gig, with a crew, went to the
turtle-bank, but after waiting an hour or so returned
unsuccessful. The long-boat party also returned; the boat's crew
had not taken sufficient provisions to last 24 hours from the
vessel, and 12 of the biscuits of our land party were lost; hence
the return. They report the bay they entered as much larger than
laid down on the chart; it was the hay to the east of Shoal Bay.
They also found a river running into the south-east corner of
this bay, with the first wide reach running about south-east.
They did not get into this river for the reason above alleged.
From a hill on the southern shore of the bay they sighted a large
sheet of water E.N.E., which they thought might be Doubtful Bay,
but on marking the bearings on the chart, it would appear to be a
large sheet of water which would be found close to the opening
opposite to the anchorage of this morning. The country described
agrees so far with our distant view of it from Mount Lizard. They
brought with them three specimens of the native canoes, which are
a step, and that only, in advance of the single log so frequently
used by the Australian aborigines. They (the canoes&mdash;not the
aborigines) consist of three or four mangrove-sticks, about 6 or
7 feet in length, pegged together with pine. The ends of all the
sticks are carefully sharpened, and only such sticks as are
naturally bent to a suitable shape appear to be chosen; about the
middle of the canoe there is a pine pin projecting 6 or 7 inches
on either side, probably affording a similar support to the
native mariner as a stirrup does to a horseman. Of course there
is no attempt to make a bottom to the canoe, nor do the specimens
brought show the least sign of ornamentation. There is a red
ochreous stain to be detected upon them here and there, but we
account for them as having been communicated from the persons of
the natives coloured with <i>wilgi</i>, or they may possibly have
been designedly coloured with <i>wilgi</i> (red ochre). They also
brought the first specimen we had seen of a <i>Hakea</i>, some
few seeds, coral, and other natural objects, but nothing
remarkably interesting.</p>
<p><i>July</i> 31.&mdash;At 7 <small>A.M.</small>, the long-boat,
with an exploring party of six, taking with them a week's
provisions, left the vessel to examine the river supposed to
exist in the south-eastern corner of "Secure Bay", which latter
is laid down in the charts about half its real size. One of our
party and myself, an hour afterwards, left for the turtle
islands; we were, as we expected, too late for the turtles, but
their recent tracks upon the sand and their holes were numerous.
At the upper part of the sandy beach there were the remains of an
aboriginal festival. Many old fire-places, cracking stones,
break-winds, the soft shell of many a turtle's egg, with
fragments of a turtle's carapace, were noticed about the ground.
Near our fire we observed a portion of a native canoe; it was the
thicker end of one of the sticks, standing in the place of the
ribs; from this specimen we suppose the natives to be in
possession of sharp-edged tools, probably made from the same
greenstone which they sharpen their spears with, because the end
of the stick was formed by clean even cuts, with no sign of
scraping; but as they do not require boring tools, the
mangrove-sticks being evidently chosen when dry and capable of
being fastened by driving a sharpened pine peg through them, as a
carpenter would drive a nail through boards, they seem to be
unacquainted with the use of them. Moreover, the pine pegs drive
easily through the dry mangroves, and it is only rarely we find
the sticks split by the process. On the same sand-patch we found
large quantities of the beans, whose creeping runners are of
enormous length, some exceeding 40 paces. As the seed was nearly
ripe I collected 1½ pint, and gathered a few of the green pods
hoping to be able to dry and preserve them. Growing along with
the beans was a convolvulus whose shoots equalled theirs in
length; a small quantity of its seed I also preserved; we could
only find one flower, and that not larger than that of C.
<i>major</i> grown in England; its colour was of a purplish pink,
with the usual deeper tinge of colours towards the centre of each
petal. We then walked up a valley with a water-course having deep
stony holes but no water, nor were there any palms to indicate
permanent water even at a depth below the ground, so that we
imagine the island to be surface-watered, and that alone. When
the natives visit this island in the dry season to enjoy a turtle
feast they must bring the water from the mainland in shells; for
these latter we sought carefully but unsuccessfully.</p>
<p>The formation of the island is old red sandstone and
freestone, the latter of excellent quality; in one or two places
the strata are vertical, but in general the dip is south at an
angle of about 15°. Instances of <i>scoria</i> were occasionally
met with, and between the water-marks, here 37 feet distant, the
formation was evidently volcanic. The trees were not by any means
stunted, the eucalypti attaining a height of 50 feet and upwards,
but all gave evidences of occasional strong winds prevailing
which caused the trunks to grow in anything but a straight line.
The fact was the more apparent to us because we had noticed in
the Glenelg district how very straight all the timber, from the
smallest to the largest, grew. The grass was thin but of good
quality. The surface of the ground being covered with loose
stones we merely walked to the top of the hill, whence we enjoyed
a magnificent view of Collier Bay and our good little vessel at
anchor, a mere speck on the water. We then returned to the sandy
beach and spent a couple of hours in examining the shells and
corals; there were but few good shells, but the specimens of
corals were numerous, and my collection included more than an
average number of species. Foraminifera are rare in the
drift-sand. Towards noon we returned to the boat; <i>en route</i>
to the ship we espied, coming rapidly towards us, a dark object
which from its direction of progress through the water we thought
might possibly be a native crossing the bay on his canoe. As the
line of travelling of this object did not exactly coincide with
our course, we at once steered towards it in the hope of at least
witnessing the mode of propelling and guiding the singular craft
used as a canoe. Great was our disappointment to find our native
and his canoe to be only the roots of a large tree floating
steadily, trunk downwards, through the water; nor was it a little
provoking to find a white spot on the top, on which we had laid
good stress in our predication, turn out to be a sea-bird perched
there and enjoying a quiet sleep until the noise of our approach
awoke him, made him stare a little at our intrusion, and then
take to flight in utter consternation.</p>
<p>At dusk the long-boat and exploring party returned. They had
passed safely through Secure Bay and entered the river passage,
which is very narrow, has an island in the middle and
perpendicular cliffs on both sides, and a tide which ebbs and
flows with wonderful force; passing up the reach they had come to
a second narrow passage of greater velocity and danger than the
former. Here whirlpools were formed by the flowing tide, and only
by the united strength of all on board was the boat prevented
being drawn in; fortunately the passage was clear of rocks, for
the velocity was estimated at 20 miles per hour, and of course
the slightest check or impediment would have dashed the boat to
pieces, and certain death alone would have stared the explorers
in the face. This hurling of the boat through the second passage,
as through a sluice, terminated in the discovery of a large sheet
of water, equal in extent to George Water, bounded on all sides
by mangrove banks and creeks. With difficulty effecting a
landing, they ascended a high hill of a dark purple coloured
granite, on which only scattered tufts of spinifex and stunted
bushes grew, the rest was all bare granite boulders and
fragments, to walk safely over which the greatest attention to
the footing was every moment necessary. From the summit no view
was obtained, save of numerous cones and bluffs of granite
equally bare and difficult to walk over. The large sheet of water
E.N.E. of Secure Bay was not again sighted. On consideration, it
was thought prudent to return to the vessel at once and proceed
to Roebuck Bay, as the corn and water on board the vessel would
not last more than a month from the time we left the Glenelg, and
to reach the country we sighted from Mount Lizard from this point
would certainly make a sad inroad into the stock of provender and
water, and these failing, nothing could be done save the killing
and throwing overboard some, if not all, of the horses.
Therefore, at 8 <small>P.M.</small>, both boats were hoisted on
board, and all made ready to sail from this bay, <i>en route</i>
to Roebuck Bay, by to-morrow morning's tide. The tide here to-day
rose 36 feet.<br></p>

Glenelg River, by Captain Cooper</span>.*</h2>

<h3><span class="aa">Introduction</span>.</h3>
<p>We are indebted to the kindness of Mr. W. Bateman for the
following particulars obtained from the log of the <em>Flying
Foam</em>, and kept during her interesting trip to the Glenelg,
in which river she was the first vessel to anchor. The schooner
completed the embarkation of her passengers and stock, on
Saturday, June 6th. The passengers were, Messrs. K. Brown,
Hamersley, A. Brown, Clarkson, Dr. Martin, Messrs. S. Pearse,
Summerfield, Taylor, Monger, and Redman. The stock consisted of 6
horses and 21 sheep. On Sunday, 7th June, (ship's time), at 3
p.m., the vessel left Champion Bay. On the 8th, was off Dirk
Hartog's Island. On the 13th, sighted North West Cape at 8 a.m.,
and Muiron Island at 10 a.m. At 3 a.m. on 14th sighted
Montebello, and hove ship till daylight, when they rounded the
island. On the 15th, at 6 p.m., sighted Rosemary Islands. June
18th, at 8 a.m., sighted land, and at 10 a.m. passed Cape
Baskerville. Native fires were seen as far as the eye could reach
all along the coast. On the 19th, at 8 a.m., passed the Cape
Borda, and at 10 a.m. passed the Twin Islands. Saturday, June 20;
calm clear weather; very hot. At 4 p.m. drifted between the two
islands. Among the islands at 8 am. On 21st June, at 4 p.m.,
dropped anchor in 10 fathoms water, north of a small island
called Cockell Island, At 4 a.m., 22nd June, got under-way, and
at noon, sighted Lizard Island. Shaped course for Doubtful Bay at
4 p.m., and at 8 p.m. got to the entrance of the passage; current
running about 7 knots, and the vessel running with a fresh breeze
with all sail set, yet still losing ground. At 10 p.m. got inside
the passage, after the current had abated, and at midnight came
to anchor in the entrance of the bay, in fifteen fathoms water.
Lat. 15 d. 57 m.; Long. 124 d. 29 m. During the trip a large
number of whales were seen. Plenty of water was found all through
the passage, with high bold islands, on either side. Twenty
fathoms was the least depth through the passage. Saw native fires
all round. Water smooth, without a ripple, and the tide running
about 7 knots an hour.</p>

<h3><span class="aa">Journal</span>.</h3>
<p>Doubtful Bay, <i>June</i> 22 [1863], (shore time). At 5 a.m.
manned the boat and went on shore, but could not travel far, on
account of the stones and rocks. Saw plenty of native fires and
some natives, who came down after we left, burning the bush all
along our tracks. At 4 p.m. came on board and proceeded towards
the supposed Glenelg River. At 6 30. p.m. anchored in 13 fathoms
water close to the land, with the trees hanging over the
masthead. Calm, still weather, and not a ripple on the water.</p>
<p><i>June</i> 23.&mdash;At 10 a.m., got under-way and proceeded
towards the river. Came through some very rapid passes, and
crossed a large bay or sheet of water that would hold nearly all
the ships in the world, perfectly land-locked, and plenty of
water, from 30 fathoms down to 7 and 5. At 4 p.m. came to anchor
in 10 fathoms water, mud bottom. Got out the boat and, proceeded
through a fine channel in the mangroves. Went on shore and saw
plenty of very high grass everywhere&mdash;nothing but grass to
be seen. At 8 p.m. came on board. Weather calm and clear. Tide
rises about 30 feet.</p>
<p><i>June</i> 24.&mdash;Not a breath of wind; water as smooth as
a lake. At 8 a.m. proceeded in the boat to the other side of the
supposed river, to look for another entrance, but could not find
a good one. On board at noon, got under-way, and preceded up the
river as far as was considered prudent. Brought up in 10 fathoms
water, in the middle of the river, and then went with both boats
up two separate branches of the river as far as the boats would
go; and it then became dark, and we returned on board. The water
had then fallen 18 feet. At low water the banks of the river were
level with our foreyard. These banks are muddy, and thickly
wooded. There were plenty of cockatoos; and native fires on the
hills around. Tide rises 35 feet.</p>
<p><i>June</i> 25.&mdash;At 4 a.m. manned the boat and went to
look for fresh water. Messrs. A. Brown and Clarkson were with me
(Captain Cooper) in the boat, with Taylor, one of their men.
Messrs. K. Brown and Hamersley went in the small boat. Pulled
about seven miles, and landed at some native fires, but saw
neither natives nor water. Went about 3 miles further up a
mangrove creek, and while about 50 yards away from the boat,
looking for water, saw about 30 natives. They were wild, savage,
and big men, and they came upon us, with their large spears
shipped, apparently determined to spear us. I waited until they
came within 20 yards, and then fired at the largest of the party,
who seemed to be a chief. He dropped, but the others did not stop
when he fell, but came on like bloodhounds. Mr. A. Brown then
fired and hit one of the others; Mr. Clarkson also fired and
wounded a third; upon which they set up an awful yell, and
disappeared through the thicket, and we could not follow them,
being up to our thighs in mud. Messrs. K. Brown and Hamersley had
gone in the other boat to look at the country. At 4 p.m. came on
board, the other party also returning. Saw alligators' tracks in
two or three places, and heard plenty after dark. The water rose
36 feet. Horses and sheep all on board, and doing well.</p>
<p>Friday, 26<i>th June</i>.&mdash;At 4 a.m. manned both boats
and went in search of water. Found some at the foot of a hill on
the north side of the river. Returned at 9 a.m. and at 10 a.m.
took both boats up the mangrove creek; landed, and cut a road
through to the fresh water&mdash;about half a mile. The mud was
some three feet thick, so that we had to cover the road all the
way with bushes before we could walk on it. Afterwards dug two
wells close to the spring. Saw plenty of alligators' tracks, and
in the morning two alligators swimming across the river. At 5
p.m. came on board and got the vessel under way, towing her up
nearer the watering place.</p>
<p><i>June</i> 27.&mdash;At 5 a.m. Messrs. A. Brown and Hamersley
manned the small boat, and went in search of another entrance to
the Glenelg. At half past 5 went ashore in the large boat, with 6
hands, to carry down the water through the mangroves, returning
at 9 a.m. with 2 hhds. and 6 buckets of water. At 11 a.m. again
went ashore and filled two casks, but had to leave them until
high water. Had to roll the casks for half a mile through mud 14
inches deep, and returned to the vessel at 6 p.m. Water rose 30
feet, it being nearly quarter moon. At midnight Messrs. Brown and
Hamersley came on board, having discovered the entrance to the
Glenelg River.</p>
<p><i>June</i> 28.&mdash;At 5 a.m. got under way, and proceeded
towards the Glenelg. At 10 a.m. came to anchor in a fine little
bay by the mouth of the River. Current very rapid, and the rise
of tide 36 feet. At 4 p.m. got under way and went up the river,
the tide being very strong. The mouth of the river is full of
islands, but there was plenty of water, and we could get no
bottom in the entrance. At 7.30. p.m. anchored in a little bay in
the river, in 5 fathoms water; sandy bottom. Calm clear weather.
Plenty of native fires all round.</p>
<p><i>June</i> 29.&mdash;At 8 a.m. got under way and proceeded up
the river, and at 10 o'clock anchored in 4 fathoms
water&mdash;fine soft bottom. At 11 manned the boat and went up
the river to sound. Found a landing place for the horses. At 4
p.m. came to the rapids, and found plenty of fresh water. The
grass was from 7 to 8 feet high, the banks of the river being
lined with it, so that one could scarcely walk through it. Saw
plenty of ducks and a turkey. Came on board at midnight. The
vessel grounded on soft mud this tide. Shot an alligator.</p>
<p><i>June</i> 30.&mdash;At 6 a.m. got under way and sailed up
the river, anchoring at noon in 5 fathoms water&mdash;muddy
bottom, dry at low water. Saw 5 alligators. At 10 p.m. got under
way and went up the river, coming to anchor at midnight in 4
fathoms water&mdash;muddy bottom. Heard the noise of alligators,
and some awful noises in the mangroves. The banks of the river
all the way up are all mud and mangroves. Vessel at anchor about
3 miles from the Rapids spoken of by Sir George Grey. Swarms of
moschetoes.</p>
<p>Glenelg, <i>July</i> 1, 1863.&mdash;At 10 a.m. got under way
and towed up the river, to find a place for landing the horses.
At 2 p.m. came to anchor in 3½ fathoms water&mdash;mud bottom.
Went on shore and cut a road through the mangroves, ready for
landing the horses. Very fine country, but swarming with
moschetoes. Aground every tide on soft mud. Shot 5 large ducks
and 2 fine geese. There are plenty of alligators and ducks and
geese. The vessel is about 1 mile from the rapids, and cannot go
farther up with safety.</p>
<p><i>July</i> 2.&mdash;At 8 a.m. went on shore and shot three
large geese, and 3 large birds, measuring 5 ft. 9 in. from wing
to wing, and 5 feet in height. At 10 a.m. hauled alongside the
land and landed all the horses safe and in good order, swinging
them on shore from the foreyard. At 2 pm. went up to the Rapids,
with saddles, saddle-bags, provisions, &amp;c. Messrs. K. Brown,
Clarkson, Hamersley, Summerfield, and Redman went with the
horses, and met the boat at the Rapids, where they intend to
camp. The horses were in fine condition. Shot a crocodile as we
returned in the boat.</p>
<p><i>July</i> 3.&mdash;At 5 a.m. went up to the Rapids for
water; killed a large snake. Had to wait until the water rose to
get on board again. Returned to the vessel at 3 p.m. and sent the
other boat to the camp with provisions, &amp;c. The vessel will
remain here and take in water while the party go to Camden Sound,
over land.</p>
<p>Saturday, <i>July</i> 4.&mdash;Went to the Rapids for water at
5 a.m. Dr. Martin went to the camp. Fine clear weather, but very
hot. One of the sheep died through drinking too much water. Rise
and fall of the tide 28 feet. Saw native fires. The vessel
aground in the mud, but the tide rises rapidly, and the vessel
floats in 15 minutes from the time the river begins to rise.</p>
<p><i>July</i> 5.&mdash;Sent the boat for water, and to the camp
with the sheep. Three sheep died this morning. At 4 p.m. the
Doctor came on board and reported that he had found one of the
trees marked by Grey on the banks of the river. Nothing but calm,
clear weather, but we are nearly driven mad by moschetoes at
night and flies by day.</p>
<p><i>July</i> 6.&mdash;Messrs. Kenneth Brown and Clarkson and
Dr. Martin started this morning for Camden Sound with 5 horses.
Cannot get any rest with the moschetoes.</p>
<p><i>July</i> 7&mdash;Sent boat to the Rapids for water. Tide
rises from 21 to 23 feet. Calm weather; moschetoes deprive us of
rest.</p>
<p><i>July</i> 8.&mdash;At noon very hot; swarms of flies. Plenty
of native's fires on the hills. Current not running so rapidly.
Rise of water at neap tide 18 feet at spring tide 26 feet. This
is where Grey struck the river; found several of his marked
trees.</p>
<p><i>July</i> 9.&mdash;At noon very hot, swarms of flies. Saw 3
large crocodiles. Plenty of native fires on the hills. Obliged to
have fires on deck and below to keep away the moschetoes. At
midnight calm weather, not a breath of air; fish and alligators
jumping all round, but the former will not take the bait. No
natives seen from the camp yet.</p>
<p>Friday. 10<i>th July</i>.&mdash;Sent the boat for the last lot
of water. Dr. Martin came on board from Camden Harbour and
reports plenty of very fine country, with abundance of good grass
and water&mdash;one of the finest countries in the world.</p>
<p><i>July</i> 11.&mdash;At 5 a.m. went to the camp and made up a
party to go out shooting. At 2 p.m. come on board, having shot 2
geese and one large bird, measuring 7 feet 9 inches from wing to
wing; height 5 feet 9 inches. Sent the boat to the camp with Mr.
K. Brown and shooting party.</p>
<p><i>July</i> 12&mdash;Still calm weather. Vessel aground every
tide on soft mud, perfectly upright.</p>
<p><i>July</i> 13.&mdash;Fresh breezes from N.E. Sent the boat to
the camp with a party going to explore to the Southward.</p>
<p><i>July</i> 14.&mdash;Fresh breezes from N.E. Sent boat to
camp with Mr. A. Brown. Caught 14 fish. At midnight calm.</p>
<p><i>July</i> 15.&mdash;Light breezes from N.E. Boat came from
the camp for articles for an exploring party to the North.</p>
<p><i>July</i> 16.&mdash;Light breezes from N.E. Messrs. Clarkson
and Hamersley started to explore to the North. Very heavy dew at
night.</p>
<p><i>July</i> 17&mdash;Light breeze from N.E. and calm at noon.
Swarmed with flies. Caught 10 fish and shot 2 geese.</p>
<p><i>July</i> 18.&mdash;Light breezes from N.E., and calm at
mid-day. The vessel has one anchor down, and stern rope fast to
the bushes, and so she is moored. Shot an alligator. Latitude 15
d. 40 m.; long. 124 d. 50 m.</p>
<p><i>July</i> 19.&mdash;Calm clear weather, and very hot.</p>
<p><i>July</i> 20.&mdash;Messrs. Clarkson &amp; Hamersley
returned to camp, having knocked up their horses; so that they
were unable to travel.</p>
<p><i>July</i> 21.&mdash;Dr. Martin and Mr. A. Brown came on
board. They had knocked up one of their horses, and were obliged
to return to camp. They saw some very fair country, well watered,
and plenty of grass, but very bad for travelling.</p>
<p><i>July</i> 22.&mdash;Clear weather; very hot. Getting
fittings ready for the horses.</p>
<p><i>July</i> 23. Got 2 horses on board. The party make up their
minds to give up the place. There is plenty of good grass and
water everywhere.</p>
<p><i>July</i> 24.&mdash;Calm clear weather. Shot an alligator,
and brought him on board; measured 6 feet 4 inches. Got all the
horses on board, and the members of the party, except two, who
remained at camp with the sheep.</p>
<p><i>July</i> 25.&mdash;Got the sheep on board. At noon light
breeze from N.E. Unmoored the ship and hove short; at 6 p.m. got
under-way, and worked down the river. At 9 p.m. came to anchor in
7 fathoms water. No moschetoes.</p>
<p><i>July</i> 27&mdash;Cloudy weather. At 7 a.m. got under-way
with a light breeze from the N.W., and proceeded down the river.
Came to anchor at 11 a.m. in ten fathoms water, in Albury Bay. At
8 p.m. got under-way with the ebb tide and a light breeze from
the N.E., and got out into George's Water. Came to anchor in 12
fathoms water; mud and sand bottom; land-locked, with plenty of
water.</p>
<p>George's Water, <i>July</i> 28.&mdash;At 10 a.m. got under-way
and proceeded towards Doubtful Bay. At 4 p.m. aground on a bank,
it being nearly low water. Went in the boat and found a good
passage into Doubtful Bay, with plenty of water for my ship to go
through.</p>
<p>Doubtful Bay, <i>July</i> 29.&mdash;Came to anchor at 3 a.m.
in 3 fathoms at low water, on a sand bank. At 11 a.m. got
under-way, and proceeded towards Collier Bay. At 9 p.m. came to
anchor in 20 fathoms water. Strong current.</p>
<p>Collier Bay, <i>July</i> 30.&mdash;At 5 a.m. got under-way,
and proceeded down the Bay. At 7. 30. a.m. came to anchor in 3
fathoms, low water, off Shoal Bay, in Collier Bay. At 9 a.m.
party took the boat to look for good country. Went on shore to
look for water, but could not find any. At 7 p.m. party same
back, after going through some very dangerous places, and without
seeing good land. They brought back part of two old native
canoes, pieces of wood pegged together with deal pegs. Plenty of
native fires a little way inland. Rise of tide about 33 ft. Very
deep in some places; could not get bottom.</p>
<p>Collier Bay, <i>July</i> 31.&mdash;At 6 a.m. Messrs. K. Brown,
Clarkson, Pearce, Monger, Summerfield, and Taylor take the boat
with 5 days' rations, and returned at 6 p.m., having nearly lost
the boat and themselves in a whirlpool. Calm clear weather, very
hot; rise of tide 35 feet. No fresh water anywhere. Lat. 16 deg.
21 min.; long. 124 deg. 20 min. Party determine to go to Roebuck
Bay.</p>
<p><em>Aug.</em> 1.&mdash;At 6 a.m. got under way, and proceeded
towards Roebuck Bay. On the 2nd pass Montgomery Island; on the
4th pass Lacepede Island, wind S.E., blowing hard. On the 5th
party desire to go to Nicol Bay. Wind S.E., blowing fresh; thick
heavy weather. Lat. 18 deg 45 min.; long. 119 deg 41 min.</p>
<p><em>Aug.</em> 6.&mdash;Sighted Delambre island, it blowing
very hard at the time. At noon came to anchor in 4 fathoms under
Lewis island. Got the boat out and went on shore to look for
water, but could not find any.</p>
<p><i>August</i> 7.&mdash;At 6 a.m. got under way, and proceeded
towards Barrow island; sighted Montebello islands and the N.W.
Cape on the 8th; on the 12th pass Sharks Bay, and on the 13th
arrived at Champion Bay.</p>

<h3><span class="aa">From Champion Bay to Camden
Harbor</span>.</h3>
<div style="text-align:center;"><span class="aa">Thursday</span>,
10th March, 1864.</div>
<p>(1.)&mdash;Went on board the schooner <i>New Perseverance</i>
at 6 a.m. Two of the settlers of Champion Bay District&mdash;two
of the most liberal contributors, in this neighborhood, to the
means of the Expedition,&mdash;T. Burges, and M. Morrissey,
Esquires, came off at the same hour to bid us a last adieu.</p>
<p>(2.)&mdash;A fine breeze favoring us, we set sail at 6.45
a.m.; in a short time we lost sight of Champion Bay. At noon we
were in long. E. 111 deg. 2 min. and lat. S. 28 deg. 15 min. 30
sec. The same fine breeze from the S.S.W. continued in our favor
until midnight, giving us an average speed of 6 knots, under easy
sail, with yards nearly square, and with no heavy sea. The vessel
rolled a little, but the motion was not so great as to put more
than a few of the members of the expedition <i>hors de
combat</i>.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><span class="aa">Friday</span>,
11th March.</div>
<p>(3.)&mdash;Throughout the day, the same wind, veering only a
few degrees, carried us along at about the same rate and with the
same amount of comfort as yesterday.</p>
<p>(4.)&mdash;At noon we were abreast of and 14 miles distant
from Dirk Hartog's island: in long E. 112 deg. 25 min. and lat.
S. 26 deg. 1 min.</p>
<p>(5.)&mdash;Oceanic flying fish (Exocetus volitans) and a shoal
of grampuses (Delphinus orca) were the only fish noticed.</p>
<p>(6.) Compared with my last voyage in the <i>Flying Foam</i>,
the present promises to be a more comfortable voyage, and to
yield more successful results in my particular department. I find
the sole possession of a cabin, although its cubical contents I
may as well not ascertain; to be of essential service in the
making of preparations for anticipated collections; it is a
source of great comfort too, in the storing away securely of the
instruments and appliances already brought into use for the
keeping of tolerably complete register of meteorological and
other phænomena;&mdash;observing of these, whilst afloat, I have
entrusted to my friend Arthur Du Boulay, on whom I can depend for
a faithful and correct register of these important matters.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><span class="aa">Saturday</span>,
12th March.</div>
<p>(7.)&mdash;No great change to-day either as to wind or sea.
Our rate of sailing also is the same. At noon we were in long. E.
112 deg. 56 min. and lat. S. 23 deg. 34 min., off Cape Farquhar
but at a distance of 40 miles from it. The stock on board, both
horses and sheep, doing well; the former have plenty of room,
good and attendance.</p>
<p>(8.)&mdash;Thus far we have every reason to be thankful: the
fairest wind we could desire:&mdash;a comparatively smooth
sea,&mdash;a good ship and careful master&mdash;and companions
bent on making the least of every evil incident to a sea
trip&mdash;rejoicing in healthful merriment, without forgetting
the author at all.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><span class="aa">Sunday</span>,
13th March.</div>
<p>(9)&mdash;Another day of lair wind anal pleasant bailing. At
early dawn we sighted, at a distance of about 12 miles, the
peninsular terminated northwards by North-West Cape. At noon in
longitude E. 113 deg. 50 min., and latitude S. 21 deg. 34 min. 30
sec. Although passing North-West Cape at half the distance (25
miles) mentioned in F. Gregory's Journal of 7th May, 1861,
neither its geological formation,&mdash;soil (especially that
"back on the hills"),&mdash;grass,&mdash;large
wattles,&mdash;flooded gumtrees,&mdash;nor its mineral
indications, could we see: the weather notwithstanding, being
perfectly clear.</p>
<p>(10.)&mdash;In the morning the Church service was read: eleven
only attended.</p>
<p>(11.)&mdash;To-day the first water-snake (hydrus) was seen.
Moke, the native, a headsman of repute, I am
told,&mdash;harpooned a porpoise; but the line breaking, it
proved a dear venture; only two harpoons now remain.</p>
<p>(12.)&mdash;The barometer is falling: this I interpret to be
an indication of the approaching loss of our good friend the S.W.
wind, at no Tong interval of time.</p>
<p>(13.)&mdash;At sun-set, refraction distorted the image of the
sun's disk in a singular manner. Some three or four seconds after
contact of the lower, limb with the sea horizon,&mdash;when,
consequently, the whole body had been actually immersed as many
seconds,&mdash;the upper part of the refracted image assumed
first a bell-shaped outline and then a form resembling a solar
lamp-shade, ultimately disappearing with startling rapidity, just
after taking the shape of a compressed cone. A large spot,
distinctly visible to the naked eye, was soon in an equatorial
direction about 10 sec. from the prime vertical, northwards, as
viewed upon the horizon. This distortion is not by any means an
unusual phænomenon in these latitudes. I remember in the months
of June and August of last year (1863) on several occasions I
noticed similar displays, although, at the time, I had no
opportunity of recording them.</p>
<p>(14)&mdash;From noon to 4 p.m. the tide and current swept us
16 miles to the eastward.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><span class="aa">Monday</span>,
14th March.</div>
<p>(15.)&mdash;Our fairest of winds still continues faithful: but
barometrical and other indications foretell a proximate change.
In the early morning we sailed through a mass of whale, food,
(composed principally of species of the genus
Clionidæ&mdash;predominating species Clio australis), whose
general direction was east and west, that is, in the line of
tidal movement here, but broken up into streaks floating north
and south, by the action of a S.W. wind now prevailing many
days.</p>
<p>(16.)&mdash;The boatswain, or Tropic bird (Phaeton), a bird of
frequent occurrence on the north-west coast of Tropical
Australia, of a pearly white plumage, red beak and jet-black
webbed feet, with two most delicate feathers, equal in length to
of the body, projecting in a line with the body, from the
tail,&mdash;has been our frequent attendant these few days
past.</p>
<p>(17.)&mdash;At noon in longitude E. 114 deg. 38 min. 30 sec.,
and latitude S. 19 deg. 40 min.; Ritchie's Reef bearing S. by E.,
distant 35 miles. At noon the wind decreased rapidly to a calm
which lasted until 11 p.m. During this calm the vessel drifted
rapidly stern foremost in a N.E. direction at a rate of not less
than 2K per hour. The sun-set of to-day was attended by refracted
distortions of the image, partaking of the same general character
as those described yesterday. The largo solar spot was again
distinctly seen. During the afternoon the heat was somewhat
oppressive: our solar radiation thermometer indicating a
temperature of 113.5 deg. at 3 p.m.</p>
<p>(18.)&mdash;The little spider closely allied to Argyroneta
aquatica, noticed off the Lacepede Islands during a calm in June
1863, was once more seen disporting around the vessel, but it
darted about with a zigzag motion of so great swiftness as to
preclude the very hope of entrapping a specimen, under the
circumstances. During the calm a host of sober-tinted medusæ
travelled with the current, but at a rate greatly exceeding the
progress of the vessel. A large shark seems to have selected a
shady place beneath us: a glimpse of it only, was caught this
afternoon at a very à propos moment namely, when a project of
bathing was under discussion. It appears to be a large basking
shark (Selachias maximus) and it is suspected to have been our
attendant for some days past; I dare say the inducement to
persevere in this attendance is great. Besides the offal usually
finding its way overboard from ships at sea, a great feast no
doubt results from the killing of a sheep nearly every day as we
now do.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><span class="aa">Tuesday</span>,
15th March.</div>
<p>(19.)&mdash;Just sufficient breeze from the westward to keep
way upon the vessel, from 11 o'clock last night until 8 a.m.
to-day. The heat of the past night was very oppressive, although
the thermometer at no time road higher than 86 deg. The
hygrometer, however, has remained steadily at perfect saturation
for the last twelve hours. Some of my fellow-travellers essayed
sleeping on the deck, but a dew of 10 in amount, the maximum,
drove the majority under shelter.</p>
<p>(20.)&mdash;In the early morning a great number of sharks
played about the Vessel, but they refused every tempting bait
offered to them. Streaks of whale-food in an E. to W. direction
were again sailed through; one must have been nearly two miles in
length.</p>
<p>(21.)&mdash;At 8 a.m. a S.E. breeze set in. This brought a
smile to many a face: for the stillness of the air at 86 deg. has
a relaxing effect upon the levator anguli oris and zygomaticus
major muscles which allows the depressor labii inferioris to come
into action; whilst air of the same temperature in motion
contracts these former, the levator anguli oris and the
zygomatici, so as almost to ignore the existence of the depressor
labii inferioris altogether, and give a cheery appearance to
nearly every lice.</p>
<p>(22.)&mdash;The S.E. breeze, about 9 a.m., wore round to
E.N.E., force 3, but it soon went back again to S.E. and remained
steadily until sundown. At noon in longitude E. 115 deg. 7 min.
45 sec., and latitude. S. 19 de,. 48 min. In the afternoon the
breeze slackened but did not wholly die away; at 7 p.m. it veered
round to W. giving us a rate of three knots per hour until
midnight. The first whale was seen this evening near the ship;
but as we saw it rise only once, its species cannot be
predicated.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><span class=
"aa">Wednesday</span>, 16th March.</div>
<p>(23.)&mdash;The breeze has been blowing since midnight, having
passed from W. to W. by S., thence to S.E. The sea quite
still.</p>
<p>(24.)&mdash;Several yellow water-snakes (hydrophes) were seen
to-day. This morning's sail approaches perfection, so far as
comfort is concerned; the sea has but a ripple upon its surface;
there are, however, impatient spirits on board, who wish for
still a little more wind. Tropical "dolce far niente" has now
possessed the majority of our party: submission having been
yielded at the first but unanswerable summons.</p>
<p>(25.)&mdash;At noon in longitude E. 116 deg. 19 min. 45 sec.,
and latitude S. 19 deg. 47 min. Examining instruments in the
forenoon: they are all safe at present; those supplied from the
Survey Office, Perth, are in very good order.</p>
<p>(26.)&mdash;At 2 p.m. the wind went round to E.N.E. Towards 9
p.m. it slackened to very nearly a calm. At 8 p.m. the glare of a
large fire was seen upon the southern horizon. The nearest land
bearing S. is Rosemary Island, distant 38 or 39 miles: but the
glare does not snake the fire appear so far off. At 4 p.m.
soundings with the deep-sea lead gave 35 fathoms; bottom, fine
siliceous sand and small water-worn sandstone and quartz pebbles,
generally of a spindle shape, whose generating arcs were either
parabolic or elliptic.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><span class="aa">Thursday</span>,
17th March.</div>
<p>(27.)&mdash;Throughout the morning till noon, we were
becalmed, or nearly so; the distance made since noon yesterday
until the same hour of to-day, is under twenty miles, but
fortunately it is on our course eastward. Longitude E. 116 deg.
39 min. 45 sec., and latitude S. 19 deg. 48 min. at noon. In the
afternoon, after various cats' paws had disappointed us, a gentle
breeze from the north-west in it promises to hold good for a few
hours at least. A great number of sharks and snakes (the latter
all hydrophes) were seen during the afternoon and evening. The
solar spot at sun-set was again observed, linear shaped, and at 2
sec. distance from the limb.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><span class="aa">Friday</span>,
18th March.</div>
<p>(28.)&mdash;The N.W. breeze held good until day-light, when a
much stronger wind set in from the eastward; its force at 7 a.m.
was 6. This wind continued till noon when we were in longitude E.
118 deg. 3 min: 30 sec., and latitude S. 19 deg. 9 min. At 3.30
p.m. the wind left us; during the calm which lasted till 8.30
p.m., there was a heavy cross swell from the E. and N. which
produced a disagreeable compound movement of the vessel.</p>
<p>(29.)&mdash;Between noon and 4 p.m., a current drifted the
vessel four miles to the westward. At 5 p.m. soundings were again
taken with the deep-sea lead (weight 3011;). There was a depth of
48 fathoms: and the lead brought up coral, gravel and shells: the
latter studded with the calcareous and horny polypidoms of
various species of polyzoa and compound Tunicata to whose
examination, at some future date, I look forward with no small
degree I of pleasure. During the afternoon and evening, three
sharks were caught; one was, according to the sailors, a
"shovel-headed" shark; they were all small, the largest not much
exceeding six feet in length. At 8.30 p.m. a gentle breeze from
the Westward sprang up, veering north about to S.E., force 3-4.
No dew whatever; this, together with a high barometer, 30.080
inches, presages a strong wind from the south or south-east.</p>

<p>(30.)&mdash;At 3 a.m., it was blowing so heavily from the
south-east that it became necessary to shorten sail; the force
ultimately ranged between 7-8, when the top-sail was reefed. The
sleepers on the deck-house were driven from their pleasantly cool
quarters long before the dawn of day: a loss of certain articles
of elegant nautical attire being sustained.</p>
<p>(31.)&mdash;Several small land birds were flying about the
rigging both yesterday and to-day. A locust also came on board:
it was captured and preserved; but it differs in no way from the
species commonly found in the neighbourhood of Perth, and other
parts of Western Australia; even the yellow tint of the second
pair of wings is no deeper, as one might have expected from ten
degrees nearer approach to the equator. At noon we were in
longitude E. 118 deg. 30 min., and latitude S. 18 deg. 52 min.,
with very little wind, and that contrary, and a heavy short cross
sea.</p>
<p>(32.)&mdash;In the afternoon an immense shoal of black fish
(Physeter Tursio) was passed through; one was harpooned, but
though killed, it could not be got on board. One more shark,
however, proved an easier prey. A king-fisher, blown out to sea
by the morning's wind, was likewise caught; it proved to be a
dull-colored species of the genus Dacelo: but not being
perfect,&mdash;its feathers were damaged probably by its struggle
to regain the shore in the morning and by the ropes or the vessel
in the afternoon,&mdash;after examining it, it was set free. Two
or three species of, Libellulidiæ, (dragon-flies) were also seen
flying round the vessel, but they did not settle.</p>
<p>(33.)&mdash;During the afternoon and evening until 8.30 pm.
For the first hour after sun-set there wan a heavy dew, but it
all disappeared by 8 o'clock. At 8.30 p.m. a gradually increasing
wind from the south commenced blowing: the force imperceptibly
rose from 0.5 when it set in, to 4, at midnight. The sea, up to
this date, has displayed but few phosphorescent creatures at
night.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><span class="aa">Sunday</span>,
20th March.</div>
<p>(34.)&mdash;At 4 a.m. the wind had increased to force 6-7,
when it became necessary to shorten sail; and, from the wind
having veered to N.N.E., to change the course. This wind held
good, though of a gradually decreasing force, until 3.30 p.m. At
10.30 a.m. the morning service was small; only eight attended. At
noon our longitude was E. 118 deg. 29 min. 30 sec., and latitude
19 deg. 16 min. in green water apparently holding sand, in a
manner similar to that within a mile or two of the coast line.
Did we not know to the contrary the discoloration would lead us
to believe we were off the mouth of some large river.</p>
<p>(35.)&mdash;At 3 p.m. the deep-sea lead gave us bottom, at 25
fathoms, consisting or siliceous sand, very fine gravel chiefly
composed of arenaceous limestone, Polythalamia, nautilus-shaped
spirorbis, and small bivalve shells. A large turtle (Chelonia
midas) the first seen this voyage, was observed in the afternoon;
it was swimming with its head well out of water, at a few fathoms
distance to the eastward of the vessel. At 7 p.m. it fell calm.
There is a current here setting to the westward at the rate of
about 1 K per hour. At 7.45 p.m. soundings, with the deep-sea
lead, gave us 18 fathoms: bottom, the same generally as those
obtained, in the afternoon, plus a greater proportion of
Foraminifera and some few specks of Titaniferous iron ore. A haze
all round the horizon at sunset. Nearly cloudless skies have been
registered during the past week. At 10 p.m. an easterly wind
sprung up of slowly increasing force, from 0.5 at the
commencement to 2.0 at midnight.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><span class="aa">Monday</span>,
21st March.</div>
<p>(36.)&mdash;The wind E.N.E. three 4.5 at daylight; but the
rate of sailing is extremely slow. The lee-way, caused chiefly by
tide to the westward, exceeding the distance made on our course.
At 9 a.m. went about, the wind having gone round to E. by N.; the
tide still gave us a lee-way of not less than 22 deg. towards the
west. At 10 a.m. in shoal water, green; the deep-sea lead gave us
bottom at 20 fathoms; siliceous saint, minute shells and
polythalamia. This bank is of very definite, shape, as determined
by the color of the water, together with soundings; it runs N.
and S. of an ovate shape, greater diameter 31 miles,&mdash;lesser
diameter 2 miles. At noon we were in longitude E. 118 deg. 48
min., mind latitude S. 19 deg. 23 min. At 1 p.m. we were sailing,
over another bank running N. and S. with two spits extending at
least 2 miles to the southward of the bank; soundings varying
from 20 to 16 fathoms.</p>
<p>(37.)&mdash;At 3 p.m. Bedout Island in sight: it appears to
have but little high land upon it; on the highest point, with the
aid of glasses, we can clearly discern a signal staff with some
large object on the top. To the westward two or three miles, but
probably ten or fifteen miles to the southward, that in, in the
direction of the larger of the two Turtle islands, a column of
smoke just visible.</p>
<p>(38.)&mdash;Beside the spit the chart prepares us to find on
the south-west side or the island, we observe a reel With
detached rocks extending 2 or 3 miles to the eastward. At a
distance of about 5 miles, to the north, we were in 10 fathoms
water; soundings, the same as those last taken, with the addition
of small water-worn quartz pebbles. At 5 p.m. we were to the S.W.
of Bedout Island, distant nearly 6 miles, with soundings varying
from 4, the shallowest, to 7 fathoms, the deepest. We cast anchor
a few minutes after sun-set in 6 fathoms at low water, with sand,
coral, shell and clay bottom. The easternmost point of the island
bears N. 4 deg. W.; the westernmost point N. 23 deg. 30 min. W.,
and our anchorage is distant about 3 miles. At nearly
mid-distance there is a reef, with water between it and the
island, of no great depth evidently, for (it is now low water) we
can see it to be perfectly motionless and with much floating
sea-weed.</p>
<p>(39.&mdash;Shortly alter coining to an anchor, a boat was
launched; Mr. Panter and myself, with four men, left the
vessel;&mdash;after pulling a mile and a half, we found the reef
to be under water and the flood tide coming in rapidly from the
westward. At one or two chains' distance from the reef we
grounded on a coral bottom. The four men then waded to the
northwards and found the whole distance, between our boat and the
island, a mile and a half, to be covered with water, from 6
inches to 3 feet in depth. As moonlight did not suffice to make
my notes of value, the party merely picked up such shells as came
in their way, (principally of the genera Trochus, Tridacna, and
Ostrea&mdash;the pearl oyster) and then returned to the vessel,
resolving to launch the long-boat in the early morning of the
morrow, and make a more accurate examination. The tide here runs,
at ¼ flood, at the rate of 4K per hour.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><span class="aa">Tuesday</span>,
22nd March.</div>
<p>(40.)&mdash;Breakfasting at 4 a.m. in readiness to go ashore
at daylight. The long boat being launched shortly before sunrise,
we (Mr. Panter and myself, with 13 of the party) pulled to the
reef. Here, having anchored the boat, we waded a distance of a
mile and a half through water, seldom above our knees; the flood
tide was just setting in when we reached the Island.</p>
<p>(41.)&mdash;On our walk from the boat through the shallow
water we observed many specimens of the Trepang, (Holothuria
edulis) of a jet-black color, from 18 to 21. inches in length,
and from one to two inches in diameter. This marine radiated
animal is very abundant on the north-west coast of Australia;
indeed, it is the chief attraction to the M day fishermen who
periodically visit these parts of Australia in order to supply
the Chinese markets with this gelatinous esculent. When properly
prepared, the Chinese pay a high price for the
Trepang,&mdash;using it as a principal ingredient in restorative
soups.</p>
<p>(42.)&mdash;Many fine specimens of Conchiferous Mollusca were
passed;&mdash;e.g. Tridacna, nearly 12 inches in length, of
greater value, in pearl seeking, in my opinion, on account of the
<i>size</i> of the pearls, when the shell is found to contain
one, than the oyster of 'Nickol' Bay. It is true the shell of the
Tridacna itself is of no great value, for it contains no nacreous
substance of commercial importance: But, if this fishery were
carried oil, the Tridacna gigas, might sometimes be met with.
Specimens have been obtained in the Indian Ocean, weighing 5
cwt., and measuring 2 feet 6 inches in length and 4 feet in
breadth. These are of value in; Europe: they are used as
benitiers in Continental Cathedrals, and have been purchased for
this purpose at an enormous price. We did not find any pearl
oysters of sufficient size to warrant more extended search.</p>
<p>(43.)&mdash;Having at length walked through the mile and a
half of shallow water, we passed over a few yards of beach,
composed of broken shells and coral, with little sand,&mdash;and
found a coarse but good grass, about 2 feet in height, growing in
large tufts, with here and there patches of the same kind of bean
as that found in Collier Bay (1863) but somewhat modified, by
increased latitude. Although the runners are not more than 10 or
15 yards in length, the bean seems to be as prolific as that of
the more northern latitude. The pods, too, are equal in length,
but the ripe seeds are much smaller. The beautiful green color of
the leaves formed a charming contrast with the less brilliant
tints of the grass and general vegetation.</p>
<p>(44.)&mdash;A new convolvulus, genus Ipomæa, was met with
growing most luxuriantly, though in a very dry sand; it was in
flower, but I could not obtain a single seed. The runners were of
a woody character, 40 yards in, length and rooted in the ground
at intervals one or two yards. The stem was of a brown color,
round and smooth, without downiness. The leaves were on long
foot-stalks, cordate, entire, and very smooth. There were a few
bushes of Grevilleæ, on which were found about 20 beetles, all of
the same species of the family Curculionidæ. A few scattered
plants of Marjoram (Origanum onites) were also seen;&mdash;as
whalers have for many years past visited these seas, this plant
may not be indigenous.</p>
<p>(45.)&mdash;Our first walk was to the signal staff seen
yesterday. On arriving the word DIG carved on the pole indicated
the spot, which, when the sand had been scratched away to the
depth of a foot or thereabout, yielded a bottle containing two
notes: one reads as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align:right; margin-right:10%;">July 23, 1863.</p>
<p style="margin-left:10%;">Sir,</p>
<p style="text-indent:15%;">There is a note buried in a bottle at

<p>We left the signal pole standing and buried the bottle again,
together with a note of which the following is a copy:&mdash;</p>
<p>The schooner "New Perseverance" anchored about 3 miles to the
south of this pole on the 21st March, 1864. The vessel is bound
to Camden Harbor on an exploring expedition. All well.</p>

<p>(46.)&mdash;This little matter accomplished, observations were
made to determine the position of the signal staff;
result&mdash;Long. E. 118 deg. 66 min. 20 sec., latitude S.19
deg. 40 min. 45 sec. This position differs from that given by
Norrie and the Admiralty charts, which also differ widely from
each other. As concerning the latitude, I have every reason to
believe it correct, as given above; but the longitude, although I
have taken the greatest care to ensure accuracy, may be a few
seconds in error. I believe the position assigned to Bedout
Island upon our charts to be derived from the French. At any rate
the track of the "Mermaid" does not seem to indicate a land
survey or observation. However, as nearly, but not quite all, the
surrounding reefs are coral, and as the shoals for many miles
round the island yield indications of coral bottom, it is not at
all Unlikely that the position of the land above high water mark,
may have undergone many modifications since the year 1818 when
the island seems to have been first included in the English
Charts.</p>
<p>(47.)&mdash;Vast flocks of Pelicans had selected Ice east and
west points of the Island for a colony. Here, at intervals of
about a yard, the ground was covered with nests: these are of the
simplest description&mdash;consisting of merely a few bits of dry
grass twisted in the form of a nest; in each pseudo-nest there
were generally two eggs, at this date in every stage of
incubation, from the newly-laid egg to the breaking of the shell;
some of the young pelicans were already shewing signs of their
future plumage. The parent pelicans, disturbed by the approach of
their visitors, flew away to a distance of about half a mile,
where they alighted on the water, in groups of twenty and thirty,
patiently awaiting our departure. The pelican is as graceful a
bird in its slow but majestic flight, as it is when sitting upon
then water. This species differs from the common pelican
(Pelecanus onocrotalus) in the following particulars an absence
of the light flesh or rose-color in the plumage; a white instead
of a bright-yellow pouch; the naked space round the eyes and at
the base of the bill, where the frontal feathers form a point,
white&mdash;not flesh-color; the upper mandible and terminal nail
white: instead of the former being bluish and the latter red; an
absence of the crimson line on the top of the upper mandible. The
points of similarity are as follow:&mdash;the first
quill-feathers, and spurious wings, black:&mdash;the irides
hazel:&mdash;feet livid. The young of these pelicans have a white
instead of an ash-colored plumage. The eggs are white and of
equal roundness at the two ends. This pelican colony does not
seem to be of recent establishment, as skeletons and bones long
exposed to atmospheric influence lie everywhere scattered. About
500 fresh eggs were collected and stored in basket's of nature's
providing; cup-shaped sponges, capable of holding from five to
six dozen, and carefully carried on board for use. The white of
the egg is of a gelatinous rather than albumenous character. When
boiled or roasted they are excellent additions to the table,
although the flavor, I must admit, is somewhat peculiar.</p>
<p>(48.)&mdash;Whilst taking a ramble round the eastern part of
the island the party found occupation in Turtle catching;
thirty-three were ultimately secured, all consisting of the
Edible or Green Turtle (Chelonia midas). They are small, the
largest not weighing more than 200lbs,; the average of the whole
number would be between 70 and 80 lbs.; although the shell of
this, from its extreme tenuity, is of small commercial value as
compared with that of the Chelonia imbricata, which I have
already seen in these seas, the flesh will be an acceptable
addition to our culinary resources. The lamellæ of the carapace
are of the normal number, thirteen dorsal and twenty-five
marginal segments. The plastron, of a tough-leathery nature,
offers but little resistance to a sharp knife.</p>
<p>(49.)&mdash;Snipe and quail were very plentiful; the former
were in excellent condition,&mdash;about twenty were brought off
from the island. Vast numbers of sea-birds were met with during
this walk: but as I carried no gun, no specimens were obtained. I
collected a splendid assortment of sponges, washed upon the beach
or blown amongst the grass: many species are new to me; only two
kinds appeared fit for common use, and both much inferior to the
sponge of southern European seas. But all I deem of great
interest as objects worthy of the scientific investigation of
those who devote their time to this particular family.</p>
<p>(50.)&mdash;Besides the shells already named, Tridacna and
Ostrea,&mdash;examples of the following genera were picked up:
Cardium, Chama, Pecten, Trochus, Venericardia, Cyproea, Janthina,
Parmophorus Australis, and Balinus.</p>
<p>(51.)&mdash;The island is about a mile in length and its
average breadth about half a mile. It appears to be formed as
islands are usually formed in the centre of circular coral reefs
or Atolls; it is merely a heap of coral sand piled up upon a
sandstone point of ancient elevation, whose dip is about 15 deg.
to the westward. This has gradually become clothed with soil
capable of supporting a coarse and stunted vegetation, and it may
hereafter, by the accumulated detritus of centuries, become
fitted for the abode of man. The rock forming the basis of the
island is a trappean sandstone composed of particles derived from
the decomposition of green-stones and basalts, consisting,
chiefly of feldspar and hornblende grains, devoid of external
crystalline form, with which are mingled quartzose grains and
mica flakes, derived from other sources. Or, it may be described
as a resultant of the abrasion and erosion of primitive rocks at
some long subsequent age, when they, together with their
associated strata, became exposed to tidal action. The interval
between the present island and the circular reef, being now only
6 or 7 feet below low water mark, will, doubtless, in time, form
an island of at least three miles diameter:&mdash;even although
this portion of the coast of Australia is undergoing submersion
in these our days. There was no water on the island.</p>
<p>(52.)&mdash;Towards noon the flood-tide although we have now
only just passed the time of neap tides, formed an uninterrupted
sheet of water between the island and the long boat. Our native
"Moke" and the sailor in charge of the boat, attempted to swim
off and bring the boat nearer so as to receive the captured
turtle and stores of eggs. But although they succeeded in
swimming to within a hundred yards of the boat, they were not
successful: for the force of the tide when they were outside the
reef, was such as to render the attempt hopeless. No alternative
remained but to return to the island,&mdash;and it is more than
probable that the sailor would have lost his life, but for the
strong arm of the native man swimming with him. After three hours
delay, that is, at ½ E. tide the whole party set off to the boat
wading through water now at times reaching above the waist. It
was a droll sight to see each man with his burden; some dragging
a turtle in each hand (one unwisely held the two fore paddles of
his captives, so that when revived by immersion in their native
element, he had the full benefit of proximity to their hawk-like
bills&mdash;whereby his garments suffered&mdash;and at the same
time he was afforded the pleasing experiment of comparing his
strength with the combined efforts of the two turtles struggling
for liberty);&mdash;others carried loads of pelicans'
eggs&mdash;but all arrived safely at the boat and schooner
lamenting no loss save unimportant pieces of epidermal and other
covering. The anchorage three miles to the south of Bedout
Island, in 6 fathoms at low water, is good. The tide today rose
24 feet, so that neap tides probably are about 20 feet. It was
high water at 10.50 a.m.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><span class=
"aa">Wednesday</span>, 23rd March.</div>
<p>(53.)&mdash;Soon after daylight, with a fair wind, the anchor
was weighed and we bade adieu to Bedout island. At noon we were
in long. E. 118 deg. 57.min. 15 sec. and lat. S. 19 deg. 36 min.
Towards 4 p.m., however, we had another sight of Bedout island,
just peeping above the horizon, at a distance of 6 miles. Our
unsought second view of the island is easily to be accounted
for:&mdash;whilst a wind from the E.S.E. has been apparently
propelling us at a rate of one or two knots per hour, a current
and tide from the N.N.E. has been moving bodily, since 10 or 11
a.m., at a greater rate in a direction contrary to what we
supposed; hence the unexpected reappearance of an island we had
left astern in the morning, on our whether bow in the
afternoon.</p>
<p>At 4 p.m. we had the advantage of both wind and tide, and from
that hour, throughout the night we sailed along slowly on our
course, with scarcely any appreciable motion.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><span class="aa">Thursday</span>,
24th March.</div>
<p>(54.)&mdash;A beautiful day&mdash;clear sky&mdash;favorable
wind&mdash;and tranquil sea. At noon our long. was E. 119 deg. 38
min. 45 sec. and lat. S. 18 deg. 51 min. These are days of
luxurious living; since our visit to Bedout island our table
displays Turtle-steaks and soup,&mdash;mysterious compounds built
on a foundation of pelicans' eggs&mdash;game (snipe)&mdash;fish,
fresh meat &amp;c., &amp;c. Several times during the day, little
land-birds have been busied among the sheep on deck turning over
the loose hay, without displaying the slightest sign of fear. Two
of the kingfisher tribe were perched upon the topgallant yard all
night.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><span class="aa">Friday</span>,
25th March.</div>
<p>(55.)&mdash;Very nearly calm at sunrise; then a gentle wind
from the south-east all the morning. At noon we were in long. E.
120 deg. 27 min. and lat. S. 18 deg. 27 min. A deep blue
cloudless sky all day and a calm sea. Solar radiation attained a
higher rate than heretofore; by 4 p.m. this afternoon, the
thermometer read 121, deg. at the maximum. Towards evening a
water snake (Hydrophes) was caught by "Moke," the native; it was
nearly 6 feet in. length&mdash;of a dull yellow color with light
brown diamond-shaped markings. It was too large in diameter to go
through the neck of my large bottles: it was therefore necessary
to cut off the head and preserve the skin; this latter was
damaged, so only portions of it were saved. Calm at sunset with a
copper-colored haze upon the western horizon. A steady breeze
from the south-west sprang up at 9 p.m.:&mdash;the sea being
quite still, the vessel glides through the water with a motion
barely perceptible.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><span class="aa">Saturday</span>,
26th March.</div>
<p>(56.)&mdash;After midnight the wind was very
variable;&mdash;towards morning it went round to the south-east
and remained steadily at force 3 for some hours. At noon we were
in long. E. 121 deg. 7 min. and lat. S. 18 deg, It was calm in
the afternoon for one or two hours. At sun-set a dense haze
settled all round the horizon. At night the stars were visible in
great numbers notwithstanding the hazy but cloudless sky. Several
sharks were captured during the calm: one was rather more than 7.
feet in length. At 11 p.m. it was calm again.</p>
<p>There was a lunar halo of 90 sec. radius at 9.30 p.m., about
an hour after the moon rose.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><span class="aa">Sunday</span>,
27th March.</div>
<p>(57.)&mdash;Easter-day. A fine 3 to 5 knot breeze from the
south-east, from shortly after midnight till 11 a.m. At sun-rise
a dense belt of Stratus stretched along the eastern horizon: it
appeared very low and the result of land evaporation. A little
while after, the sky became dotted over with very high and thin
cirro-cumulus and cirro-stratus. At noon our long. was E. 121
deg. 48 min. and lat. S. 17 deg. 21 min. 45 sec., Point Coulomb
bearing nearly east and distant 23 miles. The high summit, some
12 miles from the coast-line, between Cape Boileau and Point
Coulomb was first seen about 10 a.m.; smoke from three large
fires was also seen in the same direction; at night the glare
from these fires was distinctly seen. At 10.30 a.m. the morning
service was read: there were ten present&mdash;a slightly
increased number compared with the previous Sundays. The
land-breeze of the morning was quickly followed in the afternoon,
by a sea-breeze of equal three. Our course now lies midway
between Cape Baskerville and the Lacepede Isles, which we may
expect to see at daylight tomorrow. At 8.45 p.m. there being no
wind and the tide setting towards the coast, the anchor was cast
in 10 fathoms water, with sand and clay bottom.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><span class="aa">Monday</span>,
28th March.</div>
<p>(58.)&mdash;At 3.30 a.m. we hove anchor and sailed with a
favorable wind. At sunrise we were off Cape Baskerville. A dense,
mass of Cumulonus stretches across from the north-west to the
south-east points of the horizon, with out-lying detached cumuli,
flocculent and very low. The sun's place was not visible until it
had attained a greater altitude than 15 deg. At 8.30 a.m. we
sighted the Lacepede Isles and Sandy point, Dampier Land. A great
number of native fires visible along the shore, from which we are
distant about 6 miles, sailing on a course nearly parallel
thereto. At 11 a.m. we sighted Point Emeriau. At noon our
position was in long. E. 122 deg. 23 min. 30 sec. and lat. S. 16
deg. 50 sec.</p>
<p>(59.)&mdash;All the afternoon making but slow progress in
consequence of light and unfavorable wind; carried along by the
tide I noticed leaves of Eucalypti, Cajeputi and mangrove. This
evening we witnessed a marvellously beautiful sunset, dense
nimbus stretched from the west to the north-east, at an altitude
of 20 deg., the margin being besprinkled with small detached
cumuli of a deep purplish color; the whole, combined with
outlaying crimson and bright yellow banks of horizontal stratus,
formed a gorgeous mass of coloring&mdash;such as would have
delighted the eye of a Turner or a Danby, and composed the basis
of many an effect of dream-land to the punter or poet. This
sunset, from the yellow color predominating, presages wind,
according to Admiral FitzRoy.</p>
<p>(60.)&mdash;At sundown we had yet some 8 or 10 miles to sail
before, passing point Emeriau. The higher ranges of the peninsula
named Dampier Land, abreast of and to the southward of our
present position, are thickly wooded, though the trees appear by
no means large. The coast is indented with a succession of large
Bays; where the points project they may be described as rocky
cliffs of a dark-red color alternating with sand-hills composed
of the detritus of these cliffs&mdash;varying in color from
slightly tinged with red to sand of a deep red-ochreous hue, here
and there covered by patches of vegetation. The actual beach we
were not near enough to see, but the line of still-water of about
a mile in breadth, within the reef, which seems nearly continuous
the whole length of the peninsula, was again as clearly seen as
upon the occasion of my last voyage, in 1863. After dusk the
whole coast line was illuminated by native fires at a short
distance apart. The southern and middle part of Dampier Land,
judging by the number of native fires seen last year, as well as
at the present time, would lead one to suppose it to be thickly
peopled with native tribes:&mdash;and if so, then luxuriant
vegetation, at a very short distance, from the sea-coast line,
may be safely predicated. At any rate on our return from Camden
Harbor, as our track to Roebuck Bay must necessarily lie at no
great distance from the main, we propose, if possible, to land
there and make a journey, however short, in an eastern direction;
a direct course of only 14 or 15 miles would most likely take us
to the summit of the dividing range, whence we might expect a
view of the country lying between it and King's Sound. This
preliminary examination of the northern and middle portion of
Dampier Land I esteem of great importance, because our projected
exploration from the head of Roebuck Bay to the FitzRoy River and
the land marked "Provincia aurifera" on the old charts, will
solve, so far as I can see, one of the most important questions,
whose solution is expected by the projectors of the present
expedition. Vivid but distant lightning was seen on the north
horizon at 8 p.m.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><span class="aa">Tuesday</span>,
29th March.</div>
<p>(61.)&mdash;At dawn of day we were a few miles to the south of
the Latitude of Cape Lévêque the low sandy point south of Swan
Point being just visible above the horizon., At 10 a.m. we threw
overboard a sealed bottle, containing paper with the name,
position, and destination of the vessel. At 11 a.m. we sighted
the Twins; and other rocky islands off the entrance to King's
Sound. At noon, our longitude was E. 122 deg. 51 min. 30 sec. and
latitude S. 16 deg. 10 min. 20 sec.; Swan Point being distant 15
miles. During the afternoon we had heavy squall from the
eastward, the wind being from the same quarter and light. The sky
has been obscured nearly all day by dense and low Nimbus; showers
have been seen falling all round, but none have reached us. At
sunset we were steering a course about midway between Caffarelli
Island and the Brue Rock. Lightning on both the north and south
horizon at 6.30 p.m.</p>
<p>(62.)&mdash;At 8.25 p.m. a low dark line was seen across the
ship's course; it was at first thought to be a
tide-ripple;&mdash;the night was so intensely dark that until we
were a cable's length, or thereabout, the error was not
discovered. But at 8.30 p.m., only five minutes after the dark,
appearance became an object of anxious doubt&mdash;the mate, who
was in the bows, ordered the helm hard down, the master had just
before given the word for shortening sail When the land was
clearly made out, and in a few seconds the vessel struck, a
reef;&mdash;the blow, although of considerable force, was not
sufficient to give rise to a fear of any immediately fatal
result. After striking, the vessel at once I drifted into deep
water (25 fathoms). The pumps were instantly manned: they gave no
evidence of damage. In a quarter of an hour, after striking, the
anchor was let go with 60 fathoms of chain, in apparently, good
holding ground. The squalls increased so rapidly in force that a
second anchor, with 60 fathoms of cable, was let go, about half
an hour after the first. During the panic the master and crew
were perfectly self-possessed and energetic&mdash;their work
being accomplished quickly and properly, save when impeded by the
injudicious, but well-meant assistance of a few fear-stricken
amateurs. Towards 10 p.m., the anchors holding well, every one,
except the watch, sought his respective niche for the night.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><span class=
"aa">Wednesday</span>, 30th March.</div>
<p>(63.)&mdash;During the early morning, before day-light,
squalls of wind and rain-showers drove more than one deck-sleeper
from his couch. At 7 a.m., when sufficient light struggled
through the lead-colored cloud to afford us a view of the
horizon, we found ourselves about of a mile from the reef on
which we struck. This reef is not laid down upon the charts;
through the mist we Could recognise the outline of Caffarelli
about 5 or 6 miles distant. The reef, of a flattened horse-shoe
shape, extends, as far as we can see, towards the western point
of Caffarelli; and breakers can be traced for at least a mile
beyond the N.N.W. end of that portion of the reef visible at low
water. According to the charts there should be a passage of 14
miles here, between the Brue Rock and Caffarelli, with soundings
from 15 to 25 fathoms. At noon the S.S.E. wind attained a force
of not less than 8 during the squalls; it is a happy circumstance
that we happened to strike on the lee-side of the reef, for up to
the present time it has been a break: water for us; if the tide
which is now rising rapidly should wholly cover the reef, I fear
we shall have no alternative but to slip anchors and run before
the wind.</p>
<p>(64.)&mdash;Shortly after noon the rollers came over the reef;
at this time the wind had attained force 9, or a severe gale,
which combined with the strength of the flood-tide, caused the
vessel to receive the rollers broadside on. Now also the anchors
began to drag and the vessel to forge to the N.N.W., so that it
was feared we should barely escape the northerly termination of
the reef. The smaller of the two cables now parted, whereby we
lost the kedge anchor and 70 fathoms of chain. The starboard
anchor, weighing 12 cwt. with 60 fathoms of chain, dragged for
about 30 minutes, when just as preparations were made to
unshackle it and try what sails could do, it held; nor did the
most violent bursts of the gale again start it. The importance of
saving this anchor and cable is great; if we lose it, we shall
have only the best bower and cable remaining. It is worth while,
therefore, to hold on as long as possible, in order, if the gale
should abate, to recover these valuable adjuncts to our future
exploration.</p>
<p>(65.)&mdash;The gale seems to be passing from S. to N.; for 14
hours we had a S.S.E. wind, force 9: the gusts at intervals being
10. The ship labored greatly from half-flood to flood and ebb,
owing to the rollers, passing over the reef, meeting our tidal
position. The barometer fell rapidly to 29.700 inches at 3 p.m.
shortly after which time the gale was at its worst; at 4 p.m. it
commenced to rise very slowly but decidedly; the Aneroid about
.020 inch in advance of the metallic; with the exception of
trifling depressions for occasional squalls, the rise continued
till 4 a.m. of the 31st March, when it read 29.800 inches
indicating a speedy termination of our second difficulty at this
reef. This gale I think presages the breaking up of the N.E.
monsoons.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><span class="aa">Thursday</span>,
31st March.</div>
<p>(66.)&mdash;At dawn Of day the wind was abating and the sea
going down. At 11 30 a.m. we weighed anchor; it was the work of
an hour, with 19 men. When recovered it had lost its stock. A
S.S.E. wind, force 4, carried us clear of the reef, outside of
which we obtained good bearings of the following islands:
Caffarelli, Cleft, and Bathurst.</p>
<p>(67.)&mdash;Observations for position at 4 p.m., gave us our
longitude E. 123 deg, 14 min. 45 sec. and latitude S. 15 deg. 50
min. Outside the reef we expected a heavy sea: to our surprise we
had a light S.S.E. wind and quite smooth water. We were becalmed
from 6 to 8 p.m. After that a 4 knot breeze from the S.E. set in
which lasted until midnight. The meridian passage of [alpha]
crucis at 11.35 p.m. gave ours latitude S. 15 deg. 42 min.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><span class="aa">Friday</span>,
1st April.</div>
<p>(68.)&mdash;At 2 a.m. large banks of sea-weed floating from N.
to S., a strong odor of decaying sea-weed, and a suspected break
in the horizon, made the master again cast anchor in 16 fathoms.
At day-light we got under weigh again. Just a glimpse of "Beagle
Bank" was obtained, shortly after setting sail. At noon our
longitude was E. 123 deg. 46 min. 45 sec., and latitude, S. 15
deg. 13 min. At 4 p.m. we sighted and obtained bearings of "Red
Island," the "Champagny, Heywood, and Byam Martin groups, Battery
Point" south of Camden Sound, and the bluff on the main, east of
Point Hall. At 7.30 p.m. we cast anchor in 20 fathoms at about 24
miles from Battery Point. Shortly after sunset there was a
display of zodiacal light. The cone was not very clearly defined:
its apex was about 35 deg. in altitude.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><span class="aa">Saturday</span>,
2nd April.</div>
<p>(69.)&mdash;At day-light we found the vessel had dragged her
anchor towards the main for a distance of about 3 miles. At 6
a.m. weighed anchor and set sail with a perceptible breeze in our
favour, which soon afterwards died away to a calm. We obtained
good bearings of the islands in the middle of the day. At noon we
were in longitude E. 124 deg. 9 min. 15 sec., and latitude S. 15
deg. 30 min. A S.W. wind afterwards set in: its force, however,
previous to 4 p.m. rarely gave us a rate exceeding one or one and
a half knots per hour; after that time our speed increased so
that at 7 p.m., when we cast anchor, we were not more than 4 or 5
miles from the entrance to Brecknock Harbor. Our anchorage of
to-night is in 18 fathoms, with mud bottom.</p>
<p>There has been a great deal of refraction all day points of
the main have been lifted above the horizon, some time before we
have actually seen them.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><span class="aa">Sunday</span>,
3rd April.</div>
<p>(70.)&mdash;At sunrise got under sail again with a light but
favorable wind. When near the south passage into Brecknock
Harbor, I noticed several specimens of Phyllosoma, or
glass-crab,&mdash;a striking genus of transparent Crustacea,
belonging to the order Stomapoda, described by Grey as follows
"When it was taken out of the water, it stood upright on its
legs, and crawled a little like a large beetle, but soon died. In
the water it swam with the legs, the large joint of which
appeared to be feathered. It was not thicker than the thinnest
wafer; the back was marked with curved lines; and it shrank
instantly when touched. The species have a horny feel to the
touch, are destitute of smell, and look like a transparent scale
when they lie in your hand."</p>
<p>(71.)&mdash;A few minutes after 11 a.m. we had crept up to the
southern entrance with a light but favorable wind and a still
sea. Slate Island, Battery Point, and the coast-line between, may
be described as extremely rugged; pointed rocks, coarse grass,
tufts of bright green triodia, with stunted straggling bushes,
include all that is visible at a distance of a third of a mile
from the shore. The entrance is not quite half a mile in width,
but there is a depth of 15 fathoms at ¼ ebb, in mid-channel. Just
inside the entrance, near the southern shore, is a little rocky
patch with one upright block of dark red sand-stone, not less
than 14 or 15 feet in height. This I have named the pinnacle.</p>
<p>(72.)&mdash;The south bank is of a rocky precipitous
character, attaining an elevation of from 100 to 300 feet; the
base is of a dark red compact sand-stone with a dip to the
westward of 15 deg. The fracture is vertical. Above this stratum
lies a rock of the same character, but, by exposure, fractured in
cubical blocks of about a square yard and less, on the north
face, whose appearance reminds one of the ruined walls of the
giant's castle of fairy lore. From the fracture between the upper
stratum and the lower, in several places, streams of water poured
and dripped out, forming rills, flowing into the sea. The
vegetation near the entrance consists chiefly of Adansoniæ,
Eucalypti, Acaciæ, all stunted, together with coarse grass and
isolated tufts of green triodia.</p>
<p>(73.)&mdash;About a mile within the entrance, on the south
shore, a beautiful stream of water came foaming and fretting in
its rocky bed, here and there forming miniature cascades, or a
series of rapids, on its way to the Harbor. At 1.45 p.m., in 6
fathoms, shallow water seemed to extend from the southern end of
a sand-stone reef, whose tops are well above water for at least a
mile to the S.S.W. of Green Island, to a small mangrove island
about half a mile from the base of Mount Lookover: thus barring
our entrance into Camden Harbor, until careful soundings have
been obtained. The anchor, therefore, was cast in 5 fathoms, with
soft muddy bottom.</p>
<p>(74.)&mdash;At 2.30 p.m. the whale-boat, with the master and a
crew of 7 hands, left with a view to obtain the required
soundings. The dingy, shortly afterwards, with a party of four,
left to examine the reef itself. About 4 p.m. the boats returned.
The, reef does, extend across from island to island, having upon
it, at low water, a depth of about 1 fathom; we cannot,
therefore, sail directly eastward, into Camden Harbor; we must
lie here to and what water is on the bar at high tide. The second
boat-party report the presence of recent, drift upon the tops of
the reef, from which we may infer that it is covered at high
water. Some pretty pieces of coral were brought on board and a
plentiful supply of excellent oysters.</p>
<p>The evening service, together with the form of "thanksgiving
after a storm," were read at 6.30 p.m. Nine persons attended.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><span class="aa">Monday</span>,
4th April.</div>
<p>(75.)&mdash;At sun-rise Mr. Panter and myself (with the master
to take soundings) and a crew of 8 men, left the vessel to seek
first a passage from Brecknock into Camden Harbor; then, a
landing-place for the horses, a depôt near water, and a suitable
place for beaching the vessel (to ascertain whether she was
damaged by running on Treacherous Reef) together with a spot
suited to fill up with water (about 4000 gallons are required)
and obtain a supply of firewood.</p>
<p>(76.)&mdash;By noon all these questions were decided upon.
First of all, soundings were taken to the eastern side of Camden
Harbor, to the very mangrove belt; the harbor shoals by a
succession of steps, of about half a fathom each, from 8 fathoms
at the entrance to one fathom at the head, at high, water, neap
tides. Consequently, there is a tolerably compact mud bottom, the
vessel may be brought up nearly to the head, where I know there
are four fresh-water creeks, on two of which we camped in 1863. A
landing-place for the horses was also found: it is rather stony,
but there does not seem to be a better in the vicinity of the
northernmost of the creeks upon which we have decided to
establish our depôt. No better spot was found for beaching the
vessel than the sand-patch on the mangrove island near to which
we anchored on Sunday. At the depôt creek there is an abundance
of fresh water, the softest and purest man could desire;
firewood, too, is lying about in plentiful store.</p>
<p>(77.)&mdash;The hills, down to the line of high water mark,
are at this season of the year, covered with the most luxuriant
grass of an average height of from 2 to 6 feet, according to the
species. The same sort of rugged hills as prevail near Doubtful
Bay, obtain here; how Amongst such piles of loose stones so rich
a growth of grass can be supported, is a subject of wonder. The
geological formation, as at Doubtful Bay, consists of the upper
series of the Paleozoic epoch below the carboniferous period,
together with unstratified and eruptive intrusive rocks.</p>
<p>(78.)&mdash;On shore we found two dwarf species of Hybisceoe,
both new to me: they were in flower, but there was no seed. The
convolvulus, abrus precatorius, and many other plants were in
flower; some of last year's abrus pods, with ripe seeds were
picked off the tops of trees growing to a height of 20 feet,
close to the seashore. A few ripe black grapes were tasted and
pronounced excellent; they were found in small bunches, 20 to 40
in the bunch, of about the size of the black-cluster, and
approaching that grape in flavor. This is a cissus (order
Vitaceæ, tribe, Viteæ) entwining amongst shrubs. Many
sweet-smelling grasses and herbs were met with; among the former
the broad-leaved lemon-scented grass (Anatherum schoenanthus) was
the most plentiful. Six varieties of seeds and more than twice
that number of flowers were added to my collection. The trees
here are all more or less stunted: they are nearly all included
in the following orders: Malvaceæ, Myrtaceæ, Sterculiaceæ,
Leguminiferæ, and Palmæ.</p>
<p>(79.)&mdash;On the mangrove stems there were great quantities
of oysters, and many varieties of Turbinidæ had attached
themselves above the hole of high-water. A liberal supply of
oysters was taken on board ship; they formed another change in
our already varied dietary scale.</p>
<p>(80) At noon the vessel was moved to an anchorage close to the
spot chosen as a landing-place for the horses. By 4.30 p.m. the
five horses were safely landed, one slightly lame; the depôt and
travelling party quickly followed and encamped for the night.
When the horses were landed, the vessel was aground in 4 feet;
water, so that no difficulty was experienced; such horses as
pleased <i>walked</i> ashore.</p>

<h3><span class="aa">Land Explorations, From Camden
Harbor</span>.</h3>
<div style="text-align:center;"><span class="aa">Tuesday</span>,
5th April.</div>
<p>(81.)&mdash;At 2 a.m. there was a thunderstorm about 10 miles
to the northward: only a few drops of the rain reached us. At
sunrise we were under sail once more on our way to the
sand-patch. Resting the horses, shoeing where required, and
packing in readiness for a start tomorrow; the long-boat left the
vessel at noon with provisions and stores for the first land
trip, towards the Glenelg.</p>
<p>(82.)&mdash;The vessel grounded on the sandbank as the tide
receded at 3 p.m.; shortly afterwards several men were over the
side collecting corals all round the vessel; these corals I had
no time to examine as I was on the point of landing in Camden
Harbor,&mdash;but I recognised at a glance various species of the
genera Gorgonia and Pavonia of varied color and form,&mdash;some
branched others fan-shaped.</p>
<p>(83.)&mdash;Shortly after 4 p.m. Mr. Panter and myself left
the vessel en route to the Dépôt; at mid-distance we encountered
the south end of a thunder-storm travelling from east to west,
the wind at the time, what little there was of it, being from the
westward. A mass of water, resembling a dispersed waterspout,
crossed Brecknock Harbor near Rogers' Strait. The night passed
quietly over in the dépôt: there was no alarm save that caused by
a horse breaking away from his tether.</p>
<p>(84.)&mdash;The dépôt camp has a picturesque effect; it is
pitched on the side of a beautifully grassed hill, with a brook
of the purest water at its base winding its course into Camden
Harbor; the tents pitched&mdash;the horses feeding round
about&mdash;and the various groups collected here and there to
mature the plans of works proposed for to-morrow, form a whole
worthy the pencil of the painter. Camp 1 (Dépôt) long. E. 121
deg. 3 min. 52 sec. lat. S. 15 deg. 29 min. 45 sec., height above
the sea 15 feet.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><span class=
"aa">Wednesday</span>, 6th April.</div>
<p>(85.)&mdash;At 8.30 a.m. I left the dépôt camp, with Mr.
Panter, the mate of the vessel&mdash;an old gold-digger&mdash;and
one native, with four, horses and six days' rations. One
pack-horse sufficed to carry the provisions; the pack, weighing
90 lbs., was rather too heavy for one horse; 60 lbs. being as
much as a horse can travel with, for any length of time, in this
district:&mdash;but as our present journey is not expected to
occupy, more than five or six days, and as "Clown," the
pack-horse elect, is in the best possible condition, he will have
the honor on this occasion to be sole carrier of stores to the
party.</p>
<p>(86.)&mdash;Our destination to-day is Mount Double-Cone:
bearing from our dépôt E. 33 deg. S., and distant six miles. As
it is desirable to economise our horses' strength, instead of
making a direct course over very difficult stony hills, we
travelled round to the southern side of Camden Harbor, and then
by a succession of tolerably easy gravelly flats and gentle
rises, by a course of ten miles, reached the basin between the
two cones, after a march of four hours. All the country passed
over to-day is splendidly grassed, with sufficient shade for
sheep. The timber is light and of no great value except for
fencing and firewood. About 4 miles on our course, we fell in
with an enormous Baobab tree (Adansonia) with the drupe
containing ripe seed; it had no leaves but the buds seemed about
to burst out ere long. I am rather anxious to see the leaf of
this Baobab: last year, although we saw hundreds of the trees, we
found no leaf, fruit, or seed. The diameter of this tree was not
much under 50 feet; its height to the branches about 25 feet. The
general shape of the stein was cylindrical. We halted under this
tree some ten minutes; before leaving, we cut our initials and
the date on the bark. According to the table of M. Adanson, based
upon the proportionate growth of trees and the number. of zones
in some of their branches, this "old organic monument of our
planet," as Humboldt called the Baobab, was more than 5150 years
old when its diameter was little more than half of its present
measurement. Assuming this to be its last term of growth, and
setting aside the increasing ratio of age as compared with
diameter, this tree may be 8,000 years old: thus, by the

<p>This Adansonia I believe to be the A. Gregorii described in
"Flora australiensis" vol. 1, p.p. 222, 223, 1863; closely allied
to the African A. digitata; it is found on 'sandy plains and low
stony ridges, from the Glenelg to the western shores of Arnheim's
Land, and rarely; above 100 miles inland, <i>F. Mueller, G.
Bennet</i>, and others.', "the interior substance of the fruit
has an agreeable acidity, and boiled with sugar, is of material
service in scorbutic complaints. (See G. Bennet, 'Gatherings of a
Naturalist,' 292, t. 5.)"</p>
<p>(87.)&mdash;After camping the heat became extremely oppressive
for an hour or two: after that time we rambled about the western
cone collecting flowers, seeds, beetles, &amp;c. Due north of our
camp, there were the remains of an old native encampment with
upwards of two hundred fires: no relics were found except some
pieces of Greenstone of conchoidal fracture, broken thin so as to
use the flint-like edges for, sharpening spears,&mdash;and some
few small pieces of carboniferous limestone carried to the spot
no doubt for the purpose of making the white paint used in their
occasional personal decoration.</p>
<p>(88.)&mdash;A beautiful bronzed-wing pigeon was shot here
toward sunset. There was a great deal of lightning to the
eastward and northward in the evening. As there was no [native
fire seen near us, we did not deem it necessary to keep watch; so
after looking to the safety of the horses, we were soon fast
asleep upon our grassy bed. Camp 2. Long. E. 124 deg. 42 min.

<div style="text-align:center;"><span class="aa">Thursday</span>,
7th April.</div>
<p>(89.)&mdash;At dawn of clay, leaving the native in charge of
the camp, we started off to climb the eastern cone. The ascent
was not made without many a pause to take breath; for at: though
the height of the summit above our camp is only 705 feet (height
above mean sea level 850 feet) the sides are so precipitous, and
clothed with such high grass growing amongst loose stones, that
walking without a load is a matter of no slight toil; in our
case, that toil was increased by the weight of instruments, arms,
and the necessary appliances, each one had to carry. Before we
had taken many paces through the grass, we were wet through to
the waist, each blade of grass bending under its load of
dew-drops. This was not, however, a source of discomfort: for the
sun soon shone with dazzling splendor through a cloudless sky,
causing such an amount of evaporation from our drenched clothes,
as to lower the temperature of our bodies a few degrees.</p>
<p>(90.)&mdash;Arrived at the top we were rewarded with a
magnificent view of the country away to the eastward as far as
Mount Lyell, with the Glenelg stretching towards Mount King in
reaches here and there visible, and thence over the country to
the westward: all of which, at this, the spring time of the year,
is splendidly clad in verdure. The country drained by the
Gairdner likewise appears of surpassing richness.</p>
<p>(91.)&mdash;After taking various angles to verify my
triangulation of last year, we rested a little while and then
commenced our descent in a north-west direction. I also obtained
bearings of rocky island in Broad Reach, Glenelg River, near
which point I first sighted. Mount Double-Cone, in the <i>Flying
Foam</i>, 1863.</p>
<p>(92.)&mdash;Several ferns, flowers, and seeds, rewarded our
journey both going up and coming down the eastern cone. On the
west and north-west sides we found Liroconite and many
indications of a copper lode; the specimens I preserve for future
examination; as regards Liroconite there can be no doubt; I
recognise it by its crystalline form; but as to every blue or
green stain upon the various pieces of sandstone, quartz,
&amp;c., picked up being indicative of copper I have grave
doubts; sulphates of iron have been more than once mistaken for
carbonates of copper. The presence of the metal, however, is
positively indicated by the finding of Liroconite.</p>
<p>(93.)&mdash;We returned to camp at 9 a.m.; the solar-radiation
thermometer reading at that hour 127.5 deg. although the
thermometer in shade only stood at 80.2 deg.</p>
<p>(94.)We resumed our journey at 1 p.m. As our object was the
discovery of an easy rather than a direct route for the horses,
our course was anything but straight. The first two miles were
through well-grassed flats and gentle rises, with a gravelly
soil. We then crossed two creeks; the first takes its rise
northwards of Camp 2; the second, the larger of the two, winds
round the eastern base of Mount Double-Cone, in a southerly
direction, and, after receiving the first creek, flows into the
River Gairdner. This second stream we named Dunedale Creek; in
both the water is beautifully pure: crossing places are numerous
and good, for the beds of both are either pebbly or rocky.</p>
<p>(95.)&mdash;After crossing Dunedale Creek the first time, a
series of rich alluvial flats, the soil of a black
color,&mdash;basaltic detritus predominating,&mdash;brought us by
a line of travelling exceeding four miles, to a chocolate soil on
a flat through which Dunedale Creek again flows. On the right
bank we rested a few minutes; although we have made only six
miles of distance, yet fatigue is beginning to make itself felt;
travelling, as we have done this afternoon, over easy ground, the
length and close growth of the grass is such as to greatly retard
our progress and shorten our marches. Whilst resting, we found an
exquisite yellow Hybiscus growing to a height of ten feet. A
guana, 5 feet in length, was shot just before making Dunedale
Creek the second time. Resuming our route at 6 p.m., we soon
afterwards selected a camping place for the night, two miles S.
12 deg. W. of Camp No. 2; the accomplishing of these two miles
has cost us ten miles of travelling. Here for the first time we
sustained a vigorous attack from those murderers of sleep,
mosquitoes. Numerous and brilliant fire-flies (Elaters resembling
in color and size the Pyrophorus noctilucus) glittered amongst
the dark foliage of the trees and shrubs. Camp 3. Long. E. 124

<div style="text-align:center;"><span class="aa">Friday</span>,
8th April.</div>
<p>(96.)&mdash;In the morning our start was delayed until 7 a.m.
by the straying of "Tommy," one of the horses. The search for him
was not by any means an agreeable occupation; half a dozen steps
in the long grass, so liberally bedewed, sufficed to wet us
through to the waist. On leaving camp, we travelled first over a
mile and a half of flats of rich alluvium, with dense coarse
vegetation. Then crossing a narrow belt of sandy loam and bearing
away a little easterly we skirted a low white sandstone ridge,
running nearly north and south. This ridge has no soil except
between the crevices of the blocks of stone: and so, contrasted
with the fertility of the flats on either side, appears desolate
enough. The stones lie in some places horizontal&mdash;here and
there intersected by belts quite vertical; at other spots
cuboidal masses lie piled one on the other to a height of 15 or
20 feet. Yet, notwithstanding the apparent want of space for the
development of any large tree, the Baobab (Adansonia) occurs
everywhere, of gigantic girth and ever varying shape: at one time
cylindrical, either with single or with twin stems, at other
times spheroidal more or less oblate; one very flattened stem I
estimated to have its vertical only one fourth the amount of its
horizontal section. Here we found many in full leaf and with
seed: for the scarcity of the latter I can now in part account;
one being injured by its fall from the branch, we opened: it
contained 77 seeds, each larger than a French bean, and
separately imbedded in a very tough pulp;&mdash;they have a most
pleasant taste, not much unlike a green filbert;&mdash;as the
aborigines of this district are: in no mean degree epicures, if I
may judge by the remains of their feast on Turtle Island,
observed last year, the seed of the Baobab can scarcely have
escaped their notice; but even if: it did, in a country teeming
with life as this does, animals, birds, or insects would not fail
to devour so sweet-tasted a gift of nature.</p>
<p>(97.)&mdash;Where the interstices of the ridges were very
narrow,&mdash;spinifex, the convolvulus, the pea abrus, or even
tufts of the coarser grasses found room to grow and flourish.
About a mile to the north of our 4th camp we passed a track where
there were traces of a recent hurricane; all the trees being
uprooted and lying in a line from S.E. to N.W. This, from the
state of the leaves upon the fallen trees, I should suppose to
have occurred about ten days since; it was in all probability,
the same hurricane we experienced on the 30th ultimo, the day
after we struck on the reef.</p>
<p>(98.)&mdash;Even travelling on the ridges, although our
progress was slow, I could not describe as difficult; we marched
along, leading our horses at a steady rate of 2½ miles per hour;
but making only 2 miles of actual course by 10 a.m., when our
progress was stopped by a tributary of the Gairdner, flowing in a
rocky bed from west to east. As it was now getting very warm, we
camped; there was fine grass all over the flat; by spending the
middle of the day here we may find some easy ford for the horses:
at the spot were we first struck the water, the south bank was
steep and covered with mangroves. This our 4th Camp bears N. 10
deg. E. from Mount King and is distant a little more than 2
miles.</p>
<p>(99.)&mdash;During the morning's walk a kangaroo similar to
the one captured in this district last year, but unnamed at
present, a beautiful little dove, and a magpie, were shot. After
tethering out the horses we walked down to the river; in a shakes
pool by the side of the river there was a large fish of the
family of the Percidæ; we caught it&mdash;it weighed about 3
lbs.&mdash;and at dinner we pronounced it excellent, Today's
journey has brought many additions to our collection of plants,
flowers, and seeds.</p>
<p>(100.)&mdash;In the afternoon a thunder-storm passed over from
the eastward, whilst the lower stratum of wind was from the
westward. It divided, one part settling over Mount King and the
other northwards, towards Camden Harbor. We did our best to
secure the stores and instruments, but owing to the division of
the storm, we had not more than a half an hour's rain and that
fell not so heavily as to more than inconvenience us.</p>
<p>(101.)&mdash;At 3.30 p.m. we walked down to the river again.
But in the interval the tide had risen ten feet and it now
presented itself as a placid stream of more than 50 yards in
breadth. The river bed is about 30 yards in breadth and rocky. At
low water, there are rapids, falls of one or two feet, and deep
still pools. This bed is fringed by a narrow belt of small
mangroves, outside of which, on either side, there is a series of
pools of about ten yards in breadth, bounded by another mangrove
belt; but we can see abundant traces of the rainy season, at a
distance of at least 200 yards from the actual river-bed.</p>
<p>(102.)&mdash;The river positively swarms with fish; two were
caught in a few minutes with a piece of cooked kangaroo for bait.
Bait failing us some small fish were shot; but before we could
get them, a larger fish, not less than two feet in length, made
his appearance and swallowed those floating, with the voracity of
a pike. The fish I could recognise belonged to the family
Salmonidæ, and to the genera Mullus and Cyprinus. We propose to
name this stream "Fish River" and the flats on the northern bank
where we are encamped "Mosquito Flats," the latter is, by our
experience, a most appropriate name. I made a good collection of
interesting geological specimens from the north bank. Camp 4.

<div style="text-align:center;"><span class="aa">Saturday</span>,
9th April.</div>
<p>(103.)&mdash;This morning it was high water in Fish River at 5
a.m. We resolved to rest the horses to-day and make a walking
trip to the top of Mount King. Accordingly, we left camp at 6.30
a.m. Leaving our direct course a little to the westward, we
followed up the stony ridge, on the southern side of the Fish
River, that leads to the base of the Mount, only quitting it when
a most fertile and level tract offered an easier road. This
crossed, we effected our toilsome journey by half-past 8
o'clock.</p>
<p>(104.)&mdash;From the top we ascended, we had a magnificent
view of the country to the west, north, and east. Our view was
bounded to the westward by the seaboard Ranges; thence to
Brecknock Harbor, Augustus Island, and the MacDonald Ranges to
the north,&mdash;whilst eastward, Mount Lyell, conspicuous above
all from its beautiful conical outline, and the dividing ranges
between the Prince Regent's River and the Glenelg, were included
within our horizon. At our feet, displayed as on a man, lay that
portion of the Glenelg district drained by the Gairdner and, its
many tributaries. The flats between the rugged hills, the
Gairdner, and the line of swamps outside the mangrove belts
fringing the Glenelg, being flooded, presented a vast sheet of
water, with a few hill-tops appearing above the water like so
many islands. Into these swamps the Gairdner and the Fish River
flow, thence by the Glenelg and George Water into the sea. The
same fertility, vegetation, and light timber characterise this
Mount and the country around it, as already described of the
country passed over yesterday. On our way to the top we noticed
three species of Hybisceæ, somewhat dwarfed owing to the
increased altitude; on the top itself, where there was a rich
brown soil, a tangled mass of creepers and vines made walking
exceedingly difficult. The height of this summit above mean sea
level is 900 feet. The temperature at 9 a.m. in the shade was 88
deg.</p>
<p>(105.)&mdash;To the westward, ½ of a mile distant, there is
another peak 50 feet higher than that we first made. This we now
climbed; from it we obtained an excellent view of the northern
part of George Water and the course of the Glenelg as far as our
dépôt camp of last year. The tangled mass on this summit was even
more dense than that of the first; our progress here may be
properly described as creeping rather than walking. The abrus,
convolvulus, and many leguminosæ form the
undergrowth,&mdash;whilst stunted pines, acacieæ, and eucalypti
include the principal trees. The whole mount is now covered with
the richest grass.</p>
<p>(106.)&mdash;Geologically, this is not an interesting Mount,
being one of circumdenudation composed almost entirely of red
sand-stone, so far as we can see, from out-cropping precipices
and fragments, devoid, at any rate, of large fossils. Whilst on
the summit, we heard a rumbling noise, apparently within the
mount (at 9.25 a.m.) like the subterranean noise so often heard
in countries within a narrow zone of the earthquake lines. The
mate of the <i>Perseverance</i>, who was with us, has travelled
in New Zealand; without any enquiry on my part, at once, on
hearing the noise, he exclaimed, "that is like a New Zealand
rumbling." Whether this noise were really of subterranean origin
or not, I cannot confidently assert:&mdash;this part of the coast
of Australia, however, does lie within the limits of the
terrestrial movements, and evidences of not remote activity are
not wanting in this vicinity. I noticed at the time there was a
perfect calm and a cloudless sky.&mdash;(Having taken a series of
angles, the descent was commenced at 10.30 a.m.)</p>
<p>(107.)&mdash;Although I describe the whole of the country
passed over as luxuriant, still the vegetation between the base
of Mount King and Fish River, except the grasses and adansoniæ,
is slightly less so than northwards towards Camden Harbor. The
flats, on our homeward route, to the westward of the white
sandstone ridge, are rather of a sandy nature, owing to the
disintegration of the white sandstone; but now and then we met
with tracts of the same soils as those already described.</p>
<p>(108.)&mdash;All the hills to seaward, that is, to the
westward of our course, seem of the same general character as
those between Mount Lyell and Camden Harbor. In short, all this
district westward of the dividing range between the Glenelg and
the Prince Regent's River, I consider well adapted to the
purposes of the sheep-farmer; but the country is neither fitted
for cattle nor horses, except they be paddock-fed; the
former&mdash;cattle&mdash;could not be mustered, after they had
left the plains, owing to the difficult nature of the hilly
ground; the latter horses&mdash;as any one accustomed to the
breeding of horses will perceive at a glance, would not thrive
here because of the stony ridges, so productive of splints.</p>
<p>(109.)&mdash;There is no deficiency of the best materials for
road-making, but the amount of skilled and unskilled labor
requisite will be great. Materials for bridge-making and building
materials of every kind abound. Some of the flats would grow rice
and similar grain; other spots I think suited to the cultivation
of spices, sugar, tea, coffee, and even corn at high altitudes.
We returned to camp at 1.15 p.m. thoroughly fatigued with our
morning's walk under an almost cloudless sky: the thermometer in
the shade reading 88 deg.; the solar radiation thermometer, 135
deg. There has been a thunderstorm every afternoon since we
landed; this one came from the east, whilst an under current of
wind and scud was coming over from the west. The two winds
struggled for the mastery immediately over our camp dispersing
the storm south of Mount King and north of Camden Harbor, between
which places no rain fell, but beyond these limits, there must
have been a down-pouring rain. Ducks, cranes, and the most
brilliant colored parrots fly over our tent frequently: but, as a
rule, beyond the range of our guns.</p>
<p>(110.)&mdash;From the force of habit, we suppose when it is
dark we are to go to sleep; two hindrances in the shape of
mosquitoes and sand-flies, however, give us occupation, from the
moment we lie down until the time arrives when human endurance
can bear the torture no longer; this period varies from ten
minutes to an hour. By the united effect of four pipesful of
tobacco vigorously puffed away, our little pests retreat: but
only to renew the attack, tobacco-odor subsiding. And so the long
night is passed in an atmosphere teeming alternately with
tobacco-smoke and mosquitoes.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><span class="aa">Sunday</span>,
10th April.</div>
<p>(111.)&mdash;At sunrise we bade adieu to Mosquito
Flat,&mdash;travelling westward for a mile up the flat on the
north bank of Fish River. We then made a succession of richly
grassed flats directly on our course; for the first five miles
the soil was black, it then changed to a chocolate-color with an
occasional sandy patch. We re-crossed Fish River at one and a
half miles and Dunedale Creek at three miles on our course. All
along our route the flats were lightly timbered with eucalypti,
acacieæ, palms&mdash;and baobabs everywhere. We camped at 1 p.m.
on a stream running into Camden Harbor, not more than two miles
from our Dépôt, but with too rugged a series of little hills
between our camp and the Dépôt, to undertake at the end of a good
day's journey.</p>
<p>(112.)&mdash;More seed of the baobab was procured on our way.
Two new coleoptera were captured;&mdash;a snipe, a pheasant,
closely allied to if not identical with the "Megapodius tumulus"
of Port Essington, and several red and grey kangaroo, were either
shot or seen. Many additions too were made to the botanical and
geological collections. At 5 p.m. the daily thunderstorm
gathered, to the southward this time, so that we escaped without
a drop of rain once more. The night was very warm: little sleep
was obtained by any one, by reason of our old enemies, the
mosquitoes and sand-flies. Camp 5, Long. E. 124 deg. 40 min. 27
sec., Lat. S. 15 deg. 30 min. 32 sec. Height above the sea 100
feet.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><span class="aa">Monday</span>,
11th April.</div>
<p>(113.)&mdash;We left our camp at 6 a.m., and after a laborious
walk, both to men and horses, reached the dépôt at 7.30 a.m., by
a circuitous route of nearly three miles. During our absence
those left in dépôt have been travelling in the neighbourhood,
encountering all kinds of minor disagreeables and difficulties
incident to the bush of unknown shores.</p>
<p>(114.)&mdash;In the course of the morning we returned to the
schooner, for the purpose of storing away collections and making
arrangements for our departure from Brecknock Harbor. In the
afternoon whilst the sails were hanging loosened, a breeze from
the westward caused the vessel to drag her anchor; more chain was
payed out and she was brought up, but in such shallow water that
the ebbing tide left us high and dry upon a rocky spit at
sun-down. Whilst we were in the bush, the vessel was laid twice
upon a sand-bank, but she leaks now more than before. It was low
water at 8.5 p.m.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><span class="aa">Tuesday</span>,
12th April.</div>
<p>(115.)&mdash;At 2 a.m. the tide took us off the rocks and sail
was made to a spot a little north of mid-channel in 7½ fathoms of
water (8 fathoms at springs, H.W.) At 9 a.m. under sail to the
sand bank once more, with the hope of discovering and stopping
the leak which now alone detains us. Neap tides coming on, it was
some time after sunset before the water was low enough to get
over the side to commence the search; when, however, a few feet
of the keel was laid bare, off set all those engaged upon the
work with a motley collection of impromptu lamps, tools, and
implements of curious device to those ignorant of the
ship-building art. At a few minutes before 9 p.m., the advancing
tide put a stop to the work in a summary manner: nor can it by
any possibility be resumed until to-morrow. Much good I fear has
not been done; the entire keel was at no time above the
water.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><span class=
"aa">Wednesday</span>, 13th April.</div>
<p>(116.)&mdash;At 2 a.m. the vessel was hauled three fathoms
further up the sand-bank. This morning's tide disappointed us
even more than that of last night; less of the keel was exposed
and less time to discover the leak was afforded. As the said leak
is rapidly increasing each time the vessel is beached, the master
is about to try another plan. The vessel was sailed once more
into mid-channel, at high water, and anchored in 7½ fathoms. On
our sounding the pump we found two feet of water in the hold. For
50 minutes the pumps were kept at work; this reduced the water at
5.15 p.m. to 10¾ inches, but one hour afterwards it had increased
to 13½ inches. At 8 p.m. the sounding rod gave 16 inches, or at
the rate of 1½ inches per hour. To-day the party has been broken
up into three divisions; one filling up the casks with fresh
water, a second preparing firewood, and a third bringing the
horses to a spot on the peninsula more convenient for
re-shipment.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><span class="aa">Thursday</span>,
14th April.</div>
<p>(117)&mdash;This morning at 6 a.m. the vessel was pumped out
and baled quite dry, and a thorough search made from the inside;
but beyond the belief that the leak is not in the fore part of
the ship, it has been labor lost. She must be put ashore again;
this time the master has selected a flat shingle beach not far
from the base of Mount Lookover. At 2 p.m. we essayed to get
there, but a contrary wind prevented us.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><span class="aa">Friday</span>,
15th April.</div>
<p>(118.)&mdash;At 4 a.m. Mr. Panter and a crew of seven men left
the vessel in the whale-boat, to visit the islands westward of
Brecknock Harbor. The schooner was moved, during a favorable
wind, to the spot selected for the examination of the bottom: we
hope to be more successful now in finding the leak. It was high
tide at 5 p.m.; about an hour afterwards the vessel was once more
aground, the tide ebbing slowly. At 11 p.m. the flood tide set in
without having given an opportunity to walk round the hull: this
I attributed to a N.W. wind having kept back the water within the
harbor.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><span class="aa">Saturday</span>,
16th April.</div>
<p>(119.)&mdash;There was a fine display of zodiacal light in the
early morning. The tide to-day neither rose nor fell so much as
we expected; for this reason we are still in the same state of
ignorance as to the position of the leak. The ground selected
seems so favorable from its hardness and level, that, although we
regret the loss of time, we see not how we can expedite matters
by moving. Here, therefore, we must remain, moored by the stern
to an old mangrove, and our anchor far away in deeper water,
until a low tide enable the search on the outside to be
completed.</p>
<p>(120.)&mdash;To-day two specimens of the genus gelasimus, or
large-clawed calling land-crab, were brought on board. This seems
to be their season for spawning, for they have left the hills and
are now to be found in great numbers on the sea-shore where they
have made burrows in the sand for the purpose of depositing their
eggs. In making these burrows they bring up to the surface a
quantity of sand with the left or larger claw; then by a jerk
they scatter the sand to a distance of eight inches from the
hole, taking care to vary the direction of the excavated sand, so
as to ensure an equal accumulation all round the hole. The left
claw of one specimen is of greater length than the entire body
and legs, measured in the line of greatest extent. The rapidity
with which they run, in any direction, or with any part of their
bodies foremost, is such as to render their capture rather
difficult; the more especially since the distance they are seen
from their burrows is but a few feet at the most; and their
vigilance is such that they regain their holes, at the first
alarm, almost as quickly as the sight can follow them. The surest
method of catching them is to sit down near the hole and wait
patiently until the creature comes, to the surface, if it be
already within the burrow,&mdash;or, if it be abroad, to
intercept its return. They are of various colors: the two
specimens I now have are of a bright vermilion tint, but some
have been seen here of a dark rich-purple hue. Species of this
genus, found in other parts of the world, are said to be
excellent food; but of this I cannot judge in the present case
unless I obtain many more specimens; the two I now have, I
reserve for future anatomical examination.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><span class="aa">Sunday</span>,
17th April.</div>
<p>(121.)&mdash;The tides are beginning to be more favorable to
the repairs of the vessel. This afternoon's tide left her dry to
about half her length: to-morrow we hope she will be quite dry. I
had no one with me at the usual time of reading the morning
service: all who have hitherto attended were either absent from
the vessel or engaged on necessary work.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><span class="aa">Monday</span>,
18th April.</div>
<p>(122.)&mdash;At 2 a.m. the ebb tide left the schooner dry all
but some 10 or 12 feet of her length. At 3 p.m. we were enabled
to walk round the bows. We now see the injury done by running on
Treacherous Reef: it is trifling; only a few inches have been
broken away of what I believe is technically called "the gripe,"
but what the uninitiated might describe as the point of junction
between the cut-water and the keel. This has nothing to do with
the leak; this weak spot it now appears is not on the larboard
side. The tide of to-morrow will set the question at rest; for
during the interval of the low tides, the vessel will be listed
over contrariwise, so as to complete the circuit of the
examination. It was low water at 3.30 p.m.</p>
<p>(123.)&mdash;The whale-boat which has been absent now four
days returned at 4 p.m. A thorough examination has been made of
the four groups of islands westward of Brecknock Harbor. All the
islands may be described as rugged in the extreme, but well
watered and tolerably well wooded, with abundance of grass. On
one of Heywood's Group, there, were some natives, but they would
not show themselves. Two turtle's nests were found: one yielded
sixty and the other sixty-two most delicious eggs. Another
pheasant was shot there; these birds are more numerous on the
islands than on the main. A very remarkable tree, whose genus has
yet to be determined, was observed on Byam Martin's island.</p>
<p>(124.)&mdash;A fine slab of horizontal white sandy shale,
shewing water ripple, was brought back; it is formed of a
succession of rippled surfaces one under the other, a space not
exceeding half an inch apart vertically. The distance from crest
to crest of the ridges is on an average 1.5 inches, with a depth
of the hollows between them of 0.3 of an inch. It is worthy of
note that this ripple-marked shale was found on a little island
between Byam Martin's and Augustus islands, that is, in a
locality where to this day a tide ripple of unusual force is
found nearly every day: an evidence tending to strengthen the
conclusion that the force, velocity, and mode of action of the
tidal waters in this locality, were precisely the same in the old
geological period, when these deposits were consolidated, as at
the present time. The bean grows on all the islands. Yesterday
about a bushel were cooked for dinner, and pronounced good by
every one.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><span class="aa">Tuesday</span>,
19th April.</div>
<p>(125.)&mdash;At 4 a.m. the vessel was again dry: the repairs
of the starboard side were carried on so long as the tide would
allow. The work was resumed in the afternoon: several small leaks
were discovered and stopped.</p>
<p>(126.)&mdash;In the afternoon I climbed Mount Lookover: this
hill will yield to none in the district for ruggedness and
steepness. Although not more than 650 feet in height, the ascent
is as fatiguing as that of Mount King. It is another instance of
old red sandstone, of a conical outline, broken only by
precipices. Here and there are thin quartz veins, non-meridional,
and boulders with minute irregular contortions of great beauty;
the anticlinals and synclinals have for the most part exceedingly
short axes, consisting in some cases of points only, from or
towards which the various deposited strata have a quâ quâ versal
dip or inclination on all sides. All over the mount I find masses
of sandstone and quartz some enclosing bands of specular iron
ore&mdash;others having their cavities filled with a highly
crystalline iron, resultants either of a chemical precipitate or
a mechanical sediment.</p>
<p>(127.)&mdash;On the summit I obtained an extensive and
charming view, eastward as far as Mount Lyell and south ward to
Mount King. Brecknock Harbor with its beautiful bays and islands
formed a picture that years will not efface from my memory. For
two hours I was engaged in taking a series of angles and a
complete outline of the harbor in which we are now lying, as well
as the inner or Camden Harbor. From what I could see of Rogers'
Strait, I do not think there is a passage for vessels, except at
high water; for I could see two reefs stretching across with
their black rocky tops projecting several feet above the
water.</p>
<p>(128.)&mdash;Around the north and east base of Mount Lookover
there is a dense thicket or jungle of vines and creepers,
difficult to pass through, and swarming with the green ant; I
contrived to get some hundreds upon me coming down the mount;
these ants are most provoking little creatures,&mdash;their bite
is not very severe and it has no after painful effect, but when
climbing a hill with both hands full and many straps round the
neck-each strap supporting an instrument, these insects are
decidedly 'de trop.'</p>
<p>(129.)&mdash;Pausing to rest I used my geological hammers with
success; two stones yielded fossil plants, which, after securing,
I scarcely looked at, as the means of identification are not
within my reach; a glance, however, suffices to assign to them a
place very low in the scale of vegetation. Other stones enclosed,
or were interstratified with, iron pyrites; in two other
instances of stones picked up upon the beach, minerals of the
copper series were found, remolinite and bornite.</p>
<p>(130.)&mdash;To-day the party camped at the base of Mount
Lookover shot a turkey, (Otis Australasianus), several pigeons,
doves, and a curlew. I could see a great number of native fires
between Mount King and the Glenelg. There is a stream of
beautiful water at the eastern base of the Mount.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><span class=
"aa">Wednesday</span>, 20th April.</div>
<p>(131.)&mdash;Further progress was made to-day, at low water,
in the repairing of the hull of the vessel; it is hoped now that
our damages will be all made good in two tides more. This, so
far, is satisfactory: we are all tired of remaining so long in
forced inactivity.</p>
<p>(132.)&mdash;To-day I obtained several specimens of another
calling crab, of the genus Gelasimus; its shell is beautifully
variegated&mdash;a rich sepia-brown color predominating; it is
smaller than the first kind seen. I have now captured many
specimens of the rare Lepidosiren, a genus placed by some
naturalists amongst the Fish, by others included in the Amphibia,
called popularly on our first visit to the Glenelg, "the walking"
or "mud fish." This is another species of the genus found on the
Glenelg banks: but the two resemble each other closely in many
particulars. The mode of progress on the mud is by a series of
leaps performed by the action of the pseudo-ventral fins and the
tail: these fins are peculiarly adapted to this kind of motion;
they are inserted immediately beneath the true pectoral fins and
have a motion from below upwards of 90 deg. in arc, from the
vertical to the horizontal, in a line with the tail. The motion
is very rapid whether leaping on the shore or on the surface of
water. They seem to be of a warlike disposition: their battles
during the day are numerous but productive of few calamities. The
challenge&mdash;the combat&mdash;and the retreat, or
disappearance into the mud, is but the work of a few seconds. The
genus may be recognized, among other ways, by the presence of
Osteo-dentine, the second modification of fundamental tissue of
the tooth, where the cellular basis is arranged in concentric
layers around the vascular canals, and containing radiated cells
like those of osseous tissue.</p>
<p>(133.)&mdash;Shells of the following genera were this day
added to my collection: one species of Neritoides and three
Trochi;&mdash;of the latter, one is mammillated, with bright pink
stripes,&mdash;another is spinous, to a less degree only than
"Trochus imperialis."</p>
<p>(134.)&mdash;Further repairs were made to the vessel this
afternoon at low-water; it is proposed to take her off into
mid-channel at high tide to-night, and try if the leaks be
sufficiently stopped to warrant our departure. It is found that
the vessel strains herself more and more each time she is put
upon the hard ground this is not much to be wondered at, as it is
supposed she has, including the ballast and water, not less than
70 tons weight on board even now. One sheet of copper was torn
across to-day by the overhanging weight of the bows. At 9 p.m.,
the flood tide serving, the vessel was towed by the whale boat to
mid-channel, off the entrance to Camden Harbor; we anchored at 11
p.m. in 7½ fathoms at nearly high tide.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><span class="aa">Thursday</span>,
21st April.</div>
<p>(135.)&mdash;It was low water at 6 a.m. Off the mouth of
Camden Harbor, it is high tide, at full and change, at noon; rise
at springs 30 feet, neap tides about 12 feet. The ship's leaks
have now been so far stopped that during the last six hours she
has made only ¾ of an inch of water.</p>
<p>(136.)&mdash;In the afternoon I landed at the north-eastern
base of Mount Lookover for the purpose of sketching a remarkable
adansonia, just inside the mangrove fringe, on which tree, at
some far distant date, an aboriginal artist has depicted somewhat
caricatured outlines of two alligators. These outlines, although
rude and exaggerated, are in some particulars correct to an
unexpected degree; e.g. the number of the carpals (5) as
distinguished from the tarsals (4) is carefully shewn,&mdash;an
evidence of accuracy one could have scarcely anticipated in the
work of either an amateur, or a tyro, for as such these efforts
must be regarded when compared with the more artistic
cave-paintings and shell engravings already seen. The outlines
are clear and were deeply cut in the original bark, which has
been supplanted by a growth of a far darker color; they now have
the appearance of being in relieve. After carefully copying these
outlines, I made a sketch of the tree itself, as its shape is
unlike any of the species seen in the vicinity.</p>
<p>(137.)&mdash;Taking a solitary ramble to the south-east of
Mount Lookover, I was struck with the frequency, size, and
solidity of the edifices of the Termitidæ, white ants. One in the
form of a sugar-loaf, about 9 feet in height, I imagined to be
abandoned; so, wanting a few feet of additional height, to see
over a saddle in the range before me, and having first tried my
geological pick upon its base, I climbed to the top and obtained
the desired view, but at the expense of no small amount of terror
to the countless thousands of white ants, that now came swarming
from the ground upwards. This is not by any means the largest
ant-hill I have seen in this district: but the general height
ranges between 4 and 6 feet. The shape is in all cases an
irregular cone. A second species selects an old tree in which to
build the nest; and in one instance the mere shell of this tree
alone remained, all the wood having been replaced by the mortar
of the working ants. Hermit crabs (Paguridæ) are here upon the
beach in countless numbers, and in every sized shells, from the
smallest Trochus to the larger shells of the Muricidæ.</p>
<p>(138.)&mdash;Selecting a few more additions to my geological
cabinet, I waded through the mud and water to the long-boat,
distant about ¼ of a mile from the mangroves, in consequence of
the ebbing tide, and thence returned to the schooner, at anchor
in mid-channel, fatigued by the journey but amply repaid by my
collected specimens.</p>
<p>(139.)&mdash;The older mangroves on the seaward side, here
attain an enormous growth; the tree to which the vessel was
moored has a girth of not less than 24 feet; its height being
about 30 feet, 18 of which are immersed in every high tide. The
mangroves are just now putting on their verdant clothing for the
year; the green leaves are so brittle that they break with an
even line of fracture, upon the application of the slightest
pressure.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><span class="aa">Friday</span>,
22nd April.</div>
<p>(140.)&mdash;In the early morning the Dingo's howl was heard
all round the Harbor; from the two camps on shore we learn, that
this creature is so bold that it comes up to the very fires,
prowling about at night in search of booty near the camp. Our old
friends, the alligators, have not shown themselves much: not more
than half a dozen have as yet been seen. They have done us no
material damage; twice, their inquisitive deposition led them to
inspect the boats, and to meddle with the oars; and
once,&mdash;so report says, a large one, being attacked by a
mongrel lurcher, such a dog as we see pictured in the company of
poachers and other nocturnal robbers, the property of a man
included in the Expedition party,&mdash;resented the attack of
the contemptible quadruped by swallowing him; so says report;
facts simply declare, that the dog was seen no more. The bereaved
owner expresses great regret at his loss, as the dog was very
valuable to him. The day has been passed in refitting the vessel
for sea; and in receiving and stowing water, firewood,
&amp;c.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><span class="aa">Saturday</span>,
23rd April.</div>
<p>(141.)&mdash;To-day the ship was moved from the anchorage in
mid-channel, to a spot very close to the camp on the peninsula,
where the horses have been feeding since our return from Mount
King. Between 5 and 6 p.m. the first five horses were taken on
board without sustaining any injury whatever. In the afternoon,
one of the party. Mr. Logue, met with an accident, which,
fortunately does not promise to have serious results. He was
firing off a carbine, in order not to bring it on board loaded,
when it burst at the breach, and badly wounded his left hand. The
loss of the use of this hand for a time, and a little pain, will
probably include all the inconvenience to be suffered.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><span class="aa">Sunday</span>,
24th April.</div>
<p>(142.)&mdash;At early morn the anchor was weighed and we
proceeded towards the rocky bar between Careening island and
Green island. We found a break in the bar near the southern end
of the circular reef, with 4½ fathoms water upon it at low tide.
All the men and stock are now on board; we only await to-morrow's
tide and land breeze to take us clear of Brecknock Harbor. The
church service was read this evening: only seven attended.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><span class="aa">Monday</span>,
25th April.</div>
<p>(143.)&mdash;At 4 a.m. we set sail with a fair wind and tide
towards the entrance of Brecknock Harbor. In two hours we were
abreast of the pinnacle, in mid-channel, when the water was
observed to shoal rapidly; a few minutes afterwards the vessel
grounded aft in 1½ fathoms, at low water. All hands then went
into the bows, and the whale-boat was manned in order to keep the
schooner so that her sails should catch the wind; after a few
seconds she broke away the coral bottom and floated slowly off
into 8 fathoms of water. We came out by this channel because 16
fathoms are marked on the chart and because we found sufficient
water when we came in: but on entering we were perhaps 50 yards
further to the north, where there is sufficient water for any
vessel at low tide, provided she have both wind and tide in her
favor; but there is no room to beat. If the soundings, 16
fathoms, were inserted, in future charts, quite close to the
rocky point north of the pinnacle, it would be correct, and
future accidents to vessels entering or coming out of Brecknock
Harbor, would be prevented.</p>
<p>(141.)&mdash;Brecknock Harbor is in shape somewhat like a
right-angled triangle, whose hypothenuse or northern limit, about
eight miles in length, is formed by the south-eastern shores of
Augustus island. At its apex are the entrances, made narrow by
the four large and several small islands situate there. At the
union of the two sides forming the right angle is the entrance to
Camden Harbor, which is nearly dry at low water throughout its
greater length from west to east. At the third angle, that is,
five miles to the north of Camden Harbor, are Rogers' Straits,
forming a water communication with Port George the Fourth. The
southern line of the triangle is about 6½ miles in length. The
coast line within the harbor is everywhere indented with
beautiful bays; there ave several picturesque islands on nearly
all of which we find abundance of fresh water: nearly every
valley too has its rippling brook running down to the blue waters
of the Harbor. Grass is plentiful in any direction.</p>
<p>(145.)&mdash;The anchorage in all parts is good; and once at
anchor a ship need fear no wind, as the harbor is thoroughly
land-locked. Ships entering from Camden Sound have but two
dangers to avoid; one is the bank extending northwards from the
pinnacle rock,&mdash;the other is the rocky bar between Careening
island and the circular roof. Until further surveys have been
made, I should consider Rogers' Strait a very dangerous entrance
on account of the reefs, and Camden Harbor a hazardous anchorage
by reason of its terrace-like bottom, which at some tides has not
more than ½ and ¾ of a fathom of water. Brecknock Harbor is an
excellent place for watering ships, and drift-wood is abundant
near the line of high water; but timber fit for spars and the
repairs of ships, grows at too great a distance inland to be
available.</p>
<p>(146.)&mdash;Vessels entering from Camden Sound should do so
only with the flood tide and with a fair wind; the rocks to the
south-west of New island, to be seen at all times, may be passed
in mid-channel: but on sighting the pinnacle, which is close to
the southern shore, a course about [1/8] of a mile distant from
New island will command the deepest water, running from 13 to 16
fathoms at the narrowest part of the entrance; when the pinnacle
bears S., a course E. 10 deg. N. may be sailed for 2½ miles, when
the northern entrance opens out into Camden Sound (bearing N.W.):
thence, a course E.N.E. of 3 miles may be steered, with 6 and 7
fathoms water, either towards Green island or Camden Harbor.
Vessels above 100 tons register may select any spot within these
limits, and obtain safe anchorage. Vessels of less than 100 tons
register, with a draught of about 10 feet, after crossing the
rocky bar N.E. by N. of Careening island, may find a perfectly
secure anchorage, anywhere in mid-channel, as far as the entrance
to Camden Harbor, with not less than 3 and 4 fathoms water; all
these soundings are at low tide.</p>
<p>(147.)&mdash;For beaching a vessel on a soft bottom, it would
be difficult to find a better spot than the sand-patch on
Careening island; whilst if a hard even bottom be desired, for
repairs of keel, &amp;c., the deep bay whose head bears S.E. from
Mount Lookover, distant half a mile from the base of the Mount,
will be found convenient and safe. The time of high water within
Brecknock Harbor, at full and change of moon, or the
Establishment of the port, is at noon; that is 40 minutes later
than in Camden Sound. Spring rise, 30 feet; neap 12 feet. The
tides rush through the entrances with great force: it would not
be advisable for any vessel to attempt the passages under sail,
with an opposing tide.</p>
<p>(148.)&mdash;Soon after passing the mouth of the harbor the
land wind deserted us, giving place to the sea-breeze, which was
less favorable to our course. At noon our long, was E. 124 deg.
21 min. 20 sec. and lat. S. 15 deg. 30 min.; Battery point bore
E. by N., distant 7 miles. Towards sunset we sighted Cockell's
island at 10 miles' distance. At 7.30 p.m. whilst taking
soundings with the deep-sea lead in order to find anchorage,
through carelessness the lead and line were lost: so the ship was
put about and we steered a N.W. course until midnight, when the
anchor was cast in 32 fathoms water. We now found that although
the vessel had appeared to be sailing on her course, the tide,
running S.E. at the rate of K. 4½ per hour, was carrying her
towards Montgomery reef, at the mouth of Collier Bay.</p>

Bay</span>.</h3>
<div style="text-align:center;"><span class="aa">Tuesday</span>,
26th April.</div>
<p>(149.)&mdash;In the early morning the threatening appearance
of the weather caused the master to keep the vessel at anchor
until 9 a.m. A dense bank of black hard-edged cumulonus was seen
to the S.E., the wind blowing in squalls, and an unusually high
barometrical column for the hour of the day (6 a.m.) At 9 a.m.
the storm having passed south about to the W. we set sail with a
fair wind but strong tide against us. At noon we were in long. E.
123 deg. 46 min. 40 sec. and lat. S. 15 deg. 32 min. 42 sec.
Cockell's, McCleay, and Bathurst Islands were sighted during the
afternoon. At sunset Caffarelli and Treacherous Reef lie
immediately in our course, and the wind was so light we had no
hope of keeping clear of these, or of the still greater dangers
of King's Sound; so getting into 22 fathoms water at 7 p.m., we
anchored for the night, in white water.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><span class=
"aa">Wednesday</span>, 27th April.</div>
<p>(150.)&mdash;At early dawn the vessel was under sail with a
fine N.E. wind; as our course was within a few degrees of W., and
as the tide for six hours set us off shore, we saw but little of
the islands near King's Sound. Caffarelli was sighted soon after
2 p.m. at a distance of not less than 18 miles. During both tides
of to-day their strength, velocity and color were remarkable; the
muddy color of the water, the fields of sea-weed sailed through,
and the drifting of the schooner oven when sailing at K. 7½ per
hour were equally remarkable. Observations determine the combined
force of tide and current to be between 4 and 4½ knots per
hour.</p>
<p>(151.)&mdash;During the afternoon the dreaded Brue Rock was
seen, just awash at ¾ flood. The soundings were between 30 and 45
fathoms: in the former the anchor was cast at midnight, as our
position with regard to King's Sound and the islands of the
Buccaneer Archipelago, owing to the sweep of the tide, was now a
matter of uncertainty. We noticed vivid lightning to the westward
all the evening. At noon our Longitude was E. 123 deg. 6 min. 35
sec, and Latitude S. 15 deg. 38 min. 30 sec.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><span class="aa">Thursday</span>,
28th April.</div>
<p>(152.)&mdash;At dawn of day all were at work getting home the
anchor and the 60 fathoms of chain. This was not finished until 7
a.m., when we were again under sail with a fine N.E. wind. At
11.30 a.m., we sighted the main near Sandy Point, Dampier Land.
At noon we were in Longitude E. 122 deg. 30 min., and Latitude S.
16 deg. 25 min. At 2 p.m. we cast anchor in 5½ fathoms at ¾
flood; Cape Borda bearing N.E. by N., distant 4 miles, and Point
Emeriau S.W. by W., distant nearly 10 miles. The beach is about
2½ miles from our anchorage. On the beach we can see two or three
natives walking along the sand. It was high water at 4 p.m.
Towards night it was feared there would not be sufficient water
at low tide; accordingly soundings were taken at intervals of 15
minutes until 10.15 p.m., when we had about 9 feet of water
beneath the keel; the tide falling only 12 feet, or at the rate
of 2 feet per hour. These are neap tides.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><span class="aa">Friday</span>,
29th April.</div>
<p>(153.)&mdash;We had a thunderstorm last night which lasted 6
hours; it came from the S.W. and disappeared to the N. The
lightning was remarkable for the rapidity with which flash
succeeded flash, so as, at times, to light up the whole horizon
for a period of several seconds. The thunder was confused: one
report blending with the other and producing a rumbling turmoil
that prevented the making of an estimate of the distance we were
anchored, from the spot to which the electrical disturbance was
vertical. The whole sky seemed to be highly charged with the
disturbed fluid: even after the apparent termination of the
storm, the equilibrium was far from restored; the most vivid
discharges continued to take place at intervals of a few seconds,
apparently, in many cases, from the sea upwards. This display was
grand in the extreme: and it was prolonged until nearly
sun-rise.</p>
<p>(154.)&mdash;At dawn of day we left our anchorage with a fair
wind, some of the men of the party complaining of the anchor
being cast here at all. They allege, I believe, the weather,
&amp;c., as a reason why we should not remain but other
considerations I fear have no little weight in the hatching of
this remonstrance. Be that as it may, we are under sail without
having landed at the spot we purposely came in shore to examine,
as we had proposed to do on our outward voyage. (See March
28th.)</p>
<p>(155.)&mdash;Sailing closer to the shore of Dampier Land, than
on our outward voyage, we have every evidence to favor the
opinion of the prevalence of rich verdure on the hills and table
lands; from Point Emeriau southward, the grass and trees grow
down to the line of sand-hills and red cliffs. Our Longitude at
noon was E. 122 deg. 16 min. 20 sec, and Latitude S. 16 deg. 55
min. 50 sec. Running one mile more on our course, we anchored at
1 p.m. about midway between the Lacepede islands and the main, in
10½ fathoms water. This is a good anchorage; the Lacepedes and
their encircling reef act as a breakwater: their influence was
well marked soon after noon, when we passed, in a few cable's
length from slightly rough water, to a sea disturbed only by a
gentle undulation.</p>
<p>(156.)&mdash;There was a succession of thunderstorms all the
afternoon, some passing immediately over us, The lightning was
very vivid; a slight electrical breeze set in for a few minutes,
on one occasion only. Each storm brought its rainfall, which
although prolonged was not great in amount.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><span class="aa">Saturday</span>,
30th April.</div>
<p>(157.)&mdash;At 6 a.m. under sail again, with a very light
wind. In the course of the morning we passed over a bank bearing
S.S.E. of Cape Baskerville; the soundings on this bank at low
water were four fathoms at the shallowest part, at a distance of
3 miles from the Cape. At noon our Longitude was E. 122 deg. 8
min. 20 sec, and Latitude S. 17 deg. 4 min. 20 sec. The breeze
freshened a little in the afternoon, so that at 6 p.m., when the
anchor was cast, in 12 fathoms water, Point Coulomb bore east,
distant five miles. Dense cumulonus stretched all round the
horizon; we had vivid lightning and squalls of wind and rain in
the evening. After 10 p.m. the clouds dispersed, and a clear
star-light night ensued; there was no wind after the last-named
hour. The vessel rode easily at anchor, with little strain. The
current and tide here, setting in a N.E. by N. direction, does
not travel at a less rate than 3 knots per hour.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><span class="aa">Sunday</span>,
1st May.</div>
<p>(158.)&mdash;At day-light it was calm; very heavy rain-storms
were hanging over the land; from the perpendicular margins of the
clouds when the rain was falling, I should imagine it fell
without wind. We caught one of the Gadidæ, a family belonging to
the Malacopterygious (or soft-finned) order, very closely
resembling the gadus carbonarius, the coal-fish of North European
seas. All day yesterday we noticed shoals of these fish but they
would not take a bait. The food of this Gadus consisted of
crustaceans and small fish: among the former were several prawns
(Palæmon serratus) 3 to 4 inches in length, and three crabs too
far digested to enable me to recognize the species; the small
fish also were in the same partially-digested state. The weight
of this fish was about 20lbs. Later in the morning a specimen of
the Indian Remora, or sucking fish was caught; it is the Echcneis
neucrates, which is of a more slender shape than the species
described by Pliny, and other ancient naturalists. The apparatus
by which it effects its adhesion to sharks and other fish,
consists of an oval area (diameters 7 and 4 inches.) on the top
of the head, traversed by 22 pairs of partitions on each side of
the longitudinal septum. Its length was 2 feet; diameter, not
inclusive of the pectoral fins, 4½ inches.</p>
<p>I took a careful outline of the fish; it was too, long and too
broad to go into my bottles, so it was skinned for preservation.
A second specimen was caught: its sucker was preserved for
microscopic examination.</p>
<p>(159.)&mdash;During the afternoon a very large scaled yellow
water-snake (Hydrophes) was caught; it was about 6 feet in
length. In its stomach was a fish about 8 inches in girth. It is
difficult to conceive how so small a mouth could be sufficiently
distended to admit so disproportionate a morsel, until we see
that besides the usual modification of the superior maxillary,
which is moveably articulated to the palatine, ectoptorygoid, and
lacrymal bones, as in all poisonous snakes,&mdash;there is an
extraordinary enlargement of the edentulous inferior maxillary,
which, viewed externally, appears like a longitudinal symphysis
in the jaw, rendering it capable of great lateral extension.</p>
<p>(160.)&mdash;The anchor was up at 9 a.m. with the promise of a
breeze; but, becalmed, we drifted only to the N.E. by N. until
noon, when our Longitude was E. 122 deg. 3 min. 15 sec, and
Latitude S. 17 deg. 16 min.; then a N.W. breeze, force 2, sprung
up, and we sailed along, nearly parallel with the coast line,
until 8.35 p.m. when the wind being very light, and the tidal
movement drifting us in shore at the rate of about 3 knots per
hour, the anchor was let go in 12 fathoms water. The evening
service was read as usual: there were but seven persons
present.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><span class="aa">Monday</span>,
2nd May.</div>
<p>(161.)&mdash;At daylight we were under sail once more with, a
very light wind from the eastward. Shoals of fish are to be seen
all round the vessel, but they will not take a bait. The land
breeze soon died away and we were becalmed, so that at noon we
found we had lost, by drifting, eight miles; our position being
Longitude E. 121 deg. 54 min. and Latitude S. 17 deg. 38 min. 30
sec. A good N.W. wind set in about 2 p.m., and by 5 o'clock we
were 5 miles to the westward of Point Gantheaume, the
northernmost head of Roebuck Bay, but in such shallow water, 6¼
fathoms, that as it was getting dark, and as the state of the
tide was not known with certainty, the vessel was put about and
sailed into 7¼ fathoms, when the anchor was cast for the night.
During the calm no water-snakes were seen; but as soon as the
breeze set in, an unusual number of both Hydrophes and Hydri were
seen in all directions.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><span class="aa">Tuesday</span>,
3rd May.</div>
<p>(162.)&mdash;We were becalmed until noon, in Longitude E. 122
deg. 9 min., and Latitude S. 18 deg. 6 min. During the afternoon
we had a westerly wind, which would have carried us across the
Bay, had not the tide set against us with so much force, that in
the early afternoon we had enough to do to hold our own. Towards
night, the wind freshening, we sailed a few miles on our course,
until we reached 6¼ fathoms water, when we cast anchor. It was
high water at our anchorage, 13 miles S. by W. of Point
Gantheaume, at 9.30 p.m. Rise of tide 12 feet. During the morning
three large sharks were caught: in the stomach of one, we found
its most recent meal consisted of Hydrophes, of from one to 4½
feet in length.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><span class=
"aa">Wednesday</span>, 4th May.</div>
<p>(163.)&mdash;Expecting a more favorable wind to-day, the
anchor was got on board at 6 a.m., but until noon we made only a
retrograde course; our Longitude being E. 122 deg. 6 min. 0 sec.,
and Latitude S. 18 deg. 2 min. After dinner a strong breeze from
the westward carried us by 3 p.m. into Longitude E. 122 deg. 1
min. 45 sec., and Latitude S. 18 deg. 13 min. 20 sec., where,
finding our soundings gradually decreasing, we anchored in 5
fathoms water, hard sand; Cape Villaret bore nearly S.S.E.,
distant 7 miles.</p>
<p>(164.)&mdash;We have now cruised about the mouth of Roebuck
Bay for three days without finding any indication of a channel:
whenever we have had Point Gantheaume and Cape Villaret, the two
heads of Roebuck Bay, in a line, the soundings have been less
than 5 fathoms; and approaching either shore to a distance of 5
miles, we obtain the same soundings. The whale-boat, therefore,
was got over the side as soon as we came to anchor; its
destination is Cape Villaret, the result hoped of it, is a line
of soundings taken as it returns from the shore to-morrow
morning. This is by far the most exposed anchorage we have had
since we left Brecknock Harbor; there is a swell setting with the
tide, even without wind, of sufficient force to cause the vessel
to ride uneasily: in the event of a westerly gale of wind, this
anchorage would be highly dangerous. It is high water here, at
full and change at 10 a.m. Rise of tide, 20 feet this day.</p>
<p>(165.)&mdash;Great quantities of water-snakes were seen off
this Bay: several were caught. The capturing is a very simple
matter; we have a long pole with a large fish-hook fastened at
the end; a snake approaching, this contrivance is slipped
underneath and a sudden jerk brings the creature, generally
uninjured, on deck, where, although it is extremely fierce,
biting the ropes and even the very deck itself, it is by no means
formidable, for the shape which so beautifully adapts it to its
aquatic life, is precisely that which prevents its active
movement on a solid surface. Rapid contortions of the body with
fierce darts and bitings, without direct progress in any
direction, have alone characterised their action when on deck.
(Native fires seen on both heads of Roebuck Bay.)</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><span class="aa">Thursday</span>,
5th May.</div>
<p>(166.)&mdash;At sun-rise only a glimpse of the solar eclipse
was obtained, and that sight was rendered the more uncertain on
account of a haze upon the eastern horizon. It was high water at
10 a.m. Rise of tide 23.5 feet. At 2 p.m. the whale-boat party
returned: they bring excellent news. A 16-fathom channel, half a
mile from Cape Villaret a sandy beach&mdash;an easy country to
travel&mdash;good grass&mdash;and many natives, consequently,
abundance of game and some water. Wind and tide did not favor us,
so we remained at anchor all night.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><span class="aa">Friday</span>,
6th May.</div>
<p>(167.)&mdash;In the early morning we had a very strong S.E.
wind; this with the flood tide soon produced a heavy sea. We were
unable to weigh anchor until 10 a.m. Then the tide being against
us, we were carried four or five miles to the westward of our
destination, so that at 2 p.m., when becalmed, the anchor was let
go in 9 fathoms water. In two hours time, a S.W. breeze springing
up, we were under sail again steering towards Cape Villaret. At
6.30 p.m. we were in 4½ fathoms water at 2 miles from the shore.
We anchored in 12½ fathoms water at 7 p.m., Cape Villaret bearing
S. 9 deg. E. distant 1¾ miles. This is our final anchorage in
Roebuck Bay; as we have so little of our time remaining, all
further exploration of the Bay itself, must be made with the
boats, whilst we are away inland to the eastward. At noon the
vessel was in long. E. 121 deg. 57 min. 40 sec. lat. S. 18 deg.
20 min. At final anchorage the long. was E. 122 deg. 5 min. and
lat S. 18 deg. 17 min.</p>

<p>(168.)&mdash;The longboat with a party went on shore to-day to
examine and deepen the native well they found yesterday.
Deepening the well does not seem to have increased the supply,
which although small is sufficient for all purposes; even the
filling up of the water casks may be completed, whilst we are
absent on the land exploration, if the depot party left here will
show a little more activity than they did in Brecknock Harbor.
There is also an abundant supply of firewood within a short
distance of the beach.</p>
<p>(169.)&mdash;Cape Villaret viewed from the sea is very
remarkable. It is formed of red and white sandstone, with
detached pinnacles, from 15 to 60 feet in height, of greatly
varied outline. These rocks are capped with sands of the same
colors, bearing tufts of grass of good quality, with an exquisite
odor of verbena. Rocks lie piled about the beach in fantastic
groups: the result of extensive land slips and partial
disintegrations. The sandy beach slopes rapidly into deep water.
About 1½ miles north of the cape the depth of water at low tide
is not less than 12 fathoms; whilst on a line due north from the
cape, for 20 miles, extensive shoals are formed which give in no
case deeper water than from 3 to 4 fathoms. Only one detached
rock, dangerous to shipping, has as yet been seen; that rock lies
off Cape Villaret, north by west, at a distance of about 1 mile;
it was revealed to us, after we had sailed quite close to it, by
the low tide of this evening. At 4 p.m. we moved closer into the
shore and anchored at ½ a mile from the beach in 3 fathoms water
at low tide.</p>

<p>(170.)&mdash;At 7 a.m. two of the horses were safely taken
ashore. The strength of the tide is such as to make a second boat
necessary to tow the long-boat with the horse. At low water in
the afternoon, the remaining three horses were landed without
accident; two boats, the whale-boat and the long-boat, were still
required. In the evening the Church Service was read; some of the
party being at the depot, there were only six present.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><span class="aa">Monday</span>,
9th May.</div>
<p>(171.)&mdash;At day-break we landed in the long-boat to
measure a base line, and take angles of all the hills visible
from Cape Villaret. The highest land on the Cape is 145 feet
above mean sea level; the surrounding country does not present
many points favorable to a series of triangles. Such as there
were to be seen were taken, although one only lies in the
neighbourhood of our proposed course; but the others will serve
to lie down the minor details of the coast line with more
accuracy than we now find them on the charts.</p>
<p>(172.)&mdash;Two remarkable hillocks to the S.W. of Cape
Villaret we obtained from both ends of the line; that to the
eastward we named the Church, on account of its general outline,
seen from the seaward, bearing a strong resemblance to such an
edifice; the tower is formed by a large tree growing near the
summit. The second hillock we named the Barn, from its shape. An
ancient lava stream, intrusive, as to existing Pleistocene
strata, may be seen upon the surface, not more than half a mile
inland from Cape Villaret. On the beach I took a sketch of a
curious pile of feldspathic and weathered calcareous sand-stone,
standing isolated on the sandy shore: this, from the fancied
resemblance, was by all named "the Judge sitting in his chair;"
it forms a remarkable pile of stones: and from the shadows
projected from overhanging pieces, before the sun attains an
altitude of 35 deg., it gives the appearance of a weathered
sculpture, when viewed from the S.E., at a distance of 200 yards.
Height of sitting figure 15 feet: total height, including
pedestal, 35 feet.</p>
<p>(173.)&mdash;The cliffs here have been subject to intense
volcanic action: for half a mile the strata lie quite vertical.
To this volcanic action, as a cause, may be ascribed the
picturesque appearance of the Cape when viewed from the sea.
Here, too, we found some curious cylindrical pipes from one to
three or four inches in diameter, and of various lengths; they
were lying scattered about the beach in the vicinity of Cape
Villaret. These pipes are apparently stratified and compounded of
alternate deposits of thin layers of crystalline specular iron,
carbonate of lime, and water-worn compacted siliceous sand. They
are due to the percolation down channels; in the sand-hills,
during the process of consolidation, of water containing
alternately carbonate of lime and oxides, of iron in solution.
From, the highest land on the Cape we could see what we believe
to be a range of hills running north and south, about 35 or 40
miles inland; from this spot to the range of hills, the country
appears quite flat. The soil, within a mile of the sea, changes
from sandy to a series of rich alluvial flats, and then a compact
red sandy, loam with patches of very fine gravel. The grass
changes in like manner, becoming much finer and sweeter, but
still growing in tufts.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><span class="aa">Tuesday</span>,
10th May.</div>
<p>(174.)&mdash;We left the vessel at 6.30 a.m.; at the depot we
found the horses nearly ready to start. The depot is situated E.
¼ S., about 2¾ miles from Cape Villaret, on a little lightly
timbered and well-grassed flat, just inside the double range of
sand-hills on the coast, close to a native well. At 8 a.m. (the
party consisting of Mr. Panter, Shields, the mate of the
schooner, Buck, our native Dunedale, and myself,&mdash;with my
pony, and 3 pack-horses carrying a fortnight's provisions) we
left the depot and travelled 12 miles; 10 miles on our due east
course. We could not keep a straight line of march on account of
thickets; these are not dense, but they are so encumbered with
dead wood on the ground, that the horses find it difficult to
keep their footing. If the thickets were once burnt there would
be nothing to prevent a straight course being made through them
in any direction. The ground passed over is perfectly level and
sufficiently well grassed; by <i>sufficiently well grassed</i> is
meant, a second rate country as compared with the Glenelg
district; it is about equal in grazing capabilities to the
average runs of Champion Bay. The timber is all small; it
includes Eucalypti, Acacieæ, Cupresseoe, occasionally very
stunted Sautalaceæ, and frequently trees not yet recognised as to
genera but belonging to the order Myrtaceæ.</p>
<p>(175.)&mdash;The soil being of a sandy loam; without stones or
gravel, we have as yet fallen in with no water except in the
native wells, one of which determined the position of our depot,
and a second here, conspicuous by its fringe of Hybisceæ, induced
us to make its vicinity the sight of our noon-day bivouac. This
well is about 15 feet deep. On going down, it was found to have
no water in it; but when the spade was thrust into the bottom, it
came out quite wet. Having dined, using the water we had brought
here in a keg, four of the party set to work to dig another well
close alongside the one found. The well was dug in two hours to a
depth of 16 feet and water reached, the same soil as at the
surface holding all the way down; it was now found that the sides
of the well would fall in; indeed they already began to do so
before the well was considered to be finished. We now, therefore,
determined, as both men and horses were still fresh, and the day
not too far advanced, to pack up and travel a few miles
further.</p>
<p>(176.)&mdash;During the period of the well-sinking operations,
the opportunity to examine our resting-place more minutely, was
embraced. Near the well a fine shady tree, one of the Myrtaceæ,
was found to be covered as to its trunk and lower branches, with
the climbing abrus. At its base lie scattered hundreds of the
seeds, about 50 of which had already taken root. The edifices of
the white ant have been numerous and large all along our route;
many recently fallen trees were being enclosed within the covered
ways of these busy insects. Near Brecknock Harbor, the habitation
of the Termitidæ consisted most frequently of a single, conical
hill; but here the building presents a series of irregular cones
connected below, but without any indication of a design hereafter
to enclose them within one large edifice of any given definite
shape.</p>
<p>(177.)&mdash;Following a native path, which it was supposed
might lead to another well, we travelled four miles S.E., when
the track diverged in so many directions that we resumed our
course for two miles E.; evening coming on, we were obliged to
encamp without water in thick country, but with an abundance of
green feed for the horses. Our supper was rather a sorry one: a
piece of damper and half a pint of the scanty supply of the water
we started with. Camp No. 3. Long. E. 122 deg. 20 min. 45 sec.,

<div style="text-align:center;"><span class=
"aa">Wednesday</span>, 11th May.</div>
<p>(178.)&mdash;At 5.30 a.m. we started off again; in the matter
of food the horses have the advantage of us: there was enough dew
to moisten the grass, which itself was green, thus preventing
their hunger and thirst rebelling against so early a departure;
in short they have fared far from badly. Our course for four
miles was E.N.E.; our track then crossed a dense thicket which
compelled us to travel S. one mile and S.E., one mile, in order
to avoid it. Our native then declared we were near water, so to
spare the horses extra and difficult travelling, whilst Mr.
Panter and the native followed up the track of a native woman
which does not seem older than last night, we, the remainder of
the party, halted. After walking two miles through the thickets,
for there were several, they came upon a native encampment, but
its occupants had all fled, even leaving their fires burning.
There were here two wells, both containing water. Our route with
the horses, through alternate thickets and grassy plains, was
E.N.E., two miles. We encamped at 9.30 a.m.</p>
<p>(179.)&mdash;Two hours afterwards, when we were having our
breakfast, some natives were seen watching us from some
neighbouring trees. We advanced towards them armed, but making
signs to them to throw down their spears; this after a time they
did. Then they came up to us making signs that they wanted water
from the wells. We lent them a pannican; after they had satisfied
their thirst, we gave them some sugar, biscuit, and damper.
Several tendered back the sugar even after we had shewn them how
to use it: others threw it away. We then exhibited to them a
horse, and illustrated its use; this was a source; of wonder not
unmixed with fear to them. At the sight of lucifer matches,
pipes, and firearms, they were astonished and terrified; the
discharge of a gun together with a view of Tommy's mouth and
teeth, (this Tommy, was one of the pack-horses) kindly afforded
them by one of our party who, after the display of equitation,
called their attention by pantomime to the various organs of what
to them must have been a marvellous quadruped, caused them to
effect an immediate and final retreat, in spite of our amicable
signs and their voluntary promise after a while to return.</p>
<p>(180.)&mdash;We endeavoured to find out from them where we
should next seo water: but we are not certain that they
understood us; if they did, they pointed out the direction of our
course. They were all very thirsty: each drank two pints of
water, and as there were nineteen of them, we feared for a supply
sufficient for the horses; however, the wells filled up again so
speedily that a bucketful was obtained a few minutes after their
departure. They appeared charmed to meet the native of our party,
one "Tommy Dunedale," whom they, seemed to recognise as some long
lost relative. They spared not their caresses upon this
individual whom they were evidently anxious should accompany
them. One old man was so affectionately disposed towards "Tommy"
as to hug him to an undesired extent. Whether this was from the
pleasing contemplation of a feast at Tommy's expense, for he is a
half-caste young and plump,&mdash;or whether it was the fancied
recognition of Tommy as an old acquaintance I cannot yet make
out, but appearances favor the latter supposition.</p>
<p>(181.)&mdash;These natives were naked with the exception of a
few leaves just donned. They were not above the average height of
men, they were mostly young, and all were well-conditioned and
muscular. Some were wilgied, (painted with a mixture of red-ochre
and grease)&mdash;others were colored with charcoal&mdash;and
others again were decorated with spots of color, as if they had
just left the scene of some recent festivity. Their hair was
strained back from the forehead and tied at the back of the head
in most cases, but in some few instances, it was allowed to grow
naturally, that is, it stood out from the head in radiating
spiral locks about four inches in length; briefly, the hair may
be described as wavy-crisp in texture, jet-black in color. In no
instance could any individual be said to have woolly hair. Some
wore the beard and moustache plaitted up in locks with string.
One young native was particularly proud of his personal
appearance: he rejoiced in the possession of a charming moustache
gummed and twisted upwards and outwards quite à la mode du Roi
d'ltalie. Their countenances were far from repulsive. More evenly
set or whiter teeth than theirs, could scarcely be imagined.
Unusquisque apella esset.</p>
<p>(182.)&mdash;Their arms were of the most primitive
description&mdash;roughly cut sticks, some pointed at both ends,
served as spears; they had with them neither womeras, bomerangs,
nor shields. In all probability we have fallen in with a hunting
party not connected with the tribe wham we this morning
frightened away from the site of our present encampment. The only
specimens of native art yet found here, are the scoops they use
for digging wells, &amp;c.; the makers are most lavish in the
carving of these implements, carving them all over, inside and
out, with oblique and curved lines; the superiority of our spade,
when it was shewn them how digging might be done with it, was
immediately understood, and by signs they expressed their
appreciation of it. Besides the eatables, we gave them a clasp
knife and some lucifer matches. When a match failed to light,
they exclaimed málo; this is the only word recognized as allied
to the southern dialects. After their departure, we did not find
ourselves minus any little articles lying about the tent, as is
too frequently the case after interviews with the Australian
tribes; it is possible they were so much astonished at our
unexpected appearance on their hunting ground, and so much
bewildered with the many sights new and marvellous to them, that
they had not time to develop the idea of possession. Evidently
they were not quite satisfied in their minds as to our good
intentions in the matter of presents, for we found soon after
they had left, that they had thrown away nearly everything we had
given them, even to the matches with which they had at first
seemed so pleased. A tame Dingo accompanied them, but it would
not come near enough to us to enable us to make friendly
overtures to it. We camped here for the night, keeping watch,
lest, having had time to ponder well over the matter, the natives
should return in greater numbers, or with less friendly
intentions. Camp No. 4. Long. E. 122 deg. 27 min. 20 sec., lat.

<div style="text-align:center;"><span class="aa">Thursday</span>,
12th May.</div>
<p>(183.)&mdash;We left the camp at 6,30 a.m. Our courses were as
follow: (1) E., 9 miles,&mdash;5 miles of well-grassed open
country, then thickets of 4 miles; (2) E. by N. 2 miles, one of
grassy plain and the second, more sandy than the prevailing soil,
was covered with the Clyanthus; (3) E.N.E., 1 mile; and (4) E. by
N., 4 miles. The fourth course, from the number of burnt patches,
seems a favorite hunting ground of the natives: we did not see
auy of them, but they could not have been very far distant from
us at any time, because the burnt ground was covered with quite
recent tracks and fresh fires were burning all round us. Our
route led through timber not exceeding 30 feet in height, of the
same kind but of superior growth to that seen in the country
between, Camps Nos. 1 and 3. Leguminiferæ, genus abrus and genera
of sub-tribe acacicæ predominating;&mdash;Malvaceaæ, tribe
Hibisceæ being largely represented; here too was found the
lemon-grass, of the same genus as that growing abundantly near
Brecknock Harbor, but of very much less luxuriant growth, the
Anatherum of India, called lemon-grass from having a strong lemon
scent when rubbed between the fingers; the same grass from whose
fresh leaves Europeans in India make an agreeable tea which is
considered stomachic, tonic, and useful in dyspepsia. Our 16
miles of course, accomplished by more than 20 miles of route,
brought us to a spot where, although there was no water, we
camped because green grass was growing luxuriantly. Camp No. 5,
Long. E. 122 deg. 43 min., Lat. S. 18 deg. 21 min. Height above
the sea 45 feet.</p>
<p>(184.)&mdash;At 3 p.m. we re-saddled the horses and travelled
7 miles further; thus, 4 miles E., 1 mile S., and 2 miles E. by
S. The ground was quite level; no rise, probably, exceeded 10
feet. It was well grassed and timbered like the ground passed
over in the morning. In places our progress was delayed by fallen
trees and dead brushwood, the accumulated result of many years.
Bush fires, in the sense understood in southern parts of Western
Australia seem not to obtain here. The grass burns with
difficulty until after noon, and at night, the first formation of
dew arrests the fire or else extinguishes it. Where the natives
burn round their wells, we can see the grass is burnt only by
dint of firing in many places. Trees are rarely burnt here.
Again, the thickets are so only by reason of the mass of dead
trees and brushwood forming a tangled under-stratum beneath the
living trees and scrub; if fire were once to gain in these
thickets they would entirely disappear. All the country passed
over to-day is well fitted for the keeping of any kind of stock,
provided only it were first burnt; and wells obtained; the trees,
although so small, afford splendid shade.</p>
<p>(185.)&mdash;Nearly every tree and plant in flower yields a
strong and grateful odor&mdash;the dwarf myrtle, so common here,
perhaps has the most powerful odor, but some of the acacicæ and
small shrubs possess scents exquisitely beautiful. The perfume of
the heliotrope, the violet, the clove pink, the rose, the
stock,&mdash;were all recognised; but many others although
delicious were such as could not be likened to that of any
commonly known plant or flower. A snake marked somewhat like the
carpet-snake of southern parts of this colony was shot this
morning; it was about 7 feet in length. This is the second only
that has been seen in this district; the first was an Elaps
Gouldii, about 2 feet in length, killed at Station No. 2. We
encamped again at night without water at 5 p.m., having travelled
upwards of 30 miles. The phenomena of lunar paraselenæ are seldom
witnessed within tropical regions; this evening, however, between
7 and 8 o'clock there was a beautiful display, due alone to the
diffractive refraction of light by aqueous vapor. It lasted more
than an hour. In intensity, the moon's light being 1000, it
exceeded 750 on the most brilliant lines, fading off on either
side to a barely perceptible nebulous edge. Camp No. 6, Long. E.

<div style="text-align:center;"><span class="aa">Friday</span>,
13th May.</div>
<p>(186.)&mdash;At day-light, not waiting to breakfast, we
started again and travelled 7 miles E. At 8.30 a.m. finding no
change of country, no hill visible, no sign of native wells, and
fearing to incur the risk of the time necessary to sink a well,
whilst the horses have been without water for 30 hours, during
which time they have travelled more than 37 miles,&mdash;we
commenced to retrace our steps to the native wells at Camp No. 4.
It seems a pity to turn back as we are now upwards of 50 miles to
the eastward of Cape Villaret, and our hope of reaching the
FitzRoy River is thus laid aside, for our time is far too limited
to make a second attempt eastward,&mdash;but there is no help for
it. The journey, however, is quite practicable. The country thus
far is well grassed and easy to travel over; if one-half or even
one-third of our daily distances were made, and water obtained by
sinking a well at each stopping place where no native wells
existed, one month or six weeks would suffice to enable any party
of three or four to reach the FitzRoy and return to Roebuck Bay
without the incurring of more difficulty and
fatigue,&mdash;danger there is none,&mdash;than during the
overland route from Champion Bay to Perth. But our time in this
district is limited to 14 or 15 days only, owing to the tedious
voyage to Brecknock Harbor, and the delay there of repairing the
vessel after our land-exploration was finished. Having now
therefore ascertained an extent of good pastoral land for upwards
of 50 miles in a direct line eastward of Cape Villaret, it seems,
under the circumstances, an important question to examine so much
of this district southwards from Roebuck Bay as the time will
admit of. This resolution made, after marking some trees, we
journeyed westward for an hour and then halted for breakfast on a
very short allowance of water. The position of our most eastern
point (Station No. 7) was in Long. E. 122 deg. 56 min., and Lat.
S. 18 deg. 23 min. Height above the sea 48 feet.</p>
<p>(187.)&mdash;At 11 a.m. we were again en route. After passing
Camp 6 about a mile, a noise like that of some one chopping a
tree, was heard at no groat distance from our track. Three of the
party approached the spot where the noise was heard. In a few
minutes they found a native cutting off a bough of a tree for the
purpose of obtaining honey in a hollow made by bees of the
carpenter kind (genus Xylocapa). The moment the native caught a
glimpse of his unexpected visitors, he stood motionless for a few
seconds, lost in astonishment; then bethinking him of his spear,
he threatened Buck with it, who in self-defence fired and wounded
the native with shot. This man seems to have been one of a
hunting party, for, upon the firing of the gun the bush resounded
far and wide with retreating shrieks of terror. As we had no time
to follow the natives, although doubtless we were at no great
distance from a native well, as soon as men and horses were all
collected together again, we resumed our course, travelling under
a cloudless sky; the solar radiation thermometer indicating a
temperature of 143 deg. at noon. We halted for an hour at 1 p.m.
and then continued our journey. Except the pleasing discovery, at
the root of a tree, of about a quart of what we were now willing
to designate water, but what at other times we should, simply
call mud, for liquid and solid matters were in nearly equal
ratios&mdash;nothing disturbed our toilsome walk, save fatigue,
until we reached the native wells, at ½ past 9 p.m. The distance
travelled over during the day, exceeded 45 miles. The wells did
not fail us; by 11 p.m. both men and horses had satisfied their
thirst and were well disposed to enjoy a night's rest.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><span class="aa">Saturday</span>,
14th May.</div>
<p>(188.)&mdash;This day we are resting. By frequently dipping
water from the well we get a sufficient supply; but wells that
may hereafter be sunk here will require to be either slabbed or
stoned. Some pigeons and kingfishers were shot to-day. There is
an abundance of game all along our track, but tune could not be
spared to obtain it.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><span class="aa">Sunday</span>,
15th May.</div>
<p>(189.)&mdash;Before sunrise we had saddled up and were ready
to start again. Our course for 5 miles was N.W.; then we struck a
native path, which we followed for 15 miles, running nearly W. by
N. towards Roebuck Bay. The first mile was clear: the succeeding
four contained belts of thicket; then the native path ran through
thickly wooded but well-grassed country down to the plains
immediately within the sea-coast range. We camped near the base
of the sand-hills which are here not more than 2 or 3 hundred
yards wide. The day we quitted the vessel a whale-boat party, in
charge. of Mr. A. Du Boulay, started to examine the head of
Roebuck Bay. We had not encamped here, on the plain, many minutes
when we met one of the crew of the whale-boat, who had walked
from the head of Roebuck Bay. We have water in the native well to
which the path we followed led us, but this man reports a better
supply some 5 or six miles further up the plain. The native wells
are not sunk deep enough: and being carried down so crookedly and
badly, any attempt to deepen them generally ends by their falling
in; but as the same loamy sou prevails all down, sinking to water
is only the work of a few hours. We purpose to remain encamped
here the rest of the day; two of the men have gone up the plain
to water the horses at a spot where we learn a large supply can
be obtained at a depth of only two feet from the surface.</p>
<p>(190.)&mdash;Our native "Dunedale" went out for an hour, to
make some additions to our impoverished larder; he returned with
a kangaroo, 3 turkeys, and 3 cockatoos. In the pouch of the
kangaroo was a young one, of about 14 days, which was forthwith
preserved in spirit. A new lizard also was caught: it is one of a
connecting genus between the Gecko and the Molochus horridus of
Grey. A black snake of the same species as is common to the
southern parts of this Colony, was shot just before we reached
our present camp.</p>
<p>(191.)&mdash;In the afternoon, during a stroll along the
sea-beach of Roebuck Bay, we picked up shells of the following
genera: Solen, Aspergillum (a smooth, club-shaped species, whose
calcareous tube is 5 inches in length, nearly like the Java
aspergillum, with the terminal anterior perforated disc
surrounded by fimbriated rays) 2 new species of Echini, of a dark
purple color, and some spines of a cidaris which I believe to be
undescribed; the sand in the dead shells yields many
Forameniferæ, chiefly of the families Helicostogidæ and
Entomostegidæ, whose precise generic and specific differences
cannot at present, be determined, through lack of time and
sufficient microscopic power; we likewise collected specimens of
Voluta, Helix, Strombus, Mactra, Donax, Arca, Pccten, Pinna,
Conus, Murex, Trochus, Haliotis, Cyproea, Pyrula, Akera,
Tridacna, Iridina, Astrae, Turritella and others. Rocks of 20 or
30 feet in height here project through the side of the sand-hills
and form steep boundaries to the beach. These rocks are
post-pliocene or aerial, formed of loose incoherent shell and
coral sand only recently compacted together into a solid stone by
the solution and redeposition of the carbonates of lime and
oxides of iron.</p>
<p>(192.)&mdash;The men did not return from the place, where they
watered the horses until 9 p.m. They had an interview with some
of the sea-coast tribe. One young native woman even for a few
minutes entrusted her child, about a fortnight old, to be nursed
by Buck, one of the two in charge of the horses; she afterwards
gave the same person her necklace made of pieces of the claws of
a crab; (Porcellana, a genus of Anomurous Crustacea found only
occasionally on the North-West Coast of Australia.) The pieces
composing, the necklace, were about the size and shape of large
bugles, similar to those used in ladies' fancy work, strung on a
twine as neatly made as whipcord, but, being manufactured of a
mixture of hair and various grass fibres, greatly inferior to it
in strength. Another trophy these men gained was a rude kind of
shield, not hollowed-out behind, after the fashion of those used
by more southern tribes, but with a handle cut out of the solid;
although heavy, it seems to have done the original owner good
service, as it bears the marks of several kileys; (the kiley is
an inferior kind of bomerang, less useful in the chase and less
destructive as an instrument of native warfare). No fighting
spears have as yet been seen in the possession of any of these
native tribes, nor is there any evidence to show that they are
acquainted with the use of the womera, or throwing stick. As a
race the sea-coast tribes appear timid and less intelligent than
those of the interior, or, if we may judge a race by its
handicraft, those of the Glenelg district. Camp No. 6, Long. E.

<p>(193.)&mdash;As we hear a very favorable account of the
fertility of the plains to the eastward, at 1 p.m., leaving the
native Dunedale in charge of the camp, we each took a horse and
started for the watering place which is 5½ miles E. by N.; from
Camp No. 8. The whole distance, our route lay over treeless
plains, bounded on the one side by the dunes and on the other by
a belt of cajeputi trees. The plains gradually widened from one
mile at Camp No. 8 to 5 or 6 miles, near the watering place. At
this spot water is easily obtainable within 2 or 3 feet of the
surface; either from native wells or by sinking; The plains
passed over we propose to name "the Racecourse Plains," as
obviously here, when the district is settled, the Roebuck Turf
Club will hold its first meeting; these plains are well-grassed
and will feed a large number of stock: the soil near our halting
ground is alluvial of a deep black color, consisting chiefly of
decomposed vegetable matter, with little sand. To the eastward
these plains extend as far as the eye can see gradually
increasing in breadth. It is a great pity we did not discover
them before starting on our eastward journey; had we done so, we
might easily have travelled 35 or 40 miles a day on our course,
instead of the average of 20 miles made daily, with difficulty,
last week. If we could only spare 3 or 4 weeks to the work we
could doubtless now reach the FitzRoy in this direction with our
present resources; but as the vessel's charter expires in now
little more than a month, we cannot entertain the question, and
<i>provincia aurifera</i> must remain a <i>provincia
incognita</i> so far as this expedition is concerned. In the
meantime the country between Cape Villaret and our Camp No. 7, it
may be observed, presents no indication whatever of a gold-field:
should this exist, the geological formation must undergo a
prodigious change within a few miles of our easternmost point, of
which change we could see no single evidence. I am inclined to
the belief that the name has been adopted by the ancient
navigators in a figurative sense, just as we speak of our "golden
age" in English History. Certainly any European beholding this
country towards the end of the spring time of the year, when the
rich earth is carpeted with verdure not to be excelled, and the
trees and bushes laden with the most fragrant and brilliant
flowers,&mdash;any man might be pardoned for a slight departure
from the routine of descriptive terms and indulge in the
figurative to the extent in question.</p>
<p>(194.)&mdash;During the afternoon, four native men came up to
us and we held a conference of not less than two hours' duration;
but as neither party understood a sentence of what the other
said, it ended in the most amicable manner, as such meetings not
unfrequently do in other parts of the earth. At parting we each
made the most friendly signs; in the bestowal of gifts the
reciprocity was almost entirely on our side; our presents to them
consisted of pins, buttons, string, fish-hooks, paper, colored
pencils, &amp;c. From them we gained only a limited number of
words to add to our vocabulary and these only by dint of no
little display of patience. One old man insisted upon calling me
Iágo. Their "Kardo", is equivalent to our indeed! ah! yes!
&amp;c., and is repeated rapidly when emphatic throughout a
descending scale of about 5 or 6 tones. At 6.30 p.m. we left the
watering-place with the horses and travelled quietly to our camp
in two hours. As we were returning, native fires kept springing
up all along the cajeputi thicket. These cajeputi trees I believe
will be valued by future colonists; not only as producers of an
oil possessing medical properties, but as sources of an oil that
has the power of dissolving India rubber and various resins, and,
therefore, in the manufacture of varnishes, &amp;c., an item of
commercial importance. In. the course of the evening Mr. A. Du
Boulay joined us; he is to accompany us to Lagrange Bay.</p>
<p>(195.)&mdash;Mr. Du Boulay gives me the following narrative of
his exploration of Roebuck Bay and its neighbourhood. He left the
"New Perseverance" on Tuesday the 10th courant, in the
whale-boats with a crew of four. About noon he reached the third
or most distant point of land on the southern shore of Roebuck
Bay, which is visible from the ship. The point itself is an
island at spring tides. The channel from Cape Villaret he found
to shoal rapidly from 12 to 3 fathoms within a distance of 7
miles in a N.E. direction from the Cape. The land between the
point and the main was covered with Echini, sponges, and shells.
From this point he examined an inlet running S.S.W.; it is quite
dry at low water, and at about 3 miles from the opening,
terminates in two smaller inlets fringed with mangroves. The
night of the 10th was passed in the boat at anchor off the Bay,
and aground at low tide. On the next day when the tide served,
the boat was taken round a sand-bank which extends off this point
to a distance exceeding 4½ miles, in a N.W. direction: then, the
point rounded, he approached the shore again to seek water, but
the mangroves were too dense to admit of landing there. Following
up the S.E. shore of the Bay some 2 miles further, he was more
successful; he not only found a good landing place but a native
well in a thicket round the north end of some low sand-hills
running from S.W. to N.E., at a distance of about a mile from the
shore. Here too he had his first interview with the sea-coast
tribe, and obtained many words from them. The mode of salutation,
as evinced by these natives, is the putting of the hand upon the
head of the individual saluted. After refilling the water kegs,
and stowing them in the boat on Thursday morning, he ascended the
sand-hills; he found their height above the sea to be about 70
feet. From the summit he obtained a good view of the eastern
shore of the Bay which is fringed with a mangrove belt&mdash;and
at low water he was enabled by a series of bearings to determine
the line of the Bay which is dry at low water; he also secured
compass and other observations to fix the position of the summit
itself. This done, he sailed to the head of the Bay but could see
no land eastward owing to the dense mangrove belt. Land on the
northern shore, however, was always in sight. He tried to reach
the sand-hills towards evening, but the tide failing, a fire was
kindled near the boat and the night passed there, about 3½ miles
N.E. of the sand-hills. On Friday, May 13th, he returned to the
sand-hills and with one of the crew slept on shore; two of the
natives had promised to remain with them, but during the night
they disappeared. On Saturday one of the boat's crew left the
party to walk back to the Depot camp, and another interview with
the natives took place. Before the boat was afloat, one of the
natives (there were eight of them collected together at the time)
was detected in the act of stealing the boat's crutches and
burying them in the sand; but upon perceiving he was discovered,
the stolen property was restored. A strong S.E. wind blowing in
the afternoon, the boat, under sail, left the beach to the north
of the sand-hills, and without further difficulty reached a point
due north of the first mentioned inlet; then the tide left her
high and dry for the night. During the night the tide did not
rise high enough to float the boat; but on the afternoon of the
next day (Sunday, 15th May,) the boat floated once more, and by
8.30 p.m. she was safely alongside the schooner. Position of
watering place. Long. E. 122 deg. 17 min., lat. S. 18 deg. 15
min. 20 sec. Height above the sea 18 feet.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><span class="aa">Tuesday</span>,
17th May.</div>
<p>(196.)&mdash;At 7.30 a.m. we left camp No. 8 and travelled in
a S.W. direction for ten miles when at noon we reached Church
Hill. The country passed, over is still the same; well grassed,
red loamy soil, with thickly growing but small trees. All along
our route kangaroos were numerous and game of all sorts abundant.
We halted at the eastern base of Church Hill. The summit of this
hill is about 190 feet above the mean sea level; it is merely a
pile of irregularly disposed stones, conglomerates of coarse old
red sandstone with here and there a stratum of gritty white
sandstone, stained with oxides of iron or containing deposits of
specular iron ore. On descending by the western side of the hill
out-cropping beds of Tilestones of the upper silurian period were
crossed; they were evenly bedded and disposed in layers beneath
the sparse old red sandstone conglomerate. At a lower point in
the hill, where recent weathering effects had caused a rather
large land-slip, and where the generally luxuriant vegetation
clothing the hill was arrested for a time,&mdash;associated,
fragments of a slightly micaceous sandy shale and thin bedded
soft argillaceous sandstone, banded of a violet, and in some
instances of a purple color, were exposed. Time did not admit of
a close examination on the spot; but I believe all to be
unfossiliferous. Some interesting examples of a honey-combed
greenish gray sandstone were also collected at the same spot.
This hill although small, is a beautiful instance of
circumdenudation; in some cavern-like spaces near the summit,
water-worn pillars supporting arches; equally water-worn formed
miniature grottoes. One was so picturesque as to claim the taking
of an imperfect outline. Even here in the crevices and in holes
filled with eroded particles not yet sufficiently disintegrated
to form a soil, the bean, convolvulus, and the beautiful abrus,
so characteristic, of north-west Australian districts, grew as
luxuriantly, although no water appeared in the vicinity, as in
the plentifully watered valleys of the Glenelg.</p>
<p>(197.)&mdash;At 5 p.m. we re-saddled the horses, and travelled
along the coast, for a distance of 4½ miles, to a spot where a
series of now perfectly dry, short creeks, empty themselves into
the sea-through deep ravines in a coarse light red sand-stone
formation; dip 10 deg. S.E. Down these ravines the summer
torrents rush with immense velocity. In one place, a mere rivulet
had worn in the solid rock, a circular hole about 7 feet across
and 12 feet deep; at the bottom, in a less compact stratum, a
water-course wound its way by an underground channel to the sea.
We sought water in these ravines for a short time, but without
success; night coming on we selected a bare stony place and then
encamped with very indifferent feed for the horses. The ground
passed over from the Church Hill to our present camp, being hear
the sea-coast, and broken up by ravines and stony hills to the
summit of the sea-coast range, did not offer grazing capabilities
equal to those of the country further inland; at our camp
to-night, for instance, it was a difficult matter to find a
suitable tether for more than two horses within a range of 100
yards of the camp fire. Camp No. 9, Long. E. 122 deg. Lat. S. 18
deg. 24 min. Height above the sea 85 feet.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><span class=
"aa">Wednesday</span>, 18th May.</div>
<p>(198.)&mdash;About 2 a.m. "Tommy," the pack-horse, being tied
up short to a dead tree, broke away with two halters on, and in
the morning of course he was nowhere to be seen. There was time,
whilst search was being made for the missing horse, to re-examine
the ravines. In the sections, which are here and there
perpendicular, search was made for fossil remains, but in vain.
Large cuboidal blocks, twenty feet and more in the sides, lie,
where the banks slope, at every angle of inclination: these
masses are detached by the undermining effects of the summer
rains. The ravines are about 80 feet in depth and consist of
coarse red, and while sand-stone rocks; the latter not greatly
dissimilar to the Upper Ludlow rocks, and the former, a coarse
red sand-stone, belongs to the upper silurian period. There is a
singular absence of Coleoptera throughout the district, which I
can only attribute to the earliness of the season for flowers of
both trees and shrubs. Only two species of Curculionidæ and one
Carabus have as yet been found.</p>
<p>(199.)&mdash;At 8 a.m. we started again, leaving the missing
horse to find his way back to the Dépôt; his pack-saddle we left
at the camp. We made a very zigzag course, as we were in search
of water; at 11 a.m. we halted at a native well in the bed of a
dry water-course, about a mile from the sea, at a spot where,
when the stream runs, there is a fall of about 14 feet, over some
rocks into a sandy basin, ten yards in diameter. The water mark
shews that during the rainy season there is a pool here 5 feet in
depth. From this place it winds its way, by a serpentine course,
through a small flat, when at a distance of a few hundred yards
it meets a similar stream, and uniting, they pursue their way
together into the sea. Although finding these native wells has
been a difficult task to us, they must certainly be very
numerous, or the country could not support so great a number of
natives as we find here. From any little eminence, native fires
can in general be seen all round the horizon. Another reason for
supposing the number of wells to be large, may be inferred from
their size; they are all so small as to afford only just
sufficient space, in the case of the deep ones, for a man to
creep down and reach his hand to the water&mdash;whilst the
shallow wells are holes barely large enough to dip out the water
with a small shell. The aborigines of this district, whether
stationary, travelling, or hunting, from the nature of the
climate, and from the food they eat,&mdash;(the sea-coast tribes
subsist chiefly on shell-fish)&mdash;must require a plentiful
supply of this necessary; finding them located here in such great
numbers and scattered about the country in small groups is
evidence of their abundant water-supply. In the case of the
little well near to which we are now resting, it is so situated
that one might pass within a few yards of it in any direction
without detecting the slightest sign of anything of the kind,
save natives' tracks. Another and larger well was dug here close
to the one first found; at a depth of 4 feet, as much water was
obtained as was required, but it was so strongly impregnated with
iron that when our cocoa was made it was as black as ink, though
not disagreeable to the taste.</p>
<p>(200.)&mdash;Several additions were made to the botanical
collection; that of Natural History was increased only by some
unios and land shells, e.g., Helix (Corocolla, nearest species)
with brown bands, Lymnæus, Physa Novæ Hollandiæ, Planorbis,
Succinea and Clausilia. It is perhaps worthy of remark that as in
the Glenelg district the presence of permanent fresh water,
either on the surface or at a very trifling depth below it, is
indicated by the presence of the palm and white acacia, so here
in every instance, where we find water, there all round grow the
abrus and the yellow hybiscus. The palm, baobab, and white acacia
are wholly wanting here: Collier Bay seems to be the southern
limit to their growth, so far at least inland as the country
lying within 50 miles of the sea-coast. Camp No. 10, Long. E. 121

<p>(201.)&mdash;At 3.30 p.m., we were again en route. We
travelled mostly through the thickets, which run parallel to the
sea-coast line, until 7.30 p.m. when we camped for the night,
with short tethers for the horses but with plenty of grass. Our
motive for diverging from our course was the hope of striking the
native track from Roebuck Bay to Lagrange Bay, as it would be
easier travelling than our present line. However, finding it went
too far inland, we intend to resume our own course to-morrow. The
native tracks are well beaten paths, traversing the district,
where the locality will admit, in nearly right lines. Camp No.

<p>(202.)We left camp at 7 a.m. and travelled about S.W. till 11
a.m. when we struck the sea-beach, having walked about 12 miles,
4 only of which were on our course. All our route lay through
thickets as last night, none of which were dense, and all were
tolerably well grassed. Here we made our noonday halt. Camp No.

<p>(203.)&mdash;On the road hither a new curculio, and a carabus
were caught: the former on an acacia bush, the latter on the
wing. Underneath the bark of a small Eucalyptus we found several
gaily colored scutata closely resembling the Callideæ, an
undescribed genus whose fully developed scutellum serves as a
sheath for the protection of the wings; this genus being first
found in the Glenelg district is named Glenelgidæ:&mdash;four
species are already included in this genus. Near the sea-beach,
between the sand-hills, there was a beautiful specimen of the
post-pliocene epoch, an accumulation of sand, shell, and corals,
entire and in fragments, including only species now living in the
adjacent ocean, in process of conversion into a hard stone by
solutions of carbonate of lime, &amp;c. It is 10 inches in length
and 2 inches in diameter: it was found upright in the surface
sand; of course it has been brought to its present site by some
native whose attention may have been drawn to it, perhaps, by a
bright red pecten on the top of it. It is a beautiful example,
containing quartz sand both angular and water-worn, fragments of
secondary sandstone, garnet grains, univalve, bivalve and
multivalve shells, the calcareous polypidoms of several Polyzoæ,
various corals, &amp;c.</p>
<p>(204)&mdash;At 3 p.m. we started again and travelled for two
hours within the line of sand-hills, on level country, but with
more scrub than grass. At the end of a long flat towards the
hilly land forming Cape Latouche Treville, the northernmost head
of Lagrange Bay, we encamped near a native well, which on being
cleared out and enlarged, yielded plenty of excellent water both
for men and horses. The flat was covered with beans, the abrus,
and dwarf acacia. Two old native women and a man were fishing on
a reef close by. One of the former was afterwards caught and led
down to the fire, not without much opposition on her part. The
poor creature evidently expected we were going to eat her, nor
could we by our little presents induce her to dismiss her fears;
but after a short time, when she found she was free to depart,
she required no second intimation to sidle off and eventually
disappear. She was a miserable specimen of the genus homo: with
short grey hair, remarkably long and large upper lip,
disproportionately small chin, thin shrivelled legs, and a body
bearing evidences of scanty and unwholesome food for many a year
past. Her load was made up principally of bivalve shell-fish,
mussels predominating. All our presents she threw away very soon
after she left us.</p>
<p>(205.)&mdash;Flocks of small pigeons flew about the will, but
as our shot was large, they were difficult to kill;
notwithstanding this, we obtained 11 as a contribution to our
evening meal. A burrowing owl, not unlike the Athene cunicularia,
was shot in the morning. From tracks on the ground, I am led to
believe it inhabits the holes made by the burrowing marsupials,
whose excavations here are very numerous. Soon after sunset we
lost no time in seeking our welcome beds, having first placed our
saddles for pillows, and dug up soft spots in the sand to form
sleeping places, as luxurious to the explorer as the down bed to
the fire-side traveller. Camp No. 13. Long. E. 121 deg. 53 min.

feet.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><span class="aa">Friday</span>,
20th May.</div>
<p>(206.)&mdash;In the early morning only 13 pigeons were shot
for breakfast. At 8 a.m. we left the horses to feed at Camp No.
13, and started on a pedestrian trip to the high land on Cape
Latouche Treville, bearing N.W. and distant 4 miles. For the
first three miles we walked along the beach; there were plenty of
good dead shells, but our means of carrying them to the ship
being limited, we were content to pick up a few small examples of
rare Trochus, Strombus, and Spondylus. We then crossed the
sand-hills where an out-jutting post-tertiary sandstone rock gave
easier footing than the loose sand of the dunes, and climbed two
or three little hills covered with the long runners of the
Convolvulus and the bean; we then ascended a conical hill, 90
feet above the mean sea level. As this, the highest land hear,
gave us no view to the southward, we started off to another red
hummock, distant about ¾ of a mile. From this point which is 180
feet above the sea, the highest summit on the neck of land
forming Cape Latouche Treville, we gained an excellent view of
Lagrange Bay,&mdash;all round its coast line to Cape Bossut and
Casuarina Reef. It is a much smaller Bay than we were led to
expect from the space left vacant on the charts; it is also very
shallow, and no considerable stream falls into the sea by this
Bay. We could see the clumps of mangroves at its head, looking
like a number of small green islands; and beyond these a broad
belt of treeless plains; these are bounded by a fringe of
cajeputi trees, precisely as is the case with Roebuck Bay. The
country adjoining these plains is perfectly level, and, as far as
we could see, has the same kind of soil, trees, and grass as the
rest of the district. To the east and south the same level
country extends to the horizon, without any variation of color in
the foliage to indicate a chance in the soil. Drawing a line from
Cape Latouche Treville to Cape Bossut, the head of the Bay is in
no place distant more than 4 miles. In future times, when this
country is occupied by the settler, a ship will have to anchor 3
or 4 miles away from Lagrange Bay to land or receive cargo, which
must be transferred between the ship and the shore in flats
drawing but little water. Stock, too, in all the places we have
visited, could be landed much better and safer in flats than by
swimming or by the ordinary boats. We returned to camp at noon,
the solar radiation thermometer reading 124 deg.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><span class="aa">Saturday</span>,
21st May.</div>
<p>(207.)&mdash;We commenced our return journey to Roebuck Bay at
7 a.m. Crossing the sand-hills we walked along the beach as far
as our old camp No. 12. Thence we travelled on the inland side of
the dunes to a bold Cape forming the northern termination of the
beautiful bay north of Cape Latouche Treville. We halted here at
10 a.m. for a short time to obtain a series of angles and admire
the coast scenery; this cape, situate between Latouche Treville
and Gourdon, I have named Cape Du Boulay, after our fellow
traveller Arthur Du Boulay, who has ever been ready to promote
the objects of this expedition. With the exception of one more
halt (at station 14) of an hour's duration, from 1 to 2 p.m. we
walked till 3 p.m. when we reached Camp No. 10 of our outward
journey, and found the yield of water in the well in no way
diminished. Kangaroos, Turkeys, many kinds of parrots,
Parrakeets, Pigeons, Cockatoos, Cranes&mdash;Ardea Antigone and
A. Scopacia&mdash;and Crows, are numerous everywhere between
Lagrange Bay and Cape Villaret. Soon after we arrived upon our
old camping ground, we dined on a compound stew of Kangaroo and
Turkey, cooked in one vessel. We journeyed no further to-day; the
night passed pleasantly in our sheltered nook, with the brightest
moonlight, clearest sky, and balmy air.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><span class="aa">Sunday</span>,
22nd May.</div>
<p>(208.)&mdash;At 7 a.m. we left the native well and kept a
course seaward of our outward track. We found but little
difficulty in crossing the ravines, so long as we travelled near
the sea-coast line. This line offers no impediment in the shape
of thickets; but walking over the low myrtle scrub is rather hard
work. We arrived at the Barn Hill at 10 a.m., and rested there a
quarter of an hour, during which time I found a new dwarf acacia
in flower; we then walked to the Dépôt Camp near Cape Villaret,
which we reached easily in two hours. Here the missing horse
"Tommy" was accounted for; he made his way back to the dépôt the
morning after we lost him. Several times during our walk from
Camp 10 we crossed his tracks, so that we were not surprised to
learn the result on reaching the dépôt. After an hour's rest we
went on board the vessel, now anchored about 2 miles from the
shore. We found rest for the remainder of the day very
acceptable. We have travelled fully 250 miles during the past 13
days: all of which distance was done on foot by the whole of the
party, myself excepted:&mdash;I may perhaps have ridden
altogether 20 miles, but certainly not more.</p>
<p>(209.)&mdash;Our land Exploration is now finished; the results
so far as pastoral interests are concerned, are these, no mean
additions to the present limited area of known pastoral lands
within the boundaries of Western Australia:</p>

<p>Dampier's Land, as far north as Cape Borda, from the sea, and
we sailed for 5 days within a very short distance of the coast,
appears better grassed even than DeWitt's Land. If we include
this and suppose it to be not inferior to the land in the Roebuck
Bay district, which we have actually travelled over, the total
will amount to 5,592,000 acres fit to be used for runs for
3,336,000 sheep. All the land we have seen in this district is
equal to the average of the stations in Champion Bay district;
and this country possesses those two very important advantages
over the present settled districts of Western Australia: (1)
there are no sand plains (2) there is no astrolobium or poison
plant,&mdash;the bane of the Southern sheep-runs.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><span class="aa">Monday</span>,
23rd May.</div>
<p>(210.)&mdash;All day long every one was occupied in making
preparations for to-morrow, when we hope to start on our homeward
route. The horses were brought off safely at low tide in the
afternoon without much difficulty although the ship was further
from the shore than when they were landed; still the vessel was
as near as it was prudent to take her.</p>
<p>(211.)&mdash;Several live specimens of the Echinus whose
coriaceous integuments divested of their spinous armature we have
found so frequently on this coast, were brought on board; these
Echini are remarkable for the delicate and transparent nature of
their spines; they are not thicker than hogs' bristles, but
exceedingly tough and so sharply pointed that the incautious
handler is soon surprised, if not aggrieved. The longest spines
are three inches in length. A 25 rayed Asterias, of a black
color, and also an Aphrodita, or sea-mouse, were, brought on
board. The latter marine annelide is oval and aculeated as to its
figure; it is 3 inches long and of a dull red metallic
lustre.</p>

<p>(212.)&mdash;At early dawn the dépôt camp was broken up, and
the remainder of the party and stores re-embarked. At 8 a.m. we
set sail, homeward hound, with a light but favorable wind. At
noon we were abreast of Cape Gourdon in long. E. 121 deg. 54 min.
and lat. S. 18 deg. 10 min. (14 fathoms; sand.) At 5 p.m. Cape
Latouche Treville bore S.E. by S. ½ S. and was distant 11 miles.
During the afternoon the wind was very light, but at 7 p.m. it
went round to the S.E., and freshened a little. In the afternoon
we saw a remarkably still line of water across our course,
presenting all the appearance of a shallow or bank nearly awash.
The ship's course was changed and soundings taken: finding we had
12½ fathoms we resumed our course and the motionless water was
sailed through. It may have been the meeting of the tidal waves,
for directly after passing the line there was a strong tide
ripple; it was about the hour of the day when Such an effect
might be expected here.</p>
<p>(213.)&mdash;To-day I obtained a rather large specimen of the
Mantidæ. It is 8.9 inches long and 0.53 inch in diameter, at the
largest part of the body. Its expanse of wing, posterior pair, is
6 inches. The body is of a cinerious to hue; the legs, of a
chrome yellow color with bright emerald green markings, extending
to the spinous processes with which they are armed. The first
pair of wings measure in length 1.22 inch; the breadth is 0.45
inch; these are of a dull green color. The upper parts of the
posterior wings are green tinted with lilac; on the under aide
there is a broad band of a crimson hue; the transparent parts of
the wings have the nervures tinted with brilliant emerald green,
the smaller reticulations are of the same color but of a lighter
tint. The head, antennæ, and tail, are banded with green and
yellow.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><span class=
"aa">Wednesday</span>, 25th May.</div>
<p>(214.)&mdash;We had a fair wind from the setting in of the
S.E. wind, throughout the night. At noon we were in long. E. 120
deg. 3 min. and lat. S. 18 deg. 41 min. During the morning the
wind went round to the E.; this entails a certain amount of
disagreeables consequent upon the rolling of the vessel. A
meridian altitude of Spica Virginis shortly after; 9 o'clock in
the evening gave our latitude in S. 18 deg. 52 min.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><span class="aa">Thursday</span>,
26th May.</div>
<p>(215.)&mdash;At 4 a.m. the minimum thermometer on deck, and
the thermometer in shade read 80 deg. We had a fair wind all day:
but towards sundown its force decreased a little. At noon, we
were in Long. E. 118 deg. 37 min. and Lat. S. 19 deg. 1 min.,
Bedout Island being distant about 40 miles and bearing S.S.E.
Sunset was attended with much refraction; the sun's image was
greatly lengthened vertically so as to give an outline of the
disk not unlike a balloon. The sea in the evening displayed a
great number of phosphorescent creatures.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><span class="aa">Friday</span>,
27th May.</div>
<p>(216.)&mdash;The wind has been in our favor all night. The
prevailing wind in this latitude, in the months of June, August,
and May seems to be included between the S.E. and N.E. points of
the compass. In the present month it veers from S.E. in the
morning to N.E. during the afternoon: backing to S.E. between the
hours of 6-9 p.m. We sailed over the meridian of Nickol Bay at 10
a.m., at a distance of 118 miles of Latitude to the north of it.
At noon we were in Long. E. 116 deg 25 min., and lat. S. 19 deg.
28 min., Rosemary Island, one of Dampier's Archipelago, bearing S
by E distant 58 miles. To-night our colored lamps are displayed,
as it is thought there may be some whaling vessels cruising about
here.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><span class="aa">Saturday</span>,
28th May.</div>
<p>(217.)&mdash;In the course of the morning we sailed past
Ritchie's Reef, leaving it a few miles to the S., but we did not
see it; it would not now be seen on account of the smoothness of
the sea, unless the intervening distance were less than 4 miles.
At noon our Long. was E. 114 deg. 40 min., and Lat. S. 20 deg. 26
min.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><span class="aa">Sunday</span>,
29th May.</div>
<p>(218.)&mdash;At day-break we saw the high land on the
promontary to the westward of Exmouth Gulf; the schooner being,
at the time nearly abreast of N.W. Cape, Vlaming Head being only
10 Miles distant. At noon our Long was E. 113 deg. 32 min. 30
sec., and Lat. S. 22 deg. 19 min. Towards 4 p.m. we obtained
bearings of Point Cloates. During the evening we perceived the
first warning of our departure from the region of cloudless
skies; across the south horizon a dense bank of rapidly rising
stratus came upwards and onwards towards the north; until one by
one each glittering star became first dim, then invisible, until
the whole firmament became of a lead-colored line. At the Service
read in the evening only five attended, although the vessel was
sailing so steadily as to give no inconvenience whatever to those
walking up and down for exercise.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><span class="aa">Monday</span>,
30th May.</div>
<p>(219.)&mdash;In the a.m. the sun's place was visible only for
a few minutes, and those happened just at the usual time of
taking the early morning altitude. At noon we were in Long. E.
112 deg. 45 min., and Lat. 24 deg. 21 min. To-day our storm suit
of sails were bent and everything made ready for rough weather
which may now be expected, although no barometrical indications
of a gale from the N.W. have as yet been registered; on the
contrary, the readings of the past few days, considering the
moon's age, 24 days, have been so unusually high as to indicate
strong southerly rather than northerly winds. In the course of
the day we sighted Bernier, Dorrée, and Dirk Hartog Islands.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><span class="aa">Tuesday</span>,
31st May.</div>
<p>(220.)&mdash;An overcast sky prevailed throughout the day.
Dense cumulus and cumulonus spread over the sky. At noon our
position by dead-reckoning was in Long. E. 112 deg. 25 min., and
Lat. S. 26 deg. 32 min. In the after noon we had rain and squalls
from the N.N.W. The rain angle at 5 p.m. was 44 deg. from the
N.W.; the temperature of the rain was 71 deg., or 5 deg. lower
than the temperature of the atmosphere at the same time. The
force of one squall at 7.30 p.m. was estimated at 10. The vessel
was then put under close reefed fore and aft canvass for the
night.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><span class=
"aa">Wednesday</span>, 1st June.</div>
<p>(221.)&mdash;The weather is still very overcast. Indifferent
sights were obtained at 9 a.m. and at noon. Our approximate
position is in long. E. 112 deg. 38 min. and lat. S. 28 deg. 38
min: at noon, about 45 miles to the westward of the Abrolhos.
About 2 p.m. we passed the latitude of Champion Bay.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><span class="aa">Thursday</span>,
2nd June.</div>
<p>(222.)&mdash;Very heavy squalls all day, at intervals of about
an hour. At noon we were in long. E. 113 deg. 42 min. and lat. 30
deg. 26 Min.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><span class="aa">Friday</span>,
3rd June.</div>
<p>(223.)&mdash;Soon after daylight, land was sighted to the
eastward, but as we were not certain of our exact position as to
a few miles, the vessel was put about until a meridian altitude
could be obtained. At noon our position proved to be in long: S.
114 deg. 41 min. and lat. S. 39 deg. 57 min.; so that the land
seen in the early morning must have been in the neighbourhood of
Mount Lesueur. The rest of the day we stood S.W., contending with
a strong S.E. wind and heavy sea.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><span class="aa">Saturday</span>,
4th June.</div>
<p>(224.)&mdash;During the night the sea went down a little; but
the wind although of lessened force blows steadily from the S.E.
At noon we were in long. E. 113 deg. 28 min. and lat. S,; 32 deg.
3 min.; nearly 120 miles to the westward of our Port.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><span class="aa">Sunday</span>,
5th June.</div>
<p>(225.)&mdash;The wind is more favourable to-day; and from our
position at noon we expect to sight Rottnest Island at 3 p.m.
About 5 minutes before 3 p.m. the island was sighted. At sundown
we were near enough to see the signal flag upon the island. At 8
p.m. we were abreast of the island, and creeping very slowly
along in shore, trying to discover the Fremantle light.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><span class="aa">Monday</span>,
6th June.</div>
<p>(226.)&mdash;But few of us slept during the past night; almost
every hour we heard the <small>LIGHT</small> was sighted, but
each time it was a mistake until 2 a.m. when indeed the actual
light was clearly made out. Two hours afterwards we were at
anchor, and by 8 a.m. we were quietly breakfasting once more on
terra firma,&mdash;thankful for escape from many dangers, and
thankful in having participated in a voyage of great interest,
and one calculated (it is to be hoped) to prove of lasting
benefit not only to this Colony but to the Australian community
at large.</p>

<p><span class="aa">The</span> following is from Mr. Panter's
Journal of the Expedition to the Glenelg from the date of leaving
Champion Bay:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="aa">March</span> 10 1864.&mdash;Weighed anchor
and sailed from Champion Bay for Camden harbour at 6.30 o'clock
a.m. Dr. Martin, who accompanies the Expedition as Surveyor, and
Mr. A. Du Boulay (one of the party), came on board. Wind S.W.;
fresh.</p>
<p><span class="aa">March</span> 11.&mdash;Off Shark's Bay at
noon; cold weather and rolling sea. Wind S.W.; fresh.</p>
<p><span class="aa">March</span> 12.&mdash;Wind S.E.; light.</p>
<p>Sunday, MARCH 13.&mdash;Sighted the N.W. Cape at daylight;
passed out of sight of it at 12 o'clock noon. Head the church
service to all who wished to attend. Wind S.W.; fresh.</p>
<p><span class="aa">March</span> 14.&mdash;Calm from 10 o'clock
a.m. until 10 o'clock p.m., when a light westerly wind sprung up.
Wind W.</p>
<p><span class="aa">March</span> 15.&mdash;Calm from 5 o'clock
a.m. until 8 o'clock a.m. light wind from then until evening.
Wind S E.; very light.</p>
<p><span class="aa">March</span> 16.&mdash;Light wind all day.
Saw several sharks and small sea-snakes, the latter about 5 feet
long. Wind E.; light.</p>
<p><span class="aa">March</span> 17.&mdash;Calm all day; light
wind at 7 o'clock p.m. wind E.</p>
<p><span class="aa">March</span> 18.&mdash;Fresh easterly wind
from 7 o'clock a.m.; died away gradually towards evening. Wind
E.</p>
<p><span class="aa">March</span> 19.&mdash;Blowing a strong
easterly wind; shortened sail at 7 o'clock a.m. heavy sea
running. At 4 o'clock p.m. almost a dead calm. Saw large schools
of black fish. Wind easterly.</p>
<p><span class="aa">March</span> 20.&mdash;Blowing fresh easterly
wind 30 miles N.E. of Bedout Island; read church service to all
who wished to attend. Wind E.</p>
<p><span class="aa">March</span> 21.&mdash;Fresh easterly wind
blowing during the forenoon. At 3 o'clock p.m. sighted Bedout
Island. The wind being very light and almost; dead ahead; we
dropped anchor about three miles south of the Island in 7 fathoms
at low water. Wind E.</p>
<p><span class="aa">March</span> 22.&mdash;Went on shore at 6
o'clock a.m. in the long-boat. Found the island to be covered
with coarse grass and low scrub. Native Moke and one of the
seamen named William Griffiths were nearly drowned to-day in
attempting to reach the long-boat which, was anchored outside the
reef about 1½ mile from the island. Turtle abound in the shallow
water. In about two hours we caught 93. Pelicans are also
numerous. We obtained about 400 of their eggs from a sandy point
above high-water mark. Beans, much resembling in size and taste
the English broad bean, are plentiful. On the centre of the
island there was a pole stuck in the ground, at the foot of which
was found a bottle containing a letter addressed to "Walter
Padbury, Esq.," stating that the cutter <i>Mystery</i>, had
called in there on the 23rd July, 1863. A considerable quantity
of trepang was seen on the reefs at low water; large
tridacna-shells were numerous. Rise and fall of tide 20 feet.</p>
<p><span class="aa">March</span> 23.&mdash;Got underweigh at 5
o'clock a.m. with a fair but very light wind. The prisoner
Wildman had an epileptic fit, at 6.30. o'clock a.m. Wind died
away about 3 o'clock p.m., at which time the strong current had
drifted the schooner back within 6 miles of the island. I omitted
to state yesterday that I left a bottle in lieu of the one found
at Bedout Island, containing a piece of paper, on which I stated
that Mr. Padbury's letter had been received, also stating that
the <i>New Perseverance</i> had called in there.</p>
<p><span class="aa">March</span> 24.&mdash;Fair wind at 4 o'clock
a.m., which freshened a little towards sunrise, and died away
again at noon. Wind S.E.</p>
<p><span class="aa">March</span> 25.&mdash;Very light wind all
night, which died away about 1 o'clock p.m. Caught a sea-snake, 5
feet long. Wind E.</p>
<p><span class="aa">March</span> 26.&mdash;Light and variable
wind. Caught 5 sharks. Wind variable.</p>
<p><span class="aa">March</span> 27.&mdash;Fair but very light
wind. At 9. 45. o'clock a.m. sighted the highest part of
Dampier's Land, bearing about East. Could see smoke in several
places along the beach. Read the church service. Wind S.E.</p>
<p><span class="aa">March</span> 28.&mdash;Passed the Lacepede
Islands, At 9 o'clock a.m. abreast of "Sandy Point." Judging from
the number of fires the natives must be very numerous on
Dampier's Land. Anchored at 8 o'clock p.m. last night as there
was no wind, and a strong current. Got under-weigh again at 4
o'clock a.m. Wind Easterly. Threw a bottle over board this
morning containing a slip of paper on which was written the
ship's position &amp;c., passed Cape Emeriau about 11 o'clock
a.m. Last night fires were lighted all along the beach for many
miles by the natives.</p>
<p><span class="aa">March</span> 29.&mdash;Last night we had a
narrow escape from shipwreck. The following are the
circumstances:&mdash;About 2 o'clock p.m. we sighted Caffarelli
Island, in long.&mdash; &mdash; deg., lat. 15 deg. 58 min.
Towards evening the wind, which had been light all day, slightly
increased, and that the vessel was steering a course between
Caffarelli Island and the Brue Bock. Two men were on the look
out. At 8.20 o'clock p.m. I was talking to the Captain on the
deck house, when his attention was called to what appeared to be
a tide ripple. He ordered, the foresail to be taken in, and told
the second mate, who was at the wheel, to mind the vessel was not
taken aback. A few seconds afterwards she struck upon a reel; had
she struck the reef in any other place than the spot she did her
doom, and ours would have been sealed, in a few short minutes.
This reef is not laid down on any of the charts, it extends about
six miles S.S.E. from Caffarelli Island. In about five minutes
after the vessel struck she was backed off the reef and anchored
about ½ a mile from it in 25; fathoms. The night was so dark and
cloudy that we could not tell what sort of a place we were in
until daylight this morning.</p>
<p><span class="aa">March</span> 30.&mdash;Last night was bad
enough, but to-day was ten fames worse. At 8 o'clock a.m. the
wind was blowing a heavy gale and at 10 o'clock a.m. had reached
the force of a hurricane. Surrounded almost as the vessel was by
the reef, she could sot get underweigh without imminent, danger;
therefore the captain determined to remain at anchor as long as
possible. When the wind was at its highest pitch, one of the
anchors was lost with fifty fathoms of chain. The large anchor
was then found to be dragging. Everything was ready to slip the
cable but luckily the anchor got fresh hold and held the vessel,
which was straining heavily, until the wind abated. At times the
wind blew with such force that it was almost impossible to stand
on deck. Wind S.E.</p>
<p><span class="aa">March</span> 31.&mdash;The wind abated about
2.30 o'clock this morning. At daylight there was only a fresh
breeze. At 11 o'clock a.m. got under weigh, and in two hours were
out of sight of the place, that a few hours before had threatened
destruction to us all. During the afternoon passed several small
islands belonging to the Buccaneer Archipelago. Threw a bottle
overboard, containing our longitude and latitude written on a
piece of paper; also stating our reasons for anchoring at such an
infernal place as "Treacherous Reef," which I think is as good a
name as it can receive. The above reef is covered at high tide,
and has been correctly laid down on the chart. Wind S.E.</p>
<p><span class="aa">April</span> 1.&mdash;About 2 o'clock this
morning large quantities of seaweed were observed floating near
the vessel; she was hove to, and soundings taken, which resulted
in 16 fathoms. The anchor was let go. At daylight the Beagle Bank
was visible, about 1½ mile astern. Got underweight at 6 o'clock
a.m.; at 3 o'clock sighted the Champagny Islands. Served out the
firearms, in order to get them cleaned. Gave strict orders to
each man not to allow the prisoner to touch or use them. Dropped
anchor at 7.40. o'clock p.m. Wind S.S.E.</p>
<p><span class="aa">April</span> 2.&mdash;Wind blowing fresh
during the night. At daylight this morning could see Augustus
Island, bearing due east from where the vessel was at anchor. At
6.30 o'clock a.m. got underweigh. At 3 o'clock p.m. made out the
entrance to Camden Harbour. At 6.40 o'clock p.m. took soundings
which resulted in 18 fathoms. Anchored at 7 p.m. The prisoner
applied to Captain Owston to look at the chart, which was of
course refused. Wind E.S.E.</p>
<p><span class="aa">April</span> 3.&mdash;Got underweigh at
daylight. At 11.30 o'clock entered the south passage into Camden
Harbour. At 1.40. o'clock dropped anchor in Brecknock Harbour. As
no vessel has ever entered Camden. Harbour before, it would be
well to state that we had no difficulty in sailing from the
entrance nearly to the head of Brecknock Harbour. There are
numerous small islands in this harbour, which are covered with
oysters below high-water mark. At 7 o'clock p.m. read church
service to those who wished to attend.</p>
<p><span class="aa">April</span> 4.&mdash;Started at daylight
this morning in the whale-boat to look for a suitable place to
land the horses. Returned at 12 o'clock noon. At 1 o'clock p.m.,
the vessel got underweigh, and proceeded to within ½ a mile of
the head of the harbour. At 3 o'clock p.m. swam the horses
onshore; one of them (Prince) lame. At low water the vessel was
aground within 50 yards of the beach. It was then ascertained
that she had received considerable damage through striking
Treacherous Reef, and riding at anchor the day following during
the hurricane. To-morrow she will be placed on a small sandy
island at high water to undergo the necessary repairs.</p>
<p><span class="aa">April</span> 5.&mdash;Formed a depot camp on
the banks of a small creek running into the N.E. end of Brecknock
Harbour. Placed the prisoner in irons, owing to his gross
misconduct, and chained him to a tree at the camp.</p>
<p><span class="aa">April</span> 6.&mdash;Left depot camp at 8
o'clock a.m. with a party consisting of Dr. Martin, Mr. David
Shields, the first mate of the vessel, native Dunedale, and four
horses. After travelling 12 miles E N.E., camped under Mount
Double Cone. Tommy (Dunedale) and myself went during the
afternoon to the top of the smallest Cone. The land we travelled
over to-day was as rich pastoral land as could be imagined. I
don't think we travelled two miles during the day without coming
to either springs or running water. Distance 12 miles.</p>
<p><span class="aa">April</span> 7.&mdash;Left Tommy in charge of
the horses, &amp;c., and proceeded at daylight to the top of
Mount Double Cone. As far as the eye could reach, nothing but the
richest pastoral land could be seen, intersected by numerous
running streams. Found on this Mount large blocks of stone,
containing copper ore. Re turned to camp at 9 o'clock a.m. At 10
o'clock a.m. started in the direction of Mount King. Owing to the
numerous creeks, we were unable to make a straight course. At S
o'clock p.m. camped at a small creek about ½ a mile from the
Gairdner River. On the banks of this river the yellow hybiscus
grows in great profusion. The country passed over to-day could
not be surpassed. Many of the large flats were composed of rich
black soil, well watered by running streams. On some of these
flats the convolvulus (two kinds) grows like a weed, in many in
stances the stems or runners attaining a length of 40 or 50
yards. Kangaroo tracks were numerous, but owing to the height of
the grass, but few were seen. During the afternoon we passed an
old native encampment. Judging from the number of old fire
places, &amp;c., I should think there must have been between 400
and 500 natives together. Distance travelled to-day 20 miles.</p>
<p><span class="aa">April</span> 8.&mdash;Left camp at 6.40.
o'clock a.m. for Mount King. Again to-day we were unable to make
a straight course, but the ground was not so stony as that of
yesterday. At 10 o'clock a.m. came to a small river about 50
yards wide. As I wanted to examine this river, I determined to
camp for the day. Our camp on this river bore due north about 3
miles from the base of Mount King. This river literally swarms
with fish of all sizes and of many different sorts, some of them
much resembling in taste and appearance the Murray cod of
Victoria. It is a tidal river, the rise and fall of tide being 10
feet; the water is perfectly fresh at both high and low tide; it
rises in the sea-coast ranges, and flows into the Glenelg, or
rather into some large swamps which empty into the Glenelg. The
Gairdner River also runs into these swamps. Boats of a
considerable size (15 to 20 tons) might be used on either of
these rivers, thus affording water communication to the Glenelg;
and from thence to the sea. The country passed over to-day
similar to that of yesterday. Distance 10 miles.</p>
<p><span class="aa">April</span> 9.&mdash;Left Tommy in charge of
the horses, &amp;c., and started at 6. 30. o'clock a.m. for the
top of Mount King, which we reached at 9. o'clock, after six
miles' hard walking. From the top of this lull or mount we had a
splendid view of the surrounding country; nothing could exceed
its rich appearance: grass grows most luxuriantly to the very top
of Mount King. The Glenelg runs about; 3 miles from the southern
base of this mount, and certainly is a fine river,
notwithstanding its low mangrove banks. This evening Tommy shot 4
whistling ducks. Distance 15 miles.</p>
<p><span class="aa">April</span> 10.&mdash;Left camp at 6 30.
o'clock a.m. in the direction of Brecknock Harbour, but taking a
fresh route from our outward one. At 1 o'clock p.m. camped about
5 miles S.E. of the depot camp. During this trip I saw several
specimens of the following fruits:&mdash;melons, about the size
of a pigeon's egg; black grapes, growing in clusters; and each
berry about as large as a common sized revolver bullet, if
anything a little larger. Those we found were quite ripe and
sweet tasted. Beans are plentiful and most prolific bearers; red
peas do. do. Celery grows almost everywhere. Cocoa
Tree&mdash;this only bears a small capsule. The principal birds
seen&mdash;Ducks, geese, cranes, (very large), pigeons, (4
different kinds), doves, cockatoos, parrots, small magpies,
wattle birds, a bird very much resembling in size and appearance
the English hen pheasant and many other small birds of the most
brilliant plumage, but too numerous to mention. The principal
trees seen were as follows&mdash;Baobab, averaging 20 feet in
diameter; eucalyptus, acacia, palm (sure sign of water), stunted
pines, and cyprus. Alligators, snakes and guanos, the only
reptiles seen, and these scarce. I saw no poison plant, at least
that I recognised as such.</p>
<p><span class="aa">April</span> 11.&mdash;Arrived at depot camp
at 8.30 o'clock. Came on board at 11 o'clock a.m.; found that the
ship's cook had received serious injury from a block falling from
the topsail-yard, and striking him on the back; also found that
the vessel was still undergoing repairs. Distance 5 miles.</p>
<p><span class="aa">April</span> 12.&mdash;Yesterday evening the
vessel dragged her anchor for a short distance, and at low water
was high and dry. I am afraid we shall be detained here for some
days before the vessel is ready for sea.</p>
<p><span class="aa">April</span> 13.&mdash;Brought the horses
from depot camp to opposite where the vessel was lying.</p>
<p><span class="aa">April</span> 14.&mdash;Went to the top of
Mount Lookover. Found that iron, some of it almost in its pure
state, existed from its base to the summit. Shot two pheasants in
a thicket going up the hill. This evening, at high water, the
vessel was found to be making fourteen inches of water in the 24
hours. The principal leak appears not yet to have been found.</p>
<p><span class="aa">April</span> 15.&mdash;Started at 4 o'clock
in the whaleboat to visit the islands outside Camden Harbour. At
9 o'clock a.m. reached Byam Martin's Island, containing about
15,000 acres. This island is well watered and grassed, .but very
stony. On the south end of it there is a small bay, with a fine
sandy beach, where a vessel might undergo repairs, almost as
safely as in a dry dock. Saw large quantities of small pearl
oysters. On the N.E. end of the island there is a small waterfall
where vessels might very easily take in water, as boats could lie
right under it. Saw recent tracks of natives. Camped for the
night on a small island bearing east about two miles from Byam
Martin's.</p>
<p><span class="aa">April</span> 16.&mdash;The little island on
which we camped last night was well watered and grassed. Pulled
round the island at daylight to look if there were any pearl
oysters; could only; find very small ones. At 7 o'clock started
for an island bearing doe east from Byam Martin's about four
miles; found on it good water, but no grass. Started again at
10.30. a.m. and visited several small islands, upon all of which
I found good water, but not all well grassed. At 3.0. p.m. landed
on the east end of Augustus Island. This splendid island,
containing in round numbers 56,320 acres, is well watered by
numerous, small running streams, and the grass is as good on it
as that on the mainland, from which it is separated by Rogers'
Straits. Camped for the night on a small island bearing W.S.W.
about 4 miles from Augustus island. On this little island,
containing about 25 acres, there was plenty of grass, but no
water. Broken cowrie shells were strewed all round the beach,
found a turtle's nest with 62 fresh eggs in it. Like all the rest
of the islands visited; there were recent tracks of natives. They
cross from the main to the islands on a kind of raft made out of
three or four light poles, pegged together.</p>
<p><span class="aa">April</span> 17.&mdash;Started at 8 o'clock
a.m. for an island bearing due north about 7 miles, on which
smoke apparently from natives' fires could be seen. Walked about
ten miles over the island, but could find no natives. This island
is well watered (5 running steams in four miles), and fairly
grassed, but very stony between the hills. There are some narrow
flats composed of rich black soil, but on account of the rough
nature of the ground, they are almost inaccessible. Saw a few
pheasants and plenty of wallaby on the island. At 4 o'clock p.m.
started for a small island ten miles from the entrance to Camden
Harbour. Camped for the night at 6.30 p.m. Distance 36 miles.</p>
<p><span class="aa">April</span> 18.&mdash;.Started at 6 o'clock
a.m. for the ship. Visited three small islands. at the mouth of
the northern entrance to Camden Harbour. Found a turtle's nest on
one of them with 64 fresh eggs in it. Water but no grass on any
of these three islands. Reached the vessel at 3 o'clock p.m.
Distance 16 miles.</p>
<p><span class="aa">April</span> 19.&mdash;The vessel not yet
seaworthy, and no one seems to know when she is likely to be.</p>
<p><span class="aa">April</span> 20.&mdash;Living in hopes that
some day or another we shall be able to sail for Roebuck Bay,
where I expected to have been before this time.</p>
<p><span class="aa">April</span> 21.&mdash;At 9 o'clock p.m.,
(high water). towed the vessel into mid-channel. Found that she
was all right again.</p>
<p><span class="aa">April</span> 22.&mdash;All hands getting wood
and water on board.</p>
<p><span class="aa">April</span> 23.&mdash;Got sheep and horses
on board. This afternoon Mr. Henry Logue met with an accident. He
was firing off the right hand barrel of a carbine, when it burst,
inflicting a severe cut on the left hand.</p>
<p><span class="aa">April</span> 24.&mdash;Got underweigh at 4.30
o'clock a.m. Dropped anchor again at 6 o'clock a.m. on the east
side of a reef in Brecknock harbour. Read the Church service to
all those who wished to attend.</p>
<p><span class="aa">April</span> 25.&mdash;Got underweigh at 5
o'clock a.m. At 8 o'clock a.m. grounded on a rotten coral reef
near the entrance to Camden Harbour. In half an hour got off and
proceeded on our way to Roebuck Bay, leaving behind us one of the
finest countries that could well be imagined. Hitherto I have
emitted to state that large quantities of beans grow Above
high-water mark on all the islands and main land. I have also
omitted to state that Byam Martin's and Augustus Islands are well
timbered. About one mile doe north from Green Island, in
Brecknock Harbour, there is a vein of iron ore. It crops out on
the surface on the side of a mangrove creek. I should think this
ore contains 60 per cent of iron. At 11.30 o'clock p.m. dropped
anchor in 32 fathoms, as the current was drifting us
in-shore.</p>
<p><span class="aa">April</span> 26.&mdash;Got underweigh at 9
o'clock a.m. At 2 o'clock p.m. were abreast of the Cockell
Islands. At 3.30 o'clock p.m. sighted some of the islands
belonging to the Buccaneer Archipelago. At 7 o'clock p.m. dropped
anchor in 22 fathoms, as the current was drifting us towards
King's Sound.</p>
<p><span class="aa">April</span> 27.&mdash;Got underweigh at
daylight. At 11 o'clock a.m. sighted Cape Borda. At 2 o'clock
p.m. dropped anchor in a small bay on the south side of Cape
Borda, in 5½ fathoms; could not land, as the wind was too fresh
and the sea breaking on the reefs in shore; saw several natives,
who came down to the beach. Some of the members of the party
wished to know why the vessel had been brought to anchor, And
also stated that in their opinion they ought to be consulted. I
at once told them that I could not think of doing any thing of
the sort&mdash;that I should use my own judgment in forming
whatever plans I thought proper. From the deck of the vessel the
grass could be seen, apparently growing in as great profusion as
around Camden Harbour. Timber appears plentiful.</p>
<p><span class="aa">April</span> 29.&mdash;Got underweigh at 6.30
o'clock, the weather so unsettled and rough that I did not think
it advisable to land last night; several native fires were
sighted close to the beach. About 1 o'clock p.m. the wind died
away, and the vessel anchored in ten fathoms, about midway
between the Lacepede Islands and the mainland. Let the prisoner
out of Irons, as his behaviour has been good since leaving
Brecknock Harbour.</p>
<p><span class="aa">April</span> 30.&mdash;Got underweigh at
daylight, with a light wind, which lasted till sunset, when the
vessel was anchored in 12 fathoms water, abreast of the Red
Cliffs, on Dampier's Land During the day we sailed at times close
in shore; the land appeared well grassed.</p>
<p><span class="aa">May</span> 1.&mdash;Got underweigh at 10
o'clock a.m. with a very light wind, which lasted till 8 o'clock
p.m., when the vessel was anchored. Saw large shoals of fish;
caught one (coal fish), about 30 lbs weight. Read church service
to those who wished to attend.</p>
<p><span class="aa">May</span> 2.&mdash;Got underweigh at 6.30
o'clock a.m.; fresh breeze sprang up at noon. At 5.30 o'clock
anchored off the mouth of Roebuck Bay, in 7¼ fathoms.</p>
<p><span class="aa">May</span> 3.&mdash;Got underweigh at 12
o'clock noon; scarcely enough wind to enable the vessel to stem
the current. Tried to get into Roebuck Bay (on the north side),
but could not do so, on account of the shallow water. At 5
o'clock p.m. anchored in 5¼ fathoms. Caught four sharks, the
largest 11 feet Jong.</p>
<p><span class="aa">May</span> 4.&mdash;Got underweigh at
daylight; anchored at 3.15 o'clock p.m. off Cape Villaret; at 4
o'clock p.m. I started in the whale-boat to try and find a place
suitable to land the horses. At 6 o'clock p.m. after considerable
difficulty we landed and pulled the boat up above high-water
mark. Camped for the night on the beach.</p>
<p><span class="aa">May</span> 5.&mdash;Started inland at
daylight to look for water; found a native well with plenty of
good water in it about ½ a mile from the beach. Left for the ship
at 12 o'clock noon, arrived at 5.15 o'clock p.m.; found that
there was plenty of water to anchor the vessel within ¾ of a mile
from Cape Villaret (north); took soundings from the shore to the
ship.</p>
<p><span class="aa">May</span> 6.&mdash;Could not get underweigh
until 10.15. o'clock, as there was a strong breeze. Dropped
anchor at 7.15. o'clock p.m. about 1½ mile S.S.E. from Cape
Villaret.</p>
<p><span class="aa">May</span> 7.&mdash;Blowing a strong breeze
all night from the S.W. Went on shore at daylight, to clean out
the native well and form a depot camp. During the afternoon the
vessel came in and anchored within ½ a mile of the shore.</p>
<p><span class="aa">May</span> 8.&mdash;Swam the horses on shore
at low tide; one of them, Prince, still lame. Read the church
service to those who wished to attend.</p>
<p><span class="aa">May</span> 9.&mdash;Getting horses shod, and
everything ready to start inland to-morrow.</p>
<p><span class="aa">May</span> 10.&mdash;Left camp at 8 o'clock
a.m. with Dr. Martin, Mr. D. Shields, M. C. Buck, and native
Tommy: travelled 18 miles over a well-grassed country; at 12
o'clock came to a native well, but could get no water out of it;
sank a shaft close to it, and got good water at 18 feet, but
before we could get water out for the horses, the side caved in.
Mr. Arthur Du Boulay and four hands left the ship this morning in
the whale-boat to explore Roebuck Bay.</p>
<p><span class="aa">May</span> 11.&mdash;Left camp before
sunrise. Came across the tracks of a native woman and child,
which Tommy and myself followed for 3½ miles, at the end of which
distance I found two wells, both containing good water. Made
signals for the rest of the party to come up. About 10 o'clock
a.m. saw a native standing close by an ant-heap; immediately
afterwards saw a lot more. Made signs for them to approach, which
they apparently did not like to do; so we went to meet them, and
they then came towards us. When within range, made signs to them
to throw down their spears, which they did. They remained with us
for about two hours, and became quite friendly. Gave them several
small presents before they left. Altogether there were 19 of
them, and fine, clean, able-bodied men they were. The sight of
one of the horse's teeth struck terror into their hearts. By the
way they clung together, it was evident they thought that the
horse was partial to human flesh. Stopped here for the day,
hoping the natives would return. Distance 9 miles.</p>
<p><span class="aa">May</span> 12.&mdash;Left camp at 6 o'clock
a.m. Travelled 16 miles in an easterly direction. No water, but
plenty of good grass. Four miles out of the above distance was
through a thicket composed mostly of Cyprus trees. Stopped at 11
o'clock a.m.; started again at 3 o'clock p.m.; travelled 11 miles
over a clear well-grassed country; shot a large carpet snake.
Distance 27 miles.</p>
<p><span class="aa">May</span> 13.&mdash;Left camp at daybreak.
Travelled 7 miles over country if anything better grassed than
that passed over yesterday. From the highest trees could see the
same level country as far as the eye could reach, but no water.
As I was sure our time would be too short to enable us to reach
the Fitzroy River, I determined to turn back, in order that we
might go to Lagrange Bay. We had now travelled due east in a
straight line nearly 60 miles. All the country passed over was
good, and I have not the slightest doubt that plenty of water
might be obtained anywhere at a depth of 20 feet at the outside.
I also have every reason to believe that the same level country
as we have passed over extends to the Fitzroy River. Timber is
plentiful, but not large. During the afternoon, whilst following
our tracks to the last wells, came across a large hunting party
of natives. One of them faced M. C. Buck with his spear up (they
threw them from the middle); Buck fired a charge of shot at him,
which frightened more than hurt him as he started off with all
the rest, making the bush resound with the most unearthly yells.
Found a tree where the natives had been taking a bee's nest from;
about a pint of honey was still left in it The bees were not much
larger than a small fly. At 9 o'clock p.m. reached the two wells;
all of us nearly knocked up, after walking 45 miles, without
coming to water. Distance 45 miles.</p>
<p><span class="aa">May</span> 14.&mdash;Remained in camp all
day; cleaned the two wells out, so as to get plenty of water for
the horses. During our absence from these wells, the natives had
burnt the bush around them. This appears to be a usual custom
amongst them. Found this morning the place where some of them had
slept close to us during the night.</p>
<p><span class="aa">May</span> 15.&mdash;Started at 6 o'clock
a.m. towards Roebuck Bay; about 5 miles from the wells came
across a well-beaten natives' path; followed this for 13 miles,
when we came to a good well of water 7 miles north of the depot
camp. Camped for the day. Distance 20 miles.</p>
<p><span class="aa">May</span> 16.&mdash;Followed up the plain on
which we camped last night (Racecourse Plains). At their
commencement these plains are not more than ½ a mile broad, but
at a distance of 12 miles up they are between 7 and 8 miles
broad, and extend, to my certain knowledge, for 25 miles. These
plains (where they have not been lately burned) exceed anything I
have yet seen for both grass and water. They are bounded on the
one side by the bay (Roebuck) and on the south side by a fine
belt of cajeput-trees. All along this belt there is an abundant
supply of pure water, in some places, within a foot of the
surface, and in no one place more than 6 feet below it. It would
be hard to describe finer plains than these, containing, in round
numbers [ ] acres of land, much of which is suited for
agricultural purposes as well as pastoral. On these plains we had
frequent intercourse with the natives, all of whom appeared
friendly and harmless. Their domestic habits very much resemble
those of the pig&mdash;for sleeping places they scrape a hole in
the ground. Pearl oysters and shell fish are their principal
articles of diet (on the sea-coast) The only ornaments they wear
are large pearl shells, ground into an oval shape, and hung round
their necks by a string made out of their own hair. Their weapons
are of the most primitive kind, and consist of spears, kaelys,
dowaks, shields, and stone tomahawks. The sea-coast natives are
not nearly so fine a race of men as those seen inland. These
plains abound with wild turkeys, and cockatoos, and kangaroos are
very plentiful on the outskirts of them. Returned to camp at 8
o'clock p.m. Distance 24 miles.</p>
<p><span class="aa">May</span> 17.&mdash;At 7 o'clock a.m.
started with the same party as before for Lagrange Bay. Reached
the two hummocks at 12 o'clock noon; started again at 4 o'clock
p.m.; camped at 7 o'clock p.m. without water. At the hummocks Mr.
A. Du Boulay joined us, as well as Mr. H. Logue, the latter
unexpectedly. All the ground passed over to-day was well grassed.
Distance 18 miles.</p>
<p><span class="aa">May</span> 18.&mdash;One of our horses got
away during the night, which delayed us until 8 o'clock a.m.,
when we started without him. After travelling 5 miles, came to a
natives' well, where we stopped until 3 o'clock p.m. when we went
on 6 miles further, and camped for the night. Shot four red
kangaroos and a large owl. All the country passed over to-day
well grassed. Distance 12 miles.</p>
<p><span class="aa">May</span> 19.&mdash;Started at daylight.
After travelling 12 miles of a scrubby and thinly-grassed
country, struck the sea beach. At 5.20 o'clock p.m. camped close
to Cape Latouche Treville, which forms the northern boundary of
Lagrange Bay. At the top of the flat on which we camped found a
good well with plenty of pure water in it. During the afternoon,
Shields, myself and Tommy went a-head of the party to look for
water. When within a mile of the well we surprised three natives
(one man and two women) who were gathering shells on a reef; we
tried to catch the man, but after several trials, he got off the
reef, and none of as could catch him. He came up within 20 yards
of me with his spear up. As soon as I put my gun to my shoulder
he took to his heels. After this, the rest of the party came up.
Whenever I went near the women, they began to spit at me. Dr.
Martin and Buck did not care for their spitting, for they brought
one of them down to the camp. We gave her several small presents,
and to her surprise, let her go, instead of (as she evidently
thought) roasting her. Distance 22 miles.</p>
<p><span class="aa">May</span> 20.&mdash;Left the horse at the
well, and started to see Lagrange Bay. This place is scarcely
worthy to be called a bay; its extreme depth is barely 6 miles,
and the water apparently very shallow. There is a. small estuary
running inland from it about 2 miles long. All round the bay
there seemed to be plains similar to the Racecourse Plains at
Roebuck Bay. The country along the sea-coast over which we
travelled yesterday was very good pastoral country, consisting of
well-grassed flats. This evening a native was seen walking
towards our camp with a piece of firewood on his shoulder and a
scoop of honey in his hand. I was a short distance from the well,
and stood perfectly still. He did not see me until within 20
yards, when he turned off the path, but was quickly caught by
Tommy. We gave him a few trifling presents, and after keeping him
for half an hour, let him go again. Distance 8 miles.</p>
<p><span class="aa">May</span> 21.&mdash;Started at 6.30. o'clock
a.m. for Roebuck Bay. Travelled along the coast-line, as that
route appeared easier for ourselves and horses. Shot two
kangaroos and a turkey; saw flights of parroquets; saw large
quantities of small pearl shells at all the native encampments
which we have passed. Distance 22 miles.</p>
<p><span class="aa">May</span> 22.&mdash;Started at daybreak;
arrived at depot camp at noon. Was informed that the prisoner
Wildman made his escape from the ship on the 13th of May, at 1
o'clock a.m., and was recaptured on the 14th. Before leaving the
ship he cut the long-boat adrift, and landed in the dingy.
Distance 15 miles.</p>
<p><span class="aa">May</span> 23.&mdash;Shipped the horses at
low water. The horse that got away on the night of the 18th found
its way back to the depot.</p>
<p><span class="aa">May</span> 24.&mdash;Weighed anchor at 9.30.
o'clock a.m., and sailed for Fremantle. Although the time for
which the vessel is chartered does not expire for another month,
I am afraid to stop here any longer, in case our passage back
should occupy as long a period (31 days) as it did coming up. The
prisoner very impertinent to the captain. Ordered to have bread
and water for 7 days. Wind S.E.; light.</p>
<p><span class="aa">May</span> 25.&mdash;Wind S.E.; light.</p>
<p><span class="aa">May</span> 26.&mdash;Wind S.E.; fresh.</p>
<p><span class="aa">May</span> 28.&mdash;Wind S.E.; fresh.</p>

N.W. Cape at daylight.</p>
<p><span class="aa">May</span> 30.&mdash;Wind North.</p>
<p><span class="aa">May</span> 31.&mdash;Wind N.W.; off Champion
