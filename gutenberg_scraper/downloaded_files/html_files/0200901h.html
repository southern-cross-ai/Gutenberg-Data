  <h2><a id="story1"
     name="story1"></a>I. &mdash; THE COIN OF DIONYSIUS</h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The News Of The World</i>, Aug 17, 1913, as "The
  Master Coiner Unmasked"</h3>

  <p class="first">It was eight o'clock at night and raining, scarcely a time
  when a business so limited in its clientele as that of a coin dealer could
  hope to attract any customer, but a light was still showing in the small shop
  that bore over its window the name of Baxter, and in the even smaller office
  at the back the proprietor himself sat reading the latest <i>Pall Mall</i>.
  His enterprise seemed to be justified, for presently the door bell gave its
  announcement, and throwing down his paper Mr Baxter went forward.</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact the dealer had been expecting someone and his manner
  as he passed into the shop was unmistakably suggestive of a caller of
  importance. But at the first glance towards his visitor the excess of
  deference melted out of his bearing, leaving the urbane, self-possessed
  shopman in the presence of the casual customer.</p>

  <p>"Mr Baxter, I think?" said the latter. He had laid aside his dripping
  umbrella and was unbuttoning overcoat and coat to reach an inner pocket. "You
  hardly remember me, I suppose? Mr Carlyle&mdash;two years ago I took up a
  case for you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"To be sure. Mr Carlyle, the private detective&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Inquiry agent," corrected Mr Carlyle precisely.</p>

  <p>"Well," smiled Mr Baxter, "for that matter I am a coin dealer and not an
  antiquarian or a numismatist. Is there anything in that way that I can do for
  you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied his visitor; "it is my turn to consult you." He had taken a
  small wash-leather bag from the inner pocket and now turned something
  carefully out upon the counter. "What can you tell me about that?"</p>

  <p>The dealer gave the coin a moment's scrutiny.</p>

  <p>"There is no question about this," he replied. "It is a Sicilian
  tetradrachm of Dionysius."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know that&mdash;I have it on the label out of the cabinet. I can
  tell you further that it's supposed to be one that Lord Seastoke gave two
  hundred and fifty pounds for at the Brice sale in '94."</p>

  <p>"It seems to me that you can tell me more about it than I can tell you,"
  remarked Mr Baxter. "What is it that you really want to know?"</p>

  <p>"I want to know," replied Mr Carlyle, "whether it is genuine or not."</p>

  <p>"Has any doubt been cast upon it?"</p>

  <p>"Certain circumstances raised a suspicion&mdash;that is all."</p>

  <p>The dealer took another look at the tetradrachm through his magnifying
  glass, holding it by the edge with the careful touch of an expert. Then he
  shook his head slowly in a confession of ignorance.</p>

  <p>"Of course I could make a guess&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No, don't," interrupted Mr Carlyle hastily. "An arrest hangs on it and
  nothing short of certainty is any good to me."</p>

  <p>"Is that so, Mr Carlyle?" said Mr Baxter, with increased interest. "Well,
  to be quite candid, the thing is out of my line. Now if it was a rare Saxon
  penny or a doubtful noble I'd stake my reputation on my opinion, but I do
  very little in the classical series."</p>

  <p>Mr Carlyle did not attempt to conceal his disappointment as he returned
  the coin to the bag and replaced the bag in the inner pocket.</p>

  <p>"I had been relying on you," he grumbled reproachfully. "Where on earth am
  I to go now?"</p>

  <p>"There is always the British Museum."</p>

  <p>"Ah, to be sure, thanks. But will anyone who can tell me be there
  now?"</p>

  <p>"Now? No fear!" replied Mr Baxter. "Go round in the
  morning&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But I must know to-night," explained the visitor, reduced to despair
  again. "To-morrow will be too late for the purpose."</p>

  <p>Mr Baxter did not hold out much encouragement in the circumstances.</p>

  <p>"You can scarcely expect to find anyone at business now," he remarked. "I
  should have been gone these two hours myself only I happened to have an
  appointment with an American millionaire who fixed his own time." Something
  indistinguishable from a wink slid off Mr Baxter's right eye. "Offmunson he's
  called, and a bright young pedigree-hunter has traced his descent from Offa,
  King of Mercia. So he&mdash;quite naturally&mdash;wants a set of Offas as a
  sort of collateral proof."</p>

  <p>"Very interesting," murmured Mr Carlyle, fidgeting with his watch. "I
  should love an hour's chat with you about your millionaire
  customers&mdash;some other time. Just now&mdash;look here, Baxter, can't you
  give me a line of introduction to some dealer in this sort of thing who
  happens to live in town? You must know dozens of experts."</p>

  <p>"Why, bless my soul, Mr Carlyle, I don't know a man of them away from his
  business," said Mr Baxter, staring. "They may live in Park Lane or they may
  live in Petticoat Lane for all I know. Besides, there aren't so many experts
  as you seem to imagine. And the two best will very likely quarrel over it.
  You've had to do with 'expert witnesses,' I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"I don't want a witness; there will be no need to give evidence. All I
  want is an absolutely authoritative pronouncement that I can act on. Is there
  no one who can really say whether the thing is genuine or not?"</p>

  <p>Mr Baxter's meaning silence became cynical in its implication as he
  continued to look at his visitor across the counter. Then he relaxed.</p>

  <p>"Stay a bit; there is a man&mdash;an amateur&mdash;I remember hearing
  wonderful things about some time ago. They say he really does know."</p>

  <p>"There you are," exclaimed Mr Carlyle, much relieved. "There always is
  someone. Who is he?"</p>

  <p>"Funny name," replied Baxter. "Something Wynn or Wynn something." He
  craned his neck to catch sight of an important motor car that was drawing to
  the kerb before his window. "Wynn Carrados! You'll excuse me now, Mr Carlyle,
  won't you? This looks like Mr Offmunson."</p>

  <p>Mr Carlyle hastily scribbled the name down on his cuff.</p>

  <p>"Wynn Carrados, right. Where does he live?"</p>

  <p>"Haven't the remotest idea," replied Baxter, referring the arrangement of
  his tie to the judgment of the wall mirror. "I have never seen the man
  myself. Now, Mr Carlyle, I'm sorry I can't do any more for you. You won't
  mind, will you?"</p>

  <p>Mr Carlyle could not pretend to misunderstand. He enjoyed the distinction
  of holding open the door for the transatlantic representative of the line of
  Offa as he went out, and then made his way through the muddy streets back to
  his office. There was only one way of tracing a private individual at such
  short notice&mdash;through the pages of the directories, and the gentleman
  did not flatter himself by a very high estimate of his chances.</p>

  <p>Fortune favoured him, however. He very soon discovered a Wynn Carrados
  living at Richmond, and, better still, further search failed to unearth
  another. There was, apparently, only one householder at all events of that
  name in the neighbourhood of London. He jotted down the address and set out
  for Richmond.</p>

  <p>The house was some distance from the station, Mr Carlyle learned. He took
  a taxicab and drove, dismissing the vehicle at the gate. He prided himself on
  his power of observation and the accuracy of the deductions which resulted
  from it&mdash;a detail of his business. "It's nothing more than using one's
  eyes and putting two and two together," he would modestly declare, when he
  wished to be deprecatory rather than impressive, and by the time he had
  reached the front door of "The Turrets" he had formed some opinion of the
  position and tastes of the man who lived there.</p>

  <p>A man-servant admitted Mr Carlyle and took in his card&mdash;his private
  card with the bare request for an interview that would not detain Mr Carrados
  for ten minutes. Luck still favoured him; Mr Carrados was at home and would
  see him at once. The servant, the hall through which they passed, and the
  room into which he was shown, all contributed something to the deductions
  which the quietly observant gentleman was half unconsciously recording.</p>

  <p>"Mr Carlyle," announced the servant.</p>

  <p>The room was a library or study. The only occupant, a man of about
  Carlyle's own age, had been using a typewriter up to the moment of his
  visitor's entrance. He now turned and stood up with an expression of formal
  courtesy.</p>

  <p>"It's very good of you to see me at this hour," apologized the caller.</p>

  <p>The conventional expression of Mr Carrados's face changed a little.</p>

  <p>"Surely my man has got your name wrong?" he exclaimed. "Isn't it Louis
  Calling?"</p>

  <p>The visitor stopped short and his agreeable smile gave place to a sudden
  flash of anger or annoyance.</p>

  <p>"No, sir," he replied stiffly. "My name is on the card which you have
  before you."</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon," said Mr Carrados, with perfect good-humour. "I hadn't
  seen it. But I used to know a Calling some years ago&mdash;at St
  Michael's."</p>

  <p>"St Michael's!" Mr Carlyle's features underwent another change, no less
  instant and sweeping than before. "St Michael's! Wynn Carrados? Good heavens!
  it isn't Max Wynn&mdash;old 'Winning' Wynn?"</p>

  <p>"A little older and a little fatter&mdash;yes," replied Carrados. "I
  <i>have</i>changed my name, you see."</p>

  <p>"Extraordinary thing meeting like this," said his visitor, dropping into a
  chair and staring hard at Mr Carrados. "I have changed more than my name. How
  did you recognize me?"</p>

  <p>"The voice," replied Carrados. "It took me back to that little smoke-dried
  attic den of yours where we&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"My God!" exclaimed Carlyle bitterly, "don't remind me of what we were
  going to do in those days." He looked round the well-furnished, handsome room
  and recalled the other signs of wealth that he had noticed. "At all events,
  you seem fairly comfortable, Wynn."</p>

  <p>"I am alternately envied and pitied," replied Carrados, with a placid
  tolerance of circumstance that seemed characteristic of him. "Still, as you
  say, I am fairly comfortable."</p>

  <p>"Envied, I can understand. But why are you pitied?"</p>

  <p>"Because I am blind," was the tranquil reply.</p>

  <p>"Blind!" exclaimed Mr Carlyle, using his own eyes superlatively. "Do you
  mean&mdash;literally blind?"</p>

  <p>"Literally.... I was riding along a bridle-path through a wood about a
  dozen years ago with a friend. He was in front. At one point a twig sprang
  back&mdash;you know how easily a thing like that happens. It just flicked my
  eye&mdash;nothing to think twice about."</p>

  <p>"And that blinded you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, ultimately. It's called amaurosis."</p>

  <p>"I can scarcely believe it. You seem so sure and self-reliant. Your eyes
  are full of expression&mdash;only a little quieter than they used to be. I
  believe you were typing when I came.... Aren't you having me?"</p>

  <p>"You miss the dog and the stick?" smiled Carrados. "No; it's a fact."</p>

  <p>"What an awful infliction for you, Max. You were always such an impulsive,
  reckless sort of fellow&mdash;never quiet. You must miss such a fearful
  lot."</p>

  <p>"Has anyone else recognized you?" asked Carrados quietly.</p>

  <p>"Ah, that was the voice, you said," replied Carlyle.</p>

  <p>"Yes; but other people heard the voice as well. Only I had no blundering,
  self-confident eyes to be hoodwinked."</p>

  <p>"That's a rum way of putting it," said Carlyle. "Are your ears never
  hoodwinked, may I ask?"</p>

  <p>"Not now. Nor my fingers. Nor any of my other senses that have to look out
  for themselves."</p>

  <p>"Well, well," murmured Mr Carlyle, cut short in his sympathetic emotions.
  "I'm glad you take it so well. Of course, if you find it an advantage to be
  blind, old man&mdash;&mdash;" He stopped and reddened. "I beg your pardon,"
  he concluded stiffly.</p>

  <p>"Not an advantage perhaps," replied the other thoughtfully. "Still it has
  compensations that one might not think of. A new world to explore, new
  experiences, new powers awakening; strange new perceptions; life in the
  fourth dimension. But why do you beg my pardon, Louis?"</p>

  <p>"I am an ex-solicitor, struck off in connexion with the falsifying of a
  trust account, Mr Carrados," replied Carlyle, rising.</p>

  <p>"Sit down, Louis," said Carrados suavely. His face, even his incredibly
  living eyes, beamed placid good-nature. "The chair on which you will sit, the
  roof above you, all the comfortable surroundings to which you have so amiably
  alluded, are the direct result of falsifying a trust account. But do I call
  you 'Mr Carlyle' in consequence? Certainly not, Louis."</p>

  <p>"I did not falsify the account," cried Carlyle hotly. He sat down,
  however, and added more quietly: "But why do I tell you all this? I have
  never spoken of it before."</p>

  <p>"Blindness invites confidence," replied Carrados. "We are out of the
  running&mdash;human rivalry ceases to exist. Besides, why shouldn't you? In
  my case the account <i>was</i> falsified."</p>

  <p>"Of course that's all bunkum, Max," commented Carlyle. "Still, I
  appreciate your motive."</p>

  <p>"Practically everything I possess was left to me by an American cousin, on
  the condition that I took the name of Carrados. He made his fortune by an
  ingenious conspiracy of doctoring the crop reports and unloading favourably
  in consequence. And I need hardly remind you that the receiver is equally
  guilty with the thief."</p>

  <p>"But twice as safe. I know something of that, Max.... Have you any idea
  what my business is?"</p>

  <p>"You shall tell me," replied Carrados.</p>

  <p>"I run a private inquiry agency. When I lost my profession I had to do
  something for a living. This occurred. I dropped my name, changed my
  appearance and opened an office. I knew the legal side down to the ground and
  I got a retired Scotland Yard man to organize the outside work."</p>

  <p>"Excellent!" cried Carrados. "Do you unearth many murders?"</p>

  <p>"No," admitted Mr Carlyle; "our business lies mostly on the conventional
  lines among divorce and defalcation."</p>

  <p>"That's a pity," remarked Carrados. "Do you know, Louis, I always had a
  secret ambition to be a detective myself. I have even thought lately that I
  might still be able to do something at it if the chance came my way. That
  makes you smile?"</p>

  <p>"Well, certainly, the idea&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, the idea of a blind detective&mdash;the blind tracking the
  alert&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Of course, as you say, certain faculties are no doubt quickened," Mr
  Carlyle hastened to add considerately, "but, seriously, with the exception of
  an artist, I don't suppose there is any man who is more utterly dependent on
  his eyes."</p>

  <p>Whatever opinion Carrados might have held privately, his genial exterior
  did not betray a shadow of dissent. For a full minute he continued to smoke
  as though he derived an actual visual enjoyment from the blue sprays that
  travelled and dispersed across the room. He had already placed before his
  visitor a box containing cigars of a brand which that gentleman keenly
  appreciated but generally regarded as unattainable, and the matter-of-fact
  ease and certainty with which the blind man had brought the box and put it
  before him had sent a questioning flicker through Carlyle's mind.</p>

  <p>"You used to be rather fond of art yourself, Louis," he remarked
  presently. "Give me your opinion of my latest purchase&mdash;the bronze lion
  on the cabinet there." Then, as Carlyle's gaze went about the room, he added
  quickly: "No, not that cabinet&mdash;the one on your left."</p>

  <p>Carlyle shot a sharp glance at his host as he got up, but Carrados's
  expression was merely benignly complacent. Then he strolled across to the
  figure.</p>

  <p>"Very nice," he admitted. "Late Flemish, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"No. It is a copy of Vidal's 'Roaring lion.'"</p>

  <p>"Vidal?"</p>

  <p>"A French artist." The voice became indescribably flat. "He, also, had the
  misfortune to be blind, by the way."</p>

  <p>"You old humbug, Max!" shrieked Carlyle, "you've been thinking that out
  for the last five minutes." Then the unfortunate man bit his lip and turned
  his back towards his host.</p>

  <p>"Do you remember how we used to pile it up on that obtuse ass Sanders and
  then roast him?" asked Carrados, ignoring the half-smothered exclamation with
  which the other man had recalled himself.</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Carlyle quietly. "This is very good," he continued,
  addressing himself to the bronze again. "How ever did he do it?"</p>

  <p>"With his hands."</p>

  <p>"Naturally. But, I mean, how did he study his model?"</p>

  <p>"Also with his hands. He called it 'seeing near.'"</p>

  <p>"Even with a lion&mdash;handled it?"</p>

  <p>"In such cases he required the services of a keeper, who brought the
  animal to bay while Vidal exercised his own particular gifts.... You don't
  feel inclined to put me on the track of a mystery, Louis?"</p>

  <p>Unable to regard this request as anything but one of old Max's
  unquenchable pleasantries, Mr Carlyle was on the point of making a suitable
  reply when a sudden thought caused him to smile knowingly. Up to that point
  he had, indeed, completely forgotten the object of his visit. Now that he
  remembered the doubtful Dionysius and Mr Baxter's recommendation he
  immediately assumed that some mistake had been made. Either Max was not the
  Wynn Carrados he had been seeking or else the dealer had been misinformed;
  for although his host was wonderfully expert in the face of his misfortune,
  it was inconceivable that he could decide the genuineness of a coin without
  seeing it. The opportunity seemed a good one of getting even with Carrados by
  taking him at his word.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he accordingly replied, with crisp deliberation, as he recrossed
  the room; "yes, I will, Max. Here is the clue to what seems to be a rather
  remarkable fraud." He put the tetradrachm into his host's hand. "What do you
  make of it?"</p>

  <p>For a few seconds Carrados handled the piece with the delicate
  manipulation of his finger-tips while Carlyle looked on with a
  self-appreciative grin. Then with equal gravity the blind man weighed the
  coin in the balance of his hand. Finally he touched it with his tongue.</p>

  <p>"Well?" demanded the other.</p>

  <p>"Of course I have not much to go on, and if I was more fully in your
  confidence I might come to another conclusion&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes," interposed Carlyle, with amused encouragement.</p>

  <p>"Then I should advise you to arrest the parlourmaid, Nina Brun,
  communicate with the police authorities of Padua for particulars of the
  career of Helene Brunesi, and suggest to Lord Seastoke that he should return
  to London to see what further depredations have been made in his
  cabinet."</p>

  <p>Mr Carlyle's groping hand sought and found a chair, on to which he dropped
  blankly. His eyes were unable to detach themselves for a single moment from
  the very ordinary spectacle of Mr Carrados's mildly benevolent face, while
  the sterilized ghost of his now forgotten amusement still lingered about his
  features.</p>

  <p>"Good heavens!" he managed to articulate, "how do you know?"</p>

  <p>"Isn't that what you wanted of me?" asked Carrados suavely.</p>

  <p>"Don't humbug, Max," said Carlyle severely. "This is no joke." An
  undefined mistrust of his own powers suddenly possessed him in the presence
  of this mystery. "How do you come to know of Nina Brun and Lord
  Seastoke?"</p>

  <p>"You are a detective, Louis," replied Carrados. "How does one know these
  things? By using one's eyes and putting two and two together."</p>

  <p>Carlyle groaned and flung out an arm petulantly.</p>

  <p>"Is it all bunkum, Max? Do you really see all the time&mdash;though that
  doesn't go very far towards explaining it."</p>

  <p>"Like Vidal, I see very well&mdash;at close quarters," replied Carrados,
  lightly running a forefinger along the inscription on the tetradrachm. "For
  longer range I keep another pair of eyes. Would you like to test them?"</p>

  <p>Mr Carlyle's assent was not very gracious; it was, in fact, faintly sulky.
  He was suffering the annoyance of feeling distinctly unimpressive in his own
  department; but he was also curious.</p>

  <p>"The bell is just behind you, if you don't mind," said his host.
  "Parkinson will appear. You might take note of him while he is in."</p>

  <p>The man who had admitted Mr Carlyle proved to be Parkinson.</p>

  <p>"This gentleman is Mr Carlyle, Parkinson," explained Carrados the moment
  the man entered. "You will remember him for the future?"</p>

  <p>Parkinson's apologetic eye swept the visitor from head to foot, but so
  lightly and swiftly that it conveyed to that gentleman the comparison of
  being very deftly dusted.</p>

  <p>"I will endeavour to do so, sir," replied Parkinson, turning again to his
  master.</p>

  <p>"I shall be at home to Mr Carlyle whenever he calls. That is all."</p>

  <p>"Very well, sir."</p>

  <p>"Now, Louis," remarked Mr Carrados briskly, when the door had closed
  again, "you have had a good opportunity of studying Parkinson. What is he
  like?"</p>

  <p>"In what way?"</p>

  <p>"I mean as a matter of description. I am a blind man&mdash;I haven't seen
  my servant for twelve years&mdash;what idea can you give me of him? I asked
  you to notice."</p>

  <p>"I know you did, but your Parkinson is the sort of man who has very little
  about him to describe. He is the embodiment of the ordinary. His height is
  about average&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Five feet nine," murmured Carrados. "Slightly above the mean."</p>

  <p>"Scarcely noticeably so. Clean-shaven. Medium brown hair. No particularly
  marked features. Dark eyes. Good teeth."</p>

  <p>"False," interposed Carrados. "The teeth&mdash;not the statement."</p>

  <p>"Possibly," admitted Mr Carlyle. "I am not a dental expert and I had no
  opportunity of examining Mr Parkinson's mouth in detail. But what is the
  drift of all this?"</p>

  <p>"His clothes?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, just the ordinary evening dress of a valet. There is not much room
  for variety in that."</p>

  <p>"You noticed, in fact, nothing special by which Parkinson could be
  identified?"</p>

  <p>"Well, he wore an unusually broad gold ring on the little finger of the
  left hand."</p>

  <p>"But that is removable. And yet Parkinson has an ineradicable mole&mdash;a
  small one, I admit&mdash;on his chin. And you a human sleuth-hound. Oh,
  Louis!"</p>

  <p>"At all events," retorted Carlyle, writhing a little under this
  good-humoured satire, although it was easy enough to see in it Carrados's
  affectionate intention&mdash;"at all events, I dare say I can give as good a
  description of Parkinson as he can give of me."</p>

  <p>"That is what we are going to test. Ring the bell again."</p>

  <p>"Seriously?"</p>

  <p>"Quite. I am trying my eyes against yours. If I can't give you fifty out
  of a hundred I'll renounce my private detectorial ambition for ever."</p>

  <p>"It isn't quite the same," objected Carlyle, but he rang the bell.</p>

  <p>"Come in and close the door, Parkinson," said Carrados when the man
  appeared. "Don't look at Mr Carlyle again&mdash;in fact, you had better stand
  with your back towards him, he won't mind. Now describe to me his appearance
  as you observed it."</p>

  <p>Parkinson tendered his respectful apologies to Mr Carlyle for the liberty
  he was compelled to take, by the deferential quality of his voice.</p>

  <p>"Mr Carlyle, sir, wears patent leather boots of about size seven and very
  little used. There are five buttons, but on the left boot one
  button&mdash;the third up&mdash;is missing, leaving loose threads and not the
  more usual metal fastener. Mr Carlyle's trousers, sir, are of a dark
  material, a dark grey line of about a quarter of an inch width on a darker
  ground. The bottoms are turned permanently up and are, just now, a little
  muddy, if I may say so."</p>

  <p>"Very muddy," interposed Mr Carlyle generously. "It is a wet night,
  Parkinson."</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir; very unpleasant weather. If you will allow me, sir, I will
  brush you in the hall. The mud is dry now, I notice. Then, sir," continued
  Parkinson, reverting to the business in hand, "there are dark green cashmere
  hose. A curb-pattern key-chain passes into the left-hand trouser pocket."</p>

  <p>From the visitor's nether garments the photographic-eyed Parkinson
  proceeded to higher ground, and with increasing wonder Mr Carlyle listened to
  the faithful catalogue of his possessions. His fetter-and-link albert of gold
  and platinum was minutely described. His spotted blue ascot, with its
  gentlemanly pearl scarfpin, was set forth, and the fact that the buttonhole
  in the left lapel of his morning coat showed signs of use was duly noted.
  What Parkinson saw he recorded but he made no deductions. A handkerchief
  carried in the cuff of the right sleeve was simply that to him and not an
  indication that Mr Carlyle was, indeed, left-handed.</p>

  <p>But a more delicate part of Parkinson's undertaking remained. He
  approached it with a double cough.</p>

  <p>"As regards Mr Carlyle's personal appearance; sir&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No, enough!" cried the gentleman concerned hastily. "I am more than
  satisfied. You are a keen observer, Parkinson."</p>

  <p>"I have trained myself to suit my master's requirements, sir," replied the
  man. He looked towards Mr Carrados, received a nod and withdrew.</p>

  <p>Mr Carlyle was the first to speak.</p>

  <p>"That man of yours would be worth five pounds a week to me, Max," he
  remarked thoughtfully. "But, of course&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I don't think that he would take it," replied Carrados, in a voice of
  equally detached speculation. "He suits me very well. But you have the chance
  of using his services&mdash;indirectly."</p>

  <p>"You still mean that&mdash;seriously?"</p>

  <p>"I notice in you a chronic disinclination to take me seriously, Louis. It
  is really&mdash;to an Englishman&mdash;almost painful. Is there something
  inherently comic about me or the atmosphere of The Turrets?"</p>

  <p>"No, my friend," replied Mr Carlyle, "but there is something essentially
  prosperous. That is what points to the improbable. Now what is it?"</p>

  <p>"It might be merely a whim, but it is more than that," replied Carrados.
  "It is, well, partly vanity, partly <i>ennui</i>, partly"&mdash;certainly
  there was something more nearly tragic in his voice than comic
  now&mdash;"partly hope."</p>

  <p>Mr Carlyle was too tactful to pursue the subject.</p>

  <p>"Those are three tolerable motives," he acquiesced. "I'll do anything you
  want, Max, on one condition."</p>

  <p>"Agreed. And it is?"</p>

  <p>"That you tell me how you knew so much of this affair." He tapped the
  silver coin which lay on the table near them. "I am not easily
  flabbergasted," he added.</p>

  <p>"You won't believe that there is nothing to explain&mdash;that it was
  purely second-sight?"</p>

  <p>"No," replied Carlyle tersely; "I won't."</p>

  <p>"You are quite right. And yet the thing is very simple."</p>

  <p>"They always are&mdash;when you know," soliloquized the other. "That's
  what makes them so confoundedly difficult when you don't."</p>

  <p>"Here is this one then. In Padua, which seems to be regaining its old
  reputation as the birthplace of spurious antiques, by the way, there lives an
  ingenious craftsman named Pietro Stelli. This simple soul, who possesses a
  talent not inferior to that of Cavino at his best, has for many years turned
  his hand to the not unprofitable occupation of forging rare Greek and Roman
  coins. As a collector and student of certain Greek colonials and a specialist
  in forgeries I have been familiar with Stelli's workmanship for years.
  Latterly he seems to have come under the influence of an international crook
  called&mdash;at the moment&mdash;Dompierre, who soon saw a way of utilizing
  Stelli's genius on a royal scale. Helene Brunesi, who in private life
  is&mdash;and really is, I believe&mdash;Madame Dompierre, readily lent her
  services to the enterprise."</p>

  <p>"Quite so," nodded Mr Carlyle, as his host paused.</p>

  <p>"You see the whole sequence, of course?"</p>

  <p>"Not exactly&mdash;not in detail," confessed Mr Carlyle.</p>

  <p>"Dompierre's idea was to gain access to some of the most celebrated
  cabinets of Europe and substitute Stelli's fabrications for the genuine
  coins. The princely collection of rarities that he would thus amass might be
  difficult to dispose of safely but I have no doubt that he had matured his
  plans. Helene, in the person of Nina Bran, an Anglicised French
  parlourmaid&mdash;a part which she fills to perfection&mdash;was to obtain
  wax impressions of the most valuable pieces and to make the exchange when the
  counterfeits reached her. In this way it was obviously hoped that the fraud
  would not come to light until long after the real coins had been sold, and I
  gather that she has already done her work successfully in several houses.
  Then, impressed by her excellent references and capable manner, my
  housekeeper engaged her, and for a few weeks she went about her duties here.
  It was fatal to this detail of the scheme, however, that I have the
  misfortune to be blind. I am told that Helene has so innocently angelic a
  face as to disarm suspicion, but I was incapable of being impressed and that
  good material was thrown away. But one morning my material
  fingers&mdash;which, of course, knew nothing of Helene's angelic
  face&mdash;discovered an unfamiliar touch about the surface of my favourite
  Euclideas, and, although there was doubtless nothing to be seen, my critical
  sense of smell reported that wax had been recently pressed against it. I
  began to make discreet inquiries and in the meantime my cabinets went to the
  local bank for safety. Helene countered by receiving a telegram from Angiers,
  calling her to the death-bed of her aged mother. The aged mother succumbed;
  duty compelled Helene to remain at the side of her stricken patriarchal
  father, and doubtless The Turrets was written off the syndicate's operations
  as a bad debt."</p>

  <p>"Very interesting," admitted Mr Carlyle; "but at the risk of seeming
  obtuse"&mdash;his manner had become delicately chastened&mdash;"I must say
  that I fail to trace the inevitable connexion between Nina Brun and this
  particular forgery&mdash;assuming that it is a forgery."</p>

  <p>"Set your mind at rest about that, Louis," replied Carrados. "It is a
  forgery, and it is a forgery that none but Pietro Stelli could have achieved.
  That is the essential connexion. Of course, there are accessories. A private
  detective coming urgently to see me with a notable tetradrachm in his pocket,
  which he announces to be the clue to a remarkable fraud&mdash;well, really,
  Louis, one scarcely needs to be blind to see through that."</p>

  <p>"And Lord Seastoke? I suppose you happened to discover that Nina Brun had
  gone there?"</p>

  <p>"No, I cannot claim to have discovered that, or I should certainly have
  warned him at once when I found out&mdash;only recently&mdash;about the gang.
  As a matter of fact, the last information I had of Lord Seastoke was a line
  in yesterday's <i>Morning Post</i> to the effect that he was still at Cairo.
  But many of these pieces&mdash;&mdash;" He brushed his finger almost lovingly
  across the vivid chariot race that embellished the reverse of the coin, and
  broke off to remark: "You really ought to take up the subject, Louis. You
  have no idea how useful it might prove to you some day."</p>

  <p>"I really think I must," replied Carlyle grimly. "Two hundred and fifty
  pounds the original of this cost, I believe."</p>

  <p>"Cheap, too; it would make five hundred pounds in New York to-day. As I
  was saying, many are literally unique. This gem by Kimon is&mdash;here is his
  signature, you see; Peter is particularly good at lettering&mdash;and as I
  handled the genuine tetradrachm about two years ago, when Lord Seastoke
  exhibited it at a meeting of our society in Albemarle Street, there is
  nothing at all wonderful in my being able to fix the locale of your mystery.
  Indeed, I feel that I ought to apologize for it all being so simple."</p>

  <p>"I think," remarked Mr Carlyle, critically examining the loose threads on
  his left boot, "that the apology on that head would be more appropriate from
  me."</p>

  <h2><a id="story2"
     name="story2"></a>II. &mdash; THE KNIGHT'S CROSS SIGNAL PROBLEM</h2>

  <h3>Serialised in <i>The News Of The World</i>, Aug 24-31, 1913, as "The
  Mystery Of The Signals"</h3>

  <p class="first">"Louis," exclaimed Mr Carrados, with the air of genial
  gaiety that Carlyle had found so incongruous to his conception of a blind
  man, "you have a mystery somewhere about you! I know it by your step."</p>

  <p>Nearly a month had passed since the incident of the false Dionysius had
  led to the two men meeting. It was now December. Whatever Mr Carlyle's step
  might indicate to the inner eye it betokened to the casual observer the
  manner of a crisp, alert, self-possessed man of business. Carlyle, in truth,
  betrayed nothing of the pessimism and despondency that had marked him on the
  earlier occasion.</p>

  <p>"You have only yourself to thank that it is a very poor one," he retorted.
  "If you hadn't held me to a hasty promise&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"To give me an option on the next case that baffled you, no matter what it
  was&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Just so. The consequence is that you get a very unsatisfactory affair
  that has no special interest to an amateur and is only baffling because it
  is&mdash;well&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well, baffling?"</p>

  <p>"Exactly, Max. Your would-be jest has discovered the proverbial truth. I
  need hardly tell you that it is only the insoluble that is finally baffling
  and this is very probably insoluble. You remember the awful smash on the
  Central and Suburban at Knight's Cross Station a few weeks ago?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Carrados, with interest. "I read the whole ghastly details
  at the time."</p>

  <p>"You read?" exclaimed his friend suspiciously.</p>

  <p>"I still use the familiar phrases," explained Carrados, with a smile. "As
  a matter of fact, my secretary reads to me. I mark what I want to hear and
  when he comes at ten o'clock we clear off the morning papers in no time."</p>

  <p>"And how do you know what to mark?" demanded Mr Carlyle cunningly.</p>

  <p>Carrados's right hand, lying idly on the table, moved to a newspaper near.
  He ran his finger along a column heading, his eyes still turned towards his
  visitor.</p>

  <p>"'The Money Market. Continued from page 2. British Railways,'" he
  announced.</p>

  <p>"Extraordinary," murmured Carlyle.</p>

  <p>"Not very," said Carrados. "If someone dipped a stick in treacle and wrote
  'Rats' across a marble slab you would probably be able to distinguish what
  was there, blindfold."</p>

  <p>"Probably," admitted Mr Carlyle. "At all events we will not test the
  experiment."</p>

  <p>"The difference to you of treacle on a marble background is scarcely
  greater than that of printers' ink on newspaper to me. But anything smaller
  than pica I do not read with comfort, and below long primer I cannot read at
  all. Hence the secretary. Now the accident, Louis."</p>

  <p>"The accident: well, you remember all about that. An ordinary Central and
  Suburban passenger train, non-stop at Knight's Cross, ran past the signal and
  crashed into a crowded electric train that was just beginning to move out. It
  was like sending a garden roller down a row of handlights. Two carriages of
  the electric train were flattened out of existence; the next two were broken
  up. For the first time on an English railway there was a good stand-up smash
  between a heavy steam-engine and a train of light cars, and it was 'bad for
  the coo.'"</p>

  <p>"Twenty-seven killed, forty something injured, eight died since,"
  commented Carrados.</p>

  <p>"That was bad for the Co.," said Carlyle. "Well, the main fact was plain
  enough. The heavy train was in the wrong. But was the engine-driver
  responsible? He claimed, and he claimed vehemently from the first and he
  never varied one iota, that he had a 'clear' signal&mdash;that is to say, the
  green light, it being dark. The signalman concerned was equally dogged that
  he never pulled off the signal&mdash;that it was at 'danger' when the
  accident happened and that it had been for five minutes before. Obviously,
  they could not both be right."</p>

  <p>"Why, Louis?" asked Mr Carrados smoothly.</p>

  <p>"The signal must either have been up or down&mdash;red or green."</p>

  <p>"Did you ever notice the signals on the Great Northern Railway,
  Louis?"</p>

  <p>"Not particularly. Why?"</p>

  <p>"One winterly day, about the year when you and I were concerned in being
  born, the engine-driver of a Scotch express received the 'clear' from a
  signal near a little Huntingdon station called Abbots Ripton. He went on and
  crashed into a goods train and into the thick of the smash a down express
  mowed its way. Thirteen killed and the usual tale of injured. He was positive
  that the signal gave him a 'clear'; the signalman was equally confident that
  he had never pulled it off the 'danger.' Both were right, and yet the signal
  was in working order. As I said, it was a winterly day; it had been snowing
  hard and the snow froze and accumulated on the upper edge of the signal arm
  until its weight bore it down. That is a fact that no fiction writer dare
  have invented, but to this day every signal on the Great Northern pivots from
  the centre of the arm instead of from the end, in memory of that
  snowstorm."</p>

  <p>"That came out at the inquest, I presume?" said Mr Carlyle. "We have had
  the Board of Trade inquiry and the inquest here and no explanation is
  forthcoming. Everything was in perfect order. It rests between the word of
  the signalman and the word of the engine-driver&mdash;not a jot of direct
  evidence either way. Which is right?"</p>

  <p>"That is what you are going to find out, Louis?" suggested Carrados.</p>

  <p>"It is what I am being paid for finding out," admitted Mr Carlyle frankly.
  "But so far we are just where the inquest left it, and, between ourselves, I
  candidly can't see an inch in front of my face in the matter."</p>

  <p>"Nor can I," said the blind man, with a rather wry smile. "Never mind. The
  engine-driver is your client, of course?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," admitted Carlyle. "But how the deuce did you know?"</p>

  <p>"Let us say that your sympathies are enlisted on his behalf. The jury were
  inclined to exonerate the signalman, weren't they? What has the company done
  with your man?"</p>

  <p>"Both are suspended. Hutchins, the driver, hears that he may probably be
  given charge of a lavatory at one of the stations. He is a decent, bluff,
  short-spoken old chap, with his heart in his work. Just now you'll find him
  at his worst&mdash;bitter and suspicious. The thought of swabbing down a
  lavatory and taking pennies all day is poisoning him."</p>

  <p>"Naturally. Well, there we have honest Hutchins: taciturn, a little touchy
  perhaps, grown grey in the service of the company, and manifesting quite a
  bulldog-like devotion to his favourite 538."</p>

  <p>"Why, that actually was the number of his engine&mdash;how do you know
  it?" demanded Carlyle sharply.</p>

  <p>"It was mentioned two or three times at the inquest, Louis," replied
  Carrados mildly.</p>

  <p>"And you remembered&mdash;with no reason to?"</p>

  <p>"You can generally trust a blind man's memory, especially if he has taken
  the trouble to develop it."</p>

  <p>"Then you will remember that Hutchins did not make a very good impression
  at the time. He was surly and irritable under the ordeal. I want you to see
  the case from all sides."</p>

  <p>"He called the signalman&mdash;Mead&mdash;a 'lying young dog,' across the
  room, I believe. Now, Mead, what is he like? You have seen him, of
  course?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. He does not impress me favourably. He is glib, ingratiating, and
  distinctly 'greasy.' He has a ready answer for everything almost before the
  question is out of your mouth. He has thought of everything."</p>

  <p>"And now you are going to tell me something, Louis," said Carrados
  encouragingly.</p>

  <p>Mr Carlyle laughed a little to cover an involuntary movement of
  surprise.</p>

  <p>"There is a suggestive line that was not touched at the inquiries," he
  admitted. "Hutchins has been a saving man all his life, and he has received
  good wages. Among his class he is regarded as wealthy. I daresay that he has
  five hundred pounds in the bank. He is a widower with one daughter, a very
  nice-mannered girl of about twenty. Mead is a young man, and he and the girl
  are sweethearts&mdash;have been informally engaged for some time. But old
  Hutchins would not hear of it; he seems to have taken a dislike to the
  signalman from the first and latterly he had forbidden him to come to his
  house or his daughter to speak to him."</p>

  <p>"Excellent, Louis," cried Carrados in great delight. "We shall clear your
  man in a blaze of red and green lights yet and hang the glib, 'greasy'
  signalman from his own signal-post."</p>

  <p>"It is a significant fact, seriously?"</p>

  <p>"It is absolutely convincing."</p>

  <p>"It may have been a slip, a mental lapse on Mead's part which he
  discovered the moment it was too late, and then, being too cowardly to admit
  his fault, and having so much at stake, he took care to make detection
  impossible. It may have been that, but my idea is rather that probably it was
  neither quite pure accident nor pure design. I can imagine Mead meanly
  pluming himself over the fact that the life of this man who stands in his
  way, and whom he must cordially dislike, lies in his power. I can imagine the
  idea becoming an obsession as he dwells on it. A dozen times with his hand on
  the lever he lets his mind explore the possibilities of a moment's defection.
  Then one day he pulls the signal off in sheer bravado&mdash;and hastily puts
  it at danger again. He may have done it once or he may have done it oftener
  before he was caught in a fatal moment of irresolution. The chances are about
  even that the engine-driver would be killed. In any case he would be
  disgraced, for it is easier on the face of it to believe that a man might run
  past a danger signal in absentmindedness, without noticing it, than that a
  man should pull off a signal and replace it without being conscious of his
  actions."</p>

  <p>"The fireman was killed. Does your theory involve the certainty of the
  fireman being killed, Louis?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Carlyle. "The fireman is a difficulty, but looking at it from
  Mead's point of view&mdash;whether he has been guilty of an error or a
  crime&mdash;it resolves itself into this: First, the fireman may be killed.
  Second, he may not notice the signal at all. Third, in any case he will
  loyally corroborate his driver and the good old jury will discount that."</p>

  <p>Carrados smoked thoughtfully, his open, sightless eyes merely appearing to
  be set in a tranquil gaze across the room.</p>

  <p>"It would not be an improbable explanation," he said presently.
  "Ninety-nine men out of a hundred would say: 'People do not do these things.'
  But you and I, who have in our different ways studied criminology, know that
  they sometimes do, or else there would be no curious crimes. What have you
  done on that line?"</p>

  <p>To anyone who could see, Mr Carlyle's expression conveyed an answer.</p>

  <p>"You are behind the scenes, Max. What was there for me to do? Still I must
  do something for my money. Well, I have had a very close inquiry made
  confidentially among the men. There might be a whisper of one of them knowing
  more than had come out&mdash;a man restrained by friendship, or enmity, or
  even grade jealousy. Nothing came of that. Then there was the remote chance
  that some private person had noticed the signal without attaching any
  importance to it then, one who would be able to identify it still by
  something associated with the time. I went over the line myself. Opposite the
  signal the line on one side is shut in by a high blank wall; on the other
  side are houses, but coming below the butt-end of a scullery the signal does
  not happen to be visible from any road or from any window."</p>

  <p>"My poor Louis!" said Carrados, in friendly ridicule. "You were at the end
  of your tether?"</p>

  <p>"I was," admitted Carlyle. "And now that you know the sort of job it is I
  don't suppose that you are keen on wasting your time over it."</p>

  <p>"That would hardly be fair, would it?" said Carrados reasonably. "No,
  Louis, I will take over your honest old driver and your greasy young
  signalman and your fatal signal that cannot be seen from anywhere."</p>

  <p>"But it is an important point for you to remember, Max, that although the
  signal cannot be seen from the box, if the mechanism had gone wrong, or
  anyone tampered with the arm, the automatic indicator would at once have told
  Mead that the green light was showing. Oh, I have gone very thoroughly into
  the technical points, I assure you."</p>

  <p>"I must do so too," commented Mr Carrados gravely.</p>

  <p>"For that matter, if there is anything you want to know, I dare say that I
  can tell you," suggested his visitor. "It might save your time."</p>

  <p>"True," acquiesced Carrados. "I should like to know whether anyone
  belonging to the houses that bound the line there came of age or got married
  on the twenty-sixth of November."</p>

  <p>Mr Carlyle looked across curiously at his host.</p>

  <p>"I really do not know, Max," he replied, in his crisp, precise way. "What
  on earth has that got to do with it, may I inquire?"</p>

  <p>"The only explanation of the Pont St Lin swing-bridge disaster of '75 was
  the reflection of a green bengal light on a cottage window."</p>

  <p>Mr Carlyle smiled his indulgence privately.</p>

  <p>"My dear chap, you mustn't let your retentive memory of obscure happenings
  run away with you," he remarked wisely. "In nine cases out of ten the obvious
  explanation is the true one. The difficulty, as here, lies in proving it.
  Now, you would like to see these men?"</p>

  <p>"I expect so; in any case, I will see Hutchins first."</p>

  <p>"Both live in Holloway. Shall I ask Hutchins to come here to see
  you&mdash;say to-morrow? He is doing nothing."</p>

  <p>"No," replied Carrados. "To-morrow I must call on my brokers and my time
  may be filled up."</p>

  <p>"Quite right; you mustn't neglect your own affairs for
  this&mdash;experiment," assented Carlyle.</p>

  <p>"Besides, I should prefer to drop in on Hutchins at his own home. Now,
  Louis, enough of the honest old man for one night. I have a lovely thing by
  Eumenes that I want to show you. To-day is&mdash;Tuesday. Come to dinner on
  Sunday and pour the vials of your ridicule on my want of success."</p>

  <p>"That's an amiable way of putting it," replied Carlyle. "All right, I
  will."</p>

  <p>Two hours later Carrados was again in his study, apparently, for a wonder,
  sitting idle. Sometimes he smiled to himself, and once or twice he laughed a
  little, but for the most part his pleasant, impassive face reflected no
  emotion and he sat with his useless eyes tranquilly fixed on an unseen
  distance. It was a fantastic caprice of the man to mock his sightlessness by
  a parade of light, and under the soft brilliance of a dozen electric brackets
  the room was as bright as day. At length he stood up and rang the bell.</p>

  <p>"I suppose Mr Greatorex isn't still here by any chance, Parkinson?" he
  asked, referring to his secretary.</p>

  <p>"I think not, sir, but I will ascertain," replied the man.</p>

  <p>"Never mind. Go to his room and bring me the last two files of <i>The
  Times</i>. Now"&mdash;when he returned&mdash;"turn to the earliest you have
  there. The date?"</p>

  <p>"November the second."</p>

  <p>"That will do. Find the Money Market; it will be in the Supplement. Now
  look down the columns until you come to British Railways."</p>

  <p>"I have it, sir."</p>

  <p>"Central and Suburban. Read the closing price and the change."</p>

  <p>"Central and Suburban Ordinary, 66-1/2 - 67-1/2, fall 1/8. Preferred
  Ordinary, 81 - 81-1/2, no change. Deferred Ordinary, 27-1/2 - 27-3/4, fall
  1/4. That is all, sir."</p>

  <p>"Now take a paper about a week on. Read the Deferred only."</p>

  <p>"27 - 27-1/4, no change."</p>

  <p>"Another week."</p>

  <p>"29-1/2 - 30, rise 5/8."</p>

  <p>"Another."</p>

  <p>"31-1/2 - 32-1/2, rise 1."</p>

  <p>"Very good. Now on Tuesday the twenty-seventh November."</p>

  <p>"31-7/8 - 32-3/4, rise 1/2."</p>

  <p>"Yes. The next day."</p>

  <p>"24-1/2 - 23-1/2, fall 9."</p>

  <p>"Quite so, Parkinson. There had been an accident, you see."</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir. Very unpleasant accident. Jane knows a person whose sister's
  young man has a cousin who had his arm torn off in it&mdash;torn off at the
  socket, she says, sir. It seems to bring it home to one, sir."</p>

  <p>"That is all. Stay&mdash;in the paper you have, look down the first money
  column and see if there is any reference to the Central and Suburban."</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir. 'City and Suburbans, which after their late depression on the
  projected extension of the motor bus service, had been steadily creeping up
  on the abandonment of the scheme, and as a result of their own excellent
  traffic returns, suffered a heavy slump through the lamentable accident of
  Thursday night. The Deferred in particular at one time fell eleven points as
  it was felt that the possible dividend, with which rumour has of late been
  busy, was now out of the question.'"</p>

  <p>"Yes; that is all. Now you can take the papers back. And let it be a
  warning to you, Parkinson, not to invest your savings in speculative railway
  deferreds."</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir. Thank you, sir, I will endeavour to remember." He lingered for
  a moment as he shook the file of papers level. "I may say, sir, that I have
  my eye on a small block of cottage property at Acton. But even cottage
  property scarcely seems safe from legislative depredation now, sir."</p>

  <p>The next day Mr Carrados called on his brokers in the city. It is to be
  presumed that he got through his private business quicker than he expected,
  for after leaving Austin Friars he continued his journey to Holloway, where
  he found Hutchins at home and sitting morosely before his kitchen fire.
  Rightly assuming that his luxuriant car would involve him in a certain amount
  of public attention in Klondyke Street, the blind man dismissed it some
  distance from the house, and walked the rest of the way, guided by the almost
  imperceptible touch of Parkinson's arm.</p>

  <p>"Here is a gentleman to see you, father," explained Miss Hutchins, who had
  come to the door. She divined the relative positions of the two visitors at a
  glance.</p>

  <p>"Then why don't you take him into the parlour?" grumbled the ex-driver.
  His face was a testimonial of hard work and general sobriety but at the
  moment one might hazard from his voice and manner that he had been drinking
  earlier in the day.</p>

  <p>"I don't think that the gentleman would be impressed by the difference
  between our parlour and our kitchen," replied the girl quaintly, "and it is
  warmer here."</p>

  <p>"What's the matter with the parlour now?" demanded her father sourly. "It
  was good enough for your mother and me. It used to be good enough for
  you."</p>

  <p>"There is nothing the matter with it, nor with the kitchen either." She
  turned impassively to the two who had followed her along the narrow passage.
  "Will you go in, sir?"</p>

  <p>"I don't want to see no gentleman," cried Hutchins noisily.
  "Unless"&mdash;his manner suddenly changed to one of pitiable
  anxiety&mdash;"unless you're from the Company, sir,
  to&mdash;to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No; I have come on Mr Carlyle's behalf," replied Carrados, walking to a
  chair as though he moved by a kind of instinct.</p>

  <p>Hutchins laughed his wry contempt.</p>

  <p>"Mr Carlyle!" he reiterated; "Mr Carlyle! Fat lot of good he's been. Why
  don't he <i>do</i> something for his money?"</p>

  <p>"He has," replied Carrados, with imperturbable good-humour; "he has sent
  me. Now, I want to ask you a few questions."</p>

  <p>"A few questions!" roared the irate man. "Why, blast it, I have done
  nothing else but answer questions for a month. I didn't pay Mr Carlyle to ask
  me questions; I can get enough of that for nixes. Why don't you go and ask Mr
  Herbert Ananias Mead your few questions&mdash;then you might find out
  something."</p>

  <p>There was a slight movement by the door and Carrados knew that the girl
  had quietly left the room.</p>

  <p>"You saw that, sir?" demanded the father, diverted to a new line of
  bitterness. "You saw that girl&mdash;my own daughter, that I've worked for
  all her life?"</p>

  <p>"No," replied Carrados.</p>

  <p>"The girl that's just gone out&mdash;she's my daughter," explained
  Hutchins.</p>

  <p>"I know, but I did not see her. I see nothing. I am blind."</p>

  <p>"Blind!" exclaimed the old fellow, sitting up in startled wonderment. "You
  mean it, sir? You walk all right and you look at me as if you saw me. You're
  kidding surely."</p>

  <p>"No," smiled Carrados. "It's quite right."</p>

  <p>"Then it's a funny business, sir&mdash;you what are blind expecting to
  find something that those with their eyes couldn't," ruminated Hutchins
  sagely.</p>

  <p>"There are things that you can't see with your eyes, Hutchins."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you are right, sir. Well, what is it you want to know?"</p>

  <p>"Light a cigar first," said the blind man, holding out his case and
  waiting until the various sounds told him that his host was smoking
  contentedly. "The train you were driving at the time of the accident was the
  six-twenty-seven from Notcliff. It stopped everywhere until it reached
  Lambeth Bridge, the chief London station of your line. There it became
  something of an express, and leaving Lambeth Bridge at seven-eleven, should
  not stop again until it fetched Swanstead on Thames, eleven miles out, at
  seven-thirty-four. Then it stopped on and off from Swanstead to Ingerfield,
  the terminus of that branch, which it reached at eight-five."</p>

  <p>Hutchins nodded, and then, remembering, said: "That's right, sir."</p>

  <p>"That was your business all day&mdash;running between Notcliff and
  Ingerfield?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir. Three journeys up and three down mostly."</p>

  <p>"With the same stops on all the down journeys?"</p>

  <p>"No. The seven-eleven is the only one that does a run from the Bridge to
  Swanstead. You see, it is just on the close of the evening rush, as they call
  it. A good many late business gentlemen living at Swanstead use the
  seven-eleven regular. The other journeys we stop at every station to Lambeth
  Bridge, and then here and there beyond."</p>

  <p>"There are, of course, other trains doing exactly the same journey&mdash;a
  service, in fact?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir. About six."</p>

  <p>"And do any of those&mdash;say, during the rush&mdash;do any of those run
  non-stop from Lambeth to Swanstead?"</p>

  <p>Hutchins reflected a moment. All the choler and restlessness had melted
  out of the man's face. He was again the excellent artisan, slow but capable
  and self-reliant.</p>

  <p>"That I couldn't definitely say, sir. Very few short-distance trains pass
  the junction, but some of those may. A guide would show us in a minute but I
  haven't got one."</p>

  <p>"Never mind. You said at the inquest that it was no uncommon thing for you
  to be pulled up at the 'stop' signal east of Knight's Cross Station. How
  often would that happen&mdash;only with the seven-eleven, mind."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps three times a week; perhaps twice."</p>

  <p>"The accident was on a Thursday. Have you noticed that you were pulled up
  oftener on a Thursday than on any other day?"</p>

  <p>A smile crossed the driver's face at the question.</p>

  <p>"You don't happen to live at Swanstead yourself, sir?" he asked in
  reply.</p>

  <p>"No," admitted Carrados. "Why?"</p>

  <p>"Well, sir, we were <i>always</i> pulled up on Thursday; practically
  always, you may say. It got to be quite a saying among those who used the
  train regular; they used to look out for it."</p>

  <p>Carrados's sightless eyes had the one quality of concealing emotion
  supremely. "Oh," he commented softly, "always; and it was quite a saying, was
  it? And <i>why</i> was it always so on Thursday?"</p>

  <p>"It had to do with the early closing, I'm told. The suburban traffic was a
  bit different. By rights we ought to have been set back two minutes for that
  day, but I suppose it wasn't thought worth while to alter us in the
  time-table, so we most always had to wait outside Three Deep tunnel for a
  west-bound electric to make good."</p>

  <p>"You were prepared for it then?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir, I was," said Hutchins, reddening at some recollection, "and
  very down about it was one of the jury over that. But, mayhap once in three
  months, I did get through even on a Thursday, and it's not for me to question
  whether things are right or wrong just because they are not what I may
  expect. The signals are my orders, sir&mdash;stop! go on! and it's for me to
  obey, as you would a general on the field of battle. What would happen
  otherwise! It was nonsense what they said about going cautious; and the man
  who started it was a barber who didn't know the difference between a
  'distance' and a 'stop' signal down to the minute they gave their verdict. My
  orders, sir, given me by that signal, was 'Go right ahead and keep to your
  running time!'"</p>

  <p>Carrados nodded a soothing assent. "That is all, I think," he
  remarked.</p>

  <p>"All!" exclaimed Hutchins in surprise. "Why, sir, you can't have got much
  idea of it yet."</p>

  <p>"Quite enough. And I know it isn't pleasant for you to be taken along the
  same ground over and over again."</p>

  <p>The man moved awkwardly in his chair and pulled nervously at his grizzled
  beard.</p>

  <p>"You mustn't take any notice of what I said just now, sir," he apologized.
  "You somehow make me feel that something may come of it; but I've been
  badgered about and accused and cross-examined from one to another of them
  these weeks till it's fairly made me bitter against everything. And now they
  talk of putting me in a lavatory&mdash;me that has been with the company for
  five and forty years and on the foot-plate thirty-two&mdash;a man suspected
  of running past a danger signal."</p>

  <p>"You have had a rough time, Hutchins; you will have to exercise your
  patience a little longer yet," said Carrados sympathetically.</p>

  <p>"You think something may come of it, sir? You think you will be able to
  clear me? Believe me, sir, if you could give me something to look forward to
  it might save me from&mdash;&mdash;" He pulled himself up and shook his head
  sorrowfully. "I've been near it," he added simply.</p>

  <p>Carrados reflected and took his resolution.</p>

  <p>"To-day is Wednesday. I think you may hope to hear something from your
  general manager towards the middle of next week."</p>

  <p>"Good God, sir! You really mean that?"</p>

  <p>"In the interval show your good sense by behaving reasonably. Keep civilly
  to yourself and don't talk. Above all"&mdash;he nodded towards a quart jug
  that stood on the table between them, an incident that filled the
  simple-minded engineer with boundless wonder when he recalled it
  afterwards&mdash;"above all, leave that alone."</p>

  <p>Hutchins snatched up the vessel and brought it crashing down on the
  hearthstone, his face shining with a set resolution.</p>

  <p>"I've done with it, sir. It was the bitterness and despair that drove me
  to that. Now I can do without it."</p>

  <p>The door was hastily opened and Miss Hutchins looked anxiously from her
  father to the visitors and back again.</p>

  <p>"Oh, whatever is the matter?" she exclaimed. "I heard a great crash."</p>

  <p>"This gentleman is going to clear me, Meg, my dear," blurted out the old
  man irrepressibly. "And I've done with the drink for ever."</p>

  <p>"Hutchins! Hutchins!" said Carrados warningly.</p>

  <p>"My daughter, sir; you wouldn't have her not know?" pleaded Hutchins,
  rather crest-fallen. "It won't go any further."</p>

  <p>Carrados laughed quietly to himself as he felt Margaret Hutchins's
  startled and questioning eyes attempting to read his mind. He shook hands
  with the engine-driver without further comment, however, and walked out into
  the commonplace little street under Parkinson's unobtrusive guidance.</p>

  <p>"Very nice of Miss Hutchins to go into half-mourning, Parkinson," he
  remarked as they went along. "Thoughtful, and yet not ostentatious."</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," agreed Parkinson, who had long ceased to wonder at his
  master's perceptions.</p>

  <p>"The Romans, Parkinson, had a saying to the effect that gold carries no
  smell. That is a pity sometimes. What jewellery did Miss Hutchins wear?"</p>

  <p>"Very little, sir. A plain gold brooch representing a
  merry-thought&mdash;the merry-thought of a sparrow, I should say, sir. The
  only other article was a smooth-backed gun-metal watch, suspended from a
  gun-metal bow."</p>

  <p>"Nothing showy or expensive, eh?"</p>

  <p>"Oh dear no, sir. Quite appropriate for a young person of her
  position."</p>

  <p>"Just what I should have expected." He slackened his pace. "We are passing
  a hoarding, are we not?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir."</p>

  <p>"We will stand here a moment. Read me the letterpress of the poster before
  us."</p>

  <p>"This 'Oxo' one, sir?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"'Oxo,' sir."</p>

  <p>Carrados was convulsed with silent laughter. Parkinson had infinitely more
  dignity and conceded merely a tolerant recognition of the ludicrous.</p>

  <p>"That was a bad shot, Parkinson," remarked his master when he could speak.
  "We will try another."</p>

  <p>For three minutes, with scrupulous conscientiousness on the part of the
  reader and every appearance of keen interest on the part of the hearer, there
  were set forth the particulars of a sale by auction of superfluous timber and
  builders' material.</p>

  <p>"That will do," said Carrados, when the last detail had been reached. "We
  can be seen from the door of No. 107 still?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir."</p>

  <p>"No indication of anyone coming to us from there?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir."</p>

  <p>Carrados walked thoughtfully on again. In the Holloway Road they rejoined
  the waiting motor car. "Lambeth Bridge Station," was the order the driver
  received.</p>

  <p>From the station the car was sent on home and Parkinson was instructed to
  take two first-class singles for Richmond, which could be reached by changing
  at Stafford Road. The "evening rush" had not yet commenced and they had no
  difficulty in finding an empty carriage when the train came in.</p>

  <p>Parkinson was kept busy that journey describing what he saw at various
  points between Lambeth Bridge and Knight's Cross. For a quarter of a mile
  Carrados's demands on the eyes and the memory of his remarkable servant were
  wide and incessant. Then his questions ceased. They had passed the "stop"
  signal, east of Knight's Cross Station.</p>

  <p>The following afternoon they made the return journey as far as Knight's
  Cross. This time, however, the surroundings failed to interest Carrados. "We
  are going to look at some rooms," was the information he offered on the
  subject, and an imperturbable "Yes, sir" had been the extent of Parkinson's
  comment on the unusual proceeding. After leaving the station they turned
  sharply along a road that ran parallel with the line, a dull thoroughfare of
  substantial, elderly houses that were beginning to sink into decrepitude.
  Here and there a corner residence displayed the brass plate of a professional
  occupant, but for the most part they were given up to the various branches of
  second-rate apartment letting.</p>

  <p>"The third house after the one with the flagstaff," said Carrados.</p>

  <p>Parkinson rang the bell, which was answered by a young servant, who took
  an early opportunity of assuring them that she was not tidy as it was rather
  early in the afternoon. She informed Carrados, in reply to his inquiry, that
  Miss Chubb was at home, and showed them into a melancholy little sitting-room
  to await her appearance.</p>

  <p>"I shall be 'almost' blind here, Parkinson," remarked Carrados, walking
  about the room. "It saves explanation."</p>

  <p>"Very good, sir," replied Parkinson.</p>

  <p>Five minutes later, an interval suggesting that Miss Chubb also found it
  rather early in the afternoon, Carrados was arranging to take rooms for his
  attendant and himself for the short time that he would be in London, seeing
  an oculist.</p>

  <p>"One bedroom, mine, must face north," he stipulated. "It has to do with
  the light."</p>

  <p>Miss Chubb replied that she quite understood. Some gentlemen, she added,
  had their requirements, others their fancies. She endeavoured to suit all.
  The bedroom she had in view from the first <i>did</i> face north. She would
  not have known, only the last gentleman, curiously enough, had made the same
  request.</p>

  <p>"A sufferer like myself?" inquired Carrados affably.</p>

  <p>Miss Chubb did not think so. In his case she regarded it merely as a
  fancy. He had said that he could not sleep on any other side. She had had to
  turn out of her own room to accommodate him, but if one kept an
  apartment-house one had to be adaptable; and Mr Ghoosh was certainly very
  liberal in his ideas.</p>

  <p>"Ghoosh? An Indian gentleman, I presume?" hazarded Carrados.</p>

  <p>It appeared that Mr Ghoosh was an Indian. Miss Chubb confided that at
  first she had been rather perturbed at the idea of taking in "a black man,"
  as she confessed to regarding him. She reiterated, however, that Mr Ghoosh
  proved to be "quite the gentleman." Five minutes of affability put Carrados
  in full possession of Mr Ghoosh's manner of life and movements&mdash;the
  dates of his arrival and departure, his solitariness and his daily
  habits.</p>

  <p>"This would be the best bedroom," said Miss Chubb.</p>

  <p>It was a fair-sized room on the first floor. The window looked out on to
  the roof of an outbuilding; beyond, the deep cutting of the railway line.
  Opposite stood the dead wall that Mr Carlyle had spoken of.</p>

  <p>Carrados "looked" round the room with the discriminating glance that
  sometimes proved so embarrassing to those who knew him.</p>

  <p>"I have to take a little daily exercise," he remarked, walking to the
  window and running his hand up the woodwork. "You will not mind my fixing a
  'developer' here, Miss Chubb&mdash;a few small screws?"</p>

  <p>Miss Chubb thought not. Then she was sure not. Finally she ridiculed the
  idea of minding with scorn.</p>

  <p>"If there is width enough," mused Carrados, spanning the upright
  critically. "Do you happen to have a wooden foot-rule convenient?"</p>

  <p>"Well, to be sure!" exclaimed Miss Chubb, opening a rapid succession of
  drawers until she produced the required article. "When we did out this room
  after Mr Ghoosh, there was this very ruler among the things that he hadn't
  thought worth taking. This is what you require, sir?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Carrados, accepting it, "I think this is exactly what I
  require." It was a common new white-wood rule, such as one might buy at any
  small stationer's for a penny. He carelessly took off the width of the
  upright, reading the figures with a touch; and then continued to run a
  finger-tip delicately up and down the edges of the instrument.</p>

  <p>"Four and seven-eighths," was his unspoken conclusion.</p>

  <p>"I hope it will do, sir."</p>

  <p>"Admirably," replied Carrados. "But I haven't reached the end of my
  requirements yet, Miss Chubb."</p>

  <p>"No, sir?" said the landlady, feeling that it would be a pleasure to
  oblige so agreeable a gentleman, "what else might there be?"</p>

  <p>"Although I can see very little I like to have a light, but not any kind
  of light. Gas I cannot do with. Do you think that you would be able to find
  me an oil lamp?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly, sir. I got out a very nice brass lamp that I have specially
  for Mr Ghoosh. He read a good deal of an evening and he preferred a
  lamp."</p>

  <p>"That is very convenient. I suppose it is large enough to burn for a whole
  evening?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, indeed. And very particular he was always to have it filled every
  day."</p>

  <p>"A lamp without oil is not very useful," smiled Carrados, following her
  towards another room, and absentmindedly slipping the foot-rule into his
  pocket.</p>

  <p>Whatever Parkinson thought of the arrangement of going into second-rate
  apartments in an obscure street it is to be inferred that his devotion to his
  master was sufficient to overcome his private emotions as a self-respecting
  "man." At all events, as they were approaching the station he asked, and
  without a trace of feeling, whether there were any orders for him with
  reference to the proposed migration.</p>

  <p>"None, Parkinson," replied his master. "We must be satisfied with our
  present quarters."</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon, sir," said Parkinson, with some constraint. "I
  understood that you had taken the rooms for a week certain."</p>

  <p>"I am afraid that Miss Chubb will be under the same impression. Unforeseen
  circumstances will prevent our going, however. Mr Greatorex must write
  to-morrow, enclosing a cheque, with my regrets, and adding a penny for this
  ruler which I seem to have brought away with me. It, at least, is something
  for the money."</p>

  <p>Parkinson may be excused for not attempting to understand the course of
  events.</p>

  <p>"Here is your train coming in, sir," he merely said.</p>

  <p>"We will let it go and wait for another. Is there a signal at either end
  of the platform?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir; at the further end."</p>

  <p>"Let us walk towards it. Are there any of the porters or officials about
  here?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir; none."</p>

  <p>"Take this ruler. I want you to go up the steps&mdash;there are steps up
  the signal, by the way?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir."</p>

  <p>"I want you to measure the glass of the lamp. Do not go up any higher than
  is necessary, but if you have to stretch be careful not to mark on the
  measurement with your nail, although the impulse is a natural one. That has
  been done already."</p>

  <p>Parkinson looked apprehensively around and about. Fortunately the part was
  a dark and unfrequented spot and everyone else was moving towards the exit at
  the other end of the platform. Fortunately, also, the signal was not a high
  one.</p>

  <p>"As near as I can judge on the rounded surface, the glass is four and
  seven-eighths across," reported Parkinson.</p>

  <p>"Thank you," replied Carrados, returning the measure to his pocket, "four
  and seven-eighths is quite near enough. Now we will take the next train
  back."</p>

  <p>Sunday evening came, and with it Mr Carlyle to The Turrets at the
  appointed hour. He brought to the situation a mind poised for any eventuality
  and a trenchant eye. As the time went on and the impenetrable Carrados made
  no allusion to the case, Carlyle's manner inclined to a waggish commiseration
  of his host's position. Actually, he said little, but the crisp precision of
  his voice when the path lay open to a remark of any significance left little
  to be said.</p>

  <p>It was not until they had finished dinner and returned to the library that
  Carrados gave the slightest hint of anything unusual being in the air. His
  first indication of coming events was to remove the key from the outside to
  the inside of the door.</p>

  <p>"What are you doing, Max?" demanded Mr Carlyle, his curiosity overcoming
  the indirect attitude.</p>

  <p>"You have been very entertaining, Louis," replied his friend, "but
  Parkinson should be back very soon now and it is as well to be prepared. Do
  you happen to carry a revolver?"</p>

  <p>"Not when I come to dine with you, Max," replied Carlyle, with all the
  aplomb he could muster. "Is it usual?"</p>

  <p>Carrados smiled affectionately at his guest's agile recovery and touched
  the secret spring of a drawer in an antique bureau by his side. The little
  hidden receptacle shot smoothly out, disclosing a pair of dull-blued
  pistols.</p>

  <p>"To-night, at all events, it might be prudent," he replied, handing one to
  Carlyle and putting the other into his own pocket. "Our man may be here at
  any minute, and we do not know in what temper he will come."</p>

  <p>"Our man!" exclaimed Carlyle, craning forward in excitement. "Max! you
  don't mean to say that you have got Mead to admit it?"</p>

  <p>"No one has admitted it," said Carrados. "And it is not Mead."</p>

  <p>"Not Mead.... Do you mean that Hutchins&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"Neither Mead nor Hutchins. The man who tampered with the signal&mdash;for
  Hutchins was right and a green light <i>was</i> exhibited&mdash;is a young
  Indian from Bengal. His name is Drishna and he lives at Swanstead."</p>

  <p>Mr Carlyle stared at his friend between sheer surprise and blank
  incredulity.</p>

  <p>"You really mean this, Carrados?" he said.</p>

  <p>"My fatal reputation for humour!" smiled Carrados. "If I am wrong, Louis,
  the next hour will expose it."</p>

  <p>"But why&mdash;why&mdash;why? The colossal villainy, the unparalleled
  audacity!" Mr Carlyle lost himself among incredulous superlatives and could
  only stare.</p>

  <p>"Chiefly to get himself out of a disastrous speculation," replied
  Carrados, answering the question. "If there was another motive&mdash;or at
  least an incentive&mdash;which I suspect, doubtless we shall hear of it."</p>

  <p>"All the same, Max, I don't think that you have treated me quite fairly,"
  protested Carlyle, getting over his first surprise and passing to a sense of
  injury. "Here we are and I know nothing, absolutely nothing, of the whole
  affair."</p>

  <p>"We both have our ideas of pleasantry, Louis," replied Carrados genially.
  "But I dare say you are right and perhaps there is still time to atone." In
  the fewest possible words he outlined the course of his investigations. "And
  now you know all that is to be known until Drishna arrives."</p>

  <p>"But will he come?" questioned Carlyle doubtfully. "He may be
  suspicious."</p>

  <p>"Yes, he will be suspicious."</p>

  <p>"Then he will not come."</p>

  <p>"On the contrary, Louis, he will come because my letter will make him
  suspicious. He <i>is</i> coming; otherwise Parkinson would have telephoned me
  at once and we should have had to take other measures."</p>

  <p>"What did you say, Max?" asked Carlyle curiously.</p>

  <p>"I wrote that I was anxious to discuss an Indo-Scythian inscription with
  him, and sent my car in the hope that he would be able to oblige me."</p>

  <p>"But is he interested in Indo-Scythian inscriptions?"</p>

  <p>"I haven't the faintest idea," admitted Carrados, and Mr Carlyle was
  throwing up his hands in despair when the sound of a motor car wheels softly
  kissing the gravel surface of the drive outside brought him to his feet.</p>

  <p>"By gad, you are right, Max!" he exclaimed, peeping through the curtains.
  "There is a man inside."</p>

  <p>"Mr Drishna," announced Parkinson, a minute later.</p>

  <p>The visitor came into the room with leisurely self-possession that might
  have been real or a desperate assumption. He was a slightly built young man
  of about twenty-five, with black hair and eyes, a small, carefully trained
  moustache, and a dark olive skin. His physiognomy was not displeasing, but
  his expression had a harsh and supercilious tinge. In attire he erred towards
  the immaculately spruce.</p>

  <p>"Mr Carrados?" he said inquiringly.</p>

  <p>Carrados, who had risen, bowed slightly without offering his hand.</p>

  <p>"This gentleman," he said, indicating his friend, "is Mr Carlyle, the
  celebrated private detective."</p>

  <p>The Indian shot a very sharp glance at the object of this description.
  Then he sat down.</p>

  <p>"You wrote me a letter, Mr Carrados," he remarked, in English that
  scarcely betrayed any foreign origin, "a rather curious letter, I may say.
  You asked me about an ancient inscription. I know nothing of antiquities; but
  I thought, as you had sent, that it would be more courteous if I came and
  explained this to you."</p>

  <p>"That was the object of my letter," replied Carrados.</p>

  <p>"You wished to see me?" said Drishna, unable to stand the ordeal of the
  silence that Carrados imposed after his remark.</p>

  <p>"When you left Miss Chubb's house you left a ruler behind." One lay on the
  desk by Carrados and he took it up as he spoke.</p>

  <p>"I don't understand what you are talking about," said Drishna guardedly.
  "You are making some mistake."</p>

  <p>"The ruler was marked at four and seven-eighths inches&mdash;the measure
  of the glass of the signal lamp outside."</p>

  <p>The unfortunate young man was unable to repress a start. His face lost its
  healthy tone. Then, with a sudden impulse, he made a step forward and
  snatched the object from Carrados's hand.</p>

  <p>"If it is mine I have a right to it," he exclaimed, snapping the ruler in
  two and throwing it on to the back of the blazing fire. "It is nothing."</p>

  <p>"Pardon me, I did not say that the one you have so impetuously disposed of
  was yours. As a matter of fact, it was mine. Yours is&mdash;elsewhere."</p>

  <p>"Wherever it is you have no right to it if it is mine," panted Drishna,
  with rising excitement. "You are a thief, Mr Carrados. I will not stay any
  longer here."</p>

  <p>He jumped up and turned towards the door. Carlyle made a step forward, but
  the precaution was unnecessary.</p>

  <p>"One moment, Mr Drishna," interposed Carrados, in his smoothest tones. "It
  is a pity, after you have come so far, to leave without hearing of my
  investigations in the neighbourhood of Shaftesbury Avenue."</p>

  <p>Drishna sat down again.</p>

  <p>"As you like," he muttered. "It does not interest me."</p>

  <p>"I wanted to obtain a lamp of a certain pattern," continued Carrados. "It
  seemed to me that the simplest explanation would be to say that I wanted it
  for a motor car. Naturally I went to Long Acre. At the first shop I said:
  'Wasn't it here that a friend of mine, an Indian gentleman, recently had a
  lamp made with a green glass that was nearly five inches across?' No, it was
  not there but they could make me one. At the next shop the same; at the
  third, and fourth, and so on. Finally my persistence was rewarded. I found
  the place where the lamp had been made, and at the cost of ordering another I
  obtained all the details I wanted. It was news to them, the shopman informed
  me, that in some parts of India green was the danger colour and therefore
  tail lamps had to show a green light. The incident made some impression on
  him and he would be able to identify their customer&mdash;who paid in advance
  and gave no address&mdash;among a thousand of his countrymen. Do I succeed in
  interesting you, Mr Drishna?"</p>

  <p>"Do you?" replied Drishna, with a languid yawn. "Do I look
  interested?"</p>

  <p>"You must make allowance for my unfortunate blindness," apologized
  Carrados, with grim irony.</p>

  <p>"Blindness!" exclaimed Drishna, dropping his affectation of unconcern as
  though electrified by the word, "do you mean&mdash;really blind&mdash;that
  you do not see me?"</p>

  <p>"Alas, no," admitted Carrados.</p>

  <p>The Indian withdrew his right hand from his coat pocket and with a tragic
  gesture flung a heavy revolver down on the table between them.</p>

  <p>"I have had you covered all the time, Mr Carrados, and if I had wished to
  go and you or your friend had raised a hand to stop me, it would have been at
  the peril of your lives," he said, in a voice of melancholy triumph. "But
  what is the use of defying fate, and who successfully evades his destiny? A
  month ago I went to see one of our people who reads the future and sought to
  know the course of certain events. 'You need fear no human eye,' was the
  message given to me. Then she added: 'But when the sightless sees the unseen,
  make your peace with Yama.' And I thought she spoke of the Great
  Hereafter!"</p>

  <p>"This amounts to an admission of your guilt," exclaimed Mr Carlyle
  practically.</p>

  <p>"I bow to the decree of fate," replied Drishna. "And it is fitting to the
  universal irony of existence that a blind man should be the instrument. I
  don't imagine, Mr Carlyle," he added maliciously, "that you, with your eyes,
  would ever have brought that result about."</p>

  <p>"You are a very cold-blooded young scoundrel, sir!" retorted Mr Carlyle.
  "Good heavens! do you realize that you are responsible for the death of
  scores of innocent men and women?"</p>

  <p>"Do <i>you</i> realise, Mr Carlyle, that you and your Government and your
  soldiers are responsible for the death of thousands of innocent men and women
  in my country every day? If England was occupied by the Germans who quartered
  an army and an administration with their wives and their families and all
  their expensive paraphernalia on the unfortunate country until the whole
  nation was reduced to the verge of famine, and the appointment of every new
  official meant the callous death sentence on a thousand men and women to pay
  his salary, then if you went to Berlin and wrecked a train you would be
  hailed a patriot. What Boadicea did and&mdash;and Samson, so have I. If they
  were heroes, so am I."</p>

  <p>"Well, upon my word!" cried the highly scandalized Carlyle, "what next!
  Boadicea was a&mdash;er&mdash;semi-legendary person, whom we may possibly
  admire at a distance. Personally, I do not profess to express an opinion. But
  Samson, I would remind you, is a Biblical character. Samson was mocked as an
  enemy. You, I do not doubt, have been entertained as a friend."</p>

  <p>"And haven't I been mocked and despised and sneered at every day of my
  life here by your supercilious, superior, empty-headed men?" flashed back
  Drishna, his eyes leaping into malignity and his voice trembling with sudden
  passion. "Oh! how I hated them as I passed them in the street and recognized
  by a thousand petty insults their lordly English contempt for me as an
  inferior being&mdash;a nigger. How I longed with Caligula that a nation had a
  single neck that I might destroy it at one blow. I loathe you in your
  complacent hypocrisy, Mr Carlyle, despise and utterly abominate you from an
  eminence of superiority that you can never even understand."</p>

  <p>"I think we are getting rather away from the point, Mr Drishna,"
  interposed Carrados, with the impartiality of a judge. "Unless I am
  misinformed, you are not so ungallant as to include everyone you have met
  here in your execration?"</p>

  <p>"Ah, no," admitted Drishna, descending into a quite ingenuous frankness.
  "Much as I hate your men I love your women. How is it possible that a nation
  should be so divided&mdash;its men so dull-witted and offensive, its women so
  quick, sympathetic and capable of appreciating?"</p>

  <p>"But a little expensive, too, at times?" suggested Carrados.</p>

  <p>Drishna sighed heavily.</p>

  <p>"Yes; it is incredible. It is the generosity of their large nature. My
  allowance, though what most of you would call noble, has proved quite
  inadequate. I was compelled to borrow money and the interest became
  overwhelming. Bankruptcy was impracticable because I should have then been
  recalled by my people, and much as I detest England a certain reason made the
  thought of leaving it unbearable."</p>

  <p>"Connected with the Arcady Theatre?"</p>

  <p>"You know? Well, do not let us introduce the lady's name. In order to
  restore myself I speculated on the Stock Exchange. My credit was good through
  my father's position and the standing of the firm to which I am attached. I
  heard on reliable authority, and very early, that the Central and Suburban,
  and the Deferred especially, was safe to fall heavily, through a motor bus
  amalgamation that was then a secret. I opened a bear account and sold
  largely. The shares fell, but only fractionally, and I waited. Then,
  unfortunately, they began to go up. Adverse forces were at work and rumours
  were put about. I could not stand the settlement, and in order to carry over
  an account I was literally compelled to deal temporarily with some securities
  that were not technically my own property."</p>

  <p>"Embezzlement, sir," commented Mr Carlyle icily. "But what is embezzlement
  on the top of wholesale murder!"</p>

  <p>"That is what it is called. In my case, however, it was only to be
  temporary. Unfortunately, the rise continued. Then, at the height of my
  despair, I chanced to be returning to Swanstead rather earlier than usual one
  evening, and the train was stopped at a certain signal to let another pass.
  There was conversation in the carriage and I learned certain details. One
  said that there would be an accident some day, and so forth. In a
  flash&mdash;as by an inspiration&mdash;I saw how the circumstance might be
  turned to account. A bad accident and the shares would certainly fall and my
  position would be retrieved. I think Mr Carrados has somehow learned the
  rest."</p>

  <p>"Max," said Mr Carlyle, with emotion, "is there any reason why you should
  not send your man for a police officer and have this monster arrested on his
  own confession without further delay?"</p>

  <p>"Pray do so, Mr Carrados," acquiesced Drishna. "I shall certainly be
  hanged, but the speech I shall prepare will ring from one end of India to the
  other; my memory will be venerated as that of a martyr; and the emancipation
  of my motherland will be hastened by my sacrifice."</p>

  <p>"In other words," commented Carrados, "there will be disturbances at
  half-a-dozen disaffected places, a few unfortunate police will be clubbed to
  death, and possibly worse things may happen. That does not suit us, Mr
  Drishna."</p>

  <p>"And how do you propose to prevent it?" asked Drishna, with cool
  assurance.</p>

  <p>"It is very unpleasant being hanged on a dark winter morning; very cold,
  very friendless, very inhuman. The long trial, the solitude and the
  confinement, the thoughts of the long sleepless night before, the hangman and
  the pinioning and the noosing of the rope, are apt to prey on the
  imagination. Only a very stupid man can take hanging easily."</p>

  <p>"What do you want me to do instead, Mr Carrados?" asked Drishna
  shrewdly.</p>

  <p>Carrados's hand closed on the weapon that still lay on the table between
  them. Without a word he pushed it across.</p>

  <p>"I see," commented Drishna, with a short laugh and a gleaming eye. "Shoot
  myself and hush it up to suit your purpose. Withhold my message to save the
  exposures of a trial, and keep the flame from the torch of insurrectionary
  freedom."</p>

  <p>"Also," interposed Carrados mildly, "to save your worthy people a good
  deal of shame, and to save the lady who is nameless the unpleasant necessity
  of relinquishing the house and the income which you have just settled on her.
  She certainly would not then venerate your memory."</p>

  <p>"What is that?"</p>

  <p>"The transaction which you carried through was based on a felony and could
  not be upheld. The firm you dealt with will go to the courts, and the money,
  being directly traceable, will be held forfeit as no good consideration
  passed."</p>

  <p>"Max!" cried Mr Carlyle hotly, "you are not going to let this scoundrel
  cheat the gallows after all?"</p>

  <p>"The best use you can make of the gallows is to cheat it, Louis," replied
  Carrados. "Have you ever reflected what human beings will think of us a
  hundred years hence?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, of course I'm not really in favour of hanging," admitted Mr
  Carlyle.</p>

  <p>"Nobody really is. But we go on hanging. Mr Drishna is a dangerous animal
  who for the sake of pacific animals must cease to exist. Let his barbarous
  exploit pass into oblivion with him. The disadvantages of spreading it
  broadcast immeasurably outweigh the benefits."</p>

  <p>"I have considered," announced Drishna. "I will do as you wish."</p>

  <p>"Very well," said Carrados. "Here is some plain notepaper. You had better
  write a letter to someone saying that the financial difficulties in which you
  are involved make life unbearable."</p>

  <p>"But there are no financial difficulties&mdash;now."</p>

  <p>"That does not matter in the least. It will be put down to an
  hallucination and taken as showing the state of your mind."</p>

  <p>"But what guarantee have we that he will not escape?" whispered Mr
  Carlyle.</p>

  <p>"He cannot escape," replied Carrados tranquilly. "His identity is too
  clear."</p>

  <p>"I have no intention of trying to escape," put in Drishna, as he wrote.
  "You hardly imagine that I have not considered this eventuality, do you?"</p>

  <p>"All the same," murmured the ex-lawyer, "I should like to have a jury
  behind me. It is one thing to execute a man morally; it is another to do it
  almost literally."</p>

  <p>"Is that all right?" asked Drishna, passing across the letter he had
  written.</p>

  <p>Carrados smiled at this tribute to his perception.</p>

  <p>"Quite excellent," he replied courteously. "There is a train at
  nine-forty. Will that suit you?"</p>

  <p>Drishna nodded and stood up. Mr Carlyle had a very uneasy feeling that he
  ought to do something but could not suggest to himself what.</p>

  <p>The next moment he heard his friend heartily thanking the visitor for the
  assistance he had been in the matter of the Indo-Scythian inscription, as
  they walked across the hall together. Then a door closed.</p>

  <p>"I believe that there is something positively uncanny about Max at times,"
  murmured the perturbed gentleman to himself.</p>

  <h2><a id="story3"
     name="story3"></a>III. &mdash; THE TRAGEDY AT BROOKBEND COTTAGE</h2>

  <h3>Serialised in <i>The News Of The World</i>, Sep 7-14, 1913</h3>

  <p class="first">"Max," said Mr Carlyle, when Parkinson had closed the door
  behind him, "this is Lieutenant Hollyer, whom you consented to see."</p>

  <p>"To hear," corrected Carrados, smiling straight into the healthy and
  rather embarrassed face of the stranger before him. "Mr Hollyer knows of my
  disability?"</p>

  <p>"Mr Carlyle told me," said the young man, "but, as a matter of fact, I had
  heard of you before, Mr Carrados, from one of our men. It was in connexion
  with the foundering of the <i>Ivan Saratov</i>."</p>

  <p>Carrados wagged his head in good-humoured resignation.</p>

  <p>"And the owners were sworn to inviolable secrecy!" he exclaimed. "Well, it
  is inevitable, I suppose. Not another scuttling case, Mr Hollyer?"</p>

  <p>"No, mine is quite a private matter," replied the lieutenant. "My sister,
  Mrs Creake&mdash;but Mr Carlyle would tell you better than I can. He knows
  all about it."</p>

  <p>"No, no; Carlyle is a professional. Let me have it in the rough, Mr
  Hollyer. My ears are my eyes, you know."</p>

  <p>"Very well, sir. I can tell you what there is to tell, right enough, but I
  feel that when all's said and done it must sound very little to another,
  although it seems important enough to me."</p>

  <p>"We have occasionally found trifles of significance ourselves," said
  Carrados encouragingly. "Don't let that deter you."</p>

  <p>This was the essence of Lieutenant Hollyer's narrative:</p>

  <p>"I have a sister, Millicent, who is married to a man called Creake. She is
  about twenty-eight now and he is at least fifteen years older. Neither my
  mother (who has since died), nor I, cared very much about Creake. We had
  nothing particular against him, except, perhaps, the moderate disparity of
  age, but none of us appeared to have anything in common. He was a dark,
  taciturn man, and his moody silence froze up conversation. As a result, of
  course, we didn't see much of each other."</p>

  <p>"This, you must understand, was four or five years ago, Max," interposed
  Mr Carlyle officiously.</p>

  <p>Carrados maintained an uncompromising silence. Mr Carlyle blew his nose
  and contrived to impart a hurt significance into the operation. Then
  Lieutenant Hollyer continued:</p>

  <p>"Millicent married Creake after a very short engagement. It was a
  frightfully subdued wedding&mdash;more like a funeral to me. The man
  professed to have no relations and apparently he had scarcely any friends or
  business acquaintances. He was an agent for something or other and had an
  office off Holborn. I suppose he made a living out of it then, although we
  knew practically nothing of his private affairs, but I gather that it has
  been going down since, and I suspect that for the past few years they have
  been getting along almost entirely on Millicent's little income. You would
  like the particulars of that?"</p>

  <p>"Please," assented Carrados.</p>

  <p>"When our father died about seven years ago, he left three thousand
  pounds. It was invested in Canadian stock and brought in a little over a
  hundred a year. By his will my mother was to have the income of that for life
  and on her death it was to pass to Millicent, subject to the payment of a
  lump sum of five hundred pounds to me. But my father privately suggested to
  me that if I should have no particular use for the money at the time, he
  would propose my letting Millicent have the income of it until I did want it,
  as she would not be particularly well off. You see, Mr Carrados, a great deal
  more had been spent on my education and advancement than on her; I had my
  pay, and, of course, I could look out for myself better than a girl
  could."</p>

  <p>"Quite so," agreed Carrados.</p>

  <p>"Therefore I did nothing about that," continued the lieutenant. "Three
  years ago I was over again but I did not see much of them. They were living
  in lodgings. That was the only time since the marriage that I have seen them
  until last week. In the meanwhile our mother had died and Millicent had been
  receiving her income. She wrote me several letters at the time. Otherwise we
  did not correspond much, but about a year ago she sent me their new
  address&mdash;Brookbend Cottage, Mulling Common&mdash;a house that they had
  taken. When I got two months' leave I invited myself there as a matter of
  course, fully expecting to stay most of my time with them, but I made an
  excuse to get away after a week. The place was dismal and unendurable, the
  whole life and atmosphere indescribably depressing." He looked round with an
  instinct of caution, leaned forward earnestly, and dropped his voice. "Mr
  Carrados, it is my absolute conviction that Creake is only waiting for a
  favourable opportunity to murder Millicent."</p>

  <p>"Go on," said Carrados quietly. "A week of the depressing surroundings of
  Brookbend Cottage would not alone convince you of that, Mr Hollyer."</p>

  <p>"I am not so sure," declared Hollyer doubtfully. "There was a feeling of
  suspicion and&mdash;before me&mdash;polite hatred that would have gone a good
  way towards it. All the same there <i>was</i> something more definite.
  Millicent told me this the day after I went there. There is no doubt that a
  few months ago Creake deliberately planned to poison her with some
  weed-killer. She told me the circumstances in a rather distressed moment, but
  afterwards she refused to speak of it again&mdash;even weakly denied
  it&mdash;and, as a matter of fact, it was with the greatest difficulty that I
  could get her at any time to talk about her husband or his affairs. The gist
  of it was that she had the strongest suspicion that Creake doctored a bottle
  of stout which he expected she would drink for her supper when she was alone.
  The weed-killer, properly labelled, but also in a beer bottle, was kept with
  other miscellaneous liquids in the same cupboard as the beer but on a high
  shelf. When he found that it had miscarried he poured away the mixture,
  washed out the bottle and put in the dregs from another. There is no doubt in
  my mind that if he had come back and found Millicent dead or dying he would
  have contrived it to appear that she had made a mistake in the dark and drunk
  some of the poison before she found out."</p>

  <p>"Yes," assented Carrados. "The open way; the safe way."</p>

  <p>"You must understand that they live in a very small style, Mr Carrados,
  and Millicent is almost entirely in the man's power. The only servant they
  have is a woman who comes in for a few hours every day. The house is lonely
  and secluded. Creake is sometimes away for days and nights at a time, and
  Millicent, either through pride or indifference, seems to have dropped off
  all her old friends and to have made no others. He might poison her, bury the
  body in the garden, and be a thousand miles away before anyone began even to
  inquire about her. What am I to do, Mr Carrados?"</p>

  <p>"He is less likely to try poison than some other means now," pondered
  Carrados. "That having failed, his wife will always be on her guard. He may
  know, or at least suspect, that others know. No.... The common-sense
  precaution would be for your sister to leave the man, Mr Hollyer. She will
  not?"</p>

  <p>"No," admitted Hollyer, "she will not. I at once urged that." The young
  man struggled with some hesitation for a moment and then blurted out: "The
  fact is, Mr Carrados, I don't understand Millicent. She is not the girl she
  was. She hates Creake and treats him with a silent contempt that eats into
  their lives like acid, and yet she is so jealous of him that she will let
  nothing short of death part them. It is a horrible life they lead. I stood it
  for a week and I must say, much as I dislike my brother-in-law, that he has
  something to put up with. If only he got into a passion like a man and killed
  her it wouldn't be altogether incomprehensible."</p>

  <p>"That does not concern us," said Carrados. "In a game of this kind one has
  to take sides and we have taken ours. It remains for us to see that our side
  wins. You mentioned jealousy, Mr Hollyer. Have you any idea whether Mrs
  Creake has real ground for it?"</p>

  <p>"I should have told you that," replied Lieutenant Hollyer. "I happened to
  strike up with a newspaper man whose office is in the same block as Creake's.
  When I mentioned the name he grinned. 'Creake,' he said, 'oh, he's the man
  with the romantic typist, isn't he?' 'Well, he's my brother-in-law,' I
  replied. 'What about the typist?' Then the chap shut up like a knife. 'No,
  no,' he said, 'I didn't know he was married. I don't want to get mixed up in
  anything of that sort. I only said that he had a typist. Well, what of that?
  So have we; so has everyone.' There was nothing more to be got out of him,
  but the remark and the grin meant&mdash;well, about as usual, Mr
  Carrados."</p>

  <p>Carrados turned to his friend.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you know all about the typist by now, Louis?"</p>

  <p>"We have had her under efficient observation, Max," replied Mr Carlyle,
  with severe dignity.</p>

  <p>"Is she unmarried?"</p>

  <p>"Yes; so far as ordinary repute goes, she is."</p>

  <p>"That is all that is essential for the moment. Mr Hollyer opens up three
  excellent reasons why this man might wish to dispose of his wife. If we
  accept the suggestion of poisoning&mdash;though we have only a jealous
  woman's suspicion for it&mdash;we add to the wish the determination. Well, we
  will go forward on that. Have you got a photograph of Mr Creake?"</p>

  <p>The lieutenant took out his pocket-book.</p>

  <p>"Mr Carlyle asked me for one. Here is the best I could get."</p>

  <p>Carrados rang the bell.</p>

  <p>"This, Parkinson," he said, when the man appeared, "is a photograph of a
  Mr&mdash;&mdash;What first name, by the way?"</p>

  <p>"Austin," put in Hollyer, who was following everything with a boyish
  mixture of excitement and subdued importance.</p>

  <p>"&mdash;of a Mr Austin Creake. I may require you to recognize him."</p>

  <p>Parkinson glanced at the print and returned it to his master's hand.</p>

  <p>"May I inquire if it is a recent photograph of the gentleman, sir?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>"About six years ago," said the lieutenant, taking in this new actor in
  the drama with frank curiosity. "But he is very little changed."</p>

  <p>"Thank you, sir. I will endeavour to remember Mr Creake, sir."</p>

  <p>Lieutenant Hollyer stood up as Parkinson left the room. The interview
  seemed to be at an end.</p>

  <p>"Oh, there's one other matter," he remarked. "I am afraid that I did
  rather an unfortunate thing while I was at Brookbend. It seemed to me that as
  all Millicent's money would probably pass into Creake's hands sooner or later
  I might as well have my five hundred pounds, if only to help her with
  afterwards. So I broached the subject and said that I should like to have it
  now as I had an opportunity for investing."</p>

  <p>"And you think?"</p>

  <p>"It may possibly influence Creake to act sooner than he otherwise might
  have done. He may have got possession of the principal even and find it very
  awkward to replace it."</p>

  <p>"So much the better. If your sister is going to be murdered it may as well
  be done next week as next year so far as I am concerned. Excuse my brutality,
  Mr Hollyer, but this is simply a case to me and I regard it strategically.
  Now Mr Carlyle's organization can look after Mrs Creake for a few weeks but
  it cannot look after her for ever. By increasing the immediate risk we
  diminish the permanent risk."</p>

  <p>"I see," agreed Hollyer. "I'm awfully uneasy but I'm entirely in your
  hands."</p>

  <p>"Then we will give Mr Creake every inducement and every opportunity to get
  to work. Where are you staying now?"</p>

  <p>"Just now with some friends at St Albans."</p>

  <p>"That is too far." The inscrutable eyes retained their tranquil depth but
  a new quality of quickening interest in the voice made Mr Carlyle forget the
  weight and burden of his ruffled dignity. "Give me a few minutes, please. The
  cigarettes are behind you, Mr Hollyer." The blind man walked to the window
  and seemed to look out over the cypress-shaded lawn. The lieutenant lit a
  cigarette and Mr Carlyle picked up <i>Punch</i>. Then Carrados turned round
  again.</p>

  <p>"You are prepared to put your own arrangements aside?" he demanded of his
  visitor.</p>

  <p>"Certainly."</p>

  <p>"Very well. I want you to go down now&mdash;straight from here&mdash;to
  Brookbend Cottage. Tell your sister that your leave is unexpectedly cut short
  and that you sail to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"The <i>Martian</i>?"</p>

  <p>"No, no; the <i>Martian</i> doesn't sail. Look up the movements on your
  way there and pick out a boat that does. Say you are transferred. Add that
  you expect to be away only two or three months and that you really want the
  five hundred pounds by the time of your return. Don't stay in the house long,
  please."</p>

  <p>"I understand, sir."</p>

  <p>"St Albans is too far. Make your excuse and get away from there to-day.
  Put up somewhere in town, where you will be in reach of the telephone. Let Mr
  Carlyle and myself know where you are. Keep out of Creake's way. I don't want
  actually to tie you down to the house, but we may require your services. We
  will let you know at the first sign of anything doing and if there is nothing
  to be done we must release you."</p>

  <p>"I don't mind that. Is there nothing more that I can do now?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing. In going to Mr Carlyle you have done the best thing possible;
  you have put your sister into the care of the shrewdest man in London."
  Whereat the object of this quite unexpected eulogy found himself becoming
  covered with modest confusion.</p>

  <p>"Well, Max?" remarked Mr Carlyle tentatively when they were alone.</p>

  <p>"Well, Louis?"</p>

  <p>"Of course it wasn't worth while rubbing it in before young Hollyer, but,
  as a matter of fact, every single man carries the life of any other
  man&mdash;only one, mind you&mdash;in his hands, do what you will."</p>

  <p>"Provided he doesn't bungle," acquiesced Carrados.</p>

  <p>"Quite so."</p>

  <p>"And also that he is absolutely reckless of the consequences."</p>

  <p>"Of course."</p>

  <p>"Two rather large provisos. Creake is obviously susceptible to both. Have
  you seen him?"</p>

  <p>"No. As I told you, I put a man on to report his habits in town. Then, two
  days ago, as the case seemed to promise some interest&mdash;for he certainly
  is deeply involved with the typist, Max, and the thing might take a
  sensational turn any time&mdash;I went down to Mulling Common myself.
  Although the house is lonely it is on the electric tram route. You know the
  sort of market garden rurality that about a dozen miles out of London
  offers&mdash;alternate bricks and cabbages. It was easy enough to get to know
  about Creake locally. He mixes with no one there, goes into town at irregular
  times but generally every day, and is reputed to be devilish hard to get
  money out of. Finally I made the acquaintance of an old fellow who used to do
  a day's gardening at Brookbend occasionally. He has a cottage and a garden of
  his own with a greenhouse, and the business cost me the price of a pound of
  tomatoes."</p>

  <p>"Was it&mdash;a profitable investment?"</p>

  <p>"As tomatoes, yes; as information, no. The old fellow had the fatal
  disadvantage from our point of view of labouring under a grievance. A few
  weeks ago Creake told him that he would not require him again as he was going
  to do his own gardening in future."</p>

  <p>"That is something, Louis."</p>

  <p>"If only Creake was going to poison his wife with hyoscyamine and bury
  her, instead of blowing her up with a dynamite cartridge and claiming that it
  came in among the coal."</p>

  <p>"True, true. Still&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"However, the chatty old soul had a simple explanation for everything that
  Creake did. Creake was mad. He had even seen him flying a kite in his garden
  where it was bound to get wrecked among the trees. 'A lad of ten would have
  known better,' he declared. And certainly the kite did get wrecked, for I saw
  it hanging over the road myself. But that a sane man should spend his time
  'playing with a toy' was beyond him."</p>

  <p>"A good many men have been flying kites of various kinds lately," said
  Carrados. "Is he interested in aviation?"</p>

  <p>"I dare say. He appears to have some knowledge of scientific subjects. Now
  what do you want me to do, Max?"</p>

  <p>"Will you do it?"</p>

  <p>"Implicitly&mdash;subject to the usual reservations."</p>

  <p>"Keep your man on Creake in town and let me have his reports after you
  have seen them. Lunch with me here now. 'Phone up to your office that you are
  detained on unpleasant business and then give the deserving Parkinson an
  afternoon off by looking after me while we take a motor run round Mulling
  Common. If we have time we might go on to Brighton, feed at the 'Ship,' and
  come back in the cool."</p>

  <p>"Amiable and thrice lucky mortal," sighed Mr Carlyle, his glance wandering
  round the room.</p>

  <p>But, as it happened, Brighton did not figure in that day's itinerary. It
  had been Carrados's intention merely to pass Brookbend Cottage on this
  occasion, relying on his highly developed faculties, aided by Mr Carlyle's
  description, to inform him of the surroundings. A hundred yards before they
  reached the house he had given an order to his chauffeur to drop into the
  lowest speed and they were leisurely drawing past when a discovery by Mr
  Carlyle modified their plans.</p>

  <p>"By Jupiter!" that gentleman suddenly exclaimed, "there's a board up, Max.
  The place is to be let."</p>

  <p>Carrados picked up the tube again. A couple of sentences passed and the
  car stopped by the roadside, a score of paces past the limit of the garden.
  Mr Carlyle took out his notebook and wrote down the address of a firm of
  house agents.</p>

  <p>"You might raise the bonnet and have a look at the engines, Harris," said
  Carrados. "We want to be occupied here for a few minutes."</p>

  <p>"This is sudden; Hollyer knew nothing of their leaving," remarked Mr
  Carlyle.</p>

  <p>"Probably not for three months yet. All the same, Louis, we will go on to
  the agents and get a card to view, whether we use it to-day or not."</p>

  <p>A thick hedge, in its summer dress effectively screening the house beyond
  from public view, lay between the garden and the road. Above the hedge showed
  an occasional shrub; at the corner nearest to the car a chestnut flourished.
  The wooden gate, once white; which they had passed, was grimed and rickety.
  The road itself was still the unpretentious country lane that the advent of
  the electric car had found it. When Carrados had taken in these details there
  seemed little else to notice. He was on the point of giving Harris the order
  to go on when his ear caught a trivial sound.</p>

  <p>"Someone is coming out of the house, Louis," he warned his friend. "It may
  be Hollyer, but he ought to have gone by this time."</p>

  <p>"I don't hear anyone," replied the other, but as he spoke a door banged
  noisily and Mr Carlyle slipped into another seat and ensconced himself behind
  a copy of <i>The Globe</i>.</p>

  <p>"Creake himself," he whispered across the car, as a man appeared at the
  gate. "Hollyer was right; he is hardly changed. Waiting for a car, I
  suppose."</p>

  <p>But a car very soon swung past them from the direction in which Mr Creake
  was looking and it did not interest him. For a minute or two longer he
  continued to look expectantly along the road. Then he walked slowly up the
  drive back to the house.</p>

  <p>"We will give him five or ten minutes," decided Carrados. "Harris is
  behaving very naturally."</p>

  <p>Before even the shorter period had run out they were repaid. A
  telegraph-boy cycled leisurely along the road, and, leaving his machine at
  the gate, went up to the cottage. Evidently there was no reply, for in less
  than a minute he was trundling past them back again. Round the bend an
  approaching tram clanged its bell noisily, and, quickened by the warning
  sound, Mr Creake again appeared, this time with a small portmanteau in his
  hand. With a backward glance he hurried on towards the next stopping-place,
  and, boarding the car as it slackened down, he was carried out of their
  knowledge.</p>

  <p>"Very convenient of Mr Creake," remarked Carrados, with quiet
  satisfaction. "We will now get the order and go over the house in his
  absence. It might be useful to have a look at the wire as well."</p>

  <p>"It might, Max," acquiesced Mr Carlyle a little dryly. "But if it is, as
  it probably is, in Creake's pocket, how do you propose to get it?"</p>

  <p>"By going to the post office, Louis."</p>

  <p>"Quite so. Have you ever tried to see a copy of a telegram addressed to
  someone else?"</p>

  <p>"I don't think I have ever had occasion yet," admitted Carrados. "Have
  you?"</p>

  <p>"In one or two cases I have perhaps been an accessory to the act. It is
  generally a matter either of extreme delicacy or considerable
  expenditure."</p>

  <p>"Then for Hollyer's sake we will hope for the former here." And Mr Carlyle
  smiled darkly and hinted that he was content to wait for a friendly
  revenge.</p>

  <p>A little later, having left the car at the beginning of the straggling
  High Street, the two men called at the village post office. They had already
  visited the house agent and obtained an order to view Brookbend Cottage,
  declining, with some difficulty, the clerk's persistent offer to accompany
  them. The reason was soon forthcoming. "As a matter of fact," explained the
  young man, "the present tenant is under <i>our</i>notice to leave."</p>

  <p>"Unsatisfactory, eh?" said Carrados encouragingly.</p>

  <p>"He's a corker," admitted the clerk, responding to the friendly tone.
  "Fifteen months and not a doit of rent have we had. That's why I should have
  liked&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"We will make every allowance," replied Carrados.</p>

  <p>The post office occupied one side of a stationer's shop. It was not
  without some inward trepidation that Mr Carlyle found himself committed to
  the adventure. Carrados, on the other hand, was the personification of bland
  unconcern.</p>

  <p>"You have just sent a telegram to Brookbend Cottage," he said to the young
  lady behind the brasswork lattice. "We think it may have come inaccurately
  and should like a repeat." He took out his purse. "What is the fee?"</p>

  <p>The request was evidently not a common one. "Oh," said the girl
  uncertainly, "wait a minute, please." She turned to a pile of telegram
  duplicates behind the desk and ran a doubtful finger along the upper sheets.
  "I think this is all right. You want it repeated?"</p>

  <p>"Please." Just a tinge of questioning surprise gave point to the courteous
  tone.</p>

  <p>"It will be fourpence. If there is an error the amount will be
  refunded."</p>

  <p>Carrados put down a coin and received his change.</p>

  <p>"Will it take long?" he inquired carelessly, as he pulled on his
  glove.</p>

  <p>"You will most likely get it within a quarter of an hour," she
  replied.</p>

  <p>"Now you've done it," commented Mr Carlyle, as they walked back to their
  car. "How do you propose to get that telegram, Max?"</p>

  <p>"Ask for it," was the laconic explanation.</p>

  <p>And, stripping the artifice of any elaboration, he simply asked for it and
  got it. The car, posted at a convenient bend in the road, gave him a warning
  note as the telegraph-boy approached. Then Carrados took up a convincing
  attitude with his hand on the gate while Mr Carlyle lent himself to the
  semblance of a departing friend. That was the inevitable impression when the
  boy rode up.</p>

  <p>"Creake, Brookbend Cottage?" inquired Carrados, holding out his hand, and
  without a second thought the boy gave him the envelope and rode away on the
  assurance that there would be no reply.</p>

  <p>"Some day, my friend," remarked Mr Carlyle, looking nervously towards the
  unseen house, "your ingenuity will get you into a tight corner."</p>

  <p>"Then my ingenuity must get me out again," was the retort. "Let us have
  our 'view' now. The telegram can wait."</p>

  <p>An untidy workwoman took their order and left them standing at the door.
  Presently a lady whom they both knew to be Mrs Creake appeared.</p>

  <p>"You wish to see over the house?" she said, in a voice that was utterly
  devoid of any interest. Then, without waiting for a reply, she turned to the
  nearest door and threw it open.</p>

  <p>"This is the drawing-room," she said, standing aside.</p>

  <p>They walked into a sparsely furnished, damp-smelling room and made a
  pretence of looking round, while Mrs Creake remained silent and aloof.</p>

  <p>"The dining-room," she continued, crossing the narrow hall and opening
  another door.</p>

  <p>Mr Carlyle ventured a genial commonplace in the hope of inducing
  conversation. The result was not encouraging. Doubtless they would have gone
  through the house under the same frigid guidance had not Carrados been at
  fault in a way that Mr Carlyle had never known him fail before. In crossing
  the hall he stumbled over a mat and almost fell.</p>

  <p>"Pardon my clumsiness," he said to the lady. "I am, unfortunately, quite
  blind. But," he added, with a smile, to turn off the mishap, "even a blind
  man must have a house."</p>

  <p>The man who had eyes was surprised to see a flood of colour rush into Mrs
  Creake's face.</p>

  <p>"Blind!" she exclaimed, "oh, I beg your pardon. Why did you not tell me?
  You might have fallen."</p>

  <p>"I generally manage fairly well," he replied. "But, of course, in a
  strange house&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She put her hand on his arm very lightly.</p>

  <p>"You must let me guide you, just a little," she said.</p>

  <p>The house, without being large, was full of passages and inconvenient
  turnings. Carrados asked an occasional question and found Mrs Creake quite
  amiable without effusion. Mr Carlyle followed them from room to room in the
  hope, though scarcely the expectation, of learning something that might be
  useful.</p>

  <p>"This is the last one. It is the largest bedroom," said their guide. Only
  two of the upper rooms were fully furnished and Mr Carlyle at once saw, as
  Carrados knew without seeing, that this was the one which the Creakes
  occupied.</p>

  <p>"A very pleasant outlook," declared Mr Carlyle.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I suppose so," admitted the lady vaguely. The room, in fact, looked
  over the leafy garden and the road beyond. It had a French window opening on
  to a small balcony, and to this, under the strange influence that always
  attracted him to light, Carrados walked.</p>

  <p>"I expect that there is a certain amount of repair needed?" he said, after
  standing there a moment.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid there would be," she confessed.</p>

  <p>"I ask because there is a sheet of metal on the floor here," he continued.
  "Now that, in an old house, spells dry rot to the wary observer."</p>

  <p>"My husband said that the rain, which comes in a little under the window,
  was rotting the boards there," she replied. "He put that down recently. I had
  not noticed anything myself."</p>

  <p>It was the first time she had mentioned her husband; Mr Carlyle pricked up
  his ears.</p>

  <p>"Ah, that is a less serious matter," said Carrados. "May I step out on to
  the balcony?"</p>

  <p>"Oh yes, if you like to." Then, as he appeared to be fumbling at the
  catch, "Let me open it for you."</p>

  <p>But the window was already open, and Carrados, facing the various points
  of the compass, took in the bearings.</p>

  <p>"A sunny, sheltered corner," he remarked. "An ideal spot for a deck-chair
  and a book."</p>

  <p>She shrugged her shoulders half contemptuously.</p>

  <p>"I dare say," she replied, "but I never use it."</p>

  <p>"Sometimes, surely," he persisted mildly. "It would be my favourite
  retreat. But then&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I was going to say that I had never even been out on it, but that would
  not be quite true. It has two uses for me, both equally romantic; I
  occasionally shake a duster from it, and when my husband returns late without
  his latchkey he wakes me up and I come out here and drop him mine."</p>

  <p>Further revelation of Mr Creake's nocturnal habits was cut off, greatly to
  Mr Carlyle's annoyance, by a cough of unmistakable significance from the foot
  of the stairs. They had heard a trade cart drive up to the gate, a knock at
  the door, and the heavy-footed woman tramp along the hall.</p>

  <p>"Excuse me a minute, please," said Mrs Creake.</p>

  <p>"Louis," said Carrados, in a sharp whisper, the moment they were alone,
  "stand against the door."</p>

  <p>With extreme plausibility Mr Carlyle began to admire a picture so situated
  that while he was there it was impossible to open the door more than a few
  inches. From that position he observed his confederate go through the curious
  procedure of kneeling down on the bedroom floor and for a full minute
  pressing his ear to the sheet of metal that had already engaged his
  attention. Then he rose to his feet, nodded, dusted his trousers, and Mr
  Carlyle moved to a less equivocal position.</p>

  <p>"What a beautiful rose-tree grows up your balcony," remarked Carrados,
  stepping into the room as Mrs Creake returned. "I suppose you are very fond
  of gardening?"</p>

  <p>"I detest it," she replied.</p>

  <p>"But this <i>Glorie</i>, so carefully trained&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"Is it?" she replied. "I think my husband was nailing it up recently." By
  some strange fatality Carrados's most aimless remarks seemed to involve the
  absent Mr Creake. "Do you care to see the garden?"</p>

  <p>The garden proved to be extensive and neglected. Behind the house was
  chiefly orchard. In front, some semblance of order had been kept up; here it
  was lawn and shrubbery, and the drive they had walked along. Two things
  interested Carrados: the soil at the foot of the balcony, which he declared
  on examination to be particularly suitable for roses, and the fine
  chestnut-tree in the corner by the road.</p>

  <p>As they walked back to the car Mr Carlyle lamented that they had learned
  so little of Creake's movements.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps the telegram will tell us something," suggested Carrados. "Read
  it, Louis."</p>

  <p>Mr Carlyle cut open the envelope, glanced at the enclosure, and in spite
  of his disappointment could not restrain a chuckle.</p>

  <p>"My poor Max," he explained, "you have put yourself to an amount of
  ingenious trouble for nothing. Creake is evidently taking a few days' holiday
  and prudently availed himself of the Meteorological Office forecast before
  going. Listen: '<i>Immediate prospect for London warm and settled. Further
  outlook cooler but fine.</i>' Well, well; I did get a pound of tomatoes for
  <i>my</i> fourpence."</p>

  <p>"You certainly scored there, Louis," admitted Carrados, with humorous
  appreciation. "I wonder," he added speculatively, "whether it is Creake's
  peculiar taste usually to spend his week-end holiday in London."</p>

  <p>"Eh?" exclaimed Mr Carlyle, looking at the words again, "by gad, that's
  rum, Max. They go to Weston-super-Mare. Why on earth should he want to know
  about London?"</p>

  <p>"I can make a guess, but before we are satisfied I must come here again.
  Take another look at that kite, Louis. Are there a few yards of string
  hanging loose from it?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, there are."</p>

  <p>"Rather thick string&mdash;unusually thick for the purpose?"</p>

  <p>"Yes; but how do you know?"</p>

  <p>As they drove home again Carrados explained, and Mr Carlyle sat aghast,
  saying incredulously: "Good God, Max, is it possible?"</p>

  <p>An hour later he was satisfied that it was possible. In reply to his
  inquiry someone in his office telephoned him the information that "they" had
  left Paddington by the four-thirty for Weston.</p>

  <p>It was more than a week after his introduction to Carrados that Lieutenant
  Hollyer had a summons to present himself at The Turrets again. He found Mr
  Carlyle already there and the two friends awaiting his arrival.</p>

  <p>"I stayed in all day after hearing from you this morning, Mr Carrados," he
  said, shaking hands. "When I got your second message I was all ready to walk
  straight out of the house. That's how I did it in the time. I hope everything
  is all right?"</p>

  <p>"Excellent," replied Carrados. "You'd better have something before we
  start. We probably have a long and perhaps an exciting night before us."</p>

  <p>"And certainly a wet one," assented the lieutenant. "It was thundering
  over Mulling way as I came along."</p>

  <p>"That is why you are here," said his host. "We are waiting for a certain
  message before we start, and in the meantime you may as well understand what
  we expect to happen. As you saw, there is a thunderstorm coming on. The
  Meteorological Office morning forecast predicted it for the whole of London
  if the conditions remained. That was why I kept you in readiness. Within an
  hour it is now inevitable that we shall experience a deluge. Here and there
  damage will be done to trees and buildings; here and there a person will
  probably be struck and killed."</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"It is Mr Creake's intention that his wife should be among the
  victims."</p>

  <p>"I don't exactly follow," said Hollyer, looking from one man to the other.
  "I quite admit that Creake would be immensely relieved if such a thing did
  happen, but the chance is surely an absurdly remote one."</p>

  <p>"Yet unless we intervene it is precisely what a coroner's jury will decide
  has happened. Do you know whether your brother-in-law has any practical
  knowledge of electricity, Mr Hollyer?"</p>

  <p>"I cannot say. He was so reserved, and we really knew so little of
  him&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yet in 1896 an Austin Creake contributed an article on 'Alternating
  Currents' to the American <i>Scientific World</i>. That would argue a fairly
  intimate acquaintanceship."</p>

  <p>"But do you mean that he is going to direct a flash of lightning?"</p>

  <p>"Only into the minds of the doctor who conducts the post-mortem, and the
  coroner. This storm, the opportunity for which he has been waiting for weeks,
  is merely the cloak to his act. The weapon which he has planned to
  use&mdash;scarcely less powerful than lightning but much more
  tractable&mdash;is the high voltage current of electricity that flows along
  the tram wire at his gate."</p>

  <p>"Oh!" exclaimed Lieutenant Hollyer, as the sudden revelation struck
  him.</p>

  <p>"Some time between eleven o'clock to-night&mdash;about the hour when your
  sister goes to bed&mdash;and one-thirty in the morning&mdash;the time up to
  which he can rely on the current&mdash;Creake will throw a stone up at the
  balcony window. Most of his preparation has long been made; it only remains
  for him to connect up a short length to the window handle and a longer one at
  the other end to tap the live wire. That done, he will wake his wife in the
  way I have said. The moment she moves the catch of the window&mdash;and he
  has carefully filed its parts to ensure perfect contact&mdash;she will be
  electrocuted as effectually as if she sat in the executioner's chair in Sing
  Sing prison."</p>

  <p>"But what are we doing here!" exclaimed Hollyer, starting to his feet,
  pale and horrified. "It is past ten now and anything may happen."</p>

  <p>"Quite natural, Mr Hollyer," said Carrados reassuringly, "but you need
  have no anxiety. Creake is being watched, the house is being watched, and
  your sister is as safe as if she slept to-night in Windsor Castle. Be assured
  that whatever happens he will not be allowed to complete his scheme; but it
  is desirable to let him implicate himself to the fullest limit. Your
  brother-in-law, Mr Hollyer, is a man with a peculiar capacity for taking
  pains."</p>

  <p>"He is a damned cold-blooded scoundrel!" exclaimed the young officer
  fiercely. "When I think of Millicent five years ago&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well, for that matter, an enlightened nation has decided that
  electrocution is the most humane way of removing its superfluous citizens,"
  suggested Carrados mildly. "He is certainly an ingenious-minded gentleman. It
  is his misfortune that in Mr Carlyle he was fated to be opposed by an even
  subtler brain&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No, no! Really, Max!" protested the embarrassed gentleman.</p>

  <p>"Mr Hollyer will be able to judge for himself when I tell him that it was
  Mr Carlyle who first drew attention to the significance of the abandoned
  kite," insisted Carrados firmly. "Then, of course, its object became plain to
  me&mdash;as indeed to anyone. For ten minutes, perhaps, a wire must be
  carried from the overhead line to the chestnut-tree. Creake has everything in
  his favour, but it is just within possibility that the driver of an
  inopportune tram might notice the appendage. What of that? Why, for more than
  a week he has seen a derelict kite with its yards of trailing string hanging
  in the tree. A very calculating mind, Mr Hollyer. It would be interesting to
  know what line of action Mr Creake has mapped out for himself afterwards. I
  expect he has half-a-dozen artistic little touches up his sleeve. Possibly he
  would merely singe his wife's hair, burn her feet with a red-hot poker,
  shiver the glass of the French window, and be content with that to let well
  alone. You see, lightning is so varied in its effects that whatever he did or
  did not do would be right. He is in the impregnable position of the body
  showing all the symptoms of death by lightning shock and nothing else but
  lightning to account for it&mdash;a dilated eye, heart contracted in systole,
  bloodless lungs shrunk to a third the normal weight, and all the rest of it.
  When he has removed a few outward traces of his work Creake might quite
  safely 'discover' his dead wife and rush off for the nearest doctor. Or he
  may have decided to arrange a convincing alibi, and creep away, leaving the
  discovery to another. We shall never know; he will make no confession."</p>

  <p>"I wish it was well over," admitted Hollyer. "I'm not particularly jumpy,
  but this gives me a touch of the creeps."</p>

  <p>"Three more hours at the worst, Lieutenant," said Carrados cheerfully.
  "Ah-ha, something is coming through now."</p>

  <p>He went to the telephone and received a message from one quarter; then
  made another connection and talked for a few minutes with someone else.</p>

  <p>"Everything working smoothly," he remarked between times over his
  shoulder. "Your sister has gone to bed, Mr Hollyer."</p>

  <p>Then he turned to the house telephone and distributed his orders.</p>

  <p>"So we," he concluded, "must get up."</p>

  <p>By the time they were ready a large closed motor car was waiting. The
  lieutenant thought he recognized Parkinson in the well-swathed form beside
  the driver, but there was no temptation to linger for a second on the steps.
  Already the stinging rain had lashed the drive into the semblance of a frothy
  estuary; all round the lightning jagged its course through the incessant
  tremulous glow of more distant lightning, while the thunder only ceased its
  muttering to turn at close quarters and crackle viciously.</p>

  <p>"One of the few things I regret missing," remarked Carrados tranquilly;
  "but I hear a good deal of colour in it."</p>

  <p>The car slushed its way down to the gate, lurched a little heavily across
  the dip into the road, and, steadying as it came upon the straight, began to
  hum contentedly along the deserted highway.</p>

  <p>"We are not going direct?" suddenly inquired Hollyer, after they had
  travelled perhaps half-a-dozen miles. The night was bewildering enough but he
  had the sailor's gift for location.</p>

  <p>"No; through Hunscott Green and then by a field-path to the orchard at the
  back," replied Carrados. "Keep a sharp look out for the man with the lantern
  about here, Harris," he called through the tube.</p>

  <p>"Something flashing just ahead, sir," came the reply, and the car slowed
  down and stopped.</p>

  <p>Carrados dropped the near window as a man in glistening waterproof stepped
  from the shelter of a lich-gate and approached.</p>

  <p>"Inspector Beedel, sir," said the stranger, looking into the car.</p>

  <p>"Quite right, Inspector," said Carrados. "Get in."</p>

  <p>"I have a man with me, sir."</p>

  <p>"We can find room for him as well."</p>

  <p>"We are very wet."</p>

  <p>"So shall we all be soon."</p>

  <p>The lieutenant changed his seat and the two burly forms took places side
  by side. In less than five minutes the car stopped again, this time in a
  grassy country lane.</p>

  <p>"Now we have to face it," announced Carrados. "The inspector will show us
  the way."</p>

  <p>The car slid round and disappeared into the night, while Beedel led the
  party to a stile in the hedge. A couple of fields brought them to the
  Brookbend boundary. There a figure stood out of the black foliage, exchanged
  a few words with their guide and piloted them along the shadows of the
  orchard to the back door of the house.</p>

  <p>"You will find a broken pane near the catch of the scullery window," said
  the blind man.</p>

  <p>"Right, sir," replied the inspector. "I have it. Now who goes
  through?"</p>

  <p>"Mr Hollyer will open the door for us. I'm afraid you must take off your
  boots and all wet things, Lieutenant. We cannot risk a single spot
  inside."</p>

  <p>They waited until the back door opened, then each one divested himself in
  a similar manner and passed into the kitchen, where the remains of a fire
  still burned. The man from the orchard gathered together the discarded
  garments and disappeared again.</p>

  <p>Carrados turned to the lieutenant.</p>

  <p>"A rather delicate job for you now, Mr Hollyer. I want you to go up to
  your sister, wake her, and get her into another room with as little fuss as
  possible. Tell her as much as you think fit and let her understand that her
  very life depends on absolute stillness when she is alone. Don't be unduly
  hurried, but not a glimmer of a light, please."</p>

  <p>Ten minutes passed by the measure of the battered old alarum on the
  dresser shelf before the young man returned.</p>

  <p>"I've had rather a time of it," he reported, with a nervous laugh, "but I
  think it will be all right now. She is in the spare room."</p>

  <p>"Then we will take our places. You and Parkinson come with me to the
  bedroom. Inspector, you have your own arrangements. Mr Carlyle will be with
  you."</p>

  <p>They dispersed silently about the house. Hollyer glanced apprehensively at
  the door of the spare room as they passed it but within was as quiet as the
  grave. Their room lay at the other end of the passage.</p>

  <p>"You may as well take your place in the bed now, Hollyer," directed
  Carrados when they were inside and the door closed. "Keep well down among the
  clothes. Creake has to get up on the balcony, you know, and he will probably
  peep through the window, but he dare come no farther. Then when he begins to
  throw up stones slip on this dressing-gown of your sister's. I'll tell you
  what to do after."</p>

  <p>The next sixty minutes drew out into the longest hour that the lieutenant
  had ever known. Occasionally he heard a whisper pass between the two men who
  stood behind the window curtains, but he could see nothing. Then Carrados
  threw a guarded remark in his direction.</p>

  <p>"He is in the garden now."</p>

  <p>Something scraped slightly against the outer wall. But the night was full
  of wilder sounds, and in the house the furniture and the boards creaked and
  sprung between the yawling of the wind among the chimneys, the rattle of the
  thunder and the pelting of the rain. It was a time to quicken the steadiest
  pulse, and when the crucial moment came, when a pebble suddenly rang against
  the pane with a sound that the tense waiting magnified into a shivering
  crash, Hollyer leapt from the bed on the instant.</p>

  <p>"Easy, easy," warned Carrados feelingly. "We will wait for another knock."
  He passed something across. "Here is a rubber glove. I have cut the wire but
  you had better put it on. Stand just for a moment at the window, move the
  catch so that it can blow open a little, and drop immediately. Now."</p>

  <p>Another stone had rattled against the glass. For Hollyer to go through his
  part was the work merely of seconds, and with a few touches Carrados spread
  the dressing-gown to more effective disguise about the extended form. But an
  unforeseen and in the circumstances rather horrible interval followed, for
  Creake, in accordance with some detail of his never-revealed plan, continued
  to shower missile after missile against the panes until even the
  unimpressionable Parkinson shivered.</p>

  <p>"The last act," whispered Carrados, a moment after the throwing had
  ceased. "He has gone round to the back. Keep as you are. We take cover now."
  He pressed behind the arras of an extemporized wardrobe, and the spirit of
  emptiness and desolation seemed once more to reign over the lonely house.</p>

  <p>From half-a-dozen places of concealment ears were straining to catch the
  first guiding sound. He moved very stealthily, burdened, perhaps, by some
  strange scruple in the presence of the tragedy that he had not feared to
  contrive, paused for a moment at the bedroom door, then opened it very
  quietly, and in the fickle light read the consummation of his hopes.</p>

  <p>"At last!" they heard the sharp whisper drawn from his relief. "At
  last!"</p>

  <p>He took another step and two shadows seemed to fall upon him from behind,
  one on either side. With primitive instinct a cry of terror and surprise
  escaped him as he made a desperate movement to wrench himself free, and for a
  short second he almost succeeded in dragging one hand into a pocket. Then his
  wrists slowly came together and the handcuffs closed.</p>

  <p>"I am Inspector Beedel," said the man on his right side. "You are charged
  with the attempted murder of your wife, Millicent Creake."</p>

  <p>"You are mad," retorted the miserable creature, falling into a desperate
  calmness. "She has been struck by lightning."</p>

  <p>"No, you blackguard, she hasn't," wrathfully exclaimed his brother-in-law,
  jumping up. "Would you like to see her?"</p>

  <p>"I also have to warn you," continued the inspector impassively, "that
  anything you say may be used as evidence against you."</p>

  <p>A startled cry from the farther end of the passage arrested their
  attention.</p>

  <p>"Mr Carrados," called Hollyer, "oh, come at once."</p>

  <p>At the open door of the other bedroom stood the lieutenant, his eyes still
  turned towards something in the room beyond, a little empty bottle in his
  hand.</p>

  <p>"Dead!" he exclaimed tragically, with a sob, "with this beside her. Dead
  just when she would have been free of the brute."</p>

  <p>The blind man passed into the room, sniffed the air, and laid a gentle
  hand on the pulseless heart.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he replied. "That, Hollyer, does not always appeal to the woman,
  strange to say."</p>

     name="story4"></a>IV. &mdash; THE CLEVER MRS. STRAITHWAITE</h2>

  <h3>Serialised in <i>The News Of The World</i>, Sep 21-28, 1913</h3>

  <p class="first">Mr Carlyle had arrived at The Turrets in the very best
  possible spirits. Everything about him, from his immaculate white spats to
  the choice gardenia in his buttonhole, from the brisk decision with which he
  took the front-door steps to the bustling importance with which he had
  positively brushed Parkinson aside at the door of the library, proclaimed
  consequence and the extremely good terms on which he stood with himself.</p>

  <p>"Prepare yourself, Max," he exclaimed. "If I hinted at a case of
  exceptional delicacy that will certainly interest you by its romantic
  possibilities&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"I should have the liveliest misgivings. Ten to one it would be a jewel
  mystery," hazarded Carrados, as his friend paused with the point of his
  communication withheld, after the manner of a quizzical youngster with a
  promised bon-bon held behind his back. "If you made any more of it I should
  reluctantly be forced to the conclusion that the case involved a society
  scandal connected with a priceless pearl necklace."</p>

  <p>Mr Carlyle's face fell.</p>

  <p>"Then it <i>is</i> in the papers, after all?" he said, with an air of
  disappointment.</p>

  <p>"What is in the papers, Louis?"</p>

  <p>"Some hint of the fraudulent insurance of the Hon. Mrs Straithwaite's
  pearl necklace," replied Carlyle.</p>

  <p>"Possibly," admitted Carrados. "But so far I have not come across it."</p>

  <p>Mr Carlyle stared at his friend, and marching up to the table brought his
  hand down on it with an arresting slap.</p>

  <p>"Then what in the name of goodness are you talking about, may I ask?" he
  demanded caustically. "If you know nothing of the Straithwaite affair, Max,
  what other pearl necklace case are you referring to?"</p>

  <p>Carrados assumed the air of mild deprecation with which he frequently
  apologized for a blind man venturing to make a discovery.</p>

  <p>"A philosopher once made the remark&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Had it anything to do with Mrs Straithwaite's&mdash;the Hon. Mrs
  Straithwaite's&mdash;pearl necklace? And let me warn you, Max, that I have
  read a good deal both of Mill and Spencer at odd times."</p>

  <p>"It was neither Mill nor Spencer. He had a German name, so I will not
  mention it. He made the observation, which, of course, we recognize as an
  obvious commonplace when once it has been expressed, that in order to have an
  accurate knowledge of what a man will do on any occasion it is only necessary
  to study a single characteristic action of his."</p>

  <p>"Utterly impracticable," declared Mr Carlyle.</p>

  <p>"I therefore knew that when you spoke of a case of exceptional interest to
  <i>me</i>, what you really meant, Louis, was a case of exceptional interest
  to <i>you</i>."</p>

  <p>Mr Carlyle's sudden thoughtful silence seemed to admit that possibly there
  might be something in the point.</p>

  <p>"By applying, almost unconsciously, the same useful rule, I became aware
  that a mystery connected with a valuable pearl necklace and a beautiful young
  society belle would appeal the most strongly to your romantic
  imagination."</p>

  <p>"Romantic! I, romantic? Thirty-five and a private inquiry agent! You
  are&mdash;positively feverish, Max."</p>

  <p>"Incurably romantic&mdash;or you would have got over it by now: the worst
  kind."</p>

  <p>"Max, this may prove a most important and interesting case. Will you be
  serious and discuss it?"</p>

  <p>"Jewel cases are rarely either important or interesting. Pearl necklace
  mysteries, in nine cases out of ten, spring from the miasma of social
  pretence and vapid competition and only concern people who do not matter in
  the least. The only attractive thing about them is the name. They are so
  barren of originality that a criminological Linnus could classify them with
  absolute nicety. I'll tell you what, we'll draw up a set of tables giving the
  solution to every possible pearl necklace case for the next twenty-one
  years."</p>

  <p>"We will do any mortal thing you like, Max, if you will allow Parkinson to
  administer a bromo-seltzer and then enable me to meet the officials of the
  Direct Insurance without a blush."</p>

  <p>For three minutes Carrados picked his unerring way among the furniture as
  he paced the room silently but with irresolution in his face. Twice his hand
  went to a paper-covered book lying on his desk, and twice he left it
  untouched.</p>

  <p>"Have you ever been in the lion-house at feeding-time, Louis?" he demanded
  abruptly.</p>

  <p>"In the very remote past, possibly," admitted Mr Carlyle guardedly.</p>

  <p>"As the hour approaches it is impossible to interest the creatures with
  any other suggestion than that of raw meat. You came a day too late, Louis."
  He picked up the book and skimmed it adroitly into Mr Carlyle's hands. "I
  have already scented the gore, and tasted in imagination the joy of tearing
  choice morsels from other similarly obsessed animals."</p>

  <p>"'Catalogue des monnaies grecques et romaines,'" read the gentleman. "'To
  be sold by auction at the Hotel Drouet, Paris, salle 8, April the 24th, 25th,
  etc.' H'm." He turned to the plates of photogravure illustration which gave
  an air to the volume. "This is an event, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"It is the sort of dispersal we get about once in three years," replied
  Carrados. "I seldom attend the little sales, but I save up and then have a
  week's orgy."</p>

  <p>"And when do you go?"</p>

  <p>"To-day. By the afternoon boat&mdash;Folkestone. I have already taken
  rooms at Mascot's. I'm sorry it has fallen so inopportunely, Louis."</p>

  <p>Mr Carlyle rose to the occasion with a display of extremely gentlemanly
  feeling&mdash;which had the added merit of being quite genuine.</p>

  <p>"My dear chap, your regrets only serve to remind me how much I owe to you
  already. <i>Bon voyage</i>, and the most desirable of Eu&mdash;Eu&mdash;well,
  perhaps it would be safer to say, of Kimons, for your collection."</p>

  <p>"I suppose," pondered Carrados, "this insurance business might have led to
  other profitable connexions?"</p>

  <p>"That is quite true," admitted his friend. "I have been trying for some
  time&mdash;but do not think any more of it, Max."</p>

  <p>"What time is it?" demanded Carrados suddenly.</p>

  <p>"Eleven-twenty-five."</p>

  <p>"Good. Has any officious idiot had anyone arrested?"</p>

  <p>"No, it is only&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Never mind. Do you know much of the case?"</p>

  <p>"Practically nothing as yet, unfortunately. I came&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Excellent. Everything is on our side. Louis, I won't go this
  afternoon&mdash;I will put off till the night boat from Dover. That will give
  us nine hours."</p>

  <p>"Nine hours?" repeated the mystified Carlyle, scarcely daring to put into
  thought the scandalous inference that Carrados's words conveyed.</p>

  <p>"Nine full hours. A pearl necklace case that cannot at least be left
  straight after nine hours' work will require a column to itself in our chart.
  Now, Louis, where does this Direct Insurance live?"</p>

  <p>Carlyle had allowed his blind friend to persuade him into&mdash;as they
  had seemed at the beginning&mdash;many mad enterprises. But none had ever, in
  the light of his own experience, seemed so foredoomed to failure as when, at
  eleven-thirty, Carrados ordered his luggage to be on the platform of Charing
  Cross Station at eight-fifty and then turned light-heartedly to the task of
  elucidating the mystery of Mrs Straithwaite's pearl necklace in the
  interval.</p>

  <p>The head office of the Direct and Intermediate Insurance Company proved to
  be in Victoria Street. Thanks to Carrados's speediest car, they entered the
  building as the clocks of Westminster were striking twelve, but for the next
  twenty minutes they were consigned to the general office while Mr Carlyle
  fumed and displayed his watch ostentatiously. At last a clerk slid off his
  stool by the speaking-tube and approached them.</p>

  <p>"Mr Carlyle?" he said. "The General Manager will see you now, but as he
  has another appointment in ten minutes he will be glad if you will make your
  business as short as possible. This way, please."</p>

  <p>Mr Carlyle bit his lip at the pompous formality of the message but he was
  too experienced to waste any words about it and with a mere nod he followed,
  guiding his friend until they reached the Manager's room. But, though
  subservient to circumstance, he was far from being negligible when he wished
  to create an impression.</p>

  <p>"Mr Carrados has been good enough to give us a consultation over this
  small affair," he said, with just the necessary touches of deference and
  condescension that it was impossible either to miss or to resent.
  "Unfortunately he can do little more as he has to leave almost at once to
  direct an important case in Paris."</p>

  <p>The General Manager conveyed little, either in his person or his manner,
  of the brisk precision that his message seemed to promise. The name of
  Carrados struck him as being somewhat familiar&mdash;something a little
  removed from the routine of his business and a matter therefore that he could
  unbend over. He continued to stand comfortably before his office fire, making
  up by a tolerant benignity of his hard and bulbous eye for the physical
  deprivation that his attitude entailed on his visitors.</p>

  <p>"Paris, egad?" he grunted. "Something in your line that France can take
  from us since the days of&mdash;what's-his-name&mdash;Vidocq, eh? Clever
  fellow, that, what? Wasn't it about him and the Purloined Letter?"</p>

  <p>Carrados smiled discreetly.</p>

  <p>"Capital, wasn't it?" he replied. "But there is something else that Paris
  can learn from London, more in your way, sir. Often when I drop in to see the
  principal of one of their chief houses or the head of a Government
  department, we fall into an entertaining discussion of this or that subject
  that may be on the tapis. 'Ah, monsieur,' I say, after perhaps half-an-hour's
  conversation, 'it is very amiable of you and sometimes I regret our insular
  methods, but it is not thus that great businesses are formed. At home, if I
  call upon one of our princes of industry&mdash;a railway director, a
  merchant, or the head of one of our leading insurance companies&mdash;nothing
  will tempt him for a moment from the stern outline of the business in hand.
  You are too complaisant; the merest gossip takes advantage of you.'"</p>

  <p>"That's quite true," admitted the General Manager, occupying the revolving
  chair at his desk and assuming a serious and very determined expression.
  "Slackers, I call them. Now, Mr Carlyle, where are we in this business?"</p>

  <p>"I have your letter of yesterday. We should naturally like all the
  particulars you can give us."</p>

  <p>The Manager threw open a formidable-looking volume with an immense display
  of energy, sharply flattened some typewritten pages that had ventured to
  raise their heads, and lifted an impressive finger.</p>

  <p>"We start here, the 27th of January. On that day Karsfeld, the Princess
  Street jeweller, y'know, who acted as our jewellery assessor, forwards a
  proposal of the Hon. Mrs Straithwaite to insure a pearl necklace against
  theft. Says that he has had an opportunity of examining it and passes it at
  five thousand pounds. That business goes through in the ordinary way; the
  premium is paid and the policy taken out.</p>

  <p>"A couple of months later Karsfeld has a little unpleasantness with us and
  resigns. Resignation accepted. We have nothing against him, you understand.
  At the same time there is an impression among the directors that he has been
  perhaps a little too easy in his ways, a little too&mdash;let us say,
  expansive, in some of his valuations and too accommodating to his own clients
  in recommending to us business of a&mdash;well&mdash;speculative basis;
  business that we do not care about and which we now feel is foreign to our
  traditions as a firm. However"&mdash;the General Manager threw apart his
  stubby hands as though he would shatter any fabric of criminal intention that
  he might be supposed to be insidiously constructing&mdash;"that is the extent
  of our animadversion against Karsfeld. There are no irregularities and you
  may take it from me that the man is all right."</p>

  <p>"You would propose accepting the fact that a five-thousand-pound necklace
  was submitted to him?" suggested Mr Carlyle.</p>

  <p>"I should," acquiesced the Manager, with a weighty nod. "Still&mdash;this
  brings us to April the third&mdash;this break, so to speak, occurring in our
  routine, it seemed a good opportunity for us to assure ourselves on one or
  two points. Mr Bellitzer&mdash;you know Bellitzer, of course; know
  <i>of</i>him, I should say&mdash;was appointed <i>vice</i> Karsfeld and we
  wrote to certain of our clients, asking them&mdash;as our policies entitled
  us to do&mdash;as a matter of form to allow Mr Bellitzer to confirm the
  assessment of his predecessor. Wrapped it up in silver paper, of course; said
  it would certify the present value and be a guarantee that would save them
  some formalities in case of ensuing claim, and so on. Among others, wrote to
  the Hon. Mrs Straithwaite to that effect&mdash;April fourth. Here is her
  reply of three days later. Sorry to disappoint us, but the necklace has just
  been sent to her bank for custody as she is on the point of leaving town.
  Also scarcely sees that it is necessary in her case as the insurance was only
  taken so recently."</p>

  <p>"That is dated April the seventh?" inquired Mr Carlyle, busy with pencil
  and pocket-book.</p>

  <p>"April seventh," repeated the Manager, noting this conscientiousness with
  an approving glance and then turning to regard questioningly the indifferent
  attitude of his other visitor. "That put us on our guard&mdash;naturally.
  Wrote by return regretting the necessity and suggesting that a line to her
  bankers, authorizing them to show us the necklace, would meet the case and
  save her any personal trouble. Interval of a week. Her reply, April
  sixteenth. Thursday last. Circumstances have altered her plans and she has
  returned to London sooner than she expected. Her jewel-case has been returned
  from the bank, and will we send our man round&mdash;'our man,' Mr
  Carlyle!&mdash;on Saturday morning not later than twelve, please."</p>

  <p>The Manager closed the record book, with a sweep of his hand cleared his
  desk for revelations, and leaning forward in his chair fixed Mr Carlyle with
  a pragmatic eye.</p>

  <p>"On Saturday Mr Bellitzer goes to Luneburg Mansions and the Hon. Mrs
  Straithwaite shows him the necklace. He examines it carefully, assesses its
  insurable value up to five thousand, two hundred and fifty pounds, and
  reports us to that effect. But he reports something else, Mr Carlyle. It is
  not the necklace that the lady had insured."</p>

  <p>"Not the necklace?" echoed Mr Carlyle.</p>

  <p>"No. In spite of the number of pearls and a general similarity there are
  certain technical differences, well known to experts, that made the fact
  indisputable. The Hon. Mrs Straithwaite has been guilty of misrepresentation.
  Possibly she has no fraudulent intention. We are willing to pay to find out.
  That's your business."</p>

  <p>Mr Carlyle made a final note and put away his book with an air of decision
  that could not fail to inspire confidence.</p>

  <p>"To-morrow," he said, "we shall perhaps be able to report something."</p>

  <p>"Hope so," vouchsafed the Manager. "'Morning."</p>

  <p>From his position near the window, Carrados appeared to wake up to the
  fact that the interview was over.</p>

  <p>"But so far," he remarked blandly, with his eyes towards the great man in
  the chair, "you have told us nothing of the theft."</p>

  <p>The Manager regarded the speaker dumbly for a moment and then turned to Mr
  Carlyle.</p>

  <p>"What does he mean?" he demanded pungently.</p>

  <p>But for once Mr Carlyle's self-possession had forsaken him. He recognized
  that somehow Carrados had been guilty of an appalling lapse, by which his
  reputation for prescience was wrecked in that quarter for ever, and at the
  catastrophe his very ears began to exude embarrassment.</p>

  <p>In the awkward silence Carrados himself seemed to recognize that something
  was amiss.</p>

  <p>"We appear to be at cross-purposes," he observed. "I inferred that the
  disappearance of the necklace would be the essence of our investigation."</p>

  <p>"Have I said a word about it disappearing?" demanded the Manager, with a
  contempt-laden raucity that he made no pretence of softening. "You don't seem
  to have grasped the simple facts about the case, Mr Carrados. Really, I
  hardly think&mdash;&mdash;Oh, come in!"</p>

  <p>There had been a knock at the door, then another. A clerk now entered with
  an open telegram.</p>

  <p>"Mr Longworth wished you to see this at once, sir."</p>

  <p>"We may as well go," whispered Mr Carlyle with polite depression to his
  colleague.</p>

  <p>"Here, wait a minute," said the Manager, who had been biting his
  thumb-nail over the telegram. "No, not you"&mdash;to the lingering
  clerk&mdash;"you clear." Much of the embarrassment that had troubled Mr
  Carlyle a minute before seemed to have got into the Manager's system. "I
  don't understand this," he confessed awkwardly. "It's from Bellitzer. He
  wires: '<i>Have just heard alleged robbery Straithwaite pearls. Advise
  strictest investigation.</i>'"</p>

  <p>Mr Carlyle suddenly found it necessary to turn to the wall and consult a
  highly coloured lithographic inducement to insure. Mr Carrados alone remained
  to meet the Manager's constrained glance.</p>

  <p>"Still, <i>he</i> tells us really nothing about the theft," he remarked
  sociably.</p>

  <p>"No," admitted the Manager, experiencing some little difficulty with his
  breathing, "he does not."</p>

  <p>"Well, we still hope to be able to report something to-morrow.
  Good-bye."</p>

  <p>It was with an effort that Mr Carlyle straightened himself sufficiently to
  take leave of the Manager. Several times in the corridor he stopped to wipe
  his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Max, you unholy fraud," he said, when they were outside, "you knew all
  the time."</p>

  <p>"No; I told you that I knew nothing of it," replied Carrados frankly. "I
  am absolutely sincere."</p>

  <p>"Then all I can say is, that I see a good many things happen that I don't
  believe in."</p>

  <p>Carrados's reply was to hold out a coin to a passing newsboy and to hand
  the purchase to his friend who was already in the car.</p>

  <p>"There is a slang injunction to 'keep your eyes skinned.' That being out
  of my power, I habitually 'keep my ears skinned.' You would be surprised to
  know how very little you hear, Louis, and how much you miss. In the last five
  minutes up there I have had three different newsboys' account of this
  development."</p>

  <p>"By Jupiter, she hasn't waited long!" exclaimed Mr Carlyle, referring
  eagerly to the headlines. "'<span class="smcap">Pearl Necklace Sensation.
  Society Lady's 5000 Trinket Disappears</span>.' Things are moving. Where
  next, Max?"</p>

  <p>"It is now a quarter to one," replied Carrados, touching the fingers of
  his watch. "We may as well lunch on the strength of this new turn. Parkinson
  will have finished packing; I can telephone him to come to us at Merrick's in
  case I require him. Buy all the papers, Louis, and we will collate the
  points."</p>

  <p>The undoubted facts that survived a comparison were few and meagre, for in
  each case a conscientious journalist had touched up a few vague or doubtful
  details according to his own ideas of probability. All agreed that on Tuesday
  evening&mdash;it was now Thursday&mdash;Mrs Straithwaite had formed one of a
  party that had occupied a box at the new Metropolitan Opera House to witness
  the performance of <i>La Pucella</i>, and that she had been robbed of a set
  of pearls valued in round figures at five thousand pounds. There agreement
  ended. One version represented the theft as taking place at the theatre.
  Another asserted that at the last moment the lady had decided not to wear the
  necklace that evening and that its abstraction had been cleverly effected
  from the flat during her absence. Into a third account came an ambiguous
  reference to Markhams, the well-known jewellers, and a conjecture that their
  loss would certainly be covered by insurance.</p>

  <p>Mr Carlyle, who had been picking out the salient points of the narratives,
  threw down the last paper with an impatient shrug.</p>

  <p>"Why in heaven's name have we Markhams coming into it now?" he demanded.
  "What have they to lose by it, Max? What do you make of the thing?"</p>

  <p>"There is the second genuine string&mdash;the one Bellitzer saw. That
  belongs to someone."</p>

  <p>"By gad, that's true&mdash;only five days ago, too. But what does our lady
  stand to make by that being stolen?"</p>

  <p>Carrados was staring into obscurity between an occasional moment of
  attention to his cigarette or coffee.</p>

  <p>"By this time the lady probably stands to wish she was well out of it," he
  replied thoughtfully. "Once you have set this sort of stone rolling and it
  has got beyond you&mdash;&mdash;" He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"It has become more intricate than you expected?" suggested Carlyle, in
  order to afford his friend an opportunity of withdrawing.</p>

  <p>Carrados pierced the intention and smiled affectionately.</p>

  <p>"My dear Louis," he said, "one-fifth of the mystery is already
  solved."</p>

  <p>"One-fifth? How do you arrive at that?"</p>

  <p>"Because it is one-twenty-five and we started at eleven-thirty."</p>

  <p>He nodded to their waiter, who was standing three tables away, and paid
  the bill. Then with perfect gravity he permitted Mr Carlyle to lead him by
  the arm into the street, where their car was waiting, Parkinson already there
  in attendance.</p>

  <p>"Sure I can be of no further use?" asked Carlyle. Carrados had previously
  indicated that after lunch he would go on alone, but, because he was largely
  sceptical of the outcome, the professional man felt guiltily that he was
  deserting. "Say the word?"</p>

  <p>Carrados smiled and shook his head. Then he leaned across.</p>

  <p>"I am going to the opera house now; then, possibly, to talk to Markham a
  little. If I have time I must find a man who knows the Straithwaites, and
  after that I may look up Inspector Beedel if he is at the Yard. That is as
  far as I can see yet, until I call at Luneburg Mansions. Come round on the
  third anyway."</p>

  <p>"Dear old chap," murmured Mr Carlyle, as the car edged its way ahead among
  the traffic. "Marvellous shots he makes!"</p>

  <p>In the meanwhile, at Luneburg Mansions, Mrs Straithwaite had been passing
  anything but a pleasant day. She had awakened with a headache and an
  overnight feeling that there was some unpleasantness to be gone on with. That
  it did not amount to actual fear was due to the enormous self-importance and
  the incredible ignorance which ruled the butterfly brain of the young society
  beauty&mdash;for in spite of three years' experience of married life
  Stephanie Straithwaite was as yet on the enviable side of two and twenty.</p>

  <p>Anticipating an early visit from a particularly obnoxious sister-in-law,
  she had remained in bed until after lunch in order to be able to deny herself
  with the more conviction. Three journalists who would have afforded her the
  mild excitement of being interviewed had called and been in turn put off with
  polite regrets by her husband. The objectionable sister-in-law postponed her
  visit until the afternoon and for more than an hour Stephanie "suffered
  agonies." When the visitor had left and the martyred hostess announced her
  intention of flying immediately to the consoling society of her own bridge
  circle, Straithwaite had advised her, with some significance, to wait for a
  lead. The unhappy lady cast herself bodily down upon a couch and asked
  whether she was to become a nun. Straithwaite merely shrugged his shoulders
  and remembered a club engagement. Evidently there was no need for him to
  become a monk: Stephanie followed him down the hall, arguing and protesting.
  That was how they came jointly to encounter Carrados at the door.</p>

  <p>"I have come from the Direct Insurance in the hope of being able to see
  Mrs Straithwaite," he explained, when the door opened rather suddenly before
  he had knocked. "My name is Carrados&mdash;Max Carrados."</p>

  <p>There was a moment of hesitation all round. Then Stephanie read
  difficulties in the straightening lines of her husband's face and rose
  joyfully to the occasion.</p>

  <p>"Oh yes; come in, Mr Carrados," she exclaimed graciously. "We are not
  quite strangers, you know. You found out something for Aunt Pigs; I forget
  what, but she was most frantically impressed."</p>

  <p>"Lady Poges," enlarged Straithwaite, who had stepped aside and was
  watching the development with slow, calculating eyes. "But, I say, you are
  blind, aren't you?"</p>

  <p>Carrados's smiling admission turned the edge of Mrs Straithwaite's
  impulsive, "Teddy!"</p>

  <p>"But I get along all right," he added. "I left my man down in the car and
  I found your door first shot, you see."</p>

  <p>The references reminded the velvet-eyed little mercenary that the man
  before her had the reputation of being quite desirably rich, his queer taste
  merely an eccentric hobby. The consideration made her resolve to be quite her
  nicest possible, as she led the way to the drawing-room. Then Teddy, too, had
  been horrid beyond words and must be made to suffer in the readiest way that
  offered.</p>

  <p>"Teddy is just going out and I was to be left in solitary bereavement if
  you had not appeared," she explained airily. "It wasn't very compy only to
  come to see me on business by the way, Mr Carrados, but if those are your
  only terms I must agree."</p>

  <p>Straithwaite, however, did not seem to have the least intention of going.
  He had left his hat and stick in the hall and he now threw his yellow gloves
  down on a table and took up a negligent position on the arm of an
  easy-chair.</p>

  <p>"The thing is, where do we stand?" he remarked tentatively.</p>

  <p>"That is the attitude of the insurance company, I imagine," replied
  Carrados.</p>

  <p>"I don't see that the company has any standing in the matter. We haven't
  reported any loss to them and we are not making any claim, so far. That ought
  to be enough."</p>

  <p>"I assume that they act on general inference," explained Carrados. "A
  limited liability company is not subtle, Mrs Straithwaite. This one knows
  that you have insured a five-thousand-pound pearl necklace with it, and when
  it becomes a matter of common knowledge that you have had one answering to
  that description stolen, it jumps to the conclusion that they are one and the
  same."</p>

  <p>"But they aren't&mdash;worse luck," explained the hostess. "This was a
  string that I let Markhams send me to see if I would keep."</p>

  <p>"The one that Bellitzer saw last Saturday?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," admitted Mrs Straithwaite quite simply.</p>

  <p>Straithwaite glanced sharply at Carrados and then turned his eyes with
  lazy indifference to his wife.</p>

  <p>"My dear Stephanie, what are you thinking of?" he drawled. "Of course
  those could not have been Markhams' pearls. Not knowing that you are much too
  clever to do such a foolish thing, Mr Carrados will begin to think that you
  have had fraudulent designs upon his company."</p>

  <p>Whether the tone was designed to exasperate or merely fell upon a fertile
  soil, Stephanie threw a hateful little glance in his direction.</p>

  <p>"I don't care," she exclaimed recklessly; "I haven't the least little
  objection in the world to Mr Carrados knowing exactly how it happened."</p>

  <p>Carrados put in an instinctive word of warning, even raised an arresting
  hand, but the lady was much too excited, too voluble, to be denied.</p>

  <p>"It doesn't really matter in the least, Mr Carrados, because nothing came
  of it," she explained. "There never were any real pearls to be insured. It
  would have made no difference to the company, because I did not regard this
  as an ordinary insurance from the first. It was to be a loan."</p>

  <p>"A loan?" repeated Carrados.</p>

  <p>"Yes. I shall come into heaps and heaps of money in a few years' time
  under Prin-Prin's will. Then I should pay back whatever had been
  advanced."</p>

  <p>"But would it not have been better&mdash;simpler&mdash;to have borrowed
  purely on the anticipation?"</p>

  <p>"We have," explained the lady eagerly. "We have borrowed from all sorts of
  people, and both Teddy and I have signed heaps and heaps of papers, until now
  no one will lend any more."</p>

  <p>The thing was too tragically grotesque to be laughed at. Carrados turned
  his face from one to the other and by ear, and by even finer perceptions, he
  focussed them in his mind&mdash;the delicate, feather-headed beauty, with the
  heart of a cat and the irresponsibility of a kitten, eye and mouth already
  hardening under the stress of her frantic life, and, across the room, her
  debonair consort, whose lank pose and nonchalant attitude towards the
  situation Carrados had not yet categorized.</p>

  <p>Straithwaite's dry voice, with its habitual drawl, broke into his
  reflection.</p>

  <p>"I don't suppose for a moment that you either know or care what this
  means, my dear girl, but I will proceed to enlighten you. It means the
  extreme probability that unless you can persuade Mr Carrados to hold his
  tongue, you, and&mdash;without prejudice&mdash;I also, will get two years'
  hard. And yet, with unconscious but consummate artistry, it seems to me that
  you have perhaps done the trick; for, unless I am mistaken, Mr Carrados will
  find himself unable to take advantage of your guileless confidence, whereas
  he would otherwise have quite easily found out all he wanted."</p>

  <p>"That is the most utter nonsense, Teddy," cried Stephanie, with petulant
  indignation. She turned to Carrados with the assurance of meeting
  understanding. "We know Mr Justice Enderleigh very well indeed, and if there
  was any bother I should not have the least difficulty in getting him to take
  the case privately and in explaining everything to him. But why should there
  be? Why indeed?" A brilliant little new idea possessed her. "Do you know any
  of these insurance people at all intimately, Mr Carrados?"</p>

  <p>"The General Manager and I are on terms that almost justify us in
  addressing each other as 'silly ass,'" admitted Carrados.</p>

  <p>"There you see, Teddy, you needn't have been in a funk. Mr Carrados would
  put everything right. Let me tell you exactly how I had arranged it. I dare
  say you know that insurances are only too pleased to pay for losses: it gives
  them an advertisement. Freddy Tantroy told me so, and his father is a
  director of hundreds of companies. Only, of course, it must be done quite
  regularly. Well, for months and months we had both been most frightfully hard
  up, and, unfortunately, everyone else&mdash;at least all our
  friends&mdash;seemed just as stony. I had been absolutely racking my poor
  brain for an idea when I remembered papa's wedding present. It was a string
  of pearls that he sent me from Vienna, only a month before he died; not real,
  of course, because poor papa was always quite utterly on the verge himself,
  but very good imitation and in perfect taste. Otherwise I am sure papa would
  rather have sent a silver penwiper, for although he had to live abroad
  because of what people said, his taste was simply exquisite and he was most
  romantic in his ideas. What do you say, Teddy?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing, dear; it was only my throat ticking."</p>

  <p>"I wore the pearls often and millions of people had seen them. Of course
  our own people knew about them, but others took it for granted that they were
  genuine for me to be wearing them. Teddy will tell you that I was almost
  babbling in delirium, things were becoming so ghastly, when an idea occurred.
  Tweety&mdash;she's a cousin of Teddy's, but quite an aged person&mdash;has a
  whole coffer full of jewels that she never wears and I knew that there was a
  necklace very like mine among them. She was going almost immediately to
  Africa for some shooting, so I literally flew into the wilds of Surrey and
  begged her on my knees to lend me her pearls for the Lycester House dance.
  When I got back with them I stamped on the clasp and took it at once to
  Karsfeld in Princess Street. I told him they were only paste but I thought
  they were rather good and I wanted them by the next day. And of course he
  looked at them, and then looked again, and then asked me if I was certain
  they were imitation, and I said, Well, we had never thought twice about it,
  because poor papa was always rather chronic, only certainly he did
  occasionally have fabulous streaks at the tables, and finally, like a great
  owl, Karsfeld said:</p>

  <p>"'I am happy to be able to congratulate you, madam. They are undoubtedly
  Bombay pearls of very fine orient. They are certainly worth five thousand
  pounds.'"</p>

  <p>From this point Mrs Straithwaite's narrative ran its slangy, obvious
  course. The insurance effected&mdash;on the strict understanding of the lady
  with herself that it was merely a novel form of loan, and after satisfying
  her mind on Freddy Tantroy's authority that the Direct and Intermediate could
  stand a temporary loss of five thousand pounds&mdash;the genuine pearls were
  returned to the cousin in the wilds of Surrey and Stephanie continued to wear
  the counterfeit. A decent interval was allowed to intervene and the plot was
  on the point of maturity when the company's request for a scrutiny fell like
  a thunderbolt. With many touching appeals to Mr Carrados to picture her
  frantic distraction, with appropriate little gestures of agony and despair,
  Stephanie described her absolute prostration, her subsequent wild scramble
  through the jewel stocks of London to find a substitute. The danger over, it
  became increasingly necessary to act without delay, not only to anticipate
  possible further curiosity on the part of the insurance, but in order to
  secure the means with which to meet an impending obligation held over them by
  an inflexibly obdurate Hebrew.</p>

  <p>The evening of the previous Tuesday was to be the time; the opera house,
  during the performance of <i>La Pucella</i>, the place. Straithwaite, who was
  not interested in that precise form of drama, would not be expected to be
  present, but with a false moustache and a few other touches which his
  experience as an amateur placed within his easy reach, he was to occupy a
  stall, an end stall somewhere beneath his wife's box. At an agreed signal
  Stephanie would jerk open the catch of the necklace, and as she leaned
  forward the ornament would trickle off her neck and disappear into the arena
  beneath. Straithwaite, the only one prepared for anything happening, would
  have no difficulty in securing it. He would look up quickly as if to identify
  the box, and with the jewels in his hand walk deliberately out into the
  passage. Before anyone had quite realized what was happening he would have
  left the house.</p>

  <p>Carrados turned his face from the woman to the man.</p>

  <p>"This scheme commended itself to you, Mr Straithwaite?"</p>

  <p>"Well, you see, Stephanie is so awfully clever that I took it for granted
  that the thing would go all right."</p>

  <p>"And three days before, Bellitzer had already reported misrepresentation
  and that two necklaces had been used!"</p>

  <p>"Yes," admitted Straithwaite, with an air of reluctant candour, "I had a
  suspicion that Stephanie's native ingenuity rather fizzled there. You know,
  Stephanie dear, there <i>is</i> a difference, it seems, between Bombay and
  Californian pearls."</p>

  <p>"The wretch!" exclaimed the girl, grinding her little teeth vengefully.
  "And we gave him champagne!"</p>

  <p>"But nothing came of it; so it doesn't matter?" prompted Straithwaite.</p>

  <p>"Except that now Markhams' pearls have gone and they are hinting at all
  manner of diabolical things," she wrathfully reminded him.</p>

  <p>"True," he confessed. "That is by way of a sequel, Mr Carrados. I will
  endeavour to explain that part of the incident, for even yet Stephanie seems
  unable to do me justice."</p>

  <p>He detached himself from the arm of the chair and lounged across the room
  to another chair, where he took up exactly the same position.</p>

  <p>"On the fatal evening I duly made my way to the theatre&mdash;a little
  late, so as to take my seat unobserved. After I had got the general hang I
  glanced up occasionally until I caught Stephanie's eye, by which I knew that
  she was there all right and concluded that everything was going along quite
  jollily. According to arrangement, I was to cross the theatre immediately the
  first curtain fell and standing opposite Stephanie's box twist my watch chain
  until it was certain that she had seen me. Then Stephanie was to fan herself
  three times with her programme. Both, you will see, perfectly innocent
  operations, and yet conveying to each other the intimation that all was well.
  Stephanie's idea, of course. After that, I would return to my seat and
  Stephanie would do her part at the first opportunity in Act II.</p>

  <p>"However, we never reached that. Towards the end of the first act
  something white and noiseless slipped down and fell at my feet. For the
  moment I thought they were the pearls gone wrong. Then I saw that it was a
  glove&mdash;a lady's glove. Intuition whispered that it was Stephanie's
  before I touched it. I picked it up and quietly got out. Down among the
  fingers was a scrap of paper&mdash;the corner torn off a programme. On it
  were pencilled words to this effect:</p>

  <p class="letter">"'Something quite unexpected. Can do nothing to-night. Go
  back at once and wait. May return early. Frightfully worried.&mdash;S.'"</p>

  <p>"You kept the paper, of course?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. It is in my desk in the next room. Do you care to see it?"</p>

  <p>"Please."</p>

  <p>Straithwaite left the room and Stephanie flung herself into a charming
  attitude of entreaty.</p>

  <p>"Mr Carrados, you will get them back for us, won't you? It would not
  really matter, only I seem to have signed something and now Markhams threaten
  to bring an action against us for culpable negligence in leaving them in an
  empty flat."</p>

  <p>"You see," explained Straithwaite, coming back in time to catch the drift
  of his wife's words, "except to a personal friend like yourself, it is quite
  impossible to submit these clues. The first one alone would raise
  embarrassing inquiries; the other is beyond explanation. Consequently I have
  been obliged to concoct an imaginary burglary in our absence and to drop the
  necklace case among the rhododendrons in the garden at the back, for the
  police to find."</p>

  <p>"Deeper and deeper," commented Carrados.</p>

  <p>"Why, yes. Stephanie and I are finding that out, aren't we, dear? However,
  here is the first note; also the glove. Of course I returned immediately. It
  was Stephanie's strategy and I was under her orders. In something less than
  half-an-hour I heard a motor car stop outside. Then the bell here rang.</p>

  <p>"I think I have said that I was alone. I went to the door and found a man
  who might have been anything standing there. He merely said: 'Mr
  Straithwaite?' and on my nodding handed me a letter. I tore it open in the
  hall and read it. Then I went into my room and read it again. This is it:</p>

  <p class="letter">"'<span class="smcap">Dear T</span>.,&mdash;Absolutely
  ghastly. We simply must put off to-night. Will explain that later. Now what
  do you think? Bellitzer is here in the stalls and young K. D. has asked him
  to join us at supper at the Savoy. It appears that the creature is Something
  and I suppose the D.'s want to borrow off him. I can't get out of it and I am
  literally quaking. Don't you see, he will spot something? Send me the M.
  string at once and I will change somehow before supper. I am scribbling this
  in the dark. I have got the Willoughby's man to take it. Don't, don't
  fail.&mdash;S.'"</p><br>

  <p>"It is ridiculous, preposterous," snapped Stephanie. "I never wrote a word
  of it&mdash;or the other. There was I, sitting the whole evening. And
  Teddy&mdash;oh, it is maddening!"</p>

  <p>"I took it into my room and looked at it closely," continued the unruffled
  Straithwaite. "Even if I had any reason to doubt, the internal evidence was
  convincing, but how could I doubt? It read like a continuation of the
  previous message. The writing was reasonably like Stephanie's under the
  circumstances, the envelope had obviously been obtained from the box-office
  of the theatre and the paper itself was a sheet of the programme. A corner
  was torn off; I put against it the previous scrap and they exactly fitted."
  The gentleman shrugged his shoulders, stretched his legs with deliberation
  and walked across the room to look out of the window. "I made them up into a
  neat little parcel and handed it over," he concluded.</p>

  <p>Carrados put down the two pieces of paper which he had been minutely
  examining with his finger-tips and still holding the glove addressed his
  small audience collectively.</p>

  <p>"The first and most obvious point is that whoever carried out the scheme
  had more than a vague knowledge of your affairs, not only in general but also
  relating to this&mdash;well, loan, Mrs Straithwaite."</p>

  <p>"Just what I have insisted," agreed Straithwaite. "You hear that,
  Stephanie?"</p>

  <p>"But who is there?" pleaded Stephanie, with weary intonation. "Absolutely
  no one in the wide world. Not a soul."</p>

  <p>"So one is liable to think offhand. Let us go further, however, merely
  accounting for those who are in a position to have information. There are the
  officials of the insurance company who suspect something; there is Bellitzer,
  who perhaps knows a little more. There is the lady in Surrey from whom the
  pearls were borrowed, a Mr Tantroy who seems to have been consulted, and,
  finally, your own servants. All these people have friends, or underlings, or
  observers. Suppose Mr Bellitzer's confidential clerk happens to be the
  sweetheart of your maid?"</p>

  <p>"They would still know very little."</p>

  <p>"The arc of a circle may be very little, but, given that, it is possible
  to construct the entire figure. Now your servants, Mrs Straithwaite? We are
  accusing no one, of course."</p>

  <p>"There is the cook, Mullins. She displayed alarming influenza on Tuesday
  morning, and although it was most frightfully inconvenient I packed her off
  home without a moment's delay. I have a horror of the influ. Then Fraser, the
  parlourmaid. She does my hair&mdash;I haven't really got a maid, you
  know."</p>

  <p>"Peter," prompted Straithwaite.</p>

  <p>"Oh yes, Beta. She's a daily girl and helps in the kitchen. I have no
  doubt she is capable of any villainy."</p>

  <p>"And all were out on Tuesday evening?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Mullins gone home. Beta left early as there was no dinner, and I
  told Fraser to take the evening after she had dressed me so that Teddy could
  make up and get out without being seen."</p>

  <p>Carrados turned to his other witness.</p>

  <p>"The papers and the glove have been with you ever since?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, in my desk."</p>

  <p>"Locked?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"And this glove, Mrs Straithwaite? There is no doubt that it is
  yours?"</p>

  <p>"I suppose not," she replied. "I never thought. I know that when I came to
  leave the theatre one had vanished and Teddy had it here."</p>

  <p>"That was the first time you missed it?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"But it might have gone earlier in the evening&mdash;mislaid or lost or
  stolen?"</p>

  <p>"I remember taking them off in the box. I sat in the corner farthest from
  the stage&mdash;the front row, of course&mdash;and I placed them on the
  support."</p>

  <p>"Where anyone in the next box could abstract one without much difficulty
  at a favourable moment."</p>

  <p>"That is quite likely. But we didn't see anyone in the next box."</p>

  <p>"I have half an idea that I caught sight of someone hanging back,"
  volunteered Straithwaite.</p>

  <p>"Thank you," said Carrados, turning towards him almost gratefully. "That
  is most important&mdash;that you think you saw someone hanging back. Now the
  other glove, Mrs Straithwaite; what became of that?"</p>

  <p>"An odd glove is not very much good, is it?" said Stephanie. "Certainly I
  wore it coming back. I think I threw it down somewhere in here. Probably it
  is still about. We are in a frantic muddle and nothing is being done."</p>

  <p>The second glove was found on the floor in a corner. Carrados received it
  and laid it with the other.</p>

  <p>"You use a very faint and characteristic scent, I notice, Mrs
  Straithwaite," he observed.</p>

  <p>"Yes; it is rather sweet, isn't it? I don't know the name because it is in
  Russian. A friend in the Embassy sent me some bottles from Petersburg."</p>

  <p>"But on Tuesday you supplemented it with something stronger," he
  continued, raising the gloves delicately one after the other to his face.</p>

  <p>"Oh, eucalyptus; rather," she admitted. "I simply drenched my handkerchief
  with it."</p>

  <p>"You have other gloves of the same pattern?"</p>

  <p>"Have I? Now let me think! Did you give them to me, Teddy?"</p>

  <p>"No," replied Straithwaite from the other end of the room. He had lounged
  across to the window and his attitude detached him from the discussion.
  "Didn't Whitstable?" he added shortly.</p>

  <p>"Of course. Then there are three pairs, Mr Carrados, because I never let
  Bimbi lose more than that to me at once, poor boy."</p>

  <p>"I think you are rather tiring yourself out, Stephanie," warned her
  husband.</p>

  <p>Carrados's attention seemed to leap to the voice; then he turned
  courteously to his hostess.</p>

  <p>"I appreciate that you have had a trying time lately, Mrs Straithwaite,"
  he said. "Every moment I have been hoping to let you out of the
  witness-box&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps to-morrow&mdash;&mdash;" began Straithwaite, recrossing the
  room.</p>

  <p>"Impossible; I leave town to-night," replied Carrados firmly. "You have
  three pairs of these gloves, Mrs Straithwaite. Here is one. The other
  two&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"One pair I have not worn yet. The other&mdash;good gracious, I haven't
  been out since Tuesday! I suppose it is in my glove-box."</p>

  <p>"I must see it, please."</p>

  <p>Straithwaite opened his mouth, but as his wife obediently rose to her feet
  to comply he turned sharply away with the word unspoken.</p>

  <p>"These are they," she said, returning.</p>

  <p>"Mr Carrados and I will finish our investigation in my room," interposed
  Straithwaite, with quiet assertiveness. "I should advise you to lie down for
  half-an-hour, Stephanie, if you don't want to be a nervous wreck
  to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"You must allow the culprit to endorse that good advice, Mrs
  Straithwaite," added Carrados. He had been examining the second pair of
  gloves as they spoke and he now handed them back again. "They are undoubtedly
  of the same set," he admitted, with extinguished interest, "and so our clue
  runs out."</p>

  <p>"I hope you don't mind," apologized Straithwaite, as he led his guest to
  his own smoking-room. "Stephanie," he confided, becoming more cordial as two
  doors separated them from the lady, "is a creature of nerves and
  indiscretions. She forgets. To-night she will not sleep. To-morrow she will
  suffer." Carrados divined the grin. "So shall I!"</p>

  <p>"On the contrary, pray accept my regrets," said the visitor. "Besides," he
  continued, "there is nothing more for me to do here, I suppose...."</p>

  <p>"It is a mystery," admitted Straithwaite, with polite agreement. "Will you
  try a cigarette?"</p>

  <p>"Thanks. Can you see if my car is below?" They exchanged cigarettes and
  stood at the window lighting them.</p>

  <p>"There is one point, by the way, that may have some significance."
  Carrados had begun to recross the room and stopped to pick up the two
  fictitious messages. "You will have noticed that this is the outside sheet of
  a programme. It is not the most suitable for the purpose; the first inner
  sheet is more convenient to write on, but there the date appears. You see the
  inference? The programme was obtained before&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps. Well&mdash;&mdash;?" for Carrados had broken off abruptly and
  was listening.</p>

  <p>"You hear someone coming up the steps?"</p>

  <p>"It is the general stairway."</p>

  <p>"Mr Straithwaite, I don't know how far this has gone in other quarters. We
  may only have a few seconds before we are interrupted."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"I mean that the man who is now on the stairs is a policeman or has worn
  the uniform. If he stops at your door&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The heavy tread ceased. Then came the authoritative knock.</p>

  <p>"Wait," muttered Carrados, laying his hand impressively on Straithwaite's
  tremulous arm. "I may recognize the voice."</p>

  <p>They heard the servant pass along the hall and the door unlatched; then
  caught the jumble of a gruff inquiry.</p>

  <p>"Inspector Beedel of Scotland Yard!" The servant repassed their door on
  her way to the drawing-room. "It is no good disguising the fact from you, Mr
  Straithwaite, that you may no longer be at liberty. But I am. <i>Is there
  anything you wish done?</i>"</p>

  <p>There was no time for deliberation. Straithwaite was indeed between the
  unenviable alternatives of the familiar proverb, but, to do him justice, his
  voice had lost scarcely a ripple of its usual sang-froid.</p>

  <p>"Thanks," he replied, taking a small stamped and addressed parcel from his
  pocket, "you might drop this into some obscure pillar-box, if you will."</p>

  <p>"The Markham necklace?"</p>

  <p>"Exactly. I was going out to post it when you came."</p>

  <p>"I am sure you were."</p>

  <p>"And if you could spare five minutes later&mdash;if I am
  here&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Carrados slid his cigarette-case under some papers on the desk.</p>

  <p>"I will call for that," he assented. "Let us say about half-past
  eight."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">"I am still at large, you see, Mr Carrados; though after
  reflecting on the studied formality of the inspector's business here, I
  imagine that you will scarcely be surprised."</p>

  <p>"I have made it a habit," admitted Carrados, "never to be surprised."</p>

  <p>"However, I still want to cut a rather different figure in your eyes. You
  regard me, Mr Carrados, either as a detected rogue or a repentant ass?"</p>

  <p>"Another excellent rule is never to form deductions from
  uncertainties."</p>

  <p>Straithwaite made a gesture of mild impatience.</p>

  <p>"You only give me ten minutes. If I am to put my case before you, Mr
  Carrados, we cannot fence with phrases.... To-day you have had an exceptional
  opportunity of penetrating into our mode of life. You will, I do not doubt,
  have summed up our perpetual indebtedness and the easy credit that our
  connexion procures; Stephanie's social ambitions and expensive popularity;
  her utterly extravagant incapacity to see any other possible existence; and
  my tacit acquiescence. You will, I know, have correctly gauged her
  irresponsible, neurotic temperament, and judged the result of it in conflict
  with my own. What possibly has escaped you, for in society one has to
  disguise these things, is that I still love my wife.</p>

  <p>"When you dare not trust the soundness of your reins you do not try to
  pull up a bolting horse. For three years I have endeavoured to guide
  Stephanie round awkward comers with as little visible restraint as possible.
  When we differ over any project upon which she has set her heart Stephanie
  has one strong argument."</p>

  <p>"That you no longer love her?"</p>

  <p>"Well, perhaps; but more forcibly expressed. She rushes to the top of the
  building&mdash;there are six floors, Mr Carrados, and we are on the
  second&mdash;and climbing on to the banister she announces her intention of
  throwing herself down into the basement. In the meanwhile I have followed her
  and drag her back again. One day I shall stay where I am and let her do as
  she intends."</p>

  <p>"I hope not," said Carrados gravely.</p>

  <p>"Oh, don't be concerned. She will then climb back herself. But it will
  mark an epoch. It was by that threat that she obtained my acquiescence to
  this scheme&mdash;that and the certainty that she would otherwise go on
  without me. But I had no intention of allowing her to land herself&mdash;to
  say nothing of us both&mdash;behind the bars of a prison if I could help it.
  And, above all, I wished to cure her of her fatuous delusion that she is
  clever, in the hope that she may then give up being foolish.</p>

  <p>"To fail her on the occasion was merely to postpone the attempt. I
  conceived the idea of seeming to cooperate and at the same time involving us
  in what appeared to be a clever counter-fraud. The thought of the real loss
  will perhaps have a good effect; the publicity will certainly prevent her
  from daring a second 'theft.' A sordid story, Mr Carrados," he concluded. "Do
  not forget your cigarette-case in reality."</p>

  <p>The paternal shake of Carrados's head over the recital was neutralized by
  his benevolent smile.</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes," he said. "I think we can classify you, Mr Straithwaite. One
  point&mdash;the glove?"</p>

  <p>"That was an afterthought. I had arranged the whole story and the first
  note was to be brought to me by an attendant. Then, on my way, in my overcoat
  pocket I discovered a pair of Stephanie's gloves which she had asked me to
  carry the day before. The suggestion flashed&mdash;how much more convincing
  if I could arrange for her to seem to drop the writing in that way. As she
  said, the next box <i>was</i> empty; I merely took possession of it for a few
  minutes and quietly drew across one of her gloves. And that reminds
  me&mdash;of course there was nothing in it, but your interest in them made me
  rather nervous."</p>

  <p>Carrados laughed outright. Then he stood up and held out his hand.</p>

  <p>"Good-night, Mr Straithwaite," he said, with real friendliness. "Let me
  give you the quaker's advice: Don't attempt another conspiracy&mdash;but if
  you do, don't produce a 'pair' of gloves of which one is still suggestive of
  scent, and the other identifiable with eucalyptus!"</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;&mdash;!" said Straithwaite.</p>

  <p>"Quite so. But at all hazard suppress a second pair that has the same
  peculiarity. Think over what it must mean. Good-bye."</p>

  <p>Twelve minutes later Mr Carlyle was called to the telephone.</p>

  <p>"It is eight-fifty-five and I am at Charing Cross," said a voice he knew.
  "If you want local colour contrive an excuse to be with Markham when the
  first post arrives to-morrow." A few more words followed, and an affectionate
  valediction.</p>

  <p>"One moment, my dear Max, one moment. Do I understand you to say that you
  will post me on the report of the case from Dover?"</p>

  <p>"No, Louis," replied Carrados, with cryptic discrimination. "I only said
  that I will post you on <i>a</i> report of the case from Dover."</p>

  <h3>Serialised in <i>The News Of The World</i>, Oct 5-12, 1913, as "The Great
  Safe Deposit Coup"</h3>

  <p class="first">The one insignificant fact upon which turned the following
  incident in the joint experiences of Mr Carlyle and Max Carrados was merely
  this: that having called upon his friend just at the moment when the private
  detective was on the point of leaving his office to go to the safe deposit in
  Lucas Street, Piccadilly, the blind amateur accompanied him, and for ten
  minutes amused himself by sitting quite quietly among the palms in the centre
  of the circular hall while Mr Carlyle was occupied with his deed-box in one
  of the little compartments provided for the purpose.</p>

  <p>The Lucas Street depository was then (it has since been converted into a
  picture palace) generally accepted as being one of the strongest places in
  London. The front of the building was constructed to represent a gigantic
  safe door, and under the colloquial designation of "The Safe" the place had
  passed into a synonym for all that was secure and impregnable. Half of the
  marketable securities in the west of London were popularly reported to have
  seen the inside of its coffers at one time or another, together with the same
  generous proportion of family jewels. However exaggerated an estimate this
  might be, the substratum of truth was solid and auriferous enough to dazzle
  the imagination. When ordinary safes were being carried bodily away with
  impunity or ingeniously fused open by the scientifically equipped cracksman,
  nervous bond-holders turned with relief to the attractions of an
  establishment whose modest claim was summed up in its telegraphic address:
  "Impregnable." To it went also the jewel-case between the lady's social
  engagements, and when in due course "the family" journeyed north&mdash;or
  south, east or west&mdash;whenever, in short, the London house was closed,
  its capacious storerooms received the plate-chest as an established custom.
  Not a few traders also&mdash;jewellers, financiers, dealers in pictures,
  antiques and costly bijouterie, for instance&mdash;constantly used its
  facilities for any stock that they did not requite immediately to hand.</p>

  <p>There was only one entrance to the place, an exaggerated keyhole, to carry
  out the similitude of the safe-door alluded to. The ground floor was occupied
  by the ordinary offices of the company; all the strong-rooms and safes lay in
  the steel-cased basement. This was reached both by a lift and by a flight of
  steps. In either case the visitor found before him a grille of massive
  proportions. Behind its bars stood a formidable commissionaire who never left
  his post, his sole duty being to open and close the grille to arriving and
  departing clients. Beyond this, a short passage led into the round central
  hall where Carrados was waiting. From this part, other passages radiated off
  to the vaults and strong-rooms, each one barred from the hall by a grille
  scarcely less ponderous than the first one. The doors of the various private
  rooms put at the disposal of the company's clients, and that of the manager's
  office, filled the wall-space between the radiating passages. Everything was
  very quiet, everything looked very bright, and everything seemed hopelessly
  impregnable.</p>

  <p>"But I wonder?" ran Carrados's dubious reflection; as he reached this
  point.</p>

  <p>"Sorry to have kept you so long, my dear Max," broke in Mr Carlyle's crisp
  voice. He had emerged from his compartment and was crossing the hall,
  deed-box in hand. "Another minute and I will be with you."</p>

  <p>Carrados smiled and nodded and resumed his former expression, which was
  merely that of an uninterested gentleman waiting patiently for another. It is
  something of an attainment to watch closely without betraying undue
  curiosity, but others of the senses&mdash;hearing and smelling, for
  instance&mdash;can be keenly engaged while the observer possibly has the
  appearance of falling asleep.</p>

  <p>"Now," announced Mr Carlyle, returning briskly to his friend's chair, and
  drawing on his grey suede gloves.</p>

  <p>"You are in no particular hurry?"</p>

  <p>"No," admitted the professional man, with the slowness of mild surprise.
  "Not at all. What do you propose?"</p>

  <p>"It is very pleasant here," replied Carrados tranquilly. "Very cool and
  restful with this armoured steel between us and the dust and scurry of the
  hot July afternoon above. I propose remaining here for a few minutes
  longer."</p>

  <p>"Certainly," agreed Mr Carlyle, taking the nearest chair and eyeing
  Carrados as though he had a shrewd suspicion of something more than met the
  ear. "I believe some very interesting people rent safes here. We may
  encounter a bishop, or a winning jockey, or even a musical comedy actress.
  Unfortunately it seems to be rather a slack time."</p>

  <p>"Two men came down while you were in your cubicle," remarked Carrados
  casually. "The first took the lift. I imagine that he was a middle-aged,
  rather portly man. He carried a stick, wore a silk hat, and used spectacles
  for close sight. The other came by the stairway. I infer that he arrived at
  the top immediately after the lift had gone. He ran down the steps, so that
  the two were admitted at the same time, but the second man, though the more
  active of the pair, hung back for a moment in the passage and the portly one
  was the first to go to his safe."</p>

  <p>Mr Carlyle's knowing look expressed: "Go on, my friend; you are coming to
  something." But he merely contributed an encouraging "Yes?"</p>

  <p>"When you emerged just now our second man quietly opened the door of his
  pen a fraction. Doubtless he looked out. Then he closed it as quietly again.
  You were not his man, Louis."</p>

  <p>"I am grateful," said Mr Carlyle expressively. "What next, Louis?"</p>

  <p>"That is all; they are still closeted."</p>

  <p>Both were silent for a moment. Mr Carlyle's feeling was one of unconfessed
  perplexity. So far the incident was utterly trivial in his eyes; but he knew
  that the trifles which appeared significant to Max had a way of standing out
  like signposts when the time came to look back over an episode. Carrados's
  sightless faculties seemed indeed to keep him just a move ahead as the game
  progressed.</p>

  <p>"Is there really anything in it, Max?" he asked at length.</p>

  <p>"Who can say?" replied Carrados. "At least we may wait to see them go.
  Those tin deed-boxes now. There is one to each safe, I think?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, so I imagine. The practice is to carry the box to your private lair
  and there unlock it and do your business. Then you lock it up again and take
  it back to your safe."</p>

  <p>"Steady! our first man," whispered Carrados hurriedly. "Here, look at this
  with me." He opened a paper&mdash;a prospectus&mdash;which he pulled from his
  pocket, and they affected to study its contents together.</p>

  <p>"You were about right, my friend," muttered Mr Carlyle, pointing to a
  paragraph of assumed interest. "Hat, stick and spectacles. He is a
  clean-shaven, pink-faced old boy. I believe&mdash;yes, I know the man by
  sight. He is a bookmaker in a large way, I am told."</p>

  <p>"Here comes the other," whispered Carrados.</p>

  <p>The bookmaker passed across the hall, joined on his way by the manager
  whose duty it was to counterlock the safe, and disappeared along one of the
  passages. The second man sauntered up and down, waiting his turn. Mr Carlyle
  reported his movements in an undertone and described him. He was a younger
  man than the other, of medium height, and passably well dressed in a quiet
  lounge suit, green Alpine hat and brown shoes. By the time the detective had
  reached his wavy chestnut hair, large and rather ragged moustache, and sandy,
  freckled complexion, the first man had completed his business and was leaving
  the place.</p>

  <p>"It isn't an exchange lay, at all events," said Mr Carlyle. "His inner
  case is only half the size of the other and couldn't possibly be
  substituted."</p>

  <p>"Come up now," said Carrados, rising. "There is nothing more to be learned
  down here."</p>

  <p>They requisitioned the lift and on the steps outside the gigantic keyhole
  stood for a few minutes discussing an investment as a couple of trustees or a
  lawyer and a client who were parting there might do. Fifty yards away, a very
  large silk hat with a very curly brim marked the progress of the bookmaker
  towards Piccadilly.</p>

  <p>The lift in the hall behind them swirled up again and the gate clashed.
  The second man walked leisurely out and sauntered away without a backward
  glance.</p>

  <p>"He has gone in the opposite direction," exclaimed Mr Carlyle, rather
  blankly. "It isn't the 'lame goat' nor the 'follow-me-on,' nor even the
  homely but efficacious sand-bag."</p>

  <p>"What colour were his eyes?" asked Carrados.</p>

  <p>"Upon my word, I never noticed," admitted the other.</p>

  <p>"Parkinson would have noticed," was the severe comment.</p>

  <p>"I am not Parkinson," retorted Mr Carlyle, with asperity, "and, strictly
  as one dear friend to another, Max, permit me to add, that while cherishing
  an unbounded admiration for your remarkable gifts, I have the strongest
  suspicion that the whole incident is a ridiculous mare's nest, bred in the
  fantastic imagination of an enthusiastic criminologist."</p>

  <p>Mr Carrados received this outburst with the utmost benignity. "Come and
  have a coffee, Louis," he suggested. "Mehmed's is only a street away."</p>

  <p>Mehmed proved to be a cosmopolitan gentleman from Mocha whose shop
  resembled a house from the outside and an Oriental divan when one was within.
  A turbaned Arab placed cigarettes and cups of coffee spiced with saffron
  before the customers, gave salaam and withdrew.</p>

  <p>"You know, my dear chap," continued Mr Carlyle, sipping his black coffee
  and wondering privately whether it was really very good or very bad,
  "speaking quite seriously, the one fishy detail&mdash;our ginger friend's
  watching for the other to leave&mdash;may be open to a dozen very innocent
  explanations."</p>

  <p>"So innocent that to-morrow I intend taking a safe myself."</p>

  <p>"You think that everything is all right?"</p>

  <p>"On the contrary, I am convinced that something is very wrong."</p>

  <p>"Then why&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"I shall keep nothing there, but it will give me the <i>entre</i>. I
  should advise you, Louis, in the first place to empty your safe with all
  possible speed, and in the second to leave your business card on the
  manager."</p>

  <p>Mr Carlyle pushed his cup away, convinced now that the coffee was really
  very bad.</p>

  <p>"But, my dear Max, the place&mdash;'The Safe'&mdash;is impregnable!"</p>

  <p>"When I was in the States, three years ago, the head porter at one hotel
  took pains to impress on me that the building was absolutely fireproof. I at
  once had my things taken off to another hotel. Two weeks later the first
  place was burnt out. It <i>was</i> fireproof, I believe, but of course the
  furniture and the fittings were not and the walls gave way."</p>

  <p>"Very ingenious," admitted Mr Carlyle, "but why did you really go? You
  know you can't humbug me with your superhuman sixth sense, my friend."</p>

  <p>Carrados smiled pleasantly, thereby encouraging the watchful attendant to
  draw near and replenish their tiny cups.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," replied the blind man, "because so many careless people were
  satisfied that it was fireproof."</p>

  <p>"Ah-ha, there you are&mdash;the greater the confidence the greater the
  risk. But only if your self-confidence results in carelessness. Now do you
  know how this place is secured, Max?"</p>

  <p>"I am told that they lock the door at night," replied Carrados, with bland
  malice.</p>

  <p>"And hide the key under the mat to be ready for the first arrival in the
  morning," crowed Mr Carlyle, in the same playful spirit. "Dear old chap!
  Well, let me tell you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That force is out of the question. Quite so," admitted his friend.</p>

  <p>"That simplifies the argument. Let us consider fraud. There again the
  precautions are so rigid that many people pronounce the forms a nuisance. I
  confess that I do not. I regard them as a means of protecting my own property
  and I cheerfully sign my name and give my password, which the manager
  compares with his record-book before he releases the first lock of my safe.
  The signature is burned before my eyes in a sort of crucible there, the
  password is of my own choosing and is written only in a book that no one but
  the manager ever sees, and my key is the sole one in existence."</p>

  <p>"No duplicate or master-key?"</p>

  <p>"Neither. If a key is lost it takes a skilful mechanic half-a-day to cut
  his way in. Then you must remember that clients of a safe-deposit are not
  multitudinous. All are known more or less by sight to the officials there,
  and a stranger would receive close attention. Now, Max, by what combination
  of circumstances is a rogue to know my password, to be able to forge my
  signature, to possess himself of my key, and to resemble me personally? And,
  finally, how is he possibly to determine beforehand whether there is anything
  in my safe to repay so elaborate a plant?" Mr Carlyle concluded in triumph
  and was so carried away by the strength of his position that he drank off the
  contents of his second cup before he realized what he was doing.</p>

  <p>"At the hotel I just spoke of," replied Carrados, "there was an attendant
  whose one duty in case of alarm was to secure three iron doors. On the night
  of the fire he had a bad attack of toothache and slipped away for just a
  quarter of an hour to have the thing out. There was a most up-to-date system
  of automatic fire alarm; it had been tested only the day before and the
  electrician, finding some part not absolutely to his satisfaction, had taken
  it away and not had time to replace it. The night watchman, it turned out,
  had received leave to present himself a couple of hours later on that
  particular night, and the hotel fireman, whose duties he took over, had
  missed being notified. Lastly, there was a big riverside blaze at the same
  time and all the engines were down at the other end of the city."</p>

  <p>Mr Carlyle committed himself to a dubious monosyllable. Carrados leaned
  forward a little.</p>

  <p>"All these circumstances formed a coincidence of pure chance. Is it not
  conceivable, Louis, that an even more remarkable series might be brought
  about by design?"</p>

  <p>"Our tawny friend?"</p>

  <p>"Possibly. Only he was not really tawny." Mr Carlyle's easy attitude
  suddenly stiffened into rigid attention. "He wore a false moustache."</p>

  <p>"He wore a false moustache!" repeated the amazed gentleman. "And you
  cannot see! No, really, Max, this is beyond the limit!"</p>

  <p>"If only you would not trust your dear, blundering old eyes so implicitly
  you would get nearer that limit yourself," retorted Carrados. "The man
  carried a five-yard aura of spirit gum, emphasized by a warm, perspiring
  skin. That inevitably suggested one thing. I looked for further evidence of
  making-up and found it&mdash;these preparations all smell. The hair you
  described was characteristically that of a wig&mdash;worn long to hide the
  joining and made wavy to minimize the length. All these things are trifles.
  As yet we have not gone beyond the initial stage of suspicion. I will tell
  you another trifle. When this man retired to a compartment with his deed-box,
  he never even opened it. Possibly it contains a brick and a newspaper. He is
  only watching."</p>

  <p>"Watching the bookmaker."</p>

  <p>"True, but it may go far wider than that. Everything points to a plot of
  careful elaboration. Still, if you are satisfied&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I am quite satisfied," replied Mr Carlyle gallantly. "I regard 'The Safe'
  almost as a national institution, and as such I have an implicit faith in its
  precautions against every kind of force or fraud." So far Mr Carlyle's
  attitude had been suggestive of a rock, but at this point he took out his
  watch, hummed a little to pass the time, consulted his watch again, and
  continued: "I am afraid that there were one or two papers which I overlooked.
  It would perhaps save me coming again to-morrow if I went back
  now&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Quite so," acquiesced Carrados, with perfect gravity. "I will wait for
  you."</p>

  <p>For twenty minutes he sat there, drinking an occasional tiny cup of boiled
  coffee and to all appearance placidly enjoying the quaint atmosphere which Mr
  Mehmed had contrived to transplant from the shore of the Persian Gulf.</p>

  <p>At the end of that period Carlyle returned, politely effusive about the
  time he had kept his friend waiting but otherwise bland and unassailable.
  Anyone with eyes might have noticed that he carried a parcel of about the
  same size and dimensions as the deed-box that fitted his safe.</p>

  <p>The next day Carrados presented himself at the safe-deposit as an
  intending renter. The manager showed him over the vaults and strong-rooms,
  explaining the various precautions taken to render the guile or force of man
  impotent: the strength of the chilled-steel walls, the casing of
  electricity-resisting concrete, the stupendous isolation of the whole inner
  fabric on metal pillars so that the watchman, while inside the building,
  could walk above, below, and all round the outer walls of what was
  really&mdash;although it bore no actual relationship to the advertising
  device of the front&mdash;a monstrous safe; and, finally, the arrangement
  which would enable the basement to be flooded with steam within three minutes
  of an alarm. These details were public property. "The Safe" was a showplace
  and its directors held that no harm could come of displaying a strong
  hand.</p>

  <p>Accompanied by the observant eyes of Parkinson, Carrados gave an
  adventurous but not a hopeful attention to these particulars. Submitting the
  problem of the tawny man to his own ingenuity, he was constantly putting
  before himself the question: How shall I set about robbing this place? and he
  had already dismissed force as impracticable. Nor, when it came to the
  consideration of fraud, did the simple but effective safeguards which Mr
  Carlyle had specified seem to offer any loophole.</p>

  <p>"As I am blind I may as well sign in the book," he suggested, when the
  manager passed to him a gummed slip for the purpose. The precaution against
  one acquiring particulars of another client might well be deemed superfluous
  in his case.</p>

  <p>But the manager did not fall into the trap.</p>

  <p>"It is our invariable rule in all cases, sir," he replied courteously.
  "What word will you take?" Parkinson, it may be said, had been left in the
  hall.</p>

  <p>"Suppose I happen to forget it? How do we proceed?"</p>

  <p>"In that case I am afraid that I might have to trouble you to establish
  your identity," the manager explained. "It rarely happens."</p>

  <p>"Then we will say 'Conspiracy.'"</p>

  <p>The word was written down and the book closed.</p>

  <p>"Here is your key, sir. If you will allow me&mdash;your key-
  ring&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>A week went by and Carrados was no nearer the absolute solution of the
  problem he had set himself. He had, indeed, evolved several ways by which the
  contents of the safes might be reached, some simple and desperate, hanging on
  the razor-edge of chance to fall this way or that; others more elaborate,
  safer on the whole, but more liable to break down at some point of their
  ingenious intricacy. And setting aside complicity on the part of the
  manager&mdash;a condition that Carrados had satisfied himself did not
  exist&mdash;they all depended on a relaxation of the forms by which security
  was assured. Carrados continued to have several occasions to visit the safe
  during the week, and he "watched" with a quiet persistence that was deadly in
  its scope. But from beginning to end there was no indication of slackness in
  the business-like methods of the place; nor during any of his visits did the
  "tawny man" appear in that or any other disguise. Another week passed; Mr
  Carlyle was becoming inexpressibly waggish, and Carrados himself, although he
  did not abate a jot of his conviction, was compelled to bend to the realities
  of the situation. The manager, with the obstinacy of a conscientious man who
  had become obsessed with the pervading note of security, excused himself from
  discussing abstract methods of fraud. Carrados was not in a position to
  formulate a detailed charge; he withdrew from active investigation, content
  to await his time.</p>

  <p>It came, to be precise, on a certain Friday morning, seventeen days after
  his first visit to "The Safe." Returning late on the Thursday night, he was
  informed that a man giving the name of Draycott had called to see him.
  Apparently the matter had been of some importance to the visitor for he had
  returned three hours later on the chance of finding Mr Carrados in.
  Disappointed in this, he had left a note. Carrados cut open the envelope and
  ran a finger along the following words:&mdash;</p><br>

  <p class="letter">"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I have to-day
  consulted Mr Louis Carlyle, who thinks that you would like to see me. I will
  call again in the morning, say at nine o'clock. If this is too soon or
  otherwise inconvenient I entreat you to leave a message fixing as early an
  hour as possible.</p>

  <p class="letter">Yours faithfully, <span class="smcap">Herbert
  Draycott</span>."</p>

  <p class="letter">"P.S.&mdash;I should add that I am the renter of a safe at
  the Lucas Street depository. <span class="smcap">H.D.</span>"</p><br>

  <p>A description of Mr Draycott made it clear that he was not the West-End
  bookmaker. The caller, the servant explained, was a thin, wiry, keen-faced
  man. Carrados felt agreeably interested in this development, which seemed to
  justify his suspicion of a plot.</p>

  <p>At five minutes to nine the next morning Mr Draycott again presented
  himself.</p>

  <p>"Very good of you to see me so soon, sir," he apologized, on Carrados at
  once receiving him. "I don't know much of English ways&mdash;I'm an
  Australian&mdash;and I was afraid it might be too early."</p>

  <p>"You could have made it a couple of hours earlier as far as I am
  concerned," replied Carrados. "Or you either for that matter, I imagine," he
  added, "for I don't think that you slept much last night."</p>

  <p>"I didn't sleep at all last night," corrected Mr Draycott. "But it's
  strange that you should have seen that. I understood from Mr Carlyle that
  you&mdash;excuse me if I am mistaken, sir&mdash;but I understood that you
  were blind."</p>

  <p>Carrados laughed his admission lightly.</p>

  <p>"Oh yes," he said. "But never mind that. What is the trouble?"</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid it means more than just trouble for me, Mr Carrados." The man
  had steady, half-closed eyes, with the suggestion of depth which one notices
  in the eyes of those whose business it is to look out over great expanses of
  land or water; they were turned towards Carrados's face with quiet
  resignation in their frankness now. "I'm afraid it spells disaster. I am a
  working engineer from the Mount Magdalena district of Coolgardie. I don't
  want to take up your time with outside details so I will only say that about
  two years ago I had an opportunity of acquiring a share in a very promising
  claim&mdash;gold, you understand, both reef and alluvial. As the work went on
  I put more and more into the undertaking&mdash;you couldn't call it a venture
  by that time. The results were good, better than we had dared to expect, but
  from one cause and another the expenses were terrible. We saw that it was a
  bigger thing than we had bargained for and we admitted that we must get
  outside help."</p>

  <p>So far Mr Draycott's narrative had proceeded smoothly enough under the
  influence of the quiet despair that had come over the man. But at this point
  a sudden recollection of his position swept him into a frenzy of
  bitterness.</p>

  <p>"Oh, what the blazes is the good of going over all this again!" he broke
  out. "What can you or anyone else do anyhow? I've been robbed, rooked,
  cleared out of everything I possess," and tormented by recollections and by
  the impotence of his rage the unfortunate engineer beat the oak table with
  the back of his hand until his knuckles bled.</p>

  <p>Carrados waited until the fury had passed.</p>

  <p>"Continue, if you please, Mr Draycott," he said. "Just what you thought it
  best to tell me is just what I want to know."</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry, sir," apologized the man, colouring under his tanned skin. "I
  ought to be able to control myself better. But this business has shaken me.
  Three times last night I looked down the barrel of my revolver, and three
  times I threw it away.... Well, we arranged that I should come to London to
  interest some financiers in the property. We might have done it locally or in
  Perth, to be sure, but then, don't you see, they would have wanted to get
  control. Six weeks ago I landed here. I brought with me specimens of the
  quartz and good samples of extracted gold, dust and nuggets, the clearing up
  of several weeks' working, about two hundred and forty ounces in all. That
  includes the Magdalena Lodestar, our lucky nugget, a lump weighing just under
  seven pounds of pure gold.</p>

  <p>"I had seen an advertisement of this Lucas Street safe-deposit and it
  seemed just the thing I wanted. Besides the gold, I had all the papers to do
  with the claims&mdash;plans, reports, receipts, licences and so on. Then when
  I cashed my letter of credit I had about one hundred and fifty pounds in
  notes. Of course I could have left everything at a bank but it was more
  convenient to have it, as it were, in my own safe, to get at any time, and to
  have a private room that I could take any gentlemen to. I hadn't a suspicion
  that anything could be wrong. Negotiations hung on in several
  quarters&mdash;it's a bad time to do business here, I find. Then, yesterday,
  I wanted something. I went to Lucas Street, as I had done half-a-dozen times
  before, opened my safe, and had the inner case carried to a room.... Mr
  Carrados, it was empty!"</p>

  <p>"Quite empty?"</p>

  <p>"No." He laughed bitterly. "At the bottom was a sheet of wrapper paper. I
  recognized it as a piece I had left there in case I wanted to make up a
  parcel. But for that I should have been convinced that I had somehow opened
  the wrong safe. That was my first idea."</p>

  <p>"It cannot be done."</p>

  <p>"So I understand, sir. And, then, there was the paper with my name written
  on it in the empty tin. I was dazed; it seemed impossible. I think I stood
  there without moving for minutes&mdash;it was more like hours. Then I closed
  the tin box again, took it back, locked up the safe and came out."</p>

  <p>"Without notifying anything wrong?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Mr Carrados." The steady blue eyes regarded him with pained
  thoughtfulness. "You see, I reckoned it out in that time that it must be
  someone about the place who had done it."</p>

  <p>"You were wrong," said Carrados.</p>

  <p>"So Mr Carlyle seemed to think. I only knew that the key had never been
  out of my possession and I had told no one of the password. Well, it did come
  over me rather like cold water down the neck, that there was I alone in the
  strongest dungeon in London and not a living soul knew where I was."</p>

  <p>"Possibly a sort of up-to-date Sweeney Todd's?"</p>

  <p>"I'd heard of such things in London," admitted Draycott. "Anyway, I got
  out. It was a mistake; I see it now. Who is to believe me as it is&mdash;it
  sounds a sort of unlikely tale. And how do they come to pick on me? to know
  what I had? I don't drink, or open my mouth, or hell round. It beats me."</p>

  <p>"They didn't pick on you&mdash;you picked on them," replied Carrados.
  "Never mind how; you'll be believed all right. But as for getting anything
  back&mdash;&mdash;" The unfinished sentence confirmed Mr Draycott in his
  gloomiest anticipations.</p>

  <p>"I have the numbers of the notes," he suggested, with an attempt at
  hopefulness. "They can be stopped, I take it?"</p>

  <p>"Stopped? Yes," admitted Carrados. "And what does that amount to? The
  banks and the police stations will be notified and every little public-house
  between here and Land's End will change one for the scribbling of 'John
  Jones' across the back. No, Mr Draycott, it's awkward, I dare say, but you
  must make up your mind to wait until you can get fresh supplies from home.
  Where are you staying?"</p>

  <p>Draycott hesitated.</p>

  <p>"I have been at the Abbotsford, in Bloomsbury, up to now," he said, with
  some embarrassment. "The fact is, Mr Carrados, I think I ought to have told
  you how I was placed before consulting you, because I&mdash;I see no prospect
  of being able to pay my way. Knowing that I had plenty in the safe, I had run
  it rather close. I went chiefly yesterday to get some notes. I have a week's
  hotel bill in my pocket, and"&mdash;he glanced down at his
  trousers&mdash;"I've ordered one or two other things unfortunately."</p>

  <p>"That will be a matter of time, doubtless," suggested the other
  encouragingly.</p>

  <p>Instead of replying Draycott suddenly dropped his arms on to the table and
  buried his face between them. A minute passed in silence.</p>

  <p>"It's no good, Mr Carrados," he said, when he was able to speak; "I can't
  meet it. Say what you like, I simply can't tell those chaps that I've lost
  everything we had and ask them to send me more. They couldn't do it if I did.
  Understand, sir. The mine is a valuable one; we have the greatest faith in
  it, but it has gone beyond our depth. The three of us have put everything we
  own into it. While I am here they are doing labourers' work for a wage, just
  to keep going ... waiting, oh, my God! waiting for good news from me!"</p>

  <p>Carrados walked round the table to his desk and wrote. Then, without a
  word, he held out a paper to his visitor.</p>

  <p>"What's this?" demanded Draycott, in bewilderment. "It's&mdash;it's a
  cheque for a hundred pounds."</p>

  <p>"It will carry you on," explained Carrados imperturbably. "A man like you
  isn't going to throw up the sponge for this set-back. Cable to your partners
  that you require copies of all the papers at once. They'll manage it, never
  fear. The gold ... must go. Write fully by the next mail. Tell them
  everything and add that in spite of all you feel that you are nearer success
  than ever."</p>

  <p>Mr Draycott folded the cheque with thoughtful deliberation and put it
  carefully away in his pocket-book.</p>

  <p>"I don't know whether you've guessed as much, sir," he said in a queer
  voice, "but I think that you've saved a man's life to-day. It's not the
  money, it's the encouragement ... and faith. If you could see you'd know
  better than I can say how I feel about it."</p>

  <p>Carrados laughed quietly. It always amused him to have people explain how
  much more he would learn if he had eyes.</p>

  <p>"Then we'll go on to Lucas Street and give the manager the shock of his
  life," was all he said. "Come, Mr Draycott, I have already rung up the
  car."</p>

  <p>But, as it happened, another instrument had been destined to apply that
  stimulating experience to the manager. As they stepped out of the car
  opposite "The Safe" a taxicab drew up and Mr Carlyle's alert and cheery voice
  hailed them.</p>

  <p>"A moment, Max," he called, turning to settle with his driver, a
  transaction that he invested with an air of dignified urbanity which almost
  made up for any small pecuniary disappointment that may have accompanied it.
  "This is indeed fortunate. Let us compare notes for a moment. I have just
  received an almost imploring message from the manager to come at once. I
  assumed that it was the affair of our colonial friend here, but he went on to
  mention Professor Holmfast Bulge. Can it really be possible that he also has
  made a similar discovery?"</p>

  <p>"What did the manager say?" asked Carrados.</p>

  <p>"He was practically incoherent, but I really think it must be so. What
  have you done?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing," replied Carrados. He turned his back on "The Safe" and appeared
  to be regarding the other side of the street. "There is a tobacconist's shop
  directly opposite?"</p>

  <p>"There is."</p>

  <p>"What do they sell on the first floor?"</p>

  <p>"Possibly they sell 'Rubbo.' I hazard the suggestion from the legend 'Rub
  in Rubbo for Everything' which embellishes each window."</p>

  <p>"The windows are frosted?"</p>

  <p>"They are, to half-way up, mysterious man."</p>

  <p>Carrados walked back to his motor car.</p>

  <p>"While we are away, Parkinson, go across and buy a tin, bottle, box or
  packet of 'Rubbo.'"</p>

  <p>"What is 'Rubbo,' Max?" chirped Mr Carlyle with insatiable curiosity.</p>

  <p>"So far we do not know. When Parkinson gets some, Louis, you shall be the
  one to try it."</p>

  <p>They descended into the basement and were passed in by the grille-keeper,
  whose manner betrayed a discreet consciousness of something in the air. It
  was unnecessary to speculate why. In the distance, muffled by the armoured
  passages, an authoritative voice boomed like a sonorous bell heard under
  water.</p>

  <p>"What, however, are the facts?" it was demanding, with the causticity of
  baffled helplessness. "I am assured that there is no other key in existence;
  yet my safe has been unlocked. I am given to understand that without the
  password it would be impossible for an unauthorized person to tamper with my
  property. My password, deliberately chosen, is 'anthropophaginian,' sir. Is
  it one that is familiarly on the lips of the criminal classes? But my safe is
  empty! What is the explanation? Who are the guilty persons? What is being
  done? Where are the police?"</p>

  <p>"If you consider that the proper course to adopt is to stand on the
  doorstep and beckon in the first constable who happens to pass, permit me to
  say, sir, that I differ from you," retorted the distracted manager. "You may
  rely on everything possible being done to clear up the mystery. As I told
  you, I have already telephoned for a capable private detective and for one of
  my directors."</p>

  <p>"But that is not enough," insisted the professor angrily. "Will one mere
  private detective restore my 6000 Japanese 4-1/2 per cent. bearer bonds? Is
  the return of my irreplaceable notes on 'Polyphyletic Bridal Customs among
  the mid-Pleistocene Cave Men' to depend on a solitary director? I demand that
  the police shall be called in&mdash;as many as are available. Let Scotland
  Yard be set in motion. A searching inquiry must be made. I have only been a
  user of your precious establishment for six months, and this is the
  result."</p>

  <p>"There you hold the key of the mystery, Professor Bulge," interposed
  Carrados quietly.</p>

  <p>"Who is this, sir?" demanded the exasperated professor at large.</p>

  <p>"Permit me," explained Mr Carlyle, with bland assurance. "I am Louis
  Carlyle, of Bampton Street. This gentleman is Mr Max Carrados, the eminent
  amateur specialist in crime."</p>

  <p>"I shall be thankful for any assistance towards elucidating this appalling
  business," condescended the professor sonorously. "Let me put you in
  possession of the facts&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps if we went into your room," suggested Carrados to the manager,
  "we should be less liable to interruption."</p>

  <p>"Quite so; quite so," boomed the professor, accepting the proposal on
  everyone else's behalf. "The facts, sir, are these: I am the unfortunate
  possessor of a safe here, in which, a few months ago, I deposited&mdash;among
  less important matter&mdash;sixty bearer bonds of the Japanese Imperial
  Loan&mdash;the bulk of my small fortune&mdash;and the manuscript of an
  important projected work on 'Polyphyletic Bridal Customs among the
  mid-Pleistocene Cave Men.' To-day I came to detach the coupons which fall due
  on the fifteenth, to pay them into my bank a week in advance, in accordance
  with my custom. What do I find? I find the safe locked and apparently intact,
  as when I last saw it a month ago. But it is far from being intact, sir. It
  has been opened; ransacked, cleared out. Not a single bond; not a scrap of
  paper remains."</p>

  <p>It was obvious that the manager's temperature had been rising during the
  latter part of this speech and now he boiled over.</p>

  <p>"Pardon my flatly contradicting you, Professor Bulge. You have again
  referred to your visit here a month ago as your last. You will bear witness
  of that, gentlemen. When I inform you that the professor had access to his
  safe as recently as on Monday last you will recognize the importance that the
  statement may assume."</p>

  <p>The professor glared across the room like an infuriated animal, a
  comparison heightened by his notoriously hircine appearance.</p>

  <p>"How dare you contradict me, sir!" he cried, slapping the table sharply
  with his open hand. "I was not here on Monday."</p>

  <p>The manager shrugged his shoulders coldly.</p>

  <p>"You forget that the attendants also saw you," he remarked. "Cannot we
  trust our own eyes?"</p>

  <p>"A common assumption, yet not always a strictly reliable one," insinuated
  Carrados softly.</p>

  <p>"I cannot be mistaken."</p>

  <p>"Then can you tell me, without looking, what colour Professor Bulge's eyes
  are?"</p>

  <p>There was a curious and expectant silence for a minute. The professor
  turned his back on the manager and the manager passed from thoughtfulness to
  embarrassment.</p>

  <p>"I really do not know, Mr Carrados," he declared loftily at last. "I do
  not refer to mere trifles like that."</p>

  <p>"Then you can be mistaken," replied Carrados mildly yet with decision.</p>

  <p>"But the ample hair, the venerable flowing beard, the prominent nose and
  heavy eyebrows&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"These are just the striking points that are most easily counterfeited.
  They 'take the eye.' If you would ensure yourself against deception, learn
  rather to observe the eye itself, and particularly the spots on it, the shape
  of the fingernails, the set of the ears. These things cannot be
  simulated."</p>

  <p>"You seriously suggest that the man was not Professor Bulge&mdash;that he
  was an impostor?"</p>

  <p>"The conclusion is inevitable. Where were you on Monday, Professor?"</p>

  <p>"I was on a short lecturing tour in the Midlands. On Saturday I was in
  Nottingham. On Monday in Birmingham. I did not return to London until
  yesterday."</p>

  <p>Carrados turned to the manager again and indicated Draycott, who so far
  had remained in the background.</p>

  <p>"And this gentleman? Did he by any chance come here on Monday?"</p>

  <p>"He did not, Mr Carrados. But I gave him access to his safe on Tuesday
  afternoon and again yesterday."</p>

  <p>Draycott shook his head sadly.</p>

  <p>"Yesterday I found it empty," he said. "And all Tuesday afternoon I was at
  Brighton, trying to see a gentleman on business."</p>

  <p>The manager sat down very suddenly.</p>

  <p>"Good God, another!" he exclaimed faintly.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid the list is only beginning," said Carrados. "We must go
  through your renters' book."</p>

  <p>The manager roused himself to protest.</p>

  <p>"That cannot be done. No one but myself or my deputy ever sees the book.
  It would be&mdash;unprecedented."</p>

  <p>"The circumstances are unprecedented," replied Carrados.</p>

  <p>"If any difficulties are placed in the way of these gentlemen's
  investigations, I shall make it my duty to bring the facts before the Home
  Secretary," announced the professor; speaking up to the ceiling with the
  voice of a brazen trumpet.</p>

  <p>Carrados raised a deprecating hand.</p>

  <p>"May I make a suggestion?" he remarked. "Now; I am blind. If,
  therefore&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"Very well," acquiesced the manager. "But I must request the others to
  withdraw."</p>

  <p>For five minutes Carrados followed the list of safe-renters as the manager
  read them to him. Sometimes he stopped the catalogue to reflect a moment; now
  and then he brushed a finger-tip over a written signature and compared it
  with another. Occasionally a password interested him. But when the list came
  to an end he continued to look into space without any sign of
  enlightenment.</p>

  <p>"So much is perfectly clear and yet so much is incredible," he mused. "You
  insist that you alone have been in charge for the last six months?"</p>

  <p>"I have not been away a day this year."</p>

  <p>"Meals?"</p>

  <p>"I have my lunch sent in."</p>

  <p>"And this room could not be entered without your knowledge while you were
  about the place?"</p>

  <p>"It is impossible. The door is fitted with a powerful spring and a
  feather-touch self-acting lock. It cannot be left unlocked unless you
  deliberately prop it open."</p>

  <p>"And, with your knowledge, no one has had an opportunity of having access
  to this book?"</p>

  <p>"No," was the reply.</p>

  <p>Carrados stood up and began to put on his gloves.</p>

  <p>"Then I must decline to pursue my investigation any further," he said
  icily.</p>

  <p>"Why?" stammered the manager.</p>

  <p>"Because I have positive reason for believing that you are deceiving
  me."</p>

  <p>"Pray sit down, Mr Carrados. It is quite true that when you put the last
  question to me a circumstance rushed into my mind which&mdash;so far as the
  strict letter was concerned&mdash;might seem to demand 'Yes' instead of 'No.'
  But not in the spirit of your inquiry. It would be absurd to attach any
  importance to the incident I refer to."</p>

  <p>"That would be for me to judge."</p>

  <p>"You shall do so, Mr Carrados. I live at Windermere Mansions with my
  sister. A few months ago she got to know a married couple who had recently
  come to the opposite flat. The husband was a middle-aged, scholarly man who
  spent most of his time in the British Museum. His wife's tastes were
  different; she was much younger, brighter, gayer; a mere girl in fact, one of
  the most charming and unaffected I have ever met. My sister Amelia does not
  readily&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Stop!" exclaimed Carrados. "A studious middle-aged man and a charming
  young wife! Be as brief as possible. If there is any chance it may turn on a
  matter of minutes at the ports. She came here, of course?"</p>

  <p>"Accompanied by her husband," replied the manager stiffly. "Mrs Scott had
  travelled and she had a hobby of taking photographs wherever she went. When
  my position accidentally came out one evening she was carried away by the
  novel idea of adding views of a safe-deposit to her collection&mdash;as
  enthusiastic as a child. There was no reason why she should not; the place
  has often been taken for advertising purposes."</p>

  <p>"She came, and brought her camera&mdash;under your very nose!"</p>

  <p>"I do not know what you mean by 'under my very nose.' She came with her
  husband one evening just about our closing time. She brought her camera, of
  course&mdash;quite a small affair."</p>

  <p>"And contrived to be in here alone?"</p>

  <p>"I take exception to the word 'contrived.' It&mdash;it happened. I sent
  out for some tea, and in the course&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"How long was she alone in here?"</p>

  <p>"Two or three minutes at the most. When I returned she was seated at my
  desk. That was what I referred to. The little rogue had put on my glasses and
  had got hold of a big book. We were great chums, and she delighted to mock
  me. I confess that I was startled&mdash;merely instinctively&mdash;to see
  that she had taken up this book, but the next moment I saw that she had it
  upside down."</p>

  <p>"Clever! She couldn't get it away in time. And the camera, with
  half-a-dozen of its specially sensitized films already snapped over the last
  few pages, by her side!"</p>

  <p>"That child!"</p>

  <p>"Yes. She is twenty-seven and has kicked hats off tall men's heads in
  every capital from Petersburg to Buenos Aires! Get through to Scotland Yard
  and ask if Inspector Beedel can come up."</p>

  <p>The manager breathed heavily through his nose.</p>

  <p>"To call in the police and publish everything would ruin this
  establishment&mdash;confidence would be gone. I cannot do it without further
  authority."</p>

  <p>"Then the professor certainly will."</p>

  <p>"Before you came I rang up the only director who is at present in town and
  gave him the facts as they then stood. Possibly he has arrived by this. If
  you will accompany me to the boardroom we will see."</p>

  <p>They went up to the floor above, Mr Carlyle joining them on the way.</p>

  <p>"Excuse me a moment," said the manager.</p>

  <p>Parkinson, who had been having an improving conversation with the hall
  porter on the subject of land values, approached.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry, sir," he reported, "but I was unable to procure any 'Rubbo.'
  The place appears to be shut up."</p>

  <p>"That is a pity; Mr Carlyle had set his heart on it."</p>

  <p>"Will you come this way, please?" said the manager, reappearing.</p>

  <p>In the boardroom they found a white-haired old gentleman who had obeyed
  the manager's behest from a sense of duty, and then remained in a distant
  corner of the empty room in the hope that he might be overlooked. He was
  amiably helpless and appeared to be deeply aware of it.</p>

  <p>"This is a very sad business, gentlemen," he said, in a whispering,
  confiding voice. "I am informed that you recommend calling in the Scotland
  Yard authorities. That would be a disastrous course for an institution that
  depends on the implicit confidence of the public."</p>

  <p>"It is the only course," replied Carrados.</p>

  <p>"The name of Mr Carrados is well known to us in connexion with a delicate
  case. Could you not carry this one through?"</p>

  <p>"It is impossible. A wide inquiry must be made. Every port will have to be
  watched. The police alone can do that." He threw a little significance into
  the next sentence. "I alone can put the police in the right way of doing
  it."</p>

  <p>"And you will do that, Mr Carrados?"</p>

  <p>Carrados smiled engagingly. He knew exactly what constituted the great
  attraction of his services.</p>

  <p>"My position is this," he explained. "So far my work has been entirely
  amateur. In that capacity I have averted one or two crimes, remedied an
  occasional injustice, and now and then been of service to my professional
  friend, Louis Carlyle. But there is no reason at all why I should serve a
  commercial firm in an ordinary affair of business for nothing. For any
  information I should require a fee, a quite nominal fee of, say, one hundred
  pounds."</p>

  <p>The director looked as though his faith in human nature had received a
  rude blow.</p>

  <p>"A hundred pounds would be a very large initial fee for a small firm like
  this, Mr Carrados," he remarked in a pained voice.</p>

  <p>"And that, of course, would be independent of Mr Carlyle's professional
  charges," added Carrados.</p>

  <p>"Is that sum contingent on any specific performance?" inquired the
  manager.</p>

  <p>"I do not mind making it conditional on my procuring for you, for the
  police to act on, a photograph and a description of the thief."</p>

  <p>The two officials conferred apart for a moment. Then the manager
  returned.</p>

  <p>"We will agree, Mr Carrados, on the understanding that these things are to
  be in our hands within two days. Failing that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No, no!" cried Mr Carlyle indignantly, but Carrados good-humouredly put
  him aside.</p>

  <p>"I will accept the condition in the same sporting spirit that inspires it.
  Within forty-eight hours or no pay. The cheque, of course, to be given
  immediately the goods are delivered?"</p>

  <p>"You may rely on that."</p>

  <p>Carrados took out his pocket-book, produced an envelope bearing an
  American stamp, and from it extracted an unmounted print.</p>

  <p>"Here is the photograph," he announced. "The man is called Ulysses K.
  Groom, but he is better known as 'Harry the Actor.' You will find the
  description written on the back."</p>

  <p>Five minutes later, when they were alone, Mr Carlyle expressed his opinion
  of the transaction.</p>

  <p>"You are an unmitigated humbug, Max," he said, "though an amiable one, I
  admit. But purely for your own private amusement you spring these things on
  people."</p>

  <p>"On the contrary," replied Carrados, "people spring these things on
  me."</p>

  <p>"Now this photograph. Why have I heard nothing of it before?"</p>

  <p>Carrados took out his watch and touched the fingers.</p>

  <p>"It is now three minutes to eleven. I received the photograph at twenty
  past eight."</p>

  <p>"Even then, an hour ago you assured me that you had done nothing."</p>

  <p>"Nor had I&mdash;so far as result went. Until the keystone of the edifice
  was wrung from the manager in his room, I was as far away from demonstrable
  certainty as ever."</p>

  <p>"So am I&mdash;as yet," hinted Mr Carlyle.</p>

  <p>"I am coming to that, Louis. I turn over the whole thing to you. The man
  has got two clear days' start and the chances are nine to one against
  catching him. We know everything, and the case has no further interest for
  me. But it is your business. Here is your material.</p>

  <p>"On that one occasion when the 'tawny' man crossed our path, I took from
  the first a rather more serious view of his scope and intention than you did.
  That same day I sent a cipher cable to Pierson of the New York service. I
  asked for news of any man of such and such a description&mdash;merely
  negative&mdash;who was known to have left the States; an educated man, expert
  in the use of disguises, audacious in his operations, and a specialist in
  'dry' work among banks and strong-rooms."</p>

  <p>"Why the States, Max?"</p>

  <p>"That was a sighting shot on my part. I argued that he must be an
  English-speaking man. The smart and inventive turn of the modern Yank has
  made him a specialist in ingenious devices, straight or crooked. Unpickable
  locks and invincible lock-pickers, burglar-proof safes and safe-specializing
  burglars, come equally from the States. So I tried a very simple test. As we
  talked that day and the man walked past us, I dropped the words 'New
  York'&mdash;or, rather, 'Noo Y'rk'&mdash;in his hearing."</p>

  <p>"I know you did. He neither turned nor stopped."</p>

  <p>"He was that much on his guard; but into his step there came&mdash;though
  your poor old eyes could not see it, Louis&mdash;the 'psychological pause,'
  an absolute arrest of perhaps a fifth of a second; just as it would have done
  with you if the word 'London' had fallen on your ear in a distant land.
  However, the whys and the wherefores don't matter. Here is the essential
  story.</p>

  <p>"Eighteen months ago 'Harry the Actor' successfully looted the office safe
  of M'Kenkie, J. F. Higgs &amp; Co.; of Cleveland, Ohio. He had just married a
  smart but very facile third-rate vaudeville actress&mdash;English by
  origin&mdash;and wanted money for the honeymoon. He got about five hundred
  pounds, and with that they came to Europe and stayed in London for some
  months. That period is marked by the Congreave Square post office burglary,
  you may remember. While studying such of the British institutions as most
  appealed to him, the 'Actor's' attention became fixed on this safe-deposit.
  Possibly the implied challenge contained in its telegraphic address grew on
  him until it became a point of professional honour with him to despoil it; at
  all events he was presumedly attracted by an undertaking that promised not
  only glory but very solid profit. The first part of the plot was, to the most
  skilful criminal 'impersonator' in the States, mere skittles. Spreading over
  those months he appeared at 'The Safe' in twelve different characters and
  rented twelve safes of different sizes. At the same time he made a thorough
  study of the methods of the place. As soon as possible he got the keys back
  again into legitimate use, having made duplicates for his own private ends,
  of course. Five he seems to have returned during his first stay; one was
  received later, with profuse apologies, by registered post; one was returned
  through a leading Berlin bank. Six months ago he made a flying visit here,
  purely to work off two more. One he kept from first to last, and the
  remaining couple he got in at the beginning of his second long residence
  here, three or four months ago.</p>

  <p>"This brings us to the serious part of the cool enterprise. He had funds
  from the Atlantic and South-Central Mail-car coup when he arrived here last
  April. He appears to have set up three establishments; a home, in the guise
  of an elderly scholar with a young wife, which, of course, was next door to
  our friend the manager; an observation point, over which he plastered the
  inscription 'Rub in Rubbo for Everything' as a reason for being; and,
  somewhere else, a dressing-room with essential conditions of two doors into
  different streets.</p>

  <p>"About six weeks ago he entered the last stage. Mrs Harry, with quite
  ridiculous ease, got photographs of the necessary page or two of the
  record-book. I don't doubt that for weeks before then everyone who entered
  the place had been observed, but the photographs linked them up with the
  actual men into whose hands the 'Actor's' old keys had passed&mdash;gave
  their names and addresses, the numbers of their safes, their passwords and
  signatures. The rest was easy."</p>

  <p>"Yes, by Jupiter; mere play for a man like that," agreed Mr Carlyle, with
  professional admiration. "He could contrive a dozen different occasions for
  studying the voice and manner and appearance of his victims. How much has he
  cleared?"</p>

  <p>"We can only speculate as yet. I have put my hand on seven doubtful
  callers on Monday and Tuesday last. Two others he had ignored for some
  reason; the remaining two safes had not been allotted. There is one point
  that raises an interesting speculation."</p>

  <p>"What is that, Max?"</p>

  <p>"The 'Actor' has one associate, a man known as 'Billy the Fondant,' but
  beyond that&mdash;with the exception of his wife, of course&mdash;he does not
  usually trust anyone. It is plain, however, that at least seven men must
  latterly have been kept under close observation. It has occurred to
  me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Max?"</p>

  <p>"I have wondered whether Harry has enlisted the innocent services of one
  or other of our clever private inquiry offices."</p>

  <p>"Scarcely," smiled the professional. "It would hardly pass muster."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I don't know. Mrs Harry, in the character of a jealous wife or a
  suspicious sweetheart, might reasonably&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Mr Carlyle's smile suddenly faded.</p>

  <p>"By Jupiter!" he exclaimed. "I remember&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Louis?" prompted Carrados, with laughter in his voice.</p>

  <p>"I remember that I must telephone to a client before Beedel comes,"
  concluded Mr Carlyle, rising in some haste.</p>

  <p>At the door he almost ran into the subdued director, who was wringing his
  hands in helpless protest at a new stroke of calamity.</p>

  <p>"Mr Carrados," wailed the poor old gentleman in a tremulous bleat, "Mr
  Carrados, there is another now&mdash;Sir Benjamin Gump. He insists on seeing
  me. You will not&mdash;you will not desert us?"</p>

  <p>"I should have to stay a week," replied Carrados briskly, "and I'm just
  off now. There will be a procession. Mr Carlyle will support you, I am
  sure."</p>

  <p>He nodded "Good-morning" straight into the eyes of each and found his way
  out with the astonishing certainty of movement that made so many forget his
  infirmity. Possibly he was not desirous of encountering Draycott's
  embarrassed gratitude again, for in less than a minute they heard the swirl
  of his departing car.</p>

  <p>"Never mind, my dear sir," Mr Carlyle assured his client, with
  impenetrable complacency. "Never mind. <i>I</i> will remain instead. Perhaps
  I had better make myself known to Sir Benjamin at once."</p>

  <p>The director turned on him the pleading, trustful look of a cornered
  dormouse.</p>

  <p>"He is in the basement," he whispered. "I shall be in the
  boardroom&mdash;if necessary."</p>

  <p>Mr Carlyle had no difficulty in discovering the centre of interest in the
  basement. Sir Benjamin was expansive and reserved, bewildered and decisive,
  long-winded and short-tempered, each in turn and more or less all at once. He
  had already demanded the attention of the manager, Professor Bulge, Draycott
  and two underlings to his case and they were now involved in a babel of
  inutile reiteration. The inquiry agent was at once drawn into a circle of
  interrogation that he did his best to satisfy impressively while himself
  learning the new facts.</p>

  <p>The latest development was sufficiently astonishing. Less than an hour
  before Sir Benjamin had received a parcel by district messenger. It contained
  a jewel-case which ought at that moment to have been securely reposing in one
  of the deposit safes. Hastily snatching it open, the recipient's incredible
  forebodings were realized. It was empty&mdash;empty of jewels, that is to
  say, for, as if to add a sting to the blow, a neatly inscribed card had been
  placed inside, and on it the agitated baronet read the appropriate but at the
  moment rather gratuitous maxim: "Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon
  earth&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The card was passed round and all eyes demanded the expert's
  pronouncement.</p>

  <p>"'&mdash;where moth and rust doth corrupt and where thieves break through
  and steal.' H'm," read Mr Carlyle with weight. "This is a most important
  clue, Sir Benjamin&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Hey, what? What's that?" exclaimed a voice from the other side of the
  hall. "Why, damme if I don't believe you've got another! Look at that,
  gentlemen; look at that. What's on, I say? Here now, come; give me my safe. I
  want to know where I am."</p>

  <p>It was the bookmaker who strode tempestuously in among them, flourishing
  before their faces a replica of the card that was in Mr Carlyle's hand.</p>

  <p>"Well, upon my soul this is most extraordinary," exclaimed that gentleman,
  comparing the two. "You have just received this, Mr&mdash;Mr Berge, isn't
  it?"</p>

  <p>"That's right, Berge&mdash;'Iceberg' on the course. Thank the Lord Harry,
  I can take my losses coolly enough, but this&mdash;this is a facer. Put into
  my hand half-an-hour ago inside an envelope that ought to be here and as safe
  as in the Bank of England. What's the game, I say? Here, Johnny, hurry and
  let me into my safe."</p>

  <p>Discipline and method had for the moment gone by the board. There was no
  suggestion of the boasted safeguards of the establishment. The manager added
  his voice to that of the client, and when the attendant did not at once
  appear he called again.</p>

  <p>"John, come and give Mr Berge access to his safe at once."</p>

  <p>"All right, sir," pleaded the harassed key-attendant; hurrying up with the
  burden of his own distraction. "There's a silly fathead got in what thinks
  this is a left-luggage office, so far as I can make out&mdash;a
  foreigner."</p>

  <p>"Never mind that now," replied the manager severely. "Mr Berge's safe: No.
  01724."</p>

  <p>The attendant and Mr Berge went off together down one of the brilliant
  colonnaded vistas. One or two of the others who had caught the words glanced
  across and became aware of a strange figure that was drifting indecisively
  towards them. He was obviously an elderly German tourist of pronounced
  type&mdash;long-haired, spectacled, outrageously garbed and involved in the
  mental abstraction of his philosophical race. One hand was occupied with the
  manipulation of a pipe, as markedly Teutonic as its owner; the other grasped
  a carpet-bag that would have ensured an opening laugh to any low
  comedian.</p>

  <p>Quite impervious to the preoccupation of the group, the German made his
  way up to them and picked out the manager.</p>

  <p>"This was a safety deposit, <i>nicht wahr</i>?"</p>

  <p>"Quite so," acquiesced the manager loftily, "but just
  now&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Your fellow was dense of gomprehension." The eyes behind the clumsy
  glasses wrinkled to a ponderous humour. "He forgot his own business. Now this
  goot bag&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Brought into fuller prominence, the carpet-bag revealed further details of
  its overburdened proportions. At one end a flannel shirt cuff protruded in
  limp dejection; at the other an ancient collar, with the grotesque attachment
  known as a "dickey," asserted its presence. No wonder the manager frowned his
  annoyance. "The Safe" was in low enough repute among its patrons at that
  moment without any burlesque interlude to its tragic hour.</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes," he whispered, attempting to lead the would-be depositor away,
  "but you are under a mistake. This is not&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It was a safety deposit? Goot. Mine bag&mdash;I would deposit him in
  safety till the time of mine train. <i>Ja?</i>"</p>

  <p>"<i>Nein, nein!</i>" almost hissed the agonized official. "Go away, sir,
  go away! It isn't a cloakroom. John, let this gentleman out."</p>

  <p>The attendant and Mr Berge were returning from their quest. The inner box
  had been opened and there was no need to ask the result. The bookmaker was
  shaking his head like a baffled bull.</p>

  <p>"Gone, no effects," he shouted across the hall. "Lifted from 'The Safe,'
  by crumb!"</p>

  <p>To those who knew nothing of the method and operation of the fraud it
  seemed as if the financial security of the Capital was tottering. An amazed
  silence fell, and in it they heard the great grille door of the basement
  clang on the inopportune foreigner's departure. But, as if it was impossible
  to stand still on that morning of dire happenings, he was immediately
  succeeded by a dapper, keen-faced man in severe clerical attire who had been
  let in as the intruder passed out.</p>

  <p>"Canon Petersham!" exclaimed the professor, going forward to greet
  him.</p>

  <p>"My dear Professor Bulge!" reciprocated the canon. "You here! A most
  disquieting thing has happened to me. I must have my safe at once." He
  divided his attention between the manager and the professor as he monopolized
  them both. "A most disquieting and&mdash;and outrageous circumstance. My
  safe, please&mdash;yes, yes, Rev. Henry Noakes Petersham. I have just
  received by hand a box, a small box of no value but one that I
  <i>thought</i>, yes, I am convinced that it was the one, a box that was used
  to contain certain valuables of family interest which should at this moment
  be in my safe here. No. 7436? Very likely, very likely. Yes, here is my key.
  But not content with the disconcerting effect of that, professor, the box
  contained&mdash;and I protest that it's a most unseemly thing to quote
  <i>any</i> text from the Bible in this way to a clergyman of my
  position&mdash;well, here it is. 'Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon
  earth&mdash;&mdash;' Why, I have a dozen sermons of my own in my desk now on
  that very verse. I'm particularly partial to the very needful lesson that it
  teaches. And to apply it to <i>me</i>! It's monstrous!"</p>

  <p>"No. 7436, John," ordered the manager, with weary resignation.</p>

  <p>The attendant again led the way towards another armour-plated aisle.
  Smartly turning a corner, he stumbled over something, bit a profane
  exclamation in two, and looked back.</p>

  <p>"It's that bloomin' foreigner's old bag again," he explained across the
  place in aggrieved apology. "He left it here after all."</p>

  <p>"Take it upstairs and throw it out when you've finished," said the manager
  shortly.</p>

  <p>"Here, wait a minute," pondered John, in absent-minded familiarity. "Wait
  a minute. This is a funny go. There's a label on that wasn't here before.
  '<i>Why not look inside?</i>'"</p>

  <p>"'Why not look inside?'" repeated someone.</p>

  <p>"That's what it says."</p>

  <p>There was another puzzled silence. All were arrested by some intangible
  suggestion of a deeper mystery than they had yet touched. One by one they
  began to cross the hall with the conscious air of men who were not curious
  but thought that they might as well see.</p>

  <p>"Why, curse my crumpet," suddenly exploded Mr Berge, "if that ain't the
  same writing as these texts!"</p>

  <p>"By gad, but I believe you are right," assented Mr Carlyle. "Well, why not
  look inside?"</p>

  <p>The attendant, from his stooping posture, took the verdict of the ring of
  faces and in a trice tugged open the two buckles. The central fastening was
  not locked, and yielded to a touch. The flannel shirt, the weird collar and a
  few other garments in the nature of a "top-dressing" were flung out and
  John's hand plunged deeper....</p>

  <p>Harry the Actor had lived up to his dramatic instinct. Nothing was wrapped
  up; nay, the rich booty had been deliberately opened out and displayed, as it
  were, so that the overturning of the bag, when John the keybearer in an
  access of riotous extravagance lifted it up and strewed its contents
  broadcast on the floor, was like the looting of a smuggler's den, or the
  realization of a speculator's dream, or the bursting of an Aladdin's cave, or
  something incredibly lavish and bizarre. Bank-notes fluttered down and lay
  about in all directions, relays of sovereigns rolled away like so much dross,
  bonds and scrip for thousands and tens of thousands clogged the downpouring
  stream of jewellery and unset gems. A yellow stone the size of a four-pound
  weight and twice as heavy dropped plump upon the canon's toes and sent him
  hopping and grimacing to the wall. A ruby-hilted kris cut across the
  manager's wrist as he strove to arrest the splendid rout. Still the
  miraculous cornucopia deluged the ground, with its pattering, ringing,
  bumping, crinkling, rolling, fluttering produce until, like the final tableau
  of some spectacular ballet, it ended with a golden rain that masked the
  details of the heap beneath a glittering veil of yellow sand.</p>

  <p>"My dust!" gasped Draycott.</p>

  <p>"My fivers, by golly!" ejaculated the bookmaker, initiating a plunge among
  the spoil.</p>

  <p>"My Japanese bonds, coupons and all, and&mdash;yes, even the manuscript of
  my work on 'Polyphyletic Bridal Customs among the mid-Pleistocene Cave Men.'
  Hah!" Something approaching a cachinnation of delight closed the professor's
  contribution to the pandemonium, and eyewitnesses afterwards declared that
  for a moment the dignified scientist stood on one foot in the opening
  movement of a can-can.</p>

  <p>"My wife's diamonds, thank heaven!" cried Sir Benjamin, with the air of a
  schoolboy who was very well out of a swishing.</p>

  <p>"But what does it mean?" demanded the bewildered canon. "Here are my
  family heirlooms&mdash;a few decent pearls, my grandfather's collection of
  camei and other trifles&mdash;but who&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps this offers some explanation," suggested Mr Carlyle, unpinning an
  envelope that had been secured to the lining of the bag. "It is addressed 'To
  Seven Rich Sinners.' Shall I read it for you?"</p>

  <p>For some reason the response was not unanimous, but it was sufficient. Mr
  Carlyle cut open the envelope.</p><br>

     name="story6"></a>VI. &mdash; THE TILLING SHAW MYSTERY</h2>

  <h3>Serialised in <i>The News Of The World</i>, Oct 19-26, 1913</h3>

  <p class="first">"I will see Miss George now," assented Carrados. Parkinson
  retired and Greatorex looked round from his chair. The morning "clearing-up"
  was still in progress.</p>

  <p>"Shall I go?" he inquired.</p>

  <p>"Not unless the lady desires it. I don't know her at all."</p>

  <p>The secretary was not unobservant and he had profited from his association
  with Mr Carrados. Without more ado, he began to get his papers quietly
  together.</p>

  <p>The door opened and a girl of about twenty came eagerly yet half
  timorously into the room. Her eyes for a moment swept Carrados with an
  anxious scrutiny. Then, with a slight shade of disappointment, she noticed
  that they were not alone.</p>

  <p>"I have come direct from Oakshire to see you, Mr Carrados," she announced,
  in a quick, nervous voice that was evidently the outcome of a desperate
  resolution to be brave and explicit. "The matter is a dreadfully important
  one to me and I should very much prefer to tell it to you alone."</p>

  <p>There was no need for Carrados to turn towards his secretary; that
  discriminating young gentleman was already on his way. Miss George flashed
  him a shy look of thanks and filled in the moment with a timid survey of the
  room.</p>

  <p>"Is it something that you think I can help you with?"</p>

  <p>"I had hoped so. I had heard in a roundabout way of your wonderful
  power&mdash;ought I to tell you how&mdash;does it matter?"</p>

  <p>"Not in the least if it has nothing to do with the case," replied
  Carrados.</p>

  <p>"When this dreadful thing happened I instinctively thought of you. I felt
  sure that I ought to come and get you to help me at once. But I&mdash;I have
  very little money, Mr Carrados, only a few pounds, and I am not so childish
  as not to know that very clever men require large fees. Then when I got here
  my heart sank, for I saw at once from your house and position that what
  seemed little even to me would be ridiculous to you&mdash;that if you did
  help me it would be purely out of kindness of heart and generosity."</p>

  <p>"Suppose you tell me what the circumstances are," suggested Carrados
  cautiously. Then, to afford an opening, he added: "You have recently gone
  into mourning, I see."</p>

  <p>"See!" exclaimed the girl almost sharply. "Then you are not blind?"</p>

  <p>"Oh yes," he replied; "only I use the familiar expression, partly from
  custom, partly because it sounds unnecessarily pedantic to say, 'I deduce
  from certain observations.'"</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon. I suppose I was startled not so much by the expression
  as by your knowledge. I ought to have been prepared. But I am already wasting
  your time and I came so determined to be business-like. I got a copy of the
  local paper on the way, because I thought that the account in it would be
  clearer to you than I could tell it. Shall I read it?"</p>

  <p>"Please; if that was your intention."</p>

  <p>"It is <i>The Stinbridge Herald</i>," explained the girl, taking a closely
  folded newspaper from the handbag which she carried. "Stinbridge is our
  nearest town&mdash;about six miles from Tilling Shaw, where we live. This is
  the account:</p><br>

  <p class="headline">"'MYSTERIOUS TRAGEDY AT TILLING<br>
  "'WELL-KNOWN AGRICULTURALIST ATTEMPTS MURDER AND COMMITS SUICIDE'</p>

  <p class="quote">"'The districts of Great Tilling, Tilling Shaw and the
  immediate neighbourhood were thrown into a state of unusual excitement on
  Thursday last by the report of a tragedy in their midst such as has rarely
  marked the annals of our law-abiding country-side.</p>

  <p class="quote">"'A <i>Herald</i> representative was early on the scene, and
  his inquiries elucidated the fact that it was only too true that in this case
  rumour had not exaggerated the circumstances, rather the reverse indeed.</p>

  <p class="quote">"'On the afternoon of the day in question, Mr Frank
  Whitmarsh, of High Barn, presented himself at Barony, the residence of his
  uncle, Mr William Whitmarsh, with the intention of seeing him in reference to
  a dispute that was pending between them. This is understood to be connected
  with an alleged trespass in pursuit of game, each relative claiming exclusive
  sporting rights over a piece of water known as Hunstan Mere.</p>

  <p class="quote">"'On this occasion the elder gentleman was not at home and
  Mr Frank Whitmarsh, after waiting for some time, departed, leaving a message
  to the effect that he would return, and, according to one report, "have it
  out with Uncle William," later in the evening.</p>

  <p class="quote">"'This resolution he unfortunately kept. Returning about
  eight-forty-five P.M. he found his uncle in and for some time the two men
  remained together in the dining-room. What actually passed between them has
  not yet transpired, but it is said that for half-an-hour there had been
  nothing to indicate to the other occupants of the house that anything unusual
  was in progress when suddenly two shots rang out in rapid succession. Mrs
  Lawrence, the housekeeper at Barony, and a servant were the soonest on the
  spot, and, conquering the natural terror that for a moment held them outside
  the now silent room, they summoned up courage to throw open the door and to
  enter. The first thing that met their eyes was the body of Mr Frank Whitmarsh
  lying on the floor almost at their feet. In their distressed state it was
  immediately assumed by the horrified women that he was dead, or at least
  seriously wounded, but a closer examination revealed the fact that the
  gentleman had experienced an almost miraculous escape. At the time of the
  tragedy he was wearing a large old-fashioned silver watch; and in this the
  bullet intended for his heart was found, literally embedded deep in the
  works. The second shot had, however, effected its purpose, for at the other
  side of the room, still seated at the table, was Mr William Whitmarsh,
  already quite dead, with a terrible wound in his head and the weapon, a
  large-bore revolver of obsolete pattern, lying at his feet.</p>

  <p class="quote">"'Mr Frank Whitmarsh subsequently explained that the shock
  of the attack, and the dreadful appearance presented by his uncle when,
  immediately afterwards, he turned his hand against himself, must have caused
  him to faint.</p>

  <p class="quote">"'Readers of <i>The Herald</i> will join in our expression
  of sympathy for all members of the Whitmarsh family, and in our
  congratulations to Mr Frank Whitmarsh on his providential escape.</p>

  <p class="quote">"'The inquest is fixed for Monday and it is anticipated that
  the funeral will take place on the following day.'"</p>

  <p>"That is all," concluded Miss George.</p>

  <p>"All that is in the paper," amended Carrados.</p>

  <p>"It is the same everywhere&mdash;'attempted murder and suicide'&mdash;that
  is what everyone accepts as a matter of course," went on the girl quickly.
  "How do they know that my father tried to kill Frank, or that he killed
  himself? How can they know, Mr Carrados?"</p>

  <p>"Your father, Miss George?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. My name is Madeline Whitmarsh. At home everyone looks at me as if I
  was an object of mingled pity and reproach. I thought that they might know
  the name here, so I gave the first that came into my head. I think it is a
  street I was directed along. Besides, I don't want it to be known that I came
  to see you in any case."</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>Much of the girl's conscious nervousness had stiffened into an attitude of
  unconscious hardness. Grief takes many forms, and whatever she had been
  before, the tragic episode had left Miss Whitmarsh a little hurt and
  cynical.</p>

  <p>"You are a man living in a town and can do as you like. I am a girl living
  in the country and have therefore to do largely as my neighbours like. For me
  to set up my opinion against popular feeling would constitute no small
  offence; to question its justice would be held to be adding outrageous insult
  to enormous injury."</p>

  <p>"So far I am unable to go beyond the newspaper account. On the face of it,
  your father&mdash;with what provocation of course I do not know&mdash;did
  attempt this Mr Frank Whitmarsh's life and then take his own. You imply
  another version. What reason have you?"</p>

  <p>"That is the terrible part of it," exclaimed the girl, with rising
  distress. "It was that which made me so afraid of coming to you, although I
  felt that I must, for I dreaded that when you asked me for proofs and I could
  give you none you would refuse to help me. We were not even in time to hear
  him speak, and yet I know, <i>know</i> with absolute conviction, that my
  father would not have done this. There are things that you cannot explain, Mr
  Carrados, and&mdash;well, there is an end of it."</p>

  <p>Her voice sank to an absent-minded whisper.</p>

  <p>"Everyone will condemn him now that he cannot defend himself, and yet he
  could not even have had the revolver that was found at his feet."</p>

  <p>"What is that?" demanded Carrados sharply. "Do you mean that?"</p>

  <p>"Mean what?" she asked, with the blankness of one who has lost the thread
  of her own thoughts.</p>

  <p>"What you said about the revolver&mdash;that your father could not have
  had it?"</p>

  <p>"The revolver?" she repeated half wearily; "oh yes. It was a heavy,
  old-fashioned affair. It had been lying in a drawer of his desk for more than
  ten years because once a dog came into the orchard in broad daylight light
  and worried half-a-dozen lambs before anyone could do anything."</p>

  <p>"Yes, but why could he not have it on Thursday?"</p>

  <p>"I noticed that it was gone. After Frank had left in the afternoon I went
  into the room where he had been waiting, to finish dusting. The paper says
  the dining-room, but it was really papa's business-room and no one else used
  it. Then when I was dusting the desk I saw that the revolver was no longer
  there."</p>

  <p>"You had occasion to open the drawer?"</p>

  <p>"It is really a very old bureau and none of the drawers fit closely. Dust
  lies on the ledges and you always have to open them a little to dust
  properly. They were never kept locked."</p>

  <p>"Possibly your father had taken the revolver with him."</p>

  <p>"No. I had seen it there after he had gone. He rode to Stinbridge
  immediately after lunch and did not return until nearly eight. After he left
  I went to dust his room. It was then that I saw it. I was doing the desk when
  Frank knocked and interrupted me. That is how I came to be there twice."</p>

  <p>"But you said that you had no proof, Miss Whitmarsh," Carrados reminded
  her, with deep seriousness. "Do you not recognize the importance&mdash;the
  deadly importance&mdash;that this one shred of evidence may assume?"</p>

  <p>"Does it?" she replied simply. "I am afraid that I am rather dull just
  now. All yesterday I was absolutely dazed; I could not do the most ordinary
  things. I found myself looking at the clock for minutes together, yet
  absolutely incapable of grasping what time it was. In the same way I know
  that it struck me as being funny about the revolver but I always had to give
  it up. It was as though everything was there but things would not fit
  in."</p>

  <p>"You are sure, absolutely sure, that you saw the revolver there after your
  father had left, and missed it before he returned?"</p>

  <p>"Oh yes," said the girl quickly; "I remember realizing how curious it was
  at the time. Besides there is something else. I so often had things to ask
  papa about when he was out of the house that I got into the way of making
  little notes to remind me later. This morning I found on my dressing-table
  one that I had written on Thursday afternoon."</p>

  <p>"About this weapon?"</p>

  <p>"Yes; to ask him what could have become of it."</p>

  <p>Carrados made a further inquiry, and this was Madeline Whitmarsh's account
  of affairs existing between the two branches of the family:</p>

  <p>Until the time of William Whitmarsh, father of the William Whitmarsh just
  deceased, the properties of Barony and High Barn had formed one estate,
  descending from a William senior to a William junior down a moderately long
  line of yeomen Whitmarshes. Through the influence of his second wife this
  William senior divided the property, leaving Barony with its four hundred
  acres of good land to William junior, and High Barn, with which went three
  hundred acres of poor land, to his other son, father of the Frank implicated
  in the recent tragedy. But though divided, the two farms still had one common
  link. Beneath their growing corn and varied pasturage lay, it was generally
  admitted, a seam of coal at a depth and of a thickness that would render its
  working a paying venture. Even in William the Divider's time, when the idea
  was new, money in plenty would have been forthcoming, but he would have none
  of it, and when he died his will contained a provision restraining either son
  from mining or exploiting his land for mineral without the consent and
  co-operation of the other.</p>

  <p>This restriction became a legacy of hate. The brothers were only
  half-brothers and William having suffered unforgettably at the hands of his
  step-mother had old scores to pay off. Quite comfortably prosperous on his
  own rich farm, and quite satisfied with the excellent shooting and the
  congenial life, he had not the slightest desire to increase his wealth. He
  had the old dour, peasant-like instinct to cling to the house and the land of
  his forefathers. From this position no argument moved him.</p>

  <p>In the meanwhile, on the other side of the new boundary fence, Frank
  senior was growing poorer year by year. To his periodical entreaties that
  William would agree to shafts being sunk on High Barn he received an emphatic
  "Never in my time!" The poor man argued, besought, threatened and swore; the
  prosperous one shook his head and grinned. Carrados did not need to hear the
  local saying: "Half brothers: whole haters; like the Whitmarshes," to read
  the situation.</p>

  <p>"Of course I do not really understand the business part of it," said
  Madeline, "and many people blamed poor papa, especially when Uncle Frank
  drank himself to death. But I know that it was not mere obstinacy. He loved
  the undisturbed, peaceful land just as it was, and his father had wished it
  to remain the same. Collieries would bring swarms of strange men into the
  neighbourhood, poachers and trespassers, he said. The smoke and dust would
  ruin the land for miles round and drive away the game, and in the end, if the
  work did not turn out profitable, we should all be much worse off than
  before."</p>

  <p>"Does the restriction lapse now; will Mr Frank junior be able to
  mine?"</p>

  <p>"It will now lie with Frank and my brother William, just as it did before
  with their fathers. I should expect Willie to be quite favourable. He is
  more&mdash;modern."</p>

  <p>"You have not spoken of your brother."</p>

  <p>"I have two. Bob, the younger, is in Mexico," she explained; "and Willie
  in Canada with an engineering firm. They did not get on very well with papa
  and they went away."</p>

  <p>It did not require preternatural observation to deduce that the late
  William Whitmarsh had been "a little difficult."</p>

  <p>"When Uncle Frank died, less than six months ago, Frank came back to High
  Barn from South Africa. He had been away about two years."</p>

  <p>"Possibly he did not get on well with his father?"</p>

  <p>Madeline smiled sadly.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid that no two Whitmarsh men ever did get on well together," she
  admitted.</p>

  <p>"Your father and young Frank, for instance?"</p>

  <p>"Their lands adjoin; there were always quarrels and disputes," she
  replied. "Then Frank had his father's grievance over again."</p>

  <p>"He wished to mine?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. He told me that he had had experience of coal in Natal."</p>

  <p>"There was no absolute ostracism between you then? You were to some extent
  friends?"</p>

  <p>"Scarcely." She appeared to reflect. "Acquaintances.... We met
  occasionally, of course, at people's houses."</p>

  <p>"You did not visit High Barn?"</p>

  <p>"Oh no."</p>

  <p>"But there was no particular reason why you should not?"</p>

  <p>"Why do you ask me that?" she demanded quickly, and in a tone that was
  quite incompatible with the simple inquiry. Then, recognizing the fact, she
  added, with shamefaced penitence: "I beg your pardon, Mr Carrados. I am
  afraid that my nerves have gone to pieces since Thursday. The most ordinary
  things affect me inexplicably."</p>

  <p>"That is a common experience in such circumstances," said Carrados
  reassuringly. "Where were you at the time of the tragedy?"</p>

  <p>"I was in my bedroom, which is rather high up, changing. I had driven down
  to the village, to give an order, and had just returned. Mrs Lawrence told me
  that she had been afraid there might be quarrelling, but no one would ever
  have dreamed of this, and then came a loud shot and then, after a few
  seconds, another not so loud, and we rushed to the door&mdash;she and Mary
  first&mdash;and everything was absolutely still."</p>

  <p>"A loud shot <i>and then another not so loud</i>?"</p>

  <p>"Yes; I noticed that even at the time. I happened to speak to Mrs Lawrence
  of it afterwards and then she also remembered that it had been like
  that."</p>

  <p>Afterwards Carrados often recalled with grim pleasantry that the two
  absolutely vital points in the fabric of circumstantial evidence that was to
  exonerate her father and fasten the guilt upon another had dropped from the
  girl's lips utterly by chance. But at the moment the facts themselves
  monopolized his attention.</p>

  <p>"You are not disappointed that I can tell you so little?" she asked
  timidly.</p>

  <p>"Scarcely," he replied. "A suicide who could not have had the weapon he
  dies by, a victim who is miraculously preserved by an opportune watch, and
  two shots from the same pistol that differ materially in volume, all taken
  together do not admit of disappointment."</p>

  <p>"I am very stupid," she said. "I do not seem able to follow things. But
  you will come and clear my father's name?"</p>

  <p>"I will come," he replied. "Beyond that who shall prophesy?"</p>

  <p>It had been arranged between them that the girl should return at once,
  while Carrados would travel down to Great Tilling late that same afternoon
  and put up at the local fishing inn. In the evening he would call at Barony,
  where Madeline would accept him as a distant connexion of the family. The
  arrangement was only for the benefit of the domestics and any casual visitor
  who might be present, for there was no possibility of a near relation being
  in attendance. Nor was there any appreciable danger of either his name or
  person being recognized in those parts, a consideration that seemed to have
  some weight with the girl, for, more than once, she entreated him not to
  disclose to anyone his real business there until he had arrived at a definite
  conclusion.</p>

  <p>It was nine o'clock, but still just light enough to distinguish the
  prominent features of the landscape, when Carrados, accompanied by Parkinson,
  reached Barony. The house, as described by the man-servant, was a substantial
  grey stone building, very plain, very square, very exposed to the four winds.
  It had not even a porch to break the flat surface, and here and there in the
  line of its three solid storeys a window had been built up by some frugal,
  tax-evading Whitmarsh of a hundred years ago.</p>

  <p>"Sombre enough," commented Carrados, "but the connexion between
  environment and crime is not yet capable of analysis. We get murders in
  brand-new suburban villas and the virtues, light-heartedness and
  good-fellowship, in moated granges. What should you say about it, eh,
  Parkinson?"</p>

  <p>"I should say it was damp, sir," observed Parkinson, with his wisest
  air.</p>

  <p>Madeline Whitmarsh herself opened the door. She took them down the long
  flagged hall to the dining-room, a cheerful enough apartment whatever its
  exterior might forebode.</p>

  <p>"I am glad you have come now, Mr Carrados," she said hurriedly, when the
  door was closed. "Sergeant Brewster is here from Stinbridge police station to
  make some arrangements for the inquest. It is to be held at the schools here
  on Monday. He says that he must take the revolver with him to produce. Do you
  want to see it before he goes?"</p>

  <p>"I should like to," replied Carrados.</p>

  <p>"Will you come into papa's room then? He is there."</p>

  <p>The sergeant was at the table, making notes in his pocket-book, when they
  entered. An old-fashioned revolver lay before him.</p>

  <p>"This gentleman has come a long way on hearing about poor papa," said the
  girl. "He would like to see the revolver before you take it, Mr
  Brewster."</p>

  <p>"Good-evening, sir," said Brewster. "It's a bad business that brings us
  here."</p>

  <p>Carrados "looked" round the room and returned the policeman's greeting.
  Madeline hesitated for a moment, and then, picking up the weapon, put it into
  the blind man's hand.</p>

  <p>"A bit out of date, sir," remarked Brewster, with a nod. "But in good
  order yet, I find."</p>

  <p>"An early French make, I should say; one of Lefaucheux's probably," said
  Carrados. "You have removed the cartridges?"</p>

  <p>"Why, yes," admitted the sergeant, producing a matchbox from his pocket.
  "They're pin-fire, you see, and I'm not too fond of carrying a thing like
  that loaded in my pocket as I'm riding a young horse."</p>

  <p>"Quite so," agreed Carrados, fingering the cartridges. "I wonder if you
  happened to mark the order of these in the chambers?"</p>

  <p>"That was scarcely necessary, sir. Two, together, had been fired; the
  other four had not."</p>

  <p>"I once knew a case&mdash;possibly I read of it&mdash;where a pack of
  cards lay on the floor. It was a murder case and the guilt or innocence of an
  accused man depended on the relative positions of the fifty-first and
  fifty-second cards."</p>

  <p>"I think you must have read of that, sir," replied Brewster, endeavouring
  to implicate first Miss Whitmarsh and then Parkinson in his meaning smile.
  "However, this is straightforward enough."</p>

  <p>"Then, of course, you have not thought it worth while to look for anything
  else?"</p>

  <p>"I have noted all the facts that have any bearing on the case. Were you
  referring to any particular point, sir?"</p>

  <p>"I was only wondering," suggested Carrados, with apologetic mildness,
  "whether you, or anyone, had happened to find a wad lying about
  anywhere."</p>

  <p>The sergeant stroked his well-kept moustache to hide the smile that
  insisted, however, on escaping through his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Scarcely, sir," he replied, with fine irony. "Bulleted revolver
  cartridges contain no wad. You are thinking of a shot-gun, sir."</p>

  <p>"Oh," said Carrados, bending over the spent cartridge he was examining,
  "that settles it, of course."</p>

  <p>"I think so, sir," assented the sergeant, courteously but with a quiet
  enjoyment of the situation. "Well, miss, I'll be getting back now. I think I
  have everything I want."</p>

  <p>"You will excuse me a few minutes?" said Miss Whitmarsh, and the two
  callers were left alone.</p>

  <p>"Parkinson," said Carrados softly, as the door closed, "look round on the
  floor. There is no wad lying within sight?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir."</p>

  <p>"Then take the lamp and look behind things. But if you find one don't
  disturb it."</p>

  <p>For a minute strange and gigantic shadows chased one another across the
  ceiling as Parkinson moved the table-lamp to and fro behind the furniture.
  The man to whom blazing sunlight and the deepest shade were as one sat with
  his eyes fixed tranquilly on the unseen wall before him.</p>

  <p>"There is a little pellet of paper here behind the couch, sir," announced
  Parkinson.</p>

  <p>"Then put the lamp back."</p>

  <p>Together they drew the cumbrous old piece of furniture from the wall and
  Carrados went behind. On hands and knees, with his face almost to the floor,
  he appeared to be studying even the dust that lay there. Then with a light,
  unerring touch he carefully picked up the thing that Parkinson had found.
  Very gently he unrolled it, using his long, delicate fingers so skilfully
  that even at the end the particles of dust still clung here and there to the
  surface of the paper.</p>

  <p>"What do you make of it, Parkinson?"</p>

  <p>Parkinson submitted it to the judgment of a single sense.</p>

  <p>"A cigarette-paper to all appearance, sir. I can't say it's a kind that
  I've had experience of. It doesn't seem to have any distinct watermark but
  there is a half-inch of glossy paper along one edge."</p>

  <p>"Amber-tipped. Yes?"</p>

  <p>"Another edge is a little uneven; it appears to have been cut."</p>

  <p>"This edge opposite the mouthpiece. Yes, yes."</p>

  <p>"Patches are blackened, and little holes&mdash;like pinpricks&mdash;burned
  through. In places it is scorched brown."</p>

  <p>"Anything else?"</p>

  <p>"I hope there is nothing I have failed to observe, sir," said Parkinson,
  after a pause.</p>

  <p>Carrados's reply was a strangely irrelevant question.</p>

  <p>"What is the ceiling made of?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"Oak boards, sir, with a heavy cross-beam."</p>

  <p>"Are there any plaster figures about the room?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir."</p>

  <p>"Or anything at all that is whitewashed?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing, sir."</p>

  <p>Carrados raised the scrap of tissue paper to his nose again, and for the
  second time he touched it with his tongue.</p>

  <p>"Very interesting, Parkinson," he remarked, and Parkinson's responsive
  "Yes, sir" was a model of discreet acquiescence.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry that I had to leave you," said Miss Whitmarsh, returning, "but
  Mrs Lawrence is out and my father made a practice of offering everyone
  refreshment."</p>

  <p>"Don't mention it," said Carrados. "We have not been idle. I came from
  London to pick up a scrap of paper, lying on the floor of this room. Well,
  here it is." He rolled the tissue into a pellet again and held it before her
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"The wad!" she exclaimed eagerly. "Oh, that proves that I was right?"</p>

  <p>"Scarcely 'proves,' Miss Whitmarsh."</p>

  <p>"But it shows that one of the shots was a blank charge, as you suggested
  this morning might have been the case."</p>

  <p>"Hardly even that."</p>

  <p>"What then?" she demanded, with her large dark eyes fixed in a curious
  fascination on his inscrutable face.</p>

  <p>"That behind the couch we have found this scrap of powder-singed
  paper."</p>

  <p>There was a moment's silence. The girl turned away her head.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid that I am a little disappointed," she murmured.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps better now than later. I wished to warn you that we must prove
  every inch of ground. Does your cousin Frank smoke cigarettes?"</p>

  <p>"I cannot say, Mr Carrados. You see ... I knew so little of him."</p>

  <p>"Quite so; there was just the chance. And your father?"</p>

  <p>"He never did. He despised them."</p>

  <p>"That is all I need ask you now. What time to-morrow shall I find you in,
  Miss Whitmarsh? It is Sunday, you remember."</p>

  <p>"At any time. The curiosity I inspire doesn't tempt me to encounter my
  friends, I can assure you," she replied, her face hardening at the
  recollection. "But ... Mr Carrados&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes?"</p>

  <p>"The inquest is on Monday afternoon.... I had a sort of desperate faith
  that you would be able to vindicate papa."</p>

  <p>"By the time of the inquest, you mean?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Otherwise&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"The verdict of a coroner's jury means nothing, Miss Whitmarsh. It is the
  merest formality."</p>

  <p>"It means a very great deal to me. It haunts and oppresses me. If they
  say&mdash;if it goes out&mdash;that papa is guilty of the attempt of murder,
  and of suicide, I shall never raise my head again."</p>

  <p>Carrados had no desire to prolong a futile discussion.</p>

  <p>"Good-night," he said, holding out his hand.</p>

  <p>"Good-night, Mr Carrados." She detained him a moment, her voice vibrant
  with quiet feeling. "I already owe you more than I can ever hope to express.
  Your wonderful kindness&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"A strange case," moralized Carrados, as they walked out of the
  quadrangular yard into the silent lane. "Instructive, but I more than half
  wish I'd never heard of it."</p>

  <p>"The young lady seems grateful, sir," Parkinson ventured to suggest.</p>

  <p>"The young lady is the case, Parkinson," replied his master rather
  grimly.</p>

  <p>A few score yards farther on a swing gate gave access to a field-path,
  cutting off the corner that the high road made with the narrow lane. This was
  their way, but instead of following the brown line of trodden earth Carrados
  turned to the left and indicated the line of buildings that formed the back
  of one side of the quadrangle they had passed through.</p>

  <p>"We will investigate here," he said. "Can you see a way in?"</p>

  <p>Most of the buildings opened on to the yard, but at one end of the range
  Parkinson discovered a door, secured only by a wooden latch. The place beyond
  was impenetrably dark, but the sweet, dusty smell of hay, and, from beyond,
  the occasional click of a horse's shoe on stone and the rattle of a
  head-stall chain through the manger ring told them that they were in the
  chaff-pen at the back of the stable.</p>

  <p>Carrados stretched out his hand and touched the wall with a single
  finger.</p>

  <p>"We need go no farther," he remarked, and as they resumed their way across
  the field he took out a handkerchief to wipe the taste of whitewash off his
  tongue.</p>

  <p>Madeline had spoken of the gradual decay of High Barn, but Carrados was
  hardly prepared for the poverty-stricken desolation which Parkinson described
  as they approached the homestead on the following afternoon. He had purposely
  selected a way that took them across many of young Whitmarsh's ill-stocked
  fields, fields in which sedge and charlock wrote an indictment of neglected
  drains and half-hearted tillage. On the land, the gates and hedges had been
  broken and unkempt; the buildings, as they passed through the farmyard, were
  empty and showed here and there a skeletonry of bare rafters to the sky.</p>

  <p>"Starved," commented the blind man, as he read the signs. "The thirsty
  owner and the hungry land: they couldn't both be fed."</p>

  <p>Although it was afternoon the bolts and locks of the front door had to be
  unfastened in answer to their knock. When at last the door was opened a
  shrivelled little old woman, rather wicked-looking in a comic way, and rather
  begrimed, stood there.</p>

  <p>"Mr Frank Whitmarsh?" she replied to Carrados's polite inquiry; "oh yes,
  he lives here. Frank," she called down the passage, "you're wanted."</p>

  <p>"What is it, mother?" responded a man's full, strong voice rather
  lazily.</p>

  <p>"Come and see!" and the old creature ogled Carrados with her beady eyes as
  though the situation constituted an excellent joke between them.</p>

  <p>There was the sound of a chair being moved and at the end of the passage a
  tall man appeared in his shirt sleeves.</p>

  <p>"I am a stranger to you," explained Carrados, "but I am staying at the
  Bridge Inn and I heard of your wonderful escape on Thursday. I was so
  interested that I have taken the liberty of coming across to congratulate you
  on it."</p>

  <p>"Oh, come in, come in," said Whitmarsh. "Yes ... it was a sort of miracle,
  wasn't it?"</p>

  <p>He led the way back into the room he had come from, half kitchen, half
  parlour. It at least had the virtue of an air of rude comfort, and some of
  the pewter and china that ornamented its mantelpiece and dresser would have
  rejoiced a collector's heart.</p>

  <p>"You find us a bit rough," apologized the young man, with something of
  contempt towards his surroundings. "We weren't expecting visitors."</p>

  <p>"And I was hesitating to come because I thought that you would be
  surrounded by your friends."</p>

  <p>This very ordinary remark seemed to afford Mrs Whitmarsh unbounded
  entertainment and for quite a number of seconds she was convulsed with silent
  amusement at the idea.</p>

  <p>"Shut up, mother," said her dutiful son. "Don't take any notice of her,"
  he remarked to his visitors, "she often goes on like that. The fact is," he
  added, "we Whitmarshes aren't popular in these parts. Of course that doesn't
  trouble me; I've seen too much of things. And, taken as a boiling, the
  Whitmarshes deserve it."</p>

  <p>"Ah, wait till you touch the coal, my boy, then you'll see," put in the
  old lady, with malicious triumph.</p>

  <p>"I reckon we'll show them then, eh, mother?" he responded bumptiously.
  "Perhaps you've heard of that, Mr&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"Carrados&mdash;Wynn Carrados. This is my man, Parkinson. I have to be
  attended because my sight has failed me. Yes, I had heard something about
  coal. Providence seems to be on your side just now, Mr Whitmarsh. May I offer
  you a cigarette?"</p>

  <p>"Thanks, I don't mind for once in a way."</p>

  <p>"They're Turkish; quite innocuous, I believe."</p>

  <p>"Oh, it isn't that. I can smoke cutty with any man, I reckon, but the
  paper affects my lips. I make my own and use a sort of paper with an end that
  doesn't stick."</p>

  <p>"The paper is certainly a drawback sometimes," agreed Carrados. "I've
  found that. Might I try one of yours?"</p>

  <p>They exchanged cigarettes and Whitmarsh returned to the subject of the
  tragedy.</p>

  <p>"This has made a bit of a stir, I can tell you," he remarked, with
  complacency.</p>

  <p>"I am sure it would. Well, it was the chief topic of conversation when I
  was in London."</p>

  <p>"Is that a fact?" Avowedly indifferent to the opinion of his neighbours,
  even Whitmarsh was not proof against the pronouncement of the metropolis.
  "What do they say about it up there?"</p>

  <p>"I should be inclined to think that the interest centres round the
  explanation you will give at the inquest of the cause of the quarrel."</p>

  <p>"There! What did I tell you?" exclaimed Mrs Whitmarsh.</p>

  <p>"Be quiet, mother. That's easily answered, Mr Carrados. There was a bit of
  duck shooting that lay between our two places. But perhaps you saw that in
  the papers?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," admitted Carrados, "I saw that. Frankly, the reason seemed
  inadequate to so deadly a climax."</p>

  <p>"What did I say?" demanded the irrepressible dame. "They won't believe
  it."</p>

  <p>The young man cast a wrathful look in his mother's direction and turned
  again to the visitor.</p>

  <p>"That's because you don't know Uncle William. <i>Any</i> reason was good
  enough for him to quarrel over. Here, let me give you an instance. When I
  went in on Thursday he was smoking a pipe. Well, after a bit I took out a
  cigarette and lit it. I'm damned if he didn't turn round and start on me for
  that. How does that strike you for one of your own family, Mr Carrados?"</p>

  <p>"Unreasonable, I am bound to admit. I am afraid that I should have been
  inclined to argue the point. What did you do, Mr Whitmarsh?"</p>

  <p>"I hadn't gone there to quarrel," replied the young man, half sulky at the
  recollection. "It was his house. I threw it into the fireplace."</p>

  <p>"Very obliging," said Carrados. "But, if I may say so, it isn't so much a
  matter of speculation why he should shoot you as why he should shoot
  himself."</p>

  <p>"The gentleman seems friendly. Better ask his advice, Frank," put in the
  old woman in a penetrating whisper.</p>

  <p>"Stow it, mother!" said Whitmarsh sharply. "Are you crazy? Her idea of a
  coroner's inquest," he explained to Carrados, with easy contempt, "is that I
  am being tried for murder. As a matter of fact, Uncle William was a very
  passionate man, and, like many of that kind, he frequently went beyond
  himself. I don't doubt that he was sure he'd killed me, for he was a good
  shot and the force of the blow sent me backwards. He was a very proud man
  too, in a way&mdash;wouldn't stand correction or any kind of authority, and
  when he realized what he'd done and saw in a flash that he would be tried and
  hanged for it, suicide seemed the easiest way out of his difficulties, I
  suppose."</p>

  <p>"Yes; that sounds reasonable enough," admitted Carrados.</p>

  <p>"Then you don't think there will be any trouble, sir?" insinuated Mrs
  Whitmarsh anxiously.</p>

  <p>Frank had already professed his indifference to local opinion, but
  Carrados was conscious that both of them hung rather breathlessly on to his
  reply.</p>

  <p>"Why, no," he declared weightily. "I should see no reason for anticipating
  any. Unless," he added thoughtfully, "some clever lawyer was instructed to
  insist that there must be more in the dispute than appears on the
  surface."</p>

  <p>"Oh, them lawyers, them lawyers!" moaned the old lady in a panic. "They
  can make you say anything."</p>

  <p>"They can't make me say anything." A cunning look came into his complacent
  face. "And, besides, who's going to engage a lawyer?"</p>

  <p>"The family of the deceased gentleman might wish to do so."</p>

  <p>"Both of the sons are abroad and could not be back in time."</p>

  <p>"But is there not a daughter here? I understood so."</p>

  <p>Whitmarsh gave a short, unpleasant laugh and turned to look at his
  mother.</p>

  <p>"Madeline won't. You may bet your bottom tikkie it's the last thing she
  would want."</p>

  <p>The little old creature gazed admiringly at her big showy son and
  responded with an appreciative grimace that made her look more humorously
  rat-like than ever.</p>

  <p>"He! he! Missie won't," she tittered. "That would never do. He! he!" Wink
  succeeded nod and meaning smile until she relapsed into a state of quietness;
  and Parkinson, who had been fascinated by her contortions, was unable to
  decide whether she was still laughing or had gone to sleep.</p>

  <p>Carrados stayed a few more minutes and before they left he asked to see
  the watch.</p>

  <p>"A unique memento, Mr Whitmarsh," he remarked, examining it. "I should
  think this would become a family heirloom."</p>

  <p>"It's no good for anything else," said Whitmarsh practically. "A famous
  time-keeper it was, too."</p>

  <p>"The fingers are both gone."</p>

  <p>"Yes; the glass was broken, of course, and they must have caught in the
  cloth of my pocket and ripped off."</p>

  <p>"They naturally would; it was ten minutes past nine when the shot was
  fired."</p>

  <p>The young man thought and then nodded.</p>

  <p>"About that," he agreed.</p>

  <p>"Nearer than 'about,' if your watch was correct. Very interesting, Mr
  Whitmarsh. I am glad to have seen the watch that saved your life."</p>

  <p>Instead of returning to the inn Carrados directed Parkinson to take the
  road to Barony. Madeline was at home, and from the sound of voices it
  appeared that she had other visitors, but she came out to Carrados at once,
  and at his request took him into the empty dining-room while Parkinson stayed
  in the hall.</p>

  <p>"Yes?" she said eagerly.</p>

  <p>"I have come to tell you that I must throw up my brief," he said. "There
  is nothing more to be done and I return to town to-night."</p>

  <p>"Oh!" she stammered helplessly. "I thought&mdash;I
  thought&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Your cousin did not abstract the revolver when he was here on Thursday,
  Miss Whitmarsh. He did not at his leisure fire a bullet into his own watch to
  make it appear, later in the day, as if he had been attacked. He did not
  reload the cartridge with a blank charge. He did not deliberately shoot your
  father and then fire off the blank cartridge. He <i>was</i> attacked and the
  newspaper version is substantially correct. The whole fabric so delicately
  suggested by inference and innuendo falls to pieces."</p>

  <p>"Then you desert me, Mr Carrados?" she said, in a low, bitter voice.</p>

  <p>"I have seen the watch&mdash;the watch that saved Whitmarsh's life," he
  continued, unmoved. "It would save it again if necessary. It indicates ten
  minutes past nine&mdash;the time to a minute at which it is agreed the shot
  was fired. By what prescience was he to know at what exact minute his
  opportunity would occur?"</p>

  <p>"When I saw the watch on Thursday night the fingers were not there."</p>

  <p>"They are not, but the shaft remains. It is of an old-fashioned pattern
  and it will only take the fingers in one position. That position indicates
  ten minutes past nine."</p>

  <p>"Surely it would have been an easy matter to have altered that
  afterwards?"</p>

  <p>"In this case fate has been curiously systematic, Miss Whitmarsh. The
  bullet that shattered the works has so locked the action that it will not
  move a fraction this way or that."</p>

  <p>"There is something more than this&mdash;something that I do not
  understand," she persisted. "I think I have a right to know."</p>

  <p>"Since you insist, there is. There is the wad of the blank cartridge that
  you fired in the outbuilding."</p>

  <p>"Oh!" she exclaimed, in the moment of startled undefence, "how do
  you&mdash;how can you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You must leave the conjurer his few tricks for effect. Of course you
  naturally would fire it where the precious pellet could not get
  lost&mdash;the paper you steamed off the cigarette that Whitmarsh threw into
  the empty fire-grate; and of course the place must be some distance from the
  house or even that slight report might occasion remark."</p>

  <p>"Yes," she confessed, in a sudden abandonment to weary indifference, "it
  has been useless. I was a fool to set my cleverness against yours. Now, I
  suppose, Mr Carrados, you will have to hand me over to justice?</p>

  <p>"Well; why don't you say something?" she demanded impatiently, as he
  offered no comment.</p>

  <p>"People frequently put me in this embarrassing position," he explained
  diffidently, "and throw the responsibility on me. Now a number of years ago a
  large and stately building was set up in London and it was beautifully called
  'The Royal Palace of Justice.' That was its official name and that was what
  it was to be; but very soon people got into the way of calling it the Law
  Courts, and to-day, if you asked a Londoner to direct you to the Palace of
  Justice he would undoubtedly set you down as a religious maniac. You see my
  difficulty?"</p>

  <p>"It is very strange," she said, intent upon her own reflections, "but I do
  not feel a bit ashamed to you of what I have done. I do not even feel afraid
  to tell you all about it, although of some of that I must certainly be
  ashamed. Why is it?"</p>

  <p>"Because I am blind?"</p>

  <p>"Oh no," she replied very positively.</p>

  <p>Carrados smiled at her decision but he did not seek to explain that when
  he could no longer see the faces of men the power was gradually given to him
  of looking into their hearts, to which some in their turn&mdash;strong, free
  spirits&mdash;instinctively responded.</p>

  <p>"There is such a thing as friendship at first sight," he suggested.</p>

  <p>"Why, yes; like quite old friends," she agreed. "It is a pity that I had
  no very trusty friend, since my mother died when I was quite little. Even my
  father has been&mdash;it is queer to think of it now&mdash;well, almost a
  stranger to me really."</p>

  <p>She looked at Carrados's serene and kindly face and smiled.</p>

  <p>"It is a great relief to be able to talk like this, without the necessity
  for lying," she remarked. "Did you know that I was engaged?"</p>

  <p>"No; you had not told me that."</p>

  <p>"Oh no, but you might have heard of it. He is a clergyman whom I met last
  summer. But, of course, that is all over now."</p>

  <p>"You have broken it off?"</p>

  <p>"Circumstances have broken it off. The daughter of a man who had the
  misfortune to be murdered might just possibly be tolerated as a vicar's wife,
  but the daughter of a murderer and suicide&mdash;it is unthinkable! You see,
  the requirements for the office are largely social, Mr Carrados."</p>

  <p>"Possibly your vicar may have other views."</p>

  <p>"Oh, he isn't a vicar yet, but he is rather well-connected, so it is quite
  assured. And he would be dreadfully torn if the choice lay with him. As it
  is, he will perhaps rather soon get over my absence. But, you see, if we
  married he could never get over my presence; it would always stand in the way
  of his preferment. I worked very hard to make it possible, but it could not
  be."</p>

  <p>"You were even prepared to send an innocent man to the gallows?"</p>

  <p>"I think so, at one time," she admitted frankly. "But I scarcely thought
  it would come to that. There are so many well-meaning people who always get
  up petitions.... No, as I stand here looking at myself over there, I feel
  that I couldn't quite have hanged Frank, no matter how much he deserved
  it.... You are very shocked, Mr Carrados?"</p>

  <p>"Well," admitted Carrados, with pleasant impartiality, "I have seen the
  young man, but the penalty, even with a reprieve, still seems to me a little
  severe."</p>

  <p>"Yet how do you know, even now, that he is, as you say, an innocent
  man?"</p>

  <p>"I don't," was the prompt admission. "I only know, in this astonishing
  case, that so far as my investigation goes, he did not murder your father by
  the act of his hand."</p>

  <p>"Not according to your Law Courts?" she suggested. "But in the great
  Palace of Justice?... Well, you shall judge."</p>

  <p>She left his side, crossed the room, and stood by the square, ugly window,
  looking out, but as blind as Carrados to the details of the somnolent
  landscape.</p>

  <p>"I met Frank for the first time after I was at all grown-up about three
  years ago, when I returned from boarding-school. I had not seen him since I
  was a child, and I thought him very tall and manly. It seemed a frightfully
  romantic thing in the circumstances to meet him secretly&mdash;of course my
  thoughts flew to Romeo and Juliet. We put impassioned letters for one another
  in a hollow tree that stood on the boundary hedge. But presently I found
  out&mdash;gradually and incredulously at first and then one night with a
  sudden terrible certainty&mdash;that my ideas of romance were not his.... I
  had what is called, I believe, a narrow escape. I was glad when he went
  abroad, for it was only my self-conceit that had suffered. I was never in
  love with him: only in love with the idea of being in love with him.</p>

  <p>"A few months ago Frank came back to High Barn. I tried never to meet him
  anywhere, but one day he overtook me in the lanes. He said that he had
  thought a lot about me while he was away, and would I marry him. I told him
  that it was impossible in any case, and, besides, I was engaged. He coolly
  replied that he knew. I was dumbfounded and asked him what he meant.</p>

  <p>"Then he took out a packet of my letters that he had kept somewhere all
  the time. He insisted on reading parts of them up and telling me what this
  and that meant and what everyone would say it proved. I was horrified at the
  construction that seemed capable of being put on my foolish but innocent
  gush. I called him a coward and a blackguard and a mean cur and a sneaking
  cad and everything I could think of in one long breath, until I found myself
  faint and sick with excitement and the nameless growing terror of it.</p>

  <p>"He only laughed and told me to think it over, and then walked on,
  throwing the letters up into the air and catching them.</p>

  <p>"It isn't worth while going into all the times he met and threatened me. I
  was to marry him or he would expose me. He would never allow me to marry
  anyone else. And then finally he turned round and said that he didn't really
  want to marry me at all; he only wanted to force father's consent to start
  mining and this had seemed the easiest way."</p>

  <p>"That is what is called blackmail, Miss Whitmarsh; a word you don't seem
  to have applied to him. The punishment ranges up to penal servitude for life
  in extreme cases."</p>

  <p>"Yes, that is what it really was. He came on Thursday with the letters in
  his pocket. That was his last threat when he could not move me. I can guess
  what happened. He read the letters and proposed a bargain. And my father, who
  was a very passionate man, and very proud in certain ways, shot him as he
  thought, and then, in shame and in the madness of despair, took his own
  life.... Now, Mr Carrados, you were to be my judge."</p>

  <p>"I think," said the blind man, with a great pity in his voice, "that it
  will be sufficient for you to come up for Judgment when called upon."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Three weeks later a registered letter bearing the Liverpool
  postmark was delivered at The Turrets. After he had read it Carrados put it
  away in a special drawer of his desk, and once or twice in after years, when
  his work seemed rather barren, he took it out and read it. This is what it
  contained:</p><br>

  <p class="letter">"<span class="smcap">Dear Mr Carrados</span>,&mdash;Some
  time after you had left me that Sunday afternoon, a man came in the dark to
  the door and asked for me. I did not see his face for he kept in the shade,
  but his figure was not very unlike that of your servant Parkinson. A packet
  was put into my hands and he was gone without a word. From this I imagine
  that perhaps you did not leave quite as soon as you had intended.</p>

  <p class="letter">"Thank you very much indeed for the letters. I was glad to
  have the miserable things, to drop them into the fire, and to see them pass
  utterly out of my own and everybody else's life. I wonder who else in the
  world would have done so much for a forlorn creature who just flashed across
  a few days of his busy life? and then I wonder who else could.</p>

  <p class="letter">"But there is something else for which I thank you now far,
  far more, and that is for saving me from the blindness of my own passionate
  folly. When I look back on the abyss of meanness, treachery and guilt into
  which I would have wilfully cast myself, and been condemned to live in all my
  life, I can scarcely trust myself to write.</p>

  <p class="letter">"I will not say that I do not suffer now. I think I shall
  for many years to come, but all the bitterness and I think all the hardness
  have been drawn out.</p>

  <p class="letter">"You will see that I am writing from Liverpool. I have
  taken a second-class passage to Canada and we sail to-night. Willie, who
  returned to Barony last week, has lent me all the money I shall need until I
  find work. Do not be apprehensive. It is not with the vague uncertainty of an
  indifferent typist or a downtrodden governess that I go, but as an efficient
  domestic servant&mdash;a capable cook, housemaid or 'general,' as need be. It
  sounds rather incredible at first, does it not, but such things happen, and I
  shall get on very well.</p>

  <p class="letter">"Good-bye, Mr Carrados; I shall remember you very often and
  very gratefully.</p>

  <p class="letter">"<span class="smcap">Madeline Whitmarsh</span>.</p>

  <p class="letter">"P.S.&mdash;Yes, there is friendship at first sight."</p>

  <h2><a id="story7"
     name="story7"></a>VII. THE COMEDY AT FOUNTAIN COTTAGE</h2>

  <h3>Serialised in <i>The News Of The World</i>, Nov 16-23, 1913</h3>

  <p class="first">Carrados had rung up Mr Carlyle soon after the inquiry agent
  had reached his office in Bampton Street on a certain morning in April. Mr
  Carlyle's face at once assumed its most amiable expression as he recognized
  his friend's voice.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Max," he replied, in answer to the call, "I am here and at the top
  of form, thanks. Glad to know that you are back from Trescoe. Is
  there&mdash;anything?"</p>

  <p>"I have a couple of men coming in this evening whom you might like to
  meet," explained Carrados. "Manoel the Zambesia explorer is one and the other
  an East-End slum doctor who has seen a few things. Do you care to come round
  to dinner?"</p>

  <p>"Delighted," warbled Mr Carlyle, without a moment's consideration.
  "Charmed. Your usual hour, Max?" Then the smiling complacence of his face
  suddenly changed and the wire conveyed an exclamation of annoyance. "I am
  really very sorry, Max, but I have just remembered that I have an engagement.
  I fear that I must deny myself after all."</p>

  <p>"Is it important?"</p>

  <p>"No," admitted Mr Carlyle. "Strictly speaking, it is not in the least
  important; this is why I feel compelled to keep it. It is only to dine with
  my niece. They have just got into an absurd doll's house of a villa at
  Groat's Heath and I had promised to go there this evening."</p>

  <p>"Are they particular to a day?"</p>

  <p>There was a moment's hesitation before Mr Carlyle replied.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid so, now it is fixed," he said. "To you, Max, it will be
  ridiculous or incomprehensible that a third to dinner&mdash;and he only a
  middle-aged uncle&mdash;should make a straw of difference. But I know that in
  their bijou way it will be a little domestic event to Elsie&mdash;an added
  anxiety in giving the butcher an order, an extra course for dinner, perhaps;
  a careful drilling of the one diminutive maid-servant, and she is such a
  charming little woman&mdash;eh? Who, Max? No! No! I did not say the
  maid-servant; if I did it is the fault of this telephone. Elsie is such a
  delightful little creature that, upon my soul, it would be too bad to fail
  her now."</p>

  <p>"Of course it would, you old humbug," agreed Carrados, with sympathetic
  laughter in his voice. "Well, come to-morrow instead. I shall be alone."</p>

  <p>"Oh, besides, there is a special reason for going, which for the moment I
  forgot," explained Mr Carlyle, after accepting the invitation. "Elsie wishes
  for my advice with regard to her next-door neighbour. He is an elderly man of
  retiring disposition and he makes a practice of throwing kidneys over into
  her garden."</p>

  <p>"Kittens! Throwing kittens?"</p>

  <p>"No, no, Max. Kidneys. Stewed k-i-d-n-e-y-s. It is a little difficult to
  explain plausibly over a badly vibrating telephone, I admit, but that is what
  Elsie's letter assured me, and she adds that she is in despair."</p>

  <p>"At all events it makes the lady quite independent of the butcher,
  Louis!"</p>

  <p>"I have no further particulars, Max. It may be a solitary diurnal
  offering, or the sky may at times appear to rain kidneys. If it is a mania
  the symptoms may even have become more pronounced and the man is possibly
  showering beef-steaks across by this time. I will make full inquiry and let
  you know."</p>

  <p>"Do," assented Carrados, in the same light-hearted spirit. "Mrs Nickleby's
  neighbourly admirer expressed his feelings by throwing cucumbers, you
  remember, but this man puts him completely in the shade."</p>

  <p>It had not got beyond the proportions of a jest to either of them when
  they rang off&mdash;one of those whimsical occurrences in real life that
  sound so fantastic in outline. Carrados did not give the matter another
  thought until the next evening when his friend's arrival revived the
  subject.</p>

  <p>"And the gentleman next door?" he inquired among his greetings. "Did the
  customary offering arrive while you were there?"</p>

  <p>"No," admitted Mr Carlyle, beaming pleasantly upon all the familiar
  appointments of the room, "it did not, Max. In fact, so diffident has the
  mysterious philanthropist become, that no one at Fountain Cottage has been
  able to catch sight of him lately, although I am told that
  Scamp&mdash;Elsie's terrier&mdash;betrays a very self-conscious guilt and
  suspiciously muddy paws every morning."</p>

  <p>"Fountain Cottage?"</p>

  <p>"That is the name of the toy villa."</p>

  <p>"Yes, but Fountain something, Groat's Heath&mdash;Fountain Court: wasn't
  that where Metrobe&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes, to be sure, Max. Metrobe the traveller, the writer and
  scientist&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Scientist!"</p>

  <p>"Well, he took up spiritualism or something, didn't he? At any rate, he
  lived at Fountain Court, an old red-brick house in a large neglected garden
  there, until his death a couple of years ago. Then, as Groat's Heath had
  suddenly become a popular suburb with a tube railway, a land company acquired
  the estate, the house was razed to the ground and in a twinkling a colony of
  Noah's ark villas took its place. There is Metrobe Road here, and Court
  Crescent there, and Mansion Drive and what not, and Elsie's little place
  perpetuates another landmark."</p>

  <p>"I have Metrobe's last book there," said Carrados, nodding towards a point
  on his shelves. "In fact he sent me a copy. 'The Flame beyond the Dome' it is
  called&mdash;the queerest farrago of balderdash and metaphysics imaginable.
  But what about the neighbour, Louis? Did you settle what we might almost term
  'his hash'?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, he is mad, of course. I advised her to make as little fuss about it
  as possible, seeing that the man lives next door and might become
  objectionable, but I framed a note for her to send which will probably have a
  good effect."</p>

  <p>"Is he mad, Louis?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I don't say that he is strictly a lunatic, but there is obviously a
  screw loose somewhere. He may carry indiscriminate benevolence towards
  Yorkshire terriers to irrational lengths. Or he may be a food specialist with
  a grievance. In effect he is mad on at least that one point. How else are we
  to account for the circumstances?"</p>

  <p>"I was wondering," replied Carrados thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"You suggest that he really may have a sane object?"</p>

  <p>"I suggest it&mdash;for the sake of argument. If he has a sane object,
  what is it?"</p>

  <p>"That I leave to you, Max," retorted Mr Carlyle conclusively. "If he has a
  sane object, pray what is it?"</p>

  <p>"For the sake of the argument I will tell you that in half-a-dozen words,
  Louis," replied Carrados, with good-humoured tolerance. "If he is not mad in
  the sense which you have defined, the answer stares us in the face. His
  object is precisely that which he is achieving."</p>

  <p>Mr Carlyle looked inquiringly into the placid, unemotional face of his
  blind friend, as if to read there whether, incredible as it might seem, Max
  should be taking the thing seriously after all.</p>

  <p>"And what is that?" he asked cautiously.</p>

  <p>"In the first place he has produced the impression that he is eccentric or
  irresponsible. That is sometimes useful in itself. Then what else has he
  done?"</p>

  <p>"What else, Max?" replied Mr Carlyle, with some indignation. "Well,
  whatever he wishes to achieve by it I can tell you one thing else that he has
  done. He has so demoralized Scamp with his confounded kidneys that Elsie's
  neatly arranged flower-beds&mdash;and she took Fountain Cottage principally
  on account of an unusually large garden&mdash;are hopelessly devastated. If
  she keeps the dog up, the garden is invaded night and day by an army of
  peregrinating feline marauders that scent the booty from afar. He has gained
  the everlasting annoyance of an otherwise charming neighbour, Max. Can you
  tell me what he has achieved by that?"</p>

  <p>"The everlasting esteem of Scamp probably. Is he a good watch-dog,
  Louis?"</p>

  <p>"Good heavens, Max!" exclaimed Mr Carlyle, coming to his feet as though he
  had the intention of setting out for Groat's Heath then and there, "is it
  possible that he is planning a burglary?"</p>

  <p>"Do they keep much of value about the house?"</p>

  <p>"No," admitted Mr Carlyle, sitting down again with considerable relief.
  "No, they don't. Bellmark is not particularly well endowed with worldly
  goods&mdash;in fact, between ourselves, Max, Elsie could have done very much
  better from a strictly social point of view, but he is a thoroughly good
  fellow and idolizes her. They have no silver worth speaking of, and for the
  rest&mdash;well, just the ordinary petty cash of a frugal young couple."</p>

  <p>"Then he probably is not planning a burglary. I confess that the idea did
  not appeal to me. If it is only that, why should he go to the trouble of
  preparing this particular succulent dish to throw over his neighbour's ground
  when cold liver would do quite as well?"</p>

  <p>"If it is not only that, why should he go to the trouble, Max?"</p>

  <p>"Because by that bait he produces the greatest disturbance of your niece's
  garden."</p>

  <p>"And, if sane, why should he wish to do that?"</p>

  <p>"Because in those conditions he can the more easily obliterate his own
  traces if he trespasses there at nights."</p>

  <p>"Well, upon my word, that's drawing a bow at a venture, Max. If it isn't
  burglary, what motive could the man have for any such nocturnal
  perambulation?"</p>

  <p>An expression of suave mischief came into Carrados's usually imperturbable
  face.</p>

  <p>"Many imaginable motives surely, Louis. You are a man of the world. Why
  not to meet a charming little woman&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No, by gad!" exclaimed the scandalized uncle warmly; "I decline to
  consider the remotest possibility of that explanation.
  Elsie&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Certainly not," interposed Carrados, smothering his quiet laughter. "The
  maid-servant, of course."</p>

  <p>Mr Carlyle reined in his indignation and recovered himself with his usual
  adroitness.</p>

  <p>"But, you know, that is an atrocious libel, Max," he added. "I never said
  such a thing. However, is it probable?"</p>

  <p>"No," admitted Carrados. "I don't think that in the circumstances it is at
  all probable."</p>

  <p>"Then where are we, Max?"</p>

  <p>"A little further than we were at the beginning. Very little.... Are you
  willing to give me a roving commission to investigate?"</p>

  <p>"Of course, Max, of course," assented Mr Carlyle heartily. "I&mdash;well,
  as far as I was concerned, I regarded the matter as settled."</p>

  <p>Carrados turned to his desk and the ghost of a smile might possibly have
  lurked about his face. He produced some stationery and indicated it to his
  visitor.</p>

  <p>"You don't mind giving me a line of introduction to your niece?"</p>

  <p>"Pleasure," murmured Carlyle, taking up a pen. "What shall I say?"</p>

  <p>Carrados took the inquiry in its most literal sense and for reply he
  dictated the following letter:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="letter">"'<span class="smcap">My Dear Elsie</span>,'&mdash;</p>

  <p>"If that is the way you usually address her," he parenthesized.</p>

  <p>"Quite so," acquiesced Mr Carlyle, writing.</p>

  <p class="letter">"'The bearer of this is Mr Carrados, of whom I have spoken
  to you.'</p>

  <p>"You have spoken of me to her, I trust, Louis?" he put in.</p>

  <p>"I believe that I have casually referred to you," admitted the writer.</p>

  <p>"I felt sure you would have done. It makes the rest easier.</p>

  <p class="letter">"'He is not in the least mad although he frequently does
  things which to the uninitiated appear more or less eccentric at the moment.
  I think that you would be quite safe in complying with any suggestion he may
  make.</p>

  <p class="letter">"'Your affectionate uncle,</p>

  <p class="letter">"'<span class="smcap">Louis Carlyle</span>.'"</p><br>

  <p>He accepted the envelope and put it away in a pocket-book that always
  seemed extraordinarily thin for the amount of papers it contained.</p>

  <p>"I may call there to-morrow," he added.</p>

  <p>Neither again referred to the subject during the evening, but when
  Parkinson came to the library a couple of hours after midnight to know
  whether he would be required again, he found his master rather deeply
  immersed in a book and a gap on the shelf where "The Flame beyond the Dome"
  had formerly stood.</p>

  <p>It is not impossible that Mr Carlyle supplemented his brief note of
  introduction with a more detailed communication that reached his niece by the
  ordinary postal service at an earlier hour than the other. At all events,
  when Mr Carrados presented himself at the toy villa on the following
  afternoon he found Elsie Bellmark suspiciously disposed to accept him and his
  rather gratuitous intervention among her suburban troubles as a matter of
  course.</p>

  <p>When the car drew up at the bright green wooden gate of Fountain Cottage
  another visitor, apparently a good-class working man, was standing on the
  path of the trim front garden, lingering over a reluctant departure. Carrados
  took sufficient time in alighting to allow the man to pass through the gate
  before he himself entered. The last exchange of sentences reached his
  ear.</p>

  <p>"I'm sure, marm, you won't find anyone to do the work at less."</p>

  <p>"I can quite believe that," replied a very fair young lady who stood
  nearer the house, "but, you see, we do all the gardening ourselves, thank
  you."</p>

  <p>Carrados made himself known and was taken into the daintily pretty
  drawing-room that opened on to the lawn behind the house.</p>

  <p>"I do not need to ask if you are Mrs Bellmark," he had declared.</p>

  <p>"I have Uncle Louis's voice?" she divined readily.</p>

  <p>"The niece of his voice, so to speak," he admitted. "Voices mean a great
  deal to me, Mrs Bellmark."</p>

  <p>"In recognizing and identifying people?" she suggested.</p>

  <p>"Oh, very much more than that. In recognizing and identifying their
  moods&mdash;their thoughts even. There are subtle lines of trouble and the
  deep rings of anxious care quite as patent to the ear as to the sharpest eye
  sometimes."</p>

  <p>Elsie Bellmark shot a glance of curiously interested speculation to the
  face that, in spite of its frank, open bearing, revealed so marvellously
  little itself.</p>

  <p>"If I had any dreadful secret, I think that I should be a little afraid to
  talk to you, Mr Carrados," she said, with a half-nervous laugh.</p>

  <p>"Then please do not have any dreadful secret," he replied, with quite
  youthful gallantry. "I more than suspect that Louis has given you a very
  transpontine idea of my tastes. I do not spend all my time tracking murderers
  to their lairs, Mrs Bellmark, and I have never yet engaged in a hand-to-hand
  encounter with a band of cut-throats."</p>

  <p>"He told us," she declared, the recital lifting her voice into a tone that
  Carrados vowed to himself was wonderfully thrilling, "about this: He said
  that you were once in a sort of lonely underground cellar near the river with
  two desperate men whom you could send to penal servitude. The police, who
  were to have been there at a certain time, had not arrived, and you were
  alone. The men had heard that you were blind but they could hardly believe
  it. They were discussing in whispers which could not be overheard what would
  be the best thing to do, and they had just agreed that if you really were
  blind they would risk the attempt to murder you. Then, Louis said, at that
  very moment you took a pair of scissors from your pocket, and coolly asking
  them why they did not have a lamp down there, you actually snuffed the candle
  that stood on the table before you. Is that true?"</p>

  <p>Carrados's mind leapt vividly back to the most desperate moment of his
  existence, but his smile was gently deprecating as he replied:</p>

  <p>"I seem to recognize the touch of truth in the inclination to do
  <i>anything</i> rather than fight," he confessed. "But, although he never
  suspects it, Louis really sees life through rose-coloured opera glasses. Take
  the case of your quite commonplace neighbour&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That is really what you came about?" she interposed shrewdly.</p>

  <p>"Frankly, it is," he replied. "I am more attracted by a turn of the odd
  and grotesque than by the most elaborate tragedy. The fantastic conceit of
  throwing stewed kidneys over into a neighbour's garden irresistibly appealed
  to me. Louis, as I was saying, regards the man in the romantic light of a
  humanitarian monomaniac or a demented food reformer. I take a more subdued
  view and I think that his action, when rightly understood, will prove to be
  something quite obviously natural."</p>

  <p>"Of course it is very ridiculous, but all the same it has been desperately
  annoying," she confessed. "Still, it scarcely matters now. I am only sorry
  that it should have been the cause of wasting your valuable time, Mr
  Carrados."</p>

  <p>"My valuable time," he replied, "only seems valuable to me when I am, as
  you would say, wasting it. But is the incident closed? Louis told me that he
  had drafted you a letter of remonstrance. May I ask if it has been
  effective?"</p>

  <p>Instead of replying at once she got up and walked to the long French
  window and looked out over the garden where the fruit-trees that had been
  spared from the older cultivation were rejoicing the eye with the promise of
  their pink and white profusion.</p>

  <p>"I did not send it," she said slowly, turning to her visitor again. "There
  is something that I did not tell Uncle Louis, because it would only have
  distressed him without doing any good. We may be leaving here very soon."</p>

  <p>"Just when you had begun to get it well in hand?" he said, in some
  surprise.</p>

  <p>"It is a pity, is it not, but one cannot foresee these things. There is no
  reason why you should not know the cause, since you have interested yourself
  so far, Mr Carrados. In fact," she added, smiling away the seriousness of the
  manner into which she had fallen, "I am not at all sure that you do not know
  already."</p>

  <p>He shook his head and disclaimed any such prescience.</p>

  <p>"At all events you recognized that I was not exactly light-hearted," she
  insisted. "Oh, you did not say that <i>I</i> had dark rings under my eyes, I
  know, but the cap fitted excellently.... It has to do with my husband's
  business. He is with a firm of architects. It was a little venturesome taking
  this house&mdash;we had been in apartments for two years&mdash;but Roy was
  doing so well with his people and I was so enthusiastic for a garden that we
  did&mdash;scarcely two months ago. Everything seemed quite assured. Then came
  this thunderbolt. The partners&mdash;it is only a small firm, Mr
  Carrados&mdash;required a little more capital in the business. Someone whom
  they know is willing to put in two thousand pounds, but he stipulates for a
  post with them as well. He, like my husband, is a draughtsman. There is no
  need for the services of both and so&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Is it settled?"</p>

  <p>"In effect, it is. They are as nice as can be about it but that does not
  alter the facts. They declare that they would rather have Roy than the new
  man and they have definitely offered to retain him if he can bring in even
  one thousand pounds. I suppose they have some sort of compunction about
  turning him adrift, for they have asked him to think it over and let them
  know on Monday. Of course, that is the end of it. It may be&mdash;I don't
  know&mdash;I don't like to think, how long before Roy gets another position
  equally good. We must endeavour to get this house off our hands and creep
  back to our three rooms. It is ... luck."</p>

  <p>Carrados had been listening to her wonderfully musical voice as another
  man might have been drawn irresistibly to watch the piquant charm of her
  delicate face.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he assented, almost to himself, "it is that strange, inexplicable
  grouping of men and things that, under one name or another, we all confess
  ... just luck."</p>

  <p>"Of course you will not mention this to Uncle Louis yet, Mr Carrados?"</p>

  <p>"If you do not wish it, certainly not."</p>

  <p>"I am sure that it would distress him. He is so soft-hearted, so kind, in
  everything. Do you know, I found out that he had had an invitation to dine
  somewhere and meet some quite important people on Tuesday. Yet he came here
  instead, although most other men would have cried off, just because he knew
  that we small people would have been disappointed."</p>

  <p>"Well, you can't expect me to see any self-denial in that," exclaimed
  Carrados. "Why, I was one of them myself."</p>

  <p>Elsie Bellmark laughed outright at the expressive disgust of his tone.</p>

  <p>"I had no idea of that," she said. "Then there is another reason. Uncle is
  not very well off, yet if he knew how Roy was situated he would make an
  effort to arrange matters. He would, I am sure, even borrow himself in order
  to lend us the money. That is a thing Roy and I are quite agreed on. We will
  go back; we will go under, if it is to be; but we will not borrow money, not
  even from Uncle Louis."</p>

  <p>Once, subsequently, Carrados suddenly asked Mr Carlyle whether he had ever
  heard a woman's voice roll like a celestial kettle-drum. The professional
  gentleman was vastly amused by the comparison, but he admitted that he had
  not.</p>

  <p>"So that, you see," concluded Mrs Bellmark, "there is really nothing to be
  done."</p>

  <p>"Oh, quite so; I am sure that you are right," assented her visitor
  readily. "But in the meanwhile I do not see why the annoyance of your
  next-door neighbour should be permitted to go on."</p>

  <p>"Of course: I have not told you that, and I could not explain it to
  uncle," she said. "I am anxious not to do anything to put him out because I
  have a hope&mdash;rather a faint one, certainly&mdash;that the man may be
  willing to take over this house."</p>

  <p>It would be incorrect to say that Carrados pricked up his ears&mdash;if
  that curious phenomenon has any physical manifestation&mdash;for the
  sympathetic expression of his face did not vary a fraction. But into his mind
  there came a gleam such as might inspire a patient digger who sees the first
  speck of gold that justifies his faith in an unlikely claim.</p>

  <p>"Oh," he said, quite conversationally, "is there a chance of that?"</p>

  <p>"He undoubtedly did want it. It is very curious in a way. A few weeks ago,
  before we were really settled, he came one afternoon, saying he had heard
  that this house was to be let. Of course I told him that he was too late,
  that we had already taken it for three years."</p>

  <p>"You were the first tenants?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. The house was scarcely ready when we signed the agreement. Then this
  Mr Johns, or Jones&mdash;I am not sure which he said&mdash;went on in a
  rather extraordinary way to persuade me to sublet it to him. He said that the
  house was dear and I could get plenty, more convenient, at less rent, and it
  was unhealthy, and the drains were bad, and that we should be pestered by
  tramps and it was just the sort of house that burglars picked on, only he had
  taken a sort of fancy to it and he would give me a fifty-pound premium for
  the term."</p>

  <p>"Did he explain the motive for this rather eccentric partiality?"</p>

  <p>"I don't imagine that he did. He repeated several times that he was a
  queer old fellow with his whims and fancies and that they often cost him
  dear."</p>

  <p>"I think we all know that sort of old fellow," said Carrados. "It must
  have been rather entertaining for you, Mrs Bellmark."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I suppose it was," she admitted. "The next thing we knew of him was
  that he had taken the other house as soon as it was finished."</p>

  <p>"Then he would scarcely require this?"</p>

  <p>"I am afraid not." It was obvious that the situation was not disposed of.
  "But he seems to have so little furniture there and to live so solitarily,"
  she explained, "that we have even wondered whether he might not be there
  merely as a sort of caretaker."</p>

  <p>"And you have never heard where he came from or who he is?"</p>

  <p>"Only what the milkman told my servant&mdash;our chief source of local
  information, Mr Carrados. He declares that the man used to be the butler at a
  large house that stood here formerly, Fountain Court, and that his name is
  neither Johns nor Jones. But very likely it is all a mistake."</p>

  <p>"If not, he is certainly attached to the soil," was her visitor's
  rejoinder. "And, apropos of that, will you show me over your garden before I
  go, Mrs Bellmark?"</p>

  <p>"With pleasure," she assented, rising also. "I will ring now and then I
  can offer you tea when we have been round. That is, if
  you&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"Thank you, I do," he replied. "And would you allow my man to go through
  into the garden&mdash;in case I require him?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, certainly. You must tell me just what you want without thinking it
  necessary to ask permission, Mr Carrados," she said, with a pretty air of
  protection. "Shall Amy take a message?"</p>

  <p>He acquiesced and turned to the servant who had appeared in response to
  the bell.</p>

  <p>"Will you go to the car and tell my man&mdash;Parkinson&mdash;that I
  require him here. Say that he can bring his book; he will understand."</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir."</p>

  <p>They stepped out through the French window and sauntered across the lawn.
  Before they had reached the other side Parkinson reported himself.</p>

  <p>"You had better stay here," said his master, indicating the sward
  generally. "Mrs Bellmark will allow you to bring out a chair from the
  drawing-room."</p>

  <p>"Thank you, sir; there is a rustic seat already provided," replied
  Parkinson.</p>

  <p>He sat down with his back to the houses and opened the book that he had
  brought. Let in among its pages was an ingeniously contrived mirror.</p>

  <p>When their promenade again brought them near the rustic seat Carrados
  dropped a few steps behind.</p>

  <p>"He is watching you from one of the upper rooms, sir," fell from
  Parkinson's lips as he sat there without raising his eyes from the page
  before him.</p>

  <p>The blind man caught up to his hostess again.</p>

  <p>"You intended this lawn for croquet?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"No; not specially. It is too small, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"Not necessarily. I think it is in about the proportion of four by five
  all right. Given that, size does not really matter for an unsophisticated
  game."</p>

  <p>To settle the point he began to pace the plot of ground, across and then
  lengthways. Next, apparently dissatisfied with this rough measurement, he
  applied himself to marking it off more exactly by means of his walking-stick.
  Elsie Bellmark was by no means dull but the action sprang so naturally from
  the conversation that it did not occur to her to look for any deeper
  motive.</p>

  <p>"He has got a pair of field-glasses and is now at the window,"
  communicated Parkinson.</p>

  <p>"I am going out of sight," was the equally quiet response. "If he becomes
  more anxious tell me afterwards."</p>

  <p>"It is quite all right," he reported, returning to Mrs Bellmark with the
  satisfaction of bringing agreeable news. "It should make a splendid little
  ground, but you may have to level up a few dips after the earth has set."</p>

  <p>A chance reference to the kitchen garden by the visitor took them to a
  more distant corner of the enclosure where the rear of Fountain Cottage cut
  off the view from the next house windows.</p>

  <p>"We decided on this part for vegetables because it does not really belong
  to the garden proper," she explained. "When they build farther on this side
  we shall have to give it up very soon. And it would be a pity if it was all
  in flowers."</p>

  <p>With the admirable spirit of the ordinary Englishwoman, she spoke of the
  future as if there was no cloud to obscure its prosperous course. She had
  frankly declared their position to her uncle's best friend because in the
  circumstances it had seemed to be the simplest and most straightforward thing
  to do; beyond that, there was no need to whine about it.</p>

  <p>"It is a large garden," remarked Carrados. "And you really do all the work
  of it yourselves?"</p>

  <p>"Yes; I think that is half the fun of a garden. Roy is out here early and
  late and he does all the hard work. But how did you know? Did uncle tell
  you?"</p>

  <p>"No; you told me yourself."</p>

  <p>"I? Really?"</p>

  <p>"Indirectly. You were scorning the proffered services of a horticultural
  mercenary at the moment of my arrival."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I remember," she laughed. "It was Irons, of course. He is a great
  nuisance, he is so stupidly persistent. For some weeks now he has been coming
  time after time, trying to persuade me to engage him. Once when we were all
  out he had actually got into the garden and was on the point of beginning
  work when I returned. He said he saw the milkmen and the grocers leaving
  samples at the door so he thought that he would too!"</p>

  <p>"A practical jester evidently. Is Mr Irons a local character?"</p>

  <p>"He said that he knew the ground and the conditions round about here
  better than anyone else in Groat's Heath," she replied. "Modesty is not among
  Mr Irons's handicaps. He said that he&mdash;&mdash;How curious!"</p>

  <p>"What is, Mrs Bellmark?"</p>

  <p>"I never connected the two men before, but he said that he had been
  gardener at Fountain Court for seven years."</p>

  <p>"Another family retainer who is evidently attached to the soil."</p>

  <p>"At all events they have not prospered equally, for while Mr Johns seems
  able to take a nice house, poor Irons is willing to work for half-a-crown a
  day, and I am told that all the other men charge four shillings."</p>

  <p>They had paced the boundaries of the kitchen garden, and as there was
  nothing more to be shown Elsie Bellmark led the way back to the drawing-room.
  Parkinson was still engrossed in his book, the only change being that his
  back was now turned towards the high paling of clinker-built oak that
  separated the two gardens.</p>

  <p>"I will speak to my man," said Carrados, turning aside.</p>

  <p>"He hurried down and is looking through the fence, sir," reported the
  watcher.</p>

  <p>"That will do then. You can return to the car."</p>

  <p>"I wonder if you would allow me to send you a small hawthorn-tree?"
  inquired Carrados among his felicitations over the teacups five minutes
  later. "I think it ought to be in every garden."</p>

  <p>"Thank you&mdash;but is it worth while?" replied Mrs Bellmark, with a
  touch of restraint. As far as mere words went she had been willing to ignore
  the menace of the future, but in the circumstances the offer seemed
  singularly inept and she began to suspect that outside his peculiar gifts the
  wonderful Mr Carrados might be a little bit obtuse after all.</p>

  <p>"Yes; I think it is," he replied, with quiet assurance.</p>

  <p>"In spite of&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"I am not forgetting that unless your husband is prepared on Monday next
  to invest one thousand pounds you contemplate leaving here."</p>

  <p>"Then I do not understand it, Mr Carrados."</p>

  <p>"And I am unable to explain as yet. But I brought you a note from Louis
  Carlyle, Mrs Bellmark. You only glanced at it. Will you do me the favour of
  reading me the last paragraph?"</p>

  <p>She picked up the letter from the table where it lay and complied with
  cheerful good-humour.</p>

  <p>"There is some suggestion that you want me to accede to," she guessed
  cunningly when she had read the last few words.</p>

  <p>"There are some three suggestions which I hope you will accede to," he
  replied. "In the first place I want you to write to Mr Johns next
  door&mdash;let him get the letter to-night&mdash;inquiring whether he is
  still disposed to take this house."</p>

  <p>"I had thought of doing that shortly."</p>

  <p>"Then that is all right. Besides, he will ultimately decline."</p>

  <p>"Oh," she exclaimed&mdash;it would be difficult to say whether with relief
  or disappointment&mdash;"do you think so? Then why&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"To keep him quiet in the meantime. Next I should like you to send a
  little note to Mr Irons&mdash;your maid could deliver it also to-night, I
  dare say?"</p>

  <p>"Irons! Irons the gardener?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," apologetically. "Only a line or two, you know. Just saying that,
  after all, if he cares to come on Monday you can find him a few days'
  work."</p>

  <p>"But in any circumstances I don't want him."</p>

  <p>"No; I can quite believe that you could do better. Still, it doesn't
  matter, as he won't come, Mrs Bellmark; not for half-a-crown a day, believe
  me. But the thought will tend to make Mr Irons less restive also. Lastly,
  will you persuade your husband not to decline his firm's offer until
  Monday?"</p>

  <p>"Very well, Mr Carrados," she said, after a moment's consideration. "You
  are Uncle Louis's friend and therefore our friend. I will do what you
  ask."</p>

  <p>"Thank you," said Carrados. "I shall endeavour not to disappoint you."</p>

  <p>"I shall not be disappointed because I have not dared to hope. And I have
  nothing to expect because I am still completely in the dark."</p>

  <p>"I have been there for nearly twenty years, Mrs Bellmark."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I am sorry!" she cried impulsively.</p>

  <p>"So am I&mdash;occasionally," he replied. "Good-bye, Mrs Bellmark. You
  will hear from me shortly, I hope. About the hawthorn, you know."</p>

  <p>It was, indeed, in something less than forty-eight hours that she heard
  from him again. When Bellmark returned to his toy villa early on Saturday
  afternoon Elsie met him almost at the gate with a telegram in her hand.</p>

  <p>"I really think, Roy, that everyone we have to do with here goes mad," she
  exclaimed, in tragi-humorous despair. "First it was Mr Johns or
  Jones&mdash;if he is Johns or Jones&mdash;and then Irons who wanted to work
  here for half of what he could get at heaps of places about, and now just
  look at this wire that came from Mr Carrados half-an-hour ago."</p>

  <p>This was the message that he read:</p><br>

  <p class="letter"><i>Please procure sardine tin opener mariner's compass and
  bottle of champagne. Shall arrive 6.45 bringing Crataegus
  Coccinea.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Carrados</span>.</p><br>

  <p>"Could anything be more absurd?" she demanded.</p>

  <p>"Sounds as though it was in code," speculated her husband. "Who's the
  foreign gentleman he's bringing?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, that's a kind of special hawthorn&mdash;I looked it up. But a bottle
  of champagne, and a compass, and a sardine tin opener! What possible
  connexion is there between them?"</p>

  <p>"A very resourceful man might uncork a bottle of champagne with a sardine
  tin opener," he suggested.</p>

  <p>"And find his way home afterwards by means of a mariner's compass?" she
  retorted. "No, Roy dear, you are not a sleuth-hound. We had better have our
  lunch."</p>

  <p>They lunched, but if the subject of Carrados had been tabooed the meal
  would have been a silent one.</p>

  <p>"I have a compass on an old watch-chain somewhere," volunteered
  Bellmark.</p>

  <p>"And I have a tin opener in the form of a bull's head," contributed
  Elsie.</p>

  <p>"But we have no champagne, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"How could we have, Roy? We never have had any. Shall you mind going down
  to the shops for a bottle?"</p>

  <p>"You really think that we ought?"</p>

  <p>"Of course we must, Roy. We don't know what mightn't happen if we didn't.
  Uncle Louis said that they once failed to stop a jewel robbery because the
  jeweller neglected to wipe his shoes on the shop doormat, as Mr Carrados had
  told him to do. Suppose Johns is a desperate anarchist and he succeeded in
  blowing up Buckingham Palace because we&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"All right. A small bottle, eh?"</p>

  <p>"No. A large one. Quite a large one. Don't you see how exciting it is
  becoming?"</p>

  <p>"If you are excited already you don't need much champagne," argued her
  husband.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless he strolled down to the leading wine-shop after lunch and
  returned with his purchase modestly draped in the light summer overcoat that
  he carried on his arm. Elsie Bellmark, who had quite abandoned her previous
  unconcern, in the conviction that "something was going to happen," spent the
  longest afternoon that she could remember, and even Bellmark, in spite of his
  continual adjurations to her to "look at the matter logically," smoked five
  cigarettes in place of his usual Saturday afternoon pipe and neglected to do
  any gardening.</p>

  <p>At exactly six-forty-five a motor car was heard approaching. Elsie made a
  desperate rally to become the self-possessed hostess again. Bellmark was
  favourably impressed by such marked punctuality. Then a Regent Street
  delivery van bowled past their window and Elsie almost wept.</p>

  <p>The suspense was not long, however. Less than five minutes later another
  vehicle raised the dust of the quiet suburban road, and this time a private
  car stopped at their gate.</p>

  <p>"Can you see any policemen inside?" whispered Elsie.</p>

  <p>Parkinson got down and opening the door took out a small tree which he
  carried up to the porch and there deposited. Carrados followed.</p>

  <p>"At all events there isn't much wrong," said Bellmark. "He's smiling all
  the time."</p>

  <p>"No, it isn't really a smile," explained Elsie; "it's his normal
  expression."</p>

  <p>She went out into the hall just as the front door was opened.</p>

  <p>"It is the 'Scarlet-fruited thorn' of North America," Bellmark heard the
  visitor remarking. "Both the flowers and the berries are wonderfully good. Do
  you think that you would permit me to choose the spot for it, Mrs
  Bellmark?"</p>

  <p>Bellmark joined them in the hall and was introduced.</p>

  <p>"We mustn't waste any time," he suggested. "There is very little light
  left."</p>

  <p>"True," agreed Carrados. "And Coccinea requires deep digging."</p>

  <p>They walked through the house, and turning to the right passed into the
  region of the vegetable garden. Carrados and Elsie led the way, the blind man
  carrying the tree, while Bellmark went to his outhouse for the required
  tools.</p>

  <p>"We will direct our operations from here," said Carrados, when they were
  half-way along the walk. "You told me of a thin iron pipe that you had traced
  to somewhere in the middle of the garden. We must locate the end of it
  exactly."</p>

  <p>"My rosary!" sighed Elsie, with premonition of disaster, when she had
  determined the spot as exactly as she could. "Oh, Mr Carrados!"</p>

  <p>"I am sorry, but it might be worse," said Carrados inflexibly. "We only
  require to find the elbow-joint. Mr Bellmark will investigate with as little
  disturbance as possible."</p>

  <p>For five minutes Bellmark made trials with a pointed iron. Then he cleared
  away the soil of a small circle and at about a foot deep exposed a broken
  inch pipe.</p>

  <p>"The fountain," announced Carrados, when he had examined it. "You have the
  compass, Mr Bellmark?"</p>

  <p>"Rather a small one," admitted Bellmark.</p>

  <p>"Never mind, you are a mathematician. I want you to strike a line due
  east."</p>

  <p>The reel and cord came into play and an adjustment was finally made from
  the broken pipe to a position across the vegetable garden.</p>

  <p>"Now a point nine yards, nine feet and nine inches along it."</p>

  <p>"My onion bed!" cried Elsie tragically.</p>

  <p>"Yes; it is really serious this time," agreed Carrados. "I want a hole a
  yard across, digging here. May we proceed?"</p>

  <p>Elsie remembered the words of her uncle's letter&mdash;or what she
  imagined to be his letter&mdash;and possibly the preamble of selecting the
  spot had impressed her.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I suppose so. Unless," she added hopefully, "the turnip bed will do
  instead? They are not sown yet."</p>

  <p>"I am afraid that nowhere else in the garden will do," replied
  Carrados.</p>

  <p>Bellmark delineated the space and began to dig. After clearing to about a
  foot deep he paused.</p>

  <p>"About deep enough, Mr Carrados?" he inquired.</p>

  <p>"Oh, dear no," replied the blind man.</p>

  <p>"I am two feet down," presently reported the digger.</p>

  <p>"Deeper!" was the uncompromising response.</p>

  <p>Another six inches were added and Bellmark stopped to rest.</p>

  <p>"A little more and it won't matter which way up we plant Coccinea," he
  remarked.</p>

  <p>"That is the depth we are aiming for," replied Carrados.</p>

  <p>Elsie and her husband exchanged glances. Then Bellmark drove his spade
  through another layer of earth.</p>

  <p>"Three feet," he announced, when he had cleared it.</p>

  <p>Carrados advanced to the very edge of the opening.</p>

  <p>"I think that if you would loosen another six inches with the fork we
  might consider the ground prepared," he decided.</p>

  <p>Bellmark changed his tools and began to break up the soil. Presently the
  steel prongs grated on some obstruction.</p>

  <p>"Gently," directed the blind watcher. "I think you will find a half-pound
  cocoa tin at the end of your fork."</p>

  <p>"Well, how on earth you spotted that&mdash;&mdash;!" was wrung from
  Bellmark admiringly, as he cleared away the encrusting earth. "But I believe
  you are about right." He threw up the object to his wife, who was risking a
  catastrophe in her eagerness to miss no detail. "Anything in it besides soil,
  Elsie?"</p>

  <p>"She cannot open it yet," remarked Carrados. "It is soldered down."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I say," protested Bellmark.</p>

  <p>"It is perfectly correct, Roy. The lid is soldered on."</p>

  <p>They looked at each other in varying degrees of wonder and speculation.
  Only Carrados seemed quite untouched.</p>

  <p>"Now we may as well replace the earth," he remarked.</p>

  <p>"Fill it all up again?" asked Bellmark.</p>

  <p>"Yes; we have provided a thoroughly disintegrated subsoil. That is the
  great thing. A depth of six inches is sufficient merely for the roots."</p>

  <p>There was only one remark passed during the operation.</p>

  <p>"I think I should plant the tree just over where the tin was," Carrados
  suggested. "You might like to mark the exact spot." And there the hawthorn
  was placed.</p>

  <p>Bellmark, usually the most careful and methodical of men, left the tools
  where they were, in spite of a threatening shower. Strangely silent, Elsie
  led the way back to the house and taking the men into the drawing-room
  switched on the light.</p>

  <p>"I think you have a tin opener, Mrs Bellmark?"</p>

  <p>Elsie, who had been waiting for him to speak, almost jumped at the simple
  inquiry. Then she went into the next room and returned with the bull-headed
  utensil.</p>

  <p>"Here it is," she said, in a voice that would have amused her at any other
  time.</p>

  <p>"Mr Bellmark will perhaps disclose our find."</p>

  <p>Bellmark put the soily tin down on Elsie's best table-cover without
  eliciting a word of reproach, grasped it firmly with his left hand, and
  worked the opener round the top.</p>

  <p>"Only paper!" he exclaimed, and without touching the contents he passed
  the tin into Carrados's hands.</p>

  <p>The blind man dexterously twirled out a little roll that crinkled
  pleasantly to the ear, and began counting the leaves with a steady
  finger.</p>

  <p>"They're bank-notes!" whispered Elsie in an awestruck voice. She caught
  sight of a further detail. "Bank-notes for a hundred pounds each. And there
  are dozens of them!"</p>

  <p>"Fifty, there should be," dropped Carrados between his figures.
  "Twenty-five, twenty-six&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Good God," murmured Bellmark; "that's five thousand pounds!"</p>

  <p>"Fifty," concluded Carrados, straightening the edges of the sheaf. "It is
  always satisfactory to find that one's calculations are exact." He detached
  the upper ten notes and held them out. "Mrs Bellmark, will you accept one
  thousand pounds as a full legal discharge of any claim that you may have on
  this property?"</p>

  <p>"Me&mdash;I?" she stammered. "But I have no right to any in any
  circumstances. It has nothing to do with us."</p>

  <p>"You have an unassailable moral right to a fair proportion, because
  without you the real owners would never have seen a penny of it. As regards
  your legal right"&mdash;he took out the thin pocket-book and extracting a
  business-looking paper spread it open on the table before them&mdash;"here is
  a document that concedes it. 'In consideration of the valuable services
  rendered by Elsie Bellmark, etc., etc., in causing to be discovered and
  voluntarily surrendering the sum of five thousand pounds deposited and not
  relinquished by Alexis Metrobe, late of, etc., etc., deceased, Messrs
  Binstead &amp; Polegate, solicitors, of 77a Bedford Row, acting on behalf of
  the administrator and next-of-kin of the said etc., etc., do
  hereby'&mdash;well, that's what they do. Signed, witnessed and stamped at
  Somerset House."</p>

  <p>"I suppose I shall wake presently," said Elsie dreamily.</p>

  <p>"It was for this moment that I ventured to suggest the third requirement
  necessary to bring our enterprise to a successful end," said Carrados.</p>

  <p>"Oh, how thoughtful of you!" cried Elsie. "Roy, the champagne."</p>

  <p>Five minutes later Carrados was explaining to a small but enthralled
  audience.</p>

  <p>"The late Alexis Metrobe was a man of peculiar character. After seeing a
  good deal of the world and being many things, he finally embraced
  spiritualism, and in common with some of its most pronounced adherents he
  thenceforward abandoned what we should call 'the common-sense view.'</p>

  <p>"A few years ago, by the collation of the Book of Revelations, a set of
  Zadkiel's Almanacs, and the complete works of Mrs Mary Baker Eddy, Metrobe
  discovered that the end of the world would take place on the tenth of October
  1910. It therefore became a matter of urgent importance in his mind to ensure
  pecuniary provision for himself for the time after the catastrophe had taken
  place."</p>

  <p>"I don't understand," interrupted Elsie. "Did he expect to survive
  it?"</p>

  <p>"You cannot understand, Mrs Bellmark, because it is fundamentally
  incomprehensible. We can only accept the fact by the light of cases which
  occasionally obtain prominence. Metrobe did not expect to survive, but he was
  firmly convinced that the currency of this world would be equally useful in
  the spirit-land into which he expected to pass. This view was encouraged by a
  lady medium at whose feet he sat. She kindly offered to transmit to his
  banking account in the Hereafter, without making any charge whatever, any sum
  that he cared to put into her hands for the purpose. Metrobe accepted the
  idea but not the offer. His plan was to deposit a considerable amount in a
  spot of which he alone had knowledge, so that he could come and help himself
  to it as required."</p>

  <p>"But if the world had come to an end&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"Only the material world, you must understand, Mrs Bellmark. The spirit
  world, its exact impalpable counterpart, would continue as before and
  Metrobe's hoard would be spiritually intact and available. That is the
  prologue.</p>

  <p>"About a month ago there appeared a certain advertisement in a good many
  papers. I noticed it at the time and three days ago I had only to refer to my
  files to put my hand on it at once. It reads:</p><br>

  <p class="letter">"'Alexis Metrobe. Any servant or personal attendant of the
  late Alexis Metrobe of Fountain Court, Groat's Heath, possessing special
  knowledge of his habits and movements may hear of something advantageous on
  applying to Binstead &amp; Polegate, 77a Bedford Row, W.C.'</p><br>

  <p>"The solicitors had, in fact, discovered that five thousand pounds' worth
  of securities had been realized early in 1910. They readily ascertained that
  Metrobe had drawn that amount in gold out of his bank immediately after, and
  there the trace ended. He died six months later. There was no hoard of gold
  and not a shred of paper to show where it had gone, yet Metrobe lived very
  simply within his income. The house had meanwhile been demolished but there
  was no hint or whisper of any lucky find.</p>

  <p>"Two inquirers presented themselves at 77a Bedford Row. They were informed
  of the circumstances and offered a reward, varying according to the results,
  for information that would lead to the recovery of the money. They are both
  described as thoughtful, slow-spoken men. Each heard the story, shook his
  head, and departed. The first caller proved to be John Foster, the ex-butler.
  On the following day Mr Irons, formerly gardener at the Court, was the
  applicant.</p>

  <p>"I must now divert your attention into a side track. In the summer of 1910
  Metrobe published a curious work entitled 'The Flame beyond the Dome.' In the
  main it is an eschatological treatise, but at the end he tacked on an
  epilogue, which he called 'The Fable of the Chameleon.' It is even more
  curious than the rest and with reason, for under the guise of a speculative
  essay he gives a cryptic account of the circumstances of the five thousand
  pounds and, what is more important, details the exact particulars of its
  disposal. His reason for so doing is characteristic of the man. He was
  conscious by experience that he possessed an utterly treacherous memory, and
  having had occasion to move the treasure from one spot to another he feared
  that when the time came his bemuddled shade would be unable to locate it. For
  future reference, therefore, he embodied the details in his book, and to make
  sure that plenty of copies should be in existence he circulated it by the
  only means in his power&mdash;in other words, he gave a volume to everyone he
  knew and to a good many people whom he didn't.</p>

  <p>"So far I have dealt with actualities. The final details are partly
  speculative but they are essentially correct. Metrobe conveyed his gold to
  Fountain Court, obtained a stout oak coffer for it, and selected a spot
  <i>west</i> of the fountain. He chose a favourable occasion for burying it,
  but by some mischance Irons came on the scene. Metrobe explained the incident
  by declaring that he was burying a favourite parrot. Irons thought nothing
  particular about it then, although he related the fact to the butler, and to
  others, in evidence of the general belief that 'the old cock was quite
  barmy.' But Metrobe himself was much disturbed by the accident. A few days
  later he dug up the box. In pursuance of his new plan he carried his gold to
  the Bank of England and changed it into these notes. Then transferring the
  venue to one due <i>east</i> of the fountain, he buried them in this tin,
  satisfied that the small space it occupied would baffle the search of anyone
  not in possession of the exact location."</p>

  <p>"But, I say!" exclaimed Mr Bellmark. "Gold might remain gold, but what
  imaginable use could be made of bank-notes after the end of the world?"</p>

  <p>"That is a point of view, no doubt. But Metrobe, in spite of his foreign
  name, was a thorough Englishman. The world might come to an end, but he was
  satisfied that somehow the Bank of England would ride through it all right. I
  only suggest that. There is much that we can only guess."</p>

  <p>"That is all there is to know, Mr Carrados?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Everything comes to an end, Mrs Bellmark. I sent my car away to call
  for me at eight. Eight has struck. That is Harris announcing his
  arrival."</p>

  <p>He stood up, but embarrassment and indecision marked the looks and
  movements of the other two.</p>

  <p>"How can we possibly take all this money, though?" murmured Elsie, in
  painful uncertainty. "It is entirely your undertaking, Mr Carrados. It is the
  merest fiction bringing me into it at all."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps in the circumstances," suggested Bellmark nervously&mdash;"you
  remember the circumstances, Elsie?&mdash;Mr Carrados would be willing to
  regard it as a loan&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No, no!" cried Elsie impulsively. "There must be no half measures. We
  know that a thousand pounds would be nothing to Mr Carrados, and he knows
  that a thousand pounds are everything to us." Her voice reminded the blind
  man of the candle-snuffing recital. "We will take this great gift, Mr
  Carrados, quite freely, and we will not spoil the generous satisfaction that
  you must have in doing a wonderful and a splendid service by trying to hedge
  our obligation."</p>

  <p>"But what can we ever do to thank Mr Carrados?" faltered Bellmark
  mundanely.</p>

  <p>"Nothing," said Elsie simply. "That is it."</p>

  <p>"But I think that Mrs Bellmark has quite solved that," interposed
  Carrados.</p>

     name="story8"></a>VIII. &mdash; THE GAME PLAYED IN THE DARK</h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The News Of The World</i>, Dec 28, 1913</h3>

  <p class="first">"It's a funny thing, sir," said Inspector Beedel, regarding
  Mr Carrados with the pensive respect that he always extended towards the
  blind amateur, "it's a funny thing, but nothing seems to go on abroad now but
  what you'll find some trace of it here in London if you take the trouble to
  look."</p>

  <p>"In the right quarter," contributed Carrados.</p>

  <p>"Why, yes," agreed the inspector. "But nothing comes of it nine times out
  of ten, because it's no one's particular business to look here or the thing's
  been taken up and finished from the other end. I don't mean ordinary murders
  or single-handed burglaries, of course, but"&mdash;a modest ring of
  professional pride betrayed the quiet enthusiast&mdash;"real First-Class
  Crimes."</p>

  <p>"The State Antonio Five per cent. Bond Coupons?" suggested Carrados.</p>

  <p>"Ah, you are right, Mr Carrados." Beedel shook his head sadly, as though
  perhaps on that occasion someone ought to have looked. "A man has a fit in
  the inquiry office of the Agent-General for British Equatoria, and two
  hundred and fifty thousand pounds' worth of faked securities is the result in
  Mexico. Then look at that jade fylfot charm pawned for one-and-three down at
  the Basin and the use that could have been made of it in the Kharkov 'ritual
  murder' trial."</p>

  <p>"The West Hampstead Lost Memory puzzle and the Baripur bomb conspiracy
  that might have been smothered if one had known."</p>

  <p>"Quite true, sir. And the three children of that Chicago
  millionaire&mdash;Cyrus V. Bunting, wasn't it?&mdash;kidnapped in broad
  daylight outside the New York Lyric and here, three weeks later, the dumb
  girl who chalked the wall at Charing Cross. I remember reading once in a
  financial article that every piece of foreign gold had a string from it
  leading to Threadneedle Street. A figure of speech, sir, of course, but apt
  enough, I don't doubt. Well, it seems to me that every big crime done abroad
  leaves a finger-print here in London&mdash;if only, as you say, we look in
  the right quarter."</p>

  <p>"And at the right moment," added Carrados. "The time is often the present;
  the place the spot beneath our very noses. We take a step and the chance has
  gone for ever."</p>

  <p>The inspector nodded and contributed a weighty monosyllable of sympathetic
  agreement. The most prosaic of men in the pursuit of his ordinary duties, it
  nevertheless subtly appealed to some half-dormant streak of vanity to have
  his profession taken romantically when there was no serious work on hand.</p>

  <p>"No; perhaps not 'for ever' in one case in a thousand, after all," amended
  the blind man thoughtfully. "This perpetual duel between the Law and the
  Criminal has sometimes appeared to me in the terms of a game of cricket,
  inspector. Law is in the field; the Criminal at the wicket. If Law makes a
  mistake&mdash;sends down a loose ball or drops a catch&mdash;the Criminal
  scores a little or has another lease of life. But if <i>he</i> makes a
  mistake&mdash;if he lets a straight ball pass or spoons towards a steady
  man&mdash;he is done for. His mistakes are fatal; those of the Law are only
  temporary and retrievable."</p>

  <p>"Very good, sir," said Mr Beedel, rising&mdash;the conversation had taken
  place in the study at The Turrets, where Beedel had found occasion to present
  himself&mdash;"very apt indeed. I must remember that. Well, sir, I only hope
  that this 'Guido the Razor' lot will send a catch in our direction."</p>

  <p>The 'this' delicately marked Inspector Beedel's instinctive contempt for
  Guido. As a craftsman he was compelled, on his reputation, to respect him,
  and he had accordingly availed himself of Carrados's friendship for a
  confabulation. As a man&mdash;he was a foreigner: worse, an Italian, and if
  left to his own resources the inspector would have opposed to his sinuous
  flexibility those rigid, essentially Britannia-metal, methods of the Force
  that strike the impartial observer as so ponderous, so amateurish and
  conventional, and, it must be admitted, often so curiously and inexplicably
  successful.</p>

  <p>The offence that had circuitously brought "il Rasojo" and his "lot" within
  the cognizance of Scotland Yard outlines the kind of story that is discreetly
  hinted at by the society paragraphist of the day, politely disbelieved by the
  astute reader, and then at last laid indiscreetly bare in all its details by
  the inevitable princessly "Recollections" of a generation later. It centred
  round an impending royal marriage in Vienna, a certain jealous "Countess X."
  (here you have the discretion of the paragrapher), and a document or two that
  might be relied upon (the aristocratic biographer will impartially sum up the
  contingencies) to play the deuce with the approaching nuptials. To procure
  the evidence of these papers the Countess enlisted the services of Guido, as
  reliable a scoundrel as she could probably have selected for the commission.
  To a certain point&mdash;to the abstraction of the papers, in fact&mdash;he
  succeeded, but it was with pursuit close upon his heels. There was that
  disadvantage in employing a rogue to do work that implicated roguery, for
  whatever moral right the Countess had to the property, her accomplice had no
  legal right whatever to his liberty. On half-a-dozen charges at least he
  could be arrested on sight in as many capitals of Europe. He slipped out of
  Vienna by the Nordbahn with his destination known, resourcefully stopped the
  express outside Czaslau and got away across to Chrudim. By this time the game
  and the moves were pretty well understood in more than one keenly interested
  quarter. Diplomacy supplemented justice and the immediate history of Guido
  became that of a fox hunted from covert to covert with all the familiar
  earths stopped against him. From Pardubitz he passed on to Glatz, reached
  Breslau and went down the Oder to Stettin. Out of the liberality of his
  employer's advances he had ample funds to keep going, and he dropped and
  rejoined his accomplices as the occasion ruled. A week's harrying found him
  in Copenhagen, still with no time to spare, and he missed his purpose there.
  He crossed to Malmo by ferry, took the connecting night train to Stockholm
  and the same morning sailed down the Saltsjon, ostensibly bound for Obo,
  intending to cross to Revel and so get back to central Europe by the less
  frequented routes. But in this move again luck was against him and receiving
  warning just in time, and by the mysterious agency that had so far protected
  him, he contrived to be dropped from the steamer by boat among the islands of
  the crowded Archipelago, made his way to Helsingfors and within forty-eight
  hours was back again on the Frihavnen with pursuit for the moment blinked and
  a breathing-time to the good.</p>

  <p>To appreciate the exact significance of these wanderings it is necessary
  to recall the conditions. Guido was not zigzagging a course about Europe in
  an aimless search for the picturesque, still less inspired by any love of the
  melodramatic. To him every step was vital, each tangent or rebound the
  necessary outcome of his much-badgered plans. In his pocket reposed the
  papers for which he had run grave risks. The price agreed upon for the
  service was sufficiently lavish to make the risks worth taking time after
  time; but in order to consummate the transaction it was necessary that the
  booty should be put into his employer's hand. Half-way across Europe that
  employer was waiting with such patience as she could maintain, herself
  watched and shadowed at every step. The Countess X. was sufficiently exalted
  to be personally immune from the high-handed methods of her country's secret
  service, but every approach to her was tapped. The problem was for Guido to
  earn a long enough respite to enable him to communicate his position to the
  Countess and for her to go or to reach him by a trusty hand. Then the whole
  fabric of intrigue could fall to pieces, but so far Guido had been kept
  successfully on the run and in the meanwhile time was pressing.</p>

  <p>"They lost him after the <i>Hutola</i>," Beedel reported, in explaining
  the circumstances to Max Carrados. "Three days later they found that he'd
  been back again in Copenhagen but by that time he'd flown. Now they're
  without a trace except the inference of these 'Orange peach blossom' agonies
  in <i>The Times</i>. But the Countess has gone hurriedly to Paris; and
  Lafayard thinks it all points to London."</p>

  <p>"I suppose the Foreign Office is anxious to oblige just now?"</p>

  <p>"I expect so, sir," agreed Beedel, "but, of course, my instructions don't
  come from that quarter. What appeals to <i>us</i> is that it would be a
  feather in our caps&mdash;they're still a little sore up at the Yard about
  Hans the Piper."</p>

  <p>"Naturally," assented Carrados. "Well, I'll see what I can do if there is
  real occasion. Let me know anything, and, if you see your chance yourself,
  come round for a talk if you like on&mdash;to-day's Wednesday?&mdash;I shall
  be in at any rate on Friday evening."</p>

  <p>Without being a precisian, the blind man was usually exact in such
  matters. There are those who hold that an engagement must be kept at all
  hazard: men who would miss a death-bed message in order to keep literal faith
  with a beggar. Carrados took lower, if more substantial, ground. "My word,"
  he sometimes had occasion to remark, "is subject to contingencies, like
  everything else about me. If I make a promise it is conditional on nothing
  which seems more important arising to counteract it. That, among men of
  sense, is understood." And, as it happened, something did occur on this
  occasion.</p>

  <p>He was summoned to the telephone just before dinner on Friday evening to
  receive a message personally. Greatorex, his secretary, had taken the call,
  but came in to say that the caller would give him nothing beyond his
  name&mdash;Brebner. The name was unknown to Carrados, but such incidents were
  not uncommon, and he proceeded to comply.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he responded; "I am Max Carrados speaking. What is it?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, it is you, sir, is it? Mr Brickwill told me to get to you
  direct."</p>

  <p>"Well, you are all right. Brickwill? Are you the British Museum?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I am Brebner in the Chaldean Art Department. They are in a great
  stew here. We have just found out that someone has managed to get access to
  the Second Inner Greek Room and looted some of the cabinets there. It is all
  a mystery as yet."</p>

  <p>"What is missing?" asked Carrados.</p>

  <p>"So far we can only definitely speak of about six trays of Greek
  coins&mdash;a hundred to a hundred and twenty, roughly."</p>

  <p>"Important?"</p>

  <p>The line conveyed a caustic bark of tragic amusement.</p>

  <p>"Why, yes, I should say so. The beggar seems to have known his business.
  All fine specimens of the best period.
  Syracuse&mdash;Messana&mdash;Croton&mdash; Amphipolis.
  Eumenes&mdash;Evainetos&mdash;Kimons. The chief quite wept."</p>

  <p>Carrados groaned. There was not a piece among them that he had not handled
  lovingly.</p>

  <p>"What are you doing?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"Mr Brickwill has been to Scotland Yard, and, on advice, we are not making
  it public as yet. We don't want a hint of it to be dropped anywhere, if you
  don't mind, sir."</p>

  <p>"That will be all right."</p>

  <p>"It was for that reason that I was to speak with you personally. We are
  notifying the chief dealers and likely collectors to whom the coins, or some
  of them, may be offered at once if it is thought that we haven't found it out
  yet. Judging from the expertness displayed in the selection, we don't think
  that there is any danger of the lot being sold to a pawnbroker or a
  metal-dealer, so that we are running very little real risk in not advertising
  the loss."</p>

  <p>"Yes; probably it is as well," replied Carrados. "Is there anything that
  Mr Brickwill wishes me to do?"</p>

  <p>"Only this, sir; if you are offered a suspicious lot of Greek coins, or
  hear of them, would you have a look&mdash;I mean ascertain whether they are
  likely to be ours, and if you think they are communicate with us and Scotland
  Yard at once."</p>

  <p>"Certainly," replied the blind man. "Tell Mr Brickwill that he can rely on
  me if any indication comes my way. Convey my regrets to him and tell him that
  I feel the loss quite as a personal one.... I don't think that you and I have
  met as yet, Mr Brebner?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir," said the voice diffidently, "but I have looked forward to the
  pleasure. Perhaps this unfortunate business will bring me an
  introduction."</p>

  <p>"You are very kind," was Carrados's acknowledgment of the compliment. "Any
  time ... I was going to say that perhaps you don't know my weakness, but I
  have spent many pleasant hours over your wonderful collection. That ensures
  the personal element. Good-bye."</p>

  <p>Carrados was really disturbed by the loss although his concern was
  tempered by the reflection that the coins would inevitably in the end find
  their way back to the Museum. That their restitution might involve ransom to
  the extent of several thousand pounds was the least poignant detail of the
  situation. The one harrowing thought was that the booty might, through stress
  or ignorance, find its way into the melting-pot. That dreadful contingency,
  remote but insistent, was enough to affect the appetite of the blind
  enthusiast.</p>

  <p>He was expecting Inspector Beedel, who would be full of his own case, but
  he could not altogether dismiss the aspects of possibility that Brebner's
  communication opened before his mind. He was still concerned with the chances
  of destruction and a very indifferent companion for Greatorex, who alone sat
  with him, when Parkinson presented himself. Dinner was over but Carrados had
  remained rather longer than his custom, smoking his mild Turkish cigarette in
  silence.</p>

  <p>"A lady wishes to see you, sir. She said you would not know her name, but
  that her business would interest you."</p>

  <p>The form of message was sufficiently unusual to take the attention of both
  men.</p>

  <p>"You don't know her, of course, Parkinson?" inquired his master.</p>

  <p>For just a second the immaculate Parkinson seemed tongue-tied. Then he
  delivered himself in his most ceremonial strain.</p>

  <p>"I regret to say that I cannot claim the advantage, sir," he replied.</p>

  <p>"Better let me tackle her, sir," suggested Greatorex with easy confidence.
  "It's probably a sub."</p>

  <p>The sportive offer was declined by a smile and a shake of the head.
  Carrados turned to his attendant.</p>

  <p>"I shall be in the study, Parkinson. Show her there in three minutes. You
  stay and have another cigarette, Greatorex. By that time she will either have
  gone or have interested me."</p>

  <p>In three minutes' time Parkinson threw open the study door.</p>

  <p>"The lady, sir," he announced.</p>

  <p>Could he have seen, Carrados would have received the impression of a
  plainly, almost dowdily, dressed young woman of buxom figure. She wore a
  light veil, but it was ineffective in concealing the unattraction of the face
  beneath. The features were swart and the upper lip darkened with the more
  than incipient moustache of the southern brunette. Worse remained, for a
  disfiguring rash had assailed patches of her skin. As she entered she swept
  the room and its occupant with a quiet but comprehensive survey.</p>

  <p>"Please take a chair, Madame. You wished to see me?"</p>

  <p>The ghost of a demure smile flickered about her mouth as she complied, and
  in that moment her face seemed less uncomely. Her eye lingered for a moment
  on a cabinet above the desk, and one might have noticed that her eye was very
  bright. Then she replied.</p>

  <p>"You are Signor Carrados, in&mdash;in the person?"</p>

  <p>Carrados made his smiling admission and changed his position a
  fraction&mdash;possibly to catch her curiously pitched voice the better.</p>

  <p>"The great collector of the antiquities?"</p>

  <p>"I do collect a little," he admitted guardedly.</p>

  <p>"You will forgive me, Signor, if my language is not altogether good. When
  I live at Naples with my mother we let boardings, chiefly to Inglish and
  Amerigans. I pick up the words, but since I marry and go to live in Calabria
  my Inglish has gone all red&mdash;no, no, you say, rusty. Yes, that is it;
  quite rusty."</p>

  <p>"It is excellent," said Carrados. "I am sure that we shall understand one
  another perfectly."</p>

  <p>The lady shot a penetrating glance but the blind man's expression was
  merely suave and courteous. Then she continued:</p>

  <p>"My husband is of name Ferraja&mdash;Michele Ferraja. We have a vineyard
  and a little property near Forenzana." She paused to examine the tips of her
  gloves for quite an appreciable moment. "Signor," she burst out, with some
  vehemence, "the laws of my country are not good at all."</p>

  <p>"From what I hear on all sides," said Carrados, "I am afraid that your
  country is not alone."</p>

  <p>"There is at Forenzana a poor labourer, Gian Verde of name," continued the
  visitor, dashing volubly into her narrative. "He is one day digging in the
  vineyard, the vineyard of my husband, when his spade strikes itself upon an
  obstruction. 'Aha,' says Gian, 'what have we here?' and he goes down upon his
  knees to see. It is an oil jar of red earth, Signor, such as was anciently
  used, and in it is filled with silver money.</p>

  <p>"Gian is poor but he is wise. Does he call upon the authorities? No, no;
  he understands that they are all corrupt. He carries what he has found to my
  husband for he knows him to be a man of great honour.</p>

  <p>"My husband also is of brief decision. His mind is made up. 'Gian,' he
  says, 'keep your mouth shut. This will be to your ultimate profit.' Gian
  understands, for he can trust my husband. He makes a sign of mutual
  implication. Then he goes back to the spade digging.</p>

  <p>"My husband understands a little of these things but not enough. We go to
  the collections of Messina and Naples and even Rome and there we see other
  pieces of silver money, similar, and learn that they are of great value. They
  are of different sizes but most would cover a lira and of the thickness of
  two. On the one side imagine the great head of a pagan deity; on the
  other&mdash;oh, so many things I cannot remember what." A gesture of
  circumferential despair indicated the hopeless variety of design.</p>

  <p>"A biga or quadriga of mules?" suggested Carrados. "An eagle carrying off
  a hare, a figure flying with a wreath, a trophy of arms? Some of those
  perhaps?"</p>

  <p>"<i>Si, si bene</i>," cried Madame Ferraja. "You understand, I perceive,
  Signor. We are very cautious, for on every side is extortion and an unjust
  law. See, it is even forbidden to take these things out of the country, yet
  if we try to dispose of them at home they will be seized and we punished, for
  they are <i>tesoro trovato</i>, what you call treasure troven and belonging
  to the State&mdash;these coins which the industry of Gian discovered and
  which had lain for so long in the ground of my husband's vineyard."</p>

  <p>"So you brought them to England?"</p>

  <p>"<i>Si</i>, Signor. It is spoken of as a land of justice and rich nobility
  who buy these things at the highest prices. Also my speaking a little of the
  language would serve us here."</p>

  <p>"I suppose you have the coins for disposal then? You can show them to
  me?"</p>

  <p>"My husband retains them. I will take you, but you must first give
  <i>parola d'onore</i> of an English Signor not to betray us, or to speak of
  the circumstance to another."</p>

  <p>Carrados had already foreseen this eventuality and decided to accept it.
  Whether a promise exacted on the plea of treasure trove would bind him to
  respect the despoilers of the British Museum was a point for subsequent
  consideration. Prudence demanded that he should investigate the offer at once
  and to cavil over Madame Ferraja's conditions would be fatal to that object.
  If the coins were, as there seemed little reason to doubt, the proceeds of
  the robbery, a modest ransom might be the safest way of preserving
  irreplaceable treasures, and in that case Carrados could offer his services
  as the necessary intermediary.</p>

  <p>"I give you the promise you require, Madame," he accordingly declared.</p>

  <p>"It is sufficient," assented Madame. "I will now take you to the spot. It
  is necessary that you alone should accompany me, for my husband is so
  distraught in this country, where he understands not a word of what is
  spoken, that his poor spirit would cry 'We are surrounded!' if he saw two
  strangers approach the house. Oh, he is become most dreadful in his anxiety,
  my husband. Imagine only, he keeps on the fire a cauldron of molten lead and
  he would not hesitate to plunge into it this treasure and obliterate its
  existence if he imagined himself endangered."</p>

  <p>"So," speculated Carrados inwardly. "A likely precaution for a simple
  vine-grower of Calabria! Very well," he assented aloud, "I will go with you
  alone. Where is the place?"</p>

  <p>Madame Ferraja searched in the ancient purse that she discovered in her
  rusty handbag and produced a scrap of paper.</p>

  <p>"People do not understand sometimes my way of saying it," she explained.
  "<i>Sette</i>, Herringbone&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"May I&mdash;&mdash;?" said Carrados, stretching out his hand. He took the
  paper and touched the writing with his finger-tips. "Oh yes, 7 Heronsbourne
  Place. That is on the edge of Heronsbourne Park, is it not?" He transferred
  the paper casually to his desk as he spoke and stood up. "How did you come,
  Madame Ferraja?"</p>

  <p>Madame Ferraja followed the careless action with a discreet smile that did
  not touch her voice.</p>

  <p>"By motor bus&mdash;first one then another, inquiring at every turning.
  Oh, but it was interminable," sighed the lady.</p>

  <p>"My driver is off for the evening&mdash;I did not expect to be going
  out&mdash;but I will 'phone up a taxi and it will be at the gate as soon as
  we are." He despatched the message and then, turning to the house telephone,
  switched on to Greatorex.</p>

  <p>"I'm just going round to Heronsbourne Park," he explained. "Don't stay,
  Greatorex, but if anyone calls expecting to see me, they can say that I don't
  anticipate being away more than an hour."</p>

  <p>Parkinson was hovering about the hall. With quite novel officiousness he
  pressed upon his master a succession of articles that were not required. Over
  this usually complacent attendant the unattractive features of Madame Ferraja
  appeared to exercise a stealthy fascination, for a dozen times the lady
  detected his eyes questioning her face and a dozen times he looked guiltily
  away again. But his incongruities could not delay for more than a few minutes
  the opening of the door.</p>

  <p>"I do not accompany you, sir?" he inquired, with the suggestion plainly
  tendered in his voice that it would be much better if he did.</p>

  <p>"Not this time, Parkinson."</p>

  <p>"Very well, sir. Is there any particular address to which we can telephone
  in case you are required, sir?"</p>

  <p>"Mr Greatorex has instructions."</p>

  <p>Parkinson stood aside, his resources exhausted. Madame Ferraja laughed a
  little mockingly as they walked down the drive.</p>

  <p>"Your man-servant thinks I may eat you, Signor Carrados," she declared
  vivaciously.</p>

  <p>Carrados, who held the key of his usually exact attendant's
  perturbation&mdash;for he himself had recognized in Madame Ferraja the
  angelic Nina Brun, of the Sicilian tetradrachm incident, from the moment she
  opened her mouth&mdash;admitted to himself the humour of her audacity. But it
  was not until half-an-hour later that enlightenment rewarded Parkinson.
  Inspector Beedel had just arrived and was speaking with Greatorex when the
  conscientious valet, who had been winnowing his memory in solitude, broke in
  upon them, more distressed than either had ever seen him in his life before,
  and with the breathless introduction: "It was the ears, sir! I have her ears
  at last!" poured out his tale of suspicion, recognition and his present
  fears.</p>

  <p>In the meanwhile the two objects of his concern had reached the gate as
  the summoned taxicab drew up.</p>

  <p>"Seven Heronsbourne Place," called Carrados to the driver.</p>

  <p>"No, no," interposed the lady, with decision, "let him stop at the
  beginning of the street. It is not far to walk. My husband would be on the
  verge of distraction if he thought in the dark that it was the arrival of the
  police;&mdash;who knows?"</p>

  <p>"Brackedge Road, opposite the end of Heronsbourne Place," amended
  Carrados.</p>

  <p>Heronsbourne Place had the reputation, among those who were curious in
  such matters, of being the most reclusive residential spot inside the
  four-mile circle. To earn that distinction it was, needless to say, a
  cul-de-sac. It bounded one side of Heronsbourne Park but did not at any point
  of its length give access to that pleasance. It was entirely devoted to
  unostentatious little houses, something between the villa and the cottage,
  some detached and some in pairs, but all possessing the endowment of larger,
  more umbrageous gardens than can generally be secured within the radius. The
  local house agent described them as "delightfully old-world" or "completely
  modernized" according to the requirement of the applicant.</p>

  <p>The cab was dismissed at the corner and Madame Ferraja guided her
  companion along the silent and deserted way. She had begun to talk with
  renewed animation, but her ceaseless chatter only served to emphasize to
  Carrados the one fact that it was contrived to disguise.</p>

  <p>"I am not causing you to miss the house with looking after me&mdash;No. 7,
  Madame Ferraja?" he interposed.</p>

  <p>"No, certainly," she replied readily. "It is a little farther. The numbers
  are from the other end. But we are there. <i>Ecco!</i>"</p>

  <p>She stopped at a gate and opened it, still guiding him. They passed into a
  garden, moist and sweet-scented with the distillate odours of a dewy evening.
  As she turned to relatch the gate the blind man endeavoured politely to
  anticipate her. Between them his hat fell to the ground.</p>

  <p>"My clumsiness," he apologized, recovering it from the step. "My old
  impulses and my present helplessness, alas, Madame Ferraja!"</p>

  <p>"One learns prudence by experience," said Madame sagely. She was scarcely
  to know, poor lady, that even as she uttered this trite aphorism, under cover
  of darkness and his hat, Mr Carrados had just ruined his signet ring by
  blazoning a golden "7" upon her garden step to establish its identity if need
  be. A cul-de-sac that numbered from the closed end seemed to demand some
  investigation.</p>

  <p>"Seldom," he replied to her remark. "One goes on taking risks. So we are
  there?"</p>

  <p>Madame Ferraja had opened the front door with a latchkey. She dropped the
  latch and led Carrados forward along the narrow hall. The room they entered
  was at the back of the house, and from the position of the road it therefore
  overlooked the park. Again the door was locked behind them.</p>

  <p>"The celebrated Mr Carrados!" announced Madame Ferraja, with a sparkle of
  triumph in her voice. She waved her hand towards a lean, dark man who had
  stood beside the door as they entered. "My husband."</p>

  <p>"Beneath our poor roof in the most fraternal manner," commented the dark
  man, in the same derisive spirit. "But it is wonderful."</p>

  <p>"The even more celebrated Monsieur Dompierre, unless I am mistaken?"
  retorted Carrados blandly. "I bow on our first real meeting."</p>

  <p>"You knew!" exclaimed the Dompierre of the earlier incident incredulously.
  "Stoker, you were right and I owe you a hundred lire. Who recognized you,
  Nina?"</p>

  <p>"How should I know?" demanded the real Madame Dompierre crossly. "This
  blind man himself, by chance."</p>

  <p>"You pay a poor compliment to your charming wife's personality to imagine
  that one could forget her so soon," put in Carrados. "And you a Frenchman,
  Dompierre!"</p>

  <p>"You knew, Monsieur Carrados," reiterated Dompierre, "and yet you ventured
  here. You are either a fool or a hero."</p>

  <p>"An enthusiast&mdash;it is the same thing as both," interposed the lady.
  "What did I tell you? What did it matter if he recognized? You see?"</p>

  <p>"Surely you exaggerate, Monsieur Dompierre," contributed Carrados. "I may
  yet pay tribute to your industry. Perhaps I regret the circumstance and the
  necessity but I am here to make the best of it. Let me see the things Madame
  has spoken of, and then we can consider the detail of their price, either for
  myself or on behalf of others."</p>

  <p>There was no immediate reply. From Dompierre came a saturnine chuckle and
  from Madame Dompierre a titter that accompanied a grimace. For one of the
  rare occasions in his life Carrados found himself wholly out of touch with
  the atmosphere of the situation. Instinctively he turned his face towards the
  other occupant of the room, the man addressed as "Stoker," whom he knew to be
  standing near the window.</p>

  <p>"This unfortunate business <i>has</i> brought me an introduction," said a
  familiar voice.</p>

  <p>For one dreadful moment the universe stood still round Carrados. Then,
  with the crash and grind of overwhelming mental tumult, the whole strategy
  revealed itself, like the sections of a gigantic puzzle falling into place
  before his eyes.</p>

  <p>There had been no robbery at the British Museum! That plausible concoction
  was as fictitious as the intentionally transparent tale of treasure trove.
  Carrados recognized now how ineffective the one device would have been
  without the other in drawing him&mdash;how convincing the two
  together&mdash;and while smarting at the humiliation of his plight he could
  not restrain a dash of admiration at the ingenuity&mdash;the accurately
  conjectured line of inference&mdash;of the plot. It was again the familiar
  artifice of the cunning pitfall masked by the clumsily contrived trap just
  beyond it. And straightway into it he had blundered!</p>

  <p>"And this," continued the same voice, "is Carrados, Max Carrados, upon
  whose perspicuity a government&mdash;only the present government, let me in
  justice say&mdash;depends to outwit the undesirable alien! My country; O my
  country!"</p>

  <p>"Is it really Monsieur Carrados?" inquired Dompierre in polite sarcasm.
  "Are you sure, Nina, that you have not brought a man from Scotland Yard
  instead?"</p>

  <p>"<i>Basta!</i> he is here; what more do you want? Do not mock the poor
  sightless gentleman," answered Madame Dompierre, in doubtful sympathy.</p>

  <p>"That is exactly what I was wondering," ventured Carrados mildly. "I am
  here&mdash;what more do you want? Perhaps you, Mr Stoker&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"Excuse me. 'Stoker' is a mere colloquial appellation based on a trifling
  incident of my career in connection with a disabled liner. The title
  illustrates the childish weakness of the criminal classes for nicknames,
  together with their pitiable baldness of invention. My real name is
  Montmorency, Mr Carrados&mdash;Eustace Montmorency."</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Mr Montmorency," said Carrados gravely. "We are on opposite
  sides of the table here to-night, but I should be proud to have been with you
  in the stokehold of the <i>Benvenuto</i>."</p>

  <p>"That was pleasure," muttered the Englishman. "This is business."</p>

  <p>"Oh, quite so," agreed Carrados. "So far I am not exactly complaining. But
  I think it is high time to be told&mdash;and I address myself to
  you&mdash;why I have been decoyed here and what your purpose is."</p>

  <p>Mr Montmorency turned to his accomplice.</p>

  <p>"Dompierre," he remarked, with great clearness, "why the devil is Mr
  Carrados kept standing?"</p>

  <p>"Ah, oh, heaven!" exclaimed Madame Dompierre with tragic resignation, and
  flung herself down on a couch.</p>

  <p>"<i>Scusi</i>," grinned the lean man, and with burlesque grace he placed a
  chair for their guest's acceptance.</p>

  <p>"Your curiosity is natural," continued Mr Montmorency, with a cold eye
  towards Dompierre's antics, "although I really think that by this time you
  ought to have guessed the truth. In fact, I don't doubt that you have
  guessed, Mr Carrados, and that you are only endeavouring to gain time. For
  that reason&mdash;because it will perhaps convince you that we have nothing
  to fear&mdash;I don't mind obliging you."</p>

  <p>"Better hasten," murmured Dompierre uneasily.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Bill," said the Englishman, with genial effrontery. "I won't
  fail to report your intelligence to the Rasojo. Yes, Mr Carrados, as you have
  already conjectured, it is the affair of the Countess X. to which you owe
  this inconvenience. You will appreciate the compliment that underlies your
  temporary seclusion, I am sure. When circumstances favoured our plans and
  London became the inevitable place of meeting, you and you alone stood in the
  way. We guessed that you would be consulted and we frankly feared your
  intervention. You were consulted. We know that Inspector Beedel visited you
  two days ago and he has no other case in hand. Your quiescence for just three
  days had to be obtained at any cost. So here you are."</p>

  <p>"I see," assented Carrados. "And having got me here, how do you propose to
  keep me?"</p>

  <p>"Of course that detail has received consideration. In fact we secured this
  furnished house solely with that in view. There are three courses before us.
  The first, quite pleasant, hangs on your acquiescence. The second, more
  drastic, comes into operation if you decline. The third&mdash;but really, Mr
  Carrados, I hope you won't oblige me even to discuss the third. You will
  understand that it is rather objectionable for me to contemplate the
  necessity of two able-bodied men having to use even the smallest amount of
  physical compulsion towards one who is blind and helpless. I hope you will be
  reasonable and accept the inevitable."</p>

  <p>"The inevitable is the one thing that I invariably accept," replied
  Carrados. "What does it involve?"</p>

  <p>"You will write a note to your secretary explaining that what you have
  learned at 7 Heronsbourne Place makes it necessary for you to go immediately
  abroad for a few days. By the way, Mr Carrados, although this is Heronsbourne
  Place it is <i>not</i> No. 7."</p>

  <p>"Dear, dear me," sighed the prisoner. "You seem to have had me at every
  turn, Mr Montmorency."</p>

  <p>"An obvious precaution. The wider course of giving you a different street
  altogether we rejected as being too risky in getting you here. To continue:
  To give conviction to the message you will direct your man Parkinson to
  follow by the first boat-train to-morrow, with all the requirements for a
  short stay, and put up at Mascot's, as usual, awaiting your arrival
  there."</p>

  <p>"Very convincing," agreed Carrados. "Where shall I be in reality?"</p>

  <p>"In a charming though rather isolated bungalow on the south coast. Your
  wants will be attended to. There is a boat. You can row or fish. You will be
  run down by motor car and brought back to your own gate. It's really very
  pleasant for a few days. I've often stayed there myself."</p>

  <p>"Your recommendation carries weight. Suppose, for the sake of curiosity,
  that I decline?"</p>

  <p>"You will still go there but your treatment will be commensurate with your
  behaviour. The car to take you is at this moment waiting in a convenient spot
  on the other side of the park. We shall go down the garden at the back, cross
  the park, and put you into the car&mdash;anyway."</p>

  <p>"And if I resist?"</p>

  <p>The man whose pleasantry it had been to call himself Eustace Montmorency
  shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Don't be a fool," he said tolerantly. "You know who you are dealing with
  and the kind of risks we run. If you call out or endanger us at a critical
  point we shall not hesitate to silence you effectively."</p>

  <p>The blind man knew that it was no idle threat. In spite of the cloak of
  humour and fantasy thrown over the proceedings, he was in the power of coolly
  desperate men. The window was curtained and shuttered against sight and
  sound, the door behind him locked. Possibly at that moment a revolver
  threatened him; certainly weapons lay within reach of both his keepers.</p>

  <p>"Tell me what to write," he asked, with capitulation in his voice.</p>

  <p>Dompierre twirled his mustachios in relieved approval. Madame laughed from
  her place on the couch and picked up a book, watching Montmorency over the
  cover of its pages. As for that gentleman, he masked his satisfaction by the
  practical business of placing on the table before Carrados the accessories of
  the letter.</p>

  <p>"Put into your own words the message that I outlined just now."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps to make it altogether natural I had better write on a page of the
  notebook that I always use," suggested Carrados.</p>

  <p>"Do you wish to make it natural?" demanded Montmorency, with latent
  suspicion.</p>

  <p>"If the miscarriage of your plan is to result in my head being
  knocked&mdash;yes, I do," was the reply.</p>

  <p>"Good!" chuckled Dompierre, and sought to avoid Mr Montmorency's cold
  glance by turning on the electric table-lamp for the blind man's benefit.
  Madame Dompierre laughed shrilly.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Monsieur," said Carrados, "you have done quite right. What is
  light to you is warmth to me&mdash;heat, energy, inspiration. Now to
  business."</p>

  <p>He took out the pocket-book he had spoken of and leisurely proceeded to
  flatten it down upon the table before him. As his tranquil, pleasant eyes
  ranged the room meanwhile it was hard to believe that the shutters of an
  impenetrable darkness lay between them and the world. They rested for a
  moment on the two accomplices who stood beyond the table, picked out Madame
  Dompierre lolling on the sofa on his right, and measured the proportions of
  the long, narrow room. They seemed to note the positions of the window at the
  one end and the door almost at the other, and even to take into account the
  single pendent electric light which up till then had been the sole
  illuminant.</p>

  <p>"You prefer pencil?" asked Montmorency.</p>

  <p>"I generally use it for casual purposes. But not," he added, touching the
  point critically, "like this."</p>

  <p>Alert for any sign of retaliation, they watched him take an insignificant
  penknife from his pocket and begin to trim the pencil. Was there in his mind
  any mad impulse to force conclusions with that puny weapon? Dompierre worked
  his face into a fiercer expression and touched reassuringly the handle of his
  knife. Montmorency looked on for a moment, then, whistling softly to himself,
  turned his back on the table and strolled towards the window, avoiding Madame
  Nina's pursuant eye.</p>

  <p>Then, with overwhelming suddenness, it came, and in its form altogether
  unexpected.</p>

  <p>Carrados had been putting the last strokes to the pencil, whittling it
  down upon the table. There had been no hasty movement, no violent act to give
  them warning; only the little blade had pushed itself nearer and nearer to
  the electric light cord lying there ... and suddenly and instantly the room
  was plunged into absolute darkness.</p>

  <p>"To the door, Dom!" shouted Montmorency in a flash. "I am at the window.
  Don't let him pass and we are all right."</p>

  <p>"I am here," responded Dompierre from the door.</p>

  <p>"He will not attempt to pass," came the quiet voice of Carrados from
  across the room. "You are now all exactly where I want you. You are both
  covered. If either moves an inch, I fire&mdash;and remember that I shoot by
  sound, not sight."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;but what does it mean?" stammered Montmorency, above the
  despairing wail of Madame Dompierre.</p>

  <p>"It means that we are now on equal terms&mdash;three blind men in a dark
  room. The numerical advantage that you possess is counterbalanced by the fact
  that you are out of your element&mdash;I am in mine."</p>

  <p>"Dom," whispered Montmorency across the dark space, "strike a match. I
  have none."</p>

  <p>"I would not, Dompierre, if I were you," advised Carrados, with a short
  laugh. "It might be dangerous." At once his voice seemed to leap into a
  passion. "Drop that matchbox," he cried. "You are standing on the brink of
  your grave, you fool! Drop it, I say; let me hear it fall."</p>

  <p>A breath of thought&mdash;almost too short to call a pause&mdash;then a
  little thud of surrender sounded from the carpet by the door. The two
  conspirators seemed to hold their breath.</p>

  <p>"That is right." The placid voice once more resumed its sway. "Why cannot
  things be agreeable? I hate to have to shout, but you seem far from grasping
  the situation yet. Remember that I do not take the slightest risk. Also
  please remember, Mr Montmorency, that the action even of a hair-trigger
  automatic scrapes slightly as it comes up. I remind you of that for your own
  good, because if you are so ill-advised as to think of trying to pot me in
  the dark, that noise gives me a fifth of a second start of you. Do you by any
  chance know Zinghi's in Mercer Street?"</p>

  <p>"The shooting gallery?" asked Mr Montmorency a little sulkily.</p>

  <p>"The same. If you happen to come through this alive and are interested you
  might ask Zinghi to show you a target of mine that he keeps. Seven shots at
  twenty yards, the target indicated by four watches, none of them so loud as
  the one you are wearing. He keeps it as a curiosity."</p>

  <p>"I wear no watch," muttered Dompierre, expressing his thought aloud.</p>

  <p>"No, Monsieur Dompierre, but you wear a heart, and that not on your
  sleeve," said Carrados. "Just now it is quite as loud as Mr Montmorency's
  watch. It is more central too&mdash;I shall not have to allow any margin.
  That is right; breathe naturally"&mdash;for the unhappy Dompierre had given a
  gasp of apprehension. "It does not make any difference to me, and after a
  time holding one's breath becomes really painful."</p>

  <p>"Monsieur," declared Dompierre earnestly, "there was no intention of
  submitting you to injury, I swear. This Englishman did but speak within his
  hat. At the most extreme you would have been but bound and gagged. Take care:
  killing is a dangerous game."</p>

  <p>"For you&mdash;not for me," was the bland rejoinder. "If you kill me you
  will be hanged for it. If I kill you I shall be honourably acquitted. You can
  imagine the scene&mdash;the sympathetic court&mdash;the recital of your
  villainies&mdash;the story of my indignities. Then with stumbling feet and
  groping hands the helpless blind man is led forward to give evidence.
  Sensation! No, no, it isn't really fair but I can kill you both with absolute
  certainty and Providence will be saddled with all the responsibility. Please
  don't fidget with your feet, Monsieur Dompierre. I know that you aren't
  moving but one is liable to make mistakes."</p>

  <p>"Before I die," said Montmorency&mdash;and for some reason laughed
  unconvincingly in the dark&mdash;"before I die, Mr Carrados, I should really
  like to know what has happened to the light. That, surely, isn't
  Providence?"</p>

  <p>"Would it be ungenerous to suggest that you are trying to gain time? You
  ought to know what has happened. But as it may satisfy you that I have
  nothing to fear from delay, I don't mind telling you. In my hand was a sharp
  knife&mdash;contemptible, you were satisfied, as a weapon; beneath my nose
  the 'flex' of the electric lamp. It was only necessary for me to draw the one
  across the other and the system was short-circuited. Every lamp on that fuse
  is cut off and in the distributing-box in the hall you will find a burned-out
  wire. You, perhaps&mdash;but Monsieur Dompierre's experience in plating ought
  to have put him up to simple electricity."</p>

  <p>"How did you know that there is a distributing-box in the hall?" asked
  Dompierre, with dull resentment.</p>

  <p>"My dear Dompierre, why beat the air with futile questions?" replied Max
  Carrados. "What does it matter? Have it in the cellar if you like."</p>

  <p>"True," interposed Montmorency. "The only thing that need concern us
  now&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But it is in the hall&mdash;nine feet high," muttered Dompierre in
  bitterness. "Yet he, this blind man&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"The only thing that need concern us," repeated the Englishman, severely
  ignoring the interruption, "is what you intend doing in the end, Mr
  Carrados?"</p>

  <p>"The end is a little difficult to foresee," was the admission. "So far, I
  am all for maintaining the <i>status quo</i>. Will the first grey light of
  morning find us still in this impasse? No, for between us we have condemned
  the room to eternal darkness. Probably about daybreak Dompierre will drop off
  to sleep and roll against the door. I, unfortunately mistaking his intention,
  will send a bullet through&mdash;&mdash; Pardon, Madame, I should have
  remembered&mdash;but pray don't move."</p>

  <p>"I protest, Monsieur&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't protest; just sit still. Very likely it will be Mr Montmorency who
  will fall off to sleep the first after all."</p>

  <p>"Then we will anticipate that difficulty," said the one in question,
  speaking with renewed decision. "We will play the last hand with our cards
  upon the table if you like. Nina, Mr Carrados will not injure you whatever
  happens&mdash;be sure of that. When the moment comes you will
  rise&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"One word," put in Carrados with determination. "My position is precarious
  and I take no risks. As you say, I cannot injure Madame Dompierre, and you
  two men are therefore my hostages for her good behaviour. If she rises from
  the couch you, Dompierre, fall. If she advances another step Mr Montmorency
  follows you."</p>

  <p>"Do nothing rash, <i>carissima</i>," urged her husband, with passionate
  solicitude. "You might get hit in place of me. We will yet find a better
  way."</p>

  <p>"You dare not, Mr Carrados!" flung out Montmorency, for the first time
  beginning to show signs of wear in this duel of the temper. "He dare not,
  Dompierre. In cold blood and unprovoked! No jury would acquit you!"</p>

  <p>"Another who fails to do you justice, Madame Nina," said the blind man,
  with ironic gallantry. "The action might be a little high-handed, one admits,
  but when you, appropriately clothed and in your right complexion, stepped
  into the witness-box and I said: 'Gentlemen of the jury, what is my crime?
  That I made Madame Dompierre a widow!' can you doubt their gratitude and my
  acquittal? Truly my countrymen are not all bats or monks, Madame." Dompierre
  was breathing with perfect freedom now, while from the couch came the sounds
  of stifled emotion, but whether the lady was involved in a paroxysm of sobs
  or of laughter it might be difficult to swear.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">It was perhaps an hour after the flourish of the
  introduction with which Madame Dompierre had closed the door of the trap upon
  the blind man's entrance.</p>

  <p>The minutes had passed but the situation remained unchanged, though the
  ingenuity of certainly two of the occupants of the room had been tormented
  into shreds to discover a means of turning it to their advantage. So far the
  terrible omniscience of the blind man in the dark and the respect for his
  markmanship with which his coolness had inspired them, dominated the group.
  But one strong card yet remained to be played, and at last the moment came
  upon which the conspirators had pinned their despairing hopes.</p>

  <p>There was the sound of movement in the hall outside, not the first about
  the house, but towards the new complication Carrados had been strangely
  unobservant. True, Montmorency had talked rather loudly, to carry over the
  dangerous moments. But now there came an unmistakable step and to the
  accomplices it could only mean one thing. Montmorency was ready on the
  instant.</p>

  <p>"Down, Dom!" he cried, "throw yourself down! Break in, Guido. Break in the
  door. We are held up!"</p>

  <p>There was an immediate response. The door, under the pressure of a human
  battering-ram, burst open with a crash. On the threshold the
  intruders&mdash;four or five in number&mdash;stopped starkly for a moment,
  held in astonishment by the extraordinary scene that the light from the hall,
  and of their own bull's-eyes, revealed.</p>

  <p>Flat on their faces, to present the least possible surface to Carrados's
  aim, Dompierre and Montmorency lay extended beside the window and behind the
  door. On the couch, with her head buried beneath the cushions, Madame
  Dompierre sought to shut out the sight and sound of violence.
  Carrados&mdash;Carrados had not moved, but with arms resting on the table and
  fingers placidly locked together he smiled benignly on the new arrivals. His
  attitude, compared with the extravagance of those around him, gave the
  impression of a complacent modern deity presiding over some grotesque
  ceremonial of pagan worship.</p>

  <p>"So, Inspector, you could not wait for me, after all?" was his
  greeting.</p>
