<h2>The Watsons<br>
<br>
by<br>
<br>
Jane Austen</h2>
<hr>
<p class="letter">This fragment of <i>The Watsons</i> was written
in Bath on paper watermarked 1803. The work was put aside by Austen and was never finished.</p>
<hr>
<p>The first winter assembly in the town of D. in Surrey was to be
held on Tuesday, October 13th and it was generally expected to be a
very good one. A long list of county families was confidently run
over as sure of attending, and sanguine hopes were entertained that
the Osbornes themselves would be there.</p>
<p>The Edwards' invitation to the Watsons followed, of course. The
Edwards were people of fortune, who lived in the town and kept
their coach. The Watsons inhabited a village about three miles
distant, were poor, and had no close carriage; and ever since there
had been balls in the place, the former were accustomed to invite
the latter to dress, dine, and sleep at their house on every
monthly return throughout the winter.</p>
<p>On the present occasion, as only two of Mr. Watson's children
were at home, and one was always necessary as companion to himself,
for he was sickly and had lost his wife, one only could profit by
the kindness of their friends. Miss Emma Watson, who was very
recently returned to her family from the care of an aunt who had
brought her up, was to make her first public appearance in the
neighbourhood, and her eldest sister, whose delight in a ball was
not lessened by a ten years' enjoyment, had some merit in
cheerfully undertaking to drive her and all her finery in the old
chair to D. on the important morning.</p>
<p>As they splashed along the dirty lane, Miss Watson thus
instructed and cautioned her inexperienced sister:&mdash;</p>
<p>"I dare say it will be a very good ball, and among so many
officers you will hardly want partners. You will find Mrs. Edwards'
maid very willing to help you, and I would advise you to ask Mary
Edwards' opinion if you are at all at a loss, for she has a very
good taste. If Mr. Edwards does not lose his money at cards, you
will stay as late as you can wish for; if he does, he will hurry
you home perhaps&mdash; but you are sure of some comfortable soup.
I hope you will be in good looks. I should not be surprised if you
were to be thought one of the prettiest girls in the room; there is
a great deal in novelty. Perhaps Tom Musgrave may take notice of
you; but I would advise you by all means not to give him any
encouragement. He generally pays attention to every new girl; but
he is a great flirt, and never means anything serious."</p>
<p>"I think I have heard you speak of him before," said Emma; "who
is he?"</p>
<p>"A young man of very good fortune, quite independent, and
remarkably agreeable,&mdash;a universal favourite wherever he goes.
Most of the girls hereabout are in love with him, or have been. I
believe I am the only one among them that have escaped with a whole
heart; and yet I was the first he paid attention to when he came
into this country six years ago; and very great attention did he
pay me. Some people say that he has never seemed to like any girl
so well since, though he is always behaving in a particular way to
one or another."</p>
<p>"And how came your heart to be the only cold one?" said Emma,
smiling.</p>
<p>"There was a reason for that," replied Miss Watson, changing
colour, &mdash;"I have not been very well used among them, Emma. I
hope you will have better luck."</p>
<p>"Dear sister, I beg your pardon if I have unthinkingly given you
pain."</p>
<p>"When first we knew Tom Musgrave," continued Miss Watson,
without seeming to hear her, "I was very much attached to a young
man of the name of Purvis, a particular friend of Robert's, who
used to be with us a great deal. Everybody thought it would have
been a match."</p>
<p>A sigh accompanied these words, which Emma respected in silence;
but her sister after a short pause went on:</p>
<p>"You will naturally ask why it did not take place, and why he is
married to another woman, while I am still single. But you must ask
her, not me,&mdash;you must ask Penelope. Yes, Emma, Penelope was
at the bottom of it all. She thinks everything fair for a husband.
I trusted her; she set him against me, with a view of gaining him
herself, and it ended in his discontinuing his visits, and soon
after marrying somebody else. Penelope makes light of her conduct,
but I think such treachery very bad. It has been the ruin of my
happiness. I shall never love any man as I loved Purvis. I do not
think Tom Musgrave should be named with him in the same day."</p>
<p>"You quite shock me by what you say of Penelope," said Emma.
"Could a sister do such a thing? Rivalry, treachery between
sisters! I shall be afraid of being acquainted with her. But I hope
it was not so; appearances were against her."</p>
<p>"You do not know Penelope. There is nothing she would not do to
get married. She would as good as tell you so herself. Do not trust
her with any secrets of your own, take warning by me, do not trust
her; she has her good qualities, but she has no faith, no honour,
no scruples, if she can promote her own advantage. I wish with all
my heart she was well married. I declare I had rather have her well
married than myself."</p>
<p>"Than yourself! yes, I can suppose so. A heart wounded like
yours can have little inclination for matrimony."</p>
<p>"Not much indeed&mdash;but you know we must marry. I could do
very well single for my own part; a little company, and a pleasant
ball now and then, would be enough for me, if one could be young
forever; but my father cannot provide for us, and it is very bad to
grow old and be poor and laughed at. I have lost Purvis, it is
true; but very few people marry their first loves. I should not
refuse a man because he was not Purvis. Not that I can ever quite
forgive Penelope."</p>
<p>Emma shook her head in acquiescence.</p>
<p>"Penelope, however, has had her troubles," continued Miss
Watson. "She was sadly disappointed in Tom Musgrave, who afterwards
transferred his attentions from me to her, and whom she was very
fond of; but he never means anything serious, and when he had
trifled with her long enough, he began to slight her for Margaret,
and poor Penelope was very wretched. And since then she has been
trying to make some match at Chichester,&mdash;she won't tell us
with whom; but I believe it is a rich old Dr. Harding, uncle to the
friend she goes to see; and she has taken a vast deal of trouble
about him, and given up a great deal of time to no purpose as yet.
When she went away the other day, she said it should be the last
time. I suppose you did not know what her particular business was
at Chichester, nor guess at the object which could take her away
from Stanton just as you were coming home after so many years'
absence."</p>
<p>"No indeed, I had not the smallest suspicion of it. I considered
her engagement to Mrs. Shaw just at that time as very unfortunate
for me. I had hoped to find all my sisters at home, to be able to
make an immediate friend of each."</p>
<p>"I suspect the Doctor to have had an attack of the asthma, and
that she was hurried away on that account. The Shaws are quite on
her side, &mdash;at least, I believe so; but she tells me nothing.
She professes to keep her own counsel; she says, and truly enough,
that `Too many cooks spoil the broth.'"</p>
<p>"I am sorry for her anxieties," said Emma; "but I do not like
her plans or her opinions. I shall be afraid of her. She must have
too masculine and bold a temper. To be so bent on marriage, to
pursue a man merely for the sake of situation, is a sort of thing
that shocks me; I cannot understand it. Poverty is a great evil;
but to a woman of education and feeling it ought not, it cannot be
the greatest. I would rather be teacher at a school (and I can
think of nothing worse) than marry a man I did not like."</p>
<p>"I would rather do anything than be teacher at a school," said
her sister. "I have been at school, Emma, and know what a life they
lead; you never have. I should not like marrying a disagreeable man
any more than yourself; but I do not think there are many very
disagreeable men; I think I could like any good-humoured man with a
comfortable income. I suppose my aunt brought you up to be rather
refined."</p>
<p>"Indeed I do not know. My conduct must tell you how I have been
brought up. I am no judge of it myself. I cannot compare my aunt's
method with any other person's, because I know no other."</p>
<p>"But I can see in a great many things that you are very refined.
I have observed it ever since you came home, and I am afraid it
will not be for your happiness. Penelope will laugh at you very
much."</p>
<p>"<i>That</i> will not be for my happiness, I an sure. If my
opinions are wrong, I must correct them; if they are above my
situation, I must endeavour to conceal them; but I doubt whether
ridicule&mdash;Has Penelope much wit?"</p>
<p>"Yes; she has great spirits, and never cares what she says."</p>
<p>"Margaret is more gentle, I imagine?"</p>
<p>"Yes; especially in company. She is all gentleness and mildness
when anybody is by; but she is a little fretful and perverse among
ourselves. Poor creature! She is possessed with the notion of Tom
Musgrave's being more seriously in love with her than he ever was
with anybody else, and is always expecting him to come to the
point. This is the second time within this twelvemonth that she has
gone to spend a month with Robert and Jane on purpose to egg him on
by her absence; but I am sure she is mistaken, and that he will no
more follow her to Croydon now than he did last March. He will
never marry unless he can marry somebody very great,&mdash;Miss
Osborne, perhaps, or something in that style."</p>
<p>"Your account of this Tom Musgrave, Elizabeth, gives me very
little inclination for his acquaintance."</p>
<p>"You are afraid of him; I do not wonder at you."</p>
<p>"No, indeed; I dislike and despise him."</p>
<p>"Dislike and despise Tom Musgrave! No, that you never can. I
defy you not to be delighted with him if he takes notice of you. I
hope he will dance with you; and I dare say he will, unless the
Osbornes come with a large party, and then he will not speak to
anybody else."</p>
<p>"He seems to have most engaging manners!" said Emma. "Well, we
shall see how irresistible Mr. Tom Musgrave and I find each other.
I suppose I shall know him as soon as I enter the ball-room; he
must carry some of his charm in his face."</p>
<p>"You will not find him in the ball-room, I can tell you; you
will go early, that Mrs. Edwards may get a good place by the fire,
and he never comes till late; if the Osbornes are coming, he will
wait in the passage and come in with them. I should like to look in
upon you, Emma. If it was but a good day with my father, I would
wrap myself up, and James should drive me over as soon as I had
made tea for him; and I should be with you by the time the dancing
began."</p>
<p>"What! Would you come late at night in this chair?"</p>
<p>"To be sure I would. There, I said you were very refined, and
that's an instance of it."</p>
<p>Emma for a moment made no answer. At last she said,&mdash;</p>
<p>"I wish, Elizabeth, you had not made a point of my going to this
ball; I wish you were going instead of me. Your pleasure would be
greater than mine. I am a stranger here, and know nobody but the
Edwardses; my enjoyment, therefore, must be very doubtful. Yours,
among all your acquaintance, would be certain. It is not too late
to change. Very little apology could be requisite to the Edwardses,
who must be more glad of your company than of mine, and I should
most readily return to my father; and should not be at all afraid
to drive this quiet old creature home. Your clothes I would
undertake to find means of sending to you."</p>
<p>"My dearest Emma," cried Elizabeth, warmly, "do you think I
would do such a thing? Not for the universe! But I shall never
forget your good-nature in proposing it. You must have a sweet
temper indeed! I never met with anything like it! And would you
really give up the ball that I might be able to go to it? Believe
me, Emma, I am not so selfish as that comes to. No; though I am
nine years older than you are, I would not be the means of keeping
you from being seen. You are very pretty, and it would be very hard
that you should not have as fair a chance as we have all had to
make your fortune. No, Emma, whoever stays at home this winter, it
sha'n't be you. I am sure I should never have forgiven the person
who kept me from a ball at nineteen."</p>
<p>Emma expressed her gratitude, and for a few minutes they jogged
on in silence. Elizabeth first spoke:&mdash;</p>
<p>"You will take notice who Mary Edwards dances with?"</p>
<p>"I will remember her partners, if I can; but you know they will
be all strangers to me."</p>
<p>"Only observe whether she dances with Captain Hunter more than
once, &mdash;I have my fears in that quarter. Not that her father
or mother like officers; but if she does, you know, it is all over
with poor Sam. And I have promised to write him word who she dances
with."</p>
<p>"Is Sam attached to Miss Edwards?"</p>
<p>"Did not you know <i>that</i>?"</p>
<p>"How should I know it? How should I know in Shropshire what is
passing of that nature in Surrey? It is not likely that
circumstances of such delicacy should have made any part of the
scanty communication which passed between you and me for the last
fourteen years."</p>
<p>"I wonder I never mentioned it when I wrote. Since you have been
at home, I have been so busy with my poor father and our great wash
that I have had no leisure to tell you anything; but, indeed, I
concluded you knew it all. He has been very much in love with her
these two years, and it is a great disappointment to him that he
cannot always get away to our balls; but Mr. Curtis won't often
spare him, and just now it is a sickly time at Guildford."</p>
<p>"Do you suppose Miss Edwards inclined to like him?"</p>
<p>"I am afraid not: you know she is an only child, and will have
at least ten thousand pounds."</p>
<p>"But still she may like our brother."</p>
<p>"Oh, no! The Edwards look much higher. Her father and mother
would never consent to it. Sam is only a surgeon, you know.
Sometimes I think she does like him. But Mary Edwards is rather
prim and reserved; I do not always know what she would be at."</p>
<p>"Unless Sam feels on sure grounds with the lady herself, it
seems a pity to me that he should be encouraged to think of her at
all."</p>
<p>"A young man must think of somebody," said Elizabeth, "and why
should not he be as lucky as Robert, who has got a good wife and
six thousand pounds?"</p>
<p>"We must not all expect to be individually lucky," replied Emma.
"The luck of one member of a family is luck to all."</p>
<p>"Mine is all to come, I am sure," said Elizabeth, giving another
sigh to the remembrance of Purvis. "I have been unlucky enough; and
I cannot say much for you, as my aunt married again so foolishly.
Well, you will have a good ball, I daresay. The next turning will
bring us to the turnpike: you may see the church-tower over the
hedge, and the White Hart is close by it. I shall long to know what
you think of Tom Musgrave."</p>
<p>Such were the last audible sounds of Miss Watson's voice, before
they passed through the turnpike-gate, and entered on the pitching
of the town, the jumbling and noise of which made farther
conversation most thoroughly undesirable. The old mare trotted
heavily on, wanting no direction of the reins to take the right
turning, and making only one blunder, in proposing to stop at the
milliner's before she drew up towards Mr. Edwards' door. Mr.
Edwards lived in the best house in the street, and the best in the
place, if Mr. Tomlinson, the banker, might be indulged in calling
his newly erected house at the end of the town, with a shrubbery
and sweep, in the country.</p>
<p>Mr. Edwards' house was higher than most of its neighbours, with
four windows on each side the door, the windows guarded by posts
and chains, and the door approached by a flight of stone steps.</p>
<p>"Here we are," said Elizabeth, as the carriage ceased moving,
"safely arrived, and by the market clock we have been only
five-and-thirty minutes coming; which I think is doing pretty well,
though it would be nothing for Penelope. Is not it a nice town? The
Edwards have a noble house, you see, and they live quite in style.
The door will be opened by a man in livery, with a powdered head, I
can tell you."</p>
<p>Emma had seen the Edwardses only one morning at Stanton; they
were therefore all but strangers to her; and though her spirits
were by no means insensible to the expected joys of the evening,
she felt a little uncomfortable in the thought of all that was to
precede them. Her conversation with Elizabeth, too, giving her some
very unpleasant feelings with respect to her own family, had made
her more open to disagreeable impressions from any other cause, and
increased her sense of the awkwardness of rushing into intimacy on
so slight an acquaintance.</p>
<p>There was nothing in the manner of Mrs. or Miss Edwards to give
immediate change to these ideas. The mother, though a very friendly
woman, had a reserved air, and a great deal of formal civility; and
the daughter, a genteel-looking girl of twenty-two, with her hair
in papers, seemed very naturally to have caught something of the
style of her mother, who had brought her up. Emma was soon left to
know what they could be, by Elizabeth's being obliged to hurry
away; and some very languid remarks on the probable brilliancy of
the ball were all that broke, at intervals, a silence of half an
hour, before they were joined by the master of the house. Mr.
Edwards had a much easier and more communicative air than the
ladies of the family; he was fresh from the street, and he came
ready to tell whatever might interest. After a cordial reception of
Emma, he turned to his daughter with,&mdash;</p>
<p>"Well, Mary, I bring you good news: the Osbornes will certainly
be at the ball tonight. Horses for two carriages are ordered from
the White Hart to be at Osborne Castle by nine."</p>
<p>"I am glad of it," observed Mrs. Edwards, "because their coming
gives a credit to our assembly. The Osbornes being known to have
been at the first ball, will dispose a great many people to attend
the second. It is more than they deserve; for in fact, they add
nothing to the pleasure of the evening: they come so late and go so
early; but great people have always their charm."</p>
<p>Mr. Edwards proceeded to relate every other little article of
news which his morning's lounge had supplied him with, and they
chatted with greater briskness, till Mrs. Edwards' moment for
dressing arrived, and the young ladies were carefully recommended
to lose no time. Emma was shown to a very comfortable apartment,
and as soon as Mrs. Edwards' civilities could leave her to herself,
the happy occupation, the first bliss of a ball, began. The girls,
dressing in some measure together, grew unavoidably better
acquainted. Emma found in Miss Edwards the show of good sense, a
modest unpretending mind, and a great wish of obliging; and when
they returned to the parlour where Mrs. Edwards was sitting,
respectably attired in one of the two satin gowns which went
through the winter, and a new cap from the milliner's, they entered
it with much easier feelings and more natural smiles than they had
taken away. Their dress was now to be examined: Mrs. Edwards
acknowledged herself too old-fashioned to approve of every modern
extravagance, however sanctioned; and though complacently viewing
her daughter's good looks, would give but a qualified admiration;
and Mr. Edwards, not less satisfied with Mary, paid some
compliments of good-humoured gallantry to Emma at her expense. The
discussion led to more intimate remarks, and Miss Edwards gently
asked Emma if she were not often reckoned very like her youngest
brother. Emma thought she could perceive a faint blush accompany
the question, and there seemed something still more suspicious in
the manner in which Mr. Edwards took up the subject.</p>
<p>"You are paying Miss Emma no great compliment, I think, Mary,"
said he, hastily. "Mr. Sam Watson is a very good sort of young man,
and I dare say a very clever surgeon; but his complexion has been
rather too much exposed to all weathers to make a likeness to him
very flattering."</p>
<p>Mary apologised, in some confusion,&mdash;</p>
<p>"She had not thought a strong likeness at all incompatible with
very different degrees of beauty. There might be resemblance in
countenance, and the complexion and even the features be very
unlike."</p>
<p>"I know nothing of my brother's beauty," said Emma, "for I have
not seen him since he was seven years old; but my father reckons us
alike."</p>
<p>"Mr. Watson!" cried Mr. Edwards; "well, you astonish me. There
is not the least likeness in the world; your brother's eyes are
grey, yours are brown; he has a long face and a wide mouth. My
dear, do you perceive the least resemblance?"</p>
<p>"Not the least. Miss Emma Watson puts me very much in mind of
her eldest sister, and sometimes I see a look of Miss Penelope, and
once or twice there has been a glance of Mr. Robert, but I cannot
perceive any likeness to Mr. Samuel."</p>
<p>"I see the likeness between her and Miss Watson," replied Mr.
Edwards, "very strongly, but I am not sensible of the others. I do
not much think she is like any of the family but Miss Watson; but I
am very sure there is no resemblance between her and Sam."</p>
<p>This matter was settled, and they went to dinner.</p>
<p>"Your father, Miss Emma, is one of my oldest friends," said Mr.
Edwards, as he helped her to wine, when they were drawn round the
fire to enjoy their dessert. "We must drink to his better health.
It is a great concern to me, I assure you, that he should be such
an invalid. I know nobody who likes a game of cards, in a social
way, better than he does, and very few people that play a fairer
rubber. It is a thousand pities that he should be so deprived of
the pleasure. For now we have a quiet little Whist Club, that meets
three times a week at the White Hart; and if he could but have his
health, how much he would enjoy it!"</p>
<p>"I dare say he would, sir; and I wish, with all my heart, he
were equal to it."</p>
<p>"Your club would be better fitted for an invalid," said Mrs.
Edwards, "if you did not keep it up so late."</p>
<p>This was an old grievance.</p>
<p>"So late, my dear! What are you talking of?" cried the husband,
with sturdy pleasantry. "We are always at home before midnight.
They would laugh at Osborne Castle to hear you call that late; they
are but just rising from dinner at midnight."</p>
<p>"That is nothing to the purpose," retorted the lady, calmly.
"The Osbornes are to be no rule for us. You had better meet every
night, and break up two hours sooner."</p>
<p>So far the subject was very often carried; but Mr. and Mrs.
Edwards were so wise as never to pass that point; and Mr. Edwards
now turned to something else. He had lived long enough in the
idleness of a town to become a little of a gossip, and having some
anxiety to know more of the circumstances of his young guest than
had yet reached him, he began with,&mdash;</p>
<p>"I think, Miss Emma, I remember your aunt very well, about
thirty years ago; I am pretty sure I danced with her in the old
rooms at Bath, the year before I married. She was a very fine woman
then; but like other people, I suppose, she is grown somewhat older
since that time. I hope she is likely to be happy in her second
choice."</p>
<p>"I hope so; I believe so, sir," said Emma, in some
agitation.</p>
<p>"Mr. Turner had not been dead a great while, I think?"</p>
<p>"About two years, sir."</p>
<p>"I forget what her name is now."</p>
<p>"O'Brien."</p>
<p>"Irish! ah, I remember; and she is gone to settle in Ireland. I
do wonder that you should not wish to go with her into that
country, Miss Emma; but it must be a great deprivation to her, poor
lady, after bringing you up like a child of her own."</p>
<p>"I was not so ungrateful, sir," said Emma, warmly, "as to wish
to be anywhere but with her. It did not suit them, it did not suit
Captain O'Brien that I should be of the party."</p>
<p>"Captain!" repeated Mrs. Edwards. "The gentleman is in the army
then?"</p>
<p>"Yes, ma'am."</p>
<p>"Aye, there is nothing like your officers for captivating the
ladies, young or old. There is no resisting a cockade, my
dear."</p>
<p>"I hope there is," said Mrs. Edwards, gravely, with a quick
glance at her daughter; and Emma had just recovered from her own
perturbation in time to see a blush on Miss Edwards' cheek, and in
remembering what Elizabeth had said of Captain Hunter, to wonder
and waver between his influence and her brother's.</p>
<p>"Elderly ladies should be careful how they make a second
choice," observed Mr. Edwards.</p>
<p>"Carefulness&mdash;discretion should not be confined to elderly
ladies or to a second choice," added his wife. "They are quite as
necessary to young ladies in their first."</p>
<p>"Rather more so, my dear," replied he; "because young ladies are
likely to feel the effects of it longer. When an old lady plays the
fool, it is not in the course of nature that she should suffer from
it many years."</p>
<p>Emma drew her hand across her eyes; and Mrs. Edwards, on
perceiving it, changed the subject to one of less anxiety to
all.</p>
<p>With nothing to do but to expect the hour of setting off, the
afternoon was long to the two young ladies; and though Miss Edwards
was rather discomposed at the very early hour which her mother
always fixed for going, that early hour itself was watched for with
some eagerness.</p>
<p>The entrance of the tea-things at seven o'clock was some relief;
and luckily Mr. and Mrs. Edwards always drank a dish extraordinary
and ate an additional muffin when they were going to sit up late,
which lengthened the ceremony almost to the wished-for moment.</p>
<p>At a little before eight, the Tomlinsons' carriage was heard to
go by&mdash;which was the constant signal for Mrs. Edwards to order
hers to the door; and in a very few minutes the party were
transported from the quiet and warmth of a snug parlour to the
bustle, noise, and draughts of air of the broad entrance passage of
an inn. Mrs. Edwards, carefully guarding her own dress, while she
attended with yet greater solicitude to the proper security of her
young charges' shoulders and throats, led the way up the wide
staircase, while no sound of a ball but the first scrape of one
violin blessed the ears of her followers; and Miss Edwards, on
hazarding the anxious inquiry of whether there were many people
come yet, was told by the waiter, as she knew she should, that "Mr.
Tomlinson's family were in the room."</p>
<p>In passing along a short gallery to the assembly-room, brilliant
in lights before them, they were accosted by a young man in a
morning-dress and boots, who was standing in the doorway of a
bed-chamber, apparently on purpose to see them go by.</p>
<p>"Ah! Mrs. Edwards, how do you do? How do you do, Miss Edwards?"
he cried, with an easy air. "You are determined to be in good time,
I see, as usual. The candles are but this moment lit."</p>
<p>"I like to get a good seat by the fire, you know, Mr. Musgrave,"
replied Mrs. Edwards.</p>
<p>"I am this moment going to dress," said he. "I am waiting for my
stupid fellow. We shall have a famous ball. The Osbornes are
certainly coming; you may depend upon that, for I was with Lord
Osborne this morning."</p>
<p>The party passed on. Mrs. Edwards' satin gown swept along the
clean floor of the ball-room to the fireplace at the upper end,
where one party only were formally seated, while three or four
officers were lounging together, passing in and out from the
adjoining card-room. A very stiff meeting between these near
neighbours ensued; and as soon as they were all duly placed again,
Emma, in the low whisper which became the solemn scene, said to
Miss Edwards,&mdash;</p>
<p>"The gentleman we passed in the passage was Mr. Musgrave, then;
he is reckoned remarkably agreeable, I understand?"</p>
<p>Miss Edwards answered hesitatingly, "Yes; he is very much liked
by many people; but we are not very intimate."</p>
<p>"He is rich, is not he?"</p>
<p>"He has about eight or nine hundred pounds a year, I believe. He
came into possession of it when he was very young, and my father
and mother think it has given him rather an unsettled turn. He is
no favourite with them."</p>
<p>The cold and empty appearance of the room and the demure air of
the small cluster of females at one end of it, began soon to give
way. The inspiriting sound of other carriages was heard, and
continual accessions of portly chaperons and strings of
smartly-dressed girls were received, with now and then a fresh
gentleman straggler, who, if not enough in love to station himself
near any fair creature, seemed glad to escape into the
card-room.</p>
<p>Among the increasing number of military men, one now made his
way to Miss Edwards with an air of empressement which decidedly
said to her companion, "I am Captain Hunter;" and Emma, who could
not but watch her at such a moment, saw her looking rather
distressed, but by no means displeased, and heard an engagement
formed for the two first dances, which made her think her brother
Sam's a hopeless case.</p>
<p>Emma in the meanwhile was not unobserved or unadmired herself. A
new face, and a very pretty one, could not be slighted. Her name
was whispered from one party to another; and no sooner had the
signal been given by the orchestra's striking up a favourite air,
which seemed to call the young to their duty and people the centre
of the room, than she found herself engaged to dance with a brother
officer, introduced by Captain Hunter.</p>
<p>Emma Watson was not more than of the middle height, well made
and plump, with an air of healthy vigour. Her skin was very brown,
but clear, smooth, and glowing, which, with a lively eye, a sweet
smile, and an open countenance, gave beauty to attract, and
expression to make that beauty improve on acquaintance. Having no
reason to be dissatisfied with her partner, the evening began very
pleasantly to her, and her feelings perfectly coincided with the
reiterated observation of others, that it was an excellent ball.
The two first dances were not quite over when the returning sound
of carriages after a long interruption called general notice, and
"The Osbornes are coming! The Osbornes are coming!" was repeated
round the room. After some minutes of extraordinary bustle without
and watchful curiosity within, the important party, preceded by the
attentive master of the inn to open a door which was never shut,
made their appearance. They consisted of Lady Osborne; her son,
Lord Osborne; her daughter, Miss Osborne; Miss Carr, her daughter's
friend; Mr. Howard, formerly tutor to Lord Osborne, now clergyman
of the parish in which the castle stood; Mrs. Blake, a widow sister
who lived with him; her son, a fine boy of ten years old; and Mr.
Tom Musgrave, who probably, imprisoned within his own room, had
been listening in bitter impatience to the sound of the music for
the last half-hour. In their progress up the room, they paused
almost immediately behind Emma to receive the compliments of some
acquaintance; and she heard Lady Osborne observe that they had made
a point of coming early for the gratification of Mrs. Blake's
little boy, who was uncommonly fond of dancing. Emma looked at them
all as they passed, but chiefly and with most interest on Tom
Musgrave, who was certainly a genteel, good-looking young man. Of
the females, Lady Osborne had by much the finest person; though
nearly fifty, she was very handsome, and had all the dignity of
rank.</p>
<p>Lord Osborne was a very fine young man; but there was an air of
coldness, of carelessness, even of awkwardness about him, which
seemed to speak him out of his element in a ball-room. He came, in
fact, only because it was judged expedient for him to please the
borough; he was not fond of women's company, and he never danced.
Mr. Howard was an agreeable-looking man, a little more than
thirty.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of the two dances, Emma found herself, she
knew not how, seated amongst the Osborne set; and she was
immediately struck with the fine countenance and animated gestures
of the little boy, as he was standing before his mother, wondering
when they should begin.</p>
<p>"You will not be surprised at Charles' impatience," said Mrs.
Blake, a lively, pleasant-looking little woman of five or six and
thirty, to a lady who was standing near her, "when you know what a
partner he is to have. Miss Osborne has been so very kind as to
promise to dance the two first dances with him."</p>
<p>"Oh, yes! we have been engaged this week," cried the boy, "and
we are to dance down every couple."</p>
<p>On the other side of Emma, Miss Osborne, Miss Carr, and a party
of young men were standing engaged in very lively consultation; and
soon afterwards she saw the smartest officer of the set walking off
to the orchestra to order the dance, while Miss Osborne, passing
before her to her little expecting partner, hastily said: "Charles,
I beg your pardon for not keeping my engagement, but I am going to
dance these two dances with Colonel Beresford. I know you will
excuse me, and I will certainly dance with you after tea;" and
without staying for an answer, she turned again to Miss Carr, and
in another minute was led by Colonel Beresford to begin the set. If
the poor little boy's face had in its happiness been interesting to
Emma, it was infinitely more so under this sudden reverse; he stood
the picture of disappointment, with crimsoned cheeks, quivering
lips, and eyes bent on the floor. His mother, stifling her own
mortification, tried to soothe his with the prospect of Miss
Osborne's second promise; but though he contrived to utter, with an
effort of boyish bravery, "Oh, I do not mind it!" it was very
evident, by the unceasing agitation of his features, that he minded
it as much as ever.</p>
<p>Emma did not think or reflect; she felt and acted. "I shall be
very happy to dance with you, sir, if you like it," said she,
holding out her hand with the most unaffected good-humour. The boy,
in one moment restored to all his first delight, looked joyfully at
his mother; and stepping forwards with an honest and simple "Thank
you, ma'am," was instantly ready to attend his new acquaintance.
The thankfulness of Mrs. Blake was more diffuse; with a look most
expressive of unexpected pleasure and lively gratitude, she turned
to her neighbour with repeated and fervent acknowledgments of so
great and condescending a kindness to her boy. Emma, with perfect
truth, could assure her that she could not be giving greater
pleasure than she felt herself; and Charles being provided with his
gloves and charged to keep them on, they joined the set which was
now rapidly forming, with nearly equal complacency. It was a
partnership which could not be noticed without surprise. It gained
her a broad stare from Miss Osborne and Miss Carr as they passed
her in the dance. "Upon my word, Charles, you are in luck," said
the former, as she turned him; "you have got a better partner than
me;" to which the happy Charles answered "Yes."</p>
<p>Tom Musgrave, who was dancing with Miss Carr, gave her many
inquisitive glances; and after a time Lord Osborne himself came,
and under pretence of talking to Charles, stood to look at his
partner. Though rather distressed by such observation, Emma could
not repent what she had done, so happy had it made both the boy and
his mother; the latter of whom was continually making opportunities
of addressing her with the warmest civility. Her little partner,
she found, though bent chiefly on dancing, was not unwilling to
speak, when her questions or remarks gave him anything to say; and
she learnt, by a sort of inevitable inquiry, that he had two
brothers and a sister, that they and their mamma all lived with his
uncle at Wickstead, that his uncle taught him Latin, that he was
very fond of riding, and had a horse of his own given him by Lord
Osborne; and that he had been out once already with Lord Osborne's
hounds.</p>
<p>At the end of these dances, Emma found they were to drink tea;
Miss Edwards gave her a caution to be at hand, in a manner which
convinced her of Mrs. Edwards' holding it very important to have
them both close to her when she moved into the tea-room; and Emma
was accordingly on the alert to gain her proper station. It was
always the pleasure of the company to have a little bustle and
crowd when they adjourned for refreshment. The tea-room was a small
room within the card-room; and in passing through the latter, where
the passage was straitened by tables, Mrs. Edwards and her party
were for a few moments hemmed in. It happened close by Lady
Osborne's cassino table; Mr. Howard, who belonged to it, spoke to
his nephew; and Emma, on perceiving herself the object of attention
both to Lady Osborne and him, had just turned away her eyes in time
to avoid seeming to hear her young companion delightedly whisper
aloud, "Oh, uncle! do look at my partner; she is so pretty!" As
they were immediately in motion again, however, Charles was hurried
off without being able to receive his uncle's suffrage. On entering
the tea-room, in which two long tables were prepared, Lord Osborne
was to be seen quite alone at the end of one, as if retreating as
far as he could from the ball, to enjoy his own thoughts and gape
without restraint. Charles instantly pointed him out to Emma.
"There's Lord Osborne; let you and I go and sit by him."</p>
<p>"No, no," said Emma, laughing; "you must sit with my
friends."</p>
<p>Charles was now free enough to hazard a few questions in his
turn. "What o'clock was it?"</p>
<p>"Eleven."</p>
<p>"Eleven! and I am not at all sleepy. Mamma said I should be
asleep before ten. Do you think Miss Osborne will keep her word
with me, when tea is over?"</p>
<p>"Oh, yes! I suppose so;" though she felt that she had no better
reason to give than that Miss Osborne had not kept it before.</p>
<p>"When shall you come to Osborne Castle?"</p>
<p>"Never, probably. I am not acquainted with the family."</p>
<p>"But you may come to Wickstead and see mamma, and she can take
you to the castle. There is a monstrous curious stuffed fox there,
and a badger; anybody would think they were alive. It is a pity you
should not see them."</p>
<p>On rising from tea, there was again a scramble for the pleasure
of being first out of the room, which happened to be increased by
one or two of the card-parties having just broken up, and the
players being disposed to move exactly the different way. Among
these was Mr. Howard, his sister leaning on his arm; and no sooner
were they within reach of Emma, than Mrs Blake, calling her notice
by a friendly touch, said, "Your goodness to Charles, my dear Miss
Watson, brings all his family upon you. Give me leave to introduce
my brother, Mr. Howard." Emma curtsied, the gentleman bowed, made a
hasty request for the honour of her hand in the two next dances, to
which as hasty an affirmative was given, and they were immediately
impelled in opposite directions. Emma was very well pleased with
the circumstance; there was a quietly cheerful, gentlemanlike air
in Mr. Howard which suited her; and in a few minutes afterwards the
value of her engagement increased, when, as she was sitting in the
card-room, somewhat screened by a door, she heard Lord Osborne, who
was lounging on a vacant table near her, call Tom Musgrave towards
him and say, "Why do not you dance with that beautiful Emma Watson?
I want you to dance with her, and I will come and stand by
you."</p>
<p>"I was determining on it this very moment, my lord; I'll be
introduced and dance with her directly."</p>
<p>"Aye, do; and if you find she does not want much talking to, you
may introduce me by and by."</p>
<p>"Very well, my lord; if she is like her sisters, she will only
want to be listened to. I will go this moment. I shall find her in
the tea-room. That stiff old Mrs. Edwards has never done tea."</p>
<p>Away he went, Lord Osborne after him; and Emma lost no time in
hurrying from her corner exactly the other way, forgetting in her
haste that she left Mrs. Edwards behind.</p>
<p>"We had quite lost you," said Mrs. Edwards, who followed her
with Mary in less than five minutes. "If you prefer this room to
the other, there is no reason why you should not be here; but we
had better all be together."</p>
<p>Emma was saved the trouble of apologizing, by their being joined
at the moment by Tom Musgrave, who requesting Mrs. Edwards aloud to
do him the honour of presenting him to Miss Emma Watson, left that
good lady without any choice in the business, but that of
testifying by the coldness of her manner that she did it
unwillingly. The honour of dancing with her was solicited without
loss of time; and Emma, however she might like to be thought a
beautiful girl by lord or commoner, was so little disposed to
favour Tom Musgrave himself that she had considerable satisfaction
in avowing her previous engagement. He was evidently surprised and
discomposed. The style of her last partner had probably led him to
believe her not overpowered with applications.</p>
<p>"My little friend Charles Blake," he cried, "must not expect to
engross you the whole evening. We can never suffer this. It is
against the rules of the assembly, and I am sure it will never be
patronised by our good friend here, Mrs. Edwards; she is by much
too nice a judge of decorum to give her license to such a dangerous
particularity&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I am not going to dance with Master Blake, sir!"</p>
<p>The gentleman, a little disconcerted, could only hope he might
be fortunate another time, and seeming unwilling to leave her,
though his friend Lord Osborne was waiting in the doorway for the
result, as Emma with some amusement perceived, he began to make
civil inquiries after her family.</p>
<p>"How comes it that we have not the pleasure of seeing your
sisters here this evening? Our assemblies have been used to be so
well treated by them that we do not know how to take this
neglect."</p>
<p>"My eldest sister is the only one at home, and she could not
leave my father."</p>
<p>"Miss Watson the only one at home! You astonish me! It seems but
the day before yesterday that I saw them all three in this town.
But I am afraid I have been a very sad neighbour of late. I hear
dreadful complaints of my negligence wherever I go, and I confess
it is a shameful length of time since I was at Stanton. But I shall
now endeavour to make myself amends for the past."</p>
<p>Emma's calm courtesy in reply must have struck him as very
unlike the encouraging warmth he had been used to receive from her
sisters, and gave him probably the novel sensation of doubting his
own influence, and of wishing for more attention than she bestowed.
The dancing now recommenced; Miss Carr being impatient to call,
everybody was required to stand up; and Tom Musgrave's curiosity
was appeased on seeing Mr. Howard come forward and claim Emma's
hand.</p>
<p>"That will do as well for me," was Lord Osborne's remark, when
his friend carried him the news, and he was continually at Howard's
elbow during the two dances.</p>
<p>The frequency of his appearance there was the only unpleasant
part of the engagement, the only objection she could make to Mr.
Howard. In himself, she thought him as agreeable as he looked;
though chatting on the commonest topics, he had a sensible,
unaffected way of expressing himself, which made them all worth
hearing, and she only regretted that he had not been able to make
his pupil's manners as unexceptionable as his own. The two dances
seemed very short, and she had her partner's authority for
considering them so. At their conclusion the Osbornes and their
train were all on the move.</p>
<p>"We are off at last," said his lordship to Tom. "How much longer
do you stay in this heavenly place&mdash;till sunrise?"</p>
<p>"No, faith! my lord; I have had quite enough of it. I assure
you, I shall not show myself here again when I have had the honour
of attending Lady Osborne to her carriage. I shall retreat in as
much secrecy as possible to the most remote corner of the house,
where I shall order a barrel of oysters, and be famously snug."</p>
<p>"Let me see you soon at the castle, and bring me word how she
looks by daylight."</p>
<p>Emma and Mrs. Blake parted as old acquaintance, and Charles
shook her by the hand, and wished her "good-bye" at least a dozen
times. From Miss Osborne and Miss Carr she received something like
a jerking curtsey as they passed her; even Lady Osborne gave her a
look of complacency, and his lordship actually came back, after the
others were out of the room, to "beg her pardon," and look in the
window-seat behind her for the gloves which were visibly compressed
in his hand. As Tom Musgrave was seen no more, we may suppose his
plan to have succeeded, and imagine him mortifying with his barrel
of oysters in dreary solitude, or gladly assisting the landlady in
her bar to make fresh negus for the happy dancers above. Emma could
not help missing the party by whom she had been, though in some
respects unpleasantly, distinguished; and the two dances which
followed and concluded the ball were rather flat in comparison with
the others. Mr. Edwards having played with good luck, they were
some of the last in the room.</p>
<p>"Here we are back again, I declare," said Emma, sorrowfully, as
she walked into the dining-room, where the table was prepared, and
the neat upper maid was lighting the candles. "My dear Miss
Edwards, how soon it is at an end! I wish it could all come over
again."</p>
<p>A great deal of kind pleasure was expressed in her having
enjoyed the evening so much; and Mr. Edwards was as warm as herself
in the praise of the fullness, brilliancy, and spirit of the
meeting, though as he had been fixed the whole time at the same
table in the same room, with only one change of chairs, it might
have seemed a matter scarcely perceived; but he had won four
rubbers out of five, and everything went well. His daughter felt
the advantage of this gratified state of mind, in the course of the
remarks and retrospections which now ensued over the welcome
soup.</p>
<p>"How came you not to dance with either of the Mr. Tomlinsons,
Mary?" said her mother.</p>
<p>"I was always engaged when they asked me."</p>
<p>"I thought you were to have stood up with Mr. James the two last
dances; Mrs. Tomlinson told me he was gone to ask you, and I had
heard you say two minutes before that you were not engaged."</p>
<p>"Yes, but there was a mistake; I had misunderstood. I did not
know I was engaged. I thought it had been for the two dances after,
if we stayed so long; but Captain Hunter assured me it was for
those very two."</p>
<p>"So you ended with Captain Hunter, Mary, did you?" said her
father. "And whom did you begin with?"</p>
<p>"Captain Hunter," was repeated in a very humble tone.</p>
<p>"Hum! That is being constant, however. But who else did you
dance with?"</p>
<p>"Mr. Norton and Mr. Styles."</p>
<p>"And who are they?"</p>
<p>"Mr. Norton is a cousin of Captain Hunter's."</p>
<p>"And who is Mr. Styles?"</p>
<p>"One of his particular friends."</p>
<p>"All in the same regiment," added Mrs. Edwards. "Mary was
surrounded by red-coats all the evening. I should have been better
pleased to see her dancing with some of our old neighbours, I
confess."</p>
<p>"Yes, yes; we must not neglect our old neighbours. But if these
soldiers are quicker than other people in a ball-room, what are
young ladies to do?"</p>
<p>"I think there is no occasion for their engaging themselves so
many dances beforehand, Mr. Edwards."</p>
<p>"No, perhaps not; but I remember, my dear, when you and I did
the same."</p>
<p>Mrs. Edwards said no more, and Mary breathed again. A good deal
of good-humoured pleasantry followed; and Emma went to bed in
charming spirits, her head full of Osbornes, Blakes, and
Howards.</p>
<p>The next morning brought a great many visitors. It was the way
of the place always to call on Mrs. Edwards the morning after a
ball, and this neighbourly inclination was increased in the present
instance by a general spirit of curiosity on Emma's account, as
everybody wanted to look again at the girl who had been admired the
night before by Lord Osborne. Many were the eyes, and various the
degrees of approbation with which she was examined. Some saw no
fault, and some no beauty. With some her brown skin was the
annihilation of every grace, and others could never be persuaded
that she was half so handsome as Elizabeth Watson had been ten
years ago. The morning passed quickly away in discussing the merits
of the ball with all this succession of company; and Emma was at
once astonished by finding it two o'clock, and considering that she
had heard nothing of her father's chair. After this discovery, she
had walked twice to the window to examine the street, and was on
the point of asking leave to ring the bell and make inquiries, when
the light sound of a carriage driving up to the door set her heart
at ease. She stepped again to the window, but instead of the
convenient though very un-smart family equipage, perceived a neat
curricle. Mr. Musgrave was shortly afterwards announced, and Mrs.
Edwards put on her very stiffest look at the sound. Not at all
dismayed, however, by her chilling air, he paid his compliments to
each of the ladies with no unbecoming ease, and continuing to
address Emma, presented her a note, which "he had the honour of
bringing from her sister, but to which he must observe a verbal
postscript from himself would be requisite."</p>
<p>The note, which Emma was beginning to read rather before Mrs.
Edwards had entreated her to use no ceremony, contained a few lines
from Elizabeth importing that their father, in consequence of being
unusually well, had taken the sudden resolution of attending the
visitation that day, and that as his road lay quite wide from D.,
it was impossible for her to come home till the following morning,
unless the Edwardses would send her, which was hardly to be
expected, or she could meet with any chance conveyance, or did not
mind walking so far. She had scarcely run her eye through the
whole, before she found herself obliged to listen to Tom Musgrave's
farther account.</p>
<p>"I received that note from the fair hands of Miss Watson only
ten minutes ago," said he; "I met her in the village of Stanton,
whither my good stars prompted me to turn my horses' heads. She was
at that moment in quest of a person to employ on the errand, and I
was fortunate enough to convince her that she could not find a more
willing or speedy messenger than myself. Remember, I say nothing of
my disinterestedness. My reward is to be the indulgence of
conveying you to Stanton in my curricle. Though they are not
written down, I bring your sister's orders for the same."</p>
<p>Emma felt distressed; she did not like the proposal&mdash;she
did not wish to be on terms of intimacy with the proposer; and yet,
fearful of encroaching on the Edwardses, as well as wishing to go
home herself, she was at a loss how entirely to decline what he
offered. Mrs. Edwards continued silent, either not understanding
the case, or waiting to see how the young lady's inclination lay.
Emma thanked him, but professed herself very unwilling to give him
so much trouble. "The trouble was of course honour, pleasure,
delight,&mdash;what had he or his horses to do?" Still she
hesitated,&mdash;"She believed she must beg leave to decline his
assistance; she was rather afraid of the sort of carriage. The
distance was not beyond a walk." Mrs. Edwards was silent no longer.
She inquired into the particulars, and then said, "We shall be
extremely happy, Miss Emma, if you can give us the pleasure of your
company till tomorrow; but if you cannot conveniently do so, our
carriage is quite at your service, and Mary will be pleased with
the opportunity of seeing your sister."</p>
<p>This was precisely what Emma had longed for, and she accepted
the offer most thankfully, acknowledging that as Elizabeth was
entirely alone, it was her wish to return home to dinner. The plan
was warmly opposed by their visitor,&mdash;</p>
<p>"I cannot suffer it, indeed. I must not be deprived of the
happiness of escorting you. I assure you there is not a possibility
of fear with my horses. You might guide them yourself. Your sisters
all know how quiet they are; they have none of them the smallest
scruple in trusting themselves with me, even on a race-course.
Believe me," added he, lowering his voice, "you are quite
safe,&mdash;the danger is only mine."</p>
<p>Emma was not more disposed to oblige him for all this.</p>
<p>"And as to Mrs. Edwards' carriage being used the day after a
ball, it is a thing quite out of rule, I assure you&mdash;never
heard of before. The old coachman will look as black as his
horses&mdash;won't he Miss Edwards?"</p>
<p>No notice was taken. The ladies were silently firm, and the
gentleman found himself obliged to submit.</p>
<p>"What a famous ball we had last night!" he cried, after a short
pause. "How long did you keep it up after the Osbornes and I went
away?"</p>
<p>"We had two dances more."</p>
<p>"It is making it too much of a fatigue, I think, to stay so
late. I suppose your set was not a very full one."</p>
<p>"Yes; quite as full as ever, except the Osbornes. There seemed
no vacancy anywhere; and everybody danced with uncommon spirit to
the very last."</p>
<p>Emma said this, though against her conscience.</p>
<p>"Indeed! perhaps I might have looked in upon you again, if I had
been aware of as much, for I am rather fond of dancing than not.
Miss Osborne is a charming girl, is not she?"</p>
<p>"I do not think her handsome," replied Emma, to whom all this
was chiefly addressed.</p>
<p>"Perhaps she is not critically handsome, but her manners are
delightful. And Fanny Carr is a most interesting little creature.
You can imagine nothing more naive or piquante; and what do you
think of Lord Osborne, Miss Watson?"</p>
<p>"He would be handsome even though he were not a lord, and
perhaps, better bred; more desirous of pleasing and showing himself
pleased in a right place."</p>
<p>"Upon my word, you are severe upon my friend! I assure you Lord
Osborne is a very good fellow."</p>
<p>"I do not dispute his virtues, but I do not like his careless
air."</p>
<p>"If it were not a breach of confidence," replied Tom, with an
important look, "perhaps I might be able to win a more favourable
opinion of poor Osborne."</p>
<p>Emma gave him no encouragement, and he was obliged to keep his
friend's secret. He was also obliged to put an end to his visit,
for Mrs. Edwards having ordered her carriage, there was no time to
be lost on Emma's side in preparing for it. Miss Edwards
accompanied her home; but as it was dinner-hour at Stanton, stayed
with them only a few minutes.</p>
<p>"Now, my dear Emma," said Miss Watson, as soon as they were
alone, "you must talk to me all the rest of the day without
stopping, or I shall not be satisfied; but, first of all, Nanny
shall bring in the dinner. Poor thing! You will not dine as you did
yesterday, for we have nothing but some fried beef. How nice Mary
Edwards looks in her new pelisse! And now tell me how you like them
all, and what I am to say to Sam. I have begun my letter, Jack
Stokes is to call for it tomorrow, for his uncle is going within a
mile of Guildford the next day."</p>
<p>Nanny brought in the dinner.</p>
<p>"We will wait upon ourselves," continued Elizabeth, "and then we
shall lose no time. And so, you would not come home with Tom
Musgrave?"</p>
<p>"No, you had said so much against him that I could not wish
either for the obligation or the intimacy which the use of his
carriage must have created. I should not even have liked the
appearance of it."</p>
<p>"You did very right; though I wonder at your forbearance, and I
do not think I could have done it myself. He seemed so eager to
fetch you that I could not say no, though it rather went against me
to be throwing you together, so well as I knew his tricks; but I
did long to see you, and it was a clever way of getting you home.
Besides, it won't do to be too nice. Nobody could have thought of
the Edwardses' letting you have their coach, after the horses being
out so late. But what am I to say to Sam?"</p>
<p>"If you are guided by me, you will not encourage him to think of
Miss Edwards. The father is decidedly against him, the mother shows
him no favour, and I doubt his having any interest with Mary. She
danced twice with Captain Hunter, and I think shows him in general
as much encouragement as is consistent with her disposition and the
circumstances she is placed in. She once mentioned Sam, and
certainly with a little confusion; but that was perhaps merely
owing to the consciousness of his liking her, which may very
probably have come to her knowledge."</p>
<p>"Oh, dear! yes. She has heard enough of that from us all. Poor
Sam! he is out of luck as well as other people. For the life of me,
Emma, I cannot help feeling for those that are crossed in love.
Well, now begin, and give me an account of everything as it
happened."</p>
<p>Emma obeyed her, and Elizabeth listened with very little
interruption till she heard of Mr. Howard as a partner.</p>
<p>"Dance with Mr. Howard! Good heavens! you don't say so! Why, he
is quite one of the great and grand ones. Did you not find him very
high?"</p>
<p>"His manners are of a kind to give me much more ease and
confidence than Tom Musgrave's."</p>
<p>"Well, go on. I should have been frightened out of my wits to
have had anything to do with the Osbornes' set."</p>
<p>Emma concluded her narration.</p>
<p>"And so you really did not dance with Tom Musgrave at all; but
you must have liked him,&mdash;you must have been struck with him
altogether."</p>
<p>"I do <i>not</i> like him, Elizabeth. I allow his person and air
to be good, and that his manners to a certain point&mdash;his
address rather&mdash;is pleasing, but I see nothing else to admire
in him. On the contrary, he seems very vain, very conceited,
absurdly anxious for distinction, and absolutely contemptible in
some of the measures he takes for becoming so. There is a
ridiculousness about him that entertains me, but his company gives
me no other agreeable emotion."</p>
<p>"My dearest Emma! You are like nobody else in the world. It is
well Margaret is not by. You do not offend me, though I hardly know
how to believe you; but Margaret would never forgive such
words."</p>
<p>"I wish Margaret could have heard him profess his ignorance of
her being out of the country; he declared it seemed only two days
since he had seen her."</p>
<p>"Aye, that is just like him; and yet this is the man she will
fancy so desperately in love with her. He is no favourite of mine,
as you well know, Emma; but you must think him agreeable. Can you
lay your hand on your heart, and say you do not?"</p>
<p>"Indeed, I can, both hands, and spread to their widest
extent."</p>
<p>"I should like to know the man you do think agreeable."</p>
<p>"His name is Howard."</p>
<p>"Howard! Dear me; I cannot think of him but as playing cards
with Lady Osborne, and looking proud. I must own, however, that it
is a relief to me to find you can speak as you do of Tom Musgrave.
My heart did misgive me that you would like him too well. You
talked so stoutly beforehand, that I was sadly afraid your brag
would be punished. I only hope it will last, and that he will not
come on to pay you much attention. It is a hard thing for a woman
to stand against the flattering ways of a man, when he is bent upon
pleasing her."</p>
<p>As their quietly sociable little meal concluded, Miss Watson
could not help observing how comfortably it had passed.</p>
<p>"It is so delightful to me," said she, "to have things going on
in peace and good-humour. Nobody can tell how much I hate
quarrelling. Now, though we have had nothing but fried beef, how
good it has all seemed! I wish everybody were as easily satisfied
as you; but poor Margaret is very snappish, and Penelope owns she
had rather have quarrelling going on than nothing at all."</p>
<p>Mr. Watson returned in the evening not the worse for the
exertion of the day, and, consequently pleased with what he had
done, and glad to talk of it over his own fireside. Emma had not
foreseen any interest to herself in the occurrences of a
visitation; but when she heard Mr. Howard spoken of as the
preacher, and as having given them an excellent sermon, she could
not help listening with a quicker ear.</p>
<p>"I do not know when I have heard a discourse more to my mind,"
continued Mr. Watson, "or one better delivered. He reads extremely
well, with great propriety, and in a very impressive manner, and at
the same time without any theatrical grimace or violence. I own I
do not like much action in the pulpit; I do not like the studied
air and artificial inflexions of voice which your very popular and
most admired preachers generally have. A simple delivery is much
better calculated to inspire devotion, and shows a much better
taste. Mr. Howard read like a scholar and a gentleman."</p>
<p>"And what had you for dinner, sir?" said his eldest
daughter.</p>
<p>He related the dishes, and told what he had ate himself.</p>
<p>"Upon the whole," he added, "I have had a very comfortable day.
My old friends were quite surprised to see me amongst them, and I
must say that everybody paid me great attention, and seemed to feel
for me as an invalid. They would make me sit near the fire; and as
the partridges were pretty high, Dr. Richards would have them sent
away to the other end of the table, `that they might not offend Mr.
Watson,' which I thought very kind of him. But what pleased me as
much as anything was Mr. Howard's attention. There is a pretty
steep flight of steps up to the room we dine in, which do not quite
agree with my gouty foot; and Mr. Howard walked by me from the
bottom to the top, and would make me take his arm. It struck me as
very becoming in so young a man; but I am sure I had no claim to
expect it, for I never saw him before in my life. By the by, he
inquired after one of my daughters; but I do not know which. I
suppose you know among yourselves."</p>
<p style="text-align:center">*</p>
<p>On the third day after the ball, as Nanny, at five minutes
before three, was beginning to bustle into the parlour with the
tray and the knife-case, she was suddenly called to the front door
by the sound of as smart a rap as the end of a riding-whip could
give; and though charged by Miss Watson to let nobody in, returned
in half a minute with a look of awkward dismay to hold the parlour
door open for Lord Osborne and Tom Musgrave. The surprise of the
young ladies may be imagined. No visitors would have been welcome
at such a moment, but such visitors as these&mdash;such a one as
Lord Osborne at least, a nobleman and a stranger&mdash;was really
distressing.</p>
<p>He looked a little embarrassed himself, as, on being introduced
by his easy, voluble friend, he muttered something of doing himself
the honour of waiting upon Mr. Watson. Though Emma could not but
take the compliment of the visit to herself, she was very far from
enjoying it. She felt all the inconsistency of such an acquaintance
with the very humble style in which they were obliged to live; and
having in her aunt's family been used to many of the elegancies of
life, was fully sensible of all that must be open to the ridicule
of richer people in her present home. Of the pain of such feelings,
Elizabeth knew very little. Her simple mind, or juster reason,
saved her from such mortification; and though shrinking under a
general sense of inferiority, she felt no particular shame. Mr.
Watson, as the gentlemen had already heard from Nanny, was not well
enough to be down-stairs. With much concern they took their seats;
Lord Osborne near Emma, and the convenient Mr. Musgrave, in high
spirits at his own importance, on the other side of the fireplace,
with Elizabeth. He was at no loss for words; but when Lord Osborne
had hoped that Emma had not caught cold at the ball, he had nothing
more to say for some time, and could only gratify his eye by
occasional glances at his fair neighbour. Emma was not inclined to
give herself much trouble for his entertainment; and after hard
labour of mind, he produced the remark of its being a very fine
day, and followed it up with the question of, "Have you been
walking this morning?"</p>
<p>"No, my lord; we thought it too dirty."</p>
<p>"You should wear half-boots." After another pause: "Nothing sets
off a neat ankle more than a half-boot; nankeen galoshed with black
looks very well. Do not you like half-boots?"</p>
<p>"Yes; but unless they are so stout as to injure their beauty,
they are not fit for country walking."</p>
<p>"Ladies should ride in dirty weather. Do you ride?"</p>
<p>"No, my lord."</p>
<p>"I wonder every lady does not; a woman never looks better than
on horseback."</p>
<p>"But every woman may not have the inclination, or the
means."</p>
<p>"If they knew how much it became them, they would all have the
inclination; and I fancy, Miss Watson, when once they had the
inclination, the means would soon follow."</p>
<p>"Your lordship thinks we always have our own way. That is a
point on which ladies and gentlemen have long disagreed; but
without pretending to decide it, I may say that there are some
circumstances which even <i>women</i> cannot control. Female
economy will do a great deal my lord: but it cannot turn a small
income into a large one."</p>
<p>Lord Osborne was silenced. Her manner had been neither
sententious nor sarcastic; but there was a something in its mild
seriousness, as well as in the words themselves, which made his
lordship think; and when he addressed her again, it was with a
degree of considerate propriety totally unlike the half-awkward,
half-fearless style of his former remarks. It was a new thing with
him to wish to please a woman; it was the first time that he had
ever felt what was due to a woman in Emma's situation; but as he
wanted neither in sense nor a good disposition, he did not feel it
without effect.</p>
<p>"You have not been long in this country, I understand," said he,
in the tone of a gentleman. "I hope you are pleased with it."</p>
<p>He was rewarded by a gracious answer, and a more liberal full
view of her face than she had yet bestowed. Unused to exert
himself, and happy in contemplating her, he then sat in silence for
some minutes longer, while Tom Musgrave was chattering to
Elizabeth; till they were interrupted by Nanny's approach, who,
half-opening the door and putting in her head, said,&mdash;</p>
<p>"Please, ma'am, master wants to know why he ben't to have his
dinner?"</p>
<p>The gentlemen, who had hitherto disregarded every symptom,
however positive, of the nearness of that meal, now jumped up with
apologies, while Elizabeth called briskly after Nanny "to tell
Betty to take up the fowls."</p>
<p>"I am sorry it happens so," she added, turning good-humouredly
towards Musgrave, "but you know what early hours we keep."</p>
<p>Tom had nothing to say for himself; he knew it very well, and
such honest simplicity, such shameless truth, rather bewildered
him. Lord Osborne's parting compliments took some time, his
inclination for speech seeming to increase with the shortness of
the term for indulgence. He recommended exercise in defiance of
dirt; spoke again in praise of half-boots; begged that his sister
might be allowed to send Emma the name of her shoemaker; and
concluded with saying, "My hounds will be hunting this country next
week. I believe they will throw off at Stanton Wood on Wednesday at
nine o'clock. I mention this in hopes of your being drawn out to
see what's going on. If the morning's tolerable, pray do us the
honour of giving us your good wishes in person."</p>
<p>The sisters looked on each other with astonishment when their
visitors had withdrawn.</p>
<p>"Here's an unaccountable honour!" cried Elizabeth, at last. "Who
would have thought of Lord Osborne's coming to Stanton? He is very
handsome; but Tom Musgrave looks all to nothing the smartest and
most fashionable man of the two. I am glad he did not say anything
to me; I would not have had to talk to such a great man for the
world. Tom was very agreeable, was not he? But did you hear him ask
where Miss Penelope and Miss Margaret were, when he first came in?
It put me out of patience. I am glad Nanny had not laid the cloth,
however&mdash; it would have looked so awkward; just the tray did
not signify." To say that Emma was not flattered by Lord Osborne's
visit would be to assert a very unlikely thing, and describe a very
odd young lady; but the gratification was by no means unalloyed:
his coming was a sort of notice which might please her vanity, but
did not suit her pride; and she would rather have known that he
wished the visit without presuming to make it, than have seen him
at Stanton.</p>
<p>Among other unsatisfactory feelings, it once occurred to her to
wonder why Mr. Howard had not taken the same privilege of coming,
and accompanied his lordship; but she was willing to suppose that
he had either known nothing about it, or had declined any share in
a measure which carried quite as much impertinence in its form as
good-breeding. Mr. Watson was very far from being delighted when he
heard what had passed; a little peevish under immediate pain, and
ill-disposed to be pleased, he only replied,&mdash;</p>
<p>"Phoo! phoo! what occasion could there be for Lord Osborne's
coming? I have lived here fourteen years without being noticed by
any of the family. It is some foolery of that idle fellow, Tom
Musgrave. I cannot return the visit. I would not if I could." And
when Tom Musgrave was met with again, he was commissioned with a
message of excuse to Osborne Castle, on the too-sufficient plea of
Mr. Watson's infirm state of health.</p>
<p>A week or ten days rolled quietly away after this visit before
any new bustle arose to interrupt even for half a day the tranquil
and affectionate intercourse of the two sisters, whose mutual
regard was increasing with the intimate knowledge of each other
which such intercourse produced. The first circumstance to break in
on this security was the receipt of a letter from Croydon to
announce the speedy return of Margaret, and a visit of two or three
days from Mr. and Mrs. Robert Watson, who undertook to bring her
home, and wished to see their sister Emma.</p>
<p>It was an expectation to fill the thoughts of the sisters at
Stanton, and to busy the hours of one of them at least; for as Jane
had been a woman of fortune, the preparations for her entertainment
were considerable; and as Elizabeth had at all times more goodwill
than method in her guidance of the house, she could make no change
without a bustle. An absence of fourteen years had made all her
brothers and sisters strangers to Emma, but in her expectation of
Margaret there was more than the awkwardness of such an alienation;
she had heard things which made her dread her return; and the day
which brought the party to Stanton seemed to her the probable
conclusion of almost all that had been comfortable in the
house.</p>
<p>Robert Watson was an attorney at Croydon, in a good way of
business; very well satisfied with himself for the same, and for
having married the only daughter of the attorney to whom he had
been clerk, with a fortune of six thousand pounds. Mrs. Robert was
not less pleased with herself for having had that six thousand
pounds, and for being now in possession of a very smart house in
Croydon, where she gave genteel parties and wore fine clothes. In
her person there was nothing remarkable; her manners were pert and
conceited. Margaret was not without beauty; she had a slight pretty
figure, and rather wanted countenance than good features; but the
sharp and anxious expression of her face made her beauty in general
little felt. On meeting her long-absent sister, as on every
occasion of show, her manner was all affection and her voice all
gentleness; continual smiles and a very slow articulation being her
constant resource when determined on pleasing.</p>
<p>She was now so "delighted to see dear, dear Emma," that she
could hardly speak a word in a minute.</p>
<p>"I am sure we shall be great friends," she observed with much
sentiment, as they were sitting together. Emma scarcely knew how to
answer such a proposition, and the manner in which it was spoken
she could not attempt to equal. Mrs. Robert Watson eyed her with
much familiar curiosity and triumphant compassion: the loss of the
aunt's fortune was uppermost in her mind at the moment of meeting;
and she could not but feel how much better it was to be the
daughter of a gentleman of property in Croydon than the niece of an
old woman who threw herself away on an Irish captain. Robert was
carelessly kind, as became a prosperous man and a brother; more
intent on settling with the post-boy, inveighing against the
exorbitant advance in posting, and pondering over a doubtful
half-crown, than on welcoming a sister who was no longer likely to
have any property for him to get the direction of.</p>
<p>"Your road through the village is infamous, Elizabeth," said he;
"worse than ever it was. By Heaven! I would indict it if I lived
near you. Who is surveyor now?"</p>
<p>There was a little niece at Croydon to be fondly inquired after
by the kind-hearted Elizabeth, who regretted very much her not
being of the party.</p>
<p>"You are very good," replied her mother, "and I assure you it
went very hard with Augusta to have us come away without her. I was
forced to say we were only going to church, and promise to come
back for her directly. But you know it would not do to bring her
without her maid, and I am as particular as ever in having her
properly attended to."</p>
<p>"Sweet little darling!" cried Margaret. "It quite broke my heart
to leave her."</p>
<p>"Then why was you in such a hurry to run away from her?" cried
Mrs. Robert. "You are a sad, shabby girl. I have been quarrelling
with you all the way we came, have not I? Such a visit as this, I
never heard of! You know how glad we are to have any of you with
us, if it be for months together; and I am sorry" (with a witty
smile) "we have not been able to make Croydon agreeable this
autumn."</p>
<p>"My dearest Jane, do not overpower me with your raillery. You
know what inducements I had to bring me home. Spare me, I entreat
you. I am no match for your arch sallies."</p>
<p>"Well, I only beg you will not set your neighbours against the
place. Perhaps Emma may be tempted to go back with us and stay till
Christmas, if you don't put in your word."</p>
<p>Emma was greatly obliged. "I assure you we have very good
society at Croydon. I do not much attend the balls, they are rather
too mixed; but our parties are very select and good. I had seven
tables last week in my drawing-room. Are you fond of the country?
How do you like Stanton?"</p>
<p>"Very much," replied Emma, who thought a comprehensive answer
most to the purpose. She saw that her sister-in-law despised her
immediately. Mrs. Robert Watson was indeed wondering what sort of a
home Emma could possibly have been used to in Shropshire, and
setting it down as certain that the aunt could never have had six
thousand pounds.</p>
<p>"How charming Emma is," whispered Margaret to Mrs. Robert, in
her most languishing tone. Emma was quite distressed by such
behaviour; and she did not like it better when she heard Margaret
five minutes afterwards say to Elizabeth in a sharp, quick accent,
totally unlike the first, "Have you heard from Pen since she went
to Chichester? I had a letter the other day. I don't find she is
likely to make anything of it. I fancy she'll come back `Miss
Penelope,' as she went."</p>
<p>Such, she feared, would be Margaret's common voice when the
novelty of her own appearance were over; the tone of artificial
sensibility was not recommended by the idea. The ladies were
invited upstairs to prepare for dinner.</p>
<p>"I hope you will find things tolerably comfortable, Jane," said
Elizabeth, as she opened the door of the spare bedchamber.</p>
<p>"My good creature," replied Jane, "use no ceremony with me, I
entreat you. I am one of those who always take things as they find
them. I hope I can put up with a small apartment for two or three
nights without making a piece of work. I always wish to be treated
quite en famille when I come to see you. And now I do hope you have
not been getting a great dinner for us. Remember, we never eat
suppers."</p>
<p>"I suppose," said Margaret, rather quickly to Emma, "you and I
are to be together; Elizabeth always takes care to have a room to
herself."</p>
<p>"No. Elizabeth gives me half hers."</p>
<p>"Oh!" in a softened voice, and rather mortified to find that she
was not ill-used, "I am sorry I am not to have the pleasure of your
company, especially as it makes me nervous to be much alone."</p>
<p>Emma was the first of the females in the parlour again; on
entering it she found her brother alone.</p>
<p>"So, Emma," said he, "you are quite a stranger at home. It must
seem odd enough for you to be here. A pretty piece of work your
Aunt Turner has made of it! By Heaven! a woman should never be
trusted with money. I always said she ought to have settled
something on you, as soon as her husband died."</p>
<p>"But that would have been trusting me with money," replied Emma;
"and I am a woman too."</p>
<p>"It might have been secured to your future use, without your
having any power over it now. What a blow it must have been upon
you! To find yourself, instead of heiress of eight or nine thousand
pounds, sent back a weight upon your family, without a sixpence. I
hope the old woman will smart for it."</p>
<p>"Do not speak disrespectfully of her; she was very good to me,
and if she has made an imprudent choice, she will suffer more from
it herself than I can possibly do."</p>
<p>"I do not mean to distress you, but you know everybody must
think her an old fool. I thought Turner had been reckoned an
extraordinarily sensible, clever man. How the devil came he to make
such a will?"</p>
<p>"My uncle's sense is not at all impeached in my opinion by his
attachment to my aunt. She had been an excellent wife to him. The
most liberal and enlightened minds are always the most confiding.
The event has been unfortunate; but my uncle's memory is, if
possible, endeared to me by such a proof of tender respect for my
aunt."</p>
<p>"That's odd sort of talking. He might have provided decently for
his widow, without leaving everything that he had to dispose of, or
any part of it, at her mercy."</p>
<p>"My aunt may have erred," said Emma, warmly; "she has erred, but
my uncle's conduct was faultless. I was her own niece, and he left
to herself the power and the pleasure of providing for me."</p>
<p>"But unluckily she has left the pleasure of providing for you to
your father, and without the power. That's the long and short of
the business. After keeping you at a distance from your family for
such a length of time as must do away all natural affection among
us, and breeding you up (I suppose) in a superior style, you are
returned upon their hands without a sixpence."</p>
<p>"You know," replied Emma, struggling with her tears, "my uncle's
melancholy state of health. He was a greater invalid than my
father. He could not leave home."</p>
<p>"I do not mean to make you cry," said Robert, rather softened,
&mdash;and after a short silence, by way of changing the subject,
he added: "I am just come from my father's room; he seems very
indifferent. It will be a sad break up when he dies. Pity you can
none of you get married! You must come to Croydon as well as the
rest, and see what you can do there. I believe if Margaret had had
a thousand or fifteen hundred pounds, there was a young man who
would have thought of her."</p>
<p>Emma was glad when they were joined by the others; it was better
to look at her sister-in-law's finery than listen to Robert, who
had equally irritated and grieved her. Mrs. Robert, exactly as
smart as she had been at her own party, came in with apologies for
her dress.</p>
<p>"I would not make you wait," said she; "so I put on the first
thing I met with. I am afraid I am a sad figure. My dear Mr. W.,"
(to her husband) "you have not put any fresh powder in your
hair."</p>
<p>"No, I do not intend it. I think there is powder enough in my
hair for my wife and sisters."</p>
<p>"Indeed, you ought to make some alteration in your dress before
dinner when you are out visiting, though you do not at home."</p>
<p>"Nonsense."</p>
<p>"It is very odd you should not like to do what other gentlemen
do. Mr. Marshall and Mr. Hemmings change their dress every day of
their lives before dinner. And what was the use of my putting up
your last new coat, if you are never to wear it?"</p>
<p>"Do be satisfied with being fine yourself, and leave your
husband alone."</p>
<p>To put an end to this altercation and soften the evident
vexation of her sister-in-law, Emma (though in no spirits to make
such nonsense easy), began to admire her gown. It produced
immediate complacency.</p>
<p>"Do you like it?" said she. "I am very happy. It has been
excessively admired; but sometimes I think the pattern too large. I
shall wear one tomorrow that I think you will prefer to this. Have
you seen the one I gave Margaret?"</p>
<p>Dinner came, and except when Mrs. Robert looked at her husband's
head, she continued gay and flippant, chiding Elizabeth for the
profusion on the table, and absolutely protesting against the
entrance of the roast turkey, which formed the only exception to
"You see your dinner."&mdash;"I do beg and entreat that no turkey
may be seen today. I am really frightened out of my wits with the
number of dishes we have already. Let us have no turkey, I beseech
you."</p>
<p>"My dear," replied Elizabeth, "the turkey is roasted, and it may
just as well come in as stay in the kitchen. Besides, if it is cut,
I am in hopes my father may be tempted to eat a bit, for it is
rather a favourite dish."</p>
<p>"You may have it in, my dear; but I assure you I sha'n't touch
it."</p>
<p>Mr. Watson had not been well enough to join the party at dinner,
but was prevailed on to come down and drink tea with them.</p>
<p>"I wish we may be able to have a game of cards tonight," said
Elizabeth to Mrs. Robert, after seeing her father comfortably
seated in his arm-chair.</p>
<p>"Not on my account, my dear, I beg. You know I am no
card-player. I think a snug chat infinitely better. I always say
cards are very well sometimes to break a formal circle, but one
never wants them among friends."</p>
<p>"I was thinking of its being something to amuse my father," said
Elizabeth, "if it was not disagreeable to you. He says his head
won't bear whist, but perhaps if we make a round game he may be
tempted to sit down with us."</p>
<p>"By all means, my dear creature. I am quite at your service;
only do not oblige me to choose the game, that's all. Speculation
is the only round game at Croydon now, but I can play anything.
When there is only one or two of you at home, you must be quite at
a loss to amuse him. Why do you not get him to play at cribbage?
Margaret and I have played at cribbage most nights that we have not
been engaged."</p>
<p>A sound like a distant carriage was at this moment caught;
everybody listened; it became more decided; it certainly drew
nearer. It was an unusual sound for Stanton at any time of the day,
for the village was on no very public road, and contained no
gentleman's family but the rector's. The wheels rapidly approached;
in two minutes the general expectation was answered; they stopped
beyond a doubt at the garden-gate of the parsonage. "Who could it
be? It was certainly a postchaise. Penelope was the only creature
to be thought of; she might perhaps have met with some unexpected
opportunity of returning." A pause of suspense ensued. Steps were
distinguished along the paved foot-way, which led under the windows
of the house to the front door, and then within the passage. They
were the steps of a man. It could not be Penelope. It must be
Samuel. The door opened, and displayed Tom Musgrave in the wrap of
a traveller. He had been in London, and was now on his way home,
and he had come half-a-mile out of his road merely to call for ten
minutes at Stanton. He loved to take people by surprise with sudden
visits at extraordinary seasons, and, in the present instance, had
had the additional motive of being able to tell the Miss Watsons,
whom he depended on finding sitting quietly employed after tea,
that he was going home to an eight-o'clock dinner.</p>
<p>As it happened, however, he did not give more surprise than he
received, when, instead of being shown into the usual little
sitting-room, the door of the best parlour (a foot larger each way
than the other) was thrown open, and he beheld a circle of smart
people whom he could not immediately recognize arranged, with all
the honours of visiting, round the fire, and Miss Watson seated at
the best Pembroke table, with the best tea-things before her. He
stood a few seconds in silent amazement. "Musgrave!" ejaculated
Margaret, in a tender voice. He recollected himself, and came
forward, delighted to find such a circle of friends, and blessing
his good fortune for the unlooked-for indulgence. He shook hands
with Robert, bowed and smiled to the ladies, and did everything
very prettily; but as to any particularity of address or emotion
towards Margaret, Emma, who closely observed him, perceived nothing
that did not justify Elizabeth's opinion, though Margaret's modest
smiles imported that she meant to take the visit to herself. He was
persuaded without much difficulty to throw off his great-coat and
drink tea with them. For "whether he dined at eight or nine," as he
observed, "was a matter of very little consequence;" and without
seeming to seek, he did not turn away from the chair close by
Margaret, which she was assiduous in providing him. She had thus
secured him from her sisters, but it was not immediately in her
power to preserve him from her brother's claims; for as he came
avowedly from London, and had left it only four hours ago, the last
current report as to public news, and the general opinion of the
day, must be understood before Robert could let his attention be
yielded to the less national and important demands of the women. At
last, however, he was at liberty to hear Margaret's soft address,
as she spoke her fears of his having had a most terrible cold,
dark, dreadful journey.</p>
<p>"Indeed, you should not have set out so late."</p>
<p>"I could not be earlier," he replied. "I was detained chatting
at the Bedford by a friend. All hours are alike to me. How long
have you been in the country, Miss Margaret?"</p>
<p>"We only came this morning; my kind brother and sister brought
me home this very morning. 'Tis singular, is not it?"</p>
<p>"You were gone a great while, were not you? A fortnight, I
suppose?"</p>
<p>"You may call a fortnight a great while, Mr. Musgrave," said
Mrs. Robert, sharply; "but we think a month very little. I assure
you we bring her home at the end of a month much against our
will."</p>
<p>"A month! Have you really been gone a month? 'Tis amazing how
time flies."</p>
<p>"You may imagine," said Margaret, in a sort of whisper, "what
are my sensations in finding myself once more at Stanton; you know
what a sad visitor I make. And I was so excessively impatient to
see Emma; I dreaded the meeting, and at the same time longed for
it. Do you not comprehend the sort of feeling?"</p>
<p>"Not at all," cried he, aloud: "I could never dread a meeting
with Miss Emma Watson&mdash;or any of her sisters."</p>
<p>It was lucky that he added that finish.</p>
<p>"Were you speaking to me?" said Emma, who had caught her own
name.</p>
<p>"Not absolutely," he answered; "but I was thinking of you, as
many at a greater distance are probably doing at this moment. Fine
open weather, Miss Emma, charming season for hunting."</p>
<p>"Emma is delightful, is not she?" whispered Margaret; "I have
found her more than answer my warmest hopes. Did you ever see
anything more perfectly beautiful? I think even you must be a
convert to a brown complexion."</p>
<p>He hesitated. Margaret was fair herself, and he did not
particularly want to compliment her; but Miss Osborne and Miss Carr
were likewise fair, and his devotion to them carried the day.</p>
<p>"Your sister's complexion," said he, at last, "is as fine as a
dark complexion can be; but I still profess my preference of a
white skin. You have seen Miss Osborne? She is my model for a truly
feminine complexion, and she is very fair."</p>
<p>"Is she fairer than me?"</p>
<p>Tom made no reply. "Upon my honour, ladies," said he, giving a
glance over his own person, "I am highly indebted to your
condescension for admitting me in such <i>dshabille</i> into your
drawing-room. I really did not consider how unfit I was to be here,
or I hope I should have kept my distance. Lady Osborne would tell
me that I were growing as careless as her son, if she saw me in
this condition."</p>
<p>The ladies were not wanting in civil returns, and Robert Watson,
stealing a view of his own head in an opposite glass, said with
equal civility,&mdash;</p>
<p>"You cannot be more in <i>dshabille</i> than myself. We got
here so late that I had not time even to put a little fresh powder
in my hair."</p>
<p>Emma could not help entering into what she supposed her
sister-in-law's feelings at the moment.</p>
<p>When the tea-things were removed, Tom began to talk of his
carriage; but the old card-table being set out, and the fish and
counters, with a tolerably clean pack, brought forward from the
buffet by Miss Watson, the general voice was so urgent with him to
join their party that he agreed to allow himself another quarter of
an hour. Even Emma was pleased that he would stay, for she was
beginning to feel that a family party might be the worst of all
parties; and the others were delighted.</p>
<p>"What's your game?" cried he, as they stood round the table.</p>
<p>"Speculation, I believe," said Elizabeth. "My sister recommends
it, and I fancy we all like it. I know you do, Tom."</p>
<p>"It is the only round game played at Croydon now," said Mrs.
Robert; "we never think of any other. I am glad it is a favourite
with you."</p>
<p>"Oh, me!" said Tom. "Whatever you decide on will be a favourite
with <i>me</i>. I have had some pleasant hours at speculation in my
time, but I have not been in the way of it now for a long while.
Vingt-un is the game at Osborne Castle. I have played nothing but
vingt-un of late. You would be astonished to hear the noise we make
there&mdash;the fine old lofty drawing-room rings again. Lady
Osborne sometimes declares she cannot hear herself speak. Lord
Osborne enjoys it famously, and he makes the best dealer without
exception that I ever beheld,&mdash; such quickness and spirit, he
lets nobody dream over their cards. I wish you could see him
overdraw himself on both his own cards. It is worth anything in the
world!"</p>
<p>"Dear me!" cried Margaret, "why should not we play at vingt-un?
I think it is a much better game than <i>Speculation</i>. I cannot
say I am very fond of <i>Speculation</i>."</p>
<p>Mrs. Robert offered not another word in support of the game. She
was quite vanquished, and the fashions of Osborne Castle carried it
over the fashions of Croydon.</p>
<p>"Do you see much of the parsonage family at the castle, Mr.
Musgrave?" said Emma, as they were taking their seats.</p>
<p>"Oh, yes; they are almost always there. Mrs. Blake is a nice
little good-humoured woman; she and I are sworn friends; and
Howard's a very gentlemanlike, good sort of fellow! You are not
forgotten, I assure you, by any of the party. I fancy you must have
a little cheek-glowing now and then, Miss Emma. Were not you rather
warm last Saturday about nine or ten o'clock in the evening? I will
tell you how it was,&mdash; I see you are dying to know. Says
Howard to Lord Osborne&mdash;"</p>
<p>At this interesting moment he was called on by the others to
regulate the game, and determine some disputable point; and his
attention was so totally engaged in the business, and afterwards by
the course of the game, as never to revert to what he had been
saying before; and Emma, though suffering a good deal from
curiosity, dared not remind him.</p>
<p>He proved a very useful addition to their table. Without him, it
would have been a party of such very near relations as could have
felt little interest, and perhaps maintained little complaisance;
but his presence gave variety and secured good manners. He was, in
fact, excellently qualified to shine at a round game, and few
situations made him appear to greater advantage. He played with
spirit, and had a great deal to say; and, though no wit himself,
could sometimes make use of the wit of an absent friend, and had a
lively way of retailing a common-place or saying a mere nothing,
that had great effect at a card-table. The ways and good jokes of
Osborne Castle were now added to his ordinary means of
entertainment. He repeated the smart sayings of one lady, detailed
the oversights of another, and indulged them even with a copy of
Lord Osborne's style of overdrawing himself on both cards.</p>
<p>The clock struck nine while he was thus agreeably occupied; and
when Nanny came in with her master's basin of gruel, he had the
pleasure of observing to Mr. Watson that he should leave him at
supper while he went home to dinner himself. The carriage was
ordered to the door, and no entreaties for his staying longer could
now avail; for he well knew that if he stayed he must sit down to
supper in less than ten minutes, which to a man whose heart had
been long fixed on calling his next meal a dinner, was quite
insupportable. On finding him determined to go, Margaret began to
wink and nod at Elizabeth to ask him to dinner for the following
day, and Elizabeth at last not able to resist hints which her own
hospitable, social temper more than half seconded, gave the
invitation: "Would he give Robert the meeting, they should be very
happy?"</p>
<p>"With the greatest pleasure;"was his first reply. In a moment
afterwards, "That is, if I can possibly get here in time; but I
shoot with Lord Osborne, and therefore must not engage. You will
not think of me unless you see me." And so he departed, delighted
with the uncertainty in which he had left it.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">*</p>
<p>Margaret, in the joy of her heart under circumstances which she
chose to consider as peculiarly propitious, would willingly have
made a confidante of Emma when they were alone for a short time the
next morning, and had proceeded so far as to say, "The young man
who was here last night, my dear Emma, and returns today, is more
interesting to me than perhaps you may be aware&mdash;"; but Emma,
pretending to understand nothing extraordinary in the words, made
some very inapplicable reply, and jumping up, ran away from a
subject which was odious to her feelings. As Margaret would not
allow a doubt to be repeated of Musgrave's coming to dinner,
preparations were made for his entertainment much exceeding what
had been deemed necessary the day before; and taking the office of
superintendence entirely from her sister, she was half the morning
in the kitchen herself, directing and scolding.</p>
<p>After a great deal of indifferent cooking and anxious suspense,
however, they were obliged to sit down without their guest. Tom
Musgrave never came; and Margaret was at no pains to conceal her
vexation under the disappointment, or repress the peevishness of
her temper. The peace of the party for the remainder of that day
and the whole of the next, which comprised the length of Robert's
and Jane's visit, was continually invaded by her fretful
displeasure and querulous attacks. Elizabeth was the usual object
of both. Margaret had just respect enough for her brother's and
sister's opinion to behave properly by them, but Elizabeth and the
maids could never do anything right; and Emma, whom she seemed no
longer to think about, found the continuance of the gentle voice
beyond her calculation short. Eager to be as little among them as
possible, Emma was delighted with the alternative of sitting above
with her father, and warmly entreated to be his constant companion
each evening; and as Elizabeth loved company of any kind too well
not to prefer being below at all risks; as she had rather talk of
Croydon with Jane, with every interruption of Margaret's
perverseness, than sit with only her father, who frequently could
not endure talking at all,&mdash;the affair was so settled, as soon
as she could be persuaded to believe it no sacrifice on her
sister's part. To Emma, the change was most acceptable and
delightful. Her father, if ill, required little more than
gentleness and silence, and being a man of sense and education,
was, if able to converse, a welcome companion. In his chamber Emma
was at peace from the dreadful mortifications of unequal society
and family discord; from the immediate endurance of hard-hearted
prosperity, low-minded conceit, and wrong-headed folly, engrafted
on an untoward disposition. She still suffered from them in the
contemplation of their existence, in memory and in prospect; but
for the moment, she ceased to be tortured by their effects. She was
at leisure; she could read and think, though her situation was
hardly such as to make reflection very soothing. The evils arising
from the loss of her uncle were neither trifling nor likely to
lessen; and when thought had been freely indulged, in contrasting
the past and the present, the employment of mind and dissipation of
unpleasant ideas which only reading could produce made her
thankfully turn to a book.</p>
<p>The change in her home, society, and style of life, in
consequence of the death of one friend and the imprudence of
another, had indeed been striking. From being the first object of
hope and solicitude to an uncle who had formed her mind with the
care of a parent, and of tenderness to an aunt whose amiable temper
had delighted to give her every indulgence; from being the life and
spirit of a house where all had been comfort and elegance, and the
expected heiress of an easy independence, she was become of
importance to no one,&mdash;a burden on those whose affections she
could not expect, an addition in a house already overstocked,
surrounded by inferior minds, with little chance of domestic
comfort, and as little hope of future support. It was well for her
that she was naturally cheerful, for the change had been such as
might have plunged weak spirits in despondence.</p>
<p>She was very much pressed by Robert and Jane to return with them
to Croydon, and had some difficulty in getting a refusal accepted,
as they thought too highly of their own kindness and situation to
suppose the offer could appear in a less advantageous light to
anybody else. Elizabeth gave them her interest, though evidently
against her own, in privately urging Emma to go.</p>
<p>"You do not know what you refuse, Emma," said she, "nor what you
have to bear at home. I would advise you by all means to accept the
invitation; there is always something lively going on at Croydon.
You will be in company almost every day, and Robert and Jane will
be very kind to you. As for me, I shall be no worse off without you
than I have been used to be; but poor Margaret's disagreeable ways
are new to you, and they would vex you more than you think for, if
you stay at home."</p>
<p>Emma was of course uninfluenced, except to greater esteem for
Elizabeth, by such representations, and the visitors departed
without her.</p>

364.<br>
<br>
When the author's sister, Cassandra, showed the manuscript of this
work to some of her nieces, she also told them something of the
intended story; for with this dear sister&mdash;though, I believe,
with no one else&mdash;Jane seems to have talked freely of any work
she might have in hand. Mr Watson was soon to die; and Emma to
become dependent for a home on her narrow-minded sister-in-law and
brother. She was to decline an offer of marriage from Lord Osborne,
and much of the interest of the tale was to arise from Lady
Osborne's love for Mr Howard, and his counter affection for Emma,
whom he was finally to marry.</p>
