<h1>The Anaconda</h1>

<h4>by</h4>

<h2>Matthew Gregory Lewis</h2>

<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>'The Lord in heaven forbid!' exclaimed the old man, while every
limb was convulsed with horror, the blood forsook his cheeks, and he
clasped his hands in agony; 'but the thing is impossible!' he
resumed, after a few moments passed in reflection, 'absolutely
impossible! What! Everard? a boy, whose childhood was passed under my
own roof, under my very eye? whose manners are so mild, who was ever
so gentle, so grateful, so kind; whose heart I know as well as I do
my own. Bless my soul, sister Milman, what a fright you have given
me! But it's no great matter now, for, when I reflect upon this
history of yours, I see clearly that the thing is quite impossible,
and so there's an end of it.'</p>

<p>'Now was there ever anything so provoking! Brother, brother, let
me tell you, that at your time of life it is quite a shame to suffer
yourself to be so blinded by prejudice. His childhood was passed
under your roof, forsooth! but where did he pass his youth, I should
be glad to know? why, among tigers and alligators that swallow up
poor dear little children at a mouthful, and great ugly black-a-moor
monsters, who eat nothing but human flesh, heaven bless us! and
where's the great wonder, that living in such graceless company
Everard should have picked up some of their bloody tricks? Nay,
brother, to tell you a bit of my mind, for my own part I always
suspected, that there was something awkward in the manner by which he
came y such a sight of money; though, to be sure, I never imagined
that the business was half so bad as it proves to be.'</p>

<p>'Proves to be, sister! proves to be, indeed! Let me remind you
that you have proved nothing, though God knows you have asserted
enough to make every hair on my head stand on end: and as to his
fortune, I make no doubt that Everard can give as satisfactory an
account of his making it, as the honestest man within the bills of
mortality.'</p>

<p>'I should be glad to know then, why he so obstinately refuses to
give any account at all? It's above a year since he returned from the
East Indies, and yet there isn't a human being a bit better informed
on the subject than we were on the first day of his landing; though
I'm sure it's not for want of asking, for many and many a good hour
have I passed in pumping, and pumping, and yet here do I sit at this
moment no whit the wiser! He always puts on such a solemn look, and
takes the first opportunity of turning the conversation to something
else: nay, the other day, when I wouldn't be fobbed off with a
cock-and-a-bull story about heaven knows what, and put the question
home to him in so many words,--"By what means did you, Everard
Brooke, get so much money?" He turned his back plump upon me, and
stalked out of the room; which was no great proof of his
good-breeding, you'll say; but mercy upon us! good-breeding isn't
what the gentleman values himself upon, for it was but last Friday
that he bounced out of the room to call Towser off, who was barking
at a little dirty beggarboy, though he saw that I had dropped my
teaspoon, and was obliged to stoop for it myself! a great bear! but
indeed I expected nothing better from a man who has lived so long
among Hottentots.</p>

<p>'Well, sister! I dare say that he ought to have stopped to pick up
your teaspoon; though to be sure I can't find in my heart to blame
him very much for having gone first to rescue the beggar--boy, being
afraid that I should have committed exactly the same fault myself.
But you know I never pretended to good-breeding, and in all matters
of politeness, sister Milman, I must give way to your better
judgement and experience. However, I cannot be equally submissive
respecting the material point; and in spite of all that you have
advanced I must still maintain my opinion, that Everard came by his
money honestly, whatever you may have heard to the contrary.'</p>

<p>'Then why won't he let a body know how he came by it? Let me tell
you, brother, that when a man has anything good to tell of himself he
isn't so fond of holding his tongue; nay, for that matter, to hold
one's tongue at all isn't natural and I warrant you, whoever does so
has some good reason at bottom for submitting to such a disagreeable
restraint, if one could but get him to own it: and so think the
Williamsons, and the Joneses, and my cousin Dickins, and all the
family of the Burnabys: for I am not of so uncommunicative a temper
as your darling Everard, Heaven be praised for it! No; if I get a bit
of information, I am too generous to keep it to myself, and have no
peace, till all my neighbours are as well informed as I am. So this
morning, I no sooner got possession of this bloody story, than I
ordered my chariot, and drove round the village to communicate it to
all our friends and relations. To be sure, they were mightily shocked
at the account, as who wouldn't be? But they confessed, that they
always expected to find something wrong at the bottom of this
mystery, and they think it a mercy that I should have discovered the
truth, before things were gone too far between Everard and your
daughter Jessy.'</p>

<p>'And so you have been carrying this fine story all round the
village? I protest now, sister Jane, it seems to me, that you have
been giving yourself a great deal of very unnecessary trouble; and
if, after all, your assertions should prove to be unfounded, I know
not what recompence you can make poor Everard for this attempt to
blast his character. The most innocent circumstances may be so
construed as to wear an awkward appearance: there are always enough
ill-natured people in the world ready to spread about scandalous
reports, and Everard has too much merit not to have excited plenty of
enemies; and here you have just now picked up a strange,
unaccountable, rigmarole tale from one of these; and---'</p>

<p>'From one of his enemies,' exclaimed Mrs Milman, fanning herself
violently; 'very fine truly! when I heard the whole story with these
ears of mine from the mouth of his own little coffee--coloured
barbarian! Yes, to be sure! Mirza is a violent enemy of Mr Everard's,
that cannot be denied!'</p>

<p>The old merchant's face underwent a considerable change at hearing
these last sentences; he looked distressed, and rubbed his forehead
for some moments in evident anxiety.</p>

<p>'Mirza!' he repeated after a pause; 'sister Jane, recollect
yourself; this is no trifling matter! are you quite sure that Mirza
asserts the truth of the story which I have just heard you
relate?'</p>

<p>'I tell you, brother, for the second time, that I heard him tell
it with my own ears! not indeed all at once, for the wicked little
heathen knew too well how little it was to his master's credit that
the fact should get abroad. Ah! he is a cunning hand, I promise you!
But I went round about, and round about, and wormed and wormed, and
kept beating the bush, till I got it all out of him. I confess I was
obliged to promise faithfully that his master should never know a
syllable about it, for he said that it would give him pain to hear it
mentioned, as to be sure well it may; but, when I found what a
horrible secret it was, I had a great deal too much conscience to
keep my promise, and lost no time in making the monster's guilt known
to the whole neighbourhood.'</p>

<p>'Well, well sister! I won't pretend to say that you did wrong, and
I doubt not you acted from the best motives; but yet I can't help
wishing that you had acted otherwise! This Everard--poor, dear,
wicked fellow--he was once so good, so affectionate; I would have
betted all I have in the world, that it wasn't in his nature to kill
so much as a fly; and to murder a woman--a woman too that he had
promised to marry!'</p>

<p>'Aye! and to murder her in such a shocking manner too! First to
shoot at her from behind a hedge, and when he found the poor creature
was only wounded, to have the heart to run up to her, and actually
beat her brains out with a club! why, Mirza said, that he verily
believed that she was above half an hour dying.'</p>

<p>'I never heard of anything so horrible.'</p>

<p>'But what is worst, he wasn't contented with destroying the poor
girl's body; he had previously ruined her precious soul! It seems
that her name was Nancy O'Connor; an Irish family, I suppose. I once
knew an Irish officer of that name myself. I was but a girl then, and
danced with him at the Hackney Assembly, and a mighty genteel
comely-looking man he was, though he had but one eye; but that's
neither here nor there. Well, as I was telling you, this Nancy was
either the daughter or the wife of a rich planter, with whom Everard
lived as clerk, or factor, or something of that kind. Well! and so
this poor girl fell in love with Everard, and he on his side was
wonderfully attentive to Nancy; for Mirza says, that he passed whole
days and nights in watching her, and ogling her, so that she actually
could hardly stir without his knowing it; till at last he worked
himself so totally into her good graces, and got such an influence
over her mind, that (knowing his patron to have made a will entirely
in Nancy's favour) he persuaded her to poison poor Mr O'Connor, in
order that she might share his wealth with her abominable lover.'</p>

<p>'Poison her father! monstrous!'</p>

<p>'Her father, or her husband, for (as I said before) I am not
certain which; but I should rather suppose it was her father, for it
seems the poor deceived old man made it his dying request to her,
that she should make Everard her husband as soon as ever the funeral
was over: so you may judge how artfully the hypocrite must have
played his cards! Well! now it was supposed that Everard would
immediately have made Nancy Mrs Brooke: the settlements were all
drawn up; the clothes were bought; the wedding day was fixed: when,
lo and behold, what do you think the ungrateful monster did? He
persuaded the poor young creature to dispose of all her property; and
when it was converted into money, and jewels, and such like, he
enticed her into a wood, where he robbed and murdered her in the
manner which you have just heard; and then, getting on board a vessel
with his plunder in all haste, he managed to escape from Ceylon,
before the officers of justice had time to discover what was become
of him! The only thing which surprises me is, that he should have
brought away Mirza with him; but as the young heathen was then quite
a child, I suppose his master thought it probable that he knew
nothing of this bloody business, or would certainly forget it during
the voyage. And now, brother, what have you to say in behalf of your
fine Mr Everard? Ah! how often have I told you, over and over again,
I was certain that something bad would come out against him all in
good time! But you were obstinate; you still let him come dangling
about your house, and keep hankering and hankering after your
daughter Jessy; and now you may think yourself well off if the girl's
heart isn't fixed upon having the vagabond, and getting her brains
knocked out in her turn, like poor Miss Nancy O'Connor.'</p>

<p>Partial as the old man was to Everard, he could not but feel his
faith in him a good deal shaken by this long string of horrible
circumstances, and by the positive manner in which they were
advanced, And now flocked in one after another the Joneses, and the
Williamsons, and all the family of the Burnabys, with their
wondering, and their blessing themselves, and their exclamations, and
their pity for poor Miss O'Connor, and their having long suspected
nothing better. The good old man listened in silence, and sighed,
while they assailed him thus on all sides but though he could not
venture to contradict them he could not find it in his heart to join
in their censures of the man whom he had so long esteemed and whom he
still loved so tenderly But when at length cousin Dickins made his
appearance, (a man of great importance in this family for he was rich
a bachelor, advanced in years and Jessy's godfather) and announced
his thorough belief in Mrs Milman's story, it was no longer in old
Elmwood's power to remain neutral in the business He declared his
submission to cousin Dickins' better judgement, and his intention of
declining any further communication with Mr Brooke, for he no longer
dared to call him by the familiar and affectionate appellation of
Everard.</p>

<p>This declaration was received with great satisfaction by all
present, and the resolution was pronounced nem. con. to be extremely
judicious: the delinquent was at this time in London, whither he had
repaired (as it was suspected) for the purpose of ascertaining the
exact state of his property, in order that on his return he might lay
it before Elmwood, accompanied by a formal demand of his daughter's
hand, This absence was thought very fortunate by the company, as it
afforded the best opportunity for putting Jessy upon her guard; and
it was determined to summon her without loss of time, make known to
her the true character of the man with whom she had so imprudently
been suffered to associate, and insist upon her a solemn promise in
full convocation, that she would from that moment give up all
communication with him.</p>

<p>Jessy made her appearance. Alas! the fate of heart had been long
decided. As she listened to the strange tale, she sometimes coloured
with indignation against the accusers, and then again her cheeks grew
pale through fear lest the accusation should prove well founded. The
charge was concluded; the promise was demanded; yet still Jessy spoke
not, but sat absorbed in terror and grief. In vain was her love's
guilt repeated; in vain was she called upon to declare her abhorrence
at him; still Jessy only answered with her tears. Her friendly
relations turned up the white of their eyes at her blindness and
delusion; Mrs Milman was loud in exclaiming against the obstinacy and
wrong-headedness of young people, who would fancy themselves wiser
than their parents; and the formidable cousin Dickins, assuming one
of his most severe and dignified looks, insisted upon her giving an
immediate answer.</p>

<p>Terrified almost out of her senses at this formal address, the
trembling Jessy now contrived to sob out a hope that her aunt had
been mistaken, that Everard would still be able to prove his
innocence.--'Innocence!' so impossible a supposition was of itself
sufficient to set the whole assembly in an uproar: the Williamsons,
the Joneses, Cousin Dickins, and all the family of the Burnabys, gave
tongue at once; and above a dozen voices were still busy in affixing
the least flattering epithets possible to the name of Everard, when
the door opened, and Everard himself stood before them. He was just
returned from London, and had hastened to assure himself of Jessy's
welfare. In the next moment you might have heard a pin drop. The
debate had been carried on in too loud a tone to permit his being
ignorant of the nature of their disclosure; but, at all events, the
evident and universal embarrassment which his presence created, left
him no doubt that himself had been brought upon the carpet, and that
in a manner by no means to his credit. His sunburnt cheek glowed with
indignation, as he gazed round the circle, and requested to know the
meaning of those appellations by which, while ascending the stairs,
be had heard himself described.</p>

<p>The question being general, no person thought it necessary to take
it to himself. Each looked towards his neighbour, as if he expected
the answer to come from thence, and consequently all continued
silent. Everard now found it needful to particularize and turning to
Cousin Dickins (whose voice had been super--eminently loud) he
demanded of him the desired explanation.</p>

<p>'Why, really, Sir,' stammered out Cousin Dickins, adjusting his
neckcloth, in order to conceal his embarrassment; 'really, Mr
Everard--as to what was said--I can only say--that I said
nothing--that is to say, not that I quite said nothing--though, to
say truth, it was almost as good as nothing--for it was nothing from
my own knowledge--I only repeated--I only observed--that, if what Mrs
Milman said was true---'</p>

<p>'Mrs Milman?' interrupted Everard, 'that's enough; now then we get
a step nearer to the source of the business. Will you then, madam
have the goodness to explain your reason for applying such
opprobrious epithets to the name of Everard Brooke--a name which I am
bold to say deserves them as little as that of any person in this
society I wait for your reply, madam.'</p>

<p>'Well, sir, and by my faith you shall have it; answered Mrs
Milman, who by this time had recovered her mind, and was now resolved
to carry the business through with flying colours, by assuming a
double quantity of assurance. 'You shall have it, never fear! And if
it turns out that your name is really as good as any one's in the
company, and that you really did not poison the old gentleman, and
beat Miss Nancy's brains out, why then so much the better for you,
that's all, and there's no harm done.'</p>

<p>'Poison the old gentleman? Beat out Miss Nancy's brains? What Miss
Nancy? What old gentleman? Why, in the name of Heaven, Mrs Milman,
where did you pick up this farrago of nonsense?'</p>

<p>'I pick up, indeed! Let me tell you, sir, that I never picked up
anything, or anybody in my life; and that if you talk of picking up,
you are the much more likely person to pick up of the two. And now
I'm about it, I'll let you into another piece of my mind. It's
extremely rude in you to call my conversation a farrago of nonsense;
but truly it's no wonder, for I'm not the first lady that you have
treated with rudeness, Heaven knows! and more's the pity---Miss Nancy
for that!'</p>

<p>'Miss Nancy again!' exclaimed Everard, 'and who the devil then is
Miss Nancy?'</p>

<p>'What then you don't know Miss Nancy? No; never heard of Miss
Nancy O'Connor, I warrant?'</p>

<p>'No, madam; I never did.'</p>

<p>'Well, come, now, that is a good one! To beat a lady's brain out,
and then to cut her acquaintance, and pretend you know nothing about
her, is the finest piece of modern good breeding that I ever heard
of! Nay, indeed, I never expected much good breeding from you, sir,
ever since that affair of the teaspoon, but one thing I can tell you;
your little copper-coloured Hottentot, Mirza, sings a very different
song from you on this occasion; for I had the whole story from his
own lips.'</p>

<p>'From Mirza's? impossible!'</p>

<p>'It's not mighty polite in you to contradict one so plump, sir,
but no matter for that, I repeat it; Mirza told me himself that you
had poisoned a gentleman, and beat his daughter's brains out; and now
so much for that, and butter to fish. Nay, if you don't choose to
believe me, call the boy hither, and ask him; I desire no better, and
I see him playing in the garden at this moment.'</p>

<p>'And it shall be done instantly!' cried Everard, at the same time
throwing up the window--'Mirza! Mirza!'</p>

<p>Mirza was soon in the room.</p>

<p>'Pray, Mirza, what is the meaning---' began Everard, but Mrs
Milman immediately interrupted him.</p>

<p>'Silence, if you please, sir; I'll examine the boy myself. Come
here, Mirza; well, and how d'ye do, my dear? Pray, Mirza, what was
that pretty story you told me this morning about poisoning somebody,
and killing somebody with a club, and---'</p>

<p>'Oh! Missy! Missy!' cried Mirza, 'you no say dat! Massa tell me no
talk--Massa grieve--Massa angry.'</p>

<p>'No, no, child; he'll not he angry. He wants to hear how prettily
you tell the story, and so you must tell it all; mustn't he, Mr
Brooke?' Everard gave a sign of assent. 'You know, Mirza; it was all
about how your master made his fortune; well, and so, Mirza, (upon my
word, you're a very nice lad, and there's six-pence for you), well,
and so you say, Mirza, and so you say, my dear, that your master
killed her in a wood! what? did he kill her quite?'</p>

<p>'Iss, quite! She quite dead! Massa beat brains out wid great
club!'</p>

<p>'I, Mirza? exclaimed Everard; 'did I?'</p>

<p>'Iss, Dad you did, Massa! and God him bless you for it!'</p>

<p>'Bless him for it!' whispered Mrs Milman to Cousin Dickins,
'there's fine morality! the wicked little heathen! but you'll hear
more presently!' then turning again to the boy; 'well but, Mirza, you
told me something too about poisoning--what, I suppose, before your
master killed Miss Anne O'Connor.'</p>

<p>'Conda! Conda!' interrupted the boy.</p>

<p>'Condor, was it?' repeated Mrs Milman: 'well, well; Connor or
Condor the name makes no great difference. Well Mirza, and so you say
that this Anne O'Condor, instigated by your master, I suppose.'</p>

<p>'Oh! my massa! my massa!' shrieked Mirra in a tone of agony at the
same time pointing to Everard who pale as death, and with a
countenance expressing the most painful agitation, rushed to a table
on which stood a decanter of water, of which he hastily swallowed a
draught; though so violently did his hands shake that the goblet was
carried to his lips with difficulty.</p>

<p>'Forgive my leaving you so abruptly,' said he, in a faltering
voice; 'I will return in a few minutes;' and he hastily quitted the
apartment, followed by Mirza.</p>

<p>Now then his guilt a pat doubting! Mrs Milman spread out her
petticoats, fanned herself with an air of triumph, and began a sermon
upon the wonderful effects of conscience Surprise had checked the
course of Jessy's tears, the blood had deserted her lips and cheeks,
and she sat motionless looking like a marble statue The good old
Elmwood felt in his wound which his darling's heart had just
received, but he had nothing to offer for her relief, except a fond
pressure of her hand, and a sigh of compassion. The rest of the
company shrugged up their shoulders at the depravity of human nature,
and nodded their heads significantly at one another, as if they had
been so many Chinese josses. Suddenly the door opened; and Mrs Milman
was still in the full flow of her eloquence when Everard re-entered
the room, to all appearances perfectly recovered from his late
disorder.</p>

<p>'Mrs Milman,' said he, 'I am now master of the whole of this
business. Your ignorance of circumstances peculiar to the East, the
singularity of my adventures, and the broken English in which you
heard them related, have led you to a most extraordinary mistake. I
cannot clear it up, without subjecting myself to the most agonising
recollections, and rending open afresh those wounds, which, it's
true, are scarred over, but which are too deep and too deadly to be
ever thoroughly healed. If, therefore, the opinion of the world were
alone concerned, that opinion which is so little necessary to my own
happiness, I should leave you in your error, rather than subject
myself to the pain of an explanation. But I see in this circle two
persons, one of whom possesses too dear an interest in my affections
to permit my leaving a single thorn in her gentle bosom which I have
it in my power to remove; while the paternal kindness which the other
showed to me while I was still a boy, demands that I should convince
him that it was not shown to one unworthy. To calm their feelings, I
will sacrifice my own; and, much as I shall suffer while making the
recital, the recital of my adventures shall, still be made. Be
attentive then, and everything shall be explained.</p>

<p>Curiosity now became the predominant expression--Elmwood breathed
freer, held up his head higher than before, and shook his daughter's
hand affectionately; a roseate blush, stole over the lovely fair face
of Jessy, while a look of silent gratitude thanked her father; the
rest of the company drew their chairs closer together, and prepared
to listen with all their ears.</p>

<p>Everard seated himself, and thus began.</p>

<p>You are already aware that my fortune was made in the island of
Ceylon. It was there that I was so lucky as to find employment in the
house of a man whose virtues rendered him as much the object of
universal esteem, as the favours which he conferred upon me entitled
him to my peculiar gratitude. I was engaged by him as his secretary,
but all other names were soon forgotten by us both in that of
friends. He was an Englishman as well as myself, and perhaps this had
no slight influence in producing so strict an intimacy between us. A
variety of untoward circumstances had compelled him to abandon his
native land, and sail in pursuit of fortune to the East. His toil had
not been vain: the capricious goddess, who fled from him with such
disdain in Europe, now showered her favours upon his head with the
most unwearied profusion. He had consumed but a few years in Ceylon,
and was already rich and possessed of a distinguished situation It
seemed as if fortune was at length resolved to convince the world,
that she was not always blind; for had she searched the whole island
through, she would have found it difficult to bestow wealth and
honour upon a wiser or a better man But of all his treasures, that
which he counted most precious, that for which he thanked Heaven's
bounty at every moment of his existence, and with every pulsation of
his heart, was a wife, who united all the beauty and graces of her
sex with all the firmness and judgement of ours. One only blessing
was denied them: Louisa was not a mother.</p>

<p>My friend and patron (his name was Seafield) possessed a villa at
a small distance from Columbo. The place, it's true, was of no great
extent, but it united, in their fullest perfection, all those charms
which render Nature in that climate so irresistible an enchantress.
This was, Seafield's most beloved residence, and hither he hastened
whenever the duties of his station permitted his absenting himself
for a few days from Colombo: in particular, there was a small
circular pavilion designed by his own hand, and raised under his own
inspection to which he was particularly partial and in which he was
accustomed to pass the greatest portion of his time It stood some few
hundred yards from the dwelling house, and was situated on a small
eminence, whence the prospect over land and sea was of a description
rich, varied and extensive Around it towered a thick circle of palm
trees, resembling a colonnade: their leafy fans formed a second
cupola above the roof and while they prevented a single sun-beam from
piercing through the coolness of their embowering shades, their tall
and slender stems permitted not the eye to lose one of the
innumerable charms afforded by the surrounding landscape.</p>

<p>This delightful spot happened to be the residence of Seafield's
whole family, when accidental business of importance required
Louisa's presence at Columbo. Conscious that her husband considered
everyday as lost which he was compelled to pass at a distance from
his beloved retreat, she positively refused his attendance, but
accepting me as her escort she departed for the city. Diligence and
impatience to return home enabled her to dispatch her affairs in less
time than she had expected them to occupy; and in the very first
moment that she found herself once more at liberty, she ordered the
palanquins to be prepared, and her slaves to hold themselves in
readiness for departing. Our journey was performed by night, for the
double purpose of reaching home the sooner, and of escaping the
ardour of the noonday sun. We arrived an hour after daybreak, yet
Seafield was already abroad.</p>

<p>'As usual, he ascended the hill to enjoy the beauty of the
rising-sun.' Thus said Zadi, Seafield's old and attached domestic; in
whose favour his master made an exception to his general opinion,
that, in all their transactions with Europeans, the natives of this
island were totally devoid of gratitude, honesty, and good faith.</p>

<p>'We shall find him in the pavilion, then?'</p>

<p>'Not an hour ago I left him writing,' was the answer.</p>

<p>'We will go thither and surprise him,' she said, addressing
herself to me. 'Wait here while I change my dress; a few moments will
suffice for my toilet, and I shall expect to find you here when I
return.'</p>

<p>In the meantime, I remained leaning against one of the columns
which supported the small portico by which the door was sheltered.
From hence I enjoyed an uninterrupted view of the hill and its
pavilion, which, surrounded by its light and beautiful garland of
palm trees, attracted the sight irresistibly. While my eye dwelt with
satisfaction on their broad sheltering heads, I fancied that I could
discover a large excrescence upon the stem of one of them, extremely
unusual in those trees, which in general rear themselves
perpendicularly towards the sky, regular and straight as the pillars
of a colonnade. It resembled a large branch, extending from one stem
to its neighbour; and what puzzled me more in this appearance, was,
that it seemed occasionally to be waved backwards and forwards,
though the breathing of the sea-gale was so gentle that it scarcely
moved the leaves on the neighbouring branches. I made a variety of
guesses to account or this phenomenon, but every thing which my
memory or my imagination could. suggest, seemed inadequate to solve
this difficulty entirely to my satisfaction.</p>

<p>I was still puzzling myself with conjectures, when Zadi drew near
me with some slight refreshments. I pointed to the branch, whose
apparent motion had excited so much of my attention, and inquired,
whether he could at all account for the strong effect produced upon
it by the sea-breeze, while the lighter boughs were so gently
agitated. He immediately turned himself towards the palm trees; but
no sooner did his eye rest upon the spot in question, than the silver
basket with its contents dropped from his hands, the paleness of
death spread itself over his swarthy countenance; he caught at one of
the columns, to save himself from falling on the ground and, while
his eyes expressed the deepest horror and consternation, he
pronounced with difficulty--'! That is the Anaconda! We are
undone!'</p>

<p>What could have produced an effect so sudden and so violent upon a
man whom I well knew to inherit from nature the most determined
courage and most remarkable self-possession, was to me absolutely
incomprehensible. But though I was ignorant of its cause, the sight
of his extreme alarm was almost sufficient to shake my own presence
of mind. I saw that he was on the point of sinking on the earth,
overpowered by his emotions. I sprang towards him, and caught him in
my arms.</p>

<p>'For the love of heaven,' I exclaimed, compose yourself, old man!
Tell me what terrifies you thus. What mean you by the anaconda? What
can occasion these complaints, and this alarm?'</p>

<p>He endeavoured to recover himself; he strove to speak, but in
vain; and, before I could understand the accents of his stammering
tongue, Louisa joined us, and without observing the slave's agitation
put her arm within mine, and advanced towards the pavilion. This
action seemed to restore to Zadi the lost powers of his body and
mind. With a loud cry he threw himself on his knees before us, and in
words interrupted by sobs, and accompanied by tears, he forbade our
crossing the threshold.</p>

<p>'Your first step without these walls,' he exclaimed, 'leads to
inevitable destruction. Every door must be bolted; every window must
be barred. This mansion must resemble a sepulchre, where nothing
living is to be found.' And, while he spoke, he hastily closed and
locked the folding doors, through which we had a prospect of the
pavilion. Louisa observed his singular behaviour, and the agitation
of his countenance, with looks which expressed the most lively
astonishment.</p>

<p>'Are you distracted, Zadi?' she asked, after a few moments; 'what
mean these tears, and these expressions so alarming? And why do you
forbid our going to your master?'</p>

<p>'---You're going to---? Almighty God! My master! He is yonder! Oh!
he is lost! he lost beyond the power of saving!'</p>

<p>'He is lost, say you? Answer me, old man! What mean you? what fear
you? Oh!--how my heart beats with terror!'</p>

<p>Her frame trembled with anxiety, while she gazed with
wide-stretched eyes upon the messenger of evil tidings, and pressed
my hand with a convulsive grasp.</p>

<p>'Recollect yourself, my good Zadi!' said I; 'what is this
anaconda, which you speak of with such terror? I have seen nothing
except the branch of a palm tree, which the wind moved backwards and
forward, singularly enough, it's true, but still nothing in it
alarming.'</p>

<p>'Not alarming?' repeated the Indian, wringing his hands; 'not
alarming? The Lord have mercy on me, miserable old man! Ah! Mr
Everard, that branch of the palm tree! Alas! alas! It is no branch!
It is a snake! a terrible snake! We call it an anaconda and its kind
is in size the most enormous, in nature the most fierce, and in
appetite the most ravenous, of any to be found through all Ceylon!
See! see!' he continued, approaching one of the windows, 'see how the
monster plays among the branches! It always twines and twists itself
into those folds, and knots, and circles, when it prepares to dart
itself upon the ground, like lightning, to seize its prey! Oh! my
master! my poor dear master! He never can escape! Nothing can save
him!'</p>

<p>Half of this alarming explanation was more than enough to throw
the wretched Louisa into a state of distraction. Her features were so
distorted by terror, that she was scarcely to be known for the same
woman, her eyes stretched almost to breaking, and her hands folded
together with as strong a grasp as if she meant them never to be
again separated, she exclaimed, in a voice so hollow and so
expressive of suffocation that it pierced her hearers to the very
heart. 'My husband!--my beloved! Oh! help me to save him, good, good
men! Forsake him not! Oh! forsake him not!'</p>

<p>But at this moment the wife required assistance not less than the
husband. Overpowered by her sensations, she fainted in my arms; Zadi
flew to summon her female attendants; and I bore the pale insensible
Louisa back to her own apartment, though Zadi's dreadful narrative
had almost deprived me of animation myself.</p>

<p>Our endeavours to re-kindle the extinguished flame of life were at
length successful Her eyes opened she cast around her a look of
apprehension.</p>

<p>'Oh! why are you still here?' said she to me in a feeble voice 'Is
his life then of so little consequence? Fly to his succour! Rescue
him, or let me die! In preserving him, you will preserve me; if he
perishes, I am lost.'</p>

<p>'He lives! he lives! heaven be thanked!' thus shouted the faithful
Zadi, as he rushed into Louisa's apartment. His anxious vigilance had
induced him to examine every part of the mansion, and ascertain with
his own eyes that it was perfectly secure against danger. He now
returned out of breath from the balcony, whence he had discovered to
his great satisfaction, that his view was unimpeded over the whole
pavilion. He remarked, that the door and all the windows (as far as
the power of vision extended) were closely fastened; and hence he
very reasonably concluded, that his master had been aware of the
enemy's approach in full time to take every precaution for his
safety.</p>

<p>'Hear you that, my dear lady?' I exclaimed, while I took Louisa's
hand; 'surely, this intelligence is a one sufficient to restore your
strength and tranquility. We had nothing apprehend for Seafield,
except his being surprised by the monster while unprepared. But you
see that he has had time to shut out the danger: he has now nothing
to do but to remain quietly within his retreat, and the snake will
either not discover his being so near, or at any rate will be able to
break through the bulwarks which separate them. The whole business
therefore is a disagreeable blockade for an hour, or perhaps less; at
the end of which the anaconda will grow weary of waiting for its
prey, and be retiring to seek it in some other quarter, will release
our friend, and then we shall be quit for the fright.'</p>

<p>The satisfaction with which I thus endeavoured to reassure the
agonized heart of Louisa, was thoroughly established in my own. But
Zadi, whose own feelings were too much agitated by his master's
situation to permit his attending to those of others, hastened with
too little consideration to destroy the hope, which I so fondly
indulged, and with which I strove to soothe the afflicted wife. 'Oh!
no, no, no!' he exclaimed; 'we must not reckon upon the snake leaving
us so soon! When the anaconda has once chosen a group of trees for
her abode, and is seen to sport among their branches in the manner in
which we saw her amusing herself, she will remain there for whole
days and weeks watching patiently for her prey, till every chance of
success fails her, and absolute famine compels her to emigrate; but
her capacity of existing without food is almost inconceivable, and
till she removes of her own free will, no human power is able to
drive her from her retreat.'</p>

<p>'Almighty Powers!' stammered out the trembling Louisa, 'then he is
lost indeed! Even should those slight barriers be sufficient to
protect him from the monster's fury, he must still at last fall a
prey to the assaults of hunger!'</p>

<p>My frowning looks easily made the old man aware of the imprudence
which he had just committed; but the mischief was irreparable. Every
thing, which his imagination could suggest to soften the effect
produced by his ill-judged confession, was unable to blunt the arrow,
which had carried with it into the heart of his mistress the poison
of despair.</p>

<p>'But after all; said I, 'why are we to take it for granted that
our friend is actually exposed to this urgent danger? By your own
account, Zadi, above an hour had elapsed between your leaving your
master in the pavilion, and your discovery of the Anaconda; and what
then can be more likely than the day being so delightful, he should
have gone out to walk, and have quitted the pavilion before the
snake's approach?'</p>

<p>'Angel of comfort!' exclaimed Louisa, while she seized my hand,
and pressed it to her lips; 'blessed, ever blessed be you for that
suggestion! Why should it not be, as you suppose? Why should not his
absence have rescued him?'</p>

<p>'Ah! dear heaven!' sighed the old man, and shook his head, 'the
doors closed, the windows all fastened---'</p>

<p>'Prove nothing,' I interrupted him; 'when did Seafield ever leave
his favourite retreat without taking those precautions? Perhaps; at
this very moment that we are trembling for his safety, he is at the
distance of miles from the place of danger! Perhaps, nothing more is
requisite for his full security than that we should take the
precaution of warning him in time, lest he should return to the
dangerous pavilion instead of coming straight to the house. Come,
come, Zadi; let us hasten to find him! Summon together all the male
domestics, as well as our palanquin-bearers; let us divide them into
small parties and send them into every path, by which it is possible
for Seafield to regain the hill.'</p>

<p>'Yes, hasten! hasten! cried Louisa; 'the thought that you may come
too late, pierces me to the very soul; yet on his having already
quitted the pavilion hangs my whole, my only hope! Hasten, friends!
oh! hasten to find him!'</p>

<p>Her eagerness would not suffer us to remain a moment. We consigned
her to the care of her female attendants. We then collected the male
inhabitants of the house together with all speed, and having armed
them in the best manner that time would permit, we approached in
different quarters as near the fatal hill, as the protecting shelter
of the trees and branches would allow us, without running the risk of
being discovered by the anaconda. Zadi remained with me.</p>

<p>On our way, I endeavoured to compose my thoughts, and to make
myself master of every particular respecting the danger, to which the
friend of my heart was exposed. My own alarm, and Louisa's presence,
had hitherto prevented my obtaining a thorough knowledge of the
nature of Seafield's situation, and what he had to apprehend: but,
now that I was alone with him, I lost no time before I questioned
Zadi.</p>

<p>'You see, old man,' said I, 'how your fatal outcry, "an anaconda,"
has palsied every soul through excess of terror. Now your imprudence
will have been most unpardonable, should it turn out that you spoke
without being quite certain of the fact, or if you should be found
through your own natural timidity to have exaggerated the danger.
Recollect yourself, therefore, and then answer me calmly and
frankly.. Are you positive, that what you saw was really an anaconda;
and in the dreadful account which you have just given of her, have
you not in some degree overstepped the limits of, truth?'</p>

<p>'Sir,' answered the good old man, 'though it were the last word
which I have to utter in this world, I should still repeat my former
assertions. Why, the very name of this creature is enough to make
every native of this island feel the blood freeze in his veins! and
that I have not deceived myself, is, alas! but too certain. I have
already seen the anaconda twice at no greater distance than now;
though never one of such a monstrous length and thickness as that
which is at present before us. This country would speedily become a
wilderness, if fortunately these reptiles were not very rarely met
with; for in general they remain concealed within the recesses of the
deepest woods; there clinging round the branches of some gigantic
tree, they remain waiting with inexhaustible patience for an
opportunity of darting down upon their prey, the first man or animal
who is unlucky enough to pass beneath them. How it happens, that this
snake should have advanced so far into the open country, is what I
can least comprehend: but as the rainy season is but just over, it is
most probable, that she has been swept away by the irresistible
violence of some of the mountain-torrents.'</p>

<p>During this conversation we had continued to advance under favour
of the thick-woven underwood, till we were scarcely more than a
hundred paces distant from the monster. We could now examine it with
the most perfect distinctness, and the eye was able to take in at
once the whole extent of its gigantic structure. It was a sight
calculated to excite in equal degrees our horror and our admiration:
it united the most singular and brilliant beauty with everything that
could impress the beholder with apprehension; and, though while
gazing upon it I felt that every limb shuddered involuntarily, I was
still compelled to own, that never had I witnessed an exhibition more
fascinating or more gratifying to the eye.</p>

<p>The anaconda was still employed in twisting itself in a thousand
coils among the palm-branches with such restless activity, with
rapidity so inconceivable, that it was frequently impossible for the
sight to follow her movements. At one moment, she fastened herself by
the end of her tail to the very summit of the loftiest tree, and,
stretched out at her whole length, swung back-wards and forwards like
the pendulum of a clock, so' that her head almost seemed to graze the
earth beneath her; then in another, before the eye was aware of her
intention, she totally disappeared among the leafy canopies. Now she
slid down the stem, winding herself round and round it; and now again
only the extremity of her tail remained twisted round the root, while
she stretched out her body upon the grass, and with elevated head and
high-reaching neck described a large or a small circle, as her
capricious pleasure prompted.</p>

<p>These latter movements gave us an opportunity to discriminate with
more exactness (during a few seconds at a time) the singular richness
and beauty of her tints. The long slender body was covered with a
network of glittering scales, girdling it round with rings above
rings, and effectually securing it against every attack. The head was
of a yellowish green, and marked in the middle of the skull with a
large dark spot, from whence small stripes of pale yellow were drawn
down to the jaws. A broad circle of the same colour went round the
throat like a necklace, on either side of which were two
olive-coloured patches, in shape resembling shields. Along the back
ran a chain of black waves with sharp-pointed edges, from whence on
both sides narrow flesh-coloured rings and broad bands of the
brightest yellow (alternately and in the most regular order)
descended in zigzag fashion towards the silver-white stomach, where
they lost themselves imperceptibly: but what served more than all to
dazzle the eye with the brilliance of variegated colouring, were
innumerable spots of a rich and vivid reddish-purple, sprinkled
without order over the whole surface of the upper skin; for with the
animal's slightest movement all these points, and spots, and
contrasts of variegated hues, melted together in the sunbeams, and
formed one universal blaze composed of all the colours of the
rainbow. Much as I admired the splendour of its garment, not less did
I wonder at the enormous thickness of this terrific creature, which
did not yield in bulk to that of a man of moderate size. Yet by
comparing its thickness with its length, Zadi was decidedly of
opinion, that the anaconda must have been greatly reduced by a fast
of unusually long duration. But the tranquillity of our observations
was suddenly disturbed by perceiving, that she desisted abruptly from
her airy gambols, and remained motionless at the foot of the
palm-tree with her head elevated and turned towards the pavilion, as
if in the act of listening!</p>

<p>At that moment, oh! God! with what violence did my heart beat
against my bosom! If (as from every circumstance appeared but too
probable) my friend was really shut up within the pavilion, it was
beyond a doubt, that the monster had discovered his being so near
her, and was now on the point of making a serious attack! We could
see distinctly the shape of her hideous head and the flames of her
great piercing eyeballs, reflected from the glass windows, whose
shutters had been closed from within. But the sight of her own
terrors seemed to scare even the snake herself, for she instantly
recoiled; and then laying herself down close to the threshold of the
circular pavilion, she encompassed it entirely, as if she was
determined to secure her destined victim irrevocably, by enclosing
him within the impassable limits of her magic ring. Deeply penetrated
with the sense of that danger by which my friend was menaced I forgot
my own and seizing my gun placed it to my shoulder the ball whistled
through the air. I was an excellent marksman and was certain that I
had pointed my piece exactly at the monster's head and yet, whether
too great anxiety made my hand shake or that the animal at that very
moment made some slight change in her attitude, I know not, but it is
at least certain, that not the slightest shrinking gave me reason to
believe, that she felt herself at all injured. In themeanwhile, Zadi
had seized my arm, and drawn me forcibly deeper part of the
thicket.</p>

<p>'Ah! Mr Everard!' sighed he; 'I was well aware, that the anaconda
can set all our firearms at defiance. Her scaly hide renders her
invulnerable, except when one is quite dose to her, and all that you
have done is to put your own safety in danger, without advancing a
single step nearer to my master's relief.'</p>

<p>However it did not appear that our enemy had paid much attention
to my assault upon her. On the contrary, she only busied herself in
renewing her attempts to gain an entrance through the pavilion's
windows: till at length, seemingly wearied with her unavailing
efforts, she retired slowly, and concealed herself under the verdant
umbrella of the palm trees. We also had discovered her former lurking
place; though we were now more irresolute than ever, as to the means
most proper to be adopted towards the rescue of my friend.</p>

<p>While we stood thus with our eyes fixed immovably upon the
pavilion we observed the door to be slightly agitated. After a
minute, the lock was gently drawn back slowly and with the utmost
caution did the door expand about the breadth of half a foot, and out
sprang the little Psyche, a beautiful Italian greyhound, Seafield's
favourite play fellow and inseparable companion. As if conscious of
her danger she rushed down the hill with her utmost swiftness; but
with still greater swiftness did the anaconda in one monstrous spring
dart rattling down from its airy covert. The poor little animal was
seized: we could just hear a short half-suppressed cry, which marked
its dying agony; for the dreadful jawbone moved but twice, or thrice,
and lo! the dog's chine was broken, and every bone in its body
splintered. The snake then dragged her prey to the foot of the
palm-tree, (for in order to produce the proper exertion of strength,
it seemed necessary for her to have the stem or strong branch of some
tree to cling to), where she stretched herself out upon the grass at
her ease, and began with her black tongue to separate the flesh from
the bones of the crushed little animal.</p>

<p>The distress, occasioned in my mind by this sight, in itself so
painful and disgusting, was converted into agony by the reflections
to which it gave birth, after the first moments of horror and
surprise were passed! That fact was now confirmed, which till this
moment (in order to preserve at least a gleam of comfort however
faint) I had obstinately refused to believe. Seafield then was
actually in the pavilion The discharge of my musket had in all
probability made him aware, that his friends were at no great
distance. No one but he could have unclosed the door so cautiously,
in order to leave his little favourite at liberty to quit their
common shelter; and Zadi was positive, that he had observed a riband
fastened round the neck of the animal, to which something white
appeared to be attached, in form resembling a letter. It was then a
message to US! a cry for assistance! a sacred injunction, that we
should not abandon him in this season of his utmost need! What agony
of soul must he have endured. What agony of soul must he even at that
moment be enduring! To what a pitch of desperation must his mind have
been worked up, before his trembling hand could have resolved to draw
back the bolt, which was the only barrier between himself and
annihilation! How bitter a pang must it have given his tender
benevolent heart, when he drove out his fond and faithful companion,
and exposed her to such danger! and then flattering himself (as no
doubt he did) that the little animal's speed would surely enable her
to escape. Oh! what a cruel wound must Psyche's expiring half-heard
cry have given to his. feelings! These reflections, or at least
others nearly similar to them, almost deprived poor Zadi of his
senses altogether.</p>

<p>'Oh! powers of mercy!' he exclaimed repeatedly; 'what did his
letter mean to tell us? That at this moment he is struggling with
despair? Alas! alas! we know it, we feel it! and yet here we stand
inactive, without counsel, without resolution, without hope!'</p>

<p>'Patience! patience!' said I, interrupting him: 'it is evident,
that our waiting here is of no advantage. Let us return home, and
endeavour to find means of giving some more effectual assistance than
our tears.'</p>

<p>We found the domestics returned from their unavailing expedition,
and the greatest part of them assembled in the courtyard, whose lofty
walls afforded them a secure refuge: being all natives of Ceylon,
they were well acquainted with the nature and pursuits of the
anaconda, either from their own experience, or from hearsay: but,
almost deprived of the power of thought by their terrors, no one was
able to point out any means for attacking her with success. I
immediately despatched two of them to Columbo, to explain our
situation, and demand assistance. I also desired, that medical aid
might be sent to Louisa, and that if they could possibly find one,
they should bring back with them a speaking trumpet. I then repaired
to poor Louisa, and endeavoured to comfort her heart with a faint
gleam of hope, which my own was incapable of admitting. I failed in
the attempt; she was a prey to the most abject despair: nor was I
more successful in my endeavours to persuade her to withdraw from
this scene of horror, and accompany my messengers to Columbo; a
measure which was advisable both on account of her own security, and
because her absence would leave us at liberty to bestow our undivided
attention upon her husband. But finding her resolved not to remove
from the scene of Seafield's danger, I returned to the courtyard,
where the dejected domestics were still lamenting over the situation
of their master, and expatiating on the dreadful properties of the
anaconda.</p>

<p>'Friends!' I exclaimed, 'there is not one among us all to whom the
master of this house has not been a benefactor! Now that he is
threatened with destruction, now is the time for us to show our
gratitude for his kindness! Come then; let every one follow me, who
loves his lord, and who bears an honest heart in his bosom. Let us
despise the danger of the attack and set forward in a full body to
deliver him by force! We are armed; in numbers, in reflection, in
skill, the advantage is on our side. The bolder that we rush upon our
enemy, the less dreadful will she appear to us. My life for it, she
will be alarmed at the attack, will fly before us, and thus we shall
enjoy the inestimable pleasure of rescuing our friend from death. Now
then! let all who are of my opinion show themselves to be men, and
range themselves on this side of the court.'</p>

<p>Alas! Zadi was the only one who obeyed this invitation: the rest,
poor timid wretches (in number between twenty and thirty), stood
there trembling, gazing upon each other with doubtful looks, and
whispering together, as if desirous of discovering an excuse for the
cowardice of each in the ignominy of his neighbour. After a few
minutes, one of them, whom the rest had appointed to be spokesman,
advanced towards me, and stammered out their general assurance: that
to attack the famished snake with force would be nothing better than
absolute madness.</p>

<p>This hope disappointed, I next resolved to try, what effect of
terror might be produced upon the monster by the united shouts and
outcries of so considerable a body, assisted by the general and
repeated discharge of our fire-arms. Our preparations were soon made;
Louisa was apprised of the clamour which was going to be made: and,
in truth, we raised an uproar so loud and so well sustained, that it
seemed almost capable of waking the sleepers in the grave. Prom all
the casements we discharged at the same moment our muskets provided
with a double charge, and a hail of bullets rattled about the head of
the gigantic snake, who afforded us a fair aim. Yet still she
continued to play her gambols quietly among the trees; nay, she did
not give any sign by which we could judge, that she was sensible of
our attack. After a few moments spent in this manner with no better
effect, we found that our provision of ammunition was exhausted:
besides, we were ourselves too much fatigued to continue any longer
an attempt, which afforded us so little prospect of producing any
advantage.</p>

<p>By this time the day was drawing rapidly to its close. By dint of
turning the painful subject frequently in my mind, and making every
possible conjecture, one means of scaring the anaconda had suggested
itself, which appeared to me well worthy of attention; but in order
to put it in execution the darkness of the night was necessary. I had
often read in books of travels, what powerful aid had been derived
from fire against the attacks of wild beasts, and how lions and
tigers had often forgotten their thirst of blood, and betaken
themselves to flight, like the most timid animals, when scared by a
fire-brand whirled round, or the blaze of a flaming heap of straw.
Armed with such weapons, I was determined, as soon as night should be
set in, to approach the anaconda, and put her courage to the proof,
even though the faithful Zadi should be the only one of sufficient
courage to assist me in my venturous design.</p>

<p>The night arrived: an awful stillness reigned all around us; our
enemy, however, still was watchful; for from time to time we could
hear her rustling among the branches. I passed the twilight in
endeavouring to comfort Louisa with the prospect of a serious attack
to be made upon the snake the next day, from which (as I assured her)
much better success might be expected; but I judged it prudent to
conceal from her our nightly enterprise, the effect of which appeared
even to myself too uncertain to make me venture to ground upon it any
promise of advantage. Besides, her exhausted strength made it
absolutely necessary, that she should pass some moments in
tranquillity; a state, which seemed to me absolutely incompatible
with the tumults of expectation, which the knowledge of our proposed
adventure would naturally excite in her bosom.</p>

<p>At length a sign given by Zadi made me aware, that all our
preparations were completed. Louisa was reclining on a couch with her
eyes closed, and seemed to have fallen into a kind of lethargy. I
stole softly from the apartment, and was on the point of quitting the
house, when a means suggested itself to me of communicating my design
to my friend, even before the arrival of the speaking trumpet, which
I expected the next day from Columbo. I recollected, that I had
lately taught Seafield a common European trick of combination, by
which two persons, separated from each other (having first agreed
upon their measures) could convey their sentiments without the help
of words: a certain number of blows, corresponding with the number of
the place which each letter of the four and twenty holds in the
alphabet, enabled the striker to form words and sentences, by which
the hearer without other communication was made aware of the steps,
which without his knowledge it had been settled for him to take. This
trifle had but lately served us to puzzle Louisa, and pass away an
idle evening hour; and I flattered myself with the possibility, that
it might still exist in Seafield's remembrance. At any rate, I
resolved to make the trial without loss of time, and the stillness of
the night seemed to afford me the most favourable opportunity for
executing my plan with success.</p>

<p>A thin smooth board, well calculated for reverberating sounds, and
a strong hammer were easily procured. With these I hastened to the
balcony, and began by striking as many blows as the alphabet
required, (that is, one to A, two to B, twenty-four to Z, &amp;c.)
till I had gone through it regularly. I trusted that this orderly
manner of proceeding would awaken his attention; and having completed
the alphabet, I told him (in the same manner) if he comprehended my
meaning, to strike three blows within the pavilion, as loud as he
possibly could. Oh! heavenly powers! I had not long to wait! it was
not long before three faint sounds informed me, that I was
understood, and never did music seem so sweet to my ear! I hurried to
tell Louisa, that I had found a means of communicating with her
husband, and that I was going to command him to be of good cheer in
her name and for her sake. A silent melancholy smile, a convulsive
pressure of my hand, were my reward; and I now hastened again to the
balcony to assure the poor prisoner, that I was labouring for his
relief; that Louisa was well, and begged him to be patient and
composed; and that I requested him to keep up his spirits, and resist
the attacks of despair, since he might depend upon it, that I would
rescue him, or perish in the attempt. I concluded by desiring him to
assure me, that he would confide in the activity of my friendship, by
repeating his former signal: I now suffered my hammer to rest--I
listened--again, more audibly than before, did I hear the three
wished-for blows given from within the pavilion, and I now hastened
to prosecute my nightly plan with fresh spirits and renovated
ardour.</p>

<p>Excited by Zadi's remonstrances, about a dozen of the bravest
among the domestics and palanquin-bearers were assembled with torches
in their hands in the courtyard. My design was, to steal as near the
hill as the underwood would permit, under favour of the darkness, and
only guided by a single dark lanthorn. When we could approach no
further without hazard, we were to light our torches as fast as
possible, and whirling them round and round, to rush towards the
pavilion with loud shouts, in order that our attack might be
accompanied by all the terrors and advantage of surprise.</p>

<p>Zadi, to whose care the guiding lanthorn was confided, went
foremost; I followed close upon his footsteps, and thus with extreme
caution and in profound silence did we press through bushes and
brambles, till we arrived above half as near again to the pavilion,
as the position which we had occupied during the day. The anaconda
now lay right before us, quiet and unsuspecting; nor could we have
wished for a better opportunity for executing our plan with every
probability of success. We now turned to our companions.--But, just
Heaven! who can express our astonishment and vexation, and how did
our heart sicken at perceiving, that the faithless cowards had shrunk
from the danger now that it was so near at hand, and had profited by
the darkness to steal away one by one! I was alone with Zadi: we
concluded with justice, that for only two persons to make the attempt
must be unavailing, and the old man flattered himself, that he should
be able to shame his comrades into a resumption of their more manly
resolutions. I had but little hopes of his success; yet no choice was
left me but to follow him and endeavour to give double strength to
his persuasions and reproaches.</p>

<p>Both were employed in vain: their terrors had subdued all sense of
shame completely. They called us madmen for wishing to expose
ourselves to the fury of the famished anaconda; and, instead of
promising any future assistance, they declared, that they would only
wait for daybreak to secure themselves by flight from a danger so
imminent. In the meanwhile Zadi was busy in fastening several torches
together in pairs.</p>

<p>'Come, sir!' he cried to me: 'let us lose no more precious time in
endeavouring to inspire these heartless knaves with courage! Let us
leave the cowards, and try whether perhaps the glare of these
torches, doubled as you see them, may not of themselves be sufficient
to dazzle and scare away the monster. At the worst we can but perish
with our dear master, and it is better to die than not perform our
duty!'</p>

<p>I obeyed him: we hastened back to the pavilion. Already were we on
the point of ascending the hill, when I felt my arm seized by someone
with a convulsive grasp. I turned hastily round: a thin figure,
breathless through speed and anxiety, and whose white garments
fluttered in the breeze of night, stood beside me. It was Louisa! Our
dispute with the slaves had not passed so quietly, but that our
voices had reached the ear of Seafield's sorrowing wife, whose sore
anguish of heart permitted not slumber to approach. She questioned
her attendants; by artful interrogatories she contrived to draw from
them the peculiar nature of the enterprise on which we were engaged.
She feigned to sleep: and, as soon as her women were thrown off their
guard, she stole from her apartment, seized a torch, and followed us,
determined to share with us the danger and its reward.</p>

<p>My whole resolution failed me, when I recognized the new-comer,
and when she made known in a few short expressive words her desperate
resolution. In a low voice I conjured her to return to the
mansion-house; I protested, that her presence robbed our arms of
strength and our hearts of courage; and I asked her, whether it was
not enough agony for us to tremble for an existence so dear as
Seafield's, without being obliged to risk the loss of another life
equally precious?</p>

<p>'My life for his!' was the only reply which she gave to my
remonstrances; 'my life for his!--What shall I rest my hands idly
before me, while strangers are active in his defence? Shall I have to
blame myself during the remnant of my existence for having done
nothing for him in the time of his extreme need--Nothing? Shall my
husband actually be rescued by his friends, while his careless wife
has not even attempted to preserve him?--No, Everard, no! my life for
his! my life for his!'</p>

<p>I listened with admiration to the overflowings of this noble
heart! How to resist her vehemence I knew not! I was compelled to
give way to her, and yet was conscious that her presence must
entirely destroy every chance of our success. It would have been
madness to venture in her company to that extreme point of danger, to
which Zadi and myself had before not scrupled to advance. The
anaconda too appeared at this moment to be more restless than
formerly: doubtless the sound of our footsteps, and our whispering
dispute, must already have betrayed our being in the neighbourhood.
Nevertheless, we hastily kindled our fire-brands, one of which we
held in each hand, and as we whirled them rapidly backwards and
forwards we went forth shouts and shrieks with all our strength; the
dead stillness of all around us rendered our outcries doubly
dreadful.</p>

<p>A rushing sound among the tops of the palm-trees, as if branch by
branch they were forcibly snapped asunder, was the answer given to
our challenge. It was the anaconda (whether excited by fear or by
anger, I will not pretend to decide) who darted herself from tree to
tree with tremendous leaps, while the slender stems were bent and
shaken by her burthen. At the same time we were alarmed by a loud
hissing, so piercingly sharp, that it seemed close at our ears, and
her eyes, blazing with their own vindictive fires, shot lightnings
through the gloom of night.</p>

<p>In truth, this appearance was in every respect so dreadful, that
it required no ordinary courage to witness it without agitation. I
cannot deny, that while gazing on it I felt my hair stand on end and
my blood run cold; and I observed that Zadi strove to keep his teeth
closed together, in order to prevent me from hearing them chatter. I
turned with apprehension to Louisa. Alas! there lay the wretched wife
on the earth deprived of consciousness. This sight was sufficient to
banish every other consideration. I threw away my torches hastily,
clasped the unfortunate in my arms and with Zadi's help bore her with
all speed back to the mansion-house; prosperous in this alone, we
then retired unpursued by the anaconda. Here, after a long interval
of insensibility, we at length succeeded in recalling Louisa's flying
spirits. She revived; but it was only to dwell upon the midnight
scene, from which we were just returned, and which her inflamed
imagination painted in colours, if possible, still more dreadful that
the reality. She called without ceasing upon her husband and upon me:
and since it was out of my power to give more active assistance
elsewhere, it would have been barbarous in me to leave her, without
endeavouring by soothing and persuasion to dissipate the gloomy ideas
by which her heated brain was distracted.</p>

<p>Thus passed away the remainder of the night, which left us even
with less hope and resolution than we possessed when it arrived. The
melancholy morning at length dawned; but the sun was scarcely risen
when Zadi rushed into the apartment. His eyes sparkled, and the
beating of his heart almost choked his words before he was able to
give them utterance.</p>

<p>'Oh! Mr Everard!' he exclaimed, 'my master--my dear master! He has
still hope! He has still courage! He endeavours to communicate with
us! We shall soon know how matters go with him--. what he wishes to
be done--what he expects us to do. Yes! yes! we will soon know
it!'</p>

<p>It was some time before he was sufficiently calm to explain to me
the cause of this emotion. At length I learned, that in examining the
pavilion he had just discovered a sheet of paper thrust through the
crevice of the door, and which, apparently detained by one of its
corners, fluttered loosely in the air, unable to effect its escape.
Doubtless it was a letter, which Seafield hoped some favourable gust
of wind would carry within our reach, but which he had not
sufficiently disengaged from its narrow passage. As to reading the
contents, even if the distance had permitted it, Zadi was not
possessed of the knowledge requisite. He therefore had hastened in
all diligence to communicate to me this discovery, from which I also
derived some hope, though fainter than that which filled the bosom of
the faithful Zadi.</p>

<p>We hurried to the hill, approached still nearer than we had
ventured to do hitherto, and, with the assistance of an excellent
telescope, I endeavoured to decipher the characters traced upon the
important paper. Alas! that there actually were characters traced on
it, was all that I could distinguish; for the light paper fluttered
continually in the wind, and was never suffered to rest for two
seconds together. My inexhaustible patience, my unwearied exertions,
long struggled against the evident impossibility of success: I gained
nothing by them except the conviction, that to prosecute the attempt
further would only be to throw away a greater portion of my time.
Zadi, in breathless silence, and his eyes fixed on my face
unalterably, watched my every movement.</p>

<p>'Then you give up the point?' said he at length, while a livid
paleness overspread his dark countenance, and such a trembling seized
him, that I could see his every limb shaking; 'well, then, there is
no more to be said! Let us return to the house, and take courage: I
will fetch you the paper.'</p>

<p>'Old man!' I exclaimed, startling at this unexpected assurance,
'What say you? Your good intention is worthy of your good heart; but
you would make an unavailing sacrifice to your fidelity; you may
bring destruction on yourself, but you never will bring the paper
from thence. To do that is out of any mortal power!'</p>

<p>'May be so! may be so!' repeated the Indian; 'but at least the
trial shall be made. It seems, as if my master's voice cried to me,
that, his safety depended on that paper; and should I be worthy to
belong to him, if I were deaf to my master's cry? By the God of my
fathers, I will either come back to you with that paper, or never
will come back again.'</p>

<p>And with every word that he spoke, his tone became stronger, his
step firmer, and the fire of resolution illuminated his large dark
eyes.</p>

<p>During this contention we reached the courtyard; in silence, and
absorbed in himself, did this unequalled servant make the necessary
preparations for his undertaking. His plan was to conceal his whole
person, from head to foot, under a covering of boughs and
cocoa-leaves, resembling as much as possible the broken branches with
which the snake's gambols or indignation had strewn the hill all
around her. Under this verdant shield, he flattered himself that he
should be able to creep gradually to the pavilion door, unperceived
by the anaconda.</p>

<p>'I have been accustomed,' said he, 'to this kind of work from my
earliest infancy. In my time I was reckoned an expert
elephant-hunter, and by means of this artifice have frequently made
those enormous animals my prize.'</p>

<p>But a few minutes were past, and already was Zadi accoutred in
this singular disguise. He provided himself with no weapons except
his dagger. He obstinately refused to suffer me to accompany him,
assuring me that I should only put my own life in danger, without
being able to afford him the least assistance. He was so positive,
that I was obliged to give up the point: but I was at least
determined to accompany the noble-minded fellow with my eyes, as well
as with my fervent prayers and wishes. From the balcony of the
mansion-house I had an extensive and unimpeded view over the
surrounding objects; and from hence I saw Zadi set forward on his
perilous adventure, taking through precaution a wide circuit, in
order to reach the hill itself.</p>

<p>With equal prudence he made his approach on that side, where the
pavilion would screen him from the enemy's observation. From time to
time I lost sight of him among the underwood; even when he was before
my eyes I occasionally doubted whether it was he indeed, so
cautiously and so artfully did he make his approach, creeping on his
hands and knees, sometimes remaining without stirring, sometimes
stealing forwards with a movement so imperceptible, that it almost
eluded the keenness of sight. He was a living example to me of the
discretion, assiduity, and skill, which the savage employs in laying
his ambuscades, and stealing upon his unsuspecting enemy.</p>

<p>And now favoured by the long grass and fragments of boughs, with
which the ground was covered, had Zadi by a thousand serpentine
movements reached the wall of the pavilion. My heart beat violently,
as I saw on one side the anaconda, as yet, it is true, suspecting
nothing, but still dreadful from her appearance, and exhibiting every
moment awful proofs of her strength, by the powerful leaps with which
she darted herself from bough to bough; and, on the other hand,
separated from her by the distance of ten yards at most, I beheld a
poor, infirm, and aged man, whose force consisted only in his courage
and his discretion.</p>

<p>Zadi in the mean while remained so tranquil and so motionless in
his present position near the pavilion-door, that the monster could
not fail of being deceived by so unsuspicious an appearance. The
Indian's eye was fixed immovably upon the snake, and followed all her
twistings and windings with incessant application, while she swung
herself with unwearied activity backwards and forwards, now here, now
there, now above, now below; till, at the very moment when she shot
herself over him in a bound of prodigious extent, I suddenly saw the
invaluable paper disappear from its place, without being able to
perceive the means by which it was brought into the power of the
successful lurker.</p>

<p>I clasped my hands in ecstasy, and poured out my thanks to God
from the very bottom of my heart. But all was not yet done. It
required no less caution and dexterity to retire than to proach; and
never did I offer up more fervent vows than at the moment when the
animated thicket began to set itself in motion. Slower than the
hour-hand of a dial, now moving forwards, now backwards, now right,
now left, it stole itself down the hill. Still it went on, and on,
and lower, and lower, till, with inexpressible delight, I saw it
almost at the very foot of the hill; and now at length I began to
draw my breath without pain. 'The noble fellow is safe,' said I to
myself. At that moment, whether joy at the successful issue of his
attempt had deprived him of part of his former caution, or whether
some accidental derangement of the sheltering branches discovered
enough to excite the reptile's suspicion, at that moment I saw the
anaconda dart from above, and in the quickness of thought she reached
the bottom of the hill, and enveloped the unfortunate in her folds! A
piercing shriek of horror burst from me! I felt all my blood conceal
itself within my veins!</p>

<p>Yet even in this dreadful situation wonderful was the presence of
mind which Zadi still preserved; wonderful was the courage, the
activity, and the skill, with which he defended himself against the
monster. Grasping his dagger with firm and steady hand, he struck it
with repeated blows between the impenetrable scales of his enemy,
sought out with inconceivable address the most tender parts to
strike, and at length succeeded in giving her so deep and so
well-placed a wound, that it must needs have worked her up to the
most extreme pitch of pain and fury; for suddenly I beheld him only
girdled by a single fold of the anaconda's tail, with which (in the
same manner that one who has unexpectedly grasped a nettle, throws it
away) she hurled the poor wretch into the air far away, till I lost
him among the surrounding bushes. As for the snake, she hastily
regained her former hiding-place, where she lay quiet and concealed
for some time before she resumed her usual sports; though when she
did resume them, it was evidently with less sprightliness than
before.</p>

<p>My agony is not to be described! Nothing was to be seen of the
unfortunate Indian. What was become of him? Had he been killed by the
violence of the fall? Or was he at that moment struggling in the
pangs of death? His preservation I considered as beyond the limits of
possibility; and yet it seemed to me inhuman and ungrateful quite to
abandon him to his fate, without having first exhausted every
possible means of assisting him. Irresistibly carried away by these
sentiments, I rushed from the balcony, and hastened towards the hill
by the same course which he had pursued himself, and which I could
easily track by the depression of the dewy grass. Towards that side,
also, had he been thrown by the anaconda, and it was probable that
the thicket might shelter me, till I could reach the spot where he
lay dying. In the eagerness of this hope, I totally overlooked the
extreme risk of an undertaking, the very idea of which but
four-and-twenty hours sooner would have made me shudder through every
limb. So true is it, that violent emotions communicate a force to the
mind, which enables it to rise above itself, and gives it courage to
encounter danger and even death without the shrinking of a single
nerve.</p>

<p>Suddenly my attention was arrested by a faint murmur! It came from
a thicket at no great distance: I listened again! Oh heavens! it was
the voice of Zadi. I lost not a moment in hastening to the place; he
heard me; he opened his eyelids, which seemed already closed in
eternal sleep, recognized me as I raised him in my arms, and a faint
smile stole over his countenance, as he stretched out his hand to me
with difficulty.</p>

<p>'Take it,' he said; 'God be thanked, that I am able to reward your
kindness so well;--even in the monster's grasp, I still kept fast
hold of it: Oh, take it, take it!'</p>

<p>It was the paper which he had purchased so dearly, and which the
faithful creature extended towards me.</p>

<p>'Read it!' he continued; 'lose no time! before I am deprived of my
senses again--and for ever--at least let me have the satisfaction to
know--what my master wished me to do! alas! alas! now you will be
left alone to assist him!'</p>

<p>'And assist him I will, doubt it not, thou noble heart,' I
replied, while I strove to raise him from the ground; 'but my first
assistance must be given to yourself.'</p>

<p>It was in vain that he conjured me to leave him to his fate, and
only think of effecting his master's rescue. Without heeding him I
managed to lift him upon my shoulders, and tottering beneath his
weight I endeavoured to effect our escape from the dangerous vicinity
of the pavilion. With difficulty I succeeded in regaining the open
ground. Fortunately some of the other domestics saw us from the
house, and hastened to relieve me from my wretched burthen. Assisted
by them, I at length saw Zadi safely deposited on a sofa in the
mansion-house; he was again on the point of losing all sensibility;
but, a cordial of powerful virtue being administered without delay,
his strength was restored sufficiently to preserve him from a
relapse.</p>

<p>It's true, none of his limbs were fractured, but he was dreadfully
bruised by his fall; his breast and ribs had been almost crushed
together by the close-drawn folds of the serpent; he was totally
unable to move so much as a finger, and his condition was such as
would have excited pity even in the most insensible nature. As for
me, I almost sunk beneath this addition to that general calamity,
which seemed to increase with every succeeding moment. I was now a
single man, to whose hand Providence had committed the lives of three
afflicted creatures! Never did mortal pray to heaven with more
fervour or more un-affected zeal, that I did while imploring the
Divine grace to assist me in fulfilling a mission so sacred and so
difficult.</p>

<p>But as for Zadi, he seemed to have already forgotten himself, his
past dangers, and present pains. He implored me to waste no more time
in striving to mitigate his sufferings, and assured me, that the
letter of his dear afflicted master would be the best balsam for all
his wounds. In compliance with his earnest entreaties, I prepared to
peruse the paper: but the tears gushed into my eyes on recognizing
the well-known handwriting, and it was with difficulty that I
deciphered the following words:</p>

<p>'Oh! I understand you well, my friends, my beloved-ones! your
voices, still more your unremitting and desperate exertions to
relieve me--all convince me, that you are near me; that you feel for
me; that you spare no labour to effect my rescue! Alas! you will
labour in vain! Death has already enveloped me in his dark circle;
there is no escape; I have already bidden farewell to life; I cannot
long survive in this atmosphere, corrupted as it is by the
pestilential vapours, constantly exhaling from the monster's jaws. I
die resigned; but do not embitter this last and heavy hour by the
apprehension, lest your exertions in my behalf should be the means of
involving you in my danger. By all that is sacred and dear, I conjure
you, abandon me to my unhappy fate; fly! oh! fly far from hence: it
is my last, my only, my most earnest request!</p>

<p>'Everard! Oh! Everard, my poor wife! Do not abandon my
Louisa!'</p>

<p>A cold shuddering ran through my bones: the poisonous air robbed
us even of our last wretched hope, that the anaconda might at length
retire wearied out with her vain expectations, and leave my friend at
liberty to quit his retreat. But now it was evident from his letter
that, long ere this could happen, Seafield would be no more!
immediate help must save him, or none! Zadi sobbed aloud: it was an
addition to my own grief to think, that I had been obliged to give a
fresh pang to his faithful bosom, and it wrung me to the very soul,
when I saw him give way openly to this burst of sorrow. Suddenly he
uttered a shriek--so loud, that it startled all who heard him.</p>

<p>'No! no!' he exclaimed in the most violent agitation--'No! no he
shall not bid farewell to life for ever! there are still means. Oh!
wretch that I am! curses, eternal curses on my old head, that I did
not think of it till now, and now it comes too late! I might have
saved him! I might have saved him! Had I hut thought of it sooner my
master would have been safe at this moment! now it is too late! he
must die, and 'tis my heedlessness which kills him!'</p>

<p>'For mercy sake,' I cried, 'explain yourself, old man! You see
that our messengers are not returned from Columbo--every moment that
we lose is inestimable! If you really do know any means of rescue,
tell it, discover it! Delay not an instant! Speak! To what means do
you allude?'</p>

<p>'It is too late! it is too late;' he repeated; 'no one but myself
could have carried it through; and here I lie, without the power to
move a limb, and no one else will undertake a task so desperate!'
'The means! the means!' I exclaimed again, almost frantic with
agitation.</p>

<p>'Well, then!' he resumed, his words frequently interrupted with
groans; 'the anaconda is, as I told you formerly, the most voracious
animal in nature. She is invincible while stimulated its hunger, but
she can be overcome by a very child as soon as she has satiated
herself with food; then she loses the flexibility of her joints, and
instead of her restless activity she seems plunged Iii a benumbing
torpor, and remains unable to move, overpowered by the burthen of her
immoderate meal.'</p>

<p>'Excellent dear old man!' said I, in rapture at the ray of hope
with which his words inspired me; 'is what you say certain? Could we
but satiate this anaconda---'</p>

<p>'My master were rescued!' he replied: 'but to effect this requires
the risk of a life; and who will venture that? Oh! were but these old
limbs as they were two hours ago. Could I but remove the mountain
load which weighs upon my chest, and prevents my breathing.'</p>

<p>'Oh! if I am but right in my guess!' I interrupted the old man;
'you would have driven her prey to the anaconda?'</p>

<p>'The whole herd! the whole herd!' shouted Zadi; and he sank back
exhausted by the violence of his emotions. 'This thought,' he
continued in a low voice after the pause of a moment, 'this thought
suggested itself to my recollection long ago; but, wretch that I was,
I believed its execution to be impracticable--the plague, which
lately prevailed here among the cattle, has occasioned them to be
removed from this part of the country, and they are gone too far to
be recalled in time to afford the required assistance. In despair,
therefore, I banished this scheme from my thoughts; but now that I am
rendered unable to put it in execution, I remember.'</p>

<p>'What? what?' I inquired, almost breathless with anxiety.</p>

<p>'You know well Van Derkel, the rich Hollander, whose estate joins
this? He is the most positive man breathing, and having once declared
our fears of the plague to be groundless, he refused out of pure
obstinacy to suffer his cattle to accompany those of his neighbours;
they remain on his estate at this moment; an herd might easily be
procured, and then--but it is too late, now it is too late! none but
his faithful servant would dare---'</p>

<p>'What?' said I, interrupting him; 'will not his faithful
friend?'</p>

<p>Zadi's looks met mine; they burned with new fire, while he
confessed that on me alone now rested his only hope. The flames in
his eyes seemed to have communicated themselves to my heart; and the
blessings with which he loaded me, and the effusions of gratitude to
Heaven and to me which he poured forth, confirmed the resolution
which I had already adopted.</p>

<p>'Be of good comfort, friend!' said I, as I turned to leave him;
'the man whom you sought is found! I will tread that path which no
other will tread, and I now leave you for the purpose of seeking
it.'</p>

<p>Zadi's eyes were now filled with tears of joy.</p>

<p>'May the God of my fathers bless you!' he said, raising his eye to
heaven; 'now then I can die contented; now then the hour of my
master's deliverance will strike at last.'</p>

<p>I lost no time in hastening to Van Derkel's. I offered his
herdsman the whole sum in my possession, if he would assist me in
driving the beasts under the palm-trees: but he shuddered at the
proposal, and rejected my proffered gold. I was not yet discouraged.
By his master's authority I promised him freedom, provided he would
but venture so far as to advance with the herd to the extremity of
the little grove, which on the north side separated the hill from the
open country. He hesitated; again I pressed him; and at length he
stammered out his consent, but in a voice so faint, and with a look
of such irresolution, as convinced me, that I could place little
dependence upon his promised help.</p>

<p>However, I at least neglected none of the means, which might
contribute to our mutual safety: I caused the slaves to prepare with
all diligence a couple of machines similar to those under which Zadi
had performed his hazardous undertaking. Covered with these, we began
to drive the cattle slowly before us; and as the general agitation
had caused them to be totally neglected by their keepers, during
their confinement in a place which afforded no herbage for their
nourishment, hunger made them more obedient than we should probably
have otherwise found them; and thus did we advance towards the hill,
though the little resolution of my companion evidently grew still
less with every step which we took forwards. To encourage him, I bade
him observe the tranquillity of the anaconda, who had gradually
withdrawn herself into her green shelter, so that we might almost
have doubted her being really there.</p>

<p>'That is the very thing which alarms me!' answered the trembling
slave; 'I am sure that she has already discovered, and now lurks
concealed among the leaves, in order that she may make her prey more
secure. Now then, not one step further will I advance; what I have
already ventured is enough to merit liberty; but at all events I had
rather pass the rest of my days in fetters, than purchase my freedom
by advancing a single foot beyond this spot!'</p>

<p>And with these words he hurried away. However, I was the less
disturbed at his forsaking me, when I perceived, that without him I
could manage to drive the cattle forwards, and that no natural
instinct made them aware of the neighbourhood of their enemy. It was
not long before we arrived at the hill-foot. I was now obliged to
leave the animals to their own guidance, feeling themselves no longer
annoyed by my goad they gave way to the impulse of hunger, and
dispersing themselves carelessly began to feed upon the welcome
herbage; but how great was my joy at perceiving the bull separate
himself from the rest of the herd and begin to ascend the hill. We
arrived near the group of palm-trees; everything was hushed and
tranquil; not a sound was to be heard except the noise of the
scattered branches, as the bull trampled them beneath his feet: the
anaconda seemed to have disappeared altogether.</p>

<p>But on a sudden a loud and rattling rush was heard among the
palms, and with a single spring the snake darted down like a
thunder-lap and twisted herself with her whole body round her devoted
victim. Before the animal was yet aware of his danger, he already
felt his dewlap enclosed between the wide-expanded jaws of the
monster, and her teeth struck into it deeply. Roaring aloud he
endeavoured to fly, and succeeded in dragging his tormentor a few
yards away with him; but instantly she coiled herself round him in
three or four wide folds, and drew these knots so close together,
that the entangled beast was incapable of moving, and remained as if
rooted to the place, already struggling with the terrors and pangs of
death. The first noise of this extraordinary contest had been
sufficient to put the remaining cattle to flight.</p>

<p>Unequal as was the strife, still it was not over instantly. The
noble beast wanted not spirit to defend himself, nor was his strength
easily exhausted. Now he rolled himself on the ground, and
endeavoured to crush the enemy with his weight; now he swelled every
nerve and exerted the power of every muscle, to burst the fetters in
which his limbs were enveloped; he shook himself violently; he
stamped, he bit, he roared, he pawed up the earth, he foamed at the
mouth, and then dashed himself on the ground again with convulsive
struggles. But with every moment the anaconda's teeth imprinted on
his flesh new wounds; with every moment she drew her folds tighter
and tighter; till, after struggling for a full quarter of an hour, I
at length saw the poor animal stretched out at full length and
breathless, totally deprived of motion and of life.</p>

<p>Now then I expected to see the anaconda gratify the hunger by
which she had so long been tormented: but I was ignorant, that it is
not the custom of this animal to divide its prey, but to swallow it
at one enormous morsel. The size of the murdered bull made this
impossible without much preparation; and I now learned, from the
snake's proceedings, the necessity which there was for her always
remaining in the neighbourhood of some large tree.</p>

<p>She again seized the bull with her teeth, and dragged it to the
top of the stoutest palm. Here she endeavoured to place it upright,
leaning against the trunk. Having effected this, she enveloped the
tree and the carcase together in one great fold, and continued to
draw this closer, till she had broken every individual bone in her
victim's body into a thousand pieces, and had virtually reduced it
into a shapeless mass of flesh. She was still occupied in this
manner, when I hastened back to the mansion-house to rejoice Louisa
and Zadi with the assurance of my success.</p>

<p>The roaring of the bull had already prepared the latter for my
tidings. He limped to meet me at the door in spite of his bodily
agonies, and overpowered me with thanks and benedictions. He also
informed me, that the expected succours from Columbo were at length
arrived, and that a physician had accompanied them. I immediately
requested to see the latter, and commissioned him to impart the good
news of Seafield's approaching deliverance to Louisa, with such
precautions as might prevent her enfeebled constitution from
suffering through excess of joy. I also recommended Zadi to his care,
and then hastened back to complete my work; Zadi having assured me,
that it was absolutely necessary to watch for the moment, when the
anaconda should have swallowed her prey, and be enervated and
overcome by the torpor of indigestion.</p>

<p>'You will be in no want of assistants,' he added; 'my
fellow-servants are all ready to accompany you, not only because I
have succeeded in convincing them that all danger is now at an end,
but because among the natives of Ceylon the flesh of the anaconda is
looked upon as most delicious food.'</p>

<p>In fact, on entering the courtyard I found the whole body of
domestics, women and children as well as men, prepared for the attack
with clubs, hatchets, and every sort of weapon, which had offered
itself to their hands. The party from Columbo were well provided with
ammunition; and we now all set joyfully forwards for the hill,
though, on approaching it, we judged it as well still to use some
little precaution.</p>

<p>I advanced beyond the rest. The anaconda had by this time entirely
covered the carcase with her slime, and was in the very act of
gorging this monstrous morsel. This task was not accomplished without
violent efforts: a full hour elapsed before she had quite finished
her dreadful meal; at length the carcase was entirely swallowed, and
she stretched herself out at full length in the grass, with her
stomach distended to the most astonishing dimensions. Every trace of
her former liveliness and activity had disappeared! Her immoderate
appetite had now yielded her up, impotent and defenceless, a prey
even to the least formidable foe.</p>

<p>I hasten to conclude this long and painful tragedy. I discharged
my musket at the monster at a moderate distance. This time the ball
struck her close by her eye. She felt herself wounded: her body
swelled with spite and venom, and every stripe of her variegated skin
shone with more brilliant and vivid colours. But as to revenging
herself upon her assailant, of that she was now totally incapable.
She made one vain attempt to regain her old retreat among the boughs
of the palm-trees, but sank down again upon the grass motionless and
helpless. The report of my musket was the signal agreed upon to give
notice to the expectant crowd, that they might approach without
danger. Everyone now rushed towards the snake with loud shouting and
clamours of joy. We all at once attacked her, and she soon expired
under a thousand blows; but I did not wait to witness this
catastrophe. A dearer interest occupied my mind: I hastened with all
speed to the pavilion, and knocked loudly at the door, which was
fastened within.</p>

<p>'Seafield! my friend!' I exclaimed; "tis I! 'tis Everard! Open!
open! I bring you life and liberty.'</p>

<p>A minute passed--another--and still I listened in vain for an
answer. Had fatigue overpowered him? Was he asleep, that he answered
not? I knocked again; I spoke a second time, and louder; I listened
so attentively that I could have distinguished the humming of a gnat
within the pavilion. Heaven and earth! was it possible that after all
I had come too late? The thought was distraction! I snatched an axe
from one of the slaves, and after a few blows the pavilion door flew
open.</p>

<p>I rushed into the room, and looked eagerly round for my friend. I
found him! Oh! Heaven his eyes were closed his cheeks pale, every
feature in his noble countenance so changed that he was scarcely to
be recognized. He lay extended in his armchair, and the noise of our
entrance seemed to rouse him from a long stupor He saw me, a faint
smile played round his wan lips, while he attempted to stretch out
his hand to me but it sank down again from weakness: I threw my arms
round him and pressed him to my heart in an agony of joy.</p>

<p>'You are safe!' I endeavoured to say; but the attempt to repress
my gushing tears choked my voice, and the sounds were
unintelligible.</p>

<p>'Yes!' said he with difficulty, 'this is being a friend indeed!
But tell me! Louisa--?'</p>

<p>'She lives, and expects you,' I replied; 'come, come! my friend;
rouse yourself! Make an effort, and shake off this lethargy! Look
upon your danger as no more than a frightful dream, and awake to the
real happiness which awaits you!'</p>

<p>'It waits not for me!' he answered faintly: 'I have received my
death-warrant in this chamber. My minutes are counted! Louisa--Oh!
bear me to Louisa!'</p>

<p>The chamber was hot and close even to suffocation. We removed him
with all speed into the open air, four of the slaves bearing him as
he sat in his armchair; but as we conveyed him down the hill we took
care to turn his face away from the spot where lay the breathless but
still horrible anaconda. The purer atmosphere seemed immediately to
produce a beneficial effect upon the sufferer; and his strength was
still further recruited by a few drops of a cordial, with which I had
taken care to provide myself, and which I administered with the
utmost caution.</p>

<p>On our arrival at the mansion-house, we found that Zadi's
attention had already provided everything which his master could
possibly need. His bed was prepared; every kind of refreshment was in
readiness, and the physician was waiting to afford his much-required
assistance. But we soon found that the most effectual medicine for
Seafield would be the sight of Louisa; and as the physician was of
opinion, that the lady was more likely to suffer from anxiety to see
her husband, than from the agitation of the interview, my friend was
indulged in his wish, and we supported him to the chamber, where his
wife so anxiously was expecting his approach.</p>

<p>I will not attempt to describe this interview, nor that which
afterwards took place between Seafield and the faithful Zadi; the
feeling heart of itself will fill up this chasm; yet I cannot omit
mentioning, that it was not till I had explained to my friend the
whole extent of his obligations to that faithful Indian, and till the
repeated orders of his master compelled him to appear before him,
that Zadi indulged his ardent wish to throw himself at the feet of
his beloved lord. And why then did he deprive himself so long of a
pleasure which he desired so earnestly? The noble fellow was
unwilling to assist his master by showing him how much and how
severely he had suffered for his sake! I cannot tell you how much
both the re-united couple and myself were affected by this uncommon
mark of delicacy and consideration.</p>

<p>Oh! how happily and how swiftly fled away the first days which
succeeded the deliverance of my friend: alas! those first days were
the only ones destined to pass happily. It was soon but too evident,
that Seafield's sufferings in that fatal pavilion had injured his
constitution irreparably. With every succeeding day his strength
visibly decreased, and the blighted flower bowed itself still nearer
to the ground. His malady defied the power of medicine; he seemed to
perish away before our eyes; and the physician was at length
compelled to acknowledge that all the powers of art were insufficient
to sustain any longer Seafield's exhausted frame. Not the unsatisfied
demands of nature; not the hunger which gnawed his entrails, nor the
burning thirst which dried up his palate; not the agonies of his
mind, and his painful wrestling against despair: none of these had
affected him so fatally.--No; it was the pestiferous breath exhaling
from the jaws of the anaconda, which had penetrated into Seafield's
close and sultry prison; and whose force, concentrated and increased
by confinement, had fallen upon his constitution like a baleful
mildew, and planted the seeds of dissolution in the very marrow of
his life.</p>

<p>What Louisa and myself endured, while watching his slow but
constantly progressive journey to the tomb, no words can utter. He
gave Zadi and his three sons their freedom, and made over to him a
small estate near Columbo, fully sufficient to secure the comfort of
the good old man for the remainder of his existence. During the last
days of his illness he frequently reminded me of the letter which he
had written in the pavilion, and of which Zadi had obtained
possession at such extreme risk; this paper he frequently charged me
to consider as his dying testament; he as frequently repeated the
same thing to his wife, while she wept by his bedside. His last words
were like his letter, 'Forsake not my poor Louisa!' His last action
was to place her hand in mine--he sank back a corpse on his pillow,
and Louisa fell lifeless at my feet.</p>

<p>Yet she saw him once more; she insisted on pressing her lips once
again to his. I trembled for the convulsive agonies which her
delicate frame would undergo during this last and most painful scene:
yet was I still more alarmed, when I witnessed the composure of her
affliction. She held his hand in hers; she spoke not one word; she
heaved not one sigh; not a single tear escaped from her burning eyes.
She stood long motionless by his bedside; she bent down, and pressed
her colourless lips upon his closed lids; and then slowly and
silently she withdrew to her widowed chamber.</p>

<p>I chose for Seafield's sepulchre the place which he had always
loved best, and where he had suffered the most; his tomb was raised
in the fatal pavilion. Zadi and myself laid our friend in the earth;
we should have thought his coffin profaned, had we suffered any other
hands to touch it. Seafield and his sufferings slept in the grave:
his less fortunate friends still lived to lament him.</p>

<p>My benefactor had left his property jointly to Louisa and myself;
and his wishes respecting us had been expressed too clearly to be
misunderstood. Louisa was among the loveliest of her sex; but I
should have counted it profanation, had my heart suffered itself to
harbour one thought of her less pure than is offered at the shrine of
some enfranchised saint. I loved not Louisa; no, I adored her. Alas!
it was not long before she became a saint indeed.</p>

<p>She complained not, but she sorrowed; she suffered, but it was in
silence. In vain did she forbid her lips to confess the progress
which grief made in her constitution: her emaciated form sufficiently
betrayed it. A few melancholy weeks had elapsed since the death of my
friend, when one morning her terrified women informed me, that she
was not in her apartment, nor apparently had been in bed all night.
My heart instructed me well where to seek the unfortunate. I flew to
the pavilion; she was stretched on the marble stone, which covered
her husband. In the agony of grief she had burst a blood vessel, and
her limbs were already cold; her countenance was calm, and a faint
smile seemed to play round her lips: it was the only smile which I
had seen there since Seafield's death. She was deposited in the same
grave with her husband; for myself, I was unable to sustain the
weight of grief imposed upon me by this second calamity, and a long
and dangerous illness was the consequence of my mental
sufferings.</p>

<p>The skill of my physician saved my life; and no sooner was I able
to quit the house, than I resolved to withdraw from a land rendered
hateful to me by such bitter recollections. In consequence of
Louisa's decease, the whole of Seafield's property by his will
devolved to me--I endeavoured to prevail on Zadi to accept some part
of it, but he declared that his master's liberality had gone beyond
his utmost wishes.</p>

<p>'Yet one request,' said he, 'I will venture to make. My two eldest
sons are grown up and able to take care of themselves; but the third
is young, and I feel that my death can be at no great distance. His
brothers may treat him ill, or at least may neglect him; but
condescend to take him into your care, let him be your servant, and I
shall not have a wish in this world left unaccomplished. Under the
protection of an honest man, my boy cannot fail to become an honest
man himself.'</p>

<p>Mirza (for that was the lad's name, the same who is now with me)
was in the room, and joined his entreaties to his father's with such
earnestness, that I could not refuse their request. I soon after left
Ceylon, followed by Zadi's blessings; the good old man is still
alive, and by a third hand I hear from him frequently; but the
letters which he dictates embrace but two topics, anxiety for the
welfare of his son, and regret for the loss of his beloved
master.</p>

<p>'You are now informed,' continued Everard after a moment's pause,
addressing himself to the whole society, 'you are now informed by
what means I acquired my fortune. It was the gift of gratitude: but
never can I recollect the dreadful service which I rendered Seafield
(and, alas! which I rendered, him in vain!) without feeling my frame
convulsed with horror, and my mind tortured by the most painful
recollections. It is this which has ever made me unwilling to
discourse on the means by which I became possessed of my wealth. Yet
I cannot but think it somewhat hard, that mere silence should be
construed into positive guilt; and that I should be treated as if
convicted of the most atrocious crimes, because I have not thought it
necessary to make public my private life, and to rend open anew the
wounds of my heart for the gratification of idle and impertinent
curiosity.'</p>

<p>Everard was silent; so were all around him. Confusion blushed on
every cheek, except on Jessy's, whose tender heart had been deeply
affected by the mournful story, and whose mild blue eyes still
floated in tears, though every now and then a smile beamed through
them in approbation of her lover's conduct. Her father at length
mustered up his courage, and broke through this embarrassing
silence.</p>

<p>'My dear good Everard,' said he, 'I know not how to excuse my
friends for telling me so many slanders of you, nor myself for having
been credulous enough to believe them. In truth, there is but one
person in the room, whose lips are worthy to convey to you our
apology; there then, let them make it,'--and with these words he
placed the blushing Jessy in Everard's arms.</p>

<p>And Jessy's lips wisely expressed the apology in a kiss; and
Everard acknowledged, while he pressed her to his bosom as his bride,
that the apology was not only sufficient, but a reward in full for
the sufferings which he had experienced through the vicissitudes of
his whole past life!</p>
