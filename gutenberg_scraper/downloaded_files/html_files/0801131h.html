    <p class="caption">King Peter</p>
  </div><br>

  <p class="first">MR COMMISSIONER SANDERS had graduated to West Central Africa
  by such easy stages that he did not realize when his acquaintance with the
  back lands began.</p>

  <p>Long before he was called upon by the British Government to keep a
  watchful eye upon some quarter of a million cannibal folk, who ten years
  before had regarded white men as we regard the unicorn; he had met the
  Basuto, the Zulu, the Fingo, and Pondo, Matabele, Mashona, Barotse,
  Hottentot, and Bechuana. Then curiosity and interest took him westward and
  northward, and he met the Angola folk, then northward to the Congo, westward
  to the Masai, and finally, by way of the Pigmy people, he came to his own
  land.</p>

  <p>Now, there is a subtle difference between all these races, a difference
  that only such men as Sanders know.</p>

  <p>It is not necessarily a variety of colour, though some are brown and some
  yellow, and some&mdash;a very few&mdash;jet black. The difference is in
  character. By Sanders' code you trusted all natives up to the same point, as
  you trust children, with a few notable exceptions. The Zulu were men, the
  Basuto were men, yet childlike in their grave faith. The black men who wore
  the fez were subtle, but trustworthy; but the browny men of the Gold Coast,
  who talked English, wore European clothing, and called one another "Mr." were
  Sanders' pet abomination.</p>

  <p>Living so long with children of a larger growth, it follows that he
  absorbed many of their childlike qualities. Once, on furlough in London, a
  confidence trick was played on him, and only his natural honesty pulled him
  out of a ridiculous scrape.</p>

  <p>For, when the gold-brick man produced his dull metal ingot, all Sanders'
  moral nerves stood endways, and he ran the confiding "bunco steerer" to the
  nearest station, charging him, to the astonishment of a sorely-puzzled
  policeman, with "I.G.B.," which means illicit gold buying. Sanders did not
  doubt that the ingot was gold, but he was equally certain that the gold was
  not honestly come by. His surprise when he found that the "gold" was
  gold-leaf imposed upon the lead of commerce was pathetic.</p>

  <p>You may say of Sanders that he was a statesman, which means that he had no
  exaggerated opinion of the value of individual human life. When he saw a dead
  leaf on the plant of civilization, he plucked it off, or a weed growing with
  his 'flowers' he pulled it up, not stopping to consider the weed's equal
  right to life. When a man, whether he was capita or slave, by his bad example
  endangered the peace of his country, Sanders fell upon him. In their
  unregenerate days, the Isisi called him "Ogani Isisi," which means "The
  Little Butcher Bird," and certainly in that time Sanders was prompt to hang.
  He governed a people three hundred miles beyond the fringe of civilization.
  Hesitation to act, delay in awarding punishment, either of these two things
  would have been mistaken for weakness amongst a people who had neither power
  to reason, nor will to excuse, nor any large charity.</p>

  <p>In the land which curves along the borders of Togo the people understand
  punishment to mean pain and death, and nothing else counts. There was a
  foolish Commissioner who was a great humanitarian, and he went up to
  Akasava&mdash;which is the name of this land&mdash;and tried moral
  suasion.</p>

  <p>It was a raiding palaver. Some of the people of Akasava had crossed the
  river to Ochori and stolen women and goats, and I believe there was a man or
  two killed, but that is unimportant. The goats and the women were alive, and
  cried aloud for vengeance. They cried so loud that down at headquarters they
  were heard and Mr Commissioner Niceman&mdash;that was not his name, but it
  will serve&mdash;went up to see what all the noise was about. He found the
  Ochori people very angry, but more frightened.</p><a id="picNNN"
        name="picNNN"><!--Image Anchor--></a><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="0801131h-images/A01-Pic02.gif"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>"If," said their spokesman, "they will return our goats, they may keep the
  women, because the goats are very valuable." So Mr Commissioner Niceman had a
  long, long palaver that lasted days and days, with the chief of the Akasava
  people and his councillors, and in the end moral suasion triumphed, and the
  people promised on a certain day, at a certain hour, when the moon was in
  such a quarter and the tide at such a height, the women should be returned
  and the goats also.</p><a id="picNNN"
        name="picNNN"><!--Image Anchor--></a><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="0801131h-images/A01-Pic03.gif"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>So Mr Niceman returned to headquarters, swelling with admiration for
  himself and wrote a long report about his genius and his administrative
  abilities, and his knowledge of the native, which was afterwards published in
  <i>Blue Book (Africa)</i> 7943-96.</p>

  <p>It so happened that Mr Niceman immediately afterwards went home to England
  on furlough, so that he did not hear the laments and woeful wailings of the
  Ochori folk when they did not get their women or their goats.</p>

  <p>Sanders, working round the Isisi River, with ten Houssas and an attack of
  malaria, got a helio message: "Go Akasava and settle that infernal woman
  palaver.&mdash;ADMINISTRATION." So Sanders girded up his loins, took 25
  grains of quinine, and leaving his good work&mdash;he was searching for
  M'Beli, the witch-doctor, who had poisoned a friend&mdash;trekked across
  country for the Akasava.</p>

  <p>In the course of time he came to the city and was met by the chief.</p>

  <p>"What about these women?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"We will have a palaver," said the chief. "I will summon my headmen and my
  councillors."</p>

  <p>"Summon nothing," said Sanders shortly. "Send back the women and the goats
  you stole from the Ochori."</p>

  <p>"Master," said the chief, "at full moon, which is our custom, when the
  tide is so, and all signs of gods and devils are propitious, I will do as you
  bid."</p>

  <p>"Chief," said Sanders, tapping the ebony chest of the other with the thin
  end of his walking-stick, "moon and river, gods or devils, those women and
  the goats go back to the Ochori folk by sunset, or I tie you to a tree and
  flog you till you bleed."</p><a id="picNNN"
        name="picNNN"><!--Image Anchor--></a><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="0801131h-images/A01-Pic04.gif"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div><br>

  <p>"Master," said the chief, "the women shall be returned."</p>

  <p>"And the goats," said Sanders.</p>

  <p>"As to the goats," said the chief airily, "they are dead, having been
  killed for a feast."</p>

  <p>"You will bring them back to life," said Sanders.</p>

  <p>"Master, do you think I am a magician?" asked the chief of the
  Akasava.</p>

  <p>"I think you are a liar," said Sanders impartially, and there the palaver
  finished.</p>

  <p>That night goats and women returned to the Ochori, and Sanders prepared to
  depart.</p>

  <p>He took aside the chief, not desiring to put shame upon him or to weaken
  his authority.</p>

  <p>"Chief," he said, "it is a long journey to Akasava, and I am a man
  fulfilling many tasks. I desire that you do not cause me any further journey
  to this territory."</p>

  <p>"Master," said the chief truthfully, "I never wish to see you again."
  Sanders smiled aside, collected his ten Houssas, and went back to the Isisi
  River to continue his search for M'Beli.</p>

  <p>It was not a nice search for many causes, and there was every reason to
  believe, too, that the king of Isisi himself was the murderer's protector.
  Confirmation of this view came one morning when Sanders, encamped by the Big
  River, was taking a breakfast of tinned milk and toast. There arrived
  hurriedly Sato-Koto, the brother of the king, in great distress of mind, for
  he was a fugitive from the king's wrath. He babbled forth all manner of news,
  in much of which Sanders took no interest whatever. But what he said of the
  witch-doctor who lived in the king's shadow was very interesting indeed, and
  Sanders sent a messenger to headquarters, and, as it transpired, headquarters
  despatched in the course of time Mr Niceman&mdash;who by this time had
  returned from furlough&mdash;to morally 'suade' the king of the Isisi.</p>

  <p>From such evidence as we have been able to collect it is evident that the
  king was not in a melting mood. It is an indisputable fact that poor
  Niceman's head, stuck on a pole before the king's hut, proclaimed the king's
  high spirits.</p><a id="picNNN"

  </div>

  <p>H.M.S. <i>St. George</i>, H.M.S. <i>Thrush</i>, H.M.S. <i>Philomel</i>,
  H.M.S. <i>Phoebe</i> sailed from Simons­town, and H.M.S. <i>Dwarf</i> came
  down from Sierra Leone <i>hec dum</i>, and in less than a month after the
  king killed his guest he wished he hadn't.</p>

  <p>Headquarters sent Sanders to clear up the political side of the mess.</p>

  <p>He was shown round what was left of the king's city by the flag-lieutenant
  of the St George.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid," said that gentleman, apologetically, "I am afraid that you
  will have to dig out a new king; we've rather killed the old one."</p>

  <p>Sanders nodded. "I shall not go into mourning," he said.</p>

  <p>There was no difficulty in finding candidates for the vacant post.
  Sato-Koto, the dead king's brother, expressed his willingness to assume the
  cares of office with commendable promptitude.</p>

  <p>"What do you say?" asked the admiral, commanding the expedition.</p>

  <p>"I say no, sir," said Sanders, without hesitation. "The king has a son, a
  boy of nine; the kingship must be his. As for Sato-Kato, he shall be regent
  at pleasure." And so it was arranged, Sato-Koto sulkily assenting.</p>

  <p>They found the new king hidden in the woods with the women folk, and he
  tried to bolt, but Sanders caught him and led him back to the city by the
  ear.</p>

  <p>"My boy," he said kindly, "how do people call you?"</p>

  <p>"Peter, master," whimpered the wriggling lad; "in the fashion of the white
  people."</p>

  <p>"Very well," said Sanders, "you shall be King Peter, and rule this country
  wisely and justly according to custom and the law. And you shall do hurt to
  none, and put shame on none nor shall you kill or raid or do any of the
  things that make life worth living, and if you break loose, may the Lord help
  you!" Thus was King Peter appointed monarch of the Isisi people, and Sanders
  went back to head-quarters with the little army of bluejackets and Houssas,
  for M'Beli, the witch-doctor, had been slain at the taking of the city, and
  Sanders' work was finished.</p>

  <p>The story of the taking of Isisi village, and the crowning of the young
  king, was told in the London newspapers, and lost nothing in the telling. It
  was so described by the special correspondents, who accompanied the
  expedition, that many dear old ladies of Bayswater wept, and many dear young
  ladies of Mayfair said: "How sweet!" and the outcome of the many emotions
  which the description evoked was the sending out from England of Miss Clinton
  Calbraith, who was an M.A., and unaccountably pretty.</p><a id="picNNN"
        name="picNNN"><!--Image Anchor--></a><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="0801131h-images/A01-Pic06.gif"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div>

  <p>She came out to "mother" the orphan king, to be a mentor and a friend. She
  paid her own passage, but the books which she brought and the school
  paraphernalia that filled two large packing cases were subscribed for by the
  tender readers of Tiny Toddlers, a magazine for infants. Sanders met her on
  the landing-stage, being curious to see what a white woman looked like.</p>

  <p>He put a hut at her disposal and sent the wife of his coast clerk to look
  after her.</p>

  <p>"And now, Miss Calbraith," he said, at dinner that night, "what do you
  expect to do with Peter?"</p>

  <p>She tilted her pretty chin in the air reflectively. "We shall start with
  the most elementary of lessons&mdash;the merest kindergarten, and gradually
  work up. I shall teach him callisthenics, a little botany&mdash;Mr Sanders,
  you're laughing."</p>

  <p>"No, I wasn't," he hastened to assure her; "I always make a face like
  that&mdash;er&mdash;in the evening. But tell me this&mdash;do you speak the
  language&mdash;Swaheli, Bomongo, Fingi?"</p>

  <p>"That will be a difficulty," she said thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"Will you take my advice?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Why, yes."</p>

  <p>"Well, learn the language." She nodded. "Go home and learn it." She
  frowned. "It will take you about twenty-five years."</p>

  <p>"Mr Sanders," she said, not without dignity, "you are pulling&mdash;you
  are making fun of me."</p>

  <p>"Heaven forbid!" said Sanders piously, "that I should do anything so
  wicked." The end of the story, so far as Miss Clinton Calbraith was
  concerned, was that she went to Isisi, stayed three days, and came back
  incoherent.</p>

  <p>"He is not a child!" she said wildly; "he is&mdash;a&mdash;a little
  devil!"</p>

  <p>"So I should say," said Sanders philosophically.</p>

  <p>"A king? It is disgraceful! He lives in a mud hut and wears no clothes. If
  I'd known!"</p>

  <p>"A child of nature," said Sanders blandly. "You didn't expect a sort of
  Louis Quinze, did you?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know what I expected," she said desperately; "but it was
  impossible to stay&mdash;quite impossible."</p>

  <p>"Obviously," murmured Sanders.</p>

  <p>"Of course, I knew he would be black," she went on; "and I knew
  that&mdash;oh, it was too horrid!"</p>

  <p>"The fact of it is, my dear young lady," said Sanders, "Peter wasn't as
  picturesque as you imagined him; he wasn't the gentle child with pleading
  eyes; and he lives messy&mdash;is that it?" This was not the only attempt
  ever made to educate Peter. Months afterwards, when Miss Calbraith had gone
  home and was busily writing her famous book, "Alone in Africa: by an English
  Gentlewoman," Sanders heard of another educative raid.</p>

  <p>Two members of an Ethiopian mission came into Isisi by the back way. The
  Ethiopian mission is made up of Christian black men, who, very properly,
  basing their creed upon Holy Writ, preach the gospel of Equality. A black man
  is as good as a white man any day of the week, and infinitely better on
  Sundays if he happens to be a member of the Reformed Ethiopian Church.</p>

  <p>They came to Isisi and achieved instant popularity, for the kind of talk
  they provided was very much to the liking of Sato-Koto and the king's
  councillors.</p>

  <p>Sanders sent for the missioners. The first summons they refused to obey,
  but they came on the second occasion, because the message Sanders sent was at
  once peremptory and ominous.</p>

  <p>They came to headquarters, two cultured American negroes of good address
  and refined conversation. They spoke English faultlessly, and were in every
  sense perfect gentlemen.</p><a id="picNNN"
        name="picNNN"><!--Image Anchor--></a><br>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="0801131h-images/A01-Pic07.gif"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div>

  <p>"We cannot understand the character of your command," said one, "which
  savours somewhat of interference with the liberty of the subject."</p>

  <p>"You'll understand me better," said Sanders, who knew his men, "when I
  tell you that I cannot allow you to preach sedition to my people."</p>

  <p>"Sedition, Mr Sanders!" said the negro in shocked tones. "That is a grave
  charge."</p>

  <p>Sanders took a paper from a pigeon-hole in his desk; the interview took
  place in his office.</p>

  <p>"On such a date," he said, "you said this, and this, and that." In other
  words he accused them of overstepping the creed of Equality and encroaching
  upon the borderland of political agitation.</p>

  <p>"Lies!" said the elder of the two, without hesitation.</p>

  <p>"Truth or lies," he said, "you go no more to Isisi."</p>

  <p>"Would you have the heathen remain in darkness?" asked the man, in
  reproach. "Is the light we kindle too bright, master?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Sanders, "but a bit too warm." So he committed the outrage of
  removing the Ethiopians from the scene of their earnest labours, in
  consequence of which questions were asked in Parliament.</p>

  <p>Then the chief of the Akasava people&mdash;an old friend&mdash;took a hand
  in the education of King Peter. Akasava adjoins that king's territory, and
  the chief came to give hints in military affairs.</p>

  <p>He came with drums a-beating, with presents of fish and bananas and
  salt.</p>

  <p>"You are a great king!" he said to the sleepy-eyed boy who sat on a stool
  of state, regarding him with open-mouthed interest. "When you walk the world
  shakes at your tread; the mighty river that goes flowing down to the big
  water parts asunder at your word, the trees of the forest shiver, and the
  beasts go slinking to cover when your mightiness goes abroad."</p>

  <p>"Oh, ko, ko!" giggled the king, pleasantly tickled.</p>

  <p>"The white men fear you," continued the chief of the Akasava; "they
  tremble and hide at your roar."</p>

  <p>Sato-Koto, standing at the king's elbow, was a practical man. "What seek
  ye, chief?" he asked, cutting short the compliments.</p>

  <p>So the chief told him of a land peopled by cowards, rich with the
  treasures of the earth, goats, and women.</p>

  <p>"Why do you not take them yourself?" demanded the regent.</p>

  <p>"Because I am a slave," said the chief; "the slave of Sandi, who would
  beat me. But you, lord, are of the great; being king's headman, Sandi would
  not beat you because of your greatness." There followed a palaver, which
  lasted two days.</p>

  <p>"I shall have to do something with Peter," wrote Sanders despairingly to
  the Administrator; "the little beggar has gone on the war-path against those
  unfortunate Ochori. I should be glad if you would send me a hundred men, a
  Maxim, and a bundle of rattan canes; I'm afraid I must attend to Peter's
  education myself."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">"Lord, did I not speak the truth?" said the Akasava chief in
  triumph. "Sandi has done nothing! Behold, we have wasted the city of the
  Ochori, and taken their treasure, and the white man is dumb because of your
  greatness! Let us wait till the moon comes again, and I will show you another
  city."</p>

  <p>"You are a great man," bleated the king, "and some day you shall build
  your hut in the shadow of my palace."</p>

  <p>"On that day," said the chief, with splendid resignation, "I shall die of
  joy." When the moon had waxed and waned and come again, a pencilled silver
  hoop of light in the eastern sky, the Isisi warriors gathered with spear and
  broad-bladed sword, with ingola on their bodies, and clay in their hair.</p>

  <p>They danced a great dance by the light of a huge fire, and all the women
  stood round, clapping their hands rhythmically.</p>

  <p>In the midst of this there arrived a messenger in a canoe, who prostrated
  himself before the king, saying: "Master, one day's march from here is Sandi;
  he has with him five score of soldiers and the brass gun which says:
  'Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!'"</p>

  <p>A silence reigned in court circles, which was broken by the voice of the
  Akasava chief. "I think I will go home," he said. "I have a feeling of
  sickness; also, it is the season when my goats have their young."</p>

  <p>"Do not be afraid," said Sato-Koto brutally. "The king's shadow is over
  you, and he is so mighty that the earth shakes at his tread, and the waters
  of the big river part at his footfall; also, the white men fear him."</p>

  <p>"Nevertheless," said the chief, with some agitation, "I must go, for my
  youngest son is sickening with fever, and calls all the time for me."</p>

  <p>"Stay!" said the regent, and there was no mistaking his tone.</p>

  <p>Sanders did not come the next day, nor the next. He was moving leisurely,
  traversing a country where many misunderstandings existed that wanted
  clearing up. When he arrived, having sent a messenger ahead to carry the news
  of his arrival, he found the city peaceably engaged.</p>

  <p>The women were crushing corn, the men smoking, the little children playing
  and sprawling about the streets.</p>

  <p>He halted at the outskirts of the city, on a hillock that commanded the
  main street, and sent for the regent.</p>

  <p>"Why must I send for you?" he asked. "Why does the king remain in his city
  when I come? This is shame."</p>

  <p>"Master," said Sato-Koto, "it is not fitting that a great king should so
  humble himself." Sanders was neither amused nor angry. He was dealing with a
  rebellious people, and his own fine feelings were as nothing to the peace of
  the land.</p>

  <p>"It would seem that the king has had bad advisers," he reflected aloud,
  and Sato-Koto shuffled uneasily. "Go, now, and tell the king to
  come&mdash;for I am his friend."</p>

  <p>The regent departed, but returned again alone. "Lord, he will not come,"
  he said sullenly.</p>

  <p>"Then I will go to him," said Sanders.</p>

  <p>King Peter, sitting before his hut, greeted Mr Commissioner with downcast
  eyes, Sanders' soldiers, spread in a semi-circle before the hut, kept the
  rabble at bay.</p>

  <p>"King," said Sanders&mdash;he carried in his hand a rattan cane of
  familiar shape, and as he spoke he whiffled it in the air, making a little
  humming noise&mdash;"stand up!"</p>

  <p>"Wherefore?" said Sato-Koto.</p>

  <p>"That you shall see," said Sanders.</p>

  <p>The king rose reluctantly, and Sanders grabbed him by the scruff of his
  neck.</p>

  <p><i>Swish!</i></p>

  <p>The cane caught him most undesirably, and he sprang into the air with a
  yell.</p>

  <p><i>Swish, swish, swish!</i></p>

  <p>Yelling and dancing, throwing out wild hands to ward off the punishment,
  King Peter blubbered for mercy.</p><a id="picNNN"

    <p class="caption">King Peter blubbered for mercy.</p>
  </div><br>

  <p>"Master!" Sato-Koto, his face distorted with rage, reached for his
  spear.</p>

  <p>"Shoot that man if he interferes," said Sanders, without releasing the
  king, The regent saw the levelled rifles and stepped back hastily, "Now,"
  said Sanders, throwing down the cane, "now we will play a little game."</p>

  <p>"Wow-wow-oh, ko!" sobbed his majesty.</p>

  <p>"I go back to the forest," said Sanders. "By and by a messenger shall come
  to you, saying that the Commissioner is on his way. Do you understand?"</p>

  <p>"Yi-hi!" sobbed the king.</p>

  <p>"Then will you go out with your councillors and your old men and await my
  coming according to custom. Is that clear?"</p>

  <p>"Ye-es, master," whimpered the boy.</p>

  <p>"Very good," said Sanders, and withdrew his troops.</p>

  <p>In half an hour came a grave messenger to the king, and the court went out
  to the little hill to welcome the white man, This was the beginning of King
  Peter's education, for thus was he taught obedience.</p>

  <p>Sanders went into residence in the town of Isisi, and held court,
  "Sato-Koto," he said on the second day, "do you know the village of
  Ikan?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, master; it is two days' journey into the bush."</p>

  <p>Sanders nodded. "You will take your wives, your children, your servants,
  and your possessions to the village of Ikan, there to stay until I give you
  leave to return. The palaver is finished."</p>

  <p>Next came the chief of the Akasava, very ill at ease. "Lord, if any man
  says I did you wrong, he lies," said the chief.</p>

  <p>"Then I am a liar!" said Sanders. "For I say that you are an evil man,
  full of cunning."</p>

  <p>"If it should be," said the chief, "that you order me to go to my village
  as you have ordered Sato-Koto, I will go, since he who is my father is not
  pleased with me."</p>

  <p>"That I order," said Sanders; "also, twenty strokes with a stick, for the
  good of your soul. Furthermore, I would have you remember that down by
  Tembeli on the great river there is a village where men labour in chains
  because they have been unfaithful to the Government and have practised
  abominations." So the chief of the Akasava people went out to punishment.</p>

  <p>There were other matters requiring adjustment, but they were of a minor
  character, and when these were all settled to the satisfaction of Sanders,
  but by no means to the satisfaction of the subjects, the Commissioner turned
  his attention to the further education of the king.</p>

  <p>"Peter," he said, "tomorrow when the sun comes up I go back to my own
  village, leaving you without councillors."</p>

  <p>"Master, how may I do without councillors, since I am a young boy?" asked
  the king, crestfallen and chastened.</p>

  <p>"By saying to yourself when a man calls for justice: 'If I were this man
  how should I desire the king's justice?'"</p>

  <p>The boy looked unhappy. "I am very young," he repeated; "and today there
  come many from outlying villages seeking redress against their enemies."</p>

  <p>"Very good," said Sanders. "Today I will sit at the king's right hand and
  learn of his wisdom." The boy stood on one leg in his embarrassment, and eyed
  Sanders askance.</p>

  <p>There is a hillock behind the town. A worn path leads up to it, and atop
  is a thatched hut without sides. From this hillock you see the broad river
  with its sandy shoals, where the crocodiles sleep with open mouth; you see
  the rising ground toward Akasava, hills that rise one on top of the other,
  covered with a tangle of vivid green. In this house sits the king in
  judgment, beckoning the litigants forward. Sato-Koto was wont to stand by the
  king, bartering justice. Today Sato-Koto was preparing to depart and Sanders
  sat by the king's side.</p>

  <p>There were indeed many litigants.</p>

  <p>There was a man who had bought a wife, giving no less than a thousand rods
  and two bags of salt for her. He had lived for three months with her, when
  she departed from his house.</p>

  <p>"Because," said the man philosophically, "she had a lover. Therefore,
  Mighty Sun of Wisdom, I desire the return of my rods and my salt."</p>

  <p>"What say you?" said Sanders.</p>

  <p>The king wriggled uncomfortably.</p>

  <p>"What says the father?" he said hesitatingly, and Sanders nodded.</p>

  <p>"That is a wise question," he approved, and called the father, a voluble
  and an eager old man.</p>

  <p>"Now, king," he said hurriedly, "I sold this woman, my daughter; how might
  I know her mind? Surely I fulfil my contract when the woman goes to the man.
  How shall a father control when a husband fails?" Sanders looked at the king
  again, and the boy drew a long breath.</p>

  <p>"It would seem, M'bleni, that the woman, your daughter, lived many years
  in your hut, and if you do not know her mind you are either a great fool or
  she is a cunning one. Therefore, I judge that you sold this woman knowing her
  faults. Yet the husband might accept some risk also. You shall take back your
  daughter and return 500 rods and a bag of salt, and if it should be that your
  daughter marries again, you shall pay one-half of her dowry to this man."
  Very, very slowly he gave judgment, hesitatingly, anxiously, glancing now and
  again to the white man for his approval.</p>

  <p>"That was good," said Sanders, and called forward another pleader.</p>

  <p>"Lord king," said the new plaintiff, "a man has put an evil curse on me
  and my family, so that they sicken." Here was a little poser for the little
  judge, and he puzzled the matter out in silence, Sanders offering no
  help.</p>

  <p>"How does he curse you?" at last asked the king.</p>

  <p>"With the curse of death," said the complainant in a hushed voice.</p>

  <p>"Then you shall curse him also," said the king, "and it shall be a
  question of whose curse is the stronger." Sanders grinned behind his hand,
  and the king, seeing the smile, smiled also.</p>

  <p>From here onward Peter's progress was a rapid one, and there came to
  headquarters from time to time stories of a young king who was a Solomon in
  judgment.</p>

  <p>So wise he was (who knew of the formula he applied to each case?), so
  beneficent, so peaceable, that the chief of the Akasava, from whom was
  periodically due, took advantage of the gentle administration, and sent
  neither corn nor fish nor grain. He did this after a journey to faraway Ikan,
  where he met the king's uncle, Sato-Koto, and agreed upon common action.
  Since the crops were good, the king passed the first fault, but the second
  tribute became due, and neither Akasava nor Ikan sent, and the people of
  Isisi, angry at the insolence, murmured, and the king sat down in the
  loneliness of his hut to think upon a course which was just and
  effective.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">"I really am sorry to bother you," wrote Sanders to the
  Administrator again, "but I shall have to borrow your Houssas for the Isisi
  country. There has been a tribute palaver, and Peter went down to Ikan and
  wiped up his uncle; he filled in his spare time by giving the Akasava the
  worst licking they have ever had. I thoroughly approve of all that Peter has
  done, because I feel that he is actuated only by the keenest sense of justice
  and a desire to do the right thing at the right time&mdash;and it was time
  Sato-Koto was killed&mdash;though I shall have to reprimand Peter for the
  sake of appearances. The Akasava chief is in the bush, hiding." Peter came
  back to his capital after his brief but strenuous campaign, leaving behind
  him two territories that were all the better for his visit, though somewhat
  sore.</p>

  <p>The young king brought together his old men, his witch-doctors, and other
  notabilities.</p>

  <p>"By all the laws of white men," he said, "I have done wrong to Sandi,
  because he has told me I must not fight, and, hold, I have destroyed my
  uncle, who was a dog, and I have driven the chief of the Akasava into the
  forest. But Sandi told me also that I must do what was just, and that I have
  done according to my lights, for I have destroyed a man who put my people to
  shame. Now, it seems to me that there is only one thing to do, and that is to
  go to Sandi, telling the truth and asking him to judge."</p>

  <p>"Lord king," said the oldest of his councillors, "what if Sandi puts you
  to the chain-gang?"</p>

  <p>"That is with tomorrow," quoth the king, and gave orders for preparations
  to be made for departure.</p>

  <p>Half-way to headquarters the two met; King Peter going down and Sanders
  coming up. And here befell the great incident.</p>

  <p>No word was spoken of Peter's fault before sunset; but when blue smoke
  arose from the fires of Houssa and warrior, and the little camp in the forest
  clearing was all a-chatter, Sanders took the king's arm and led him along the
  forest path.</p>

  <p>Peter told his tale and Sanders listened.</p>

  <p>"And what of the chief of the Akasava?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Master," said the king, "he fled to the forest cursing me, and with him
  went many bad men." Sanders nodded again gravely.</p>

  <p>They talked of many things till the sun threw long shadows, and then they
  turned to retrace their footsteps. They were within half a mile of the camp
  and the faint noise of men laughing, and the faint scent of fires burning
  came to them, when the chief of the Akasava stepped out from behind a tree
  and stood directly in their path.</p>

  <p>With him were some eight fighting men fully armed.</p>

  <p>"Lord king," said the chief of the Akasava, "I have been waiting for you."
  The king made neither movement nor reply, but Sanders reached for his
  revolver.</p>

  <p>His hand closed on the butt, when something struck him and he went down
  like a log.</p>

  <p>"Now we will kill the king of the Isisi, and the white man also." The
  voice was the chief's, but Sanders was not taking any particular interest in
  the conversation, because there was a hive of wild bees buzzing in his head,
  and a maze of pain; he felt sick.</p>

  <p>"If you kill me it is little matter," said the king's voice, "because
  there are many men who can take my place; but if you slay Sandi, you slay the
  father of the people, and none can replace him."</p>

  <p>"He whipped you, little king," said the chief of the Akasava
  mockingly.</p>

  <p>"I would throw him into the river," said a strange voice after a long
  interval; "thus shall no trace be found of him, and no man will lay his death
  to our door."</p>

  <p>"What of the king?" said another. Then came a crackling of twigs and the
  voices of men.</p>

  <p>"They are searching," whispered a voice. "King, if you speak I will kill
  you now."</p>

  <p>"Kill!" said the young king's even voice, and shouted, "Oh, M'sabo!
  Betelei! Sandi is here!" That was all Sandi heard.</p>

  <p>Two days later he sat up in bed and demanded information. There was a
  young doctor with him when he woke, who had providentially arrived from
  headquarters.</p>

  <p>"The king?" he hesitated.</p>

  <p>"Well, they finished the king, but he saved your life. I suppose you know
  that?"</p>

  <p>Sanders said "Yes" without emotion.</p>

  <p>"A plucky little beggar," suggested the doctor.</p>

  <p>"Very," said Sanders. Then: "Did they catch the chief of the Akasava?"</p>

  <p>"Yes; he was so keen on finishing you that he delayed his bolting. The
  king threw himself on you and covered your body."</p>

  <p>"That will do." Sanders' voice was harsh and his manner brusque at the
  best of times, but now his rudeness was brutal.</p>

  <p>"Just go out of the hut, doctor&mdash;I want to sleep." He heard the
  doctor move, heard the rattle of the "chick" at the hut door, then he turned
  his face to the wall and wept.</p>

     name="chap02">II. &mdash; KEEPERS OF THE STONE</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Weekly Tale-Teller</i>, April 23, 1910<br>
  Reprinted in <i>New Story Magazine</i>, Jun 1915</h3>

  <p class="first">THERE is a people who live at Ochori in the big African
  forest on the Ikeli River, who are called in the native tongue "The Keepers
  of the Stone." There is a legend that years and years ago, calacala, there
  was a strange, flat stone, "inscribed with the marks of the devils" (so the
  grave native story-teller puts it), which was greatly worshipped and prized,
  partly for its magic powers, and partly because of the two ghosts who guarded
  it.</p>

  <p>It was a fetish of peculiar value to the mild people who lived in the big
  forest, but the Akasava, who are neither mild nor reverential, and being,
  moreover, in need of gods, swooped down upon the Ochori one red morning and
  came away with this wonderful stone and other movables. Presumably, the
  "ghosts of brass" went also. It was a great business, securing the stone, for
  it was set in a grey slab in the solid rock, and many spear-heads were broken
  before it could be wrenched from its place. But in the end it was taken away,
  and for several years it was the boast of the Akasava that they derived much
  benefit from this sacred possession. Then of a sudden the stone disappeared,
  and with it all the good fortune of its owners. For the vanishing of the
  stone coincided with the arrival of British rule, and it was a bad thing for
  the Akasava.</p>

  <p>There came in these far-off days ('95?) a ridiculous person in white with
  an escort of six soldiers. He brought a message of peace and good fellowship,
  and talked of a new king and a new law. The Akasava listened in dazed
  wonderment, but when they recovered they cut off his head, also the heads of
  the escort. It seemed to be the only thing to do under the circumstances.</p>

  <p>Then one morning the Akasava people woke to find the city full of strange
  white folk, who had come swiftly up the river in steamboats. There were too
  many to quarrel with, so the people sat quiet, a little frightened and very
  curious, whilst two black soldiers strapped the hands and feet of the Akasava
  chief prior to hanging him by the neck till he was dead.</p>

  <p>Nor did the bad luck of the people end here; there came a lean year, when
  the manioc root was bad and full of death-water [There is a tremendous amount
  of free hydrocyanic acid (prussic acid) in manioc&mdash;EW], when goats died,
  and crops were spoilt by an unexpected hurricane. There was always a remedy
  at hand for a setback of this kind. If you have not the thing you require, go
  and take it. So, following precedents innumerable, the Akasava visited the
  Ochori, taking away much grain, and leaving behind dead men and men who
  prayed for death. In the course of time the white men came with their
  steamboats, their little brass guns, and the identical block and tackle,
  which they fastened to the identical tree and utilized in the inevitable
  manner.</p>

  <p>"It appears," said the new chief&mdash;who was afterwards hanged for the
  killing of the king of the Isisi&mdash;"that the white man's law is made to
  allow weak men to triumph at the expense of the strong. This seems foolish,
  but it will be well to humour them." His first act was to cut down the
  hanging-tree&mdash;it was too conspicuous and too significant. Then he set
  himself to discover the cause of all the trouble which had come upon the
  Akasava. The cause required little appreciation. The great stone had been
  stolen, as he well knew, and the remedy resolved itself into a question of
  discovering the thief. The wretched Ochori were suspect.</p>

  <p>"If we go to them," said the chief of the Akasava thoughtfully, "killing
  them very little, but rather burning them, so that they told where this
  godstone was hidden, perhaps the Great Ones would forgive us."</p>

  <p>"In my young days," said an aged councillor, "when evil men would not tell
  where stolen things were buried, we put hot embers in their hands and bound
  them tightly."</p>

  <p>"That is a good way," approved another old man, wagging his head
  applaudingly; "also to tie men in the path of the soldier-ants has been known
  to make them talkative."</p>

  <p>"Yet we may not go up against the Ochori for many reasons," said the
  chief; "the principal of which is that if the stone be with them we shall not
  overcome them owing to the two ghosts&mdash;though I do not remember that the
  ghosts were very potent in the days when the stone was with us," he added,
  not without hope.</p>

  <p>The little raid which followed and the search for the stone are told
  briefly in official records. The search was fruitless, and the Akasava folk
  must needs content themselves with such picking as came to hand.</p>

  <p>Of how Mr Niceman, the deputy commissioner, and then Sanders himself, came
  up, I have already told. That was long ago, as the natives say, cala-cala,
  and many things happened subsequently that put from the minds of the people
  all thought of the stone.</p>

  <p>In course of time the chief of the Akasava died the death for various
  misdoings, and peace came to the land that fringes Togo.</p>

  <p>Sanders has been surprised twice in his life. Once was at Ikeli, which in
  the native tongue means "little river." It is not a little river at all, but,
  on the contrary, a broad, strong, sullen stream that swirls and eddies and
  foams as it swings the corner of its tortuous course seaward. Sanders sat on
  a deck-chair placed under the awning of his tiny steamer, and watched the
  river go rushing past. He was a contented man, for the land was quiet and the
  crops were good. Nor was there any crime.</p>

  <p>There was sleeping sickness at Bofabi, and beri-beri at Akasava, and in
  the Isisi country somebody had discovered a new god, and, by all accounts
  that came down river, they worshipped him night and day.</p>

  <p>He was not bothering about new gods, because gods of any kind were a
  beneficent asset. Milini, the new king of the Isisi, had sent him word:
  "Master," said his mouthpiece, the messenger, "this new god lives in a box
  which is borne upon the shoulders of priests. It is so long and so wide, and
  there are four sockets in which the poles fit, and the god inside is a very
  strong one, and full of pride."</p>

  <p>"Ko, ko!" said Sanders, with polite interest, "tell the lord king, your
  master, that so long as this god obeys the law, he may live in the Isisi
  country, paying no tax. But if he tells the young men to go fighting, I shall
  come with a much stronger god, who will eat your god up. The palaver is
  finished." Sanders, with his feet stretched out on the rail of the boat,
  thought of the new god idly. When was it that the last had come? There was
  one in the N'Gombi country years ago, a sad god who lived in a hut which no
  man dare approach&mdash;there was another god who came with thunder demanding
  sacrifice&mdash;human sacrifice.</p>

  <p>This was an exceptionally bad god, and had cost the British Government six
  hundred thousand pounds, because there was fighting in the bush and a country
  unsettled.</p>

  <p>But, in the main, the gods were good, doing harm to none, for it is
  customary for new gods to make their appearance after the crops are gathered,
  and before the rainy season sets in.</p>

  <p>So Sanders thought, sitting in the shade of a striped awning on the
  foredeck of the little Zaire.</p>

  <p>The next day, before the sun came up, he turned the nose of the steamer
  upstream, being curious as to the welfare of the shy Ochori folk, who lived
  too near the Akasava for comfort, and, moreover, needed nursing. Very slow
  was the tiny steamer's progress, for the current was strong against her.
  After two days' travel Sanders got into Lukati, where young Carter had a
  station.</p>

  <p>The deputy commissioner came down to the beach in his pyjamas, with a big
  pith helmet on the back of his head, and greeted his chief boisterously.</p>

  <p>"Well?" said Sanders; and Carter told him all the news. There was a land
  palaver at Ebibi; Otabo, of Bofabi, had died of the sickness; there were two
  leopards worrying the outlying villages, and&mdash;"Heard about the Isisi
  god?" he asked suddenly; and Sanders said that he had.</p>

  <p>"It's an old friend of yours," said Carter. "My people tell me that this
  old god-box contains the stone of the Ochori."</p>

  <p>"Oh!" said Sanders, with sudden interest.</p>

  <p>He breakfasted with his subordinate, inspected his little garrison of
  thirty, visited his farm, admired his sweet potatoes, and patronized his
  tomatoes.</p>

  <p>Then he went back to the boat and wrote a short dispatch in the tiniest of
  handwriting on the flimsiest of paper slips. "In case!" said Sanders.</p>

  <p>"Bring me 14," he said to his servant, and Abiboo came back to him soon
  with a pigeon in his hand.</p>

  <p>"Now, little bird," said Sanders, carefully rolling his letter round the
  red leg of the tiny courier and fastening it with a rubber band, "you've got
  two hundred miles to fly before sunrise tomorrow&mdash;and 'ware hawks!" Then
  he gathered the pigeon in his hand, walked with it to the stern of the boat,
  and threw it into the air.</p>

  <p>His crew of twelve men were sitting about their cooking-pot&mdash;that pot
  which everlastingly boils.</p>

  <p>"Yoka!" he called, and his half-naked engineer came bounding down the
  slope.</p>

  <p>"Steam," said Sanders; "get your wood aboard; I am for Isisi." There was
  no doubt at all that this new god was an extremely powerful one.</p>

  <p>Three hours from the city the Zaire came up to a long canoe with four men
  standing at their paddles singing dolefully. Sanders remembered that he had
  passed a village where women, their bodies decked with green leaves, wailed
  by the river's edge.</p>

  <p>He slowed down till he came abreast of the canoe, and saw a dead man lying
  stark in the bottom.</p>

  <p>"Where go you with this body?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"To Isisi, lord," was the answer.</p>

  <p>"The middle river and the little islands are places for the dead," said
  Sanders brusquely. "It is folly to take the dead to the living."</p>

  <p>"Lord," said the man who spoke, "at Isisi lives a god who breathes life;
  this man"&mdash;he pointed downwards&mdash;"is my brother, and he died very
  suddenly because of a leopard. So quickly he died that he could not tell us
  where he had hidden his rods and his salt. Therefore we take him to Isisi,
  that the new god may give him just enough life to make his relations
  comfortable."</p>

  <p>"The middle river," said Sanders quietly, and pointed to such a lone
  island, all green with tangled vegetation, as might make a burying ground.
  "What is your name?"</p>

  <p>"Master, my name is N'Kema," said the man sullenly.</p>

  <p>"Go, then, N'Kema," he said, and kept the steamer slow ahead whilst he
  watched the canoe turn its blunt nose to the island and disembark its
  cargo.</p>

  <p>Then he rang the engines full ahead, steered clear of a sandbank, and
  regained the fairway.</p>

  <p>He was genuinely concerned.</p>

  <p>The stone was something exceptional in fetishes, needing delicate
  handling. That the stone existed, he knew. There were legends innumerable
  about it; and an explorer had, in the early days, seen it through his
  glasses. Also the 'ghosts clad in brass' he had heard about these fantastic
  and warlike shades who made peaceable men go out to battle&mdash;all except
  the Ochori, who were never warlike, and whom no number of ghosts could incite
  to deeds of violence.</p>

  <p>You will have remarked that Sanders took native people seriously, and
  that, I remark in passing, is the secret of good government. To him, ghosts
  were factors, and fetishes potent possibilities. A man who knew less would
  have been amused, but Sanders was not amused, because he had a great
  responsibility. He arrived at the city of Isisi in the afternoon, and
  observed, even at a distance, that something unusual was occurring. The crowd
  of women and children that the arrival of the Commissioner usually attracted
  did not gather as he swung in from mid-stream and followed the water-path
  that leads to shoal.</p>

  <p>Only the king and a handful of old men awaited him, and the king was
  nervous and in trouble.</p>

  <p>"Lord," he blurted, "I am no king in this city because of the new god; the
  people are assembled on the far side of the hill, and there they sit night
  and day watching the god in the box." Sanders bit his lip thoughtfully, and
  said nothing.</p>

  <p>"Last night," said the king, "The Keepers of the Stone appeared walking
  through the village." He shivered, and the sweat stood in big beads on his
  forehead, for a ghost is a terrible thing.</p>

  <p>"All this talk of keepers of stones is folly," said Sanders calmly; 'they
  have been seen by your women and your unblooded boys."</p>

  <p>"Lord, I saw them myself," said the king simply; and Sanders was
  staggered, for the king was a sane man.</p>

  <p>"The devil you have!" said Sanders in English; then, "What manner of ghost
  were these?"</p>

  <p>"Lord," said the king, "they were white of face, like your greatness. They
  wore brass upon their heads and brass upon their breasts. Their legs were
  bare, but upon the lower legs was brass again."</p>

  <p>"Any kind of ghost is hard enough to believe," said Sanders irritably,
  "but a brass ghost I will not have at any price." He spoke English again, as
  was his practice when he talked to himself, and the king stood silent, not
  understanding him.</p>

  <p>"What else?" said Sanders.</p>

  <p>"They had swords," continued the chief, "such as the elephant-hunters of
  the N'Gombi people carry. Broad and short, and on their arms were shields."
  Sanders was nonplussed.</p>

  <p>"And they cry 'war,'" said the chief. "This is the greatest shame of all,
  for my young men dance the death dance and streak their bodies with paint and
  tall boastfully."</p>

  <p>"Go to your hut," said Sanders; "presently I will come and join you." He
  thought and thought, smoking one black cigar after another, then he sent for
  Abiboo, his servant.</p>

  <p>"Abiboo," he said, "by my way of thinking, I have been a good master to
  you."</p>

  <p>"That is so, lord," said Abiboo.</p>

  <p>"Now I will trust you to go amongst my crew discovering their gods. If I
  ask them myself, they will lie to me out of politeness, inventing this god
  and that, thinking they please me." Abiboo chose the meal hour, when the sun
  had gone out and the world was grey and the trees motionless. He came back
  with the information as Sanders was drinking his second cup of coffee in the
  loneliness of the tiny deck-house.</p>

  <p>"Master," he reported, "three men worship no god whatever, three more have
  especial family fetishes, and two are Christians more or less, and the four
  Houssas are with me in faith."</p>

  <p>"And you?"</p>

  <p>Abiboo, the Kano boy, smiled at Sanders' assumption of innocence. "Lord,"
  he said, "I follow the Prophet, believing only in the one God, beneficent and
  merciful."</p>

  <p>"That is good," said Sanders. "Now let the men load wood, and Yoka shall
  have steam against moonrise, and all shall be ready for slipping." At ten
  o'clock by his watch he fell-in his four Houssas, serving out to each a short
  carbine and a bandoleer. Then the party went ashore.</p>

  <p>The king in his patience sat in his hut, and Sanders found him.</p>

  <p>"You will stay here, Milini," he commanded, "and no blame shall come to
  you for anything that may happen this night."</p>

  <p>"What will happen, master?"</p>

  <p>"Who knows!" said Sanders, philosophically.</p>

  <p>The streets were in pitch darkness, but Abiboo, carrying a lantern, led
  the way.</p>

  <p>Only occasionally did the party pass a tenanted hut. Generally they saw by
  the dull glow of the log that smouldered in every habitation that it was
  empty. Once a sick woman called to them in passing. It was near her time, she
  said, and there was none to help her in the supreme moment of her agony.</p>

  <p>"God help you, sister!" said Sanders, ever in awe of the mysteries of
  birth. "I will send women to you. What is your name?"</p>

  <p>"They will not come," said the plaintive voice. "Tonight the men go out to
  war, and the women wait for the great dance."</p>

  <p>"Tonight?"</p>

  <p>"Tonight, master&mdash;so the ghosts of brass decree." Sanders made a
  clicking noise with his mouth.</p>

  <p>"That we shall see," he said, and went on.</p>

  <p>The party reached the outskirts of the city. Before them, outlined against
  a bronze sky, was the dark bulk of a little hill, and this they skirted.</p>

  <p>The bronze became red, and rose, and dull bronze again, as the fires that
  gave it colour leapt or fell. Turning the shoulder of the hill, Sanders had a
  full view of the scene.</p>

  <p>Between the edge of the forest and slope of the hill was a broad strip of
  level land. On the left was the river, on the right was swamp and forest
  again.</p>

  <p>In the very centre of the plain a huge fire burnt. Before it, supported by
  its poles, on two high trestles, a square box.</p>

  <p>But the people!</p>

  <p>A huge circle, squatting on its haunches, motionless, silent; men, women,
  children, tiny babies, at their mothers' hips they stretched; a solid wheel
  of humanity, with the box and the fire as a hub.</p>

  <p>There was a lane through which a man might reach the box&mdash;a lane
  along which passed a procession of naked men, going and returning. There were
  they who replenished the fire, and Sanders saw them dragging fuel for that
  purpose. Keeping to the edge of the crowd, he worked his way to the opening.
  Then he looked round at his men.</p>

  <p>"It is written," he said, in the curious Arabic of the Kano people, "that
  we shall carry away this false god. As to which of us shall live or die
  through this adventure, that is with Allah, who knows all things." Then he
  stepped boldly along the lane. He had changed his white ducks for a dark blue
  uniform suit, and he was not observed by the majority until he came with his
  Houssas to the box. The heat from the fire was terrific, overpowering. Close
  at hand he saw that the fierceness of the blaze had warped the rough-hewn
  boards of the box, and through the opening he saw in the light a slab of
  stone.</p>

  <p>"Take up the box quickly," he commanded, and the Houssas lifted the poles
  to their shoulders. Until then the great assembly had sat in silent wonder,
  but as the soldiers lifted their burden, a yell of rage burst from five
  thousand throats, and men leapt to their feet.</p>

  <p>Sanders stood before the fire, one hand raised, and silence fell,
  curiosity dominating resentment.</p>

  <p>"People of the Isisi," said Sanders, "let no man move until the god-stone
  has passed, for death comes quickly to those who cross the path of gods." He
  had an automatic pistol in each hand, and the particular deity he was
  thinking of at the moment was not the one in the box.</p>

  <p>The people hesitated, surging and swaying, as a mob will sway in its
  uncertainty. With quick steps the bearers carried their burden through the
  lane, they had almost passed unmolested when an old woman shuffled forward
  and clutched at Sanders' arm.</p>

  <p>"Lord, lord!" she quavered, "what will you do with our god?"</p>

  <p>"Take him to the proper place," said Sanders, "being by Government
  appointed his keeper."</p>

  <p>"Give me a sign," she croaked, and the people in her vicinity repeated, "A
  sign, master!"</p>

  <p>"This is a sign," said Sanders, remembering the woman in labour. "By the
  god's favour there shall be born to Ifabi, wife of Adako, a male child." He
  heard the babble of talk; he heard his message repeated over the heads of the
  crowd; he saw a party of women go scurrying back to the village; then he gave
  the order to march. There were murmurings, and once he heard a deep-voiced
  man begin the war-chant, but nobody joined him. Somebody&mdash;probably the
  same man&mdash;clashed his spear against his wicker shield, but his warlike
  example was not followed. Sanders gained the village street. Around him was
  such a press of people that he followed the swaying box with difficulty. The
  river was in sight; the moon, rising a dull, golden ball over the trees,
  laced the water with silver, and then there came a scream of rage.</p>

  <p>"He lies! He lies! Ifabi, the wife of Adako, has a female child."</p>

  <p>Sanders turned swiftly like a dog at bay; his lips upcurled in a snarl,
  his white, regular teeth showing. "Now," said Sanders, speaking very quickly,
  "let any man raise his spear, and he dies." Again they stood irresolute, and
  Sanders, over his shoulder, gave an order.</p>

  <p>For a moment only the people hesitated; then, as the soldiers gripped the
  poles of the god-box, with one fierce yell they sprang forward.</p>

  <p>A voice screamed something; and, as if by magic, the tumult ceased, and
  the crowd darted backward and outward, falling over one another in their
  frantic desire to escape.</p>

  <p>Sanders, his pistol still loaded, stood in open-mouthed astonishment at
  the stampede.</p>

  <p>Save for his men he was alone; and then he saw.</p>

  <p>Along the centre of the street two men were walking. They were clad alike
  in short crimson kilts that left their knees bare; great brass helmets topped
  their heads, and brass cuirasses covered their breasts.</p>

  <p>Sanders watched them as they came nearer, then: "If this is not fever, it
  is madness," he muttered, for what he saw were two Roman centurions, their
  heavy swords girt about their waists.</p>

  <p>He stood still, and they passed him, so close that he saw on the boss of
  one shield the rough-moulded letters: "AUGUSTUS CAE"</p>

  <p>"Fever" said Sanders emphatically, and followed the box to the ship.</p>

  <p>When the steamer reached Lukati, Sanders was still in a condition of
  doubt, for his temperature was normal, and neither fever nor sun could be
  held accountable for the vision. Added to which, his men had seen the same
  thing.</p>

  <p>He found the reinforcements his pigeon had brought, but they were
  unnecessary now.</p>

  <p>"It beats me," he confessed to Carter, telling the story; "but we'll get
  out the stone; it might furnish an explanation. Centurions&mdash;bah!" The
  stone, exposed in the light of day, was of greyish granite, such as Sanders
  did not remember having seen before.</p>

  <p>"Here are the 'devil marks,'" he said, as he turned it over.
  "Possibly&mdash;whew!" No wonder he whistled, for closely set were a number
  of printed characters; and Carter, blowing the dust, saw&mdash;'MARIUS ET
  AUGUSTUS CENT...NERO IMPERAT...IN DEUS...DULCE.' That night, with great
  labour, Sanders, furbishing his rusty Latin, and filling in gaps, made a
  translation: "Marius and Augustus, Centurions of Nero, Caesar and Emperor,
  Sleep sweetly with the gods."</p>

  <p>"We are they who came beyond the wild lands which Hanno, the Carthaginian,
  found...</p>

  <p>"Marcus Septimus went up into Egypt, and with him Decimus Superbus, but by
  the will of Caesar, and the favour of the gods, we sailed to the black seas
  beyond...</p>

  <p>"Here we lived, our ships suffering wreck, being worshipped by the
  barbarians, teaching them warlike practices.</p>

  <p>"...You who come after...bear greetings to Rome to Cato Hippocritus, who
  dwells by the gate..." Sanders shook his head when he had finished reading,
  and said it was "rum."</p>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Weekly Tale-Teller</i>, March 19, 1910<br>
  Reprinted in <i>New Story Magazine</i>, Jul 1915</h3>

  <p class="first">FOR many years have the Ochori people formed a sort of grim
  comic relief to the tragedy of African colonization. Now it may well be that
  we shall laugh at the Ochori no more. Nor, in the small hours of the night,
  when conversation flags in the little circle about the fires in fishing
  camps, shall the sleepy-eyed be roused to merriment by stories of Ochori
  meekness. All this has come about by favour of the Liberian Government,
  though at present the Liberian Government is not aware of the fact.</p>

  <p>With all due respect to the Republic of Liberia, I say that the Monrovians
  are naturally liars and thieves.</p>

  <p>Once upon a time, that dignity might be added to the State, a warship was
  acquired&mdash;if I remember aright it was presented by a disinterested
  shipowner. The Government appointed three admirals, fourteen captains, and as
  many officers as the ship would hold, and they all wore gorgeous but
  ill-fitting uniforms. The Government would have appointed a crew also, but
  for the fact that the ship was not big enough to hold any larger number of
  people than its officers totalled.</p>

  <p>This tiny man-of-war of the black republic went to sea once, the admirals
  and captains taking it in turn to stoke and steer&mdash;a very pleasing and
  novel sensation, this latter.</p>

  <p>Coming back into the harbour, one of the admirals said&mdash;"It is my
  turn to steer now," and took the wheel.</p>

  <p>The ship struck a rock at the entrance of the harbour and went down. The
  officers escaped easily enough, for your Monrovian swims like a fish, but
  their uniforms were spoilt by the sea water. To the suggestion that salvage
  operations should be attempted to refloat the warship, the Government very
  wisely said no, they thought not.</p>

  <p>"We know where she is," said the President&mdash;he was sitting on the
  edge of his desk at Government House, eating sardines with his
  fingers&mdash;"and if we ever want her, it will be comforting to know she is
  so close to us." Nothing more would have been done in the matter but for the
  fact that the British Admiralty decided that the wreck was a danger to
  shipping, and issued orders forthwith for the place where it lay to be
  buoyed.</p>

  <p>The Liberian Government demurred on account of expense, but on pressure
  being applied (I suspect the captain of H.M.S. Dwarf, who was a man with a
  bitter tongue) they agreed, and the bell-buoy was anchored to the submerged
  steamer.</p>

  <p>It made a nice rowdy, clanging noise, did that bell, and the people of
  Monrovia felt they were getting their money's worth.</p>

  <p>But all Monrovia is not made up of the freed American slaves who were
  settled there in 1821. There are people who are described in a lordly fashion
  by the true Monrovians as "indigenous natives," and the chief of these are
  the Kroomen, who pay no taxes, defy the Government, and at intervals tweak
  the official nose of the Republic.</p>

  <p>The second day after the bell was in place, Monrovia awoke to find a
  complete silence reigning in the bay, and that in spite of a heavy swell. The
  bell was still, and two ex-admirals, who were selling fish on the foreshore,
  borrowed a boat and rowed out to investigate. The explanation was
  simple&mdash;the bell had been stolen.</p>

  <p>"Now!" said the President of the Liberian Republic in despair, "may
  Beelzebub, who is the father and author of all sin, descend upon these
  thieving Kroomen!" Another bell was attached. The same night it was stolen.
  Yet another bell was put to the buoy, and a boat-load of admirals kept watch.
  Throughout the night they sat, rising and falling with the swell, and the
  monotonous "clang-jangle-clong" was music in their ears. All night it
  sounded, but in the early morning, at the dark hour before the sun comes up,
  it seemed that the bell, still tolling, grew fainter and fainter.</p>

  <p>"Brothers," said an admiral, "we are drifting away from the bell." But the
  explanation was that the bell had drifted away from them, for, tired of half
  measures, the Kroomen had come and taken the buoy, bell and all, and to this
  day there is no mark to show where a sometime man-of-war rots in the harbour
  of Monrovia.</p>

  <p>The ingenious soul who planned and carried out this theft was one Bosambo,
  who had three wives, one of whom, being by birth Congolaise, and
  untrustworthy, informed the police, and with some ceremony Bosambo was
  arrested and tried at the Supreme Court, where he was found guilty of 'theft
  and high treason' and sentenced to ten years' penal servitude.</p>

  <p>They took Bosambo back to prison, and Bosambo interviewed the black
  gaoler.</p>

  <p>"My friend," he said, "I have a big ju-ju in the forest, and if you do not
  release me at once you and your wife shall die in great torment."</p>

  <p>"Of your ju-ju I know nothing," said the gaoler philosophically, "but I
  receive two dollars a week for guarding prisoners, and if I let you escape I
  shall lose my job."</p>

  <p>"I know a place where there is much silver hidden," said Bosambo with
  promptitude. "You and I will go to this place, and we shall be rich."</p>

  <p>"If you knew where there was silver, why did you steal bells, which are of
  brass and of no particular value?" asked his unimaginative guard.</p>

  <p>"I see that you have a heart of stone," said Bosambo, and went away to the
  forest settlement to chop down trees for the good of the State.</p>

  <p>Four months after this, Sanders, Chief Commissioner for the Isisi, Ikeli,
  and Akasava countries, received, inter alia, a communication of a stereotyped
  description&mdash;</p>

  <p>'TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN.</p>

  <p>'WANTED,&mdash;on a warrant issued by H.E. the President of Liberia,
  Bosambo Krooboy, who escaped from the penal settlement near Monrovia, after
  killing a guard. He is believed to be making for your country.'</p>

  <p>A description followed.</p>

  <p>Sanders put the document away with other such notices&mdash;they were not
  infrequent in their occurrence&mdash;and gave his mind to the eternal problem
  of the Ochori.</p>

  <p>Now, as ever, the Ochori people were in sad trouble. There is no other
  tribe in the whole of Africa that is as defenceless as the poor Ochori. The
  Fingoes, slaves as they are by name and tradition, were ferocious as the
  Masai, compared with the Ochori.</p>

  <p>Sanders was a little impatient, and a deputation of three, who had
  journeyed down to headquarters to lay the grievances of the people before
  him, found him unsympathetic.</p>

  <p>He interviewed them on his verandah.</p>

  <p>"Master, no man leaves us in peace," said one. "Isisi folk, N'Gombi people
  from far-away countries, they come to us demanding this and that, and we
  give, being afraid."</p>

  <p>"Afraid of what?" asked Sanders wearily.</p>

  <p>"We fear death and pain, also burning and the taking of our women," said
  the other.</p>

  <p>"Who is chief of you?" asked Sanders, wilfully ignorant.</p>

  <p>"I am chief, lord," said an elderly man, clad in a leopard skin.</p>

  <p>"Go back to your people, chief, if indeed chief you are, and not some old
  woman without shame; go back and bear with you a fetish&mdash;a most powerful
  fetish&mdash;which shall be, as me, watching your interest and protecting
  you. This fetish you shall plant on the edge of your village that faces the
  sun at noon. You shall mark the place where it shall be planted, and at
  midnight, with proper ceremony, and the sacrifice of a young goat, you shall
  set my fetish in its place. And after that whosoever ill-treats you or robs
  you shall do so at some risk." Sanders said this very solemnly, and the men
  of the deputation were duly impressed. More impressed were they when, before
  starting on their homeward journey, Sanders placed in their hands a stout
  pole, to the end of which was attached a flat board inscribed with certain
  marks.</p>

  <p>They carried their trophy six days' journey through the forest, then four
  days' journey by canoe along the Little River, until they came to Ochori.
  There, by the light of the moon, with the sacrifice of two goats (to make
  sure), the pole was planted so that the board inscribed with mystic
  characters would face the sun at noon.</p>

  <p>News travels fast in the back lands, and it came to the villages
  throughout the Isisi and the Akasava country that the Ochori were
  particularly protected by white magic. Protected they had always been, and
  many men had died at the white man's hand because the temptation to kill the
  Ochori folk had proved irresistible.</p>

  <p>"I do not believe that Sandi has done this thing," said the chief of the
  Akasava. "Let us go across the river and see with our own eyes, and if they
  have lied we shall beat them with sticks, though let no man kill, because of
  Sandi and his cruelty." So across the water they went, and marched until they
  came within sight of the Ochori city, and the Ochori people, hearing that the
  Akasava people were coming, ran away into the woods and hid, in accordance
  with their custom.</p>

  <p>The Akasava advanced until they came to the pole stuck in the ground and
  the board with the devil marks.</p>

  <p>Before this they stood in silence and in awe, and having made obeisance to
  it and sacrificed a chicken (which was the lawful property of the Ochori)
  they turned back.</p>

  <p>After this came a party from Isisi, and they must needs come through the
  Akasava country.</p>

  <p>They brought presents with them and lodged with the Akasava for one
  night.</p>

  <p>"What story is this of the Ochori?" asked the Isisi chief in command; so
  the chief of the Akasava told him.</p>

  <p>"You may save yourself the journey, for we have seen it."</p>

  <p>"That," said the Isisi chief, "I will believe when I have seen."</p>

  <p>"That is bad talk," said the Akasava people, who were gathered at the
  palaver; "these dogs of Isisi call us liars." Nevertheless there was no
  bloodshed, and in the morning the Isisi went on their way.</p>

  <p>The Ochori saw them coming, and hid in the woods, but the precaution was
  unnecessary, for the Isisi departed as they came.</p>

  <p>Other folk made a pilgrimage to the Ochori, N'Gombi, Bokeli, and the
  Little People of the Forest, who were so shy that they came by night, and the
  Ochori people began to realize a sense of their importance.</p>

  <p>Then Bosambo, a Krooman and an adventurer at large, appeared on the scene,
  having crossed eight hundred miles of wild land in the earnest hope that time
  would dull the memory of the Liberian Government and incidentally bring him
  to a land of milk and honey.</p>

  <p>Now Bosambo had in his life been many things. He had been steward on an
  Elder Dempster boat, he had been scholar at a mission school&mdash;he was the
  proud possessor of a bound copy of The Lives of the Saints, a reward of
  industry&mdash;and among his accomplishments was a knowledge of English.</p>

  <p>The hospitable Ochori received him kindly, fed him with sweet manioc and
  sugar-cane, and told him about Sandi's magic. After he had eaten, Bosambo
  walked down to the post and read the inscription&mdash;TRESPASSERS
  BEWARE.</p>

  <p>He was not impressed, and strolled back again thinking deeply.</p>

  <p>"This magic," he said to the chief, "is good magic. I know, because I have
  white man's blood in my veins." In support of this statement he proceeded to
  libel a perfectly innocent British official at Sierra Leone.</p>

  <p>The Ochori were profoundly moved. They poured forth the story of their
  persecutions, a story which began in remote ages, when Tiganobeni, the great
  king, came down from the north and wasted the country as far south as the
  Isisi.</p>

  <p>Bosambo listened&mdash;it took two nights and the greater part of a day to
  tell the story, because the official story-teller of the Ochori had only one
  method of telling&mdash;and when it was finished Bosambo said to
  himself&mdash;"This is the people I have long sought. I will stay here."
  Aloud he asked: "How often does Sandi come to you?"</p>

  <p>"Once every year, master," said the chief, "on the twelfth moon, and a
  little after."</p>

  <p>"When came he last?"</p>

  <p>"When this present moon is at full, three moons since; he comes after the
  big rains."</p>

  <p>"Then," said Bosambo, again to himself, "for nine months I am safe." They
  built him a hut and planted for him a banana grove and gave him seed.</p>

  <p>Then he demanded for wife the daughter of the chief, and although he
  offered nothing in payment the girl came to him. That a stranger lived in the
  chief village of the Ochori was remarked by the other tribes, for news of
  this kind spreads, but since he was married, and into the chief's family at
  that, it was accepted that the man must be of the Ochori folk, and such was
  the story that came to headquarters. Then the chief of the Ochori died. He
  died suddenly in some pain; but such deaths are common, and his son ruled in
  his place. Then the son died after the briefest reign, and Bosambo called the
  people together, the elders, the wise men, and the headman of the
  country.</p>

  <p>"It appears," he said, "that the many gods of the Ochori are displeased
  with you, and it has been revealed to me in a dream that I shall be chief of
  the Ochori.</p>

  <p>"Therefore, O chiefs and wise men and headmen, bow before me, as is the
  custom, and I will make you a great people." It is characteristic of the
  Ochori that no man said "nay" to him, even though in the assembly were three
  men who by custom might claim the chieftainship.</p>

  <p>Sanders heard of the new chief and was puzzled. "Etabo?" he
  repeated&mdash;this was how Bosambo called himself&mdash;"I do not remember
  the man&mdash;yet if he can put backbone into the people I do not care who he
  is." Backbone or cunning, or both, Bosambo was certainly installed.</p>

  <p>"He has many strange practices," reported a native agent to Sanders.
  "Every day he assembles the men of the village and causes them to walk past a
  pelebi (table) on which are many eggs. And it is his command that each man as
  he passes shall take an egg so swiftly that no eye may see him take it. And
  if the man bungle or break the egg, or be slow, this new chief puts shame
  upon him, whipping him."</p>

  <p>"It is a game," said Sanders; but for the life of him he could not see
  what game it was. Report after report reached him of the new chief's madness.
  Sometimes he would take the unfortunate Ochori out by night, teaching them
  such things as they had never known before. Thus he instructed them in what
  manner they might seize upon a goat so that the goat could not cry. Also how
  to crawl on their bellies inch by inch so that they made no sound or sign.
  All these things the Ochori did, groaning aloud at the injustice and the
  labour of it.</p>

  <p>"I'm dashed if I can understand it!" said Sanders, knitting his brows,
  when the last report came in. "With anybody but the Ochori this would mean
  war. But the Ochori!" Notwithstanding his contempt for their fighting
  qualities, he kept his Police Houssas ready.</p>

  <p>But there was no war. Instead, there came complaint from the Akasava that
  "many leopards were in the woods." Leopards will keep, thought Sanders, and,
  anyway, the Akasava were good enough hunters to settle that palaver without
  outside help. The next report was alarming. In two weeks these leopards had
  carried off three score of goats, twenty bags of salt, and much ivory.</p>

  <p>Leopards eat goats; there might conceivably be fastidious leopards that
  cannot eat goats without salt; but a leopard does not take ivory tusks even
  to pick his teeth with. So Sanders made haste to journey up the river,
  because little things were considerable in a country where people strain at
  gnats and swallow whole caravans.</p>

  <p>"Lord, it is true," said the chief of the Akasava, with some emotion,
  'these goats disappear night by night, though we watch them; also the salt
  and ivory, because that we did not watch."</p>

  <p>"But no leopard could take these things," said Sanders irritably. "These
  are thieves."</p>

  <p>The chief's gesture was comprehensive. "Who could thieve?" he said. "The
  N'Gombi people live very far away; also the Isisi. The Ochori are fools, and,
  moreover, afraid." The Sanders remembered the egg games, and the midnight
  manoeuvres of the Ochori.</p>

  <p>"I will call on this new chief," he said; and crossed the river that
  day.</p>

  <p>Sending a messenger to herald his coming, he waited two miles out of the
  city, and the councillors and wise men came out to him with offerings of fish
  and fruit.</p>

  <p>"Where is your chief?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Lord, he is ill," they said gravely. "This day there came to him a
  feeling of sickness, and he fell down moaning. We have carried him to his
  hut."</p>

  <p>Sanders nodded. "I will see him," he said grimly.</p>

  <p>They led him to the door of the chief's hut, and Sanders went in. It was
  very dark, and in the darkest corner lay a prostrate man. Sanders bent over
  him, touched his pulse lightly, felt gingerly for the swelling on the neck
  behind the ears for a sign of sleeping sickness. No symptom could he find;
  but on the bare shoulder, as his fingers passed over the man's flesh, he felt
  a scar of singular regularity; then he found another, and traced their
  direction. The convict brand of the Monrovian Government was familiar to
  him.</p>

  <p>"I thought so," said Sanders, and gave the moaning man a vigorous
  kick.</p>

  <p>"Come out into the light, Bosambo of Monrovia," he said; and Bosambo rose
  obediently and followed the Commissioner into the light.</p>

  <p>They stood looking at one another for several minutes; then Sanders,
  speaking in the dialect of the Pepper Coast, said, "I have a mind to hang
  you, Bosambo."</p>

  <p>"That is as your Excellency wishes," said Bosambo.</p>

  <p>Sanders said nothing, tapping his boot with his walking-stick and gazing
  thoughtfully downward.</p>

  <p>"Having made thieves, could you make men of these people?" he said, after
  a while.</p>

  <p>"I think they could fight now, for they are puffed with pride because they
  have robbed the Akasava," said Bosambo.</p>

  <p>Sanders bit the end of his stick like a man in doubt.</p>

  <p>"There shall be neither theft nor murder," he said. "No more chiefs or
  chiefs' sons shall die suddenly," he added significantly.</p>

  <p>"Master, it shall be as you desire."</p>

  <p>"As for the goats you have stolen, them you may keep, and the teeth
  [ivory&mdash;EW] and the salt also. For if you hand them back to Akasava you
  will fill their stomachs with rage, and that would mean war." Bosambo nodded
  slowly. "Then you shall remain, for I see you are a clever man, and the
  Ochori need such as you. But if&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Master, by the fat of my heart I will do as you wish," said Bosambo; "for
  I have always desired to be a chief under the British."</p>

  <p>Sanders was half-way back to headquarters before he missed his
  field-glasses, and wondered where he could have dropped them. At that
  identical moment Bosambo was exhibiting the binoculars to his admiring
  people.</p>

  <p>"From this day forth," said Bosambo, "there shall be no lifting of goats
  nor stealing of any kind. This much I told the great Sandi, and as a sign of
  his love, behold, he gave me these things of magic that eat up space."</p>

  <p>"Lord," said a councillor in awe, "did you know the Great One?"</p>

  <p>"I have cause to know him," said Bosambo modestly, "for I am his son."
  Fortunately Sanders knew nothing of this interesting disclosure.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap04"
     name="chap04">IV. &mdash; THE DROWSY ONE</a></h2>

  <h3>No record of prior publication under this title found<br>
  Reprinted in <i>New Story Magazine</i>, August 1915</h3>

  <p class="first">THERE were occasions when Sanders came up against the outer
  world, when he learnt, with something like bewilderment, that beyond the
  farthermost forests, beyond the lazy, swelling, blue sea, there were men and
  women who lived in houses and carefully tabooed such subjects as violent
  death and such horrid happenings as were daily features of his life.</p>

  <p>He had to treat with folk who, in the main, were illogical and who
  believed in spirits. When you deal in the abstract with government of races
  so influenced, a knowledge of constitutional law and economics is fairly
  valueless.</p>

  <p>There is one type of man that can rule native provinces wisely, and that
  type is best represented by Sanders.</p>

  <p>There are other types, as, for instance: Once upon a time a young man came
  from England with a reputation. He was sent by the Colonial Office to hold a
  district under Sanders as Deputy Commissioner.</p>

  <p>He was a Bachelor of Law, had read Science, and had acquired in a
  methodical fashion a working acquaintance with Swehili, bacteriology, and
  medicines. He was a very grave young man, and the first night of his arrival
  he kept Sanders (furtively yawning) out of his bed whilst he demonstrated a
  system whereby the aboriginal could be converted&mdash;not converted
  spiritually, but from unproductive vagrancy to a condition of good
  citizenship.</p>

  <p>Sanders said nothing beyond using the conventional expressions of polite
  interest, and despatched the young man and his tremendous baggage to an
  up-country station, with his official blessing.</p>

  <p>Torrington&mdash;this was the grave young man's name&mdash;established
  himself at Entoli, and started forth to instil into the heathen mind the
  elementary principles of applied mechanics. In other words he taught them,
  through the medium of Swaheli&mdash;which they imperfectly
  understood&mdash;and a tin kettle, the lesson of steam. They understood the
  kettle part, but could not quite comprehend what meat he was cooking, and
  when he explained for the fortieth time that he was only cooking water, they
  glanced significantly one at the other and agreed that he was not quite right
  in his head.</p>

  <p>They did not tell him this much to his face, for cannibals have very good
  manners&mdash;though their table code leaves much to be desired.</p>

  <p>Mr Torrington tried them with chemical experiments, showing them how
  sulphuric acid applied to sugar produced Su2, Su4, or words to that effect.
  He gained a reputation as a magician as a result, and in more huts than one
  he was regarded and worshipped as a Great and Clever Devil&mdash;which in a
  sense he was. But the first time he came up against the spirit of the people,
  his science, his law, and his cut-and-dried theories went phutt! And that is
  where Sanders came in&mdash;Sanders who had forgotten all the chemistry he
  ever knew, and who, as a student of Constitutional Law, was the rankest of
  failures.</p>

  <p>It came about in this way.</p>

  <p>There was a young man in Isisi who prophesied that on such a day, at such
  an hour, the river would rise and drown the people. When Mr Torrington heard
  of this prophecy he was amused, and at first took no notice of it. But it
  occurred to him that here might be a splendid opportunity for revealing to
  the barbarian a little of that science with which he was so plentifully
  endowed.</p>

  <p>So he drew a large sectional plan, showing (a) the bed of the river; (b)
  the height of the banks; (c) the maximum rise of the river; (d) the height of
  the surrounding country; and demonstrated as plainly as possible the utter
  absurdity of the prophecy.</p>

  <p>Yet the people were unconvinced, and were preparing to abandon the village
  when Sanders arrived on the scene. He sent for the prophet, who was a young
  man of neurotic tendencies, and had a wooden prison cage built on the bank of
  the river, into which the youth was introduced.</p>

  <p>"You will stay here," said Sanders, "and when the river rises you must
  prophesy that it will fall again, else assuredly you will be drowned."
  Whereupon the people settled down again in their homes and waited for the
  river to drown the prophet and prove his words. But the river at this season
  of the year was steadily falling, and the prophet, like many another, was
  without honour in his own country. Sanders went away; and, although somewhat
  discouraged, Mr Torrington resumed his experiments. First of all, he took up
  sleeping sickness, and put in three months' futile work, impressing nobody
  save a gentleman of whom more must be written in a further chapter. Then he
  dropped that study suddenly and went to another.</p>

  <p>He had ideas concerning vaccination, but the first baby he vaccinated died
  of croup, and Torrington came flying down the river telling Sanders a
  rambling story of a populace infuriated and demanding his blood. Then
  Torrington went home.</p>

  <p>"The country is now quiet," wrote Sanders to the Administrator, with
  sardonic humour. "There are numerous palavers pending, but none of any
  particular moment. The Isisi people are unusually quiet, and Bosambo, the
  Monrovian, of whom I have written your Excellency, makes a model chief for
  the Ochori. No thefts have been traced to him for three months. I should be
  grateful if full information could be supplied to me concerning an expedition
  which at the moment is traversing this country under the style of the Isisi
  Exploitation Syndicate." Curiously enough, Torrington had forgotten the fact
  that a member of this expedition had been one of the most interested students
  of his sleeping sickness clinics.</p>

  <p>The Isisi Exploitation Syndicate, Limited, was born between the entree and
  the sweet at the house of a gentleman whose Christian name was Isidore, and
  who lived in Maida Vale. At dinner one night with a dear friend&mdash;who
  called himself McPherson every day of the year except on Yum Kippur, when he
  frankly admitted that he had been born Isaacs&mdash;the question of good
  company titles came up, and Mr McPherson said he had had the "Isisi
  Exploitation" in his mind for many years. With the aid of an atlas the Isisi
  country was discovered. It was one of those atlases on which are inscribed
  the staple products of the lands, and across the Isisi was writ fair
  "Rubber," "Kola-nut," "Mahogany," and "Tobacco." I would ask the reader to
  particularly remember "Tobacco."</p>

  <p>"There's a chief I've had some correspondence with," said Mr McPherson,
  chewing his cigar meditatively; "we could get a sort of concession from him.
  It would have to be done on the quiet, because the country is a British
  Protectorate. Now, if we could get a man who'd put up the stuff, and send him
  out to fix the concession, we'd have a company floated before you could say
  knife." Judicious inquiry discovered the man in Claude Hyall Cuthbert, a
  plutocratic young gentleman, who, on the strength of once having nearly shot
  a lion in Uganda, was accepted by a large circle of acquaintances as an
  authority on Africa.</p>

  <p>Cuthbert, who dabbled in stocks and shares, was an acquisition to any
  syndicate, and on the understanding that part of his duty would be the
  obtaining of the concession, he gladly financed the syndicate to the extent
  of seven thousand pounds, four thousand of which Messrs Isidore and McPherson
  very kindly returned to him to cover the cost of his expedition.</p>

  <p>The other three thousand were earmarked for office expenses.</p>

  <p>As Mr McPherson truly said: "Whatever happens, we're on velvet, my boy,"
  which was perfectly true.</p>

  <p>Before Cuthbert sailed, McPherson offered him a little advice.</p>

  <p>"Whatever you do," he said, "steer clear of that dam' Commissioner
  Sanders. He's one of those pryin' interferin'&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I know the breed," said Cuthbert wisely. "This is not my first visit to
  Africa. Did I ever tell you about the lion I shot in Uganda?" A week later he
  sailed.</p>

  <p>In course of time came a strange white man through Sanders' domain. This
  white man, who was Cuthbert, was following the green path to the
  death&mdash;but this he did not know. He threw his face to the forest, as the
  natives say, and laughed, and the people of the village of O'Tembi, standing
  before their wattle huts, watched him in silent wonder.</p>

  <p>It was a wide path between huge trees, and the green of the undergrowth
  was flecked with sunlight, and, indeed, the green path was beautiful to the
  eye, being not unlike a parkland avenue.</p>

  <p>N'Beki, chief of this village of the O'Tembi, a very good old man, went
  out to the path when the white man began his journey.</p>

  <p>"White man," he said solemnly, "this is the road to hell, where all manner
  of devils live. Night brings remorse, and dawn brings self-hatred, which is
  worse than death." Cuthbert, whose Swaheli was faulty, and whose Bomongo talk
  was nil, grinned impatiently as his coastboy translated unpicturesquely.</p>

  <p>"Dam nigger done say, this be bad place, no good; he say bimeby you libe
  for die."</p>

  <p>"Tell him to go to blazes!" said Cuthbert noisily; "and, look here,
  Flagstaff, ask him where the rubber is, see? Tell him we know all about the
  forest, and ask him about the elephants, where their playground is?" Cuthbert
  was broad-shouldered and heavily built, and under his broad sun helmet his
  face was very hot and moist.</p>

  <p>"Tell the white man," said the chief quietly, "there is no rubber within
  seven days' journey, and that we do not know ivory; elephants there were cala
  cala&mdash;but not now."</p>

  <p>"He's a liar!" was Cuthbert's only comment. "Get these beggars moving,
  Flagstaff. Hi, alapa', avanti, trek!"</p>

  <p>"These beggars," a straggling line of them, resumed their loads
  uncomplainingly. They were good carriers, as carriers go, and only two had
  died since the march began.</p>

  <p>Cuthbert stood and watched them pass, using his stick dispassionately upon
  the laggards. Then he turned to go.</p>

  <p>"Ask him," he said finally, "why he calls this the road to
  what-d'ye-call-it?" The old man shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Because of the devils," he said simply.</p>

  <p>"Tell him he's a silly ass!" bellowed Cuthbert and followed his
  carriers.</p>

  <p>This natural path the caravan took extended in almost a straight line
  through the forest. It was a strange path because of its very smoothness, and
  the only drawback lay in the fact that it seemed to be the breeding-place of
  flies&mdash;little black flies, as big as the house-fly of familiar shape, if
  anything a little bigger.</p>

  <p>They terrified the natives for many reasons, but principally because they
  stung.</p>

  <p>They did not terrify Cuthbert, because he was dressed in tapai cloth; none
  the less, there were times when these black flies found joints in his armour
  and roused him to anger. This path extended ten miles and made pleasant
  travelling. Then the explorer struck off into the forest, following another
  path, well beaten, but more difficult.</p>

  <p>By devious routes Mr Cuthbert came into the heart of Sanders' territories,
  and he was successful in this, that he avoided Sanders. He had with him a
  caravan of sixty men and an interpreter, and in due course he reached his
  objective, which was the village of a great chief ruling a remarkable
  province&mdash;Bosambo, of the Ochori, no less; sometime Krooman, steward of
  the Elder Dempster line, chief on sufferance, but none the less an
  interesting person. Bosambo, you may be sure, came out to greet his
  visitor.</p>

  <p>"Say to him," said Cuthbert to this interpreter, "that I am proud to meet
  the great chief."</p>

  <p>"Lord chief," said the interpreter in the vernacular, "this white man is a
  fool, and has much money."</p>

  <p>"So I see," said Bosambo.</p>

  <p>"Tell him," said Cuthbert, with all the dignity of an ambassador, "that I
  have come to bring him wonderful presents."</p>

  <p>"The white man says," said the interpreter, "that if he is sure you are a
  good man he will give you presents. Now," said the interpreter carefully, "as
  I am the only man who can speak for you, let us make arrangements. You shall
  give me one-third of all he offers. Then will I persuade him to continue
  giving, since he is the father of mad people."</p>

  <p>"And you," said Bosambo briefly, "are the father of liars." He made a sign
  to his guard, and they seized upon the unfortunate interpreter and led him
  forth. Cuthbert, in a sweat of fear, pulled a revolver.</p>

  <p>"Master," said Bosambo loftily, "you no make um fuss. Dis dam' nigger, he
  no good; he make you speak bad t'ings. I speak um English proper. You sit
  down, we talk um." So Cuthbert sat down in the village of Ochori, and for
  three days there was a great giving of presents, and signing of concessions.
  Bosambo conceded the Ochori country&mdash;that was a small thing. He granted
  forest rights of the Isisi, he sold the Akasava, he bartered away the Lulungo
  territories and the "native products thereof"&mdash;I quote from the written
  document now preserved at the Colonial Office and bearing the scrawled
  signature of Bosambo&mdash;and he added, as a lordly afterthought, the Ikeli
  district.</p>

  <p>"What about river rights?" asked the delighted Cuthbert.</p>

  <p>"What will you give um?" demanded Bosambo cautiously.</p>

  <p>"Forty English pounds?" suggested Cuthbert.</p>

  <p>"I take um," said Bosambo.</p>

  <p>It was a remarkably simple business; a more knowledgeable man than
  Cuthbert would have been scared by the easiness of his success, but Cuthbert
  was too satisfied with himself to be scared at anything.</p>

  <p>It is said that his leave-taking with Bosambo was of an affecting
  character, that Bosambo wept and embraced his benefactor's feet.</p>

  <p>Be that as it may, his "concessions" in his pocket, Cuthbert began his
  coastward journey, still avoiding Sanders.</p>

  <p>He came to Etebi and found a deputy-commissioner, who received him with
  open arms. Here Cuthbert stayed a week.</p>

  <p>Mr Torrington at the time was tremendously busy with a scheme for stamping
  out sleeping sickness. Until then, Cuthbert was under the impression that it
  was a pleasant disease, the principal symptom of which was a painless coma.
  Fascinated, he extended his stay to a fortnight, seeing many dreadful sights,
  for Torrington had established a sort of amateur clinic, and a hundred cases
  a day came to him for treatment.</p>

  <p>"And it comes from the bite of a tsetse fly?" said Cuthbert. "Show me a
  tsetse." Torrington obliged him, and when the other saw the little black
  insect he went white to the lips.</p>

  <p>"My God!" he whispered, "I've been bitten by that!"</p>

  <p>"It doesn't follow&mdash;" began Torrington; but Cuthbert was blundering
  and stumbling in wild fear to his carriers' camp.</p>

  <p>"Get your loads!" he yelled. "Out of this cursed country we get as quick
  as we can!" Torrington, with philosophical calm, endeavoured to reassure him,
  but he was not to be appeased.</p>

  <p>He left Etebi that night and camped in the forest. Three days later he
  reached a mission station, where he complained of headaches and pains in the
  neck (he had not attended Torrington's clinics in vain). The missionary,
  judging from the man's haggard appearance and general incoherence that he had
  an attack of malaria, advised him to rest for a few days; but Cuthbert was
  all afret to reach the coast.</p>

  <p>Twenty miles from the mission, Cuthbert sent his carriers back, and said
  he would cover the last hundred miles of the journey alone.</p>

  <p>To this extraordinary proposition the natives agreed&mdash;from that day
  Cuthbert disappeared from the sight of man.</p>

  <p>Sanders was taking a short cut through the forest to avoid the
  interminable twists and bends of the river, when he came suddenly upon a
  village of death&mdash;four sad little huts, built hastily amidst a tangle of
  underwood. He called, but nobody answered him. He was too wary to enter any
  of the crazy habitations.</p>

  <p>He knew these little villages in the forest. It was the native custom to
  take the aged and the dying&mdash;especially those who died sleepily&mdash;to
  far-away places, beyond the reach of man, and leave them there with a week's
  food and a fire, to die in decent solitude.</p>

  <p>He called again, but only the forest answered him. The chattering, noisy
  forest, all acrackle with the movements of hidden things. Yet there was a
  fire burning which told of life.</p>

  <p>Sanders resumed his journey, first causing a quantity of food to be laid
  in a conspicuous place for the man who made the fire.</p>

  <p>He was on his way to take evidence concerning the disappearance of
  Cuthbert.</p>

  <p>It was the fourth journey of its kind he had attempted. There had been
  palavers innumerable.</p>

  <p>Bosambo, chief of the Ochori, had sorrowfully disgorged the presents he
  had received, and admitted his fault.</p>

  <p>"Lord!" he confessed, "when I was with the white man on the coast I learnt
  the trick of writing&mdash;it is a cursed gift&mdash;else all this trouble
  would not have come about.</p>

  <p>"For, desiring to show my people how great a man I was, I wrote a letter
  in the English fashion, and sent it by messenger to the coast and thence to
  friends in Sierra Leone, telling them of my fortune. Thus the people in
  London came to know of the treasure of this land." Sanders, in a few
  illuminative sentences, conveyed his impression of Bosambo's genius.</p>

  <p>"You slave and son of a slave," he said, "whom I took from a prison to
  rule the Ochori, why did you deceive this white man, selling him lands that
  were not yours?"</p>

  <p>"Lord!" said Bosambo simply, "there was nothing else I could sell." But
  there was no clue here as to Cuthbert's whereabouts, nor at the mission
  station, nor amongst the carriers detained on suspicion. One man might have
  thrown light upon the situation, but Torrington was at home fulfilling the
  post of assistant examiner in mechanics at South Kensington (more in his
  element there) and filling in his spare time with lecturing on "The Migration
  of the Bantu Races." So that the end of Sanders' fourth quest was no more
  successful than the third, or the second, or the first, and he retraced his
  steps to headquarters, feeling somewhat depressed.</p>

  <p>He took the path he had previously traversed, and came upon the Death Camp
  late in the afternoon. The fire still burnt, but the food he had placed had
  disappeared. He hailed the hut in the native tongue, but no one answered him.
  He waited for a little while, and then gave orders for more food to be placed
  on the ground.</p>

  <p>"Poor devil!" said Sanders, and gave the order to march. He himself had
  taken half a dozen steps, when he stopped. At his feet something glittered in
  the fading light. He stooped and picked it up. It was an exploded cartridge.
  He examined it carefully, smelt it&mdash;it had been recently fired. Then he
  found another. They were Lee-Metford, and bore the mark "07," which meant
  that they were less than a year old.</p>

  <p>He was still standing with the little brass cylinders in his band, when
  Abiboo came to him.</p>

  <p>"Master," said the Houssa, "who ties monkeys to trees with ropes?"</p>

  <p>"Is that a riddle?" asked Sanders testily, for his mind was busy on this
  matter of cartridges.</p>

  <p>Abiboo for answer beckoned him.</p>

  <p>Fifty yards from the hut was a tree, at the foot of which, whimpering and
  chattering and in a condition of abject terror, were two small black monkeys
  tethered by ropes.</p>

  <p>They spat and grinned ferociously as Sanders approached them. He looked
  from the cartridges to the monkeys and back to the cartridges again, then he
  began searching the grass. He found two more empty shells and a rusting
  lancet, such as may be found in the pocket-case of any explorer.</p>

  <p>Then he walked back to the hut before which the fire burnt, and called
  softly&mdash;"Mr Cuthbert!" There was no answer, and Sanders called
  again&mdash;"Mr Cuthbert!"</p>

  <p>From the interior of the hut came a groan.</p>

  <p>"Leave me alone. I have come here to die!" said a muffled voice.</p>

  <p>"Come out and be civil," said Sanders coolly; "you can die afterwards."
  After a few moments' delay there issued from the door of the hut the wreck of
  a man, with long hair and a month-old beard, who stood sulkily before the
  Commissioner.</p>

  <p>"Might I ask," said Sanders, "what your little game is?"</p>

  <p>The other shook his head wearily. He was a pitiable sight. His clothes
  were in tatters; he was unwashed and grimy.</p>

  <p>"Sleeping sickness," he said wearily. "Felt it coming on&mdash;seen what
  horrible thing it was&mdash;didn't want to be a burden. Oh, my God! What a
  fool I've been to come to this filthy country!"</p>

  <p>"That's very likely," said Sanders. "But who told you that you had
  sleeping sickness?"</p>

  <p>"Know it&mdash;know it," said the listless man.</p>

  <p>"Sit down," said Sanders. The other obeyed, and Sanders applied the
  superficial tests.</p>

  <p>"If you've got sleeping sickness," said Sanders, after the examination,
  "I'm suffering from religious mania&mdash;man, you're crazy!"</p>

  <p>Yet there was something in Cuthbert's expression that was puzzling. He was
  dull, heavy, and stupid. His movements were slow and lethargic. Sanders
  watched him as he pulled a black wooden pipe from his ragged pocket, and with
  painful slowness charged it from a skin pouch."</p>

  <p>"It's got me, I tell you," muttered Cuthbert, and lit the pipe with a
  blazing twig from the fire. "I knew it (puff) as soon as that fellow
  Torrington (puff) described the symptoms (puff);&mdash;felt dull and
  sleepy&mdash;got a couple of monkeys and injected my blood (puff)&mdash;they
  went drowsy, too&mdash;sure sign&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Where did you get that tobacco from?" demanded Sanders quickly.</p>

  <p>Cuthbert took time to consider his answer.</p>

  <p>"Fellow gave it me&mdash;chief fellow, Bosambo. Native tobacco, but not
  bad&mdash;he gave me a devil of a lot."</p>

  <p>"So I should say," said Sanders, and reaching over took the pouch and put
  it in his pocket.</p>

  <p>When Sanders had seen Mr Cuthbert safe on board a homeward-bound steamer,
  he took his twenty Houssas to the Ochori country to arrest Bosambo, and
  expected Bosambo would fly; but the imperturbable chief awaited his coming,
  and offered him the customary honours.</p>

  <p>"I admit I gave the white man the hemp," he said. "I myself smoke it,
  suffering no ill. How was I to know that it would make him sleep?"</p>

  <p>"Why did you give it him?" demanded Sanders.</p>

  <p>Bosambo looked the Commissioner full in the face.</p>

  <p>"Last moon you came, lord, asking why I gave him the Isisi country and the
  rights of the little river, because these were not mine to give. Now you come
  to me saying why did I give the white man native tobacco&mdash;Lord, that was
  the only thing I gave him that was mine."</p>

     name="chap05">V. &mdash; THE SPECIAL COMMISSIONER</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Weekly Tale-Teller</i>, November 20, 1909<br>
  Reprinted in <i>New Story Magazine</i>, September 1915</h3>

  <p class="first">THE Hon. George Tackle had the good fortune to be the son of
  his father; otherwise I am free to confess he had no claim to distinction.
  But his father, being the proprietor of the Courier and Echo (with which are
  incorporated I don't know how many dead and gone stars of the Fleet Street
  firmament), George had a "pull" which no amount of competitive merit could
  hope to contend with, and when the stories of atrocities in the district of
  Lukati began to leak out and questions were asked in Parliament, George
  opened his expensively-bound Gazetteer, discovered that the district of
  Lukati was in British territory, and instantly demanded that he should be
  sent out to investigate these crimes, which were a blot upon our boasted
  civilization.</p>

  <p>His father agreed, having altogether a false appreciation of his son's
  genius, and suggested that George should go to the office and 'get all the
  facts' regarding the atrocities. George, with a good-natured smile of
  amusement at the bare thought of anybody instructing him in a subject on
  which he was so thoroughly conversant, promised; but the Courier and Echo
  office did not see him, and the librarian of the newspaper, who had prepared
  a really valuable dossier of newspaper cuttings, pamphlets, maps, and health
  hints for the young man's guidance, was dismayed to learn that the confident
  youth had sailed without any further instruction in the question than a man
  might secure from the hurried perusal of the scraps which from day to day
  appeared in the morning press.</p>

  <p>As a special correspondent, I adduce, with ill-suppressed triumph, the
  case of the Hon. George Tackle as an awful warning to all newspaper
  proprietors who allow their parental affections to overcome their good
  judgment.</p>

  <p>All that the Hon. George knew was that at Lukati there had been four well
  authenticated cases of barbarous acts of cruelty against natives, and that
  the Commissioner of the district was responsible for the whippings and the
  torture. He thought, did the Hon. George, that this was all that it was
  necessary to know. But this is where he made his big mistake.</p>

  <p>Up at Lukati ail sorts of things happened, as Commissioner Sanders knows,
  to his cost. Once he visited the district and left it tranquil, and for
  Carter, his deputy, whom he left behind, the natives built a most beautiful
  hut, planting gardens about, all off their own bat.</p>

  <p>One day, when Carter had just finished writing an enthusiastic report on
  the industry of his people, and the whole-hearted way they were taking up and
  supporting the new regime, the chief of the village, whom Carter had
  facetiously named O'Leary (his born name was indeed Olari), came to him.</p>

  <p>Carter at the moment was walking through the well-swept street of the
  village with his hands in his coat pockets and his big white helmet tipped on
  the back of his head because the sun was setting at his back.</p>

  <p>"Father," said the Chief Olari, "I have brought these people to see you."
  He indicated with a wave of his hand six strange warriors carrying their
  shields and spears, who looked at him dispassionately.</p>

  <p>Carter nodded.</p>

  <p>"They desire," said Olari, "to see the wonderful little black fetish that
  my father carries in his pocket that they may tell their people of its
  powers."</p>

  <p>"Tell your people," said Carter good-humouredly, "that I have not got the
  fetish with me&mdash;if they will come to my hut I will show them its
  wonders." Whereupon Olari lifted his spear and struck at Carter, and the six
  warriors sprang forward together. Carter fought gamely, but he was
  unarmed.</p>

  <p>When Sanders heard the news of his subordinate's death he did not faint or
  fall into a fit of insane cursing. He was sitting on his broad verandah at
  headquarters when the dusty messenger came. He rose with pursed lips and
  frowning eyes, fingering the letter&mdash;this came from Tollemache,
  inspector of police at Bokari&mdash;and paced the verandah.</p>

  <p>"Poor chap, poor chap!" was all that he said.</p>

  <p>He sent no message to Olari; he made no preparations for a punitive raid;
  he went on signing documents, inspecting Houssas, attending dinner parties,
  as though Carter had never lived or died. All these things the spies of Olari
  reported, and the chief was thankful.</p>

  <p>Lukati being two hundred miles from headquarters, through a savage and
  mountainous country, an expedition was no light undertaking, and the British
  Government, rich as it is, cannot afford to spend a hundred thousand pounds
  to avenge the death of a subordinate official. Of this fact Sanders was well
  aware, so he employed his time in collecting and authenticating the names of
  Carter's assassins.</p>

  <p>When he had completed them he went a journey seventy miles into the bush
  to the great witch-doctor Kelebi, whose name was known throughout the coast
  country from Dakka to the Eastern borders of Togoland.</p>

  <p>"Here are the names of men who have put shame upon me," he said; "but
  principally Olari, chief of the Lukati people."</p>

  <p>"I will put a spell upon Olari," said the witch-doctor; "a very bad spell,
  and upon these men. The charge will be six English pounds." Sanders paid the
  money, and 'dashed' two bottles of square-face and a piece of proper cloth.
  Then he went back to headquarters.</p>

  <p>One night through the village of Lukati ran a whisper, and the men
  muttered the news with fearful shivers and backward glances.</p>

  <p>"Olari, the chief, is cursed!" Olari heard the tidings from his women, and
  came out of his hut into the moonlight, raving horribly.</p>

  <p>The next day he sickened, and on the fifth day he was near to dead and
  suffering terrible pains, as also were six men who helped in the slaying of
  Carter. That they did not die was no fault of the witch-doctor, who excused
  his failure on account of the great distance between himself and his
  subjects.</p>

  <p>As for Sanders, he was satisfied, saying that even the pains were cheap at
  the price, and that it would give him great satisfaction to write 'finis' to
  Olari with his own hand.</p>

  <p>A week after this, Abiboo, Sanders' favourite servant, was taken ill.
  There was no evidence of fever or disease, only the man began to fade as it
  were.</p>

  <p>Making inquiries, Sanders discovered that Abiboo had offended the
  witch-doctor Kelebi, and that the doctor had sent him the death message.</p>

  <p>Sanders took fifty Houssas into the bush and interviewed the
  witch-doctor.</p>

  <p>"I have reason," he said, "for believing you to be a failure as a slayer
  of men."</p>

  <p>"Master," said Kelebi in extenuation, "my magic cannot cross mountains,
  otherwise Olari and his friends would have died."</p>

  <p>"That is as it may be," said Sanders. "I am now concerned with magic
  nearer at hand, and I must tell you that the day after Abiboo dies I will
  hang you."</p>

  <p>"Father," said Kelebi emphatically, "under those circumstances Abiboo
  shall live." Sanders gave him a sovereign, and rode back to headquarters, to
  find his servant on the high road to recovery.</p>

  <p>I give you this fragment of Sanders' history, because it will enable you
  to grasp the peculiar environment in which Sanders spent the greater part of
  his life, and because you will appreciate all the better the irony of the
  situation created by the coming of the Hon. George Tackle.</p>

  <p>Sanders was taking breakfast on the verandah of his house. From where he
  sat he commanded across the flaming beauties of his garden a view of a broad,
  rolling, oily sea, a golden blaze of light under the hot sun. There was a
  steamer lying three miles out (only in five fathoms of water at that), and
  Sanders, through his glasses, recognized her as the Elder Dempster boat that
  brought the monthly mail. Since there were no letters on his table, and the
  boat had been "in" for two hours, he gathered that there was no mail for him,
  and was thankful, for he had outlived the sentimental period of life when
  letters were pleasant possibilities.</p>

  <p>Having no letters, he expected no callers, and the spectacle of the Hon.
  George being carried in a hammock into his garden was astonishing.</p>

  <p>The Hon. George carefully alighted, adjusted his white pith helmet,
  smoothed the creases from his immaculate ducks, and mounted the steps that
  led to the stoep.</p>

  <p>"How do?" said the visitor. "My name is Tackle&mdash;George Tackle." He
  smiled, as though to say more was an insult to his hearer's intelligence.</p>

  <p>Sanders bowed, a little ceremoniously for him. He felt that his visitor
  expected this.</p>

  <p>"I'm out on a commission," the Hon. George went on. "As you've doubtless
  heard, my governor is the proprietor of the Courier and Echo, and so he
  thought I'd better go out and see the thing for myself. I've no doubt the
  whole thing is exaggerated&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Hold hard," said Sanders, a light dawning on him. "I gather that you are
  a sort of correspondent of a newspaper?"</p>

  <p>"Exactly."</p>

  <p>"That you have come to inquire into&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Treatment of natives, and all that," said the Hon. George easily.</p>

  <p>"And what is wrong with the treatment of the native?" asked Sanders
  sweetly.</p>

  <p>The hon. gentleman made an indefinite gesture.</p>

  <p>"You know&mdash;things in newspapers&mdash;missionaries," he said rapidly,
  being somewhat embarrassed by the realization that the man, if any,
  responsible for the outrages was standing before him.</p>

  <p>"I never read the newspapers," said Sanders, "and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Of course," interrupted rhe Hon. George eagerly, "we can make it all
  right as far as you are concerned."</p>

  <p>"Oh, thank you!" Sanders' gratitude was a little overdone, but he held out
  his hand. "Well, I wish you luck&mdash;let me know how you get on."</p>

  <p>The Hon. George Tackle was frankly nonplussed. "But excuse me," he said,
  "where&mdash;how&mdash;Hang it all, where am I to put up?"</p>

  <p>"Here?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;dash it, my kit is on shore! I thought&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You thought I'd put you up?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I did think&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That I'd fall on your neck and welcome you?"</p>

  <p>"Not exactly, but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well," said Sanders, carefully folding his napkin, "I'm not so glad to
  see you as all that."</p>

  <p>"I suppose not," said the Hon. George, bridling.</p>

  <p>"Because you're a responsibility&mdash;I hate extra responsibility. You
  can pitch your tent just wherever you like&mdash;but I cannot offer you the
  hospitality you desire."</p>

  <p>"I shall report this matter to the Administrator," said the Hon. George
  ominously.</p>

  <p>"You may report it to my grandmother's maiden aunt," said Sanders
  politely.</p>

  <p>Half an hour later he saw the Hon. George rejoin the ship that brought him
  to Isisi Bassaro, and chuckled. George would go straight to the
  Administrator, and would receive a reception beside which a Sahara storm
  would be zephyrs of Araby.</p>

  <p>At the same time Sanders was a little puzzled, and not a little hurt.
  There never had been a question of atrocities in his district, and he was
  puzzled to account for the rumours that had brought the "commissioner" on his
  tour of investigation&mdash;could it be a distorted account of Olari's
  punishment?</p>

  <p>"Go quickly to the ship, taking a book to the lord who has just gone from
  here," was his command to a servant, and proceeded to scribble a note: "I am
  afraid," he wrote, "I was rather rude to you&mdash;not understanding what the
  devil you were driving at. An overwhelming curiosity directs me to invite you
  to share my bungalow until such time as you are ready to conduct your
  investigation."</p>

  <p>The Hon. George read this with a self-satisfied smirk.</p>

  <p>"The way to treat these fellows," he said to the Elder Dempster captain,
  "is to show 'em you'll stand no nonsense. I thought he'd climb down." The
  Elder Dempster captain, who knew Sanders by repute, smiled discreetly, but
  said nothing. Once more the special correspondent's mountain of baggage was
  embarked in the surf boat, and the Hon. George waved a farewell to his
  friends on the steamer.</p>

  <p>The Elder Dempster skipper, leaning over the side of his bridge, watched
  the surf boat rising and falling in the swell.</p>

  <p>"There goes a man who's looking for trouble," he said, "and I wouldn't
  take a half-share of the trouble he's going to find for five hundred of the
  best. Is that blessed anchor up yet, Mr Simmons? Half ahead&mdash;set her due
  west, Mr What's-your-name."</p>

  <p>It was something of a triumph for the Hon. George. There were ten
  uniformed policemen awaiting him on the smooth beach to handle his baggage,
  and Sanders came down to his garden gate to meet him.</p>

  <p>"The fact of it is&mdash;" began Sanders awkwardly; but the magnanimous
  George raised his hand.</p>

  <p>"Let bygones," he said, "be bygones."</p>

  <p>Sanders was unaccountably annoyed by this generous display. Still more so
  was he when the correspondent refused to reopen the question of
  atrocities.</p>

  <p>"As your guest," said George solemnly, "I feel that it would be better for
  all concerned if I pursued an independent investigation. I shall endeavour as
  far as possible, to put myself in your place, to consider all extenuating
  circumstances&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, have a gin-swizzle!" said Sanders rudely and impatiently; "you make
  me tired."</p>

  <p>"Look here," he said later, "I will only ask you two questions. Where are
  these atrocities supposed to have taken place?"</p>

  <p>"In the district of Lukati," said the Hon. George.</p>

  <p>"Olari." thought Sanders. "Who was the victim?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"There were several," said the correspondent, and produced his notebook.
  "You understand that I'd really much rather not discuss the matter with you,
  but, since you insist," he read, "Efembi of Wastambo."</p>

  <p>"Oh!" said Sanders, and his eyebrows rose.</p>

  <p>"Kabindo of Machembi."</p>

  <p>"Oh, lord!" said Sanders.</p>

  <p>The Hon. George read six other cases, and with everyone a line was wiped
  from Sanders' forehead.</p>

  <p>When the recital was finished the Commissioner said slowly&mdash;"I can
  make a statement to you which will save you a great deal of unnecessary
  trouble."</p>

  <p>"I would rather you didn't," said George, in his best judicial manner.</p>

  <p>"Very good," said Sanders; and went away whistling to order dinner.</p>

  <p>Over the meal he put it to the correspondent: "There, are a number of
  people on this station who are friends of mine. I won't disguise the fact
  from you&mdash;there is O'Neill, in charge of the Houssas; the doctor,
  Kennedy, the chap in charge of the survey party; and half a dozen more. Would
  you like to question them?"</p>

  <p>"They are friends of yours?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, personal friends."</p>

  <p>"Then," said the Hon. George, gravely, "perhaps it would be better if I
  did not see them."</p>

  <p>"As you wish," said Sanders.</p>

  <p>With an escort of four Houssas, and fifty carriers recruited from the
  neighbouring villages, the Hon. George departed into the interior, and
  Sanders saw him off.</p>

  <p>"I cannot, of course, guarantee your life," he said, at parting, "and I
  must warn you that the Government will not be responsible for any injury that
  comes to you."</p>

  <p>"I understand," said the Hon. George knowingly, "but I am not to be
  deterred. I come from a stock&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I dare say," Sanders cut his genealogical reminiscences short; "but the
  last traveller who was 'chopped' in the bush was a D'Arcy, and his people
  came over with the Conqueror."</p>

  <p>The correspondent took the straight path to Lukati, and at the end of the
  third day's march came to the village of Mfabo, where lived the great
  witch-doctor, Kelebi.</p>

  <p>George pitched his camp outside the village, and, accompanied by his four
  Houssas, paid a call upon the chief, which was one of the first mistakes he
  made, for he should have sent for the chief to call upon him; and if he
  called upon anybody, he should have made his visit to the witch-doctor, who
  was a greater man than forty chiefs.</p>

  <p>In course of time, however, he found himself squatting on the ground
  outside the doctor's house, engaged, through the medium of the interpreter he
  had brought from Sierra Leone, in an animated conversation with the
  celebrated person.</p>

  <p>"Tell him," said George to his interpreter, "that I am a great white chief
  whose heart bleeds for the native."</p>

  <p>"Is he a good man?" asked George.</p>

  <p>The witch-doctor, with the recollection of Sanders' threat, said "No!"</p>

  <p>"Why?" asked the Hon. George eagerly. "Does he beat the people?" Not only
  did he beat the people, explained the witch-doctor with relish, but there
  were times when he burnt them alive.</p>

  <p>"This is a serious charge," said George, wagging his head warningly;
  nevertheless he wrote with rapidity in his diary:</p>

  <p>"Interviewed Kelebi, respected native doctor, who states:</p>

  <p>"I have lived all my life in this district, and have never known so cruel
  a man as Sandi (Sanders). I remember once he caused a man to be drowned, the
  man's name I forget; on another occasion he burned a worthy native alive for
  refusing to guide him and his Houssas through the forest. I also remember the
  time when he put a village to the fire, causing the people great
  suffering.</p>

  <p>"The people of the country groan under his oppressions, for from time to
  time he comes demanding money and crops, and if he does not receive all that
  he asks for he flogs the villagers until they cry aloud." (I rather suspect
  that there is truth in the latter statement, for Sanders finds no little
  difficulty in collecting the hut-tax, which is the Government's due.)</p>

  <p>George shook his head when he finished writing.</p>

  <p>"This," he said, "looks very bad." He shook hands with the witch-doctor,
  and that aged villain looked surprised, and asked a question in the native
  tongue.</p>

  <p>"You no be fit to dash him somet'ing," said the interpreter.</p>

  <p>"Dash him?"</p>

  <p>"Give 'um present&mdash;bottle gin."</p>

  <p>"Certainly not," said George. "He may be satisfied with the knowledge that
  he is rendering a service to humanity; that he is helping the cause of a
  down-trodden people." The witch-doctor said something in reply, which the
  interpreter very wisely refrained from putting into English.</p>

  <p>"How go the investigations?" asked the captain of Houssas three weeks
  later.</p>

  <p>"As far as I can gather," said Sanders, "our friend is collecting a
  death-roll by the side of which the records of the Great Plague will read
  like an advertisement of a health resort."</p>

  <p>"Where is he now?"</p>

  <p>"He has got to Lukati&mdash;and I am worried"; and Sanders looked it.</p>

  <p>The Houssa captain nodded, for all manner of reports had come down from
  Lukati country. There had been good crops, and good crops mean idleness, and
  idleness means mischief. Also there had been devil dances, and the mild
  people of the Bokari district, which lies contiguous to Lukati, had lost
  women.</p>

  <p>"I've got a free hand to nip rebellion in the bud," Sanders reflected
  moodily; "and the chances point to rebellion&mdash;What do you say? Shall we
  make a report and wait for reinforcements, or shall we chance our luck?"</p>

  <p>"It's your funeral," said the Houssa captain, "and I hate to advise you.
  If things go wrong you'll get the kicks; but if it were mine I'd go, like a
  shot&mdash;naturally."</p>

  <p>"A hundred and forty men," mused Sanders.</p>

  <p>"And two Maxims," suggested the other.</p>

  <p>"We'll go," said Sanders; and half an hour later a bugle blared through
  the Houssas' lines, and Sanders was writing a report to his chief in far-away
  Lagos.</p>

  <p>The Hon. George, it may be said, had no idea that he was anything but
  welcome in the village of Lukati. Olari the chief had greeted him pleasantly,
  and told him stories of Sanders' brutality&mdash;stories which, as George
  wrote, "if true, must of necessity sound the death-knell of British integrity
  in our native possessions." Exactly what that meant, I am not disposed to
  guess.</p>

  <p>George stayed a month as the guest of Lukati. He had intended to stay at
  the most three days, but there was always a reason for postponing his
  departure.</p>

  <p>Once the carriers deserted, once the roads were not safe, once Olari asked
  him to remain that he might see his young men dance. George did not know that
  his escort of four Houssas were feeling uneasy, because his
  interpreter&mdash;as big a fool as himself&mdash;could not interpret omens.
  George knew nothing of the significance of a dance in which no less than six
  witch-doctors took part, or the history of the tumbledown hut that stood in
  solitude at one end of the village. Had he taken the trouble to search that
  hut, he would have found a table, a chair, and a truckle bed, and on the
  table a report, soiled with dust and rain, which began: "I have the honour to
  inform your Excellency that the natives maintain their industrious and
  peaceable attitude." For in this hut in his lifetime lived Carter, Deputy
  Commissioner; and the natives, with their superstitious regard for the dead,
  had moved nothing.</p>

  <p>It was approaching the end of the month, when the Hon. George thought he
  detected in his host a certain scarcely-veiled insolence of tone, and in the
  behaviour of the villagers something more threatening.</p>

  <p>The dances were a nightly occurrence now, and the measured stamping of the
  feet, the clash of spear against cane shield, and the never-ending growl of
  the song the dancers sang, kept him awake at nights. Messengers came to Olari
  daily from long distances, and once he was awakened in the middle of the
  night by screams. He jumped out of bed and pushed aside the fly of his tent
  to see half a dozen naked women dragged through the streets&mdash;the result
  of a raid upon the unoffending Bokari. He dressed, in a sweat of indignation
  and fear, and went to the chief's hut, fortunately without his interpreter,
  for what Olari said would have paralysed him.</p>

  <p>In the morning (after this entirely unsatisfactory interview) he paraded
  his four Houssas and such of his carriers as he could find, and prepared to
  depart.</p>

  <p>"Master," said Olari, when the request was interpreted, "I would rather
  you stayed. The land is full of bad people, and I have still much to tell you
  of the devilishness of Sandi. Moreover," said the chief, "tonight there is to
  be a great dance in your honour," and he pointed to where the three slaves
  were engaged in erecting a big post in the centre of the village street.</p>

  <p>"After this I will let you go," said Olari, "for you are my father and my
  mother." The Hon. George was hesitating, when, of a sudden, at each end of
  the street there appeared, as if by magic, twenty travel-stained Houssas.
  They stood at attention for a moment, then opened outwards, and in the centre
  of each party gleamed the fat water-jacket of a Maxim gun.</p>

  <p>The chief said nothing, only he looked first one way and then the other,
  and his brown face went a dirty grey. Sanders strolled leisurely along toward
  the group. He was unshaven, his clothes were torn with bush-thorn, in his
  hand was a long barrelled revolver.</p>

  <p>"Olari," he said gently; and the chief stepped forward.</p>

  <p>"I think, Olari," said Sanders, "you have been chief too long."</p>

  <p>"Master, my father was chief before me, and his father," said Olari, his
  face twitching.</p>

  <p>"What of Tagondo, my friend?" asked Sanders, speaking of Carter by his
  native name.</p>

  <p>"Master, he died," said Olari; "he died of the sickness mongo&mdash;the
  sickness itself."</p>

  <p>"Surely," said Sanders, nodding his head, "surely you also shall die of
  the same sickness."</p>

  <p>Olari looked round for a way of escape. He saw the Hon. George looking
  from one to the other in perplexity, and he flung himself at the
  correspondent's feet.</p>

  <p>"Master!" he cried, "save me from this man who hates me!" George
  understood the gesture; his interpreter told him the rest; and, as a Houssa
  servant reached out his hand to the chief, the son of the house of Widnes,
  strong in the sense of his righteousness, struck it back.</p>

  <p>"Look here, Sanders," forgetting all his previous misgivings and fears
  concerning the chief, "I should say that you have punished this poor devil
  enough!"</p>

  <p>"Take that man, sergeant," said Sanders sharply; and the Houssa gripped
  Olari by the shoulder and flung him backward.</p>

  <p>"You shall answer for this!" roared the Hon. George Tackle, in impotent
  wrath.</p>

  <p>"What are you going to do with him? My God! No, no!&mdash;not without a
  trial!" He sprang forward, but the Houssas caught him and restrained him.</p>

  <p>"For what you have done," said the correspondent&mdash;this was a month
  after, and he was going aboard the homeward steamer&mdash;"you shall
  suffer!"</p>

  <p>"I only wish to point out to you," said Sanders, "that if I had not
  arrived in the nick of time, you would have done all the suffering&mdash;they
  were going to sacrifice you on the night I arrived. Didn't you see the
  post?"</p>

  <p>"That is a lie!" said the other. "I will make England ring with your
  infamy. The condition of your district is a blot on civilization!"</p>

  <p>"There is no doubt," said Mr Justice Keneally, summing up in the libel
  action, Sanders v. The Courier and Echo and another, "that the defendant
  Tackle did write a number of very libellous and damaging statements, and, to
  my mind, the most appalling aspect of the case is that, commissioned as he
  was to investigate the condition of affairs in the district of Lukati, he did
  not even trouble to find out where Lukati was. As you have been told,
  gentlemen of the jury, there are no less than four Lukatis in West Africa,
  the one in Togoland being the district in which it was intended the defendant
  should go. How he came to mistake Lukati of British West Africa for the
  Lukati of German Togoland, I do not know, but in order to bolster up his
  charges against a perfectly-innocent British official he brought forward a
  number of unsupported statements, each of which must be regarded as damaging
  to the plaintiff, but more damaging still to the newspaper that in its
  colossal ignorance published them." The jury awarded Sanders nine thousand
  seven hundred and fifty pounds.</p>

     name="chap06">VI. &mdash; THE DANCING STONES</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in The Weekly Tale-Teller, August 6, 1910<br>
  Reprinted in <i>New Story Magazine</i>, October 1915</h3>

  <p class="first">HEROES should be tall and handsome, with flashing eyes;
  Sanders was not so tall, was yellow of face, moreover had grey hair. Heroes
  should also be of gentle address, full of soft phrases, for such tender women
  who come over their horizon; Sanders was a dispassionate man who swore on the
  slightest provocation, and had no use for women any way.</p>

  <p>When you place a man upon a throne, even though that throne be a wooden
  stool worth in the mart fourpence more or less, you assume a responsibility
  which greatly outweighs all the satisfaction or personal gratification you
  may derive from your achievement. There is a grave in Toledo, a slab of
  brass, over a great kingmaker who lived long enough to realize his
  insignificance. The epitaph upon that brass tomb of his is eloquent of his
  sum knowledge of life and human effort. PULVIS ET NIHIL says the inscription,
  and Powder and Nothing is the ultimate destiny of all kingmakers.</p>

  <p>Sanders was a maker of kings in the early days. He helped break a few, so
  it was in obedience to the laws of compensation that he took his part in
  reconstructive work.</p>

  <p>He broke Esindini, Matabini, T'saki&mdash;to name three&mdash;and helped,
  in the very old days, and in another country, to break Lobengula, the Great
  Bull.</p>

  <p>King-maker he was beyond question&mdash;you could see Republicanism
  written legibly in the amused grin with which he made them&mdash;but the
  kings he made were little ones&mdash;that is the custom of the
  British-African rule, they break a big king and put many little kings in his
  place, because it is much safer.</p>

  <p>Somewhere about 12° north; and in longitude 0°, is a land which is
  peculiar for the fact that it is British, French, German, and
  Italian&mdash;according to which map of Africa you judge it by.</p>

  <p>At the time of which I write it was neither, but it was ruled by
  Mensikilimbili for the Great King. He was the most powerful of monarchs, and,
  for the matter of that, the most cruel. His dominion stretched 'from moonrise
  to sunset' said the natives, and he held undisputed sway.</p>

  <p>He had a court, and sat upon an ivory throne, and wore over the leopard
  skins of his rank a mantle woven of gold thread and scarlet thread, and he
  administered justice. He had three hundred wives and forty thousand fighting
  men, and his acquaintance with white men began and ended with the coming of a
  French Mission, who presented him with a tall hat, a barrel organ, and one
  hundred thousand francs in gold.</p>

  <p>This was Limbili, the great King of Yitingi.</p>

  <p>The little kings of the Southern lands spoke of him with bated breath; his
  name was uttered in a low voice, as of a god; he was the symbol of majesty
  and of might&mdash;the Isisi people, themselves a nation of some importance,
  and boastful likewise, referred to themselves disparagingly when the kingdom
  of Yitingi was mentioned.</p>

  <p>Following the French Mission, Sanders went up as envoy to the Limbilu,
  carrying presents of a kind and messages of good will.</p>

  <p>He was escorted into the territory by a great army and was lodged in the
  city of the king. After two days' waiting he was informed that his Majesty
  would see him, and was led to the Presence.</p>

  <p>The Presence was an old man, a vicious old man, if Sanders was any judge
  of character, who showed unmistakable signs of anger and contempt when the
  Commissioner displayed his presents.</p>

  <p>"And what are these, white man?" said the king. "Toys for my women, or
  presents for my little chiefs?"</p>

  <p>"These are for your Greatness," said Sanders quietly, "from a people who
  do not gauge friendship by the costliness of presents."</p>

  <p>The king gave a little sniff. "Tell me, white man," he said; "in your
  travels have you ever seen so great a king as I?"</p>

  <p>"Lord king," said Sanders, frank to a fault "I have seen greater."</p>

  <p>The king frowned, and the crowd about his sacred person muttered
  menacingly.</p>

  <p>"There you lie," said the king calmly; "for there never was a greater king
  than I."</p>

  <p>"Let the white man say who is greater," croaked an aged councillor, and a
  murmur of approval arose.</p>

  <p>"Lord," said Sanders, looking into the eyes of the old man who sat on the
  throne, "I have seen Lo Ben." [Lo Bengola, the King of the Matabele&mdash;EW]
  The king frowned again, and nodded.</p>

  <p>"Of him I have heard," he said; "he was a great king and an eater-up of
  nations&mdash;who else?"</p>

  <p>"King," lied Sanders, "also Ketcewayo"; and something like a hush fell
  upon the court, for the name of Ketcewayo was one that travelled north.</p>

  <p>"But of white kings," persisted the chief; "is there a white king in the
  world whose word when it goes forth causes men to tremble?" Sanders grinned
  internally, knowing such a king, but answered that in all his life he had
  never met such a king.</p>

  <p>"And of armies," said the king, "have you ever seen an army such as mine?"
  And so through the category of his possessions he ran; and Sanders, finding
  that the lie was to save himself a great deal of trouble, lied and acclaimed
  King Limbili as the greatest king in all the world, commander of the most
  perfect army, ruler of a sublime kingdom.</p>

  <p>It may be said that the kingdom of Yitingi owed its integrity to its
  faults, for, satisfied with the perfection of all his possessions, the great
  king confined his injustices, his cruelties, and his little wars within the
  boundaries of his state. Also he sought relaxation therein.</p>

  <p>One day, just after the rains, when the world was cool and the air filled
  with the faint scent of African spring, Sanders made a tour through the
  little provinces.</p>

  <p>These are those lands which lie away from the big rivers. Countries curled
  up in odd corners, bisected sharply on the map by this or that international
  boundary line, or scattered on the fringe of the wild country vaguely
  inscribed by the cartographer as "Under British Influence." It was always in
  interesting journey&mdash;Sanders made it once a year&mdash;for the way led
  up strange rivers and through unfamiliar scenes, past villages where other
  white men than Sanders were never seen. After a month's travel the
  Commissioner came to Icheli, which lies on the border of the great king's
  domain, and with immense civility he was received by the elders and the
  chiefs.</p>

  <p>"Lord, you have come at a good moment," said the chief solemnly, "tonight
  Daihili dances."</p>

  <p>"And who is Daihili?" asked Sanders.</p>

  <p>They told him; later they brought for his inspection a self-conscious
  girl, a trifle pert, he thought, for a native.</p>

  <p>A slim girl, taller than the average woman, with a figure perfectly
  modelled, a face not unpleasant even from the European standpoint, graceful
  in carriage, her every movement harmonious. Sanders, chewing the end of his
  cigar, took her in at one glance.</p>

  <p>"My girl, they tell me that you dance," he said.</p>

  <p>"That is so, master," she said; "I am the greatest dancer in all the
  world."</p>

  <p>"So far I cannot go," said the cautious Commissioner; "but I do not doubt
  that your dancing is very wonderful."</p>

  <p>"Lord," she said, with a gesture, "when I dance men go mad, losing their
  senses. Tonight when the moon is high I will show you the dance of the Three
  Lovers."</p>

  <p>"Tonight," said Sanders briefly, "I shall be in bed&mdash;and, I trust,
  asleep." The girl frowned a little, was possibly piqued, being a woman of
  fifteen, and in no wise different to women elsewhere in the world. This
  Sanders did not know, and I doubt whether the knowledge would have helped him
  much if he did.</p>

  <p>He heard the tom-tom beating, that night as he lay in bed, and the
  rhythmical clapping of hands, and fell asleep wondering what would be the end
  of a girl who danced so that men went mad.</p>

  <p>The child was the chief's daughter, and at parting Sanders had a few words
  to say concerning her.</p>

  <p>"This daughter of yours is fifteen, and it would be better if she were
  married," he said.</p>

  <p>"Lord, she has many lovers, but none rich enough to buy her," said the
  proud father, "because she is so great a dancer. Chiefs and headmen from
  villages far distant come to see her." He looked round and lowered his voice.
  "It is said," he whispered, "that the Great One himself has spoken of her.
  Perhaps he will send for her, offering this and that. In such a case," said
  the chief hopefully, "I will barter and bargain, keeping him in suspense, and
  every day the price will rise&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"If the Great One need her, let her go," said Sanders, "lest instead of
  money presents he sends an army. I will have no war, or women palaver, which
  is worse than war, in my country&mdash;mark that, chief."</p>

  <p>"Lord, your word is my desire," said the chief conventionally.</p>

  <p>Sanders went back to his own people by easy stages. At Isisi he was
  detained for over a week over a question of witchcraft; at Belembi (in the
  Isisi country) he stopped three days to settle a case of murder by fetish. He
  was delivering judgement, and Abiboo, the Sergeant of Police, was selecting
  and testing his stoutest cane for the whipping which was to follow, when the
  chief of the Icheli came flying down the river with three canoes, and
  Sanders, who, from where he sat, commanded an uninterrupted view of the
  river, knew there was trouble&mdash;and guessed what that trouble was.</p>

  <p>"Justice!" demanded the chief, his voice trembling with the rage and fear
  he had nursed, "justice against the Old One, the stealer of girls, the
  destroyer of cities&mdash;may death go to him. Iwa!&mdash;" The very day
  Sanders had left, the messenger of the great king had come, and with him a
  hundred warriors, demanding the dancing girl. True to his pre-arranged
  scheme, the chief began the inevitable bargaining over terms. The presents
  offered were too small. The girl was worth a hundred thousand rods&mdash;nay,
  a thousand bags of salt.</p>

  <p>"You were mad," said Sanders calmly; "no woman is worth a thousand bags of
  salt."</p>

  <p>"Well, that might be," admitted the outraged father; "yet it would be
  folly to begin by naming a price too low. The bargaining went on through the
  night and all the next day, and in the end the envoy of the great king grew
  impatient.</p>

  <p>"Let the woman be sent for," he said, and obedient to the summons came
  Daihili, demure enough, yet with covert glances of encouragement to the
  unemotional ambassador, and with subtle exhibitions of her charms.</p>

  <p>"Woman," said the messenger, "the greatest of kings desires you, will you
  come?"</p>

  <p>"Lord," said the girl, "I wish for nothing better." With that, the hundred
  armed warriors in attendance at the palaver closed round the girl.</p>

  <p>"And so," said Sanders, "you got nothing?"</p>

  <p>"Lord, it is as you say," moaned the old chief.</p>

  <p>"It is evident," said Sanders, "that an injustice has been done; for no
  man may take a woman unless he pay. I think," he added, with a flash of that
  mordant humour which occasionally illuminated his judgments, "that the man
  pays twice, once to the father, and all his life to his wife&mdash;but that
  is as may be."</p>

  <p>Six weeks later, after consultation, Sanders sent a messenger to the great
  king, demanding the price of the woman.</p>

  <p>What happened to the messenger I would rather not describe. That he was
  killed, is saying the least. Just before he died, when the glaze of death
  must have been on his eyes, and his poor wrecked body settling to the rest of
  oblivion, he was carried to a place before the king's hut, and Daihili danced
  the Dance of the Spirits. This much is now known.</p>

  <p>Sanders did nothing; nor did the British Government, but hurried notes
  were exchanged between ambassadors and ministers in Paris, and that was the
  end of the incident.</p>

  <p>Two Icheli spies went up into the great king's country. One came back
  saying that the dancing girl was the favourite wife of the old king, and that
  her whims swayed the destinies of the nation. Also he reported that because
  of this slim girl who danced, many men, councillors, and captains of war had
  died the death.</p>

  <p>The other spy did not come back.</p>

  <p>It may have been his discovery that induced the girl to send an army
  against the Icheli, thinking perchance that her people were spying upon
  her.</p>

  <p>One day the city of Icheli was surrounded by the soldiers of the great
  king, and neither man, women nor child escaped.</p>

  <p>The news of the massacre did not come to Sanders for a long time. The
  reason was simple; there was none to carry the message, for the Icheli are
  isolated folk.</p>

  <p>One day, however, an Isisi hunting party, searching for elephants, came
  upon a place where there was a smell of burning and many skeletons&mdash;and
  thus Sanders knew&mdash;"We cannot," wrote Monsieur Leon Marchassa, Minister
  for Colonial Affairs, "accept responsibility for the misdoings of the king of
  the Yitingi, and my Government would regard with sympathetic interest any
  attempt that was made by His Majesty's Government to pacify this country."
  But the British Government did nothing, because war is an expensive matter,
  and Sanders grinned and cursed his employers genially.</p>

  <p>Taking his life in his hands, he went up to the border of Yitingi, with
  twenty policemen, and sent a messenger&mdash;a Yitingi messenger&mdash;to the
  king. With the audacity which was not the least of his assets, he demanded
  that the king should come to him for a palaver.</p>

  <p>This adventure nearly proved abortive at the beginning, for just as the
  Zaire was steaming to the borders Sanders unexpectedly came upon traces of a
  raiding expedition. There were unmistakable signs as to the author.</p>

  <p>"I have a mind to turn back and punish that cursed Bosambo, Chief of the
  Ochori," he said to Sergeant Abiboo, "for having sworn by a variety of gods
  and devils that he would keep the peace; behold he has been raiding in
  foreign territory."</p>

  <p>"He will keep, master," said Abiboo, "besides which, he is in the
  neighbourhood, for his fires are still warm." So Sanders went on, and sent
  his message to the king.</p>

  <p>He kept steam in his little boat&mdash;he had chosen the only place where
  the river touches the Yitingi border&mdash;and waited, quite prepared to make
  an ignominious, if judicious, bolt.</p>

  <p>To his astonishment, his spies brought word that the king was coming. He
  owed this condescension to the influence of the little dancing girl, for she,
  woman-like, had a memory for rebuffs, and had a score to settle with Mr
  Commissioner Sanders.</p>

  <p>The great king arrived, and across the meadow-like lands that fringe the
  river on both sides Sanders watched the winding procession with mingled
  feelings. The king halted a hundred yards from the river, and his big scarlet
  umbrella was the centre of a black line of soldiers spreading out on either
  hand for three hundred yards.</p>

  <p>Then a party detached itself and came towards the dead tree by the water
  side, whereon hung limply in the still air the ensign of England.</p>

  <p>"This," said Sanders to himself, "is where I go dead one time." It is
  evidence of the seriousness of the situation, as it appealed to him, that he
  permitted himself to descend to Coast English.</p>

  <p>"The king, the Great One, awaits you, white man, offering you safety in
  his shadow," said the king's messenger; and Sanders nodded. He walked
  leisurely toward the massed troops, and presently appeared before the old man
  squatting on a heap of skins and blinking like an ape in the sunlight.</p>

  <p>"Lord king, live for ever," said Sanders glibly, and as he raised his hand
  in salute he saw the girl regarding him from under knit brows.</p>

  <p>"What is your wish, white man?" said the old king; "what rich presents do
  you bring, that you call me many days' journey?"</p>

  <p>"Lord, I bring no presents," said Sanders boldly; "but a message from a
  king who is greater than you, whose soldiers outnumber the sands of the
  river, and whose lands extend from the east to the west, from the north to
  the south."</p>

  <p>"There is no such king," snarled the old man. "You lie, white man, and I
  will cut your tongue into little strips."</p>

  <p>"Let him give his message, master," said the girl.</p>

  <p>"This is the message," said Sanders. He stood easily, with his hands in
  the pockets of his white uniform jacket, and the king was nearer death than
  he knew. "My master says: 'Because the Great King of Yitingi has eaten up the
  Icheli folk: because he has crossed the borderland and brought suffering to
  my people, my heart is sore. Yet, if the Great King will pay a fine of one
  thousand head of cattle and will allow free access to his country for my
  soldiers and my commissioners, I will live in peace with him.'"</p>

  <p>The old man laughed, a wicked, cackling laugh.</p>

  <p>"Oh, ko!" he chuckled; "a great king!" Then the girl stepped forward.</p>

  <p>"Sandi," she said, "once you put me to shame, for when I would have danced
  for you, you slept."</p>

  <p>"To you, Daihili," said Sanders steadily, "I say nothing; I make no
  palaver with women, for that is not the custom or the law. Still less do I
  talk with dancing girls. My business is with Limbili the king." The king was
  talking rapidly behind his hand to a man who bent over him, and Sanders, his
  hands still in his jacket pockets, snapped down the safety catches of his
  automatic Colts.</p>

  <p>All the time the girl spoke he was watching from the corners of his eyes
  the man who talked with the king. He saw him disappear in the crowd of
  soldiers who stood behind the squatting figures, and prepared for the
  worst.</p>

  <p>"Since I may not dance for you," the girl was saying, "my lord the king
  would have you dance for me."</p>

  <p>"That is folly; said Sanders: then he saw the line on either side wheel
  forward, and out came his pistols.</p>

  <p>"Crack! Crack!" The shot intended for the king missed him, and broke the
  leg of a soldier behind.</p>

  <p>It had been hopeless from the first; this Sanders realized with some
  philosophy, as he lay stretched on the baked earth, trussed like a fowl, and
  exceedingly uncomfortable. At the first shot Abiboo, obeying his
  instructions, would turn the bows of the steamer down stream; this was the
  only poor satisfaction he could derive from the situation.</p>

  <p>Throughout that long day, with a pitiless sun beating down upon him, he
  lay in the midst of an armed guard, waiting for the death which must come in
  some dreadful form or other.</p>

  <p>He was undismayed, for this was the logical end of the business. Toward
  the evening they gave him water, which was most acceptable. From the gossip
  of his guards he gathered that the evening had been chosen for his exit, but
  the manner of it he must guess.</p>

  <p>From where he lay he could see, by turning his head a little, the king's
  tent, and all the afternoon men were busily engaged in heaping fiat stones
  upon the earth before the pavilion. They were of singular uniformity, and
  would appear to be specially hewn and dressed for some purpose. He asked his
  guard a question.</p>

  <p>"They are the dancing stones, white man," said the soldier, "they come
  from the mountain near the city." When darkness fell a huge fire was lit; it
  was whilst he was watching this that he heard of the Zaire's escape, and was
  thankful.</p>

  <p>He must have been dozing, exhausted in body and mind, when he was dragged
  to his feet, his bonds were slipped, and he was led before the king. Then he
  saw what form his torture was to take.</p>

  <p>The flat stones were being taken from the fire with wooden pincers and
  laid to form a rough pavement before the tent.</p>

  <p>"White man," said the king, as rude hands pulled off the Commissioner's
  boots, "the woman Daihili would see you dance."</p>

  <p>"Be assured, king," said Sanders, between his teeth, "that some day you
  shall dance in hell in more pleasant company, having first danced at the end
  of a rope."</p>

  <p>"If you live through the dancing," said the king, "you will be sorry." A
  ring of soldiers with their spears pointing inward surrounded the pavement,
  those on the side of the tent crouching so that their bodies might not
  interrupt the Great One's view.</p>

  <p>"Dance," said the king; and Sanders was thrown forward. The first stone he
  touched was only just warm, and on this he stood still till a spear-thrust
  sent him to the next. It was smoking hot, and he leapt up with a stifled cry.
  Down he came to another, hotter still, and leapt again&mdash;"Throw water
  over him," said the amused king, when they dragged the fainting man off the
  stones, his clothes smouldering where he lay in an inert heap.</p>

  <p>"Now dance," said the king again&mdash;when out of the darkness about the
  group leapt a quivering pencil of yellow light.</p>

  <p>Ha-ha-ha-ha-a-a-a!</p>

  <p>Abiboo's Maxim-gun was in action at a range of fifty yards, and with him
  five hundred Ochori men under that chief of chiefs, Bosambo.</p>

  <p>For a moment the Yitingi stood, and then, as with a wild yell which was
  three parts fear, the Ochori charged, the king's soldiers broke and fled.</p>

  <p>They carried Sanders to the steamer quickly, for the Yitingi would
  re-form, being famous night fighters. Sanders, sitting on the deck of the
  steamer nursing his burnt feet and swearing gently, heard the scramble of the
  Ochori as they got into their canoes, heard the grunting of his Houssas
  hoisting the Maxim on board, and fainted again.</p>

  <p>"Master," said Bosambo in the morning, "many moons ago you made charge
  against the Ochori, saying they would not fight. That was true, but in those
  far-off days there was no chief Bosambo. Now, because of my teaching, and
  because I have put fire into their stomachs, they have defeated the soldiers
  of the Great King." He posed magnificently, for on his shoulders was a mantle
  of gold thread woven with blue, which was not his the night before.</p>

  <p>"Bosambo," said Sanders, "though I have a score to settle with you for
  breaking the law by raiding, I am grateful that the desire for the properties
  of others brought you to this neighbourhood. Where did you get that cloak?"
  he demanded.</p>

  <p>"I stole it," said Bosambo frankly, "from the tent of the Great King; also
  I brought with me one of the stones upon which my lord would not stand. I
  brought this, thinking that it would be evidence." Sanders nodded, and bit
  his cigar with a little grimace. "On which my lord would not stand," was very
  prettily put.</p>

  <p>"Let me see it," he said; and Bosambo himself carried it to him.</p>

  <p>It had borne the heat well enough, but rough handling had chipped a
  corner; and Sanders looked at this cracked corner long and earnestly.</p>

  <p>"Here," he said, "is an argument that no properly constituted British
  Government can overlook&mdash;I see Limbili's finish." The rainy season came
  round and the springtime, before Sanders again stood in the presence of the
  Great King. All around him was desolation and death. The plain was strewn
  with the bodies of men, and the big city was a smoking ruin. To the left,
  three regiments of Houssas were encamped; to the right, two battalions of
  African Rifles sat at "chop," and the snappy notes of their bugles came
  sharply through the still air.</p>

  <p>"I am an old man," mumbled the king; but the girl who crouched at his side
  said nothing. Only her eyes never left the brick-red face of Sanders.</p>

  <p>"Old you are," he said, "yet not too old to die."</p>

  <p>"I am a great king," whined the other, "and it is not proper that a great
  king should hang."</p>

  <p>"Yet if you live," said Sanders, "many other great kings will say, 'We may
  commit these abominations, and because of our greatness we shall live.'"</p>

  <p>"And what of me, lord?" said the girl in a low voice.</p>

  <p>"You!" Sanders looked at her. "Ho, hi," he said, as though he had just
  remembered her. "You are the dancing girl? Now we shall do nothing with you,
  Daihili&mdash;because you are nothing." He saw her shrink as one under a
  lash.</p>

  <p>After the execution, the Colonel of the Houssas and Sanders were talking
  together.</p>

  <p>"What I can't understand," said the Colonel, "is why we suddenly decided
  upon this expedition. It has been necessary for years&mdash;but why this
  sudden activity?"</p>

  <p>Sanders grinned mysteriously.</p>

  <p>"A wonderful people, the English," he said airily. "Old Man Limbili steals
  British subjects, and I report it. 'Very sad,' says England. He wipes out a
  nation. 'Deplorable!' says England. He makes me dance on the original
  good-intention stones of Hades. 'Treat it as a joke,' says England; but when
  I point out that these stones assay one ounce ten penny-weights of refined
  gold, and that we've happed upon the richest reef in Central Africa, there's
  an army here in six months!"</p>

  <p>I personally think that Sanders may have been a little unjust in this
  point of view. After all, wars cost money, and wars of vengeance are
  notoriously unprofitable.</p>

  <h3>First published as "The Forest of Happy Thoughts<br>
  in <i>The Pall Mall Magazine</i>, November 1909<br>
  Reprinted in <i>The Death Room: Strange and Startling Stories</i>, 1986</h3>

  <p class="first">SANDERS was tied up at a "wooding," being on his way to
  collect taxes and administer justice to the folk who dwell on the lower Isisi
  River.</p>

  <p>By the river-side the little steamer was moored. There was a tiny bay
  here, and the swift currents of the river were broken to a gentle flow; none
  the less, he inspected the shore-ends of the wire hawsers before he crossed
  the narrow plank that led to the deck of the Zaire. The wood was stacked on
  the deck ready for tomorrow's run. The new water-gauge had been put in by
  Yoka, the engineer, as he had ordered; the engines had been cleaned; and
  Sanders nodded approvingly. He stepped lightly over two or three sleeping
  forms curled upon the deck, and gained the shore. "Now I think I'll turn in,"
  he muttered, and looked at his watch. It was nine o'clock. He stood for a
  moment on the crest of the steep bank, and stared back across the river. The
  night was black, but he saw the outlines of the forest on the other side. He
  saw the jewelled sky, and the pale reflection of stars in the water.</p>

  <p>Then he went to his tent, and leisurely got into his pyjamas. He jerked
  two tabloids from a tiny bottle, swallowed them, drank a glass of water, and
  thrust his head through the tent opening. "Ho, Sokani!" he called, speaking
  in the vernacular, "let the lo-koli sound!" He went to bed.</p>

  <p>He heard the rustle of men moving, the gurgles of laughter as his subtle
  joke was repeated, for the Cambul people have a keen sense of humour, and
  then the penetrating rattle of sticks on the native drum&mdash;a hollow
  tree-trunk. Fiercely it beat&mdash;furiously, breathlessly, with now and then
  a deeper note as the drummer, using all his art, sent the message of sleep to
  the camp.</p>

  <p>In one wild crescendo, the lo-koli ceased, and Sanders turned with a sigh
  of content and closed his eyes&mdash;he sat up suddenly. He must have dozed;
  but he was wide awake now.</p>

  <p>He listened, then slipped out of bed, pulling on his mosquito boots. Into
  the darkness of the night he stepped, and found N'Kema, the engineer,
  waiting.</p>

  <p>"You heard, master?" said the native.</p>

  <p>"I heard," said Sanders, with a puzzled face, "yet we are nowhere near a
  village." He listened.</p>

  <p>From the night came a hundred whispering noises, but above all these,
  unmistakable, the faint clatter of an answering drum. The white man frowned
  in his perplexity. "No village is nearer than the Bongindanga," he muttered,
  "not even a fishing village; the woods are deserted&mdash;" The native held
  up a warning finger, and bent his head, listening. He was reading the message
  that the drum sent. Sanders waited; he knew the wonderful fact of this native
  telegraph, how it sent news through the trackless wilds. He could not
  understand it, no European could; but he had respect for its mystery.</p>

  <p>"A white man is here," read the native; "he has the sickness."</p>

  <p>"A white man!" In the darkness Sanders' eyebrows rose incredulously.</p>

  <p>"He is a foolish one," N'Kema read; "he sits in the Forest of Happy
  Thoughts, and will not move."</p>

  <p>Sanders clicked his lips impatiently. "No white man would sit in the
  Forest of Happy Thoughts," he said, half to himself, "unless he were mad."
  But the distant drum monotonously repeated the outrageous news. Here, indeed,
  in the heart of the loveliest glade in all Africa, encamped in the very
  centre of the Green Path of Death, was a white man, a sick white man&mdash;in
  the Forest of Happy Thoughts&mdash;a sick white man.</p>

  <p>So the drum went on and on, till Sanders, rousing his own lo-koli man,
  sent an answer crashing along the river, and began to dress hurriedly.</p>

  <p>In the forest lay a very sick man. He had chosen the site for the camp
  himself. It was in a clearing, near a little creek that wound between high
  elephant-grass to the river. Mainward chose it, just before the sickness
  came, because it was pretty.</p>

  <p>This was altogether an inadequate reason; but Mainward was a
  sentimentalist, and his life was a long record of choosing pretty camping
  places, irrespective of danger.</p>

  <p>"He was," said a newspaper, commenting on the crowning disaster which sent
  him a fugitive from justice to the wild lands of Africa, "overburdened with
  imagination."</p>

  <p>Mainward was cursed with ill-timed confidence; this was one of the reasons
  he chose to linger in that deadly strip of land of the Ituri, which is
  clumsily named by the natives 'The
  Lands-where-all-bad-thoughts-become-good-thoughts' and poetically adapted by
  explorers and daring traders as 'The Forest of Happy Dreams.' Overconfidence
  had generally been Mainward's undoing&mdash;over-confidence in the ability of
  his horses to win races; over-confidence in his own ability to secure money
  to hide his defalcations&mdash;he was a director in the Welshire County Bank
  once&mdash;over-confidence in securing the love of a woman, who, when the
  crash came, looked at him blankly and said she was sorry, but she had no idea
  he felt towards her like that&mdash;Now Mainward lifted his aching head from
  the pillow and cursed aloud at the din. He was endowed with the smattering of
  pigeon-English which a man may acquire from a three months' sojourn divided
  between Sierra Leone and Grand Bassam.</p>

  <p>"Why for they make 'em cursed noise, eh?" he fretted. "You plenty
  fool-man, Abiboo."</p>

  <p>"Si, senor," agreed the Kano boy, calmly.</p>

  <p>"Stop it, d'ye hear? stop it!" raved the man on the tumbled bed; "this
  noise is driving me mad&mdash;tell them to stop the drum." The lo-koli
  stopped of its own accord, for the listeners in the sick man's camp had heard
  the faint answer from Sanders.</p>

  <p>"Come here, Abiboo&mdash;I want some milk; open a fresh tin; and tell the
  cook I want some soup, too." The servant left him muttering and tossing from
  side to side on the creaking camp bedstead. Mainward had many strange things
  to think about. It was strange how they all clamoured for immediate
  attention; strange how they elbowed and fought one another in their noisy
  claims to his notice. Of course, there was the bankruptcy and the discovery
  at the bank&mdash;it was very decent of that inspector fellow to clear
  out&mdash;and Ethel, and the horses, and&mdash;and&mdash;The Valley of Happy
  Dreams! That would make a good story if Mainward could write; only,
  unfortunately, he could not write. He could sign things, sign his name to
  'three months after date pay to the order of&mdash;' He could sign other
  people's names; he groaned, and winced at the thought.</p>

  <p>But here was a forest where bad thoughts became good, and, God knows, his
  mind was ill-furnished. He wanted peace and sleep and happiness&mdash;he
  greatly desired happiness. Now suppose 'Fairy Lane' had won the Wokingham
  Stakes? It had not, of course (he winced again at the bad memory), but
  suppose it had?</p>

  <p>Suppose he could have found a friend who would have lent him £16,000, or
  even if Ethel&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Master," said Abiboo's voice, "dem puck-a-puck, him lib for come."</p>

  <p>"Eh, what's that?" Mainward turned almost savagely on the man.</p>

  <p>"Puck-a-puck&mdash;you hear 'um?" But the sick man could not hear the
  smack of the Zaire's stern wheel, as the little boat breasted the downward
  rush of the river&mdash;he was surprised to see that it was dawn, and
  grudgingly admitted to himself that he had slept. He closed his eyes again
  and had a strange dream. The principal figure was a small, tanned,
  clean-shaven man in a white helmet, who wore a dingy yellow overcoat over his
  pyjamas.</p>

  <p>"How are you feeling?" said the stranger.</p>

  <p>"Rotten bad," growled Mainward, "especially about Ethel; don't you think
  it was pretty low down of her to lead me on to believe she was awfully fond
  of me, and then at the last minute to chuck me?"</p>

  <p>"Shocking," said the strange, white man gravely, "but put her out of your
  mind just now; she isn't worth troubling about. What do you say to this?" He
  held up a small, greenish pellet between his forefinger and thumb, and
  Mainward laughed weakly.</p>

  <p>"Oh, rot!" he chuckled faintly. "You're one of those Forest of Happy
  Dreams Johnnies; what's that? A love philtre?" He was hysterically amused at
  the witticism.</p>

  <p>Sanders nodded.</p>

  <p>"Love or life, It's all one," he said, but apparently unamused. "Swallow
  it!" Mainward giggled and obeyed. "And now," said the stranger&mdash;this was
  six hours later&mdash;"the best thing you can do is to let my boys put you on
  my steamer and take you down river."</p>

  <p>Mainward shook his head. He had awakened irritable and lamentably
  weak.</p>

  <p>"My dear chap, it's awfully kind of you to have come&mdash;by the way, I
  suppose you are a doctor?"</p>

  <p>Sanders shook his head. "On the contrary, I am the Commissioner of this
  district," he said flippantly&mdash;"but you were saying&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I want to stay here&mdash;It's devilish pretty."</p>

  <p>"Devilish is the very adjective I should have used&mdash;my dear man, this
  is the plague spot of the Congo; It's the home of every death-dealing fly and
  bug in Africa." He waved his hand to the hidden vistas of fresh green glades,
  of gorgeous creepers shown in the light of the camp fires.</p>

  <p>"Look at the grass," he said; "It's homeland grass&mdash;that's the
  seductive part of it; I nearly camped here myself. Come, my friend, let me
  take you to my camp." Mainward shook his head obstinately.</p>

  <p>"I'm obliged, but I'll stay here for a day or so. I want to try the
  supernatural effects of this pleasant place," he said with a weary smile.
  "I've got so many thoughts that need treatment."</p>

  <p>"Look here," said Sanders roughly, "you know jolly well how this forest
  got its name; it is called Happy Dreams because it's impregnated with fever,
  and with every disease from beri-beri to sleeping sickness. You don't wake
  from the dreams you dream here. Man, I know this country, and you're a
  newcomer; you've trekked here because you wanted to get away from life and
  start all over again."</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon." Mainward's face flushed; and he spoke a little
  stiffly.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I know all about you&mdash;didn't I tell you I was the Commissioner?
  I was in England when things were going rocky with you, and I've read the
  rest in the papers I get from time to time. But all that is nothing to me.
  I'm here to help you start fair. If you had wanted to commit suicide, why
  come to Africa to do it? Be sensible and shift your camp; I'll send my
  steamer back for your men. Will you come?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Mainward sulkily. "I don't want to, I'm not keen; besides, I'm
  not fit to travel." Here was an argument which Sanders could not answer. He
  was none too sure upon that point himself, and he hesitated before he spoke
  again.</p>

  <p>"Very well," he said at length, "suppose you stay another day to give you
  a chance to pull yourself together. I'll come along tomorrow with a tip-top
  invalid chair for you&mdash;is it a bet?"</p>

  <p>Mainward held out his shaking hand, and the ghost of a smile puckered the
  corners of his eyes. "It's a bet," he said.</p>

  <p>He watched the Commissioner walk through the camp, speaking to one man
  after another in a strange tongue. A singular, masterful man this, thought
  Mainward. Would he have mastered Ethel? He watched the stranger with curious
  eyes, and noted how his own lazy devils of carriers jumped at his word.</p>

  <p>"Good-night," said Sanders' voice; and Mainward looked up. "You must take
  another of these pellets, and tomorrow you'll be as fit as a donkey-engine.
  I've got to get back to my camp tonight, or I shall find half my stores
  stolen in the morning; but if you'd rather I stopped&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No, no," replied the other hastily. He wanted to be alone. He had lots of
  matters to settle with himself. There was the question of Ethel, for
  instance.</p>

  <p>"You won't forget to take the tabloid?"</p>

  <p>"No. I say, I'm awfully obliged to you for coming. You've been a good
  white citizen."</p>

  <p>Sanders smiled. "Don't talk nonsense!" he said good-humouredly. "This is
  all brotherly love. White to white, and kin to kin, don't you know? We're all
  alone here, and there isn't a man of our colour within five hundred miles.
  Good-night, and please take the tabloid&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Mainward lay listening to the noise of departure. He thought he heard a
  little bell tingle. That must be for the engines. Then he heard the
  puck-a-puck of the wheel&mdash;so that was how the steamer got its name.</p>

  <p>Abiboo came with some milk. "You take um medicine, master?" he
  inquired.</p>

  <p>"I take um," murmured Mainward; but the green tabloid was underneath his
  pillow.</p>

  <p>Then there began to steal over him a curious sensation of content. He did
  not analyse it down to its first cause. He had had sufficient introspective
  exercise for one day. It came to him as a pleasant shock to realize that he
  was happy.</p>

  <p>He opened his eyes and looked round. His bed was laid in the open, and he
  drew aside the curtains of his net to get a better view.</p>

  <p>A little man was walking briskly toward him along the velvet stretch of
  grass that sloped down from the glade, and Mainward whistled.</p>

  <p>"Atty," he gasped. "By all that's wonderful." Atty, indeed, it was: the
  same wizened Atty as of yore; but no longer pulling the long face to which
  Mainward had been accustomed. The little man was in his white
  riding-breeches, his diminutive top-boots were splashed with mud, and on the
  crimson of his silk jacket there was evidence of a hard race. He touched his
  cap jerkily with his whip, and shifted the burden of the racing saddle he
  carried to the other arm.</p>

  <p>"Why, Atty," said Mainward, with a smile, "what on earth are you doing
  here?"</p>

  <p>"It's a short way to the jockeys' room, sir." said the little man. "I've
  just weighed in. I thought the Fairy would do it, sir, and she did."</p>

  <p>Mainward nodded wisely. "I knew she would, too." he said. "Did she give
  you a smooth ride?"</p>

  <p>The jockey grinned again. "She never does that," he said. "But she ran
  gamely enough. Coming up out of the Dip, she hung a little, but I showed her
  the whip, and she came on as straight as a die. I thought once the Stalk
  would beat us&mdash;I got shut in, but I pulled her round, and we were never
  in difficulties. I could have won by ten lengths," said Atty.</p>

  <p>"You could have won by ten lengths," repeated Mainward in wonder. "Well,
  you've done me a good turn, Atty. This win will get me out of one of the
  biggest holes that ever a reckless man tumbled into&mdash;I shall not forget
  you, Atty."</p>

  <p>"I'm sure you won't, sir," said the little jockey gratefully; "if you'll
  excuse me now, sir&mdash;" Mainward nodded and watched him, as he moved
  quickly through the trees.</p>

  <p>There were several people in the glade now, and Mainward looked down
  ruefully at his soiled duck suit. "What an ass I was to come like this," he
  muttered in his annoyance. "I might have known that I should have met all
  these people." There was one he did not wish to see; and as soon as he
  sighted Venn, with his shy eyes and his big nose, Mainward endeavoured to
  slip back out of observation.</p>

  <p>But Venn saw him, and came tumbling through the trees, with his big,
  flabby hand extended and his dull eyes aglow.</p>

  <p>"Hullo, hullo!" he grinned, "been looking for you." Mainward muttered some
  inconsequent reply. "Rum place to find you, eh?" Venn removed his shining
  silk hat and mopped his brow with an awesome silk handkerchief.</p>

  <p>"But look here, old feller&mdash;about that money?"</p>

  <p>"Don't worry, my dear man," Mainward interposed easily. "I shall pay you
  now."</p>

  <p>"That ain't what I mean," said the other impetuously; "a few hundred more
  or less does not count. But you wanted a big sum&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And you told me you'd see me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I know, I know," Venn put in hastily; "but that was before Kaffirs
  started jumpin'. Old feller, you can have it!" He said this with grotesque
  emphasis, standing with his legs wide apart, his hat perched on the back of
  his head, his plump hands dramatically outstretched: and Mainward laughed
  outright.</p>

  <p>"Sixteen thousand?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Or twenty," said the other impressively. "I want to show you&mdash;"
  Somebody called him, and with a hurried apology he went blundering up the
  green slope, stopping and turning back to indulge in a little dumb show
  illustrative of his confidence in Mainward and his willingness to oblige.</p>

  <p>Mainward was laughing, a low, gurgling laugh of pure enjoyment. Venn, of
  all people! Venn, with his accursed questions and talk of securities. Well!
  Well!</p>

  <p>Then his merriment ceased, and he winced again, and his heart beat faster
  and faster, and a curious weakness came over him&mdash;How splendidly cool
  she looked.</p>

  <p>She walked in the clearing, a white, slim figure; he heard the swish of
  her skirt as she came through the long grass&mdash;white, with a green belt
  all encrusted with gold embroidery. He took in every detail
  hungrily&mdash;the dangling gold ornaments that hung from her belt, the lace
  collar at her throat, the&mdash;She did not hurry to him, that was not her
  way.</p>

  <p>But in her eyes dawned a gradual tenderness&mdash;those dear eyes that
  dropped before him shyly.</p>

  <p>"Ethel!" he whispered, and dared to take her hand.</p>

  <p>"Aren't you wonderfully surprised?" she said.</p>

  <p>"Ethel! Here!"</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I had to come." She would not look at him, but he saw the pink in
  her cheek and heard the faltering voice with a wild hope. "I behaved so
  badly, dear&mdash;so very badly." She hung her head.</p>

  <p>"Dear! dear!" he muttered, and groped toward her like a blind man.</p>

  <p>She was in his arms, crushed against his breast, the perfume of her
  presence in his brain.</p>

  <p>"I had to come to you." Her hot cheek was against his. "I love you
  so."</p>

  <p>"Me&mdash;love me? Do you mean it?" He was tremulous with happiness, and
  his voice broke&mdash;"Dearest." Her face was upturned to his, her lips so
  near; he felt her heart beating as furiously as his own. He kissed
  her&mdash;her lips, her eyes, her dear hair&mdash;"O, God, I'm happy!" she
  sobbed, "so&mdash;so happy&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Sanders sprang ashore just as the sun was rising, and came thoughtfully
  through the undergrowth to the camp. Abiboo, squatting by the curtained bed,
  did not rise.</p>

  <p>Sanders walked to the bed, pulled aside the mosquito netting, and bent
  over the man who lay there.</p>

  <p>Then he drew the curtains again, lit his pipe slowly, and looked down at
  Abiboo.</p>

  <p>"When did he die?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"In the dark of the morning, master," said the man.</p>

  <p>Sanders nodded slowly. "Why did you not send for me?" For a moment the
  squatting figure made no reply, then he rose and stretched himself.</p>

  <p>"Master," he said, speaking in Arabic&mdash;which is a language which
  allows of nice distinctions&mdash;'this man was happy; he walked in the
  Forest of Happy Thoughts; why should I call him back to a land where there
  was neither sunshine nor happiness, but only night and pain and
  sickness?"</p>

  <p>"You're a philosopher," said Sanders irritably.</p>

  <p>"I am a follower of the Prophet," said Abiboo, the Kano boy; "and all
  things are according to God's wisdom."</p>

     name="chap08">VIII. &mdash; THE AKASAVAS</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Weekly Tale-Teller</i>, May 20, 1910</h3>

  <p class="first">YOU who do not understand how out of good evil may arise
  must take your spade to some virgin grassland, untouched&mdash;by the hand of
  man from the beginning of time.</p>

  <p>Here is soft, sweet grass, and never a sign of nettle, or rank, evil weed.
  It is as God made it. Turn the soil with your spade, intent on improving His
  handiwork, and next season&mdash;weeds, nettles, lank creeping things, and
  coarse-leafed vegetation cover the ground.</p>

  <p>Your spade has aroused to life the dormant seeds of evil, germinated the
  ugly waste life that all these long years has been sleeping out of
  sight&mdash;in twenty years, with careful cultivation, you may fight down the
  weeds and restore the grassland, but it takes a lot of doing.</p>

  <p>Your intentions may have been the best in disturbing the primal sod; you
  may have had views of roses flourishing where grass was; the result is very
  much the same.</p>

  <p>I apply this parable to the story of a missionary and his work. The
  missionary was a good man, though of the wrong colour. He had large ideas on
  his duty to his fellows; he was inspired by the work of his cloth in another
  country; but, as Sanders properly said, India is not Africa.</p>

  <p>Kenneth McDolan came to Mr Commissioner Sanders with a letter of
  introduction from the new Administration.</p>

  <p>Sanders was at "chop" one blazing morning when his servant, who was also
  his sergeant, Abiboo, brought a card to him. It was a nice card, rounded at
  the corners, and gilt-edged, and in the centre, in old English type, was the
  inscription&mdash;REV. KENNETH McDOLAN.</p>

  <p>Underneath was scribbled in pencil: "On a brief visit." Sanders sniffed
  impatiently, for 'reverend' meant 'missionary,' and 'missionary' might mean
  anything. He looked at the card again and frowned in his perplexity. Somehow
  the old English and the reverendness of the visiting card did not go well
  with the rounded corners and the gilt edge.</p>

  <p>"Where is he?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"Master," said Abiboo, "he is on the verandah. Shall I kick him off?"
  Abiboo said this very naturally and with simple directness, and Sanders
  stared at him.</p>

  <p>"Son of sin!" he said sternly, "is it thus you speak of God-men, and of
  white men at that?"</p>

  <p>"This man wears the clothes of a God-man," said Abiboo serenely; "but he
  is a black man, therefore of no consequence."</p>

  <p>Sanders pulled a pair of mosquito boots over his pyjamas and swore to
  himself.</p>

  <p>"White missionaries, yes," he said wrathfully, "but black missionaries I
  will not endure."</p>

  <p>The Reverend Kenneth was sitting in Sanders' basket-chair, one leg flung
  negligently over one side of the chair to display a silk sock. His
  finger-tips were touching, and he was gazing with good-natured tolerance at
  the little green garden which was the Commissioner's special delight.</p>

  <p>He was black, very black; but his manners were easy, and his bearing self
  possessed.</p>

  <p>He nodded smilingly to Sanders and extended a lazy hand.</p>

  <p>"Ah, Mr Commissioner," he said in faultless English, "I have heard a great
  deal about you."</p>

  <p>"Get out of that chair," said Sanders, who had no small talk worth
  mentioning, "and stand up when I come out to you! What do you want?" The
  Reverend Kenneth rose quickly, and accepted the situation with a rapidity
  which will be incomprehensible to any who do not know how thumbnail deep is
  the cultivation of the cultured savage.</p>

  <p>"I am on a brief visit," he said, a note of deference in his tone. "I am
  taking the small towns and villages along the coast, holding services, and I
  desire permission to speak to your people." This was not the speech he had
  prepared. He had come straight from England, where he had been something of a
  lion in Bayswater society, and where, too, his theological attainments had
  won him regard and no small amount of fame in even a wider circle.</p>

  <p>"You may speak to my people," said Sanders; "but you may not address the
  Kano folk nor the Houssas, because they are petrified in the faith of the
  Prophet."</p>

  <p>Regaining his self-possession, the missionary smiled. "To bring light into
  dark places&mdash;" he began.</p>

  <p>"Cut it out," said Sanders briefly; "the palaver is finished." He turned
  on his heel and re-entered the bungalow.</p>

  <p>Then a thought struck him.</p>

  <p>"Hi!" he shouted, and the retiring missionary turned back.</p>

  <p>"Where did you pick up the 'Kenneth McDolan'?" he asked.</p>

  <p>The negro smiled again. "It is the patronymic bestowed upon me at Sierra
  Leone by a good Christian white man, who brought me up and educated me as
  though I were his own son," he recited.</p>

  <p>Sanders showed his teeth. "I have heard of such cases." he said
  unpleasantly.</p>

  <p>The next day the missionary announced his intention of proceeding up
  country. He came in to see Sanders as though nothing had happened. Perhaps he
  expected to find the Commissioner a little ashamed of himself; but if this
  was so he was disappointed, for Sanders was blatantly unrepentant.</p>

  <p>"You've got a letter from the Administration," he said, "so I can't stop
  you."</p>

  <p>"There is work for me," said the missionary, "work of succour and relief.
  In India some four hundred thousand&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"This is not India," said Sanders shortly; and with no other word the
  native preacher went his way.</p>

  <p>Those who know the Akasava people best know them for their
  laziness&mdash;save in matter of vendetta, or in the settlement of such blood
  feuds as come their way, or in the lifting of each other's goats, in all
  which matters they display an energy and an agility truly inexplicable. "He
  is an Akasava man&mdash;he points with his foot," is a proverb of the Upper
  River, and the origin of the saying goes back to a misty time when (as the
  legend goes) a stranger happened upon a man of the tribe lying in the
  forest.</p>

  <p>"Friend," said the stranger, "I am lost. Show me the way to the river";
  and the Akasava warrior, raising a leg from the ground, pointed with his toe
  to the path.</p>

  <p>Though this legend lacks something in point of humour, it is regarded as
  the acme of mirth-provoking stories from Barna to the Lado country.</p>

  <p>It was six months after the Reverend Kenneth McDolan had left for his
  station that there came to Sanders at his headquarters a woeful deputation,
  arriving in two canoes in the middle of the night, and awaiting him when he
  came from his bath to the broad stoep of his house in the morning&mdash;a
  semi-circle of chastened and gloomy men, who squatted on the wooden stoep,
  regarding him with the utmost misery.</p>

  <p>"Lord, we are of the Akasava people," said the spokesman, "and we have
  come a long journey."</p>

  <p>"So I am aware," said Sanders, with arid dryness, "unless the Akasava
  country has shifted its position in the night. What do you seek?"</p>

  <p>"Master, we are starving." said the speaker, "for our crops have failed,
  and there is no fish in the river; therefore we have come to you, who are our
  father."</p>

  <p>Now this was a most unusual request; for the Central African native does
  not easily starve, and, moreover, there had come no news of crop failure from
  the Upper River.</p>

  <p>"All this sounds like a lie," said Sanders thoughtfully, "for how may a
  crop fail in the Akasava country, yet be more than sufficient in Isisi?
  Moreover, fish do not leave their playground without cause, and if they do
  they may be followed."</p>

  <p>The spokesman shifted uneasily.</p>

  <p>"Master, we have had much sickness," he said, "and whilst we cared for one
  another the planting season had passed; and, as for the fish, our young men
  were too full of sorrow for their dead to go long journeys." Sanders stared.
  "Therefore we have come from our chief asking you to save us, for we are
  starving."</p>

  <p>The man spoke with some confidence, and this was the most surprising thing
  of all. Sanders was nonplussed, frankly confounded. For all the eccentric
  course his daily life took, there was a certain regularity even in its
  irregularity. But here was a new and unfamiliar situation. Such things mean
  trouble, and he was about to probe this matter to its depth.</p>

  <p>"I have nothing to give you," he said, "save this advice&mdash;that you
  return swiftly to where you came from and carry my word to your chief. Later
  I will come and make inquiries."</p>

  <p>The men were not satisfied, and an elder, wrinkled with age, and
  sooty-grey of head, spoke up. "It is said, master," he mumbled, through his
  toothless jaws, "that in other lands when men starve there come many white
  men bringing grain and comfort."</p>

  <p>"Eh?" Sanders' eyes narrowed. "Wait," he said, and walked quickly through
  the open door of his bungalow.</p>

  <p>When he came out he carried a pliant whip of rhinoceros-hide, and the
  deputation, losing its serenity, fled precipitately.</p>

  <p>Sanders watched the two canoes paddling frantically up stream, and the
  smile was without any considerable sign of amusement. That same night the
  Zaire left for the Akasava country, carrying a letter to the Reverend Kenneth
  McDolan, which was brief, but unmistakable in its tenor.</p>

  <p>"DEAR SIR,"&mdash;it ran&mdash;"You will accompany the bearer to
  headquarters, together with your belongings. In the event of your refusing to
  comply with this request, I have instructed my sergeant to arrest you. Yours
  faithfully, H. SANDERS, Commissioner."</p>

  <p>"And the reason I am sending you out of this country," said Sanders, "is
  because you have put funny ideas into the heads of my people."</p>

  <p>"I assure you&mdash;" began the negro.</p>

  <p>"I don't want your assurance," said Sanders, "you are not going to work an
  Indian Famine Fund in Central Africa."</p>

  <p>"The people were starving&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Sanders smiled.</p>

  <p>"I have sent word to them that I am coming to Akasava," he said grimly,
  "and that I will take the first starved-looking man I see and beat him till
  he is sore."</p>

  <p>The next day the missionary went, to the intense relief, be it said, of
  the many white missionaries scattered up and down the river; for, strange as
  it may appear, a negro preacher who wears a black coat and silk socks is
  regarded with a certain amount of suspicion. True to his promise, Sanders
  made his visit, but found none to thrash, for he came to a singularly
  well-fed community that had spent a whole week in digging out of the secret
  hiding-places the foodstuffs which, at the suggestion of a too zealous seeker
  after fame, it had concealed.</p>

  <p>"Here," said Sanders, wickedly, "endeth the first lesson."</p>

  <p>But he was far from happy. It is a remarkable fact that once you interfere
  with the smooth current of native life all manner of things happen. It cannot
  be truthfully said that the events that followed on the retirement from
  active life of the Reverend Kenneth McDolan were immediately traceable to his
  ingenious attempt to engineer a famine in Akasava. But he had sown a seed,
  the seed of an idea that somebody was responsible for their
  well-being&mdash;he had set up a beautiful idol of Pauperism, a new and
  wonderful fetish. In the short time of his stay he had instilled into the
  heathen mind the dim, vague, and elusive idea of the Brotherhood of Man.</p>

  <p>This Sanders discovered, when, returning from his visit of inspection, he
  met, drifting with the stream, a canoe in which lay a prone man, lazily
  setting his course with half-hearted paddle strokes.</p>

  <p>Sanders, on the bridge of his tiny steamer, pulled the little string that
  controlled the steam whistle, for the canoe lay in his track. Despite the
  warning, the man in the canoe made no effort to get out of his way, and since
  both were going with the current, it was only by putting the wheel over and
  scraping a sandbank that the steamer missed sinking the smaller craft.</p>

  <p>"Bring that man on board!" fumed Sanders, and when the canoe had been
  unceremoniously hauled to the Zaire's side by a boat-hook, and the occupant
  rudely pulled on board, Sanders let himself go.</p>

  <p>"By your infernal laziness," he said, "I see that you are of the Akasava
  people; yet that is no reason why you should take the middle of the channel
  to yourself."</p>

  <p>"Lord, it is written in the books of your gods," said the man, "that the
  river is for us all, black and white, each being equal in the eyes of the
  white gods."</p>

  <p>Sanders checked his lips impatiently. "When you and I are dead," he said,
  "we shall be equal, but since I am quick and you are quick, I shall give you
  ten strokes with a whip to correct the evil teaching that is within you." He
  made a convert. But the mischief was done.</p>

  <p>Sanders knew the native mind much better than any man living, and he spent
  a certain period every day for the next month cursing the Reverend Kenneth
  McDolan.</p>

  <p>So far, however, no irreparable mischief had been done, but Sanders was
  not the kind of man to be caught napping. Into the farthermost corners of his
  little kingdom his secret-service men were dispatched, and Sanders sat down
  to await developments.</p>

  <p>At first the news was good: the spies sent back stories of peace, of
  normal happiness; then the reports became less satisfactory. The Akasava
  country is unfortunately placed, for it is the very centre territory, the
  ideal position for the dissemination of foolish propaganda, as Sanders had
  discovered before.</p>

  <p>The stories the spies sent or brought were of secret meetings, of envoys
  from tribe to tribe, envoys that stole out from villages by dead of night, of
  curious rites performed in the depth of the forest and other disturbing
  matters.</p>

  <p>Then came a climax.</p>

  <p>Tigili, the king of the N'Gombi folk, made preparations for a secret
  journey. He sacrificed a goat and secured good omens; likewise three
  witch-doctors in solemn conclave gave a favourable prophecy.</p>

  <p>The chief slipped down the river one night with fourteen paddlers, a
  drummer, his chief headsman, and two of his wives, and reached the Akasava
  city at sunset the next evening. Here the chief of the Akasava met him, and
  led him to his hut.</p>

  <p>"Brother," said the Akasava chief, not without a touch of pompousness, "I
  have covered my bow with the skin of a monkey." Tigili nodded gravely.</p>

  <p>"My arrows are winged with the little clouds," he said in reply.</p>

  <p>In this cryptic fashion they spoke for the greater part of an hour, and
  derived much profit therefrom.</p>

  <p>In the shadow of the hut without lay a half-naked man, who seemed to
  sleep, his head upon his arm, his legs doubled up comfortably.</p>

  <p>One of the Akasava guard saw him, and sought to arouse him with the butt
  of his spear, but he only stirred sleepily, and, thinking that he must be a
  man of Tigili's retinue, they left him.</p>

  <p>When the king and the chief had finished their palaver, Tigili rose from
  the floor of the hut and went back to his canoe, and the chief of the Akasava
  stood on the bank of the river watching the craft as it went back the way it
  had come.</p>

  <p>The sleeper rose noiselessly and took another path to the river. Just
  outside the town he had to cross a path of moonlit clearing, and a man
  challenged him.</p>

  <p>This man was an Akasava warrior, and was armed, and the sleeper stood
  obedient to the summons.</p>

  <p>"Who are you?"</p>

  <p>"I am a stranger," said the man.</p>

  <p>The warrior came nearer and looked in his face.</p>

  <p>"You are a spy of Sandi," he said, and then the other closed with him.</p>

  <p>The warrior would have shouted, but a hand like steel was on his throat.
  The sentinel made a little sound like the noise a small river makes when it
  crosses a shallow bed of shingle, then his legs bent limply, and he went
  down.</p>

  <p>The sleeper bent down over him, wiped his knife on the bare shoulder of
  the dead man, and went on his way to the river. Under the bush he found a
  canoe, untied the native rope hat fastened it, and stepping in, he sent the
  tiny dug-out down the stream.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">"And what do you make of all this?" asked Sanders. He was
  standing on his broad stoep, and before him was the spy, a lithe young man,
  in the uniform of a sergeant of Houssa Police.</p>

  <p>"Master, it is the secret society, and they go to make a great killing,"
  said the sergeant.</p>

  <p>The Commissioner paced the verandah with his head upon his breast, his
  hands clasped behind his back.</p>

  <p>These secret societies he knew well enough, though his territories had
  been free of them. He knew their mushroom growth; how they rose from
  nothingness with rituals and practices ready-made. He knew their influence up
  and down the Liberian coast; he had some knowledge of the 'silent ones' of
  Nigeria, and had met the 'white faces' in the Kassai. And now the curse had
  come to his territory. It meant war, the upsetting of twenty years'
  work&mdash;the work of men who died and died joyfully, in the faith that they
  had brought peace to the land&mdash;it meant the undermining of all his
  authority.</p>

  <p>He turned to Abiboo.</p>

  <p>"Take the steamer," he said, "and go quickly to the Ochori country,
  telling Bosambo, the chief, that I will come to him&mdash;the palaver is
  finished." He knew he could depend upon Bosambo if the worst came.</p>

  <p>In the days of waiting he sent a long message to the Administration, which
  lived in ease a hundred miles down the coast. He had a land wire running
  along the seashore, and when it worked it was a great blessing. Fortunately
  it was in good order now, but there had been times when wandering droves of
  elephants had pulled up the poles and twisted a mile or so of wire into a
  hopeless tangle.</p>

  <p>The reply to his message came quickly.</p>

  <p>"Take extreme steps to wipe out society. If necessary arrest Tigili. I
  will support you with four hundred men and a gunboat; prefer you should
  arrange the matter without fuss. ADMINISTRATION."</p>

  <p>Sanders took a long walk by the sea to think out the situation and the
  solution. If the people were preparing for war, there would be simultaneous
  action, a general rising. He shook his head. Four hundred men and a gunboat
  more or less would make no difference. There was a hope that one tribe would
  rise before the other? he could deal with the Akasava; he could deal with the
  Isisi plus the Akasava; he was sure of the Ochori&mdash;that was a
  comfort&mdash;but the others? He shook his head again. Perhaps the inherent
  idleness of the Akasava would keep them back. Such a possibility was against
  their traditions.</p>

  <p>He must have come upon a solution suddenly, for he stopped dead in his
  walk, and stood still, thinking profoundly, with his head upon his breast.
  Then he turned and walked quickly back to his bungalow.</p>

  <p>What date had been chosen for the rising we may never know for certain.
  What is known is that the Akasava, the N'Gombi, the Isisi, and the Boleki
  folk were preparing in secret for a time of killing, when there came the
  great news.</p>

  <p>Sandi was dead.</p>

  <p>A canoe had overturned on the Isisi River, and the swift current had swept
  the Commissioner away, and though men ran up and down the bank no other sign
  of him was visible but a great white helmet that floated, turning slowly, out
  of sight.</p>

  <p>So a man of the Akasava reported, having learnt it from a sergeant of
  Houssas, and instantly the o-koli beat sharply, and the headmen of the
  villages came panting to the palaver house to meet the paramount chief of the
  Akasava.</p>

  <p>"Sandi is dead," said the chief solemnly. "He was our father and our
  mother and carried us in his arms; we loved him and did many disagreeable
  things for him because of our love. But now that he is dead, and there is
  none to say 'Yea' or 'Nay' to us, the time of which I have spoken to you
  secretly has come; therefore let us take up our arms and go out, first
  against the God-men who pray and bewitch us with the sprinkling of water,
  then against the chief of the Ochori, who for many years have put shame upon
  us."</p>

  <p>"Master," said a little chief from the fishing village which is near to
  the Ochori border, "is it wise&mdash;our Lord Sandi having said there shall
  be no war?"</p>

  <p>"Our Lord Sandi is dead," said the paramount chief wisely; "and being
  dead, it does not greatly concern us what he said; besides which," he said,
  as a thought struck him, "last night I had a dream and saw Sandi; he was
  standing amidst great fires, and he said, 'Go forth and bring me the head of
  the chief of the Ochori.'"</p>

  <p>No further time was wasted. That night the men of twenty villages danced
  the dance of killing, and the great fire of the Akasava burnt redly on the
  sandy beach to the embarrassment of a hippo family that lived in the high
  grasses near by.</p>

  <p>In the grey of the morning the Akasava chief mustered six hundred spears
  and three score of canoes, and he delivered his oration; "First, we will
  destroy the mission men, for they are white, and it is not right that they
  should live and Sandi be dead; then we will go against Bosambo, the chief of
  the Ochori. When rains came in the time of kidding, he who is a foreigner and
  of no human origin brought many evil persons with him and destroyed our
  fishing villages, and Sandi said there should be no killing. Now Sandi is
  dead, and, I do not doubt, in hell, and there is none to hold our pride."</p>

  <p>Round the bend of the river, ever so slowly, for she was breasting a
  strong and treacherous current, came the nose of the Zaire. It is worthy of
  note that the little blue flag at her stern was not at half-mast. The exact
  significance of this was lost on the Akasava. Gingerly the little craft felt
  its way to the sandy strip of beach, a plank was thrust forth, and along it
  came, very dapper and white, his little ebony stick with the silver knob
  swinging between his fingers, Mr Commissioner Sanders, very much alive, and
  there were two bright Maxim-guns on either side of the gangway that covered
  the beach.</p>

  <p>A nation, paralysed by fear and apprehension, watched the debarquement,
  the chief of the Akasava being a little in advance of his painted warriors.
  On Sanders' face was a look of innocent surprise. "Chief," said he, "you do
  me great honour that you gather your young men to welcome me; nevertheless, I
  would rather see them working in their gardens." He walked along one row of
  fighting men, plentifully besmeared with cam-wood, and his was the leisurely
  step of some great personage inspecting a guard of honour.</p>

  <p>"I perceive," he went on, talking over his shoulder to the chief who,
  fascinated by the unexpected vision, followed him, "I perceive that each man
  has a killing spear, also a fighting shield of wicker work, and many have
  N'Gombi swords."</p>

  <p>"Lord, it is true," said the chief, recovering his wits, "for we go
  hunting elephant in the Great Forest."</p>

  <p>"Also that some have the little bones of men fastened about their
  necks&mdash;that is not for the elephant." He said this meditatively,
  musingly, as he continued his inspection, and the chief was frankly
  embarrassed.</p>

  <p>"There is a rumour," he stammered, "it is said&mdash;there came a spy who
  told us&mdash;that the Ochori were gathering for war, and we were
  afraid&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Strange," said Sanders, half to himself, but speaking in the vernacular,
  "strange indeed is this story, for I have come straight from the Ochori city,
  and there I saw nothing but men who ground corn and hunted peacefully; also
  their chief is ill, suffering from a fever." He shook his head in
  well-simulated bewilderment.</p>

  <p>"Lord," said the poor chief of the Akasava, "perhaps men have told us
  lies&mdash;such things have happened&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That is true," said Sanders gravely. "This is a country of lies: some say
  that I am dead; and, lo! the news has gone around that there is no law in the
  land, and men may kill and war at their good pleasure."</p>

  <p>"Though I die at this minute," said the chief virtuously, "though the
  river turn to fire and consume my inmost stomach, though every tree become a
  tiger to devour me, I have not dreamt of war."</p>

  <p>Sanders grinned internally.</p>

  <p>"Spare your breath," he said gently, "you who go hunting elephants, for it
  is a long journey to the Great Forest, and there are many swamps to be
  crossed, many rivers to be swum. My heart is glad that I have come in time to
  bid you farewell." There was a most impressive silence, for this killing of
  elephants was a stray excuse of the chief's. The Great Forest is a journey of
  two months, one to get there and one to return, and is moreover through the
  most cursed country, and the Akasava are not a people that love long journeys
  save with the current of the river.</p>

  <p>The silence was broken by the chief.</p>

  <p>"Lord, we desire to put off our journey in your honour, for if we go, how
  shall we gather in palaver?"</p>

  <p>Sanders shook his head. "Let no man stop the hunter," quoth he. "Go in
  peace, chief, and you shall secure many teeth." [Tusks&mdash;EW] He saw a
  sudden light come to the chief's eyes, but continued, "I will send with you a
  sergeant of Houssas, that he may carry back to me the story of your
  prowess"&mdash;the light died away again&mdash;"for there will be many liars
  who will say that you never reached the Great Forest, and I shall have
  evidence to confound them." Still the chief hesitated, and the waiting ranks
  listened, eagerly shuffling forward, till they ceased to bear any semblance
  to an ordered army, and were as a mob.</p>

  <p>"Lord," said the chief, "we will go tomorrow&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The smile was still on Sanders' lips, but his face was set, and his eyes
  held a steely glitter that the chief of the Akasava knew. "You go today, my
  man," said Sanders, lowering his voice till he spoke in little more than a
  whisper, "else your warriors march under a new chief, and you swing on a
  tree."</p>

  <p>"Lord, we go," said the man huskily, "though we are bad marchers and our
  feet are very tender."</p>

  <p>Sanders, remembering the weariness of the Akasava, found his face
  twitching. "With sore feet you may rest," he said significantly, "with sore
  backs you can neither march nor rest&mdash;go!" At dawn the next morning the
  N'Gombi people came in twenty-five war canoes to join their Akasava friends,
  and found the village tenanted by women and old men, and Tigili, the king, in
  the shock of the discovery, surrendered quietly to the little party of
  Houssas on the beach.</p>

  <p>"What comes to me, lord?" asked Tigili, the king. Sanders whistled
  thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"I have some instructions about you somewhere," he said.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap09"
     name="chap09">IX. &mdash; THE WOOD OF DEVILS</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Weekly Tale-Teller</i>, September 25, 1909</h3>

  <p class="first">FOUR days out of M'Sakidanga, if native report be true,
  there is a trickling stream that meanders down from N'Gombi country. Native
  report says that this is navigable even in the dry season.</p>

  <p>The missionaries at Bonginda ridicule this report; and Arburt, the young
  chief of the station, with a gentle laugh in his blue eyes, listened one day
  to the report of Elebi about a fabulous land at the end of this river, and
  was kindly incredulous.</p>

  <p>"If it be that ivory is stored in this place," he said in the vernacular,
  "or great wealth lies for the lifting, go to Sandi, for this ivory belongs to
  the Government. But do you, Elebi, fix your heart more upon God's treasures
  in heaven, and your thoughts upon your unworthiness to merit a place in His
  kingdom, and let the ivory go." Elebi was known to Sanders as a native
  evangelist of the tornado type, a thunderous, voluble sub-minister of the
  service; he had, in his ecstatic moments, made many converts. But there were
  days of reaction, when Elebi sulked in his mud hut, and reviewed Christianity
  calmly.</p>

  <p>It was a service, this new religion. You could not work yourself to a
  frenzy in it, and then have done with the thing for a week. You must needs go
  on, on, never tiring, never departing from the straight path, exercising
  irksome self-restraint, leaving undone that which you would rather do.</p>

  <p>"Religion is prison," grumbled Elebi, after his interview, and shrugged
  his broad, black shoulders.</p>

  <p>In his hut he was in the habit of discarding his European coat for the
  loin cloth and the blanket, for Elebi was a savage&mdash;an imitative
  savage&mdash;but still barbarian.</p>

  <p>Once, preaching on the River of Devils, he had worked himself up to such a
  pitch of enthusiastic fervour that he had smitten a scoffer, breaking his
  arm, and an outraged Sanders had him arrested, whipped, and fined a thousand
  rods. Hereafter Elebi had figured in certain English missionary circles as a
  Christian martyr, for he had lied magnificently, and his punishment had been
  represented as a form of savage persecution.</p>

  <p>But the ivory lay buried three days' march beyond the Secret River; thus
  Elebi brooded over the log that smouldered in his hut day and night. Three
  days beyond the river, branching off at a place where there were two graves,
  the country was reputably full of devils, and Elebi shuddered at the thought;
  but, being a missionary and a lay evangelist, and, moreover, the proud
  possessor of a copy of the Epistle to the Romans (laboriously rendered into
  the native tongue), he had little to fear. He had more to fear from a certain
  White Devil at a far-away headquarters, who might be expected to range the
  lands of the Secret River, when the rains had come and gone.</p>

  <p>It was supposed that Elebi had one wife, conforming to the custom of the
  white man, but the girl who came into the hut with a steaming bowl of fish in
  her hands was not the wife that the missionaries recognized as such.</p>

  <p>"Sikini," he said, "I am going a journey by canoe."</p>

  <p>"In the blessed service?" asked Sikini, who had come under the influence
  of the man in his more elated periods.</p>

  <p>"The crackling of a fire is like a woman's tongue," quoted Elebi; "and it
  is easier to keep the lid on a boiling pot than a secret in a woman's heart."
  Elebi had the river proverbs at his finger-tips, and the girl laughed, for
  she was his favourite wife, and knew that in course of time the information
  would come to her.</p>

  <p>"Sikini," said the man suddenly, "you know that I have kept you when the
  Blood Taker would have me put you away." (Arburt had a microscope and spent
  his evenings searching the blood of his flock for signs of trynosomiasis.)
  "You know that for your sake I lied to him who is my father and my protector,
  saying, 'There shall be but one wife in my house, and that Tombalo, the coast
  woman.'" The girl nodded, eyeing him stolidly.</p>

  <p>"Therefore I tell you that I am going beyond the Secret River, three days'
  march, leaving the canoe at a place where there are two graves."</p>

  <p>"What do you seek?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"There are many teeth in that country," he said; "dead ivory that the
  people brought with them from a distant country, and have hidden, fearing one
  who is a Breaker of Stones. I shall come back rich, and buy many wives who
  shall wait upon you and serve you, and then I will no longer be Christian,
  but will worship the red fetish as my father did, and his father." [Bula
  Matidi, i.e., "Stone Breaker," is the native name for the Congo
  Government&mdash;EW]</p>

  <p>"Go," she said, nodding thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>He told her many things that he had not revealed to Arburt&mdash;of how
  the ivory came, of the people who guarded it, of the means by which he
  intended to secure it.</p>

  <p>Next morning before the mission lo-koli sounded, he had slipped away in
  his canoe; and Arburt, when the news came to him, sighed and called him a
  disappointing beggar&mdash;for Arburt was human. Sanders, who was also human,
  sent swift messengers to arrest Elebi, for it is not a good thing that
  treasure-hunting natives should go wandering through a strange country, such
  excursions meaning war, and war meaning, to Sanders at any rate, solemn
  official correspondence, which his soul loathed.</p>

  <p>Who would follow the fortunes of Elebi must paddle in his wake as far as
  Okau, where the Barina meets the Lapoi, must take the left river path, past
  the silent pool of the White Devil, must follow the winding stream till the
  elephants' playing ground be reached. Here the forest has been destroyed for
  the sport of the Great Ones; the shore is strewn with tree trunks, carelessly
  uprooted and as carelessly tossed aside by the gambolling mammoth. The ground
  is innocent of herbage or bush; it is a flat wallow of mud, with the marks of
  pads where the elephant has passed.</p>

  <p>Elebi drew his canoe up the bank, carefully lifted his cooking-pot, full
  of living fire, and emptied its contents, heaping thereon fresh twigs and
  scraps of dead wood.</p>

  <p>Then he made himself a feast, and went to sleep.</p>

  <p>A wandering panther came snuffling and howling in the night, and Elebi
  rose and replenished the fire. In the morning he sought for the creek that
  led to the Secret River, and found it hidden by the hippo grass.</p>

  <p>Elebi had many friends in the N'Gombi country. They were gathered in the
  village of Tambango&mdash;to the infinite embarrassment of the chief of that
  village&mdash;for Elebi's friends laid hands upon whatsoever they desired,
  being strangers and well armed, and, moreover, outnumbering the men of the
  village three to one. One, O'Sako, did the chief hold in greatest dread, for
  he said little, but stalked tragically through the untidy street of Tambango,
  a bright, curved execution knife in the crook of his left arm. O'Sako was
  tall and handsome. One broad shoulder gleamed in its nakedness, and his
  muscular arms were devoid of ornamentation. His thick hair was plastered with
  clay till it was like a European woman's, and his body was smeared with
  ingola dust.</p>

  <p>Once only he condescended to address his host.</p>

  <p>"You shall find me three young men against the Lord Elebi's arrival, and
  they shall lead us to the land of the Secret River."</p>

  <p>"But, master," pleaded the chief, "no man may go to the Secret River,
  because of the devils."</p>

  <p>"Three men," said O'Sako softly, "three young men swift of foot, with eyes
  like the N'Gombi, and mouths silent as the dead."</p>

  <p>"&mdash;the devils," repeated the chief weakly, but O'Sako stared straight
  ahead and strode on.</p>

  <p>When the sun blazed furiously on the rim of the world in a last expiring
  effort, and the broad river was a flood of fire, and long shadows ran through
  the clearings, Elebi came to the village. He came unattended from the south,
  and he brought with him no evidence of his temporary sojourn in the camps of
  civilization. Save for his loin cloth, and his robe of panther skin thrown
  about his shoulders, he was naked.</p>

  <p>There was a palaver house at the end of the village, a thatched little
  wattle hut perched on a tiny hill, and the Lord Elebi gathered there his
  captains and the chief of the village. He made a speech.</p>

  <p>"Caa, caa," he began&mdash;and it means "long ago," and is a famous
  opening to speeches&mdash;"before the white man came, and when the Arabi came
  down from the northern countries to steal women and ivory, the people of the
  Secret River buried their 'points' in a Place of Devils. Their women they
  could not bury, so they lost them. Now all the people of the Secret River are
  dead. The Arabi killed some, Bula Matadi killed others, but the sickness
  killed most of all. Where their villages were the high grass has grown, and
  in their gardens only the weaver bird speaks. Yet I know of this place, for
  there came to me a vision and a voice that said&mdash;" The rest of the
  speech from the European standpoint was pure blasphemy, because Elebi had had
  the training of a lay preacher, and had an easy delivery.</p>

  <p>When he had finished, the chief of the village of Tambango spoke. It was a
  serious discourse on devils. There was no doubt at all that in the forest
  where the cache was there was a veritable stronghold of devildom. Some had
  bad faces and were as tall as the gum-trees&mdash;taller, for they used whole
  trees for clubs; some were small, so small that they travelled on the wings
  of bees, but all were very potent, very terrible, and most effective
  guardians of buried treasure. Their greatest accomplishment lay in leading
  astray the traveller; men went into the forest in search of game or copal or
  rubber, and never came back, because there were a thousand ways in and no way
  out.</p>

  <p>Elebi listened gravely.</p>

  <p>"Devils of course there are," he said, "including the Devil, the Old One,
  who is the enemy of God. I have had much to do with the casting out of
  devils&mdash;in my holy capacity as a servant of the Word. Of the lesser
  devils I know nothing, though I do not doubt they live. Therefore I think it
  would be better for all if we offered prayer." On his instruction the party
  knelt in full view of the village, and Elebi prayed conventionally but with
  great earnestness that the Powers of Darkness should not prevail, but that
  the Great Work should go on triumphantly.</p>

  <p>After which, to make doubly sure, the party sacrificed two fowls before a
  squat bete that stood before the chief's door, and a crazy witch-doctor
  anointed Elebi with human fat.</p>

  <p>"We will go by way of Ochori," said Elebi, who was something of a
  strategist. "These Ochori folk will give us food and guides, being a cowardly
  folk and very fearful." He took farewell of the old chief and continued his
  journey, with O'Sako and his warriors behind him. So two days passed. An
  hour's distance from the city of the Ochori he called a conference.</p>

  <p>"Knowing the world," he said, "I am acquainted with the Ochori, who are
  slaves; you shall behold their chief embrace my feet. Since it is fitting
  that one, such as I, who know the ways of white men and their magic, should
  be received with honour, let us send forward a messenger to say that the Lord
  Elebi comes, and bid them kill so many goats against our coming."</p>

  <p>"That is good talk," said O'Sako, his lieutenant, and a messenger was
  despatched.</p>

  <p>Elebi with his caravan followed slowly.</p>

  <p>It is said that Elebi's message came to Bosambo of Monrovia, chief of the
  Ochori, when he was in the despondent mood peculiar to men of action who find
  life running too smoothly.</p>

  <p>It was Bosambo's practice&mdash;and one of which his people stood in some
  awe&mdash;to reflect aloud in English in all moments of crisis, or on any
  occasion when it was undesirable that his thoughts should be conveyed
  abroad.</p>

  <p>He listened in silence, sitting before the door of his hut and smoking a
  short wooden pipe, whilst the messenger described the quality of the coming
  visitor, and the unparalleled honour which was to fall upon the Ochori.</p>

  <p>Said Bosambo at the conclusion of the recital, "Damn nigger." The
  messenger was puzzled by the strange tongue.</p>

  <p>"Lord Chief," he said, "my master is a great one, knowing the ways of
  white men."</p>

  <p>"I also know something of white men." said Bosambo calmly, in the River
  dialect, "having many friends, including Sandi, who married my brother's
  wife's sister, and is related to me. Also," said Bosambo daringly, "I have
  shaken hands with the Great White King who dwells beyond the big water, and
  he has given me many presents." With this story the messenger went back to
  the slowly advancing caravan, and Elebi was impressed and a little
  bewildered.</p>

  <p>"It is strange," he said, "no man has ever known an Ochori chief who was
  aught but a dog and the son of a dog&mdash;let us see this Bosambo. Did you
  tell him to come out and meet me?"</p>

  <p>"No," replied the messenger frankly, "he was such a great one, and was so
  haughty because of Sandi, who married his brother's wife's sister; and so
  proud that I did not dare tell him."</p>

  <p>There is a spot on the edge of the Ochori city where at one time Sanders
  had caused to be erected a warning sign, and here Elebi found the chief
  waiting and was flattered. There was a long and earnest conference in the
  little palaver house of the city, and here Elebi told as much of his story as
  was necessary, and Bosambo believed as much as he could.</p>

  <p>"And what do you need of me and my people?" asked Bosambo at length.</p>

  <p>"Lord chief," said Elebi, "I go a long journey, being fortified with the
  blessed spirit of which you know nothing, that being an especial mystery of
  the white men."</p>

  <p>"There is no mystery which I did not know," said Bosambo loftily, "and if
  you speak of spirits, I will speak of certain saints, also of a Virgin who is
  held in high respect by white men."</p>

  <p>"If you speak of the blessed Paul&mdash;" began Elebi, a little at
  sea.</p>

  <p>"Not only of Paul but Peter, John, Luke, Matthew, Antonio, and Thomas,"
  recited Bosambo rapidly. He had not been a scholar at the Catholic mission
  for nothing. Elebi was nonplussed.</p>

  <p>"We will let these magic matters rest," said Elebi wisely, "it is evident
  to me that you are a learned man. Now I go to seek some wonderful treasures.
  All that I told you before was a lie. Let us speak as brothers. I go to the
  wood of devils, where no man has been for many years. I beg you, therefore,
  to give me food and ten men for carriers."</p>

  <p>"Food you can have but no men," said Bosambo, "for I have pledged my word
  to Sandi, who is, as you know, the husband of my brother's wife's sister,
  that no man of mine should leave this country." With this Elebi had to be
  content, for a new spirit had come to the Ochori since he had seen them last,
  and there was a defiance in the timid eyes of these slaves of other days
  which was disturbing. Besides, they seemed well armed.</p>

  <p>In the morning the party set forth and Bosambo, who took no risks, saw
  them started on their journey. He observed that part of the equipment of the
  little caravan were two big baskets filled to the brim with narrow strips of
  red cloth.</p>

  <p>"This is my magic," said Elebi mysteriously, when he was questioned, "it
  is fitting that you should know its power." Bosambo yawned in his face with
  great insolence.</p>

  <p>Clear of Ochori by one day's march, the party reached the first straggling
  advance guard of the Big Forest. A cloud of gum-trees formed the approach to
  the wood, and here the magic of Elebi's basket of cloth strips became
  revealed.</p>

  <p>Every few hundred yards the party stopped, and Elebi tied one of the
  strips to a branch of a tree.</p>

  <p>"In this way," he communicated to his lieutenant, "we may be independent
  of gods, and fearless of devils, for if we cannot find the ivory we can at
  least find our way back again." (There had been such an experiment made by
  the missionaries in traversing the country between Bonguidga and the Big
  River, but there were no devils in that country.) In two days' marches they
  came upon a place of graves. There had been a village there, for Isisi palms
  grew luxuriously, and pushing aside the grass they came upon a rotting roof.
  Also there were millions of weaver birds in the nut-palms, and a choked
  banana grove.</p>

  <p>The graves, covered with broken cooking pots, Elebi found, and was
  satisfied.</p>

  <p>In the forest, a league beyond the dead village, they came upon an old
  man, so old that you might have lifted him with a finger and thumb.</p>

  <p>"Where do the young men go in their strength?" he mumbled childishly;
  "into the land of small devils? Who shall guide them back to their women?
  None, for the devils will confuse them, opening new roads and closing the
  old. Oh, Ko Ko!" He snivelled miserably.</p>

  <p>"Father," said Elebi, dangling strips of red flannel from his hand, "this
  is white man's magic, we come back by the way we go." Then the old man fell
  into an insane fit of cursing, and threw at them a thousand deaths, and
  Elebi's followers huddled back in frowning fear.</p>

  <p>"You have lived too long," said Elebi gently, and passed his spear through
  the old man's neck.</p>

  <p>They found the ivory two days' journey beyond the place of killing. It was
  buried under a mound, which was overgrown with rank vegetation, and there was
  by European calculation some £50,000 worth.</p>

  <p>"We will go back and find carriers," said Elebi, "taking with us as many
  of the teeth as we can carry." Two hours later the party began its return
  journey, following the path where at intervals of every half-mile a strip of
  scarlet flannelette hung from a twig.</p>

  <p>There were many paths they might have taken, paths that looked as though
  they had been made by the hand of man, and Elebi was glad that he had blazed
  the way to safety.</p>

  <p>For eight hours the caravan moved swiftly, finding its direction with no
  difficulty; then the party halted for the night.</p>

  <p>Elebi was awakened in the night by a man who was screaming, and he leapt
  up, stirring the fire to a blaze.</p>

  <p>"It is the brother of Olambo of Kinshassa, he has the sickness mongo,"
  said an awe-stricken voice, and Elebi called a council.</p>

  <p>"There are many ways by which white men deal with this sickness," he said
  wisely, "by giving certain powders and by sticking needles into arms, but to
  give medicine for the sickness when madness comes is useless&mdash;so I have
  heard the fathers at the station say, because madness only comes when the man
  is near death."</p>

  <p>"He was well last night," said a hushed voice. "There are many devils in
  the forest, let us ask him what he has seen." So a deputation went to the
  screaming, writhing figure that lay trussed and tied on the ground, and spoke
  with him. They found some difficulty in gaining an opening, for he jabbered
  and mouthed and laughed and yelled incessantly.</p>

  <p>"On the question of devils," at last Elebi said.</p>

  <p>"Devils," screeched the madman. "Yi! I saw six devils with fire in their
  mouths&mdash;death to you, Elebi! Dog&mdash;" He said other things which were
  not clean.</p>

  <p>"If there were water here," mused Elebi, "we might drown him; since there
  is only the forest and the earth, carry him away from the camp, and I will
  make him silent." So they carried the lunatic away, eight strong men swaying
  through the forest, and they came back, leaving Elebi alone with his patient.
  The cries ceased suddenly and Elebi returned, wiping his hands on his leopard
  skin.</p>

  <p>"Let us sleep," said Elebi, and lay down.</p>

  <p>Before the dawn came up the party were on the move.</p>

  <p>They marched less than a mile from their camping ground and then faltered
  and stopped.</p>

  <p>"There is no sign, lord," the leader reported, and Elebi called him a fool
  and went to investigate.</p>

  <p>But there was no red flannel, not a sign of it. They went on another mile
  without success.</p>

  <p>"We have taken the wrong path, let us return," said Elebi, and the party
  retraced its steps to the camp they had abandoned. That day was spent in
  exploring the country for three miles on either side, but there was no
  welcome blaze to show the trail.</p>

  <p>"We are all N'Gombi men," said Elebi, "let us tomorrow go forward, keeping
  the sun at our back; the forest has no terrors for the N'Gombi folk&mdash;yet
  I cannot understand why the white man's magic failed."</p>

  <p>"Devils!" muttered his lieutenant sullenly.</p>

  <p>Elebi eyed him thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"Devils sometimes desire sacrifices." he said with significance, "the wise
  goat does not bleat when the priest approaches the herd." In the morning a
  great discovery was made. A crumpled piece of flannel was found on the
  outskirts of the camp. It lay in the very centre of a path, and Elebi shouted
  in his joy.</p>

  <p>Again the caravan started on the path. A mile farther along another little
  red patch caught his eye, half a mile beyond, another.</p>

  <p>Yet none of these were where he had placed them, and they all bore
  evidence of rude handling, which puzzled the lay brother sorely. Sometimes
  the little rags would be missing altogether, but a search party would come
  upon one some distance off the track, and the march would go on.</p>

  <p>Near sunset Elebi halted suddenly and pondered. Before him ran his long
  shadow; the sun was behind him when it ought to have been in front.</p>

  <p>"We are going in the wrong direction," he said, and the men dropped their
  loads and stared at him. "Beyond any doubt," said Elebi after a pause, "this
  is the work of devils&mdash;let us pray." He prayed aloud earnestly for
  twenty minutes, and darkness had fallen before he had finished.</p>

  <p>They camped that night on the spot where the last red guide was, and in
  the morning they returned the way they had come. There was plenty of
  provision, but water was hard to come by, and therein lay the danger. Less
  than a mile they had gone before the red rags had vanished completely, and
  they wandered helplessly in a circle.</p>

  <p>"This is evidently a matter not for prayer, but for sacrifice," concluded
  Elebi, so they slew one of the guides.</p>

  <p>Three nights later, O'Sako, the friend of Elebi, crawled stealthily to the
  place where Elebi was sleeping, and settled the dispute which had arisen
  during the day as to who was in command of the expedition.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">"Master," said Bosambo of Monrovia, "all that you ordered me
  to do, that I did." Sanders sat before the chief's hut in his camp chair and
  nodded.</p>

  <p>"When your word came that I should find Elebi&mdash;he being an enemy of
  the Government and disobeying your word&mdash;I took fifty of my young men
  and followed on his tracks. At first the way was easy, because he had tied
  strips of cloth to the trees to guide him on the backward journey, but
  afterwards it was hard, for the N'Kema that live in the wood&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Monkeys?" Sanders raised his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"Monkeys, master," Bosambo nodded his head, "the little black monkeys of
  the forest who love bright colours&mdash;they had come down from their trees
  and torn away the cloths and taken them to their houses after the fashion of
  the monkey people. Thus Elebi lost himself and with him his men, for I found
  their bones, knowing the way of the forest."</p>

  <p>"What else did you find?" asked Sanders.</p>

  <p>"Nothing, master," said Bosambo, looking him straight in the eye.</p>

  <p>"That is probably a lie!" said Sanders.</p>

  <p>Bosambo thought of the ivory buried beneath the floor of his hut and did
  not contradict him.</p>

     name="chap10">X. &mdash; THE LOVES OF M'LINO</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Weekly Tale-Teller</i>, April 22, 1911</h3>

  <p class="first">WHEN a man loves one woman, whether she be alive or dead, a
  deep and fragrant memory or a very pleasant reality, he is apt to earn the
  appellation of "woman hater," a hasty judgment which the loose-minded pass
  upon any man whose loves lack promiscuity, and who does not diffuse his
  passions. Sanders was described as a woman-hater by such men who knew him
  sufficiently little to analyse his character, but Sanders was not a
  woman-hater in any sense of the word, for he bore no ill will toward woman
  kind, and certainly was innocent of any secret love.</p>

  <p>There was a young man named Ludley who had been assistant to Sanders for
  three months, at the end of which time Sanders sent for him&mdash;he was
  stationed at Isisi City.</p>

  <p>"I think you can go home," said Sanders.</p>

  <p>The young man opened his eyes in astonishment.</p>

  <p>"Why?" he said.</p>

  <p>Sanders made no reply, but stared through the open doorway at the distant
  village.</p>

  <p>"Why?" demanded the young man again.</p>

  <p>"I've heard things," said Sanders shortly&mdash;he was rather
  uncomfortable, but did not show it.</p>

  <p>"Things&mdash;like what?"</p>

  <p>Sanders shifted uneasily in his chair. "Oh&mdash;things," he said vaguely,
  and added; "You go home and marry that nice girl you used to rave about when
  you first came out."</p>

  <p>Young Ludley went red under his tan. "Look here, chief!" he said, half
  angrily, half apologetically, "you're surely not going to take any
  notice&mdash;you know It's the sort of thing that's done in black
  countries&mdash;oh, damn it all, you're not going to act as censor over my
  morals, are you?"</p>

  <p>Sanders looked at the youth coldly.</p>

  <p>"Your morals aren't worth worrying about," he said truthfully. "You could
  be the most depraved devil in the world&mdash;which I'll admit you
  aren't&mdash;and I should not trouble to reform you. No. It's the morals of
  my cannibals that worry me. Home you go, my son; get married, crescit sub
  pandere virtus&mdash;you'll find the translation in the foreign phrase
  department of any respectable dictionary. As to the sort of things that are
  done in black countries, they don't do them in our black
  countries&mdash;monkey tricks of that sort are good enough for the Belgian
  Congo, or for Togoland, but they aren't good enough for this little strip of
  wilderness."</p>

  <p>Ludley went home. He did not tell anybody the real reason why he had come
  home, because it would not have sounded nice. He was a fairly decent boy, as
  boys of his type go, and he said nothing worse about Sanders than that he was
  a woman-hater.</p>

  <p>The scene that followed his departure shows how little the white mind
  differs from the black in its process of working. For, after seeing his
  assistant safely embarked on a homeward-bound boat. Sanders went up the river
  to Isisi, and there saw a woman who was called M'Lino.</p>

  <p>The average black woman is ugly of face, but beautiful of figure, but
  M'Lino was no ordinary woman, as you shall learn. The Isisi people, who keep
  extraordinary records in their heads, the information being handed from
  father to son, say that M'Lino came from an Arabi family, and certainly if a
  delicately-chiselled nose, a refinement of lip, prove anything, they prove
  M'Lino came from no pure Bantu stock.</p>

  <p>She came to Sanders when he sent for her, alert, suspicious, very much on
  her guard.</p>

  <p>Before he could speak, she asked him a question.</p>

  <p>"Lord, where is Lijingii?" This was the nearest the native ever got to the
  pronunciation of Ludley's name.</p>

  <p>"Lijingii has gone across the black water," said Sanders gently, "to his
  own people."</p>

  <p>"You sent him, lord," she said quickly, and Sanders made no reply.</p>

  <p>"Lord," she went on, and Sanders wondered at the bitterness in her tone,
  "it is said that you hate women."</p>

  <p>"Then a lie is told," said Sanders. "I do not hate women; rather I greatly
  honour them, for they go down to the caves of hell when they bear children;
  also I regard them highly because they are otherwise brave and very
  loyal."</p>

  <p>She said nothing. Her head was sunk till her chin rested on her bare,
  brown breast, but she looked at him from under her brows, and her eyes were
  filled with a strange luminosity. Something like a panic awoke in Sanders'
  heart&mdash;had the mischief been done? He cursed Ludley, and breathed a
  fervent, if malevolent, prayer that his ship would go down with him. But her
  words reassured him.</p>

  <p>"I made Lijingii love me," she said, "though he was a great lord, and I
  was a slave; I also would have gone down to hell, for some day I hoped I
  should bear him children, but now that can never be."</p>

  <p>"And thank the Lord for it!" said Sanders, under his breath.</p>

  <p>He would have given her some words of cheer, but she turned abruptly from
  him and walked away. Sanders watched the graceful figure as it receded down
  the straggling street, and went back to his steamer.</p>

  <p>He was ten miles down the river before he remembered that the reproof he
  had framed for the girl had been undelivered.</p>

  <p>"That is very extraordinary," said Sanders, with some annoyance, "I must
  be losing my memory."</p>

  <p>Three months later young Penson came out from England to take the place of
  the returned Ludley. He was a fresh-faced youth, bubbling over with
  enthusiasm, and, what is more important, he had served a two-years'
  apprenticeship at Sierra Leone.</p>

  <p>"You are to go up to Isisi," said Sanders, "and I want to tell you that
  you've got to be jolly careful."</p>

  <p>"What's the racket?" demanded the youth eagerly. "Are the beggars
  rising?"</p>

  <p>"So far as I know," said Sanders, putting his feet up on the rail of the
  verandah, "they are not&mdash;it is not bloodshed, but love that you've got
  to guard against." And he told the story of M'Lino, even though it was no
  creditable story to British administration.</p>

  <p>"You can trust me," said young Penson, when he had finished.</p>

  <p>"I trust you all right," said Sanders, "but I don't trust the
  woman&mdash;let me hear from you from time to time." if you don't write about
  her I shall get suspicious, and I'll come along in a very unpleasant
  mood."</p>

  <p>"You can trust me," said young Penson again; for he was at the age when a
  man is very sure of himself.</p>

  <p>Remarkable as it may read, from the moment he left to take up his new post
  until he returned to headquarters, in disgrace, a few months later, he wrote
  no word of the straight, slim girl, with her wonderful eyes. Other
  communications came to hand, official reports, terse and to the point, but no
  mention of M'Lino, and Sanders began to worry.</p>

  <p>The stories came filtering through, extraordinary stories of people who
  had been punished unjustly, of savage floggings administered by order of the
  sub-commissioner, and Sanders took boat and travelled up the river hec
  dum.</p>

  <p>He landed short of the town, and walked along the river bank. It was not
  an easy walk, because the country hereabouts is a riot of vegetation. Then he
  came upon an African idyll&mdash;a young man, who sat playing on a squeaky
  violin, for the pleasure of M'Lino, lying face downwards on the grass, her
  chin in her hands.</p>

  <p>"In the name of a thousand devils!" said Sanders wrathfully; and the boy
  got up from the fallen tree on which he sat, and looked at him calmly, and
  with no apparent embarrassment. Sanders looked down at the girl and
  pointed.</p>

  <p>"Go back to the village, my woman," he said softly, for he was in a
  rage.</p>

  <p>"Now, you magnificent specimen of a white man," he said, when the girl had
  gone&mdash;slowly and reluctantly&mdash;"what is this story I hear about your
  flogging O'Sako?"</p>

  <p>The youth took his pipe from his pocket and lit it coolly. "He beat
  M'Lino," he said, in the tone of one who offered full justification.</p>

  <p>"From which fact I gather that he is the unfortunate husband of that
  attractive nigger lady you were charming just now when I arrived?"</p>

  <p>"Don't be beastly," said the other, scowling. "I know she's a native and
  all that sort of thing, but my people at home will get used to her
  colour&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Go on board my boat," said Sanders quietly. "Regard yourself as my
  prisoner."</p>

  <p>Sanders brought him down to headquarters without troubling to investigate
  the flogging of O'Sako, and no word passed concerning M'Lino till they were
  back again at headquarters.</p>

  <p>"Of course I shall send you home," said Sanders.</p>

  <p>"I supposed you would," said the other listlessly. He had lost all his
  self-assurance on the journey down river, and was a very depressed young man
  indeed.</p>

  <p>"I must have been mad," he admitted, the day before the mail boat called
  en route for England; "from the very first I loved her&mdash;good heavens,
  what an ass I am!"</p>

  <p>"You are," agreed Sanders, and saw him off to the ship with a cheerful
  heart.</p>

  <p>"I will have no more sub-commissioners at Isisi," he wrote acidly to the
  Administration. "I find my work sufficiently entertaining without the
  additional amusement of having to act as chaperon to British officials." He
  made a special journey to Isisi to straighten matters out, and M'Lino came
  unbidden to see him.</p>

  <p>"Lord, is he gone, too?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"When I want you, M'Lino," said Sanders, "I will send for you."</p>

  <p>"I loved him," she said, with more feeling than Sanders thought was
  possible for a native to show.</p>

  <p>"You are an easy lover," said Sanders.</p>

  <p>She nodded. "That is the way with some women," she said. "When I love, I
  love with terrible strength; when I hate, I hate for ever and ever&mdash;I
  hate you, master!"</p>

  <p>She said it very simply.</p>

  <p>"If you were a man," said the exasperated Commissioner, "I would tie you
  up and whip you."</p>

  <p>"F-f-b!" said the girl contemptuously, and left him staring.</p>

  <p>To appreciate the position, you have to realize that Sanders was lord of
  all this district; that he had the power of life and death, and no man dared
  question or disobey his word. Had M'Lino been a man, as he said, she would
  have suffered for her treason&mdash;there is no better word for her
  offence&mdash;but she was a woman, and a seriously gifted woman, and,
  moreover, sure of whatever powers she had.</p>

  <p>He did not see her again during the three days he was in the city, nor
  (this is the extraordinary circumstance) did he discuss her with the chief.
  He learned that she had become the favourite wife of O'Sako; that she had
  many lovers and scorned her husband, but he sought no news of her. Once he
  saw her walking towards him, and went out of his way to avoid her. It was
  horribly weak and he knew it, but he had no power to resist the impulse that
  came over him to give her a wide berth.</p>

  <p>Following this visit, Sanders was coming down stream at a leisurely
  pace,&mdash;he himself at the steering wheel, and his eyes searching the
  treacherous river for sand banks. His mind was filled with the problem of
  M'Lino, when suddenly in the bush that fringes the Isisi river, something
  went "woof," and the air was filled with flying potlegs. One struck his
  cabin, and splintered a panel to shreds, many fell upon the water, one missed
  Sergeant Abiboo's head and sent his tarbosh flying.</p>

  <p>Sanders rang his engines astern, being curious to discover what induced
  the would-be assassin to fire a blunderbuss in his direction, and Abiboo,
  bare-headed, went pattering forward and slipped the canvas cover from the
  gleaming little Maxim.</p>

  <p>Then four Houssa soldiers jumped into the water and waded ashore, holding
  their rifles above their heads with the one hand and their ammunition in the
  other, and Sanders stood by the rail of the boat, balancing a sporting
  Lee-Enfield in the crook of his arm.</p>

  <p>Whoever fired the shot had chosen the place of killing very well. The bush
  was very thick, the approach to land lay through coarse grass that sprang
  from the swamp, vegetation ran rank, and a tangle of creeper formed a screen
  that would have been impenetrable to a white man.</p>

  <p>But the Houssas had a way&mdash;they found the man with his smoking gun,
  waiting calmly.</p>

  <p>He was of the Isisi people&mdash;a nation of philosophers&mdash;and he
  surrendered his weapon without embarrassment.</p>

  <p>"I think," he said to Sergeant Abiboo, as they hurried down the bank to
  the riverside, "this means death."</p>

  <p>"Death and the torments of hell to follow," said Abiboo, who was
  embittered by the loss of his tarbosh, which had cost him five francs in the
  French territory.</p>

  <p>Sanders put up his rifle when he saw the prisoner. He held an informal
  court in the shattered deck cabin.</p>

  <p>"Did you shoot at me?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I did, master," said the man.</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"Because," the prisoner replied, "you are a devil and exercise
  witchcraft."</p>

  <p>Sanders was puzzled a little. "In what particular section of the devil
  department have I been busy?" he asked in the vernacular.</p>

  <p>The prisoner was gazing at him steadily. "Master," he replied, "it is not
  my business to understand these things. It is said to me, 'kill'&mdash;and I
  kill."</p>

  <p>Sanders wasted no more time in vain questions. The man was put in irons,
  the nose of the steamer turned again down stream, and the Commissioner
  resumed his vigil.</p>

  <p>Midway between B'Fani and Lakaloli he came to a tying-up place. Here there
  were dead trees for the chopping, and he put his men to replenish his stock
  of fuel.</p>

  <p>He was annoyed, not because a man had attempted to take his life, nor even
  because his neat little cabin forward was a litter of splinters and broken
  glass where the potleg had struck, but because he nosed trouble where he
  thought all was peace and harmony.</p>

  <p>He had control of some sixteen distinct and separate nations, each
  isolated and separated from the other by custom and language. They were
  distinct, not as the French are from the Italian, but as the Slav is from the
  Turk.</p>

  <p>In the good old times before the English came there were many wars, tribe
  against tribe, people against people. There were battles, murders, raidings,
  and wholesale crucifixions, but the British changed all that. There was peace
  in the land.</p>

  <p>Sanders selected with care a long, thin cigar from his case, nibbled at
  the end and lit it.</p>

  <p>The prisoner sat on the steel deck of the Zaire near the men's quarters.
  He was chained by the leg-iron to a staple, and did not seem depressed to any
  extent. When Sanders made his appearance, a camp stool in his hand, the
  Commissioner seated himself, and began his inquisition.</p>

  <p>"How do they call you, my man?"</p>

  <p>"Bofabi of Isisi."</p>

  <p>"Who told you to kill me?"</p>

  <p>"Lord, I forget."</p>

  <p>"A man or a woman?"</p>

  <p>"Lord, it may have been either."</p>

  <p>More than that Sanders could not learn, and the subsequent examination at
  Isisi taught Sanders nothing, for, when confronted with M'Lino, the man said
  that he did not know her.</p>

  <p>Sanders went back to his base in a puzzled frame of mind, and Bofabi of
  Isisi was sent to the convict establishment at the river's mouth. There
  matters stood for three months, and all that Sanders learnt of the girl was
  that she had a new lover whose name was Tebeki, and who was chief of the
  Akasava.</p>

  <p>There were three months of peace and calm, and then Tebeki, coveting his
  neighbour's wife, took three hundred spears down into the Isisi country,
  burnt the village that sheltered her, crucified her husband, and carried her
  back with him.</p>

  <p>In honour of this achievement Tebeki gave a feast and a beer dance. There
  were great and shameless orgies that lasted five days, and the strip of
  forest that fringes the river between the Isisi and the lower river became a
  little inferno.</p>

  <p>At the end of the five days Tebeki sat down to consider his position. He
  was in the act of inventing justification for his crime, when Sanders came on
  the scene.</p>

  <p>More ominous were the ten Houssas and the Maxim which accompanied the
  brown faced little man.</p>

  <p>Sanders walked to Tebeki's hut and called him out, and Tebeki, blear-eyed
  and shaky, stepped forth into the hot sunshine, blinking.</p>

  <p>"Tebeki," said Sanders, "what of O'Sako and his village?"</p>

  <p>"Master," said Tebeki, slowly, "he put shame upon me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Spare me your lies," said Sanders coldly, and signed to the Houssas.</p>

  <p>Then he looked round for a suitable tree. There was one behind the
  hut&mdash;a great copal-gum.</p>

  <p>"In half an hour I shall hang you," said Sanders, looking at his
  watch.</p>

  <p>Tebeki said nothing; only his bare feet fidgeted in the dust.</p>

  <p>There came out of the hut a tall girl, who stood eyeing the group with
  curiosity; then she came forward, and laid her hand on Tebeki's bare
  shoulder.</p>

  <p>"What will you do with my man?" she asked. "I am M'Lino, the wife of
  O'Sako."</p>

  <p>Sanders was not horrified, he showed his teeth in a mirthless grin and
  looked at her.</p>

  <p>"You will find another man, M'Lino," he said, "as readily as you found
  this one." Then he turned away to give directions for the hanging. But the
  woman followed him, and boldly laid her hand on his arm.</p>

  <p>"Master," she said, "if any was wronged by O'Sako's death, was it not I,
  his wife? Yet I say let Tebeki go free, for I love him."</p>

  <p>"You may go to the devil," said Sanders politely; "I am getting tired of
  you and your lovers." He hanged Tebeki, expeditiously and with science, and
  the man died immediately, because Sanders was very thorough in this sort of
  business. Then he and the Houssa corps marched away, and the death song of
  the woman sounded fainter and fainter as the forest enveloped him. He camped
  that night on the Hill of Trees, overlooking the sweeping bend of the river,
  and in the morning his orderly came to tell him that the wife of O'Sako
  desired to see him.</p>

  <p>Sanders cursed the wife of O'Sako, but saw her.</p>

  <p>She opened her mission without preliminary.</p>

  <p>"Because of the death I brought to O'Sako, my husband, and Tebeki, my
  lover, the people have cast me forth," she said. "Every hand is against me,
  and if I stay in this country I shall die."</p>

  <p>"Well?" said Sanders.</p>

  <p>"So I will go with you, until you reach the Sangar River, which leads to
  the Congo. I have brothers there."</p>

  <p>"All this may be true," said Sanders dispassionately; "on the other hand,
  I know that your heart is filled with hate because I have taken two men from
  you, and hanged a third. Nevertheless, you shall come with us as far as the
  Sangar River, but you shall not touch the 'chop' of my men, nor shall you
  speak with them."</p>

  <p>She nodded and left him, and Sanders issued orders for her treatment.</p>

  <p>In the middle of the night Abiboo, who, in addition to being Sanders'
  servant, was a sergeant of the Houssas, came to Sanders' tent, and the
  Commissioner jumped out of bed and mechanically reached for his Express.</p>

  <p>"Leopards?" he asked briefly.</p>

  <p>"Master," said Sergeant Abiboo, "it is the woman M'Lino&mdash;she is a
  witch."</p>

  <p>"Sergeant," said the exasperated Sanders, "if you wake me up in the middle
  of the night with that sort of talk, I will break your infernal head."</p>

  <p>"Be that as it may, master," said the sergeant stolidly, "she is a witch,
  for she has talked with my men and done many wonderful things&mdash;such as
  causing them to behold their children and far-away scenes."</p>

  <p>"Have I an escort of babies?" asked Sanders despairingly. "I wish," he
  went on, with quiet savageness, "I had chosen Kroomen or Bushmen&mdash;" the
  sergeant winced&mdash;"or the mad people of the Isisi River, before I took a
  half-company of the King's Houssas." The sergeant gulped down the insult,
  saying nothing.</p>

  <p>"Bring the woman to me," said Sanders. He scrambled into his clothing, and
  lit his tent lantern.</p>

  <p>After a while he heard the pattering of bare feet, and the girl came into
  his tent, and regarded him quietly.</p>

  <p>"M'Lino," said Sanders, "I told you that you were not to speak with my
  men."</p>

  <p>"Lord," she said, "they spoke with me first."</p>

  <p>"Is this true?" The sergeant at the tent door nodded. "Tembeli, the son of
  Sekambano, spoke with her, thus disobeying orders, and the other men
  followed," he said.</p>

  <p>"Bushmen by gad!" fumed Sanders. "You will take Tembeli, the son of
  Sekambano, tie him to a tree, and give him twenty lashes." The sergeant
  saluted, produced a tawdry little notebook, all brass binding and gold edges,
  and made a laborious note.</p>

  <p>"As for you," said Sanders to the woman, "you drop your damned bush
  mesmerism, or I'll treat you in the same way&mdash;alaki?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, lord," she said meekly, and departed.</p>

  <p>Two Houssas tied Tembeli to a tree, and the sergeant gave him twenty-one
  with a pliable hippo-hide&mdash;the extra one being the sergeant's
  perquisite. In the morning the sergeant reported that Tembeli had died in the
  night, and Sanders worried horribly.</p>

  <p>"It isn't the flogging," he said; "he has had the chicalle before."</p>

  <p>"It is the woman," said the sergeant wisely. "She is a witch; I foresaw
  this when she joined the column." They buried Tembeli, the son of Sekambano,
  and Sanders wrote three reports of the circumstances of the death, each of
  which he tore up. Then he marched on.</p>

  <p>That night the column halted near a village, and Sanders sent the woman,
  under escort, to the chief, with orders to see her safely to the Sangar
  River. In half an hour she returned, with the escort, and Sergeant Abiboo
  explained the circumstances.</p>

  <p>"The chief will not take her in, being afraid."</p>

  <p>"Afraid?" Sanders spluttered in his wrath; "Afraid? What is he afraid
  of?"</p>

  <p>"Her devilry," said the sergeant; "the la-kali has told him the story of
  Tebeki, and he will not have her." Sanders swore volubly for five minutes;
  then he went off to interview the chief of the village.</p>

  <p>The interview was short and to the point. Sanders knew this native very
  well, and made no mistakes.</p>

  <p>"Chief," he said at the end of the palaver, "two things I may do; one is
  to punish you for your disobedience, and the other is to go on my way."</p>

  <p>"Master," said the other earnestly, "if you give my village to the fire,
  yet I would not take the woman M'Lino."</p>

  <p>"So much I realize," said Sanders; "therefore I will go on my way." He
  marched at dawn on the following day, the woman a little ahead of the column,
  and under his eye. Halting for a "chop" and rest at midday, a man of the
  Houssas came to him and said there was a dead man hanging from a tree in the
  wood. Sanders went immediately with the man to the place of the hanging, for
  he was responsible for the peace of the district.</p>

  <p>"Where?" he asked, and the man pointed to a straight gum-tree that stood
  by itself in a clearing.</p>

  <p>"Where?" asked Sanders again, for there was no evidence of tragedy. The
  man still pointed at the tree, and Sanders frowned.</p>

  <p>"Go forward and touch his foot," said the Commissioner, and, after a
  little hesitation, the soldier walked slowly to the tree and put out his
  hand. But he touched nothing but air, as far as Sanders could see.</p>

  <p>"You are mad," he said, and whistled for the sergeant.</p>

  <p>"What do you see there?" asked Sanders, and the sergeant replied
  instantly; "Beyond the hanging man&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"There is no hanging man," said Sanders coolly&mdash;for he began to
  appreciate the need for calm reasoning&mdash;"nothing but a tree and some
  shadows."</p>

  <p>The Houssa looked puzzled, and turned a grave face to his. "Master, there
  is a man hanging," he said.</p>

  <p>"That is so," said Sanders quietly, "we must investigate this matter." And
  he signed for the party to return to the camp.</p>

  <p>On the way he asked carelessly if the sergeant had spoken with the woman
  M'Lino.</p>

  <p>"I saw her; but she did not speak, except with her eyes."</p>

  <p>Sanders nodded. "Tell me," he said, "where did you bury Tembeli, the son
  of Sekambano?"</p>

  <p>"Master, we left him, in accordance with our custom, on the ground at the
  foot of a tree." Sanders nodded again, for this is not the custom of the
  Houssas.</p>

  <p>"We will go back on our tracks to the camping place where the woman came
  to us," he said.</p>

  <p>They marched until sundown, and whilst two men pitched his tent Sanders
  strolled round the little camp. The men were sitting about their
  cooking-pots, but the woman M'Lino sat apart, her elbows on her knees, her
  face between her hands.</p>

  <p>"M'Lino," he said to her, halting suddenly before her, "how many men have
  you killed in your life?"</p>

  <p>She looked at him long and fixedly, and he returned the stare; then she
  dropped her eyes. "Many men," she said.</p>

  <p>"So I think," said Sanders.</p>

  <p>He was eating his dinner when Abiboo came slowly toward him.</p>

  <p>"Master, the man has died," he said.</p>

  <p>Sanders looked at him narrowly.</p>

  <p>"Which man?"</p>

  <p>"The man you chicotted with your own hand," said Abiboo.</p>

  <p>Now, the Commissioner had neither chicotted a man, nor had he ordered
  punishment, but he replied in a matter-of-fact tone, "I will see him." On the
  edge of the camp there was a little group about a prostrate figure. The
  Houssas fell apart with black looks as Sanders came near, and there was some
  muttering. Though Sanders did not see it, M'Lino looked strangely at Ahmid, a
  Houssa, who took up his rifle and went stealthily into the bush.</p>

  <p>The Commissioner bent over the man who lay there, felt his breast, and
  detected no beat of heart.</p>

  <p>"Get me my medicine chest," he said, but no-one obeyed him.</p>

  <p>"Sergeant," he repeated, "bring my medicine chest!" Abiboo saluted slowly,
  and, with every appearance of reluctance, went.</p>

  <p>He came back with the case of undressed skin, and Sanders opened it, took
  out the ammonia bottle, and applied it to the man's nose. He made no
  sign.</p>

  <p>"We shall see," was all that Sanders said when the experiment failed. He
  took a hypodermic syringe and filled the little tube with a solution of
  strychnine. This he jabbed unceremoniously into the patient's back. In a
  minute the corpse sat up, jerkily.</p>

  <p>"Ha!" said Sanders, cheerfully, "I am evidently a great magician!" He rose
  to his feet, dusted his knees, and beckoned the sergeant.</p>

  <p>"Take four men and return to the place where you left Tembeli. If the
  leopards have not taken him, you will meet him on the road, because by this
  time he will have waked up." He saw the party march off, then turned his
  attention to M'Lino.</p>

  <p>"My woman," he said, "it is evident to me that you are a witch, although I
  have met your like before"&mdash;it was observed that the face of Sanders was
  very white. "I cannot flog you, because you are a woman, but I can kill
  you."</p>

  <p>She laughed. Their eyes met in a struggle for mastery, and so they stared
  at one another for a space of time which seemed to Sanders a thousand years,
  but which was in all probability less than a minute.</p>

  <p>"It would be better if you killed yourself," she said.</p>

  <p>"I think so," said Sanders dully, and fumbled for his revolver.</p>

  <p>It was half drawn, his thumb on the hammer, when a rifle banged in the
  bushes and the woman fell forward without a word. Ahmid, the Houssa, was ever
  a bad shot.</p>

  <p>"I believe," said Sanders, later, "that you took your rifle to kill me,
  being under the influence of M'Lino, so I will make no bad report against
  you."</p>

  <p>"Master," said the Houssa simply, "I know nothing of the matter."</p>

  <p>"That I can well believe," 'said Sanders, and gave the order to march.</p>

     name="chap11">XI. &mdash; THE WITCH-DOCTOR</a></h2>

  <h3>First published as "The Devil Man"<br>
  in <i>The Weekly Tale-Teller</i>, Mar 18, 1911</h3>

  <p class="first">NOTHING surprised Sanders except the ignorance of the
  average stay-at-home Briton on all matters pertaining to the savage peoples
  of Africa. Queer things happened in the "black patch"&mdash;so the coast
  officials called. Sanders' territory&mdash;miraculous, mysterious things, but
  Sanders was never surprised. He had dealings with folks who believed in
  ghosts and personal devils, and he sympathized with them, realizing that it
  is very difficult to ascribe all the evils of life to human agencies.</p>

  <p>Sanders was an unquiet man; or so his constituents thought him, and a
  little mad; this also was the native view. Worst of all, there was no method
  in his madness.</p>

  <p>Other commissioners might be depended upon to arrive after the rains,
  sending word ahead of their coming. This was a good way&mdash;the Isisi, the
  Ochori, and the N'Gombi people, everlastingly at issue, were agreed upon
  this&mdash;because, with timely warning of the Commissioner's approach, it
  was possible to thrust out of sight the ugly evidence of fault, to clean up
  and make tidy the muddle of folly.</p>

  <p>It was bad to step sheepishly forth from your hut into the clear light of
  the rising sun, with all the debris of an overnight feast mutely testifying
  to your discredit, and face the cold, unwavering eyes of a little brown-faced
  man in immaculate white. The switch he carried in his hand would be smacking
  his leg suggestively, and there were always four Houssa soldiers in blue and
  scarlet in the background, immobile, but alert, quick to obey.</p>

  <p>Once Sanders came to a N'Gombi village at dawn, when by every known
  convention he should have been resting in his comfortable bungalow some three
  hundred miles down river.</p>

  <p>Sanders came strolling through the village street just as the sun topped
  the trees and long shadows ran along the ground before the flood of
  lemon-coloured light.</p>

  <p>The village was silent and deserted, which was a bad sign, and spoke of
  overnight orgies. Sanders walked on until he came to the big square near the
  palaver house, and there the black ruin of a dead fire smoked sullenly.</p>

  <p>Sanders saw something that made him go raking amongst the embers.</p>

  <p>"Pah!" said Sanders, with a wry face.</p>

  <p>He sent back to the steamer for the full force of his Houssa guard, then
  he walked into the chief's hut and kicked him till he woke.</p>

  <p>He came out blinking and shivering, though the morning was warm.</p>

  <p>"Telemi, son of O'ari," said Sanders, "tell me why I should not hang
  you&mdash;maneater and beast."</p>

  <p>"Lord," said the chief, "we chopped this man because he was an enemy,
  stealing into the village at night, and carrying away our goats and our dogs.
  Besides which, we did not know that you were near by."</p>

  <p>"I can believe that," said Sanders.</p>

  <p>A lo-koli beat the villages to wakefulness, and before a silent assembly
  the headman of the N'Gombi village was scientifically flogged.</p>

  <p>Then Sanders called the elders together and said a few words of cheer and
  comfort.</p>

  <p>"Only hyenas and crocodiles eat their kind," he said, "also certain
  fishes." (There was a general shudder, for amongst the N'Gombi to be likened
  to a fish is a deadly insult.) "Cannibals I do not like, and they are hated
  by the King's Government. Therefore when it comes to my ears&mdash;and I have
  many spies&mdash;that you chop man, whether he be enemy or friend, I will
  come quickly and I will flog sorely; and if it should again happen I will
  bring with me a rope, and I will find me a tree, and there will be broken
  huts in this land." Again they shuddered at the threat of the broken hut, for
  it is the custom of the N'Gombi to break down the walls of a dead man's house
  to give his spirit free egress.</p>

  <p>Sanders carried away with him the chief of the village, with leg-irons at
  his ankles, and in course of time the prisoner arrived at a little labour
  colony on the coast, where he worked for five years in company with other
  indiscreet headmen who were suffering servitude for divers offences.</p>

  <p>They called Sanders in the Upper River districts by a long and sonorous
  name, which may be euphemistically translated as "The man who has a faithless
  wife," the little joke of Bosambo, chief of the Ochori, and mightily subtle
  because Sanders was wedded to his people.</p>

  <p>North and south, east and west, he prowled. He travelled by night and by
  day.</p>

  <p>Sometimes his steamer would go threshing away up river, and be watched out
  of sight by the evil-doing little fishing-villages.</p>

  <p>"Go you," said Sarala, who was a little headman of the Akasava, "go you
  three hours' journey in your canoe and watch the river for Sandi's return.
  And at first sign of his steamer&mdash;which you may see if you climb the
  hill at the river's bend&mdash;come back and warn me, for I desire to follow
  certain customs of my father in which Sandi has no pleasure." He spoke to two
  of his young men and they departed. That night by the light of a fire, to the
  accompaniment of dancing and drum-beating, the son of the headman brought his
  firstborn, ten hours old, squealing noisily, as if with knowledge of the doom
  ahead, and laid it at his father's feet.</p>

  <p>"People," said the little chief, "it is a wise saying of all, and has been
  a wise saying since time began, that the firstborn has a special virtue; so
  that if we sacrifice him to sundry gods and devils, good luck will follow us
  in all our doings." He said a word to the son, who took a broad-bladed spear
  and began turning the earth until he had dug a little grave. Into this,
  alive, the child was laid, his little feet kicking feebly against the loose
  mould.</p>

  <p>"Oh, gods and devils," invoked the old man, "we shed no blood, that this
  child may come to you unblemished." The son stirred a heap of loose earth
  with his foot, so that it fell over the baby's legs; then into the light of
  the fire stepped Sanders, and the chief's son fell back.</p>

  <p>Sanders was smoking a thin cigar, and he smoked for fully a minute without
  saying a word, and a minute was a very long time. Then he stepped to the
  grave, stooped, and lifted the baby up awkwardly, for he was more used to
  handling men than babes, gave it a little shake to clear it of earth, and
  handed it to a woman.</p>

  <p>"Take the child to its mother," he said, "and tell her to send it to me
  alive in the morning, otherwise she had best find a new husband." Then he
  turned to the old chief and his son.</p>

  <p>"Old man," he said, "how many years have you to live?"</p>

  <p>"Master," said the old man, "that is for you to say." Sanders scratched
  his chin reflectively, and the old man watched him with fear in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"You will go to Bosambo, chief of the Ochori, telling him I have sent you,
  and you shall till his garden, and carry his water until you die," said
  Sanders.</p>

  <p>"I am so old that that will be soon," said the old man.</p>

  <p>"If you were younger it would be sooner," said Sanders. "As for your son,
  we will wait until the morning." The Houssas in the background marched the
  younger man to the camp Sanders had formed down river&mdash;the boat that had
  passed had been intended to deceive a chief under suspicion&mdash;and in the
  morning, when the news came that the child was dead&mdash;whether from shock,
  or injury, or exposure, Sanders did not trouble to inquire&mdash;the son of
  the chief was hanged.</p>

  <p>I tell these stories of Sanders of the River, that you may grasp the type
  of man he was and learn something of the work he had to do. If he was quick
  to punish, he acted in accordance with the spirit of the people he governed,
  for they had no memory; and yesterday, with its faults, its errors and its
  teachings, was a very long time ago, and a man resents an unjust punishment
  for a crime he has forgotten.</p>

  <p>It is possible to make a bad mistake, but Sanders never made one, though
  he was near to doing so once.</p>

  <p>Sanders was explaining his point of view in regard to natives to Professor
  Sir George Carsley, when that eminent scientist arrived unexpectedly at
  headquarters, having been sent out by the British Government to study
  tropical disease at first hand.</p>

  <p>Sir George was a man of some age, with a face of exceptional pallor and a
  beard that was snowy white.</p>

  <p>"There was a newspaper man who said I treated my people like dogs," said
  Sanders slowly, for he was speaking in English, a language that was seldom
  called for. "I believe I do. That is to say, I treat them as if they were
  real good dogs, not to be petted one minute and kicked the next; not to be
  encouraged to lie on the drawing-room mat one day, and the next cuffed away
  from the dining-room hearthrug." Sir George made no answer. He was a silent
  man, who had had some experience on the coast, and had lived for years in the
  solitude of a Central African province, studying the habits of the malarial
  mosquito.</p>

  <p>Sanders was never a great conversationalist, and the three days the
  professor spent at headquarters were deadly dull ones for the
  Commissioner.</p>

  <p>On one subject alone did the professor grow talkative.</p>

  <p>"I want to study the witch-doctor," he said. "I think there is no
  appointment in the world that would give me a greater sense of power than my
  appointment by a native people to that post." Sanders thought the scientist
  was joking, but the other returned to the subject again and again, gravely,
  earnestly, and persistently, and for his entertainment Sanders recited all
  the stories he had ever heard of witch-doctors and their tribe.</p>

  <p>"But you don't expect to learn anything from these people?" said Sanders,
  half in joke.</p>

  <p>"On the contrary," said the professor, seriously; "I anticipate making
  valuable scientific discoveries through my intercourse with them."</p>

  <p>"Then you're a silly old ass," said Sanders; but he said it to
  himself.</p>

  <p>The pale professor left him at the end of the fourth day, and beyond an
  official notification that he had established himself on the border, no
  further news came of the scientist for six months, until one evening came the
  news that the pale-faced old man had been drowned by the upsetting of a
  canoe. He had gone out on a solitary excursion, taking with him some
  scientific apparatus, and nothing more was heard of him until his birch-bark
  canoe was discovered, bottom up, floating on the river.</p>

  <p>No trace of Sir George was found, and in the course of time Sanders
  collected the dead man's belongings and forwarded them to England.</p>

  <p>There were two remarkable facts about this tragedy, the first being that
  Sanders found no evidence either in papers or diaries, of the results of any
  scientific research work performed by the professor other than a small
  note-book. The second was, that in his little book the scientist had
  carefully recorded the stories Sanders had told him of witch doctors.</p>

  <p>(Sanders recognized at least one story which he had himself invented on
  the spur of the moment for the professor's entertainment.) Six more or less
  peaceful months passed, and then began the series of events which make up the
  story of the Devil Man.</p>

  <p>It began on the Little River.</p>

  <p>There was a woman of the Isisi people who hated her husband, though he was
  very good to her, building her a hut and placing an older wife to wait upon
  her. He gave her many presents, including a great neck-ring of brass,
  weighing pounds, that made her the most envied woman on the Isisi River. But
  her hatred for her husband was unquenched; and one morning she came out from
  her hut, looking dazed and frightened, and began in a quavering voice to sing
  the Song of the Dead, mechanically pouring little handfuls of dust on her
  head, and the villagers went in, to find the man stark and staring, with a
  twisted grin on his dead face and the pains of hell in his eyes.</p>

  <p>In the course of two days they burned the husband in the Middle River; and
  as the canoe bearing the body swept out of sight round a bend of the river,
  the woman stepped into the water and laved the dust from her grimy body and
  stripped the green leaves of mourning from her waist. Then she walked back to
  the village with a light step, for the man she hated best was dead and there
  was an end to it.</p>

  <p>Four days later came Sanders, a grim little man, with a thin, brown face
  and hair inclined to redness.</p>

  <p>"M'Fasa," he said, standing at the door of her hut and looking down at
  her, as with a dogged simulation of indifference she pounded her grain, "they
  tell me your man has died."</p>

  <p>"Lord, that is true." she said. "He died of a sudden sickness."</p>

  <p>"Too sudden for my liking." said Sanders, and disappeared into the dark
  interior of the hut. By and by Sanders came back into the light and looked
  down on her. In his hand was a tiny glass phial, such as Europeans know very
  well, but which was a remarkable find in a heathen village.</p>

  <p>"I have a fetish." he said, "and my fetish has told me that you poisoned
  your husband, M'Fasa."</p>

  <p>"Your fetish lies," she said, not looking up.</p>

  <p>"I will not argue that matter," said Sanders wisely, for he had no proofs
  beyond his suspicions; and straightway he summoned to him the chief man of
  the village.</p>

  <p>There was a little wait, the woman pounding her corn slowly, with downcast
  eyes, pausing now and then to wipe the sweat from her forehead with the back
  of her hand, and Sanders, his helmet on the back of his head, a half-smoked
  cheroot in his mouth, hands thrust deep into his duck-pockets and an annoyed
  frown on his face, looking at her.</p>

  <p>By and by came the chief tardily, having been delayed by the search for a
  soldier's scarlet coat, such as he wore on great occasions.</p>

  <p>"Master, you sent for me," he said.</p>

  <p>Sanders shifted his gaze.</p>

  <p>"On second thoughts," he said, "I do not need you." The chief went away
  with whole thanksgiving service in his heart, for there had been certain
  secret doings on the river for which he expected reprimand.</p>

  <p>"M'Fasa, you will go to my boat," said Sanders, and the woman, putting
  down her mortar, rose and went obediently to the steamer. Sanders followed
  slowly, having a great many matters to consider. If he denounced this woman
  to the elders of the village, she would be stoned to death; if he carried her
  to headquarters and tried her, there was no evidence on which a conviction
  might be secured. There was no place to which he could deport her, yet to
  leave her would be to open the way for further mischief.</p>

  <p>She awaited him on the deck of the Zaire, a straight, shapely girl of
  eighteen, fearless, defiant.</p>

  <p>"M'Fasa," said Sanders, "why did you kill your husband?"</p>

  <p>"Lord, I did not kill him; he died of the sickness." she said, as doggedly
  as before.</p>

  <p>Sanders paced the narrow deck, his head on his breast, for this was a
  profound problem. Then he looked up.</p>

  <p>"You may go." he said; and the woman, a little puzzled, walked along the
  plank that connected the boat with the shore, and disappeared into the
  bush.</p>

  <p>Three weeks later his spies brought word that men were dying unaccountably
  on the Upper River. None knew why they died, for a man would sit down strong
  and full of cheer to his evening meal, and lo! in the morning, when his
  people went to wake him, he would be beyond waking, being most unpleasantly
  dead. This happened in many villages on the Little River.</p>

  <p>"It's getting monotonous," said Sanders to the captain of the Houssas.
  "There is some wholesale poisoning going on, and I am going up to find the
  gentleman who dispenses the dope." It so happened that the first case
  claiming investigation was at Isisi City. It was a woman who had died, and
  this time Sanders suspected the husband, a notorious evil-doer.</p>

  <p>"Okali," he said, coming to the point, "why did you poison your wife?"</p>

  <p>"Lord," said the man, "she died of the sickness. In the evening she was
  well, but at the dark hour before sun came she turned in her sleep saying
  'Bah! oh!' and straightway she died."</p>

  <p>Sanders drew a long breath. "Get a rope," he said to one of his men, and
  when the rope arrived Abiboo scrambled up to the lower branch of a copal-gum
  and scientifically lashed a block and tackle.</p>

  <p>"Okali," said Sanders, "I am going to hang you for the murder of your
  wife, for I am a busy man and have no time to make inquiries; and if you are
  not guilty of her murder, yet there are many other abominable deeds you have
  been guilty of, therefore I am justified in hanging you."</p>

  <p>The man was grey with terror when they slipped the noose over his neck and
  strapped his hands behind him.</p>

  <p>"Lord, she was a bad wife to me and had many lovers," he stammered. "I did
  not mean to kill her, but the Devil Man said that such medicine would make
  her forget her lovers&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Devil Man! What Devil Man?" asked Sanders quickly.</p>

  <p>"Lord, there is a devil greatly respected in these parts, who wanders in
  the forest all the time and gives many curious medicines."</p>

  <p>"Where is he to be found?"</p>

  <p>"Lord, none know. He comes and goes, like a grey ghost, and he has a
  fetish more powerful than a thousand ordinary devils. Master, I gave the
  woman, my wife, that which he gave to me, and she died. How might I know that
  she would die?"</p>

  <p>"Cheg'li," said Sanders shortly to the men at the rope-end, and cheg'li in
  the dialect of the River means "pull."</p>

  <p>"Stop!" Sanders was in a changeable mood, and a little irritable by reason
  of the fact that he knew himself to be fickle.</p>

  <p>"How came this drug to you? In powder, in liquid, or&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The man's lips were dry. He could do no more than shake his head
  helplessly.</p>

  <p>"Release him," said Sanders, and Abiboo loosened the noose and unstrapped
  the man's hands.</p>

  <p>"If you have lied to me," said Sanders, "you die at sunset. First let me
  hear more of this Devil Man, for I am anxious to make his acquaintance." He
  gave the man ten minutes to recover from the effects of his fear, then sent
  for him.</p>

  <p>"Lord," said he; "I know nothing of the Devil Man save that he is the
  greatest witch-doctor in the world, and on nights when the moon is up and
  certain stars are in their places he comes like a ghost, and we are all
  afraid. Then those of us who need him go forth into the forest, and he gives
  to us according to our desires."</p>

  <p>"How carried he the drug?"</p>

  <p>"Lord, it was in a crystal rod, such as white men carry their medicines
  in. I will bring it to you." He went back to his hut and returned a few
  minutes later with a phial, the fellow to that which was already in Sanders'
  possession. The Commissioner took it and smelt at the opening. There was the
  faintest odour of almonds, and Sanders whistled, for he recognized the
  after-scent of cyanide of potassium, which is not such a drug as untutored
  witch-doctors know, much less employ.</p>

  <p>"I can only suggest," wrote Sanders to headquarters, "that by some
  mischance the medicine chest of the late Sir George Carsley has come into the
  possession of a native 'doctor.' You will remember that the chest was with
  the professor when he was drowned. It has possibly been washed up and
  discovered...In the meantime, I am making diligent inquiries as to the
  identity of the Devil Man, who seems to have leapt into fame so suddenly."
  There were sleepless nights ahead for Sanders, nights of swift marchings and
  doublings, of quick runs up the river, of unexpected arrivals in villages, of
  lonely vigils in the forest and by strange pools. But he had no word of the
  Devil Man, though he learnt many things of interest. Most potent of his
  magical possessions was a box, "so small," said one who had seen it, and
  indicated a six-inch square. In this box dwelt a small and malicious god who
  pinched and scratched (yet without leaving a mark), who could stick needles
  into the human body and never draw blood.</p>

  <p>"I give it up," said Sanders in despair, and went back to his base to
  think matters out.</p>

  <p>He was sitting at dinner one night, when far away on the river the drum
  beat. It was not the regular lo-koli roll, but a series of staccato tappings,
  and, stepping softly to the door, the Commissioner listened.</p>

  <p>He had borrowed the Houssa signalling staff from headquarters, and
  stationed them at intervals along the river. On a still night the tapping of
  a drum carries far, but the rattle of iron-wood sticks on a hollowed
  tree-trunk carries farthest of all.</p>

  <p>"Clok-clok, clockitty-clock." It sounded like the far-away croaking of a
  bull-frog; but Sanders picked out the letters: "Devil Man sacrifices tomorrow
  night in the Forest of Dreams." As he jotted down the message on the white
  sleeve of his jacket, Abiboo came running up the path.</p>

  <p>"I have heard," said Sanders briefly. "There is steam in the pucapuc?"</p>

  <p>"We are ready, master," said the man.</p>

  <p>Sanders waited only to take a hanging revolver from the wall and throw his
  overcoat over his arm, for his travelling kit was already deposited on the
  Zaire, and had been for three days.</p>

  <p>In the darkness the sharp nose of his little boat swung out to the stream,
  and ten minutes after the message came the boat was threshing a way against
  the swift river.</p>

  <p>All night long the steamer went on, tacking from bank to bank to avoid the
  shoals. Dawn found her at a wooding, where her men, working at fever speed,
  piled logs on her deck until she had the appearance of a timber-boat.</p>

  <p>Then off again, stopping only to secure news of the coming sacrifice from
  the spies who were scattered up and down the river.</p>

  <p>Sanders reached the edge of the Dream Forest at midnight and tied up. He
  had ten Houssa policemen with him, and at the head of these he stepped ashore
  into the blackness of the forest. One of the soldiers went ahead to find the
  path and keep it, and in single file the little force began its two-hour
  march. Once they came upon two leopards fighting; once they stumbled over a
  buffalo sleeping in their path. Twice they disturbed strange beasts that
  slunk into the shadows as they passed, and came snuffling after them, till
  Sanders flashed a white beam from his electric lamp in their direction.
  Eventually they came stealthily to the place of sacrifice.</p>

  <p>There were at least six hundred people squatting in a semi-circle before a
  rough altar built of logs. Two huge fires blazed and crackled on either side
  of the altar; but Sanders' eyes were for the Devil Man, who leant over the
  body of a young girl, apparently asleep, stretched upon the logs.</p>

  <p>Once the Devil Man had worn the garb of civilization; now he was clothed
  in rags. He stood in his grimy shirt-sleeves, his white beard wild and
  uncombed, his pale face tense, and a curious light in his eyes. In his hand
  was a bright scalpel, and he was speaking&mdash;and, curiously enough, in
  English.</p>

  <p>"This, gentlemen," said he, leaning easily against the rude altar, and
  speaking with the assurance of one who had delivered many such lectures, "is
  a bad case of trynosomiasis. You will observe the discoloration of skin, the
  opalescent pupils, and now that I have placed the patient under anaesthetics
  you will remark the misplacement of the cervical glands, which is an
  invariable symptom." He paused and looked benignly around.</p>

  <p>"I may say that I have lived for a great time amongst native people. I
  occupied the honourable position of witch-doctor in Central Africa&mdash;" He
  stopped and passed his hand across his brow, striving to recall something;
  then he picked up the thread of his discourse.</p>

  <p>All the time he spoke the half-naked assembly sat silent and awe-stricken,
  comprehending nothing save that the witch-doctor with the white face, who had
  come from nowhere and had done many wonderful things&mdash;his magic box
  proved to be a galvanic battery&mdash;was about to perform strange rites.</p>

  <p>"Gentlemen," the old man went on, tapping the breast of his victim with
  the handle of his scalpel, "I shall make an incision&mdash;" Sanders came
  from his place of concealment, and walked steadily towards the extemporized
  operating-table.</p>

  <p>"Professor," he said gently, and the madman looked at him with a puzzled
  frown.</p>

  <p>"You are interrupting the clinic," he said testily, "I am
  demonstrating&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I know, sir." Sanders took his arm, and Sir George Carsley, a great
  scientist, consulting surgeon to St Mark's Hospital, London, and the author
  of many books on tropical diseases, went with him like a child.</p>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Weekly Tale-Teller</i>, October 14, 1911<br>
  Reprinted in <i>All-Round Magazine</i>, April 1916</h3>

  <p class="first">MR COMMISSIONER SANDERS had lived so long with native people
  that he had absorbed not a little of their simplicity. More than this, he had
  acquired the uncanny power of knowing things which he would not and could not
  have known unless he were gifted with the prescience which is every
  aboriginal's birthright.</p>

  <p>He had sent three spies into the Isisi country&mdash;which lies a long way
  from headquarters and is difficult of access&mdash;and after two months of
  waiting they came to him in a body, bearing good news.</p>

  <p>This irritated Sanders to an unjustifiable degree.</p>

  <p>"Master, I say to you that the Isisi are quiet," protested one of the
  spies; "and there is no talk of war."</p>

  <p>"H'm!" said Sanders, ungraciously. "And you?" He addressed the second
  spy.</p>

  <p>"Lord," said the man, "I went into the forest, to the border of the land,
  and there is no talk of war. Chiefs and headmen told me this."</p>

  <p>"Truly you are a great spy," scoffed Sanders, "and how came you to the
  chiefs and headmen? And how did they greet you? 'Hail! secret spy of Sandi'?
  Huh!" He dismissed the men with a wave of his hand, and putting on his helmet
  went down to the Houssa lines, where the blue-coated soldiers gambled in the
  shade of their neat white barracks.</p>

  <p>The Houssa captain was making palatable medicine with the aid of a book of
  cigarette papers and a six-ounce bottle of quinine sulphide.</p>

  <p>Sanders observed his shaking hand, and talked irritably.</p>

  <p>"There's trouble in the Isisi," he said, "I can smell it. I don't know
  what it is&mdash;but there's devilry of sorts."</p>

  <p>"Secret societies?" suggested the Houssa.</p>

  <p>"Secret grandmothers," snarled Sanders. "How many men have you got?"</p>

  <p>"Sixty, including the lame 'uns," said the Houssa officer, and swallowed a
  paperful of quinine with a grimace.</p>

  <p>Sanders tapped the toe of his boot with this thin ebony stick, and was
  thoughtful.</p>

  <p>"I may want 'em" he said. "I'm going to find out what's wrong with these
  Isisi people."</p>

  <p>By the little river that turns abruptly from the River of Spirits, Imgani,
  the Lonely One, built a house. He built it in proper fashion, stealing the
  wood from a village five miles away. In this village there had been many
  deaths, owing to The Sickness; and it is the custom on the Upper River that
  whenever a person dies, the house wherein he died shall die also.</p>

  <p>No man takes shelter under the accursed roof whereunder the Spirit sits
  brooding; the arms of the dead man are broken and scattered on his shallow
  grave, and the cooking-pots of his wives are there likewise.</p>

  <p>By and by, under the combined influences of wind and rain, the reed roof
  sags and sinks, the doorposts rot; elephant-grass, coarse and strong, shoots
  up between crevices in wall and roof; then come a heavier rain and a heavier
  wind, and the forest has wiped the foul spot clean.</p>

  <p>Imgani, who said he was of the N'Gombi people, and was afraid of no
  devils&mdash;at any rate, no Isisi devil&mdash;stole doorposts and native
  rope fearlessly. He stole them by night, when the moon was behind the trees,
  and mocked the dead spirits, calling them by evil and tantalizing names.</p>

  <p>Yet he went cautiously to work; for whilst he did not hold spirits in
  account, he was wholesomely respectful of the live Isisi, who would have put
  him to death had his sacrilege been detected, though, strangely enough, death
  was the thing he feared least.</p>

  <p>So he stole the accursed supports and accursed roof-props, and would have
  stolen the roofs as well, but for the fact that they were very old and full
  of spiders.</p>

  <p>All these things he came and took, carrying them five miles to the turn of
  the river, and there, at his leisure, he built a little house. In the daytime
  he slept, in the night he trapped beasts and caught fish, but he made no
  attempt to catch the big bats that come over from the middle island of the
  river, though these are very edible, and regarded as a delicacy.</p>

  <p>One day, just before the sun went down, he went into the forest on the
  track of zebra. He carried two big hunting-spears, such as the N'Gombi make
  best; a wickerwork shield, and on his back, slung by a strip of hide, a bunch
  of dried fish he had caught in the river.</p>

  <p>A man of middle height was Imgani, spare of build, but broad of shoulder.
  His skin shone healthily, and his step was light. As he walked, you saw the
  muscles of his back ripple and weave like the muscles of a well-trained
  thoroughbred.</p>

  <p>He was half an hour's journey within the forest, when he came upon a girl.
  She was carrying a bundle of manioc root on her head, and walked
  gracefully.</p>

  <p>When she saw Imgani she stopped dead, and the fear of death and worse came
  in her eyes, for she knew him to be an outcast man, with no tribe and no
  people.</p>

  <p>Such men are more dreadful than the ingali, who rears up from the grass
  and plunges his poison-fangs in your leg.</p>

  <p>They stood watching one another, the man leaning with both hands on the
  spears, his cheek against them; the girl trembled.</p>

  <p>"Woman, where do you go?" said Imgani.</p>

  <p>"Master, I go to the village which is by the river, this being the path,"
  she flurried.</p>

  <p>"What have you there?"</p>

  <p>"Manioc, for bread," she whispered thickly.</p>

  <p>"You are a root-eater," said Imgani, nodding his head.</p>

  <p>"Master, let me go," she said, staring at him.</p>

  <p>Imgani jerked his head.</p>

  <p>"I see you are afraid of me&mdash;yet I want nothing from you," he said.
  "I am Imgani, which means the Lonely One; and I have no desire for wives or
  women, being too high a man for such folly. You are safe, root-eater, for if
  I wished I would fill this forest with the daughters of chiefs, all very
  beautiful, all moaning for me." The girl's fear had disappeared, and she
  looked at him curiously. Moreover, she recognized that there was truth in his
  claim of austerity.</p>

  <p>Possibly she was a little piqued, for she said tartly enough, employing an
  Isisi proverb; "Only the goat bleats at the mouth of the leopard's
  cave&mdash;the Isisi grow fat on strangers."</p>

  <p>He looked at her, his head cocked on one side.</p>

  <p>"They say in the lower country that the Isisi sell men to the Arabi," he
  said musingly. "That is bad talk; you may go." With another jerk of his head
  he dismissed her.</p>

  <p>She had gone some little distance when he called her back.</p>

  <p>"Root-eater." he said, "if men ask you who I be, you shall say that I am
  Imgani the Lonely One, who is a prince amongst the princes; also that I have
  killed many men in my day&mdash;so many that I cannot count them. Also say
  that from my house, which I have built by the river, to as far as a man can
  see in every way, is my kingdom, and let none stray therein, except to bring
  gifts in their hands, for I am very terrible and very jealous."</p>

  <p>"Lord," said the girl, "I will say all this." And she went, half running,
  in the direction of the village, leaving Imgani to continue on his way.</p>

  <p>Now this village had many young men eager to please the girl, who carried
  manioc, for she was a chief's daughter, and she was, moreover, fourteen, a
  marriageable age. So when she came flying along the village street, half
  hysterical in her fear, crying, babbling, incoherent, there was not wanting
  sympathy or knight valiant to wipe out the insult.</p>

  <p>Six young men, with spears and short swords, danced before the chief and
  the chief's daughter (how important she felt, any woman of any race will tell
  you), and one of them, E'kebi, a man gifted with language, described from
  sunset to moonrise, which is roughly four hours, exactly what would happen to
  Imgani when the men of the Isisi fell upon him; how his eyes would shrivel as
  before a great and terrible fire, and his limbs wither up, and divers other
  physiological changes which need not be particularized.</p>

  <p>"That is good talk," said the chief; "yet, since Sandi is our master and
  has spies everywhere, do not shed blood, for the smell of blood is carried
  farther than a man can see. And Sandi is very devilish on this question of
  killing. Moreover, this Lonely One is a stranger, and if we catch him we may
  sell him to the Arabi, who will give us cloth and gin for him." Having heard
  all this, they sacrificed a young goat and marched. They came upon the house
  of Imgani, but the Lonely One was not there, for he was trapping beasts in
  the forest; so they burnt his house, uprooted his poor garden, and, being
  joined by many other Isisi people, who had followed at a respectful distance,
  lest Imgani's estimate of his own prowess were justified by results, they
  held high revel, until of a sudden the sun came up over the middle island,
  and all the little stars in the sky went out.</p>

  <p>Imgani saw all this, leaning on his spears in the shadow of the forest,
  but was content to be a spectator.</p>

  <p>For, he reasoned, if he went out against them they would attempt to kill
  him or beat him with rods, and that his high spirit could not endure.</p>

  <p>He saw the flames lick away the house he had built with such labour.</p>

  <p>"They are foolish people," he mused, "for they burn their own, and perhaps
  the spirits of the dead will be displeased and give them boils." When all
  that was left of his habitation was a white heap of ash, a dark-red glow, and
  a hazy wisp of smoke, Imgani turned his face to the forest. All day long he
  walked, halting only to eat the fish he carried, and at night time he came
  upon another Isisi village, which was called O'Fasi.</p>

  <p>He came through the village street with his shoulders squared, his head
  erect, swinging his spears famously. He looked neither to the left nor to the
  right; and the villagers, crowding to the doors of their huts, put their
  clenched knuckles to the mouths, and said; "O hoi" which means that they were
  impressed.</p>

  <p>So he stalked through the entire length of the village, and was making for
  the forest-path beyond, when a messenger came pattering after him.</p>

  <p>"Lord," said the messenger, "the capita of this village, who is
  responsible to the Government for all people who pass, and especially for
  thieves who may have escaped from the Village of Irons, desires your
  presence, being sure that you are no thief, but a great one, and wishing to
  do honour to you." Thus he recited, and being a peaceable man, who had been
  chosen for the part because he was related by marriage to the principal wife
  of the chief, he kept a cautious eye on the broad-headed spear, and
  determined the line of his flight.</p>

  <p>"Go back to your master, slave," said Imgani, "and say to him that I go to
  find a spot of sufficient loneliness, where I may sleep this night and occupy
  myself with high thoughts. When I have found such a place I will return. Say,
  also, that I am a prince of my own people, and that my father has legions of
  such quantity that if every fighting man of the legions were to take a
  handful of sand from the bottom of the river, the river would be bottomless;
  also say that I am named Imgani, and that I love myself better than any man
  has loved himself since the moon went white that it might not look like the
  sun." He went on, leaving the messenger filled with thought.</p>

  <p>True to his promise, Imgani returned.</p>

  <p>He came back to find that there was a palaver in progress, the subject of
  the palaver being the unfortunate relative by marriage to the chief's
  principal wife.</p>

  <p>"Who," the chief was saying, "has put shame upon me, being as great a fool
  as his cousin, my wife."</p>

  <p>"Master," said the poor relation humbly, "I entreated him to return; but
  he was a man of great pride, and, moreover, impatient to go."</p>

  <p>"Your mother was a fool," said the chief; "her mother also was a fool, and
  your father, whoever he was, and no man knows, was a great fool." This
  interesting beginning to a crude address on hereditary folly was interrupted
  by the return of Imgani, and as he came slowly up the little hillock the
  assembly took stock of him, from the square, steel razor stuck in the
  tight-fitting leopard-skin cap to the thin bangles of brass about his
  ankles.</p>

  <p>The chief, a portly man of no great courage, observed the spears, noting
  that the hafts were polished smooth by much handling.</p>

  <p>"Lord," said he mildly, "I am chief of this village, appointed by the
  Government, who gave me a medal to wear about my neck, bearing on one side
  the picture of a great man with a beard, and on the other side certain devil
  marks and writings of vast power. This was given to me that all people might
  know I was chief, but I have lost the medal. None the less, I am chief of
  this village, as this will show." He fumbled in the bosom of his cloth and
  brought out a bag of snake skin, and from this he extracted a very soiled
  paper.</p>

  <p>With tender care he unfolded it, and disclosed a sheet of official
  notepaper with a few scrawled words in the handwriting of Mr Commissioner
  Sanders. They ran; "To all Sub-Commissioners, Police Officers, and Commanders
  of Houssa Ports: Arrest and detain the bearer if found in any other territory
  than the Isisi." There was a history attached to this singular document. It
  had to do with an unauthorized raid upon certain Ochori villages and a
  subsequent trial at headquarters, where a chief, all aquiver with
  apprehension, listened to a terse but knowledgeable prophecy as to what fate
  awaited him if he put foot out of his restricted dominion. Imgani took the
  paper in his hand and was interested. He turned it about, rubbed the writing
  lightly with his fingers to see whether it was permanent, and returned it to
  the chief.</p>

  <p>"That is very wonderful, though I do not fear magic, except an especial
  kind such as is practised by a certain witch-doctor of my father's," he said;
  "nor do I know any government which can govern me." After which he proceeded
  to tell them of his father, and of his legions and wives, and various other
  matters of equal interest.</p>

  <p>"I do not doubt that you will understand me," he said. "I am a Lonely One,
  hating the company of men, who are as changeable as the snow upon the
  mountains. Therefore, I have left my house with my wives, who were faithful
  as women go, and I have taken with me no legion, since they are my
  father's."</p>

  <p>The chief was puzzled. "Why you are lonely, I cannot tell," he said, "but
  certainly you did right to leave your father's legions. This is a great
  matter, which needs a palaver of older men." And he ordered the lo-koli to be
  sounded and the elders of the village to be assembled. They came, bringing
  their own carved stools, and sat about the thatched shelter, where the chief
  sat in his presidency.</p>

  <p>Again Imgani told his story; it was about fifty wives, and legions of
  warriors as countless as the sand of the river's beach; and the trustful
  Isisi listened and believed.</p>

  <p>"And I need this," said Imgani, in his peroration; "a little house built
  on the edge of the river, in such a place that no path passes me and no human
  being comes within sight of me, for I am very lonely by nature&mdash;and a
  great hater of men." Imgani went to live in the clearing Nature had made for
  him, and in a hut erected by his new-found friends. Other hospitalities he
  refused.</p>

  <p>"I have no wish for wives," he stated, "being full of mighty plans to
  recover my kingdom from evil men who are my father's councillors."</p>

  <p>Lonely he was in very truth, for none saw him except on very special
  occasions.</p>

  <p>It was his practice to go hunting by night and to sleep away the hot days.
  Sometimes, when the red ball of the sun dropped down behind the trees on the
  western bank of the river, the villagers saw the straight, blue film of smoke
  as he cooked his evening meal; sometimes a homeward-bound boatman saw him
  slipping silently through the thin edge of the forest on his way to a
  kill.</p>

  <p>They called him the Silent One, and he enjoyed a little fame.</p>

  <p>More than this, he enjoyed the confidence of his hosts. The Isisi country
  is within reach of the Foreign River, down which strangely-shaped boats come
  by night empty, and return by night full of people who are chained neck to
  neck, and the officials of French West Africa&mdash;which adjoins the Isisi
  country&mdash;receive stories of raids and of burnings which they have not
  the facilities for investigating, for the Isisi border is nearly six hundred
  miles from the French headquarters, and lies through a wilderness.</p>

  <p>Imgani, in his hunting trips, saw things which might have filled him with
  amazement, but for the fact that he was a man who was not given to
  emotion.</p>

  <p>He saw little caravans that came stealing from the direction of the
  territory of France, with whimpering women and groaning men in bondage.</p>

  <p>He saw curious midnight shippings of human souls, and grew to know the
  white robed Arabs who handled the whip so deftly.</p>

  <p>One night as he stood watching all these things, El Mahmud, that famous
  trader, espied him in the moonlight and saw that he was of a strange
  people.</p>

  <p>"What man are you?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Lord," said Imgani, "I am of a strange people&mdash;the N'Gombi."</p>

  <p>"That is a lie," said the slaver, "for you have not the face marks of the
  N'Gombi; you are a half-bred Arab," and he addressed him in Arabic.</p>

  <p>Imgani shook his head.</p>

  <p>"He does not understand," said the slaver to his lieutenant; "find out
  where this man's hut is; one night we will take him, for he is worth money."
  He spoke in Arabic, and his subordinate nodded.</p>

  <p>When the slaver came again three men visited Imgani's house, but he was
  hunting, and he was hunting every time the long boats came by night to
  O'Fasi.</p>

  <p>Sanders did not go to O'Fasi for six months, during which time, it should
  be emphasized, nothing happened which by any stretch of imagination could be
  held to justify any loss of prestige.</p>

  <p>He was due to make his half-yearly visit to the Isisi. The crops had been
  good, the fish plentiful, the rains gentle, and there had been no sickness.
  All these facts you may bear in mind.</p>

  <p>One morning, when swirls of grey mist looped from tree to tree and the
  east was growing grey, Imgani came back from the forest bearing on his
  shoulders all that was material of a small buck which he had snared in the
  night.</p>

  <p>When he saw a little fire before his hut and a man squatting chin on knee,
  he twirled those spears of his cheerfully and went on, for he was afraid of
  no man.</p>

  <p>"Is the world so full of people that you come to disturb my loneliness?"
  he asked. "I have a thought that I shall kill you and fry your heart, for I
  do not like to see you sitting by a fire before my hut." He said all this
  with a ferocious mien, and the man before the fire shifted uneasily.</p>

  <p>"Master, I expected this," he said, "for I see you are a proud man; but I
  come because of your pride, knowing your wisdom."</p>

  <p>Imgani tossed the buck to one side and sat down, staring threateningly and
  laying the haft of his spears across his bare knee. Then the other man craned
  his neck forward and spoke eagerly. The sun came up and flushed the world
  rosy; but still he sat talking with great force, Imgani listening.</p>

  <p>"So, master," he concluded, "we will kill Sandi when he comes to palaver.
  Ifiba, M'bwka, and a cousin of my mother's, will put spears into him very
  quickly, and we shall be a great people."</p>

  <p>Imgani nodded his head wisely. "That is true," he said, "people who kill
  white men must be greatly honoured, because all the other nations will say
  'Behold, these are the people who kill white men!'"</p>

  <p>"And when he is dead," the messenger went on, "many young men will go to
  the boat that smokes and slay all who are with him."</p>

  <p>"That is wise also," said Imgani; "when I kill white men I also kill their
  friends." He discussed his deeds to some length and with great detail. After
  the man had gone, Imgani made a meal of fish and manioc, polished the steel
  blades of his spears with wet sand, dried them carefully with grass, and laid
  himself down in the shade of the hut to sleep.</p>

  <p>He was awake in the early part of the afternoon, and went plunging into
  the river, swimming far towards the middle stream with great, strong
  strokes.</p>

  <p>Then he swam back to shore, let the sun dry him, and dressed himself in
  his leopard skin.</p>

  <p>He came to the village slowly, and found it agitated. More especially so
  was the chief, that wise capita, for news had arrived that Sandi was coming
  in the night, and that even now his steamer was rounding the bend of the
  river.</p>

  <p>A plan had miscarried; Sanders was two days ahead of time, and Ifiba and
  M'bwka, his trusty men, were away on an expedition, and there was no time to
  substitute unseasoned assassins.</p>

  <p>The steamer drifted broadside to the shore, one stern wheel revolving
  lazily, and then they saw, Imgani amongst the rest, that the decks were
  crowded with soldiers, impassive brown men in blue uniforms and fezes.</p>

  <p>A plank bumped down, and holding their rifles high the soldiers came
  pattering to the shore, and with them a white officer&mdash;but not Sandi. It
  was a brusque, white man.</p>

  <p>"Who is the chief here?" he said crossly.</p>

  <p>"Lord, I am that man," said the stout chief, all a-flutter.</p>

  <p>"Take that man." A sergeant of Houssas grasped the chief and deftly swung
  him round; a corporal of Houssas snapped a pair of handcuffs on his
  wrists.</p>

  <p>"Lord," he whined, "why this shame?"</p>

  <p>"Because you are a great thief," said the Houssa officer, "a provoker of
  war and a dealer in slaves."</p>

  <p>"If any man says that, it is a lie," said the chief, "for no Government
  man has witnessed such abominations."</p>

  <p>Imgani stepped forward.</p>

  <p>"Chief," he said, "I have seen it."</p>

  <p>"You are a great liar," fumed the portly capita, trembling with rage, "and
  Sandi, who is my friend, will not believe you."</p>

  <p>"I am Sandi," said Imgani, and smiled crookedly.</p>

  <p class="first">THERE are many things that happen in the very heart of
  Africa that no man can explain; that is why those who know Africa best
  hesitate to write stories about it. Because a story about Africa must be a
  mystery story, and your reader of fiction requires that his mystery shall be,
  in the end, X-rayed so that the bones of it are visible.</p>

  <p>You can no more explain many happenings which are the merest commonplaces
  in latitude 2° N., longitude (say) 46° W., than you can explain the miracle
  of faith, or the wonder of telepathy, as this story goes to show.</p>

  <p>In the dead of a night Mr Commissioner Sanders woke.</p>

  <p>His little steamer was tied up by a wooding&mdash;a wooding he had
  prepared for himself years before by lopping down trees and leaving them to
  rot.</p>

  <p>He was one day's steam either up or down the river from the nearest
  village, but he was only six hours' march from the Amatombo folk, who live in
  the very heart of the forest, and employ arrows poisoned by tetanus.</p>

  <p>Sanders sat up in bed and listened.</p>

  <p>A night bird chirped monotonously; he heard the "clug-clug" of water under
  the steamer's bows and the soft rustling of leaves as a gentle breeze swayed
  the young boughs of the trees that overhung the boat. Very intently he
  listened, then reached down for his mosquito boots and his socks.</p>

  <p>He drew them on, found his flannel coat hanging behind the door of his
  tiny cabin, and opened the door softly. Then he waited, standing, his head
  bent.</p>

  <p>In the darkness he grinned unpleasantly, and, thumbing back the leather
  strap that secured the flap of the holster which hung by his bunk he slipped
  out the Colt automatic, and noiselessly pulled back the steel envelope.</p>

  <p>He was a careful man, not easily flurried, and his every movement was
  methodical. He was cautious enough to push up the little safety-catch which
  prevents premature explosion, tidy enough to polish the black barrel on the
  soft sleeve of his coat, and he waited a long time before he stepped out into
  the hot darkness of the night.</p>

  <p>By and by he heard again the sound which had aroused him. It was the faint
  twitter of a weaver bird.</p>

  <p>Now weaver birds go to sleep at nights like sensible people, and they live
  near villages, liking the society of human beings. Certainly they do not
  advertise their presence so brazenly as did this bird, who twittered and
  twittered at intervals.</p>

  <p>Sanders watched patiently.</p>

  <p>Then suddenly, from close at hand, from the very deck on which he stood,
  came an answering call.</p>

  <p>Sanders had his little cabin on the bridge of the steamer; he walked
  farther away from it. In the corner of the bridge he crouched down, his thumb
  on the safety catch.</p>

  <p>He felt, rather than saw, a man come from the forest; he knew that there
  was one on board the steamer who met him. Then creeping round the deck-house
  came two men. He could just discern the bulk of them as they moved forward
  till they found the door of the cabin and crept in. He heard a little noise,
  and grinned again, though he knew that their spearheads were making sad havoc
  of his bedclothes.</p>

  <p>Then there was a little pause, and he saw one come out by himself and look
  around.</p>

  <p>He turned to speak softly to the man inside.</p>

  <p>Sanders rose noiselessly.</p>

  <p>The man in the doorway said "Kah!" in a gurgling voice and went down
  limply, because Sanders had kicked him scientifically in the stomach, which
  is a native's weak spot. The second man ran out, but fell with a crash over
  the Commissioner's extended leg, and, falling, received the full weight of a
  heavy pistol barrel in the neighbourhood of his right ear.</p>

  <p>"Yoka!" called Sanders sharply, and there was a patter of feet aft, for
  your native is a light sleeper, "tie these men up. Get steam, for we will go
  away from here; it is not a nice place." Sanders, as I have tried to explain,
  was a man who knew the native; he thought like a native, and there were
  moments when he acted not unlike a barbarian.</p>

  <p>Clear of the danger, he tied up to a little island in mid-stream just as
  the dawn spread greyly, and hustled his two prisoners ashore.</p>

  <p>"My men," said he, "you came to kill me in the dark hours."</p>

  <p>"Lord, that is true," said one, "I came to kill, and this other man, who
  is my brother, told me when to come&mdash;yet it might have been another whom
  he called, for I am but one of many." Sanders accepted the fact that a chain
  of cheerful assassins waited his advent without any visible demonstration of
  annoyance.</p>

  <p>"Now you will tell me," he said, "who gave the word for the killing, and
  why I must die." The man he addressed, a tall, straight youth of the Amatombo
  people, wiped the sweat from his forehead with his manacled hands.</p>

  <p>"Lord, though you chop me," he said, "I will not tell you, for I have a
  great ju-ju, and there are certain fetishes which would be displeased."
  Sanders tried the other man with no greater success. This other was a
  labourer he had taken on at a village four days' journey down stream.</p>

  <p>"Lord, if I die for my silence I will say nothing," he said.</p>

  <p>"Very good," said Sanders, and nodded his head to Abiboo. "I shall stake
  you out," he added, "flat on the ground, your legs and arms outstretched, and
  I will light a little fire on your chests, and by and by you will tell me all
  I want to know." Staked out they were, with fluffy little balls of dried
  creeper on each breast, and Sanders took a lighted stick from the fire his
  servants had built.</p>

  <p>The men on the ground watched his every movement. They saw him blow the
  red stick to a flame and advance toward them, then one said, "Lord, I will
  speak."</p>

  <p>"So I thought." said Sanders; "and speak truth, or I will make you
  uncomfortable." If you ask me whether Sanders would have employed his lighted
  stick, I answer truthfully that I think it possible; perhaps Sanders knew his
  men better than I know Sanders.</p>

  <p>The two men, released from their unhappy position, talked frankly, and
  Sanders was a busy man taking notes in English of the conversation which was
  mainly in Bomongo.</p>

  <p>When his interrogation was completed, Sanders gathered up his notes and
  had the men taken on board the steamer. Two hours later the Zaire was moving
  at its fullest speed in the direction of a village of the Akasava, which is
  called in the native tongue Tukalala.</p>

  <p>There was a missionary to Tukalala, a devoted young American Methodist,
  who had elected to live in the fever belt amongst heathen men that he might
  bring their hearts to the knowledge of God.</p>

  <p>Sanders had no special regard for missionaries; indeed, he had views on
  the brotherhood which did him no particular credit, but he had an affection
  for the young man who laboured so cheerfully with such unpromising material,
  and now he paced the little bridge of his steamer impatiently, for it was
  very necessary that he should reach Tukalala before certain things
  happened.</p>

  <p>He came round a bend of the little river just as the sun was going down
  behind the trees on the western bank, and the white beach before the mission
  station showed clearly.</p>

  <p>He motioned with two fingers to the man at the wheel and the little
  steamer swung almost broadside to the swift stream and headed for the bank,
  and the black water of the river humped up against his port bow as though it
  were a sluice gate.</p>

  <p>Into the beach he steamed; "pucka-pucka-pucka-puck," sang the stern wheel
  noisily.</p>

  <p>Where the missionary's house had stood was a chaos of blackened debris,
  and out of it rose lazy little wisps of smoke.</p>

  <p>He found the missionary dressed in white duck, greatly soiled, lying face
  downwards, and he found some difficulty in raising him, because he was pinned
  to the ground with a broad-bladed elephant spear which had been broken off
  flush with his shoulders.</p>

  <p>Sanders turned him on his back, closed the patient's eyes, staring, it
  seemed, hungrily at the darkening sky as though at the last questioning God's
  wisdom.</p>

  <p>The Commissioner took a gaudy bandana handkerchief from his pocket, and
  laid it on the dead man's face.</p>

  <p>"Abiboo," he said softly to his sergeant, "dig me a great hole by that
  copal gum, for this man was a great chief amongst his people, and had
  communion with gods."</p>

  <p>"He was a Christ man," said Abiboo sagely, who was a devout follower of
  the Prophet, "and in the Sura of Mary it is written: 'The sects have fallen
  to variance about Jesus, but woe, because of the assembly of a great day to
  those who believe not!'" Abiboo bore the title of Haj because he had been to
  Mecca and knew the Koran better than most Christians know the Bible.</p>

  <p>Sanders said nothing. He took a cigar from his pocket and lit it, casting
  his eyes around.</p>

  <p>No building stood. Where the mission station with its trim garden had
  been, was desolation. He saw scraps of cloth in the fading light. These were
  other victims, he knew.</p>

  <p>In the mellow light of the moon he buried the missionary, saying the
  Lord's Prayer over him, and reciting as much of the Burial Service as he
  could remember.</p>

  <p>Then he went back to the Zaire and set a guard. In the morning Sanders
  turned the nose of the Zaire down stream, and at sunset came to the big
  river&mdash;he had been sailing a tributary&mdash;and where the two rivers
  meet is the city of the Akasava.</p>

  <p>They brought a paramount chief of all the people to him, and there was a
  palaver on the little bridge with a lantern placed on the deck and one limp
  candle thereon to give light to the assembly.</p>

  <p>"Chief," said Sanders, "there is a dead white man in your territory, and I
  will have the hearts of the men who killed him, or by The Death I will have
  your head." He said this evenly, without passion, yet he swore by Ewa, which
  means death and is a most tremendous oath.</p>

  <p>The chief, squatting on the deck, fidgeting with his hands, shivered.
  "Lord," he said, in a cracked voice, "this is a business of which I know
  nothing; this thing has happened in my territory, but so far from my hand
  that I can neither punish nor reward." Sanders was silent save for an
  unsympathetic sniff.</p>

  <p>"Also, master," said the chief, "if the truth be told, this palaver is not
  of the Akasava alone, for all along the big river men are rebellious, obeying
  a new ju-ju more mighty than any other."</p>

  <p>"I know little of ju-jus," said Sanders shortly, "only I know that a white
  man has died and his spirit walks abroad and will not rest until I have slain
  men. Whether it be you or another I do not care&mdash;the palaver is
  finished." The chief rose awkwardly, brought up his hand in salute, and went
  shuffling down the sloping plank to land.</p>

  <p>As for Sanders, he sat thinking, smoking one cigar after another. He sat
  long into the night. Once he called his servant to replace the candle in the
  lantern and bring him a cushion for his head. He sat there until the buzzing
  little village hushed to sleep, until there was no sound but the whispering
  of bat wings as they came and went from the middle island&mdash;for bats love
  islands, especially the big vampire bats.</p>

  <p>At two o'clock in the morning he looked at his watch, picked up the
  lantern, and walked aft.</p>

  <p>He picked a way over sleeping men until he came to that part of the deck
  where a Houssa squatted with loaded carbine watching the two prisoners.</p>

  <p>He stirred them gently with his foot, and they sat up blinking at his
  light.</p>

  <p>"You must tell me some more," he said. "How came this bad ju-ju to your
  land?" The man he addressed looked up at him.</p>

  <p>"Lord, how comes rain or wind?" he said. "It was a sudden thought amongst
  the people. There were certain rites and certain dances, and we chopped a
  man; then we all painted our faces with camwood, and the maidens said
  'Kill!'"</p>

  <p>Sanders could be very patient. "I am as your father and your mother," he
  said. "I carry you in my arms; when the waters came up and destroyed your
  gardens I came with manioc and salt and saved you. When the sickness came I
  brought white men who scraped your arms and put magic in your blood; I have
  made peace, and your wives are safe from M'Gombi and Isisi folk, yet you are
  for killing me."</p>

  <p>The other nodded. "That is true talk, master&mdash;but such is the way of
  ju-jus. They are very High Things, and do not remember."</p>

  <p>Sanders was worried; this matter was out of his reach. "What said the
  ju-ju?"</p>

  <p>"Lord, it said very clearly, speaking through the mouth of an old man,
  M'fabaka of Begeli&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"M'fabaka of Begeli?" repeated Sanders softly, and noted the name for a
  speedy hanging.</p>

  <p>"This old man saw a vision, and in this vision, which he saw with great
  pain and foaming at the mouth and hot eyeballs, he saw white men slain by
  black men and their houses burnt."</p>

  <p>"When was this?"</p>

  <p>"When the moon was full"&mdash;six days ago, thought Sanders&mdash;"and he
  saw a great king with many legions marching through the land making all white
  men fear him." He went on to give, as only a native memory can recall, the
  minutest detail of the king's march; how he slew white men and women and put
  their house to flames; how his legions went dancing before him.</p>

  <p>"And all this happened at the full of the moon," he finished; "therefore
  we, too, went out to slay, and, knowing that your Highness would be coming as
  is your custom to give judgment at this season of the year, it was thought
  wise to kill you, also the Christ-man." He told all this in a matter-of-fact
  tone, and Sanders knew that he spoke the truth.</p>

  <p>Another man would have been more affected by that portion of the narrative
  which touched him most nearly, but it was the king ("a great man, very large
  about the middle"), and his devastating legions who occupied the
  Commissioner's thoughts.</p>

  <p>There was truth behind this, he did not doubt that. There was a rising
  somewhere that he had not heard of; very quickly he passed in mental review
  the kings of the adjoining territories and of his own lands.</p>

  <p>Bosambo of Monrovia, that usurper of the Ochori chieftainship, sent him
  from time to time news of the outlying peoples. There was no war, north or
  south or east.</p>

  <p>"I will see this old man M'fabaka of Begeli," he said.</p>

  <p>Begeli is a village that lies on an in-running arm of the river, so narrow
  that it seems like a little river, so still that it is apparently a lake.
  Forests of huge trees slope down on either bank, and the trees are laced one
  to the other with great snake-like tendrils, and skirted at foot with rank
  undergrowth. The Zaire came cautiously down this stretch of calm water, two
  Maxim guns significantly displayed at the bridge.</p>

  <p>A tiny little steamer this Zaire. She had the big blue of England drooping
  from the flagstaff high above the stern wheel&mdash;an ominous sign, for when
  Sanders flew the Commissioner's flag it meant trouble for somebody.</p>

  <p>He stood on the deck coatless, signalling with his raised fingers to the
  man at the wheel.</p>

  <p>"Phew!" An arrow was shivering in the wooden deck-house. He pulled it out
  and examined its hammered steel point carefully, then he threw it
  overboard.</p>

  <p>"Bang!" A puff of smoke from the veiling foliage&mdash;a bullet splintered
  the back of his deck-chair. He reached down and took up a rifle, noticed the
  drift of the smoke and took careful aim.</p>

  <p>"Bang!" There was no sign to show where the bullet struck, and the only
  sound that came back was the echo and the shrill swish of it as it lashed its
  way through the green bushes.</p>

  <p>There was no more shooting.</p>

  <p>'Puck-apuck-puck-apuck-puck,' went the stern wheel slowly, and the bows of
  the Zaire clove the calm waters and left a fan of foam behind. Before the
  village was in view six war canoes, paddling abreast, came out to meet the
  Commissioner. He rang the engines to 'Stop,' and as the noise of them died
  away he could hear in the still air the beating of drums; through his glasses
  he saw fantastically-painted bodies, also a head stuck upon a spear.</p>

  <p>There had been a trader named Ogilvie in this part of the world, a mild,
  uncleanly man who sold cloth and bought wild rubber.</p>

  <p>"Five hundred yards," said Sanders, and Sergeant Abiboo, fiddling with the
  grip of the port Maxim, gave the cartridge belt a little pull, swung the
  muzzle forward, and looked earnestly along the sights. At the same time the
  Houssa corporal, who stood by the tripod of the starboard gun, sat down on
  the little saddle seat of it with his thumb on the control.</p>

  <p>There came a spurt of smoke from the middle canoe; the bullet fell
  short.</p>

  <p>"Ogilvie, my man," soliloquized Sanders, "if you are alive&mdash;which I
  am sure you are not&mdash;you will explain to me the presence of these
  Schneiders." Nearer came the canoes, the paddle plunging rhythmically, a low,
  fierce drone of song accompanying the movement.</p>

  <p>"Four hundred yards," said Sanders, and the men at the Maxims readjusted
  the sights.</p>

  <p>"The two middle canoes," said Sanders. "Fire!" A second pause.</p>

  <p>"Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!" laughed the guns sardonically.</p>

  <p>Sanders watched the havoc through his glasses.</p>

  <p>"The other canoes," he said briefly.</p>

  <p>"Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, hat" This gunner was a careful man, and fired
  spasmodically, desiring to see the effects of his shots.</p>

  <p>Sanders saw men fall, saw one canoe sway and overturn, and the black heads
  of men in the water; he rang the steamer ahead full speed.</p>

  <p>Somebody fired a shot from one of the uninjured canoes. The wind of the
  bullet fanned his face, he heard the smack of it as it struck the woodwork
  behind.</p>

  <p>There came another shot, and the boy at the wheel turned his head with a
  little grin to Sanders.</p>

  <p>"Lord," he mumbled in Arabic, "this was ordained from the beginning."</p>

  <p>Sanders slipped his arm about his shoulder and lowered him gently to the
  deck. "All things are with God," he said softly.</p>

  <p>"Blessed be His name," whispered the dying boy.</p>

  <p>Sanders caught the wheel as it spun and beckoned another steersman
  forward.</p>

  <p>The nose of the steamer had turned to the offending canoe. This was an
  unhappy circumstance for the men therein, for both guns now covered it, and
  they rattled together, and through the blue haze you saw the canoe
  emptied.</p>

  <p>That was the end of the fight. A warrior in the fifth boat held his spear
  horizontally above his head in token of surrender, and ten minutes later the
  chief of the rebels was on board.</p>

  <p>"Master," he said calmly, as they led him to Sanders' presence, "this is a
  bad palaver. How will you deal with me?"</p>

  <p>Sanders looked at him steadily. "I will be merciful with you," he said,
  "for as soon as we come to the village I shall hang you."</p>

  <p>"So I thought," said the chief without moving a muscle; "and I have heard
  it said that you hang men very quickly so that they feel little pain."</p>

  <p>"That is my practice," said Sanders of the River, and the chief nodded his
  head approvingly.</p>

  <p>"I would rather it were so," he said.</p>

  <p>It was to a sorrowful village that he came, for there were many women to
  wail their dead.</p>

  <p>Sanders landed with his Houssas and held a high palaver under the
  trees.</p>

  <p>"Bring me the old man M'fabaka who sees visions," he said, and they
  brought him a man so old that he had nothing but bones to shape him.</p>

  <p>They carried him to the place of justice and set him down before the
  Commissioner.</p>

  <p>"You are an evil man," said Sanders, "and because your tongue has lied
  many men have died; today I hang your chief upon a tree, and with him certain
  others. If you stand before your people and say, 'Such a story, and such a
  story was a lie and no other thing,' you may live your days; but, if you
  persist in your lying, by my God, and your god, you shall die!" It was a long
  time before the old man spoke, for he was very old and very frightened, and
  the fear of death, which is the ghost of some old men, was on him.</p>

  <p>"I spoke the truth," he quavered at last. "I spoke of what I saw and of
  what I knew&mdash;only that." Sanders waited.</p>

  <p>"I saw the great king slay and burn; yesterday I saw him march his
  regiments to war, and there was a great shouting, and I saw smoke." He shook
  his head helplessly. "I saw these things. How can I say I saw nothing?"</p>

  <p>"What manner of king?" asked Sanders.</p>

  <p>Again there was a long interval of silence whilst the old man collected
  himself.</p>

  <p>"A great king," he said shakily, "as big as a bull about the middle, and
  he wore great, white feathers and the skin of a leopard."</p>

  <p>"You are mad," said Sanders, and ended the palaver.</p>

  <p>Six days later Sanders went back to headquarters, leaving behind him a
  chastened people.</p>

  <p>Ill-news travels faster than steam can push a boat, and the little Zaire,
  keeping to midstream with the blue flag flying, was an object of interest to
  many small villages, the people of which crowded down to their beaches and
  stood with folded arms, or with clenched knuckles at their lips to signify
  their perturbation, and shouted in monotonous chorus after the boat.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Sandi&mdash;father! How many evil ones have you slain today? Oh,
  killer of devils&mdash;oh, hanger of trees!&mdash;we are full of virtues and
  do not fear."</p>

  <p>"Ei-fo, Kalaba? Ei ko Sandi! Eiva fo elegi," etc.</p>

  <p>Sanders went with the stream swiftly, for he wished to establish
  communication with his chief. Somewhere in the country there was a
  revolt&mdash;that he knew. There was truth in all the old man had said before
  he died&mdash;for die he did of sheer panic and age.</p>

  <p>Who was this king in revolt? Not the king of the Isisi, or of the M'Gombi,
  nor of the people in the forelands beyond the Ochori.</p>

  <p>The Zaire went swinging in to the Government beach, and there was a
  captain of Houssas to meet him. "Land wire working?" said Sanders as he
  stepped ashore.</p>

  <p>The Houssa captain nodded. "What's the palaver?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"War of a kind," said Sanders; "some king or other is on the rampage." And
  he told the story briefly.</p>

  <p>The Houssa officer whistled. "By Lord High Keeper of the Privy Purse!" he
  swore mildly, "that's funny!"</p>

  <p>"You've a poisonous sense of humour!" Sanders snapped.</p>

  <p>"Hold hard." said the Houssa, and caught his arm. "Don't you know that La
  Benguela is in rebellion? The description fits him."</p>

  <p>Sanders stopped. "Of course." he said, and breathed a sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>"But," said the perplexed Houssa officer, "Matabeleland is three thousand
  miles away. Rebellion started a week ago. How did these beggars know?" For
  answer Sanders beckoned a naked man of the Akasava people who was of his
  boat's crew, being a good chopper of wood.</p>

  <p>"I'fasi." he said, "tell me, what do they do in your country today?"</p>

  <p>The man grinned sheepishly, and stood on one leg in his embarrassment, for
  it was an honour to common men that Sanders should address them by name.
  "Lord, they go to hunt elephant." he said.</p>

  <p>"How many?" said Sanders.</p>

  <p>"Two villages," said the man, "for one village has sickness and cannot
  go."</p>

  <p>"How do you know this?" said Sanders. "Is not your country four days by
  river and three days by land?"</p>

  <p>The man looked uncomfortable. "It is as you say, master&mdash;yet I know,"
  he said.</p>

  <p>Sanders turned to the Houssa with a smile.</p>

  <p>"There is quite a lot to be learnt in this country," he said.</p>

  <p>A month later Sanders received a cutting from the Cape Times. The part
  which interested him ran; "...the rumour generally credited by the Matebele
  rebels that their adherents in the north had suffered a repulse lacks
  confirmation. The Commissioner of Barotseland denies the native story of a
  rebellious tribe, and states that as far as he knows the whole of his people
  have remained quiet. Other northern Commissioners state the same; there has
  been no sympathetic rising, though the natives are emphatic that in a
  'far-away land,' which they cannot define, such a rebellion has occurred. The
  idea is, of course, absurd."</p>

  <p>Sanders smiled again.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="chap14"
     name="chap14">XIV. &mdash; DOGS OF WAR</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Weekly Tale-Teller</i>, July 16, 1910<br>
  Reprinted in <i>All Around Magazine</i>, June 1916</h3>

  <p class="first">CHIEFEST of the restrictions placed upon the black man by
  his white protector is that which prevents him, when his angry passions rise,
  from taking his enemy by the throat and carving him with a broad, curved
  blade of native make. Naturally, even the best behaved of the tribes chafe
  under this prohibition the British have made.</p>

  <p>You may be sure that the Akasava memory is very short, and the punishment
  which attended their last misdoing is speedily forgotten in the opportunity
  and the temptation which must inevitably come as the years progress. Thus,
  the Akasava, learning of certain misdoings on the part of the Ochori, found
  themselves in the novel possession of a genuine grievance, and prepared for
  war, first sending a message to "Sandi," setting forth at some length the
  nature of the insult the Ochori had offered them. Fortunately, Sanders was in
  the district, and came on the spot very quickly, holding palaver, and
  soothing an outraged nation as best he could.</p>

  <p>Sanders was a tactful man, and tact does not necessarily imply
  soft-handedness. For there was a truculent soul who sat in the council and
  interpolated brusque questions.</p>

  <p>Growing bolder as the Commissioner answered suavely, he went, as a child
  or native will, across the border line which divides a good manner from a
  bad. Sanders turned on him.</p>

  <p>"What base-born slave dog are you?" he asked; and whilst the man was
  carefully considering his answer, Sanders kicked him down the slope of the
  hill on which the palaver house stood, and harmony was once more
  restored.</p>

  <p>Very soon on the heels of this palaver came a bitter complaint from the
  Isisi. It concerned fishing nets that had been ruthlessly destroyed by the
  Lulungo folk, and this was a more difficult matter for Sanders to settle. For
  one thing, all self-respecting people hate the Lulungo, a dour, wicked,
  mischievous people, without shame or salt. But the Isisi were pacified, and a
  messy war was averted. There were other and minor alarums&mdash;all these
  were in the days' work&mdash;but Sanders worried about the Lulungo, because
  of their general badness, and because of all his people, Isisi, Ikeli,
  Akasava, and Ochori, who hated the Lulungo folk with a deep-rooted hatred. In
  his own heart, Sanders knew that war could only be postponed, and so advised
  London, receiving in reply, from an agitated Under-Secretary in Whitehall,
  the urgent request that the postponement should cover and extend beyond the
  conclusion of 'the present financial year&mdash;for heaven's sake!' They had
  a proverb up in the Lulungo district&mdash;three days' march beyond the
  Akasava&mdash;and it is to this effect; "When a man hath a secret enemy and
  cannot find him, pull down his own hut and search among the debris." This is
  a cumbersome translation. There is another proverb which says, "Because of
  the enemy who lives in the shadow of your hut;" also another which says, "If
  you cannot find your enemy, kill your dearest friend." The tendency of all
  these proverbs is to show that the Lulungo people took a gloomy view of life,
  and were naturally suspicious.</p>

  <p>Sanders had a cook of the Lulungo tribe, down at M'piti&mdash;which model
  city served as Mr Commissioner's headquarters. He was a wanderer, and by way
  of being a cosmopolitan, having travelled as far north as Dacca, and as far
  south as Banana&mdash;and presumably up the Congo to Matadi. When he came to
  M'piti, applying for work, he was asked his name and replied in the "English"
  of the Coast; "Master, dey one call me Sixpence all'time. I make 'um cook
  fine; you look 'um for better cook, you no find 'um-savvy."</p>

  <p>"And what," said Sanders, in the Lulungo dialect, "what mongrel talk do
  you call this?"</p>

  <p>"Master, it is English," said the abashed native.</p>

  <p>"It is monkey talk," said Sanders, cruelly; 'the talk of krooboys and
  half-bred sailors who have no language. What are you called by your
  people?"</p>

  <p>"Lataki, master," said the cook.</p>

  <p>"So shall you be called," said Sanders. "Further, you shall speak no
  language but your own and your pay will be ten shillings a month." Lataki
  made a good cook, and was a model citizen for exactly three months, at the
  end of which time Sanders, returning unexpectedly from a hunting trip, found
  Lataki asleep in his master's bed&mdash;Lataki being very drunk, and two
  empty gin bottles by the bedside testifying mutely to his discredit. Sanders
  called his police, and Lataki was thrown into the lock-up to sober down,
  which he did in twenty-four hours.</p>

  <p>"I would have you understand," said Sanders to the culprit the next day,
  "that I cannot allow my servants to get drunk; more especially I cannot allow
  my drunken servants to sleep off their potations on my bed."</p>

  <p>"Lord, I am ashamed," said Lataki cheerfully; "such things happen to a man
  who has seen much of the world."</p>

  <p>"You may say the same about the whipping you are about to receive," said
  Sanders, and gave an order to the sergeant of police.</p>

  <p>Lataki was no stoic and when, tied to a tree, ten strokes were laid upon
  his stout back by a bored Houssa, he cried out very loudly against Sanders,
  and against that civilization of which Sanders was the chosen instrument.</p>

  <p>After it was all over, and he had discovered that he was still alive,
  albeit sore, he confessed he had received little more than he deserved, and
  promised tearfully that the lesson should not be without result. Sanders, who
  had nothing more to say in the matter, dismissed him to his duties.</p>

  <p>It was a week after this that the Commissioner was dining in solitude on
  palm-oil chop&mdash;which is a delicious kind of coast curry&mdash;and
  chicken. He had begun his meal when he stopped suddenly, went to his office,
  and brought in a microscope. Then he took a little of the 'chop'&mdash;just
  as much as might go on the end of a pin-smeared it on a specimen glass, and
  focussed the instrument. What he saw interested him. He put away the
  microscope and sent for Lataki, and Lataki, in spotless white, came.</p>

  <p>"Lataki," said Sanders carelessly, "knowing the ways of white men, tell me
  how a master might do his servant honour?" The cook in the doorway
  hesitated.</p>

  <p>"There are many ways," he said, after a pause. "He might&mdash;" He
  stopped, not quite sure of his ground.</p>

  <p>"Because you are a good servant, though possessed of faults," said
  Sanders, "I wish to honour you; therefore I have chosen this way; you, who
  have slept in my bed unbidden, shall sit at my table with me at my
  command."</p>

  <p>The man hesitated, a little bewildered, then he shuffled forward and sat
  clumsily in the chair opposite his master.</p>

  <p>"I will wait upon you," said Sanders, "according to the custom of your own
  people." He heaped two large spoonfuls of palm-oil chop upon the plate before
  the man.</p>

  <p>"Eat," he said.</p>

  <p>But the man made no movement, sitting with his eyes upon the
  tablecloth.</p>

  <p>"Eat," said Sanders again, but still Lataki sat motionless, Then Sanders
  rose, and went to the open doorway of his bungalow and blew a whistle.</p>

  <p>There was a patter of feet, and Sergeant Abiboo came with four
  Houssas.</p>

  <p>"Take this man," said Sanders, "and put him in irons. Tomorrow I will send
  him down country for judgment." He walked back to the table, when the men had
  gone with their prisoner, carefully removed the poisoned dish, and made a
  meal of eggs and bananas, into neither of which is it possible to introduce
  ground glass without running the risk of instant detection.</p>

  <p>Ground glass&mdash;glass powdered so fine that it is like precipitated
  chalk to the touch&mdash;is a bad poison, because when it comes in contact
  with delicate membranes right down inside a man, it lacerates them and he
  dies, as the bad men of the coast know, and have known for hundreds of years.
  In the course of time Lataki came before a judge who sat in a big thatched
  barn of a courthouse, and Lataki brought three cousins, a brother, and a
  disinterested friend, to swear that Sanders had put the glass in his own
  "chop" with malice aforethought. In spite of the unanimity of the
  evidence&mdash;the witnesses had no less than four rehearsals in a little hut
  the night before the trial&mdash;the prisoner was sentenced to fifteen years'
  penal servitude.</p>

  <p>Here the matter would have ended, but for the Lulungo people, who live far
  away in the north, and who chose to regard the imprisonment of their man as a
  casus belli.</p>

  <p>They were a suspicious people, a sullen, loveless, cruel people, and they
  were geographically favoured, for they lived on the edge of a territory which
  is indisputably French, and, moreover, unreachable.</p>

  <p>Sanders sent flying messages to all the white people who lived within
  striking distance of the Lulungo. There were six in all, made up of two
  missions, Jesuit and Baptist. They were most unsatisfactory people, as the
  following letters show. The first from the Protestant:</p>

  <p>"Losebi Mission.</p>

  <p>"DEAR MR COMMISSIONER,&mdash;My wife and I are very grateful to you for
  your warning, but God has called us to this place, and here we must stay;
  going about our Master's business, until He, in His wisdom, ordains that we
  shall leave the scene of our labours."</p>

  <p>Father Holling wrote;</p>

  <p>"Ebendo River</p>

  <p>"DEAR SANDERS,&mdash;I think you are wrong about the Lulungo people,
  several of whom I have seen recently. They are mighty civil, which is the
  only bad sign I have detected. I shall stay because I think I can fight off
  any attack they make. I have four Martini-Metford rifles, and three thousand
  rounds of ammunition, and this house, as you know, is built of stone. I hope
  you are wrong, but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Sanders took his steamboat, his Maxim gun, and his Houssa police, and went
  up the river, as far as the little stern-wheeler would carry him. At the end
  of every day's journey he would come to a place where the forest had been
  cleared, and where, stacked on the beach, was an orderly pile of wood.
  Somewhere in the forest was a village whose contribution to the State this
  ever-replenished wood-pile was. Night and day two sounding men with long
  rods, sitting at the steamer's bow, 'stubbed' the water monotonously. Shoal,
  sandbank, channel, shoal. Sometimes, with a shuddering jar, the boat would
  slide along the flat surface of a hidden bank, and go flop into the deep
  water on the other side; sometimes, in the night, the boat would jump a bank
  to find itself in a little 'lake' from which impassable ridges of hidden sand
  barred all egress. Then the men would slip over the sides of the vessel and
  walk the sandy floor of the river, pushing the steamer into deep water. When
  sixty miles from the Baptist Mission, Sanders got news from a friendly
  native; "Lord, the Lulungo came at early morning, taking away the missionary,
  his wife, and his daughter, to their city." Sanders, yellow with fever,
  heavy-eyed from want of sleep, unshaven and grimy, wiped the perspiration
  from his head with the back of his hand.</p>

  <p>"Take the steamer up the river," he said to Abiboo. "I must sleep." He was
  awakened at four o'clock in the afternoon by the smashing of a water bottle,
  which stood on a shelf by his bunk. It smashed for no apparent reason, and he
  was sprinkled with bits of glass and gouts of water.</p>

  <p>Then he heard a rifle go "pang!" close at hand, and as he sprang up and
  opened the wire woven door of his cabin, Abiboo came to report.</p>

  <p>"There were two men firing from the bank," he said. "One I have shot."
  They were nearing the village now, and turning a sharp bend of the river they
  came in sight of it, and the little Zaire's siren yelled and squealed
  defiantly.</p>

  <p>Sanders saw a crowd of men come down to the beach, saw the glitter of
  spears, and through his glasses the paint on the bodies of the men. Then six
  canoes came racing out to meet the steamer.</p>

  <p>A corporal of Houssas sat down nonchalantly on a little saddle-seat behind
  the brass Maxim, and gripped its handles.</p>

  <p>"Five hundred yards," said Sanders, and the corporal adjusted the sight
  without perceptible hurry.</p>

  <p>The canoes came on at a hurricane speed, for the current was with them.
  The man behind the gun polished a dull place on the brass water-jacket with
  the blue sleeve of his coat, and looked up.</p>

  <p>Sanders nodded.</p>

  <p>The canoes came nearer, one leading the rest in that race where hate
  nerved effort, and death was the prize.</p>

  <p>Suddenly&mdash;"Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!" laughed the little gun sardonically,
  and the leading canoe swung round broadside to the stream, because the men
  who steered it were dead, and half of the oarsmen also.</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha-ha-h-a-a!"</p>

  <p>There was a wild scramble on the second canoe; it swayed, capsized, and
  the river was full of black heads, and the air resounded with shrill
  cries.</p>

  <p>As for the remainder of the flotilla, it swung round and made for safety;
  the machine-gun corporal slipped in another belt of cartridges, and made good
  practice up to nine hundred yards, from which two canoes, frantically
  paddled, were comparatively safe.</p>

  <p>Sanders put his tiny telegraph over to full speed ahead and followed.</p>

  <p>On the shore the Lulungo made a stand, and missiles of many kinds struck
  the little steamer. But the Maxim sprayed the village noisily, and soon there
  came a nervous man waving a palm leaf, and Sanders ceased firing, and shouted
  through his megaphone that the messenger must swim aboard.</p>

  <p>"Lord, we feel great shame," said the man. He stood in a wet place on the
  deck, and little rills of water dripped from him. "We did not know we fought
  Sandi the lion, Sandi the buffalo, before the stamp of whose mighty
  feet&mdash;" Sanders cut him short.</p>

  <p>"There is a white man, a white woman, and a young girl in your city," he
  said. "Bring them to the ship, and then I will sit in the palaver-house, and
  talk this matter over."</p>

  <p>The man shuffled uneasily. "Master." he said, "the white man died of the
  sickness; the woman is ill also; as for the girl, I know nothing."</p>

  <p>Sanders looked at him, his head on one side like an inquisitive bird.</p>

  <p>"Bring me the white man, alive or dead," he said softly; "also the white
  woman, well or ill, and the girl." In an hour they brought the unfortunate
  missionary, having taken some time to make him look presentable. The wife of
  the missionary came in another canoe, four women holding her, because she was
  mad.</p>

  <p>"Where is the girl?" asked Sanders. He spoke very little above a
  whisper.</p>

  <p>The messenger made no answer.</p>

  <p>"The girl?" said Sanders, and lashed him across the face with his thin
  stick.</p>

  <p>"Master," muttered the man, with his head on his chest, "the chief has
  her." Sanders took a turn up and down the deck, then he went to his cabin and
  came out with two revolvers belted to his hips.</p>

  <p>"I will go and see this chief," he said. "Abiboo, do you run the boat's
  nose into the soft sand of the bank, covering the street with the Maxim
  whilst I go ashore." He landed without opposition; neither gun banged nor
  spear flew as he walked swiftly up the broad street. The girl lay before the
  chief's hut quite dead, very calm, very still. The hand to cut short her
  young life had been more merciful than Sanders dared hope. He lifted the
  child in his arms, and carried her back to the ship. Once he heard a slight
  noise behind him, but three rifles crashed from the ship, and he heard a thud
  and a whimper of pain.</p>

  <p>He brought the body on board, and laid it reverently on the little
  after-deck.</p>

  <p>Then they told him that the woman had died, and he nodded his head slowly,
  saying it was better so.</p>

  <p>The Zaire backed out into mid-stream, and Sanders stood watching the city
  wistfully. He wanted the chief of the Lulungo badly; he wanted, in his cold
  rage, to stake him out in spread-eagle fashion, and kill him with slow fires.
  But the chief and his people were in the woods, and there were the French
  territories to fly to.</p>

  <p>In the evening he buried the missionary and his family on a little island,
  then drove downstream, black rage in his soul, and a sense of his impotence,
  for you cannot fight a nation with twenty Houssa policemen.</p>

  <p>He came to a little "wooding" at dusk, and tied up for the night. In the
  morning he resumed his journey, and at noon he came, without a moment's
  warning, into the thick of a war fleet.</p>

  <p>There was no mistaking the character of the hundred canoes that came
  slowly up-stream four abreast, paddling with machine-like regularity. That
  line on the right were Akasava men; you could tell that by the blunt noses of
  the dug-outs. On the left were the Ochori; their canoes were streaked with
  red corn wood. In the centre, in lighter canoes of better make, he saw the
  white-barred faces of the Isisi people.</p>

  <p>"In the name of heaven!" said Sanders, with raised eyebrows.</p>

  <p>There was consternation enough in the fleet, and its irregular lines
  wavered and broke, but the Zaire went steaming into the midst of them. Then
  Sanders stopped his engines, and summoned the chiefs on board.</p>

  <p>"What shame is this?" said Sanders.</p>

  <p>Otako, of the Isisi, king and elder chief, looked uncomfortably to Ebeni
  of Akasava, but it was Bosambo, self-appointed ruler of the Ochori, who
  spoke.</p>

  <p>"Lord," he said, "who shall escape the never-sleeping eye of Sandi? Lo! we
  thought you many miles away, but like the owl&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Where do you go?" asked Sanders.</p>

  <p>"Lord, we will not deceive you," said Bosambo. "These great chiefs are my
  brothers, because certain Lulungo have come down upon our villages and done
  much harm, stealing and killing. Therefore, because we have suffered equally,
  and are one in misfortune, we go up against the Lulungo people, for we are
  human, and our hearts are sore." A grin, a wicked, mirthless grin, parted
  Sanders' lips.</p>

  <p>"And you would burn and slay?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Master, such was the pleasure we had before us."</p>

  <p>"Burning the city and slaying the chief, and scattering the people who
  hide in the forest?"</p>

  <p>"Lord, though they hide in hell we will find them," said Bosambo; "yet, if
  you, who are as a father to us all, say 'nay,' we will assemble our warriors
  and tell them it is forbidden." Sanders thought of the three new graves on a
  little island.</p>

  <p>"Go!" he said, pointing up the river.</p>

  <p>He stood on the deck of the Zaire and watched the last canoe as it rounded
  the bend, and listened to the drone of many voices, growing fainter and
  fainter, singing the Song of the Slayer, such as the Isisi sing before
  action.</p>
