  <h2><a id="rev"
     name="rev"></a>A CONTEMPORARY REVIEW OF<br>
  "THE CAMFORD VISITATION"</h2>

  <p class="first">MR. WELLS's address as president of the Educational Science
  Section of the British Association last year dealt with certain aspects of
  education in the schools only. In his latest story, with its cover of dark
  and light blue, he deals with university education and its place in society.
  The story begins with an amusing sketch of a dyed-in-the-wool scholar, the
  master of Holy Innocents College, a preserver of culture, of true
  scholarship, born to appreciate without ever creating.</p>

  <p>His breakfast oration has got to the stage of denouncing "the dictatorship
  of the half-educated. We are being endowed, Sir, and told what to know and
  teach, by the unholy wealth of ironmongers and the overblown profits of
  syndicated shop-keepers."</p>

  <p>Then enters the visitant as a voice, an unseen presence, asking:
  "Half-educated? Now how can you measure education and divide it into halves
  and quarters? What do you mean by education?..."</p>

  <p>For the rest of the story the visitant subjects human life, and in
  particular its treatment by the University of Camford, to a sympathetic but
  quite unsparing scrutiny. The general thesis is an appeal to the universities
  to play a part in "so heroic an ordering of knowledge, so valiant a beating
  out of opinions, such a refreshment of teaching and such an organization of
  brains as will constitute a real and living world university, head, eyes and
  purpose for Man".</p>

  <h2><a id="ch1"
     name="ch1"></a>I. &mdash; THE UNEXPECTED VOICE</h2>

  <p class="first">THE story of the Camford Visitation begins quite suddenly in
  the dining-room of Holy Innocents College. Four or five of the Fellows had
  assembled for breakfast, there was a guest of the Senior Fellow and there was
  of course the Master. There was nothing remarkable and certainly nothing
  sinister or disagreeable about the visible scene. It was&mdash;as people
  say&mdash;brightly matutinal&mdash;though why anyone should ever use that
  detestable word is difficult to explain. There was no suggestion at all of
  occult influences or unseen participation. The company was cheered by a
  bright coal-fire and protected from it by a vast glass screen. The wistaria
  on the garden wall outside which separates the domains of Holy Innocents from
  the garden of the Warden of University was brightly sunlit and at its glowing
  best.</p>

  <p>The Master was talking at his guest.</p>

  <p>Talking at a guest was a habit with him. He was grey and leathery and
  wrinkled about the face, he had a large nose and a variously baggy neck in
  which his voice reverberated and was enriched, his mouth was wide and wayward
  and dropped a little and his eyes beneath his grey eyebrow thatch were bright
  and brown and wicked. The guest was in fact a New Zealander but the Master
  had conceived an idea that he was an American full of intellectual
  unseemliness, presuming on the impertinent endowments of his
  fellow-countrymen to have opinions in matters far above his quality and
  erudition. Anyhow he looked modern and neat and unscholarly&mdash;and he
  passed opinions. He did pass opinions. The Master had never got over the
  gross disloyalty of the War of Independence and blamed it for practically
  everything that had happened since.</p>

  <p>"Beautiful old wall," the guest had said, pausing, his ham and eggs in
  hand, midway between hot plate and table and staring out of the window. "Your
  Camford walls are wonderful."</p>

  <p>"We <i>need</i> high walls," said the Master.</p>

  <p>There had been a certain sense of strain about the table-talk. The
  academic weather was unsettled and even into the large comfort of Holy
  Innocents the disturbance had penetrated. Projects were afoot in Camford that
  the Master manifestly disliked intensely. One of the fellows present was an
  archaeologist, one of those tiresome creatures who dig and dig beneath the
  foundations of our classical culture, and the other was an exploring
  ethnologist, an unbookish stray, who treated the disgusting habits of
  Papuans, the shameful speculations of Dr Freud and the extravagancies of Dr
  Jung as suitable material for theorization about early Greek life. Early
  Greek life was beautiful and sacred, the Gods and fauns were gentlemen who
  ought not to be spied and pried upon; old Triton blew his wreathed horn, and
  that was that; the less you went into details about it the better. It seemed
  to the Master that these younger Fellows had bit the hand that had reared
  them. Recently both of them had favoured two monstrous new proposals for
  setting up strange schools, one in modern industrial and commercial
  history&mdash;no doubt, the Master sneered, with a professor or so of
  permissible adulteration and prize-coupon giving&mdash;and the other in human
  ecology, in which mankind was to be studied as though they were rabbits or
  guinea-pigs or lemmings, and much good would that do anyone. Birth-rates and
  emigration and statistics. An invasion of laborious claptrap on an
  unprecedented scale, the Master reiterated: "Laborious claptrap. We had
  better import a few Americans to show us how," said the Master.</p>

  <p>This guest before he apprehended the tension in the air had been actually
  asking questions, at once ignorant and exasperating, about these matters, and
  the Master had already strung a few epithets. It was possibly with the idea
  of creating a diversion that the guest had expressed his aesthetic
  appreciation of Camford. But the Master's reply had jerked things back
  again.</p>

  <p>"We are a beleaguered fastness," he said. "True scholarship lives here,
  Sir, on the defensive. The Philistine rages without. We need these walls.</p>

  <p>"Maybe they will hold," he said, making his voice reveal something of its
  deeper nuances. "Maybe."</p>

  <p>The pause encouraged him to go on.</p>

  <p>"It was the Germans, those disastrous people, who first discovered that
  slag heaps and by-products might also count as learning, but I doubt if we
  can blame any one race or nation in particular for setting dumps and dustbins
  above the treasure cabinets of scholarship. Crudity is in the spirit of the
  age. We make war for raw materials. We live by paper money, canned food and
  substitutes for learning. There is a positive antagonism to any crystalline
  thing. In South Africa they corner diamonds and hide them away. Everywhere
  pure gold is buried. They take it out of mines to put it into vaults. That
  University affair they are building in London, that glorified mechanics'
  institute, is all made, they tell me, of a sort of mineral nougat, lavatory
  style, no taste, no dignity&mdash;quite suitable, <i>very</i> suitable
  there&mdash;for shop-boys and night schools. It's the dictatorship of the
  half-educated we are under. We are being endowed, Sir, and told what to know
  and teach, by the unholy wealth of ironmongers and the overblown profits of
  syndicated shop-keepers. We certainly need our walls here, Sir. We need them
  badly, every wall we have."</p>

  <p>And then it was the Voice spoke.</p>

  <p>It said very clearly and distinctly: "Half-educated? Now how can you
  measure education and divide it into halves and quarters? What do you
  <i>mean</i> by education?..."</p>

  <p>It is to be noted that the first impulse of everyone present was to turn
  towards the space between the table and the window. It was as if someone had
  come into the room and stood there and spoken. Everyone had either been
  watching the eloquent workings of the Master's face folds or looking
  shamefacedly at his eggs and bacon and sausages or what not, and now by a
  common attraction they all turned to look at&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>Emptiness!</i></p>

  <p>Two of the college servants stood in the doorway beyond and to the left of
  that talking piece of space, but they were both as incapable of that clear
  enunciation as of piping like a nightingale or barking like a dog.</p>

  <p>Then the eyes of the company came back to the Master and the guest.</p>

  <p>"You said, Sir&mdash;?" said the Master, leaning forward on his elbow.</p>

  <p>"I said nothing," said the guest.</p>

  <p>He spoke clearly and precisely but unless he was fitted with a double
  system of vocal organs he was certainly not responsible for the curiously
  penetrating intonations they had just heard.</p>

  <p>Because later when they came to compare notes there was a general
  agreement that there was something in the colour of the voice that was not
  quite human. What that difference was they found it difficult to say.
  "Steely" was one word used, and another was "luminous". But upon the subtle
  inhumanity of it they were all agreed.</p>

  <p>They questioned each other mutely. Had they really heard it? Was there an
  element of hallucination in their apprehension? Had they located it properly?
  The youngest fellow got up briskly and went to the open window and
  scrutinized the space below the sill. Nothing but innocent lavender and
  antirrhinum. No lurking golden-voiced undergraduate there. The comparative
  ethnologist was moved by this to look under the table. The college butler
  came forward to assist him.</p>

  <p>"Did you hear a voice, Martilow?" asked the comparative ethnologist.</p>

  <p>Martilow backed out from under the table and knelt up interrogatively.</p>

  <p>The comparative ethnologist repeated his question.</p>

  <p>"Yessir. It seemed to me, if you ask me, Sir, to come from&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He got up and went back to the space between window and table, stood and
  then with an air of the most delicate discrimination, put out his left foot
  and tapped the faded carpet. "<i>Here</i>," he said.</p>

  <p>"Lift up the carpet," said the archaeologist, and the servants set about
  it with brisk curiosity.</p>

  <p>But there was nothing under the carpet.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch2"
     name="ch2"></a>II. &mdash; MR TRUMBER'S EXPERIENCE</h2>

  <p class="first">AT first no one who heard the voice in the dining room of
  Holy Innocents College seems to have talked very much about it. The Master
  said nothing further&mdash;nothing whatever. He looked suspicious and
  menacing, at large, and for the rest followed the normal routines of his
  life. He was not going to give himself away. Over him, as over all eminent
  dons, hung the Fear of the Bright and Sportive Undergraduate. Dons who pray,
  and some do pray, pray always to be preserved from Hoaxing and Impersonation.
  If hoaxers could speak invisibly in his most sacred presence maybe they could
  hear and watch. The other fellows felt very much as the Master did and the
  guest was quick and sensitive enough to realize that discretion best became
  him.</p>

  <p>He had already assimilated enough of the Camford atmosphere to realize
  that a voice that could shout in Holy Innocents College "What is Education?"
  was as outrageous as one that would demand sexual instruction from a
  meditation of nuns. He tried to banish all memory of that incongruous moment
  from his mind and so for a while did the others.</p>

  <p>But Martilow got in a plumber that very afternoon and went with him all
  over the building in a futile search for wires and speaking-tubes.</p>

  <p>If nothing further had happened, the interruption would probably have
  sunken down into complete forgetfulness and left not the faintest mark upon
  history. It would have become one of those things that could not possibly
  have happened. But in the next few days a number of trivial occurrences laid
  the almost impalpable basis of a belief that something or somebody, unknown
  and unseen, was present in Camford, as a voice, as a slight but palpable
  pressure, mental rather than bodily, as a faint stir and draught during a
  lecture, as a deeper shadow in the shadows that waited and watched. Many of
  these incidents went unrecorded, a few had the passing recognition of an
  exclamation, some were at last spoken of. And then more.</p>

  <p>Presently they were being talked about, not simply mentioned but talked
  about.</p>

  <p>The second recorded instance broke cover in a conversation between little
  Trumber of Clayfoot College and his congenial gossip the vicar of St
  Hippolytus.</p>

  <p>"Are you free this afternoon?" said Trumber.</p>

  <p>"What is it?" asked the vicar. "You look bothered."</p>

  <p>"I want to get some fresh air. I want to clear my head. I've slept badly.
  I've had an&mdash;an exhausting night. Something&mdash;something is worrying
  me. Let us walk out to Cramber Meadows and get tea at Chuck's Hill Farm as we
  used to do in the old times."</p>

  <p>The vicar reflected upon the sacred duties of the day. "I can be with you
  by a quarter to two," he said.</p>

  <p>Until they were well out of the town and over Puntingdon Bridge, their
  conversation was disconnected and trivial. "Those meadows are to be the new
  experimental station for animal psychology&mdash;if Foxfield gets his
  way."</p>

  <p>"Not laboratories?"</p>

  <p>"Kind of zoological gardens."</p>

  <p>"What next?"</p>

  <p>"You may well ask. A sort of Ruskin College for dogs and chimpanzees. <i>À
  la Pavloff</i>."</p>

  <p>"Howling all night."</p>

  <p>"I don't doubt it."</p>

  <p>"As if Camford had not enough insomnia!"</p>

  <p>"That's bothering you again?" asked the vicar.</p>

  <p>"I had a bad night last night."</p>

  <p>"You tried that soup bromide stuff I suggested?"</p>

  <p>"No. It wasn't, as a matter of fact, my ordinary sleeplessness. It was
  something&mdash;. Bream, you are one of those people who dabble a little in
  psychotherapy?"</p>

  <p>"I do my best to know something about it. I regard it as part of my
  calling. In fact&mdash;I am writing about it. At least I am accumulating
  notes."</p>

  <p>They strode on in silence for a couple of minutes.</p>

  <p>"Something queer happened last night," said Trumber and in spite of the
  encouragement in the vicar's "Yes?" got for awhile no further.</p>

  <p>At length in a fragmentary way, with considerable obstetric assistance
  from the vicar of St Hippolytus, Trumber produced his story. He had, he
  explained, been hearing from Rexwill the ethnologist, about the voice in the
  dining-room of Holy Innocents and Rexwill and he had gone on to discuss what
  sort of reply one <i>could</i> make to such a question as "What is
  education?"</p>

  <p>"Naturally we were silent," said Rexwill.</p>

  <p>"It is almost like asking 'What am I?'" said Trumber.</p>

  <p>"If one had answered it," said Rexwill opening a new line, "I wonder if
  that voice would have gone on talking."</p>

  <p>"Pity someone didn't try."</p>

  <p>"We were all too taken aback, and then, you know, it seemed to
  evaporate."</p>

  <p>"It?"</p>

  <p>"Whatever it was."</p>

  <p>They speculated in a rather futile fashion about the voice, what it was,
  whence it came. "It must be in space and time," said Rexwill, "it must be
  producing material waves in material air or we couldn't hear it."</p>

  <p>"A sort of Invisible Man," said Trumber. "There are a thousand reasons why
  an Invisible Man is impossible," said the scientific Rexwill. "Visual purple
  of the eyes. Food. Dirt. So forth. It's something&mdash;<i>subtler</i> than
  that."</p>

  <p>"I wish I had been there," said Trumber. "You don't think&mdash;perhaps
  the sound wasn't on the air at all&mdash;merely in your ears? Or rather in
  your brain?"</p>

  <p>"Martilow heard it. The scout with him heard it. I have never suspected
  either of <i>them</i> of brains. And&mdash;it came definitely from a point in
  space."</p>

  <p>"Where there was nothing," said Trumber.</p>

  <p>"Where there was nothing."</p>

  <p>After this conversation with Rexwill, which occurred after dinner in the
  Clayfoot smoking-room, Trumber explained to the vicar that he had felt
  restless and had gone for a walk round Carshary alone. To think it out. He
  said he found something very disturbing in this story&mdash;more disturbing
  than was reasonable and natural. Possibly the idea of a disturbing challenge
  was already germinating in his mind. His mind was an uneasy one, addicted to
  almost impalpable activities. It was a calm night but he no longer felt that
  that evening calm had any profundity. Behind it, ready now to become vocal at
  any time, lurked a threat of interrogation. He had taken his walk to think
  things out but he got nothing thought out. His mind was too intent upon what
  he would do if he found himself challenged&mdash;for example during his
  lectures.</p>

  <p>Trumber's subject was English literature, a poorly but earnestly attended
  course. He dealt in taste and judgment. He was one of those who teach us how
  to appreciate poetry and prose and when to learn it by heart and recite it
  and say Oh and Ah! and when to shake one's head at it discouragingly like a
  'bus conductor who is proffered a doubtful coin. He taught how to distinguish
  what was truly great from what was meritorious and what meretricious. He
  taught how T. S. Eliot was really <i>it</i> and why Rupert Brooke wasn't, and
  what was <i>chic</i> in poetry and what was quite <i>de mode</i>, and the
  proper tones and phrases for a snort of disapproval or a sick ecstasy of
  appreciation. He was building up a new school of literary criticism, more
  finely fastidious than any that had ever gone before, in which he taught that
  what is generally regarded as third-rate is really first-rate, that what is
  commonly accepted as first-rate is really very trite and vulgar, and that the
  chief aims of literary effort are superiority, exasperation and obscurity.
  His school he called the Sensitives. He was the quintessence of the
  intellectually genteel, though that word would have crucified him. He was all
  for conceits and secondary and tertiary values. He hated primary meanings as
  he hated primary colours. His criticism was aloof from life, but since
  literature, alas! has to be about something, he reflected upon life. He was
  all against what he called this "so-called progress". Progress that was not
  "so-called" did not exist for him. He lived for revivals and restorations. He
  was sharp set against machines, newspapers, films, suburbanism and any plain
  sort of successfulness, good or bad, in the world. That an adequate
  university and educational organization should have initiated, controlled and
  corrected these developments which he found so undesirable, had never and
  probably could never have entered his head. He snapped at them and barked
  sharply at them and taught kindred souls to bark at them, an intellectual
  Pekinese.</p>

  <p>He was a small, slender, downcast man with exophthalmic eyes behind thick
  glasses, a bulging forehead, a look of extreme obstinacy about his shoulders;
  he gesticulated with long tentacular hands that looked bleached, and he spoke
  rapidly and wetly. It gave him a sense of almost divine power to put down the
  mighty from their seats and exalt little chaps as unimportant as himself. It
  gave his followers all the warm satisfaction of a cult to realize how
  quintessential was their little classroom and how wrong the outer world. He
  would knock Milton all round the room, so to speak, and lay bare the
  self-educated errand-boy vulgarity of Shakespeare, Hardy or Dickens. These
  were his great hours and his soul was exalted and his face flushed. And when
  he was not lecturing he would sit and write himself into authority in a
  little lemon-covered monthly magazine which was also very reassuring. Yet he
  was sufficiently aware of the case against himself to feel that a sudden
  Voice asking questions of an elementary sort might be extremely embarrassing.
  And with this oddly disturbing thought very busy in his mind he went up to
  bed, went to sleep and presently drifted up towards consciousness again,
  answering the challenge in a dream.</p>

  <p>At least, he told his friend, it had seemed at first to be a dream. It was
  more or less of a dream.</p>

  <p>He was lecturing in the smaller theatre in Clayfoot; or rather it felt
  like that, except that on one side the room had no wall but, after the
  convincing absurdity of dreams, opened between pillars on a confused
  landscape that looked like lawns of printed newspaper and gardens of budding
  and opening books. And his audience stretched away into this garden and sat
  on garden chairs, and it was exactly like his usual small select audience of
  poetic and critical embryos who aspired to become bright, artistic, indecent,
  reactionary writers, Communist, Fascist, Anglican or what not, except that it
  also included a number of faces of grateful dead departed writers he had
  resuscitated and rueful living writers he had decided were dead and literary
  hostesses and rich patronesses who might subsidize the lemon-covered magazine
  and suchlike persons of taste, and other faces, enigmatical faces, at which
  he wanted to look and yet couldn't look for fear he might lose his thread,
  and they were all being overwhelmingly and magnetically attentive to his fine
  discriminations, his subtle transpositions of values, his eccentric eulogies
  and his fresh, bright, outrageous detractions.</p>

  <p>Usually he loved lecturing. It was the reward and compensation of his
  life. But now in his dream he was no longer happy. He lectured on with the
  usual stuff&mdash;but now in fear. He perspired through his discourse,
  because he knew, as one knows in dreams, that the Voice was near at hand.</p>

  <p>And it began. He raised his voice, he raised his hand, but the Voice spoke
  through his lecturing as a trumpet speaks through chatter.</p>

  <p>"What is this literature you are talking about?" it asked. "What is this
  gathering? What in the name of Time and the Stars do you think you are doing
  here?"</p>

  <p>"I certainly had an answer ready," Trumber said, recounting his experience
  to Bream, the vicar of St Hippolytus. "It was exactly what I had expected. I
  had thought of an answer, several answers, already, but&mdash;you know the
  nightmare quality&mdash;they wouldn't come. 'This is a dream,' I said, and
  awoke with a dry rattle in my throat. That dream audience, those fantastic
  gardens&mdash;left not a wrack behind. I sat upright in my bed in the
  darkness of my bedroom. Sweating. Stiff with that exaggerated cold terror
  only dreamers know."</p>

  <p>He stopped short.</p>

  <p>"Just a nightmare," the vicar hazarded.</p>

  <p>Trumber pressed his lips together and shook his head quickly.</p>

  <p>"No?" said the vicar.</p>

  <p>"<i>No</i>," said Trumber.</p>

  <p>"Tell me."</p>

  <p>"<i>The Voice went on</i>," said Trumber in a whisper.</p>

  <p>His warm flushed face, his magnifying spectacles came close to the
  vicar.</p>

  <p>"You mean?"</p>

  <p>"<i>The Voice went on</i>... It was still there. In my room. It wasn't a
  part of my dream. On the contrary. It was the Voice that had made my dream,
  and it was still talking to me."</p>

  <p>Bream scrutinized his friend.</p>

  <p>"No," said Trumber. "It was no hallucination. It was a clear, firm, rather
  metallic voice out of the air in the half-light between me and the
  window."</p>

  <p>"What was it saying?" asked Bream after a pause.</p>

  <p>"It was demanding&mdash;well not exactly demanding&mdash;asking me with a
  sort of cool civility why I had got these young men and women of mine into
  that lecture theatre and what I thought I was doing to them. What was all
  this about poetry that was the right sort and poetry that was all wrong? What
  did I mean by poetry? No, no. What did I <i>mean</i> by it? In relation to
  biological reality? Yes, he said that,&mdash;in relation to biological
  reality? Biology! Had this literature a function? Or were I and my group
  making a little limited conspiracy about values? To hearten each other. And
  set a fashion. He said, he actually said, that criticism as I conceive it, is
  a self-defensive conspiracy in appreciation that has practically no
  importance in the universe at all. A freak of response. In fact a
  pretence.</p>

  <p>"I felt I had to do something to justify myself. I stood up. I stuck out a
  pointing finger. As though I could see the Thing. I summoned all my strength.
  'Who are you?'"</p>

  <p>"And what did it answer?"</p>

  <p>"'First ask yourself 'What am I?'. For so far as I am concerned, I am
  beyond your understanding."</p>

  <p>"That wasn't much."</p>

  <p>"No. That wasn't much. But then it went on&mdash;crude irrational stuff
  really, but at the time the Voice was so clear, the sentences so sharply cut,
  that it carried a kind of conviction. Bream, he did actually talk me
  down&mdash;alone there in the darkness. His voice is a stabbing voice, a
  knife. I tried to dismiss him by a wave of the hands&mdash;you know my
  gesture-like this." He flapped his tentacular hands like a dusting-brush.
  "But I couldn't lift my hand. Out here over the tea-cups in the sunshine I
  get back to Camford and the graces and distinctions and subtleties of life,
  my values are restored, my school becomes a reality again, but
  there&mdash;with him&mdash;it was different. Bream, it's astounding how
  sometimes a dim bedroom can seem larger than the visible universe, stars and
  comets and all.</p>

  <p>"'Literature,' said he, 'should be a part of man's attempt to take hold of
  life. You make it a little fiddling with the aesthetic incidents of life. It
  should rise in masses to transcendent efforts. It should be the solvent glory
  of reality, the flux of life. The greatness of its occasions dwarf you and so
  you hate and belittle its greatness. What is literature without magnanimity?
  You teachers are set here at Camford to be the captains of the human mind.
  Fine captains! You&mdash;you particularly I mean&mdash;are like a captain who
  takes his chronometer to pieces to make a clockwork mouse.'</p>

  <p>"And so on, <i>ad libitum</i>, for quite a long time. Just insults. Anyone
  can say things like that. Obvious they are, and from the critical standpoint
  of no value at all.</p>

  <p>"'I protest,' I shouted.</p>

  <p>"'I protest. I protest,' louder and faster.</p>

  <p>"'Refinement,' I said. 'Delicacy. Cultivated appreciation. Whatever else
  Camford has done or not done it has kept out the Philistines. Even if you try
  to poke this Voice of yours in here, we will not listen to you. Camford is
  Camford. We have never listened here to this sort of thing. We never
  will.'</p>

  <p>"And then, Bream, I found myself in the room alone. In a moment he had
  gone. Quite suddenly he had made an end and gone. And old Philbertson in the
  room above was bumping on the floor. So I guess, what with my shouts and that
  voice we had been making a pretty considerable row. And that's the
  story."</p>

  <p>"That's all?" said Bream.</p>

  <p>"Practically all. Except&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes?"</p>

  <p>"The room was aching with... a sort of positivist doubt... What do you
  make of it, Bream?"</p>

  <p>"Something quite simple," said the vicar of St Hippolytus after a judicial
  pause. "The projection of a long-standing conflict in your subconscious
  between the aesthetic pretentions of your criticism and your suppressed sense
  of its lack of spiritual values. I have long wanted to discuss this with you.
  I am glad of this occasion. Forgive me if I am a trifle technical and if I
  seem to reflect upon you a little. But this is exactly what I am dealing with
  in my forthcoming book <i>Doubt from a Physico-Psycho-logical Standpoint</i>.
  In everyone, in everyone, even in God's holy saints, there is an undercurrent
  of adverse self-criticism in the subconscious. There is an
  interrogation&mdash;an opposition to whatever direction you have given your
  life. Which may emerge during seasons of trial. St Anthony for
  example&mdash;as Luther would have us believe&mdash;exaggerated his fear of
  sensual appetities to the extent of giving them physical form. St Augustine
  witnesses to a similar Protestant uprising in his being. In the good we call
  this opposition Doubt or Temptation."</p>

  <p>The vicar of St Hippolytus was now fairly launched upon a long elaborated
  theme. He was just ready for this opportunity. He paid no heed to the fading
  interest in Trumber's face and pose. When Trumber showed signs of
  interpolating anything he raised his voice.</p>

  <p>"You see," he continued, "unsureness is integral to human life. The mind
  would have no play without it. In sinners as in saints, it is equally in
  evidence and still more so is it the case with those who, like yourself, are
  well disposed but fall short of complete righteousness. Then it becomes, to
  use the good old terminology, the Voice of Conscience. Now, as I shall show
  in my book&mdash;for you know we are gradually assimilating all the best of
  modern materialism&mdash;whatever they put up against us we take in,&mdash;as
  I shall show in my book, all through the ages, in the troubled minds of
  intelligent men, these subconscious doubts and urgencies assume an
  hallucinatory physical quality, take the form of Visions, as in the case of
  St Anthony, or still more frequently Voices. Most frequently Voices. But the
  reality is within."</p>

  <p>Trumber's love of lecturing was only equalled by his hatred of being
  lectured to. His face had assumed a sullen expression and now suddenly he
  interrupted.</p>

  <p>"I heard that voice. It is a real voice. It is about the world."</p>

  <p>"Forgive me, Trumber! I am here as your mental healer. You were dreaming
  just as much when you stood up in your room as when you were lying down. I
  assure you. And I ask you seriously to consider what that voice was saying to
  you. Is this literature of yours <i>correlated</i>? Have you not been
  disregarding spiritual values for aesthetic and what one might call
  <i>social</i> associations&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"I tell you I heard a real voice."</p>

  <p>Bream waved his smiling face from side to side, ineffably satisfied by his
  interpretation.</p>

  <p>"You and your school go back to the long-neglected literature of the
  seventeenth century. But not in one respect. The religiosity of Donne for
  example was intrinsic and profoundly sincere. It was the outcome of a real
  rebirth. It was not in the least imitative. But have you ever asked yourself
  whether your religiosity&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That Voice wasn't any sort of self-criticism," Trumber contradicted. "It
  was something from Outside bent on destroying my self-confidence. An
  attack..."</p>

  <p>"But, my dear man, I know better."</p>

  <p>"Wait till he talks to you."</p>

  <p>"I suppose today," the vicar continued relentlessly, "we know infinitely
  more about space-time than we ever did before. Something&mdash;something in
  our dimensional orientation has changed. I have assembled the evidence for
  that in my book. An extraordinary convergence. The effect is to bring the
  subconscious nearer to the surface, so that everywhere, everywhere, the
  internal oppositions in men are becoming more acute. Everywhere, everyone is
  being subjected to abnormal mental stresses."</p>

  <p>"Oh let's get back," said Trumber rudely, rising to his feet...</p>

  <p>The vicar stared and stopped short. Then shrugged his shoulders and stood
  up also.</p>

  <p>"Bill, Miss, please," said Trumber. "Thank you. Keep the change..."</p>

  <p>They returned side by side towards the dreaming spires of Camford, but a
  silence had fallen between them. Trumber spoke only once and that was as they
  crossed Puntingdon Bridge.</p>

  <p>"It was a real voice," he said. "As real as you." And then rather
  needlessly, "<i>Much</i> more real."</p>

  <p>Bream replied by a gesture of his hands and shoulders.</p>

  <p>Further argument was impossible.</p>

  <p>Later on Bream published this book from which he had quoted so freely. But
  he had changed it very considerably. The title had become
  <i>Extra-Terrestrial Disturbances of Human Mentality</i>. He enlarges upon
  the idea of an upthrust of the subconscious through some sort of space-time
  dislocation. He makes it the main thesis of his work. Many of his phrases
  must be read to be believed. The "orientation of the spiritual plane in
  multi-dimensional space" or "the Time-Factor in Justification" is just plain
  sailing to him. But to no one else I am afraid.</p>

  <p>No wonder the stuff infuriated Trumber. It was in a different field of
  affectation altogether from the one he worked so industriously to
  establish.</p>

  <p><i>Extra-Terrestrial Disturbances of Human Mentality</i> has not sold very
  extensively but it has added greatly to the vicar's prestige. There is talk
  of making him a bishop. In the Middle Ages they would have burnt him at the
  stake.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch3"
     name="ch3"></a>III. &mdash; IN THE CRAMB MEADOWS</h2>

  <p class="first">THESE are the first two intimations of the Visitant to
  Camford. The third also depends upon the word of a single individual. It is
  the word of Scott-Harrowby the Hooker Professor of Latent History, and
  curiously enough it is at once the most detailed and convincing of all the
  recorded dualogues with the Visitant. But it had one thing against its entire
  credibility. Scott-Harrowby told nobody about it until some weeks after the
  Visitation had become a common topic. He was a man already suspect of
  imagination, invention and irony. One or two undergraduate rags are still
  remembered against him. At the best his evidence is to be treated as
  second-class matter.</p>

  <p>It has to be realized that side by side with the plainly authentic
  stories&mdash;or at least reasonably authentic stories, on which this
  narrative is based, a considerable apocrypha grew up before many weeks were
  out, and did much to confuse people's minds. But Scott-Harrowby manifestly
  had no desire to mystify or defraud. His speculative imaginative mind, he
  admits, had been exercised profoundly by the problem of how a bodiless voice
  could be heard in a roomful of people and at the worst he worked out that
  explanation either in the form of a waking dream or of a dream so vivid that
  it incorporated itself with his waking memories as real. His story is that he
  had gone for a walk beside the Cramb and where the woods came down to the
  river's edge about half a mile beyond Chuck's Hill Farm, he found a felled
  tree and sat down on it and lit a pipe. And then&mdash;and this is very
  peculiar among the accounts of the Visitant,&mdash;he believes he felt the
  tree pressing upward against him. "It was exactly," he says, "as though
  someone, somebody fairly substantial, was sitting down at the other end."</p>

  <p>He sat quite still staring where this heavy nothingness was presumably
  seated.</p>

  <p>Scott-Harrowby is under the impression that he began the conversation. He
  thinks he said "<i>Well</i>?"</p>

  <p>The Presence spoke almost as soon as he did. "Are you what is called a
  don?" it asked. "You are one of those who direct and control the education in
  this place?"</p>

  <p>"And may I ask with whom I have the pleasure of conversing?"</p>

  <p>"I wish I could explain to you. I'm looking at Camford. I'm asking
  questions."</p>

  <p>"But you have no eyes to look with."</p>

  <p>"I have vision of a sort. The light comes through."</p>

  <p>"Through <i>what</i>?"</p>

  <p>"There are no words for it in this language of yours."</p>

  <p>"Your voice comes through to <i>us</i> all right."</p>

  <p>"It <i>is</i> rather good, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"And you've got a weight."</p>

  <p>"Not particularly."</p>

  <p>"I felt you&mdash;when you sat down."</p>

  <p>"I haven't sat down. I'm not really here."</p>

  <p>"But I felt you."</p>

  <p>"No. I was feeling <i>your</i> weight. Fifteen stone I should say."</p>

  <p>"All that," said Professor Scott-Harrowby; "nearer sixteen. Wouldn't it be
  nice if you showed yourself a bit?"</p>

  <p>"My appearance might distract you."</p>

  <p>"What do you want here&mdash;in Camford?"</p>

  <p>"I wish you would tell me a few things."</p>

  <p>"I wish <i>you</i> would materialize&mdash;from wherever you are."</p>

  <p>"Quite impossible. Physically impossible. One can't bring a lot of fresh
  atoms into your air suddenly without a violent explosion. Surely you know
  that?"</p>

  <p>"But you get sound waves going."</p>

  <p>"That's easy."</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"Do you want me to talk a lot about dimensions and things of that sort?
  Analogies and metaphors I should have to use; each looser than the other.
  Your words cannot say it. You wouldn't begin to understand. I suppose you
  would have a faint feeling of confused satisfaction&mdash;distended with wind
  so to speak and hoping to digest it."</p>

  <p>"Let it go at that," said Scott-Harrowby. "Here you are."</p>

  <p>"But <i>you</i> can tell <i>me</i> things, you know. Manifestly I
  understand your language&mdash;such as it is."</p>

  <p>"Manifestly."</p>

  <p>"Though hardly a word or an idiom of mine would carry meaning to you."</p>

  <p>"But what are you doing on, by, near or over Camford?"</p>

  <p>"I happened to pass your planet. I was just strolling about. I looked at
  it. I found it interesting."</p>

  <p>"Just strolling about? Like a man coming on an ant-hill and saying, 'Why
  are these creatures so busy?'"</p>

  <p>"Rather like that. Comparisons are always more or less misfits."</p>

  <p>"A man looking through a microscope?"</p>

  <p>"Something after that fashion too. Things under a microscope have a way of
  being transparent, but your little heads are opaque to everything. At the
  first glance I thought these animalcules&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You are talking to fifteen stone ten of Camford don. But I lent myself to
  it. Quite probably fifteen stone ten is nothing to you. Maybe we are just
  Lilliputians in your eyes."</p>

  <p>"These animalcules," the Voice went on in complete disregard of the
  Professor's protest, "are amazingly clever&mdash;and stupid. The cleverer
  they are, the more stupid they seem to be."</p>

  <p>"I can't lay my hands on anything for a <i>tu quoque</i>. It is your road,
  Sir. Go on."</p>

  <p>"I have been watching your human affairs, for&mdash;you'd count it some
  years. I've listened to speeches, talk, outcries, noises&mdash;I've read your
  newspapers and most of your books."</p>

  <p>"English books?"</p>

  <p>"All languages. Your languages don't amount to very much yet. Know one,
  know all. They are all very much to pattern, like your bodies and brains. All
  a little distorted and mixed up."</p>

  <p>"You've listened no doubt. But have you read? There are no stories of
  books having their pages turned over by an invisible reader. I've never heard
  of you taking down and turning over the pages of books."</p>

  <p>"I don't. I can read books without opening them. That puzzles you?"</p>

  <p>"I agree to be puzzled so long as you don't talk about dimensions or
  relativity or planes or anything like that."</p>

  <p>"I won t."</p>

  <p>"Good. Go on, Mr Gulliver disincarnate. I am a micro-Lilliputian. I don't
  mind answering your questions, but I find your talk better than mine. You can
  read a book but you can't read a brain. Mine is at your disposal&mdash;to the
  best of my ability. What exactly do you want to know? Your animalcule to
  command."</p>

  <p>That is what the Hooker Professor of Latent History considered he said
  when five weeks later he decided to write it down. Those who know him best
  are most disposed to believe that he was fearless and animated to that
  extent.</p>

  <p>"The thing I want most to know is whether something has gone wrong inside
  those opaque little heads of yours. Or perhaps not so much gone wrong as
  reached a limit. Always so far your interesting little species has met almost
  every challenge Nature has given it. Its adaptabilities have been enormous.
  But now. It seems to be trying to sit down just when it ought to be learning
  and adapting harder than ever. What is the matter? Are those bony little
  skulls of yours getting too tight? Full up? Pot bound? unable to move? That
  is what I want to know."</p>

  <p>"About this adaptability in the past?" Scott Harrowby asked, playing for
  time.</p>

  <p>"The little beasts came along astonishingly. You see I've been in the
  habit of looking at this planet ever and again."</p>

  <p>"Ever and again?"</p>

  <p>"Every&mdash;by your measurements&mdash;few million years. My time is
  different. For several hundred million years this Life here has been going
  on&mdash;fantastic and quite silly. Big and little things, rush and bolt and
  gobble, spread and feed, suck and soak and snare. No sense in it at all.
  Lumps like the dinosaurs going about their blind business as though it
  mattered. Pterodactyls flapping through the air from nowhere interesting to
  nothing in particular. Brutes like the plesiosaurs, the dinocerata, the
  mammoths, eating endlessly and leaving their droppings. The grass plains and
  the herds of clumsy pre-cattle and pre-horses chewing and chewing. And the
  early dogs and wolves. Then at last your sort, your ancestral submen, between
  the high grass and the trees. Chattering, emotional, quarrelsome but
  undeniably clever. There was something attractive in the way they chipped
  flints, made things out of branches of trees and mud. I came back presently
  to look again and there they were in little villages, talking to one another,
  singing songs, dressed up a bit, and with pots and pans and carved bones and
  all sorts of things no creatures had ever thought of before. Every time I
  came back they had something fresh for me to see. I became really interested
  in them. Life had never done anything so nimble before. It was an end to vain
  repetitions. They seemed afraid of nothing and they attempted everything.
  They built with mud. They built with stone. They rode horses, they ambushed
  and domesticated all sorts of creatures, they tamed rivers with embankments,
  they took logs of wood, burnt them hollow and used them as boats and were
  presently sailing out to sea. They invented trading, writing, money. They
  reduced copper and then iron. They made wheels and high roads. Hardly a
  century passed without some profound change sweeping across their spreading
  world and always they seemed equal to the occasion. They explored and mapped
  all this planet, little enough, God knows, but big for them. They made steam
  engines. In just a little bunch of years they discovered electricity and
  turned it to a thousand uses. They worked out a funny but quite useful theory
  of radiations and particles. They learnt to fly in thirty short years.</p>

  <p>"Quite bright little beasts. Yes. But doing it all incoherently,
  disconnectedly&mdash;jostling against each other. More and more dangerously.
  The faster they go the more they jostle. And now they seem to be turning more
  and more away from progress to thwart and destroy one another as they run. I
  am concerned for them. That really, considering the size of them,
  <i>tremendous</i> human uprush seems losing its direction, losing its
  cohesion, just on the verge of a crowning victory. Have you played yourselves
  out? What is happening in those little heads of yours now that you have got
  the ball at your feet? I shall hate the very sight of this little planet if
  man flares out and disappears."</p>

  <p>To that effect, if not, he says, in those exact words, Scott-Harrowby
  reports the Visitant.</p>

  <p>No one seems to have wandered by while this talk in the Chuck's Hill
  meadows was going on. That is a pity because some of us would willingly pay
  quite a considerable sum to know what such a passer-by would have overheard.
  Would he have observed a large, elderly, grizzled don sitting all alone on a
  fallen tree, smoking a pipe and occasionally making disconnected remarks, or
  would he too have heard the voice and been witness to an actual duologue?</p>

  <p>"What ought to hold your minds together?" the Voice went on. "What is it
  that isn't there?"</p>

  <p>"I give it up," said Scott-Harrowby.</p>

  <p>"In the past you men invented all sorts of things to create solidarities,
  so that you could work together and get things done, religions, philosophies,
  moralities, customs, social organizations of all sorts. The most ingenious
  and effective nets. Limited but effective. They invented priesthoods to hold
  these nets together, initiations, schools, temples, symbols, laws and
  law-courts. But now&mdash;with everything calling daily for mental and moral
  adjustment&mdash;I find they haven't invented anything new of that sort that
  matters for the past four centuries. It is almost unbelievable to me. I have
  been looking all over your planet and I cannot find the least evidence that
  any but a few odd people are even dissatisfied with the ways you have of
  learning things, recording knowledge and holding yourselves in agreement.
  Your schools and books and colleges have changed last and changed least. They
  are dragging along half a century behind. The links that hold your busy
  little heads together in any sort of community of purpose, of interpretation,
  of information, are feebler than ever they were. Mostly they are just the old
  links, worn out, frayed old religions, threadbare sentimentalities. The
  bricks in your social fabric are changing to sand. Is a progressive
  solidarity too much for you? Here is this new mankind, world-wide, able to
  talk to itself all over the planet, able to fly to the ends of the earth,
  possessed of what would have seemed a hundred years ago incredible power, and
  it produces no sort of brain. It has just the old tired-out ganglia of its
  disunited past. So far as I could see when I returned this time to look
  again, it had not the beginnings of a common brain. I looked and listened for
  the Scientific World, the Learned World, for a Literature of Power&mdash;for
  you use those phrases&mdash;and so far as I have been able to see there are
  just these universities of yours&mdash;this Camford of yours ranks high among
  them&mdash;that even pretend to be gathering and concentrating knowledge,
  carrying on thought, dominating education and radiating fresh mental impulse
  into these hundreds of millions of little brains which are mankind. I'm
  incredulous. I'm frightened&mdash;beyond space and time I am
  frightened&mdash;at the headlessness of this planet to which I have taken a
  fancy. Is it really still advancing, or has it overgrown its mind and become
  a pimple head, an acephalous monster?"</p>

  <p>"Like a hen running about after its head is chopped off," said
  Scott-Harrowby, reflecting over his pipe. "Not a bad image that... But... I
  don't think it's done for yet."</p>

  <p>"Like a decapitated hen spouting blood and still running about," said the
  Voice. "A very good image indeed. Why is it like that?"</p>

  <p>"Wars, I admit, have certainly become more and more disastrous and
  uncontrollable," said Scott-Harrowby.</p>

  <p>"Everything is becoming uncontrollable. Things are just happening to
  you."</p>

  <p>"But still I don't think we are done for yet."</p>

  <p>"If you are not done for yet, you must be doing something about it here.
  Here if anywhere. In this focus, this sample focus of collective mental life.
  Here if anywhere is where adjustment should begin. Where can it begin if it
  does not begin in this central ganglion? What are you doing?"</p>

  <p>"I?"</p>

  <p>"Camford... And you&mdash;as representing Camford."</p>

  <p>"You are a very uncomfortable person to meet on an afternoon walk... We
  are not doing very much."</p>

  <p>"I can't see inside your heads. <i>Are you aware</i>?"</p>

  <p>Scott-Harrowby gesticulated with his pipe, sitting forward, elbow on knee.
  Was he aware? Why pretend not to understand? A violent impulse to frankness
  seized him. He did his best to state the truth. "We certainly do our best not
  to be aware."</p>

  <p>"And if anyone else begins talking&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"We do our best to shut him up."</p>

  <p>"You have given birth to a new world and behold! the new-born creature
  insists upon being a mental defective."</p>

  <p>"Practically we have only begun to apprehend the new state of affairs in
  the last thirty years. Things have moved fast. And formerly our ruling idea
  was conservation. Give us time to get going."</p>

  <p>"But what are you doing about it? What are you beginning to do? You have
  had time&mdash;some time anyhow. Thirty years is time enough to turn round
  in. What are you doing about it? I ask <i>you</i>."</p>

  <p>The Voice was impatient.</p>

  <p>"Camford?"</p>

  <p>"You in particular as a sample."</p>

  <p>Pause.</p>

  <p>"I didn't," said Scott-Harrowby in his later description of this
  conversation, "know what to say to that. The silence lengthened.
  '<i>Well</i>?' said the Voice.</p>

  <p>"Still I didn't know what to say... I wanted time...</p>

  <p>"And suddenly I realized that I was completely alone. My pipe was out and
  I was completely alone. And completely alone I got up and made my way back to
  Camford."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch4"
     name="ch4"></a>IV. &mdash; MR PREEDER'S PIGEON-HOLES</h2>

  <p class="first">STILL more apocryphal than the Scott-Harrowby conversation
  is the account the Visitant gave of himself and his purpose and ideas to Mr
  Henry Preeder, a temporary assistant reader for the University Press. Mr
  Preeder seems to have been accosted by the unknown in one of the rooms
  attached to the new warehouse of that organization, and to have acted as a
  sort of guide to him in an inspection of the book store, the printing plant
  and the distributing arrangements of the Press.</p>

  <p>No witnesses are forthcoming of this peripatetic conversation, though
  quite a lot of people must have been passed en route and what is equally
  remarkable Mr Preeder does not seem to have told anyone about it for nearly
  seven weeks until after the publication of Scott Harrowby's story.</p>

  <p>He accounts for the delay by saying that for a time he thought the whole
  thing was a dream. Quite possibly it was a dream. During that interval he was
  turning the discussion if ever it occurred over and over in his mind and it
  is hard to believe that this hay-making in his memory did not involve
  considerable additions, transpositions, amplifications and the substitutions
  of many of Mr Preeder's own ideas for the less comprehensible remarks of the
  Visitant. As it is, slightly more than two-thirds of Mr Preeder's printed
  report tells us of what Mr Preeder said to his interlocutor.</p>

  <p>The Preeder contribution is indeed more in accordance with Dr Bream's
  theories of a release of subconscious dreams and wishes, than any other of
  the quasi-authentic accounts of the strange visitation.</p>

  <p>There is something mulish about Mr Preeder and there is no reason to
  suppose he changed his nature in the presence of the unknown. He is a
  bachelor of small private means and his connexion with the academic world is
  quite incidental. He is a small rather crooked resentful little man with a
  peevish face and a querulous voice; he says what he has to say over and over
  again. "That may be as you say," he says, "but&mdash;" and <i>da
  capo</i>.</p>

  <p>He has long been obsessed by the idea&mdash;which is certainly spreading
  abroad&mdash;that the next great task before mankind is to get everything it
  knows fully and completely tidied up and pigeon-holed. That is what is called
  Modern Encyclopaedism. He is an expert in the new and rising technique of
  documentation and he believes more than he believes anything else in the
  world that every book, pamphlet, paper, statement, letter, photograph, chart
  in existence, every fact and all discussion could be filmed upon an
  ultra-microscopic scale, stored away, indexed in accordance with the
  ingenious system of the International Institute of Bibliography and any part
  or item in it reproduced upon a suitable screen whenever required. This
  collection would constitute a sort of World Memory. It could be made in
  triplicate or quadruplicate and each complete copy of it housed in a secure
  shelter in some remote part of the world. "An overwhelming task!" says Mr
  Preeder. "Not in the least"&mdash;and produces his chapter and verse cut and
  dried, so many billion documents with an average surface reduced to one in
  ten million, so many billion millimetres of film and so forth.</p>

  <p>"Space?"</p>

  <p>"Store rooms, student rooms, projection theatres, everything would go into
  a building&mdash;Oh! a quite possible and manageable building. If only you
  get the idea."</p>

  <p>"An index of fact perhaps. Scientific fact. But a synthesis of religion
  and philosophy?"</p>

  <p>"Why not?"</p>

  <p>"But men," you protest, "will always think differently&mdash;about the
  ends of life."</p>

  <p>"<i>Feel</i> differently," says Mr Preeder. "That is a matter of
  upbringing. That depends upon what has happened to your egotism since your
  first cluck. But sound thinking and sufficient knowledge can dominate
  feeling. Most of this stuff about incurable differences of opinion is
  nonsense, brains are as alike as eggs. You can beat them up or boil them hard
  or scramble them or poach them or let them go rotten. But cook them the same
  way and they will come out very much alike."</p>

  <p>He has quite elaborate plans for digesting these vast central
  accumulations he contemplates into workable general encyclopaedias, into
  students' handbooks, taking out and peptonizing this or that special section
  into histories and textbooks. He does indeed contemplate a universally
  educated world, and his parody of a physical brain on a world scale in which
  micro-photographic records parallel cerebral cells, is not to be dismissed
  too cavalierly because of the nagging insistence with which he propounds it.
  He wants a universally educated world, educated on the same lines, with every
  artificial difference eliminated. He is a cantankerous disagreeable little
  nobody and yet at times one feels he has got hold of something most
  exasperatingly vast and right.</p>

  <p>It is equally difficult to resist the persuasion that in some way, to some
  extent the great intruder was on Mr Preeder's side.</p>

  <p>"You have to pull your minds together," said the Voice&mdash;according to
  Mr Preeder. "And soon. Or you'll just kill yourselves off the planet with
  your diverse suggestions, your uncontrolled hates and your half-witted
  mechanical cleverness... And there are such splendid things now for you to
  do."</p>

  <p>That is not Mr Preeder's natural phraseology. That sounds like the
  authentic Voice.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch5"
     name="ch5"></a>V. &mdash; THE COMMUNIST PARTY IS ANNOYED IN ITS TURN</h2>

  <p class="first">IT seems probable that in the case of both Dr Scott-Harrowby
  and Mr Preeder an actual encounter with the unknown did take place. The
  Visitant in their stories, so far as manner and quality go, sounds "like
  himself". His penetrating audibility and the sense of his presence are true
  to type. But what he says is, to say the least of it, also strongly coloured
  by the known qualities and disposition of the interlocutor. This is precisely
  what would happen to one's memory of a strange communication that was not
  immediately put on record. And even at the time he spoke, his hearers,
  without any conscious disposition to misunderstand him, seem to have been
  translating his hard alien questions and statements into the idiom of their
  own habitual preconceptions.</p>

  <p>There is a highly probable story told by Raymond Dedlock, who is a man of
  conspicuous integrity, of a discussion in his study in the small hours
  between himself and the Visitor, about the difference between the Humanities
  and Science.</p>

  <p>"Why do you cling to such useless and decaying distinctions?" the Visitor
  reiterated. "Why must you get things askew even before you begin to teach?
  Knowledge is one and Wisdom is one. Why let this poisonous pretence that the
  Humanities as you call them, these stale scraps of past thought, are Wisdom
  and that Science is not, why let that soak into the minds of generation after
  generation of undergraduates? Is it through a pervading laziness, or is it
  the partizanship of professionalism, or is it just malignity?"</p>

  <p>"I said all sorts of things to him," said Raymond Dedlock with a sigh,
  "but I couldn't make him understand. I cannot imagine a Camford mind at all
  without the Humanities. We build on them.</p>

  <p>"You may say what you like about <i>Literae humaniores</i>, I told him,
  but see the men we have produced!</p>

  <p>"'That is what I am thinking of,' he said.</p>

  <p>"'What are you producing now?' he said. 'The dull ones get nothing from
  that stuff, the cunning ones compromise; the bright impatient ones rebel and
  go off after Marx or Mussolini or any odd heretic. But <i>your</i>
  stuff&mdash;nowadays...'"</p>

  <p>"Did he say <i>your</i> stuff'?" asked someone.</p>

  <p>"I'm not quite sure," Raymond Dedlock admitted. "It may have been just a
  dream."</p>

  <p>Whatever we may think of the authenticity of these particular
  conversations, however widely we may vary in our answers to the question of
  what this Visitant or Visitation was, the fact remains that throughout the
  months of April and May 1937 up to the last astonishing outbreak, there was a
  widespread feeling that some sort of Presence was subjecting human life in
  general and its treatment by Camford in particular, to a sympathetic but
  quite unsparing scrutiny.</p>

  <p>It is however a principle hitherto applied chiefly to the evidences for
  spiritualistic phenomena that any number of imperfectly established cases,
  any assembly of uncontrolled statements, whatever quality they may have in
  common, do not constitute a scientific proof, and by this standard we are
  bound to suspend our judgment about all this business.</p>

  <p>Directly we lower our standard of evidence below that scientific level we
  are confronted with a vast tangle of quasi-corroborative statements. Quite a
  number of undergraduates think they heard a voice pursuing them with the
  question: "What do you think you are learning here? You are preparing for the
  world. What sort of world are you preparing for?"</p>

  <p>Nothing very fresh in that. Some of the brighter minds in every annual
  wave of freshmen have asked themselves that question since the beginning of
  things. But freshmen are young and timid. Few venture to attempt a real
  answer, they just worry and argue about it for a week or so and then drop it
  altogether, or slip into Fascism, Communism, Buchmanism, Catholicism or
  whatever other ready-made formula of dissent, whatever form of escape from
  the dreary and manifestly sterile academic assumptions, is in fashion. From
  which they presently slip back into ordinariness. The problem is too vast for
  them to tackle unaided, the university offers them no help, hushes them up,
  provides the opiate of irrelevant work and the reassurance of a degree.</p>

  <p>Whatever it was the unknown said or did not say to aggravate such natural,
  if transitory, heart-searchings in the undergraduate mind, there is only one
  instance where we have evidence of any effectual penetration. An intervention
  at a small Communist gathering in Pecklington, although it seems to have been
  partially drowned at the time by the bawling of the Red Flag and afterwards
  by shouts of "Yah boojaw"&mdash;shouted in unison after the fashion of an
  American college yell&mdash;does seem to have left a perceptible residuum of
  mental uneasiness. All witnesses agree about the penetrating quality of the
  Voice. It was not a loud or authoritative Voice, but it penetrated. It could
  cut its way through protesting cries, organized uproar, prohibitions and
  suppression, and this time it seems to have done this youthful gathering the
  honour of talking for some time.</p>

  <p>Conspicuous in the tumult of class-conscious proletarians on this occasion
  was young Lord Fauntleroy, Harold Biggs, the poet son of Biggs the colliery
  proprietor, Turnbull Jix the editor of <i>The Camford Red</i> and the
  Honourable Reginald Blupper who had been four times to Russia. These were all
  disputatious spirits whose mental consciences were still sufficiently
  youthful and alert to rankle at an imperfectly parried thrust. They could not
  leave issues simply shouted down. They went back to their rooms and talked
  about them. Some were shaken and something had to be done about it. An
  article appeared in <i>The Camford Red</i> denouncing the Voice in unsparing
  terms, and through this article we catch unmistakable echoes of what was
  actually said. Manifestly we are dealing with that same enquirer who talked
  to Professor Scott-Harrowby and Mr Preeder and who troubled the mind of Dr
  Raymond Dedlock.</p>

  <p>The article runs as follows:</p>

  <p>"Some pale pink Utopian ventriloquist seems to have been going about
  Camford in the favourite role of the common or garden capitalistic Stooge,
  doing his feeble best to minimize the supreme significance of the class war
  in history, questioning the omniscience of Marx and the moral ascendency of
  Stalin, and attacking party discipline by impossible demands for detailed
  explanations, from which, as every seasoned party member knows, disputes and
  dissensions are most conveniently evoked.</p>

  <p>"Most of it we have heard before&mdash;the chief novelty is the
  ventriloquism, which seems to be of an unusually high quality. There is the
  usual hypocritical pretence of sympathy with our criticisms of the capitalist
  system. Sham leftward phrases he uses glibly, leading ingeniously away from
  the vigorous prosecution of the class war to that woolly utopia-spinning,
  dear alike to liberals, technocrats and the I.L.P. One or two of our critic's
  favourite gags which are, comparatively speaking, novel, are: 'Insurrection
  is not revolution' and 'No revolution can create until it ceases to be
  revolutionary', followed up by 'What are you trying to <i>make</i>' This is
  the stale, old indictment that when Communism found itself in control of
  Russia it had no plans ready and has been improvising ever since, and that
  Marxism was no more than a diagnosis and prophecy of the decline of Private
  Capitalism.</p>

  <p>"The unknown seems to think he has scored a new point by demanding the
  relevance of the ideology of the class struggle to the training of an airman
  or the discoveries of an explorer or ecologist or therapeutist. These latter,
  he declares, are things that change the world for good, they are the 'true
  revolution', but the class-war, if you please, is only 'bickering in the
  working team'. His words these&mdash;his preposterous words! Our
  ventriloquist has evidently got many of his ideas from the swiftly exploded
  school of the Technocrats. His case, so far as we can consider it a case,
  seems to be that there is an actual and more or less inevitable revolution
  going on in human conditions, due to physical and biological innovations,
  accelerated communications, birth control, artificial fertilization, release
  of staple production from geographical conditioning, <i>et cetera</i>, <i>et
  cetera</i>, and that the whole magnificent fabric of Marxist ideology is in
  fact&mdash;again we quote his phrases&mdash; 'a faint preliminary mental
  response' to these conditioning changes&mdash;'a transitory experiment in
  mental adaptation'&mdash;which already demands revision and research.
  Revision and research which would end inevitably in party
  disorganization.</p>

  <p>"There is just enough demoralizing plausibility, however, in these
  pseudo-psychological insinuations to challenge a reply. Happily in Camford we
  need not go far to find it. Here is a fresh influence trying to scrabble
  together again all the scattered confusions, relics, middle-class illusions,
  veiled imperialism, pacifist make-believe, constitutionalism, utopianism,
  defeatism, <i>et cetera, et cetera</i>, which still shackle the advance of
  the working class in Britain. Only by the continual challenging and smashing
  up of this ideology can the working class free its path forward, and
  Communism be established in its future position as the theory and practice of
  the British working class.</p>

  <p>"If this irrepressible heckler in the streets of Camford would stop
  heckling, listen, attend, consulting for example Hinkle Brewster's modest but
  useful little pamphlet, <i>The Practical Finality of the Marxist Formula</i>,
  he might discover that all his fancied novelties of criticism were fully
  foreseen by the Master and dealt with exhaustively. Given sufficient
  integrity indeed (though we find it difficult to credit anyone outside the
  Communist Party with even a minimum of integrity) he might even be induced
  (consummation devoutly to be wished) to shut up altogether.</p>

  <p>"The more he will study Communist literature the more he will come to
  realize the fundamental conclusiveness of Marx. In every field of art,
  science and human interest whatever, Marx is, in his essence, all-sufficient.
  The more He is revealed by the exegesis of such exponents as Lenin, Stalin,
  Palme Dutt, Harold Laski, John Strachey, Hinkle Brewster <i>et cetera</i>,
  <i>et cetera</i>, the more one realizes His practical Omniscience, and the
  belatedness of such detraction as our ventriloquist attempts. No wonder the
  latter prefers to remain anonymous and invisible. <i>Vox et praeterea
  nihil.</i>"</p>

  <p>The article was evidently intended to be unsigned, but by one of the slips
  of the mind that happen to all of us at times, Hinkle Brewster had set his
  name to it.</p>

  <p>In spite of the manifest bias and irritation of the reporter, the gist of
  what the Visitant said shows through clearly enough, and is manifestly true
  to form. He did interrupt that meeting of temporary proletarians, he did get
  his shots home on them and he left his arrows to fester in their convictions
  in spite of their self-protective uproar. His is the insatiable urgency of
  science. He reveals himself as the enemy of all final doctrines and
  convictions. Marxist jargon, Freudian jargon, precious literary criticism,
  the dear old Humanities, were plainly all the same to him; all so much mental
  thumb-twiddling. His appeal to the mind of the world in general and to
  Camford in particular, was to get up and go on. And keep going on. He was
  progress articulate. He was the spirit of the provisional. His message was an
  intellectual drive without a glimmer of surcease.</p>

  <p>But the report that he spoke suddenly at a lecture Professor Foxfield was
  giving upon the history of the Ascidians, how they are hatched as
  free-swimming larvae, swim about gaily for a time and then fix themselves by
  their heads, surround themselves by a cellulose covering and become
  practically vegetables, is quite recent and probably a pure invention.
  "Exactly what your minds do here in Camford," the Voice is alleged to have
  interpolated. That is too apt to the general tenor of the stories about him.
  It is like those Sayings of Jesus in which some excited and undiscriminating
  disciples underline, overstate and accumulate things they could not bear to
  think the Master had not said.</p>

  <p>Most of these invented sayings exaggerate his characteristics. They are in
  every way ruder. Generally they contradict flatly. They lose their
  interrogative tone. They sink towards the level of "Don't talk rot" or "I
  <i>don't</i> think".</p>

  <p>In a later issue <i>The Camford Red</i> returned to the question of the
  Voice. Hinkle Brewster after his little slip about the signature seems to
  have retired into the background and the article was plainly by another
  hand.</p>

  <p>It denounced "the supreme impertinence of imploring us to think harder and
  better. Left-wing Camford thinks as hard as it knows how or anyone knows how.
  Nobody can think harder or better or with a greater certainty of arriving at
  the desired conclusion than a properly trained proletarian. To see a novel
  proposition pass through a Marxist gathering is like watching a breeze across
  a field of ripe corn. It passes; and the serried minds return to their
  upstanding integrity. The Communist ideology has a close-knit assurance that
  puts the Roman Catholic theologian to shame. It is, thank Heaven, the
  absolute antithesis to the oafish gaping 'open mind' of nineteenth-century
  liberalism. And that is why it marches on relentless to the 'Seizure of
  Power'&mdash;that mighty phrase, that glorious idea."</p>

  <p>If the Visitant had his way with Camford and the rest of us life would be
  an unceasing exploration from the cradle to the grave. Never would he have us
  clench our minds&mdash;dictatorially. Never at any moment in our lives would
  he concede us the satisfaction of feeling at last, completely right. Never
  would he let us sit down and say 'There! <i>Now</i> I know exactly where I
  am.'</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch6"
     name="ch6"></a>VI. &mdash; CONGREGATION DAY</h2>

  <p class="first">THE crowning outrage of the Visitant was committed upon a
  far larger and more important gathering than the Communist meeting in the
  little Pecklington Hall. It was Congregation Day; all that was best,
  brightest and most picturesque in Camford life was assembled in the Great
  Hall of University. Dons in robes, dons' wives in smart new dresses, beadles,
  officials in quasi-mediaeval costumes, distinguished visitors from foreign
  universities in queer hats and strange confections of silk and velvet, a few
  scattered common gentlemen in morning coats and silk hats to recall us to the
  twentieth century, made a brilliant assembly, over which an unusually bright
  Mayday sun splashed a thousand patches of colour from the glorious stained
  glass of the south windows.</p>

  <p>The Princess Susan Magenta, smirking like anything, was receiving, very
  graciously, an honorary degree in philosophy, when the Voice began.</p>

  <p>It began and yet, quite incredibly, the ceremony went on.</p>

  <p>"I have come out of the deeps beyond space and time to look again at this
  little planet I have visited since its beginning. I have seen life clambering
  out of drifting slime towards consciousness and will. I have watched the
  ascent of your species to the dawn of understanding and the beginnings of
  power. I care for you, and now I am impatient with you. For I see plainly
  that I overrated your intelligence, that you have blundered into knowledge
  and opportunity, and that you do not know how to grasp your knowledge nor how
  to realize your opportunities. Individually and incidentally you can be
  bright creatures but collectively you are a feeble folk. Time marches on and
  you trifle with your lives. You realize neither the dangers nor the
  possibilities of human life. You fail to organize, you fail to educate.
  Everywhere the world falls into disorder for the want of the mental
  leadership such people as you here, pretend to supply&mdash;which cannot be
  supplied so long as you dominate the schools and block the way. How trivial
  is this display! How monstrously and tragically trivial! Your academic
  triviality is the half-spiteful triviality of inadequate minds conscious of
  their essential failure. This Congregation Day is your annual culmination. It
  is a defiant coronation of mediocrity. You dress up this poor commonplace
  girl in these pretentious robes almost as if she were a symbol, your Goddess
  of Unreason, you recite your scraps of Latin over her. You have this
  millionaire and these other odd conspicuous folk to follow her in the
  acceptance of what you call honours. It is not in your nature to honour
  anyone that you cannot secretly despise.</p>

  <p>"Time marches on. The ingenuity of your race, working without coordination
  or foresight, produces one disconnected invention after another, so that
  mechanical Power grows in your world like a cancer. In quite a little while
  now, in a few decades at most, it will be possible for any small body of
  desperate men to poison your whole atmosphere, sweep your world bare with
  infections or blow your planet to pieces. You here will do nothing to
  anticipate and prevent that. When the catastrophe comes maybe it will still
  find Camford dressed up in its gowns and its Gothic, performing its age-old
  function of keeping education within limits and obstructing the growth of any
  controlling intelligence in the world.</p>

  <p>"Why am I saying these things here to you in Camford? Because I have come
  to like this breed of mankind. Because you represent the limits of its
  education. Because you stand both at its head and in its way. You who are
  assembled here today constitute a typical centre of education. And
  deliberately you ignore the fact that human life is mental. The essential
  thing in human life is education, the growth of a common mind and will. If
  mankind fails it will be through the failure of its teachers, the weakness of
  its schools, the obstinacy, the wilful obstruction of its universities.
  Cannot you realize so plain a thing as that? It is appalling that you here
  are <i>so</i> central and <i>so</i> important to the human future, but you
  are. Outsiders cannot do anything if you resist. You are too well entrenched.
  You are feeble in innovation but invincible in resistance. Your littleness
  here has blocked the education of the English and blighted the educational
  development of the rest of the world through a century of opportunity, and
  still your predominance is unchallenged. You&mdash;and your sister imitations
  throughout the world&mdash;have monopolized the best of the youth of each
  generation, because there was nowhere else for it to go for instruction.
  Monopolized you have, and mistaught and marred. Maybe presently there will be
  mundane voices to echo mine, and maybe then you may change your note, but
  will you change your spirit? Can you change the spirit of this place? This
  old, this weakly lovely place? This dreadful place?</p>

  <p>"Surely even you for all your elaborately cultivated affectations and
  self-protections, must know&mdash;reluctantly and secretly indeed&mdash;but
  still you know it&mdash;that there can be no escape for your world, for all
  mankind, from the ages of tragic confusion ahead of you, except through so
  heroic an ordering of knowledge, so valiant a beating out of opinions, such a
  refreshment of teaching and such an organization of brains as will constitute
  a real and living world university, head, eyes and purpose for Man. That is
  the primary need of your species now. It is your world's primary want. It
  must come now&mdash;if it ever is to come. Disintegration and decay wait for
  no one. They wait for nothing. Plainly before you now&mdash;I cannot believe
  you blind to it for all your refusal to see&mdash;is the ultimate frustration
  of the promise of mankind, defeat and an end. Have you no intimations of the
  enormity of your default here? Will you make no stir to save knowledge and
  thought before undisciplined ignorance destroys itself with its own machines?
  I who go to and fro outside space and time have seen and see. There is no
  salvation for races that will not save themselves. Half the stars in the sky
  are the burning rubbish of worlds that might have been."</p>

  <p>And with these words, "the burning rubbish of worlds that might have
  been", the Voice made an end to what it had to say to mankind.</p>

  <p>It is an impressive instance of the essential common sense of our human
  breed, that while this fantastic tirade was in progress, a majority of the
  chief actors in the ceremony was able to ignore it and carry on as though no
  sounds but those right and proper for the occasion were audible. The public
  orator recited the praises of the Princess Susan Magenta. The Lord Chancellor
  put the hood over her head gracefully but firmly. The assembly
  applauded&mdash;maybe rather more loudly and defiantly than they would
  otherwise have done. The Ushers guided her feet in the way they had to go to
  her seat on the dais, and then led forward the next recipient, an enormously
  rich Brazilian timber merchant. The public orator took up his burthen again.
  The Voice with its note of protest did not so much drown as frame this
  picturesque procedure, floated over it and contained it like the fretted roof
  of the hall above the great organ.</p>

  <p>The Voice ceased and it was as if a cloud that had obscured the sun had
  passed. The Princess continued to smile with an august graciousness. To this
  day it is unknown whether she had any inkling whatever of that overriding
  Voice, because nobody has ever presumed to question her about it. The
  Brazilian timber merchant was hooded in his turn and gave way to a rising
  labour politician. The little chain of those whom Camford delighted to honour
  lost one link after another, dwindled and passed. The ceremony drew to its
  end.</p>

  <p>The Voice had ceased; it had ceased completely, not only for that occasion
  but altogether.</p>

  <p>It was only as the gathering dispersed that people could be heard asking
  one another: "Did you by any chance <i>hear</i> anything?"</p>

  <p>"I <i>did</i> seem to hear..."</p>

  <p>"M'm'm."</p>

  <p>One changed the subject. "The princess I thought was looking
  charming..."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch7"
     name="ch7"></a>VII. &mdash; THE HEALING TOUCH IN HISTORY</h2>

  <p class="first">SIX, eight, ten, twelve months passed and there were no more
  stories about the Voice. With more and more confidence people began to
  question its reality.</p>

  <p>Here are a few scraps from the Fellows' conversation in Holy Innocents
  Hall when the anniversary of the Visitation was coming round: &mdash;</p>

  <p>"Ghosts come out of the past, why shouldn't they come out of the
  future?"</p>

  <p>"Is that the sort of fellow we shall get in the future? Heaven help
  us!"</p>

  <p>"Ghost you say! He was a lot more like a government inspector."</p>

  <p>"I believe he was a sort of travelling ethnologist&mdash;from
  Elsewhere."</p>

  <p>"All the same I wish there was some clear explanation of all that
  business. You know I heard it. I heard it the first time. That bit of carpet
  over there still makes me feel uncomfortable as I cross it. I hardly know
  why."</p>

  <p>"It made all Camford feel uncomfortable for a bit. But we're settling down
  again all right now, I hope. We're settling down..."</p>

  <p>And as this story goes to press a very interesting brochure comes to hand
  from the Royal Psychological Society. It is by Dr Stephen Peter McIntosh and
  it is called <i>The Voice that Breathed o'er Camford</i>, <i>A Study in
  Contemporary Legend Building</i>. It is a sceptical and destructive
  examination of the alleged Visitation. He never speaks of it as the
  Visitation simply, always as the "alleged Visitation." The method has been to
  set aside all hearsay testimony and to make a direct appeal to&mdash;ear
  witnesses. Under the withering enquiries of Dr McIntosh very few of those who
  had hitherto been counted upon as first-hand evidence, stood the test.
  Professor Scott-Harrowby stood by his account stoutly and rather irascibly
  and Mr Preeder increased in certitude and detail with each repetition. But Mr
  Trumber became more and more of the Vicar of St Hippolytus' opinion, and Dr
  Raymond Dedlock thought that quite possibly he had been asleep and had a
  nightmare.</p>

  <p>"Well, isn't being asked <i>what</i> the Humanities are, and
  <i>why</i>&mdash;a bit of a nightmare?" he said. "When one has lived not
  unhappily in them and by them all one's life."</p>

  <p>Martilow, the butler of Holy Innocents, insisted that he could not talk of
  "inside happenings to outside persons". This became <i>his</i> impregnable
  formula.</p>

  <p>The young men of the Pecklington meeting had long ago decided they had
  been ragged by a practical joker at the back of the hall, and more and more
  persuaded that the Voice had spoken with that peculiar blurring of the
  labials which is so distinctive of ventriloquism. And if the things he said
  were ventriloquial then plainly there was nothing more to be said about
  them.</p>

  <p>Even the extraordinary interruption in the Great Hall of University
  presented few difficulties to Dr McIntosh.</p>

  <p>The reticence of the trained reporters present, he insists, is very
  significant. In spite of the alleged existence of a complete shorthand
  report, <i>The Camford Mail</i> ignored the incident absolutely, and the
  words of the speech only became available when the young stenographer who
  claims to have taken it was dismissed from the staff of that paper. Dr
  McIntosh rejects his report as a forgery. "Something of the sort might have
  been shouted from the gallery," he says. "That is the miserable residuum of
  conviction which remains after our careful scrutiny of all the available
  evidence. At best, it is a very improbable might-have-been."</p>

  <p>Bream and Trumber made friends again and a time came when the tension
  between them had relaxed sufficiently for them to discuss the Voice.
  Trumber's conviction of the reality of the Visitation had faded and
  dissolved. "It was just a particularly vivid dream," said Bream, driving home
  his point of view.</p>

  <p>"A dream that went on&mdash;after I was bodily awake," said Trumber, as
  though he was repeating a lesson. "Yes."</p>

  <p>And then his mind twisted back and he added: "All the same, if he turns up
  here again, I shall go down. Lectures or no lectures. I won't have my
  lectures interrupted. I won't have my atmosphere destroyed. I won't have my
  values swept aside as an artificiality, an aesthetic sort of play."</p>

  <p>"But as a matter of fact did he ever interrupt&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"He was there," said Trumber. "I felt him there after the&mdash;after the
  dream I had. Every day. For quite a long time. I did my best to ignore
  him...</p>

  <p>"How can we go on," cried Trumber, "keeping where we are, unless we ignore
  him?"</p>
