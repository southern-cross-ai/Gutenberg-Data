  <p class="first">FROM the time when I first saw Senecoza, the fetish-man, I
  distrusted him, and from vague distrust the idea eventually grew into
  hatred.</p>

  <p>I was but newly come to the East Coast, new to African ways, somewhat
  inclined to follow my impulses, and possessed of a large amount of
  curiosity.</p>

  <p>Because I came from Virginia, race instinct and prejudice were strong in
  me, and doubtless the feeling of inferiority which Senecoza constantly
  inspired in me had a great deal to do with my antipathy for him.</p>

  <p>He was surprisingly tall, and leanly built. Six inches above six feet he
  stood, and so muscular was his spare frame that he weighed a good two hundred
  pounds. His weight seemed incredible when one looked at his lanky build, but
  he was all muscle&mdash;a lean, black giant. His features were not pure
  Negro. They more resembled Berber than Bantu, with the high, bulging
  forehead, thin nose and thin, straight lips. But his hair was as kinky as a
  Bushman's and his color was blacker even than the Masai. In fact, his glossy
  hide had a different hue from those of the native tribesmen, and I believe
  that he was of a different tribe.</p>

  <p>It was seldom that we of the ranch saw him. Then without warning he would
  be among us, or we would see him striding through the shoulder-high grass of
  the veldt, sometimes alone, sometimes followed at a respectful distance by
  several of the wilder Masai, who bunched up at a distance from the buildings,
  grasping their spears nervously and eyeing everyone suspiciously.
  
  <p>He would make his greetings with a courtly grace; his manner was deferentially
  courteous, but somehow it "rubbed me the wrong way," so to speak. I always
  had a vague feeling that the black was mocking us. He would stand before us,
  a naked bronze giant; make trade for a few simple articles, such as a copper
  kettle, beads or a trade musket; repeat words of some chief, and take his
  departure.</p>

  <p>I did not like him. And being young and impetuous, I spoke my opinion to
  Ludtvik Strolvaus, a very distant relative, tenth cousin or suchlike, on
  whose trading-post ranch I was staying.</p>

  <p>But Ludtvik chuckled in his blond beard and said that the fetish-man was
  all right.</p>

  <p>"A power he is among the natives, true. They all fear him. But a friend he
  is to the whites. <i>Ja</i>."</p>

  <p>Ludtvik was long a resident on the East Coast; he knew natives and he knew
  the fat Australian cattle he raised, but he had little imagination.</p>

  <p>The ranch buildings were in the midst of a stockade, on a kind of slope,
  overlooking countless miles on miles of the finest grazing land in Africa.
  The stockade was large, well suited for defense. Most of the thousand cattle
  could be driven inside in case of an uprising of the Masai. Ludtvik was
  inordinately proud of his cattle.</p>

  <p>"One thousand now," he would tell me, his round face beaming, "one
  thousand now. But later, ah! Ten thousand and another ten thousand. This is a
  good beginning, but only a beginning. <i>Ja</i>."</p>

  <p>I must confess that I got little thrill out of the cattle. Natives herded
  and corralled them; all Ludtvik and I had to do was to ride about and give
  orders. That was the work he liked best, and I left it mostly to him.</p>

  <p>My chief sport was in riding away across the veldt, alone or attended by a
  gun-bearer, with a rifle. Not that I ever bagged much game. In the first
  place I was an execrable marksman; I could hardly have hit an elephant at
  close range. In the second place, it seemed to me a shame to shoot so many
  things. A bush-antelope would bound up in front of me and race away, and I
  would sit watching him, admiring the slim, lithe figure, thrilled with the
  graceful beauty of the creature, my rifle lying idle across my saddle
  horn.</p>

  <p>The native boy who served as my gun-bearer began to suspect that I was
  deliberately refraining from shooting, and he began in a covert way to throw
  sneering hints about my womanishness. I was young and valued even the opinion
  of a native; which is very foolish. His remarks stung my pride, and one day I
  hauled him off his horse and pounded him until he yelled for mercy.
  Thereafter my doings were not questioned.</p>

  <p>But still I felt inferior when in the presence of the fetish-man. I could
  not get the other natives to talk about him. All I could get out of them was
  a scared rolling of the eyeballs, gesticulation indicative of fear, and vague
  information that the fetish-man dwelt among the tribes some distance in the
  interior. General opinion seemed to be that Senecoza was a good man to let
  alone.</p>

  <p>One incident made the mystery about the fetish-man take on, it seemed, a
  rather sinister form.</p>

  <p>In the mysterious way that news travels in Africa, and which white men so
  seldom hear of, we learned that Senecoza and a minor chief had had a falling
  out of some kind. It was vague and seemed to have no especial basis of fact.
  But shortly afterward that chief was found half-devoured by hyenas. That, in
  itself, was not unusual, but the fright with which the natives heard the news
  was. The chief was nothing to them; in fact he was something of a villain,
  but his killing seemed to inspire them with a fright that was little short of
  homicidal. When the black reaches a certain stage of fear, he is as dangerous
  as a cornered panther. The next time Senecoza called, they rose and fled en
  masse and did not return until he had taken his departure.</p>

  <p>Between the fear of the blacks, the tearing to pieces of the chief by the
  hyenas, and the fetish-man, I seemed to sense vaguely a connection of some
  kind. But I could not grasp the intangible thought.</p>

  <p>Not long thereafter, that thought was intensified by another incident. I
  had ridden far out on the veldt, accompanied by my servant. As we paused to
  rest our horses close to a kopje, I saw, upon the top, a hyena eyeing us.
  Rather surprised, for the beasts are not in the habit of thus boldly
  approaching man in the daytime, I raised my rifle and was taking a steady
  aim, for I always hated the things, when my servant caught my arm.</p>

  <p>"No shoot, <i>bwana</i>! No shoot!" he exclaimed hastily, jabbering a
  great deal in his own language, with which I was not familiar.</p>

  <p>"What's up?" I asked impatiently.</p>

  <p>He kept on jabbering and pulling my arm, until I gathered that the hyena
  was a fetish-beast of some kind.</p>

  <p>"Oh, all right," I conceded, lowering my rifle just as the hyena turned
  and sauntered out of sight.</p>

  <p>Something about the lank, repulsive beast and his shambling yet gracefully
  lithe walk struck my sense of humor with a ludicrous comparison.</p>

  <p>Laughing, I pointed toward the beast and said, "That fellow looks like a
  hyena-imitation of Senecoza, the fetish-man." My simple statement seemed to
  throw the native into a more abject fear than ever.</p>

  <p>He turned his pony and dashed off in the general direction of the ranch,
  looking back at me with a scared face.</p>

  <p>I followed, annoyed. And as I rode I pondered. Hyenas, a fetish-man, a
  chief torn to pieces, a countryside of natives in fear; what was the
  connection? I puzzled and puzzled, but I was new to Africa; I was young and
  impatient, and presently with a shrug of annoyance I discarded the whole
  problem.</p>

  <p>The next time Senecoza came to the ranch, he managed to stop directly in
  front of me. For a fleeting instant his glittering eyes looked into mine. And
  in spite of myself, I shuddered and stepped back, involuntarily, feeling much
  as a man feels who looks unaware into the eyes of a serpent. There was
  nothing tangible, nothing on which I could base a quarrel, but there was a
  distinct threat. Before my Nordic pugnacity could reassert itself, he was
  gone. I said nothing. But I knew that Senecoza hated me for some reason and
  that he plotted my killing. Why, I did not know.</p>

  <p>As for me, my distrust grew into bewildered rage, which in turn became
  hate.</p>

  <p>And then Ellen Farel came to the ranch. Why she should choose a trading-ranch in East Africa for a place to rest from the society life of New York, I
  do not know. Africa is no place for a woman. That is what Ludtvik, also a
  cousin of hers, told her, but he was overjoyed to see her. As for me, girls
  never interested me much; usually I felt like a fool in their presence and
  was glad to be out. But there were few whites in the vicinity and I tired of
  the company of Ludtvik.</p>

  <p>Ellen was standing on the wide veranda when I first saw her, a slim,
  pretty young thing, with rosy cheeks and hair like gold and large gray eyes.
  She was surprisingly winsome in her costume of riding-breeches, puttees,
  jacket and light helmet.</p>

  <p>I felt extremely awkward, dusty and stupid as I sat on my wiry African
  pony and stared at her.</p>

  <p>She saw a stocky youth of medium height, with sandy hair, eyes in which a
  kind of gray predominated; an ordinary, unhandsome youth, clad in dusty
  riding-clothes and a cartridge belt on one side of which was slung an ancient
  Colt of big caliber, and on the other a long, wicked hunting-knife.</p>

  <p>I dismounted, and she came forward, hand outstretched.</p>

  <p>"I'm Ellen," she said, "and I know you're Steve. Cousin Ludtvik has been
  telling me about you."</p>

  <p>I shook hands, surprised at the thrill the mere touch of her hand gave
  me.</p>

  <p>She was enthusiastic about the ranch. She was enthusiastic about
  everything. Seldom have I seen anyone who had more vigor and vim, more
  enjoyment of everything done. She fairly scintillated with mirth and
  gaiety.</p>

  <p>Ludtvik gave her the best horse on the place, and we rode much about the
  ranch and over the veldt.</p>

  <p>The blacks interested her much. They were afraid of her, not being used to
  white women. She would have been off her horse and playing with the
  pickaninnies if I had let her. She couldn't understand why she should treat
  the black people as dust beneath her feet. We had long arguments about it. I
  could not convince her, so I told her bluntly that she didn't know anything
  about it and she must do as I told her.</p>

  <p>She pouted her pretty lips and called me a tyrant, and then was off over
  the veldt like an antelope, laughing at me over her shoulder, her hair
  blowing free in the breeze.</p>

  <p>Tyrant! I was her slave from the first. Somehow the idea of becoming a
  lover never enter my mind. It was not the fact that she was several years
  older than I, or that she had a sweetheart (several of them, I think) back in
  New York. Simply, I worshipped her; her presence intoxicated me, and I could
  think of no more enjoyable existence than serving her as a devoted slave.</p>

  <p>I was mending a saddle one day when she came running in.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Steve!" she called; "there's the most romantic-looking savage! Come
  quick and tell me what his name is."</p>

  <p>She led me out of the veranda.</p>

  <p>"There he is," she said, naively pointing. Arms folded, haughty head
  thrown back, stood Senecoza.</p>

  <p>Ludtvik who was talking to him, paid no attention to the girl until he had
  completed his business with the fetish-man; and then, turning, he took her
  arm and they went into the house together.</p>

  <p>Again I was face to face with the savage; but this time he was not looking
  at me. With a rage amounting almost to madness, I saw that he was gazing
  after the girl. There was an expression in his serpentlike eyes&mdash;</p>

  <p>On the instant my gun was out and leveled. My hand shook like a leaf with
  the intensity of my fury. Surely I must shoot Senecoza down like the snake he
  was, shoot him down and riddle him, shoot him into a shredded heap!</p>

  <p>The fleeting expression left his eyes and they were fixed on me. Detached
  they seemed, inhuman in their sardonic calm. And I could not pull the
  trigger.</p>

  <p>For a moment we stood, and then he turned and strode away, a magnificent
  figure, while I glared after him and snarled with helpless fury.</p>

  <p>I sat down on the veranda. What a man of mystery was that savage! What
  strange power did he possess? Was I right, I wondered, in interpreting the
  fleeting expression as he gazed after the girl? It seemed to me, in my youth
  and folly, incredible that a black man, no matter what his rank, should look
  at a white woman as he did. Most astonishing of all, why could I not shoot
  him down?</p>

  <p>I started as a hand touched my arm.</p>

  <p>"What are you thinking about, Steve?" asked Ellen, laughing. Then before I
  could say anything, "Wasn't that chief, or whatever he was, a fine specimen
  of a savage? He invited us to come to his kraal; is that what you call it?
  It's away off in the veldt somewhere, and we're going."</p>

  <p>"No!" I exclaimed violently, springing up.</p>

  <p>"Why Steve," she gasped recoiling, "how rude! He's a perfect gentleman,
  isn't he, Cousin Ludtvik?"</p>

  <p>"<i>Ja</i>," nodded Ludtvik, placidly, "we go to his kraal sometime soon,
  maybe. A strong chief, that savage. His chief has perhaps good trade."</p>

  <p>"No!" I repeated furiously. "<i>I'll</i> go if somebody has to! Ellen's
  not going near that beast!"</p>

  <p>"Well, that's nice!" remarked Ellen, somewhat indignantly. "I guess you're
  my boss, mister man?"</p>

  <p>With all her sweetness, she had a mind of her own. In spite of all I could
  do, they arranged to go to the fetish-man's village the next day.</p>

  <p>That night the girl came out to me, where I sat on the veranda in the
  moonlight, and she sat down on the arm of my chair.</p>

  <p>"You're not angry at me, are you, Steve?" she said, wistfully, putting her
  arm around my shoulders. "Not mad, are you?"</p>

  <p>Mad? Yes, maddened by the touch of her soft body&mdash;such mad devotion
  as a slave feels. I wanted to grovel in the dust at her feet and kiss her
  dainty shoes. Will women never learn the effect they have on men?</p>

  <p>I took her hand hesitantly and pressed it to my lips. I think she must
  have sensed some of my devotion.</p>

  <p>"Dear Steve," she murmured, and the words were like a caress, "come, let's
  walk in the moonlight."</p>

  <p>We walked outside the stockade. I should have known better, for I had no
  weapon but the big Turkish dagger I carried and used for a hunting-knife, but
  she wished to.</p>

  <p>"Tell me about this Senecoza," she asked, and I welcomed the opportunity.
  And then I thought: what could I tell her? That hyenas had eaten a small
  chief of the Masai? That the natives feared the fetish-man? That he had
  looked at her?</p>

  <p>And then the girl screamed as out of the tall grass leaped a vague shape,
  half-seen in the moonlight.</p>

  <p>I felt a heavy, hairy form crash against my shoulders; keen fangs ripped
  my upflung arm. I went to the earth, fighting with frenzied horror. My jacket
  was slit to ribbons and the fangs were at my throat before I found and drew
  my knife and stabbed, blindly and savagely. I felt my blade rip into my foe,
  and then, like a shadow, it was gone. I staggered to my feet, somewhat
  shaken. The girl caught and steadied me.</p>

  <p>"What was it?" she gasped, leading me toward the stockade.</p>

  <p>"A hyena," I answered. "I could tell by the scent. But I never heard of
  one attacking like that."</p>

  <p>She shuddered. Later on, after my torn arm had been bandaged, she came
  close to me and said in a wondrously subdued voice, "Steve, I've decided not
  to go to the village, if you don't want me to."</p>

  <p>After the wounds on my arm had become scars Ellen and I resumed our rides,
  as might be expected. One day we had wandered rather far out on the veldt,
  and she challenged me to a race. Her horse easily distanced mine, and she
  stopped and waited for me, laughing.</p>

  <p>She had stopped on a sort of kopje, and she pointed to a clump of trees
  some distance away.</p>

  <p>"Trees!" she said gleefully. "Let's ride down there. There are so few
  trees on the veldt."</p>

  <p>And she dashed away. I followed some instinctive caution, loosening my
  pistol in its holster, and, drawing my knife, I thrust it down in my boot so
  that it was entirely concealed.</p>

  <p>We were perhaps halfway to the trees when from the tall grass about us
  leaped Senecoza and some twenty warriors.</p>

  <p>One seized the girl's bridle and the others rushed me. The one who caught
  at Ellen went down with a bullet between his eyes, and another crumpled at my
  second shot. Then a thrown war-club hurled me from the saddle,
  half-senseless, and as the blacks closed in on me I saw Ellen's horse, driven
  frantic by the prick of a carelessly handled spear, scream and rear,
  scattering the blacks who held her, and dash away at headlong speed, the bit
  in her teeth.</p>

  <p>I saw Senecoza leap on my horse and give chase, flinging a savage command
  over his shoulder; and both vanished over the kopje.</p>

  <p>The warriors bound me hand and foot and carried me into the trees. A hut
  stood among them&mdash;a native hut of thatch and bark. Somehow the sight of
  it set me shuddering. It seemed to lurk, repellent and indescribably
  malevolent amongst the trees; to hint of horrid and obscene rites; of
  voodoo.</p>

  <p>I know not why it is, but the sight of a native hut, alone and hidden, far
  from a village or tribe, always has to me a suggestion of nameless horror.
  Perhaps that is because only a black who is crazed or one who is so criminal
  that he has been exiled by his tribe will dwell that way.</p>

  <p>In front of the hut they threw me down.</p>

  <p>"When Senecoza returns with the girl," said they, "you will enter." And
  they laughed like fiends. Then, leaving one black to see that I did not
  escape, they left.</p>

  <p>The black who remained kicked me viciously; he was a bestial-looking
  Negro, armed with a trade-musket.</p>

  <p>"They go to kill white men, fool!" he mocked me. "They go to the ranches
  and trading-posts, first to that fool of an Englishman." Meaning Smith, the
  owner of a neighboring ranch.</p>

  <p>And he went on giving details. Senecoza had made the plot, he boasted.
  They would chase all the white men to the coast.</p>

  <p>"Senecoza is more than a man," he boasted. "You shall see, white man,"
  lowering his voice and glancing about him, from beneath his low, beetling
  brows; "you shall see the magic of Senecoza." And he grinned, disclosing
  teeth filed to points.</p>

  <p>"Cannibal!" I ejaculated, involuntarily. "A Masai?"</p>

  <p>"No," he answered. "A man of Senecoza."</p>

  <p>"Who will kill no white men," I jeered.</p>

  <p>He scowled savagely. "I will kill you, white man."</p>

  <p>"You dare not."</p>

  <p>"That is true," he admitted, and added angrily, "Senecoza will kill you
  himself."</p>

  <p>And meantime Ellen was riding like mad, gaining on the fetish-man, but
  unable to ride toward the ranch, for he had gotten between and was forcing
  her steadily out upon the veldt.</p>

  <p>The black unfastened my bonds. His line of reasoning was easy to see;
  absurdly easy. He could not kill a prisoner of the fetish-man, but he could
  kill him to prevent his escape. And he was maddened with the blood-lust.
  Stepping back, he half-raised his trade-musket, watching me as a snake
  watches a rabbit.</p>

  <p>It must have been about that time, as she afterward told me, that Ellen's
  horse stumbled and threw her. Before she could rise, the black had leaped
  from his horse and seized her in his arms. She screamed and fought, but he
  gripped her, held her helpless and laughed at her. Tearing her jacket to
  pieces, he bound her arms and legs, remounted and started back, carrying the
  half-fainting girl in front of him.</p>

  <p>Back in front of the hut I rose slowly. I rubbed my arms where the ropes
  had been, moved a little closer to the black, stretched, stooped and rubbed
  my legs; then with a catlike bound I was on him, my knife flashing from my
  boot. The trade-musket crashed and the charge whizzed above my head as I
  knocked up the barrel and closed with him. Hand to hand, I would have been no
  match for the black giant; but I had the knife. Clinched close together we
  were too close for him to use the trade-musket for a club. He wasted time
  trying to do that, and with a desperate effort I threw him off his balance
  and drove the dagger to the hilt in his black chest.</p>

  <p>I wrenched it out again; I had no other weapon, for I could find no more
  ammunition for the trade-musket.</p>

  <p>I had no idea which way Ellen had fled. I assumed she had gone toward the
  ranch, and in that direction I took my way. Smith must be warned. The
  warriors were far ahead of me. Even then they might be creeping up about the
  unsuspecting ranch.</p>

  <p>I had not covered a fourth of the distance, when a drumming of hoofs
  behind me caused me to turn my head. Ellen's horse was thundering toward me,
  riderless. I caught her as she raced past me, and managed to stop her. The
  story was plain. The girl had either reached a place of safety and had turned
  the horse loose, or what was much more likely, had been captured, the horse
  escaping and fleeing toward the ranch, as a horse will do. I gripped the
  saddle, torn with indecision. Finally I leaped on the horse and sent her
  flying toward Smith's ranch. It was not many miles; Smith must not be
  massacred by those black devils, and I must find a gun if I escaped to rescue
  the girl from Senecoza.</p>

  <p>A half-mile from Smith's I overtook the raiders and went through them like
  drifting smoke. The workers at Smith's place were startled by a wild-riding
  horseman charging headlong into the stockade, shouting, "Masai! Masai! A
  raid, you fools!" snatching a gun and flying out again.</p>

  <p>So when the savages arrived they found everybody ready for them, and they
  got such a warm reception that after one attempt they turned tail and fled
  back across the veldt.</p>

  <p>And I was riding as I never rode before. The mare was almost exhausted,
  but I pushed her mercilessly. On, on!</p>

  <p>I aimed for the only place I knew likely. The hut among the trees. I
  assumed that the fetish-man would return there.</p>

  <p>And long before the hut came into sight, a horseman dashed from the grass,
  going at right angles to my course, and our horses, colliding, sent both
  tired animals to the ground.</p>

  <p>"Steve!" It was a cry of joy mingled with fear. Ellen lay, tied hand and
  foot, gazing up at me wildly as I regained my feet.</p>

  <p>Senecoza came with a rush, his long knife flashing in the sunlight. Back
  and forth we fought&mdash;slash, ward and parry, my ferocity and agility
  matching his savagery and skill.</p>

  <p>A terrific lunge which he aimed at me, I caught on my point, laying his
  arm open, and then with a quick engage and wrench, disarmed him. But before I
  could use my advantage, he sprang away into the grass and vanished.</p>

  <p>I caught up the girl, slashing her bonds, and she clung to me, poor child,
  until I lifted her and carried her toward the horses. But we were not yet
  through with Senecoza. He must have had a rifle cached away somewhere in the
  bush, for the first I knew of him was when a bullet spat within a foot above
  my head.</p>

  <p>I caught at the bridles, and then I saw that the mare had done all she
  could, temporarily. She was exhausted. I swung Ellen up on the horse.</p>

  <p>"Ride for our ranch," I ordered her. "The raiders are out, but you can get
  through. Ride low and ride fast!"</p>

  <p>"But you, Steve!"</p>

  <p>"Go, go!" I ordered, swinging her horse around and starting it. She dashed
  away, looking at me wistfully over her shoulder. Then I snatched the rifle
  and a handful of cartridges I had gotten at Smith's, and took to the bush.
  And through the hot African day, Senecoza and I played a game of hide-and-seek. Crawling, slipping in and out of the scanty veldt-bushes, crouching in
  the tall grass, we traded shots back and forth. A movement of the grass, a
  snapping twig, the rasp of grass-blades, and a bullet came questing, another
  answering it.</p>

  <p>I had but a few cartridges and I fired carefully, but presently I pushed
  my one remaining cartridge into the rifle&mdash;a big, six-bore, single-barrel breech-loader, for I had not had time to pick when I snatched it
  up.</p>

  <p>I crouched in my covert and watched for the black to betray himself by a
  careless movement. Not a sound, not a whisper among the grasses. Away off
  over the veldt a hyena sounded his fiendish laugh and another answered,
  closer at hand. The cold sweat broke out on my brow.</p>

  <p>What was that? A drumming of many horses' hoofs! Raiders returning? I
  ventured a look and could have shouted for joy. At least twenty men were
  sweeping toward me, white men and ranch-boys, and ahead of them all rode
  Ellen! They were still some distance away. I darted behind a tall bush and
  rose, waving my hand to attract their attention.</p>

  <p>They shouted and pointed to something beyond me. I whirled and saw, some
  thirty yards away, a huge hyena slinking toward me, rapidly. I glanced
  carefully across the veldt. Somewhere out there, hidden by the billowing
  grasses, lurked Senecoza. A shot would betray to him my position&mdash;and I
  had but one cartridge. The rescue party was still out of range.</p>

  <p>I looked again at the hyena. He was still rushing toward me. There was no
  doubt as to his intentions. His eyes glittered like a fiend's from Hell, and
  a scar on his shoulder showed him to be the same beast that had once before
  attacked me. Then a kind of horror took hold of me, and resting the old
  elephant rifle over my elbow, I sent my last bullet crashing through the
  bestial thing. With a scream that seemed to have a horribly human note in it,
  the hyena turned and fled back into the bush, reeling as it ran.</p>

  <p>And the rescue party swept up around me.</p>

  <p>A fusillade of bullets crashed through the bush from which Senecoza had
  sent his last shot. There was no reply.</p>

  <p>"Ve hunt ter snake down," quoth Cousin Ludtvik, his Boer accent increasing
  with his excitement. And we scattered through the veldt in a skirmish line,
  combing every inch of it warily.</p>

  <p>Not a trace of the fetish-man did we find. A rifle we found, empty, with
  empty shells scattered about, and (which was very strange) <i>hyena tracks
  leading away from the rifle</i>.</p>

  <p>I felt the short hairs of my neck bristle with intangible horror. We
  looked at each other, and said not a word, as with a tacit agreement we took
  up the trail of the hyena.</p>

  <p>We followed it as it wound in and out in the shoulder-high grass, showing
  how it had slipped up on me, stalking me as a tiger stalks its victim. We
  struck the trail the thing had made, returning to the bush after I had shot
  it. Splashes of blood marked the way it had taken. We followed.</p>

  <p>"It leads toward the fetish-hut," muttered an Englishman. "Here, sirs, is
  a damnable mystery."</p>

  <p>And Cousin Ludtvik ordered Ellen to stay back, leaving two men with
  her.</p>

  <p>We followed the trail over the kopje and into the clump of trees. Straight
  to the door of the hut it led. We circled the hut cautiously, but no tracks
  led away. It was inside the hut. Rifles ready, we forced the rude door.</p>

  <p><i>No tracks led away from the hut and no tracks led to it except the
  tracks of the hyena. Yet there was no hyena within that hut; and on the dirt
  floor, a bullet through his black breast, lay Senecoza, the
  fetish-man.</i></p>
