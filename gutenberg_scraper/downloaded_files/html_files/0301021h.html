<p>. . . <i>of wandering for ever and the earth again . . . of
seed-time, bloom, and the mellow-dropping harvest. And of the big
flowers, the rich flowers, the strange unknown flowers.</i></p>

<p><i>Where shall the weary rest? When shall the lonely of heart
come home? What doors are open for the wanderer? And which of us
shall find his father, know his face, and in what place, and in
what time, and in what land? Where? Where the weary of heart can
abide for ever, where the weary of wandering can find peace,
where the tumult, the fever, and the fret shall be for ever
stilled.</i></p>

<p><i>Who owns the earth? Did we want the earth that we should
wander on it? Did we need the earth that we were never still upon
it? Whoever needs the earth shall have the earth: he shall be
still upon it, he shall rest within a little place, he shall
dwell in one small room for ever.</i></p>

<p><i>Did he feel the need of a thousand tongues that he sought
thus through the moil and horror of a thousand furious streets?
He shall need a tongue no longer, he shall need no tongue for
silence and the earth: he shall speak no word through the rooted
lips, the snake's cold eye will peer for him through sockets of
the brain, there will be no cry out of the heart where wells the
vine.</i></p>

<p><i>The tarantula is crawling through the rotted oak, the adder
lisps against the breast, cups fall: but the earth will endure
for ever. The flower of love is living in the wilderness, and the
elm-root threads the bones of buried lovers.</i></p>

<p><i>The dead tongue withers and the dead heart rots, blind
mouths crawl tunnels through the buried flesh, but the earth will
endure for ever; hair grows like April on the buried breast and
from the sockets of the brain the death flowers grow and will not
perish.</i></p>

<p><i>O flower of love whose strong lips drink us downward into
death, in all things far and fleeting, enchantress of our twenty
thousand days, the brain will madden and the heart be twisted,
broken by her kiss, but glory, glory, glory, she remains:
Immortal love, alone and aching in the wilderness, we cried to
you: You were not absent from our loneliness.</i></p>

<h1>I</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>About fifteen years ago, at the end of the second decade of
this century, four people were standing together on the platform
of the railway station of a town in the hills of western Catawba.
This little station, really just a suburban adjunct of the larger
town which, behind the concealing barrier of a rising ground,
swept away a mile or two to the west and north, had become in
recent years the popular point of arrival and departure for
travellers to and from the cities of the east, and now, in fact,
accommodated a much larger traffic than did the central station
of the town, which was situated two miles westward around the
powerful bend of the rails. For this reason a considerable number
of people were now assembled here, and from their words and
gestures, a quietly suppressed excitement that somehow seemed to
infuse the drowsy mid-October afternoon with an electric
vitality, it was possible to feel the thrill and menace of the
coming train.</p>

<p>An observer would have felt in the complexion of this
gathering a somewhat mixed quality--a quality that was at once
strange and familiar, alien and native, cosmopolitan and
provincial. It was not the single native quality of the usual
crowd that one saw on the station platforms of the typical
Catawba town as the trains passed through. This crowd was more
mixed and varied, and it had a strong colouring of worldly
smartness, the element of fashionable sophistication that one
sometimes finds in a place where a native and alien population
have come together. And such an inference was here warranted: the
town of Altamont a mile or so away was a well-known resort and
the mixed gathering on the station platform was fairly
representative of its population. But all of these people, both
strange and native, had been drawn here by a common experience,
an event which has always been of first interest in the lives of
all Americans. This event is the coming of the train.</p>

<p>It would have been evident to an observer that of the four
people who were standing together at one end of the platform
three--the two women and the boy--were connected by the
relationship of blood. A stranger would have known instantly that
the boy and the young woman were brother and sister and that the
woman was their mother. The relationship was somehow one of tone,
texture, time, and energy, and of the grain and temper of the
spirit. The mother was a woman of small but strong and solid
figure. Although she was near her sixtieth year, her hair was
jet-black and her face, full of energy and power, was almost as
smooth and unlined as the face of a girl. Her hair was brushed
back from a forehead which was high, white, full, and
naked-looking, and which, together with the expression of her
eyes, which were brown, and rather worn and weak, but constantly
thoughtful, constantly reflective, gave her face the expression
of straight grave innocence that children have, and also of
strong native intelligence and integrity. Her skin was
milk-white, soft of texture, completely colourless save for the
nose, which was red, broad and fleshy at the base, and curiously
masculine.</p>

<p>A stranger seeing her for the first time would have known
somehow that the woman was a member of a numerous family, and
that her face had the tribal look. He would somehow have felt
certain that the woman had brothers and that if he could see
them, they would look like her. Yet, this masculine quality was
not a quality of sex, for the woman, save for the broad manlike
nose, was as thoroughly female as a woman could be. It was rather
a quality of tribe and character--a tribe and character that was
decisively masculine.</p>

<p>The final impression of the woman might have been this:--that
her life was somehow above and beyond a moral judgment, that no
matter what the course or chronicle of her life may have been, no
matter what crimes of error, avarice, ignorance, or
thoughtlessness might be charged to her, no matter what suffering
or evil consequences may have resulted to other people through
any act of hers, her life was somehow beyond these accidents of
time, training, and occasion, and the woman was as guiltless as a
child, a river, an avalanche, or any force of nature
whatsoever.</p>

<p>The younger of the two women was about thirty years old. She
was a big woman, nearly six feet tall, large, and loose of bone
and limb, almost gaunt. Both women were evidently creatures of
tremendous energy, but where the mother suggested a constant,
calm, and almost tireless force, the daughter was plainly one of
those big, impulsive creatures of the earth who possess a
terrific but undisciplined vitality, which they are ready to
expend with a whole-souled and almost frenzied prodigality on any
person, enterprise, or object which appeals to their grand
affections.</p>

<p>This difference between the two women was also reflected in
their faces. The face of the mother, for all its amazing
flexibility, the startled animal-like intentness with which her
glance darted from one object to another, and the mobility of her
powerful and delicate mouth, which she pursed and convolved with
astonishing flexibility in such a way as to show the constant
reflective effort of her mind, was nevertheless the face of a
woman whose spirit had an almost elemental quality of patience,
fortitude and calm.</p>

<p>The face of the younger woman was large, high-boned, and
generous and already marked by the frenzy and unrest of her own
life. At moments it bore legibly and terribly the tortured stain
of hysteria, of nerves stretched to the breaking point, of the
furious impatience, unrest and dissonance of her own tormented
spirit, and of impending exhaustion and collapse for her
overwrought vitality. Yet, in an instant, this gaunt, strained,
tortured, and almost hysterical face could be transformed by an
expression of serenity, wisdom and repose that would work
unbelievably a miracle of calm and radiant beauty on the nervous,
gaunt, and tortured features.</p>

<p>Now, each in her own way, the two women were surveying the
other people on the platform and the new arrivals with a ravenous
and absorptive interest, bestowing on each a wealth of
information, comment, and speculation which suggested an
encyclop&aelig;dic knowledge of the history of every one in the
community.</p>

<p>"--Why, yes, child," the mother was saying impatiently, as she
turned her quick glance from a group of people who at the moment
were the subject of discussion--"that's what I'm telling
you!--Don't I know? . . . Didn't I grow up with all those people?
. . . Wasn't Emma Smathers one of my girlhood friends? . . . That
boy's not this woman's child at all. He's Emma Smathers' child by
that first marriage."</p>

<p>"Well, that's news to me," the younger woman answered. "That's
certainly news to me. I never knew Steve Randolph had been
married more than once. I'd always thought that all that bunch
were Mrs. Randolph's children."</p>

<p>"Why, of course not!" the mother cried impatiently. "She never
had any of them except Lucille. All the rest of them were Emma's
children. Steve Randolph was a man of forty-five when he married
her. He'd been a widower for years--poor Emma died in childbirth
when Bernice was born--nobody ever thought he'd marry again and
nobody ever expected this woman to have any children of her own,
for she was almost as old as he was--why, yes!--hadn't she been
married before, a widow, you know, when she met him, came here
after her first husband's death from some place way out West--oh,
Wyoming, or Nevada or Idaho, one of those States, you know--and
had never had chick nor child, as the saying goes--till she
married Steve. And that woman was every day of forty-four years
old when Lucille was born."</p>

<p>"Uh-huh! . . . Ah-hah! the younger woman muttered absently, in
a tone of rapt and fascinated interest, as she looked distantly
at the people in the other group, and reflectively stroked her
large chin with a big, bony hand. "So Lucille, then, is really
John's half-sister?"</p>

<p>"Why, of course!" the mother cried. "I thought every one knew
that. Lucille's the only one that this woman can lay claim to.
The rest of them were Emma's."</p>

<p>"--Well, that's certainly news to me," the younger woman said
slowly as before. "It's the first <i>I</i> ever heard of it. . .
. And you say she was forty-four when Lucille was born?"</p>

<p>"Now, she was all of <i>that,"</i> the mother said. "I know.
And she may have been even older."</p>

<p>"Well," the younger woman said, and now she turned to her
silent husband, Barton, with a hoarse snigger, "it just goes to
show that while there's life there's hope, doesn't it? So cheer
up, honey," she said to him, "we may have a chance yet." But
despite her air of rough banter her clear eyes for a moment had a
look of deep pain and sadness in them.</p>

<p>"Chance!" the mother cried strongly, with a little scornful
pucker of the lips--"why, of course there is! If I was your age
again I'd have a dozen--and never think a thing of it." For a
moment she was silent, pursing her reflective lips. Suddenly a
faint sly smile began to flicker at the edges of her lips, and
turning to the boy, she addressed him with an air of sly and
bantering mystery:</p>

<p>"Now, boy," she said--"there's lots of things that you don't
know . . . you always thought you were the last--the
youngest--didn't you?"</p>

<p>"Well, wasn't I?" he said.</p>

<p>"H'm!" she said with a little scornful smile and an air of
great mystery--"There's lots that I could tell you--"</p>

<p>"Oh, my God!" he groaned, turning towards his sister with an
imploring face. "More mysteries! . . . The next thing I'll find
that there were five sets of triplets after I was born--Well,
come on, Mama," he cried impatiently. "Don't hint around all day
about it. . . . What's the secret now--how many were there?"</p>

<p>"H'm!" she said with a little bantering, scornful, and
significant smile.</p>

<p>"O Lord!" he groaned again--"Did she ever tell you what it
was?" Again he turned imploringly to his sister.</p>

<p>She snickered hoarsely, a strange high-husky and derisive
falsetto laugh, at the same time prodding him stiffly in the ribs
with her big fingers:</p>

<p>"Hi, hi, hi, hi, hi," she laughed. "More spooky business, hey?
You don't know the half of it. She'll be telling you next you
were only the fourteenth."</p>

<p>"H'm!" the older woman said, with a little scornful smile of
her pursed lips. "Now I could tell him more than that! The
fourteenth! Pshaw!" she said contemptuously--"I could tell
him--"</p>

<p>"O God!" he groaned miserably. "I knew it! . . . I don't want
to hear it."</p>

<p>"K, k, k, k, k," the younger woman snickered derisively,
prodding him in the ribs again.</p>

<p>"No, sir," the older woman went on strongly--"and that's not
all either!--Now, boy, I want to tell you something that you
didn't know," and as she spoke she turned the strange and worn
stare of her serious brown eyes on him, and levelled a
half-clasped hand, fingers pointing, a gesture loose, casual, and
instinctive and powerful as a man's.--"There's a lot I could tell
you that you never heard. Long years after you were born,
child--why, at the time I took you children to the Saint Louis
Fair--" here her face grew stern and sad, she pursed her lips
strongly and shook her head with a short convulsive
movement--"oh, when I think of it--to think what I went
through--oh, awful, awful, you know," she whispered
ominously.</p>

<p>"Now, Mama, for God's sake, I don't want to hear it!" he
fairly shouted, beside himself with exasperation and foreboding.
"God-damn it, can we have no peace--even when I go away!" he
cried bitterly, and illogically. "Always these damned gloomy
hints and revelations--this Pentland spooky stuff," he
yelled--"this damned I-could-if-I-wanted-to-tell-you air of
mystery, horror, and damnation!" he shouted incoherently. "Who
cares? What does it matter?" he cried, adding desperately, "I
don't want to hear about it--No one cares."</p>

<p>"Why, child, now, I was only saying--" she began hastily and
diplomatically.</p>

<p>"All right, all right, all right," he muttered. "I don't
care--"</p>

<p>"But, as I say, now," she resumed.</p>

<p>"I don't care!" he shouted. "Peace, peace, peace, peace,
peace," he muttered in a crazy tone as he turned to his sister.
"A moment's peace for all of us before we die. A moment of peace,
peace, peace."</p>

<p>"Why, boy, I'll vow," the mother said in a vexed tone, fixing
her reproving glance on him, "what on earth's come over you? You
act like a regular crazy man. I'll vow you do."</p>

<p>"A moment's peace!" he muttered again, thrusting one hand
wildly through his hair. "I beg and beseech you for a moment's
peace before we perish!"</p>

<p>"K, k, k, k, k," the younger woman snickered derisively, as
she poked him stiffly in the ribs--"There's no peace for the
weary. It's like that river that goes on for ever," she said with
a faint loose curving of lewd humour around the edges of her
generous big mouth--"Now you see, don't you?" she said, looking
at him with this lewd and challenging look. "You see what it's
like now, don't you? . . . <i>You're</i> the lucky one!
<i>You</i> got away! You're smart enough to go way off somewhere
to college--to Boston--Harvard--anywhere--but <i>you're</i> away
from it. You get it for a short time when you come home. How do
you think <i>I</i> stand it?" she said challengingly. "I have to
hear it <i>all</i> the time. . . . Oh, <i>all</i> the time, and
<i>all</i> the time, and <i>all</i> the time!" she said with a
kind of weary desperation. "If they'd only leave me <i>alone</i>
for five minutes some time I think I'd be able to pull myself
together, but it's this way <i>all</i> the time and <i>all</i>
the time and <i>all</i> the time. You see, don't you?"</p>

<p>But now, having finished, in a tone of hoarse and panting
exasperation, her frenzied protest, she relapsed immediately into
a state of marked, weary, and dejected resignation.</p>

<p>"Well, I know, I know," she said in a weary and indifferent
voice. ". . . Forget about it . . . Talking does no good . . .
Just try to make the best of it the little time you're here. . .
. I used to think something could be done about it . . . but I
know different now," she muttered, although she would have been
unable to explain the logical meaning of these incoherent and
disjointed phrases.</p>

<p>"Hah? . . . What say?" the mother now cried sharply, darting
her glances from one to another with the quick, startled,
curiously puzzled intentness of an animal or a bird. "What say?"
she cried sharply again, as no one answered. "I thought--"</p>

<p>But fortunately, at this moment, this strange and disturbing
flash in which had been revealed the blind and tangled purposes,
the powerful and obscure impulses, the tormented nerves, the
whole tragic perplexity of soul which was of the very fabric of
their lives, was interrupted by a commotion in one of the groups
upon the platform, and by a great guffaw of laughter which
instantly roused these three people from this painful and
perplexing scene, and directed their startled attention to the
place from which the laughter came.</p>

<p>And now again they heard the great guffaw--a solid "Haw! Haw!
Haw!" which was full of such an infectious exuberance of animal
good-nature that other people on the platform began to smile
instinctively, and to look affectionately towards the owner of
the laugh.</p>

<p>Already, at the sound of the laugh, the young woman had
forgotten the weary and dejected resignation of the moment
before, and with an absent and yet eager look of curiosity in her
eyes, she was staring towards the group from which the laugh had
come, and herself now laughing absently, she was stroking her big
chin in a gesture of meditative curiosity, saying:</p>

<p>"Hah! Hah! Hah! . . . That's George Pentland. . . . You can
tell him anywhere by his laugh."</p>

<p>"Why, yes," the mother was saying briskly, with satisfaction.
"That's George all right. I'd know him in the dark the minute
that I heard that laugh.--And say, what about it? He's always had
it--why, ever since he was a kid-boy--and was going around with
Steve. . . . Oh, he'd come right out with it anywhere, you know,
in Sunday school, church, or while the preacher was sayin'
prayers before collection--that big, loud laugh, you know, that
you could hear, from here to yonder, as the sayin' goes. . . .
Now I don't know where it comes from--none of the others ever had
it in our family; now we all liked to laugh well enough, but I
never heard no such laugh as that from any of 'em--there's one
thing sure, Will Pentland never laughed like that in his
life--Oh, Pett, you know! Pett!"--a scornful and somewhat
malicious look appeared on the woman's face as she referred to
her brother's wife in that whining and affected tone with which
women imitate the speech of other women whom they do not
like--"Pett got so mad at him one time when he laughed right out
in church that she was goin' to take the child right home an'
whip him.--Told me, says to me, you know--'Oh, I could wring his
neck! He'll disgrace us all,' she says, 'unless I cure him of
it,' says, 'He burst right out in that great roar of his while
Doctor Baines was sayin' his prayers this morning until you
couldn't hear a word the preacher said.' Said, 'I was so
mortified to think he could do a thing like that that I'd a-beat
the blood right out of him if I'd had my buggy whip,' says, 'I
don't know where it comes from'--oh, sneerin'-like, you know,"
the woman said, imitating the other woman's voice with a sneering
and viperous dislike--"'I don't know where it comes from unless
it's some of that common Pentland blood comin' out in him'--'Now
you listen to me,' I says; oh, I looked her in the eye, you
know"--here the woman looked at her daughter with the straight
steady stare of her worn brown eyes, illustrating her speech with
the loose and powerful gesture of the half-clasped
finger-pointing hand--"'you listen to me. I don't know where that
child gets his laugh,' I says, 'but you can bet your bottom
dollar that he never got it from his father--or any other
Pentland that I ever heard of--for none of them ever laughed that
way--Will, or Jim, or Sam, or George, or Ed, or Father, or even
Uncle Bacchus,' I said--'no, nor old Bill Pentland either, who
was that child's great-grandfather--for I've seen an' heard 'em
all,' I says. 'And as for this common Pentland blood you speak
of, Pett'--oh, I guess I talked to her pretty straight, you
know," she said with a little bitter smile, and the short,
powerful, and convulsive tremor of her strong pursed lips--"'as
for that common Pentland blood you speak of, Pett,' I says, 'I
never heard of that either--for we stood high in the community,'
I says, 'and we all felt that Will was lowerin' himself when he
married a Creasman!'"</p>

<p>"Oh, you didn't say that, Mama, surely not," the young woman
said with a hoarse, protesting, and yet abstracted laugh,
continuing to survey the people on the platform with a bemused
and meditative curiosity, and stroking her big chin thoughtfully
as she looked at them, pausing from time to time to grin in a
comical and rather formal manner, bow graciously and murmur:</p>

<p>"How-do-you-do? ah-hah! How-do-you-do, Mrs. Willis?"</p>

<p>"Haw! Haw! Haw!" Again the great laugh of empty animal good
nature burst out across the station platform, and this time
George Pentland turned from the group of which he was a member
and looked vacantly around him, his teeth bared with savage joy,
as, with two brown fingers of his strong left hand, he dug
vigorously into the muscular surface of his hard thigh. It was an
animal reflex, instinctive and unconscious, habitual to him in
moments of strong mirth.</p>

<p>He was a powerful and handsome young man in his early
thirties, with coal-black hair, a strong thick neck, powerful
shoulders, and the bull vitality of the athlete. He had a red,
sensual, curiously animal and passionate face, and when he
laughed his great guffaw, his red lips were bared over two rows
of teeth that were white and regular and solid as ivory.</p>

<p>--But now, the paroxysm of that savage and mindless laughter
having left him, George Pentland had suddenly espied the mother
and her children, waved to them in genial greeting, and excusing
himself from his companions--a group of young men and women who
wore the sporting look and costume of "the country club
crowd"--he was walking towards his kinsmen at an indolent
swinging stride, pausing to acknowledge heartily the greetings of
people on every side, with whom he was obviously a great
favourite.</p>

<p>As he approached, he bared his strong white teeth again in
greeting, and in a drawling, rich-fibred voice, which had
unmistakably the Pentland quality of sensual fullness, humour,
and assurance, and a subtle but gloating note of pleased
self-satisfaction, he said:</p>

<p>"Hello, Aunt Eliza, how are you? Hello, Helen--how are you,
Hugh?" he said in his high, somewhat accusing, but very strong
and masculine voice, putting his big hand in an easy affectionate
way on Barton's arm. "Where the hell you been keepin' yourself,
anyway?" he said accusingly. "Why don't some of you folks come
over to see us sometime? Elk was askin' about you all the other
day--wanted to know why Helen didn't come round more often."</p>

<p>"Well, George, I tell you how it is," the young woman said
with an air of great sincerity and earnestness. "Hugh and I have
intended to come over a hundred times, but life has been just one
damned thing after another all summer long. If I could only have
a moment's peace--if I could only get away by myself for a
moment--if <i>they</i> would only leave me <i>alone</i> for an
hour at a time, I think I could get myself together again--do you
know what I mean, George?" she said hoarsely and eagerly, trying
to enlist him in her sympathetic confidence--"If they'd only do
something for <i>themselves</i> once in a while--but they
<i>all</i> come to me when anything goes wrong--they never let me
have a moment's peace--until at times I think I'm going crazy--I
get <i>queer</i>--funny, you know," she said vaguely and
incoherently. "I don't know whether something happened Tuesday or
last week or if I just imagined it." And for a moment her big
gaunt face had the dull strained look of hysteria.</p>

<p>"The strain on her has been very great this summer," said
Barton in a deep and grave tone. "It's--it's," he paused
carefully, deeply, searching for a word, and looked down as he
flicked an ash from his long cigar, "it's--been too much for her.
Everything's on her shoulders," he concluded in his deep grave
voice.</p>

<p>"My God, George, what is it?" she said quietly and simply, in
the tone of one begging for enlightenment. "Is it going to be
this way all our lives? Is there never going to be any peace or
happiness for us? Does it always have to be this way? Now I want
to ask you--is there nothing in the world but trouble?"</p>

<p>"Trouble!" he said derisively. "Why, I've had more trouble
than any one of you ever heard of. . . . I've had enough to kill
a dozen people . . . but when I saw it wasn't goin' to kill me, I
quit worryin'. . . . So you do the same thing," he advised
heartily. "Hell, don't <i>worry,</i> Helen! . . . It never got
you anywhere. . . . You'll be all right," he said. "You got
nothin' to worry over. You don't know what trouble is."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'd be all right, George--I think I could stand
anything--all the rest of it--if it wasn't for Papa. . . . I'm
almost crazy from worrying about him this summer. There were
three times there when I knew he was gone. . . . And I honestly
believe I pulled him back each time by main strength and
determination--do you know what I mean?" she said hoarsely and
eagerly--"I was just determined not to let him go. If his heart
had stopped beating I believe I could have done something to make
it start again--I'd have stood over him and blown my breath into
him--got my blood into him--shook him," she said with a powerful,
nervous movement of her big hands--"anything just to keep him
alive."</p>

<p>"She's--she's--saved his life--time after time," said Barton
slowly, flicking his cigar ash carefully away, and looking down
deeply, searching for a word.</p>

<p>"He'd--he'd--have been a dead man long ago--if it hadn't been
for her."</p>

<p>"Yeah--I know she has," George Pentland drawled agreeably. "I
know you've sure stuck by Uncle Will--I guess he knows it,
too."</p>

<p>"It's not that I mind it, George--you know what I mean?" she
said eagerly. "Good heavens! I believe I could give away a dozen
lives if I thought it was going to save his life! . . . But it's
the <i>strain</i> of it. . . . Month after month . . . year after
year . . . lying awake at night wondering if he's all right over
there in that back room in Mama's house--wondering if he's
keeping warm in that old cold house--"</p>

<p>"Why, no, child," the older woman said hastily. "I kept a good
fire burnin' in that room all last winter--that was the warmest
room in the whole place--there wasn't a warmer--"</p>

<p>But immediately she was engulfed, swept aside, obliterated in
the flood-tide of the other's speech.</p>

<p>"--Wondering if he's sick or needs me--if he's begun to bleed
again--oh! George, it makes me sick to think about it--that poor
old man left there all alone, rotting away with that awful
cancer, with that horrible smell about him all the
time--everything he wears gets simply <i>stiff</i> with that
rotten corrupt matter--Do you know what it is to wait, wait,
wait, year after year, and year after year, never knowing when
he's going to die, to have him hang on by a thread until it seems
you've lived forever--that there'll never be an end--that you'll
never have a chance to live your own life--to have a moment's
peace or rest or happiness yourself? My God, does it always have
to be this way? . . . Can I never have a moment's happiness? . .
. Must they <i>always</i> come to me? Does <i>everything</i> have
to be put on my shoulders? . . . Will you tell me that?" Her
voice had risen to a note of frenzied despair. She was glaring at
her cousin with a look of desperate and frantic entreaty, her
whole gaunt figure tense and strained with the stress of her
hysteria.</p>

<p>"That's--that's the trouble now," said Barton, looking down
and searching for the word. "She's . . . She's . . . made the
goat for every one. . . . She . . . she has to do it all. . . .
That's . . . that's the thing that's got her down."</p>

<p>"Not that I mind--if it will do any good. . . . Good heaven's,
Papa's life means more to me than anything on earth. . . . I'd
keep him alive at any cost as long as there was a breath left in
him. . . . But it's the strain of it, the <i>strain</i> of it--to
wait, to wait year after year, to feel it hanging over you all
the time, never to know when he will die--always the
<i>strain,</i> the strain--do you see what I mean, George?" she
said hoarsely, eagerly, and pleadingly. "You see, don't you?"</p>

<p>"I sure do, Helen," he said sympathetically, digging at his
thigh, and with a swift, cat-like grimace of his features. "I
know it's been mighty tough on you. . . . How is Uncle Will now?"
he said. "Is he any better?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes," the mother was saying, "he seemed to improve--"
but she was cut off immediately.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," the daughter said in a tone of weary dejection. "He
pulled out of this last spell and got well enough to make the
trip to Baltimore--we sent him back a week ago to take another
course of treatments. . . . But it does no real good, George. . .
. They can't cure him. . . . We know that now. . . . They've told
us that. . . . It only prolongs the agony. . . . They help him
for a little while and then it all begins again. . . . Poor old
man!" she said, and her eyes were wet. "I'd give everything I
have--my own blood, my own life--if it would do him any
good--but, George, he's gone!" she said desperately. "Can't you
understand that? . . . They can't save him! . . . Nothing can
save him! . . . Papa's a dead man now!"</p>

<p>George looked gravely sympathetic for a moment, winced
swiftly, dug hard fingers in his thigh, and then said:</p>

<p>"Who went to Baltimore with him?"</p>

<p>"Why, Luke's up there," the mother said. "We had a letter from
him yesterday--said Mr. Gant looks much better already--eats
well, you know, has a good appetite--and Luke says he's in good
spirits. Now--"</p>

<p>"Oh, Mama, for heaven's sake!" the daughter cried. "What's the
use of talking that way? . . . He's not getting any better. . . .
Papa's a sick man--dying--good God! Can no one ever get that into
their heads!" she burst out furiously. "Am I the only one that
realizes how sick he is?"</p>

<p>"No, now I was only sayin'," the mother began hastily--"Well,
as I say, then," she went on, "Luke's up there with him--and
Gene's on his way there now--he's goin' to stop off there
tomorrow on his way up north to school."</p>

<p>"Gene!" cried George Pentland in a high, hearty, bantering
tone, turning to address the boy directly for the first time.
"What's all this I hear about you, son?" He clasped his muscular
hand around the boy's arm in a friendly but powerful grip. "Ain't
one college enough for you, boy?" he drawled, becoming
deliberately ungrammatical and speaking good-naturedly but with a
trace of the mockery which the wastrel and ne'er-do-well
sometimes feels towards people who have had the energy and
application required for steady or concentrated effort. "Are you
one of those fellers who needs two or three colleges to hold him
down?"</p>

<p>The boy flushed, grinned uncertainly, and said nothing.</p>

<p>"Why, son," drawled George in his hearty, friendly and yet
bantering tone, in which a note of malice was evident, "you'll be
gettin' so educated an' high-brow here before long that you won't
be able to talk to the rest of us at all. . . . You'll be
floatin' around there so far up in the clouds that you won't even
see a roughneck like me, much less talk to him"--As he went on
with this kind of sarcasm, his speech had become almost
deliberately illiterate, as if trying to emphasize the superior
virtue of the rough, hearty, home-grown fellow in comparison with
the bookish scholar.</p>

<p>"--Where's he goin' to this time, Aunt Eliza?" he said,
turning to her questioningly, but still holding the boy's arm in
his strong grip "Where's he headin' for now?"</p>

<p>"Why," she said, stroking her pursed serious mouth with a
slightly puzzled movement, "he says he's goin' to Harvard. I
reckon," she said, in the same puzzled tone, "it's all right--I
guess he knows what he's about. Says he's made up his mind to
go--I told him," she said, and shook her head again, "that I'd
send him for a year if he wanted to try it--an' then he'll have
to get out an' shift for himself. We'll see," she said. "I reckon
it's all right."</p>

<p>"Harvard, eh?" said George Pentland. "Boy, you <i>are</i>
flyin' high! . . . What you goin' to do up there?"</p>

<p>The boy, furiously red of face, squirmed, and finally
stammered:</p>

<p>"Why . . . I . . . guess . . . I guess I'll do some
studying!"</p>

<p>"You <i>guess</i> you will!" roared George. "You'd damn well
<i>better</i> do some studying--I bet your mother'll take it out
of your hide if she finds you loafin' on her money."</p>

<p>"Why, yes," the mother said, nodding seriously, "I told him it
was up to him to make the most of this--"</p>

<p>"Harvard, eh!" George Pentland said again, slowly looking his
cousin over from head to foot. "Son, you're flyin' high, you are!
. . . Now don't fly so high you never get back to earth again! .
. . You know the rest of us who didn't go to Harvard still have
to walk around upon the ground down here," he said. "So don't fly
too high or we may not even be able to see you!"</p>

<p>"George! George!" said the young woman in a low tone, holding
one hand to her mouth, and bending over to whisper loudly as she
looked at her young brother. "Do you think anyone could fly very
high with a pair of feet like that?"</p>

<p>George Pentland looked at the boy's big feet for a moment,
shaking his head slowly in much wonderment.</p>

<p>"Hell, no!" he said at length. "He'd never get off the ground!
. . . But if you cut 'em off," he said, "he'd go right up like a
balloon, wouldn't he? Haw! Haw! Haw! Haw!" The great guffaw burst
from him, and grinning with his solid teeth, he dug blindly at
his thigh.</p>

<p>"Hi, hi, hi, hi, hi," the sister jeered, seeing the boy's
flushed and angry face and prodding him derisively in the
ribs--"This is our Harvard boy! k, k, k, k!"</p>

<p>"Don't let 'em kid you, son," said George now in an amiable
and friendly manner. "Good luck to you! Give 'em hell when you
get up there! . . . You're the only one of us who ever had guts
enough to go through college, and we're proud of you! . . . Tell
Uncle Bascom and Aunt Louise and all the rest of 'em hello for me
when you get to Boston. . . . And remember me to your father and
Luke when you get to Baltimore. . . . Good-bye, Gene--I've got to
leave you now. Good luck, son," and with a friendly grip of his
powerful hand he turned to go. "You folks come over sometime--all
of you," he said in parting. "We'd like to see you." And he went
away.</p>

<p>At this moment, all up and down the platform, people had
turned to listen to the deep excited voice of a young man who was
saying in a staccato tone of astounded discovery:</p>

<p>"You <i>don't</i> mean it! . . . You <i>swear</i> she did! . .
. And <i>you</i> were there and saw it with your <i>own</i> eyes!
. . . Well, if that don't beat all I ever heard of! . . . I'll be
<i>damned!"</i> after which ejaculation, with an astounded
falsetto laugh, he looked about him in an abstracted and unseeing
manner, thrust one hand quickly and nervously into his trousers
pocket in such a way that his fine brown coat came back, and the
large diamond-shaped pin of the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity
was revealed, and at the same time passing one thin nervous hand
repeatedly over the lank brown hair that covered his small and
well-shaped head, and still muttering in tones of stupefied
disbelief--"Lord! Lord! . . . What do you know about that?"
suddenly espied the woman and her two children at the other end
of the platform, and without a moment's pause, turned on his
heel, and walked towards them, at the same time muttering to his
astonished friends:</p>

<p>"Wait a minute! . . . Some one over here I've got to speak to!
. . . Back in a minute!"</p>

<p>He approached the mother and her children rapidly, at his
stiff, prim and somewhat lunging stride, his thin face fixed
eagerly upon them, bearing towards them with a driving intensity
of purpose as if the whole interest and energy of his life were
focussed on them, as if some matter of the most vital consequence
depended on his reaching them as soon as possible. Arrived, he
immediately began to address the other youth without a word of
greeting or explanation, bursting out with the sudden fragmentary
explosiveness that was part of him:</p>

<p>"Are you taking this train, too? . . . Are you going today? .
. . Well, what did you decide to do?" he demanded mysteriously in
an accusing and challenging fashion. "Have you made up your mind
yet? . . . Pett Barnes says you've decided on Harvard. Is that
it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it is."</p>

<p>"Lord, Lord!" said the youth, laughing his falsetto laugh
again. "I don't see how you can! . . . You'd better come on with
me. . . . What ever got into your head to do a thing like that?"
he said in a challenging tone. "Why do you want to go to a place
like that?"</p>

<p>"Hah? What say?" The mother who had been looking from one to
the other of the two boys with the quick and startled
attentiveness of an animal, now broke in:</p>

<p>"You know each other. . . . Hah? . . . You're taking this
train, too, you say?" she said sharply.</p>

<p>"Ah-hah-hah!" the young man laughed abruptly, nervously;
grinned, made a quick stiff little bow, and said with nervous
engaging respectfulness: "Yes, Ma'am! . . . Ah-hah-hah! . . . How
d'ye do? . . . How d'ye do, Mrs. Gant?" He shook hands with her
quickly, still laughing his broken and nervous "ah-hah-hah"--"How
d'ye do?" he said, grinning nervously at the younger woman and at
Barton. "Ah-hah-hah. How d'ye do?"</p>

<p>The older woman still holding his hand in her rough worn clasp
looked up at him a moment calmly, her lips puckered in tranquil
meditation:</p>

<p>"Now," she said quietly, in the tone of a person who refuses
to admit failure, "I know you. I know your face. Just give me a
moment and I'll call you by your name."</p>

<p>The young man grinned quickly, nervously, and then said
respectfully in his staccato speech:</p>

<p>"Yes, Ma'am. . . . Ah-hah-hah. . . . Robert Weaver."</p>

<p><i>"Ah-h,</i> that's <i>so</i>!<i>"</i> she cried, and shook
his hands with sudden warmth. "You're Robert Weaver's boy, of
course."</p>

<p>"Ah-hah-hah!" said Robert, with his quick nervous laugh. "Yes,
Ma'am. . . . That's right. . . . Ah-hah-hah. . . . Gene and I
went to school together. We were in the same class at the
University."</p>

<p>"Why, of course!" she cried in a tone of complete
enlightenment, and then went on in a rather vexed manner, "I'll
<i>vow</i>! I knew you all along! I knew that I'd seen you just
as soon as I saw your face! Your name just slipped my mind a
moment--and then, of course, it all flashed over me. . . . You're
Robert Weaver's boy! . . . And you <i>are,"</i> she still held
his hand in her strong, motherly and friendly clasp, and looking
at him with a little sly smile hovering about the corners of her
mouth, she was silent a moment, regarding him quizzically--"now,
boy," she said quietly, "you may think I've got a pretty poor
memory for names and faces--but I want to tell you something that
may surprise you. . . . I know more about you than you think I
do. Now," she said, "I'm going to tell you something and you can
tell me if I'm right."</p>

<p>"Ah-hah-hah!" said Robert respectfully. "Yes, Ma'am."</p>

<p>"You were born," she went on slowly and deliberately, "on
September 2nd, 1898, and you are just two years and one month and
one day older than this boy here--" she nodded to her own son.
"Now you can tell me if I'm right or wrong."</p>

<p>"Ah-hah-hah!" said Robert. "Yes, Ma'am. . . . That's right. .
. . You're absolutely right," he cried, and then in an astounded
and admiring tone, he said: "Well, I'll declare. . . . If that
don't beat all! . . . How on earth did you ever remember it!" he
cried in an astonished tone that obviously was very gratifying to
her vanity.</p>

<p>"Well, now, I'll tell you," she said with a little complacent
smile--"I'll tell you how I <i>know. . . .</i> I remember the day
you were born, boy--because it was on that very day that one of
my own children--my son, Luke--was allowed to get up out of bed
after havin' typhoid fever. . . . That very day, sir, when Mr.
Gant came home to dinner, he said--'Well, I was just talking to
Robert Weaver on the street and everything's all right. His wife
gave birth to a baby boy this morning and he says she's out of
danger.' And I know I said to him, 'Well, then, it's been a lucky
day for both of us. McGuire was here this morning and he said
Luke is now well enough to be up and about. He's out of
danger.'--And I reckon," she went on quietly, "that's why the
date made such an impression on me--of course, Luke had been
awfully sick," she said gravely, and shook her head, "we thought
he was goin' to die more than once--so when the doctor came and
told me he was out of danger--well, it was a day of rejoicin' for
me, sure enough. But that's how I know--September 2nd,
1898--that's when it was, all right, the very day when you were
born."</p>

<p>"Ah-hah-hah!" said Robert. "That is certainly right. . . .
Well, if that don't beat all!" he cried with his astounded and
engaging air of surprise. "The most remarkable thing I ever heard
of!" he said solemnly.</p>

<p>"So the next time you see your father," the woman said, with
the tranquil satisfaction of omniscience, "you tell him that you
met Eliza Pentland--he'll know who <i>I</i> am, boy--I can assure
you--for we were born and brought up within five miles from each
other and you can tell him that she knew you right away, and even
told you to the hour and minute the day when you were born! . . .
You tell him that," she said.</p>

<p>"Yes, Ma'am!" said Robert respectfully, "I certainly will! . .
. I'll tell him! . . . That is certainly a remarkable thing. . .
. Ah-hah-hah! . . . Beats all I ever heard of! . . . Ah-hah-hah,"
he kept bowing and smiling to the young woman and her husband,
and muttering "ah-hah-hah! . . . Pleased to have met you. . . .
Got to go now: some one over here I've got to see . . . but I'll
certainly tell him . . . ah-hah-hah. . . . Gene, I'll see you on
the train. . . . Good-bye. . . . Good-bye. . . . Glad to have met
you all. . . . Ah-hah-hah. . . . Certainly a remarkable thing. .
. . Good-bye!" and turning abruptly, he left them, walking
rapidly along at his stiff, prim, curiously lunging stride.</p>

<p>The younger woman looked after the boy's tall form as he
departed, stroking her chin in a reflective and abstracted
manner:</p>

<p>"So that's Judge Robert Weaver's son, is it? . . . Well," she
went on, nodding her head vigorously in a movement of
affirmation. "He's all right. . . . He's got good manners. . . .
He looks and acts like a gentleman. . . . You can see he's had a
good bringing up. . . . I like him!" she declared positively
again.</p>

<p>"Why, yes," said the mother, who had been following the tall
retreating form with a reflective look, her hands loose-folded at
her waist--"Why, yes," she continued, nodding her head in a
thoughtful and conceding manner that was a little comical in its
implications--"He's a good-looking all-right sort of a boy. . . .
And he certainly seems to be intelligent enough." She was silent
for a moment, pursing her lips thoughtfully and then concluded
with a little nod--"Well, now, the boy may be all right. . . .
I'm not saying that he isn't. . . . He may turn out all right,
after all."</p>

<p>"All right?" her daughter said, frowning a little and showing
a little annoyance, but with a faint lewd grin around the corners
of her mouth--"what do you mean by all right, Mama? Why, of
course he's all right. . . . What makes you think he's not?"</p>

<p>The other woman was silent for another moment: when she spoke
again, her manner was tinged with portent, and she turned and
looked at her daughter a moment in a sudden, straight and deadly
fashion before she spoke:</p>

<p>"Now, child," she said, "I'm going to tell you: perhaps
everything will turn out all right for that boy--I hope it
does--but--"</p>

<p>"Oh, my God!" the younger woman laughed hoarsely but with a
shade of anger, and turning, prodded her brother stiffly in the
ribs. "Now we'll get it!" she sniggered, prodding him,
"k-k-k-k-k! What do you call it?" she said with a lewd frowning
grin that was indescribably comic in its evocations of coarse
humour--"the low down?--the dirt?--Did you ever know it to
fail?--The moment that you meet any one, and up comes the family
corpse."</p>

<p>"--Well, now, child, I'm not saying anything against the
boy--perhaps it won't touch him--maybe he'll be the one to
escape--to turn out all right--but--"</p>

<p>"Oh, my God!" the younger woman groaned, rolling her eyes
around in a comical and imploring fashion. "Here it comes."</p>

<p>"You are too young to know about it yourself," the other went
on gravely--"you belong to another generation--you don't know
about it--but I <i>do."</i> She paused again, shook her pursed
lips with a convulsive pucker of distaste, and then, looking at
her daughter again in her straight and deadly fashion, said
slowly, with a powerful movement of the hand:</p>

<p>"There's been insanity in that boy's family for generations
back!"</p>

<p>"Oh, my God! I knew it!" the other groaned.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir!" the mother said implacably--"and two of his
aunts--Robert Weaver's own sisters died raving maniacs--and
Robert Weaver's mother herself was insane for the last twenty
years of her life up to the hour of her death--and I've heard
tell that it went back--"</p>

<p>"Well, deliver me," the younger woman checked her, frowning,
speaking almost sullenly. "I don't want to hear any more about
it. . . . It's a mighty funny thing that they all seem to get
along now--better than we do . . . so let's let bygones be
bygones . . . don't dig up the past."</p>

<p>Turning to her brother with a little frowning smile, she said
wearily: "Did you ever know it to fail? . . . They know it all,
don't they?" she said mysteriously. "The minute you meet any one
you like, they spill the dirt. . . . Well, I don't care," she
muttered. "You stick to people like that. . . . He looks like a
nice boy and--" with an impressed look over towards Robert's
friends, she concluded, "he goes with a nice crowd. . . . You
stick to that kind of people. I'm all for him."</p>

<p>Now the mother was talking again: the boy could see her
powerful and delicate mouth convolving with astonishing rapidity
in a series of pursed thoughtful lips, tremulous smiles,
bantering and quizzical jocosities, old sorrow and memory, quiet
gravity, the swift easy fluency of tears that the coming of a
train always induced in her, thoughtful seriousness, and sudden
hopeful speculation.</p>

<p>"Well, boy," she was now saying gravely, "you are going--as
the sayin' goes--" here she shook her head slightly, strongly,
rapidly with powerful puckered lips, and instantly her weak worn
eyes of brown were wet with tears--"as the sayin' goes--to a
strange land--a stranger among strange people.--It may be a long,
long time," she whispered in an old husky tone, her eyes tear-wet
as she shook her head mysteriously with a brave pathetic smile
that suddenly filled the boy with rending pity, anguish of the
soul, and a choking sense of exasperation and of woman's
unfairness--"I hope we are all here when you come back again. . .
. I hope you find us all alive. . . ." She smiled bravely,
mysteriously, tearfully. "You never know," she whispered, "you
never know."</p>

<p>"Mama," he could hear his voice sound hoarsely and remotely in
his throat, choked with anguish and exasperation at her easy
fluency of sorrow, "--Mama--in Christ's name! Why do you have to
act like this every time someone goes away! . . . I beg of you,
for God's sake, not to do it!"</p>

<p>"Oh, stop it! Stop it!" his sister said in a rough, peremptory
and yet kindly tone to the mother, her eyes grave and troubled,
but with a faint rough smile about the edges of her generous
mouth. "He's not going away for ever! Why, good heavens, you act
as if someone is dead! Boston's not so far away you'll never see
him again! The trains are running every day, you know. . . .
Besides," she said abruptly and with an assurance that infuriated
the boy, "he's not going today, anyway. Why, you haven't any
intention of going today, you know you haven't," she said to him.
"He's been fooling you all along," she now said, turning to the
mother with an air of maddening assurance. "He has no idea of
taking that train. He's going to wait over until tomorrow. I've
known it all along."</p>

<p>The boy went stamping away from them up the platform, and then
came stamping back at them while the other people on the platform
grinned and stared.</p>

<p>"Helen, in God's name!" he croaked frantically. "Why do you
start that when I'm all packed up and waiting here at the
God-damned station for the train? You <i>know</i> I'm going away
today!" he yelled, with a sudden sick desperate terror in his
heart as he thought that something might now come in the way of
going. "You <i>know</i> I am! Why did we come here? What in
Christ's name are we waiting for if you don't think I'm
going?"</p>

<p>The young woman laughed her high, husky laugh which was almost
deliberately irritating and derisive--"Hi! Hi! Hi! Hi! Hi!"--and
plodded him in the ribs with her large stiff fingers. Then,
almost wearily, she turned away, plucking at her large chin
absently, and said: "Well, have it your own way! It's your own
funeral! If you're determined to go today, no one can stop you.
But I don't see why you can't just as well wait over till
tomorrow."</p>

<p>"Why, yes!" the mother now said briskly and confidently.
"That's exactly what I'd do if I were you! . . . Now, it's not
going to do a bit of harm to anyone if you're a day or so late in
gettin' there. . . . Now I've never been there myself," she went
on in her tone of tranquil sarcasm, "but I've always heard that
Harvard University was a good big sort of place--and I'll bet
you'll find," the mother now said gravely, with a strong slow nod
of conviction--"I'll bet you'll find that it's right there where
it always was when you get there. I'll bet you find they haven't
moved a foot," she said, "and let me tell you something, boy,"
she now continued, looking at him almost sternly, but with a
ghost of a smile about her powerful and delicate mouth--"now I
haven't had your education and I reckon I don't know as much
about universities as you do--but I've never heard of one yet
that would run a feller away for bein' a day late as long as he's
got money enough to pay his tuition. . . . Now you'll find 'em
waitin' for you when you get there--and <i>you'll get in,"</i>
she said slowly and powerfully. "You don't have to worry about
that--they'll be glad to see you, and they'll take you in a hurry
when they see you've got the price."</p>

<p>"Now, Mama," he said in a quiet frenzied tone, "I beg of you,
for God's sake, please, not to--"</p>

<p>"All right, all right," the mother answered hastily in a
placating tone, "I was only sayin'--"</p>

<p>"If you will kindly, please, for God's sake--"</p>

<p>"K-k-k-k-k-k!" his sister snickered, poking him in the
ribs.</p>

<p>But now the train was coming. Down the powerful shining tracks
a half-mile away, the huge black snout of the locomotive swung
slowly round the magnificent bend and flare of the rails that
went into the railway yards of Altamont two miles away, and with
short explosive thunders of its squat funnel came barging slowly
forward. Across the golden pollenated haze of the warm autumnal
afternoon they watched it with numb lips and an empty hollowness
of fear, delight, and sorrow in their hearts.</p>

<p>And from the sensual terror, the ecstatic tension of that
train's approach, all things before, around, about the boy came
to instant life, to such sensuous and intolerable poignancy of
life as a doomed man might feel who looks upon the world for the
last time from the platform of the scaffold where he is to die.
He could feel, taste, smell, and see everything with an instant
still intensity, the animate fixation of a vision seen instantly,
fixed for ever in the mind of him who sees it, and sense the
clumped dusty autumn masses of the trees that bordered the tracks
upon the left, and smell the thick exciting hot tarred caulking
of the tracks, the dry warmth and good worn wooden smell of the
powerful railway ties, and see the dull rusty red, the gaping
emptiness and joy of a freight car, its rough floor whitened with
soft siltings of thick flour, drawn in upon a spur of rusty track
behind a warehouse of raw concrete blocks, and see with sudden
desolation, the warehouse flung down rawly, newly, there among
the hot, humid, spermy, nameless, thick-leaved field-growth of
the South.</p>

<p>Then the locomotive drew in upon them, loomed enormously above
them, and slowly swept by them with a terrific drive of
eight-locked pistoned wheels, all higher than their heads, a
savage furnace-flare of heat, a hard hose-thick hiss of steam, a
moment's vision of a lean old head, an old gloved hand of cunning
on the throttle, a glint of demon hawk-eyes fixed for ever on the
rails, a huge tangle of gauges, levers, valves, and throttles,
and the goggled blackened face of the fireman, lit by an
intermittent hell of flame, as he bent and swayed with rhythmic
swing of laden shovel at his furnace doors.</p>

<p>The locomotive passed above them, darkening the sunlight from
their faces, engulfing them at once and filling them with terror,
drawing the souls out through their mouths with the God-head of
its instant absoluteness, and leaving them there, emptied,
frightened, fixed for ever, a cluster of huddled figures, a bough
of small white staring faces, upturned, silent, and submissive,
small, lonely, and afraid.</p>

<p>Then as the heavy rust-black coaches rumbled past, and the
wheels ground slowly to a halt, the boy could see his mother's
white stunned face beside him, the naked startled innocence of
her eyes, and feel her rough worn clasp upon his arm, and hear
her startled voice, full of apprehension, terror, and surprise,
as she said sharply:</p>

<p>"Hah? What say? Is this his train? I thought--"</p>

<p>It was his train and it had come to take him to the strange
and secret heart of the great North that he had never known, but
whose austere and lonely image, whose frozen heat and glacial
fire, and dark stern beauty had blazed in his vision since he was
a child. For he had dreamed and hungered for the proud unknown
North with that wild ecstasy, that intolerable and wordless joy
of longing and desire, which only a Southerner can feel. With a
heart of fire, a brain possessed, a spirit haunted by the
strange, secret and unvisited magic of the proud North, he had
always known that some day he should find it--his heart's hope
and his father's country, the lost but unforgotten half of his
own soul,--and take it for his own.</p>

<p>And now that day had come, and these two images--call them
rather lights and weathers of man's soul--of the world-far, lost
and lonely South, and the fierce, the splendid, strange and
secret North were swarming like a madness through his blood. And
just as he had seen a thousand images of the buried and silent
South which he had known all his life, so now he had a vision of
the proud fierce North with all its shining cities, and its tides
of life. He saw the rocky sweetness of its soil and its green
loveliness, and he knew its numb soft prescience, its
entrail-stirring ecstasy of coming snow, its smell of harbours
and its traffic of proud ships.</p>

<p>He could not utter what he wished to say and yet the wild and
powerful music of those two images kept swelling in him and it
seemed that the passion of their song must burst his heart,
explode the tenement of bright blood and agony in which they
surged, and tear the sinews of his life asunder unless he found
some means to utter them.</p>

<p>But no words came. He only knew the image of man's loneliness,
a feeling of sorrow, desolation, and wild mournful secret joy,
longing and desire, as sultry, moveless and mysterious in its
slow lust as the great rivers of the South themselves. And at the
same moment that he felt this wild and mournful sorrow, the slow,
hot, secret pulsings of desire, and breathed the heavy and
mysterious fragrance of the lost South again, he felt, suddenly
and terribly, its wild strange pull, the fatal absoluteness of
its world-lost resignation.</p>

<p>Then, with a sudden feeling of release, a realization of the
incredible escape that now impended for him, he knew that he was
waiting for the train, and that the great life of the North, the
road to freedom, solitude and the enchanted promise of the golden
cities was now before him. Like a dream made real, a magic come
to life, he knew that in another hour he would be speeding
worldward, lifeward, Northward out of the enchanted, time-far
hills, out of the dark heart and mournful mystery of the South
for ever.</p>

<p>And as that overwhelming knowledge came to him, a song of
triumph, joy, and victory so savage and unutterable, that he
could no longer hold it in his heart was torn from his lips in a
bestial cry of fury, pain, and ecstasy. He struck his arms out in
the shining air for loss, for agony, for joy. The whole earth
reeled about him in a kaleidoscopic blur of shining rail, massed
heavy greens, and white empetalled faces of the staring
people.</p>

<p>And suddenly he was standing there among his people on the
platform of the little station. All things and shapes on earth
swam back into their proper shape again, and he could hear his
mother's voice, the broken clatter of the telegraph, and see,
there on the tracks, the blunt black snout, the short hard blasts
of steam from its squat funnel, the imminent presence, the
enormous bigness of the train.</p>

<p> </p>

<h1>II</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>The journey from the mountain town of Altamont to the
tower-masted island of Manhattan is not, as journeys are
conceived in America, a long one. The distance is somewhat more
than 700 miles, the time required to make the journey a little
more than twenty hours. But so relative are the qualities of
space and time, and so complex and multiple their shifting
images, that in the brief passage of this journey one may live a
life, share instantly in 10,000,000 other ones, and see pass
before his eyes the infinite panorama of shifting images that
make a nation's history.</p>

<p>First of all, the physical changes and transitions of the
journey are strange and wonderful enough. In the afternoon one
gets on the train and with a sense of disbelief and wonder sees
the familiar faces, shapes, and structures of his native town
recede out of the last fierce clasp of life and vision. Then, all
through the waning afternoon, the train is toiling down around
the mountain curves and passes. The great shapes of the hills,
embrowned and glowing with the molten hues of autumn, are all
about him: the towering summits, wild and lonely, full of joy and
strangeness and their haunting premonitions of oncoming winter
soar above him, the gulches, gorges, gaps, and wild ravines, fall
sheer and suddenly away with a dizzy terrifying steepness, and
all the time the great train toils slowly down from the mountain
summits with the sinuous turnings of an enormous snake. And from
the very toiling slowness of the train, together with the
terrific stillness and nearness of the marvellous hills, a
relation is established, an emotion evoked, which it is
impossible to define, but which, in all its strange and poignant
mingling of wild sorrow and joy, grief for the world that one is
losing, swelling triumph at the thought of the strange new world
that one will find, is instantly familiar, and has been felt by
every one.</p>

<p>The train toils slowly round the mountain grades, the short
and powerful blasts of its squat funnel sound harsh and metallic
against the sides of rocky cuts. One looks out the window and
sees cut, bank, and gorge slide slowly past, the old rock wet and
gleaming with the water of some buried mountain spring. The train
goes slowly over the perilous and dizzy height of a wooden
trestle; far below, the traveller can see and hear the clean
foaming clamours of rock-bright mountain water; beside the track,
before his little hut, a switchman stands looking at the train
with the slow wondering gaze of the mountaineer. The little shack
in which he lives is stuck to the very edge of the track above
the steep and perilous ravine. His wife, a slattern with a hank
of tight-drawn hair, a snuff-stick in her mouth, and the same
gaunt, slow wondering stare her husband has, stands in the
doorway of the shack, holding a dirty little baby in her
arms.</p>

<p>It is all so strange, so near, so far, so terrible, beautiful,
and instantly familiar, that it seems to the traveller that he
must have known these people for ever, that he must now stretch
forth his hand to them from the windows and the rich and
sumptuous luxury of the Pullman car, that he must speak to them.
And it seems to him that all the strange and bitter miracle of
life--how, why, or in what way, he does not know--is in that
instant greeting and farewell; for once seen, and lost the moment
that he sees it, it is his for ever and he can never forget it.
And then the slow toiling train has passed these lives and faces
and is gone, and there is something in his heart he cannot
say.</p>

<p>At length the train has breached the last great wall of the
soaring ranges, has made its slow and sinuous descent around the
powerful bends and cork-screws of the shining rails (which now he
sees above him seven times) and towards dark, the lowland country
has been reached. The sun goes down behind the train a tremendous
globe of orange and pollen, the soaring ranges melt swiftly into
shapes of smoky and enchanted purple, night comes--great-starred
and velvet-breasted night--and now the train takes up its level
pounding rhythm across the piedmont swell and convolution of the
mighty State.</p>

<p>Towards nine o'clock at night there is a pause to switch cars
and change engines at a junction town. The traveller, with the
same feeling of wild unrest, wonder, nameless excitement and
wordless expectancy, leaves the train, walks back and forth upon
the platform, rushes into the little station luncheon room or out
into the streets to buy cigarettes, a sandwich--really just to
feel this moment's contact with another town. He sees vast flares
and steamings of gigantic locomotives on the rails, the seamed,
blackened, lonely faces of the engineers in the cabs of their
great engines, and a little later he is rushing again across the
rude, mysterious visage of the powerful, dark, and lonely earth
of old Catawba.</p>

<p>Toward midnight there is another pause at a larger town--the
last stop in Catawba--again the feeling of wild unrest and
nameless joy and sorrow. The traveller gets out, walks up and
down the platform, sees the vast slow flare and steaming of the
mighty engine, rushes into the station, and looks into the faces
of all the people passing with the same sense of instant
familiarity, greeting, and farewell,--that lonely, strange, and
poignantly wordless feeling that Americans know so well. Then he
is in the Pullman again, the last outposts of the town have
slipped away from him and the great train which all through the
afternoon has travelled eastward from the mountains half across
the mighty State, is now for the first time pointed northward,
worldward, towards the secret borders of Virginia, towards the
great world cities of his hope, the fable of his childhood
legendry, and the wild and secret hunger of his heart, his spirit
and his life.</p>

<p>Already the little town from which he came in the great hills,
the faces of his kinsmen and his friends, their most familiar
voices, the shapes of things he knew seem far and strange as
dreams, lost at the bottom of the million-visaged sea-depth of
dark time, the strange and bitter miracle of life. He cannot
think that he has ever lived there in the far lost hills, or ever
left them, and all his life seems stranger than the dream of
time, and the great train moves on across the immense and lonely
visage of America, making its great monotone that is the sound of
silence and for ever. And in the train, and in ten thousand
little towns, the sleepers sleep upon the earth.</p>

<p>Then bitter sorrow, loneliness and joy come swelling to his
throat--quenchless hunger rises from the adyts of his life and
conquers him, and with wild wordless fury horsed upon his life,
he comes at length, in dark mid-watches of the night, up to the
borders of the old earth of Virginia.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Who has seen fury riding in the mountains? Who has known fury
striding in the storm? Who has been mad with fury in his youth,
given no rest or peace or certitude by fury, driven on across the
earth by fury, until the great vine of the heart was broke, the
sinews wrenched, the little tenement of bone, blood, marrow,
brain, and feeling in which great fury raged, was twisted, wrung,
depleted, worn out, and exhausted by the fury which it could not
lose or put away? Who has known fury, how it came?</p>

<p>How have we breathed him, drunk him, eaten fury to the core,
until we have him in us now and cannot lose him anywhere we go?
It is a strange and subtle worm that will be for ever feeding at
our heart. It is a madness working in our brain, a hunger growing
from the food it feeds upon, a devil moving in the conduits of
our blood, it is a spirit wild and dark and uncontrollable
forever swelling in our soul, and it is in the saddle now, horsed
upon our lives, rowelling the spurs of its insatiate desire into
our naked and defenceless sides, our owner, master, and the mad
and cruel tyrant who goads us on for ever down the blind and
brutal tunnel of kaleidoscopic days at the end of which is
nothing but the blind mouth of the pit and darkness and no
more.</p>

<p>Then, then, will fury leave us, he will cease from those red
channels of our life he has so often run, another sort of worm
will work at that great vine, whereat he fed. Then, then, indeed,
he must give over, fold his camp, retreat; there is no place for
madness in a dead man's brain, no place for hunger in a dead
man's flesh, and in a dead man's heart there is a place for no
desire.</p>

<p>At what place of velvet-breasted night long, long ago, and in
what leafy darkened street of mountain summer, hearing the
footsteps of approaching lovers in the night, the man's voice,
low, hushed, casual, confiding, suddenly the low rich welling of
a woman's laughter, tender and sensual in the dark, going,
receding, fading, and then the million-noted silence of the night
again? In what ancient light of fading day in a late summer; what
wordless passion then of sorrow, joy, and ecstasy--was he
betrayed to fury when it came?</p>

<p>Or in the black dark of some forgotten winter's morning, child
of the storm and brother to the dark, alone and wild and secret
in the night as he leaned down against the wind's strong wall
towards Niggertown, blocking his folded papers as he went, and
shooting them terrifically in the wind's wild blast against the
shack-walls of the jungle-sleeping blacks, himself alone awake,
wild, secret, free and stormy as the wild wind's blast, giving it
howl for howl and yell for yell, with madness, and a demon's
savage and exultant joy, up-welling in his throat! Oh, was he
then, on such a night, betrayed to fury--was it then, on such a
night, that fury came?</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>He never knew; it may have been a rock, a stone, a leaf, the
moths of golden light as warm and moving in a place of magic
green, it may have been the storm-wind howling in the barren
trees, the ancient fading light of day in some forgotten summer,
the huge unfolding mystery of undulant, oncoming night.</p>

<p>Oh, it might have been all this in the April and moist lilac
darkness of some forgotten morning as he saw the clean line of
the East cleave into morning at the mountain's ridge. It may have
been the first light, bird-song, an end to labour and the sweet
ache and pure fatigue of the lightened shoulder as he came home
at morning hearing the single lonely hoof, the jinking bottles,
and the wheel upon the street again, and smelled the early
morning breakfast smells, the smoking wheat cakes, and the
pungent sausages, the steaks, biscuits, grits, and fried green
apples, and the brains and eggs. It may have been the coil of
pungent smoke upcurling from his father's chimney, the clean
sweet gardens and the peach-bloom, apples, crinkled lettuce wet
with dew, bloom and cherry bloom down-drifting in their magic
snow within his father's orchard, and his father's giant figure
awake now and astir, and moving in his house!</p>

<p>Oh, ever to wake at morning knowing he was there! To feel the
fire-full chimney-throat roar up a-tremble with the blast of his
terrific fires, to hear the first fire crackling in the kitchen
range, to hear the sounds of morning in the house, the smells of
breakfast and the feeling of security never to be changed! Oh, to
hear him prowling like a wakened lion below, the stertorous
hoarse frenzy of his furious breath; to hear the ominous
muttering mounting to faint howls as with infuriated relish he
prepared the roaring invective of the morning's tirade, to hear
him muttering as the coal went rattling out upon the fire, to
hear him growling as savagely the flame shot up the trembling
chimney-throat, to hear him muttering back and forth now like a
raging beast, finally to hear his giant stride racing through the
house prepared now, storming to the charge, and the
well-remembered howl of his awakened fury as springing to the
door-way of the back-room stairs he flung it open, yelling at
them to awake.</p>

<p>Was it in such a way, one time as he awoke, and heard below
his father's lion-ramp of morning that fury came? He never knew,
no more than one could weave the great web of his life back
through the brutal chaos of ten thousand furious days, unwind the
great vexed pattern of his life to silence, peace, and certitude
in the magic land of new beginnings, no return.</p>

<p>He never knew if fury had lain dormant all those years, had
worked secret, silent, like a madness in the blood. But later it
would seem to him that fury had first filled his life, exploded,
conquered, and possessed him, that he first felt it, saw it, knew
the dark illimitable madness of its power, one night years later
on a train across Virginia.</p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h1>III</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>It was a little before midnight when the youth entered the
smoking room of the Pullman where, despite the lateness of the
hour, several men still sat. At just this moment the train had
entered the State of Virginia, although, of course, none of the
men who sat there talking knew this.</p>

<p>It is true that some of them might have known, had their
interest and attention been directed toward this geographic fact,
had they been looking for it. Just at this moment, indeed, as the
train, scarcely slackening its speed, was running through the
last of the Catawba towns, one of the men glanced up suddenly
from the conversation in which he and the others were earnestly
engaged, which was exclusively concerned with the fascinating,
ever-mounting prices of their property and the tempting profits
undoubtedly to be derived from real-estate speculation in their
native town. He had looked up quickly, casually, and absently,
with that staggering indifference of prosperous men who have been
so far, so often, on such splendid trains, that a trip across the
continent at night toward the terrific city is no longer a grand
adventure of their lives, but just a thing of custom, need, and
even weariness, and who, therefore, rarely look out of windows
any more:</p>

<p>"What is this?" he said quickly. "Oh, Maysville, probably.
Yes, I guess this must be Maysville," and had then returned
vigorously from his brief inspection of the continent of night, a
few lights, and a little town, to the enticing topic which had
for several hours absorbed the interests of the group.</p>

<p>Nor was there any good reason why this traveller who had
glanced so swiftly and indifferently from the window of the train
should feel any greater interest than he showed. Certainly the
briefest and most casual inspection would have convinced the
observer that, in Baedeker's celebrated phrase, there was "little
here that need detain the tourist." What the man saw in the few
seconds of his observation was the quiet, dusty and sparsely
lighted street of a little town in the upper South. The street
was shaded by large trees and there were some level lawns, more
trees, and some white frame-houses with spacious porches, gables,
occasionally the wooden magnificence of Georgian columns.</p>

<p>On everything--trees, houses, foliage, yards, and
street--there was a curious loneliness of departure and October,
an attentive almost mournful waiting. And yet this dark and dusty
street of the tall trees left a haunting, curiously pleasant
feeling of strangeness and familiarity. One viewed it with a
queer sudden ache in the heart, a feeling of friendship and
farewell, and this feeling was probably intensified by the swift
and powerful movement of the train which seemed to slide past the
town almost noiselessly, its wheels turning without friction,
sound, or vibrancy on the pressed steel ribbons of the rails,
giving to a traveller, and particularly to a youth who was going
into the secret North for the first time, a feeling of
illimitable and exultant power, evoking for him the huge mystery
of the night and darkness, and the image of ten thousand lonely
little towns like this across the continent.</p>

<p>Then the train slides by the darkened vacant-looking little
station and for a moment one has a glimpse of the town's chief
square and business centre. And as he sees it he is filled again
with the same feeling of loneliness, instant familiarity, and
departure. The square is one of those anomalous, shabby-ornate,
inept, and pitifully pretentious places that one finds in little
towns like these. But once seen, if only for this fraction of a
moment, from the windows of a train, the memory of it will haunt
one for ever after.</p>

<p>And this haunting and lonely memory is due probably to the
combination of two things: the ghastly imitation of swarming life
and metropolitan gaiety in the scene, and the almost total
absence of life itself. The impression one gets, in fact, from
that brief vision is one of frozen cataleptic silence in a world
from which all life has recently been extinguished by some
appalling catastrophe. The lights burn, the electric signs wink
and flash, the place is still horribly intact in all its bleak
prognathous newness, but all the people are dead, gone, vanished.
The place is a tomb of frozen silence, as terrifying in its empty
bleakness as those advertising backdrops one saw formerly in
theatres, where the splendid buildings, stores, and shops of a
great street are painted in the richest and most flattering
colours, and where there is no sign of life whatever.</p>

<p>So was it here, save that here the illusion of the dead world
gained a hideous physical reality by its stark, staring, nakedly
concrete dimensions.</p>

<p>All this the boy had seen, or rather sensed, in the wink of an
eye, a moment's vision of a dusty little street, a fleeting
glimpse of a silent little square, a few hard lights, and then
the darkness of the earth again--these half-splintered glimpses
were all the boy could really see in the eye-wink that it took
the train to pass the town. And yet, all these fragmentary things
belonged so completely to all the life of little towns which he
had known, that it was not as if he had seen only a few
splintered images, but rather as if the whole nocturnal picture
of the town was instantly whole and living in his mind.</p>

<p>Beyond the station, parked in a line against the curb, is a
row of empty motor cars, and he knows instantly that they have
been left there by the patrons of the little moving-picture
theatre which explodes out of the cataleptic silence of the
left-hand side of the square into a blaze of hard white and
flaming posters which seem to cover the entire fa&ccedil;ade.
Even here, no movement of life is visible, but one who has lived
and known towns like these feels for the first time an emotion of
warmth and life as he looks at the gaudy, blazing
bill-beplastered silence of that front.</p>

<p>For suddenly he seems to see the bluish blaze of carbon light
that comes from the small slit-like vent-hole cut into the wall
and can hear again--one of the loneliest and most haunting of all
sounds--the rapid shuttering sound of the projection camera late
at night, a sound lonely, hurried, unforgettable, coming out into
those cataleptic squares of silence in the little towns--as if
the operator is fairly racing through the last performance of the
night like a weary and exhausted creature whose stale,
over-driven life can find no joy in what is giving so much joy to
others, and who is pressing desperately ahead toward the merciful
rewards of food, sleep, and oblivion which are already almost in
his grasp.</p>

<p>And as he remembers this, he also suddenly sees and knows the
people in the theatre, and in that instant greets them, feels his
lonely kinship with them, with the whole family of the earth, and
says farewell. Small, dark, lonely, silent, thirsty, and
insatiate, the people of the little town are gathered there in
that one small cell of radiance, warmth, and joy. There for a
little space they are united by the magic spell the theatre casts
upon them. They are all dark and silent leaning forward like a
single mind and congeries of life, and yet they are all separate
too.</p>

<p>Yes, lonely, silent, for a moment beautiful, he knows the
people of the town are there, lifting the small white petals of
their faces, thirsty and insatiate, to that magic screen: now
they laugh exultantly as their hero triumphs, weep quietly as the
mother dies, the little boys cheer wildly as the rascal gets his
due--they are all there in darkness, under immense immortal skies
of time, small nameless creatures in a lost town on the mighty
continent, and for an instant we have seen them, known them, said
farewell.</p>

<p>Around the four sides of the square at even intervals, the new
standards of the five-bulbed lamps cast down implacably upon
those cataleptic pavements the cataleptic silence of their hard
white light. And this, he knows, is called "the Great White Way,"
of which the town is proud. Somehow the ghastly, lifeless silence
of that little square is imaged nowhere else so cruelly as in the
harsh, white silence of these lights. For they evoke terribly, as
nothing else can do, the ghastly vacancy of light without life.
And poignantly, pitifully, and unutterably their harsh, white
silence evokes the moth-like hunger of the American for hard,
brilliant, blazing incandescence.</p>

<p>It is as if there may be in his soul the horror of the ancient
darkness, the terror of the old immortal silences, which will not
down and must be heard. It is as if he feels again the ancient
fear of--what? Of the wilderness, the wet and lidless eye of
shame and desolation feeding always on unhoused and naked sides.
It is as if he fears the brutal revelation of his loss and
loneliness, the furious, irremediable confusion of his huge
unrest, his desperate and unceasing flight from the immense and
timeless skies that bend above him, the huge, doorless and
unmeasured vacancies of distance, on which he lives, on which, as
helpless as a leaf upon a hurricane, he is driven on for ever,
and on which he cannot pause, which he cannot fence, wall,
conquer, make his own.</p>

<p>Then the train, running always with its smooth, powerful,
almost noiseless movement, has left the station and the square
behind it. The last outposts of the town appear and vanish in
patterns of small, lonely light, and there is nothing but huge
and secret night before us, the lonely, everlasting earth, and
presently Virginia.</p>

<p>And surely, now, there is little more to be seen. Surely, now,
there is almost nothing that by day would be worthy of more than
a glance from those great travellers who have ranged the earth,
and known all its wild and stormy seas, and seen its rarest
glories. And by night, now, there is nothing, nothing by night
but darkness and a space we call Virginia through which the huge
projectile of the train is hurtling onward in the dark.</p>

<p>Field and fold and gulch and hill and hollow, forest and
stream and bridge and bank and cut, the huge earth, the rude
earth, the wild, formless, infinitely various, most familiar,
ever-haunting earth, the grand and casual earth that is so brown,
so harsh, so dusty, so familiar, the strange and homely earth
wrought in our blood, our brain, our heart, the earth that can
never be forgotten or described, is flowing by us, by us, by us
in the night.</p>

<p>What is it that we know so well and cannot speak? What is it
that we want to say and cannot tell? What is it that keeps
swelling in our hearts its grand and solemn music, that is aching
in our throats, that is pulsing like a strange wild grape through
all the conduits of our blood, that maddens us with its exultant
and intolerable joy and that leaves us tongueless, wordless,
maddened by our fury to the end?</p>

<p>We do not know. All that we know is that we lack a tongue that
could reveal, a language that could perfectly express the wild
joy swelling to a music in our heart, the wild pain welling to a
strong ache in our throat, the wild cry mounting to a madness in
our brain, the thing, the word, the joy we know so well, and
cannot speak! All that we know is that the little stations whip
by in the night, the straggling little towns whip by with all
that is casual, rude, familiar, ugly, and unutterable. All that
we know is that the earth is flowing by us in the darkness, and
that this is the way the world goes--with a field and a wood and
a field! And of the huge and secret earth all we know is that we
feel with all our life its texture with our foot upon it.</p>

<p>All that we know is that having everything we yet hold
nothing, that feeling the wild song of this great earth upwelling
in us we have no words to give it utterance. All that we know is
that here the passionate enigma of our lives is so bitterly
expressed, the furious hunger that so haunts and hurts Americans
so desperately felt--that being rich, we all are yet so poor,
that having an incalculable wealth we have no way of spending it,
that feeling an illimitable power we yet have found no way of
using it.</p>

<p>Therefore we hurtle onward in the dark across Virginia, we
hurtle onward in the darkness down a million roads, we hurtle
onward driven by our hunger down the blind and brutal tunnel of
ten thousand furious and kaleidoscopic days, the victims of the
cruel impulse of a million chance and fleeting moments, without a
wall at which to thrust the shoulder of our strength, a roof to
hide us in our nakedness, a place to build in, or a door.</p>

<h1>IV</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>As the boy entered the smoking compartment, the men who were
talking together paused, and looked up at him briefly with the
intent, curious, momentary stare of men interrupted in a
conversation. The boy, a leggy creature racing into unfledged
lengths of shank and arm and shoulder, fumbled nervously in his
coat pocket for a package of cigarettes and then sat down
abruptly on the upholstered leather seat beside one of the
men.</p>

<p>The boy's manner betrayed that mixture of defiance and
diffidence which a young man going out into the world for the
first time feels in the presence of older and more experienced
men. And this was the way he felt. And for this reason in the
sharp and casual stare which the men fixed briefly on him there
may have been unconsciously something affectionate and tender as
each one recalled a moment of his own lost youth.</p>

<p>The boy felt the powerful movement of the train beneath him
and the lonely austerity and mystery of the dark earth outside
that swept past for ever with a fanlike stroke, an immortal and
imperturbable stillness. It seemed to him that these two terrific
negatives of speed and stillness, the hurtling and projectile
movement of the train and the calm silence of the everlasting
earth, were poles of a single unity--a unity coherent with his
destiny, whose source was somehow in himself.</p>

<p>It seemed to him that this incredible and fortunate miracle of
his own life and fate had ordered all these accidental facts into
coherent and related meanings. He felt that everything--the
powerful movement of the train, the infinite mystery and lonely
wildness of the earth, the feeling of luxury, abundance, and
unlimited wealth that was stimulated by the rich furnishings of
the Pullman, and the general air of affluence of these prosperous
men--belonged to him, had come out of his own life, and were
ready to serve him at his own behest and control.</p>

<p>It seemed to him that the glorious moment for which his whole
life had been shaped, and toward which every energy and desire in
his spirit had been turned, was now here.</p>

<p>As that incredible knowledge came to him, a fury, wild,
savage, wordless, pulsed through his blood and filled him with
such a swelling and exultant joy as he has never known before. He
felt the savage tongueless cry of pain and joy swell up and
thicken in his throat, he felt a rending and illimitable power in
him as if he could twist steel between his fingers, and he felt
an almost uncontrollable impulse to yell into the faces of the
men with a demonic glee.</p>

<p>Instead he just sat down quickly with an abrupt, half-defiant
movement, lit his cigarette, and spoke to one of the men quickly
and diffidently, saying:</p>

<p>"Hello, Mr. Flood."</p>

<p>For a moment, the man thus addressed said nothing, but sat
staring at the boy stupidly with an expression of heavy surprise.
He was a well-dressed but bloated-looking man in his fifties
whose gross figure even in repose betrayed a gouty tendency. His
face, which had the satiny rosy texture, veinous and tender, that
alcoholism and a daily massage can give, was brutally coarse and
sensual, but was given a disturbing and decisive character by his
bulging yellow eyeballs and the gross lewd mouth which, because
of several large buck teeth whose discoloured surfaces protruded
under the upper lip, seemed always to be half opened and half
smiling. And it was not a pleasant smile. It was a smile, faint,
unmistakably sensual, and rather sly. It seemed to come from some
huge choking secret glee and there was in it a quality that was
jubilantly obscene.</p>

<p>For a moment more Mr. Flood stared through his bulging eyes at
the boy who had just spoken to him, with an air of comical and
stupid surprise. Then amiably, but with a puzzled undertone, he
said gruffly:</p>

<p>"Hello. Oh, hello, son! How are you?"</p>

<p>And after looking at the boy a moment longer, he turned his
attention to the other men again.</p>

<p>It was at just that season of the year when two events which
are dear to the speculations of the American had absorbed the
public interest. These events were baseball and politics, and at
that moment both were thrillingly imminent. The annual baseball
contests for "the championship of the world" were to begin within
another day or two, and the national campaign for the election of
the American president, which would be held in another month, was
moving daily to its furious apogee of speeches, accusations, dire
predictions, and impassioned promises. Both events gave the
average American a thrill of pleasurable anticipation: his
approach to both was essentially the same. It was the desire of a
man to see a good show, to "take sides" vigorously in an exciting
contest--to be amused, involved as an interested spectator is
involved, but not to be too deeply troubled or concerned by the
result.</p>

<p>It was just natural, therefore, that at the moment when the
boy entered the smoking compartment of the train, the
conversation of the men assembled there should be chiefly
concerned with these twin sports. As he came in, there was a hum
of voices, a sound of argument, and then he could see the hearty
red-faced man--the politician--shaking his head dubiously and
heard him say, with a protesting laugh:</p>

<p>"Ah-h, I don't know about that. From what I hear it's just the
other way. I was talking to a man from Tennessee the other day,
and from what he says, Cox is gaining everywhere. He said that a
month ago he wouldn't have given two cents for his chances, but
now he thinks he's going to carry the State."</p>

<p>"It's going to be close," another conceded. "He may win
yet--but it looks to me as if he's got a hard uphill fight on his
hands. Tennessee always polls a big Republican vote--in some of
those mountain districts they vote two to one Republican--and
this year it looks as if they're all set for a change. . . . What
do you think about it, Emmet?" he said, appealing to the small,
swarthy and important-looking little man, who sat there, swinging
his short little legs and chewing on a fat cigar with an air of
wise reflection.</p>

<p>"Well," that person answered slowly after a thoughtful moment,
taking his cigar in his pudgy fingers and looking at it
studiously--"it may be--it may be--that the country's ready for a
change--now don't misunderstand me," he went on hastily, as if
eager to set their perturbed minds at rest--"I'm not saying that
I want to see Harding elected--that I'm going to cast my vote for
him--as you know, I'm a party man and have voted the Democratic
ticket ever since I came of age--but," again he paused, frowned
importantly at his cigar, and spoke with careful
deliberation--"it may just be that we are due for a change this
year--that the country is ready for it--that we need it. . . .
Now, I supported Wilson twice, in 1912, when he got elected to
his first term of office, and again in 1916--"</p>

<p>"The time he kept us out of war," some one said
ironically.</p>

<p>"And," the little man said deliberately--"if he was running
again--if he was well enough to run--if he wanted a third
term--(although I'm against the third term in principle)," he
amended hastily again--"why, I believe I'd go ahead and vote for
him. That's how much I think of him. But," again he paused, and
meditated his chewed cigar profoundly--"it may be we're due now
for a change. Wilson was a great president--in my opinion, the
greatest man we've had since Lincoln--I don't believe any other
man could have done the job he did as well as he--<i>but,"</i>
the word came out impressively, "the job is done! The war is
over--"</p>

<p>"Yes, thank God!" some one murmured softly but fervently.</p>

<p>"The people want to forget about the war--they want to forget
all their sacrifices and suffering--" said this little man who
had sacrificed and suffered nothing--"they are looking forward to
better times. . . . And in my opinion," he spoke again with his
air of slow deliberation, important carefulness--"in my opinion,
better times are before us. I think that after this election we
are going to witness one of the greatest periods of national
development and expansion that the world has ever known. . . .
Why, we haven't begun yet! We haven't even started!" he cried
suddenly, with a note of passionate conviction in his voice--"Do
you realize that this country is only a little more than a
hundred years old? Why, we haven't even begun to show what we can
do yet! We've spent all that time in getting started--in building
cities--settling the country--building railroads and
factories--developing the means of production--making the tools
with which to work. . . . The resources of this country are
scarcely tapped as yet. And in my opinion we are on the eve of
the greatest period of prosperity and growth the world has ever
known. . . . Look at Altamont, for example," he went on cogently.
"Ten years ago, in 1910, the census gave us a population of
18,000. . . . Now, we have thirty, according to government
figures, and that doesn't begin to take the whole thing in: it
doesn't take in Biltburn, Lunn's Cove, Beaver Hills, Sunset
Parkway--a dozen other places I can mention, all really part of
the town but not included in the census figures. . . . If all the
suburbs were included we'd have a population of at least 40,000
inhabitants--"</p>

<p>"I'd call it nearer fifty," said another patriot.</p>

<p>"And within another ten years we'll go to seventy-five,
perhaps a hundred. . . . Why, that town hasn't begun to grow
yet!" he said, bending his short body forward in his enthusiasm
and tapping his fat knee--"It has been less than eight years
since we established the Citizen's Bank and Trust Company with a
capital of $25,000 and capital stock at $100 a share. . . . Now,"
he paused a moment, and looked around him, his swarthy face
packed with strong conviction--<i>"now,</i> we have a capital of
$2,000,000--deposits totalling more than $18,000,000--and as for
the stock--" for a moment the little man's swarthy face was
touched with a faint complacent smile, he said smugly, "I don't
know exactly how much stock you gentlemen may hold among you, but
if any of you wants to sell what he has, I will pay you $1000 a
share--here and now," he slapped a fat small hand down upon a fat
small knee--"here and now! for every share you own."</p>

<p>And he looked at them steadily for a moment with an air of
challenge.</p>

<p>"Not for mine!" the florid heavy man cried heartily. "No, sir!
I've only got ten shares, Emmet, but you can't buy it from me at
any price! I won't sell!"</p>

<p>And the swarthy little man, pleased by the answer, smiled
complacently about him before he spoke again.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir!" he said. "That's the way it is. And the thing
that's begun to happen at home already is going to happen
everywhere--all over the country. From now on you're going to see
a period of rising prices and high wages--increased production, a
boom in real estate, stocks, investments, business of all
kinds--rising values everywhere such as you never saw before and
never hoped to see."</p>

<p>"And where is it going to stop?"</p>

<p>"Stop!" the swarthy little man spoke almost curtly, and then
barked, "It's not going to stop! Not during <i>our</i> lifetime,
anyway! I tell you, man, we're just beginning! How can there be
any talk of stopping when we haven't <i>started</i> yet? . . .
There's been nothing like it before," he cried with passionate
earnestness--"nothing to match it in the history of the world.
We've had wars, booms, good times, hard times, slumps, periods of
prosperity--but, I tell you, gentlemen!" and here he smote
himself sharply on the knee and his voice rose with the strength
of an unshakable conviction--"this thing is different! We have
reached a stage in our development that no other country in the
world has ever known--that was never dreamed of before--a stage
that is beyond booms, depressions, good times, hard
times--anything--"</p>

<p>"You mean that after this we shall never be affected by those
things?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir!" he cried emphatically. "I mean just that! I mean
that we have learned the causes for each of those conditions. I
mean that we have learned how to check them, how to control them.
I mean that so far as we are concerned they don't <i>exist</i>
any more!" His voice had become almost shrill with the force of
his persuasive argument, and suddenly whipping a sheaf of
envelopes, tied with a rubber band, out of his inner pocket, and
gripping a stub of pencil in his stubby hand, he crossed his
short fat legs with an energetic movement, bent forward poised
above the envelopes, and said quietly but urgently:</p>

<p>"See here, now!--I'd like to show you a few figures! My
business, as you know, is to look after other people's
money--your money, the town's money, everybody's money--I've got
to keep my fingers on the pulse of business at every moment of
the day--my business is to <i>know--</i>to <i>know</i>--and let
me tell you something," he said quietly, looking directly in
their eyes, "I <i>do</i> know,--so pay attention just a moment
while I show these figures to you."</p>

<p>And for some moments he spoke quietly, persuasively, his dark
features packed with an energy of powerful conviction, while he
rapidly jotted figures down upon the backs of the soiled
envelopes, and they bent around him--their medicine-man of magic
numerals--in an attitude of awed and rapt attentiveness. And when
he had finished, there was silence for a moment, save for the
rhythmic clack of wheels, the rocketing sound of the great train.
Then one of the men, stroking his chin thoughtfully, and with an
impressed air, said:</p>

<p>"I see. . . . And you think, then, that in view of these
conditions it would be better for the country if Harding is
elected."</p>

<p>The little man's manner became instantly cautious,
non-committal, "conservative":</p>

<p>"I don't say that," he said, shaking his head in a movement of
denial--"I only say that whoever gets elected we're in for a
period of unparalleled development. . . . Now both of them are
good men--as I say, I shall probably vote for Cox--but you can
rest assured," he spoke deliberately and looked around him in his
compelling way--"you can rest assured that no matter which one
gets elected the country will be in good hands. There's no
question about that."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said the florid-faced politician in his amiable
and hearty way. "I agree with you. . . . I'm a Democrat myself,
both in practice and in principle. I'm going to vote for Cox, but
if Harding gets elected I won't shed any tears over his election.
We'll have to give the Republicans credit for a good deed this
time--they couldn't have made a wiser or a better decision. He
has a long and honourable career in the service of his
country,"--as he spoke his voice unconsciously took on the
sententious ring and lilt of the professional politician--"no
breath of scandal has ever touched his name: in public and in
private life he has remained as he began--a statesman loyal to
the institutions of his country, a husband devoted to his family
life, a plain American of simple tastes who loves his neighbours
as himself, and prefers the quiet life of a little town, the
democracy of the front porch, to the marble arches of the
Capitol--so, whatever the result may be," the orator concluded,
"this nation need fear nothing: it has chosen well and wisely in
both cases, its future is secure."</p>

<p>Mr. Flood, during the course of this impassioned flight, had
remained ponderously unmoved. In the pause that followed, he sat
impassively, his coarse-jowled face and bulging yellowed eyes
fixed on the orator in their customary expression of comic
stupefaction. Now, breathing hoarsely and stertorously, he
coughed chokingly and with an alarming rattling noise into his
handkerchief, peered intently at his wadded handkerchief for a
moment, and then said coarsely:</p>

<p>"Hell! What all of you are saying is that you are goin' to
vote for Cox but that you hope that Harding wins."</p>

<p>"No, now, Jim--" the politician, Mr. Candler, said in a
protesting tone--"I never said--"</p>

<p>"Yes, you did!" Mr. Flood wheezed bluntly. "You meant it,
anyhow, every one of you is sayin' how he always was a Democrat
and what a great man Wilson is, and how he's goin' to vote for
Cox--and every God-damn one of you is praying that the other
feller gets elected. . . . Why? I'll tell you why," he wheezed
coarsely, "--it's because we're sick an' tired of Woodrow, all of
us--we want to put the rollers under him an' see the last of him!
Oh, yes, we are," he went on brutally as some one started to
protest--"we're tired of Woodrow's flowery speeches, an' we're
tired of hearin' about wars an' ideals an' democracy an' how fine
an' noble we all are an' 'Mister won't you please subscribe?'
We're tired of hearin' bunk that doesn't pay an' we want to hear
some bunk that does--an' we're goin' to vote for the crook that
gives it to us. . . . Do you know what we all want--what we're
lookin' for?" he demanded, glowering brutally around at them. "We
want a piece of the breast with lots of gravy--an' the boy that
promises us the most is the one we're for! . . . Cox! Hell! All
of you know Cox has no more chance of getting in than a snowball
has in hell. When they get through with him he won't know whether
he was run over by a five-ton truck or chewed up in a sausage
mill. . . . Nothing has changed, the world's no different, we're
just the same as we always were--and I've watched 'em come an' go
for forty years--Blaine, Cleveland, Taft, McKinley,
Roosevelt--the whole damned lot of 'em--an' what we want from
them is just the same: all we can get for ourselves, a free grab
with no holts barred, and to hell with the other fellow."</p>

<p>"So whom are you going to vote for, Jim?" said Mr. Candler
smiling.</p>

<p>"Who? Me?" said Mr. Flood with a coarse grin. "Why, hell, you
ought to know that without asking. Me--I'm a Democrat, ain't
I?--don't I publish a Democratic newspaper? I'm going to vote for
Cox, of course."</p>

<p>And, in the burst of laughter that followed, some one could be
heard saying jestingly:</p>

<p>"And who's going to win the Series, Jim? Some one told me
you're for Brooklyn!"</p>

<p>"Brooklyn!" Mr. Flood jeered wheezingly. "Brooklyn has just
the same kind of chance Cox has--the chance a snowball has in
hell! Brooklyn! They're in just the same fix the Democrats are
in--they've got nothing on the ball. When Speaker and that
Cleveland gang get through with them, Brooklyn is going to look
just like Cox the day after the election. Brooklyn," he concluded
with brutal conviction, "hasn't got a chance."</p>

<p>And again the debate between the men grew eager, animated and
vociferous: they shouted, laughed, denied, debated, jeered
good-naturedly, and the great train hurtled onward in the
darkness, and the everlasting earth was still.</p>

<p>And other men, and other voices, words, and moments such as
these would come, would pass, would vanish and would be forgotten
in the huge record and abyss of time. And the great trains of
America would hurtle on through darkness over the lonely,
everlasting earth--the earth which only was eternal--and on which
our fathers and our brothers had wandered, their lives so brief,
so lonely, and so strange--into whose substance at length they
all would be compacted. And the great trains would hurtle on for
ever over the silent and eternal earth--fixed in that design of
everlasting stillness and unceasing change. The trains would
hurtle onward bearing other lives like these, all brought
together for an instant between two points of time--and then all
lost, all vanished, broken and forgotten. The trains would bear
them onward to their million destinations--each to the fortune,
fame, or happiness he wished, whatever it was that he was looking
for--but whether any to a sure success, a certain purpose, or the
thing he sought--what man could say? All that he knew was that
these men, these words, this moment would vanish, be
forgotten--and that great wheels would hurtle on for ever. And
the earth be still.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Mr. Flood shifted his gouty weight carefully with a movement
of his fat arm, grunting painfully as he did so. This delicate
operation completed, he stared sharply and intently at the boy
again and at length said bluntly:</p>

<p>"You're one of those Gant boys, ain't you? Ain't you Ben's
brother?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," the boy answered. "That's right."</p>

<p>"Which one are you?" Mr. Flood said with this same brutal
directness. "You ain't the one that stutters, are you?"</p>

<p>"No," one of the other men interrupted with a laugh, but in a
decided tone. "He's not the one. You're thinking of Luke."</p>

<p>"Oh," said Mr. Flood stupidly. "Is Luke the one that
stutters?"</p>

<p>"Yes," the boy said, "that's Luke. I'm Eugene."</p>

<p>"Oh," Mr. Flood said heavily. "I reckon you're the youngest
one."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," the boy answered.</p>

<p>"Well," said Mr. Flood with an air of finality, "I didn't know
which one you were, but I knew you were one of them. I knew I'd
seen you somewhere."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," the boy answered. He was about to go on, hesitated
for a moment, and suddenly blurted out: "I used to carry a route
on <i>The Courier</i> when you owned it. I guess that's how you
remembered me."</p>

<p>"Oh," said Mr. Flood stupidly, "you did? Yes, that's it, all
right. I remember now." And he continued to look at the boy with
his bulging stare of comic stupefaction and for a moment there
was silence save for the pounding of the wheels upon the
rail.</p>

<p>"How many of you boys are there?" The swarthy and
important-looking man who had previously been addressed as Emmet
now spoke curiously: "There must be five or six in all."</p>

<p>"No," the boy said, "there's only three now. There's Luke and
Steve and me."</p>

<p>"Oh, Steve, Steve," the little man said with an air of crisp
finality, as if this was the name that had been at the tip of his
tongue all the time. "Steve was the oldest, wasn't he?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said the boy.</p>

<p>"Whatever became of Steve, anyway?" the man said. "I don't
believe I've seen him in ten or fifteen years. He doesn't live at
home any more, does he?"</p>

<p>"No, sir," the boy said. "He lives in Indiana."</p>

<p>"Does he for a fact?" said the little man, as if this was a
rare and curious bit of information. "What's Steve doing out
there? Is he in business?"</p>

<p>For a moment the boy was going to say, "No, he runs a pool
room and lives up over it with his wife and children," but
feeling ashamed to say this, he said:</p>

<p>"I think he runs some kind of cigar store out there."</p>

<p>"Is that so?" the man answered with an air of great interest.
"Well," he went on in a moment in a conciliatory tone, "Steve was
always smart enough. He had brains enough to do almost anything
if he tried."</p>

<p>Emmet Wade, the man who had asked the boy all these questions,
was a quick, pompous little figure, corpulently built, but so
short in stature as to be almost dwarfish-looking. His skin was
curiously and unpleasantly swarthy, and save for a fringe of thin
black hair at either side, his head was completely bald. In that
squat figure, the suggestion of pompous authority and mountainous
conceit was so pronounced that even in repose, as now, the whole
man seemed to strut. He was, by virtue of that fortuitous chance
and opportunity which has put so many small men in great
positions, the president of the leading bank of the community.
Even as he sat there in the smoking compartment, with his short
fat legs crossed, the boy could see him sitting at his desk in
the bank, swinging back and forth in his swivel chair
thoughtfully, his pudgy hands folded behind his head as he
dictated a letter to his obsequious secretary.</p>

<p>"Where's old Luke? What's he doing, anyway?" another of the
men demanded suddenly, beginning to chuckle even as he spoke. The
speaker was the florid-faced, somewhat countrified-looking man
already noted, who wore the string neck-tie and spoke with the
rhetorical severity of the small-town politician. He was one of
the town commissioners and in his hearty voice and easy manner
there was a more genial quality than any of the others had. "I
haven't seen that boy in years," he continued. "Some one was
asking me just the other day what had become of him."</p>

<p>"He's got a job selling farm machinery and lighting
equipment," the boy answered.</p>

<p>"Is that so?" the man replied with this same air of friendly
interest. "Where is he located? He doesn't get home very often,
does he?"</p>

<p>"No, sir," the boy said, "not very often. He comes in every
two or three weeks, but he doesn't stay home long at a time. His
territory is down through South Carolina and Georgia--all through
there."</p>

<p>"What did you say he was selling?" said Mr. Flood, who had
been staring at the boy fixedly during all this conversation with
his heavy expression of a slow, intent and brutal
stupefaction.</p>

<p>"He sells lighting systems and pumps and farm equipment and
machinery--for farms," the boy said awkwardly.</p>

<p>"That's Luke--who does that?" said Mr. Flood after a moment,
when this information had had time to penetrate.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. That's Luke."</p>

<p>"And he's the one that stutters?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"The one that used to have the agency for <i>The Saturday
Evening Post</i> and did all that talking when he sold 'em to
you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. That's Luke."</p>

<p>"And what d'you say he's doing now?" said Mr. Flood heavily.
"Selling farm machinery?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. That's what he's doing."</p>

<p>"Then, by God," said Mr. Flood, with a sudden and explosive
emphasis which, after his former attitude of heavy, brutal
stupefaction, was startling, "he'll do it!" The other men laughed
and Mr. Flood shook his ponderous, crimson head slowly from side
to side to emphasize his conviction in the matter.</p>

<p>"If any one can sell 'em, he'll do it," he said positively.
"That boy could sell Palm Beach suits to the Esquimaux. They'd
have to buy 'em just to keep him from talking them to death."</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what I saw him do one time," said the
politician, shifting his weight a little in order to accommodate
himself more comfortably to the motion of the train. "I was
standing in front of the post office one day talking to Dave
Redmond about some property he owned out on the Haw Creek
Road--oh, it must have been almost fifteen years ago--when here
he comes hustling along, you know, with a big bundle of his
papers under his arm. Well, he sails right into us, talking about
a mile a minute and going so fast neither of us had a chance to
get a word in edgeways. 'Here you are, gentlemen,' he says, 'hot
off the press, just the thing you've been waiting for, this
week's edition of <i>The Saturday Evening Post,</i> five cents,
only a nickel, the twentieth part of a dollar.' By that time,"
said Mr. Candler, "he had the thing all opened up and shoved up
right under Dave Redmond's nose, and he was turning the pages and
telling him all about the different pieces it had in it and who
wrote them and what was in them, and what a bargain it was for
five cents. 'W-w-w-why,' he says, 'if you b-b-b-bought it in a
book, why it'd cost you a d-d-d-dollar and a half and then,' he
says, 'it wouldn't be half as good.' Well, Dave was getting sort
of red in the face by that time," Mr. Candler said, "and I could
see he was sort of annoyed at being interrupted, but the boy kept
right on with his spiel and wouldn't give up. 'I don't want it,'
says Dave, 'I'm busy,' and he tries to turn away from him, but
Luke moves right around to the other side and goes after him
about twice as hard as before. 'Go on, go on,' says Dave. 'We're
busy! I don't want it! I can't read!' he says. 'All right,' says
Luke, 'then you can look at the p-p-p-pictures. Why, the pictures
alone,' he says, 'are w-w-w-worth a half a dollar. It's the
b-b-b-bargain of a lifetime,' he says. Well, the boy was pressing
him pretty hard and I guess Dave lost his temper. He sort of
knocked the magazine away from him and shouted, 'Damn it, I told
you that I didn't want it, and I mean it! Now go on! We're busy.'
Well," said Mr. Candler, "Luke didn't say a word for a moment. He
took his magazine and put it under his arm again, and he just
stood there looking at Dave Redmond for a moment, and then he
said, just as quiet as you please, 'All right, sir. You're the
doctor. But I think you're going to regret it!' And then he
turned and walked away from us. Well, sir," said Mr. Candler,
laughing, "Dave Redmond's face was a study. You could see he felt
pretty small to think he had shouted at the boy like that, and
acted as he did. And Luke hadn't gone twenty feet before Dave
Redmond called him back. 'Here, son,' he says, diving his hand
down into his pocket, 'give me one of those things! I may never
read it but it's worth a dollar just to hear you talk.' And he
gave him a dollar, too, and made him take it," Mr. Candler said,
"and from that day on Dave Redmond was one of the biggest
boosters that Luke had. . . . 'I think you're going to regret
it,'" said Mr. Candler again, laughing at the memory. "That's the
thing that did it--that's what got him--the way the boy just
looked at him and said, 'All right, sir, but I think you're going
to regret it.' That did the trick, all right." And pleased with
his story and the memory it evoked, Mr. Candler looked mildly out
of the window for a moment, smiling.</p>

<p>"That was Luke that done that?" Mr. Flood demanded hoarsely
after a moment, with his air of brutal and rather stunned
surprise. "The one that stutters?"</p>

<p>"Yes, that's the one all right," said Mr. Candler. "That's who
it was."</p>

<p>Mr. Flood pondered this information for a moment with his
bulging eyes still fastened on Mr. Candler in their look of
stupefied curiosity. Then, as the full import of what he had
heard at length soaked into his intelligence, he shook his great
coarse head once, slowly, in a movement of ponderous but emphatic
satisfaction, and said with hoarse conviction:</p>

<p>"Well, he's a good 'un! If any one can sell 'em, he's the
one."</p>

<p>This judgment was followed by a brief but heavy pause, which
was broken in a moment by the voice of the pompous, swarthy
little man who, in a tone of detached curiosity, said:</p>

<p>"Whatever became of that other boy--the one who used to work
there in <i>The Courier</i> office when you owned it? What was
his name, anyway?"</p>

<p>"Ben," said Mr. Flood heavily, but without hesitation. "That
was Ben." Here he coughed in an alarming, phlegmy sort of way,
cleared his throat and spat chokingly into the spittoon at his
feet, wiped his mouth with his wadded handkerchief and in a
moment, panting for breath, wheezed:</p>

<p>"Ben was the one that worked for me."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, yes, yes!" the swarthy little man said rapidly, as
if now it all came back to him. "Ben! That was the one! Whatever
became of him? I haven't seen him recently."</p>

<p>"He's dead," said Mr. Flood, still wheezing rapidly for breath
and gazing at the spittoon. "That's the reason you haven't seen
him," he said seriously. And suddenly, as if the long-awaited
moment had come, he bent over, torn by a fit of choking and
phlegmy sounds of really astounding proportions. When it was
over, he raised himself, settled back slowly and painfully in his
seat, and for a moment, with closed eyes, did nothing but wheeze
rapidly. In a moment, still with closed eyes, he gasped almost
inaudibly:</p>

<p>"Ben was the one that died."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! I do remember now," the pompous little man declared,
nodding his head sharply with an air of conviction. "That's been
some time ago, hasn't it?" he said to the boy.</p>

<p>"He died two years ago," the boy replied, "during the
war."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's so, he did! I remember now!" the man cried
instantly, with an air of recollection that somehow said that he
remembered nothing. "He was overseas at the time, wasn't he?" he
asked smoothly.</p>

<p>"No, sir," the boy answered. "He was at home. He died of
pneumonia--during that big epidemic."</p>

<p>"I know," the man said regretfully. "That got a lot of the
boys. Ben was in service at the time, wasn't he?"</p>

<p>"No," the boy answered. "He never got in. Luke was the one who
was in service. Ben tried to get in twice but he couldn't pass
the examinations."</p>

<p>"Is that so?" the man said vaguely. "Well, I was mighty sorry
to hear about his death. Old Ben was one fine boy!"</p>

<p>Nothing was said for a moment.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you how fine he was," Mr. Flood, who had been
wheezing with closed eyes, now grunted suddenly, glaring solemnly
about him with an air of brutal earnestness. "Now I think I knew
that boy about as well as any man alive--he worked for me for
almost fifteen years--started out when he was ten years old as a
route-boy on <i>The Courier</i> and kept right on working for my
paper until just a year or two before he died! And I'm here to
tell you," he wheezed solemnly, "that they don't come any better
than Ben!" Here he glowered around him pugnaciously as if the
character of a dead saint had been called in question. "Now he
wasn't one of your big talkers who'd promise everything and know
nothing. Ben was a do-er, not a talker. You could depend on him,"
said Mr. Flood, hoarsely and impressively. "When he told you he'd
do a thing, you'd know it was going to get done! As regular as a
clock and as steady as the day is long! And as quiet a fellow as
you ever saw," said Mr. Flood. "That was Ben for you! Am I
right?" he demanded, suddenly turning to the boy. "Was that
Ben?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," the boy answered. "That was Ben."</p>

<p>"And until you asked him something he'd go for days at a time
without speaking to you, but I knew he didn't mean anything by
it, it was just his way. He believed in tending to his own
business and he expected every one else to do the same." And for
a moment, exhausted by these eulogies, he wheezed rapidly.</p>

<p>"Well, the world would be a lot better off if there were more
like him," the pompous, swarthy little man now said virtuously,
as if this sentiment expressed his own pious belief and practice.
"There are too many people sticking their noses in other people's
business, as it is."</p>

<p>"Well, they didn't stick their noses in Ben's business," said
Mr. Flood with grim emphasis, "not after the first time, anyway.
But they didn't come any better than that boy. I couldn't have
thought more of him if he'd been my own son," he concluded
piously and then gasped stertorously, lifted his cigar slowly to
his lips with the thick, gouty tenderness that characterized all
his movements and for a moment puffed slowly, wheezing
reflectively over it.</p>

<p>"Not that he was ever much like a boy," he grunted suddenly,
with a surprising flash of insight. "He was always more like an
old man--didn't ever seem to be a kid like the others. Why,"
suddenly he chuckled with a phlegmy hoarseness, "I remember when
he first began to come down there in the morning as a carrier,
the other kids all called him 'Pop.' That was Ben for you. Always
had that scowl on his face, even when he was laughing--as serious
and earnest as an old man. But he was one of the best--as good as
they come." Again he coughed chokingly, bent over with a painful
grunt, and cleared his throat phlegmily into the polished brass
spittoon beside him. Then, wheezing a little, he drew the wadded
silk handkerchief from a side-pocket, wiped his mouth with it,
raised himself up in his seat a little, and settled back slowly,
tenderly, wheezing, with a sigh! Then for a moment he laboured
painfully, eyes closed, with his rapid wheezing breath and
finally, when it seemed he must be exhausted by his efforts and
done with conversation for the evening, he wheezed faintly and
unexpectedly.</p>

<p>"That was Ben."</p>

<p>"Oh, I remember that boy now," the swarthy pompous-looking man
suddenly broke in with a flash of recollective
inspiration--"Wasn't Ben the boy who used to stand in the windows
of <i>The Courier</i> offices when the World Series was being
played, and post the score up on the score-board as they phoned
it in to him?"</p>

<p>"Yes," wheezed Mr. Flood, nodding heavily. "You got him now,
all right. That was Ben."</p>

<p>"I remember now," the swarthy little man said thoughtfully,
with a far-away look in his eye. "I was thinking about him the
other day when I went by <i>The Courier</i> office. They were
playing the Series then. They had another fellow in the window
and I wondered what had become of him. So that was Ben?"</p>

<p>"Yes," Mr. Flood wheezed hoarsely again. "That was Ben."</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>For a moment as the gouty old rake had spoken of the boy's
dead brother, the boy had felt within him a sense of warmth: a
wakening of dead time, a stir of grateful affection for the gross
old man as if there might have been in this bloated carcass some
trace of understanding for the dead boy of whom he spoke--an
understanding faint and groping as a dog who bays the moon might
have of the sidereal universe, and yet genuine and
recognizable.</p>

<p>And for a moment present time fades out and the boy sits there
staring blindly out at the dark earth that strokes for ever past
the train, and now he has the watch out and feels it in his
hands. . . . And suddenly Ben is standing there before his
vision, smoking, and scowls down through the window of the office
at the boy.</p>

<p>He jerks his head in a peremptory gesture: the boy, obedient
to his brother's command, enters the office and stands there
waiting at the counter. Ben steps down from the platform in the
window, puts the earphones on a table and walks over to the place
where the boy is standing. For a moment, scowling fiercely, he
stands there looking at the boy across the counter. The scowl
deepens, he makes a sudden threatening gesture of his hard white
hand as if to strike the boy, but instead he reaches across the
counter quickly, seizes the boy by the shoulders, pulls him
closer, and with rough but skilful fingers tugs, pulls and jerks
the frayed string of neck-tie which the boy is wearing into a
more orderly and presentable shape.</p>

<p>The boy starts to go.</p>

<p>"Wait!" says Ben, quietly, in a deliberately off-hand kind of
tone. He opens a drawer below the counter, takes out a small
square package, and scowling irritably, and without looking at
the boy, he thrusts it at him. "Here's something for you," he
says, and walks away.</p>

<p>"What is it?" The boy takes the package and examines it with a
queer numb sense of expectancy and growing joy.</p>

<p>"Why don't you open it and see?" Ben says, his back still
turned, and scowling down into a paper on the desk.</p>

<p>"Open it?" the boy says, staring at him stupidly.</p>

<p>"Yes, open it, fool!" Ben snarls. "It's not going to bite
you!"</p>

<p>While the boy fumbles with the cords that tie the package, Ben
prowls over toward the counter with his curious, loping,
pigeon-toed stride, leans on it with his elbows and, scowling,
begins to look up and down the 'want-ad.' columns, while blue,
pungent smoke coils slowly from his nostrils. By this time, the
boy has taken off the outer wrapping of the package, and is
holding a small case, beautifully heavy, of sumptuous blue
velvet, in his hands.</p>

<p>"Well, did you look at it?" Ben says, still scowling up and
down the 'want-ads.' of the paper, without looking at the
boy.</p>

<p>The boy finds the spring and presses it, the top opens, inside
upon its rich cushion of white satin is a gold watch, and a fine
gold chain. It is a miracle of design, almost as thin and
delicate as a wafer. The boy stares at it with bulging eyes and
in a moment stammers:</p>

<p>"It's--it's a watch!"</p>

<p>"Does it look like an alarm clock?" Ben jeers quietly, as he
turns a page and begins to scowl up and down the advertisements
of another column.</p>

<p>"It's--for me?" the boy says thickly, slowly, as he stares at
it.</p>

<p>"No," Ben says, "it's for Napoleon Bonaparte, of course! . . .
You little idiot! Don't you know what day this is? Have I got to
do all the thinking for you? Don't you ever use your head for
anything except a hat-rack? . . . Well," he goes on quietly in a
moment, still looking at his paper, "what do you think of it? . .
. There's a spring in the back that opens up," he goes on
casually, "Why don't you look at it?"</p>

<p>The boy turns the watch over, feels the smooth golden surface
of that shining wafer, finds the spring, and opens it. The back
of the watch springs out, upon the inner surface is engraved, in
delicate small words, this inscription:</p>

<p> </p>

<p align="CENTER">"To Eugene Gant</p>

<p align="CENTER">Presented To Him On His Twelfth Birthday</p>

<p align="CENTER">By His Brother</p>

<p align="CENTER">B. H. Gant</p>

<p align="CENTER">October 3, 1912"</p>

<p> </p>

<p>"Well," Ben says quietly in a moment. "Did you read what it
says?"</p>

<p>"I'd just like to say--" the boy begins in a thick, strange
voice, staring blindly down at the still open watch.</p>

<p>"Oh, for God's sake!" Ben says, lifting his scowling head in
the direction of his unknown demon, and jerking his head
derisively towards the boy. "Listen to this, won't you? . . .
Now, for God's sake, try to take good care of it and don't abuse
it!" he says quickly and irritably. "You've got to look after a
watch the same as anything else. Old man Enderby"--this is the
name of the jeweller from whom he has bought the watch--"told me
that a watch like that was good for fifty years, if you take care
of it. . . . You know," he goes on quietly, insultingly, "you're
not supposed to drive nails with it or use it for a hammer. You
know that, don't you?" he says, and for the first time turns and
looks quietly at the boy. "Do you know what a watch is for?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"What is it for?"</p>

<p>"To keep time with," says the boy.</p>

<p>Ben says nothing for a moment, but looks at him.</p>

<p>"Yes," he says quietly at length, with all the bitter
weariness of a fathomless resignation and despair, the infinite
revulsion, scorn, disgust which life has caused in him. "That's
it. That's what it's for. To keep time with." The weary irony in
his voice had deepened to a note of passionate despair. "And I
hope to God you keep it better than the rest of us! Better than
Mama or the old man--better than me! God help you if you don't! .
. . Now go on home," he says quietly in a moment, "before I kill
you."</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>"To keep time with!"</p>

<p>What is this dream of time, this strange and bitter miracle of
living? Is it the wind that drives the leaves down bare paths
fleeing? Is it the storm-wild flight of furious days, the
storm-swift passing of the million faces, all lost, forgotten,
vanished as a dream? Is it the wind that howls above the earth,
is it the wind that drives all things before its lash, is it the
wind that drives all men like dead ghosts fleeing? Is it the one
red leaf that strains there on the bough and that for ever will
be fleeing? All things are lost and broken in the wind; the dry
leaves scamper down the path before us, in their swift-winged
dance of death the dead souls flee along before us driven with
rusty scuffle before the fury of the demented wind. And October
has come again, has come again.</p>

<p>What is this strange and bitter miracle of life? Is it to
feel, when furious day is done, the evening hush, the sorrow of
lost, fading light, far sounds and broken cries, and footsteps,
voices, music, and all lost--and something murmurous, immense and
mighty in the air?</p>

<p>And we have walked the pavements of a little town and known
the passages of barren night, and heard the wheel, the whistle
and the tolling bell, and lain in the darkness waiting, giving to
silence the huge prayer of our intolerable desire. And we have
heard the sorrowful silence of the river in October--and what is
there to say? October has come again, has come again, and this
world, this life, this time are stranger than a dream.</p>

<p>May it not be that some day from this dream of time, this
chronicle of smoke, this strange and bitter miracle of life in
which we are the moving and phantasmal figures, we shall wake?
Knowing our father's voice upon the porch again, the flowers, the
grape-vines, the low rich moons of waning August, and the tolling
bell--and instantly to know we live, that we have dreamed and
have awakened, and find then in our hands some object, like this
real and palpable, some gift out of the lost land and the unknown
world as token that it was no dream--that we have really been
there? And there is no more to say.</p>

<p>For now October has come back again, the strange and lonely
month comes back again, and you will not return.</p>

<p>Up on the mountain, down in the valley, deep, deep, in the
hill, Ben--cold, cold, cold.</p>

<p>"To keep time with!"</p>

<p>And suddenly the scene, the shapes, the voices of the men
about him swam back into their focus, and he could hear the
rhythmed pounding of the wheels below him, and in his palm the
frail-numbered visage of the watch stared blank and plain at him
its legend. It was one minute after twelve o'clock, Sunday
morning, October the third, 1920, and he was hurtling across
Virginia, and this world, this life, this time were stranger than
a dream.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>The train had halted for a moment at one of the Virginia
towns, and for a moment the people were conscious of the strange
yet casual familiarity of all those sounds which suddenly will
intercept the rhythmic spell of time and memory which a journey
in a train can cast upon its passengers. Suddenly this spell was
broken by the intrusion of peculiar things--of sounds and
voices--the sense of instant recognition, union to a town, a life
which they had never known, but with which they now felt
immediately familiar. A railwayman was coming swiftly down the
station platform beneath the windows of the train, pausing from
time to time to hammer on the car-wheels of each truck. A negro
toiled past below them with a heavy rattling truck in tow, piled
high with baggage.</p>

<p>And elsewhere there were the casual voices of the
railwaymen--conductors, porters, baggage masters, station
men--greeting each other with friendly words, without surprise,
speaking of weather, work, plans for the future, saying farewell
in the same way. Then the bell tolled, the whistle blew, the slow
panting of the engine came back to them, the train was again in
motion; the station, and the station lights, a glimpse of
streets, the thrilling, haunting, white-glazed incandescence of a
cotton mill at night, the hard last lights of town, slid past the
windows of the train. The train was in full speed now, and they
were rushing on across the dark and lonely earth again.</p>

<p>Then one of the men in the compartment, the politician, who
had been looking curiously out of the window at this town and
station scene, turned and spoke with a casual interest to the
boy:</p>

<p>"Your father's in Baltimore now, isn't he, son?" he said.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. He's at Hopkins. Luke's up there with him."</p>

<p>"Well, I thought I read something in the paper a week or two
back about his being there," said the man with the florid
face.</p>

<p>"What's wrong with him?" Mr. Flood demanded coarsely in a
moment, after he had absorbed this information. "Ain't he feeling
good?"</p>

<p>The boy shifted nervously in his seat before he answered. His
father was dying of cancer, but for some reason it did not seem
possible or proper for him to say this to these men. He said:</p>

<p>"He's got some kind of kidney trouble, I think. He goes up
there for radium treatments."</p>

<p>"It's the same thing John Rankin had," the florid-faced man
glibly interposed at this moment. "Some sort of prostate trouble,
isn't it?" he said.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, that's it," the boy said. For some reason he felt a
sense of relief and gratefulness towards the man with the florid
face. The easy, glib and false assurance that his father's
"trouble" was "the same thing John Rankin had" seemed to give the
disease a respectable standing and to divest the cancer of its
fatal, shameful and putrescent horror.</p>

<p>"I know what it is," the florid-faced man was saying, nodding
his head in a confident manner. "It's the same thing John Rankin
had. A lot of men get it after they're fifty. John told me he
went through agony with it for ten years. Said he used to be up
with it a dozen times a night. It got so he couldn't sleep, he
couldn't rest, he couldn't do anything but walk the floor with
it. It got him down so that he was nothing but skin and bones, he
was walking around like a dead man. Then he went up there and had
that operation and he's been a new man ever since. He looks
better than he's looked in twenty years. I was talking to him the
other day and he told me he didn't have an ache or a pain in the
world. He said he was going to live to be a hundred and he looked
it--the picture of health.</p>

<p>"Well," he said in a friendly tone, now turning to the boy,
"remember me to your father when you see him. Tell him Frank
Candler asked to be remembered to him."</p>

<p>"Are you and him good friends?" Mr. Flood demanded heavily,
after another staring pause, with the brutal, patient, and
somehow formidable curiosity which belonged to him. "You know him
well?"</p>

<p>"Who? Mr. Gant?" Mr. Candler cried with the hearty geniality
of the politician, which seemed to suggest he knew the man so
well that the very question was amusing to him. "Why, I've known
him all my life--I've known him ever since he first came to
Altamont--let's see, that's all of forty years ago when he first
came here?" Mr. Candler went on reflectively, "or no, maybe a
little less than that. Wait a minute." He considered seriously
for a moment. "The first time I ever saw your father," said Mr.
Candler very slowly and impressively, with a frown on his face
and not looking at any one, but staring straight before him, "was
in October, 1882--and I believe--I believe," he said strongly,
"that was the very year he came to town--yes, sir! I'm positive
of it!" he cried. "For Altamont was nothing but a cross-roads
village in those days--I don't believe we had 2,000 people
there--why, that's all in the world it was." Mr. Candler now
interrupted himself heartily. "The courthouse up there on the
square and a few stores around it--when you got two blocks away
you were right out in the country. Didn't Captain Bob Porter
offer me three lots he owned down there on Pisgah Avenue, not a
block from the square, for a thousand dollars, and didn't I laugh
at him to think he was fool enough to ask such a price as that
and expect to get it! Why!" Mr. Candler declared, with a full
countrified laugh, "it was nothing but a mud-hole down in the
holler. I've seen old Captain Porter's hawgs wallerin' around in
it many's the time. 'And you,' I said to him, 'you--do you think
I'd pay you a price like that for a mud-hole? Why, you must think
I'm crazy, sure enough.' 'All right,' he says, 'have it your own
way, but you'll live to see the day you'll regret not buying it.
You'll live to see the day when you can't buy <i>one</i> of those
lots for a thousand dollars!' <i>One</i> of them!" Mr. Candler
now cried in hearty self-derision. "Why, if I owned one of those
lots to-day, I'd be a rich man! I don't believe you could buy a
foot of that land to-day for less than a thousand dollars, could
you, Bruce?" he said, addressing himself to the swarthy,
pompous-looking man who sat beside the boy.</p>

<p>"Five thousand a front foot would come closer to it, I should
think," the pompous little man replied, with the crisp, brisk and
almost strutting assurance that characterized all his words and
gestures. He crossed and uncrossed his fat little legs briskly as
he uttered these words and then sat there "all reared back" as
the saying goes, unable even to reach the floor with his fat
little legs, but smiling a complacent smile and simply exuding
conceit and strutting self-satisfaction from every pore. "Yes,
sir!" the swarthy little man continued, pompously, "I should
doubt very much if you could buy a foot of that property for less
than $5,000 today!"</p>

<p>"Well," said Mr. Candler with a satisfied air. "That's what I
thought! I knew it would be way up there somewheres. But I could
have had the whole thing once for a thousand dollars. I've kicked
myself in the seat of the pants a thousand times since to think
what a fool I was for not taking it when I had the chance! I'd be
a rich man to-day if I had! It just goes to show you, doesn't
it?" he concluded indefinitely.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," the pompous, swarthy little man replied, in his
dry, briskly assured tones, "it goes to show that our hindsight
is usually a great deal better than our foresight!" And he
glanced about him complacently, obviously pleased with his wit
and convinced that he had said something remarkably pungent and
original.</p>

<p>"It was about that time when I first met your father," said
Mr. Candler, turning to the boy again. "Along there in the fall
of '82--that's when it was all right--and I don't think he'd been
in town then more than a month, for in a town that size, I'd have
known if he'd been there longer. And yes, of course!" he cried
sharply, struck by sudden recollection, "that very first day I
saw him he was standing there in front of his shop with two
nigger men, unloading some blocks of marble and granite and
tombstones, I reckon, and moving them back into his shop. I guess
he was just moving in at the time. He'd rented an old shack over
there at the north-east corner of the square where the Sluder
building is now. That's where it was, all right. I was working
for old man Weaver at the time--he had a grocery and
general-goods store there opposite the old courthouse about where
the Blue Ridge Coal and Ice Company is now. I was going back to
work after dinner and had just turned the corner at the Square
there from Academy Street when I saw your father. I remember
stopping to watch him for a moment because there was something
about his appearance--I don't know what it was, but if you saw
him once you'd never forget him--there was something about the
way he looked and talked and worked that was different from any
one I'd ever seen. Of course, he was an awful tall, big-boned,
powerful-looking sort of man--how tall is your father, son?"</p>

<p>"He was about six feet five," the boy answered, "but I guess
he's not that much now--he's stooped over some since he got
old."</p>

<p>"Well, he didn't stoop in those days," said Mr. Candler. "He
always carried himself as straight as an arrow. I noticed that.
He was an awful big man--not that he had much weight on him--he
was always lean and <i>skinny</i> like--but he <i>looked</i>
big--he had big bones--his <i>frame</i> was big!" cried Mr.
Candler. "You'll make a big man too when you fill out," he
continued, giving the boy an appraising look. "Of course, you
look like your mother's people, you're a Pentland and they're
fleshy people, but you've got the old man's frame. You may make a
bigger man than he is when you put on weight and widen out--but
it wasn't that your father was so big--I think he looked bigger
than he really was--it was something else about him--about the
way he gave orders to the niggers and went about his work," said
Mr. Candler, in a rather puzzled tone. "I don't know what it was,
but I'd never seen any one like him before. For one thing he was
dressed so good!" he said suddenly. "He always wore his good
clothes when he worked--I'd never seen a man who did hard labour
with his hands who dressed that way. Here he was, you know,
sweating over those big blocks of stone with those two niggers
and wearing better clothes than you and me would go to church in.
Of course, he had his coat off, and his cuffs rolled back, and he
was wearing one of those big striped aprons that go the whole way
up across the shoulders--but you could see his clothes were
<i>good,"</i> said Mr. Candler. "Looked like black broadcloth
that had been made by a tailor and wearing a <i>boiled</i> shirt,
mind you, and one of those wing collars with a black silk
neck-tie--and not afraid to work, either! Why, the first thing I
saw him do," said Mr. Candler, laughing, "he let out a string of
words at those niggers you could have heard from here to yonder
because they were sweating and straining to get a big hunk of
marble up on the rollers, that they hadn't been able to budge an
inch. 'Merciful God,' he says, that's just the way he talked, you
know--'Merciful God! Has it come to this that I must do
everything for myself while you stand there gloating at my agony?
I could as soon look for help from a couple of God-damned wooden
Indians! In the name of God, stand back. I'll do it myself, sick
and feeble as I am!' Well," said Mr. Candler, chuckling with the
recollection, "with that he reaches down and gets a grip on that
big hunk of stone and gives a heave and up she comes on to the
rolling pins as nice and easy as anything you ever saw. Well,
sir, you should have seen the look upon those niggers' faces--I
thought their eyes were going to pop out of their heads. And
that's the first time I ever spoke to him, you know. I can
remember the very words I said. I said to him, 'Well, if you call
that being sick and feeble, most of the folks up in this part of
the country are already dead and in their graves.'"</p>

<p>The man's story had stirred in the boy's mind a thousand
living memories of his father. For a moment it seems to him that
the lost world which these words evoked has never died, lives yet
in all the radiant and enchanted colour of his childhood, in all
its proud, dense, and single fabric of passion, fury, certitude
and joy. Every memory that the story brought to life is part of
him. There are a thousand buried, nameless and forgotten lives,
ten thousand strange and secret tongues alive now, urgent,
swarming in his blood, and thronging at the gateways of his
memory. They are the lives of the lost wilderness, his mother's
people; they are the tongues, the faces of the secret land, the
dark half of his heart's desire, the fertile golden earth from
which his father came.</p>

<p>He knows the farmer boy who stood beside the road and watched
the dusty rebels marching past towards Gettysburg. He smells the
sweet fragrance of that lavish countryside, he hears the oaths,
the jests, the laughter of the marching soldiers, he hears the
cricketing stitch of noon in drowsy fields, the myriad woodnotes,
secret, green, and cool, the thrumming noises. He feels the
brooding wait and murmur of hot afternoon, the trembling of the
distant guns in the hot air, and the vast, oncoming hush and
peace and silence of the dusk.</p>

<p>And then he is lying beside his father in the little gabled
room upstairs. He is there beside his father and his father's
brothers in the darkness--waiting, silent, waiting--with an
unspoken single question in their hearts. They are thinking of an
older brother who that night is lying twelve miles away, shot
through the lungs. He sees his father's gaunt, long form in
darkness, the big-boned hands, the gaunt, long face, the cold,
green-grey, restless and weary eyes, so deep and untelling, so
strangely lonely, and the slanting, almost reptilian large
formation of the skull that has, somehow, its own strange
dignity--as of some one lost. And the great stars of America
blaze over them, the vast and lonely earth broods round them,
then as now, with its secret and mysterious presences, and then
as now the million-noted ululation of the night throngs up from
silence the song of all its savage, dark and measureless
fecundity. And he lies there in the darkness with his father and
the brothers--silent, waiting--their cold, grey eyes turned
upward to the loneliness of night, the blazing stars, having no
words to say the thing they feel, the dream of time and the dark
wonder of man's destiny which has drenched with blood the old
earth, the familiar wheat, and fused that day the image of
immortal history in a sleepy country town twelve miles away.</p>

<p>He sees the gaunt figure of the stone-cutter coming across the
square at his earth-devouring stride. He hears him muttering
underneath his breath the mounting preludes of his huge
invective. He sees him striding on for ever, bent forward in his
haste, wetting his thumb and clearing his throat with an
infuriated and anticipatory relish as he comes. He sees him
striding round the corner, racing up-hill towards the house,
bearing huge packages of meat beneath his arm. He sees him take
the high front steps four at a time, hasten like a hurricane into
the house, lay down the meat upon the kitchen table, and then
without a pause or introduction, comes the storm--fire, frenzy,
curses, woes and lamentations, and then news out of the streets,
the morning's joy, the smoking and abundant dinner.</p>

<p>A thousand memories of that life of constant and unresting
fury brim in the boy's mind in an instant. At this moment, with
telescopic force, all of these memories of his father's life
become fused and blurred to one terrific image, in which it seems
that the whole packed chronicle, from first to last, is perfectly
comprised.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>At the same moment the boy became conscious that the men were
getting up around him, preparatory to departure, and that the
florid-faced man, who had been speaking of his father, had laid
his hand upon his shoulder in a friendly gesture, and was
speaking to him.</p>

<p>"Good night, son," the man was saying. "I'm getting off at
Washington. If I don't see you again, good luck to you. I suppose
you'll be getting off at Baltimore to see your father before you
go on, won't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Yes, sir," the boy stammered confusedly, getting to his
feet.</p>

<p>"Remember me to him, won't you? Tell him you saw Frank Candler
on the train and he sent his best regards."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir--thank you--I will," the boy said.</p>

<p>"All right. And good luck to you, boy," the politician said,
giving him his broad, fleshy and rather tender hand. "Give 'em
hell when you get up there," he said quietly, with a firm,
friendly clasp and a good-natured wink.</p>

<p>"Yes--I certainly will--thank you--" the boy stammered,
flaming in the face, with a feeling of proud hope, and with
affection for the man who had spoken to him.</p>

<p>Then the man had gone, but his words had brought back to the
boy suddenly the knowledge that in the morning he was to see his
father. And that knowledge instantly destroyed all the exultancy
of flight and darkness, the incredible realization of his escape,
the image of new lands, the new life, and the shining city that
had been swelling in his spirit all night long. It had interposed
its leaden face between him and this image of wild joy towards
which he was rushing onward in the darkness, and its grey
oppressive cloud weighed down upon him suddenly a measureless
weight of dull weariness, horror and disgust.</p>

<p>He knew that next day he must meet his brother and his father,
he knew that the dreaded pause and interruption of his flight
would last but two short days, and that in this brief time he
might see and know for the last time all that was living of his
father, and yet the knowledge of this hated meeting filled him
with loathing, a terrible desire to get away from it as quickly
as possible, to forget it, to escape from it for ever.</p>

<p>He knew in his heart that for the wretched, feeble, whining
old man whom he must meet next day, he felt no love whatever. He
knew, indeed, that he felt instead a kind of hate--the wretched
kind of hatred that comes from intolerable pity without love,
from suffering and disgust, from the agony of heart and brain and
nerves, the poisonous and morbid infection of our own lives,
which a man dying of a loathsome disease awakes in us, and from
the self-hate, the self-loathing that it makes us feel because of
our terrible desire to escape him, to desert him, to blot out the
horrible memory we have for him, utterly to forget him.</p>

<p>Now the three men remaining in the compartment were rising to
depart. Old Flood got up with a painful grunt, carefully dropped
the chewed butt of his cigar into the brass spittoon, and walked
tenderly with a gouty and flat-footed shuffle across the little
room to the mirrored door of the latrine. He opened it, entered,
and closed it behind him. The pompous swarthy little man got up,
stretched his short fat arms out stiffly, and said, "Well, I'll
be turning in. I'll see you in the morning, won't I, Jim?"</p>

<p>The man with the thin, tight, palely freckled face, to whom
these words had been addressed, looked up quickly from the
magazine he was reading, and said sharply, in a rather cold,
surprised and distant tone:</p>

<p>"What? . . . Oh! Yes. Good night, Wade."</p>

<p>He got up then, carefully detached the horn-rimmed spectacles
from his long, pointed nose, folded them carefully and put them
in the breast pocket of his coat, and then took up the brief-case
at his side. At this moment, a man, accompanied by Robert Weaver
and by another youth who was about the same age as the boy,
entered the smoking-room.</p>

<p>The man, who was in his middle thirties, was a tall lean
Englishman, already bald, with bitten and incisive features, a
cropped moustache, and the high hard flush of the steady
drinker.</p>

<p>His name was John Hugh William Macpherson Marriott. He was the
youngest son of an ancient family of the English nobility and
just a year or two before he had married the great heiress,
Virginia Willets. To the boy, and to all the other men in the
train, except the man with the cold thin face and pointed nose,
the Englishman was known only by sight and rumour, and his sudden
entrance into the smoking-room had much the same effect as would
the appearance of a figure from some legendary world of which
they had often heard, but which they had never seen.</p>

<p>The reason for this feeling was that the Englishman and his
wife lived on the great estate near town which her father had
built and left to her. All the people in the town had seen this
immense estate, had driven over some of its 90,000 acres, had
seen its farms, its fields, its pastures, and its forests, its
dairies, buildings, and its ranges of wild, smoke-blue mountains.
And finally they had all seen from a distance its great mansion
house, the gables, roof, and spires of a huge stone structure
modelled on one of the great ch&acirc;teaux of France. But few of
them had ever been inside the place or known the wonderful people
who lived there.</p>

<p>All the lives of these fortunate people had become, therefore,
as strange and wonderful to the people of the town as the lives
of legendary heroes. And in a curious way that great estate had
shaped the whole life of the town. To be a part of that life, to
be admitted there, to know the people who belonged to it would
have been the highest success, the greatest triumph that most of
the people in the town could imagine. They could not admit it,
but it was the truth. At the heart of the town's desire was the
life of that great house.</p>

<p>The Englishman had entered the smoking compartment with the
driving movement of a man who has been drinking hard, but is used
to it. The moment that he entered, however, and saw the other
people there he stopped short, with a kind of stunned abruptness.
In a moment, after an astounded silence, he spoke to them,
greeting them with the rough, brief, blurted-out friendliness of
a shy and reticent man:</p>

<p>"Hello! . . . Oh, hello! . . . How do?" He grinned formally
and suddenly began to stare with an astounded expression at the
gouty figure of old Flood who at just this moment had opened the
door of the latrine and was shuffling painfully out into the
compartment. Mr. Flood stopped and returned his look in kind,
with his bulging and bejowled stare of comic stupefaction.</p>

<p>In a moment more the Englishman recovered himself, grimaced
with his shy, quick, toothy grin, and blurted out at Flood, as to
the other men:</p>

<p>"Oh, hello! Hello! How d'ye do?"</p>

<p>"I'm pretty good, thank you!" old Flood said hoarsely and
slowly, after a heavy pause. "How are you?" and continued to
stare heavily and stupidly at him.</p>

<p>But already the Englishman had turned abruptly from him, his
face and lean neck reddening instantly and fiercely with the
angry embarrassment of a shy man. And with the same air of
astonished discovery he now addressed himself to the man with the
long thin nose and palely freckled face, blurting his words out
rapidly and by rushes as before, but somehow conveying to the
others the sense of his intimacy and friendship with this man and
of their own exclusion.</p>

<p>"Oh! . . . There you are, Jim!" he was saying in his astounded
and explosive fashion. "Where the devil have you been all night?
. . . I say!" he went on rapidly without waiting for an answer,
"won't you come in and have a spot with me before you turn
in?"</p>

<p>Every suggestion of the disdain and cold aloofness which had
characterized the other man's manner towards his
fellow-passengers had now vanished at the Englishman's words.
Indeed, in the way he now came forward, smiling, and put his hand
in a friendly manner on the Englishman's arm, there was something
almost scrambling in its effusive eagerness. "Why yes, Hugh," he
said hastily. "I'd be delighted, of course! . . . Just a minute,"
he said in an almost confused tone of voice, "till I get my
brief-case. . . . Where did I leave it? Oh, here it is!" he
cried, picking it up, and making for the door with his companion,
"I'm all ready now! Let's go!"</p>

<p>"Hugh! Hugh!" cried Robert who had accompanied the Englishman
when he entered the compartment, and whom the Englishman now
seemed to have forgotten entirely, "will I see you to-morrow
before you get off?" The words were spoken in a deep, rapid,
eager tone of voice, and in the tone and manner of the youth who
spoke them there was the same suggestion of almost fawning
eagerness that had characterized the older man.</p>

<p>"Eh! What's that?" the Englishman cried in a startled tone,
turning abruptly and staring at the young man who had addressed
him. "Oh! Yes, Robert! I'm stopping at Washington! Look in for a
moment, won't you, if you're up!"</p>

<p>Something in his tone and manner plainly and definitely said
that the young man's company was no longer wanted for the
evening, but the youth immediately nodded his head energetically
and decisively, saying in a satisfied manner:</p>

<p>"Good! Good! I'll do that! I'll be in to say good-bye
to-morrow morning."</p>

<p>"Right!" the Englishman said curtly. "Good night! . . . Good
night! . . . Good night!" he blurted out, turning round and
addressing every one, yet seeing no one, in a series of toothy
grimaces. "Oh--good night!" he said suddenly, before going out,
grinning and shaking hands briefly, in a gesture of permanent
dismissal, with the other young man, who was a blond
insignificant-looking youth, obviously a "hanger-on," with whom
the Englishman evidently cared to have no further acquaintance.
Then, pushing his companion before him through the green curtain,
he went out suddenly with the same desperate shy abruptness, and
in a moment the other men, saying good night all around, had
followed him, and the three young men were left alone in the
compartment. It was now after one o'clock. Outside, the moon was
up, flooding the dark earth of Virginia with a haunting light.
That grand, moon-haunted earth stroked calmly past and, through
the media of its changeless and unceasing change, the recession
and recurrent movement of the enchanted scene, the train made on
for ever its tremendous monotone that was itself the rhythm of
suspended time, the sound of silence and for ever.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>For a moment, after the men had gone, Robert stared down
sternly and quizzically at the boy, with an expression of mock
gravity, and then, in his rapid, eager, deep-toned and rather
engaging voice, said:</p>

<p>"Well, Colonel? . . . What have you to say for yourself? . . .
Was there grass on the back of her back, or was the foul deed
perpetrated in your Hudson Super Six? . . . Come, sir! Explain
yourself! Were you drunk or sober?" And suddenly lifting his
thin, young, yet almost tortured-looking face and his restless
eyes, which were inflamed with drink, and in whose haggard depths
the incipient flashes of the madness which later would destroy
him were already visible, he laughed suddenly, a strange, small,
hoarsely falsetto kind of laugh, jerking his head towards the
boy, and saying in an annoying and indefinite way:</p>

<p>"Crazy! Crazy! Crazy! . . . The craziest man I ever saw!" He
stopped suddenly and, looking down at the boy for a moment with
this same expression of haggard, over-driven restlessness,
demanded impatiently:</p>

<p>"What have you been doing by yourself all night? Just sitting
there all alone and doing nothing? . . . I'll swear, I don't see
how you do it! . . . I'd go crazy sitting in one place like that
without any one to talk to!" he said in an accusing and impatient
tone of voice, as if the other youth had really done some
extraordinary and unreasonable thing. He thrust one hand quickly
and impatiently into the trousers pocket of his well-cut clothes
in such a way that his Delta Kappa Epsilon pin was for a moment
visible. Then he stood there, jingling some coins about in his
pocket and looking at the boy with his inflamed, restless,
furiously desperate eyes. Turning away suddenly, with a movement
of impatience, he shook his head in a gesture of astounded
disbelief, laughed his little hoarse falsetto laugh again, and
said:</p>

<p>"It beats me! . . . Don't see how he does it! . . . Damnedest
man I ever saw! . . . It'd drive me crazy to be alone like
that!"</p>

<p>He turned abruptly again, thrust both hands into his pockets,
and for a moment stood looking at the boy with the old expression
of mock gravity, and with a faintly malicious smile hovering
about the edges of his thin, nervous, strongly modelled
mouth.</p>

<p>"Do you know what they're saying about you at home? . . . Do
you know what those people think of you? . . . Do you know what
all those old women up there are doing now?" he said hoarsely and
accusingly, in his deep, sonorous, and rapid tone.</p>

<p>"Now, Robert!" the boy suddenly shouted, in a choking and
furious tone, getting to his feet. "Don't you start that stuff!
I'm not going to listen to it! You can't fool me! They're not
saying anything!"</p>

<p>Robert lifted his thin, finely drawn face and laughed again,
his little annoying hoarse falsetto laugh, in which a note of
malice and triumph was audible.</p>

<p>"Why, they <i>are!"</i> he said solemnly. "It's the truth! . .
. I think you ought to know about it! . . . I heard it
everywhere, all over town!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Robert, you're a liar!" the boy cried furiously.
<i>"What</i> did you hear all over town? You heard nothing!"</p>

<p>"Why, I <i>did!"</i> said Robert solemnly, as before. "I'll
swear it to you. . . . Do you know what I heard the other day?"
he went on in a blunt, accusing tone. "I heard that one of those
women up there--some old sister in the Baptist Church--said she
grew up with your mother and has known her all her life--well,
she's praying for you!" said Robert solemnly. "I'll swear she
is!"</p>

<p>"Praying for me!" the boy cried in an exasperated tone, but at
the same time, feeling the numb white nauseous sickness of the
heart which the intolerable thought that people are talking in a
disparaging manner about him, his talents, or the success or
failure of his life, can always bring to a young man. "Praying
for me!" he fiercely shouted. "Why the hell should any one pray
for me?"</p>

<p>"I know! I know!" said Robert, nodding his head vigorously,
and speaking with grave agreement. "That's what I told them.
That's just the way I felt about it! . . . But some of those
people down there think you've gone to hell for good. . . . Do
you know what I heard a woman say the other day? She said that
Eugene Gant had gone straight to the devil since he went away to
the State University--"</p>

<p>"Robert, I don't believe you!" the boy shouted. "You're making
all this up!"</p>

<p>"Why, she did! So help me, God! I heard her say it, as sure as
I'm standing here," swore Robert solemnly. "She said you'd gone
down there and taken Vergil Weldon's courses in philosophy and
that you were ruined for life! She said you had turned into a
regular infidel--didn't believe in God or anything any more. . .
. Said she certainly did feel sorry for your mother," said Robert
maliciously.</p>

<p>"Feel sorry for my mother!" the boy fairly howled, dancing
around now like a maniac. "Why the hell should the old bitch feel
sorry for my mother! My mother can take care of herself; she
doesn't need any one to feel sorry for her! . . . All right,
then!" he cried bitterly, with sudden acceptation of the other's
story. "Let 'em pray! If that's the way they feel, let 'em pray
till they wear corns on their God-damned knees! The dirty
hypocrites!" he cried bitterly. "I'll show them! Sneaking around
behind your back to tell their rotten lies about you--and their
talk of praying for your soul! I'm glad I'm out of that damned
town! The two-faced bastards! I wouldn't trust any of them as far
as I could throw an elephant by his tail!"</p>

<p>"I know! I know!" said Robert, wagging his head in solemn
agreement. "I agree with you absolutely. It's awful--that's what
it is."</p>

<p>It was extraordinary that this absurd story, whether true or
not, should have had such a violent effect on the emotions of the
boy. Yet now that he had been told of some unknown woman's
concern for the salvation of his soul, and that certain people of
the praying sort already thought that he was "lost," the words
were fastened in his flesh like rankling and envenomed barbs. And
instantly, the moment that he heard this story and had cursed it,
he thought that it was true. Now, his mind could no longer
remember the time just a moment before when Robert's words had
seemed only an idle and malicious fabrication, probably designed
to goad him, or, even if true, of no great importance.</p>

<p>But now, as if the idle gossip of the other youth had really
pronounced some fatal and inexorable judgment against his whole
life, the boy's spirit was set against "them" blindly, as against
a nameless and hostile antagonist. Plunged suddenly into a dark
weather of fatality and grim resolution, something in him was
saying grimly and desperately:</p>

<p>"All right, then. If that's the way they feel about me, I'll
show them." And seeing the lonely earth outside that went
stroking past the windows of the train, he suddenly felt the dark
and brooding joy of desperation and escape, and thought again:
"Thank God, I've got away at last. Now there's a new land, a new
life, new people like myself who will see and know me as I am and
value me--and, by God, I'll show them! I'll show <i>them,</i> all
right."</p>

<p>And at just this moment of his gloomy thoughts, he muttered
sombrely, aloud, with sullen face:</p>

<p>"All right! To hell with them! I'll show them!"</p>

<p>--And was instantly aware that Robert was looking at him,
laughing his little, malicious, hoarse, falsetto laugh, and that
the other youth, who was a fair-haired, red-cheeked and
pleasant-featured boy named Creasman, obviously somewhat inflamed
by drink and by his social triumphs of the evening, was now, with
an eager excessiveness of good-fellowship, slapping him on the
back and saying boisterously:</p>

<p>"Don't let him kid you, Gene! To hell with them! What do you
care what they say, anyway?"</p>

<p>With these words, he produced from his pocket a flask of the
raw, colourless, savagely instant corn whisky, of which both of
them apparently had been partaking pretty freely, and tendering
it to the boy, said:</p>

<p>"Here, take a drink!"</p>

<p>The boy took the flask, pulled out the cork, and putting the
bottle to his lips, instantly gulped down two or three powerful
swallows of the fiery stuff. For a moment, he stood there blind
and choking, instantly robbed of breath, his throat muscles
swelling, working, swallowing convulsively in an aching struggle
to keep down the revolting and nauseous tasting stuff, and on no
account to show the effort it was costing him.</p>

<p>"Is that the kick of the mule, or not?" said the Creasman boy,
grinning and taking back his flask. "How is it?"</p>

<p>"Good!" the boy said hoarsely, gasping. "Fine! Best I ever
tasted!" And he blinked his eyes rapidly to keep the tears from
coming.</p>

<p>"Well, there's lots more where that came from, boy," said
Creasman. "I've got two pint jars of it in my berth. Let me know
when you want some more." And putting the bottle to his lips with
a smile, he tilted his head, and drank in long easy swallows
which showed he was no novice to the act.</p>

<p>"Damn!" cried Robert, staring at him, in his familiar tone of
astounded disbelief. "Do you mean to tell me you can stand there
drinking that stuff straight! Phew!" he said, shuddering, and
making a face. "That old pukey stuff! Why, it'd rot the guts of a
brass monkey! . . . I don't see how you people do it!" he cried
protestingly, as he took the bottle. In three gulps he had
drained it to the last drop, and even as he was looking around
for a place to throw the empty flask, he shuddered convulsively
again, made a contracted grimace of disgust, and said to the
others accusingly, with his small falsetto laugh of astounded
protest:</p>

<p>"Why, you'll kill yourself drinking that stuff raw! Don't you
know that? You must be crazy! . . . Wait a minute," he muttered
suddenly, comically, dropping the bottle deftly into his pocket,
as the swarthy, pompous little man named Wade entered, attired in
blue pyjamas and a dressing-gown, and holding a tooth-brush and a
tube of tooth-paste in his hand:</p>

<p>"Good evening, sir! . . . Ah-hah! . . . How d'ye do?" said
Robert, bowing slightly and stiffly, and speaking in his grave,
staccato, curiously engaging tone.</p>

<p>"Still up, are you, boys?" the pompous little man remarked,
with his usual telling aptness.</p>

<p>"Ah-hah-hah!" said Robert appreciatively. "Yes, sir! . . .
Just fixin' to go! . . . Come on," he muttered to the others,
jerking his head towards the little man warningly. "Not here! . .
. Well, good night, sir! . . . Goin' now."</p>

<p>"Good night, boys," said the little man, who now had his back
turned to them, and was standing at the silvery basin with his
tooth-brush held in readiness. "See you in the morning."</p>

<p>"Ah-hah-hah!" said Robert. "Yes, sir. That's right.
Goodnight."</p>

<p>And frowning in a meaningful way at his companions, he jerked
his head toward the corridor, and, with an air of great severity,
led them out.</p>

<p>"Didn't want him to see us with that bottle," he muttered when
they were outside in the corridor. "Hell! He's got the biggest
bank in town! Where'd you be if Emmet Wade ever got the idea
you're a liquor-head! . . . Wait a minute!" he said, with the
dissonant abruptness that characterized so much of his speech and
action. "Come outside here--on the platform: nobody to see you
there!"</p>

<p>"I'll meet you out there. I'll go and get another bottle,"
whispered Creasman, and disappeared along the darkened corridor
in the direction of his berth. In a moment he returned, and the
three of them went out upon the platform at the car-end, closed
the door behind them and there, among the rocking and galloping
noises of the pounding wheels, they took another long drink of
the savage liquor. By this time the fiery stuff was leaping,
pulsing, pounding the mounting and exuberant illusions of its
power and strength through every tissue of their blood and
life.</p>

<p>And outside, floating past their vision the huge pageant of
its enchanted and immortal stillness, the old earth of Virginia
now lay dreaming in the moon's white light.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>So here they are now, three atoms on the huge breast of the
indifferent earth, three youths out of a little town walled far
away within the great rim of the silent mountains, already a
distant, lonely dot upon the immense and sleeping visage of the
continent. Here they are--three youths bound for the first time
towards their image of the distant and enchanted city, sure that
even though so many of their comrades had found there only dust
and bitterness, the shining victory will be theirs. Here they are
hurled onward in the great projectile of the train across the
lonely visage of the everlasting earth. Here they are--three
nameless grains of life among the man-swarm ciphers of the earth,
three faces of the million faces, three drops in the unceasing
flood--and each of them a flame, a light, a glory, sure that his
destiny is written in the blazing stars, his life shone over by
the fortunate watches of the moon, his fame nourished and
sustained by the huge earth, whose single darling charge he is,
on whose immortal stillness he is flung onward in the night, his
glorious fate set in the very brain and forehead of the fabulous,
the unceasing city, of whose million-footed life he will
to-morrow be a part.</p>

<p>Therefore they stand upon the rocking platform of the train,
wild and dark and jubilant from the fierce liquor they have
drunk, but more wild and dark and jubilant from the fury swelling
in their hearts, the mad fury pounding in their veins, the
savage, exultant and unutterable fury working like a madness in
the adyts of their soul. And the great wheels smash and pound
beneath their feet, the great wheels pound and smash and give a
rhyme to madness, a tongue to hunger and desire, a certitude to
all the savage, drunken, and exultant fury that keeps mounting,
rising, swelling in them all the time!</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Click, clack, clackety-clack; click, clack, clackety-clack;
click, clack, clackety-clack; clackety-clackety-clack!</p>

<p>Hip, hop, hackety-hack; stip, step, rackety-rack; come and
fetch it, come and fetch it, hickety-hickety-hack!</p>

<p>Rock, reel, smash, and swerve; hit it, hit it, on the curve;
steady, steady, does the trick, keep her steady as a stick; eat
the earth, eat the earth, slam and slug and beat the earth, and
let her whir-r, and let her pur-r, at eighty per-r!</p>

<p>--Whew-w!</p>

<p>--Wow!</p>

<p>--I say 'ja vealer rog? Wow! Pour it to her, son! Give 'er the
gas! We're out to see the world! Run her off the god-damn track,
boy! We don't need no rail, do we?</p>

<p>--Hell no! Which way does this damn train go, anyway, after it
leaves Virginia?</p>

<p>--Maryland.</p>

<p>--Maryland my--! I don't want to go to Maryland! To hell with
Mary's land! Also to hell with Mary's lamb and Mary's calf and
Mary's blue silk underdrawers! Good old Lucy's the girl for
me--the loosier the better! Give me Lucy any day! Good old Lucy
Bowles, God bless her--she's the pick of the crowd, boys! Here's
to Lucy!</p>

<p>--Robert! Art there, boy?</p>

<p>--Aye, aye, sir! Present!</p>

<p>--Hast seen the damsel down in Lower Seven?</p>

<p>--I' sooth, sir, that I have! A comely wench, I trow!</p>

<p>--Peace, fool! Don't think, proud Princocke, thou canst snare
this dove of innocence into the nets of infamous desire with
stale reversions of thy wit! Out, out, vile lendings! An but thou
carried'st at thy shrunken waist that monstrous tun of guts thou
takest for a brain 'twould so beslubber this receiving earth with
lard as was not seen twixt here and Nottingham since butter
shrove! Out, out upon you, scrapings of the pot! A dove, a doe,
it is a faultless swan, I say, a pretty thing!</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Now Virginia lay dreaming in the moonlight. In Louisiana
bayous the broken moonlight shivers the broken moonlight quivers
the light of many rivers lay dreaming in the moonlight beaming in
the moonlight dreaming in the moonlight moonlight moonlight
seeming in the moonlight moonlight moonlight to be gleaming to be
streaming in the moonlight moonlight moonlight moonlight
moonlight moonlight moonlight moonlight</p>

<p>--Mo-hoo-oonlight-oonlight oonlight oonlight oonlight oonlight
oonlight oonlight oonlight oonlight</p>

<p>--To be seeming to be dreaming in the moonlight!</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>WHAM!</p>

<p>SMASH!</p>

<p>--Now! God-dam, let her have it! Wow-w!</p>

<p>With slamming roar, hoarse waugh, and thunderbolted light, the
southbound train is gone in one projectile smash of wind-like
fury, and the open empty silence of its passing fills us, thrills
us, stills us with the vision of Virginia in the moonlight, with
the dream-still magic of Virginia in the moon.</p>

<p>And now, as if with recollected force, the train gains power
from the train it passed, leaps, gathers, springs beneath them,
smashes on with recollected demon's fury in the dark . . .</p>

<p>With slam-bang of devil's racket and God-dam of curse--give us
the bottle, drink, boys, drink!--the power of Virginia lies
compacted in the moon. To you, God-dam of devil's magic and
slam-bang of drive, fire-flame of the terrific furnace, slam of
rod, storm-stroke of pistoned wheel and thunderbolt of speed,
great earth-devourer, city-bringer--hail!</p>

<p>To you, also, old glint of demon hawk-eyes on the rail and the
dark gloved hand of cunning--you, there, old bristle-crops!--Tom
Wilson, H. F. Cline, or T. J. Johnson--whatever the hell your
name is--</p>

<p>CASEY JONES! Open the throttle, boy, and let her rip! Boys,
I'm a belly-busting bastard from the State of old Catawba--a
rootin' tootin' shootin' son-of-a-bitch from Saw Tooth Gap in
Buncombe--why, God help this lovely bastard of a train--it is the
best damned train that ever turned a wheel since Casey Jones's
father was a pup--why, you sweet bastard, run! Eat up
Virginia!--Give her the throttle, you old goggle-eyed
son-of-a-bitch up there!--Pour it to her! Let 'er have it, you
nigger-Baptist bastard of a shovelling fireman--let 'er
rip!--Wow! By God, we'll be in Washington for breakfast!</p>

<p>--Why, God bless this lovely bastard of a train! It is the
best damned train that ever pulled a car since Grant took
Richmond!--Which way does the damn thing
go?--Pennsylvania?--Well, that's all right! Don't you say a word
against Pennsylvania! My father came from Pennsylvania, boys, he
was the best damned man that ever lived--He was a stone-cutter
and he's better than any son-of-a-bitch of a plumber you ever
saw--He's got a cancer and six doctors and they can't kill
him!--But to hell with going where we go!--We're out to see the
world, boy!--To hell with Baltimore, New York, Boston! Run her
off the God-damn rails! We're going West! Run her through the
woods--cross fields--rivers, through the hills! Hell's pecker!
But I'll shove her up the grade and through the gap, no
double-header needed!--Let's see the world now! Through Nebraska,
boy! Let's shove her through, now, you can do it!--Let's run her
through Ohio, Kansas, and the unknown plains! Come on, you
hogger, let's see the great plains and the fields of wheat--Stop
off in Dakota, Minnesota, and the fertile places--Give us a
minute while you breathe to put our foot upon it, to feel it
spring back with the deep elastic feeling, 8,000 miles below,
unrolled and lavish, depthless, different from the East.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Now Virginia lay dreaming in the moonlight! And on Florida's
bright waters the fair and lovely daughters of the Wilsons and
the Potters; the Cabots and the Lowells; the Weisbergs and
O'Hares; the Astors and the Goulds; the Ransoms and the Rands;
the Westalls and the Pattons and the Webbs; the Reynolds and
McRaes; the Spanglers and the Beams; the Gudgers and the Blakes;
the Pedersons and Craigs--all the lovely daughters, the Robinsons
and Waters, the millionaires' sweet daughters, the Boston maids,
the Beacon Slades, the Back Bay Wades, all of the merchant,
lawyer, railroad and well-moneyed grades of Hudson River
daughters in the moon's bright living waters--lay dreaming in the
moonlight, beaming in the moonlight, seeming in the moonlight, to
be dreaming to be gleaming in the moon.</p>

<p>--Give 'em hell, son!</p>

<p>--Here, give him another drink!--Attaboy! Drink her down!</p>

<p>--Drink her down--drink her down--drink her down--damn your
soul--drink her down!</p>

<p>--By God, I'll drink her down and flood the whole end of
Virginia, I'll drown out Maryland, make a flood in
Pennsylvania--I tell you boys I'll float 'em, I'll raise 'em up,
I'll bring 'em down stream, now--I mean the Potters and the
Waters, the rich men's lovely daughters, the city's tender
daughters, the Hudson river daughters--</p>

<p>Lay dreaming in the moonlight, beaming in the moonlight, to be
seeming to be beaming in the moonlight moonlight moonlight
oonlight oonlight oonlight oonlight oonlight.</p>

<p>And Virginia lay dreaming in the moon.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Then the moon blazed down upon the vast desolation of the
American coasts, and on all the glut and hiss of tides, on all
the surge and foaming slide of waters on lone beaches. The moon
blazed down on 18,000 miles of coast, on the million sucks and
scoops and hollows of the shore, and on the great wink of the
sea, that ate the earth minutely and eternally. The moon blazed
down upon the wilderness, it fell on sleeping woods, it dripped
through moving leaves, it swarmed in weaving patterns on the
earth, and it filled the cat's still eye with blazing yellow. The
moon slept over mountains and lay like silence in the desert, and
it carved the shadows of great rocks like time. The moon was
mixed with flowing rivers, and it was buried in the heart of
lakes, and it trembled on the water like bright fish. The moon
steeped all the earth in its living and unearthly substance, it
had a thousand visages, it painted continental space with ghostly
light; and its light was proper to the nature of all the things
it touched: it came in with the sea, it flowed with the rivers,
and it was still and living on clear spaces in the forest where
no men watched.</p>

<p>And in woodland darkness great birds fluttered to their
sleep--in sleeping woodlands strange and secret birds, the teal,
the nightjar, and the flying rail went to their sleep with
flutterings dark as hearts of sleeping men. In fronded beds and
on the leaves of unfamiliar plants where the tarantula, the
adder, and the asp had fed themselves asleep on their own
poisons, and on lush jungle depths where green-golden, bitter red
and glossy blue proud tufted birds cried out with brainless
scream, the moonlight slept.</p>

<p>The moonlight slept above dark herds moving with slow grazings
in the night, it covered lonely little villages; but most of all
it fell upon the unbroken undulation of the wilderness, and it
blazed on windows and moved across the face of sleeping men.</p>

<p>Sleep lay upon the wilderness, it lay across the faces of the
nations, it lay like silence on the hearts of sleeping men; and
low upon lowlands, and high upon hills, flowed gently sleep,
smooth-sliding sleep--sleep--sleep.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>--Robert--</p>

<p>--Go on to bed, Gene, go to bed now, go to bed.</p>

<p>--There's shump'n I mush shay t'you--</p>

<p>--Damn fool! Go to bed!</p>

<p>--Go to bed! I'll go to bed when I'm God-damn good and ready!
I'll not go to bed when there's shump'n I mush shay t'you--</p>

<p>--Go on to bed now, Gene. You've had enough.</p>

<p>--Creasman, you're a good fellow maybe but I don't know you. .
. . You keep out of this. . . . Robert. . . . I'm gonna tell y'
shump'n. . . . You made a remark t'night I didn' like--Prayin'
for me, are they, Robert?</p>

<p>--You damn fool!--You don't know what you're talkin' 'bout! Go

<p>--I'll go to bed, you bastard--I got shump'n to shay
t'you!--Prayin.' for me, are yuh?--Pray for yourself, y' bloody
little Deke!</p>

<p>--Damn fool's crazy! Go on to bed now--</p>

<p>--I'll bed yuh, you son-of-a-bitch! What was it that y' said
that day?--</p>

<p>--What day? You damned fool, you don't know what you're
saying!</p>

<p>--I'll tell yuh what day!--Coming along Chestnut Street that
day after school with you and me and Sunny Jim Curtis and Ed
Petrie and Bob Pegram and Carl Hartshorn and Monk Paul--and the
rest of those boys--</p>

<p>--You damn fool! Chestnut Street! I don't know what you're
talking about!</p>

<p>--Yes, you do!--You and me and Bob and Carl and Irwin and Jim
Homes and some other boys--'Member what y' said, yuh
son-of-a-bitch? Old man English was in his yard there burning up
some leaves and it was October and we were comin' along there
after school and you could smell the leaves and it was after
school and you said, "Here's Mr. Gant, the tombstone-cutter's
son."</p>

<p>--You damn fool! I don't know what you're talking about!--</p>

<p>--Yes, you do, you cheap Deke son-of-a-bitch--Too good to talk
to us on the street when you were sucking around after Bruce
Martin or Steve Patton or Jack Marriott--but a lifelong
brother--oh! couldn't see enough of us, could you, when you were
alone?</p>

<p>--The damn fool's crazy!</p>

<p>--Crazy, am I?--Well, we never had any old gummy grannies tied
down and hidden in the attic--which is more than some people that
I know can say!--you son-of-a-bitch--who do you think you are
with your big airs and big Deke pin!--My people were better
people than your crowd ever hoped to be--we've been here longer
and we're better people--and as for the tombstone-cutter's son,
my father was the best damned stone-cutter that ever lived--he's
dying of cancer and all the doctors in the world can't kill
him--he's a better man than any little ex-police court magistrate
who calls himself a judge will ever be--and that goes for you
too--you--</p>

<p>Why, you crazy fool! I never said anything about your
father--</p>

<p>To hell with you, you damn little bootlicking--</p>

<p>Come on Gene come on you've had enough you're drunk now come
on.</p>

<p>Why God-damn you to hell, I hate your guts you--</p>

<p>All right, all right--He's drunk! He's crazy--Come on, Bill!
Leave him alone!--He don't know what he's doing--</p>

<p>All right. Good night, Gene. . . . Be careful now--See you in
the morning, boy.</p>

<p>All right, Robert, I mean nothing against you--you--</p>

<p>All right!--All right!--Come on, Bill. Let him alone! Good
night, Gene--Come on--let's go to bed!--</p>

<p>To bed to bed to bed to bed to bed! So, so, so, so, so! Make
no noise, make no noise, draw the curtains; so, so, so. We'll go
to supper i' the morning: so, so, so.</p>

<p>And Ile goe to bedde at noone.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Alone, alone now, down the dark, the green, the jungle aisle
between the dark drugged snorings of the sleepers. The pause, the
stir, the sigh, the sudden shift, the train that now rumbles on
through the dark forests of the dream-charged moon-enchanted mind
its monotone of silence and for ever: Out of these prison bands
of clothes, now, rip, tear, toss, and haul while the
green-curtained sleepers move from jungle depths and the
even-pounding silence of eternity--into the stiff white sheets,
the close, hot air, his long body crookedly athwart, lights out,
to see it shining faintly in the coffined under-surface of the
berth above--and sleepless, Virginia floating, dreamlike, in the
still white haunting of the moon--</p>

<p>--At night, great trains will pass us in the timeless spell of
an unsleeping hypnosis, an endless and unfathomable stupefaction.
Then suddenly in the unwaking never-sleeping century of the
night, the sensual limbs of carnal whited nakedness that stir
with drowsy silken warmth in the green secrecies of Lower Seven,
the slow-swelling and lonely and swarm-haunted land--and
suddenly, suddenly, silence and thick hardening lust of dark
exultant joy, the dreamlike passage of Virginia!--Then in the
watches of the night a pause, the sudden silence of up-welling
night, and unseen faces, voices, laughter, and farewells upon a
lonely little night-time station--the lost and lonely voices of
Americans:--"Good-bye! Good-bye, now! Write us when you get
there, Helen! Tell Bob he's got to write!--Give my love to
Emily!--Good-bye, good-bye now--write us, soon!"--And then the
secret, silken and subdued rustling past the thick green curtains
and the sleepers, the low respectful negroid tones of the black
porter--and then the whistle cry, the tolling bell, the great
train mounting to its classic monotone again, and presently the
last lights of a little town, the floating void and loneliness of
moon-haunted earth--Virginia!</p>

<p>Also, in the dream--thickets of eternal night--there will be
huge steamings on the rail, the sudden smash, the wall of light,
the sudden flarings of wild, roaring light upon the moon-haunted
and dream-tortured faces of the sleepers!</p>

<p>--And finally, in that dark jungle of the night, through all
the visions, memories, and enchanted weavings of the timeless and
eternal spell of time, the moment of for ever--there are two
horsemen, riding, riding, riding in the night.</p>

<p>Who are they? Oh, we know them with our life and they will
ride across the land, the moon-haunted passage of our lives for
ever. Their names are Death and Pity, and we know their face: our
brother and our father ride ever beside us in the dream-enchanted
spell and vista of the night; the hooves keep level time beside
the rhythms of the train.</p>

<p>Horsed on the black and moon-maned steeds of fury, cloaked in
the dark of night, the spell of time, dream-pale, eternal, they
are rushing on across the haunted land, the moon-enchanted
wilderness, and their hooves make level thunder with the
train.</p>

<p>Pale Pity and Lean Death their names are, and they will ride
for evermore the moon-plantations of Virginia keeping time time
time to the level thunder of the train pounding time time time as
with four-hooved thunder of phantasmal hooves they pound for ever
level with the train across the moon-plantations of Virginia.</p>

<p>Quadrupedante putrem sonitu quatit ungula campum as with
storm-phantasmal hooves Lean Death and Pale Pity with

<p> </p>

<p>At day-break suddenly, he awoke. The first light of the day,
faint, grey-white, shone through the windows of his berth. The
faint grey light fell on the stiff white linen, feverishly
scuffed and rumpled in the distressful visions of the night, on
the hot pillows and on the long cramped figure of the boy, where
dim reflection already could be seen on the polished surface of
the berth above his head. Outside, that smoke-grey light had
stolen almost imperceptibly through the darkness. The air now
shone grey-blue and faintly luminous with day, and the old brown
earth was just beginning to emerge in that faint light. Slowly,
the old brown earth was coming from the darkness with that
strange and awful stillness which the first light of the day has
always brought.</p>

<p>The earth emerged with all its ancient and eternal quality:
stately and solemn and lonely-looking in that first light, it
filled men's hearts with all its ancient wonder. It seemed to
have been there for ever, and, though they had never seen it
before, to be more familiar to them than their mother's face. And
at the same time it seemed they had discovered it once more, and
if they had been the first men who ever saw the earth, the solemn
joy of this discovery could not have seemed more strange or more
familiar. Seeing it, they felt nothing but silence and wonder in
their hearts, and were naked and alone and stripped down to their
bare selves, as near to truth as men can ever come. They knew
that they would die and that the earth would last for ever. And
with that feeling of joy, wonder, and sorrow in their hearts,
they knew that another day had gone, another day had come, and
they knew how brief and lonely are man's days.</p>

<p>The old earth went floating past them in that first gaunt
light of the morning, and it seemed to be the face of time
itself, and the noise the train made was the noise of silence.
They were fixed there in that classic design of time and silence.
The engine smoke went striding out upon the air, the old
earth--field and wood and hill and stream and wood and field and
hill--went stroking, floating past with a kind of everlasting
repetitiveness, and the train kept making on its steady noise
that was like silence and for ever--until it almost seemed that
they were poised there in that image of eternity for ever--in
moveless movement, unsilent silence, spaceless flight.</p>

<p>All of the noises, rhythms, sounds and variations of the train
seemed to belong to all the visions, images, wild cries and oaths
and songs and haunting memories of the night before, and now the
train itself seemed united to this infinite monotone of silence,
and the boy felt that this land now possessed his life, that he
had known it for ever, and could now think only with a feeling of
unbelief and wonder that yesterday--just yesterday--he had left
his home in the far mountains and now was stroking eastward,
northward towards the sea.</p>

<p>And against the borders of the East, pure, radiant, for the
first time seen in the unbelievable wonder of its new discovery,
bringing to all of us, as it had always done, the first life that
was ever known on this earth, the golden banner of the day
appeared.</p>

<p> </p>

<h1>VI</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>In morning sunlight on a hospital porch, five flights above
the ground, an old dying spectre of a man was sitting, looking
mournfully out across the sun-hazed sweep of the city he had
known in his youth. He sat there, a rusty, creaking hinge, an
almost severed thread of life, a shockingly wasted integument of
skin and bone, of which every fibre and sinew was almost utterly
rotted out, consumed and honeycombed by the great plant of the
cancer which flowered from his entrails and had now spread its
fibrous roots to every tissue of his life. Everything was gone:
everything was wasted from him: the face was drawn tight and bony
as a beak, the skin was clean, tinged with a fatal cancerous
yellow, and almost delicately transparent. The great thin blade
of nose cut down across the face with knife-like sharpness and in
the bony, slanting, almost reptilian cage-formation of the skull,
the smallish cold-grey-green eyes were set wearily, with a
wretched and enfeebled dullness, out across the great space of
the city which swept away and melted at length into the sun-hazed
vistas of October.</p>

<p>Nothing was left but his hands. The rest of the man was dead.
But the great hands of the stone-cutter, on whose sinewy and bony
substance there was so little that disease or death could waste,
looked as powerful and living as ever. Although one of his
hands--the right one--had been stiffened years before by an
attack of rheumatism, they had lost none of their character of
power and massive shapeliness.</p>

<p>In the huge shapely knuckles, in the length and sinewy
thickness of the great fingers--which were twice the size of an
ordinary man's--and in the whole length and sinewy contour of the
hand, there was a quality of sculptural design which was as solid
and proportionate as any of the marble hands of love and grace
which the stone-cutter had so often carved upon the surface of a
graveyard monument.</p>

<p>Thus, as he sat there now, staring dully out across the city,
an emaciated and phantasmal shadow of a man, there was, in the
appearance of these great living hands of power (one of which lay
with an enormous passive grace and dignity across the arm of his
chair and the other extended and clasped down upon the handle of
a walking-stick), something weirdly incongruous, as if the great
strong hands had been unnaturally attached to the puny lifeless
figure of a scarecrow.</p>

<p>Now, wearily, desperately, the old enfeebled mind was trying
to grope with the strange and bitter miracle of life, to get some
meaning out of that black, senseless fusion of pain and joy and
agony, that web that had known all the hope and joy and wonder of
a boy, the fury, passion, drunkenness, and wild desire of youth,
the rich adventure and fulfilment of a man, and that had led him
to this fatal and abominable end.</p>

<p>But that fading, pain-sick mind, that darkened memory could
draw no meaning and no comfort from its tragic meditation.</p>

<p>The old man's land of youth was far away in time, yet now only
the magic lonely hills of his life's journey, his wife's people,
seemed sorrowful, lonely, lost, and strange to him. Now he
remembered all places, things, and people in his land of youth as
if he had known them instantly and for ever!</p>

<p>Oh, what a land, a life, a time was that--that world of youth
and no return. What colours of green-gold, magic, rich
plantations, and shining cities were in it! For now when this
dying man thought about this vanished life that tragic quality of
sorrow and loneliness had vanished instantly. All that he had
read in books about old wars seemed far and lost and in another
time, but when he thought about these things that he had known as
a boy, he saw them instantly, knew them, breathed them, heard
them, felt them, was there beside them, living them with his own
life. He remembered now his wife's people!--tramping in along the
Carlisle Pike on that hot first morning in July, as they marched
in towards Gettysburg. He had been standing there with his next
older brother Gil, beside the dusty road, as they came by.</p>

<p>And he could see them now, not as shadowy, lost, phantasmal
figures of dark time, the way they were in books; he saw them,
heard them, knew them again as they had been in their shapeless
rags of uniforms, their bare feet wound in rags, their lank
disordered hair, sometimes topped by stove-pipe hats which they
had looted out of stores.</p>

<p>"God!" the old man thought, wetting his great thumb briefly,
grinning thinly, as he shook his head, "What a scarecrow crew
that was! In all my days I never saw the like of it! A
bum-looking lot, if ever there was one!--And the bravest of the
brave, the finest troops that ever lived!"--his mind swung upward
to its tide of rhetoric--"Veterans all of them, who had been
through the bloodiest battles of the war, they did not know the
meaning of the word 'fear,' and they would have gone into the
valley of death, the jaws of hell, at a word from their
Commander!" His mind was alive again, in full swing now, the old
voice rose and muttered on the tides of rhetoric, the great hand
gestured, the cold-grey, restless eyes glared feverishly
about--and all of it began to live for him again.</p>

<p>He remembered how he and Gil had been standing there beside
the road, two barefoot farmer boys, aged thirteen and fifteen,
and he remembered how the rebels would halt upon their march, and
shout jesting remarks at the two boys standing at the road. One
shouted out to Gil:</p>

<p>"Hi, there, Yank! You'd better hide! Jeb Stuart's on the way
an' he's been lookin' fer you!"</p>

<p>And Gil, older, bolder, more assured than he, quick-tempered,
stubborn, fiercely partisan, had come back like a flash:</p>

<p>"He'll be lookin' fer <i>you</i> when we get through with
you!" said Gil and the rebels had slapped their ragged thighs and
howled with laughter, shouting at their crestfallen, grinning
comrade:</p>

<p>"'Y, God! I reckon you'll be quiet now! He shore God put it on
ye that time!"</p>

<p>And he was there beside his brother, seeing, hearing, living
it again, as he remembered his strange first meeting with the
Pentland tribe, the haunting miracle of that chance meeting. For
among that ragged crew he had first seen his wife's uncle, the
prophet, Bacchus Pentland, and he had seen him, heard him that
hot morning, and had never been able to forget him, although it
would be twenty years, after many strange turnings of the roads
of destiny and wandering, before he was to see the man again, and
know his name, and join together the two halves of fated
meeting.</p>

<p>Yes, there had been one among the drawling and terrible
mountaineers that day who passed there on that dusty road, and
paused, and talked, and waited in the heat, one whose face he had
never been able to forget--one whose full, ruddy face and
tranquil eyes were lighted always by a smile of idiot and
beatific saintliness, whose powerful fleshy body gave off a
stench that would have put a goat to shame, and who on this
account was called by his jesting comrades, "Stinking Jesus."
Yes, he had been there that morning, Bacchus Pentland, the fated
and chosen of God, the supernatural appearer on roads at
nightfall, the harbinger of death, the prophet, chanting even
then his promises of Armageddon and the Coming of the Lord,
speaking for the first time to the fascinated ears of those two
boys, the full, drawling, unctuous accents of the fated,
time-triumphant Pentlands.</p>

<p>They came, they halted in the dust before the two young
brothers, the lewd tongues mocked and jested, but that man of
God, the prophet Bacchus Pentland, was beautifully unmoved by
their unfaith, and chanted, with a smile of idiot beatitude, his
glorious assurances of an end of death and battle, everlasting
peace:</p>

<p>"Hit's a-comin'!" cried the prophet with the sweet purity of
his saintly smile. "Hit's a-comin'! Accordin' to my figgers the
Great Day is almost here! Oh, hit's a-comin', boys!" he sweetly,
cheerfully intoned, "Christ's kingdom on this airth's at hand!
We're marchin' in to Armageddon now!"</p>

<p>"Hell, Back!" drawled one, with a slow grin of disbelief. "You
said the same thing afore Chancellorsville, an' all I got from it
was a slug of canister in my tail!"--and the others slapped their
ragged thighs and shouted.</p>

<p>"Hit's a-comin'!" Bacchus cried, with a brisk wink, and his
seraphic smile, unmoved, untouched, by their derision. "He'll be
here a-judgin' an' decreein' afore the week is over, settin' up
His Kingdom, an' sortin' us all out the way it was foretold--the
sheep upon His right hand an' the goats upon His left."</p>

<p>"An' which side are you goin' to be on, Back, when all this
sortin' starts?" one drawled with evil innocence. "Are you goin'
to be upon the sheep-side or the goat-side?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Oh," cried Bacchus cheerfully, with his seraphic smile, "I'll
be upon the sheep-side, brother, with the Chosen of the
Lord."</p>

<p>"Then, Back," the other slowly answered, "you'd shore God
better begin to smell a whole lot better than you do right now,
for if the Lord starts sortin' in the dark, Back, He's goin' to
put you where you don't belong--He'll have you over thar among
the goats!"--and the hot brooding air had rung then with their
roars of laughter. Then a word was spoken, an order given, the
ragged files trudged on again, and they were gone.</p>

<p>Now this was lost, a fume of smoke, the moment's image of a
fading memory, and he could not say it, speak it, find a word for
it--but he could see that boy of his lost youth as he sat round
the kitchen table with the rest of them. He could see his
cold-grey, restless, unhappy eyes, the strange, gaunt, almost
reptilian conformation of his staring face, his incredibly thin,
blade-like nose, as he waited there in silence, looking uneasily
at the others with his cold-grey, shallow, most unhappy eyes. And
the old man seemed to be the spy of destiny, to look at once
below the roofs of a million little houses everywhere and on the
star-shone, death-flung mystery of the silent battlefield.</p>

<p>He seemed to be a witness of the secret weavings of dark
chance that threads our million lives into strange purposes that
we do not know. He thought of those dead and wounded men upon the
battlefield whose lives would touch his own so nearly, the
wounded brother that he knew, the wounded stranger he had seen
that day by magic chance, whom he could not forget, and whose
life, whose tribe, in the huge abyss and secret purpose of dark
time would one day interweave into his own.</p>

<p>Oh, he could not find a word, a phrase to utter it, but he
seemed to have the lives not only of those people in him, but the
lives of millions of others whose dark fate is thus determined,
interwove, and beyond their vision or their knowledge, foredone
and made inevitable in the dark destiny of unfathomed time. And
suddenly it seemed to him that all of it was his, even as his
father's blood and earth were his, the lives and deaths and
destinies of all his people. He had been a nameless atom in the
great family of earth, a single, unknown thread in the huge warp
of fate and chance that weaves our lives together and because of
this he had been the richest man that ever lived; the power,
grandeur, glory of this earth and all its lives of men were
his.</p>

<p>And for a moment he forgot that he was old and dying, and
pride, joy, pain, triumphant ecstasy that had no tongue to utter
it rose like a wordless swelling p&aelig;an in his throat because
it seemed to him that this great familiar earth on which his
people lived and wrought was his, that all the mystery, grandeur
and beauty in the lives of men were his, and that he must find a
word, a tongue, a door to utter what was his, or die!</p>

<p>How could he say it! How could he ever find a word to speak
the joy, the pain, the grandeur bursting in the great vine of his
heart, swelling like a huge grape in his throat--mad, sweet,
wild, intolerable with all the mystery, loneliness, wild secret
joy, and death, the ever-returning and renewing fruitfulness of
the earth!</p>

<p>A cloud-shadow passed and left no light but loneliness on the
massed green of the wilderness! A bird was calling in a secret
wood! And there was something going, coming, fading there across
the sun--oh, there was something lonely and most sorrowful, his
mother's voice, the voices of lost men long, long ago, the
flowing of a little river in the month of April--and all, all of
it was his!</p>

<p>A man had passed at sunset on a lonely road and vanished
unknown years ago! A soldier had toiled up a hill at evening and
was gone! A man was lying dead that day upon a bloody field!--and
all, all, all of it was his!</p>

<p>He had stood beside a dusty road, feet bare, his gaunt boy's
face cold-eyed, staring, restless, and afraid. The ragged jesting
rebels passed before him in the dusty heat, the huge drowse and
cricketing stitch of noon was rising from the sweet woods and
nobly swelling, fertile fields of Pennsylvania and all, all, all
of it was his!</p>

<p>A prophet passed before him in the road that day with the
familiar haunting unction of an unmet, unheard tribe; a wounded
prophet lay that night below the stars and chanted glory, peace,
and Armageddon; the boy's brother lay beside the prophet bleeding
from the lungs; the boy's people grimly waited all night long in
a little house not fourteen miles away; and all, all, all of it
was his!</p>

<p>Over the wild and secret earth, the lonely, everlasting, and
unchanging earth, under the huge tent of the all-engulfing night,
amid the fury, chaos, blind confusions of a hundred million
lives, something wild and secret had been weaving through the
generations, a dark terrific weaving of the threads of time and
destiny.</p>

<p>But it had come to this: an old man dying on a porch, staring
through the sun-hazed vistas of October towards the lost country
of his youth.</p>

<p>This was the end of man, then, end of life, of fury, hope, and
passion, glory, all the strange and bitter miracle of chance, of
history, fate, and destiny, which even a stone-cutter's life
could include. This was the end, then:--an old man, feeble, foul,
complaining and disease-consumed who sat looking from the high
porch of a hospital at the city of his youth. This was the
sickening and abominable end of flesh, which infected time and
all man's living memory of morning, youth, and magic with the
death-putrescence of its cancerous taint, and made us doubt that
we had ever lived, or had a father, known joy: this was the end,
and the end was horrible in ugliness. At the end it was not
well.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>On the last morning when his sons came, Gant was there on the
high porch of the hospital, among the other old men who were
sitting there. All of the old men looked very feeble, shrunk, and
wasted, their skins had the clear and frail transparency that men
get in hospitals, and in the bright tremendous light of morning
and October, the old men looked forlorn.</p>

<p>Some looked out wearily and vacantly across the sun-hazed
vistas of the city, with the dull and apathetic expression of men
who are tired of pain and suffering and disease, and who wish to
die. Others, who were in a state of convalescence after
operations, looked out upon the sun-lit city with pleased, feeble
smiles, awkwardly holding cigars in their frail fingers, putting
them in their mouths with the uncertain and unaccustomed manner
which a convalescent has, and looking up slowly, questioningly,
with a feeble and uncertain smile into the faces of their
relatives, wives, or children, as if to ask if it could really be
true that they were going to live instead of die.</p>

<p>Their smiles and looks were pitiful in their sense of childish
trust, of growing hopefulness, of wondering disbelief, but there
was something shameful in them, too. In these feeble smiles of
the old men there was something pleased and impotent, as if they
had been adroitly castrated in the hospital and shorn of their
manhood. And for some reason, one felt suddenly a choking anger
and resentment against some force in life which had betrayed
these old men and made them impotent--something unspeakably
ruthless, cruel, and savage in the world which had made these old
and useless capons. And this anger against this unknown force
suddenly took personal form in a blind resentment against
doctors, nurses, internes, and the whole sinister and suave
perfection of the hospital which under glozing words and cynical
assurances, could painlessly and deftly mutilate a living
man.</p>

<p>The great engine of the hospital, with all its secret,
sinister, and inhuman perfections, together with its clean and
sterile smells which seemed to blot out the smell of rotting
death around one, became a hateful presage of man's destined end.
Suddenly, one got an image of his own death in such a place as
this--of all that death had come to be--and the image of that
death was somehow shameful. It was an image of a death without
man's ancient pains and old gaunt ageing--an image of death
drugged and stupefied out of its ancient terror and stern
dignities--of a shameful death that went out softly, dully in
an&aelig;sthetized oblivion, with the fading smell of chemicals
on man's final breath. And the image of that death was
hateful.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Thus, as Gant sat there, his great figure wasted to the bone,
his skin yellow and transparent, his eyes old and dead, his chin
hanging loose and petulant, as he stared dully and unseeingly out
across the great city of his youth, his life seemed already to
have been consumed and wasted, emptied out into the void of this
cruel and inhuman space. Nothing was left, now, to suggest his
life of fury, strength and passion except his hands. And the
hands were still the great hands of the stone-cutter, powerful,
sinewy, and hairy as they had always been, attached now with a
shocking incongruity to the wasted figure of a scarecrow.</p>

<p>Then, as he sat there staring dully and feebly out upon the
city, his great hairy hands quietly at rest upon the sides of his
chair, the door opened and his two sons came out upon the
porch.</p>

<p>"W-w-w-well, Papa," Luke sang out in his rich stammering
tones. "Wy-wy wy, wy, I fought we'd just c-c-c-come by for a
m-m-m-moment to let Gene say g-g-good-bye to you." In a low tone
to his younger brother he added nervously, "Wy, I fink, I fink
I'd m-m-make it short and snappy if I were you. D-d-don't say
anyf'ing to excite him, wy, wy, wy, I'd just say good-bye."</p>

<p>"Hello, son," said Gant quietly and dully, looking up at him.
For a moment his great hand closed over the boy's, and he said
quietly:</p>

<p>"Where are you going?"</p>

<p>"Wy, wy, wy, he's on his way up Norf . . . wy . . . he's
g-g-going to Harvard, Papa."</p>

<p>"Be a good boy, son," Gant said gently. "Do the best you can.
If you need anything let your mother know," he said wearily and
indifferently, and turned his dead eyes away across the city.</p>

<p>"Wy . . . wy . . . wy he'd like to tell you--"</p>

<p>"Oh, Jesus. . . . I don't want to hear about it," Gant began
to sniffle in a whining tone. . . . "Why must it all be put on me
. . . sick and old as I am? . . . If he wants anything let him
ask his mother for it . . . it's fearful, it's awful, and it's
cruel that you should afflict a sick man in this way." He was
sniffling petulantly and his chin, on which a wiry stubble of
beard was growing, trembled and shook like that of a whining
child.</p>

<p>"I . . . I . . . I fink I'd just say g-g-good-bye now, Gene .
. . m-m-make it, wy make it quick if you can: he's not
f-f-feeling good today."</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Papa," the boy said, and, bending, took his
father's great right hand.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, son," Gant now said quietly as before, looking up
at him. He presented his grizzled moustache, and the boy kissed
him briefly, feeling the wiry bristles of the moustache brush his
cheek as they had always done.</p>

<p>"Take care of yourself, son," said Gant kindly. "Do the best
you can." And for a moment he covered the boy's hand with one
great palm, and gestured briefly across the city: "I was a boy
here," Gant said quietly, "over fifty years ago . . . old Jeff
Streeter's hotel where I lived was there," he pointed briefly
with his great forefinger. ". . . . I was alone in this great
city like the city you are going to--a poor friendless country
boy who had come here to learn his trade as apprentice to a
stone-cutter . . . and I had come from . . . <i>there!"</i> as he
spoke these words, a flash of the old power and life had come
into Gant's voice, and now he was pointing his great finger
strongly towards the sun-hazed vistas of the North and West.</p>

<p>"There!" cried Gant, strongly now, his eye bright and shining
as he followed the direction of his pointing finger. "Do you see,
son? . . . Pennsylvania . . . Gettysburg . . . Brant's Mill . . .
the country that I came from is <i>there</i>! . . . Now I shall
never see it any more," he said. "I'm an old man and I'm dying. .
. . The big farms . . . the orchards . . . the great barns bigger
than houses. . . . You must go back, son, someday to see the
country that your father came from. . . . I was a boy there," the
old man muttered. "Now I'm an old man. . . . I'll come back no
more. . . . No more . . . it's pretty strange when you come to
think of it," he muttered, "by God it is!"</p>

<p>"Wy, wy, P-p-p-papa," Luke said nervously, "I . . . I fink if
he's g-g-going to get his train wy we'd better--"</p>

<p>"Good-bye, son," Gant said quietly again, giving the boy the
pressure of his great right hand. "Be a good boy, now."</p>

<p>But already all the fires of life, so briefly kindled by this
memory of the past, had died away: he was an old sick man again,
and he had turned his dead eyes away from his son and was staring
dully out across the city.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Papa," the boy said, and then paused uncertainly,
not knowing further what to say. From the old man there had come
suddenly the loathsome stench of rotting death, corrupt
mortality, and he turned swiftly away with a feeling of horror in
his heart, remembering the good male smell of childhood and his
father's prime--the smell of the old worn sofa, the chairs, the
sitting-room, the roaring fires, the plug tobacco on the
mantelpiece.</p>

<p>At the screen door he paused again and looked back down the
porch. His father was sitting there as he had left him, among the
other old dying men, his long chin loose, mouth half open, his
dead dull eye fixed vacantly across the sun-hazed city of his
youth, his great hand of power quietly dropped upon his cane.</p>

<p>Down in the city's central web, the boy could distinguish
faintly the line of the rails, and see the engine smoke above the
railroad yards, and as he looked, he heard far off that haunting
sound and prophecy of youth and of his life--the bell, the wheel,
the wailing whistle--and the train.</p>

<p>Then he turned swiftly and went to meet it--and all the new
lands, morning, and the shining city. Upon the porch his father
had not moved or stirred. He knew that he should never see him
again.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The train rushed on across the brown autumnal land, by wink of
water and the rocky coasts, the small white towns and flaming
colours and the lonely, tragic and eternal beauty of New England.
It was the country of his heart's desire, the dark Helen in his
blood forever burning--and now the fast approach across October
land, the engine smoke that streaked back on the sharp grey air
that day!</p>

<p>The coming on of the great earth, the new lands, the enchanted
city, the approach, so smoky, blind and stifled, to the ancient
web, the old grimed thrilling barricades of Boston. The streets
and buildings that slid past that day with such a haunting
strange familiarity, the mighty engine steaming to its halt, and
the great train-shed dense with smoke and acrid with its smell
and full of the slow pantings of a dozen engines, now passive as
great cats, the mighty station with the ceaseless throngings of
its illimitable life, and all of the murmurous, remote and mighty
sounds of time for ever held there in the station, together with
a tart and nasal voice, a hand's-breadth off that said: "There's
hahdly time, but try it if you want."</p>

<p>He saw the narrow, twisted, age-browned streets of Boston,
then, with their sultry fragrance of fresh-roasted coffee, the
sight of the man-swarm passing in its million-footed weft, the
distant drone and murmur of the great mysterious city all about
him, the shining water of the Basin, and the murmur of the
harbour and its ships, the promise of glory and of a thousand
secret, lovely and mysterious women that were waiting somewhere
in the city's web.</p>

<p>He saw the furious streets of life with their unending
flood-tide of a million faces, the enormous library with its
million books; or was it just one moment in the flood-tide of the
city, at five o'clock, a voice, a face, a brawny lusty girl with
smiling mouth who passed him in an instant at the Park Street
station, stood printed in the strong October wind a
moment--breast, belly, arm, and thigh, and all her brawny
lustihood--and then had gone into the man-swarm, lost for ever,
never found?</p>

<p>Was it at such a moment--engine-smoke, a station, a street,
the sound of time, a face that came and passed and vanished,
could not be forgot--<i>here</i> or <i>here</i> or <i>here,</i>
at such a moment of man's unrecorded memory, that he breathed
fury from the air, that fury came?</p>

<p>He never knew; but now mad fury gripped his life, and he was
haunted by the dream of time. Ten years must come and go without
a moment's rest from fury, ten years of fury, hunger, all of the
wandering in a young man's life. And for what? For what?</p>

<p>What is the fury which this youth will feel, which will lash
him on against the great earth for ever? It is the brain that
maddens with its own excess, the heart that breaks from the
anguish of its own frustration. It is the hunger that grows from
everything it feeds upon, the thirst that gulps down rivers and
remains insatiate. It is to see a million men, a million faces
and to be a stranger and an alien to them always. It is to prowl
the stacks of an enormous library at night, to tear the books out
of a thousand shelves, to read in them with the mad hunger of the
youth of man.</p>

<p>It is to have the old unquiet mind, the famished heart, the
restless soul; it is to lose hope, heart, and all joy utterly,
and then to have them wake again, to have the old feeling return
with overwhelming force that he is about to find the thing for
which his life obscurely and desperately is groping--for which
all men on this earth have sought--one face out of the million
faces, a wall, a door, a place of certitude and peace and
wandering no more. For what is it that we Americans are seeking
always on this earth? Why is it we have crossed the stormy seas
so many times alone, lain in a thousand alien rooms at night
hearing the sounds of time, dark time, and thought until heart,
brain, flesh and spirit were sick and weary with the thought of
it: "Where shall I go now? What shall I do?"</p>

<p>He did not know the moment that it came, but it came
instantly, at once. And from that moment on mad fury seized him,
from that moment on, his life, more than the life of any one that
he would ever know, was to be spent in solitude and wandering.
Why this was true, or how it happened, he would never know; yet
it was so. From this time on--save for two intervals in his
life--he was to live about as solitary a life as a modern man can
have. And it is meant by this that the number of hours, days,
months, and years--the actual time he spent alone--would be
immense and extraordinary.</p>

<p>And this fact was all the more astonishing because he never
seemed to seek out solitude, nor did he shrink from life, or seek
to build himself into a wall away from all the fury and the
turmoil of the earth. Rather, he loved life so dearly that he was
driven mad by the thirst and hunger which he felt for it. Of this
fury, which was to lash and drive him on for fifteen years, the
thousandth part could not be told, and what is told may seem
unbelievable, but it is true. He was driven by a hunger so
literal, cruel and physical that it wanted to devour the earth
and all the things and people in it, and when it failed in this
attempt, his spirit would drown in an ocean of horror and
desolation, smothered below the overwhelming tides of this great
earth, sickened and made sterile, hopeless, dead by the
stupefying weight of men and objects in the world, the
everlasting flock and flooding of the crowd.</p>

<p>Now he would prowl the stacks of the library at night, pulling
books out of a thousand shelves and reading in them like a
madman. The thought of these vast stacks of books would drive him
mad: the more he read, the less he seemed to know--the greater
the number of the books he read, the greater the immense
uncountable number of those which he could never read would seem
to be. Within a period of ten years he read at least 20,000
volumes--deliberately the number is set low--and opened the pages
and looked through many times that number. This may seem
unbelievable, but it happened. Dryden said this about Ben Jonson:
"Other men read books, but he read libraries"--and so now was it
with this boy. Yet this terrific orgy of the books brought him no
comfort, peace, or wisdom of the mind and heart. Instead, his
fury and despair increased from what they fed upon, his hunger
mounted with the food it ate.</p>

<p>He read insanely, by the hundreds, the thousands, the ten
thousands, yet he had no desire to be bookish; no one could
describe this mad assault upon print as scholarly: a ravening
appetite to him demanded that he read everything that had ever
been written about human experience. He read no more from
pleasure--the thought that other books were waiting for him tore
at his heart for ever. He pictured himself as tearing the
entrails from a book as from a fowl. At first, hovering over
bookstalls, or walking at night among the vast piled shelves of
the library, he would read, watch in hand, muttering to himself
in triumph or anger at the timing of each page: "Fifty seconds to
do that one. Damn you, we'll see! You will, will you?"--and he
would tear through the next page in twenty seconds.</p>

<p>This fury which drove him on to read so many books had nothing
to do with scholarship, nothing to do with academic honours,
nothing to do with formal learning. He was not in any way a
scholar and did not want to be one. He simply wanted to know
about everything on earth; he wanted to devour the earth, and it
drove him mad when he saw he could not do this. And it was the
same with everything he did. In the midst of a furious burst of
reading in the enormous library, the thought of the streets
outside and the great city all around him would drive through his
body like a sword. It would now seem to him that every second
that he passed among the books was being wasted--that at this
moment something priceless, irrecoverable was happening in the
streets, and that if he could only get to it in time and see it,
he would somehow get the knowledge of the whole thing in him--the
source, the well, the spring from which all men and words and
actions, and every design upon this earth proceeds.</p>

<p>And he would rush out in the streets to find it, be hurled
through the tunnel into Boston and then spend hours in driving
himself savagely through a hundred streets, looking into the
faces of a million people, trying to get an instant and
conclusive picture of all they did and said and were, of all
their million destinies, and of the great city and the
everlasting earth, and the immense and lonely skies that bent
above them. And he would search the furious streets until bone
and brain and blood could stand no more--until every sinew of his
life and spirit was wrung, trembling, and exhausted, and his
heart sank down beneath its weight of desolation and despair.</p>

<p>Yet a furious hope, a wild extravagant belief, was burning in
him all the time. He would write down enormous charts and plans
and projects of all that he proposed to do in life--a programme
of work and living which would have exhausted the energies of
10,000 men. He would get up in the middle of the night to scrawl
down insane catalogues of all that he had seen and done:--the
number of books he had read, the number of miles he had
travelled, the number of people he had known, the number of women
he had slept with, the number of meals he had eaten, the number
of towns he had visited, the number of states he had been in.</p>

<p>And at one moment he would gloat and chuckle over these
stupendous lists like a miser gloating over his hoard, only to
groan bitterly with despair the next moment, and to beat his head
against the wall, as he remembered the overwhelming amount of all
he had not seen or done, or known. Then he would begin another
list filled with enormous catalogues of all the books he had not
read, all the food he had not eaten, all the women that he had
not slept with, all the states he had not been in, all the towns
he had not visited. Then he would write down plans and programmes
whereby all these things must be accomplished, how many years it
would take to do it all, and how old he would be when he had
finished. An enormous wave of hope and joy would surge up in him,
because it now looked easy, and he had no doubt at all that he
could do it.</p>

<p>He never asked himself in any practical way how he was going
to live while this was going on, where he was going to get the
money for this gigantic adventure, and what he was going to do to
make it possible. If he thought about it, it seemed to have no
importance or reality whatever--he just dismissed it impatiently,
or with a conviction that some old man would die and leave him a
fortune, that he was going to pick up a purse containing hundreds
of thousands of dollars while walking in the Fenway, and that the
reward would be enough to keep him going, or that a beautiful and
rich young widow, true-hearted, tender, loving, and voluptuous,
who had carrot-coloured hair, little freckles on her face, a snub
nose and luminous grey-green eyes with something wicked, yet
loving and faithful in them, and one gold filling in her solid
little teeth, was going to fall in love with him, marry him, and
be for ever true and faithful to him while he went reading,
eating, drinking, whoring, and devouring his way around the
world; or finally that he would write a book or play every year
or so, which would be a great success, and yield him fifteen or
twenty thousand dollars at a crack. Thus, he went storming away
at the whole earth about him, sometimes mad with despair,
weariness, and bewilderment; and sometimes wild with a jubilant
and exultant joy and certitude as the conviction came to him that
everything would happen as he wished. Then at night he would hear
the vast sounds and silence of the earth and of the city, he
would begin to think of the dark sleeping earth and of the
continent of night, until it seemed to him it all was spread
before him like a map--rivers, plains, and mountains and 10,000
sleeping towns; it seemed to him that he saw everything at
once.</p>

<h1>VIII</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>One morning, a few days after his arrival in Cambridge, he had
received a letter, written on plain but costly paper in a fine
but almost feminine hand. The letter read as follows:</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Dear Sir: I should be pleased to have your company for dinner
Wednesday evening at eight-thirty at the 'Cock House Tavern' on
Brattle Street. In case of your acceptance will you kindly call
at my rooms in Holyoke House, opposite the Widener Library, at
seven-fifteen?</p>

<p>"Sincerely yours,</p>

<p>"FRANCIS STARWICK."</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>He read that curt and cryptic note over and over with feelings
mixed of astonishment and excitement. Who was Francis Starwick?
Why should Francis Starwick, a stranger of whom he had never
heard, invite him to dinner? And why was that laconic note not
accompanied by a word of explanation?</p>

<p>It is likely he would have gone anyway, from sheer curiosity,
and because of the desperate eagerness with which a young man,
alone in a strange world for the first time, welcomes any hope of
friendship. But before the day was over, he had learned from
another student in Professor Hatcher's celebrated course for
dramatists, of which he himself was now a member, that Francis
Starwick was Professor Hatcher's assistant; and correctly
inferring that the invitation had some connection with this
circumstance, he resolved to go.</p>

<p>In this way, his acquaintance began with that rare and
tragically gifted creature who was one of the most extraordinary
figures of his generation and who, possessing almost every talent
that an artist needs, was lacking in that one small grain of
common earth that could have saved him, and brought his work to
life.</p>

<p>No fatality rested on that casual meeting. He could not have
foreseen in what strange and sorrowful ways his life would weave
and interweave with this other one, nor could he have known from
any circumstance of that first meeting that this other youth was
destined to be that triune figure in his life, of which each man
knows one and only one, in youth, and which belongs to the
weather of man's life, and to the fabric of his destiny: his
friend, his brother--and his mortal enemy. Nor was there, in the
boy he met that night, any prefigurement of the tragic fatality
with which that brilliant life was starred, the horrible end
toward which, perhaps, it even then was directed.</p>

<p>They were both young men, and both filled with all the vanity,
anguish and hot pride of youth, and with its devotion and
humility; they were both strong in their proud hope and faith and
untried confidence; they both had shining gifts and powers and
they were sure the world was theirs; they were splendid and
fierce and weak and strong and foolish; the prescience of wild
swelling joy was in them; and the goat cry was still torn from
their wild young throats. They knew that the most fortunate, good
and happy life that any man had ever known was theirs, if they
would only take it; they knew that it impended instantly--the
fortune, fame, and love for which their souls were panting;
neither had yet turned the dark column, they knew that they were
twenty, and that they could never die.</p>

<p>Francis Starwick, on first sight, was a youth of medium height
and average weight, verging perhaps toward slenderness, with a
pleasant ruddy face, brown eyes, a mass of curly auburn-reddish
hair, and a cleft chin. The face in its pleasant cast and healthy
tone, and spacious, quiet intelligence was strikingly like those
faces of young Englishmen which were painted by Hoppner and Sir
Henry Raeburn towards the beginning of the nineteenth century. It
was an attractive, pleasant immensely sensitive and intelligent
face, but when Starwick spoke this impression of warmth and
friendliness was instantly destroyed.</p>

<p>He spoke in a strange and rather disturbing tone, the pitch
and timbre of which it would be almost impossible to define, but
which would haunt one who had heard it for ever after. His voice
was neither very high nor low, it was a man's voice and yet one
felt it might almost have been a woman's; but there was nothing
at all effeminate about it. It was simply a strange voice
compared to most American voices, which are rasping, nasal,
brutally coarse or metallic. Starwick's voice had a disturbing
lurking resonance, an exotic, sensuous, and almost voluptuous
quality. Moreover, the peculiar mannered affectation of his
speech was so studied that it hardly escaped extravagance. If it
had not been for the dignity, grace, and intelligence of his
person, the affectation of his speech might have been ridiculous.
As it was, the other youth felt the moment's swift resentment and
hostility that is instinctive with the American when he thinks
some one is speaking in an affected manner.</p>

<p>As Starwick welcomed his guest his ruddy face flushed
brick-red with the agonizing embarrassment of a shy and sensitive
person to whom every new meeting is an ordeal; his greeting was
almost repellently cold and formal, but this, too, with the
studied affectation of his speech, was protective armour for his
shyness.</p>

<p>"A-d'ye-do?" he said, shaking hands, the greeting coming from
his throat through lips that scarcely seemed to move. "It was
good of you to come."</p>

<p>"It was good of you to ask me," the other boy said awkwardly,
fumbled desperately for a moment, and then blurted out--"I didn't
know who you were at first--when I got your note--but then
somebody told me:--you're Professor Hatcher's assistant, aren't
you?"</p>

<p>"Ace," said Starwick, this strange sound which was intended
for "yes" coming through his lips in the same curious and almost
motionless fashion. The brick-red hue of his ruddy face deepened
painfully, and for a moment he was silent--"Look!" he said
suddenly, yet with a casualness that was very warm and welcome
after the stilted formality of his greeting, "would you like a
drink? I have some whisky."</p>

<p>"Why, yes--sure--certainly," the other stammered, almost
feverishly grateful for the diversion--"I'd like it."</p>

<p>Starwick opened the doors of a small cupboard, took out a
bottle, a siphon, and some glasses on a tray, and placed them on
a table.</p>

<p>"Help yourself," he said. "Do you like it with soda--or plain
water--or how?"</p>

<p>"Why--any way you do," the other youth stammered. "Aren't you
going to drink? I don't want to unless you do."</p>

<p>"Ace," said Starwick again, "I'll drink with you. I like the
soda," he added, and poured a drink for himself and filled it
with the siphon. "Go on. Pour your own. . . . Look," he said
abruptly again, as the other youth was awkwardly manipulating the
unaccustomed siphon. "Do you mind if I drink mine while I'm
shaving? I just came in. I'd like to shave and change my shirt
before we go out. Do you mind?"</p>

<p>"No, of course not," the other said, grateful for the respite
thus afforded. "Go ahead. Take all the time you like. I'll drink
my drink and have a look at your books, if you don't mind."</p>

<p>"Please do," said Starwick, "if you find anything you like. I
think this is the best chair." He pushed a big chair up beneath a
reading lamp and switched the light on. "There are cigarettes on
the table," he said in his strange mannered tone, and went into
the bathroom, where, after a moment's inspection of his ruddy
face, he immediately began to lather himself and to prepare for
shaving.</p>

<p>"This is a nice place you have here," the visitor said
presently, after another awkward pause, during which the only
sound was the minute scrape of the razor blade on Starwick's
face.</p>

<p>"Quite," he answered concisely, in his mannered tone, and with
that blurred sound of people who try to talk while they are
shaving. For a few moments the razor scraped on. "I'm glad you
like it," Starwick said presently, as he put the razor down and
began to inspect his work in the mirror. "And what kind of place
did you find for yourself? Do you like it?"</p>

<p>"Well, it will do, I guess," the other boy said dubiously. "Of
course, it's nothing like this--it's not an apartment; it's just
a room I rented."</p>

<p>"Ace," said Starwick from the bathroom. "And where is
that?"</p>

<p>"It's on a street called Buckingham Road. Do you know where
that is?"</p>

<p>"Oh," said Starwick coldly, and he craned carefully with his
neck, and was silent a moment as he did a little delicate
razor-work around the Adam's apple. "Ace," he said at length as
he put the razor down again. "I think I do. . . . And how did you
happen to go out there?" he inquired coldly as he began to dry
his face on a towel. "Did some one tell you about the place?"</p>

<p>"Well--yes. I knew about it before I came. It's a room in a
house that some people I know have rented."</p>

<p>"Oh," said Starwick coldly, formally again, as he thrust his
arms into a fresh shirt. "Then you do know people here in
Cambridge?"</p>

<p>"Well, no: they are really people from home."</p>

<p>"Home?"</p>

<p>"Yes--from my own state, the place I came from, where I went
to school before I came here."</p>

<p>"Oh," said Starwick, buttoning his shirt, "I see. And where
was that? What state are you from?"</p>

<p>"Catawba."</p>

<p>"Oh. . . . And you went to school down there?"</p>

<p>"Yes. To the State University."</p>

<p>"I see. . . . And these people who have the house where you
are living now--what are they doing here?"</p>

<p>"Well, the man--he's a professor at the State University down
there--he's up here getting some sort of degree in
education."</p>

<p>"In what?"</p>

<p>"In education."</p>

<p>"Oh. I see. . . . And what does his wife do; has he got a
wife?"</p>

<p>"Yes; and three children. . . . Well," the other youth said
uncertainly, and then laughed suddenly, "I haven't seen her do
anything yet but sit on her tail and talk."</p>

<p>"Ace?" said Starwick, knotting his tie very carefully. "And
what does she talk about?"</p>

<p>"Of people back home, mostly--the professors at the
University, and their wives and families."</p>

<p>"Oh," said Starwick gravely, but there was now lurking in his
voice an indefinable drollery of humour. "And does she say nice
things about them?" He looked out towards his guest with a grave
face, but a sly burble in his voice now escaped him and broke out
in an infectious chuckling laugh. "Or is she--" for a moment he
was silent, trembling a little with secret merriment, and his
pleasant face reddened with laughter--"or is she," he said with
sly insinuation--"bitter?"</p>

<p>The other, somehow conquered by the sly yet broad and vulgar
humour in Starwick's tone, broke out into a loud guffaw, and
said:</p>

<p>"God! she's bitter--and nothing but! That's just the word for
it."</p>

<p>"Has anyone escaped yet?" said Starwick slyly.</p>

<p>"Not a damned one of them," the other roared. "She's worked
her way from the President and his family all the way down to the
instructors. Now she's started on the people of the town. I've
heard about every miscarriage and every dirty pair of drawers
that ever happened there. We've got a bet on, a friend of mine
from home who's also staying there--he's in the Law
School--whether she's going to say anything good about anyone
before the year is over."</p>

<p>"And which side have you?" said Starwick.</p>

<p>"I say she won't--but Billy Ingram says she will. He says that
the last time she said anything good about anyone was when
someone died during the influenza epidemic in 1917; and he claims
she's due again."</p>

<p>"And what is the lady's name?" said Starwick. He had now come
out into the living room and was putting on his coat.</p>

<p>"Trotter," the other said, feeling a strange convulsive humour
swelling in him. "Mrs. Trotter."</p>

<p>"What?" said Starwick, his face reddening and the sly burble
appearing in his voice again. "Mrs.--who?"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Trotter!" the other choked, and the room rang suddenly
with their wild laughter. When it had subsided, Starwick blew his
nose vigorously, and his pleasant face still reddened with
laughter, he asked smoothly:</p>

<p>"And what does Professor Trotter say while this is going
on?"</p>

<p>"He doesn't say anything," the other laughed. "He can't say
anything. He just sits there and listens. . . . The man's all
right. Billy and I feel sorry for him. He's got this damned old
shrew of a wife who sits there talking ninety to the minute, and
three of the meanest, dirtiest, noisiest little devils you ever
saw falling over his feet and raising hell from morning to night,
and this sloppy nigger wench they brought up with them from the
South--the place looks like an earthquake hit it, and the poor
devil is up here trying to study for a degree--it's pretty hard
on him. He's a nice fellow, and he doesn't deserve it."</p>

<p>"God!" said Starwick frankly and gravely, "but it sounds
dreary! Why did you ever go to such a place?"</p>

<p>"Well, you see, I didn't know anyone in Cambridge--and I had
known these people back home."</p>

<p>"I should think that would have made you anxious to avoid
them," Starwick answered. "And it's most important that you have
a pleasant place to work in. It really is, you know," he said
earnestly and with a note of reproof in his mannered tone. "You
really should be more careful about that," he said.</p>

<p>"Yes, I suppose it is. You certainly have a good place
here."</p>

<p>"Ace," said Starwick. "It is very pleasant. I'm glad you like
it."</p>

<p>He came out, with his drink in his hand, put the drink down on
a table and sat down beside it, crossing his legs and reaching
for one of the straw-tipped cigarettes in a small and curiously
carved wooden box. The impression he made on the other youth was
one of magnificence and luxury. The boy's rooms seemed to fit his
sensuous and elegant personality like a glove: he was only
twenty-two years old, but his distinctive and incomparable
quality was everywhere about him in these two rooms.</p>

<p>To the unaccustomed eyes of the younger boy, these modest
rooms seemed to be the most magnificent apartment he had seen.
For a moment he thought that Starwick must be an immensely
wealthy person to live in such a way. The fact that a man so
young should live in such splendid and luxurious
independence--that he should "have his own place," an apartment
of his own, instead of a rented room, the thrilling solitudes of
midnight privacy to himself, the freedom to come and go as he
pleased, to do as he wished, to invite to his place whoever he
chose, "to bring a girl there" whenever he wanted, without fear
or the need for stealth--all these simple things which are just
part of the grand and hopeful joy of youth, which the younger boy
had never known, but to which he had aspired, as every youth
aspires, in many a thrilling fantasy--now made Starwick's life
seem almost impossibly fortunate, happy and exciting.</p>

<p>And yet it was not merely his own inexperience that made
Starwick seem so wealthy. Starwick, although he had no regular
income save a thousand dollars a year which he received for his
work as Professor Hatcher's assistant, and small sums he got from
time to time from his family--he was, incredibly enough, the
youngest of a middle-western family of nine children, small
business and farming people in modest circumstances--gave the
impression of wealth because he really was a wealthy person: he
had been born wealthy, endowed with wealth by nature. In
everything he did and said and was, in all he touched, in the
whole quality of his rare and sensuous personality there was an
opulence of wealth and luxury such as could not be found in a
hundred millionaires. He had that rare and priceless quality that
is seldom found in anyone, and almost never in Americans, of
being able to give to any simple act or incident a glamour of
luxury, pleasure, excitement. Thus, when he smoked a cigarette,
or drank a drink, or invited someone to go with him to the
theatre, or ordered a meal in a shabby Italian restaurant, or
made coffee in his rooms, or talked of something he had read in a
book, or tied his neck-tie--all these things had a rare,
wonderful and thrilling quality in them that the richest
millionaire in the world could not have bought for money. And for
this reason, people were instantly captivated by the infinite
grace and persuasiveness of Starwick's personality: he had the
power, as few people in the world have ever had the power,
instantly to conquer and command the devotion of people because,
while they were with him, everything in the world took on a
freshness, wonder, joy and opulence it had never had before, and
for this reason people wanted to be near him, to live in this
thrilling enchantment that he gave to everything.</p>

<p>Even as he sat there smoking, drinking and talking with his
guest, he did a simple and characteristic thing that yet seemed
wonderful and thrilling to the other boy.</p>

<p>"Look," said Starwick suddenly, getting up, going over to one
of his bookshelves and switching on a light. "Look," he said
again, in his strangely fibred voice, "did you ever read
this?"</p>

<p>As he uttered these words he took a book from one of the
shelves and put on his spectacles. There was something strange
and wonderful about the spectacles, and in the way he put them
on, quietly, severely, plainly; the spectacles had thick
old-fashioned silver rims, and silver handles. Their plain,
honest and old-fashioned sobriety was somehow remarkable, and as
he put them on, with a patient and quiet movement, and turned his
attention to the pages of the book, the gravity and maturity of
quiet and lonely thought in the boy's face and head were,
remarkably evident.</p>

<p>"Did you ever read this?" he said quietly, turning to the
other youth, and handing him the book. It was a copy of George
Moore's <i>Confessions of a Young Man:</i> the other replied he
had not read it.</p>

<p>"Then," said Starwick, "why don't you take it along with you?
It's really quite amusing." He switched off the light above the
bookshelves, took off his glasses with a quiet tired movement,
and folding them and putting them in his breast pocket, came back
to the table and sat down.</p>

<p>"I think it may interest you," he said.</p>

<p>Although the other boy had always felt an instinctive
repulsion towards books which someone else urged him to read,
something in Starwick's simple act had suddenly given the book a
strange rare value: he felt a strange and pleasurable excitement
when he thought about it, and was instantly eager and curious to
read it. Moreover, in an indefinable way, he had understood, the
moment that Starwick turned to him, that he was <i>giving,</i>
and not <i>lending</i> him the book; and this act, too, instantly
was invested with a princely and generous opulence. It was this
way with everything that Starwick did: everything he touched
would come instantly to life with grace and joy; his was an
incomparable, an enslaving power--a Midas-gift of life and joy
almost too fortunate and effortless for one man to possess and in
the end, like all his other gifts of life and joy, a power that
would serve death, not life, that would spread corruption instead
of health, and that finally would turn upon its owner and destroy
him.</p>

<p>Later, when they left his rooms and went out on the street,
the sensuous quickening of life, the vital excitement and
anticipation which Starwick was somehow able to convey to
everything he did and give to everyone he knew and liked, was
constantly apparent. It was a fine clear night in early October,
crispness and an indefinable smell of smoke were in the air,
students were coming briskly along the street, singly or in
groups of two or three, light glowed warmly in the windows of the
book-shops, pharmacies, and tobacco stores near Harvard Square,
and from the enormous library and the old buildings in the
Harvard Yard there came a glow of lights, soft, rich, densely
golden, embedded in old red brick.</p>

<p>All of these things, vital, exciting, strangely, pleasurably
stirring as they were, gained a curious enhancement from
Starwick's presence until they gave to the younger boy not only a
feeling of sharp, mounting, strangely indefinable excitement, but
a feeling of power and wealth--a sense of being triumphant and
having before him the whole golden and unvisited plantation of
the world to explore, possess and do with as he would--the most
fortunate and happy life that any man had ever known.</p>

<p>Starwick went into a tobacco shop to cash a cheque and the
whole place, with its pungent smells of good tobacco, its idling
students, its atmosphere of leisure and enjoyment, became
incomparably wealthy, rich, exciting as it had never been
before.</p>

<p>And later, when the two young men had gone into the "Cock
House Tavern" on Brattle Street, the prim and clean little rooms
of the old house, the clean starched waitresses and snowy
tablecloth, the good food, and several healthy and
attractive-looking girls of the New England type all gained an
increased value. He felt a thrill of pleasurable anticipation and
a feeling of unlimited wealth, simply because Starwick was there
ordering the meal, conferring on everything around him the sense
of wealth and ease and nameless joy which his wonderful
personality, with its magic touch, instantly gave to anything on
earth.</p>

<p>Yet during the meal the feeling of hostile constraint between
the two young men was not diminished, but grew constantly.
Starwick's impeccable cold courtesy--really the armour of a
desperately shy person--his mannered tone, with its strange and
disturbing accent, the surgical precision of his
cross-examination into the origin, experience, and training of
the other youth sharpened a growing antagonism in the other's
spirit, and put him on his guard. Moreover, failure to give any
information about himself--above all his complete reticence
concerning his association with Professor Hatcher and the reason
for his curt and brusquely-worded invitation to dinner--all this
began to bear now with oppressive weight upon the other's spirit.
It seemed to him there was a deliberate arrogance in this cold
reticence. He began to feel a sullen resentment because of this
secretive and mysterious conduct. And later that evening when the
two young men parted, the manner of each of them was cold and
formal. They bowed stiffly, shook hands with each other coldly,
and marched away. It was several months before the younger would
again talk to Starwick, and during that period he thought of him
with a feeling of resentment, almost of dislike.</p>

<p> </p>

<h1>IX</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>That first impact of the city had stunned him with its huge
and instant shock, and now, like a swimmer whelmed in a raging
storm, he sought desperately among that unceasing flood of faces
for one that he knew, one that he could call his own, and
suddenly he thought of Uncle Bascom. When his mother had told him
he should go to see his uncle and his family as soon as he could
he had nodded his head mechanically and muttered a few words of
perfunctory assent, but so busy were his mind and heart with his
shining vision of the city and all the magic he was sure to find
there that it had never seriously occurred to him that he would
turn eagerly to the old man for companionship and help.</p>

<p>But now, the day after his arrival in the city, he found
himself pawing eagerly through the pages of the phone book for
his uncle's business address: he found it--the familiar words,
"Bascom Pentland" stared up out of the crowded page with a kind
of unreal shocking incandescence, and in another moment he heard
himself speaking across the wire to a puzzled voice that came to
him with its curious and unearthly remoteness as if from some
planetary distance--and suddenly the howling recognition of the
words--words whose unearthly quality now came back to him in a
searing flash of memory, although he had not heard his uncle's
voice for eight years, when he was twelve years old:</p>

<p>"Oh, hello! hello! hello!" that unearthly voice howled faintly
at him. "How are you, my boy, how are you, how are you, how are
you? . . . And say!" the voice yelled with a sudden comical
transition to matter of factness--"I had a letter from your
mother just this morning. She told me you were on your way. . . .
I've been expecting you."</p>

<p>"Can I come over to see you now, Uncle Bascom?"</p>

<p>"Oh, by all means, by all means, by all means!" that unearthly
and passionate voice howled back at once enthusiastically. "Come
over at once, my boy, at once! Oh, by all means, by all means, by
all means! . . . And now, my boy!" the voice became faintly and
comically precise, and he could hear his uncle smacking his large
rubbery lips with pedantic relish as he pronounced the words:
"Know-ing you are a young man alone in this great city for the
first time, I shall give you a few brief--and, I trust,
reasonably clear, di-rections," again Bascom smacked his lips
with audible relish as he pronounced this lovely
word--"concerning your i-tin-er-ary"--his joy as he smacked his
lips over this last word was almost indecently evident, and he
went on with meticulous elaboration through a bewildering
labyrinth of instructions until even he was satisfied at the
confusion he had caused. Then he said good-bye, upon the
assurance of his nephew that he would come at once. And it was in
this way, after eight years of absence, that the boy again met
his uncle.</p>

<p>He found the old man hardly changed at all. He was, indeed, a
member of that race of men who scarcely vary by a jot from one
decade to another; he was a trifle greyer, the stringy gauntness
of his tall stooped frame was perhaps a little more pronounced,
his eccentric tricks of speech and manner a little more
emphatic--but this was all. In dress, speech, manner and
appearance he was to an amazing degree the same as he had been
the last time that his nephew saw him.</p>

<p>It is doubtful, in fact, if he had changed appreciably in
thirty years. And certainly during the first twenty-five years of
this century, business people who had their offices in or near
State Street, Boston, and who had grown very familiar with that
cadaverous and extraordinary figure, could have testified that he
had not changed at all. His daily appearances, indeed, had become
so much a part of the established process of events in that
crowded street, that they had attained a kind of ritualistic
dignity, and any serious alteration in their pattern would have
seemed to hundreds of people to whom his gaunt bowed figure had
become familiar, almost to constitute a serious disruption of the
natural order.</p>

<p>Shortly before nine o'clock of every working day he would
emerge from a subway exit near the head of the street and pause
vaguely for a moment, making a craggy eddy in the tide of issuing
workers that foamed swiftly about him while he stood with his
enormous bony hands clutched comically before him at the waist,
as if holding himself in, at the same time making the most
horrible grimaces with his lean and amazingly flexible features.
These grimaces were made by squinting his small sharp eyes
together, widening his mouth in a ghastly travesty of a grin, and
convolving his chin and cheek in a rapid series of pursed lips
and horrible squints as he swiftly pressed his rubbery underlip
against a few enormous horse-teeth that decorated his upper jaw.
Having completed these facial evolutions, he glanced quickly and,
it must be supposed, blindly, in every direction; for he then
plunged heedlessly across the street, sometimes choosing the
moment when traffic had been halted, and pedestrians were
hurrying across, sometimes diving into the midst of a roaring
chaos of motor cars, trucks, and wagons, through which he
sometimes made his way in safety, accompanied only by a scream of
brake-bands, a startled barking of horns, and the hearty curses
of frightened drivers, or from which, howling with terror in the
centre of a web of traffic which he had snarled hopelessly and
brought to a complete standstill, he was sometimes rescued by a
red-faced and cursing young Irishman who was on point-duty at
that corner.</p>

<p>But Bascom was a fated man and he escaped. Once, it is true, a
bright mindless beetle of machinery, which had no thought for
fated men, had knocked him down and skinned and bruised him;
again, an uninstructed wheel had passed across the soft toe-end
of his shoe and held him prisoner, as if he were merely some
average son of destiny--but he escaped. He escaped because he was
a fated man and because the providence which guides the steps of
children and the blind was kind to him; and because this same
policeman whose simian upper lip had once been thick and twisted
with its curses had long since run the scale from anger to wild
fury, and thence to madness and despair and resignation, and had
now come to have a motherly affection for this stray sheep, kept
his eye peeled for its appearance every morning, or, failing
this, at once shrilled hard upon his whistle when he heard the
well-known howl of terror and surprise, plunged to the centre of
the stalled traffic snarl, plucked Bascom out to safety under
curse and shout and scream of brake, and marched him tenderly to
the curb, gripping his brawny hand around the old man's arm,
feeling his joints, testing his bones, massaging anxiously his
sinewy carcass, and calling him "bud"--although Bascom was old
enough to be his grandfather. "Are you all right, bud? You're not
hurt, are you, bud? Are you O.K.?"--to which Bascom, if his shock
and terror had been great, could make no answer for a moment save
to pant hoarsely and to howl loudly and huskily from time to
time, "Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!"</p>

<p>At length, becoming more coherent, if not more calm, he would
launch into an ecclesiastical indictment of motor cars and their
drivers delivered in a high, howling, and husky voice that
suggested the pronouncements of a prophet from a mountain. This
voice had a quality of strange remoteness and, once heard, would
never be forgotten. It actually had a howling note in it, and
carried to great distances, and yet it was not loud: it was very
much as if Mr. Bascom Pentland were standing on a mountain and
shouting to someone in a quiet valley below--the sounds came to
one plainly but as if from a great distance, and it was full of a
husky, unearthly passion. It was really an ecclesiastical voice,
the voice of a great preacher; one felt that it should be heard
in churches, which was exactly where it once was heard, for
Bascom had at various times and with great conviction, in the
course of his long and remarkable life, professed and preached
the faith of the Episcopalians, the Presbyterians, the
Methodists, the Baptists, and the Unitarians.</p>

<p>Quite often, in fact, as now, when he had narrowly escaped
disaster in the streets, Bascom still preached from the corner:
as soon as he recovered somewhat from his shock, he would launch
forth into a sermon of eloquent invective against any driver of
motor cars within hearing, and if any of them entered the fray,
as sometimes happened, a very interesting performance
occurred.</p>

<p>"What happened to <i>you?"</i> the motorist might bitterly
remark. "Do the keepers know you're out?"</p>

<p>Mr. Pentland would thereupon retort with an eloquent harangue,
beginning with a few well-chosen quotations from the more violent
prophets of the Old Testament, a few predictions of death,
destruction and damnation for the owners of motor cars, and a few
apt references to Days of Judgment and Reckoning, Chariots of
Moloch, and Beasts of the Apocalypse.</p>

<p>"Oh, for God's sake!" the exasperated motorist might reply.
"Are you <i>blind?</i> Where do you think you are? In a
cow-pasture? Can't you read the signals? Didn't you see the cop
put his hand up? Don't you know when it says to 'Stop' or 'Go'?
Did you ever hear of the traffic law?"</p>

<p>"The <i>traffic</i> law!" Bascom sneeringly exclaimed, as if
the mere use of the word by the motorist evoked his profoundest
contempt. His voice now had a precise and meticulous way of
speech, there was something sneering and pedantic in the way he
pronounced each word, biting it off with a prim, nasal and
heavily accented enunciation in the manner of certain pedants and
purists who suggest by their pronunciation that language in the
mouths of most people is vilely and carelessly treated, that each
word has a precise, subtle, and careful meaning of its own, and
that they--<i>they</i> alone--understand these matters. "The
<i>traffic</i> law!" he repeated again: then he squinted his eyes
together, pursed his rubbery lip against the big horsy upper
teeth, and laughed down his nose in a forced, sneering manner.
"The <i>traffic</i> law!" he said. "Why, you pit-i-ful
ig-no-<i>ram</i>-us! You il-<i>lit</i>-ter-ate ruffian! You dare
to speak to me--to <i>me!"</i> he howled suddenly with an
ecclesiastical lift of his voice, striking himself on his bony
breast and glaring with a majestical fury as if the word of a
mighty prophet had been contradicted by an upstart--"of the
traffic law, when it is doubtful if you could <i>read</i> the law
if you saw it,"--he sneered--"and it is obvious to anyone with
the perception of a schoolboy that you would not have
intelligence enough to understand it, and"--here his voice rose
to a howling emphasis and he held one huge bony finger up to
command attention--<i>"and</i> to interpret it, if you could
read."</p>

<p>"Is <i>that</i> so?" the motorist heavily remarked. "A
<i>wise</i> guy, eh? One of these guys who knows it all, eh?
You're a <i>pretty</i> wise guy, aren't you?" the motorist
continued bitterly, as if caught up in the circle of his refrain
and unable to change it. "Well, let me tell <i>you</i> something.
You think you're pretty smaht, don't you? Well, you're not. See?
It's wise guys like you who go around looking for a good bust on
the nose. See? That's how smaht you are. If you wasn't an old guy
I'd give you one, too," he said, getting a moody satisfaction
from the thought.</p>

<p>"Ow-w! Ow-w! Ow-w!" Bascom howled in sudden terror.</p>

<p>"If you know so much, if you're so smaht as you think you are,
what <i>is</i> the traffic law?"</p>

<p>Then, assuredly, if there was a traffic law, the unfortunate
motorist was lost, for Uncle Bascom would deliver it to him
verbatim, licking his lips with joy over all the technicalities
of legal phrasing and pronouncing each phrase with a meticulous
and pedantic enunciation.</p>

<p>"And furthermore!" he howled, holding up his big bony finger,
"the Commonwealth of Massachusetts has decreed, by a statute that
has been on the books since 1856, by a statute that is
irrevocably, inexorably, ineluctably plain that any driver,
director, governor, commander, manager, agent or conductor, or
any other person who shall conduct or cause to be conducted any
vehicular instrument, whether it be of two, four, six, eight or
any number of wheels whatsoever, whether it be in the public
service, or in the possession of a private individual, whether it
be--" but by this time the motorist, if he was wise, had had
enough and had escaped.</p>

<p>If, however, it had been one of his more fortunate mornings,
if he had blindly but successfully threaded the peril of roaring
traffic, Uncle Bascom proceeded rapidly down State Street, still
clutching his raw bony hands across his meagre waist, still
contorting his remarkable face in its endless series of pursed
grimaces, and presently turned in to the entrance of a large
somewhat dingy-looking building of blackened stone, one of those
solid, unpretentious, but very valuable properties which smell
and look like the early 1900's, and which belong to that ancient
and enormously wealthy corporation across the river known as
Harvard University.</p>

<p>Here, Uncle Bascom, still clutching himself together across
the waist, mounted a flight of indented marble entry steps,
lunged through revolving doors into a large marble corridor that
was redolent with vibrating waves of hot steamy air, wet rubbers
and galoshes, sanitary disinfectant and serviceable but somewhat
old-fashioned elevators and, entering one of the cars which had
just plunged down abruptly, banged open its door, belched out two
or three people and swallowed a dozen more, he was finally
deposited with the same abruptness on the seventh floor, where he
stepped out into a wide dark corridor, squinted and grimaced
uncertainly to right and left as he had done for twenty-five
years, and then went left along the corridor, past rows of
lighted offices in which one could hear the preliminary clicking
of typewriters, the rattling of crisp papers, and the sounds of
people beginning their day's work. At the end of the corridor
Bascom Pentland turned right along another corridor and at length
paused before a door which bore this inscription across the
familiar glazed glass of American business offices: "The John T.
Brill Realty Co.--Houses For Rent or Sale." Below this bold
legend in much smaller letters was printed: "Bascom
Pentland--Att'y at Law--Conveyancer and Title Expert."</p>

<p>The appearance of this strange figure in State Street, or
anywhere else, had always been sufficient to attract attention
and to draw comment. Bascom Pentland, if he had straightened to
his full height, would have been six feet and three or four
inches tall, but he had always walked with a stoop and as he grew
older the stoop had become confirmed: he presented a tall,
gnarled, bony figure, cadaverous and stringy, but tough as
hickory. He was of that race of men who seem never to wear out,
or to grow old, or to die: they live with almost undiminished
vitality to great ages, and when they die they die suddenly.
There is no slow wastage and decay because there is so little to
waste or decay: their mummied and stringy flesh has the
durability of granite.</p>

<p>Bascom Pentland clothed his angular figure with an assortment
of odd garments which seemed to have the same durability: they
were immensely old and worn, but they also gave no signs of ever
wearing out, for by their cut and general appearance of age, it
seemed that his frugal soul had selected in the 'nineties
materials which it hoped would last for ever. His coat, which was
originally of a dark dull pepper-and-salt grey, had gone green at
the seams and pockets, and moreover it was a ridiculously short
skimpy coat for a gaunt big-boned man like this: it was hardly
more than a jacket, his great wristy hands burst out of it like
lengths of cordwood, and the mark of his high-humped narrow
shoulders cut into it with a knife-like sharpness. His trousers
were also tight and skimpy, of a lighter grey and of a rough
woolly texture from which all fuzz and fluff had long ago been
rubbed; he wore rough country brogans with raw-hide laces, and a
funny little flat hat of ancient black felt, which had also gone
green along the band. One understands now why the policeman
called him "Bud": this great bony figure seemed ruthlessly to
have been crammed into garments in which a country fledgling of
the 'eighties might have gone to see his girl, clutching a bag of
gumdrops in his large red hand. A stringy little neck-tie, a
clean but dilapidated collar which by its bluish and softly
mottled look Bascom Pentland must have laundered himself (a
presumption which is quite correct since the old man did all his
own laundry work, as well as his mending, repairing, and
cobbling)--this was his costume, winter and summer, and it never
changed, save that in winter he supplemented it with an ancient
blue sweater which he wore buttoned to the chin and whose frayed
ends and cuffs projected inches below the scanty little jacket.
He had never been known to wear an overcoat, not even on the
coldest days of those long, raw, and formidable winters from
which Boston suffers.</p>

<p>The mark of his madness was plain upon him: intuitively men
knew he was not a poor man, and the people who had seen him so
many times in State Street would nudge one another, saying: "You
see that old guy? You'd think he was waitin' for a hand-out from
the Salvation Army, wouldn't you? Well, he's not. He's <i>got</i>
it, brother. Believe me, he's <i>got</i> it good and plenty: he's
<i>got</i> it salted away where no one ain't goin' to touch it.
That guy's got a sock full of dough!"</p>

<p>"Jesus!" another remarks. "What good's it goin' to do an old
guy like that? He can't take any of it with him, can he?"</p>

<p>"You said it, brother," and the conversation would become
philosophical.</p>

<p>Bascom Pentland was himself conscious of his parsimony, and
although he sometimes asserted that he was "only a poor man," he
realized that his exaggerated economies could not be justified to
his business associates on account of poverty: they taunted him
slyly, saying, "Come on, Pentland, let's go to lunch. You can get
a good meal at the Pahkeh House for a couple of bucks." Or: "Say,
Pentland, I know a place where they're havin' a sale of winter
overcoats: I saw one there that would just suit you--you can get
it for sixty dollars." Or: "Do you need a good laundry, Reverend?
I know a couple of Chinks who do good work."</p>

<p>To which Bascom, with the characteristic evasiveness of
parsimony, would reply, snuffling derisively down his nose: "No,
sir! You won't catch me in any of their stinking restaurants. You
never know what you're getting: if you could see the dirty,
nasty, filthy kitchens where your food is prepared you'd lose
your appetite quick enough." His parsimony had resulted in a
compensating food mania: he declared that "in his young days" he
"ruined his digestion by eating in restaurants," he painted the
most revolting pictures of the filth of these establishments,
laughing scornfully down his nose as he declared: "I suppose you
think it tastes better after some dirty, nasty, stinking
<i>nigger</i> has wiped his old hands all over it"
(phuh-phuh-phuh-phuh-phuh!)--here he would contort his face and
snuffle scornfully down his nose; and he was bitter in his
denunciation of "rich foods," declaring they had "destroyed more
lives than all the wars and all the armies since the beginning of
time."</p>

<p>As he had grown older he had become more and more convinced of
the healthy purity of "raw foods," and he prepared for himself at
home raw revolting messes of chopped-up carrots, onions, turnips,
even raw potatoes, which he devoured at table, smacking his lips
with an air of keen relish, and declaring to his wife: "You may
poison <i>yourself</i> on your old roasts and oysters and turkeys
if you please: you wouldn't catch <i>me</i> eating that stuff.
No, sir! Not on your life! I think too much of my stomach!" But
his use of the pronoun "you" was here universal rather than
particular, because if that lady's longevity had depended on her
abstinence from "roasts and oysters and turkeys" there was no
reason why she should not have lived for ever.</p>

<p>Or again, if it were a matter of clothing, a matter of fencing
in his bones and tallows against the frozen nail of Boston
winter, he would howl derisively: "An overcoat! Not on your life!
I wouldn't give two cents for all the old overcoats in the world!
The only thing they're good for is to gather up germs and give
you colds and pneumonia. I haven't worn an overcoat in thirty
years, and I've never had the <i>vestige</i>--no! not the
<i>semblance</i>--of a cold during all that time!"--an assertion
that was not strictly accurate, since he always complained
bitterly of at least two or three during the course of a single
winter, declaring at those times that no more hateful,
treacherous, damnable climate than that of Boston had ever been
known.</p>

<p>Similarly, if it were a question of laundries he would
scornfully declare that he would not send <i>"his</i> shirts and
collars to let some dirty old Chinaman spit and <i>hock</i> upon
them--<i>yes!"</i> he would gleefully howl, as some new
abomination of nastiness suggested itself to his teeming
brain--<i>"yes</i>! and iron it <i>in,</i> too, so you can walk
around done up in old Chinaman's
spit!"--(Phuh-phuh-phuh-phuh-phuh!)--here he would grimace,
contort his rubbery lip, and laugh down his nose in forced snarls
of gratification and triumph.</p>

<p>This was the old man who, even now, as his nephew sped to meet
him, stood in his dusty little office clutching his raw and bony
hands across his waist.</p>

<p>In spite of the bewildering elaboration of his uncle's
direction, the boy found his offices without much trouble. He
went in and a moment later, his hand was being vigorously pumped
by his uncle's great stiff paw, and he heard that instant howling
voice of welcome--the voice of a prophet calling from the
mountain-tops--coming to him without preliminary or introduction,
as he had heard it last eight years before.</p>

<p>"Oh, hello, hello, hello. . . . How are you, how are you, how
are you? . . . Say!" his uncle turned abruptly and in a high
howling tone addressed several people who were staring at the
young man curiously, "I want you all to meet my sister's youngest
son--my nephew, Mr. Eugene Gant . . . and say!" he bawled again,
but in remoter tone, in a strangely confiding and insinuating
tone--"would you know he was a Pentland by the look of him? . . .
Can you see the family resemblance?" He smacked his rubbery lips
together with an air of relish, and suddenly threw his great
gaunt arms up and let them fall with an air of ecstatic
jubilation, squinted his small sharp eyes together, contorted his
rubbery lips in their amazing and grotesque grimace, and stamping
ecstatically at the floor with one long stringy leg, taking
random ecstatic kicks at any object that was within reach, he
began to snuffle with his strange forced laughter, and howled
deliriously, "Oh, <i>my,</i> yes! . . . The thing is evident. . .
. He is a Pentland beyond the shadow of a vestige of a doubt! . .
. Oh, by all means, by all means, by all means!" and he went on
snuffling, stamping, howling, and kicking at random objects in
this way until the strange seizure of his mirth had somewhat
subsided. Then, more quietly, he introduced his nephew to his
associates in the curious business of which he was a partner.</p>

<p>And it was in this way that the boy first met the people in
his uncle's office--an office and people who were, during the
years that followed, and in the course of hundreds of visits, to
become a part of the fabric of his life--so hauntingly real, so
strangely familiar that in the years that followed he could
forget none of them, remember everything just as it was.</p>

<p>These offices, which he saw for the first time that day, were
composed of two rooms, one in front and one behind, L-shaped, and
set in the elbow of the building, so that one might look out at
the two projecting wings of the building and see lighted layers
of offices, in which the actors of a dozen enterprises "took"
dictation, clattered at typewriters, walked back and forth
importantly, talked into telephones or, what they did with
amazing frequency, folded their palms behind their skulls, placed
their feet restfully on the nearest solid object, and gazed for
long periods dreamily and tenderly at the ceilings.</p>

<p>Through the broad and usually very dirty panes of the window
in the front office one could catch a glimpse of Faneuil Hall and
the magnificent and exultant activity of the markets.</p>

<p>These dingy offices, however, from which a corner of this rich
movement might be seen and felt, were merely the unlovely
counterpart of millions of others throughout the country and, in
the telling phrase of Baedeker, offered "little that need detain
the tourist": a few chairs, two scarred roll-top desks, a
typist's table, a battered safe with a pile of thumb-worn ledgers
on top of it, a set of green filing cases, an enormous green,
greasy water-jar always half filled with a rusty liquid that no
one drank, and two spittoons, put there because Brill was a man
who chewed and spat widely in all directions--this, save for
placards, each bearing several photographs of houses with their
prices written below them--8 rooms, Dorchester, $6500; 5 rooms
and garage, Melrose, $4500, etc.--completed the furniture of the
room, and the second room, save for the disposition of objects,
was similarly adorned.</p>

<p>Such, then, was the scene in which the old man and his nephew
met again after a separation of eight years.</p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h1>X</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>The youth was drowned in the deepest sea--an atom bombarded,
ignorant of all defence in a tumultuous world. The shell of
custom, the easy thoughtless life which had sucked pleasure from
the world about, these four years past, crumbled like caked mud.
He was nothing, nobody--there was no heart or bravery left in
him; he was conscious of unfathomable ignorance--the beginning,
as Socrates suggested, of wisdom--he was lost.</p>

<p>He had wanted to cut a figure in the world--he had simply
never imagined the number of people that were in it. And like
most people who hug loneliness to them like a lover, the need of
occasional companionship, for ever tender and for ever true,
which might be summoned or dismissed at will, cut through him
like a sword.</p>

<p>There was, of course, among the members of the play-writing
class an energetic and calculated sociability. The supposed
advantages of discussion with one another, the interplay of wit,
and so on, above all what was called "the exchange of ideas," but
what most often was merely the exchange of other people's
ideas,--all these were mentioned often; they were held in the
highest esteem as one of the chief benefits to be derived from
the course.</p>

<p>Manifestly, one could write anywhere. But where else could one
write with around one the constant stimulus of other people who
also wrote? Where could one learn one's faults so well as before
a critical and serious congress of artists? They were content
with it--they got what they wanted. But the lack of warmth, the
absence of inner radial heat which, not being fundamental in the
structure of their lives, had never been wanted, filled him with
horror and impotent fury.</p>

<p>The critical sense had stirred in him hardly at all, the idea
of questioning authority and position had not occurred to
him.</p>

<p>He was facing one of the oldest--what, for the creative mind,
must be one of the most painful--problems of the spirit--the
search for a standard of taste. He had, at seventeen, as a
sophomore, triumphantly denied God, but he was unable now to deny
Robert Browning. It had never occurred to him that there was a
single authoritatively beautiful thing in the world that might
not be agreed on, by a community of all the enlightened spirits
of the universe, as beautiful. <i>Everyone,</i> of course,
<i>knew</i> that <i>King Lear</i> was one of the greatest plays
that had ever been written. Only, he was beginning to find
everyone didn't.</p>

<p>And now for the first time he began to worry about being
"modern." He had the great fear young people have that they will
not be a part of the most advanced literary and artistic
movements of the time. Several of the young men he knew had
contributed stories, poems, and criticisms to little reviews,
published by and for small groups of literary adepts. They
disposed of most of the established figures with a few
well-chosen words of contempt, and they replaced these figures
with obscure names of their own who, they assured him, were the
important people of the future.</p>

<p>For the first time, he heard the word "Mid-Victorian" applied
as a term of opprobrium. What its implications were he had no
idea. Stevenson, too, to him hardly more than a writer of books
for boys, books that he had read as a child with interest and
delight, was a symbol of some vague but monstrously pernicious
influence.</p>

<p>But he discovered at once that to voice any of these
questionings was to brand oneself in the esteem of the group;
intuitively he saw that their jargon formed a pattern by which
they might be placed and recognized; that, to young men most of
all, to be placed in a previous discarded pattern was unendurable
disgrace. It represented to them the mark of intellectual
development, just as in a sophomore's philosophy the belief that
God is an old man with a long beard brings ridicule and odium
upon the believer but the belief that God is an ocean without
limit, or an all-pervasive and inclusive substance, or some other
equally na&iuml;ve and extraordinary idea, is regarded as a
certain sign of bold enlightenment. Thus it often happens, when
one thinks he has extended the limits of his life, broken the
bonds, and liberated himself in the wider ether, he has done no
more than to exchange a new superstition for an old one, to
forsake a beautiful myth for an ugly one.</p>

<p>The young men in Professor Hatcher's class were sorry for many
things and many people.</p>

<p>"Barrie?" began Mr. Scoville, an elegant and wealthy young
dawdler from Philadelphia, who, by his own confession, had spent
most of his life in France, "Barrie?" he continued regretfully,
in answer to a question. For a moment, he drew deeply on his
cigarette, then raised sad, languid eyes. "I'm sorry," he said
gently, with a slight regretful movement of his head--"I can't
read him. I've tried it--but it simply can't be done." They
laughed, greatly pleased.</p>

<p>"But it is a pity, you know, a <i>great</i> pity," Francis
Starwick remarked languidly, using effectively his trick of
giving a tired emphasis to certain words which conveyed a kind of
sad finality, a weary earnestness to what he said. He turned to
go.</p>

<p>"But--but--but--how--how--how very interesting! Why <i>is</i>
it, Frank?" Hugh Dodd demanded with his earnest stammering
eagerness. He was profoundly respectful of Starwick's critical
ability.</p>

<p>"Why is what?" said Starwick in his curiously mannered voice,
his air of languid weariness.</p>

<p>"Why is it a great pity about Barrie?" knitting his bushy
brows together, and scowling with an air of intense concentration
over his words as he spoke. "Because," said the appraiser of
Values, as he prepared to depart, arranging with feminine
luxuriousness the voluptuous folds of his blue silk scarf, "the
man really had something one time. He really did. Something
strange and haunting--the genius of the Celt." Swinging his cane
slowly, acutely and painfully conscious that he was being
watched, with the agonizing stiffness that was at the bottom of
his character, he strolled off across the Yard, stark and lovely
with the harsh white snow and wintry branches of bleak
winter.</p>

<p>"You know--you know--you know--that's very interesting," said
Dodd, intent upon his words. "I'd--I'd--I'd never thought of it
in <i>just</i> that way."</p>

<p>"Barrie," drawled Wood, the maker of epigrams, "is a stick of
taffy, floating upon a sea of molasses."</p>

<p>There was laughter.</p>

<p>He was for ever making these epigrams; his face had a somewhat
saturnine cast, his lips twisted ironically, his eyes shot
splintered promises of satiric wisdom. He looked like a very
caustically humorous person; but unhappily he had no humour. But
they thought he had. No one with a face like that could be less
than keen.</p>

<p>So he had something to say for every occasion. He had
discovered that the manner counted for wit. If the talk was of
Shaw's deficiencies as a dramatist, he might say:</p>

<p>"But, after all, if one is going in for all that sort of
thing, why not have lantern slides and a course of lectures?"</p>

<p>Thus he was known, not merely as a subtle-souled and elusive
psychologist but also as a biting wit.</p>

<p>"Galsworthy wrote something that looked like a play once,"
someone remarked. "There were parts of <i>Justice</i> that
weren't bad."</p>

<p>"Yes. Yes," said Dodd, peering intently at his language.
<i>"Justice</i>--there were some interesting things in that.
It's--it's--it's rather a <i>pity</i> about him, isn't it?" And
as he said these words he frowned earnestly and intently. There
was genuine pity in his voice, for the man's spirit had great
charity and sweetness in it.</p>

<p>As they dispersed, someone remarked that Shaw might have made
a dramatist if he had ever known anything about writing a
play.</p>

<p>"But he <i>dates</i> so--how he <i>dates!"</i> Scoville

<p> </p>

<p>To reach his own "office," as Bascom Pentland called the tiny
cubicle in which he worked and received his clients, the old man
had to traverse the inner room and open a door in a flimsy
partition of varnished wood and glazed glass at the other end.
This was his office: it was really a very narrow slice cut off
from the larger room, and in it there was barely space for one
large dirty window, an ancient dilapidated desk and swivel chair,
a very small battered safe buried under stacks of yellowed
newspapers, and a small bookcase with glass doors and two small
shelves on which there were a few worn volumes. An inspection of
these books would have revealed four or five tattered and musty
law books in their ponderous calf-skin bindings--one on
<i>Contracts,</i> one on <i>Real Property,</i> one on
<i>Titles</i>--a two-volume edition of the poems of Matthew
Arnold, very dog-eared and thumbed over; a copy of <i>Sartor
Resartus,</i> also much used; a volume of the essays of Ralph
Waldo Emerson; the Iliad in Greek with minute yellowed notations
in the margins; a volume of the <i>World Almanac</i> several
years old; and a very worn volume of the Holy Bible, greatly used
and annotated in Bascom's small, stiffly laborious, and
meticulous hand.</p>

<p>If the old man was a little late, as sometimes happened, he
might find his colleagues there before him. Miss Muriel Brill,
the typist, and the eldest daughter of Mr. John T. Brill, would
be seated in her typist's chair, her heavy legs crossed as she
bent over to undo the metal latches of the thick galoshes she
wore during the winter season. It is true there were also other
seasons when Miss Brill did not wear galoshes, but so sharply and
strongly do our memories connect people with certain gestures
which, often for an inscrutable reason, seem characteristic of
them, that any frequent visitor to these offices at this time of
day would doubtless have remembered Miss Brill as always
unfastening her galoshes. But the probable reason is that some
people inevitably belong to seasons, and this girl's season was
winter--not blizzards or howling winds, or the blind skirl and
sweep of snow, but grey, grim, raw, thick, implacable winter: the
endless successions of grey days and grey monotony. There was no
spark of colour in her, her body was somewhat thick and heavy,
her face was white, dull, and thick-featured and instead of
tapering downwards, it tapered up: it was small above, and thick
and heavy below, and even in her speech, the words she uttered
seemed to have been chosen by an automaton, and could only be
remembered later by their desolate banality. One always
remembered her as saying as one entered: ". . . Hello! . . .
You're becoming quite a strangeh! . . . It's been some time since
you was around, hasn't it? . . . I was thinkin' the otheh day it
had been some time since you was around. . . . I'd begun to think
you had forgotten us. . . . Well, how've you been? Lookin' the
same as usual, I see. . . . Me? . . . Oh, can't complain. . . .
Keepin' busy? <i>I'll</i> say! I manage to keep goin'. . . . Who
you lookin' for? Father? He's in <i>there. . . .</i> Why, yeah!
Go right on in."</p>

<p>This was Miss Brill, and at the moment that she bent to
unfasten her galoshes, it is likely that Mr. Samuel Friedman
would also be there in the act of rubbing his small dry hands
briskly together, or of rubbing the back of one hand with the
palm of the other in order to induce circulation. He was a small
youngish man, a pale somewhat meagre-looking little Jew with a
sharp ferret face: he, too, was a person who goes to "fill in"
those vast swarming masses of people along the pavements and in
the subway--the mind cannot remember them or absorb the details
of their individual appearance, but they people the earth, they
make up life. Mr. Friedman had none of the richness, colour, and
humour that some members of his race so abundantly possess; the
succession of grey days, the grim weather seemed to have entered
his soul as it enters the souls of many different races
there--the Irish, the older New England stock, even the Jews--and
it gives them a common touch that is prim, drab, careful, tight
and sour. Mr. Friedman also wore galoshes, his clothes were neat,
drab, a little worn and shiny, there was an odour of thawing
dampness and warm rubber about him as he rubbed his dry little
hands saying: "Chee! How I hated to leave that good wahm bed this
morning! When I got up I said, <i>'Holy</i> Chee!' My wife says,
'Whatsa mattah?' I says, 'Holy Chee! You step out heah a moment
where I am an' you'll see whatsa mattah.' 'Is it cold?' she says.
'Is it cold! I'll tell the cock-eyed wuhld!' I says. Chee! You
could have cut the frost with an axe: the wateh in the pitchehs
was frozen hahd; an' she has the nuhve to ask me if it's cold! Is
it cold!' I says. 'Do you know any more funny stories?' I says.
Oh, how I do love my bed! Chee! I kept thinkin' of that guy in
Braintree I got to go see today an' the more I thought about him,
the less I liked him! I thought my feet would tu'n into two
blocks of ice before I got the funniss stahted! 'Chee! I hope the
ole bus is still workin',' I says. If I've got to go thaw that
damned thing out,' I says, 'I'm ready to quit.' Chee! Well, suh,
I neveh had a bit of trouble: she stahted right up an' the way
that ole moteh was workin' is nobody's business."</p>

<p>During the course of this monologue Miss Brill would give ear
and assent from time to time by the simple interjection: "Uh!" It
was a sound she uttered frequently, it had somewhat the same
meaning as "Yes," but it was more non-committal than "Yes." It
seemed to render assent to the speaker, to let him know that he
was being heard and understood, but it did not commit the auditor
to any opinion, or to any real agreement.</p>

<p>The third member of this office staff, who was likely to be
present at this time, was a gentleman named Stanley P. Ward. Mr.
Stanley P. Ward was a neat middling figure of a man, aged fifty
or thereabouts; he was plump and had a pink tender skin, a trim
Vandyke, and a nice comfortable little pot of a belly which
slipped snugly into the well-pressed and well-brushed garments
that always fitted him so tidily. He was a bit of a fop, and it
was at once evident that he was quietly but enormously pleased
with himself. He carried himself very sprucely, he took short
rapid steps and his neat little paunch gave his figure a movement
not unlike that of a pouter pigeon. He was usually in quiet but
excellent spirits, he laughed frequently and a smile--rather a
subtly amused look--was generally playing about the edges of his
mouth. That smile and his laugh made some people vaguely
uncomfortable: there was a kind of deliberate falseness in them,
as if what he really thought and felt was not to be shared with
other men. He seemed, in fact, to have discovered some vital and
secret power, some superior knowledge and wisdom, from which the
rest of mankind was excluded, a sense that he was "chosen" above
other men, and this impression of Mr. Stanley Ward would have
been correct, for he was a Christian Scientist, he was a pillar
of the Church, and a very big Church at that--for Mr. Ward,
dressed in fashionable striped trousers, rubber soles, and a
cut-away coat, might be found somewhere under the mighty dome of
the Mother Church on Huntingdon Avenue every Sunday suavely,
noiselessly, and expertly ushering the faithful to their
pews.</p>

<p>This completes the personnel of the first office of the John
T. Brill Realty Company, and if Bascom Pentland arrived late, if
these three people were already present, if Mr. Bascom Pentland
had not been defrauded of any part of his worldly goods by some
contriving rascal of whom the world has many, if his life had not
been imperilled by some speed maniac, if the damnable New England
weather was not too damnable, if, in short, Bascom Pentland was
in fairly good spirits he would on entering immediately howl in a
high, rapid, remote and perfectly monotonous tone: "Hello, Hello,
Hello! Good morning, Good morning, Good-morning!"--after which he
would close his eyes, grimace horribly, press his rubbery lip
against his big horse-teeth, and snuffle with laughter through
his nose, as if pleased by a tremendous stroke of wit. At this
demonstration the other members of the group would glance at one
another with those knowing, subtly supercilious nods and winks,
that look of common self-congratulation and humour with which the
more "normal" members of society greet the conduct of an
eccentric, and Mr. Samuel Friedman would say: "What's the mattah
with you, Pop? You look happy. Some one musta give you a shot in
the ahm."</p>

<p>At which, a course powerful voice, deliberate and rich with
its intimation of immense and earthy vulgarity, might roar out of
the depth of the inner office: "No, I'll tell you what it is."
Here the great figure of Mr. John T. Brill, the head of the
business, would darken the doorway. "Don't you know what's wrong
with the Reverend? It's that widder he's been takin' around."
Here, the phlegmy burble that prefaced all of Mr. Brill's
obscenities would appear in his voice, the shadow of a lewd smile
would play around the corner of his mouth: "It's the widder.
She's let him have a little of it."</p>

<p>At this delicate stroke of humour, the burble would burst open
in Mr. Brill's great red throat, and he would roar with that
high, choking, phlegmy laughter that is frequent among big
red-faced men. Mr. Friedman would laugh drily ("Heh, heh, heh,
heh, heh!"), Mr. Stanley Ward would laugh more heartily, but
complacently, and Miss Brill would snicker in a coy and subdued
manner as became a modest young girl. As for Bascom Pentland, if
he was really in a good humour, he might snuffle with nosy
laughter, bend double at his meagre waist, clutching his big
hands together, and stamp at the floor violently several times
with one stringy leg; he might even go so far as to take a random
ecstatic kick at objects, still stamping and snuffling with
laughter, and prod Miss Brill stiffly with two enormous bony
fingers, as if he did not wish the full point and flavour of the
jest to be lost on her.</p>

<p>Bascom Pentland, however, was a very complicated person with
many moods, and if Mr. Brill's fooling did not catch him in a
receptive one, he might contort his face in a pucker of refined
disgust, and mutter his disapproval, as he shook his head rapidly
from side to side. Or he might rise to great heights of moral
denunciation, beginning at first in a grave low voice that showed
the seriousness of the words he had to utter: "The lady to whom
you refer," he would begin, "the very charming and cultivated
lady whose name, sir"--here his voice would rise on its howling
note and he would wag his great bony forefinger--"whose name,
sir, you have so foully traduced and blackened--"</p>

<p>"No, I wasn't, Reverend. I was only tryin' to whiten it," said
Mr. Brill, beginning to burble with laughter.</p>

<p>"--Whose name, sir, you have so foully traduced and blackened
with your smutty suggestions," Bascom continued implacably,
"--that lady is known to me, as you very well know, sir," he
howled, wagging his great finger again, "solely and simply in a
professional capacity."</p>

<p>"Why, hell, Reverend," said Mr. Brill innocently, "I never
knew she was a perfessional. I thought she was an amatoor."</p>

<p>At this conclusive stroke, Mr. Brill would make the whole
place tremble with his laughter, Mr. Friedman would laugh almost
noiselessly, holding himself weakly at the stomach and bending
across a desk, Mr. Ward would have short bursts and fits of
laughter, as he gazed out the window, shaking his head
deprecatingly from time to time, as if his more serious nature
disapproved, and Miss Brill would snicker, and turn to her
machine, remarking: "This conversation is getting too rough for
me!"</p>

<p>And Bascom, if this jesting touched his complex soul at one of
those moments when such profanity shocked him, would walk away,
confiding into vacancy, it seemed, with his powerful and mobile
features contorted in the most eloquent expression of disgust and
loathing ever seen on any face, the while he muttered, in a
resonant whisper that shuddered with passionate revulsion: "Oh,
<i>bad!</i> Oh, <i>bad</i>! Oh, <i>bad! bad! bad!"</i>--shaking
his head slightly from side to side with each word.</p>

<p>Yet there were other times, when Brill's swingeing vulgarity,
the vast coarse sweep of his profanity not only found Uncle
Bascom in a completely receptive mood, but evoked from him
gleeful responses, counter-essays in swearing which he made
slyly, craftily, snickering with pleasure and squinting around at
his listeners at the sound of the words, and getting such
stimulus from them as might a renegade clergyman exulting in a
feeling of depravity and abandonment for the first time.</p>

<p>To the other people in this office--that is, to Friedman,
Ward, and Muriel, the stenographer--the old man was always an
enigma; at first they had observed his peculiarities of speech
and dress, his eccentricity of manner, and the sudden, violent,
and complicated fluctuation of his temperament, with astonishment
and wonder, then with laughter and ridicule, and now, with dull,
uncomprehending acceptance. Nothing he did or said surprised them
any more, they had no understanding and little curiosity, they
accepted him as a fact in the grey schedule of their lives. Their
relation to him was habitually touched by a kind of patronizing
banter--"kidding the old boy along," they would have called
it--by the communication of smug superior winks and the
conspiracy of feeble jests. And in this there was something base
and ignoble, for Bascom was a better man than any of them.</p>

<p>He did not notice any of this, it is not likely he would have
cared if he had, for, like most eccentrics, his thoughts were
usually buried in a world of his own creating to whose every fact
and feeling and motion he was the central actor. Again, as much
as any of his extraordinary family, he had carried with him
throughout his life the sense that he was "fated"--a sense that
was strong in all of them--that his life was pivotal to all the
actions of providence, that, in short, the time might be out of
joint, but not himself. Nothing but death could shake his
powerful egotism, and his occasional storms of fury, his railing
at the world, his tirades of invective at some motorist,
pedestrian, or labourer occurred only when he discovered that
these people were moving in a world at cross-purposes to his own
and that some action of theirs had disturbed or shaken the logic
of his universe.</p>

<p>It was curious that, of all the people in the office, the
person who had the deepest understanding and respect for him was
John T. Brill. Mr. Brill was a huge creature of elemental desires
and passions: a river of profanity rushed from his mouth with the
relentless sweep and surge of the Mississippi, he could no more
have spoken without swearing than a whale could swim in a
frog-pond--he swore at everything, at everyone, and with every
breath, casually and unconsciously, and yet when he addressed
Bascom his oath was always impersonal and tinged subtly by a
feeling of respect.</p>

<p>Thus, he would speak to Uncle Bascom somewhat in this fashion:
"God-damn it, Pentland, did you ever look up the title for that
stuff in Maiden? That feller's been callin' up every day to find
out about it."</p>

<p>"Which fellow?" Bascom asked precisely. "The man from
Cambridge?'"</p>

<p>"No," said Mr. Brill, "not him, the other son of a bitch, the
Dorchester feller. How the hell am I goin' to tell him anything
if there's no goddamn title for the stuff?"</p>

<p>Profane and typical as this speech was, it was always shaded
nicely with impersonality toward Bascom--conscious to the full of
the distinction between "damn <i>it</i>" and "damn <i>you."</i>
Toward his other colleagues, however, Mr. Brill was neither nice
nor delicate.</p>

<p>Brill was an enormous man physically: he was six feet two or
three inches tall, and his weight was close to three hundred
pounds. He was totally bald, his skull was a gleaming satiny
pink; above his great red moon of face, with its ponderous and
pendulous jowls, it looked almost egg-shaped. And in the heavy,
deliberate, and powerful timbre of his voice there was always
lurking this burble of exultant, gargantuan obscenity: it was so
obviously part of the structure of his life, so obviously his
only and natural means of expression, that it was impossible to
condemn him. His epithet was limited and repetitive--but so, too,
was Homer's, and, like Homer, he saw no reason for changing what
had already been used and found good.</p>

<p>He was a lewd and innocent man. Like Bascom, by comparison
with these other people, he seemed to belong to some earlier,
richer and grander period of the earth, and perhaps this was why
there was more actual kinship and understanding between them than
between any of the other members of the office. These other
people--Friedman, Brill's daughter Muriel, and Ward--belonged to
the myriads of the earth, to those numberless swarms that with
ceaseless pullulation fill the streets of life with their grey
immemorable tides. But Brill and Bascom were men in a thousand, a
million: if one had seen them in a crowd he would have looked
after them, if one had talked with them, he could never have
forgotten them.</p>

<p>It is rare in modern life that one sees a man who can express
himself with such complete and abundant certainty as Brill
did--completely and without doubt or confusion. It is true that
his life expressed itself chiefly by three gestures--by
profanity, by his great roar of full-throated, earth-shaking
laughter, and by flatulence, an explosive comment on existence
which usually concluded and summarized his other means of
expression.</p>

<p>Although the other people in the office laughed heartily at
this soaring rhetoric of obscenity, it sometimes proved too much
for Uncle Bascom. When this happened he would either leave the
office immediately or stump furiously into his own little
cupboard that seemed silted over with the dust of twenty years,
slamming the door behind him so violently that the thin partition
rattled, and then stand for a moment pursing his lips, and
convolving his features with incredible speed, and shaking his
gaunt head slightly from side to side, until at length he
whispered in a tone of passionate disgust and revulsion: "Oh,
<i>bad! Bad! Bad!</i> By every <i>gesture!</i> by every
<i>act!</i> he betrays the <i>boor,</i> the <i>vulgarian!</i> Can
you imagine"--here his voice sank even lower in its scale of
passionate whispering repugnance--"can you for one <i>moment</i>
imagine a man of <i>breeding</i> and the social graces breaking
wind publicly?--And before his own daughter. Oh, <i>bad! Bad!
Bad! Bad!"</i></p>

<p>And in the silence, while Uncle Bascom stood shaking his head
in its movement of downcast and convulsive distaste, they could
hear, suddenly, the ripping noise Brill would make as his pungent
answer to all the world--and his great bellow of throaty
laughter. Later on, if Bascom had to consult him on any business,
he would open his door abruptly, walk out into Brill's office
clutching his hands together at his waist, and with disgust still
carved upon his face, say: "Well, sir. . . . If you have
concluded your morning devotions," here his voice sank to a
bitter snarl, "we might get down to the transaction of some of
the day's business."</p>

<p>"Why, Reverend!" Brill roared. "You ain't heard nothin'
yet!"</p>

<p>And the great choking bellow of laughter would burst from him
again, rattling the windows with its power as he hurled his great
weight backward, with complete abandon, in his creaking
swivel-chair.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>It was obvious that he liked to tease the old man, and never
lost an opportunity of doing so: for example, if anyone gave
Uncle Bascom a cigar, Brill would exclaim with an air of innocent
surprise: "Why, <i>Reverend,</i> you're not going to smoke that,
are you?"</p>

<p>"Why, certainly," Bascom said tartly. "That is the purpose for
which it was intended, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes," said Brill, "but you know how they make 'em, don't
you? I didn't think you'd touch it after some dirty old Spaniard
has wiped his old hands all over it--yes! an' <i>spit</i> upon
it, too, because that's what they do!"</p>

<p>"Ah!" Bascom snarled contemptuously. "You don't know what
you're talking about! There is nothing cleaner than good tobacco!
Finest and healthiest plant on earth! No question about it!"</p>

<p>"Well," said Brill, "I've learned something. We live and
learn, Reverend. You've taught me somethin' worth knowing: when
it's free it's clean; when you have to pay for it it stinks like
hell!" He pondered heavily for a moment, and the burble began to
play about in his great throat: "And by God!" he concluded,
"tobacco's not the only thing that applies to, either. Not by a
damned sight!"</p>

<p>Again, one morning when his nephew was there, Bascom cleared
his throat portentously, coughed, and suddenly said to him: "Now,
Eugene, my boy, you are going to have lunch with me today.
There's no question about it whatever!" This was astonishing
news, for he had never before invited the youth to eat with him
when he came to his office, although the boy had been to his
house for dinner many times. "Yes, sir!" said Bascom, with an air
of conviction and satisfaction. "I have thought it all over.
There is a splendid establishment in the basement of this
building--small, of course, but everything clean and of the
highest order! It is conducted by an Irish gentleman whom I have
known for many years. Finest people on earth: no question about
it!"</p>

<p>It was an astonishing and momentous occasion; the boy knew how
infrequently he went to a restaurant. Having made his decision,
Uncle Bascom immediately stepped into the outer offices and began
to discuss and publish his intentions with the greatest
satisfaction.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir!" he said in a precise tone, smacking his lips in a
ruminant fashion, and addressing himself to everyone rather than
to a particular person. "We shall go in and take our seats in the
regular way, and I shall then give appropriate instructions to
one of the attendants--" again he smacked his lips as he
pronounced this word with such an indescribable air of relish
that immediately the boy's mouth began to water, and the
delicious pangs of appetite and hunger began to gnaw his
vitals--"I shall say: 'This is my nephew, a young man now
enrolled at Harvard Un-i-ver-sit-tee!'"--here Bascom smacked his
lips together again with that same maddening air of
relish--"'Yes, sir' (I shall say!)--'You are to fulfil his order
without <i>stint,</i> without <i>delay,</i> and without
<i>question,</i> and to the <i>utmost</i> of your ability'"--he
howled, wagging his great bony forefinger through the air--"As
for myself," he declared abruptly, "I shall take nothing. Good
Lord, no!" he said with a scornful laugh. "I wouldn't touch a
thing they had to offer. You couldn't pay me to: I shouldn't
sleep for a month if I did. But you, my boy!" he howled, turning
suddenly upon his nephew, "--are to have everything your heart
desires! Everything, everything, everything!" He made an
inclusive gesture with his long arms; then closed his eyes,
stamped at the floor, and began to snuffle with laughter.</p>

<p>Mr. Brill had listened to all this with his great-jowled face
slack-jawed and agape with astonishment. Now, he said heavily:
"He's goin' to have everything, is he? Where are you goin' to
take him to git it?"</p>

<p>"Why, sir!" Bascom said in an annoyed tone, "I have told you
all along--we are going to the modest but excellent establishment
in the basement of this very building."</p>

<p>"Why, Reverend," Brill said in a protesting tone, "you ain't
goin' to take your nephew <i>there,</i> are you? I thought you
said you was goin' to git somethin' to <i>eat."</i></p>

<p>"I had supposed," Bascom said with bitter sarcasm, "that one
went there for that purpose. I had not supposed that one went
there to get shaved."</p>

<p>"Well," said Brill, "if you go there you'll git shaved, all
right. You'll not only git <i>shaved,</i> you'll git
<i>skinned</i> alive. But you won't git anything to eat." And he
hurled himself back again, roaring with laughter.</p>

<p>"Pay no attention to him!" Bascom said to the boy in a tone of
bitter repugnance. "I have long known that his low and vulgar
mind attempts to make a joke of everything, even the most sacred
matters. I assure you, my boy, the place is excellent in every
way:--do you suppose," he said now, addressing Brill and all the
others, with a howl of fury--"do you suppose, if it were not,
that I should for a single moment <i>dream</i> of taking him
there? Do you suppose that I would for an instant
<i>contemplate</i> taking my own nephew, my sister's son, to any
place in which I did not repose the fullest confidence? Not on
your life!" he howled. "Not on your life!"</p>

<p>And they departed, followed by Brill's great bellow, and a
farewell invitation which he shouted after the young man. "Don't
worry, son! When you git through with that cockroach stew, come
back an' I'll take you out to lunch with <i>me!"</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Although Brill delighted in teasing and baiting his partner in
this fashion, there was, at the bottom of his heart, a feeling of
deep humility, of genuine respect and admiration for him: he
respected Uncle Bascom's intelligence, he was secretly and
profoundly impressed by the fact that the old man had been a
minister of the gospel and had preached in many churches.</p>

<p>Moreover, in the respect and awe with which Brill greeted
these evidences of Bascom's superior education, in the eagerness
he showed when he boasted to visitors, as he often did, of his
partner's learning, there was a quality of pride that was
profoundly touching and paternal: it was as if Bascom had been
his son and as if he wanted at every opportunity to display his
talents to the world. And this, in fact, was exactly what he did
want to do. Much to Bascom's annoyance, Brill was constantly
speaking of his erudition to strangers who had come into the
office for the first time, and constantly urging him to perform
for them, to "say some of them big words, Reverend." And even
when the old man answered him, as he frequently did, in terms of
scorn, anger, and contempt, Brill was completely satisfied if
Uncle Bascom would only use a few of the "big words" in doing it.
Thus, one day, when one of his boyhood friends, a New Hampshire
man whom he had not seen in thirty-five years, had come in to
renew their acquaintance Brill, in describing the accomplishments
of his partner, said with an air of solemn affirmation: "Why,
hell yes, Jim! It'd take a college perfesser to know what the
Reverend is talkin' about half the time! No ordinary son of a
bitch is able to understand him! So help me God, it's true!" he
swore solemnly, as Jim looked incredulous. "The Reverend knows
words the average man ain't never heard. He knows words that
ain't even in the dictionary. Yes, sir!--an' uses 'em, too--all
the time!" he concluded triumphantly.</p>

<p>"Why, my dear sir!" Bascom answered in a tone of exacerbated
contempt, "What on earth are you talking about? Such a man as you
describe would be a monstrosity, a heinous perversion of natural
law! A man so wise that no one could understand him:--so literate
that he could not communicate with his fellow-creatures:--so
erudite that he led the inarticulate and incoherent life of a
beast or a savage!"--here Uncle Bascom squinted his eyes tightly
shut, and laughed sneeringly down his nose: "Phuh! phuh! phuh!
phuh! phuh!--Why, you con-sum-mate fool!" he sneered, "I have
long known that your ignorance was bottomless--but I had never
hoped to see it equalled--Nay, surpassed!" he howled, "by your
asininity."</p>

<p>"There you are!" said Brill exultantly to his visitor, "What
did I tell you? There's one of them words, Jim: 'asserninity,'
why, damn it, the Reverend's the only one who knows what that
word means--you won't even find it in the dictionary!"</p>

<p>"Not find it in the dictionary!" Bascom yelled. "Almighty God,
come down and give this ass a tongue as Thou didst once before in
Balaam's time!"</p>

<p>Again, Brill was seated at his desk one day engaged with a
client in those intimate, cautious, and confidential
preliminaries that mark the consummation of a "deal" in real
estate. On this occasion the prospective buyer was an Italian:
the man sat awkwardly and nervously in a chair beside Brill's
desk while the great man bent his huge weight ponderously and
persuasively toward him. From time to time the Italian's voice,
sullen, cautious, disparaging, interrupted Brill's ponderous and
coaxing drone. The Italian sat stiffly, his thick, clumsy body
awkwardly clad in his "good" clothes of heavy black, his thick,
hairy, blunt-nailed hands cupped nervously upon his knees, his
black eyes glittering with suspicion under his knitted inch of
brow. At length, he shifted nervously, rubbed his paws
tentatively across his knees and then, with a smile mixed of
ingratiation and mistrust, said: "How mucha you want, eh?"</p>

<p>"How mucha we want?" Brill repeated vulgarly as the burble
began to play about within his throat. "Why, how mucha you got? .
. . You know we'll take every damn thing you got! It's not how
mucha we want, it's how mucha you got!" And he hurled himself
backward, bellowing with laughter. "By God, Reverend," he yelled
as Uncle Bascom entered, "ain't that right? It's not how mucha we
want, it's how mucha you got! 'od damn! We ought to take that as
our motter. I've got a good mind to git it printed on our
letterheads. What do you think, Reverend?"</p>

<p>"Hey?" howled Uncle Bascom absently, as he prepared to enter
his own office.</p>

<p>"I say we ought to use it for our motter."</p>

<p>"Your what?" said Uncle Bascom scornfully, pausing as if he
did not understand.</p>

<p>"Our motter," Brill said.</p>

<p>"Not your <i>motter,"</i> Bascom howled derisively. "The word
is <i>not</i> motter," he said contemptuously. "Nobody of any
refinement would say <i>motter. Motter</i> is <i>not</i>
correct!" he howled finally. "Only an ig-no<i>-ram-</i>us would
say <i>motter.</i> No!" he yelled with final conclusiveness.
"That is <i>not</i> the way to pronounce it! That is
ab-so-lute-ly and em-phat-ic-ally <i>not</i> the way to pronounce
it!"</p>

<p>"All right, then, Reverend," said Brill, submissively. "You're
the doctor. What is the word?"</p>

<p>"The word is <i>motto,"</i> Uncle Bascom snarled. "Of course!
Any fool knows that!"</p>

<p>"Why, hell," Mr. Brill protested in a hurt tone. "That's what
I said, ain't it?"</p>

<p>"No-o!" Uncle Bascom howled derisively. "No-o! By no means, by
no means, by no means! You said <i>motter.</i> The word is
<i>not</i> motter. The word is motto: m-o-t-t-o! M-O-T-T-O does
<i>not</i> spell motter," he remarked with vicious decision.</p>

<p>"What does it spell?" said Mr. Brill.</p>

<p>"It spells <i>motto,"</i> Uncle Bascom howled. "It <i>has</i>
always spelled motto! It <i>will</i> always spell motto! As it
was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be: A-a-men!" he
howled huskily in his most evangelical fashion. Then, immensely
pleased at his wit, he closed his eyes, stamped at the floor, and
snarled and snuffled down his nose with laughter.</p>

<p>"Well, anyway," said Brill, "no matter how you spell it, it's
not how mucha we want, it's how mucha you got! That's the way we
feel about it!"</p>

<p>And this, in fact, without concealment, without pretence,
without evasion, was just how Brill <i>did</i> feel about it. He
wanted everything that was his and, in addition, he wanted as
much as he could get. And this rapacity, this brutal and
unadorned gluttony, so far from making men wary of him, attracted
them to him, inspired them with unshakable confidence in his
integrity, his business honesty. Perhaps the reason for this was
that concealment did not abide in the man: he published his
intentions to the world with an oath and a roar of laughter--and
the world, having seen and judged, went away with the confidence
of this Italian--that Brill was "one fine-a man!" Even Bascom,
who had so often turned upon his colleague the weapons of scorn,
contempt, and mockery, had a curious respect for him, an acrid
sunken affection: often, when the old man and his nephew were
alone, he would recall something Brill had said and his powerful
and fluent features would suddenly be contorted in that familiar
grimace, as he laughed his curious laugh which was forced out,
with a deliberate and painful effort, through his powerful nose
and his lips, barred with a few large teeth. "Phuh! phuh! phuh!
phuh! phuh! . . . Of course!" he said, with a nasal rumination,
as he stared over the apex of his great bony hands, clasped in
meditation--"of course, he is just a poor ignorant fellow! I
don't suppose--no, sir, I really do not suppose that Brill ever
went to school over six months in his life!--Say!" Bascom paused
suddenly, turned abruptly with his strange fixed grin, and
fastened his sharp old eyes keenly on the boy: in this sudden and
abrupt change, this transference of his vision from his own
secret and personal world, in which his thought and feeling were
sunken, and which seemed to be so far away from the actual world
about him, there was something impressive and disconcerting. His
eyes were grey, sharp, and old, and one eyelid had a heavy droop
or ptosis which, although it did not obscure his vision, gave his
expression at times a sinister glint, a malevolent humour.
"--Say!" here his voice sank to a deliberate and confiding
whisper, "(Phuh! phuh! phuh! phuh! phuh!) Say--a man who
would--he told me--Oh, vile! vile! vile! my boy!" his uncle
whispered, shutting his eyes in a kind of shuddering ecstasy as
if at the memory of things too gloriously obscene to be repeated.
"Can you <i>imagine,</i> can you even <i>dream</i> of such a
state of affairs if he had possessed an atom, a <i>scintilla</i>
of delicacy and good breeding! Yes, sir!" he said with decision.
"I suppose there's no doubt about it! His beginnings were very
lowly, very poor and humble indeed! . . . Not that that is in any
sense to his discredit!" Uncle Bascom said hastily, as if it had
occurred to him that his words might bear some taint of
snobbishness. "Oh, by no means, by no means, by no means!" he
sang out, with a sweeping upward gesture of his long arm, as if
he were clearing the air of wisps of smoke. "Some of our finest
men--some of the nation's <i>leaders,</i> have come from just
such surroundings as those. Beyond a doubt! Beyond a doubt!
There's no question about it whatever! Say!"--here he turned
suddenly upon the boy again with the ptotic and sinister
intelligence of his eye. "Was <i>Lincoln</i> an aristocrat? Was
he the issue of wealthy parents? Was he brought up with a silver
spoon in his mouth? Was our <i>own</i> former governor, the
Vice-President of the United States today, reared in the lap of
luxury! Not on your life!" howled Uncle Bascom. "He came from
frugal and thrifty Vermont farming stock, he has never deviated a
<i>jot</i> from his early training, he remains today what he has
always been--one of the simplest of men! Finest people on earth,
no question about it whatever!"</p>

<p>Again, he meditated gravely with lost stare across the apex of
his great joined hands, and the boy noticed again, as he had
noticed so often, the great dignity of his head in thought--a
head that was high-browed, lean and lonely, a head that not only
in its cast of thought but even in its physical contour, and in
its profound and lonely earnestness, bore an astonishing
resemblance to that of Emerson--it was, at times like these, as
grand a head as the young man had ever seen, and on it was
legible the history of man's loneliness, his dignity, his
grandeur and despair.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir!" said Bascom, in a moment. "He is, of course, a
vulgar fellow and some of the things he says at times are Oh,
vile! vile! vile!" cried Bascom, closing his eyes and laughing,
"Oh, vile! <i>most</i> vile! <i>. . .</i> but (phuh! phuh! phuh!)
you can't help laughing at the fellow at times because he is so.
. . . Oh, I could tell you things, my boy! . . . Oh, <i>vile!</i>
<i>vile!"</i> he cried, shaking his head downwards. "What
coarseness! . . . What in-<i>vect</i>-ive!" he whispered, in a
kind of ecstasy.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Eugene was now a member of Professor Hatcher's celebrated
course for dramatists, and although he had come into this work by
chance, and would in the end discover that his heart and interest
were not in it, it had now become for him the rock to which his
life was anchored, the rudder of his destiny, the sole and
all-sufficient reason for his being here. It now seemed to him
that there was only one work in life which he could possibly do,
and that this work was writing plays, and that if he could not
succeed in this work he had better die, since any other life than
the life of the playwright and the theatre was not to be
endured.</p>

<p>Accordingly every interest and energy of his life was now
fastened on this work with a madman's passion; he thought, felt,
breathed, ate, drank, slept, and lived completely in terms of
plays. He learned all the jargon of the art-playwriting cult,
read all the books, saw all the shows, talked all the talk, and
even became a kind of gigantic eavesdropper upon life, prowling
about the streets with his ears constantly straining to hear all
the words and phrases of the passing crowd, as if he might hear
something that would be rare and priceless in a play for
Professor Hatcher's celebrated course.</p>

<p>Professor James Graves Hatcher was a man whose professional
career had been made difficult by two circumstances: all the
professors thought he looked like an actor and all the actors
thought he looked like a professor. In reality, he was wholly
neither one, but in character and temper, as well as in
appearance, he possessed some of the attributes of both.</p>

<p>His appearance was imposing: a well-set-up figure of a man of
fifty-five, somewhat above the middle height, strongly built and
verging toward stockiness, with an air of vital driving energy
that was always filled with authority and a sense of sure
purpose, and that never degenerated into the cheap exuberance of
the professional hustler. His voice, like his manner, was quiet,
distinguished, and controlled, but always touched with the
suggestions of great latent power, with reserves of passion,
eloquence, and resonant sonority.</p>

<p>His head was really splendid; he had a strong but
kindly-looking face touched keenly, quietly by humour; his eyes,
beneath his glasses, were also keen, observant, sharply humorous;
his mouth was wide and humorous but somewhat too tight, thin and
spinsterly for a man's; his nose was large and strong; his
forehead shapely and able-looking, and he had neat wings of hair
cut short and sparse and lying flat against the skull.</p>

<p>He wore eye-glasses of the pince-nez variety, and they dangled
in a fashionable manner from a black silk cord: it was better
than going to a show to see him put them on, his manner was so
urbane, casual, and distinguished when he did so. His humour,
although suave, was also quick and rich and gave an engaging
warmth and humanity to a personality that sometimes needed them.
Even in his display of humour, however, he never lost his urbane
distinguished manner--for example, when someone told him that one
of his women students had referred to another woman in the
course, an immensely tall angular creature who dressed in rusty
brown right up to the ears, as "the queen of the angleworms,"
Professor Hatcher shook all over with sudden laughter, removed
his glasses with a distinguished movement, and then in a rich but
controlled voice remarked:</p>

<p>"Ah, she has a very pretty wit. A very pretty wit indeed!"</p>

<p>Thus, even in his agreeable uses of the rich, subtle and
immensely pleasant humour with which he had been gifted,
Professor Hatcher was something of an actor. He was one of those
rare people who really "chuckle," and although there was no
doubting the spontaneity and naturalness of his chuckle, it is
also probably true that Professor Hatcher somewhat fancied
himself as a chuckler.</p>

<p>The Hatcherian chuckle was just exactly what the word
connotes: a movement of spontaneous mirth that shook his stocky
shoulders and strong well-set torso with a sudden hearty tremor.
And although he could utter rich and sonorous throat-sounds
indicative of hearty mirth while this chuckling process was going
on, an even more characteristic form was completely soundless,
the tight lips firmly compressed, the edges turned up with the
convulsive inclination to strong laughter, the fine distinguished
head thrown back, while all the rest of him, throat, shoulders,
torso, belly, arms--the whole man--shook in the silent tremors of
the chuckle.</p>

<p>It could also be said with equal truth that Professor Hatcher
was one of the few men whose eyes could really "twinkle," and it
is likewise true that he probably fancied himself as somewhat of
a twinkler.</p>

<p>Perhaps one fact that made him suspect to professors was his
air of a distinguished and mature, but also a very worldly,
urbanity. His manner, even in the class-room, was never that of
the scholar or the academician, but always that of the cultured
man of the world, secure in his authority, touched by fine humour
and fine understanding, able, knowing and assured. And one reason
that he so impressed his students may have been that he made some
of the most painful and difficult labours in the world seem
delightfully easy.</p>

<p>For example, if there were to be a performance by a French
club at the university of a French play, produced in the language
of its birth, Professor Hatcher might speak to his class in his
assured, yet casual and urbanely certain tones, as follows:</p>

<p>"I understand <i>Le Cercle Fran&ccedil;ais</i> is putting on
De Musset's <i>Il</i> <i>faut qu'une porte soit ouverte ou
ferm&eacute;e</i> on Thursday night. If you are doing nothing
else, I think it might be very well worth your while to brush up
on your French a bit and look in on it. It is, of course, a
trifle and perhaps without great significance in the development
of the modern theatre, but it is De Musset in rather good form
and De Musset in good form is charming. So it might repay you to
have a look at it."</p>

<p>What was there in these simple words that could so impress and
captivate these young people? The tone was quiet, pleasant and
urbanely casual, the manner easy yet authoritative; what he said
about the play was really true. But what was so seductive about
it was the flattering unction which he laid so casually to their
young souls--the easy off-hand suggestion that people "brush up
on their French a bit" when most of them had no French at all to
brush up on, that if they had "nothing else to do," they might
"look in" upon De Musset's "charming trifle," the easy
familiarity with De Musset's name and the casual assurance of the
statement that it was "De Musset in rather good form."</p>

<p>It was impossible for a group of young men, eager for
sophistication and emulous of these airs of urbane worldliness,
not to be impressed by them. As Professor Hatcher talked they too
became easy, casual and urbane in their manners, they had a
feeling of being delightfully at ease in the world and sure of
themselves, the words "brush up on your French a bit" gave them a
beautifully comfortable feeling that they would really be able to
perform this remarkable accomplishment in an hour or two of
elegant light labour. And when he spoke of the play as being "De
Musset in rather good form" they nodded slightly with little
understanding smiles as if De Musset and his various states of
form were matters of the most familiar knowledge to them.</p>

<p>What was the effect, then, of this and other such-like talk
upon these young men eager for fame and athirst for glory in the
great art-world of the city and the theatre? It gave them, first
of all, a delightful sense of being in the know about rare and
precious things, of rubbing shoulders with great actors and
actresses and other celebrated people, of being expert in all the
subtlest processes of the theatre, of being travelled, urbane,
sophisticated and assured.</p>

<p>When Professor Hatcher casually suggested that they might
"brush up on their French a bit" before going to a performance of
a French play, they felt like cosmopolites who were at home in
all the great cities of the world. True, "their French had grown
a little rusty"--it had been some time since they were last in
Paris--a member of the French Academy, no doubt, might detect a
few slight flaws in their pronunciation--but all that would
arrange itself by a little light and easy "polishing"--<i>"tout
s'arrange, hein?"</i> as we say upon the boulevards.</p>

<p>Again, Professor Hatcher's pleasant and often delightfully gay
anecdotes about the famous persons he had known and with whom he
was on such familiar terms--told always casually, apropos of some
topic of discussion, and never dragged in or laboured by
pretence--"The last time I was in London, Pinero and I were
having lunch together one day at the Savoy"--or "I was spending
the week-end with Henry Arthur Jones"--or "It's very curious you
should mention that. You know, Barrie was saying the same thing
to me the last time I saw him"--or--"Apropos of this discussion,
I have a letter here from 'Gene O'Neill which bears on that very
point. Perhaps you would be interested in knowing what he has to
say about it."--All this, of course, was cakes and ale to these
young people--it made them feel wonderfully near and intimate
with all these celebrated people, and with the enchanted world of
art and of the theatre in which they wished to cut a figure.</p>

<p>It gave them also a feeling of amused superiority at the
posturings and antics of what, with a slight intonation of
disdain, they called "the commercial producers"--the Shuberts,
Belascos, and others of this kind. Thus, when Professor Hatcher
told them how he had done some pioneer service in Boston for the
Russian Players and had received a telegram from the Jewish
producer in New York who was managing them, to this effect: "You
are the real wonder boy"--they were instantly able to respond to
the sudden Hatcherian chuckle with quiet laughter of their
own.</p>

<p>Again, he once came back from New York with an amusing story
of a visit he had paid to the famous producer, David Belasco. And
he described drolly how he had followed a barefoot, snaky-looking
female, clad in a long batik gown, through seven Gothic chambers
mystical with chimes and incense. And finally he told how he had
been ushered into the presence of the great ecclesiastic who sat
at the end of a cathedral-like room beneath windows of church
glass, and how he was preceded all the time by Snaky Susie who
swept low in obeisance as she approached, and said in a silky
voice--"One is here to see you, Mahster," and how she had been
dismissed with Christ-like tone and movement of the hand--"Rise,
Rose, and leave us now." Professor Hatcher told this story with a
quiet drollery that was irresistible, and was rewarded all along
by their shouts of astounded laughter, and finally by their
smiling and astonished faces, lifting disbelieving eyebrows at
each other, saying, "Simply incredible! It doesn't seem possible!
. . . <i>Marvellous!"</i></p>

<p>Finally, when Professor Hatcher talked to them of how a
Russian actress used her hands, of rhythm, tempo, pause, and
timing, of lighting, setting, and design, he gave them a language
they could use with a feeling of authority and knowledge, even
when authority and knowledge were lacking to them. It was a
dangerous and often very trivial language--a kind of jargonese of
art that was coming into use in the world of those days, and that
seemed to be coincident with another jargonese--that of
science--"psychology," as they called it--which was also coming
into its brief hour of idolatry at about the same period, and
which bandied about its talk of "complexes," "fixations,"
"repressions," "inhibitions," and the like, upon the lips of any
empty-headed little fool that came along.</p>

<p>But although this jargon was perhaps innocuous enough when
rattled off the rattling tongue of some ignorant boy or
rattle-pated girl, it could be a very dangerous thing when
uttered seriously by men who were trying to achieve the best, the
rarest, and the highest life on earth--the life which may be won
only by bitter toil and knowledge and stern living--the life of
the artist.</p>

<p>And the great danger of this glib and easy jargon of the arts
was this: that instead of knowledge, the experience of hard work
and patient living, they were given a formula for knowledge; a
language that sounded very knowing, expert and assured, and yet
that knew nothing, was experienced in nothing, was sure of
nothing. It gave to people without talent and without sincerity
of soul or integrity of purpose, with nothing, in fact, except a
feeble incapacity for the shock and agony of life, and a desire
to escape into a glamorous and unreal world of make-believe--a
justification for their pitiable and base existence. It gave to
people who had no power in themselves to create anything of merit
or of beauty--people who were the true Philistines and enemies of
art and of the artist's living spirit--the language to talk with
glib knowingness of things they knew nothing of--to prate of
"settings," "tempo," "pace," and "rhythm," of "boldly stylized
conventions," and the wonderful way some actress "used her
hands." And in the end, it led to nothing but falseness and
triviality, to the ghosts of passion, and the spectres of
sincerity, to the shoddy appearances of conviction and belief in
people who had no passion and sincerity, and who were convinced
of nothing, believed in nothing, were just the disloyal apes of
fashion and the arts.</p>

<p>"I think you ought to go," says one. "I really do. I really
think you might be interested."</p>

<p>"Yes," says number two, in a tone of fine, puzzled,
eyebrow-lifting protest, "but I hear the play is pretty bad. The
reviews were rather awful--they really were, you know."</p>

<p>"Oh, the play!" the other says, with a slight start of
surprise, as if it never occurred to him that anyone might be
interested in the play--"the play, the play <i>is</i> rather
terrible. But, my dear fellow, no one goes to see the <i>play . .
.</i> the play is nothing," he dismisses it with a contemptuous
gesture--"It's the <i>sets!"</i> he cries--"the <i>sets</i> are
really quite remarkable. You ought to go, old boy, just to see
the <i>sets!</i> They're very good--they really are."</p>

<p>"H'm!" the other says, stroking his chin in an impressed
manner. "Interesting! In that case, I shall go!"</p>

<p>The <i>sets!</i> The <i>sets!</i> One should not go to see the
play; the only thing that matters is the sets. And this is the
theatre--the magic-maker and the world of dreams; and these the
men that are to fashion for it--with their trivial ape's talk
about "sets." Did anyone ever hear such damned stuff as this
since time began?</p>

<p>False, trivial, glib, dishonest, empty, without substance,
lacking faith--is it any wonder that among Professor Hatcher's
young men few birds sang?</p>

<p> </p>

<h1>XIII</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>That year the youth was twenty, it had been his first year in
New England, and the winter had seemed very long. In the
man-swarm he felt alone and lost, a desolate atom in the streets
of life. That year he went to see his uncle many times.</p>

<p>Sometimes he would find him in his dusty little cubicle, bent
over the intricacy of a legal form, painfully and carefully, with
compressed lips, filling in the blank spaces with his stiff,
angular and laborious hand. Bascom would speak quietly, without
looking up, as he came in: "Hello, my boy. Sit down, won't you?
I'll be with you in a moment." And for a time the silence would
be broken only by the heavy rumble of Brill's voice outside, by
the minute scratching of his uncle's pen, and by the immense and
murmurous sound of time, which rose above the city, which caught
up in the upper air all of the city's million noises, and yet
seemed remote, essential, imperturbable and everlasting--fixed
and unchanging, no matter what men lived or died.</p>

<p>Again, the boy would find his uncle staring straight before
him, with his great hands folded in a bony arch, his powerful
gaunt face composed in a rapt tranquillity of thought. At these
times he seemed to have escaped from every particular and
degrading thing in life--from the excess of absurd and eccentric
speech and gesture, from all demeaning parsimonies, from niggling
irascibilities, from everything that contorted his face and
spirit away from its calmness and unity of thought. His face at
such a time might well have been the mask of thought, the visage
of contemplation. Sometimes he would not speak for several
minutes, his mind seemed to brood upon the lip and edge of time,
to be remote from every dusty moment of the earth.</p>

<p>One day the boy went there and found him thus: after a few
moments he lowered his great hands and, without turning toward
his nephew, sat for some time in an attitude of quiet relaxation.
At length he said:</p>

<p>"What is man that thou art mindful of him?"</p>

<p>It was one of the first days of spring: the spring had come
late, with a magical northern suddenness. It seemed to have burst
out of the earth overnight, the air was lyrical and sang with
it.</p>

<p>Spring came that year like a triumph and like a prophecy--it
sang and shifted like a moth of light before the youth, but he
was sure that it would bring him a glory and fulfilment he had
never known.</p>

<p>His hunger and thirst had been immense: he was caught up for
the first time in the midst of the Faustian web--there was no
food that could feed him, no drink that could quench his thirst.
Like an insatiate and maddened animal he roamed the streets,
trying to draw up mercy from the cobble-stones, solace and wisdom
from a million sights and faces, or he prowled through endless
shelves of high-piled books, tortured by everything he could not
see and could not know, and growing blind, weary, and desperate
from what he read and saw. He wanted to know all, have all, be
all--to be one and many, to have the whole riddle of this vast
and swarming earth as legible, as tangible in his hand as a coin
of minted gold.</p>

<p>Suddenly spring came, and he fell at once exultant certainty
and joy. Outside his uncle's dirty window he could see the edge
of Faneuil Hall, and hear the swarming and abundant activity of
the markets. The deep roar of the markets reached them across the
singing and lyrical air, and he drank into his lungs a thousand
proud, potent, and mysterious odours which came to him like the
breath of certainty, like the proof of magic, and like the
revelation that all confusion had been banished--the world that
he longed for won, the word that he sought for spoken, the hunger
that devoured him fed and ended. And the markets, swarming with
richness, joy, and abundance, thronged below him like a living
evidence of fulfilment. For it seemed to him that nowhere more
than here was the passionate enigma of New England felt: New
England, with its harsh and stony soil, and its tragic and lonely
beauty; its desolate rocky coasts and its swarming fisheries, the
white, piled, frozen bleakness of its winters with the
magnificent jewellery of stars, the dark firwoods, and the warm
little white houses at which it is impossible to look without
thinking of groaning bins, hung bacon, hard cider, succulent
bastings and love's warm, white and opulent flesh.</p>

<p>There was the rustle of gingham by day and sober glances;
then, under low eaves and starlight, the stir of the satiny
thighs in feather beds, the white small bite and tigerish clasp
of secret women--always the buried heart, the sunken passion, the
frozen heat. And then, after the long, unendurably hard-locked
harshness of the frozen winter, the coming of spring as now, like
a lyrical cry, like a flicker of rain across a window glass, like
the sudden and delicate noises of a spinet--the coming of spring
and ecstasy, and overnight the thrum of wings, the burst of the
tender buds, the ripple and dance of the roughened water, the
light of flowers, the sudden, fleeting, almost captured, and
exultant spring.</p>

<p>And here, within eighty yards of the dusty little room where
his uncle Bascom had his desk, there was living evidence that
this intuition was not false: the secret people, it was evident,
did not subsist alone on codfish and a jugful of baked
beans--they ate meat, and large chunks of it, for all day long,
within the market district, the drivers of big wagons were
standing to their chins in meat, boys dragged great baskets of
raw meat along the pavements, red-faced butchers, aproned with
gouts of blood, and wearing the battered straw hats that butchers
wear, toiled through the streets below with great loads of loin
or haunch or rib, and in "chill" shops with sawdust floors the
beeves were hung in frozen regimental rows.</p>

<p>Right and left, around the central market, the old buildings
stretched down to the harbour and the smell of ships: this was
built-on land; in old days ships were anchored where these
cobbles were, but the warehouses were also old--they had the
musty, mellow, blackened air and smell of the 'seventies, they
looked like Victorian prints, they reeked of ancient ledgers, of
"counting-houses," of proud, moneyed merchants, and the
soft-spoked rumble of victorias.</p>

<p>By day, this district was one snarled web of chaos: a
<i>gewirr</i> of deep-bodied trucks, powerful dappled horses,
cursing drivers, of loading, unloading, and shipping, of dispatch
and order, of the million complicated weavings of life and
business.</p>

<p>But if one came here at evening, after the work of the day was
done, if one came here at evening on one of those delicate and
sudden days of spring that New England knows, if one came here as
many a lonely youth had come here in the past, some boy from the
inland immensity of America, some homesick lad from the South,
from the marvellous hills of Old Catawba, he might be pierced
again by the bitter ecstasy of youth, the ecstasy that tears him
apart with a cry that has no tongue, the ecstasy that is proud,
lonely, and exultant, that is fierce with joy and a moment, that
the intangible cannot be touched, the ungraspable cannot be
grasped--the imperial and magnificent minute is gone for ever
which, with all its promises, its million intuitions, he wishes
to clothe with the living substance of beauty. He wishes to flesh
the moment with the thighs and breast and belly of a wonderful
mistress, he wishes to be great and glorious and triumphant, to
distil the ether of this ecstasy in a liquor, and to drink strong
joy for ever; and at the heart of all this is the bitter
knowledge of death--death of the moment, death of the day, death
of one more infrequent spring.</p>

<p>Perhaps the thing that really makes New England wonderful is
this sense of joy, this intuition of brooding and magic
fulfilment that hovers like a delicate presence in the air of one
of these days. Perhaps the answer is simple: perhaps it is only
that this soft and sudden spring, with its darts and flicks of
evanescent joy, its sprite-like presence that is only half
believed, its sound that is the sound of something lost and elfin
and half dreamed, half heard, seems wonderful after the grim
frozen tenacity of the winter, the beautiful and terrible
desolation, the assault of the frost and ice on living flesh
which resists it finally as it would resist the cruel battering
of a brute antagonist, so that the tart, stingy speech, the tight
gestures, the withdrawn and suspicious air, the thin lips, red
pointed noses and hard prying eyes of these people are really the
actions of those who, having to defend themselves harshly against
nature, harshly defend themselves against all the world.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>At any rate, the thing the boy feels who comes here at the
day's end is not completion, weariness, and sterility, but a
sense of swelling ecstasy, a note of brooding fulfilment. The air
will have in it the wonderful odours of the market and the smell
of the sea; as he walks over the bare cobbled pavement under the
corrugated tin awnings of the warehouses and produce stores a
hundred smells of the rich fecundity of the earth will assail
him: the clean sharp pungency of thin crated wood and the citric
nostalgia of oranges, lemons, and grape-fruit, the stench of a
decayed cabbage and the mashed pulp of a rotten orange. There
will be also the warm coarse limy smell of chickens, the strong
coddy smell of cold fish and oysters; and the crisp moist
cleanliness of the garden smells--of great lettuces, cabbages,
new potatoes, with their delicate skins loamy with sweet earth,
the wonderful sweet crispness of crated celery; and then the
melons--the ripe golden melons bedded in fragrant straw--and all
the warm infusions of the tropics: the bananas, the pineapples
and the alligator pears.</p>

<p>The delicate and subtle air of spring touches all these odours
with a new and delicious vitality; it draws the tar out of the
pavements also, and it draws slowly, subtly, from ancient
warehouses the compacted perfumes of eighty years: the sweet thin
piny scents of packing-boxes, the glutinous composts of half a
century, that have thickly stained old warehouse plankings, the
smells of twine, tar, turpentine and hemp, and of thick molasses,
ginseng, pungent vines and roots and old piled sacking; the
clean, ground strength of fresh coffee, brown, sultry, pungent,
and exultantly fresh and clean; the smell of oats, baled hay and
bran, of crated eggs and cheese and butter; and particularly the
smell of meat, of frozen beeves, slick porks, and veals, of
brains and livers and kidneys, of haunch, paunch, and jowl; of
meat that is raw and of meat that is cooked, for upstairs in that
richly dingy block of buildings there is a room where the
butchers, side by side with the bakers, the bankers, the brokers
and the Harvard boys, devour thick steaks of the best and
tenderest meat, smoking-hot breads, and big, jacketed
potatoes.</p>

<p>And then there is always the sea. In dingy blocks, memoried
with time and money, the buildings stretch down to the docks, and
there is always the feeling that the sea was here, that this is
built-on earth. A single truck will rattle over the deserted
stones, and then there is the street that runs along the harbour,
the dingy little clothing shops and eating places, the powerful
strings of freight cars, agape and empty, odorous with their warm
fatigued planking and the smells of flanges and axles that have
rolled great distances.</p>

<p>And finally, by the edges of the water, there are great piers
and storehouses, calm and potent with their finished work: they
lie there, immense, starkly ugly, yet touched with the powerful
beauty of enormous works and movements; they are what they are,
they have been built without a flourish for the work they do,
their great sides rise in level cliffs of brick, they are pierced
with tracks and can engulf great trains; and now that the day is
done they breathe with the vitality of a tired but living
creature. A single footfall will make remote and lonely echoes in
their brooding depths, there will be the expiring clatter of a
single truck, the sound of a worker's voice as he says "Good
night," and then the potent and magical silence.</p>

<p>And then there is the sea--the sea, beautiful and mysterious
as it is only when it meets the earth in harbours, the sea that
bears in swell and glut of tides the odorous savour of the earth,
the sea that swings and slaps against encrusted piles, the sea
that is braided with long ropes of scummy weed, the sea that
brings the mast and marly scent of shelled decay. There is the
sea, and there are the great ships--the freighters, the fishing
schooners, the clean white one-night boats that make the New York
run, now also potent and silent, a glitter of bright lights, of
gleaming brasses, of opulent saloons--a token of joy and
splendour in dark waters, a hint of love and the velvet belly
upon dark tides--and the sight of all these things, the fusion of
all these odours by the sprite of May is freighted with
unspeakable memories, with unutterable intuitions for the youth:
he does not know what he would utter, but glory, love, power,
wealth, flight, and movement and the sight of new earth in the
morning, and the living corporeal fulfilment of all his ecstasy
is in his wish and his conviction.</p>

<p>Certainly, these things can be found in New England, but
perhaps the person who finds this buried joy the most is this
lonely visitor--and particularly the boy from the South, for in
the heart of the Southerner alone, perhaps, is this true and
secret knowledge of the North: it is there in his dreams and his
childhood premonition, it is there like the dark Helen, and no
matter what he sees to cheat it, he will always believe in it, he
will always return to it. Certainly, this was true of the gnarled
and miserly old man who now sat not far from all this glory in
his dingy State Street office, for Bascom Pentland, although the
stranger on seeing him might have said, "There goes the very
image of a hard-bitten old Down-Easter," had come, as lonely and
wretched a youth as ever lived, from the earth of Old Catawba, he
had known and felt these things and, in spite of his frequent
bitter attacks on the people, the climate, the life, New England
was the place to which he had returned to live, and for which he
felt the most affection.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Now, ruminant and lost, he stared across the archway of his
hands. In a moment, with what was only an apparent irrelevance,
with what was really a part of the coherent past, a light plucked
from dark adyts of the brain, he said: "Who knoweth the spirit of
man that goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast that goeth
downward to the earth?"</p>

<p>He was silent and thoughtful for a moment; then he added
sadly: "I am an old man. I have lived a long time. I have seen so
many things. Sometimes everything seems so long ago."</p>

<p>Then his eye went back into the wilderness, the lost earth,
the buried men.</p>

<p>Presently he said: "I hope you will come out on Sunday. O, by
all means! By all means! I believe your aunt is expecting you.
Yes, sir, I believe she said something to that effect. Or perhaps
she intends to pay a visit to one of her children. I do not know,
I have not the <i>remotest</i>--not the <i>faintest</i> idea, of
what she proposes to do," he howled. "Of course," he said
impatiently and scornfully, "I never have any notion what she has
in mind. No, sir, I really could not tell you. I no longer pay
any attention to what she says--O! not the slightest!" he waved
his great hand through the air--<i>"Say!"</i> stiffly and harshly
he tapped the boy's knee, grinning at him with the combative
glitter of his ptotic eye--<i>"Say!</i> did you ever find
<i>one</i> of them with whom it was possible to carry on a
coherent conversation? Did you ever find one of them who would
respond to the processes of reason and ordered thought? My dear
boy!" he cried, "you cannot talk to them. I assure you, you
cannot talk to them. You might as well whistle into the wind or
spit into the waters of the Nile, for all the good it will do
you. In his youth man will bare the riches of his spirit to them,
will exhaust the rich accumulations of his genius--his wisdom,
his learning, his philosophy--in an effort to make them worthy of
his companionship--and in the end, what does he <i>always</i>
find? Why," said Uncle Bascom bitterly, "that he has spent his
powers in talking to an imbecile"--and he snarled vengefully
through his nose. In a moment more, he contorted his face, and
nasally whined in a grotesque and mincing parody of a woman's
voice, "O, I feel <i>so</i> sick! O, deary <i>me,</i> now! I
think my <i>time</i> is coming on again! O, you don't <i>love</i>
me any mo-o-ore! O, I <i>wish</i> I was dead! O, I can't get
<i>up</i> today! O, I wish you'd bring me something <i>nice</i>
from <i>ta-own!</i> O, if you loved me you'd buy me a <i>new</i>
hat! O, I've got nothing to <i>we-e-ar!"</i> here his voice had
an added snarl of bitterness--"I'm ashamed to go out on the
street with all the other wim-men!"</p>

<p>Then he paused broodingly for a moment more, wheeled abruptly
and tapped the boy on the knee again: "The proper study of
mankind is--say!" he said with a horrible fixed grimace and in a
kind of cunning whisper--"does the poet say--<i>woman?</i> I want
to ask you: <i>does</i> he, now? Not on your life!" yelled Uncle
Bascom. "The word is <i>man! man! man!</i> Nothing else but
<i>man!"</i></p>

<p>Again he was silent: then, with an accent of heavy sarcasm, he
went on: "Your aunt likes music. You may have observed your aunt
is fond of music--"</p>

<p>It was, in fact, the solace of her life: on a tiny gramophone
which one of her daughters had given her, she played constantly
the records of the great composers.</p>

<p>"--Your aunt is fond of music," Bascom said deliberately.
"Perhaps you may have thought--perhaps it seemed to you that she
discovered it--perhaps you thought it was your aunt's own patent
and invention--but there you would be wrong! O yes! my boy!" he
howled remotely.</p>

<p>"You may have thought so, but you would be wrong--Say!" he
turned slowly with a malevolent glint of interrogation, a
controlled ironic power--"was the Fifth Symphony written by a
woman? Was the object of your aunt's worship, Richard Wagner, a
<i>female?"</i> he snarled. "By no means! Where are their great
works--their mighty symphonies, their great paintings, their epic
poetry? Was it in a woman's skull that the <i>Critique of Pure
Reason</i> was conceived? Is the gigantic work upon the ceiling
of the Sistine Chapel the product of a woman's genius?--Say! did
you ever hear of a lady by the name of William Shakespeare? Was
it a female of that name who wrote <i>King Lear?</i> Are you
familiar with the works of a nice young lady named John Milton?
Or Fr&auml;ulein Goethe, a sweet German girl?" he sneered.
"Perhaps you have been edified by the writ-ings of Mademoiselle
Voltaire or Miss Jonathan Swift? Phuh! Phuh! Phuh! Phuh!
Phuh!"</p>

<p>He paused, stared deliberately across his hands, and in a
moment repeated, slowly and distinctly: "The woman gave me of the
tree and I did eat. Ah! that's it! There, my boy, you have it!
There, in a nutshell, you have the work for which they are best
fitted." And he turned upon his nephew suddenly with a blaze of
passion, his voice husky and tremulous from the stress of
emotion. "The tempter! The Bringer of Forbidden Fruit! The
devil's ambassador! Since the beginning of time that has been
their office--to madden the brain, to turn man's spirit from its
highest purposes, to corrupt, to seduce, and to destroy! To creep
and crawl, to intrude into the lonely places of man's heart and
brain, to wind herself into the core of his most secret life as a
worm eats its way into a healthy fruit--to do all this with the
guile of a serpent, the cunning of a fox--that, my boy, is what
she's here for!--and she'll never change!" And, lowering his
voice to an ominous and foreboding whisper, he said mysteriously,
"Beware! Beware! Do not be deceived!"</p>

<p>In a moment more he had resumed his tone and manner of calm
deliberation and, with an air of irrelevance, somewhat
grudgingly, as if throwing a bone to a dog, he said: "Your aunt,
of course, was a woman of considerable mentality--considerable,
that is, for a female. Of course, her mind is no longer what it
used to be. I never talk to her any more," he said indifferently.
"I do not listen to her. I think she said something to me about
your coming out on Sunday! But I do not know. No, sir, I could
not tell you what her plans are. I have my own interests, and I
suppose she has hers. Of course, she has her music. . . . Yes,
sir, she always has her music," he said indifferently and
contemptuously, and, staring across the apex of his hands, he
forgot her.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Yet, he had been young, and full of pain and madness. For a
space he had known all the torments any lover ever knew. So much
Louise had told her nephew, and so much Bascom had not troubled
to deny. For bending toward the boy swiftly, fiercely, and
abruptly, as if Bascom was not there, she whispered: "Oh, yes!
he's indifferent enough to me now--but there was a time, there
was a time, I tell you!--when he was mad about me! The old fool!"
she cackled suddenly and bitterly with a seeming irrelevance.
Then bending forward suddenly with a resumption of her former
brooding intensity, she whispered: "Yes! he was mad, mad, mad!
Oh, he can't deny it!" she cried. "He couldn't keep his eyes off
me for a minute! He went cwazy if any other man so much as looked
at me!"</p>

<p>"Quite true, my dear! Quite true!" said Uncle Bascom without a
trace of anger or denial in his voice, with one of his sudden and
astonishing changes to a mood of tender and tranquil agreement.
"Oh, yes," he said again, staring reminiscently across the apex
of his great folded hands, "it is all quite true--every word as
she has spoken it--quite true, quite true, I had forgotten, but
it's all quite true." And he shook his gaunt head gently from
side to side, turning his closed eyes downward, and snuffling
gently, blindly, tenderly, with laughter, with a passive and
indifferent memory.</p>

<p>For a year or two after his marriage, she had said, he had
been maddened by a black insanity of jealousy. It descended on
his spirit like a choking and pestilence-laden cloud, it entered
his veins with blackened tongues of poison, it crept along the
conduits of his blood, sweltered venomously in his heart, it
soaked into the convolutions of his brain until his brain was
fanged with hatred, soaked in poison, stricken, maddened, and
unhinged. His gaunt figure wasted until he became the picture of
skeletonized emaciation; jealousy and fear ate like a vulture at
his entrails, all of the vital energy, the power and intensity of
his life, was fed into this poisonous and consuming fire and
then, when it had almost wrecked his health, ruined his career,
and destroyed his reason, it left him as suddenly as it came: his
life reverted to its ancient and embedded core of egotism, he
grew weary of his wife, he thought of her indifferently, he
forgot her.</p>

<p>And she, poor soul, was like a rabbit trapped before the
fierce yellow eye, the hypnotic stare of a crouching tiger. She
did not know whether he would spring, strike forth his paw to
maul her, or walk off indifferently. She was dazed and stricken
before the violence of his first passion, the unreasoning madness
of his jealousy, and in the years that followed she was
bewildered, resentful, and finally embittered by the abrupt
indifference which succeeded it--an indifference so great that
often he seemed to forget her very existence for days at a time,
to live with her in a little house as if he were scarcely
conscious of her presence, stumping about the place in an
intensity of self-absorption while he cursed and muttered to
himself, banged open furnace doors, chopped up whatever
combinations of raw foods his fantastic imagination might
contrive, and answering her impatiently and contemptuously when
she spoke to him: "What did you <i>say-y</i>! Oh, what are you
talk-ing about?"--and he would stump away again, absorbed
mysteriously with his own affairs. And sometimes, if he was the
victim of conspiracy in the universe--if God had forsaken him and
man had tricked and cheated him, he would roll upon the floor,
hammer his heels against the wall, and howl his curses at
oblivious heaven.</p>

<p>Louise, meanwhile, her children having left her, played Wagner
on the gramophone, kept her small house tidy, and learned to
carry on involved and animated conversations with herself, or
even with her pots and pans, for when she scrubbed and cleaned
them, she would talk to them: if she dropped one, she would scold
it, pick it from the floor, spank it across the bottom, saying:
"No, you don't! Naughty, you bad thing, you!" And often, while he
stumped through the house, these solitary conversations were
interspersed by fits of laughter: she would bend double over her
pots snuffling with soft laughter which was faintly broken at its
climax, a long high "Who-o-op!" Then she would shake her head
pityingly, and be off again, but at what she was laughing she
could not have said.</p>

<p>One night, however, she interrupted one of Bascom's stamping
and howling tirades by putting on her tiny gramophone <i>The Ride
of the Valkyries,</i> as recorded by the Philadelphia Symphony
Orchestra. Bascom, after the first paralysis of his surprise had
passed, rushed furiously toward the offending instrument that was
providing such melodious but mighty competition. Then Bascom
halted; for suddenly he noticed that Louise was standing beside
the instrument, that she was snuffling through her nose with
laughter, and that from time to time she looked craftily toward
him, and broke into a high piercing cackle. Bascom also noticed
that she held a large carving-knife in her hand. With a loud yell
he turned and fled toward his room, where he locked the door,
crying out strongly in an agony of terror: "O Momma! Momma! Save
me!"</p>

<p>All this had amused Louise enormously. She played the record
over time after time, for ever snuffling with laughter and the
high cackle: "Who-oo-oo!" She bent double with it.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>And now, as the boy looked at the old man, he had a sense of
union with the past. It seemed to him if he would only speak, the
living past, the voices of lost men, the pain, the pride, the
madness and despair, the million scenes and faces of the buried
life--all that an old man ever knew--would be revealed to him,
would be delivered to him like a priceless treasure, as an
inheritance which old men owed to young, and which should be the
end and effort of all living. His savage hunger was a kind of
memory: he thought if he could speak, it would be fed.</p>

<p>And for a moment, it seemed, he saw the visages of time, dark
time, the million lock-bolts shot back in man's memory, the faces
of the lost Americans, and all the million casual moments of
their lives, with Bascom blazing at them from a dozen pulpits,
Bascom, tortured by love and madness, walking the streets of the
nation, stumping the rutted roads, muttering through darkness
with clasped bony hands, a gaunt and twisted figure reeling
across the continent below immense and cruel skies. Light fell
upon his face and darkness crossed it:--he came up from the
wilderness, from derbied men and bustled women, from all of the
memories of lavish brown, and from time, dark time--from a time
that was further off than Saxon thanes, all of the knights, the
spearheads, and the horses.</p>

<p>Was all this lost?</p>

<p>"It was so long ago," the old man said.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Bitterly, bitterly Boston one time more: the flying leaf, the
broken cloud. Was no love crying in the wilderness?</p>

<p>"--So long ago. I have lived so long. I have seen so much. I
could tell you so many things," his uncle said huskily, with
weariness and indifference. His eye was lustreless and dead, he
looked for a moment tired and old.</p>

<p>All at once, a strange and perplexing vision, which was to
return many times in the years that followed, came to the boy. It
was this: there was a company of old men and women at dinner,
seated together around a table. All of them were very old, older
than his uncle; the faces of the old men and women were fragile
and delicate like old yellowed china, their faces were frail and
sexless, they had begun to look alike. In their youth all these
people had known one another. The men had drunk, fought, whored,
hated one another, and loved the women. Some had been devoured by
the sterile and corrupt fear and envy that young men know. In
secret their lips were twisted, their faces livid, and their
hearts bitter; their eyes glittered with a reptilian hatred of
another man--they dreaded his success, and they exulted in his
failure, laughing with a delirious joy when they heard or read of
his hurt, defeat, or humiliation. They had been afraid to speak
or confess what was in their hearts, they feared the mockery of
their fellows; with one another their words were careful, picked,
and disparaging. They gave the lie to passion and belief and they
said what they knew was false. And yet along dark roads at night
they had shouted out into the howling winds their great
goat-cries of joy, exultancy and power; they had smelled snow in
thick brooding air at night, and they had watched it come, softly
spitting at the window glass, numbing the footfalls of the earth
with its soft silent fall, filling their hearts with a dark proud
ecstasy, touching their entrails with impending prophecy. Each
had a thousand dark desires and fantasies; each wanted wealth,
power, fame and love; each saw himself as great, good and
talented; each feared and hated rivals in business or in
love--and in crowds they glared at one another with hard hostile
eyes, they bristled up like crested cocks, they watched their
women jealously, felt looks and glances through their
shoulder-blades, and hated men with white spermatic necks,
amorous hair, and faces proud and insolent with female
conquest.</p>

<p>They had been young and full of pain and combat, and now all
this was dead in them: they smiled mildly, feebly, gently, they
spoke in thin voices, and they looked at one another with eyes
dead to desire, hostility, and passion.</p>

<p>As for the old women, they sat there on their yellowed and
bony haunches. They were all beyond the bitter pain and ecstasy
of youth--its frenzy, its hope, its sinew of bright blood and
agony: they were beyond the pain and fear of anything save age
and death. Here was a faithful wife, a fruitful mother; here was
an adulterous and voluptuous woman, the potent mistress of a
dozen men; here was her cuckold husband, who had screamed like a
tortured animal when he had first found her in bed with another
man, and here was the man he found her with; here was another man
in whom the knowledge of his wife's infidelity had aroused only a
corrupt inverted joy; he exulted in it, he urged her on into new
love affairs, he besought her greedily to taunt him with it, he
fed upon his pain--and now they were all old and meagre and had
the look of yellowed china. They turned their mild sunken faces
toward one another with looks in which there was neither hate nor
love nor desire nor passion; they laughed thinly, and their
memory was all of little things.</p>

<p>They no longer wanted to excel or to be first; they were no
longer mad and jealous; they no longer hated rivals; they no
longer wanted fame; they no longer cared for work or grew drunk
on hope; they no longer turned into the dark and struck their
bloody knuckles at the wall; they no longer writhed with shame
upon their beds, cursed at the memory of defeat and desolation,
or ripped the sheets between convulsive fingers. Could they not
speak? Had they forgotten?</p>

<p>Why could not the old men speak? They had known pain, death
and madness, yet all their words were stale and rusty. They had
known the wilderness, the savage land, the blood of the murdered
men ran down into the earth that gave no answer; and they had
seen it, they had shed it. Where were the passion, pain and
pride, the million living moments of their lives? Was all this
lost? Were they all tongueless? It seemed to the boy that there
was something sly and evil in their glances as they sat together,
as if they hoarded some cunning and malevolent wisdom in their
brains, as if the medicine to all our grief and error was in
them, but as if through the evil and conspirate communication of
their glance, they had resolved to keep it from us. Or were they
simply devoured with satiety, with weariness and indifference?
Did they refuse to speak because they could not speak, because
even memory had gone lifeless in them?</p>

<p>Yes. Words echoed in their throat but they were tongueless.
For them the past was dead: they poured into our hands a handful
of dry dust and ashes.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>The dry bones, the bitter dust? The living wilderness, the
silent waste? The barren land?</p>

<p>Have no lips trembled in the wilderness? No eyes sought
seaward from the rock's sharp edge for men returning home? Has no
pulse beat more hot with love or hate upon the river's edge? Or
where the old wheel and the rusted stock lie stogged in desert
sand: by the horsehead a woman's skull. No love?</p>

<p>No lonely footfalls in a million streets, no heart that beat
its best and bloodiest cry out against the steel and stone, no
aching brain, caught in its iron ring, groping among the
labyrinthine canyons? Naught in that immense and lonely land but
incessant growth and ripeness and pollution, the emptiness of
forests and deserts, the unhearted, harsh and metal jangle of a
million tongues, crying the belly-cry for bread, or the great
cat's snarl for meat and honey? All then, all? Birth and the
twenty thousand days of snarl and jangle--and no love, no love?
Was no love crying in the wilderness?</p>

<p>It was not true. The lovers lay below the lilac bush; the
laurel leaves were trembling in the wood.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Suddenly it seemed to the boy that if he could put his hand
upon his uncle, if he could grip his fingers in his stringy arm,
his own strength and youth would go into him, and he could
rekindle memory like a living flame in him, he could animate for
an hour that ancient heart with the exultancy, the power, the joy
that pulsed in himself; he could make the old man speak.</p>

<p>He wanted to speak to him as people never speak to one
another, he wanted to say and hear the things one never says and
hears. He wanted to know what the old man's youth beyond its grim
weather of poverty, loneliness, and desperation had been like.
His uncle had been over ten years old when the war had ended, and
he had seen the men plod home in wreaths of dust and heard their
casual voices in a room; he had breathed the air of vanished
summers, he had seen cloud shadows floating on the massed green
of the wilderness, the twisting of a last lone leaf upon a bough;
and he had heard the desolate and stricken voices in the South
long, long ago, the quiet and casual voices of lost men, a
million vanished footsteps in the streets of life. And he had
known the years of brown, dark lavish brown, the lost and
hypocritical years, the thunder of the wheels and hooves upon the
cobbles, the colour of bright blood--the savagery, the hunger and
the fear.</p>

<p>Was the memory of all this lost?</p>

<p>The boy touched him--he put his hand upon his uncle's
shoulder; the old man did not move. Sunken in what lost world,
buried in what incommunicable and tongueless past, he said--"So
long ago."</p>

<p>Then the boy got up and left him and went out into the streets
where the singing and lyrical air, the man-swarm passing in its
million-footed weft, the glorious women and the girls compacted
in a single music of belly and breasts and thighs, the sea, the
earth, the proud, potent, clamorous city, all of the voices of
time, fused to a unity that was like a song, a token and a cry.
Victoriously, he trod the neck of doubt as if it were a serpent:
he was joined to the earth, a part of it, and he possessed it; he
would be wasted and consumed, filled and renewed eternally; he
would feel unceasingly alternate tides of life and dark oblivion;
he would be emptied without weariness, replenished for ever with
strong joy. He had a tongue for agony, a food for hunger, a door
for exile and a surfeit for insatiate desire: exultant certainty
welled up in him, he thought he could possess it all, and he
cried: "Yes! It will be mine!"</p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h1>XIV</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>He had spells and rhymes of magic numbers which would enable
him, he thought, to read all of the million books in the great
library. This was a furious obsession with him all the time. And
there were other spells and rhymes which would enable him to know
the lives of 50,000,000 people, to visit every country in the
world, to know a hundred languages, possess 10,000 lovely women,
and yet have one he loved and honoured above all, who would be
true and beautiful and faithful to him.</p>

<p>And by the all-resuming magic of these spells he would go
everywhere on earth, while keeping one place to return to; and
while driven mad with thirst and hunger to have everything, he
would be peacefully content with almost nothing; and while
wanting to be a famous, honoured, celebrated man, he would live
obscurely, decently, and well, with one true love for ever. In
short, he would have the whole cake of the world, and eat it,
too--have adventures, labours, joys, and triumphs that would
exhaust the energies of ten thousand men, and yet have spells and
charms for all of it, and was sure that with these charms and
spells and sorceries, all of it was his.</p>

<p>He would rush out of the great library into the street and
take the subway into Boston. And as the train smashed and rocked
along, he would sit there solemnly with his lungs expanded to the
bursting point and his chest swollen and stuck out like the
breast of a pouter pigeon, while his eyes bulged, the veins on
his forehead stuck out, and his face slowly turned an apoplectic
purple as he sat there rocking with the agony of his effort.</p>

<p>Then the train would roar into the Central Station, and the
breath would come sobbing and soughing out of his tortured lungs
like wind out of an organ bellows. And for several seconds, while
the train was stopped there at the station (for in these magic
formulas these stops at stations "did not count") he would pant
and gasp for breath like a fish out of water, gulping a new
supply ravenously down into his lungs again, as if he thought he
was being shot in a projectile through the terrific vacuum of
unmeasured space.</p>

<p>Then, as the train roared out into the tunnel's dark again, he
would repeat the effort, sitting as solemn as an owl with his
bulging eyes, stuck-out chest, the stolid apoplectic purple of
his swollen face, while little children looked at him with
frightened eyes, their mothers with a glance of nervous
apprehension, and the men in all the various attitudes of
gape-jawed astonishment and stupefaction. Yet, at that time, he
saw nothing strange or curious in this mad behaviour. Rather, to
hold his breath there in the tunnel's dark, to make that mystery
of rite and number, and to follow it with a maniacal devotion
seemed as inevitable and natural to him as the very act of life,
of breath itself, and he was sometimes bitterly incensed when
people stared at him because of it.</p>

<p>Those faces--the secret, dark, unknown, nameless faces, the
faces of the million instant casual meetings of these years, in
the cars of subway trains or on the swarming streets--returned in
later years to haunt him with a blazing, unforgettable intensity
of vision, with an overwhelming sense of strangeness, loss and
sorrow, a poignancy of familiarity, affection and regret, which
was somehow, unbelievably, as wordless, grievous, full of an
instant rending and unfathomable pity, as those things a man has
known best and loved with all the life and passion in him, and
has lost for ever--a child's quick laugh of innocence and
exultant mirth, a woman's smile, an intonation in her voice, the
naked, child-like look remembered in the eyes of simple, faithful
people who have gone, or the snatches of the song one's brother
sang when he lay drowned in darkness and delirium, as he
died.</p>

<p>Why did the unknown faces of these years come back to him? For
he could not forget the million obscure faces of those first
years of his wandering when for the first time he walked alone
the streets of a great city, a madman, a beggar, and a king,
feeling the huge joy of the secret world impending over him with
all the glory of its magic imminence, and when each furious prowl
and quest into the swarming streets of life, each furious journey
through the tunnel's depth was living with the intolerable
prescience of triumph and discovery--a life more happy,
fortunate, golden and complete than any life before had ever
been.</p>

<p>He did not know. He never knew why all those obscure, nameless
and unknown faces of a million strangers who passed and vanished
in an instant from his sight, or whom he passed a hundred times
upon the streets without a word or sign of recognition, should
return to haunt him later with a sense of loss, affection, and
the familiarity of utter knowledge. But he knew that they came
back to him in images of unfading brightness, and that the light
of time, dark time, was on them all, and that there was revealed
to him, in later years, something strange and mad and lonely in
the lives of all of them, which he had accepted instantly, and
felt no wonder or surprise at, when he had seen them.</p>

<p>But these images of the past would come back in later years,
and with a feeling of bitter loss and longing he would want to
find, to see, to know them all again, to ask them what their
lives had been, and what had happened to them. It was a weird,
strange, assorted crew--that company of memory--on whom the light
of time would fall with such a lonely hue, and how they were all
got together in that magic consonance he could never tell, but he
could not forget them.</p>

<p>One was an old man, an old man with fierce restless eyes, and
bedraggled moustaches of a stained tobacco yellow who kept a
lodging-house where a student that he knew had rooms, and whose
house, from the basement to the attic, was a museum to the old
man's single mania. For that house was crowded with old tottering
stacks of books, a mountain of junk, uncounted and uncountable, a
weariness and desolation of old print, dusty, yellowed, and
unreadable--and all were memoirs of a single man, Napoleon.</p>

<p>Another was a woman with a mass of henna hair, piled up in a
great crown upon her head, who sat smugly, day after day, like
something ageless and embalmed, a presence deathless and hermetic
to all the things that change and pass, in a glass cage before a
moving-picture house on Washington Street, where people thronged
in the dense and narrow line before her all the time, and glass
steps and a rotating stairway went steeply up beside her cage,
and flashing cascades of bright water foamed and tumbled
underneath the glassy stairs, as the woman with piled henna hair
sat always in her cage, deathless, smug, hermetic, and
embalmed.</p>

<p>Another was an old man with a mad, fierce, handsome face and
wild strewn hair of silvery white, who never wore a hat or
overcoat, and who muttered through the streets of Cambridge, over
the board walks of the Harvard Yard, in every kind of weather;
winter was around him always, the rugged skies of wintry sunsets,
red and harsh, the frozen desolation of old snow in street and
Yard and gutter, the harsh, interminable, weary savagery of grey
winter.</p>

<p>One was a waitress in a restaurant on Tremont Street, a woman
quiet, decent, and demure in manner, who wore faintly on her lips
continually the most sensual, tender, and seductive mystery of a
smile that he had ever seen on any woman's face, who drew him
back into that place to eat a thousand times, who made him think
of her at night, and prowl the streets and think of her, and go
back to that restaurant night after night, with a feeling of wild
joy and imminent possession when he thought of her, and yet who
said, did, promised nothing that was not sedate, decent, and
correct, or that could give him comfort, hope, or knowledge of
her life.</p>

<p>He never got to know her, he never even knew her name, some
secrecy and pride in him prevented him from speaking to her with
familiar warmth or curiosity, but he spent thousands of good
hours in thinking of her--hours filled with all the passion,
dreams, and longing youth can know. The woman was no longer
young; the other waitresses were younger, fresher,
better-looking, had better legs and finer figures; he had no way
at all of knowing the quality of her life, mind, spirit,
speech--save that when he heard her speak her voice was a little
husky and coarse-fibred--but that woman became the central figure
of one of those glittering and impossible fantasies young men
have.</p>

<p>It was a great legend of wealth and fame and love and glory in
which this woman lived as a creature of queenly beauty, delicacy,
intelligence, and grandeur of the soul--and every obstacle of
cold and acid fact that interposed itself between him and his
vision he would instantly destroy by the wild fantastic logic of
desire.</p>

<p>And because of her he prowled a hundred streets, and walked
three thousand miles, and ate one thousand sirloin steaks in that
one restaurant. He would wait for night to come with furious
impatience, and would feel his hands grow weak, his entrails
numb, his heart begin to pound, and his throat to swell with this
intolerable exultancy of joy as he approached the restaurant.
Then when he got inside, and had gone upstairs to where the
restaurant was, his whole body would be stirred with such a
shifting iridescence of passion, happiness, hunger, triumph,
music, and wild exuberant humour that he felt he could no longer
hold the swelling power of ecstasy that he felt in him.</p>

<p>Everything in the restaurant would become impossibly good,
wonderful, and happy. The beautifully clean, crisply-waisted, and
voluptuous-looking waitresses would be passing all around him
bearing trays of food, the empress of his desire would pass by
clean and neat and dainty, sedate and decent and demure, smiling
that proud, smoke-like, faint, ghost-phantom smile of maddening
tenderness and seduction, the three-piece orchestra would be
playing briskly, softly, languorously, strains of popular music,
filling his heart with the swelling p&aelig;ans of another,
prouder, grander, more triumphant music; while he listened, some
robust, handsome, clear-eyed and lusty-figured New England girls
would be sitting at a table, smartly, roughly dressed, their fine
legs clothed with woollen stockings, their feet shod with
wide-open galoshes, looking almost ripe for love and tenderness
if something could be done to them--and all of this spurred his
hunger with a kind of maddening relish, and made the food taste
better than any he had ever had before.</p>

<p>Everything he saw would fill him with haunting sorrow, hunger,
joy, the sense of triumph, glory, and delight, or with a
limitless exuberance of wild humour. The motto of the restaurant,
fixed on the wall in shields embossed with a flamboyant coat of
arms, was written in a scroll beneath the coat of arms, as
follows: "Luxuria cum Economia." The effect these words wrought
on his spirit was unbelievable: he could never say what he wished
to say, or what he felt about them, and to say that they were
"the funniest words he ever saw" would not begin to convey their
real effect on him.</p>

<p>For what they did to him was so far beyond mere funniness that
he had no name to give to the emotion they evoked. But instantly,
when he saw them, the wild wordless surge of a powerful and
idiotic exuberance of humour would swell up in him and split his
features with an exultant grin.</p>

<p>He would want to roar with laughter, to shout out and pound
upon the table in his joy, but instead the wild voices of a
goat-like exuberance would swell up in his throat until the
people at the other tables would begin to stare at him as if he
had gone mad. And later, on the streets, or in his room at night,
he would suddenly remember them again, and then that idiotic,
wordless, and exultant glee would burst out of him in one roar of
joy.</p>

<p>Yet the words gave him a strange happiness and content as
well. He felt a feeling of tenderness for the people who had
written them, for the owners of the restaurant who had solemnly
and triumphantly thought them out, for all the doctrines of
"taste," "class," and "refinement" they evoked, for something
mistaken and most pitiful that had got into our lives, and that
was everywhere, something grotesquely wrong, ridiculous and
confused that made one somehow feel a warm, a wordless affection
for its victims.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>But this was the reason why these things could never be
forgotten--because we are so lost, so naked and so lonely in
America. Immense and cruel skies bend over us, and all of us are
driven on for ever and we have no home. Therefore, it is not the
slow, the punctual sanded drip of the unnumbered days that we
remember best, the ash of time; nor is it the huge monotone of
the lost years, the unswerving schedules of the lost life and the
well-known faces, that we remember best. It is a face seen once
and lost for ever in a crowd, an eye that looked, a face that
smiled and vanished on a passing train, it is a prescience of
snow upon a certain night, the laughter of a woman in a summer
street long years ago, it is the memory of a single moon seen at
the pine's dark edge in old October--and all of our lives is
written in the twisting of a leaf upon a bough, a door that
opened, and a stone.</p>

<p>For America has a thousand lights and weathers and we walk the
streets, we walk the streets for ever, we walk the streets of
life alone.</p>

<p>It is the place of the howling winds, the hurrying of the
leaves in old October, the hard clean falling to the earth of
acorns. The place of the storm-tossed moaning of the wintry
mountain-side, where the young men cry out in their throats and
feel the savage vigour, the rude strong energies; the place also
where the trains cross rivers.</p>

<p>It is a fabulous country, the only fabulous country; it is the
one place where miracles not only happen, but where they happen
all the time.</p>

<p>It is the place of exultancy and strong joy, the place of the
darkened brooding air, the smell of snow; it is the place of all
the fierce, the bitten colours in October, when all of the wild,
sweet woods flame up; it is also the place of the cider press and
the last brown oozings of the York Imperials. It is the place of
the lovely girls with good jobs and the husky voices, who will
buy a round of drinks; it is the place where the women with fine
legs and silken underwear lie in the Pullman berth below you; it
is the place of the dark-green snore of the Pullman cars and the
voices in the night-time in Virginia.</p>

<p>It is the place where great boats are baying at the harbour's
mouth, where great ships are putting out to sea; it is the place
where great boats are blowing in the gulf of night, and where the
river, the dark and secret river, full of strange time, is for
ever flowing by us to the sea.</p>

<p><i>The tugs keep baying in the river; at twelve o'clock
the</i> Berengaria <i>moans, her lights slide gently past the
piers beyond Eleventh Street; and in the night a tall tree falls
in Old Catawba, there in the hills of home.</i></p>

<p>It is the place of autumnal moons hung low and orange at the
frosty edges of the pines; it is the place of frost and silence,
of the clean dry shocks and the opulence of enormous pumpkins
that yellow on hard dotted earth; it is the place of the stir and
feathery stumble of the hens upon their roost, the frosty, broken
barking of the dogs, the great barn-shapes and solid shadows in
the running sweep of the moon-whited countryside, the wailing
whistle of the fast express. It is the place of flares and
steamings on the tracks, and the swing and bob and tottering
dance of lanterns in the yards; it is the place of dings and
knellings and the sudden glare of mighty engines over sleeping
faces in the night; it is the place of the terrific web and
spread and smouldering, the distant glare of Philadelphia and the
solid rumble of the sleepers; it is also the place where the
Transcontinental Limited is stroking eighty miles an hour across
the continent and the small dark towns whip by like bullets, and
there is only the fanlike stroke of the secret, immense and
lonely earth again.</p>

<p><i>I have foreseen this picture many times: I will buy passage
on the Fast Express.</i></p>

<p>It is the place of the wild and exultant winter's morning and
the wind, with the powdery snow, that has been howling all night
long; it is the place of solitude and the branches of the spruce
and hemlock piled with snow; it is the place where the Fall River
boats are tethered to the wharf, and the wild grey snow of
furious, secret, and storm-whited morning whips across them. It
is the place of the lodge by the frozen lake and the sweet breath
and amorous flesh of sinful woman; it is the place of the tragic
and lonely beauty of New England; it is the place of the red barn
and the sound of the stabled hooves and of bright tatters of old
circus posters; it is the place of the immense and pungent smell
of breakfast, the country sausages and the ham and eggs, the
smoking wheat cakes and the fragrant coffee, and of lone hunters
in the frosty thickets who whistle to their lop-eared hounds.</p>

<p><i>Where is old Doctor Ballard now with all his dogs? He held
that they were sacred, that the souls of all the dear lost dead
went into them. His youngest sister's soul sat on the seat beside
him; she had long ears and her eyes were sad. Two dozen of his
other cherished dead trotted around the buggy as he went up the
hill past home. And that was eleven years ago, and I was nine
years old; and I stared gravely out of the window of my father's
house at old Doctor Ballard.</i></p>

<p>It is the place of the straight stare, the cold white bellies
and the buried lust of the lovely Boston girls; it is the place
of ripe brainless blondes with tender lips and a flowery smell,
and of the girls with shapely arms who stand on ladders picking
oranges; it is also the place where large slow-bodied girls from
Kansas City, with big legs and milky flesh, are sent East to
school by their rich fathers, and there are also immense and
lovely girls, with the grip of a passionate bear, who have such
names as Neilson, Lundquist, Jorgenson, and Brandt.</p>

<p><i>I will go up and down the country, and back and forth
across the country on the great trains that thunder over America.
I will go out West where States are square; Oh, I will go to
Boise, and Helena and Albuquerque. I will go to Montana and the
two Dakotas and the unknown places.</i></p>

<p>It is the place of violence and sudden death; of the fast
shots in the night, the club of the Irish cop, and the smell of
brains and blood upon the pavement; it is the place of the
small-town killings, and the men who shoot the lovers of their
wives; it is the place where the negroes slash with razors and
the hillmen kill in the mountain meadows; it is the place of the
ugly drunks and the snarling voices and of foul-mouthed men who
want to fight; it is the place of the loud word and the foolish
boast and the violent threat; it is also the place of the deadly
little men with white faces and the eyes of reptiles, who kill
quickly and casually in the dark; it is the lawless land that
feeds on murder.</p>

<p><i>"Did you know the two Lipe girls?" he asked. "Yes," I said.
"They lived in Biltburn by the river, and one of them was drowned
in the flood. She was a cripple, and she wheeled herself along in
a chair. She was strong as a bull." "That's the girl," he
said.</i></p>

<p>It is the place of the crack athletes and of the runners who
limber up in March; it is the place of the ten-second men and the
great jumpers and vaulters; it is the place where spring comes,
and the young birch trees have white and tender barks, of the
thaw of the earth, and the feathery smoke of the trees; it is the
place of the burst of grass and bud, the wild and sudden
tenderness of the wilderness, and of the crews out on the river
and the coaches coming down behind them in the motor-boats, the
surges rolling out behind when they are gone with heavy sudden
wash. It is the place of the baseball players, and the easy lob,
the soft spring smackings of the glove and mit, the crack of the
bat; it is the place of the great batters, fielders, and
pitchers, of the nigger boys and the white, drawling,
shirt-sleeved men, the bleachers and the resinous smell of old
worn wood; it is the place of Rube Waddell, the mighty untamed
and ill-fated pitcher when his left arm is swinging like a lash.
It is the place of the fighters, the crafty Jewish lightweights
and the mauling Italians, Leonard, Tendler, Rocky Kansas, and
Dundee; it is the place where the champion looks over his rival's
shoulder with a bored expression.</p>

<p><i>I shall wake at morning in a foreign land thinking I heard
a horse in one of the streets of home.</i></p>

<p>It is the place where they like to win always, and boast about
their victories; it is the place of quick money and sudden loss;
it is the place of the mile-long freights with their strong,
solid, clanking, heavy loneliness at night, and of the silent
freight of cars that curve away among raw piny desolations with
their promise of new lands and unknown distances--the huge
attentive gape of emptiness. It is the place where the bums come
singly from the woods at sunset, the huge stillness of the
water-tower, the fading light, the rails, secret and alive,
trembling with the oncoming train; it is the place of the great
tramps, Oklahoma Red, Fargo Pete, and the Jersey Dutchman, who
grab fast rattlers for the Western shore; it is the place of old
blown bums who come up in October skirls of dust and wind and
crumpled newspapers and beg, with canned heat on their breaths:
"Help Old McGuire: McGuire's a good guy, kid. You're not so
tough, kid: McGuire's your pal, kid: How about McGuire,
McGuire--?"</p>

<p>It is the place of the pool-room players and the drug-store
boys; of the town whore and her paramour, the tough town driver;
it is the place where they go to the woods on Sunday and get up
among the laurel and dogwood bushes and the rhododendron
blossoms; it is the place of the cheap hotels and the kids who
wait with chattering lips while the nigger goes to get them their
first woman; it is the place of the drunken college boys who
spend the old man's money and wear fur coats to the football
games; it is the place of the lovely girls up North who have rich
fathers, of the beautiful wives of business men.</p>

<p><i>The train broke down somewhere beyond Manassas, and I went
forward along the tracks with all the other passengers. "What's
the matter?" I said to the engineer. "The eccentric strap is
broken, son," he said. It was a very cold day, windy and full of
sparkling sun. This was the farthest north I'd ever been, and I
was twelve years old and on my way to Washington to see Woodrow
Wilson inaugurated. Later I could not forget the face of the
engineer and the words "eccentric strap."</i></p>

<p>It is the place of the immense and lonely earth, the place of
fat ears and abundance where they grow cotton, corn, and wheat,
the wine-red apples of October, and the good tobacco.</p>

<p>It is the place that is savage and cruel, but it is also the
innocent place; it is the wild lawless place, the vital earth
that is soaked with the blood of the murdered men, with the blood
of the countless murdered men, with the blood of the unavenged
and unremembered murdered men; but it is also the place of the
child and laughter, where the young men are torn apart with
ecstasy, and cry out in their throats with joy, where they hear
the howl of the wind and the rain and smell the thunder and the
soft numb spitting of the snow, where they are drunk with the
bite and sparkle of the air and mad with the solar energy, where
they believe in love and victory and think that they can never
die.</p>

<p>It is the place where you come up through Virginia on the
great trains in the night-time, and rumble slowly across the wide
Potomac and see the morning sunlight on the nation's dome at
Washington, and where the fat man shaving in the Pullman washroom
grunts, "What's this? What's this we're coming
to--Washington?"--And the thin man glancing out of the window
says, "Yep, this is Washington. That's what it is, all right. You
gettin' off here?"--And where the fat man grunts, "Who--me?
Naw--I'm goin' on to Baltimore." It is the place where you get
off at Baltimore and find your brother waiting.</p>

<p><i>Where is my father sleeping on the land? Buried? Dead these
seven years? Forgotten, rotten in the ground? Held by his own
great stone? No, no! Will I say "Father" when I come to him? And
will he call me "Son"? Oh, no, he'll never see my face; we'll
never speak except to say--</i></p>

<p>It is the place of the fast approach, the hot blind smoky
passage, the tragic lonely beauty of New England, and the web of
Boston; the place of the mighty station there, and engines
passive as great cats, the straight dense plumes of engine smoke,
the acrid and exciting smell of trains and stations, and of the
man-swarm passing ever in its million-footed weft, the smell of
the sea in harbours and the thought of voyages--and the place of
the goat-cry, the strong joy of our youth, the magic city, when
we knew the most fortunate life on earth would certainly be ours,
that we were twenty and could never die.</p>

<p>And always America is the place of the deathless and
enraptured moments, the eye that looked, the mouth that smiled
and vanished, and the word; the stone, the leaf, the door we
never found and never have forgotten. And these are the things
that we remember of America, for we have known all her thousand
lights and weathers, and we walk the streets, we walk the streets
for ever, we walk the streets of life alone.</p>

<h1>XV</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Now at Cambridge, in the house of the Murphys on Trowbridge
Street, he found himself living with the Irish for the first
time, and he discovered that the Murphys were utterly different
from all the Irish he had known before, and all that he had felt
and believed about them. He soon discovered that the Murphys were
a typical family of the Boston Irish. It was a family of five:
there were Mr. and Mrs. Murphy, two sons and a daughter. Mrs.
Murphy ran the house on Trowbridge Street, which they owned, and
rented the rooms to lodgers, Mr. Murphy was night watchman in a
warehouse on the Boston water-front, the girl was a typist in an
Irish business house in Boston, the older boy, Jimmy, had a
clerical position in the Boston City Hall, and the youngest boy,
Eddy, whom the youth knew best, was a student at Boston College.
In addition there were two Irish lodgers who had lived with them
for years: Mr. Feeney, a young man who worked at Raymond's, a
department store in Washington Street, Boston, and Mr. O'Doul, a
middle-aged man, unmarried, who occupied the front room upstairs
just over the boy's own room. Mr. O'Doul was a civil engineer, he
drank very heavily, and he would sometimes be confined to his bed
for days at a time with terrible attacks of rheumatism which
would bend, gnarl, and twist him, and render him incapable of
movement.</p>

<p>But in the Murphys the boy discovered none of the richness,
wildness, extravagance, and humour of such people as Mike
Fogarty, Tim Donovan, or the MacReadys--the Irish he had known at
home. The Murphys were hard, sterile, arid, meagre, and cruel:
they were disfigured by a warped and infuriated puritanism, and
yet they were terribly corrupt. There was nothing warm, rich, or
generous about them or their lives: it seemed as if the living
roots of nature had grown gnarled and barren among the walls and
pavements of the city; it seemed that everything that is wild,
sudden, capricious, whimsical, passionate, and mysterious in the
spirit of the race had been dried and hardened out of them by
their divorce from the magical earth their fathers came from, as
if the snarl and jangle of the city streets, the barren and
earthless angularity of steel and stone and brick had entered
their souls. Even their speech had become hard, grey, and
sterile: the people were almost inarticulate; it is doubtful if
one of them had three hundred words in his vocabulary: the boy
noticed that the men especially--Murphy, his two sons, Feeney,
and O'Doul--made constant use of a few arid words and phrases,
which, with the intonation of the voice and a slight convulsive
movement of the arms and hands, filled in enormous vacancies in
thought and feeling, and said all that they could say or wished
to say. Chief among these words or phrases was <i>"You</i>
know?". . . or <i>"You</i> know what I mean?"--words which were
uttered with a slight protesting emphasis on "You," a slight and
painful movement of the hands or shoulders, and an air that the
listener must fill in for himself all that they wanted to imply.
For epithets of rich resounding rage, for curses thick and
opulent with fury, in which he had believed their tongues were
apt and their spirits prodigal, he discovered that they had no
more to offer than "Chee!" or "Jeez!" or "Ho-ly Jeez!" or
"Christ!" or <i>"Ho</i>-ly Christ!" or occasionally <i>"Ho</i>-ly
Mary!" Finally, they made a constant and stupefying use of that
terrible grey abortion of a word "guy": it studded their speech
with the numberless monotony of paving brick; without it they
would have been completely speechless and would have had to
communicate by convulsions of their arms and hands and painful
croakings from their tongueless throats--the word fell upon the
spirit of the listener with the grey weariness of a cold
incessant drizzle; it flowed across the spirit like a river of
concrete; hope, joy; the power to feel and think were drowned out
under the relentless and pitiless aridity of its flood.</p>

<p>At first, he thought these words and phrases were part of a
meagre but sufficient pattern which they had learned in order to
meet the contingencies of life and business with alien and
Protestant spirits, as waiters in European caf&eacute;'s,
restaurants, and dining-cars will learn a few words of English in
order to serve the needs of British and American tourists--he
thought this because he saw something sly, closed,
conspiratorial, mocking and full of hatred and mistrust, in their
relations with people who were not members of their race and
their religion; he thought they had a warm, secret and passionate
life of their own which never could be known by a stranger. But
he soon found that this belief was untrue: even in their
conversations with one another, they were almost inarticulate--a
race which thought, felt, and spoke with the wooden insensitivity
of automatons or dummies on whose waxen souls a few banal
formulas for speech and feeling had been recorded. He heard some
amazing performances: every evening toward six o'clock the family
would gather in their dingy living-room at the end of the hall,
Mr. Feeney and Mr. O'Doul would join them, and then he could hear
the voices of the men raised in argument, protest, agreement,
denial, affirmation and belief, or scepticism, evoking a ghastly
travesty of all of man's living moments of faith, doubt, and
passion, and yet speaking for hours at a time, with the idiotic
repetitions of a gramophone held by its needle to a single
groove, a blunted jargon of fifty meaningless words:</p>

<p>"What guy?"</p>

<p><i>"Dat</i> guy!"</p>

<p>"Nah, nah, nah, not him--duh otheh guy!"</p>

<p>"Wich guy do yuh mean--duh big guy?"</p>

<p>"Nah, nah, nah--yuh got it all wrong!--Not <i>him</i>--duh
little guy!"</p>

<p>"Guh-<i>wan!"</i>--a derisive laugh--"Guh-wan!"</p>

<p>"Watcha tryin' t' do--<i>kid</i> me? Dat guy neveh saw de day
he could take Grogan. Grogan 'ud bat his brains out."</p>

<p>"Guh-<i>wan!</i> Yer full of prunes! . . . Watcha tryin' t'
give me? Dat guy 'ud neveh take Tommy Grogan in a million yeahs!
He couldn't take Tommy duh best day he eveh saw! Grogan 'ud have
him on de floeh in thirty seconds!"</p>

<p><i>"Ho</i>-ly Ghee!"</p>

<p>"Sure he would!"</p>

<p>"Guh-<i>wan</i>, Guh-<i>wan</i>! Yer <i>crazy</i>! <i>Grogan!
Ho</i>-ly Ghee!"</p>

<p>And this, with laughter, denial, agreement--all the
appurtenances of conversation among living men--could go on
unweariedly for hours at a time.</p>

<p>Sometimes he would interrupt these conversations for a moment:
he would go back to leave a message, to pay the rent, to ask if
anyone had called.</p>

<p>As soon as he knocked, the voices would stop abruptly, the
room would grow suddenly hushed, there would be whispers and a
dry snickering laughter: in a moment someone would say "Come in,"
and he would enter a room full of hushed and suddenly
straightened faces. The men would sit quietly or say a word or
two of greeting, friendly enough in appearance, but swift sly
looks would pass between them, and around the corners of their
thin, hard mouths there would be something loose, corrupt and
mocking. Mrs. Murphy would rise and come to greet him, her voice
filled with a false heartiness, an unclean courtesy, a horrible
and insolent travesty of friendliness, and her face would also
have the look of having been suddenly straightened out and
solemnly compressed; she would listen with a kind of evil
attention, but she would have the same loose, mocking look, and
the quiet sly look would pass between her and the others. Then,
when he had left them and the door had closed behind him, there
would be the same sly silence for a moment, then a low muttering
of words, a sudden violence of hard derisive laughter, and
someone saying, "<i>Ho</i>-ly Jeez!"</p>

<p>He despised them: he loathed them because they were dull,
dirty, and dishonest, because their lives were stupid, barren,
and ugly, for their deliberate and insolent unfriendliness and
for the conspiratorial secrecy and closure of their petty and
vicious lives, entrenched solidly behind a wall of violent and
corrupt politics and religious fanaticism, and regarding the
alien, the stranger, with the hostile and ignorant eyes of the
peasant.</p>

<p>All of the men had a dry, meagre, and brutal quality: Mr.
Murphy was a little man with a dry, corky figure; he had a grey
face, a thin sunken mouth, around which the line of loose mockery
was always playing, and a closely cropped grey moustache. The boy
always found him in his shirt-sleeves, with his shoes off and his
stockinged feet thrust out upon a chair. Feeney, O'Doul, Jimmy
and Eddy Murphy, although of various sizes, shapes, and ages, all
had thick tallowy-looking skins, hard dull eyes and a way of
speaking meagrely out of the corners of their loose thin mouths.
Mrs. Murphy was physically the biggest of the lot, with a certain
quality of ripeness and fertility, however blighted, that none of
the others had: she was a large slatternly woman, with silvery
white hair which gave her somehow a look of sly and sinister
haggishness; she had a high, flaming colour marked with patches
of eczematous red, her voice was hearty and she had a big laugh,
but her face also had the false, hostile and conspiratorial
secrecy of the others.</p>

<p>Eddy Murphy, the youngest boy, was also the best of the crowd.
All decent and generous impulse had not yet been killed or
deadened in him; he still possessed a warped and blunted
friendliness, the rudiments of some youthful feeling for a
better, warmer, bolder, and more liberal kind of life. As time
went on, he made a few awkward, shamed, and inarticulate advances
toward friendship; he began to come into the young man's room
from time to time, and presently to tell him a little of his life
at college and his hopes for the future. He was a little fellow,
with the same dry, febrile, alert, and corky figure that his
father had: he was one of the dark Irish; he had black hair and
black eyes, and one of his legs was badly bowed and bent outward,
the result, he said, of having broken it in a high-school
football game. The first time he came into the room he stood
around shyly, awkwardly, and mistrustfully for a spell, blurting
out a few words from time to time, and looking at the books and
papers with a kind of dazed and stricken stupefaction.</p>

<p>"Watcha do wit all dese books? Huh?"</p>

<p>"I read them."</p>

<p>"Guh-<i>wan</i>! Watcha tryin' t' hand me? Y' ain't read all
dem books! Dey ain't no guy dat's read dat much."</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, there were only two or three hundred
books in the place, but he could not have been more impressed if
the entire contents of the Widener Library had been stored
there.</p>

<p>"Well, I have read them all," the other said. "Most of them,
anyway, and a lot more besides."</p>

<p>"Guh-<i>wan!</i> No kiddin'!" he said, in a dazed tone and
with an air of astounded disbelief. "Watcha want to read so much
for?"</p>

<p>"I like to read. Don't you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know. <i>You</i> know," he said painfully, with
the slightest convulsive movement of his hands and shoulders. ".
. . 'S'all right."</p>

<p>"You have to read for your classes at Boston College, don't
you?"</p>

<p><i>"DO</i> I?" he cried, with a sudden waking to life. "I'll
say I do! . . . <i>Ho</i>-ly Chee! Duh way dose guys pile it on
to you is a <i>crime!"</i></p>

<p>There was another awkward silence; he continued to stare at
the books and to fumble about in an embarrassed and tongue-tied
manner, and suddenly he burst out explosively and triumphantly:
"Shakespeare was de greatest poet dat evah lived. He wrote plays
an' sonnets. A sonnet is a pome of foihteen lines: it is composed
of two pahts, de sextet an' de octrave."</p>

<p>"That's pretty good. They must make you work out there?"</p>

<p><i>"DO</i> they?" he cried. "I'll tell duh cock-eyed world dey
do! . . . Do you know who de greatest prose-writeh was?" he burst
out with the same convulsive suddenness.</p>

<p>"No . . . who was it? Jonathan Swift?"</p>

<p>"Guh-<i>wan!"</i></p>

<p>"Addison? . . . Dryden? . . . Matthew Arnold?" the youth asked
hopefully.</p>

<p>"Guh-<i>wan</i>, Guh-<i>wan</i>!<i>"</i> he shouted
derisively. "Yuh're way off!"</p>

<p>"Am I? . . . Who was it then?"</p>

<p>"James Henry Cardinal Nooman," he crowed triumphantly. "Dat's
who it was! . . . Father Dolan said so. . . . Chee! . . . Dey
ain't nuttin' dat guy don't know! He's duh greatest English
scholeh livin'! . . . Nooman wrote de <i>Apologia pro Vita
Suo,"</i> he said triumphantly. "Dat's Latin."</p>

<p>"Well, yes, he <i>is</i> a good writer," said the other boy.
"But Thomas Carlyle is a good writer, too?" he proposed
argumentatively.</p>

<p>"Guh-<i>wan!"</i> shouted Eddy derisively. "Watcha givin' me?"
He was silent a moment; then he added with a grin, "Yuh know de
reason why you say dat?"</p>

<p>"No, why?"</p>

<p>"It's because yuh're a Sout'paw," and suddenly he laughed,
naturally and good-naturedly.</p>

<p>"A Southpaw? How do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Oh, dat's duh name de fellows call 'em out at school," he
said.</p>

<p>"Call who?"</p>

<p>"Why, guys like you," he said. "Dat's de name we call duh
Protestants," he said, laughing. "We call 'em Sout'paws."</p>

<p>The word in its connotation of a life that was hostile, hard,
fanatic, and suspicious of everything alien to itself was
disgraceful and shameful, but there was something irresistibly
funny about it too, and suddenly they both laughed loudly.</p>

<p>After that, they got along together much better: Eddy came in
to see the other youth quite often, he talked more freely and
naturally, and sometimes he would bring his English themes and
ask for help with them.</p>

<p>Such were the Boston Irish as he first saw them; and often as
he thought of the wild, extravagant and liberal creatures of his
childhood--of Mr. Fogarty, Tim Donovan, and the MacReadys--it
seemed to him that they belonged to a grander and completely
different race; or perhaps, he thought, the glory of earth and
air and sky there had kept them ripe and sweet as they always
were, while their brothers here had withered upon the rootless
pavements, soured and sickened in the savage tumult of the
streets, grown hard and dead and ugly in the barren land.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>The only person near him in the house, and the only person
there the boy saw with any regularity was a Chinese student named
Wang: he had the room next to him--in fact, he had the two next
rooms, for he was immensely rich, the son of a man in the
mandarin class who governed one of the Chinese provinces.</p>

<p>But his habits and conduct were in marked contrast to those of
the average Oriental who attends an American university. These
others, studious seekers after knowledge, had come to work. Mr.
Wang, a lazy and good-humoured wastrel with more money than he
could spend, had come to play. And play he did, with a
whole-hearted devotion to pleasure that was worthy of a better
purpose. His pleasures were for the most part simple, but they
were also costly, running to flowered-silk dressing gowns,
expensively tailored clothes cut in a rakish Broadway style, silk
shirts, five-pound boxes of chocolate creams, of which he was
inordinately fond, week-end trips to New York, stupendous
banquets at an expensive Chinese restaurant in Boston, phonograph
records, of which he had a great many, and the companionship of
"nice flat girls"--by this he meant to say his women should be
"fat," which apparently was the primary requisite for voluptuous
pulchritude.</p>

<p>Mr. Wang himself was just a fat, stupid, indolent, and
good-hearted child: his two big rooms in the rear of the Murphy
establishment were lavishly furnished with carved teak-wood,
magnificent screens, fat divans, couches, and chests. The rooms
were always lighted with the glow of dim and sensual lamps, there
was always an odour of sandalwood and incense, and from time to
time one heard Mr. Wang's shrill sudden scream of childish
laughter. He had two cronies, young Chinese who seemed as idle,
wealthy, and pleasure-loving as himself; they came to his rooms
every night, and then one could hear them jabbering and
chattering away in their strange speech, and sometimes silence,
low eager whisperings, and then screams of laughter.</p>

<p>The boy had grown to know the Chinese very well; Mr. Wang had
come to him to seek help on his English composition themes--he
was not only stupid but thoroughly idle, and would not work at
anything--and the boy had written several for him. And Mr. Wang,
in grateful recompense, had taken him several times to
magnificent dinners of strange delicious foods in the Chinese
restaurant, and was for ever urging on him chocolates and
expensive cigarettes. And no matter where the Chinaman saw him
now, whether in his room, or on the street, or in the Harvard
Yard, he would always greet him with one joke--a joke he repeated
over and over with the unwearied delight of a child or an idiot.
And the joke was this: Mr. Wang would come up slyly, his fat
yellow face already beginning to work, his fat throat beginning
to tremble with hysterical laughter. Then, wagging his finger at
the young American, the Chinaman would say:</p>

<p>"Lest night I see you with big flat girl. . . . Yis, yis,
yis," he would scream with laughter as the young man started to
protest, shaping voluptuous curves meanwhile with his fat yellow
hands--"Big flat girl--like this--yis, yis, yis!" he would scream
again, and bend double, choking, stamping at the ground, "nice
flat girl--like this--yis, yis, yis, yis, yis."</p>

<p>He had perpetrated this "joke" so often, and at such
unseasonable places, that it had now become embarrassing. He
seemed, in fact, to delight in coming upon his victim while he
was in serious conversation with some dignified-looking person,
and he had already caught the boy three times in this way while
he was talking to Dodd, to Professor Hatcher, and finally to a
professor with a starched prim face, who had taught American
Literature for thirty years, and whose name was Fust. Nothing
could be done to stop him; protests at the impropriety of the
proceeding only served to set him off again; he was delighted at
the embarrassment he caused and he would shout down every protest
rapturously, screaming, "Yis, yis, yis--nice flat girl--like
this, eh," and would shape fat suggestion with his fat hands.</p>

<p> </p>

<h1>XVI</h1>

<p> </p>

<p>The purposes of Professor Hatcher's celebrated school for
dramatists seemed, as stated, to be plain and reasonable enough.
Professor Hatcher himself prudently forbore from making
extravagant claims concerning the benefits to be derived from his
course. He did not say that he could make a dramatist out of any
man who came to take his course. He did not predict a successful
career in the professional theatre for every student who had been
a member of his class. He did not even say he could teach a
student how to write plays. No. He made, in fact, no claims at
all. Whatever he said about his course was very reasonably,
prudently, and temperately put: it was impossible to quarrel with
it.</p>

<p>All Professor Hatcher said about his course was that, if a man
had a genuine dramatic and theatrical talent to begin with, he
might be able to derive from the course a technical and critical
guidance which it would be hard for him to get elsewhere, and
which he might find for himself only after years of painful and
even wasteful experiment.</p>

<p>Certainly this seemed reasonable enough. Moreover, Professor
Hatcher felt that the artist would benefit by what was known as
the "round-table discussion"--that is, by the comment and
criticism of the various members of the class, after Professor
Hatcher had read them a play written by one of their group. He
felt that the spirit of working together, of seeing one's play
produced and assisting in the production, of being familiar with
all the various arts of the theatre--lighting, designing,
directing, acting, and so on--was an experience which should be
of immense value to the young dramatist of promise and of talent.
In short, although he made no assertion that he could create a
talent where none was, or give life by technical expertness to
the substance of a work that had no real life of its own,
Professor Hatcher did feel that by the beneficent influence of
this tutelage he might trim the true lamp to make it burn more
brightly.</p>

<p>And though it was possible to join issue with him on some of
his beliefs--that, for example, the comment and criticism of "the
group" and a community of creative spirits were good for the
artist--it was impossible to deny that his argument was
reasonable, temperate, and conservative in the statement of his
purposes.</p>

<p>And he made this plain to every member of his class. Each one
was made to understand that the course made no claims of magic
alchemy--that he could not be turned into an interesting
dramatist if the talent were not there.</p>

<p>But although each member of the class affirmed his
understanding of this fundamental truth, and readily said that he
accepted it, most of these people, at the bottom of their hearts,
believed--pitiably and past belief--that a miracle would be
wrought upon their sterile, unproductive spirits; that for them,
for <i>them,</i> at least, a magic transformation would be
brought about in their miserable small lives and feeble
purposes--and all because they now were members of Professor
Hatcher's celebrated class.</p>

<p>The members of Professor Hatcher's class belonged to the whole
lost family of the earth, whose number is uncountable, and for
this reason they could never be forgotten.</p>

<p>And, first and foremost, they belonged to that great lost
tribe of people who are more numerous in America than in any
other country in the world. They belonged to that unnumbered
horde who think that somehow, by some magic and miraculous scheme
or rule or formula, "something can be done for them." They
belonged to that huge colony of the damned who buy thousands of
books that are printed for their kind, telling them how to run a
tea-shop, how to develop a pleasing personality, how to acquire
"a liberal education," swiftly and easily and with no anguish of
the soul, by fifteen minutes' reading every day; how to perform
the act of sexual intercourse in such a way that your wife will
love you for it; how to have children or to keep from having
children; how to write short-stories, novels, plays, and verses
which are profitably saleable; how to keep from having
body-odour, constipation, bad breath, or tartar on the teeth; how
to have good manners, know the proper fork to use for every
course, and always do the proper thing--how, in short, to be
beautiful, "distinguished," "smart," "chic," "forceful," and
"sophisticated"--finally, how to have "a brilliant personality"
and "achieve success."</p>

<p>Yes, for the most part, the members of Professor Hatcher's
class belonged to this great colony of the lost Americans. They
belonged to that huge tribe of all the damned and lost who feel
that everything is going to be all right with them if they can
only take a trip, or learn a rule, or meet a person. They
belonged to that futile, desolate, and forsaken horde who felt
that all will be well with their lives, that all the power they
lack themselves will be supplied, and all the anguish, fury, and
unrest, the confusion and the dark damnation of man's soul can
magically be healed if only they eat bran for breakfast, secure
an introduction to a celebrated actress, get a reading for their
manuscript by a friend of Sinclair Lewis, or win admission to
Professor Hatcher's celebrated class of dramatists.</p>

<p>And, in a curious way, the plays written by the people in
Professor Hatcher's class illustrated, in one form or another,
this desire. Few of the plays had any intrinsic reality, for most
of these people were lacking in the first, the last, the foremost
quality of the artist, without which he is lost: the ability to
get out of his own life the power to live and work by, to derive
from his own experience--as a fruit of all his seeing, feeling,
living, joy and bitter anguish--the palpable and living substance
of his art.</p>

<p>Few of the people in Professor Hatcher's class possessed this
power. Few of them had anything of their own to say. Their lives
seemed to have grown from a stony and a fruitless soil and, as a
consequence, the plays they wrote did not reflect that life, save
by a curious and yet illuminating indirection.</p>

<p>Thus, in an extraordinary way, their plays--unreal, sterile,
imitative, and derivative as most of them indubitably were--often
revealed more about the lives of the people who wrote them than
better and more living work could do. For, although few of the
plays showed any contact with reality--with that passionate
integument of blood and sweat and pain and fear and grief and joy
and laughter of which this world is made--most of them did show,
in one way or another, what was perhaps the basic impulse in the
lives of most of these people--the impulse which had brought them
here to Professor Hatcher's class.</p>

<p>The impulse of the people in the class was not to embrace life
and devour it, but rather to escape from it. And in one way or
another most of the plays these people wrote were illustrative of
this desire. For in these plays--unnatural, false, and imitative,
as they were--one could discern, in however pale and feeble a
design, a picture of the world not as its author had seen and
lived and known it, but rather as he wished to find it or believe
in it. And, in all their several forms--whether sad, gay, comic,
tragic, or fantastical--these plays gave evidence of the denial
and the fear of life.</p>

<p>The wealthy young dawdler from Philadelphia, for example,
wrote plays which had their setting in a charming little French
caf&eacute;. Here one was introduced to all the gay, quaint,
charming Frenchmen--to Papa Duval, the jolly proprietor, and
Mamma Duval, his rotund and no less jolly spouse, as well as to
all the quaint and curious habitu&eacute;s that are so prolific
in theatrical establishments of this order. One met, as well,
that fixture of these places: old Monsieur Vernet, the crusty,
crotchety, but kindly old gentleman who is the caf&eacute;'s
oldest customer and has had the same table in the corner by the
window for more than thirty years. One saw again the familiar
development of the comic situation--the day when Monsieur Vernet
enters at his appointed time and finds at his table a total
stranger. Sacrilege! Imprecations! Tears, prayers, and entreaties
on the part of Papa Duval and his wife, together with the
stubborn refusal of the imperious stranger to move! Climax: old
Monsieur Vernet storming out of the caf&eacute;, swearing that he
will never return. Resolution of conflict: the efforts of Papa
and Mamma Duval to bring their most prized customer back into the
fold again, and their final success, the pacification and return
of Monsieur Vernet amid great rejoicing, thanks to a cunning
stratagem on the part of Henri, the young waiter, who wins a
reward for all these efforts, the hand of Mimi, Papa Duval's
charming daughter, from whom he has been separated by Papa
Duval's stern decree.</p>

<p>Thus custom is restored and true love reunited by one
brilliant comic stroke!</p>

<p>And all this pretty little world, the contribution of a rich
young man who came from Philadelphia! How perfectly God-damn
delightful it all was, to be sure!</p>

<p>The plays of old Seth Flint, the sour and withered
ex-reporter, were, if of a different colouring, cut from the same
gaudy cloth of theatrical unreality. For forty years old Seth had
pounded precincts as a newsman, and had known city-rooms across
the nation. He had seen every crime, ruin, and incongruity of
which man's life is capable. He was familiar with every trait of
graft, with every accursed smell and smear of the old red murder
which ineradicably fouled the ancient soul of man, and the stench
of man's falseness, treachery, cruelty, hypocrisy, cowardice, and
injustice, together with the look of brains and blood upon the
pavements of the nation, was no new thing to old Seth Flint.</p>

<p>His skin had been withered, his eyes deadened, his heart and
spirit burdened wearily, his faith made cynical, and his temper
soured by the black picture of mankind which he had seen as a
reporter--and because of this, in spite of this, he had remained
or become--how, why, in what miraculous fashion no one knew--a
curiously honest, sweet, and generous person, whose life had been
the record of a selfless loyalty. He had known poverty, hardship,
and self-sacrifice, and endured all willingly without complaint:
he had taken the savings of a lifetime to send the two sons of
his widowed sister to college; he had supported this woman and
her family for years, and now, when his own life was coming to
its close, he was yielding to the only self-indulgence he had
ever known--a year away from the city-room of a Denver newspaper,
a year away in the rare ether, among the precious and
&aelig;sthetic intellects of Professor Hatcher's celebrated
course, a year in which to realize the dream of a lifetime, the
vision of his youth--a year in which to write the plays he had
always dreamed of writing. And what kind of plays did he
write?</p>

<p>Alas! Old Seth did exactly what he set out to do; he succeeded
perfectly in fulfilling his desire--and, by a tragic irony, his
failure lay in just this fact. The plays which he produced with
an astounding and prolific ease--("Three days is enough to write
a play," the old man said in his sour voice. "You guys who take a
year to write a play give me a pain. If you can't write a play a
week, you can't write anything; the play's no good")--these plays
were just the plays which he had dreamed of writing as a young
man, and therein was evident their irremediable fault.</p>

<p>For Seth's plays--so neat, brisk, glib, and smartly
done--would have been good plays in a commercial way, as well, if
he had only done them twenty years before. He wrote, without
effort and with unerring accuracy, a kind of play which had been
immensely popular at the beginning of the twentieth century, but
which people had grown tired of twenty years before. He wrote
plays in which the babies got mixed up in the maternity ward of a
great hospital, in which the rich man's child goes to the family
of the little grocer, and the grocer's child grows up as the heir
to an enormous fortune, with all the luxuries and securities of
wealth around him. And he brought about the final resolution of
this tangled scheme, the meeting of these scrambled children and
their bewildered parents, with a skill of complication, a design
of plot, a dexterity that was astonishing. His characters--all
well-known types of the theatre, as of nurse tough-spoken,
shop-girl slangy, reporter cynical, and so on--were well
conceived to fret their purpose, their lives well-timed and apt
and deftly made. He had mastered the formula of an older type of
"well-made play" with astonishing success. Only, the type was
dead, the interest of the public in such plays had vanished
twenty years before.</p>

<p>So here he was, a live man, writing, with amazing skill, dead
plays for a theatre that was dead, and for a public that did not
exist.</p>

<p>"Chekhov! Ibsen!" old Seth would whine sourly with a
dismissing gesture of his parched old hand, and a scornful
contortion of his bitter mouth in his old mummy of a face. "You
guys all make me tired the way you worship them!" he would whine
out at some of the exquisite young temperaments in Professor
Hatcher's class. "Those guys can't write a play! Take Chekhov,
now!" whined Seth. "That guy never wrote a real play in his life!
He never knew how to write a play! He couldn't have written a
play if he tried! He never learned the rules for writing a
play!--That <i>Cherry Orchard</i> now," whined old Seth with a
sour sneering laugh, "--that <i>Cherry Orchard</i> that you guys
are always raving about! That's not a play!" he cried
indignantly. "Whatever made you think it was a play? I was trying
to read it just the other day," he rasped, "and there's nothing
there to hold your interest! It's got no <i>plot!</i> There's no
story in it! There's no suspense! Nothing happens in it. All you
got is a lot of people who do nothing but talk all the time. You
never get anywhere," said Seth scornfully. "And yet to hear you
guys rave about it, you'd think it was a great play."</p>

<p>"Well, what do you call a great play, then, if <i>The Cherry
Orchard</i> isn't one?" one of the young men said acidly. "Who
wrote the great plays that you talk about?"</p>

<p>"Why, George M. Cohan wrote some," whined Seth instantly.
"That's who. Avery Hopwood wrote some great plays. We've had
plenty of guys in this country who wrote great plays. If they'd
come from Russia you'd get down and worship 'em," he said
bitterly; "but just because they came out of this country they're
no good!"</p>

<p>In the relation of the class towards old Seth Flint, it was
possible to see the basic falseness of their relation towards
life everywhere around them. For here was a man--whatever his
defects as a playwright might have been--who had lived
incomparably the richest, most varied and dangerous, and eventful
life among them; as he was himself far more interesting than any
of the plays they wrote, and as dramatists they should have
recognized and understood his quality. But they saw none of this.
For their relation towards life and people such as old Seth Flint
was not one of understanding. It was not even one of burning
indignation--of that indignation which is one of the dynamic
forces in the artist's life. It was rather one of supercilious
scorn and ridicule.</p>

<p>They felt that they were "above" old Seth, and most of the
other people in the world, and for this reason they were in
Professor Hatcher's class. Of Seth they said:</p>

<p>"He's really a misfit, terribly out of place here. I wonder
why he came."</p>

<p>And they would listen to an account of one of Seth's latest
errors in good taste with the expression of astounded disbelief,
the tones of stunned incredulity which were coming into fashion
about that time among elegant young men.</p>

<p>"Not really! . . . But he never really said <i>that. . . .</i>
You <i>can't</i> mean it."</p>

<p>"Oh, but I assure you, he did!"</p>

<p>". . . It's simply past belief! . . . I can't believe he's as
bad as <i>that."</i></p>

<p>"Oh, but he <i>is!</i> It's incredible, I know, but you've no
idea what he's capable of." And so on.</p>

<p>And yet old Seth Flint was badly needed in that class: his
bitter and unvarnished tongue caused Professor Hatcher many
painful moments, but it had its use--oh, it had its use,
particularly when the play was of this nature:</p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>Irene (slowly, with scorn and contempt in her voice).</i>
So--it has come to this! This is all your love amounts to--a
little petty selfish thing! I had thought you were bigger than
that, John.</p>

<p><i>John (desperately).</i> But--but, my God, Irene--what am I
to think? I found you in bed with him--my best friend! <i>(with
difficulty).</i> You know--that looks suspicious, to say the
least!</p>

<p><i>Irene (softly</i>--<i>with amused contempt in her
voice).</i> You poor little man! And to think I thought your love
was <i>so big.</i></p>

<p><i>John (wildly).</i> But I do love you, Irene. That's just
the point.</p>

<p><i>Irene (with passionate scorn).</i> Love! You don't know
what love means! Love is bigger than that! Love is big enough for
all things, all people. <i>(She extends her arms in an
all-embracing gesture.)</i> My love takes in the world--it
embraces all mankind! It is glamorous, wild, free as the wind,
John.</p>

<p><i>John (slowly).</i> Then you have had other lovers?</p>

<p><i>Irene:</i> Lovers come, lovers go. <i>(She makes an
impatient gesture.)</i> What is that? Nothing! Only love
endures--my love, which is greater than all.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Eugene would writhe in his seat, and clench his hands
convulsively. Then he would turn almost prayerfully to the
bitter, mummied face of old Seth Flint for that barbed but
cleansing vulgarity that always followed such a scene:</p>

<p>"Well?" Professor Hatcher would say, putting down the
manuscript he had been reading, taking off his eye-glasses (which
were attached to a ribbon of black silk) and looking around with
a quizzical smile, an impassive expression on his fine,
distinguished face. "Well?" he would say again urbanely, as no
one answered. "Is there any comment?"</p>

<p>"What is she?" Seth would break the nervous silence with his
rasping snarl. "Another of these society whores? You know," he
continued, "you can find plenty of her kind for three dollars a
throw without any of that fancy palaver."</p>

<p>Some of the class smiled faintly, painfully, and glanced at
each other with slight shrugs of horror; others were grateful,
felt pleasure well in them and said underneath their breath
exultantly:</p>

<p>"Good old Seth! Good old Seth!"</p>

<p>"Her love is big enough for all things, is it?" said Seth. "I
know a truck driver out in Denver I'll match against her any
day."</p>

<p>Eugene and Ed Horton, a large and robust aspirant from the
Iowa cornlands, roared with happy laughter, poking each other
sharply in the ribs.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>"Do you think the play will act?" someone said. "It seems to
me that it comes pretty close to closet drama."</p>

<p>"If you ask me," said Seth, "it comes pretty close to
water-closet drama. . . . No," he said sourly. "What that boy
needs is a little experience. He ought to go out and get him a
woman and get all this stuff off his mind. After that, he might
sit down and write a play."</p>

<p>For a moment there was a very awkward silence, and Professor
Hatcher smiled a trifle palely. Then, taking his eye-glasses with
a distinguished movement, he looked around and said:</p>

<p>"Is there any other comment?"</p>

<p> </p>

<h1>XVII</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Often during these years of fury, hunger, and unrest, when he
was trying to read all the books and know all the people, he
would live for days, and even for weeks, in a world of such mad
and savage concentration, such terrific energy, that time would
pass by him incredibly, while he tried to eat and drink the
earth, stare his way through walls of solid masonry into the
secret lives of men, until he had made the substance of all life
his own.</p>

<p>And during all this time, although he was living a life of the
most savage conflict, the most blazing energy, wrestling day by
day with the herculean forces of the million-footed city,
listening to a million words and peering into a hundred thousand
faces, he would nevertheless spend a life of such utter
loneliness that he would go for days at a time without seeing a
face or hearing a voice that he knew, and until the sound of his
own voice seemed strange and phantasmal to him.</p>

<p>Then suddenly he would seem to awake out of this terrific
vision, which had been so savage, mad, and literal that its very
reality had a fabulous and dreamlike quality, and time, strange
million-visaged time, had been telescoped incredibly, so that
weeks had passed by like a single day. He would awake out of this
living dream and see the minutes, hours, and days, and all the
acts and faces of the earth pass by him in their usual way. And
instantly, when this happened, he would feel a bitter and
intolerable loneliness--a loneliness so acrid, grey, and bitter
that he could taste its sharp thin crust around the edges of his
mouth like the taste and odour of weary burnt-out steel, like a
depleted storage battery or a light that had gone dim, and he
could feel it greyly and intolerably in his entrails, the
conduits of his blood, and in all the substance of his body.</p>

<p>When this happened, he would feel an almost unbearable need to
hear the voice and see the face again of someone he had known and
at such a time as this he would go to see his Uncle Bascom, that
strange and extraordinary man who, born like the others in the
wilderness, the hills of home, had left these hills for ever.</p>

<p>Bascom now lived alone with his wife (for his four children
were grown up and would have none of him) in a dingy section of
one of the innumerable suburbs that form part of the terrific
ganglia of Boston, and it was here that the boy would often go on
Sundays.</p>

<p>After a long confusing journey that was made by subway,
elevated, and street car, he would leave the chill and dismal
street car at the foot of a hill on a long, wide, and frozen
street lined with tall rows of wintry elms, with smoky wintry
houses that had a look of solid, closed and mellow warmth, and
with a savage frozen waste of tidal waters on the right--those
New England waters that are so sparkling, fresh and glorious,
like a tide of sapphires, in the springtime, and so grim and
savage in their frozen desolation in the winter.</p>

<p>Then the street car would bang its draughty sliding doors
together, grind harshly off with its cargo of people with pinched
lips, thin red pointed noses, and cod-fish faces, and vanish,
leaving him with the kind of loneliness and absence which a
street car always leaves when it has gone, and he would turn away
from the tracks along a dismal road or street that led into the
district where his uncle had his house. And stolidly he would
plunge forward against the grey and frozen desolation of that
place to meet him.</p>

<p>And at length he would pause before his uncle's little house,
and as he struck the knocker, he was always glad to hear the
approaching patter of his Aunt Louise's feet, and cheered by the
brightening glance of her small birdy features, as she opened the
door for him, inwardly exultant to hear her confirm in her bright
ladylike tones his own prediction of what she would say: "Oh,
<i>theah</i> you ah! I was wondering what was keeping you."</p>

<p>A moment later he would be greeted from the cellar or the
kitchen by his uncle Bascom's high, husky and yet strangely
remote yell, the voice of a prophet calling from a mountain:</p>

<p>"Hello, Eugene, my boy. Is that <i>you?"</i> And a moment
later the old man would appear, coming up to meet him from some
lower cellar-depth, swearing, muttering, and banging doors; and
he would come toward him howling greetings, buttoned to his chin
in the frayed and faded sweater, gnarled, stooped and
frosty-looking, clutching his great hands together at his waist;
then hold one gaunt hand out to him and howl:</p>

<p>"Hello, hello, hello, sit down, sit down, sit down," after
which, for no apparent reason, he would contort his gaunt face in
a horrible grimace, convolve his amazing rubbery lips, and close
his eyes and his mouth tightly and laugh through his nose in
forced snarls: "Phuh! Phuh Phuh! Phuh! Phuh!"</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Bascom Pentland had been the scholar of his amazing family: he
was a man of powerful intelligence and disordered emotions. Even
in his youth, his eccentricities of dress, speech, walk, manner
had made him an object of ridicule to his Southern kinsmen, but
their ridicule was streaked with pride, since they accepted the
impact of his personality as another proof that theirs was an
extraordinary family. "He's one of 'em, all right," they said
exultantly, "queerer than any of us!"</p>

<p>Bascom's youth, following the war between the States, had been
seared by a bitter poverty, at once enriched and warped by a life
that clung to the earth with a rootlike tenacity that was manual,
painful, spare and stricken, and that rebuilt itself--fiercely,
cruelly, and richly--from the earth. And because there burned and
blazed in him from the first a hatred of human indignity, a
passionate avowal of man's highness and repose, he felt more
bitterly than the others the delinquencies of his father, and the
multiplication of his father's offspring, who came regularly into
a world of empty cupboards.</p>

<p>"As each of them made its unhappy entrance into the world," he
would say later, his voice tremulous with passion, "I went out
into the woods striking my head against the trees, and
blaspheming God in my anger. Yes, sir," he continued, pursing his
long lip rapidly against his few loose upper teeth, and speaking
with an exaggerated pedantry of enunciation, "I am not ashamed to
confess that I did. For we were living in conditions
un-<i>worthy</i>--<i>unworthy"</i>--his voice rising to an
evangelical yell, "I had almost said--of the condition of
animals. And--<i>say</i>--what do you think?"--he said, with a
sudden shift in manner and tone, becoming, after his episcopal
declaration, matter of fact and whisperingly confidential. "Why,
do you know, my boy, at one time I had to take my <i>own</i>
father aside and point out to him we were living in no way
becoming decent people."--Here his voice sank to a whisper, and
he tapped Eugene on the knee with his big, stiff finger,
grimacing horribly and pursing his lip against his dry upper
teeth.</p>

<p>Poverty had been the mistress of his youth and Bascom Pentland
had not forgotten: poverty had burned its way into his heart. He
took what education he could find in a backwoods school, read
everything he could, taught, for two or three years, in a country
school and, at the age of twenty-one, borrowing enough money for
railway fare, went to Boston to enrol himself at Harvard. And,
somehow, because of the fire that burned in him, the fierce
determination of his soul, he had been admitted, secured
employment waiting on tables, tutoring, and pressing everyone's
trousers but his own, and lived in a room with two other starved
wretches on $3.50 a week, cooking, eating, sleeping, washing, and
studying in the one place.</p>

<p>At the end of seven years he had gone through the college and
the school of theology, performing brilliantly in Greek, Hebrew,
and metaphysics.</p>

<p>Poverty, fanatical study, the sexual meagreness of his
surroundings, had made of him a gaunt zealot: at thirty he was a
lean fanatic, a true Yankee madman, high-boned, with grey thirsty
eyes and a thick flaring sheaf of oaken hair--six feet three
inches of gangling and ludicrous height, gesticulating madly and
obliviously before a grinning world. But he had a grand lean
head: he looked somewhat like the great Ralph Waldo Emerson--with
the brakes off.</p>

<p>About this time he married a young Southern woman of a good
family: she was from Tennessee, her parents were both dead, and
in the 'seventies she had come North and had lived for several
years with an uncle in Providence, who had been constituted
guardian of her estate, amounting probably to about $75,000,
although her romantic memory later multiplied the sum to
$200,000. The man squandered part of her money and stole the
rest: she came, therefore, to Bascom without much dowry, but she
was pretty, bright, intelligent, and had a good figure. Bascom
smote the walls of his room with bloody knuckles, and fell down
before God.</p>

<p>When Bascom met her she was a music student in Boston: she had
a deep full-toned contralto voice which was wrung from her
somewhat tremulously when she sang. She was a small woman,
birdlike and earnest, delicately fleshed and boned, quick and
active in her movements and with a crisp tart speech which still
bore, curiously, traces of a Southern accent. She was a brisk,
serious, ladylike little person, without much humour, and she was
very much in love with her gaunt suitor. They saw each other for
two years: they went to concerts, lectures, sermons; they talked
of music, poetry, philosophy and of God, but they never spoke of
love. But one night Bascom met her in the parlour of her
boarding-house on Huntington Avenue, and with a voice vibrant and
portentous with the importance of the words he had to utter,
began as follows: "Miss Louise!" he said carefully, gazing
thoughtfully over the apex of his hands, "there comes a time when
a man, having reached an age of discretion and mature judgment,
must begin to consider one of the <i>gravest</i>--yes! by all
means one of the most important events in human life. The event I
refer to is--matrimony." He paused, a clock was beating out its
punctual measured tock upon the mantel, and a horse went by with
ringing hoofs upon the street. As for Louise, she sat quietly
erect, with dignified and ladylike composure, but it seemed to
her that the clock was beating in her own breast, and that it
might cease to beat at any moment.</p>

<p>"For a minister of the Gospel," Bascom continued, "the
decision is particularly grave, because, for him--once made, it
is <i>irrevocable,</i> once determined upon, it must be followed
<i>inexorably, relentlessly</i>--aye! to the edge of the grave,
to the <i>uttermost</i> gates of death, so that the possibility
of an error in judgment is <i>fraught"</i>--his voice sinking to
a boding whisper--"is <i>fraught</i> with the most terrible
consequences. Accordingly," Uncle Bascom said in a deliberate
tone, "having decided to take this step, realizing to the
<i>full</i>--to the <i>full,</i> mind you--its gravity, I have
searched my soul, I have questioned my heart. I have gone up into
the mount-ings and out into the desert and communed with my
<i>Maker</i> until"--his voice rose like a demon's howl--"there
no longer remains an <i>atom</i> of doubt, a <i>particle</i> of
uncertainty, a <i>vestige</i> of <i>disbelief</i>! Miss Louise, I
have decided that the young lady best fitted in every way to be
my helpmate, the partner of my joys and griefs, the confidante of
my dearest hopes, the in-<i>spir</i>-a-tion of my noblest
endeavours, the companion of my declining years, and the
<i>spirit</i> that shall accompany me along each step of life's
vexed and troubled way, sharing with me whatever God in His
<i>inscrutable</i> Providence shall will, whether of wealth or
poverty, grief or happiness--I have decided, Miss Louise, that
that lady must be--yourself!--and, therefore, I request," he said
slowly and impressively, "the honour of your hand in
mar-ri-age."</p>

<p>She loved him, she had hoped, prayed, and agonized for just
such a moment, but now that it had come she rose immediately with
ladylike dignity, and said: "Mistah Pentland: I am honuhed by
this mahk of yoah esteem and affection, and I pwomise to give it
my most <i>un</i>nest considahwation without delay. I wealize
fully, Mistah Pentland, the gwavity of the wuhds you have just
uttuhed. Foh my paht, I must tell you, Mistah Pentland, that if I
accept yoah pwoposal, I shall come to you without the fawchun
which was <i>wight</i>fully mine, but of which I have been
depwived and defwauded by the <i>wascality</i>--yes! the
<i>wascality</i> of my gahdian. I shall come to you, theahfoh,
without the dow'y I had hoped to be able to contwibute to my
husband's fawchuns."</p>

<p>"Oh, my <i>dear</i> Miss Louise! My <i>dear</i> young lady!"
Uncle Bascom cried, waving his great hand through the air with a
dismissing gesture. "Do not suppose--do not for one instant
suppose, I beg of you!--that consideration of a monetary nature
could influence my decision. Oh, not in the slightest!" he cried.
"Not at all, not at all!"</p>

<p>"Fawchnatly," Louise continued, "my inhewitance was not
<i>wholly</i> dissipated by this scoundwel. A pohtion, a vewy
small pohtion, remains."</p>

<p>"My dear girl! My dear young lady!" Uncle Bascom cried. "It is
not of the <i>slightest</i> consequence. . . . How much did he
leave?" he added.</p>

<p>Thus they were married.</p>

<p>Bascom immediately got a church in the Middle West: good pay
and a house. But during the course of the next twenty years he
was shifted from church to church, from sect to sect--to
Brooklyn, then back to the Middle West, to the Dakotas, to Jersey
City, to Western Massachusetts, and finally back to the small
towns surrounding Boston.</p>

<p>When Bascom talked, you may be sure God listened: he preached
magnificently, his gaunt face glowing from the pulpit, his rather
high, enormously vibrant voice husky with emotion. His prayers
were fierce solicitations of God, so mad with fervour that his
audiences uncomfortably felt they came close to blasphemy. But,
unhappily, on occasions his own mad eloquence grew too much for
him: his voice, always too near the heart of passion, would burst
in splinters, and he would fall violently forward across his
lectern, his face covered by his great gaunt fingers, sobbing
horribly.</p>

<p>This, in the Middle West, where his first church had been,
does not go down so well--yet it may be successful if one weeps
mellowly, joyfully--smiling bravely through the tears--at a
lovely aisle processional of repentant sinners; but Bascom, who
chose uncomfortable titles for his sermons, would be overcome by
his powerful feelings on those occasions when his topic was
"Potiphar's Wife," "Ruth, the Girl in the Corn," "The Whore of
Babylon," "The Woman on the Roof," and so on.</p>

<p>His head was too deeply engaged with his conscience--he was in
turn Episcopal, Presbyterian, Unitarian, searching through the
whole roaring confusion of Protestantism for a body of doctrine
with which he could agree. And he was for ever finding it, and
later for ever renouncing what he had found. At forty, the most
liberal of Unitarians, the strains of agnosticism were piping
madly through his sermons: he began to hint at his new faith in
prose which he modelled on the mighty utterance of Carlyle, and
in poetry, in what he deemed the manner of Matthew Arnold. His
professional connection with the Unitarians, and indeed with the
Baptists, Methodists, Holy Rollers, and Seventh Day Adventists,
came to an abrupt ending after he read from his pulpit one
morning a composition in verse entitled "The Agnostic," which
made up in concision what it lacked in melody, and which ended
each stanza sadly, but very plainly, on this recurrence:</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>"I do not know:<br>
 It may be so."</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>Thus, when he was almost fifty, Bascom Pentland stopped
preaching in public. There was no question where he was going. He
had his family's raging lust for property. He became a
"conveyancer"; he acquired enough of the law of property to
convey titles; but he began to buy pieces of land in the suburbs
of Boston and to build small cheap houses, using his own somewhat
extraordinary designs to save the architect's fees and, wherever
possible, doing such odd jobs as laying the foundations,
installing the plumbing, and painting the structure.</p>

<p>The small houses that he--no, he did not build them!--he went
through the agonies of monstrous childbirth to produce them, he
licked, nursed, and fondled them into stunted growth, and he sold
them on long but profitable terms to small Irish, Jewish, Negro,
Belgian, Italian and Greek labourers and tradesmen. And at the
conclusion of a sale, or after receiving from one of these men
the current payment, Uncle Bascom went homeward in a delirium of
joy, shouting in a loud voice, to all who might be compelled to
listen, the merits of the Jews, Belgians, Irish, Swiss or
Greeks.</p>

<p>"Finest people in the world! No question about it!"--this last
being his favourite exclamation in all moments of payment or
conviction.</p>

<p>For when they paid he loved them. Often on Sundays they would
come to pay him, tramping over the frozen ground or the packed
snow through street after street of smutty grey-looking houses in
the flat weary-looking suburb where he lived. To this dismal
heath, therefore, they came, the swarthy children of a dozen
races, clad in the hard and decent blacks in which the poor pay
debts and go to funerals. They would advance across the barren
lands, the harsh sere earth scarred with its wastes of rust and
rubbish, going stolidly by below the blank board fences of a
brick yard, crunching doggedly through the lanes of dirty rutted
ice, passing before the grey besmutted fronts of wooden houses
which in their stark, desolate, and unspeakable ugliness seemed
to give a complete and final utterance to an architecture of
weariness, sterility and horror, so overwhelming in its absolute
desolation that it seemed as if the painful and indignant soul of
man must sicken and die at length before it, stricken, stupefied,
and strangled without a tongue to articulate the curse that once
had blazed in him.</p>

<p>And at length they would pause before the old man's little
house--one of a street of little houses which he had built there
on the barren flatlands of the suburb, and to which he had given
magnificently his own name--Pentland Heights--although the only
eminence in all that flat and weary waste was an almost
imperceptible rise a half-mile off. And here along this street
which he had built, these little houses, warped yet strong and
hardy, seemed to burrow down solidly like moles for warmth into
the ugly stony earth on which they were built and to cower and
huddle doggedly below the immense and terrible desolation of the
northern sky, with its rimy sun-hazed lights, its fierce and
cruel rags and stripes of wintry red, its raw and savage
harshness. And then, gripping their greasy little wads of money,
as if in the knowledge that all reward below these fierce and
cruel skies must be wrenched painfully and minutely from a stony
earth, they went in to pay him. He would come up to meet them
from some lower cellar-depth, swearing, muttering, and banging
doors; and he would come toward them howling greetings, buttoned
to his chin in the frayed and faded sweater, gnarled, stooped and
frosty-looking, clutching his great hands together at his waist.
Then they would wait, stiffly, clumsily, fingering their hats,
while with countless squints and grimaces and pursings of the
lip, he scrawled out painfully their receipts--their fractional
release from debt and labour, one more hard-won step toward the
freedom of possession.</p>

<p>At length, having pocketed their money and finished the
transaction, he would not permit them to depart at once; he would
howl urgently at them an invitation to stay, he would offer long
weedy-looking cigars to them, and they would sit uncomfortably,
crouching on their buttock bones like stalled oxen, at the edges
of chairs, shyly and dumbly staring at him, while he howled
question, comment, and enthusiastic tribute at them.</p>

<p>"Why, my dear sir!" he would yell at Makropolos, the Greek.
"You have a glorious past, a history of which any nation might
well be proud!"</p>

<p>"Sure, sure!" said Makropolos, nodding vigorously. "Beeg
Heestory!"</p>

<p>"The isles of Greece, the isles of Greece!" the old man
howled, "where burning Sappho loved and sung--" (Phuh! phuh!
phuh! phuh! phuh!)</p>

<p>"Sure, sure!" said Makropolos again, nodding good-naturedly
but wrinkling his lowering finger's-breadth of brow in a somewhat
puzzled fashion. "Tha's right! You got it!"</p>

<p>"Why, my dear sir!" Uncle Bascom cried. "It has been the
ambition of my lifetime to visit those hallowed scenes, to stand
at sunrise on the Acropolis, to explore the glory that was
Greece, to see the magnificent ruins of the noblest of ancient
civ-i-<i>liz</i>-a-tions!"</p>

<p>For the first time a dark flush, a flush of outraged
patriotism, began to burn upon the swarthy yellow of Mr.
Makropolos's cheek: his manner became heavy and animated, and in
a moment he said with passionate conviction:</p>

<p>"No, no, no! No ruin! Wat you t'ink, eh! Athens fine town! We
got a million pipples dere!" He struggled for a word, then cupped
his hairy paws indefinitely: <i>"You</i> know? <i>Beeg</i>! O,
ni-ez!" he added greasily, with a smile. "Everyt'ing good! We got
everyt'ing good dere as you got here! <i>You</i> know?" he said
with a confiding and painful effort. "Everyt'ing ni-ez! Not old!
No, no, no!" he cried with a rising and indignant vigour. "New!
de same as here. Ni-ez! You get good and cheap--everyt'ing! Beeg
place, new house, dumbwaiter, elevator--wat chew like!--oh,
ni-ez!" he said earnestly. "Wat chew t'ink it cost, eh? Feefateen
dollar a month! Sure, sure!" he nodded with a swarthy
earnestness. "I wouldn't keed you!"</p>

<p>"Finest people on earth!" Uncle Bascom cried with an air of
great conviction and satisfaction. "No question about it!"--and
he would usher his visitor to the door, howling farewells into
the terrible desolation of those savage skies.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Aunt Louise, although she had not heard a word of
what was said, although she had listened to nothing except the
periods of Uncle Bascom's heavily accented and particular speech,
kept up a constant snuffling laughter punctuated momently by
faint whoops as she bent over her pots and pans in the kitchen,
pausing from time to time as if to listen, and then snuffling to
herself as she shook her head in pitying mirth which rose again
up to the crisis of a faint crazy cackle as she scoured the pan;
because, of course, during the forty-five years of her life with
him she had gone thoroughly, imperceptibly, and completely mad,
and no longer knew or cared to know whether these words had just
been spoken or were the echoes of lost voices long ago.</p>

<p>And again, she would pause to listen, with her small birdlike
features uplifted gleefully in a kind of mad attentiveness as the
door slammed and he stumped muttering back into the house, intent
upon the secret designs of his own life, as remote and isolate
from her as if they had each dwelt on separate planets, although
the house they lived in was a small one.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Such had been the history of the old man. His life had come up
from the wilderness, the buried past, the lost America. The
potent mystery of old events and moments had passed around him,
and the magic light of dark time fell across him.</p>

<p>Like all men in this land, he had been a wanderer, an exile on
the immortal earth. Like all of us, he had no home. Wherever
great wheels carried him was home.</p>

<p>As the old man and his nephew talked together, Louise would
prepare the meal in the kitchen, which gave on the living-room
where they ate, by a swing door that she kept open, in order that
she might hear what went on. And, while they waited, Uncle Bascom
would talk to the boy on a vast range of subjects, dealing with
that literature in which he had once been deep--the poetry of the
Old Testament, the philosophy of Hegel, Carlyle, and Matthew
Arnold, whom he worshipped, or some question in the daily
papers.</p>

<p>Uncle Bascom, seated, his fine gaunt face grave, magnificently
composed now above his arched gnarled hands, spoke with eloquent
deliberation. He became triumphant reasoning mind: he talked with
superb balanced judgment. All the tumult and insanity of his life
had been forgotten: no question of money or of self was involved.
Meanwhile, from the kitchen Aunt Louise kept up a constant
snuffling laughter, punctuated momently by faint whoops. She was
convinced, of course, that her husband was mad and all his
opinions nonsensical. Yet she had not listened to a word of what
he was saying, but only to the sound of his heavily accented,
precise, and particular speech. From time to time, snuffling to
herself, she would look in on Eugene, trembling with laughter,
and shake her head at him in pitying mirth.</p>

<p><i>"Beyond</i> a doubt! Beyond a <i>doubt</i>!<i>"</i> Uncle
Bascom would say. "The quality of the best writing in the books
of the Old Testament may take rank with the best writing that has
ever been done, but you are right in believing, too, the amount
of great writing is less than it is commonly supposed to be.
There are passages, nay! <i>books"</i>--his voice rising
strangely to a husky howl--"of the vilest rubbish--Noah, Shem,
Ham and Japheth--O vile! vile!" he cried. . . . "And Azariah
begat Amariah and Amariah begat Ahitub (Phuh! Phuh! Phuh!).
<i>Ahitub</i>!" he sneered. "And Azariah begat Seraiah, and
Seraiah begat Jehozadak (Phuh! Phuh! Phuh!) <i>Jehozadak"</i>--he
sneered with his precise articulation, finally letting out the
last syllable with a kind of snarling contempt. "Can you
<i>imagine,</i> can you even <i>dream,"</i> he howled, "of
calling anyone a name like that! 'And Jehozadak went into
captivity'--as, indeed, he ought! (phuh! phuh! phuh!)--his
<i>very</i> name would constitute a <i>penal</i> offence! (Phuh!
Phuh! Phuh!) Je<i>hoz</i>adak!" Uncle Bascom sneered. "But," he
proceeded deliberately in a moment, as he stared calmly over his
great arched hands, "--but--the quality of some of the language
is God-intoxicated: the noblest poetry ever chanted in the
service of eternity."</p>

<p>"The Book of Wevelations," cried Aunt Louise, suddenly rushing
out of the kitchen with a carving-knife in her hand, having
returned to earth for a moment to hear him. "The Book of
Wevelations!" she said in a hoarse whisper, her mouth puckered
with disgust. <i>"Eugene!</i> A <i>wicked,</i> bloo-o-edy,
kwu-u-el monument to supahstition. Twibute to an avenging and
<i>muh-duh-wous Gawd!"</i> The last word uttered in a hoarse
almost inaudible whisper would find his aunt bent double,
clutching a knife in one hand, with her small bright eyes glaring
madly at us.</p>

<p>"Oh no, my dear, oh no," said Uncle Bascom, with astonishing,
unaccustomed sadness, with almost exquisite gentleness. And, his
vibrant passionate voice thrilling suddenly with emotion, he
added:</p>

<p>"The triumphant music of one of the mightiest of earth's
poets: the sublime utterance of a man for whom God had opened the
mysteries of heaven and hell."</p>

<p>He paused a moment, then quietly in a remote voice--in that
remote and magnificent voice which could thrill men so deeply
when it uttered poetry, he continued: "'I am Alpha and Omega, the
first and the last, the beginning and the end'--the mightiest
line, my dear boy, the most magnificent poetry, that was ever
written." And suddenly Uncle Bascom threw his gaunt hands before
his face, and wept in strong hoarse sobs: "Oh, my God, my
God!--the beauty, the pity of it all! . . . You must pardon me,"
he whispered after a moment, drawing his faded sweater sleeve
across his eyes. "You must pardon me. It brought
back--memories."</p>

<p>Aunt Louise, who had been stricken with a kind of fear and
horror when he began to weep, now looked at Eugene with an
expression of strong physical disgust, almost of nausea, shaking
her head slightly in an affronted and ladylike manner as might
one who, having achieved healthy and courageous discipline over
all the excesses of emotion, feels only contempt for him who
gives way to them.</p>

<p>She retired now with exaggerated dignity to the kitchen,
served the meal, and addressed Eugene for some time thereafter
with absurd quietness and restraint of manner, and a kind of
stiff primness about her backbone. She was an excellent cook;
there was magic in her treatment of food, and on the occasions
when Eugene was coming out, she insisted that Bascom get her a
decent piece of meat to work with.</p>

<p>There would be a juicy fragrant piece of lamb, or a boiled leg
of mutton with currant jelly, or perhaps a small crisply browned
roast of beef, with small flaky biscuits, smoking hot, two or
three vegetables, and rich coffee. Uncle Bascom, quite
unperturbed by his outbreak, would stamp into the kitchen, where
he could be heard swearing and muttering to himself, as he
searched for various things. Later he would appear at the table
bearing a platter filled with some revolting mess of his own
concoction--a mixture of raw vegetables, chopped up--onions,
carrots, beans, and raw potatoes--for he had the full strength of
his family's mania concerning food, violent prejudices about its
preparation, and deep-seated distrust of everybody's cleanliness
but his own.</p>

<p>"Have some, my boy. Have some!" he would yell huskily, seating
himself and lunging toward Eugene with the awful mess, in a
gesture of violent invitation.</p>

<p>"Thank you, no." Eugene would try to keep his eyes averted
from the mess and focus on the good food heaping his plate.</p>

<p>"You may eat that slop if you want to," Uncle Bascom would
exclaim with a scornful and sneering laugh. "It would give
<i>me</i> my death of dyspepsia." And the silence of their eating
would be broken by the recurrent snuffling whoops of Aunt Louise,
accompanied by many pitying looks and head-shakes as she trembled
with laughter and hid her mouth.</p>

<p>Or, suddenly, in the full rich progress of the meal, Eugene
would be shocked out of his pleasure in the food by the mad
bright eyes of Aunt Louise bearing fiercely down upon him:</p>

<p>"Eugene!--don't bwood, boy! Don't bwood! You've got it in
you--it's in the blood! You're one of them. You're one of
<i>them!</i>--a <i>Pentland,"</i> she croaked fatally.</p>

<p>"Ah-h--you <i>don't</i> know what you're talking about"--thus
suddenly in fierce distemper Uncle Bascom. <i>"Scotch!
Scotch</i>-Irish! Finest people on earth! No question about it
whatever."</p>

<p>"Fugitive ideation! Fugitive ideation!" she chattered like a
monkey over a nut. "Mind goes off in all diwections. Can't stick
to anything five minutes at a time. The same thing that's wong
with the moduhn decadents. Wead Nordau's book, Eugene. It will
open yoah eyes," and she whispered hoarsely again: "You're
<i>ovah-sexed</i>--<i>all</i> of you!"</p>

<p>"Bosh! Bosh!" growled Uncle Bascom. "Some more of your
psychology--the <i>bastard</i> of superstition and quackery: the
black magic of little minds--the effort of a blind man (phuh!
phuh! phuh!) crawling about in a dark room (phuh! phuh!) looking
for a <i>black cat</i> (phuh! phuh!) that <i>isn't there,"</i> he
yelled triumphantly, and closed his eyes and snarled and snuffled
down his nose with laughter.</p>

<p>He knew nothing about it: occasionally he still read Kant, and
he could be as deep in absolute categories, moments of negation,
and definitions of a concept as she with all of her complicated
and extensive paraphernalia of phobias, complexes, fixations, and
repressions.</p>

<p>"Well, Eugene," thus Aunt Louise with light raillery and yet
with eager curiosity, "have you found you a nice wosy-cheeked New
England gul yet? You had bettah watch <i>out,</i> boy! I tell
you, you had bettah watch <i>out!"</i> she declared, kittenishly,
wagging her finger at him, before he had time to answer.</p>

<p>"If he has," said Uncle Bascom grimly, "he will find her sadly
lacking in the qualities of delicacy, breeding, and womanly
decorum that the Southern girl has. Oh, yes! No question about
that whatever!" for Uncle Bascom still had the passionate loyalty
and sentimental affection for the South that many Southerners
have who could not be induced, under any circumstances, to
return.</p>

<p>"Take a Nawthun gul, Eugene." Aunt Louise became at once
combative. "They're bettah for you! They are <i>bettah.</i> They
are <i>bettah!"</i> she declared, shaking her head in an obdurate
manner, as if further argument was useless. "Moah independence!
Bettah minds! They won't choke yoah life out by hanging awound
yoah neck," she concluded crisply.</p>

<p>"I will tell you a story," Uncle Bascom continued deliberately
as if she had not spoken, "that will illustrate admirably what I
mean." Here he cleared his throat, as if he were preparing to
deliver a set speech, and began in a deliberate and formal tone:
"Some years ago I had occasion to go to Portland, Maine, on
business. When I arrived at the North Station I found a crowd
waiting before the window: it was necessary for me to wait in
line. I was carrying a small valise which I placed on the floor
between my legs in order to get out the money for my ticket. At
this moment the woman who stood behind me, apparently not given
to noticing very well where she was going," he snarled bitterly,
"started to move forward and stubbed her toe against the valise.
Before I had time to turn round and apologize"--he stopped
abruptly, then, leaning forward with a horrible grimace, he
tapped Eugene stiffly with his great bony fingers and continued
in a lowered voice: "Say! Have you any idea what she did, my
boy?"</p>

<p>"No," Eugene said.</p>

<p>"Why, I give you my word, my boy," he whispered solemnly,
"without so much as 'By your leave,' she lifted her leg and
<i>kicked</i> me, <i>kicked</i> me"--he howled--"in the
<i>stern</i>! And <i>she,</i> my boy, was a New England
woman."</p>

<p>"Whoo-o-op!" Aunt Louise was off again, rocking back and
forth, holding her napkin over her mouth.</p>

<p>"Can you <i>imagine,</i> can you <i>dream,"</i> said Bascom,
his voice an intense whisper of disgust, "of a Southern lady, the
flower of modesty and the old aristocracy, doing such a thing as
that?"</p>

<p>"Yes-s," hissed Aunt Louise, her cackle subsiding, leaning
intensely across the table and glaring at him, "and it
<i>suhved</i> you wight! It <i>suhved</i> you wight! It
<i>suhved</i> you wight! These things would nevah happen if you
thought of any one's convenience but yoah own. What <i>wight</i>
did you have to put yoah baggage there? What <i>wight?"</i></p>

<p>"Ah," he replied, with a kind of precise snarl, profoundly
contemptuous of her opinion,
"you-don't-know-what-you're-talk-ing-about! What <i>right?</i>
she says--Why all the right in the world," he yelled. "Have you
ever read the conditions enumerated upon the back of railway
tickets concerning the transportation of baggage?"</p>

<p>"Suttinly not!" she retorted crisply. "One does not need to
wead the backs of wailway tickets to learn how to behave like a
civilized pusson!"</p>

<p>"Well, I will tell them to you," said Uncle Bascom, licking
his lips, and with a look of joy upon his face. And, at great
length, with infinite gusto, lip-pursing, and legal pedantry of
elocution, he would enumerate them all.</p>

<p>"And say, by the way, Eugene," he would continue without a
halt, "there is a very charming young lady who occasionally comes
to my office (with her mother, of course) who is very anxious to
meet you. She is a musician: she appears quite often in public.
They live in Melrose, but they came, originally, I believe, from
New Hampshire. Finest people in the world: no question about it,"
his uncle said.</p>

<p>And suddenly alert, scenting adventure and seduction, the
young man got the address from him immediately.</p>

<p>"Yes, my boy"--here Uncle Bascom fumbled through a mass of
envelopes--"you may call her, without indiscretion, over the
telephone at any time. I have spoken to her frequently about you:
no doubt you'll find much in common. Or, <i>say!"</i>--here a
flash of inspiration aroused him to volcanic action--"I could
call her now and let you talk to her." And he plunged violently
toward the telephone.</p>

<p>"No, no, no, no, no!" Eugene sprang after him and checked him.
For he wanted to make his own appointment luxuriously in private,
sealed darkly in a telephone booth, craftily to feel his way,
speculating on the curve of the unseen hip by the sound of the
voice; probing, with the most delicate innuendo, the depth and
richness of the promise. He loathed all family intercession and
interference: they placed, he felt, at the outset, a crushing
restraint upon the adventure from which it could never
recover.</p>

<p>"I had rather call her myself," he added, "when I have more
time. I don't know when I could see her now: it might be awkward
calling at just this time."</p>

<p>Later, while Uncle Bascom was poking furiously at the meagre
coals of the tiny furnace in the cellar, setting up a clangorous
and smoky din all through the house, Aunt Louise would bear down
madly upon the boy, whispering:</p>

<p>"Did you hear him! Did you hear him! Still mad about the women
at his age! Can't keep his hands off them! The lechewous old
fool!" and she cackled bitterly. Then, with a fierce change:
"He's <i>mad</i> about them, Eugene. He's had one after anothah
for the last twenty yeahs! He has spent <i>faw-chuns</i> on them!
Have you seen that gul in his office yet? The stenographer?"</p>

<p>He had, and believed he had rarely seen a more solidly dull
unattractive female than this pallid course-featured girl. But he
only said: "Yes."</p>

<p>"He has spent thousands on her, Gene! <i>Thousands!</i> The
old fool! And all they do is laugh at him behind his back. Why,
even at home heah," her eyes darting madly about the place, "he
can hardly keep his hands off me at times! I have to lock myself
in my woom to secure pwotection," and her bright old eyes
muttered crazily about in her head.</p>

<p>He thought these outbursts the result of frantic and
extravagant jealousy: fruit of some passionate and submerged
affection that his aunt still bore for her husband. This,
perhaps, was true, but later he was to find there was a
surprising modicum of fact in what she had said.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>During the wintry afternoon, he would sit and smoke one of his
uncle's corn-cob pipes, filling it with the coarse cheap powerful
tobacco that lay, loosely spread, upon a bread-board in the
kitchen.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, his aunt, on these usual Sundays when she must
remain at home, played entire operas from Wagner on her small
victrola.</p>

<p>Most of the records had been given her by her two daughters,
and during the week the voices of the music afforded her the only
companionship she had. The boy listened attentively to all she
said about music, because he knew little about it, and had got
from poetry the kind of joy that music seemed to give to others.
Shifting the records quickly, his aunt would point out the
melodramatic effervescence of the Italians, the metallic
precision, the orderly profusion, the thrill, the vibration, the
emptiness of French composition. She liked the Germans and the
Russians. She liked what she called the "barbaric splendour" of
Rimsky, but was too late, of course, either to have heard or to
care much for the modern composers.</p>

<p>She would play Wagner over and over again, lost in the
enchanted forests of the music, her spirit wandering drunkenly
down vast murky aisles of sound, through which the great hoarse
throats of horns were baying faintly. And occasionally, on
Sundays, on one of her infrequent excursions into the world, when
her daughters bought her tickets for concerts at Symphony
Hall--that great grey room lined on its sides with pallid plaster
shells of Greece--she would sit perched high, a sparrow held by
the hypnotic serpent's eye of music--following each <i>motif,</i>
hearing minutely each subtle entry of the mellow flutes, the
horns, the spinal ecstasy of violins--until her lonely and
desolate life was spun out of her into aerial fabrics of bright
sound.</p>

<p>During this time, Uncle Bascom, who also knew nothing about
music, and cared so little for it that he treated his wife's
passion for it with contempt, would bury himself in the Sunday
papers, or thumb deliberately through the pages of an ancient
edition of the <i>Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica</i> in search of
arbitrament for some contested point.</p>

<p>"Ah! Here we are, just as I thought," he would declare
suddenly, with triumphant satisfaction. "'Upon the fifth,
however, in spite of the heavy rains which had made of the roads
quaking bogs, Jackson appeared suddenly from the South, at the
head of an army of 33,000 men.'"</p>

<p>Then they would wrangle furiously over the hour, the moment,
the place of dead event: each rushing from the room fiercely to
produce the document which would support his own contention.</p>

<p>"Your aunt, my boy, is not the woman she once was," Bascom
would say regretfully during her absence. "No question about
that! At one time she was a very remarkable woman! Yes, sir, a
woman of very considerable intelligence--considerable, that is,
for a woman," he said, with a slight sneer.</p>

<p>And she, whispering, when he had gone: "You have noticed, of
course, Gene?"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"His mind's going," she muttered. "What a head he had fifteen
years ago! But <i>now!</i>--Senile decay--G. Stanley
Hall--forgets everything--" she whispered hoarsely, as she heard
his returning footfalls.</p>

<p>Or, as the winter light darkened greyly, slashed on the
western sky by fierce cold red, his uncle passed sheaf after
sheaf of his verse to him, sniggering nosily, and prodding the
boy with his great fingers, while his aunt cleared the table or
listened to the music. The great majority of these verses,
laboured and pedantic as they were, were variations of the
<i>motif</i> of agnosticism, the horn on which his ministry in
the Church had fatally gored itself--and still a brand that
smouldered in his brain--not now so much from an all-mastering
conviction, as from some desire to justify himself. These verses,
which he asserted were modelled on those of his great hero,
Matthew Arnold, were all remarkably like this one:</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>MY CREED</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>"Is there a land beyond the stars<br>
 Where we may find eternal day,<br>
 Life after death, peace after wars?<br>
 Is there? I cannot say.<br>
 Shall we find there a happier life,<br>
 All joy that here we never know,<br>
 Love in all things, an end of strife?<br>
 Perhaps: it may be so."</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>And so on.</p>

<p>And sniggering down his nose, Bascom would prod the young man
stiffly with his great fingers, saying, as he slyly thrust
another verse into his hand:</p>

<p>"Something in a lighter vein, my boy. Just a little
foolishness, you know. (Phuh! Phuh! Phuh! Phuh! Phuh)" Which
was:</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Mary had a little calf,<br>
 It followed up her leg,<br>
 And everywhere that Mary went,<br>
 The boys were sure to beg."</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>And so on.</p>

<p>Uncle Bascom had hundreds of them: <i>Poems--Chiefly
Religious,</i> he sent occasionally to the morning papers. They
were sometimes printed in the Editor's Correspondence or The Open
Forum. But <i>Poems--Chiefly Profane</i> he kept apparently for
his own regalement.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Then, as it darkened, toward five o'clock, the boy would
depart, leaving them at times bitterly involved in a political
wrangle, with the strewn Sunday numbers of <i>The Boston
Herald</i> and <i>The Boston Post</i> around them, she parroting
intensely the newspaper jargon, assaulting Borah and "the Senate
iwweconcilables," he angrily defending Senator Lodge as a scholar
and a gentleman, with whom he had not always been in agreement,
but from whom he had once received a most courteous letter--a
fact which seemed to distinguish him in Bascom's mind as the
paragon of statesmanship.</p>

<p>And as Eugene left, he would note, with a swift inchoate pang,
the sudden mad loneliness in Aunt Louise's eyes, doomed for
another week to her grim imprisonment. But he did not know that
her distended and exhausted heart hissed audibly each time she
ascended from futile labour on the cold furnace, stoked with
cheap slag and coke, and that her thin blood was fed by gristly
butcher's leavings, in answer to the doctor's call for meat.</p>

<p>And his aunt would go with Eugene to the frost-glazed door,
open it, and stand huddled meagrely and hugging herself together
beneath the savage desolation of the Northern cold; talking to
him for a moment and calling brightly after him as he went down
the icy path: "Come again, boy! Always glad to see you!"</p>

<p>And in the dull cold Sunday light he strode away, his spirit
braced by the biting air, the Northern cold, the ragged bloody
sky, which was somehow prophetic to him of glorious fulfilment,
and at the same time depressed by the grey enormous weight of
Sunday tedium and dreariness all around him.</p>

<p>And yet, he never lost heart that out of this dullness he
would draw some rich adventure. He strode away with quickening
pulse, hoping to see it issue from every warmly lighted house, to
find it in the street cars, the subway or at a restaurant. Then
he would go back into the city and dine at one of the restaurants
where the pretty waitresses served him. Later he would go out on
the sparsely peopled Sunday streets, turning finally, as a last
resort, into Washington Street, where the moving-picture places
and cheap vaudeville houses were filled with their Sunday Irish
custom.</p>

<p>Sometimes he went in, but as one weary act succeeded the
other, and the empty brutal laughter of the people echoed in his
ears, seeming to him forced and dishonest, as if people laughed
at the ghosts of mirth, the rotten husks of stale wit, the
sordidness, hopelessness, and sterility of their lives oppressed
him hideously. On the stage he would see the comedian again
display his red neck-tie with a leer, and hear the people laugh
about it; he would hear again that someone was a big piece of
cheese, and listen to them roar; he would observe again the pert
and cheap young comedian with nothing to offer waste time
portentously, talk in a low voice with the orchestra leader; and
the only thing he liked would be the strength and balance of the
acrobats.</p>

<p>Finally, drowned in a sea-depth of grey horror, and with the
weary brutal laughter of the audience ringing in his ears, he
would rush out on the street again, filled with its hideous
Sunday dullness and the sterile wink of the chop-suey signs, and
take the train to Cambridge.</p>

<p>And there, as the night grew late, his spirit would surge up
in him; sunken in books at midnight, with the soft numb
prescience of brooding snow upon the air, the feeling of
exultancy, joy, and invincible strength would come back; and he
was sure that the door would open for him, the magic word be
spoken, and that he would make all of the glory, power, and
beauty of the earth his own.</p>

<p> </p>

<h1>XVIII</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>One day the boy telephoned the girl of whom his Uncle Bascom
had spoken. She was coy and cautious, but sounded hopeful: he
liked her voice. When, after some subtle circumlocutions, he
asked her for an early meeting, she countered swiftly by asking
him to meet her the following evening at the North Station: she
was coming in to town to perform at a dinner. She played the
violin. He understood very well that she was really anxious to
see him before admitting him to the secure licence of a suburban
parlour; so he bathed himself, threw powder under his arm-pits,
and put on a new shirt, which he bought for the occasion.</p>

<p>It was November: rain fell coldly and drearily. He buttoned
himself in his long raincoat and went to meet her. She had
promised to wear a red carnation; the suggestion was her own, and
tickled him hugely. As the pink-faced suburbanites poured, in an
icy stream, into the hot waiting-room, he looked for her.
Presently he saw her: she came toward him immediately, since his
height was unmistakable. They talked excitedly flustered, but
gradually getting some preliminary sense of each other.</p>

<p>She was a rather tall, slender girl, dressed in garments that
seemed to have been left over, in good condition, from the early
part of the century. She wore a flat but somehow towering hat: it
seemed to perch upon her head as do those worn by the Queen of
England. She was covered with a long blue coat, which flared and
bustled at the hips, and had screws and curls of black corded
ornament; she looked respectable and antiquated, but her costume,
and a na&iuml;ve stupidity in her manner, gave her a quaintness
that he liked. He took her to the subway, having arranged a
meeting at her home for the following night.</p>

<p>The girl, whose name was Genevieve Simpson, lived with her
mother and her brother, a heavy young lout of nineteen years, in
a two-family house at Melrose. The mother, a small, full,
dumpling-face woman, whose ordinary expression in repose, in
common with that of so many women of the middle class in America
who have desired one life and followed another and found perhaps
that its few indispensable benefits, as security, gregariousness,
decorum, have not been as all-sufficient as they had hoped, was
one of sullen, white, paunch-eyed discontent.</p>

<p>It was this inner petulance, the small carping disparagement
of everyone and everything that entered the mean light of her
world, that made absurdly palpable the burlesque mechanism of
social heartiness. Looking at her while she laughed with shrill
falsity at all the wrong places, he would rock with huge guffaws,
to which she would answer with eager renewal, believing that both
were united in their laughter over something of which she was, it
is true, a little vague.</p>

<p>It was, she felt, her business to make commercially attractive
to every young man the beauty and comfort of the life she had
made for her family, and although the secret niggling discontent
of their lives was plainly described on both her own and her
daughter's face, steeped behind their transparent masks in all
the small poisons of irritability and bitterness, they united in
their pretty tableau before the world--a tableau, he felt,
something like those final exhibitions of grace and strength with
which acrobats finish the act, the strained smile of ease and
comfort, as if one could go on hanging by his toes for ever, the
grieving limbs, the whole wrought torture which will collapse in
exhausted relief the second the curtain hides it.</p>

<p>"We want you to feel absolutely at home here," she said
brightly. "Make this your headquarters. You will find us simple
folk here, without any frills," she continued, with a glance
around the living-room, letting her eye rest with brief
satisfaction upon the striped tiles of the hearth, the flowered
vases of the mantel, the naked doll, tied with a pink sash, on
the piano, and the pictures of "The Horse Fair," the lovers
flying before the storm, Maxfield Parrish's "Dawn," and Leonardo
da Vinci's "Last Supper," which broke the spaces of the wall,
"but if you like a quiet family life, a welcome is always waiting
for you here. Oh, yes--everyone is for each other here: we keep
no secrets from each other in our little family."</p>

<p>Eugene thought that this was monstrous if it was true; a swift
look at Genevieve and Mama convinced him, however, that not
everything was being told. A mad exultancy arose in him: the old
desire returned again to throw a bomb into the camp, in order to
watch its effect; to express murderous opinions in a gentle
Christian voice, further entrenched by an engaging
matter-of-factness, as if he were but expressing the commonplace
thought of all sensible people; bawdily, lewdly, shockingly with
a fine assumption of boyish earnestness, sincerity, and
na&iuml;vet&eacute;. So, in a voice heavily coated with burlesque
feeling, he said: "Thank you, thank you, Mrs. Simpson. You have
no idea what it means to me to be able to come to a place like
this."</p>

<p>"I know," said Genevieve with fine sympathy, "when you're a
thousand miles from home--"</p>

<p>"A thousand!" he cried, with a bitter laugh, "a thousand! Say
rather a million." And he waited, almost squealing in his throat,
until they should bite.</p>

<p>"But--but your home is in the South, isn't it?" Mrs. Simpson
inquired doubtfully.</p>

<p>"Home! Home!" cried he, with raucous laugh. "I have no
home!"</p>

<p>"Oh, you poor boy!" said Genevieve.</p>

<p>"But your parents--are they <i>both</i> dead?"</p>

<p>"No!" he answered, with a sad smile. "They are both
living."</p>

<p>There was a pregnant silence.</p>

<p>"They do not live together," he added after a moment, feeling
he could not rely on their deductive powers.</p>

<p>"O-o-oh," said Mrs. Simpson significantly, running the vowel
up and down the vocal scale. "O-o-oh!"</p>

<p>"Nasty weather, isn't it?" he remarked, deliberately drawing a
loose cigarette from his pocket. "I wish it would snow: I like
your cold Northern winters as only a Southerner can like them; I
like the world at night when it is muffled, enclosed with snow; I
like a warm secluded house, sheltered under heavy fir trees, with
the curtains drawn across a mellow light, and books, and a
beautiful woman within. These are some of the things I like."</p>

<p>"Gee!" said the boy, his heavy blond head leaned forward
intently. "What was the trouble?"</p>

<p>"Jimmy! Hush!" cried Genevieve, and yet they all looked toward
Eugene with eager intensity.</p>

<p>"The trouble?" said he, vacantly. "What trouble?"</p>

<p>"Between your father and mother?"</p>

<p>"Oh," he said carelessly, "he beat her."</p>

<p>"Aw-w! He hit her with his fist?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no. He generally used a walnut walking-stick. It got too
much for her finally. My mother, even then, was not a young
woman--she was almost fifty, and she could not stand the gaff so
well as she could in her young days. I'll never forget that last
night," he said, gazing thoughtfully into the coals with a smile.
"I was only seven, but I remember it all very well. Papa had been
brought home drunk by the mayor."</p>

<p>"The <i>mayor?"</i></p>

<p>"Oh, yes," said Eugene casually. "They were great friends. The
mayor often brought him home when he was drunk. But he was very
violent that time. After the mayor had gone, he stamped around
the house smashing everything he could get his hands on, cursing
and blaspheming at the top of his voice. My mother stayed in the
kitchen and paid no attention to him when he entered. This, of
course, infuriated him. He made for her with the poker. She saw
that at last she was up against it; but she had realized that
such a moment was inevitable. She was not unprepared. So she
reached in the flour bin and got her revolver--"</p>

<p>"Did she have a revolver?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," he said nonchalantly, "my Uncle Will had given it
to her as a Christmas present. Knowing my father as he did, he
told her it might come in handy sometime. Mama was forced to
shoot at him three times before he came to his senses."</p>

<p>There was a silence.</p>

<p>"Gee!" said the boy, finally. "Did she hit him?"</p>

<p>"Only once," Eugene replied, tossing his cigarette into the
fire. "A flesh wound in the leg. A trifle. He was up and about in
less than a week. But, of course, Mama had left him by that
time."</p>

<p>"Well!" said Mrs. Simpson, after a yet longer silence, "I've
never had to put up with anything like <i>that."</i></p>

<p>"No, thank heaven!" said Genevieve fervently. Then, curiously:
"Is--is your mother Mr. Pentland's sister?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And the uncle who gave her the revolver--Mr. Pentland's
brother?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," Eugene answered readily. "It's all the same
family." He grinned in his entrails, thinking of Uncle
Bascom.</p>

<p>"Mr. Pentland seems a very educated sort of man," said Mrs.
Simpson, having nothing else to say.</p>

<p>"Yes. We went to see him when we were hunting for a house,"
Genevieve added. "He was very nice to us. He told us he had once
been in the ministry."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Eugene. "He was a Man of God for more than twenty
years--one of the most eloquent, passionate, and gifted
soul-savers that ever struck fear into the hearts of the
innumerable sinners of the American nation. In fact, I know of no
one with whom to compare him, unless I turn back three centuries
to Jonathan Edwards, the Puritan divine, who evoked, in a quiet
voice like the monotonous dripping of water, a picture of
hell-fire so near that the skins of the more imaginative fanatics
on the front rows visibly blistered. However, Edwards spoke for
two and a half hours: Uncle Bascom, with his mad and beautiful
tongue, has been known to drive people insane with terror in
twenty-seven minutes by the clock. There are still people in the
asylums that he put there," he said piously. "I hope," he added
quickly, "you didn't ask him why he had left the Church."</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" said Genevieve. "We never did that."</p>

<p>"Why did he?" asked Mrs. Simpson bluntly, who felt that now
she had only to ask and it would be given. She was not
disappointed.</p>

<p>"It was the centuries-old conflict between organized authority
and the individual," said Eugene. "No doubt you have felt it in
your own lives. Uncle Bascom was a poet, a philosopher, a
mystic--he had the soul of an artist which must express divine
love and ideal beauty in corporeal form. Such a man as this is
not going to be shackled by the petty tyrannies of ecclesiastical
convention. An artist must love and be loved. He must be swept by
the Flow of Things, he must be a constantly expanding atom in the
rhythmic surges of the Life Force. Who knew this better than
Uncle Bascom when he first met the choir contralto?"</p>

<p>"Contralto!" gasped Genevieve.</p>

<p>"Perhaps she was a soprano," said Eugene. "It skills not.
Suffice it to say they lived, they loved, they had their little
hour of happiness. Of course, when the child came--"</p>

<p>"The child!" screamed Mrs. Simpson.</p>

<p>"A bouncing boy. He weighed thirteen pounds at birth and is at
the present a Lieutenant Commander in the United States
Navy."</p>

<p>"What became of--her?" said Genevieve.</p>

<p>"Of whom?"</p>

<p>"The--the contralto."</p>

<p>"She died--she died in childbirth."</p>

<p>"But--but Mr. Pentland?" inquired Mrs. Simpson in an uncertain
voice. "Didn't he--marry her?"</p>

<p>"How could he?" Eugene answered with calm logic. "He was
married to someone else."</p>

<p>And casting his head back, suddenly he sang: "You know I'm in
love with some-boddy else, so why can't you leave me alone?"</p>

<p>"Well, I <i>never!"</i> Mrs. Simpson stared dumbly into the
fire.</p>

<p>"Well, <i>hardly</i> ever," Eugene became allusively
Gilbertian. "She hardly ever has a Big, Big B." And he sang
throatily: "Oh, yes! Oh, yes, in-deed!" relapsing immediately
into a profound and moody abstraction, but noting with delight
that Genevieve and her mother were looking at him furtively, with
frightened and bewildered glances.</p>

<p>"Say!" The boy, whose ponderous jowl had been sunken on his
fist for ten minutes, now at length distilled a question.
"Whatever became of your father? Is he still living?"</p>

<p>"No!" said Eugene, after a brief pause, returning suddenly to
fact. "No! He's still dying."</p>

<p>And he fixed upon them suddenly the battery of his fierce
eyes, lit with horror:</p>

<p>"He has a cancer." After a moment, he concluded: "My father is
a very great man."</p>

<p>They looked at him in stricken bewilderment.</p>

<p>"Gee!" said the boy, after another silence. "That guy's worse
than our old man!"</p>

<p>"Jimmy! Jimmy!" whispered Genevieve scathingly.</p>

<p>There was a very long, for the Simpson family, a very painful,
silence.</p>

<p>"Aha! Aha!" Eugene's head was full of <i>ahas.</i></p>

<p>"I suppose you have thought it strange," Mrs. Simpson began
with a cracked laugh, which she strove to make careless, "that
you have never seen Mr. Simpson about when you called?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he answered with a ready dishonesty, for he had never
thought of it at all. But he reflected at the same moment that
this was precisely the sort of thing people were always thinking
of: suddenly before the embattled front of that little family,
its powers aligned for the defence of reputation, he felt lonely,
shut out. He saw himself looking in at them through a window: all
communication with life grouped and protected seemed for ever
shut off.</p>

<p>"Mother decided some months ago that she could no longer live
with Father," said Genevieve, with sad dignity.</p>

<p>"Sure," volunteered Jimmy, "he's livin' with another
woman!"</p>

<p>"Jimmy!" said Genevieve hoarsely.</p>

<p>Eugene had a momentary flash of humorous sympathy with the
departed Simpson; then he looked at her white bickering face and
felt sorry for her. She carried her own punishment with her.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Shall a man be dead within your heart before his rotten flesh
be wholly dead within the ground, and before the producing fats
and syrup cease to give life to his growing hair? Shall a man so
soon be done with that which still provides a nest for working
maggotry or shall a brother leave a brother's memory before the
worms have left his tissue? This is a pregnant subject: there
should be laws passed, and a discipline, which train a man to
greater constancy. And suddenly, out of this dream of time in
which he lived, he would awaken, and instantly, like a man freed
from the spell of an enchantment which has held him captive for
many years in some strange land, he would remember home with an
intolerable sense of pain and loss, the lost world of his
childhood, and feel the strange and bitter miracle of life and
have no words for what he wished to say.</p>

<p>That lost world would come back to him at many times, and
often for no cause that he could trace or fathom--a voice
half-heard, a word far-spoken, a leaf, a light that came and
passed and came again. But always when that lost world would come
back, it came at once, like a sword-thrust through the entrails,
in all its panoply of past time, living, whole, and magic as it
had always been.</p>

<p>And always when it came to him, and at whatever time, and for
whatever reason, he could hear his father's great voice sounding
in the house again and see his gaunt devouring stride as he had
come muttering round the corner at the hour of noon long years
before.</p>

<p>And then he would hear again the voice of his dead brother,
and remember with a sense of black horror, dream-like disbelief,
that Ben was dead, and yet could not believe that Ben had ever
died, or that he had had a brother, lost a friend. Ben would come
back to him in these moments with a blazing and intolerable
reality, until he heard his quiet living voice again, saw his
fierce scowling eyes of bitter grey, his scornful, proud and
lively face, and always when Ben came back to him it was like
this: he saw his brother in a single image, in some brief
forgotten moment of the past, remembered him by a word, a
gesture, a forgotten act; and certainly all that could ever be
known of Ben's life was collected in that blazing image of lost
time and the forgotten moment. And suddenly he would be there in
a strange land, staring upward from his bed in darkness, hearing
his brother's voice again, and living in the far and bitter
miracle of time.</p>

<p>And always now, when Ben came back to him, he came within the
frame and limits of a single image, one of those instant blazing
images which from this time would haunt his memory and which more
and more, as a kind of distillation--a reward for all the savage
struggles of his Faustian soul with the protean and
brain-maddening forms of life--were to collect and concentrate
the whole material of experience and memory, in which the process
of ten thousand days and nights could in an instant be resumed.
And the image in which Ben now always came to him was this: he
saw his brother standing in a window, and an old red light of
fading day, and all the strange and tragic legend of his destiny
was on his brow, and all that any man could ever see or know or
understand of his dead brother's life was there.</p>

<p>Bitter and beautiful, scorn no more. Ben stands there in the
window, for a moment idle, his strong, lean fingers resting
lightly on his bony hips, his grey eyes scowling fiercely,
bitterly and contemptuously over the laughing and exuberant faces
of the crowd. For a moment more he scowls fixedly at them with an
expression of almost savage contempt. Then scornfully he turns
away from them. The bitter, lean and pointed face, the shapely,
flashing, close-cropped head jerks upward, backward, he laughs
briefly and with pitying contempt as he speaks to that unknown
and invisible auditor who all his life has been the eternal
confidant and witness of his scorn.</p>

<p>"Oh my God!" he says, jerking his scornful head out towards
the crowd again. "Listen to this, will you?"</p>

<p>They look at him with laughing and exuberant faces, unwounded
by his scorn. They look at him with a kind of secret and unspoken
tenderness which the strange and bitter savour of his life awakes
in people always. They look at him with faith, with pride, with
the joy and confidence and affection which his presence stirs in
everyone. And as if he were the very author of their fondest
hopes, as if he were the fiat, not the helpless agent, of the
thing they long to see accomplished, they yell to him in their
unreasoning exuberance: "All right, Ben! Give us a hit now! A
single's all we need, boy! Bring him in!" Or others, crying with
the same exuberance of faith: "Strike him out, Ben! Make him
fan!"</p>

<p>But now the crowd, sensing the electric thrill and menace of a
decisive conflict, has grown still, is waiting with caught breath
and pounding hearts, their eyes fixed eagerly on Ben. Somewhere,
a thousand miles to the North, somewhere through the reddened,
slanting and fast-fading light of that October day, somewhere
across the illimitable fields and folds and woods and hills and
hollows of America, across the huge brown earth, the mown fields,
the vast wild space, the lavish, rude and unfenced distances, the
familiar, homely, barren, harsh, strangely haunting scenery of
the nation; somewhere through the crisp, ripe air, the misty,
golden pollenated light of all her prodigal and careless harvest;
somewhere far away at the heart of the great sky-soaring,
smoke-gold, and enchanted city of the North, and of their
vision--the lean right arm of the great pitcher Mathewson is
flashing like a whip. A greyhound of a man named Speaker, quick
as a deer to run, sharp as a hawk to see, swift as a cat to
strike, stands facing him. And the huge terrific stands, packed
to the eaves incredibly with mounting tiers of small white faces,
now all breathless, silent, and intent, all focused on two men as
are the thoughts, the hearts, the visions of these people
everywhere in little towns, soar back, are flung to the farthest
edges of the field in a vision of power, of distance, space and
lives unnumbered, fused into a single unity that is so terrific
that it bursts the measures of our comprehension and has a
dream-like strangeness of reality even when we see it.</p>

<p>The scene is instant, whole and wonderful. In its beauty and
design that vision of the soaring stands, the pattern of forty
thousand empetalled faces, the velvet and unalterable geometry of
the playing field, and the small lean figures of the players, set
there, lonely, tense and waiting in their places, bright,
desperate solitary atoms encircled by that huge wall of nameless
faces, is incredible. And more than anything, it is the light,
the miracle of light and shade and colour--the crisp, blue light
that swiftly slants out from the soaring stands and, deepening to
violet, begins to march across the velvet field and towards the
pitcher's box, that gives the thing its single and incomparable
beauty.</p>

<p>The batter stands swinging his bat and grimly waiting at the
plate, crouched, tense, the catcher, crouched, the umpire, bent,
hands clasped behind his back, and peering forward. All of them
are set now in the cold blue of that slanting shadow, except the
pitcher, who stands out there all alone, calm, desperate, and
forsaken in his isolation, with the gold-red swiftly fading light
upon him, his figure legible with all the resolution, despair and
lonely dignity which that slanting, somehow fatal light can give
him. Deep lilac light is eating swiftly in from every corner of
the field now, and far off there is a vision of the misty, golden
and October towers of the terrific city. The scene is
unforgettable in the beauty, intoxication and heroic feeling of
its incredible design, and yet, as overwhelming as the spectacle
may be for him who sees it, it is doubtful if the eye-witness has
ever felt its mystery, beauty, and strange loveliness as did that
unseen and unseeing audience in a little town.</p>

<p>But now the crowd, sensing the menaceful approach of a
decisive moment, has grown quiet and tense and breathless, as it
stands there in the street. In the window, Ben sets the earphones
firmly with his hands, his head goes down, the scowl between his
grey eyes deepens to a look of listening intensity. He begins to
speak sharply to a young man standing at a table on the floor
behind him. He snaps his fingers nervously, a cardboard placard
is handed to him, he looks quickly at it, and then thrusts it
back, crying irritably:</p>

<p>"No, no, no! Strike one, I said! Damn it, Mac, you're about as
much help to me as a wooden Indian!"</p>

<p>The young man on the floor thrusts another placard in his
hand. Ben takes it quickly, swiftly takes out a placard from the
complicated frame of wires and rows and columns in the window
(for it is before the day of the electric Scoreboard, and this
clumsy and complicated system whereby every strike, ball,
substitution, or base hit--every possible movement and event that
can occur upon the field--must be indicated in this way by
placards printed with the exact information, is the only one they
know) and thrusts a new placard on the line in place of the one
that he has just removed. A cheer, sharp, lusty, and immediate,
goes up from the crowd. Ben speaks sharply and irritably to the
dark and sullen-featured youth whose name is Foxey and Foxey runs
outside quickly with another placard inscribed with the name of a
new player who is coming in. Swiftly, Foxey takes out of its
groove the name of the departing player, shoves the new one into
place, and this time the rival partisans in the crowd cheer for
the pitch hitter.</p>

<p>In the street now there is the excited buzz and hum of
controversy. The people, who, with a strange and somehow moving
loyalty, are divided into two groups supporting the merits of two
teams which they have never seen, are eagerly debating, denying,
making positive assertions of what is likely to happen, which are
obviously extravagant and absurd in a contest where nothing can
be predicted, and so much depends on fortune, chance, and the
opportunity of the moment.</p>

<p>In the very forefront of the crowd, a little to the right as
Ben stands facing them, a well-dressed man in the late fifties
can be seen excitedly discussing the prospect of the game with
several of his companions. His name is Fagg Sluder, a citizen
well known to every one in town. He is a man who made a fortune
as a contractor and retired from active business several years
ago, investing part of his wealth in two or three large office
buildings, and who now lives on the income he derives from
them.</p>

<p>He is a nervous energetic figure of a man, of middle height,
with greying hair, a short-cropped moustache, and the dry,
spotted, slightly concave features which characterize many
Americans of his age. A man who, until recent years, has known
nothing but hard work since his childhood, he has now developed,
in his years of leisure, an enthusiastic devotion to the game,
that amounts to an obsession.</p>

<p>He has not only given to the town the baseball park which
bears his name, he is also president of the local Club, and
uncomplainingly makes good its annual deficit. During the playing
season his whole time is spent in breathing, thinking, talking
baseball all day long: if he is not at the game, bent forward in
his seat behind the home plate in an attitude of ravenous
absorption, occasionally shouting advice and encouragement to the
players in his rapid, stammering, rather high-pitched voice that
has a curiously incisive penetration and carrying power, then he
is up on the Square before the fire department going over every
detail of the game with his cronies and asking eager, rapid-fire
questions of the young red-necked players he employs, and towards
whom he displays the worshipful admiration of a schoolboy.</p>

<p>Now this man, who, despite his doctor's orders, smokes twenty
or thirty strong black cigars a day, and in fact is never to be
seen without a cigar in his fingers or in his mouth, may be heard
all over the crowd speaking eagerly in his rapid, stammering
voice to a man with a quiet and pleasant manner who stands behind
him. This is the assistant chief of the fire department and his
name is Bickett.</p>

<p>"Jim," Mr. Sluder is saying in his eager and excited way,
"I--I--I--I tell you what I think! If--if--if Speaker comes up
there again with men on bases--I--I--I just believe Matty will
strike him out--I swear I do. What do you think?" he demands
eagerly and abruptly.</p>

<p>Mr. Bickett, first pausing to draw slowly and languorously on
a cigarette before casting it into the gutter, makes some easy,
quiet and non-committal answer which satisfies Mr. Sluder
completely, since he is paying no attention to him, anyway.
Immediately, he claps the chewed cigar which he is holding in his
stubby fingers into his mouth, and nodding his head briskly and
vigorously, with an air of great decision, he stammers out
again:</p>

<p>"Well--I--I--I just believe that's what he's going to do:
I--I--I don't think he's afraid of that fellow at all! I--I--I
think he knows he can strike him out any time he feels like
it."</p>

<p>The boy knows everyone in the crowd as he looks around him.
Here are the other boys of his own age, and older--his fellow
route-boys in the morning's work, his school companions, delivery
boys employed by druggists, merchants, clothiers, the sons of the
more wealthy and prominent people of the town. Here are the boys
from the eastern part of town from which he comes and in which
his father's house is built--the older, homelier, and for some
reason more joyful and confident part of town to him--though why,
he does not know, he cannot say. Perhaps it is because the hills
along the eastern borders of the town are near and close and
warm, and almost to be touched. But in the western part of town,
the great vistas of the soaring ranges, the distant summits of
the Smokies fade far away into the west, into the huge
loneliness, the haunting desolation of the unknown distance, the
red, lonely light of the powerful retreating sun.</p>

<p>But now the old red light is slanting swiftly, the crowd is
waiting tense and silent, already with a touch of sorrow,
resignation, and the winter in their hearts, for summer's over,
the game is ending, and October has come again, has come again.
In the window, where the red slant of the sun already falls, Ben
is moving quickly, slipping new placards into place, taking old
ones out, scowling, snapping his hard, white fingers in command,
speaking curtly, sharply, irritably to the busy figures, moving
at his bidding on the floor. The game--the last game of the
series--is sharp, close, bitterly contested. No one can say as
yet which way the issue goes, which side will win, when it will
end--but that fatality of red slanting light, the premonitory
menace of the frost, the fatal certitude of victory and defeat,
with all the sorrow and regret that both can bring to man, are in
their hearts.</p>

<p>From time to time, a wild and sudden cheer breaks sharply from
the waiting crowd, as something happens to increase their hope of
victory, but for the most part they are tense and silent now, all
waiting for the instant crisis, the quick end.</p>

<p>Behind Ben, seated in a swivel chair, but turned out facing
toward the crowd, the boy can see the gouty bulk of Mr. Flood,
the owner of the paper. He is bent forward heavily in his seat,
his thick apoplectic fingers braced upon his knees, his mouth
ajar, his coarse, jowled, venously empurpled face and bulging
yellow eyes turned out upon the crowd, in their constant
expression of slow stupefaction. From time to time, when the
crowd cheers loudly, the expression of brutal surprise upon Mr.
Flood's coarse face will deepen perceptibly and comically, and in
a moment he will say stupidly, in his hoarse and phlegmy
tones:</p>

<p>"Who done that? . . . What are they yelling for? . . . Which
side's ahead now? . . . What happened that time, Ben?"</p>

<p>To which Ben usually makes no reply whatever, but the savage
scowl between his grey eyes deepens with exasperation, and
finally, cursing bitterly, he says:</p>

<p>"Damn it, Flood! What do you think I am--the whole damned
newspaper? For heaven's sake, man, do you think all I've got to
do is answer damn-fool questions? If you want to know what's
happening, go outside where the rest of them are!"</p>

<p>"Well, Ben, I just wanted to know how--" Mr. Flood begins
hoarsely, heavily, and stupidly.</p>

<p>"Oh, for God's sake! Listen to this, won't you?" says Ben,
laughing scornfully and contemptuously as he addresses the
invisible auditor of his scorn, and jerking his head sideways
toward the bloated figure of his employer as he does so. "Here!"
he says, in a disgusted manner. "For God's sake, someone go and
tell him what the score is, and put him out of his misery!" And
scowling savagely, he speaks sharply into the mouthpiece of the
phone and puts another placard on the line.</p>

<p>And suddenly, even as the busy figures swarm and move there in
the window before the waiting crowd, the bitter thrilling game is
over! In waning light, in faint shadows, far, far away in a great
city of the North, the 40,000 small empetalled faces bend
forward, breathless, waiting--single and strange and beautiful as
all life, all living, and man's destiny. There's a man on base,
the last flash of the great right arm, the crack of the bat, the
streaking white of a clean-hit ball, the wild, sudden, solid
roar, a pair of flashing legs have crossed the rubber, and the
game is over! And instantly, there at the city's heart, in the
great stadium, and all across America, in ten thousand streets,
ten thousand little towns, the crowd is breaking, flowing, lost
for ever! That single, silent, most intolerable loveliness is
gone for ever. With all its tragic, proud and waiting unity, it
belongs now to the huge, the done, the indestructible fabric of
the past, has moved at last out of that inscrutable maw of chance
we call the future into the strange finality of dark time.</p>

<p>Now it is done, the crowd is broken, lost, exploded, and
10,000,000 men are moving singly down 10,000 streets--toward
what? Some by the light of Hesperus which, men say, can bring all
things that live on earth to their own home again--flock to the
fold, the father to his child, the lover to the love he has
forsaken--and the proud of heart, the lost, the lonely of the
earth, the exile and the wanderer--to what? To pace again the
barren avenues of night, to pass before the bulbous light of
lifeless streets with half-averted faces, to pass the thousand
doors, to feel again the ancient hopelessness of hope, the
knowledge of despair, the faith of desolation.</p>

<p>And for a moment, when the crowd has gone, Ben stands there
silent, lost, a look of bitter weariness, disgust, and agony upon
his grey gaunt face, his lonely brow, his fierce and scornful
eyes. And as he stands there that red light of waning day has
touched the flashing head, the gaunt, starved face, has touched
the whole image of his fiercely wounded, lost and scornful spirit
with the prophecy of its strange fatality. And in that instant as
the boy looks at his brother, a knife is driven through his
entrails suddenly, for with an instant final certitude, past
reason, proof, or any visual evidence, he sees the end and answer
of his brother's life. Already death rests there on his proud
head like a coronal. The boy knows in that one instant Ben will
die.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>He visited Genevieve frequently over a period of several
months. As his acquaintance with the family deepened, the
sharpness of his appetite for seduction dwindled, and was
supplanted by an ecstatic and insatiable glee. He felt that he
had never in his life been so enormously and constantly amused:
he would think exultantly for days of an approaching visit,
weaving new and more preposterous fables for their consumption,
bursting into violent laughter on the streets as he thought of
past scenes, the implication of a tone, a gesture, the
transparent artifice of mother and daughter, the incredible
exaggeration of everything.</p>

<p>He was charmed, enchanted: his mind swarmed daily with
monstrous projects--his heart quivered in a tight cage of nervous
exultancy as he thought of the infinite richness of absurdity
that lay stored for him. His ethical conscience was awakened
hardly at all--he thought of these three people as monsters
posturing for his delight. His hatred of cruelty, the nauseating
horror at the idiotic brutality of youth, had not yet
sufficiently defined itself to check his plunge. He was swept
along in the full tide of his adventure: he thought of nothing
else.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Through an entire winter, and into the spring, he went to see
this little family in a Boston suburb. Then he got tired of the
game and the people as suddenly as he had begun, with the
passionate boredom, weariness, and intolerance of which youth is
capable. And now that the affair was ending, he was at last
ashamed of the part he had played in it and of the arrogant
contempt with which he had regaled himself at the expense of
other people. And he knew that the Simpsons had themselves at
length become conscious of the meaning of his conduct, and saw
that, in some way, he had made them the butt of a joke. And when
they saw this, the family suddenly attained a curious quiet
dignity, of which he had not believed them capable and which
later he could not forget.</p>

<p>One night, as he was waiting in the parlour for the girl to
come down, her mother entered the room, and stood looking at him
quietly for a moment. Presently she spoke:</p>

<p>"You have been coming here for some time now," she said, "and
we were always glad to see you. My daughter liked you when she
met you--she likes you yet--" the woman said slowly, and went on
with obvious difficulty and embarrassment. "Her welfare means
more to me than anything in the world--I would do anything to
save her from unhappiness or misfortune." She was silent a
moment, then said bluntly, "I think I have a right to ask you a
question: what are your intentions concerning her?"</p>

<p>He told himself that these words were ridiculous and part of
the whole comic and burlesque quality of the family, and yet he
found now that he could not laugh at them. He sat looking at the
fire, uncertain of his answer, and presently he muttered:</p>

<p>"I have no intentions concerning her."</p>

<p>"All right," the woman said quietly. "That is all I wanted to
know. . . . You are a young man," she went on slowly after a
pause, "and very clever and intelligent--but there are still a
great many things you do not understand. I know now that we
looked funny to you and you have amused yourself at our expense.
. . . I don't know why you thought it was such a joke, but I
think you will live to see the day when you are sorry for it.
It's not good to make a joke of people who have liked you and
tried to be your friends."</p>

<p>"I know it's not," he said, and muttered: "I'm sorry for it
now."</p>

<p>"Still, I can't believe," the woman said, "that you are a boy
who would wilfully bring sorrow and ruin to anyone who had never
done you any harm. . . . The only reason I am saying this is for
my daughter's sake."</p>

<p>"You don't need to worry about that," he said. "I'm sorry now
for acting as I have--but you know everything I've done. And I'll
not come back again. But I'd like to see her and tell her that
I'm sorry before I go."</p>

<p>"Yes," the woman said, "I think you ought."</p>

<p>She went out and a few minutes later the girl came down,
entered the room, and he said good-bye to her. He tried to make
amends to her with fumbling words, but she said nothing. She
stood very still as he talked, almost rigid, her lips pressed
tightly together, her hands clenched, winking back the tears.</p>

<p>"All right," she said finally, giving him her hand. "I'll say
good-bye to you without hard feelings. . . . Some day . . . some
day," her voice choked and she winked furiously--"I hope you'll
understand--oh, good-bye!" she cried, and turned away abruptly.
"I'm not mad at you any longer--and I wish you luck. . . . You
know so many things, don't you?--You're so much smarter than we
are, aren't you? . . . And I'm sorry for you when I think of all
you've got to learn . . . of what you're going through before you
do."</p>

<p>"Good-bye," he said.</p>

<p>He never saw any of them again, but he could not forget them.
And as the years went on, the memory of all their folly,
falseness, and hypocrisy was curiously altered and subdued and
the memory that grew more vivid and dominant was of a little
family, one of millions huddled below the immense and timeless
skies that bend above us, lost in the darkness of nameless and
unnumbered lives upon the lonely wilderness of life that is
America, and banked together against these giant antagonists, for
comfort, warmth, and love, with a courage and integrity that
would not die and could not be forgotten.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>One afternoon early in May, Helen met McGuire upon the street.
He had just driven in behind Wood's Pharmacy on Academy Street,
and was preparing to go in to the prescription counter when she
approached him. He got out of his big dusty-looking roadster with
a painful grunt, slammed the door, and began to fumble slowly in
the pockets of his baggy coat for a cigarette. He turned slowly
as she spoke, grunted, "Hello, Helen," stuck the cigarette on his
fat under-lip and lighted it, and then, looking at her with his
brutal, almost stupid, but somehow kindly glance, he barked
coarsely:</p>

<p>"What's on your mind?"</p>

<p>"It's about Papa," she began in a low, hoarse and almost
morbid tone--"Now I want to know if this last attack means that
the end has come. You've got to tell me--we've got the right to
know about it--"</p>

<p>The look of strain and hysteria on her big-boned face, her
dull eyes fixed on him in a morbid stare, the sore on her large
cleft chin, above all, the brooding insistence of her tone as she
repeated phrases he had heard ten thousand times before suddenly
rasped upon his frayed nerves, stretched them to the
breaking-point; he lost his air of hard professionalism and
exploded in a flare of brutal anger:</p>

<p>"You want to know what? You've got a right to be told what?
For God's sake,"--his tone was brutal, rasping, jeering--"pull
yourself together and stop acting like a child." And then, a
little more quietly, but brusquely, he demanded:</p>

<p>"All right. What do you want to know?"</p>

<p>"I want to know how long he's going to last," she said with
morbid insistence. "Now, you're a doctor," she wagged her large
face at him with an air of challenge that infuriated him, "and
you ought to tell us. We've got to know!"</p>

<p>"Tell you! Got to know!" he shouted. "What the hell are you
talking about? What do you expect to be told?"</p>

<p>"How long Papa has to live," she said with the same morbid
insistence as before.</p>

<p>"You've asked me that a thousand times," he said harshly.
"I've told you that I didn't know. He may live another month, he
may be here a year from now--how can we tell about these things,"
he said in an exasperated tone, "particularly where your father
is concerned. Helen, three or four years ago I might have made a
prediction. I did make them--I didn't see how W. O. could go on
six months longer. But he's fooled us all--you, me, the doctors
at Johns Hopkins, everyone who's had anything to do with the
case. The man is dying from malignant carcinoma--he has been
dying for years--his life is hanging by a thread and the thread
may break at any time--but when it is going to break I have no
way of telling you."</p>

<p>"Ah-hah," she said reflectively. Her eyes had taken on a dull
appeased look as he talked to her, and now she had begun to pluck
at her large cleft chin. "Then you think--" she began.</p>

<p>"I think nothing," he shouted. "And for God's sake stop
picking at your chin!"</p>

<p>For a moment he felt the sudden brutal anger that one
sometimes feels toward a contrary child. He felt like taking her
by the shoulders and shaking her. Instead, he took it out in
words and, scowling at her, said with brutal directness:</p>

<p>"Look here! . . . You've got to pull yourself together. You're
becoming a mental case--do you hear me? You wander around like a
person in a dream, you ask questions no one can answer, you
demand answers no one can give--you work yourself up into
hysterical frenzies and then you collapse and soak yourself with
drugs, patent medicines, corn-licker--anything that has alcohol
in it--for days at a time. When you go to bed at night you think
you hear voices talking to you, someone coming up the steps, the
telephone. And really you hear nothing: there is nothing there.
Do you know what that is?" he demanded brutally. "Those are
symptoms of insanity--you're becoming unbalanced; if it keeps on
they may have to send you to the crazy-house to take the
cure."</p>

<p>"Ah-hah! Uh-huh!" she kept plucking at her big chin with an
air of abstracted reflection and with a curious look of dull
appeasement in her eyes as if his brutal words had really given
her some comfort. Then she suddenly came to herself, looked at
him with clear eyes, and her generous mouth touched at the
corners with the big lewd tracery of her earthy humour, she
sniggered hoarsely, and prodding him in his fat ribs with a big
bony finger, she said:</p>

<p>"You think I've got 'em, do you? Well--" she nodded seriously
in agreement, frowning a little as she spoke, but with the faint
grin still legible around the corners of her mouth,--"I've often
thought the same thing. You may be right," she nodded seriously
again. "There are times when I do feel off--you
know?--<i>queer</i>--looney--crazy--like there was a screw loose
somewhere--Brrr!" and with the strange lewd mixture of frown and
grin, she made a whirling movement with her finger towards her
head. "What do you think it is?" she went on with an air of
seriousness. "Now, I'd just like to know. What is it that makes
me act like that? . . . Is it woman-business?" she said with a
lewd and comic look upon her face. "Am I getting funny like the
rest of them--now I've often thought the same--that maybe I'm
going through a change of life--is that it? Maybe--"</p>

<p>"Oh, change of life be damned!" he said in a disgusted tone.
"Here you are a young woman thirty-two years old and you talk to
me about a change of life! That has about as much sense to it as
a lot of other things you say! The only thing you change is your
mind--and you do that every five minutes!" He was silent for a
moment, breathing heavily and staring at her coarsely with his
bloated and unshaven face, his veined and weary-looking eyes.
When he spoke again his voice was gruff and quiet, touched with a
burly, almost paternal tenderness:</p>

<p>"Helen," he said, "I'm worried about you--and not about your
father. Your father is an old man now with a malignant cancer and
with no hope of ever getting well again. He is tired of life, he
wants to die--for God's sake why do you want to prolong his
suffering, to try to keep him here in a state of agony, when
death would be a merciful release for him? . . . I know there is
no hope left for your father: he has been doomed for years, the
sooner the end comes the better--"</p>

<p>She tried to speak but he interrupted her brusquely,
saying:</p>

<p>"Just a minute. There's something that I want to say to
you--for God's sake try to use it, if you can. The death of this
old man seems strange and horrible to you because he is your
father. It is as hard for you to think about his death as it is
to think about the death of God Almighty; you think that if your
father dies there will be floods and earthquakes and convulsions
throughout nature. I assure you that this is not true. Old men
are dying every second of the day, and nothing happens except
they die--"</p>

<p>"Oh, but Papa was a wonderful man," she said. "I <i>know</i>!
I <i>know!</i> Everybody who ever knew him said the same."</p>

<p>"Yes," McGuire agreed, "he was--he was one of the most
remarkable men I ever knew. And that is what makes it all the
harder now."</p>

<p>She looked at him eagerly, and said:</p>

<p>"You mean--his dying?"</p>

<p>"No, Helen," McGuire spoke quietly and with a weary patience.
"There's nothing very bad about his dying. Death seems so
terrible to you because you know so little about it. But I have
seen so much of death, I have seen so many people die--and I know
there is really nothing very terrible about it, and about the
death of an old man ravaged by disease there is nothing terrible
at all. It seems terrible to those looking on--there are," he
shrugged his fat shoulders, "there are sometimes--physical
details that are unpleasant. But the old man knows little of all
that: an old man dies as a clock runs down--he is worn out, has
lost the will to live, he wants to die, and he just stops. That
is all. And that will happen to your father."</p>

<p>"Oh, but it will be so strange now--so hard to understand!"
she muttered with a bewildered look in her eyes. "We have
expected him to die so many times--we have been fooled so
often--and now I can't believe that it will ever happen. I
thought that he would die in 1916, I never expected him to live
another year; in 1918, the year that Ben died, none of us could
see how he'd get through the winter--and then Ben died! No one
had even thought of Ben--" her voice grew cracked and hoarse and
her eyes glistened with tears. "We had forgotten Ben--everyone
was thinking about Papa--and then when Ben died I turned against
Papa for a time. For a while I was bitter against him--it seemed
that I had done everything for this old man, that I had given him
everything I had--my life, my strength, my energy--all because I
thought that he was going to die--and then Ben, who had never
been given anything--who had had nothing out of life--who had
been neglected and forgotten by us all and who was the best
one--the most decent of the whole crowd--Ben was the one who had
to go. For a time after his death I didn't care what happened--to
Papa or to any one else. I was so bitter about Ben's death--it
seemed so cruel, so rotten and unjust--that it had to be Ben of
all the people in the world--only twenty-six years old and
without a thing to show for his life--no love, no children, no
happiness, cheated out of everything, when Papa had had so
much--I couldn't stand the thought of it, even now I hate to go
to Mama's house, it almost kills me to go near Ben's room, I've
never been in it since the night he died--and somehow I was
bitter against Papa! It seemed to me that he had cheated me,
tricked me--at times I got so bitter that I thought that he was
responsible in some way for Ben's death. I said I was through
with him, that I would do nothing else for him, that I had done
all that I intended to do, and that somebody else would have to
take care of him. . . . But it all came back; he had another bad
spell and I was afraid that he was going to die, and I couldn't
stand the thought of it. . . . And it has gone on now so long,
<i>year</i> after year, and <i>year</i> after year," she said in
a frenzied tone, "always thinking that he couldn't last and
seeing him come back again, that I couldn't believe that it would
ever happen. I can't believe it now. . . . And what am I going to
do?" she said hoarsely and desperately, clutching McGuire by the
sleeve, "what am I going to do now if he really dies? What is
there left for me in life with Papa gone?" Her voice was almost
sobbing now with grief and desperation--"He's all I've got to
live for, Doctor McGuire. I've got nothing out of life that I
wanted or expected--it's all been so different from the way I
thought it was--I've had nothing--no fame, no glory, no success,
no children--everything has gone--Papa is all that I have left!
If he dies what shall I do?" she cried frantically, shaking him
by the sleeve. "That old man is all I've got--the only thing I've
got left to live for; to keep him alive, to make him comfortable,
to ease his pain, to see he gets good food and
attention--somehow, somehow," she panted desperately, clasping
her big bony hands in a gesture of unconscious but pitiable
entreaty, and beginning to rock unsteadily on her feet as she
spoke--"somehow, somehow, to keep life in him, to keep him here,
not to let him go--that's all I've got to live for--what in the
name of God am I going to do when that is taken from me?"</p>

<p>And she paused, panting and exhausted by her tirade, her big
face strained and quivering, glaring at him with an air of
frantic entreaty as if it was in his power to give the answers to
these frenzied questions. And for a moment he said nothing; he
just stood there looking at her with the coarse and brutal stare
of his blotched face, his venous yellowed eyes, the wet cigarette
stuck comically at the corner of one fat lip.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?" he barked, presently. "You're
going to get hold of yourself--pull yourself together--amount to
something, be somebody!" He coughed chokingly to one side, for a
moment there was just the sound of his thick short breathing,
then he flung the cigarette away, and said quietly:</p>

<p>"Helen, for God's sake, don't throw your life away! Don't
destroy the great creature that lies buried in you
somewhere--wake it up, make it come to life. Don't talk to me of
this old man's life as if it were your own--"</p>

<p>"It is, it is!" she said in a brooding tone of morbid
fatality.</p>

<p>"It is not!" he said curtly, "unless you make it so--unless
you play the weakling and the fool and throw yourself away. For
God's sake, don't let that happen to you. I have seen it happen
to so many people--some of them fine people like yourself, full
of energy, imagination, intelligence, ability--all thrown away,
frittered away like that," he flung fat fingers in the
air--"because they did not have the guts to use what God had
given them--to make a new life for themselves--to stand on their
own feet and not to lean upon another's shoulder! . . . Don't die
the death!" he rasped coarsely, staring at her with his brutal
face. "Don't die the rotten, lousy, dirty death-in-life--the only
death that's really horrible! For God's sake, don't betray life
and yourself and the people who love you by dying that kind of
death! I've seen it happen to so many people--and it was always
so damned useless, such a rotten waste! That's what I was trying
to say to you a few minutes ago--it's not the death of the dying
that is terrible, it is the death of the living. And we always
die that death for the same reason:--because our father dies, and
takes from us his own life, his world, his time--and we haven't
courage enough to make a new life, a new world for ourselves. I
wonder if you know how often that thing happens--how often I have
seen it happen--the wreck, the ruin, and the tragedy it has
caused in life! When the father goes, the whole structure of the
family life goes with him--and unless his children have the will,
the stuff, the courage to make something of their own, they die
too. . . . With you, it's going to be very hard when your father
dies; he was a man of great vitality and a strong personality who
has left a deep impression on everyone who knew him. And for
seven years now, your father's death has been your life. . . . It
has become a part of you, you have brooded over it, lived with
it, soaked in it, been tainted by it--and now it is going to be
hard for you to escape. But escape you must, and stand on your
own feet--or you are lost. . . . Helen!" he barked sharply, and
fixed her with his coarse and brutal stare--"listen to me:--your
childhood, Woodson Street, getting your father over drunks,
cooking for him, nursing him, feeding him, dressing and
undressing him--I know about it all, I saw it all--and now!"--he
paused, staring at her, then made a sudden gesture outward, palms
downward, of his two thick hands--"over, done for, gone for ever!
It's no good any more, it won't work any more, it can't be
brought back any more--forget about it!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I can't! I can't!" she said desperately. "I can't give
him up--I can't let him go--he's all I've got. Doctor McGuire,"
she said earnestly, "ever since I was a kid of ten and you first
came to get Papa over one of his sprees, I've fairly worshipped
you! I've always felt down in my heart that you were one of the
most wonderful people--the most wonderful doctor--in the world!
I've always felt that at the end you could do anything--perform a
miracle--bring him back. For God's sake, don't go back on me now!
Do something--anything you can--but save him, save him."</p>

<p>He was silent for a moment, and just stared at her with his
yellow, venous eyes. And when he spoke his voice was filled with
the most quiet and utter weariness of despair that she had ever
heard:</p>

<p>"Save him?" he said. "My poor child, I can save no
one--nothing--least of all myself."</p>

<p>And suddenly she saw that it was true; she saw that he was
lost, that he was done for, gone, and that he knew it. His coarse
and bloated face was mottled by great black purplish patches, his
yellow weary eyes already had the look of death in them; the
knowledge of death rested with an unutterable weariness in his
burly form, was audible in the short thick labour of his breath.
She saw instantly that he was going to die, and with that
knowledge her heart was torn with a rending pity as if a knife
had been driven through it and twisted there; all of the
brightness dropped out of the day, and in that moment it seemed
that the whole substance and structure of her life was gone.</p>

<p>The day was a shining one, full of gold and sapphire and
sparkle, and in the distance, toward the east, she could see the
sweet familiar green of hills. She knew that nothing had been
changed at all, and yet even the brightness of the day seemed
dull and common to her. It served only to make more mean and
shabby the rusty buildings and the street before her. And the
bright light filled her with a nameless uneasiness and sense of
shame: it seemed to expose her, to show her imperfections
nakedly, and instinctively she turned away from it into the
drug-store, where there were coolness, artificial lights and
gaiety, the clamour of voices and people that she knew. And she
knew that most of them had come here for the same reason--because
the place gave them a sort of haven, however brief and shabby,
from the naked brightness of the day and their sense of
indefinable uncertitude and shame--because "it was the only place
there was to go."</p>

<p>Several young people, two girls and a boy were coming down
among the crowded tables towards one of the mirrored booths
against the wall, where another boy and girl were waiting for
them. As they approached, she heard their drawling voices,
talking "cute nigger-talk" as her mind contemptuously phrased it,
the vapid patter phrased to a monotonous formula of "charm,"
inane, cheap, completely vulgar, and as if they had been ugly
little monsters of some world of dwarfs she listened to them with
a detached perspective of dislike and scorn.</p>

<p>One of the girls--the one already in the booth--was calling to
the others in tones of playful protest, in her "cute," mannered,
empty little voice:</p>

<p><i>"Hey</i>! theah, you all! <i>Wheah</i> you been! Come
<i>on,</i> heah, man!" she cried urgently and reproachfully
toward the approaching youth--"We been lookin' up an' down faw
you! What you been doin', anyhow?" she cried with reproachful
curiosity. "We been <i>waitin'</i> heah an' waitin' heah until it
seemed lak you nevah <i>would</i> come! We wuh about to give you
up!"</p>

<p>"Child!" another of the girls drawled back, and made a languid
movement of the hand--a move indicative of resignation and
defeat. "Don't tawk! I thought we nevah would get away. . . .
That Jawdan woman came in to see Mothah just as me an' Jim was
fixin' to go out, an' child!"--again the languid movement of
exhaustion and defeat--"when that woman gits stahted tawkin' you
might as well give up! No one else can git a wuhd in edgeways.
I'll declayah!" the voice went up, and the hand again made its
languid movement of surrender--"I nevah huhd the lak of it in all
mah days! That's the tawkinest woman that evah lived. You'd
a-died if you could a-seen the way Jim looked. I thought he was
goin' to pass right out befoah we got away from theah!"</p>

<p>"Lady," said Jim, who had as yet taken no part in the
conversation, "you <i>said</i> it! It sho'ly is the truth! That
sho is <i>one</i> tawkin' woman--an' I don't mean <i>maybe,</i>
eithah!" He drawled these words out with an air of pert
facetiousness, and then looked round him with a complacent smirk
on his young, smooth, empty face to see if his display of wit had
been noticed and properly appreciated.</p>

<p>And Helen, passing by, kept smiling, plucking at her chin
abstractedly, feeling toward these young people a weary disgust
that was tinged with a bitter and almost personal animosity.</p>

<p>"Awful little made-up girls . . . funny-looking little boys .
. . nothing to do but hang out here and loaf . . . walk up and
down the street . . . and drink coca-cola all day long . . . and
to think it seemed so wonderful to me when I was a kid, to dress
up and go up town and come in here where Papa was. . . . How dull
and cheap and dreary it all is!"</p>

<p> </p>

<p>A little after three o'clock one morning in June, Hugh McGuire
was seated at his desk in the little office which stood just to
the left of the entrance hall at the Altamont Hospital, of which
institution he was chief of staff and principal owner. McGuire's
burly bloated form was seated in a swivel chair and sprawled
forward, his fat arms resting on the desk, which was an
old-fashioned roll-top affair with a number of small cubby-holes
above and with two parallel rows of drawers below. In the space
below the desk and between the surgeon's fat legs there was a
gallon jug of corn whisky.</p>

<p>And on the desk there was a stack of letters which had also
been delivered to him the day before. The letters had been
written to one of McGuire's own colleagues by a certain very
beautiful lady of the town, of whom it is only necessary to say
that she was not McGuire's wife and that he had known her for a
long time. The huge man--curiously enough, not only a devoted
father and a loyal husband, but a creature whose devotion to his
family had been desperately intensified by the bitter sense of
his one unfaith--had been for many years obsessed by one of those
single, fatal and irremediable passions which great creatures of
this sort feel only once in life, and for just one woman. Now the
obsession of that mad fidelity was gone--exploded in an instant
by a spidery scheme of words upon a page, a packet of torn
letters in a woman's hand. Hence, this sense now of a stolid,
slow, and cureless anguish in the man, the brutal deliberation of
his drunkenness. Since finding these letters upon his desk when
he had returned at seven o'clock the night before from his visit
to Gant, McGuire had not left his office or moved in his chair,
except to bend with a painful grunt from time to time, feel
between his legs with a fat hand until he found the jug, and
then, holding it with a bear-like solemnity between his paws,
drink long and deep of the raw, fiery, and colourless liquid in
the jug. He had done this very often, and now the jug was
two-thirds empty. As he read, his mouth was half open and a
cigarette was stuck on the corner of one fat lip, a look that
suggested a comical drunken stupefaction. The hospital had long
since gone to sleep, and in the little office there was no sound
save the ticking of a clock and McGuire's short, thick, and
stertorous breathing. Then when he had finished a letter, he
would fold it carefully, put it back in its envelope, rub his
thick fingers across the stubble of brown-reddish beard that
covered his bloated and discoloured face, reach with a painful
grunt for the glass jug, drink, and open up another letter.</p>

<p>And from time to time he would put a letter down before he had
finished reading it, take up a pen, and begin to write upon a
sheet of broad hospital stationery, of which there was a pad upon
his desk. And McGuire wrote as he read, slowly, painfully,
carefully, with a fixed and drunken attentiveness, no sound
except the minute and careful scratching of the pen in his fat
hands, and the short, thick stertorous breathing as he bent over
the tablet, his cigarette plastered comically at the edge of one
fat lip.</p>

<p>McGuire would read the letters over and over, slowly,
carefully, and solemnly. Burly, motionless and with no sound save
for the short and stertorous labour of his breath, he stared with
drunken fixity at the pages which he held close before his
yellowed eyes, his bloated face. He had read each letter at least
a dozen times during the course of the long evening. And each
time that he finished reading it, he would fold it carefully with
his thick fingers, put it back into its envelope, bend and reach
down between his fat legs with a painful grunt, fumble for the
liquor jug, and then drink long and deep.</p>

<p>It seemed that a red-hot iron had been driven through his
heart and twisted there; the liquor burned in his blood and
stomach like fire; and each time that he had finished reading
that long letter, he would grunt, reach for the jug again, and
then slowly and painfully begin to scrawl some words down on the
pad before him.</p>

<p>He had done this at least a dozen times that night, and each
time after a few scrawled lines he would grunt impatiently, wad
the paper up into a crumpled ball and throw it into the
waste-paper basket at his side. Now, a little after three o'clock
in the morning, he was writing steadily; there was no sound now
in the room save for the man's thick short breathing and the
minute scratching of his pen across the paper. An examination of
these wadded balls of paper, however, in the order in which they
had been written, would have revealed perfectly the successive
states of feeling in the man's spirit.</p>

<p>The first, which was written after his discovery of the
letters, was just a few scrawled words without punctuation or
grammatical coherence, ending abruptly in an explosive splintered
movement of the pen, and read simply and expressively as
follows:</p>

<p>"You bitch you damned dirty trollop of a lying whore
you--"</p>

<p>And this ended here in an explosive scrawl of splintered ink,
and had been wadded up and thrown away into the basket.</p>

<p> </p>

<h1>XXIII</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Helen had lain awake for hours in darkness, in a strange
comatose state of terror and hallucination. There was no sound
save the sound of Barton's breathing beside her, but in her
strange drugged state she would imagine she heard all kinds of
sounds. As she lay there in the dark, her eyes wide open, wide
awake, plucking at her large cleft chin abstractedly, in a kind
of drugged hypnosis, thinking like a child:</p>

<p>"What is that? . . . Someone is coming! . . . That was a car
that stopped outside. . . . Now they're coming up the steps. . .
. There's someone knocking at the door. . . . Oh, my God! . . .
It's about Papa! . . . He's had another attack, they've come to
get me . . . he's dead! . . . Hugh! Hugh! Wake up!" she said
hoarsely, and seized him by the arm. And he woke, his sparse hair
tousled, grumbling sleepily.</p>

<p>"Hugh! Hugh!" she whispered. "It's Papa--he's dying . . .
they're at the door now! . . . oh, for heaven's sake, get up!"
she almost screamed in a state of frenzied despair and
exasperation. "Aren't you good for anything! . . . Don't lie
there like a dummy--Papa may be dying! Get up! Get up! There's
someone at the door! My God, you can at least go and find out
what it is! Oh, get up, get up, I tell you! . . . Don't leave
everything to me! You're a man--you can at least do that
much!"--and by now her voice was almost sobbing with
exasperation.</p>

<p>"Well, <i>all</i> right, <i>all</i> right!" he grumbled in a
tone of protest, "I'm going! Only give me a moment to find my
slippers and my bath-robe, won't you?"</p>

<p>And, hair still twisted, tall, bony, thin to emaciation, he
felt around with his bare feet until he found his slippers,
stepped gingerly into them, and put on his bath-robe, tying the
cord around his waist, and looking himself over in the mirror
carefully, smoothing down his rumpled hair and making a shrugging
motion of the shoulders. And she looked at him with a tortured
and exasperated glare, saying:</p>

<p>"Oh, slow, slow, slow! . . . My God, you're the slowest thing
that ever lived! . . . I could walk from here to California in
the time it takes you to get out of bed."</p>

<p>"Well, <i>I'm</i> going, <i>I'm</i> going," he said again with
surly protest. "I don't want to go to the front door naked--only
give me a minute to get ready, won't you?"</p>

<p>"Then, go, go, go!" she almost screamed at him. "They've been
there for fifteen minutes. . . . They're almost hammering the
door down--for God's sake go and find out if they've come because
of Papa, I beg of you."</p>

<p>And he went hastily, still preserving a kind of dignity as he
stepped along gingerly in his bath-robe and thin pyjamaed legs.
And when he got to the door, there was no one, nothing there. The
street outside was bare and empty, the houses along the street
dark and hushed with their immense and still attentiveness of
night and silence and the sleepers, the trees were standing
straight and lean with their still young leafage--and he came
back again growling surlily.</p>

<p>"Ah-h, there's no one there! You didn't hear anything! . . .
You imagined the whole thing!"</p>

<p>And for a moment her eyes had a dull appeased look, she
plucked at her large cleft chin and said in an abstracted tone:
"Ah-hah! . . . Well, come on back to bed, honey, and get some
sleep."</p>

<p>"Ah, get some sleep!" he growled, scowling angrily as he took
off his robe--and scuffed the slippers from his feet. "What
chance do I have to get any sleep any more with you acting like a
crazy woman half the time?"</p>

<p>She snickered hoarsely and absently, still plucking at her
chin, as he lay down beside her; she kissed him, and put her arms
around him with a mothering gesture.</p>

<p>"Well, I know, Hugh," she said quietly, "you've had a hard
time of it, but some day we will get away from it and live our
own life. I know you didn't marry the whole damned family--but
just try to put up with it a little longer: Papa has not got long
to live, he's all alone over there in that old house--and she
can't realize--she doesn't understand that he is dying--she'll
never wake up to the fact until he's gone! I lie here at night
thinking about it--and I can't go to sleep . . . I get funny
notions in my head." As she spoke these words the dull strained
look came into her eyes again, and her big-boned generous face
took on the warped outline of hysteria--"You know, I get queer."
She spoke the word in a puzzled and baffled way, the dull
strained look becoming more pronounced--"I think of him over
there all alone in that old house, and then I think they're
coming for me--" she spoke the word "they" in this same baffled
and puzzled tone, as if she did not clearly understand who "they"
were--"I think the telephone is ringing, or that someone is
coming up the steps and then I hear them knocking at the door,
and then I hear them talking to me, telling me to come quick, he
needs me--and then I hear him calling to me, 'Baby! Oh,
baby--come quick, baby, for Jesus' sake!'"</p>

<p>"You've been made the goat," he muttered, "you've got to bear
the whole burden on your shoulders. You're cracking up under the
strain. If they don't leave you alone I'm going to take you away
from here."</p>

<p>"Do you think it's right?" she demanded in a frenzied tone
again, responding thirstily to his argument. "Why, good heavens,
Hugh! I've got a right to my own life the same as anybody else.
Don't you think I have? I married <i>you!"</i> she cried, as if
there were some doubts of the fact. "I wanted a home of my own,
children, my own life--good heavens, we have a right to that just
the same as anyone else! Don't you think we have?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he said grimly, "and I'm going to see we get it. I'm
tired of seeing you made the victim! If they don't give you some
peace or quiet we'll move away from this town."</p>

<p>"Oh, it's not that I mind doing it for Papa," she said more
quietly. "Good heavens, I'll do anything to make that poor old
man happier. If only the rest of them--well, honey," she said,
breaking off abruptly, "let's forget about it! It's too bad
you've got to go through all this now, but it won't last for
ever. After Papa is gone, we'll get away from it. Some day we'll
have a chance to lead our own lives together."</p>

<p>"Oh, it's all right about me, dear," the man said quietly,
speaking the word "dear" in the precise and nasal way Ohio people
have. He was silent for a moment, and when he spoke again, his
lean seamed face and care-worn eyes were quietly eloquent with
the integrity of devotion and loyalty that was of the essence of
his life. "I don't mind it for myself--only I hate to see you get
yourself worked up to this condition. I'm afraid you'll crack
under the strain: that's all I care about."</p>

<p>"Well, forget about it. It can't be helped. Just try to make
the best of it. Now go on back to sleep, honey, and try to get
some rest before you have to get up."</p>

<p>And returning her kiss, with an obedient and submissive look
on his lean face, he said quietly, "Good night, dear," turned
over on his side and closed his eyes.</p>

<p>She turned the light out, and now again there was nothing but
darkness, silence, the huge still hush and secrecy of night, her
husband's quiet breath of sleep as he lay beside her. And again
she could not sleep, but lay there plucking absently at her large
cleft chin, her eyes open, turned upward into darkness in a stare
of patient, puzzled, and abstracted thought.</p>

<h1>XXIV</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>For a long time now, McGuire had sat there without moving,
sprawled out upon the desk in a kind of drunken stupor. About
half-past three the telephone upon the desk began to ring,
jangling the hospital silence with its ominous and insistent
clangour, but the big burly figure of the man did not stir, he
made no move to answer. Presently he heard the brisk heel-taps of
Creasman, the night superintendent, coming along the heavy oiled
linoleum of the corridor. She entered, glanced quickly at him,
and saying, "Shall I take it?" picked up the phone, took the
receiver from its hook, said "hello" and listened for a moment.
He did not move.</p>

<p>In a moment, the night superintendent said quietly:</p>

<p>"Yes, I'll ask him."</p>

<p>When she spoke to him, however, her tone had changed
completely from the cool professional courtesy of her speech into
the telephone: putting the instrument down upon the top of the
desk, and covering the mouth-piece with her hand, she spoke
quietly to him, but with a note of cynical humour in her voice,
bold, coarse, a trifle mocking.</p>

<p>"It's your wife," she said. "What shall I tell her?"</p>

<p>He regarded her stupidly for a moment before he answered.</p>

<p>"What does she want?" he grunted.</p>

<p>She looked at him with hard eyes touched with pity and
regret.</p>

<p>"What do you think a woman wants?" she said. "She wants to
know if you are coming home tonight."</p>

<p>He stared at her and then grunted:</p>

<p>"Won't go home."</p>

<p>She took her hand away from the mouth-piece instantly, and
taking up the phone again, spoke smoothly, quietly, with cool
crisp courtesy:</p>

<p>"The doctor will not be able to go home tonight, Mrs. McGuire.
He has to operate at seven-thirty. . . . Yes. . . . Yes. . . . At
seven-thirty. . . . He has decided it is best to stay here until
the operation is over. . . . Yes. . . . I'll tell him. . . .
Thank <i>you. . . .</i> Good-bye."</p>

<p>She hung up quietly and then turning to him, her hands arched
cleanly on starched hips, she looked at him for a moment with a
bold sardonic humour.</p>

<p>"What did she say?" he mumbled thickly.</p>

<p>"Nothing," she said quietly. "Nothing at all. What else is
there to say?"</p>

<p>He made no answer but just kept staring at her in his bloated
drunken way with nothing but the numb swelter of that
irremediable anguish in his heart. In a moment, her voice
hardening imperceptibly, the nurse spoke quietly again:</p>

<p>"Oh, yes--and I forgot to tell you--you had another call
tonight."</p>

<p>He moistened his thick lips, and mumbled:</p>

<p>"Who was it?"</p>

<p>"It was that woman of yours."</p>

<p>There was no sound save the stertorous labour of his breath;
he stared at her with his veined and yellowed eyes, and grunted
stolidly:</p>

<p>"What did she want?"</p>

<p>"She wanted to know if the doc-taw was theah," Creasman said
in a coarse and throaty parody of refinement. "And is he coming
in tonight? Really, I should like to know. . . . Ooh, yaas,"
Creasman went on throatily, adding a broad stroke or two on her
own account. "I simply must find out! I cawn't get my sleep in
until I do. . . . Well," she demanded harshly, "what am I going
to tell her if she calls again?"</p>

<p>"What did she say to tell me?"</p>

<p>"She said"--the nurse's tone again was lewdly tinged with
parody--"to tell you that she is having guests for dinner
tomorrow night--this evening--and that you simply <i>got</i> to
be th&ouml;h, you, and your wife, too--ooh, Gawd, yes!--the Reids
are comin', don't-cherknow--and if you are not th&ouml;h Gawd
only knows what will happen!"</p>

<p>He glowered at her drunkenly for a moment, and then, waving
thick fingers at her in disgust, he mumbled:</p>

<p>"You got a dirty mouth . . . don't become you. . . .
Unlady-like. . . . Don't like a dirty-talkin' woman. . . . Never
did. . . . Unbecomin'. . . . Unlady-like. . . . Nurses all alike
. . . all dirty talkers . . . don't like 'em."</p>

<p>"Oh, dirty talkers, your granny!" she said coarsely. "Now you
leave the nurses alone. . . . They're decent enough girls, most
of 'em, until they come here and listen to you for a month or
two. . . . You listen to me, Hugh McGuire; don't blame the
nurses. When it comes to dirty talking, you can walk off with the
medals any day in the week. . . . Even if I am your cousin, I had
a good Christian raising out in the country before I came here.
So don't talk to me about nurses' dirty talk: after a few
sessions with you in the operating room even the Virgin Mary
could use language fit to make a monkey blush. So don't blame it
on the nurses. Most of them are white as snow compared to
you."</p>

<p>"You're dirty talkers--all of you," he muttered, waving his
thick fingers in her direction. "Don't like it. . . . Unbecomin'
in a lady."</p>

<p>For a moment she did not answer, but stood looking at him,
arms akimbo on her starched white hips, a glance that was bold,
hard, sardonic, but somehow tinged with a deep and broad
affection.</p>

<p>Then, taking her hands off her hips, she bent swiftly over
him, reached down between his legs, and got the jug and lifting
it up to the light in order to make her cynical inspection of its
depleted contents more accurate, she remarked with ironic
approbation:</p>

<p>"My, my! You're doing pretty well, aren't you? . . . Well, it
won't be long <i>now,</i> will it?" she said cheerfully, and then
turning to him abruptly and accusingly, demanded:</p>

<p>"Do you realize that you were supposed to call Helen Gant at
twelve o'clock?" She glanced swiftly at the clock. "Just three
and a half hours ago. Or did you forget it?"</p>

<p>He passed his thick hand across the reddish unshaved stubble
of his beard.</p>

<p>"Who?" he said stupidly. "Where? What is it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing to worry about," she said with a light hard
humour. "Just a little case of carcinoma of the prostate. He's
going to die anyway, so you've got nothing to worry about at
all."</p>

<p>"Who?" he said stupidly again. "Who is it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, just a man," she said gaily. "An old, old man name Mr.
Gant.--You've been his physician for twenty years, but maybe
you've forgotten him. You know--they come and go; some live and
others die--it's all right,--this one's going to die. They'll
bury him--it'll all come out right one way or the other--so
you've nothing to worry about at all. . . . Even if you kill
him," she said cheerfully. "He's just an old, old man with
cancer, and bound to die anyway, so promise me you won't worry
about it too much, will you?"</p>

<p>She looked at him a moment longer; then, putting her hand
under his fat chin, she jerked his head up sharply. He stared at
her stupidly with his yellowed drunken eyes, and in them she saw
the mute anguish of a tortured animal, and suddenly her heart was
twisted with pity for him.</p>

<p>"Look here," she said, in a hard and quiet voice, "what's
wrong with you?"</p>

<p>In a moment he mumbled thickly:</p>

<p>"Nothing's wrong with me."</p>

<p>"Is it the woman business again? For God's sake, are you never
going to grow up, McGuire? Are you going to remain an overgrown
schoolboy all your life? Are you going to keep on eating your
heart out over a bitch who thinks that spring is here every time
her hind end itches? Are you going to throw your life away, and
let your work go to smash because some damned woman in the change
of life has done you dirt? What kind of man are you, anyway?" she
jeered. "Jesus God! If it's a woman that you want the woods are
full of 'em. Besides," she added, "what's wrong with your own
wife! She's worth a million of those flossy sluts."</p>

<p>He made no answer and in a moment she went on in a harsh and
jeering tone that was almost deliberately coarse:</p>

<p>"Haven't you learned yet, with all you've seen of it, that a
piece of tail is just a piece of tail, and that in the dark it
doesn't matter one good God-damn whether it's brown, black,
white, or yellow?"</p>

<p>Even as she spoke, something cold and surgical in his mind,
which no amount of alcohol seemed to dull or blur, was saying
accurately: "Why do they all feel such contempt for one another?
What is it in them that makes them despise themselves?"</p>

<p>Aloud, however, waving his thick fingers at her in a gesture
of fat disgust, he said:</p>

<p>"Creasman, you got a dirty tongue. . . . Don't like to hear a
woman talk like that. . . . Never liked to hear a dirty-talkin'
woman. . . . You're no lady!"</p>

<p>"Ah-h! No lady!" she said bitterly, and let her hands fall in
a gesture of defeat. "All right, you poor fool, if that's the way
you feel about it, go ahead and drink yourself to death over your
'lady.' That's what's wrong with you."</p>

<p>And, muttering angrily, she left him. He sat there stupidly,
without moving, until her firm heel-taps had receded down the
silent hall, and he heard a door close. Then he reached down
between his knees and got the jug and drank again. And again
there was nothing in the place except the sound of silence, the
rapid ticking of a little clock, the thick short breathing of the
man.</p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h1>XXV</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Somewhere, far away, across the cool sweet silence of the
night, Helen heard the sound of a train. For a moment she could
hear the faint and ghostly tolling of its bell, the short
explosive blasts of its hard labour, now muted almost into
silence, now growing near, immediate as it laboured out across
the night from the enclosure of a railway cut down by the river's
edge; and for an instant she heard the lonely wailing and
receding cry of the train's whistle, and then the long heavy
rumble of its wheels; and then nothing but silence, darkness, the
huge hush and secrecy of night again.</p>

<p>And still plucking at her chin, thinking absently, but
scarcely conscious of her thinking, like a child in reverie, she
thought:</p>

<p>"There is a freight-train going west along the river. Now, by
the sound, it should be passing below Patton Hill, just across
from where Riverside Park used to be before the flood came and
washed it all away. . . . Now it is getting farther off, across
the river from the casket factory. . . . Now it is almost gone, I
can hear nothing but the sound of wheels . . . it is going west
toward Boiling Springs . . . and after that it will come to
Wilson City, Tennessee . . . and then to Dover. . . . Knoxville .
. . Memphis--after that? I wonder where the train is going . . .
where it will be tomorrow night? . . . Perhaps across the
Mississippi River, and then on through Arkansas . . . perhaps to
St. Louis . . . and then on to--what comes next?" she thought
absently, plucking at her chin--"to Kansas City, I suppose . . .
and then to Denver . . . and across the Rocky Mountains . . . and
across the desert . . . and then across more mountains and then
at last to California."</p>

<p>And still plucking at her chin, and scarcely conscious of her
thought--not <i>thinking,</i> indeed, so much as reflecting by a
series of broken but powerful images all cogent to a central
intuition about life--her mind resumed again its sleepless
patient speculation:</p>

<p>"How strange and full of mystery life is. . . . Tomorrow we
shall all get up, dress, go out on the streets, see and speak to
one another--and yet we shall know absolutely nothing about
anyone else. . . . I know almost everyone in town--the bankers,
the lawyers, the butchers, the bakers, the grocers, the clerks in
the stores, the Greek restaurant man, Tony Scarsati the fruit
dealer, even the niggers down in Niggertown--I know them all, as
well as their wives and children--where they came from, what they
are doing, all the lies and scandals and jokes and mean stories,
whether true or false, that are told about them--and yet I really
know nothing about any of them. I know nothing about anyone, not
even about myself--" and, suddenly, this fact seemed terrible and
grotesque to her, and she thought desperately:</p>

<p>"What is wrong with people? . . . Why do we never get to know
one another? . . . Why is it that we get born and live and die
here in this world without ever finding out what anyone else is
like? . . . No, what is the strangest thing of all--why is it
that all our efforts to know people in this world lead only to
greater ignorance and confusion than before? We get together and
talk, and say we think and feel and believe in such a way, and
yet what we really think and feel and believe we never say at
all. Why is this? We talk and talk in an effort to understand
another person, and yet almost all we say is false: we hardly
ever say what we mean or tell the truth--it all leads to greater
misunderstanding and fear than before--it would be better if we
said nothing. Tomorrow I shall dress and go out on the street and
bow and smile and flatter people, laying it on with a trowel,
because I want them to like me, I want to make 'a good
impression,' to be a 'success'--and yet I have no notion what it
is all about. When I pass Judge Junius Pearson on the street I
will smile and bow and try to make a good impression on him, and
if he speaks to me I shall almost fawn upon him in order to
flatter my way into his good graces. Why? I do not like him, I
hate his long pointed nose, and the sneering and disdainful look
upon his face: I think he is 'looking down' on me--but I know
that he goes with the 'swell' social set and is invited out to
all the parties at Catawba House by Mrs. Goulderbilt and is
received by them as a social equal. And I feel that if Junius
Pearson should accept me as <i>his</i> social equal it would help
me--get me forward somehow--make me a success--get <i>me</i> an
invitation to Catawba House. And yet it would get me nothing;
even if I were Mrs. Goulderbilt's closest friend, what good would
it do me? But the people I really like and feel at home with are
working people of Papa's kind. The people I really like are Ollie
Gant, and old man Alec Ramsay, and big Mike Fogarty, and Mr.
Jannadeau, and Myrtis, my little nigger servant girl, and Mr.
Luther, the fish man down in the market, and the nigger Jacken,
the fruit and vegetable man, and Ernest Pegram, and Mr. Duncan
and the Tarkintons--all the old neighbours down on Woodson
Street--and Tony Scarsati and Mr. Pappas. Mr. Pappas is just a
Greek luncheon-room proprietor, but he seems to me to be one of
the finest people I have ever known, and yet if Junius Pearson
saw me talking to him I should try to make a joke out of it--to
make a joke out of talking to a Greek who runs a restaurant. In
the same way, when some of my new friends see me talking to
people like Mr. Jannadeau or Mike Fogarty or Ollie or Ernest
Pegram or the Tarkintons or the old Woodson Street crowd, I feel
ashamed or embarrassed, and turn it off as a big joke. I laugh
about Mr. Jannadeau and his dirty fingers and the way he picks
his nose, and old Alec Ramsay and Ernest Pegram spitting tobacco
while they talk, and then I wind up by appearing to be democratic
and saying in a frank and open manner--'Well, I like them . . . I
don't care what anyone says' (when no one has said anything!), 'I
like them, and always have. If the truth is told, they're just as
good as anyone else!'--as if there is any doubt about it, and as
if I should have to justify myself for being 'democratic.' Why
'democratic'? Why should I apologize or defend myself for liking
people when no one has accused me?</p>

<p>"I'm pushing Hugh ahead now all the time; he's tired and sick
and worn out and exhausted--but I keep 'pushing him ahead'
without knowing what it is we're pushing ahead toward, where it
will all wind up. What is it all about? I've pushed him ahead
from Woodson Street up here to Weaver Street: and now this
neighbourhood has become old-fashioned--the swell society crowd
is all moving out to Grovemont--opposite the golf-course; and now
I'm pushing him to move out there, build upon the lot we own or
buy a house. I've 'pushed' him and myself until now he belongs to
the Rotary Club and I belong to the Thursday Literary Club, the
Orpheus Society, the Saturday Musical Guild, the Woman's Club,
the Discussion Group, and God knows what else--all these silly
and foolish little clubs in which we have no interest--and yet it
would kill us if we did not belong to them, we feel that they are
a sign that we are 'getting ahead.' Getting ahead to what?</p>

<p>"And it is the same with all of us: pretend, pretend,
pretend--show-off, show-off, show-off--try to keep up with the
neighbours and to go ahead of them--and never a word of truth;
never a word of what we really feel, and understand and know. The
one who shouts the loudest goes the farthest:--Mrs. Richard Jeter
Ebbs sits up on top of the whole heap, she goes everywhere and
makes speeches; people say 'Mrs. Richard Jeter Ebbs said
so-and-so'--and all because she shouts out everywhere that she is
a lady and a member of an old family and the widow of Richard
Jeter Ebbs. And no one in town ever met Richard Jeter Ebbs, they
don't know who he was, what he did, where he came from; neither
do they know who Mrs. Richard Jeter Ebbs was, or where she came
from, or who or what her family was.</p>

<p>"Why are we all so false, cowardly, cruel, and disloyal toward
one another and toward ourselves? Why do we spend our days in
doing useless things, in false pretence and triviality? Why do we
waste our lives--exhaust our energy--throw everything good away
on falseness and lies and emptiness? Why do we deliberately
destroy ourselves this way, when we want joy and love and beauty
and it is all around us in the world if we would only take it?
Why are we so afraid and ashamed when there is really nothing to
be afraid and ashamed of? Why have we wasted everything, thrown
our loves away, what is this horrible thing in life that makes us
throw ourselves away--to hunt out death when what we want is
life? Why is it that we are always strangers in this world, and
never come to know one another, and are full of fear and shame
and hate and falseness, when what we want is love? Why is it?
Why? Why? Why?"</p>

<p>And with that numb horror of disbelief and silence and the
dark about her, in her, filling her, it seemed to her suddenly
that there was some monstrous and malevolent force in life that
held all mankind in its spell and that compelled men to destroy
themselves against their will. It seemed to her that everything
in life--the things men did and said, the way they acted--was
grotesque, perverse, and accidental, that there was no reason for
anything.</p>

<p>A thousand scenes from her whole life, seen now with the
terrible detachment of a spectator, and dark and sombre with the
light of time, swarmed through her mind: she saw herself as a
child of ten, hanging on grimly to her father, a thin fury of a
little girl, during his sprees of howling drunkenness--slapping
him in the face to make him obey her, feeding him hot soup,
undressing him, sending for McGuire, "sobering him up" and
forcing him to obey her when no one else could come near him. And
she saw herself later, a kind of slavey at her mother's
boarding-house in St. Louis during the World's Fair, drudging
from morn to night, a grain of human dust, an atom thrust by
chance into the great roar of a distant city, or on an expedition
as blind, capricious, and fatally mistaken as all life. Later,
she saw herself as a girl in high school, she remembered her
dreams and hopes, the pitiably mistaken innocence of her vision
of the world; her grand ambitions to "study music," to follow a
"career in grand opera"; later still, a girl of eighteen or
twenty, amorous of life, thirsting for the great cities and
voyages of the world, playing popular songs of the period--"Love
Me and the World Is Mine," "I Wonder Who's Kissing Her Now,"
"Till the Sands of the Desert Grow Cold," and so on--for her
father, as he sat, on summer evenings, on his porch; a little
later, "touring" the little cities of the South, singing and
playing the popular "rhythm" and sentimental ballads of the
period in vaudeville and moving-picture houses. She remembered
how she had once been invited to a week-end house party with a
dozen other young men and women of her acquaintance, and of how
she had been afraid to go, and how desperately ashamed she was
when she had "to go in swimming" with the others, and to "show
her figure," her long skinny legs, even when they were concealed
by the clumsy bathing dress and the black stockings of the
period. She remembered her marriage then, the first years of her
life with Barton, her tragic failure to have children, and the
long horror of Gant's last years of sickness--the years of sombre
waiting, the ever-impending terror of his death.</p>

<p>A thousand scenes from this past life flashed through her mind
now, as she lay there in the darkness, and all of them seemed
grotesque, accidental and mistaken, as reasonless as everything
in life.</p>

<p>And filled with a numb, speechless feeling of despair and
nameless terror, she heard, somewhere across the night, the sound
of a train again, and thought:</p>

<p>"My God! My God! What is life about? We are all lying here in
darkness in ten thousand little towns--waiting, listening,
hoping--for what?"</p>

<p>And suddenly, with a feeling of terrible revelation, she saw
the strangeness and mystery of man's life; she felt about her in
the darkness the presence of ten thousand people, each lying in
his bed, naked and alone, united at the heart of night and
darkness, and listening, as she, to the sounds of silence and of
sleep. And suddenly it seemed to her that she knew all these
lonely, strange, and unknown watchers of the night, that she was
speaking to them, and they to her, across the fields of sleep, as
they had never spoken before, that she knew men now in all their
dark and naked loneliness, without falseness and pretence as she
had never known them. And it seemed to her that if men would only
listen in the darkness, and send the language of their naked
lonely spirits across the silence of the night, all of the error,
falseness and confusion of their lives would vanish; they would
no longer be strangers, and each would find the life he sought
and never yet had found.</p>

<p>"If we only could!" she thought. "If we only could!"</p>

<p>Then, as she listened, there was nothing but the huge hush of
night and silence, and far away the whistle of a train. Suddenly
the phone rang.</p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h1>XXVI</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>A few minutes after four o'clock that morning as McGuire lay
there sprawled upon his desk, the phone rang again. And again he
made no move to answer it: he just sat there, sprawled out on his
fat elbows, staring stupidly ahead. Creasman came in presently,
as the telephone continued to disturb the silence of the hospital
with its electric menace, and this time, without a glance at him,
answered.</p>

<p>It was Luke Gant. At four o'clock his father had had another
h&aelig;morrhage, he had lost consciousness, all efforts to
awaken him had failed, they thought he was dying.</p>

<p>The nurse listened carefully for a moment to Luke's stammering
and excited voice, which was audible across the wire even to
McGuire. Then, with a troubled and uncertain glance toward the
doctor's sprawled and drunken figure, she said quietly:</p>

<p>"Just a minute. I don't know if the doctor is in the hospital.
I'll see if I can find him."</p>

<p>Putting her hand over the mouth-piece, keeping her voice low,
she spoke urgently to McGuire:</p>

<p>"It's Luke Gant. He says his father has had another
h&aelig;morrhage and that they can't rouse him. He wants you to
come at once. What shall I tell him?"</p>

<p>He stared drunkenly at her for a moment, and then, waving his
finger at her in a movement of fat impatience, he mumbled
thickly:</p>

<p>"Nothing to do. . . . No use . . . . Can't be stopped. . . .
People expect miracles. . . . Over. . . . Done for. . . . Tell
him I'm not here . . . gone home," he muttered, and sprawled
forward on the desk again.</p>

<p>Quietly, coolly, the nurse spoke into the phone again:</p>

<p>"The doctor doesn't seem to be here at the hospital, Mr. Gant.
Have you tried his house? I think you may find him at home."</p>

<p>"No, G-g-g-god-damn it!" Luke fairly screamed across the wire.
"He's not at home. I've already t-t-tried to get him here. . . .
N-n-n-now you look here, Miss Creasman!" Luke shouted angrily.
"You c-c-can't kid me: I know where he is--He's d-d-down there at
the hospital right now--wy-wy-wy--stinkin' drunk! You t-t-tell
him, G-g-g-god-damn his soul, that if he d-d-doesn't come,
wy-wy-wy--P-p-p-papa's in a bad way and and and f-f-frankly, I
fink it's a rotten shame for McGuire to act this way, wy-wy-wy
after he's b-b-been Papa's doctor all these years. F-f-frankly, I
do!"</p>

<p>"Nothing to be done," mumbled McGuire. "No use. . . . All
over."</p>

<p>"I'll see what I can do, Mr. Gant," said Creasman quietly.
"I'll let the doctor know as soon as he comes in!"</p>

<p>"C-c-c-comes in, hell!" Luke stammered bitterly. "I'm
c-c-comin' down there myself and g-g-get him if I have to
wy-wy-wy d-d-drag him here by the s-s-scruff of his neck!" And he
hung up the receiver with a bang.</p>

<p>The nurse put the phone down on the desk, and turning to
McGuire, said:</p>

<p>"He's raving. He says if you don't go, he'll come for you and
get you himself. Can't you pull yourself together enough to go?
If you can't drive the car, I'll send Joe along to drive it for
you." (Joe was a negro orderly in the hospital.)</p>

<p>"What's the use?" McGuire mumbled thickly, a little angrily.
"What the hell do these people expect, anyway? . . . I'm a
doctor, not a miracle man. . . . The man's gone, I tell you . . .
the whole gut and rectum is eaten away . . . he can't live over a
day or two longer at the most. . . . It's cruelty to prolong it:
why the hell should I try to?"</p>

<p>"All right," she said resignedly. "Do as you please. Only,
he'll probably be here for you himself in a few minutes. And
since they do feel that way about it, I think you might make the
effort just to please them."</p>

<p>"Ah-h," he muttered wearily. "People are all alike. . . . They
all want miracles."</p>

<p>"Are you just going to sit here all night?" she said with a
rough kindliness. "Aren't you going to try to get a little sleep
before you operate?"</p>

<p>He waved fat fingers at her, and did not look at her.</p>

<p>"Leave me alone," he mumbled; and she left him.</p>

<p>When she had gone, he fumbled for the jug and drank again. And
then, while time resumed its sanded drip, and he sat there in the
silence, he thought again of the old dying man whom he had known
first when he was a young doctor just beginning and with whom his
own life had been united by so many strange and poignant
memories. And thinking of Gant, the strangeness of the human
destiny returned to haunt his mind; there was something that he
could not speak, a wonder and a mystery he could not express.</p>

<p>He fumbled for the jug again, and holding it solemnly in his
bearish paws, drained it. Then he sat for several minutes without
moving. Finally, he got up out of his chair, grunting painfully,
and fumbling for the walls, lurched out into the hall, and began
to grope his way across the corridor toward the stairs. And the
first step fooled him as it had done so many times before; he
missed his step, even as a man stepping out in emptiness might
miss, and came down heavily upon his knees. Then, pushing with
his hands, he slid out peacefully on the oiled green linoleum,
pillowed his big head on his arms with a comfortable grunt, and
sprawled out flat, already half dead to the world. It was in this
position--also a familiar one--that Creasman, who had heard his
thump when falling, found him. And she spoke sharply and
commandingly as one might speak to a little child.</p>

<p>"You get right up off that floor and march upstairs," she
said. "If you want to sleep you're going to your room; you'll not
disgrace us sleeping on that floor."</p>

<p>And like a child, as he had done so many times before, he
obeyed her. In a moment, as her sharp command reached his drugged
consciousness, he grunted, stirred, climbed painfully to his
knees, and then, pawing carefully before him like a bear, unable
or unwilling to stand up, he began to crawl slowly up the
stairs.</p>

<p>And it was in this position, half-way up, pawing his burly and
cumbersome way on hands and knees, that Luke Gant found him.
Cursing bitterly, and stammering with wild excitement, the young
man pulled him to his feet, Creasman sponged off the great
bloated face with a cold towel and, assisted by Joe Corpering,
the negro man, they got him down the stairs and out of the
hospital into Luke's car.</p>

<p>Dawn was just breaking, a faint glimmer of blue-silver light,
with the still purity of the earth, the sweet fresh stillness of
the trees, the bird-song waking. The fresh sweet air, Luke's
breakneck driving through the silent streets, the roaring
motor--finally, the familiar and powerfully subdued emotion of a
death chamber, the repressed hysteria, the pain and tension and
the terror of shocked flesh, the aura of focal excitement around
the dying man revived McGuire.</p>

<p>Gant lay still and almost lifeless on the bed, his face
already tinged with the ghostly shade of death, his breath low,
hoarse, faintly rattling, his eyes half-closed, comatose, already
glazed with death.</p>

<p>McGuire sighted at his shining needle, and thrust a powerful
injection of caffeine, sodium, and benzoate into the arm of the
dying man. This served partially to revive him, got him through
the low ebb of the dark, his eyes opened, cleared, he spoke
again. Bright day and morning came, and Gant still lived. And
with the light, their impossible and frenzied hopes came back
again, as they have always been revived in desperate men. And
Gant did not die that day. He lived on.</p>

<p> </p>

<h1>XXVII</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>By the middle of the month Gant had a desperate attack; for
four days now he was confined to bed, he began to bleed out of
the bowels, he spent four sleepless days and nights of agony, and
with the old terror of death awake again and urgent, Helen
telegraphed to Luke, who was in Atlanta, frantically imploring
him to come home at once.</p>

<p>With the arrival of his son and under the stimulation of
Luke's vital and hopeful nature, the old man revived somewhat:
they got him out of bed and into a new wheel-chair which they had
bought for the purpose, and the day of his arrival Luke wheeled
his father out into the bright June sunshine and through the
streets of the town, where he again saw friends, and renewed
acquaintances he had not known in years.</p>

<p>The next day Gant seemed better. He ate a good breakfast, by
ten o'clock he was up and Luke had dressed him, got him into the
new wheelchair and was wheeling him out on the streets again in
the bright sunshine. All along the streets of the town people
stopped and greeted the old man and his son, and in Gant's weary
old brain there may perhaps have been a flicker of an old hope, a
feeling that he had come to life again.</p>

<p>"Wy-wy-wy-wy, he's f-f-f-fine as silk!" Luke would sing out in
answer to the question of some old friend or acquaintance, before
his father had a chance to answer. "Aren't you, C-C-C-Colonel?
Wy-wy-wy-wy Lord God! Mr. P-p-p-p-parker, you couldn't k-k-k-kill
him with a wy-wy-wy-wy-wy with a b-b-butcher's cleaver. He'll be
here when you and I bofe are p-p-p-pushing daisies." And Gant,
pleased, would smile feebly, puffing from time to time at a cigar
in the unaccustomed, clumsy, and pitifully hopeful way sick men
have.</p>

<p>Towards one o'clock Gant began to moan with pain again and to
entreat his son to make haste and take him home. When they got
back before the house, Luke brought the wheel chair to a stop and
helped his father to get up. His stammering solicitude and
over-extravagant offers of help served only to exasperate and
annoy the old man who, still moaning feebly, and sniffling with
trembling lip, said petulantly:</p>

<p>"No, no, no. Just leave me alone to try to get a moment's
peace, I beg of you, I ask you, for Jesus' sake."</p>

<p>"Wy-wy-wy-wy, all right, P-p-p-papa," Luke stammered with
earnest cheerfulness. "Wy-wy-wy, you're the d-d-d-doctor. Wy-wy,
I'll just wheel the chair up on the porch and then I'll c-c-come
back to your room and f-f-f-fix you up in a j-j-j-j-jiffy."</p>

<p>"Oh, Jesus, I don't care what you do. . . . Do what you like,"
Gant moaned. "I'm in agony. . . . O Jesus!" he wept. "It's
fearful, it's awful, it's cruel--just leave me alone, I beg of
you," he sniffled.</p>

<p>"Wy-wy-wy, yes, sir, P-p-p-papa--wy, you're the doctor," Luke
said. "Can you make it by yourself all right?" he said anxiously,
as his father, leaning heavily upon his cane, started up the
stone steps toward the walk that led up to the house.</p>

<p>"Why, yes, now, son," Eliza, who had heard their voices and
come out on the porch, now said diplomatically, seeing that
Luke's well-meant but stammering solicitude had begun to irritate
his father. "Mr. Gant doesn't want any help--you put the car up,
son, and leave him alone, he's able to manage all right by
himself."</p>

<p>And Luke, muttering respectfully, "Wy-wy-wy, yes, sir,
P-p-p-papa, you're the d-d-doctor," stopped then, lifted the
chair up to the walk, and began to push it toward the house, not,
however, without a troubled glance at the old man who was walking
slowly and feebly toward the porch steps. And for a moment, Eliza
stood surveying them and then turned, to stand looking at her
house reflectively before she entered it again, her hands clasped
loosely at her waist, her lips pursed in a strong reflective
expression in which the whole pride of possession, her living and
inseparable unity with this gaunt old house, was powerfully
evident.</p>

<p>It was at this moment, while she stood planted there upon the
sidewalk looking at the house, that the thing happened. Gant,
still moaning feebly to himself, had almost reached the bottom of
the steps when suddenly he staggered, a scream of pain and horror
was torn from him; in that instant, the walking cane fell with a
clatter to the concrete walk, his two great hands went down to
his groin in a pitiable clutching gesture and crying out loudly:
"O Jesus! Save me! Save me!" he fell to his knees, still
clutching at his entrails with his mighty hands.</p>

<p>Even before Eliza got to him her flesh turned goosey at the
sight. Blood was pouring from him; the bright arterial blood was
already running out upon the concrete walk, the heavy black cloth
of Gant's trousers was already sodden, turning purplish with the
blood; the blood streamed through his fingers, covering his great
hands. He was bleeding to death through the genital organs.</p>

<p>Eliza rushed toward him at a strong clumsy gait; she tried to
lift him; he was too big for her to handle, and she screamed to
Luke for help. He came at once, running at top speed across the
yard and, scarcely pausing in his stride, he picked up Gant's
great figure in his arms--it felt as light and fleshless as a
bundle of dry sticks--and turning to his mother, said curtly:</p>

<p>"Call Helen! Quick! I'll take him to his room and get his
clothes off."</p>

<p>And holding the old man as if he were a child, he fairly raced
up the steps and down the hall, leaving a trail of blood behind
him as he went.</p>

<p>Eliza, scarcely conscious of what she did, paused just long
enough to pick up Gant's black felt hat and walking-stick which
had fallen to the walk. Then, her face white and set as a block
of marble, she rushed up the steps and down the hall toward the
telephone. Now that the end had come, after all the years of
agony and waiting, the knowledge filled her with an unbelievable,
an incredulous horror. In another moment she was talking to her
daughter.</p>

<p>"Oh, child, child," she said in a low tone of utter terror,
"come quick! . . . You father's bleeding to death!"</p>

<p>There was a gasp, a sob of anguish and surprise, half broken
in the throat, the receiver was banged on the hook without an
answer: within four minutes Helen had arrived, Barton, usually a
deliberate and cautious driver, having taken the dangerous hills
and curves between at murderous speed.</p>

<p>As she entered the hall, her mother had just finished phoning
to McGuire. Without a word of greeting the two women rushed back
through the rear hall towards Gant's room; when they got there
Luke had already finished undressing him. Gant lay half propped
on pillows, still holding his great hands clutched around his
genitals, the sheet beneath him was already soaked with blood, a
red wet blot that spread horribly, sickeningly even as they
looked. Gant's cold-grey eyes were bright with terror. As his
daughter entered the room, he looked at her with the pitiable
entreaty of a child, a look that tore at her heart, that begged
her--the only one on earth who could, the only one who through
black years of horror actually had--by some miracle of strength
and grace to save him. And even as he looked at her with pitiable
entreaty, she saw that he was gone, that he was dying, and that
he knew it. Cold terror drank her heart; without a word she
seized a towel, pulled his great hands away from that fount of
jetting blood and covered him. By the time McGuire arrived they
had got a fresh sheet under him; but the spreading horror of the
great red blot could not be checked, the sheet was soaking in
bright blood the moment that they got it down.</p>

<p>McGuire came in and took one look, then turned toward the
window, fumbling in his pocket for a cigarette. Helen came to him
and seized him by his burly arms, unconsciously shaking him in
the desperation of her entreaty.</p>

<p>"You've got to make it stop," she said hoarsely. "You've got
to! You've got to!"</p>

<p>He stared at her for a moment, then stuck the cigarette in the
corner of his thick lip, and barked coarsely:</p>

<p>"Stop what? What the hell do you think I am--Jehovah?"</p>

<p>"You've got to! You've got to!" she muttered again, her large
gaunt face strained with hysteria--and then, suddenly, abruptly,
quietly:</p>

<p>"What's to be done?"</p>

<p>He did not answer for a moment: he stared out of the window,
his coarse, bloated and brutally good face patched and mottled in
late western light.</p>

<p>"You'd better wire the others," he grunted. "That is, if you
want them here. Tell Steve and Daisy to come on. They may make
it. Where's Eugene?"</p>

<p>"Boston."</p>

<p>He shrugged his burly shoulders and said nothing for a
moment.</p>

<p>"All right. Tell him to come on."</p>

<p>"How long?" she whispered.</p>

<p>Again he shrugged his burly shoulders, but made no answer. He
lit his cigarette, and turned toward the bed: nothing could be
heard except Luke's heavy and excited breathing. Both towel and
sheet were red and wet again. Gant remained motionless, his great
hands clasped upon the towel, his eyes bright with terror and
pitiable entreaty. McGuire opened his old leather case, squinted
at the needle, and loaded it. Then, the cigarette still plastered
on his fat lip, coiling smoke, he walked over to the bed and even
as Gant raised his fear-bright eyes to him, he took him by his
stringy arm, and grunting "All right, W. O.," he plunged the
needle in above the elbow. Gant moaned a little, and relaxed
insensibly after the needle had gone in: in a few minutes his
eyes grew dull, and his great hands loosened in their clutch.</p>

<p> </p>

<h1>XXVIII</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>He bled incredibly. It was unbelievable that an old
cancer-riddled spectre of a man should have so much blood in him.
One has often heard the phrase "bled white," and that is
literally what happened to him. Some liquid still came from him,
but it was almost colourless, like water. There was no more blood
left in him. And even then he did not die. Instead, as if to
compensate him for all these years of agony and mortal terror,
this bitter clutch on life so desperately relinquished, there
came now a period of almost total peace and clarity. And Helen,
grasping hope fiercely from that unaccustomed tranquillity, tried
to hearten him and herself with futile words; she even seized him
by his shoulders and shook him a little, saying:</p>

<p>"Why, you're all right! You're going to be all right now! The
worst is over--you'll get well now! Don't you know it?"</p>

<p>And Gant covered her fingers with his own great hand and,
smiling a little and shaking his head, looked at her, saying in a
low and gentle voice:</p>

<p>"Oh, no, baby. I'm dying. It's all right now."</p>

<p>And in her heart she knew at last that she was beaten; yet she
would not give up. The final stop of that horrible flow of blood
which had continued unabated for a day, the unaccustomed tranquil
clarity of Gant's voice and mind, awakened in her again all the
old unreasoning hopefulness of her nature, its desperate refusal
to accept the ultimate.</p>

<p>"Oh," she said that night to Eliza, shaking her head with a
strong movement of negation--"you can't tell me! Papa's not going
to die yet! He'll pull through this just like he's pulled through
all those other spells. Why, his mind is as clear and sound as a
bell! He knows everything that's going on around him! He hasn't
talked in years as he talked to me tonight--he was more like his
old self than he's been since he took sick."</p>

<p>"Why, yes," Eliza answered instantly, eagerly catching up the
drift of her daughter's talk, and pursuing it with the web-like,
invincibly optimistic hopefulness of her own nature.</p>

<p>"Why, yes," she went on, pursing her lips reflectively and
speaking in a persuasive manner. "And, see here, now!--Say!--Why,
you know, I got to studyin' it over tonight and it's just
occurred to me--now I'll tell you what <i>my</i> theory is! I
believe that that old growth--that awful old thing--that--well, I
suppose, now, you might say--that <i>cancer,"</i> she said,
making a gesture of explanation with her broad hand--"whatever it
is, that awful old thing that has been eating away inside him
there for years--" here she pursed her lips powerfully and shook
her head in a short convulsive tremor of disgust--"well, now, I
give it as my theory that the whole thing tore loose in him
yesterday--when he had that attack--and," she paused
deliberately, looked her daughter straight in the eyes, and went
on with a slow and telling force--"and that he has simply gone
and got that rotten old thing out of his system."</p>

<p>"Then, you mean--" Helen began eagerly, seizing at this
fantastic straw as if it were the rock by which her drowning hope
might be saved--"you mean, Mama--"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir!" said Eliza, shaking her head slowly and
positively. "That's exactly what I mean! I think nature has taken
its own course--I think nature has succeeded in doing what all
the doctors and hospitals in the world were not able to do--for
you can rest assured"--and here she paused, looking her daughter
gravely in the eyes--"you can rest assured that nature is the
best physician in the end! Now, I've always said as much, and all
the best authorities agree with me. Why, yes,
now!--here!--say!--wasn't I readin' in the paper--oh! here along,
you know a week or so ago--Doctor Royal S. Copeland!--yes,
sir!--that was the very feller--why, he said, you know--" she
went on in explanatory fashion.</p>

<p>"Oh, but, Mama!" Helen said, desperately, unable to make her
mind believe this grotesque reasoning, and yet clutching at every
word with a pleading entreaty that begged to be convinced.</p>

<p>"Oh, but, Mama, surely Wade Eliot and all those other men at
Hopkins couldn't have been wrong! Why, Mama," she cried
furiously, yet pleadingly--"you know they couldn't--after all
these years--after taking him there for treatment a dozen times
or more! Why, Mama, those men are <i>famous</i>--the greatest
doctors in the world! Oh, surely not! Surely not!" she said
desperately, and then gazed at Eliza pleadingly again.</p>

<p>"H'm!" said Eliza, pursing her lips with a little scornful
smile. "It won't be the first time that a doctor has been
wrong--I don't care how famous they may be! You can rest assured
of that! It's always been my opinion that they're wrong about as
often as they're right--only you can't prove it on 'em. They
<i>bury</i> their mistakes." She was silent a moment, looking at
her daughter in a sudden, straight and deadly fashion, with a
little smile at the corners of her mouth. "Now, child, I want to
tell you something. . . . I want to tell you what I saw today."
Again she was silent, looking straight in her daughter's eyes,
smiling her quiet little smile.</p>

<p>"What? What was it, Mama?" Helen demanded eagerly.</p>

<p>"Did you ever take a good look at that maple tree out front
that stands on your right as you come in the house?"</p>

<p>"Why, no," Helen said in a bewildered tone. "How do you
mean?"</p>

<p>"Well," said Eliza calmly, yet with a certain triumph in her
voice, "you just take a good look at it tomorrow. That's
all."</p>

<p>"But why--I can't see--how do you mean, Mama?"</p>

<p>"Now, child--" Eliza pursued her subject deliberately, with a
ruminant relish of her strong pursed lips--"I was born and
brought up in the country--close to the lap of Mother Earth, as
the sayin' goes--and when it comes to <i>trees</i>--why, I reckon
there's mightly little about 'em that I don't know. . . . Now
here," she said abruptly, coming to the centre of her
argument--"did you ever see a tree that had a big hollow gash
down one side--that looked like it had all been eaten an' rotted
out by some disease that had been destroyin' it?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes," Helen said, in a puzzled voice. "But I don't see
yet--"</p>

<p>"Well, child, I'll tell you, then," said Eliza, both voice and
worn brown eyes united in their portents of a grave and quiet
earnestness--"that tree doesn't <i>always</i> die! You'll see
trees that have had that happen to them--and they <i>cure</i>
themselves! You can see where some old rotten growth has eaten
into them--and then you can see where the tree has got the best
of it--and grown up again--as sound and healthy as it <i>ever</i>
was--around that old rotten growth. And that," she said
triumphantly, "that is just exactly what has happened to that
maple in the yard. Oh, you can <i>see</i> it!" she cried
positively, at the same time making an easy descriptive gesture
with her wide hand--"you can see where it has lapped right around
that old growth--made a sort of fold, you know--and here it is
just as sound and healthy as it ever was!"</p>

<p>"Then you mean?--"</p>

<p>"I mean," said Eliza in her straight and deadly fashion--"I
mean that if a tree can do it, a <i>man</i> can do it--and I mean
that if any man alive could do it your daddy is that man--for
he's had as much strength and vitality as any man I ever saw--and
<i>more</i> than a tree!" she cried. "Lord! I've seen him do
enough to kill a <i>hundred</i> trees--the things <i>he's</i>
done and managed to get over would kill the strongest tree that
ever lived!"</p>

<p>"Oh, but Mama, surely not!" said Helen, laughing, and
beginning to pluck at her chin in an abstracted manner, amused
and tickled in spite of herself by her mother's extraordinary
reasoning. "You know that a man is not built the same way as a
tree!"</p>

<p>"Why," Eliza cried impatiently, "why not? They're both
Nature's products, aren't they? Now, here," she said
persuasively, "just stop and consider the thing for a moment.
Just imagine for a moment that <i>you're</i> the tree." Here she
took her strong worn fingers and traced a line down Helen's
stomach. "Now," she went on persuasively, "you've got some kind
of growth inside you--call it what you like--a tumour, a growth,
a cancer--anything you will--and your <i>healthy</i> tissues get
to work to get the <i>best</i> of that growth--to build up a wall
around it--to destroy it--to replace it with sound tissues, weed
it out! Now," she said, clenching her fingers in a loose but
powerful clasp--"if a <i>tree</i> can do that, doesn't it stand
to reason that a <i>man</i> can do the same? Why, I wouldn't
doubt it for a moment!" she cried powerfully. "Not a bit of
it."</p>

<p>Thus the two women talked together according to the laws of
their nature--the one with an invincible and undaunted optimism
that persauded itself in the octopal pursuit of its own
reasonings, the other clutching like a drowning person at a
straw.</p>

<p> </p>

<h1>XXIX</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>He had not heard from any of his family for some weeks, but
late that night, while he was reading in his room on Trowbridge
Street, he received the following telegram from home: "Father
very ill doctor says cannot live come at once." The telegram was
signed by his mother.</p>

<p>He telephoned the railway information offices and was informed
that there was a train for New York and the South in about an
hour. If he hurried, he could catch it. He did not have enough
money for the fare; he knew that he might hunt up Starwick, Dodd,
Professor Hatcher, or other people that he knew, and get the
money, but the delay would make him miss the train. Accordingly,
he appealed to the person he knew best in the house, and who
would be, he thought, most likely to help him. This was Mr. Wang,
the Chinese student.</p>

<p>Mr. Wang was as good-hearted as he was stupid and childlike
and now, faced with the need of getting money at once, the boy
appealed to him. Mr. Wang came to his door and blinked owlishly;
behind him the room was a blur of smoke and incense, and the big
cabinet victrola was giving forth for the dozenth time that
evening the hearty strains of "Yes, We Have No Bananas."</p>

<p>When Mr. Wang saw him, his round yellow face broke into a
foolish crease of merriment; he began to shake his finger at the
young man waggishly, and his throat already beginning to choke
and squeak a little with his jest, he said:</p>

<p>"I s'ink lest night I see you with nice--" Something in the
other's manner cut him short; he stopped, his round foolish face
grew wondering and solemn, and in a doubtful and inquiring tone,
he said:</p>

<p>"You say--?"</p>

<p>"Listen, Wang: I've just got this telegram from home. My
father is very sick--they think that he is dying. I've got to get
money to go home at once. I need fifty dollars: can you let me
have it?"</p>

<p>As Mr. Wang listened, his sparkling eyes grew dull as balls of
tar, his round yellow moon of face grew curiously impassive. When
the boy had finished, the Chinese thrust his hands into the wide
flowered sleeves of his dressing gown, and then with a curious
formal stiffness said:</p>

<p>"Will you come in? Please."</p>

<p>The boy entered, and Mr. Wang, closing the door, turned,
thrust his hand in his sleeves again, marched across the room to
a magnificent teak-wood desk and opening a small drawer, took out
a roll of bills, peeled off two twenties and a ten, and coming
back to where his visitor was standing, presented the money to
him with a stiff bow, and his round face still woodenly
impassive, said again:</p>

<p>"Please."</p>

<p>The young man seized the money and saying, "Thank you, Wang,
I'll send it to you as soon as I get home," ran back to his room
and began to hurl clothing, shirts, socks, toilet articles, into
his valise as hard as he could. He had just finished when there
was a tapping on the door and the Chinese appeared again. He
marched into the room with the same ceremonious formality that
had characterized his former conduct and bowing stiffly again,
presented the boy with two magnificent fans of peacock feathers
of which the lacquered blades were delicately and beautifully
engraved.</p>

<p>And bowing stiffly again, and saying, "Please!" he turned and
marched out of the room, his fat hands thrust into the wide
sleeves of the flowered dressing gown.</p>

<p>Thirty minutes later he was on his way, leaving behind him, in
the care of Mrs. Murphy, most of his belongings--the notebooks,
letters, books, old shoes, worn-out clothes and battered hats,
the thousands of pages of manuscript that represented the
accretions of three years--that immense and nondescript
collection of past events, foredone accomplishment, and spent
purposes, the very sight of which filled him with weariness and
horror but which, with the huge acquisitive mania of his mother's
blood, he had never been able to destroy.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>In this way he left Cambridge and a life he had known for two
years; instantly recalled, drawn back by the hand of death into
the immediacy of a former life that had grown strange as dreams.
It was toward the end of June, just a day or two before the
commencement exercises at the university. That year he had been
informed of his eligibility for the Master's degree--a degree he
had neither sought nor known he had earned and, at the time he
had received the telegram, he had been waiting for the formal
exercises at which he would receive the degree--a wait prompted
more by his total indecision as to his future purpose than by any
other cause. Now, with explosive suddenness, his purpose had been
shaped, decided for him, and with the old feeling of groping
bewilderment, he surveyed the history of the last two years and
wondered why he had come, why he was here, toward what blind goal
he had been tending: all that he had to "show" for these years of
fury, struggle, homelessness and hunger was an academic
distinction which he had not aimed at, and on which he placed
small value.</p>

<p>And it was in this spirit that he left the place. Rain had
begun to fall that night, it fell now in torrential floods. The
gay buntings and Japanese lanterns with which the Harvard Yard
was already decked were reduced to sodden ruin, and as he raced
towards the station in a taxi, the streets of Cambridge, and the
old, narrow, twisted and familiar lanes of Boston were
deserted--pools of wet light and glittering ribbons swept with
storm.</p>

<p>When he got to the South station he had five minutes left to
buy his ticket and get on his train. In spite of the lashing
storm and the lateness of the hour, that magnificent station,
which at that time--before the later "improvements" had reduced
it to a glittering sterility of tile and marble--was one of the
most thrilling and beautiful places in the world, was still busy
with the tides of people that hurry for ever through the great
stations of America, and that no violence of storm can check.</p>

<p>The vast dingy sweep of the cement concourse outside the
train-gates was pungent, as it had always been, with the acrid
and powerfully exciting smell of engine smoke, and beyond the
gates, upon a dozen tracks, great engines, passive and alert as
cats, purred and panted softly, with the couched menace of their
tremendous stroke. The engine smoke rose up straight in billowing
plumes to widen under vaulting arches, to spread foggily
throughout the enormous spaces of the grimy sheds. And beside the
locomotives, he could see the burly denimed figures of the
engineers, holding flaming torches and an oil-can in their hands
as they peered and probed through the shining flanges of terrific
pistoned wheels much taller than their heads. And for ever, over
the enormous cement concourse and down the quays beneath the
powerful groomed attentiveness of waiting trains the tides of
travellers kept passing, passing, in their everlasting change and
weft, of voyage and return--of speed and space and movement,
morning, cities, and new lands.</p>

<p>And caught up in the vaulting arches of those immense and
grimy sheds he heard again the murmurous sound of time--that
sound remote and everlasting, distilled out of all the movement,
frenzy, and unceasing fury of our unresting lives, and yet itself
detached, as calm and imperturbable as the still sad music of
humanity, and which, made up out of our million passing lives, is
in itself as fixed and everlasting as eternity.</p>

<p>They came, they paused and wove and passed and thrust and
vanished in their everlasting tides, they streamed in and out of
the portals of that enormous station in unceasing swarm; great
trains steamed in to empty them, and others steamed out loaded
with their nameless motes of lives, and all was as it had always
been, moving, changing, swarming on for ever like a river, and as
fixed, unutterable in unceasing movement and in changeless change
as the great river is, and time itself.</p>

<p>And within ten minutes he himself, another grain of dust borne
onward on this ceaseless tide, another nameless atom in this
everlasting throng, another wanderer in America, as all his
fathers were before him, was being hurled into the South again in
the huge projectile of a train. The train swept swiftly down the
gleaming rails, paused briefly at the Back-Bay station, then was
on its way again, moving smoothly, powerfully, almost noiselessly
now, through the outer stretches of the small dense web of
Boston. The town swept smoothly past: old blanks of wall, and old
worn brick, and sudden spokes of streets, deserted, lashed with
rain, set at the curbs with glittering beetles of its wet
machinery and empetalled with its wet and sudden blooms of life.
The flushed spoke-wires crossed his vision, lost the moment that
he saw them, his for ever, gone, like all things else, and never
to be captured, seen a million times, yet never known before--as
haunting, fading, deathless as a dream, as brief as is the bitter
briefness of man's days, as lost and lonely as his life upon the
mighty breast of earth, and of America.</p>

<p>Then the great train, gathering now in speed and mounting
smoothly to the summit of its tremendous stroke, was running
swiftly through the outskirts of the city, through suburbs and
brief blurs of light and then through little towns and on into
the darkness, the wild and secret loneliness of earth. And he was
going home again into the South and to a life that had grown
strange as dreams, and to his father who was dying and who had
become a ghost and shadow of his father to him, and to the bitter
reality of grief and death. And--how, why, for what reason he
could not say--all he felt was the tongueless swelling of wild
joy. It was the wild and secret joy that has no tongue, the
impossible hope that has no explanation, the savage, silent, and
sweet exultancy of night, the wild and lonely visage of the
earth, the imperturbable stroke and calmness of the everlasting
earth, from which we have been derived, wherein again we shall be
compacted, on which all of us have lived alone as strangers, and
across which, in the loneliness of night, we have been hurled
onward in the projectile flight of mighty trains--America.</p>

<p>Then the great train was given to the night and darkness, the
great train hurtled through the night across the lonely, wild,
and secret earth, bearing on to all their thousand destinations
its freight of unknown lives--some to morning, cities, new lands,
and the joy of voyages, and some to known faces, voices, and the
hills of home--but which to certain fortune, peace, security, and
love, no man could say.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>The news that Gant was dying had spread rapidly through the
town and, as often happens, that news had brought him back to
life again in the heart and living memory of men who had known
him, and who had scarcely thought of him for years. That
night--the night of his death--the house was filled with some of
the men who had known him best since he came to the town forty
years before.</p>

<p>Among these people were several of the prominent and wealthy
business men of the community: these included, naturally, Eliza's
brothers, William and James Pentland, both wealthy lumber
dealers, as well as one of her younger brothers, Crockett, who
was Will Pentland's bookkeeper, a pleasant, ruddy, bucolic man of
fifty years. Among the other men of wealth and influence who had
been Gant's friends there was Fagg Sluder, who had made a fortune
as a contractor and retired to invest his money in business
property, and to spend his time seated in an easy creaking chair
before the fire department, in incessant gossip about baseball
with the firemen and the young professional baseball players
whose chief support he was, whose annual deficit he cheerfully
supplied, and to whom he had given the local baseball park, which
bore his name. He had been one of Gant's best friends for twenty
years, he was immensely fond of him, and now, assembled in the
broad front hall in earnest discussion with the Pentlands and
Mike Fogarty, another of Gant's friends, and armed with the
invariable cigar (despite his doctor's orders he smoked thirty or
forty strong black cigars every day), which he chewed on, took
out of his mouth, and put back again, with quick, short,
unconscious movements, he could be heard saying in the rapid,
earnest, stammering tone that was one of the most attractive
qualities of his buoyant and constantly hopeful nature:</p>

<p>"I-I-I-I just believe he's going to pull right out of this
and-and-and-get well! Why-why-why-why-when I went in there
tonight he spoke right up and-and-and knew me right away!" he
blurted out, sticking the cigar in his mouth and chewing on it
vigorously a moment--"why-why-why his mind is-is-is-is just as
clear--as it always was--spoke right up, you know, says 'Sit
down, Fagg'--shook hands with me--knew me right away--talked to
me just the same way he always talked--says 'Sit down, Fagg. I'm
glad to see you. How have you been?' he says--and-and-and--I just
believe he's going to pull right out of this," Mr. Sluder blurted
out,--"be damned if I don't--what do <i>you</i> say, Will?" and
snatching his chewed cigar butt from his mouth he turned eagerly
to Will Pentland for confirmation. And Will, who, as usual, had
been paring his stubby nails during the whole course of the
conversation, his lips pursed in their characteristic family
grimace, now studied his clenched fingers for a moment, pocketed
his knife and turning to Fagg Sluder, with a little birdlike nod
and wink, and with the incomparable Pentland drawl, at once
precise and full of the relish of self-satisfaction, said:</p>

<p>"Well, if any man alive can do it, W. O. is that man. I've
seen him time and again when I thought every breath would be his
last--and he's got over it every time. I've always said," he went
on precisely, and with a kind of deadly directness in his small
compact and almost wizened face, "that he has more real vitality
than any two men that I ever knew--he's got out of worse holes
than this before--and he may do it again." He was silent a
moment, his small packed face pursed suddenly in its animal-like
grimace that had an almost savage ferocity and a sense of deadly
and indomitable power.</p>

<p>Even more astonishing and troubling was the presence of these
four older members of the Pentland family gathered together in
his mother's hall. As they stood there talking--Eliza with her
hands held in their loose and powerful clasp across her waist,
Will intently busy with his finger-nails, Jim listening
attentively to all that was said, his solid porcine face and
small eyes wincing from time to time in a powerful but
unconscious grimace, and Crockett, gentlest, ruddiest, most
easy-going and dreamy of them all, speaking in his quiet drawling
tone and stroking his soft brown moustaches in a gesture of quiet
and bucolic meditation, Luke could not recall having seen so many
of them together at one time and the astonishing enigma of their
one-ness and variety was strikingly apparent.</p>

<p>What was it?--this indefinable tribal similarity that united
these people so unmistakably. No one could say: it would have
been difficult to find four people more unlike in physical
appearance, more strongly marked by individual qualities.
Whatever it was--whether some chemistry of blood and character,
or perhaps some physical identity of broad and fleshy nose,
pursed reflective lips and flat wide cheeks, or the energies of
powerfully concentrated egotisms--their kinship with one another
was astonishing and instantly apparent.</p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h1>XXX</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>In a curious and indefinable way the two groups of men in the
hall had become divided: the wealthier group of prominent
citizens, which was composed of the brothers William, James, and
Crockett Pentland, Mr. Sluder and Eliza, stood in a group near
the front hall door, engaged in earnest conversation. The second
group, which was composed of working men, who had known Gant well
and worked for or with him--a group composed of Jannadeau the
jeweller, old Alec Ramsay and Saul Gudger, who were
stone-cutters, Gant's nephew, Ollie Gant, who was a plasterer,
Ernest Pegram, the city plumber, and Mike Fogarty, who was
perhaps Gant's closest friend, a building contractor--this group,
composed of men who had all their lives done stern labour with
their hands, and who were really the men who had known the
stone-cutter best, stood apart from the group of prominent and
wealthy men who were talking so earnestly to Eliza.</p>

<p>And in this circumstance, in this unconscious division, in the
air of constraint, vague uneasiness and awkward silence that was
evident among these working men, as they stood there in the hall
dressed in their "good clothes," nervously fingering their hats
in their big hands, there was something immensely moving. The men
had the look that working people the world over have always had
when they found themselves suddenly gathered together on terms of
social intimacy with their employers or with members of the
governing class.</p>

<p>And Helen, coming out at this instant from her father's room
into the hall, suddenly saw and felt the awkward division between
these two groups of men, as she had never before felt or noticed
it, as sharply as if they had been divided with a knife.</p>

<p>And, it must be admitted, her first feeling was an unworthy
one--an instinctive wish to approach the more "important" group,
to join her life to the lives of these "influential" people who
represented to her a "higher" social level. She found herself
walking towards the group of wealthy and prominent men at the
front of the hall, and away from the group of working men who had
really been Gant's best friends.</p>

<p>But seeing the brick-red race of Alec Ramsay, the mountainous
figure of Mike Fogarty, suddenly with a sense of disbelief and
almost terrified revelation of the truth, she thought:
"Why-why-why--these men are really the closest friends he's
got--not rich men like Uncle Will or Uncle Jim or even Mr.
Sluder--but men like Mike Fogarty--and Jannadeau--and Mr.
Duncan--and Alec Ramsay--and Ernest Pegram--and Ollie
Gant--but--but--good heavens, no!" she thought, almost
desperately--"surely these are not his closest
friends--why-why--of course, they're decent people--they're
honest men--but they're only common people--I've always
considered them as just <i>working</i> men--and-and-and--my God!"
she thought, with that terrible feeling of discovery we have when
we suddenly see ourselves as others see us--"do you suppose
that's the way people in this town think of Papa? Do you suppose
they have always thought of him as just a common working man--oh,
no! but of course not!" she went on impatiently, trying to put
the troubling thought out of her mind. "Papa's not a working
man--Papa is a <i>business</i> man--a well-thought-of business
man in this community. Papa has always owned property since he
came here--he has always had his own shop"--she did not like the
sound of the word "shop," and in her mind she hastily amended it
to "place"--"he's always had his own place, up on the public
square--he's--he's rented places to other people--he's--he's--oh,
of course not!--Papa is different from men like Ernest Pegram,
and Ollie, and Jannadeau and Alec Ramsay--why, they're just
working men--they work with their hands--Ollie's just an ordinary
plasterer--and-and--Mr. Ramsay is nothing but a
stone-cutter."</p>

<p>And a small insistent voice inside her said most quietly: "And
your father?"</p>

<p>And suddenly Helen remembered Gant's great hands of power and
strength, and how they now lay quietly beside him on the bed, and
lived and would not die, even when the rest of him had died, and
she remembered the thousands of times she had gone to his shop in
the afternoon and found the stone-cutter in his long striped
apron bending with delicate concentration over a stone
inscription on a trestle, holding in his great hands the chisel
and the heavy wooden mallet the stone-cutters use, and
remembering, the whole rich and living compact of the past came
back to her, in a rush of tenderness and joy and terror, and on
that flood a proud and bitter honesty returned. She thought:
"Yes, he was a stone-cutter, no different from these other men,
and these men were his real friends."</p>

<p>And going directly to old Alec Ramsay she grasped his blunt
thick fingers, the nails of which were always whitened a little
with stone dust, and greeted him in her large and spacious
way:</p>

<p>"Mr. Ramsay," she said, "I want you to know how glad we are
that you could come. And that goes for all of you--Mr. Jannadeau,
and Mr. Duncan, and Mr. Fogarty, and you, Ernest, and you, too,
Ollie--you are the best friends Papa has, there's no one he
thinks more of and no one he would rather see."</p>

<p>Mr. Ramsay's brick-red face and brick-red neck became even
redder before he spoke, and beneath his grizzled brows his blue
eyes suddenly were smoke-blue. He put his blunt hand to his
moustache for a moment, and tugged at it, then he said in his
gruff, quiet, and matter-of-fact voice:</p>

<p>"I guess we know Will about as well as anyone, Miss Helen.
I've worked for him off and on for thirty years."</p>

<p>At the same moment, she heard Ollie Gant's easy, deep, and
powerful laugh, and saw him slowly lift his cigarette in his
coarse paw; she saw Jannadeau's great yellow face and massive
domy brow, and heard him laugh with guttural pleasure, saying,
"Ah-h! I tell you vat! Dat girl has alvays looked out for her
datty--she's de only vun dat coult hantle him; efer since she vas
ten years olt it has been de same." And she was overwhelmingly
conscious of that immeasurable mountain of a man, Mike Fogarty,
beside her, the sweet clarity of his blue eyes and the almost
purring music of his voice as he gently laid his mutton of a hand
upon her shoulder for a moment, saying:</p>

<p>"Ah, Miss Helen, I don't know how Will could have got along
all these years without ye--for he has said the same himself a
thousand times--aye! that he has!"</p>

<p>And instantly, having heard these words, and feeling the
strong calm presences of these powerful men around her, it seemed
to Helen she had somehow re-entered a magic world that she
thought was gone for ever. And she was immensely content.</p>

<p>At the same moment, with a sense of wonder, she discovered an
astonishing thing, that she had never noticed before, but that
she must have heard a thousand times;--this was that of all these
people, who knew Gant best, and had a deep and true affection for
him, there were only two--Mr. Fogarty and Mr. Ramsay--who had
ever addressed him by his first name. And so far as she could now
remember, these two men, together with Gant's mother, his
brothers, his sister Augusta, and a few of the others who had
known him in his boyhood in Pennsylvania, were the only people
who ever had. And this revelation cast a strange, a lonely and a
troubling light upon the great gaunt figure of the stone-cutter,
which moved her powerfully and which she had never felt before.
And most strange of all was the variety of names by which these
various people called her father.</p>

<p>As for Eliza, had any of her children ever heard her address
her husband as anything but "Mr. Gant"--had she ever called him
by one of his first names--their anguish of shame and impropriety
would have been so great that they could hardly have endured it.
But such a lapse would have been incredible: Eliza could no more
have addressed Gant by his first name than she could have quoted
Homer's Greek; had she tried to address him so, the muscles of
her tongue would have found it physically impossible to pronounce
the word. And in this fact there was somehow, now that Gant was
dying, an enormous pathos. It gave to Eliza's life with him a
pitiable and moving dignity, the compensation of a proud and
wounded spirit for all the insults and injuries that had been
heaped upon it. She had been a young countrywoman of twenty-four
when she had met him; she had been ignorant of life and innocent
of the cruelty, the violence, the drunkenness and abuse of which
men are capable; she had borne this man fifteen children, of whom
eight had come to life, and had for forty years eaten the bread
of blood and tears and joy and grief and terror; she had wanted
affection and had been given taunts, abuse, and curses, and
somehow her proud and wounded spirit had endured with an
anguished but unshaken fortitude all the wrongs and cruelties and
injustices of which he had been guilty toward her. And now at the
very end her pride still had this pitiable distinction, her
spirit still preserved this last integrity: she had not betrayed
her wounded soul to a shameful familiarity, he had remained to
her--in mind and heart and living word--what he had been from the
first day that she met him: the author of her grief and misery,
the agent of her suffering, the gaunt and lonely stranger who had
come into her hills from a strange land and a distant
people--that furious, gaunt, and lonely stranger with whom by
fatal accident her destiny--past hate or love or birth or death
or human error and confusion--had been insolubly enmeshed, with
whom for forty years she had lived, a wife, a mother, and a
stranger--and who would to the end remain to her a stranger--"Mr.
Gant."</p>

<p>What was it? What was the secret of this strange and bitter
mystery of life that had made of Gant a stranger to all men, and
most of all a stranger to his wife? Perhaps some of the answer
might have been found in Eliza's own unconscious words when she
described her meeting with him forty years before:</p>

<p>"It was not that he was old," she said,--"he was only
thirty-three--but he <i>looked</i> old--his <i>ways</i> were
old--he lived so much among old people.--Pshaw!" she continued,
with a little puckered smile, "if anyone had told me that night I
saw him sitting there with Lydia and old Mrs. Mason--that was the
very day they moved into the house, the night he gave the big
dinner--and Lydia was still alive and, of course, she was ten
years older than he was, and that may have had something to do
with it--but I got to studying him as he sat there; of course, he
was tired and run down and depressed and worried over all that
trouble that he'd had in Sidney before he came up here, when he
lost everything, and he knew that Lydia was dying, and that was
preyin' on his mind--but he <i>looked</i> old, thin as a rake you
know, and sallow and run down, and with those <i>old</i> ways he
had acquired, I reckon, from associatin' with Lydia and old Mrs.
Mason and people like that--but I just sat there studying him as
he sat there with them and I said--'Well, you're an old man,
aren't you, sure enough?'--pshaw! if anyone had told me that
night that some day I'd be married to him I'd have laughed at
them--I'd have considered that I was marrying an old man--and
that's just exactly what a lot of people thought, sir, when the
news got out that I was goin' to marry him--I know Martha Patton
came running to me, all excited and out of breath--said, 'Eliza!
You're not going to marry that old man--you know you're
not!'--you see, his <i>ways</i> were old, he <i>looked</i> old,
<i>dressed</i> old, <i>acted</i> old--everything he did was old;
there was always, it seemed, something strange and old-like about
him, almost like had he been born that way."</p>

<p>And it was at this time that Eliza met him, saw him
first--"Mr. Gant"--an immensely tall, gaunt, cadaverous-looking
man, with a face stern and sad with care, lank drooping
moustaches, sandy hair, and cold-grey staring eyes--"not so old,
you know--he was only thirty-three--but he <i>looked</i> old, he
<i>acted</i> old, his <i>ways</i> were old--he had lived so much
among older people he seemed older than he was--I thought of him
as an old man."</p>

<p>This, then, was "Mr. Gant" at thirty-three, and since then,
although his fortunes and position had improved, his character
had changed little. And now Helen, faced by all these working
men, who had known, liked, and respected him, and had now come to
see him again before he died--suddenly knew the reason for his
loneliness, the reason so few people--least of all, his wife--had
ever dared address him by his first name. And with a swift and
piercing revelation, his muttered words, which she had heard him
use a thousand times when speaking of his childhood--"We had a
tough time of it--I tell you what, we did!"--now came back to her
with the unutterable poignancy of discovery. For the first time
she understood what they meant. And suddenly, with the same swift
and nameless pity, she remembered all the pictures which she had
seen of her father as a boy and a young man. There were a
half-dozen of them in the big family album, together with
pictures of his own and Eliza's family: they were the small
daguerreotypes of fifty years before, in small frames of faded
plush, with glass covers, touched with the faint pale pinks with
which the photographers of an earlier time tried to paint with
life the sallow hues of their photography. The first of these
pictures showed Gant as a little boy; later, a boy of twelve, he
was standing in a chair beside his brother Wesley, who was
seated, with a wooden smile upon his face. Later, a picture of
Gant in the years in Baltimore, standing, his feet crossed,
leaning elegantly upon a marble slab beside a vase; later still,
the young stone-cutter before his little shop in the years at
Sidney; finally, Gant, after his marriage with Eliza, standing
with gaunt face and lank drooping moustaches before his shop upon
the square, in the company of Will Pentland, who was at the time
his business partner.</p>

<p>And all these pictures, from first to last, from the little
boy to the man with the lank drooping moustaches, had been marked
by the same expression: the sharp thin face was always stern and
sad with care, the shallow cold-grey eyes always stared out of
the bony cage-formation of the skull with a cold
mournfulness--the whole impression was always one of gaunt sad
loneliness. And it was not the loneliness of the dreamer, the
poet, or the misjudged prophet, it was just the cold and terrible
loneliness of man, of every man, and of the lost American who has
been brought forth naked under immense and lonely skies, to
"shift for himself," to grope his way blindly through the
confusion and brutal chaos of a life as naked and unsure as he,
to wander blindly down across the continent, to hunt for ever for
a goal, a wall, a dwelling-place of warmth and certitude, a
light, a door.</p>

<p>And for this reason, she now understood something about her
father, this great gaunt figure of a stone-cutter that she had
never understood or thought about before: she suddenly understood
his order, sense of decency and dispatch; his love of cleanness,
roaring fires, and rich abundance, his foul drunkenness,
violence, and howling fury, his naked shame and trembling
penitence, his good clothes of heavy monumental black that he
always kept well pressed, his clean boiled shirts, wing collars,
and his love of hotels, ships, and trains, his love of gardens,
new lands, cities, voyages. She knew suddenly that he was unlike
any other man that ever lived, and that every man that ever lived
was like her father. And remembering the cold and mournful look
in his shallow staring eyes of cold hard grey, she suddenly knew
the reason for that look, as she had never known it before, and
understood now why so few men had ever called him by his first
name--why he was known to all the world as "Mr. Gant."</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Having joined this group of working men, Helen immediately
felt an indefinable but powerful sense of comfort and physical
well-being which the presence of such men as these always gave to
her. And she did not know why; but immediately, once she had
grasped Mr. Ramsay by the hand, and was aware of Mike Fogarty's
mountainous form and clear-blue eye above her, and Ollie Gant's
deep and lazy laugh, and the deliberate and sensual languor with
which he raised his cigarette to his lips with his powerful
plasterer's hand, drawing the smoke deep into his strong lungs
and letting it trickle slowly from his nostrils as he talked--she
was conscious of a feeling of enormous security and relief which
she had not known in years.</p>

<p>And this feeling, as with every person of strong sensuous
perceptions, was literal, physical, chemical, astoundingly acute.
She not only felt an enormous relief and joy to get back to these
working people, it even seemed to her that everything they
did--the way Mr. Duncan held his strong cheap cigar in his thick
dry fingers, the immense satisfaction with which he drew on it,
the languid and sensual trickling of cigarette smoke from Ollie
Gant's nostrils, his deep, good-natured, indolently lazy laugh,
even the perceptible bulge of tobacco-quid in Alec Ramsay's
brick-red face, his barely perceptible rumination of it--all
these things, though manlike in their nature, seemed wonderfully
good and fresh and living to her--the whole plain priceless glory
of the earth restored to her--and gave her a feeling of wonderful
happiness and joy.</p>

<p>And later that night when all these men, her father's friends,
had gone into his room, filling it with their enormous and
full-blooded vitality, as she saw him lying there, wax-pale,
bloodless, motionless, yet with a faint grin at the edge of his
thin mouth as he received them, as she heard their deep
full-fibred voices, Mike Fogarty's lilting Irish, Mr. Duncan's
thick Scotch burr, Ollie Gant's deep and lazy laugh, and the
humour of Alec Ramsay's deep, gruff and matter-of-fact tone,
relating old times--"God, Will!" he said, "at your worst, you
weren't in it compared to Wes! He was a holy terror when he
drank! Do you remember the day he drove his fist through your
plate-glass window right in the face of Jannadeau--and went home
then and tore all the plumbing out of the house and pitched the
bath-tub out of the second-storey window into Orchard
Street--God! Will!--you weren't in it compared to Wes"--as she
heard all this, and saw Gant's thin grin and heard his faint and
rusty cackle, his almost inaudible "E'God! Poor Wes!"--she could
not believe that he was going to die, the great full-blooded
working men filled the room with the vitality of a life which had
returned in all its rich and living flood, and seemed intolerably
near and familiar--and she kept thinking with a feeling of
wonderful happiness and disbelief: "Oh, but Papa's not going to
die! It's not possible! He can't! He can't!"</p>

<p>The dying man himself was no longer to be fooled and duped by
hope; he knew that he was done for, and he no longer cared.
Rather, as if that knowledge had brought him a new strength--the
immense and measureless strength that comes from resignation and
that has vanquished terror and despair--Gant had already
consigned himself to death, and now was waiting for it, without
weariness or anxiety, and with a perfect and peaceful
acquiescence.</p>

<p>This complete resignation and tranquillity of a man whose life
had been so full of violence, protest, and howling fury stunned
and silenced them and left them helpless. It seemed that Gant,
knowing that often he had lived badly, was now determined to die
well. And in this he succeeded. He accepted every ministration,
every visit, every stammering reassurance, or frenzied activity,
with a passive gratefulness which he seemed to want everyone to
know. On the evening of the day after his first h&aelig;morrhage,
he asked for food and Eliza, bustling out, pathetically eager to
do something, killed a chicken and cooked it for him.</p>

<p>And as if, from that infinite depth of death and silence from
which he looked at her, he had seen, behind the bridling brisk
activity of her figure, for ever bustling back and forth, saying
confusedly--"Why, yes! The very thing! This very minute,
sir!"--had seen the white strained face, the stricken eyes of a
proud and sensitive woman who had wanted affection all her life,
had received for the most part injury and abuse, and who was
ready to clutch at any crust of comfort that might console or
justify her before he died--he ate part of the chicken with
relish, and then, looking up at her, said quietly:</p>

<p>"I tell you what--that was a good chicken."</p>

<p>And Helen, who had been sitting beside him on the bed, and
feeding him, now cried out in a tone of bantering and
good-humoured challenge:</p>

<p>"What! Is it better than the ones <i>I</i> cook for you? You'd
better not say it is--I'll beat you if you do.'"</p>

<p>And Gant, grinning feebly, shook his head, and answered:</p>

<p>"Ah-h! Your mother is a good cook, Helen. You're a good cook,
too--but there's no one else can cook a chicken like your
mother!"</p>

<p>And stretching out his great right hand, he patted Eliza's
worn fingers with his own.</p>

<p>And Eliza, suddenly touched by that word of unaccustomed
praise and tenderness, turned and rushed blindly from the room at
a clumsy bridling gait, clasping her hands together at the wrist,
her weak eyes blind with tears--shaking her head in a strong
convulsive movement, her mouth smiling a pale tremulous smile,
ludicrous, touching, made unnatural by her false teeth,
whispering over and over to herself, Poor fellow! Says, 'There's
no one else can cook a chicken like your mother.' Reached out and
patted me on the hand, you know. Says 'I tell you what, there's
no one who can cook a chicken like your mother.' I reckon he
wanted to let me know, to tell me, but says, 'The rest of you
have all been good to me, Helen's a good cook, but there's no one
else can cook like your mother.'"</p>

<p>"Oh, here, here, here!" said Helen, who, laughing uncertainly
had followed her mother from the room when Eliza had rushed out,
and had seized her by the arms, and shook her gently, "good
heavens! <i>Here!</i> You mustn't carry on like this! You mustn't
take it this way! Why, he's all right!" she cried out heartily
and shook Eliza again. "Papa's going to be all right! Why, what
are you crying for?" she laughed. "He's going to get well
now--don't you know that?"</p>

<p>And Eliza could say nothing for a moment but kept smiling that
false trembling and unnatural smile, shaking her head in a slight
convulsive movement, her eyes blind with tears.</p>

<p>"I tell you what," she whispered, smiling tremulously again
and shaking her head, "there was something about it--you know,
the way he said it--says, 'There's no one who can come up to your
mother'--there was something in the way he said it! Poor fellow,
says, 'None of the rest of you can cook like her'--says, 'I tell
you what, that was certainly a good chicken'--Poor fellow! It
wasn't so much what he said as the way he said it--there was
something about it that went through me like a knife--I tell you
what it did!"</p>

<p>"Oh, here, here, here!" Helen cried again, laughing. But her
own eyes were also wet, the bitter possessiveness that had
dominated all her relations with her father, and that had thrust
Eliza away from him, was suddenly vanquished. At that moment she
began to feel an affection for her mother that she had never felt
before, a deep and nameless pity and regret, and a sense of
sombre satisfaction.</p>

<p>"Well," she thought, "I guess it's all she's had, but I'm glad
she's got that much to remember. I'm glad he said it: she'll
always have that now to hang on to."</p>

<p>And Gant lay looking up from that sunken depth of death and
silence, his great hands of living power quiet with their immense
and passive strength beside him on the bed.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Towards one o'clock that night Gant fell asleep and dreamed
that he was walking down the road that led to Spangler's Run. And
although he had not been along that road for fifty years
everything was as fresh, as green, as living and familiar as it
had ever been to him. He came out on the road from Schaefer's
farm, and on his left he passed by the little white frame church
of the United Brethren, and the graveyard about the church where
his friends and family had been buried. From the road he could
see the line of family gravestones which he himself had carved
and set up after he had returned from serving his apprenticeship
in Baltimore. The stones were all alike: tall flat slabs of
marble with plain rounded tops, and there was one for his sister
Susan, who had died in infancy, and one for his sister Huldah,
who had died in childbirth while the war was on, and one for
Huldah's husband, a young farmer named Jake Lentz who had been
killed at Chancellorsville, and one for the husband of his oldest
sister, Augusta, a man named Martin, who had been an itinerant
photographer and had died soon after the war, and finally one for
Gant's own father. And since there were no stones for his brother
George or for Elmer or for John, and none for his mother or
Augusta, Gant knew that he was still a young man, and had just
recently come home. The stones which he had put up were still
white and new, and in the lower right-hand corner of each stone,
he had carved his own name: W. O. Gant.</p>

<p>It was a fine morning in early May and everything was sweet
and green and as familiar as it had always been. The graveyard
was carpeted with thick green grass, and all around the graveyard
and the church there was the incomparable green velvet of young
wheat. And the thought came back to Gant, as it had come to him a
thousand times, that the wheat around the graveyard looked
greener and richer than any other wheat that he had ever seen.
And beside him on his right were the great fields of the Schaefer
farm, some richly carpeted with young green wheat, and some
ploughed, showing great bronze-red strips of fertile
nobly-swelling earth. And behind him on the great swell of the
land, and commanding that sweet and casual scene with the majesty
of its incomparable lay was Jacob Schaefer's great red barn and
to the right the neat brick house with the white trimming of its
windows, the white picket fence, the green yard with its rich
tapestry of flowers and lilac bushes and the massed leafy spread
of its big maple trees. And behind the house the hill rose, and
all its woods were just greening into May, still smoky, tender
and unfledged, gold-yellow with the magic of young green. And
before the woods began there was the apple orchard half-way up
the hill; the trees were heavy with the blossoms and stood there
in all their dense still bloom incredible.</p>

<p>And from the greening trees the bird-song rose, the grass was
thick with the dense gold glory of the dandelions, and all about
him were a thousand magic things that came and went and never
could be captured. Below the church, he passed the old
frame-house where Elly Spangler, who kept the church keys, lived,
and there were apple trees behind the house, all dense with
bloom, but the house was rickety, unpainted and dilapidated as it
had always been, and he wondered if the kitchen was still buzzing
with a million flies, and if Elly's half-wit brothers, Jim and
Willy, were inside. And even as he shook his head and thought, as
he had thought so many times, "Poor Elly," the back door opened
and Willy Spangler, a man past thirty, wearing overalls and with
a fond, foolish witless face, came galloping down across the yard
toward him, flinging his arms out in exuberant greeting, and
shouting to him the same welcome that he shouted out to everyone
who passed, friends and strangers all alike--"I've been lookin'
fer ye! I've been lookin' fer ye, Oll," using, as was the custom
of the friends and kinsmen of his Pennsylvania boyhood, his
second name--and then, anxiously, pleadingly, again the same
words that he spoke to everyone: "Ain't ye goin' to stay?"</p>

<p>And Gant, grinning, but touched by the indefinable sadness and
pity which that kind and witless greeting had always stirred in
him since his own childhood, shook his head, and said
quietly:</p>

<p>"No, Willy. Not today. I'm meeting someone down the road"--and
straightway felt, with thudding heart, a powerful and nameless
excitement, the urgency of that impending meeting--why, where,
with whom, he did not know--but all-compelling now,
inevitable.</p>

<p>And Willy, still with wondering, foolish, kindly face followed
along beside him now, saying eagerly, as he said to everyone:</p>

<p>"Did ye bring anythin' fer me? Have ye got a chew?"</p>

<p>And Gant, starting to shake his head in refusal, stopped
suddenly, seeing the look of disappointment on the idiot's face,
and putting his hand in the pocket of his coat, took out a plug
of apple-tobacco, saying:</p>

<p>"Yes. Here you are, Willy. You can have this."</p>

<p>And Willy, grinning with foolish joy, had clutched the plug of
tobacco and, still kind and foolish, had followed on a few steps
more, saying anxiously:</p>

<p>"Are ye comin' back, Oll? Will ye be comin' back real
soon?"</p>

<p>And Gant, feeling a strange and nameless sorrow, answered:</p>

<p>"I don't know, Willy"--for suddenly he saw that he might never
come this way again.</p>

<p>But Willy, still happy, foolish, and contented, had turned and
galloped away toward the house, flinging his arms out and
shouting as he went:</p>

<p>"I'll be waitin' fer ye. I'll be waitin' fer ye, Oll."</p>

<p>And Gant went on then, down the road, and there was a nameless
sorrow in him that he could not understand and some of the
brightness had gone out of the day.</p>

<p>When he got to the mill, he turned left along the road that
went down by Spangler's Run, crossed by the bridge below, and
turned from the road into the wood-path on the other side. A
child was standing in the path, and turned and went on ahead of
him. In the wood the sunlight made swarming moths of light across
the path and through the leafy tangle of the trees: the sunlight
kept shifting and swarming on the child's golden hair, and all
around him were the sudden noises of the wood, the stir, the
rustle, and the bullet thrum of wings, the cool broken sound of
hidden water.</p>

<p>The wood got denser, darker as he went on and coming to a
place where the path split away into two forks, Gant stopped, and
turning to the child said, "Which one shall I take?" And the
child did not answer him.</p>

<p>But someone was there in the wood before him. He heard
footsteps on the path, and saw a footprint in the earth, and
turning took the path where the footprint was and where it seemed
he could hear someone walking.</p>

<p>And then, with the bridgeless instancy of dreams, it seemed to
him that all of the bright green-gold around him in the wood grew
dark and sombre, the path grew darker, and suddenly he was
walking in a strange and gloomy forest, haunted by the brown and
tragic light of dreams. The forest shapes of great trees rose
around him, he could hear no bird-song now, even his own feet on
the path were soundless, but he always thought he heard the sound
of someone walking in the wood before him. He stopped and
listened: the steps were muffled, softly thunderous; they seemed
so near that he thought that he must catch up with the one he
followed in another second, and then they seemed immensely far
away, receding in the dark mystery of that gloomy wood. And again
he stopped and listened, the footsteps faded, vanished, he
shouted, no one answered. And suddenly he knew that he had taken
the wrong path, that he was lost. And in his heart there was an
immense and quiet sadness, and the dark light of the enormous
wood was all around him; no birds sang.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Gant awoke suddenly and found himself looking straight up at
Eliza, who was seated in a chair beside the bed.</p>

<p>"You were asleep," she said quietly with a grave smile,
looking at him in her direct and almost accusing fashion.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, breathing a little hoarsely, "what time is
it?"</p>

<p>It was a few minutes before three o'clock in the morning. She
looked at the clock and told him the time: he asked where Helen
was.</p>

<p>"Why," said Eliza quickly, "she's right here in this hall
room: I reckon she's asleep, too. Said she was tired, you know,
but that if you woke up and needed her to call her. Do you want
me to get her?"</p>

<p>"No," said Gant. "Don't bother her. I guess she needs the
rest, poor child. Let her sleep."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Eliza, nodding, "and that's exactly what you must
do, too, Mr. Gant. You try to go on back to sleep now," she said
coaxingly, "for that's what we all need. There's no medicine like
sleep--as the fellow says, it's Nature's sovereign remedy," said
Eliza, with that form of sententiousness that she was very fond
of--"so you go on, now, Mr. Gant, and get a good night's sleep,
and when you wake up in the morning, you'll feel like a new man.
That's half the battle--if you can get your sleep, you're already
on the road to recovery."</p>

<p>"No," said Gant, "I've slept enough."</p>

<p>He was breathing rather hoarsely and heavily and she asked him
if he was comfortable and needed anything. He made no answer for
a moment, and then muttered something under his breath that she
could not hear plainly, but that sounded like "little boy."</p>

<p>"Hah? What say? What is it, Mr. Gant?" Eliza said. "Little
boy?" she said sharply, as he did not answer.</p>

<p>"Did you see him?" he said.</p>

<p>She looked at him for a moment with troubled eyes, then
said:</p>

<p>"Pshaw, Mr. Gant, I guess you must have been dreaming."</p>

<p>He did not answer, and for a moment there was no sound in the
room but his breathing, hoarse, a little heavy. Then he
muttered:</p>

<p>"Did someone come into the house?"</p>

<p>She looked at him sharply, inquiringly again, with troubled
eyes:</p>

<p>"Hah? What say? Why, no, I think not," she said doubtfully,
"unless you may have heard Gilmer come in an' go up to his
room."</p>

<p>And Gant was again silent for several moments, breathing a
little heavily and hoarsely, his hands resting with an enormous
passive strength upon the bed. Presently he said quietly:</p>

<p>"Where's Bacchus?"</p>

<p>"Hah? Who's that?" Eliza said sharply, in a startled kind of
tone. "Bacchus? You mean Uncle Bacchus?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Gant.</p>

<p>"Why, pshaw, Mr. Gant!" cried Eliza laughing--for a startled
moment she had wondered if "his mind was wanderin'," but one
glance at his quiet eyes, the tranquil sanity of his quiet tone,
reassured her--</p>

<p>"Pshaw!" she said, putting one finger up to her broad
nose-wing and laughing slyly. "You must have been havin' queer
dreams, for a fact!"</p>

<p>"Is he here?"</p>

<p>"Why, I'll vow, Mr. Gant!" she cried again. "What on earth is
in your mind? You know that Uncle Bacchus is way out West in
Oregon--it's been ten years since he came back home last--that
summer of the reunion at Gettysburg."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Gant. "I remember now."</p>

<p>And again he fell silent, staring upward in the semi-darkness,
his hands quietly at rest beside him, breathing a little
hoarsely, but without pain. Eliza sat in the chair watching him,
her hands clasped loosely at her waist, her lips pursed
reflectively, and a puzzled look in her eyes. "Now I wonder
whatever put that in his mind?" she thought. "I wonder what made
him think of Bacchus? Now his mind's not wanderin'--that's one
thing sure. He knows what he's doing just as well as I do--I
reckon he must have dreamed it--that Bacchus was here--but that's
certainly a strange thing, that he should bring it up like
this."</p>

<p>He was so silent that she thought he might have gone to sleep
again, he lay motionless with his eyes turned upward in the
semi-darkness of the room, his hands immense and passive at his
side. But suddenly he startled her again by speaking, a voice so
quiet and low that he might have been talking to himself.</p>

<p>"Father died the year before the war," he said, "when I was
nine years old. I never got to know him very well. I guess Mother
had a hard time of it. There were seven of us--and nothing but
that little place to live on--and some of us too young to help
her much--and George away at war. She spoke pretty hard to us
sometimes--but I guess she had a hard time of it. It was a tough
time for all of us," he muttered, "I tell you what, it was."</p>

<p>"Yes," Eliza said, "I guess it was. I know, she told me--I
talked to her, you know, the time we went there on our
honeymoon--whew! what about it?" she shrieked faintly and put her
finger up to her broad nose-wing with the same sly gesture--"it
was all I could do to keep a straight face sometimes--why, you
know, the way she had of talkin'--the expressions she used--oh!
came right out with it, you know--sometimes I'd have to turn my
head away so she wouldn't see me laughin'--says, you know, 'I was
left a widow with seven children to bring up, but I never took
charity from no one; as I told 'em all, I've crawled under the
dog's belly all my life; now I guess I can get over its
back.'"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Gant with a faint grin. "Many's the time I've
heard her say that."</p>

<p>"But she told it then, you know," Eliza went on in explanatory
fashion, "about your father and how he'd done hard labour on a
farm all his life and died--well, I reckon you'd call it
consumption."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Gant. "That was it."</p>

<p>"And," Eliza said reflectively, "I never asked--of course, I
didn't want to embarrass her--but I reckon from what she said, he
may have been--well, I suppose you might say he was a drinkin'
man."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Gant, "I guess he was."</p>

<p>"And I know she told it on him," said Eliza, laughing again,
and passing one finger slyly at the corner of her broad
nose-wing, "how he went to town that time--to Brant's Mill, I
guess it was--and how she was afraid he'd get to drinkin', and
she sent you and Wes along to watch him and to see he got home
again--and how he met up with some fellers there and, sure
enough, I guess he started drinkin' and stayed away too long--and
then, I reckon he was afraid of what she'd say to him when he got
back--and that was when he bought the clock--it's that very clock
upon the mantel, Mr. Gant--but that was when he got the clock,
all right--I guess he thought it would pacify her when she
started out to scold him for gettin' drunk and bein' late."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Gant, who had listened without moving, staring at
the ceiling, and with a faint grin printed at the corners of his
mouth, "well do I remember: that was it, all right."</p>

<p>"And then," Eliza went on, "he lost the way comin' home--it
had been snowin', and I reckon it was getting dark, and he had
been drinkin'--and instead of turnin' in on the road that went
down by your place he kept goin' on until he passed Jake
Schaefer's farm--an' I guess Wes and you, poor child, kept
follerin' where he led, thinkin' it was all right--and when he
realized his mistake he said he was tired an' had to rest a while
and--I'll vow! to think he'd go and do a thing like that," said
Eliza, laughing again--"he lay right down in the snow, sir, with
the clock beside him--and went sound to sleep."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Gant, "and the clock was broken."</p>

<p>"Yes," Eliza said, "she told me about that too--and how she
heard you all come creepin' in real quiet an' easy-like about
nine o'clock that night, when she and all the children were in
bed--an' how she could hear him whisperin' to you and Wes to be
quiet--an' how she heard you all come creepin' up the steps--and
how he came tip-toein' in real easy-like an' laid the clock down
on the bed--I reckon the glass had been broken out of it--hopin'
she'd see it when she woke up in the morning an' wouldn't scold
him then for stayin' out--"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Gant, still with the faint attentive grin, "and
then the clock began to strike."</p>

<p>"Whew-w!" cried Eliza, putting her finger underneath her broad
nose-wing--"I know she had to laugh about it when she told it to
me--she said that all of you looked so sheepish when the clock
began to strike that she didn't have the heart to scold him."</p>

<p>And Gant, grinning faintly again, emitted a faint rusty cackle
that sounded like "E'God!" and said: "Yes, that was it. Poor
fellow."</p>

<p>"But to think," Eliza went on, "that he would have no more
sense than to do a thing like that--to lay right down there in
the snow an' go to sleep with you two children watchin' him. And
I know how she told it, how she questioned you and Wes next day,
and I reckon started in to scold you for not takin' better care
of him, and how you told her, 'Well, Mother, I thought that it
would be all right. I kept steppin' where he stepped, I thought
he knew the way.' And said she didn't have the heart to scold you
after that--poor child, I reckon you were only eight or nine
years old, and boy-like thought you'd follow in your father's
footsteps and that everything would be all right."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Gant, with the faint grin again, "I kept
stretchin' my legs to put my feet down in his tracks--it was all
I could do to keep up with him. . . . Ah, Lord," he said, and in
a moment said in a faint low voice, "how well I can remember it.
That was just the winter before he died."</p>

<p>"And you've had that old clock ever since," Eliza said. "That
very clock upon the mantel, sir--at least, you've had it ever
since I've known you, and I reckon you had it long before
that--for I know you told me how you brought it South with you.
And that clock must be all of sixty or seventy years old--if it's
a day."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Gant, "it's all of that."</p>

<p>And again he was silent, and lay so still and motionless that
there was no sound in the room except his faint and laboured
breathing, the languid stir of the curtains in the cool night
breeze, and the punctual tocking of the old wooden clock. And
presently, when she thought that he might have gone off to sleep
again, he spoke, in the same remote and detached voice as
before:</p>

<p>"Eliza,"--he said--and at the sound of that unaccustomed word,
a name he had spoken only twice in forty years--her white face
and her worn brown eyes turned toward him with the quick and
startled look of an animal--"Eliza," he said quietly, "you have
had a hard life with me, a hard time. I want to tell you that I'm
sorry."</p>

<p>And before she could move from her white stillness of shocked
surprise, he lifted his great right hand and put it gently down
across her own. And for a moment she sat there bolt upright,
shaken, frozen, with a look of terror in her eyes, her heart
drained of blood, a pale smile trembling uncertainly and
foolishly on her lips. Then she tried to withdraw her hand with a
clumsy movement, she began to stammer with an air of ludicrous
embarrassment, she bridled, saying--"Aw-w, now, Mr. Gant. Well,
now, I reckon,"--and suddenly these few simple words of regret
and affection did what all the violence, abuse, drunkenness and
injury of forty years had failed to do. She wrenched her hand
free like a wounded creature, her face was suddenly contorted by
that grotesque and pitiable grimace of sorrow that women have had
in moments of grief since the beginning of time, and digging her
fist into her closed eye quickly with the pathetic gesture of a
child, she lowered her head and wept bitterly.</p>

<p>"It was a hard time, Mr. Gant," she whispered, "a hard time,
sure enough. . . . It wasn't all the cursin' and the drinkin'--I
got used to that. . . . I reckon I was only an ignorant sort of
girl when I met you and I guess," she went on with a pathetic and
unconscious humour, "I didn't know what married life was like . .
. but I could have stood the rest of it . . . the bad names an'
all the things you called me when I was goin' to have another
child . . . but it was what you said when Grover died . . .
accusin' me of bein' responsible for his death because I took the
children to St. Louis to the Fair--" and at the words as if an
old and lacerated wound had been reopened raw and bleeding, she
wept hoarsely, harshly, bitterly--"that was the worst time that I
had--sometimes I prayed to God that I would not wake up--he was a
fine boy, Mr. Gant, the best I had--like the write-up in the
paper said he had the sense an' judgment of one twice his age . .
. an' somehow it had grown a part of me, I expected him to lead
the others--when he died it seemed like everything was gone . . .
an' then to have you say that I had--" her voice faltered to a
whisper, stopped: with a pathetic gesture she wiped the sleeve of
her old frayed sweater across her eyes and, already ashamed of
her tears, said hastily:</p>

<p>"Not that I'm blamin' you, Mr. Gant. . . . I reckon we were
both at fault . . . we were both to blame . . . if I had it to do
all over I know I could do better . . . but I was so young and
ignorant when I met you, Mr. Gant . . . knew nothing of the world
. . . there was always something strange-like about you that I
didn't understand."</p>

<p>Then, as he said nothing, but lay still and passive, looking
at the ceiling, she said quickly, drying her eyes and speaking
with a brisk and instant cheerfulness, the undaunted optimism of
her ever-hopeful nature:</p>

<p>"Well, now, Mr. Gant, that's all over, and the best thing we
can do is to forget about it. . . . We've both made our
mistakes--we wouldn't be human if we didn't--but now we've got to
profit by experience--the worst of all this trouble is all
over--you've got to think of getting well now, that's the only
thing you've got to do, sir," she said pursing her lips and
winking briskly at him--"just set your mind on getting
well--that's all you've got to do now, Mr. Gant--and the battle
is half won. For half our ills and troubles are all imagination,"
she said sententiously, "and if you'll just make up your mind now
that you're going to get well--why, sir, you'll do it," and she
looked at him with a brisk nod. "And we've both got years before
us, Mr. Gant--for all we know, the best years of our life are
still ahead of us--so we'll both go on and profit by the mistakes
of the past and make the most of what time's left," she said.
"That's just exactly what we'll do!"</p>

<p>And quietly, kindly, without moving, and with the impassive
and limitless regret of a man who knows that there is no return,
he answered:</p>

<p>"Yes, Eliza. That is what we'll do."</p>

<p>"And now," she went on coaxingly, "why don't you go on back to
sleep now, Mr. Gant? There's nothin' like sleep to restore a man
to health--as the feller says, it's Nature's sovereign remedy,
worth all the doctors and all the medicine on earth," she winked
at him, and then concluded on a note of cheerful finality; "so
you go on and get some sleep now, and tomorrow you will feel like
a new man."</p>

<p>And again he shook his head in an almost imperceptible gesture
of negation:</p>

<p>"No," he said, "not now. Can't sleep."</p>

<p>He was silent again, and presently, his breath coming somewhat
hoarse and laboured, he cleared his throat, and put one hand up
to his throat, as if to relieve himself of some impediment.</p>

<p>Eliza looked at him with troubled eyes and said:</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Mr. Gant? There's nothing hurtin'
you?"</p>

<p>"No," he said. "Just something in my throat. Could I have some
water?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes, sir! That's the very thing!" She got up hastily,
and looking about in a somewhat confused manner, saw behind her a
pitcher of water and a glass upon his old walnut bureau, and
saying "This very minute, sir!" started across the room.</p>

<p>And at the same moment, Gant was aware that someone had
entered the house, was coming towards him through the hall, would
soon be with him. Turning his head towards the door he was
conscious of something approaching with the speed of light, the
instancy of thought, and at that moment he was filled with a
sense of inexpressible joy, a feeling of triumph and security he
had never known. Something immensely bright and beautiful was
converging in a flare of light, and at that instant, the whole
room blurred around him, his sight was fixed upon that focal
image in the door, and suddenly the child was standing there and
looking towards him.</p>

<p>And even as he started from his pillows, and tried to call his
wife he felt something thick and heavy in his throat that would
not let him speak. He tried to call to her again but no sound
came, then something wet and warm began to flow out of his mouth
and nostrils, he lifted his hands up to his throat, the warm wet
blood came pouring out across his fingers; he saw it and felt
joy.</p>

<p>For now the child--or someone in the house was speaking,
calling to him; he heard great footsteps, soft but thunderous,
imminent, yet immensely far, a voice well known, never heard
before. He called to it, and then it seemed to answer him; he
called to it with faith and joy to give him rescue, strength, and
life, and it answered him and told him that all the error, old
age, pain and grief of life were nothing but an evil dream; that
he who had been lost was found again, that his youth would be
restored to him and that he would never die, and that he would
find again the path he had not taken long ago in a dark wood.</p>

<p>And the child still smiled at him from the dark door; the
great steps, soft and powerful, came ever closer, and as the
instant imminent approach of that last meeting came intolerably
near, he cried out through the lake of jetting blood, "Here,
Father, here!" and heard a strong voice answer him, "My son!"</p>

<p>At that instant he was torn by a rending cough, something was
wrenched loose in him, the death-gasp rattled through his blood,
and a mass of greenish matter foamed out through his lips. Then
the world was blotted out, a blind black fog swam up and closed
above his head, someone seized him, he was held, supported in two
arms, he heard someone's voice saying in a low tone of terror and
of pity, "Mr. Gant! Mr. Gant! Oh, poor man, poor man! He's gone!"
And his brain faded into night. Even before she lowered him back
upon the pillows, she knew that he was dead.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Eliza's sharp scream brought three of her children--Daisy,
Steve, and Luke, and the nurse, Bessie Gant, who was the wife of
Gant's nephew Ollie--running from the kitchen. At the same moment
Helen, who had taken an hour's sleep--her first in two days--in
the little hall-bedroom off the porch, was wakened by her
mother's cry, the sound of a screen-door slammed, and the sound
of footsteps running past her window on the porch. Then, for
several minutes she had no consciousness of what she did, and
later she could not remember it. Her actions were those of a
person driven by a desperate force, who acts from blind
intuition, not from reason. Instantly, the moment that she heard
her mother scream, the slam of the screen-door, and the running
feet, she knew what had happened, and from that moment she knew
only one frenzied desire; somehow to get to her father before he
died.</p>

<p>The breath caught hoarse and sharp in her throat in a kind of
nervous sob, it seemed that her heart had stopped beating and
that her whole life-force was paralyzed; but she was out of her
bed with a movement that left the old springs rattling, and she
came across the back-porch with a kind of tornado-like speed that
just came instantly from nowhere: in a moment she was standing in
the open door with the sudden bolted look of a person who had
been shot through the heart, staring at the silent group of
people, and at the figure on the bed, with a dull strained stare
of disbelief and horror.</p>

<p>All the time, although she was not conscious of it, her breath
kept coming in a kind of hoarse short sob, her large big-boned
face had an almost animal look of anguish and surprise, her mouth
was partly open, her large chin hung down, and at this moment, as
they turned towards her she began to moan, "Oh-h, oh-h, oh-h,
oh-h!" in the same unconscious way, like a person who has
received a heavy blow in the pit of the stomach. Then her mouth
gaped open, a hoarse and ugly cry was torn from her throat--a cry
not of grief but loss--and she rushed forward like a mad woman.
They tried to stop her, to restrain her, she flung them away as
if they had been rag dolls and hurled herself down across the
body on the bed, raving like a maniac.</p>

<p>"Oh, Papa, Papa. . . . Why didn't they tell me? . . . Why
didn't they let me know? . . . Why didn't they call me? . . . Oh,
Papa, Papa, Papa! . . . dead, dead, dead . . . and they didn't
tell me . . . they didn't let me know . . . they let you die . .
. and I wasn't here! . . . I wasn't here!"--and she wept harshly,
horribly, bitterly, rocking back and forth like a mad woman, with
a dead man in her arms. She kept moaning, ". . . They didn't tell
me . . . they let you die without me . . . I wasn't here . . . I
wasn't here . . ."</p>

<p>And even when they lifted her up from the bed, detached her
arms from the body they had held in such a desperate hug, she
still kept moaning in a demented manner, as if talking to the
corpse, and oblivious of the presence of these living people:</p>

<p>"They never told me . . . they never told me. . . . They let
you die here all by yourself . . . and I wasn't here . . . I
wasn't here."</p>

<p>All of the women, except Bessie Gant, had now begun to weep
hysterically, more from shock, exhaustion, and the nervous strain
than from grief, and now Bessie Gant's voice could be heard
speaking to them sharply, coldly, peremptorily, as she tried to
bring back order and calmness to the distracted scene:</p>

<p>"Now, you get out of here--all of you! . . . There's nothing
more any of you can do--I'll take care of all the rest of it! . .
. Get out, now . . . I can't have you in the room while there's
work to do. . . . Helen, go on back to bed and get some sleep. .
. . You'll feel better in the morning."</p>

<p>"They never told me! . . . They never told me," she turned and
stared stupidly at Bessie Gant with dull glazed eyes. "Can't you
do something? . . . Where's MacGuire? Has anyone called him
yet?"</p>

<p>"No," said the nurse sharply and angrily, "and no one's going
to. You're not going to get that man out of bed at this hour of
the night when there's nothing to be done. . . . Get out of here,
now, all of you," she began to push and herd them towards the
door. "I can't be bothered with you. . . . Go
somewhere--anywhere--get drunk--only don't come back in
here."</p>

<p>The whole house had come to life; in the excitement, shock,
and exhaustion of their nerves the dead man still lying there in
such a grotesque and twisted position, was forgotten. One of
Eliza's lodgers, a man named Gilmer, who had been in the house
for years, was wakened, went out, and got a gallon of corn
whisky; everyone drank a great deal, became, in fact, somewhat
intoxicated; when the undertakers came to take Gant away, none of
the family was present. No one saw it. They were all in the
kitchen seated around Eliza's battered old kitchen table, with
the jug of whisky on the table before them. They drank and talked
together all night long until dawn came.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>The morning of Gant's funeral the house was filled with people
who had known him and the air was heavy with the sweet, cloying
fragrance of the funeral flowers: the odours of lilies, roses,
and carnations. His coffin was banked with flowers, but in the
centre there was a curious and arresting plainness, a simple
wreath of laurel leaves. Attached to the wreath was a small card
on which these words were written: "Hugh McGuire."</p>

<p>And people passing by the coffin paused for a moment and
stared at the name with a feeling of unspoken wonder in their
hearts. Eliza stood looking at the wreath a moment with hands
clasped across her waist, and then turned away, shaking her head
rapidly, with a short convulsive pucker of her lips, as she spoke
to Helen in a low voice:</p>

<p>"I tell you what--it's pretty strange when you come to think
of it--it gives you a queer feeling--I tell you what, it
does."</p>

<p>And this expressed the emotion that everyone felt when they
saw the wreath. For Hugh McGuire had been found dead at his desk
at six o'clock that morning, the news had just spread through the
town, and now, when people saw the wreath upon Gant's coffin,
there was something in their hearts they could not utter.</p>

<p>Gant lay in the splendid coffin, with his great hands folded
quietly on his breast. Later, the boy could not forget his
father's hands. They were the largest, most powerful, and somehow
the most shapely hands he had ever seen. And even though his
great right hand had been so crippled and stiffened by an attack
of inflammatory rheumatism ten years before that he had never
regained the full use of it, and since that time could only hold
the great wooden mallet that the stone-cutters use in a painful
and clumsy half-clasp between the thumb and the big stiffened
fingers, his hands had never lost their character of life,
strength, and powerful shapeliness.</p>

<p>The hands had given to the interminable protraction of his
living death a kind of concrete horror that it otherwise would
not have had. For as his powerful gaunt figure waned and wasted
under the ravages of the cancer that was consuming him until he
had become only the enfeebled shadow of his former self, his
gaunt hands, on which there was so little which death could
consume, lost none of their former rock-like heaviness, strength
and shapely power. Thus, even when the giant figure of the man
had become nothing but a spectral remnant of itself, sunk in a
sorrow of time, awaiting death, those great, still-living hands
of power and strength hung incredibly, horribly, from that
spectral form of death to which they were attached.</p>

<p>And for this reason those powerful hands of life evoked, as
nothing else could have done, in an instant searing flash of
memory and recognition the lost world of his father's life of
manual power, hunger, fury, savage abundance and wild joy, the
whole enchanted structure of that lost life of magic he had made
for them. Constantly, those great hands of life joined, with an
almost grotesque incongruity, to that scarecrow form of wasting
death would awake for them, as nothing else on earth could do,
all of the sorrowful ghosts of time, the dream-like spell and
terror of the years between, the years of phantom death, the
horror of unreality, strangeness, disbelief, and memory, that
haunted them.</p>

<p>So was it now, even in death, with his father's hands. In
their powerful, gaunt and shapely clasp, as he lay dead in his
coffin, there seemed to be held and gathered, somehow, all of his
life that could never die--a living image of the essential
quality of his whole life with its fury and unrest, desire and
hunger, the tremendous sweep and relish of its enormous appetites
and the huge endowment of its physical and sensual powers.</p>

<p>Thus, one could suppose that on the face of a dead poet there
might remain--how, where or in what way we could not tell, a kind
of flame, a light, a glory,--the magic and still living chrysm of
his genius. And on the face of the dead conqueror we might still
see living, arrogant, and proud with all its dark authorities the
frown of power, the inflexible tyranny of stern command, the
special infinitude of the invincible will that would not die with
life, and that incredibly remains, still dark and living in its
scorn and mockery of time.</p>

<p>Then, on the face of an old dead prophet or philosopher there
would live and would not die the immortality of proud, lonely
thought. We could not say just where that spirit rested.
Sometimes it would seem to rest upon the temples of the grand and
lonely head. Sometimes we would think it was a kind of darkness
in the shadows of the closed and sunken eyes, sometimes the marsh
fire of a dark and lambent flame that hovered round the face,
that could never be fixed, but that we always knew was there.</p>

<p>And just as poet, prophet, priest and conqueror might each
retain in death some living and fitting image of his whole life's
truth, so would the strength, the skill, all of the hope, hunger,
fury, and unrest that had lashed and driven on through life the
gaunt figure of a stone-cutter be marvellously preserved in the
granite power and symmetry of those undying hands.</p>

<p>Now the corpse was stretched out on the splendid satin
cushions of the expensive coffin. It had been barbered, powdered,
disembowelled, and pumped full of embalming fluid. As it lay
there with its waxen head set forward in its curious gaunt
projectiveness, the pale lips firmly closed and with a little
line of waxen mucus in the lips, the women came forward with
their oily swollen faces, and a look of ravenous eagerness in
their eyes, stared at it hard and long, lifted their sodden
handkerchiefs slowly to their oily mouths, and were borne away,
sobbing hysterically, by their equally oily, ravenous, sister
orgiasts in sorrow.</p>

<p>Meanwhile his father's friends, the stone-cutters, masons,
building contractors, butchers, business men and male relatives
were standing awkwardly about, dressed in their good, black
clothes which they seemed not to wear so much as to inhabit with
a kind of unrestful itchiness, lowering their eyes gravely and
regretfully as the women put on their revolting show, talking
together in low voices, and wondering when it would all be
over.</p>

<p>These circumstances, together with the heavy unnatural languor
of the funeral smells, the sweet-sick heaviness of the
carnations, the funereal weepy blacks in which the women had
arrayed themselves, the satiny sandalwood scent that came from
the splendid coffin, and the fragrant faintly acrid odour of
embalmed flesh, particularly when blended with the smell of
cooking turnip greens, roast pork and apple sauce out in the
kitchen, combined to create an atmosphere somewhat like a dinner
in a comfortably furnished morgue.</p>

<p>In all this obscene pomp of burial there was something so
grotesque, unnatural, disgusting, and remote from all he could
remember of the dead man's life and personality that everything
about him--even the physical horror of his bloody death--now
seemed so far away he could hardly believe it ever happened.
Therefore, he stared at this waxen and eviscerated relic in the
coffin with a sense of weird disbelief, unable to relate it to
the living man who had bled great lakes of blood the night
before.</p>

<p>Yet, even in his death, his father's hands still seemed to
live, and would not die. And this was the reason why the memory
of those hands haunted him then and would haunt him for ever
after. This was the reason why, when he would try to remember how
he looked when dead, he could remember nothing clearly except the
powerful sculptured weight and symmetry of his tremendous hands
as they lay folded on his body in the coffin. The great hands had
a stony, sculptured and yet living strength and vitality, as if
Michelangelo had carved them. They seemed to rest there upon the
groomed, bereft and vacant horror of the corpse with a kind of
terrible reality as if there really is, in death, some energy of
life that will not die, some element of man's life that must
persist and that resumes into a single feature of his life the
core and essence of his character.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Starwick had now become his best and closest friend. Suddenly,
it occurred to him with a strange and bitter sense of loss and
lack that Starwick was the only friend of his own age that he had
ever known to whom he had fully and passionately revealed his own
life, of whose fellowship and comradeship he had never grown
weary. Friends he had had--friends in the casual and indifferent
sense in which most friendship is understood--but until now he
had never held a friend like Starwick in his heart's core.</p>

<p>Why was it? What was this grievous lack or loss--if lack or
loss it was--in his own life? Why was it that, with his fierce,
bitter, and insatiate hunger for life, his quenchless thirst for
warmth, joy, love, and fellowship, his constant image, which had
blazed in his heart since childhood, of the enchanted city of the
great comrades and the glorious women, that he grew weary of
people almost as soon as he met them? Why was it that he seemed
to squeeze their lives dry of any warmth and interest they might
have for him as one might squeeze an orange, and then was
immediately filled with boredom, disgust, dreary tedium, and an
impatient weariness and desire to escape so agonizing that it
turned his feeling almost into hatred?</p>

<p>Why was it that his spirit was now filled with this furious
unrest and exasperation against people because none of them
seemed as good as they should be? Where did it come from--this
improvable and yet unshakable conviction that grew stronger with
every rebuff and disappointment--that the enchanted world was
here around us ready to our hand the moment that we chose to take
it for our own, and that the impossible magic in life of which he
dreamed, for which he thirsted, had been denied us not because it
was a phantom of desire, but because men had been too base and
weak to take what was their own?</p>

<p>Now, with Starwick, and for the first time, he felt this magic
constantly--this realization of a life for ever good, for ever
warm and beautiful, for ever flashing with the fires of passion,
poetry and joy, for ever filled with the swelling and triumphant
confidence of youth, its belief in new lands, morning, and a
shining city, its hope of voyages, its conviction of a fortunate,
good and happy life--an imperishable happiness and joy--that was
impending, that would be here at any moment.</p>

<p>For a moment he looked at the strange and delicate face of the
young man beside him, reflecting, with a sense of wonder, at his
communion with this other life, so different from his own in kind
and temper. What was it? Was it the sharp mind, that original and
penetrating instrument which picked up the old and weary problems
of the spirit by new handles, displaying without labour planes
and facets rarely seen? With what fierce joy he welcomed those
long walks together in the night, along the quiet streets of
Cambridge, or by the marvellous river that wound away small and
magical in the blazing moonlight into the sweet, dark
countryside! What other pleasure, what other appeasement of his
mind and sense had been so complete and wonderful as that which
came from this association as, oblivious of the world, they
carried on their fierce debate about all things under heaven; his
own voice, passionate, torrential, and wild, crying out against
the earth, the moon, invoking all the gods of verse and magic
while his mind played rivers of lightning across the vast fields
of reading and experience!</p>

<p>And how eagerly he waited for the answers of that other voice,
quiet, weary, drawling--how angrily he stormed against its
objections, how hungrily and gratefully he fed upon its
agreement! What other tongue had had the power to touch his pride
and his senses as this one had--how cruelly had its disdain
wounded him, how magnificently had its praise filled his heart
with glory! On these nights when he and Starwick had walked along
the river in these vehement, passionate, and yet affectionate
debates, he would relive the scene for hours after it had ended,
going over their discussion again and again, remembering every
gesture, every intonation of the voice, every flash of life and
passion in the face. Late in the night he would pace up and down
his room, or pause dreaming by his window, still carrying on in
his mind the debate with his friend, inventing and regretting
splendid things he might have said, exulting in those he had said
and in every word of approval or burst of laughter he had
provoked. And he would think: Ah, but I was <i>good</i> there! I
could see how he admired me, how high a place I have in his
affection. For when he says a thing he <i>means</i> it: he called
me a poet, his voice was quiet and full of passion; he said my
like had never been, that my destiny was great and sure.</p>

<p>Was this, then, the answer?</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Until this period of his life he had drunk very little: in
spite of the desperate fear his mother had that each of her
children inherited the whisky disease--"the curse of liquor," as
she called it--from their father, he felt no burning appetite for
stimulant. Alone, he never sought it out, he never bought a
bottle for himself: solitary as his life had become, the idea of
solitary drinking, of stealthy alley potations from a flask,
filled him with sodden horror.</p>

<p>Now, in the company of Starwick, he was drinking more
frequently than he had ever done before. Alcohol, indeed, until
his twentieth year had been only a casual and infrequent
spirit--once, in his seventeenth year, when he had come home from
college at the Christmas vacation, he had got very drunk on
various liquors which his brother Luke had brought home to his
father, and which he had mixed together in a tumbler and drunk
without discretion. And there had been one or two casual sprees
during his years at college, but until this time he had never
known the experience of frequent intoxication.</p>

<p>But now, in the company of Frank Starwick, he went every week
or so to a little restaurant which was situated in the Italian
district of the eastern quarter of town, beyond Scollay Square
and across Washington Street. The place was Starwick's own
discovery, he hoarded his knowledge of it with stern secrecy,
yielding it up only to a few friends--a few rare and
understanding spirits who would not coarsely abuse the old-world
spirit of this priceless place, because, he said:</p>

<p>"It would be a pity if it ever got known about. It really
would, you know. . . . I mean, the kind of people who would begin
to go there would ruin it. . . . They really would. . . . I mean,
it's <i>quite</i> astonishing to find a place of that sort here
in Boston."</p>

<p>It was the beginning of that dark time of blood, and crime,
and terror which the years of prohibition brought and which was
to leave its hideous mutilation not only upon the soul and
conscience of the nation, but upon the lives of millions of
people--particularly the young everywhere. At this time, however,
the ugly, jeering, open arrogance of the later period--the foul
smell of privilege and corruption, the smirk of protection, and
the gangster's sneer, were not so evident as they became in the
years that followed. At this time, it was by no means easy "to
get a drink": the speak-easy had already started on its historic
career, but was still more or less what its name suggested--a
place to be got at quietly and by stealth, a place of low voices,
furtive and suspicious eyes, and elaborate precautions.</p>

<p>The place which Starwick had "discovered," and which he
hoarded with such precious secrecy, was a small Italian
restaurant known as Posillippo's, which occupied the second floor
of an old brick building in an obscure street of the Italian
quarter. Frank pronounced the name strongly and
lovingly--"Pothillippo's"--in the mannered voice, and with the
affected accent which all foreign and exotic names--particularly
those that had a Latin flavouring--inspired in him.</p>

<p>Arrived at "Pothillippo's," Frank, who even at this time did
all things with the most lavish and lordly extravagance, and who
tipped generously at every opportunity, would be welcomed
obsequiously by the proprietor and the waiters, and then would
order with an air of the most refined and sensual discrimination
from his favourite waiter, a suave and fawning servitor named
Nino. There were other waiters just as good as Nino, but Frank
expressed an overwhelming preference for him above all others
because, he said, Nino had the same face as one of the saints in
a painting by Giotto, and because he professed to find all of the
ancient, grave and exquisite rhythm of the ancient Tuscan
nobility composed in the one figure of this waiter.</p>

<p>"But have you noticed the way he uses his hands while
talking?" Frank would say in a tone of high impassioned
earnestness.--"Did you notice that last gesture? It is the same
gesture that you find in the figure of the disciple Thomas in
Leonardo's painting of 'The Last Supper.' It really is, you know.
. . . Christ!" he would cry, in his high, strange, and rather
womanish tone. "The centuries of art, of living, of culture--the
terrific knowledge <i>all</i> these people have--the kind of
thing you'll never find in people in this country, the kind of
thing that no amount of college education or books can give
you--all expressed in a single gesture of the hands of this
Italian waiter. . . . The whole thing's <i>quite</i> astonishing,
it really is, you know."</p>

<p>The real reason, however, that Frank preferred Nino to all the
other waiters in "Pothillippo's" establishment was that he liked
the sound of the word "Nino" and pronounced it beautifully.</p>

<p>"Nino!" Frank would cry, in a high, strange, and rather
womanish voice--"Nino!"</p>

<p>"S&igrave;, signor," Nino would breathe unctuously, and would
then stand in an attitude of heavy and prayerful adoration,
awaiting the young lord's next commands.</p>

<p>"Nino," Frank would then go on in the tone and manner of a
sensuous and weary old-world sophisticate. "Quel vin avez-vous? .
. . Quel vin--rouge--du--tr&egrave;s--bon. Vous--comprenez?" said
Frank, using up in one speech most of his French words, but
giving a wonderful sense of linguistic mastery and complete
eloquence in two languages.</p>

<p>"Mais si, signer!" Nino would answer immediately, skilfully
buttering Frank on both sides--the French and the Italian--with
three masterly words.</p>

<p>"Le Chianti est <i>tr&egrave;s, tr&egrave;s</i> bon! . . .
C'est parfait, monsieur," he whispered, with a little ecstatic
movement of his fingers. "Admirable!"</p>

<p>"Bon," said Frank with an air of quiet decision. "Alors,
Nino," he continued, raising his voice as he pronounced these two
words, which were among his favourites. "Alors, une bouteille du
Chianti--n'est-ce pas--"</p>

<p>"Mais si, signor!" said Nino, nodding enthusiastically.
"Si--et pour manger?" he went on coaxingly.</p>

<p>"Pour manger?" Frank began--"Ecoute, Nino--vous pouvez
recommander quelque chose--quelque chose
<i>d'extraordinaire!"</i> Frank cried in a high impassioned tone.
"Quelque chose de la <i>maison!"</i> he concluded
triumphantly.</p>

<p>"Mais si!" Nino cried enthusiastically. "S&igrave;, signor. .
. . Permettez-moi! . . . Le spaghetti," he whispered seductively,
rolling his dark eyes rapturously aloft, and making a little
mincing movement, indicative of speechless ecstasy, of his thumb
and forefinger. "Le spaghetti . . . de la . . . maison . . . ah,
signor," Nino breathed--"le spaghetti avec la sauce de la maison
est merveilleux . . . merveilleux!" he whispered.</p>

<p>"Bon," said Starwick nodding. "Alors, Nino--le spaghetti pour
deux--vous comprenez?"</p>

<p>"Mais si, signor! Si," Nino breathed. "Parfaitement"--and
wrote the miraculous order on his order pad. "Et puis, monsieur,"
said Nino coaxingly, and with complete humility. "Permettez-moi
de recommander--le poulet," he whispered rapturously--"le poulet
r&ocirc;ti," he breathed, as if unveiling the rarest secrets of
cookery that had been revealed since the days of Epicurus--"le
poulet r&ocirc;ti . . . de la maison," again he made the little
speechless movement of the finger and the thumb, and rolled his
rapturous eyes around--"ah, signor," said Nino, "Vous n'aurez pas
de regrets si vous commandez le poulet."</p>

<p>"Bon. . . . Bon," said Starwick quietly and profoundly.
"Alors, Nino--deux poulets r&ocirc;tis, pour moi et pour
monsieur," he commanded.</p>

<p>"Bon, bon," said Nino, nodding vigorously and writing with
enthusiasm--"et pour la salade, messieurs," he paused--looking
inquiringly and yet hopefully at both his lordly young
patrons.</p>

<p>And so it went, until the menu had all been gone through in
mangled French and monosyllabic Italian. When this great ceremony
was over, Frank Starwick had done nothing more nor less than
order the one-dollar table-d'h&ocirc;te dinner which Signor
"Pothillippo" provided for all the patrons of his establishment
and whose order--soup, fish, spaghetti, roasted chicken, salad,
ice-cream, cheese, nuts and bitter coffee--was unchangeable as
destiny, and not to be altered by the whims of common men,
whether they would or no.</p>

<p>And yet Frank's manner of ordering his commonplace rather
dreary meal was so touched by mystery, strangeness, an air of
priceless rarity and sensual refinement, that one would smack his
lips over the various dishes with a gourmandizing gusto, as if
the art of some famous chef had really been exhausted in their
preparation.</p>

<p>And this element of Frank Starwick's character was one of the
finest and most attractive things about him. It was, perhaps as
much as anything else, the reason why people of all kinds were
drawn to him, delighted to be with him, and why Frank could
command the boundless affection, devotion, and support of people
more than anyone the other boy had ever known.</p>

<p>For, in spite of all Frank's affectations of tone, manner,
gesture, and accent, in spite of the elaborately mannered style
of his whole life--no! really <i>because</i> of them (for what
were all these manners and affectations except the evidence of
Frank's constant effort to give qualities of strangeness,
mystery, rareness, joy and pleasure to common things that had
none of these qualities in themselves?)--the deep and passionate
desire in Frank's spirit to find a life that would always be
good, beautiful, and exciting was apparent.</p>

<p>And to an amazing degree, Frank Starwick succeeded in
investing all the common and familiar acts and experiences of
this world with this strange and romantic colour of his own
personality.</p>

<p>When one was with him, everything--"le Chianti de la maison,"
a cigarette, the performance of a play, a poem or a book, a walk
across the Harvard Yard, or along the banks of the Charles
River--became strange and rare and memorable, and for this reason
Frank, in spite of the corrupt and rotten spot which would
develop in his character and eventually destroy him, was one of
the rarest and highest people that ever lived, and could never be
forgotten by anyone who had ever known him and been his
friend.</p>

<p>For, by a baffling paradox, these very affectations of Frank's
speech and dress and carriage, the whole wrought manner of his
life, which caused many people who disbelieved him to dismiss him
bitterly as an affected and artificial poseur, really came from
something innocent and na&iuml;ve and good in Frank's
character--something as innocent and familiar as the affectations
of Tom Sawyer when he told tall stories, invented wild,
complicated, and romantic schemes, when none was necessary, or
used big words to impress his friends, the nigger Jim, or
Huckleberry Finn.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Thus, the two young men would stay in "Pothillippo's" until
late at night when the place closed, drinking that wonderful
"Chianti de la maison," so preciously and lovingly described,
which was really nothing but "dago red," raw, new, and
instantaneous in its intoxication, filled with headaches and
depression for to-morrow morning, but filled now with the mild,
soaring, jubilant and triumphant drunkenness that only youth can
know.</p>

<p>And they would leave this place of Latin mystery and languor
at one o'clock in the morning, Frank shouting in a high drunken
voice before he left, "Nino! Nino!--Il faut quelque chose
&agrave; boire avant de partir--Nino!--Nino!--Encora!
Encora!"--pronouncing his last Italian word victoriously.</p>

<p>"Mais si, signor," Nino would answer, smiling somewhat
anxiously. "Du vin?"</p>

<p>"Mais non, mais non, Nino" Frank would cry violently. "Pas de
vin--du wis-kee, Nino! Du wis-kee!"</p>

<p>Then they would gulp down drinks of the raw and powerful
beverage to which the name of whisky had been given in that era,
and leaving a dim blur of lights, a few dim blots of swarthy,
anxiously smiling faces behind them, they would reel dangerously
down the rickety stairs and out into the narrow, twisted streets,
the old grimed web of sleeping quietness, the bewildering,
ancient, and whited streets of Boston.</p>

<p>Above them, in the cool sweet skies of night, the great moons
of the springtime, and New England, blazed with a bare, a lovely
and enchanted radiance. And around them the great city and its
thousand narrow twisted streets lay anciently asleep beneath that
blazing moon, and from the harbour came the sound of ships, the
wasting, fresh, half-rotten harbour-smells, filled with the
thought of ships, the sea, the proud exultancy of voyages. And
out of the cobbled streets and from the old grimed
buildings--yes! from the very breast and bareness of that
springtime moon and those lovely lilac skies, there came
somehow--God knows how--all of the sweet wildness of New England
in the month of May, the smell of the earth, the sudden green,
the glorious blossoms--all that was wild, sweet, strange, simple,
instantly familiar--that impossible loveliness, that irresistible
magic, that unutterable hope for the magic that could not be
spoken, but that seemed almost in the instant to be seized,
grasped, and made one's own for ever--for the hunger, possession
and fulfilment--and for God knows what--for that magic land of
green, its white and lovely houses, and the white flesh, the
moon-dark hair, the depthless eyes and everlasting silence of its
secret, dark, and lavish women.</p>

<p>Dark Helen in our hearts for ever burning--oh, no more!</p>

<p>Then the two young men would thread that maze of drunken
moonlit streets, and feel the animate and living silence of the
great city all around them, and look then at the moon with
drunken eyes, and see the moon, all bare and drunken in the
skies, the whole earth and the ancient city drunk with joy and
sleep and springtime and the enchanted silences of the moon-drunk
squares. And they would come at length to Cambridge, to find the
moonlight dark upon the sleeping silence of the university and
Harvard Square, and exultancy and joy welled up in them for ever;
wild shouts and songs and laughter were torn from their throats
and rang out through the sleeping streets of Cambridge, filling
the moon-sweet air with jubilation, for they were drunken, young,
and twenty--immortal confidence and victorious strength possessed
them--and they knew that they could never die.</p>

<p>Immortal drunkenness! What tribute can we ever pay, what song
can we ever sing, what swelling praise can ever be sufficient to
express the joy, the gratefulness, and the love which we, who
have known youth and hunger in America, have owed to alcohol?</p>

<p>We are so lost, so lonely, so forsaken in America: immense and
savage skies bend over us, and we have no door.</p>

<p>But you, immortal drunkenness, came to us in our youth when
all our hearts were sick with hopelessness, our spirits maddened
with unknown terrors, and our heads bowed down with nameless
shame. You came to us victoriously, to possess us, and to fill
our lives with your wild music, to make the goat-cry burst from
our exultant throats, to make us know that here upon the
wilderness, the savage land, that here beneath immense, inhuman
skies of time, in all the desolation of the cities, the grey
unceasing flood-tides of the man-swarm, our youth would soar to
fortune, fame, and love, our spirits quicken with the power of
mighty poetry, our work go on triumphantly to fulfilment until
our lives prevailed.</p>

<p>What does it matter, then, if since that time of your first
coming, magic drunkenness, our head has grown bald, our young
limbs heavy, and if our flesh has lain battered, bleeding in the
stews?</p>

<p>You came to us with music, poetry, and wild joy when we were
twenty, when we reeled home at night through the old
moon-whitened streets of Boston and heard our friend, our
comrade, and our dead companion shout through the silence of the
moon-white square: "You are a poet and the world is yours."</p>

<p>And victory, joy, wild hope, and swelling certitude and
tenderness surged through the conduits of our blood as we heard
that drunken cry, and triumph, glory, proud belief were resting
like a chrysm around us as we heard that cry, and turned our eyes
then to the moon-drunk skies of Boston, knowing only that we were
young, and drunk, and twenty, and that the power of mighty poetry
was within us, and the glory of the great earth lay before
us--because we were young and drunk and twenty, and could never
die!</p>

<h1>XXXVI</h1>

<p> </p>

<p>When Oswald Ten Ecyk left his $8000 job on the Hearst
Syndicate and came to Cambridge to enroll in Professor Hatcher's
celebrated course for dramatists, he had saved a sum rare in the
annals of journalism--$700. When he got through paying the
tuition, admission, and other accessory fees that would entitle
him to a membership in good standing in the graduate school of
the university, something less than $500 remained. Oswald got an
attic room in Cambridge, in a square, smut-grey frame-house which
was the home of an Irish family named Grogan. To reach his room,
he had to mount a rickety flight of stairs that was almost as
steep as a ladder, and when he got there, he had to manage his
five feet five of fragile stature carefully in order to keep from
cracking his head upon the sloping white-washed walls that
followed the steep pitch of the roof with painful fidelity. The
central part of Oswald's room, which was the only place in which
the little man could stand erect, was not over four feet wide:
there was a single window at the front where stood his writing
table. He had a couple of straight chairs, a white iron cot
pushed in under the eave of the left side, a few bookshelves
pushed in under the eave of the right. It could literally be said
that the playwright crawled to bed, and when he read he had to
approach the poets as a poet should--upon his knees.</p>

<p>For this austere cell, Professor Hatcher's dramatist paid Mrs.
Mary Grogan fifteen dollars every month. Therefore, when the
primary fees of tuition and matriculation and the cell in Mrs.
Grogan's house had been accounted for, Oswald Ten Eyck had all of
$300 left to take care of clothing, food, tobacco, books, and
plays during the ensuing period of nine months. This sum perhaps
was adequate, but it was not grand, and Ten Eyck, poet though he
was, was subject to all those base cravings of sensual desire
that 100 pounds of five feet five is heir to.</p>

<p>This weakness of the flesh was unhappily reflected in the
artist's work. During the brief period of his sojourn in
Professor Hatcher's class, his plays were numerous but for the
most part low. Ten Eyck turned them out with the feverish haste
which only a trained newspaper-man can achieve when driven on by
the cherished ambition of a lifetime and the knowledge that art
is long and $300 very fleeting. He had started out most
promisingly in the fleshless ethers of mystic fantasy, but he
became progressively more sensual until at the end he was
practically wallowing in a trough of gluttony.</p>

<p>The man, in fact, became all belly when he wrote--and this was
strange in a frail creature with the large burning eyes of a
religious zealot, hands small-boned, fleshless as a claw, and a
waist a rubber band would have snapped round comfortably. He
seemed compact of flame and air and passion and an agonizing
shyness. Professor Hatcher had great hopes for him--the whole
atom was framed, Professor Hatcher thought, for what the true
Hatcherian called "the drama of revolt," but the flaming atom
fooled him, fooled him cruelly. For after the brilliant promise
of that first beginning--a delicate, over-the-hills-and-far-away
fantasy reminiscent of Synge, Yeats, and the Celtic Dawn--brain
bowed to belly, Ten Eyck wrote of food.</p>

<p>His second effort was a one-act play whose action took place
on the sidewalk in front of a Childs restaurant, while a
white-jacketed attendant deftly flipped brown wheat-cakes on a
plate. The principal character, and in fact the only speaker in
this play, was a starving poet who stood before the window and
delivered himself of a twenty-minute monologue on a poet's life
and the decay of modern society, in the course of which most of
the staple victuals on the Childs menu were mentioned frequently
and with bitter relish.</p>

<p>Professor Hatcher felt his interest waning: he had hoped for
finer things. Yet a wise caution learned from errors in the past
had taught him to forbear. He knew that out of man's coarse earth
the finer flowers of his spirit sometimes grew. Some earlier
members of his class had taught him this, some who had written
coarsely of coarse things. They wrote of sailors, niggers, thugs,
and prostitutes, of sunless lives and evil strivings, of murder,
hunger, rape, and incest, a black picture of man's life unlighted
by a spark of grace, a ray of hope, a flicker of the higher
vision. Professor Hatcher had not always asked them to return--to
"come back for a second year," which was the real test of success
and future promise in the Hatcherian world. And yet, unknighted
by this accolade, some had gone forth and won renown: their grim
plays had been put on everywhere and in all languages. And the
only claim the true Hatcherian could make of them was: "Yes, they
were with us but not of us: they were not asked to come back for
a second year."</p>

<p>There were some painful memories, but Professor Hatcher had
derived from them a wise forbearance. His hopes for Oswald Ten
Eyck were fading fast, but he had determined to hold his judgment
in abeyance until Oswald's final play. But, as if to relieve his
distinguished tutor from a painful choice, Ten Eyck himself
decided it. After his third play there was no longer any doubt of
the decision. For that play, which Oswald called "Dutch Fugue,"
would more aptly have been entitled "No Return."</p>

<p>It was a piece in four acts dealing with the quaintly
flavoured life and customs of his own people, the Hudson River
Dutch. The little man was hotly proud of his ancestry, and always
insisted with a slight sneer of aristocratic contempt: "Not the
Pennsylvania Dutch--Good God, no! <i>They're</i> not Dutch but
German: the <i>real</i> Dutch, the <i>old</i> Dutch,
<i>Catskill</i> Dutch!" And if Ten Eyck's interest in food had
been uncomfortably pronounced in his earlier work, in this final
product of his curious genius, his sensual appetites became
indecent in their unrestraint. It is doubtful if the long and
varied annals of the stage have ever offered such a spectacle:
the play became a sort of dramatic incarnation of the belly,
acted by a cast of fourteen adults, male and female, all of whom
were hearty eaters.</p>

<p>The central events of that extraordinary play, which were a
birth, a death, a wedding, were all attended by eating, drinking,
and the noises of the feast. Scene followed scene with
kaleidoscopic swiftness: the jubilant merry-making of the
christening had hardly died away before the stage was set, the
trestles groaning, with the more sombre, sober and substantial
victuals of the funeral; and the wheels of the hearse had hardly
echoed away into the distance before the scene burst out in all
the boisterous reel and rout and feasting of the wedding banquet.
Of no play that was ever written could it be more aptly said that
"the funeral baked meats did coldly furnish forth the marriage
tables," and what is more, they almost furnished forth the casket
and the corpse as well. Finally, the curtain fell as it had
risen, upon a groaning table surrounded by the assembled cast of
fourteen famished gluttons--a scene in which apparently the only
sound and action were provided by the thrust of jowl and smack of
lip, a kind of symphonic gluttony of reach and grab, cadenced by
the stertorous breathing of the eaters, the clash of crockery,
and the sanguinary drip of rare roast beef--the whole a prophetic
augury that flesh was grass and man's days fleeting, that life
would change and reappear in an infinite succession of births and
deaths and marriages, but that the holy rites of eating and the
divine permanence of good dinners and roast beef were
indestructible and would endure for ever.</p>

<p>Ten Eyck read the play himself one Friday afternoon to
Professor Hatcher and his assembled following. He read in a rapid
high-pitched voice, turning the pages with a trembling claw, and
thrusting his long fingers nervously through his disordered mop
of jet-black hair. As he went on, the polite attention of the
class was changed insensibly to a paralysis of stupefaction.
Professor Hatcher's firm thin lips became much firmer, thinner,
tighter. A faint but bitter smile was printed at the edges of his
mouth. Then, for a moment, when the playwright finished, there
was silence: Professor Hatcher slowly raised his hand, detached
his gold-rimmed glasses from his distinguished nose, and let them
fall and dangle on their black silk cord. He looked around the
class; his cultivated voice was low, controlled, and very
quiet.</p>

<p>"Is there any comment?" Professor Hatcher said.</p>

<p>No one answered for a moment. Then Mr. Grey, a young patrician
from Philadelphia, spoke:</p>

<p>"I think," he said with a quiet emphasis of scorn, "I think he
might very well get it produced in the Chicago Stock Yards."</p>

<p>Mr. Grey's remark was ill-timed. For the Stock Yards brought
to Ten Eyck's mind a thought of beef, and beef brought back a
memory of his palmy days with Mr. Hearst when beef was plenty and
the pay-cheques fat, and all these thoughts brought back the
bitter memory of the day before which was the day when he had
eaten last: a single meal, a chaste and wholesome dinner of
spaghetti, spinach, coffee, and a roll. And thinking, Ten Eyck
craned his scrawny neck convulsively along the edges of his
fraying collar, looked desperately at Professor Hatcher, who
returned his gaze inquiringly; ducked his head quickly, bit his
nails and craned again. Then, suddenly, seeing the cold patrician
features of young Mr. Grey, his blue shirt of costly madras, his
limp crossed elegance of legs and pleated trousers, the little
man half rose, scraping his chair back from the table round which
the class was sitting, and with an inclusive gesture of his
claw-like hand, screamed incoherently:</p>

<p>"These! These! . . . We have the English. . . . As for the
Russians. . . . Take the Germans--Toller--Kaiser--the
Expressionists. . . . But the Dutch, the Dutch, the
<i>Catskill</i> Dutch. . . ." Pointing a trembling finger towards
Mr. Grey, he shrieked: "The Philadelphia Cricket Club. . . . God!
God!" he bent, racked with soundless laughter, his thin hands
pressed against his sunken stomach. "That it should come to
this!" he said, and suddenly, catching Professor Hatcher's cold
impassive eye upon him, he slumped down abruptly in his seat, and
fell to biting his nails. "Well, I don't know," he said with a
foolish little laugh. "Maybe--I guess . . ." his voice trailed
off, he did not finish.</p>

<p>"Is there any other comment?" said Professor Hatcher.</p>

<p>There was none.</p>

<p>"Then," said Professor Hatcher, "the class is dismissed until
next Monday."</p>

<p>Professor Hatcher did not look up as Ten Eyck went out.</p>

<p>When Oswald got out into the corridor, he could hear the last
footfalls of the departing class echoing away around the corner.
For a moment, he leaned against the wall: he felt hollow, weak,
and dizzy: his knees bent under him like rubber, and his head,
after its recent flood of blood and passion, felt swollen, light,
and floating as a toy balloon. Suddenly he remembered that it was
Friday. Saturday, the day on which he could next allow himself to
take a little from his dwindling hoard--for such was the
desperate resolution made at the beginning and adhered to ever
since--Saturday shone desperately far away, a small and shining
disc of light at the black mouth of an interminable tunnel, and
all giddy, weak, and hollow as he was, he did not see how he
could wait! So he surrendered. He knew that if he hurried now he
would be just in time for old Miss Potter's Friday afternoon. And
torn between hunger and disgust, Ten Eyck gave in again to hunger
as he had done a score of times before, even when he knew that he
must face again that crowning horror of modern life, the art
party.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Miss Potter was a curious old spinster of some property, and
she lived, with a companion, in a pleasant house on Garden
Street, not far from the University. Miss Potter's companion was
also an aged spinster: her name was Miss Flitcroft; the two women
were inseparable. Miss Potter was massively constructed; a
ponderous woman who moved heavily and with wheezing difficulty,
and whose large eyes bulged comically out of a face on which a
strange fixed grin was always legible.</p>

<p>Miss Flitcroft was a wren of a woman, with bony little hands,
and an old withered, rather distinguished-looking face: she wore
a band of velvet around her stringy neck. She was not only a
companion, she was also a kind of nurse to Miss Potter, and she
could give relief and comfort to the other woman as no one else
could.</p>

<p>For Miss Potter was really very ill: she had a savage love of
life, a desperate fear of death, and she knew that she was dying.
But even the woman's sufferings, which were obviously intense,
were touched by that grotesque and ridiculous quality that made
Ten Eyck want to howl with explosive laughter, even when he felt
a rending pity for her. Thus, at table sometimes, with all her
tribe of would-be poets, playwrights, composers, novelists,
painters, critics, and enfeebled litterateurs gathered around
her, putting away the delicious food she had so abundantly
provided, Miss Potter would suddenly begin to choke, gasp, and
cough horribly; her eyes would bulge out of her head in a
fish-like stare, and looking desperately at Miss Flitcroft with
an expression of unutterable terror, she would croak: . . .
"Dying! Dying! I tell you I'm dying!"</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" Miss Flitcroft would answer tartly, jumping up and
running around behind Miss Potter's chair. "You're no such thing!
. . . You've only choked yourself on something you have eaten!
There!" and she would deliver herself straightway of a resounding
whack upon Miss Potter's meaty, mottled back (for on these great
Friday afternoons, Miss Potter came out sumptuously in velvet,
which gave ample glimpses of her heavy arms and breasts and the
broad thick surface of her shoulders).</p>

<p>"If you didn't eat so fast these things would never happen!"
Miss Flitcroft would say acidly, as she gave Miss Potter another
resounding whack on her bare shoulders. "Now you get over this
nonsense!" . . . whack! "There's nothing wrong with you--do you
hear?" . . . whack! "You're frightened half out of your wits," .
. . whack! . . . "just because you've tried to stuff everything
down your throat at once!" whack! whack!</p>

<p>And by this time Miss Potter would be on the road to recovery,
gasping and panting more easily now, as she continued to look up
with a fixed stare of her bulging eyes at Miss Flitcroft, with an
expression full of entreaty, dawning hopefulness, apology, and
pitiable gratitude.</p>

<p>As for Ten Eyck, his pain and embarrassment when one of these
catastrophes occurred were pitiable. He would scramble to his
feet, stand helplessly, half-crouched, casting stricken glances
toward the most convenient exit as if contemplating the
possibility of a sudden and inglorious flight. Then he would turn
again toward the two old women, his dark eyes fixed on them in a
fascinated stare in which anguish, sympathy, helplessness and
horror were all legible.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>For several years, in spite of her ill health, Miss Potter had
fiddled around on the edges of Professor Hatcher's celebrated
course at the university. She had written a play or two herself,
took a passionate interest in what she called "the work," was
present at the performances of all the plays, and was a charter
member of Professor Hatcher's carefully selected and invited
audiences. Now, whether by appointment or self-election, she had
come to regard herself as a kind of ambassadress for Professor
Hatcher's work and was the chief sponsor of its social life.</p>

<p>The grotesque good old woman was obsessed by that delusion
which haunts so many wealthy people who have no talent and no
understanding, but who are enchanted by the glamour which they
think surrounds the world of art. Miss Potter thought that
through these Friday afternoons she could draw together all the
talent, charm, and brilliance of the whole community. She thought
that she could gather here not only Professor Hatcher's budding
dramatists and some older representatives of the established
order, but also poets, painters, composers, philosophers,
"radical thinkers," people "who did interesting things," of
whatever kind and quality. And she was sure that from his mad
m&eacute;lange everyone would derive a profitable and
"stimulating" intercourse.</p>

<p>Here, from the great "art community" of Cambridge and Boston,
came a whole tribe of the feeble, the sterile, the venomous and
inept--the meagre little spirits of no talent and of great
pretensions: the people who had once got an essay printed in
<i>The Atlantic Monthly</i> or published "a slender volume" of
bad verse; the composers who had had one dull academic piece
performed a single time by the Boston Symphony; the novelists,
playwrights, painters, who had none of the "popular success" at
which they sneered and which they pretended to despise, but for
which each would have sold his shabby little soul; the whole
wretched poisonous and embittered crew of those who had "taken"
someone's celebrated course, or had spent a summer at the
MacDowell Colony--in short, the true philistines of art--the true
enemies of the artist's living spirit, the true defilers and
betrayers of creation--the impotent fumbling little half-men of
the arts whose rootless, earthless, sunless lives have grown
underneath a barrel, and who bitterly nurse their fancied
injuries, the swollen image of their misjudged worth, and hiss
and sting in all the impotent varieties of their small envenomed
hate; who deal the stealthy traitor's blow in darkness at the
work and talent of far better men than they.</p>

<p>Usually, when Ten Eyck went to Miss Potter's house he found
several members of Professor Hatcher's class who seemed to be in
regular attendance on all these Friday afternoons. These others
may have come for a variety of reasons: because they were bored,
curious, or actually enjoyed these affairs, but the strange,
horribly shy and sensitive little man who bore the name of Oswald
Ten Eyck came from a kind of desperate necessity, the ravenous
hunger of his meagre half-starved body, and his chance to get his
one good dinner of the week.</p>

<p>It was evident that Ten Eyck endured agonies of shyness,
boredom, confusion, and tortured self-consciousness at these
gatherings, but he was always there, and when they sat down at
the table he ate with the voracity of a famished animal. The
visitor to Miss Potter's reception room would find him, usually
backed into an inconspicuous corner away from the full sound and
tumult of the crowd, nervously holding a tea-cup in his hands,
talking to someone in the strange blurted-out desperate fashion
that was characteristic of him, or saying nothing for long
periods, biting his nails, thrusting his slender hands
desperately through his mop of black disordered hair, breaking
from time to time into a shrill, sudden, almost hysterical laugh,
blurting out a few volcanic words, and then relapsing into his
desperate hair-thrusting silence.</p>

<p>The man's agony of shyness and tortured nerves was painful to
watch: it made him say and do sudden, shocking and explosive
things that could suddenly stun a gathering such as this, and
plunge him back immediately into a black pit of silence,
self-abasement and despair. And as great as his tortured
sensitivity was, it was greater for other people than for
himself. He could far better endure a personal affront, a
wounding of his own quick pride, than see another person wounded.
His anguish, in fact, when he saw this kind of suffering in other
people would become so acute that he was no longer responsible
for his acts: he was capable of anything on such an occasion.</p>

<p>And such occasions were not lacking at Miss Potter's Friday
afternoons. For even if the entire diplomatic corps had gathered
there in suavest mood, that good grotesque old woman, with her
unfailing talent for misrule, would have contrived to set every
urbane minister of grace snarling for the other's blood before an
hour had passed. And with that museum collection of freaks,
embittered &aelig;sthetes and envenomed misfits of the arts, that
did gather there, she never failed. Her genius for confusion and
unrest was absolute.</p>

<p>If there were two people in the community who had been
destined from birth and by every circumstance of education,
religious belief, and temperament, to hate each other with a
murderous hatred the moment that they met, Miss Potter would see
to it instantly that the introduction was effected. If Father
Davin, the passionate defender of the faith and the foe of
modernism in all its hated forms, had been invited to one of Miss
Potter's Friday afternoons, he would find himself shaking hands
before he knew it with Miss Shanksworth, the militant
propagandist for free love, sterilization of the unfit, and the
unlimited practice of birth control by every one, especially the
lower classes.</p>

<p>If the editor of <i>The Atlantic Monthly</i> should be
present, he would find himself, by that unerring drawing together
of opposites which Miss Potter exercised with such accuracy,
seated next to the person of one Sam Shulemovitch, who as leader
and chief editorial writer of an organ known as <i>Red Riot</i>
or <i>The Worker's Dawn,</i> had said frequently and with
violence that the sooner <i>The Atlantic Monthly</i> was
extinguished, and its writers, subscribers, and editorial staff
embalmed and put on exhibition in a museum, the better it would
be for every one.</p>

<p>If the radical leader who had just served a sentence in prison
for his speeches, pamphlets, and physical aggressions against the
police, or members of the capitalist class, should come to one of
Miss Potter's Friday afternoons, he would find himself
immediately debating the merits of the present system and the
need for the swift extinction of the wealthy parasite with a
maiden lady from Beacon Street who had a parrot, two Persian
kittens, and a Pekinese, three maids, a cook, a butler, chauffeur
and motor car, a place at Marblehead, and several thousand shares
of Boston and Maine.</p>

<p>And so it went, all up and down the line, at one of Miss
Potter's Friday afternoons. There, in her house, you could be
sure that if the lion and the lamb did not lie down together
their hostess would seat then in such close proximity to each
other that the ensuing slaughter would be made as easy, swift,
and unadorned as possible.</p>

<p>And as the sound of snarl and curse grew louder in the
clamorous tumult of these Friday afternoons, as the face grew
livid with its hate, as the eye began to glitter and the vein to
swell upon the temple, Miss Potter would look about her with
triumphant satisfaction, seeing that her work was good, thinking
with delight:</p>

<p>"How stimulating! How fine it is to see so many interesting
people together--people who are really doing things! To see the
flash and play of wit, to watch the clash of brilliant
intellects, to think of all these fine young men and women have
in common, and of the mutual benefits they will derive from
contact with one another!--ah-ha! What a delightful thing to
see--but who is this that just came--" she would mutter, peering
toward the door, for she was very near-sighted--"who?
<i>Who?</i>--O-oh! Professor Lawes of the Art Department--oh,
Professor Lawes, I'm so glad you could come. We have the most
<i>interesting</i> young man here today--Mr. Wilder, who painted
that picture everyone's talking about--"Portrait of a Nude
Falling Upon Her Neck in a Wet Bathroom"--Mr. Wilder, this is
Doctor Lawes, the author of <i>Sanity and Tradition in the
Renaissance</i>--I know you're going to find <i>so</i> much in
common."</p>

<p>And having done her duty, she would wheeze heavily away,
looking around with her strange fixed grin and bulging eyes to
see if she had left anything or anyone undone or whether there
was still hope of some new riot, chaos, brawl, or bitter
argument.</p>

<p>And yet there was a kind of wisdom in her too, that few who
came there to her house suspected: a kind of shrewdness in the
fixed bulging stare of her old eyes that sometimes saw more than
the others knew. Perhaps it was only a kind of instinct of the
old woman's warm humanity that made her speak to the fragile
little man with burning eyes more gently than she spoke to
others, to seat him on her right hand at the dinner table, and to
say from time to time: "Give Mr. Ten Eyck some more of that roast
beef. Oh, Mr. Ten Eyck, <i>do</i>--you've hardly eaten
anything."</p>

<p>And he, stretched out upon the rack of pride and all the
bitter longing of his hunger, would crane convulsively at his
collar and laugh with a note of feeble protest, saying, "Well--I
don't know . . . I really think . . . if you want me to. . . .
Oh! all right then," as a plate smoking with her lavish helping
was placed before him, and would straightway fall upon it with
the voracity of a famished wolf.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>When Ten Eyck reached Miss Potter's on that final fateful
Friday, the other guests were already assembled. Miss Thrall, a
student of the woman's section of Professor Hatcher's course, was
reading her own translation of a German play which had only
recently been produced. Miss Potter's reception rooms--which were
two large gabled rooms on the top floor of her house, ruggedly
festooned with enormous fishing nets secured from Gloucester
fishermen--were crowded with her motley parliament, and the whole
gathering was discreetly hushed while the woman student read her
play.</p>

<p>It was a scene to warm the heart of any veteran of
&aelig;sthetic parties. The lights were soft, shaded, quietly and
warmly subdued: the higher parts of the room were pools of
mysterious gloom from which the Gloucester fishing nets depended,
but within the radius of the little lamps, one could see groups
of people tastefully arranged in all the attitudes of rapt
attentiveness. Some of the young women slouched dreamily upon
sofas, the faces and bodies leaning toward the reader with a
yearning movement, other groups could be vaguely discerned
leaning upon the grand piano, or elegantly slumped against the
walls with tea-cups in their hands. Mr. Cram, the old composer,
occupied a chosen seat on a fat sofa; he drew voluptuously on a
moist cigarette which he held daintily between his dirty fingers,
his hawk-like face turned meditatively away into the subtle
mysteries of the fishing nets. From time to time he would thrust
one dirty hand through the long sparse locks of his grey hair,
and then draw deeply, thoughtfully on his cigarette.</p>

<p>Some of the young men were strewn about in pleasing postures
on the floor, in attitudes of insouciant grace, gallantly near
the ladies' legs. Ten Eyck entered, looked round like a
frightened rabbit, ducked his head, and then sat down jack-knife
fashion beside them.</p>

<p>Miss Thrall sat on the sofa with the old composer, facing her
audience. The play that she was reading was one of the new German
Expressionist dramas, at that time considered one of "the most
vital movements in the world theatre," and the young lady's
translation of the play which bore the vigorous title of <i>You
Shall Be Free When You Have Cut Your Father's Throat,</i> ran
somewhat in this manner:</p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>Elektra:</i> (advancing a step to the top of the raised
dais, her face blue with a ghastly light, and her voice low and
hoarse with passion as she addresses the dark mass of men below
her.) Listen, man! To you it is now proper that I speak must. Do
you by any manner of means know who this woman who now before you
speaking stands may be? (With a sudden swift movement she, the
purple-reddish silk-stuff of the tunic which she wearing is,
asunder in two pieces rips, her two breasts exposing.)</p>

<p>(A low
swiftly-growing-and-to-the-outer-edges-of-the-crowd-thunder-becoming
mutter of astonishment through the great crowd surges.)</p>

<p><i>Elektra:</i> (Thunder louder becomes, and even with every
moment growing yet) Elektra! (The sound to a mighty roar arisen
has, and now from every throat is in a single shout torn.)
ELEKTRA!</p>

<p><i>Elektra:</i> (quietly) Ja! Man, thou hast said it. I am
Elektra!</p>

<p><i>The Crowd:</i> (with from their throats an even-stronger
roar yet) ELEKTRA. It is Elektra!</p>

<p><i>Elektra:</i> (her voice even lower and more hoarse
becoming, her eyes with the red blood-pains of all her
heart-grief with still greater love-sorrow at the man-mass
gleaming.) Listen, man. Slaves, workers, the of your fathers'
sons not yet awakened--hear! Out of the night-dark of your not
yet born souls to deliver you have I come! So, hear! (Her voice
even lower with the low blood-pain heart-hate hoarse becoming.)
To-night must you your old with-crime-blackened and
by-ignorance-blinded father's throat cut! I have spoken: so must
it be.</p>

<p><i>A voice, Homunculus:</i> (from the crowd, pleadingly, with
protest.) Ach! Elektra! Spare us! Please! With the blood-lust
malice-blinded your old father's throat to cut not nice is.</p>

<p><i>Elektra:</i> (raising her arm with a cold imperious gesture
of command.) As I have spoken, must it be! Silence!</p>

<p>(Homunculus starts to interrupt: again she speaks, her voice
more loud and stern becoming.) Silence! Silence!</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>At this moment there was a loud and sibilant hiss from the
door. Miss Potter, who had been on the point of entering the
room, had been halted by the sight of Miss Thrall's arm uplifted
in command and by the imperious coldness of her voice as she said
"Silence!" Now as Miss Thrall stopped and looked up in a startled
manner, Miss Potter, still hissing loudly, tiptoed ponderously
into the room. The old woman advanced with the grace of a
hydropic hippopotamus, laying her finger to her lips as she came
on, looking all around her with her fixed grin and bulging eyes,
and hissing loudly for the silence she had thus violently
disrupted every time she laid her finger to her lips.</p>

<p>Every one <i>stared</i> at her in a moment of blank and
horrible fascination. As for Miss Thrall, she gaped at her with
an expression of stupefaction which changed suddenly to a cry of
alarm as Miss Potter, tiptoeing blindly ahead, barged squarely
into the small crouched figure of Oswald Ten Eyck, and went
plunging over him to fall to her knees with a crash that made the
fish-nets dance, the pictures swing, and even drew a sympathetic
resonant vibration from the polished grand piano.</p>

<p>Then, for one never-to-be-forgotten moment, while everyone
<i>stared</i> at her in a frozen paralysis of horrified
astonishment, Miss Potter stayed there on her knees, too stunned
to move or breathe, her eyes bulging from her head, her face
turned blindly upward in an attitude of grotesque devotion. Then
as she began to gasp and cough with terror, Ten Eyck came to
life. He fairly bounded off the floor, glanced round him like a
startled cat, and spying a pitcher on a tray, rushed toward it
wildly, seized it in his trembling hands, and attempted to pour a
glass of water, most of which spilled out. He turned, still
clutching the glass in his hand, and panting out "Here! Here! . .
. Take this!" he rushed toward Miss Potter. Then, terrified by
her apoplectic stare, he dashed the contents of the glass full in
her face.</p>

<p>A half-dozen young men sprang to her assistance and lifted her
to her feet. The play was forgotten, the whole gathering broke
into excited and clamorous talk, above which could be heard Miss
Flitcroft's tart voice, saying sharply, as she whacked the
frightened and dripping old woman on the back:</p>

<p>"Nonsense! You're not! You're no such thing! . . . You're just
frightened out of your wits; that's all that's the matter with
you--If you ever stopped to look where you were going, these
things would never happen!"</p>

<p>Whack!</p>

<p>Both Oswald and Miss Potter had recovered by the time the
guests were assembled round the table. As usual, Oswald found he
had been seated on Miss Potter's right hand: and the feeling of
security this gave him, together with the maddening fragrance of
food, the sense of ravenous hunger about to be appeased, filled
him with an almost delirious joy, a desire to shout out, to sing.
Instead, he stood nervously beside his chair, looking about with
a shy and timid smile, passing his fingers through his hair
repeatedly, waiting for the other guests to seat themselves.
Gallantly, he stood behind Miss Potter's chair, and pushed it
under her as she sat down. Then, with a feeling of jubilant
elation, he sat down beside her and drew his chair up. He wanted
to talk, to prove himself a brilliant conversationalist, to
surprise the whole gathering with his wit, his penetration, his
distinguished ease. Above all, he wanted to eat and eat and eat!
His head felt light and drunk and giddy, but gloriously so--he
had never been so superbly confident in his life. And in this
mood, he unfolded his napkin, and smiling brightly, turned to
dazzle his neighbour on his right with the brilliant
effervescence of wit that already seemed to sparkle on his lips.
One look, and the bright smile faded, wit and confidence fell
dead together, his heart shrank instantly and seemed to drop out
of his very body like a rotten apple. Miss Potter had not failed.
Her unerring genius for calamity had held out to the finish. He
found himself staring into the poisonous face of the one person
in Cambridge that he hated most--the repulsive visage of the old
composer, Cram.</p>

<p>An old long face, yellowed with malevolence, a sudden
fox-glint of small eyes steeped in a vitriol of ageless hate, a
beak of cruel nose, and thin lips stained and hardened in a rust
of venom, the whole craftily, slantingly astare between a dirty
frame of sparse lank locks. Cackling with malignant glee, and
cramming crusty bread into his mouth, the old composer turned and
spoke:</p>

<p>"Heh! Heh! Heh!"--Crunch, crunch--"It's <i>Mister</i> Ten
Eyck, isn't it? The man who wrote that play Professor Hatcher put
on at his last performance--that mystical fantasy kind of thing.
That was <i>your</i> play, wasn't it?"</p>

<p>The old yellow face came closer, and he snarled in a kind of
gloating and vindictive whisper: "Most of the audience
<i>hated</i> it! They thought it very <i>bad,</i> sir--very bad!"
Crunch, crunch. "I am only telling you because I think you ought
to know--that you may profit by the criticism."</p>

<p>And Ten Eyck, hunger gone now, shrank back as if a thin
poisoned blade had been driven in his heart and twisted there.
"I--I--I thought some of them rather liked it. Of course I don't
know--I can't say--" he faltered hesitantly, "but I--I really
thought some of the audience--liked it."</p>

<p>"Well, they <i>didn't,"</i> the composer snarled, still
crunching on his crust of bread. "Everyone that I saw thought
that it was terrible. Heh! Heh! Heh! Heh! Except my wife and I--"
Crunch, crunch. "We were the only ones who thought that it was
any good at all, the only ones who thought there would ever be
any <i>hope</i> for you. And we found parts of it--a phrase or
sentence here and there--now and then a scene--that we
<i>liked.</i> As for the rest of them," he suddenly made a
horrible downward gesture with a clenched fist and pointing
thumb, "it was <i>thumbs down,</i> my boy! Done for! No good. . .
. That's what they thought of <i>you,</i> my boy. And that," he
snarled suddenly, glaring round him, <i>"that</i> is what they've
thought of <i>me</i> all these years--of <i>me,</i> the greatest
composer that they have, the man who has done more for the cause
of American music than all the rest of them combined--<i>me!</i>
<i>me! me!</i> the prophet and the seer!" he fairly screamed,
<i>"thumbs down!</i> Done for! No good any more!"</p>

<p>Then he grew suddenly quiet, and leaning toward Ten Eyck with
a gesture of horrible clutching intimacy, he whispered: "And
<i>that's</i> what they'll always think of you, my boy--of anyone
who has a grain of talent--Heh! Heh! Heh! Heh!" Peering into Ten
Eyck's white face, he shook him gently by the arm, and cackled
softly a malevolent tenderness, as if the evidence of the anguish
that his words had caused had given him a kind of paternal
affection for his victim. "That's what they said about your play,
all right, but don't take it too seriously. It's live and learn,
my boy, isn't it?--profit by criticism--a few hard knocks will do
you no harm. Heh! Heh! Heh! Heh! Heh!"</p>

<p>And turning, satisfied with the anguish he had caused, he
thrust out his yellowed face with a vulture's movement of his
scrawny neck, and smacking his envenomed lips with relish, drew
noisily inward with slobbering suction on a spoon of soup.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>As for Ten Eyck, all hunger now destroyed by his sick shame
and horror and despair, he turned, began to toy nervously with
his food, and forcing his pale lips to a trembling and uncertain
smile, tried desperately to compel his brain to pay attention to
something that was being said by the man across the table who was
the guest of honour for the day, and whose name was Hunt.</p>

<p>Hunt had been well known for his belligerent pacifism during
the war, had been beaten by the police and put in jail more times
than he could count, and now that he was temporarily out of jail,
he was carrying on his assault against organized society with
more ferocity than ever. He was a man of undoubted courage and
deep sincerity, but the suffering he had endured, and the brutal
intolerance of which he had been the victim, had left its
mutilating mark upon his life. His face was somehow like a scar,
and his cut, cruel-looking mouth could twist like a snake to the
corner of his face when he talked. And his voice was harsh and
jeering, brutally dominant and intolerant, when he spoke to
anyone, particularly if the one he spoke to didn't share his
opinions.</p>

<p>On this occasion, Miss Potter, with her infallible talent for
error, had seated next to Hunt a young Belgian student at the
university, who had little English, but a profound devotion to
the Roman Catholic Church. Within five minutes, the two were
embroiled in a bitter argument, the Belgian courteous, but
desperately resolved to defend his faith, and because of his
almost incoherent English as helpless as a lamb before the attack
of Hunt, who went for him with the rending and pitiless savagery
of a tiger. It was a painful thing to watch: the young man,
courteous and soft-spoken, his face flushed with embarrassment
and pain, badly wounded by the naked brutality of the other man's
assault.</p>

<p>As Ten Eyck listened, his spirit began to emerge from the
blanket of shame and sick despair that had covered it, a spark of
anger and resentment, hot and bright, began to glow, to burn, to
spread. His large dark eyes were shining now with a deeper,
fiercer light than they had had before, and on his pale cheeks
there was a flush of angry colour. And now he no longer had to
force himself to listen to what Hunt was saying: anger had fanned
his energy and his interest to a burning flame; he listened
tensely, his ears seemed almost to prick forward on his head,
from time to time he dug his fork viciously into the table-cloth.
Once or twice, it seemed that he would interrupt. He cleared his
throat, bent forward, nervously clutching the table with his
claw-like hands, but each time ended up thrusting his fingers
through his mop of hair, and gulping down a glass of wine.</p>

<p>As Hunt talked, his voice grew so loud in its rasping
arrogance that everyone at the table had to stop and listen,
which was what he most desired. And there was no advantage,
however unjust, which the man did not take in this bitter
argument with the young Belgian. He spoke jeeringly of the fat
priests of the old corrupt Church, fattening themselves on the
blood and life of the oppressed workers; he spoke of the bigotry,
oppression, and superstition of religion, and of the necessity
for the workers to destroy this monster which was devouring them.
And when the young Belgian, in his faltering and painful English,
would try to reply to these charges, Hunt would catch him up on
his use of words, pretend to be puzzled at his pronunciation, and
bully him brutally in this manner:</p>

<p>"You think <i>what? . . . What? . . .</i> I don't understand
what you're saying half the time. . . . It's very difficult to
talk to a man who can't speak decent English."</p>

<p>"I--vas--say--ink," the young Belgian would answer slowly and
painfully, his face flushed with embarrassment--
"--vas--say--ink--zat--I sink--zat you--ex--ack--sher--ate--"</p>

<p>"That I <i>what?</i>--<i>What?</i> What is he trying to say,
anyway?" demanded Hunt, brutally, looking around the table as if
hoping to receive interpretation from the other guests. "Oh-h!"
he cried suddenly, as if the Belgian's meaning had just dawned on
him. <i>"Exaggerate!</i> That's the word you're trying to say!"
and he laughed in an ugly manner.</p>

<p>Oswald Ten Eyck had stopped eating and turned white as a
sheet. Now he sat there, looking across in an agony of tortured
sympathy at the young Belgian, biting his nails nervously, and
thrusting his hands through his hair in a distracted manner. The
resentment and anger that he had felt at first had now burned to
a white-heat of choking, murderous rage. The little man was taken
out of himself entirely. Suddenly his sense of personal wrong,
the humiliation and pain he had himself endured, was fused with a
white-hot anger of resentment for every injustice and wrong that
had ever been done to the wounded soul of man. United by that
agony to a kind of savage fellowship with the young Belgian, with
the insulted and the injured of the earth, of whatsoever class or
creed, that burning coal of five feet five flamed in one
withering blaze of wrath, and hurled the challenge of its scorn
at the oppressor.</p>

<p>The thing happened like a flash. At the close of one of Hunt's
jeering tirades, Ten Eyck jumped from his chair, and leaning half
across the table, cried out in a high shrill voice that cut into
the silence like a knife:</p>

<p>"Hunt! You are a swine, and everyone who ever had anything to
do with you is likewise a swine!" For a moment he paused,
breathing hard, clutching his napkin in a bony hand. Slowly his
feverish eyes went round the table, and suddenly, seeing the
malevolent stare of the old composer Cram fixed upon him, he
hurled the wadded napkin down and pointing a trembling finger at
that hated face, he screamed: "And that goes for you as well, you
old bastard! . . . It goes for all the rest of you," he shrieked,
gesturing wildly. "Hunt . . . Cram! <i>Cram! . . .</i> God!" he
cried, shaking with laughter. <i>"There's</i> a name for you! . .
. It's perfect. . . . Yes, you! You swine!" he yelled again,
thrusting his finger at Cram's yellowed face so violently that
the composer scrambled back with a startled yelp. "And all the
rest of you!" he pointed towards Miss Thrall--"You--the
Expressionist!" And he paused, racked terribly again by soundless
laughter--"The Greeks--the Russians--Oh how we love in
Spain!--and fantasy--why, Goddam my soul to hell, but it's
delightful!" he fairly screamed, and then pointing a trembling
finger at several in succession he yelled: "You?--And you?--And
you?--What the hell do you know about anything? . . .
Ibsen--Chekov--the Celtic Dawn--<i>Bosh!"</i> he snarled, "Food!
Food! Food!--you Goddam fools! . . . That's all that matters." He
picked up a morsel of his untouched bread and hurled it savagely
upon the table--"Food! Food!--Ask Cram--he knows. . . . Now," he
said, panting for breath and pointing a trembling finger at Miss
Potter--"Now," he panted, "I want to tell <i>you</i>
something."</p>

<p>"Oh . . . Mr. . . . Ten . . . Eyck," the old woman faltered in
a tone of astonished reproach, "I . . . never . . . believed it
possible . . . you could--"</p>

<p>Her voice trailed off helplessly, and she looked at him. And
Ten Eyck, suddenly brought to himself by the bulging stare of
that good old creature fixed on him with wounded disbelief,
suddenly laughed again, shrilly and hysterically, thrust his
fingers through his hair, looked about him at the other people
whose eyes were fixed on him in a stare of focal horror, and said
in a confused, uncertain tone: "Well, I don't know--I'm always--I
guess I said something that--oh, damn it, what's the use?" and
with a desperate, stricken laugh, he slumped suddenly into his
chair, craned convulsively at his collar, and seizing a decanter
before him poured out a glass of wine with trembling haste and
gulped it down.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, all around the table people began to talk with that
kind of feverish eagerness that follows a catastrophe of this
sort, and Hunt resumed his arguments, but this time in a much
quieter tone and with a kind of jeering courtesy, accompanying
his remarks from time to time with a heavy sarcasm directed
toward Ten Eyck--"If I may say so--since, of course, Mr. Ten Eyck
considers me a swine"--or--"if you will pardon such a remark from
a swine like me"--or--"as Mr. Ten Eyck has told you I am nothing
but a swine," and so on.</p>

<p>The upshot of it was that Ten Eyck gulped down glass after
glass of the strong wine, which raced instantly through his frail
starved body like a flame.</p>

<p>He got disgracefully drunk, sang snatches of bawdy songs,
screamed with maudlin laughter, and began to pound
enthusiastically on the table, shaking his head to himself and
shouting from time to time:</p>

<p>"You're right, Hunt! . . . God-damn it, man, you're right! . .
. Go on! . . . Go on! I agree with you! You're right! Everybody
else is wrong but Hunt and Cram! . . . Words by Hunt, music by
Cram . . . no one's right but Hunt and Cram!"</p>

<p>They tried to quiet him, but in vain. Suddenly Miss Potter
began to cough and choke and gasp, pressed both hands over her
heart, and gasped out in a terror-stricken voice:</p>

<p>"Oh, my God, I'm dying!"</p>

<p>Miss Flitcroft jumped to her feet and came running to her
friend's assistance, and then while Miss Flitcroft pounded the
old woman on her back and the guests scrambled up in a general
disruption of the party, Oswald Ten Eyck staggered to the window,
flung it open, and looking out across one of the bleak
snow-covered squares of Cambridge, screamed at the top of his
voice:</p>

<p>"Relentless! . . . Relentless! . . . Juh sweez un
art-e-e-este!" Here he beat on his little breast with a claw-like
hand and yelled with drunken laughter, "And, Goddamn it, I will
always be relentless . . . relentless . . . relentless!"</p>

<p>The cool air braced him with its cleansing shock: for a
moment, the fog of shame and drunkenness shifted in his brain, he
felt a vacancy of cold horror at his back, and turning suddenly
found himself confronted by the frozen circle of their faces,
fixed on him. And even in that instant glimpse of utter ruin, as
the knowledge of this final catastrophe was printed on his brain,
over the rim of frozen faces he saw the dial-hands of a clock.
The time was seven-fifty-two: he knew there was a train at
midnight for New York--and work, food, freedom, and
forgetfulness. He would have four hours to go home and pack: if
he hurried he could make it.</p>

<p>Little was heard of him thereafter. It was rumoured that he
had gone back to his former lucrative employment with Mr. Hearst:
and Professor Hatcher smiled thinly when he heard the news; the
young men looked at one another with quiet smiles.</p>

<p>And yet he could not wholly be forgotten: occasionally someone
mentioned him.</p>

<p>"A strange case, wasn't it?" said Mr. Grey. "Do you remember
how he looked? Like . . . like . . . really, he was like some
medi&aelig;val ascetic. I thought he had something. I thought he
would do something . . . I really did, you know! And
then--heavens!--that last play!" He tossed his cigarette away
with a movement of dismissal. "A strange case," he said with
quiet finality. "A man who looked as if he had it and who turned
out--all belly and no brain."</p>

<p>There was silence for a moment while the young men smoked.</p>

<p>"I wonder what it was," another said thoughtfully at length.
"What happened to him? I wonder why."</p>

<p>There was no one there who knew the answer. The only one on
earth, perhaps, who could have given it was that curious old
spinster named Miss Potter. For blind to many things that all
these clever young men knew, that good grotesque old empress of
confusion still had a wisdom that none of them suspected. But
Miss Potter was no longer there to tell them, even if she could.
She had died that spring.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Later it seemed to Gene that the cold and wintry light of
desolation--the red waning light of Friday in the month of
March--shone for ever on the lives of all the people. And for
ever after, when he thought of them, their lives, their faces and
their words--all that he had seen and known of them--would be
fused into a hopeless, joyless image which was somehow consonant
to that accursed wintry light that shone upon it. And this was
the image:</p>

<p>He was standing upon the black and grimy snow of winter before
Miss Potter's house, saying good-bye to a group of her invited
guests. The last red wintry light of Friday afternoon fell on
their lives and faces as he talked to them, and made them hateful
to him, and yet he searched those faces and talked desperately to
see if he could find there any warmth or love or joy, any ring of
hope for himself which would tell him that his sick heart and
leaden spirit would awake to life and strength again, that he
would get his hands again on life and love and labour, and that
April would come back again.</p>

<p>But he found nothing in these cold and hateful faces but the
lights of desolation, the deadly and corrupt joy that took
delight in its own death, and breathed, without any of the agony
and despair he felt, the poisonous ethers of its own dead world.
In those cold hateful faces as that desolate and wintry light
fell on them he could find no hope for his own life or the life
of living men. Rather, he read in their pale faces, and in their
rootless and unwholesome lives, which had come to have for him
the wilted yellow pallor of nameless and unuseful plants such as
flourish under barrels, a kind of cold malicious triumph, a
momentary gleam in pale fox-eyes, which said that they looked
upon his desperate life and knew the cause of his despair, and
felt a bitter triumph over it. The look on their cold faces and
in their fox-eyes said to him that there was no hope, no work, no
joy, no triumph, and no love for such as he, that there could be
nothing but defeat, despair and failure for the living of this
world, that life had been devoured and killed by such as these,
and had become rats' alley, death-in-life for ever.</p>

<p>And yet he searched their hated faces desperately in that cold
red light, he sought frantically in their loathed faces for a ray
of hope, and in his drowning desolation shameful words were
wrenched from him against his will--words of entreaty, pleading,
pitiful begging for an alms of mercy, a beggarly scrap of
encouragement, even a word of kindly judgment on his life, from
these cold and hateful faces that he loathed.</p>

<p>"But my work--this last work that I did--don't you
think--didn't it seem to you that there was something good in
it--not much, perhaps, but just enough to give me hope? . . .
Don't you think if I go on I may do something good some day--for
God's sake, tell me if you do?--or must I die here in this barren
and accursed light of Friday afternoon, must I drown and smother
in this poisonous and lifeless air, wither in this rootless,
yellow, barren earth below the barrel, die like a mad dog howling
in the wilderness, with the damned, cold, hateful sneer of your
impotent lives upon me?</p>

<p>"Tell me, in God's name, man, is there no life on earth for
such as I? Has the world been stripped for such as you? Have all
joy, hope, health, sensual love, and warmth and tenderness gone
out of life--are living men the false men, then, and is all truth
and work and wisdom owned by rats' alley and the living dead such
as yourself?--For God's sake, tell me if there is no hope for me!
Let me have the worst, the worst, I beg of you. Is there nothing
for me now but the grey gut, the sick heart, and the leaden
spirit? Is there nothing now but Friday afternoon in March, Miss
Potter's parties, and your damned poisonous, sterile, cold,
life-hating faces? For God's sake tell me now if I am no good, am
false while you, the living dead, are true--and had better cut my
throat or blow my brains out than stay on longer in this world of
truth, where joy is dead, and only the barren rootless lives of
dead men live!--In God's name, tell me now, if this is true--or
do you find a rag of hope for me?"</p>

<p>"Ah," the old composer Cram would answer, arranging the folds
of his dirty scarf, and peering out malevolently underneath his
sparse lank webs of dirty grey, as the red and wintry light fell
hopelessly on his poisonous old face. "--Ah-h," he rasped
bitterly, "--my wife and I liked some things in that play of
yours that Professor Hatcher put on in his Playshop. . . . My
wife and I liked one or two speeches in that play," he rasped,
"but"--for a moment a fox's glittering of malevolent triumph
shone in his eyes as he drove the fine blade home "--no one else
did!--No one else thought it was any good at all!" he cackled
malevolently. "I heard people saying all around me that they
<i>hated</i> it," he gloated, "--that you had no talent, no
ability to write, and had better go back where you came
from--live some other kind of life--or <i>kill</i> yourself," he
gloated--"That's the way it is, my boy!--Nothing but defeat and
misery and despair for such as you in life! . . . That has been
my lot, too," he cackled vindictively, rubbing his dry hands in
glee. "They've always hated what I did--if I ever did anything
good I was lucky if I found two people who liked it. The rest of
them <i>hated</i> it," he whispered wildly. "There's no hope for
you--so <i>die, die, die,"</i> he whispered, and cackling with
malevolent triumph, he rubbed his dry hands gleefully.</p>

<p>"Meeker, for God's sake," the boy cried, turning to the
elegant figure of the clergyman, who would be carefully arranging
around his damned luxurious neck the rich folds of a silk blue
scarf--"Meeker, do you feel this way about it, too? . . . Is that
your opinion? . . . Do you find nothing good in what I do?"</p>

<p>--"You see, old chap, it's this way," Meeker answered, in his
soft voice, and drew with languor on one of his expensive
straw-tipped cigarettes--"You have lots of ability, I am
sure"--here he paused to inhale meditatively again--"but don't
you think, old boy, it's critical rather than creative?--now with
Jim here it's different," he continued, placing one hand
affectionately on Hogan's narrow shoulders--"Jim here's a great
genius--like Shelley--with a great gift waiting for the
world"--Here Hogan lowered his pale weak face with a simpering
smile of modesty, but not before the boy had seen the fox's
glitter of vindictive triumph in his pale dull eyes--"but you
have nothing of that sort to give. Why don't you try to make the
best of what you have?" he said with hateful sympathetic urbanity
and put the cigarette to elegant and reflective lips again.</p>

<p>"Hogan," the boy cried hoarsely, turning to the poet,"--is
that your answer, too? Have you no word of hope for me?--but no,
you damned, snivelling, whining upstart--you are gloating at your
rotten little triumph, aren't you? I'd get nothing out of you,
would I?"</p>

<p>"Come on, Jim," said Meeker quietly. "He's becoming abusive. .
. . The kind of attack you make is simply stupid," he now said.
"It will get you nowhere."</p>

<p>"And so raucous--so raucous," said Hogan, smirking nervously.
"It means nothing."</p>

<p>And the three hated forms of death would go away then rapidly,
snickering among themselves, and he would turn again, filled with
the death of life, the end of joy, again, again, to prowl the
wintry, barren, and accursed streets of Friday night.</p>

<h1>XXXVII</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>It had been almost two years since Eugene had last seen Robert
Weaver, but now, by one of those sudden hazards of blind chance
that for a moment bring men's lives together and in an instant
show them more than years together could have done, he was to see
the other youth again.</p>

<p>One night in his second year at Cambridge he was reading in
his room at about two o'clock in the morning, at the heart and
core of the brooding silence of night that had come to mean so
much to him, and that had the power to stir him as no other time
of day could do with a feeling of swelling and exultant joy. The
house had gone to sleep long before and there was no sound
anywhere: it was late in winter, along in March, and the ice and
snow had been packed and frozen on the earth for months with a
kind of weary permanence--with a tenacity that gave to winter a
harsh and dreary reality, a protraction of grey days and grim
grey light which made the memory of other seasons, and
particularly the hope of spring, remote and almost unbelievable.
The street outside was frozen in this living and animate silence
of great cold: suddenly this still perfection of night and
darkness was shattered by the engines of a powerful motor which
turned into the end of the street from Massachusetts Avenue, and
tore along before the house at drunken speed with a roaring
explosion of sound. Then, without slackening its speed, the
brakes were jammed on, the car skidded murderously to a halt on
the slippery pavement, and immediately backed up at full speed
until it came before the house again, skidded to a halt and was
abruptly silent.</p>

<p>Someone got out with the same violent impatience, slammed the
door, and then for a moment he could hear him hunting along the
street, swearing and muttering to himself; at length he came back
to the house started up the steps on which he slipped or stumbled
and fell heavily, after which he heard Robert cursing in a tone
of hoarse and feverish discontent: "The God-damnedest place I
ever saw. . . . Did they never hear of a light around here? . . .
Who the hell would want to live in a place like this?"</p>

<p>He began to hammer at the front door and to bawl out Eugene's
name at the top of his voice: then he came up outside his windows
and began to knock on the glass impatiently with his fist. Eugene
went to the door and let him in: he entered the room without a
word, and with the intent driving movement of a man who is very
drunk; then he looked at him scornfully and accusingly, and
barked out: "What time do you go to bed? . . . Do you stay up all
night? . . . What do you do, sleep all morning?" . . . He looked
around the room: the floor was strewn with books he had been
reading and littered with pieces of paper on which he had been
writing. Robert broke into his sudden, hoarse, falsetto laugh:
"The damnedest place I ever saw!" he said. "Do you sleep on that
thing?" he said contemptuously, pointing to his cot bed which
stood along the wall in one corner of the room.</p>

<p>"No, Robert," he said, "I sleep on the floor. I use that for
an ice-box."</p>

<p>"What's that in the corner?" Robert asked, pointing to some
dirty shirts he had thrown there. "Shirts? . . . How long has it
been since you sent anything to the laundry? . . . What do you do
when you want a shirt, go out and buy one? . . . Do you ever take
a bath? . . . Have you had a bath since you came to Harvard?" He
laughed suddenly, hoarsely and wildly again, hurled himself into
a chair, sighed sharply with a weary and impatient discontent,
began to pass his hand across his forehead with an abstracted and
weary movement, and said, "Lord! Lord! Lord! . . . The things
I've done!" he shook his head mournfully. "Why, it's awful," he
said, and he started to shake his head again.</p>

<p>"Why don't you try to talk a little louder?" Eugene suggested.
"I think there are a few people over in South Boston who haven't
heard you yet."</p>

<p>He laughed, hoarsely and abruptly, and then resumed his
abstracted and repentant shaking of the head, sighing heavily
from time to time and saying, "Lord!"</p>

<p>It was the first time Eugene had seen Robert in two years.
Under the hard light that he kept burning in his room he now
looked closely at him: he wore a Derby hat that became his small
lean head well, and he had on a magnificent fur coat, such as the
rich Harvard boys wear, that came down almost to his shoe-tops.
For the rest, he was quietly and elegantly tailored with the
distinction he had always seemed to get into his clothes--there
was always, even in his boyhood, a kind of formal dignity in his
dress: he always wore a stiff, starched collar.</p>

<p>Robert's face had grown thinner, he looked haggard and a good
deal older: the lines of his sharp, incisive features were more
deeply cut and his eyes, now injected and bloodshot from heavy
drinking, were more wild and feverish in their restless
discontent than they had ever been--he seemed to be lashed and
driven by a savage and desperate hunger which he could neither
satisfy nor articulate: he was being consumed and torn to pieces
by a torment of desire and longing, the cause of which he could
not define, and which he had no means to assuage or quench.</p>

<p>He had a bottle half filled with whisky in the pocket of his
fur coat: he took it out and offered Eugene a drink, and after he
had drunk he put the bottle to his lips and gulped down all that
remained in a single draught. Then he flung the empty bottle away
impatiently on the table; it was obvious that the liquor, instead
of giving him some peace or comfort, acted as savagely and
immediately as oil poured on the tumult of a raging fire--it fed
and spurred the madness in him and gave him no release until he
had drunk himself into a state of paralysis and stupefaction. He
was one of those men for whom alcohol was a fatal and
uncontrollable stimulant: having once drawn the cork from a
bottle and tasted his first drink he was then powerless to resist
or stop: he drank until he could drink no more, and he would beg,
fight, lie, cheat, crawl or walk or incur any desperate risk or
danger to get more drink. Yet, he told Eugene that until his
twenty-first year he had never tasted liquor: he began to drink
during his last year in college, and during the two years that
followed he had gone far on the road toward alcoholism.</p>

<p>Eugene asked him how he had found out where he lived and,
still passing his hand across his forehead, he answered in an
impatient and abstracted tone: "Oh . . . I don't know. . . .
Someone told me, I guess. . . . I think it was Arthur Kittrell,"
and then he fell to shaking his head again, and saying, "Awful!
awful! awful! . . . Do you know how much money I've spent so far
this year? . . . Forty-eight hundred dollars. . . . So help me,
God. I hope I may die if I'm not telling you the truth! Why, it's
awful!" he said, and burst into a laugh.</p>

<p>"Have you travelled around a lot?" Gene asked.</p>

<p>"Have I? My God! I've spent only one week-end in New Haven
since the beginning of the year," he said. "Why, it's terrible! .
. . Do you know whom I'm rooming with?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Andy Westerman," he said impressively and then, as the name
communicated none of its significance to Gene, he added
impatiently: "Why, you've heard of the Westermans, haven't you? .
. . My God! what have you been doing all your life? . . . You've
heard of the Westerman vacuum cleaners and electric
refrigerators, haven't you? . . . Why, he's worth $20,000,000 if
he's worth a cent! . . . The craziest man that ever lived!" he
said, breaking suddenly into a sharp recollective laugh.</p>

<p>"Who? Westerman?"</p>

<p>"No. . . . My room-mate . . . that damned Andy Westerman. . .
. Do you want to meet him?"</p>

<p>"Is he up here with you?"</p>

<p>"Why, that's what I'm telling you," he said impatiently.</p>

<p>"Where is he?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Robert with a laugh. "In jail by now, I
reckon. . . . I left him down at the Copley Plaza an hour ago
stopping everyone who came in and asking him if he'd ever been to
Harvard. . . . If the man said yes, Andy would haul off and hit
him as hard as he could. . . . God! the craziest man!" he said.
Then, in a feverish staccato monologue, he continued: "The
damnedest story you ever heard. . . . You never heard anything
like the way I met him in your life. . . . Passed right out in
the gutter on Park Avenue one night. . . . All alone. . . .
They'd given me knock-out drops in some joint and robbed me. . .
. Waked up in the most magnificent apartment you ever saw in your
life. . . . Most beautiful woman you ever saw sitting right there
on the bed holding my hand. . . . Andy Westerman's sister. . . .
God! they've got stuff in that place that cost a fortune. . . .
They've got one picture that the old man paid a hundred thousand
dollars for. . . . Damned little thing that doesn't take up a
foot of space. . . . Twenty million dollars! Yes, sir! . . . And
those two get it all. . . . Why, it'll ruin me!" he burst out.
"It takes every cent I can get to keep up with 'em. . . . My God!
I never saw a place like this in my life! . . . These people up
here think no more of spending a thousand dollars than we'd think
of fifty cents down home. . . . God! I've got to do something. .
. . I've got to get money somehow. . . . Yes, sir, Robert is
going to be right up there among them. . . . Apartment on Park
Avenue and everything. . . . God! that's the most beautiful woman
in the world! All I want is to sleep with her just once. . . .
Yes, sir, just once. . . .</p>

<p>"And to think that she'd go and throw herself away on that
damned consumptive little . . . !" he fairly ground his teeth
together, turned away abruptly, and did not finish.</p>

<p>"Throw herself away on whom? Who is this, Robert?"</p>

<p>"Ah-h! that damned little fellow Upshaw that she's married to:
been waiting--praying--hoping that he'd die for months--she'll
marry me just as soon as he's out of the way--and he knows it!
The damned little rat!" He gnashed his teeth savagely. "He's
hanging on just as long as he can to spite us!" And he cursed
bitterly, with a terrible unconscious humour, against a man who
was too stubborn to oblige him by an early death.</p>

<p>Then he jumped up and said abruptly: "Do you want to go to New
York with me?"</p>

<p>"When?"</p>

<p>"Right now!" said Robert. "I'm ready to go this very minute.
Come on!"--and he started impatiently toward the door.</p>

<p>When Eugene made no move to follow him, he turned and came
back, saying in a resentful tone: "Well, are you coming, or are
you just trying to bluff about it?"</p>

<p>For a moment, the boy was infected by the other's madness, too
near akin to his own ever to be wholly strange to him. The
prospect of that reckless, drunken, purposeless flight through
darkness towards the magic city held him with hypnotic power.
Then, rudely, painfully, he broke the spell and answered
curtly:</p>

<p>"I wouldn't go as far as Harvard Square with you tonight,
Robert. Not if you're going to drive that car. You're too drunk
to know what you're doing and you'll have a smash-up as sure as
you live if you try to drive."</p>

<p>He was, in fact, wildly and dangerously drunk by now and
Eugene began to think of some way of persuading him to go to
sleep and of finding some place where he could spend the night:
in his own room there was only a single cot, and it was too late
to rouse the Murphys--they had been in bed for hours. Then he
remembered that Mr. Wang had an extra couch in one of his rooms:
it was a very comfortable one and he did not think that Wang
would make any objection to Robert's sleeping there if he
explained the situation to him. Therefore, he cautioned Robert to
keep quiet, and went to Wang's door and knocked. Presently he
appeared sleepily, thrusting out his fat, drowsy, and troubled
face to see what the trouble was: when Eugene told him he agreed
very generously and readily to let Robert sleep upon the couch
and thus the young man got him settled at length, although not
before the sudden apparition of a dragon with a scaly tail--one
of the drawings that hung above the couch--had wrested from him a
howl of terror: he had sprung out of bed and rushed out of Wang's
apartment and into Eugene's, saying hoarsely, and in a tone of
frightened indignation: "Do you expect me to spend the night
alone in there with that damned Chinaman and his dragon? . . .
How do I know what he'll do? . . . One of those people would cut
your throat while you're asleep and think nothing of it. . . .
I'm not going to stay in there." Gene finally persuaded him of
Wang's innocence and kindness, and at length he went off to sleep
after drinking the better part of a bottle of Wang's rice
wine.</p>

<p> </p>

<h1>XXXVIII</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>One Sunday morning early in the month of May, Starwick and
Eugene had crossed the bridge that led to the great stadium, and
turned right along a path that followed the winding banks of the
Charles River. Spring had come with the sudden, almost explosive
loveliness that marks its coming in New England: along the banks
of the river the birch trees leaned their slender, white and
beautiful trunks, and their boughs were coming swiftly into the
young and tender green of May.</p>

<p>That spring--which, for Eugene, would be the third and last of
his years in Cambridge--Starwick had become more mannered in his
dress and style than ever before. During the winter, much to
Professor Hatcher's concern--a concern which constantly became
more troubled and which he was no longer able to conceal--the
darling prot&eacute;g&eacute; on whom his bounty and his favour
had been lavished, and to whom, he had fondly hoped, he would one
day pass on the proud authorities of his own position when he
himself should become too old to carry on "the work," had begun
to wear spats and carry a cane and be followed by a dog.</p>

<p>Now, with the coming of spring, Frank had discarded the spats,
but as they walked along beside the Charles, he twirled his
elegant light stick with an air of languid insouciance,
interrupting his conversation with his friend now and then to
speak sharply to the little dog that frisked and scampered along
as if frantic with the joy of May, crying out to the little
creature sharply, commandingly, and in a rather womanish tone
from time to time:</p>

<p>"Heel, Tang! Heel, I say!"</p>

<p>And the dog, a shaggy little terrier--the gift of some wealthy
and devoted friends of Frank's on Beacon Hill--would pause
abruptly in its frisking, turn its head, and look towards its
owner with the attentive, puzzled, and wistfully inquiring look
that dogs and little children have, as if to say: "What is it,
master? Are you pleased with me or have I done something that was
wrong?"</p>

<p>And in a moment, in response to Frank's sharper and more
peremptory command, the little dog, with a crestfallen and
somewhat apologetic look, would scamper back from its wild
gaieties along the green banks of the Charles, to trot meekly
along the path behind the two young men, until its exuberant
springtime spirits got the best of it again.</p>

<p>From time to time, they would pass other students, in pairs or
groups, striding along the pleasant path; and when these young
men saw Starwick twirling his stick and speaking to the little
dog, they would grin broadly at each other and stare curiously at
Starwick as they passed.</p>

<p>Once Starwick paused to call "Heel!" sharply to the little dog
at the very moment it had lifted its leg against a tree, and the
dog, still holding its leg up, had looked inquiringly around at
Starwick with such a wistful look that some students who were
passing had burst out in hearty laughter. But Starwick, although
the colour of his ruddy face deepened a shade, had paid no more
attention to these ruffians than if they had been scum in the
gutter. Rather, he snapped his fingers sharply, and cried "Heel!"
again, at which the little dog left its tree and came trotting
meekly back to its obedient position.</p>

<p>Suddenly, while one of these episodes was being enacted,
Eugene heard the bright wholesome tones of a familiar voice, and
turning round with a startled movement, found himself looking
straight into the broad and beaming countenance of Effie Horton
and her husband Ed.</p>

<p><i>"Well!"</i> Effie was saying in her rich bright voice of
Iowa. "Look who's here! I <i>thought</i> those long legs looked
familiar," she went on in her tone of gay and lightsome, and yet
wholesome, banter, "even from a distance! I told Pooly--" this,
for an unknown reason, was the affectionate nickname by which
Horton was known to his wife and all his friends from Iowa--"I
told Pooly that there was only one pair of legs as long as that
in Cambridge. 'It <i>must</i> be Eugene,' I said.--Yes sir!" she
went on brightly, shaking her head with a little bantering
movement, her broad and wholesome face shining with good nature
all the time. "It <i>is</i> Eugene--and <i>my! my! my!</i>--I
just wish you'd look at him," she went on gaily, in her tones of
full rich fellowship and banter in which, however, a trace of
something ugly, envious, and mocking was evident--"all dressed up
in his Sunday-go-to-meeting clothes out for a walk this fine
morning just to give the pretty girls a treat! Yes, sir!" she
cried again, shaking her head in wondering admiration, and with
an air of beaming satisfaction, "I'll <i>bet</i> you that's
<i>just</i> what he's going to do."</p>

<p>He flushed, unable to think of an apt reply to this
good-natured banter, beneath whose hearty good-fellowship he felt
the presence of something that was false, ugly, jeering and
curiously tormented, and while he was blundering out a clumsy
greeting, Horton, laughing with lazy good-nature at his
confusion, slapped him on the back and said:</p>

<p>"How are yuh, kid? . . . Where the hell have you been keeping
yourself, anyway?"</p>

<p>The tone was almost deliberately coarse and robust in its
hearty masculinity, but beneath it one felt the same false and
spurious quality that had been evident in the woman's tone.</p>

<p>--"And here is <i>Mister</i> Starwick!" Effie now cried
brightly. "--And I <i>wish</i> you'd <i>look!"</i> she went on,
as if enraptured by the spectacle--"all dressed up with a
walking-stick and a dog--and yes, <i>sir!"</i> she exclaimed
ecstatically, after an astonished examination of Frank's
sartorial splendour--"wearing a <i>bee-yew-teeful</i> brown tweed
suit that looks as if it just came out of the shop of a London
tailor! . . . <i>My! my! my! . . .</i> I tell <i>you!"</i> she
went on admiringly--"I just wish the folks back home could see us
now, Pooly--"</p>

<p>Horton laughed coarsely, with apparent good nature, but with
an ugly jeering note in his voice.</p>

<p>"--I just wish they could see us now!" she said. "It's not
everyone can say they knew two London swells--and here they
are--Mr. Starwick with his cane and his dog--and Eugene with his
new suit--yes, <i>sir!</i>--and talking to us just as if we were
their equals."</p>

<p>Eugene flushed, and then with a stiff and inept sarcasm,
said:</p>

<p>"I'll try not to let it make any difference between us,
Effie."</p>

<p>Horton laughed coarsely and heartily again, with false good
nature, and then smote the boy amiably on the back, saying:</p>

<p>"Don't let her kid you, son! Tell her to go to hell if she
gets fresh with you!"</p>

<p>"--And how is Mr. Starwick these fine days!" cried Effie
gaily, now directing the artillery of her banter at his unworthy
person--"Where is that great play we've all been waiting for so
eagerly for, lo! these many years! I tell <i>you</i>!<i>"</i> she
exclaimed with rich conviction--"I'm going to be right there on
the front row the night it opens up on Broadway!--I know that a
play that has taken anyone so many years will be a
masterpiece--every word pure gold--I don't want to miss a
<i>word</i> of it."</p>

<p>"Quite!" said Starwick coldly, in his mannered and affected
tone. His ruddy face had flushed crimson with embarrassment;
turning, he called sharply and coldly to the little dog, in a
high and rather womanish voice: "Heel, Tang! Heel, I say!"</p>

<p>He snapped his fingers and the little dog came trotting meekly
toward him. Before Starwick's cold and scornful impassivity,
Effie's broad and wholesome face did not alter a jot from its
expression of radiant goodwill, but suddenly her eyes, which, set
in her robust and friendly countenance, were the tortured mirror
of her jealous, envious, possessive, and ravenously curious
spirit, had grown hard and ugly, and the undernote of malice in
her gay tones was more apparent than ever when she spoke
again.</p>

<p>"Pooly," she said, laughing, taking Horton affectionately by
the arm and drawing close to him with the gesture of a bitterly
jealous and possessive female, who, by the tortured necessity of
her own spirit, must believe that "her man" is the paragon of the
universe, and herself the envy of all other women, who lust to
have him, but must gnash their teeth in vain--"Pooly," she said
lightly, and drawing close to him, "maybe that's what's wrong
with us! . . . Maybe that's what it takes to make you write a
great play! . . . Yes, <i>sir!"</i> she said gaily, "I believe
that's it! . . . I believe I'll save up all my spending money
until I have enough to buy you a bee-yew-teeful tailored suit
just like the one that Mr. Starwick has on. . . . Yes,
<i>sir!"</i> She nodded her head emphatically in a convinced
manner. "That's just <i>exactly</i> what I'm going to do! . . .
I'm going to get Mr. Starwick to give me the address of his
tailor--and have him make you a <i>bee-yew-teeful</i> new suit of
English clothes--and then, maybe, you'll turn into a great genius
like Mr. Starwick and Eugene!"</p>

<p>"The hell you will!" he said coarsely and heartily. "What's
wrong with the one I got on? I only had it three years--why, it's
as good as the day I bought it." And he laughed with hearty,
robust masculinity.</p>

<p>"Why, Poo-o-ly!" she said reproachfully. "It's turning
<i>green</i>! And I do so want you to get dressed up and be a
<i>genius</i> like Mr. Starwick!"</p>

<p>"Nope!" he said in his tone of dominant finality. "I'll wear
this pair of pants till it falls off me. Then I'll go into
Filene's bargain basement and buy another pair. Nope! You can't
make an &aelig;sthete out of me! I can write just as well with a
hole in the seat of my breeches as not." And laughing coarsely,
with robust and manly good nature, he smote Eugene on the back
again, and rasped out heartily:</p>

<p>"Ain't that right, kid?"</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>Pooly!"</i> cried Effie reproachfully--"And I do
<i>so</i> want you to be a genius--like Mr. Starwick!"</p>

<p>"Now, wait a minute! Wait a minute!" he rasped, lifting a
commanding hand, as he joined with her in this ugly banter.
"That's different! Starwick's an artist--I'm nothing but a
writer. They don't understand the way we artists work--do they,
Starwick? Now an artist is sensitive to all these things," he
went on in a jocose explanatory tone to his wife. "He's got to
have the right <i>atmosphere</i> to work in. Everything's got to
be just right for us artists--doesn't it, Starwick?"</p>

<p>"Quite!" said Starwick coldly.</p>

<p>"Now with me it's different," said Horton heavily. "I'm just
one of those big crude guys who can write anywhere. I get up in
the morning and write, whether I feel like it or not. But it's
different with us artists, isn't it, Starwick? Why, with a real
honest-to-God-dyed-in-the-wool <i>artist</i> like Starwick, his
whole life would be ruined for a <i>month</i> if his pants didn't
fit or if his neck-tie was of the wrong shade. . . . Ain't that
right, Starwick?"</p>

<p>And he laughed heavily, apparently with robust fellowship,
hearty good nature, but his eyes were ugly, evil, jeering, as he
spoke.</p>

<p>"Quite!" said Starwick as before; and, his face deeply
flushed, he called sharply to his dog, and then, turning
inquiringly to Eugene, said quietly: "Are we ready?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I <i>see,</i> I <i>see!"</i> cried Effie, with an air of
gay enlightenment. "That's what everyone is all dressed up
about!--You're out for a walk, aren't you?--all among the little
birdies, and the beeses, and the flowers! <i>My</i>! <i>My</i>!
How I wish I could go along! Pooly!" she said coaxingly, "why
don't you take <i>me</i> for a walk sometime? I'd love to hear
the little birdies sing! Come on, dear. Won't you?" she said
coaxingly.</p>

<p>"Nope!" he boomed out finally. "I walked you across the bridge
and I walked to the corner this morning for a paper. That's all
the walking that I'm going to do today. If you want to hear the
little birdies sing, I'll buy you a canary." And turning to
Eugene, he smote him on the shoulder again, and laughing with
coarse laziness, said:</p>

<p>"You know me, kid. . . . You know how I like exercise, don't
you?"</p>

<p>"Well, then, if we can't go along to hear the little birdies
sing to Mr. Starwick and Eugene, I suppose we'll have to say
good-bye," said Effie regretfully. "We've got no right to keep
them from the little birdies any longer--have we, dear? And think
what a treat it will be for all the little birdies. . . . And
you, Eugene!" she cried out gaily and reproachfully, but now with
real warmth and friendship in her voice. "We haven't seen you at
our home in a-a-ages! What's <i>wrong</i> with you? . . . You
come up soon or I'll be mad at you."</p>

<p>"Sure," Horton came out in his broad Iowa accent, putting his
hand gently on the boy's shoulder. "Come up to see us, kid. We'll
cook some grub and chew the rag a while. You know, I'm not coming
back next year--" for a moment Horton's eyes were clear, grey,
luminous, deeply hurt, and full of pride and tenderness. "We're
going to New Hampshire with Jim Madden. So come up, kid, as soon
as you can: we ought to have one more session before I go."</p>

<p>And the boy, suddenly touched and moved, felt a genuine
affection, the real friendliness--an animal-like warmth and
kindliness and affection that was the truest and most attractive
element in Horton's personality.</p>

<p>And nodding his head, suddenly feeling affection for them both
again, he said:</p>

<p>"All right, Ed. I'll see you soon. So long, Effie. Good-bye.
Goodbye, Ed."</p>

<p>"Good-bye, kid. So long, Starwick," Horton said in a kindly
tone. "We'll be looking for you, Gene--So long!"</p>

<p>Then they parted, in this friendly manner, and Starwick and
Eugene continued their walk along the river. Starwick walked
quietly, saying nothing; from time to time he called sharply to
the little dog, commanding him to come to "heel" again.</p>

<p>The two young men had not seen each other for two months, save
at Professor Hatcher's class, and then their relations had been
formal, cold, and strained. Now Starwick, with a quick friendly
and generous spontaneity, had broken through the stubborn and
resentful pride of the other youth, had made the first advance
toward reconciliation, and, as he was able to do with everyone
when and where he pleased, had instantly conquered his friend's
resentful feelings and won him back with the infinite grace,
charm, and persuasiveness of his own personality.</p>

<p>Yet, during the first part of their walk along the river their
conversation, while friendly, had almost been studiously detached
and casual, and was the conversation of people still under the
constraint of embarrassment and diffidence, who are waiting for
the moment to speak things in which their lives and feelings are
more intimately concerned.</p>

<p>At length they came to a bending in the river where there was
a bank of green turf on which in the past they had often sat and
smoked and talked while that small and lonely river flowed before
them. Seated here again, and provided with cigarettes, a silence
came between them, as if each was waiting for the other one to
speak.</p>

<p>Presently when Eugene looked towards his companion, Starwick's
pleasant face with the cleft chin was turned towards the river in
a set stare, and even as the other young man looked at him, his
ruddy countenance was contorted by the animal-like grimace swift
and instant, which the other boy had often seen before, and which
had in it, somehow, a bestial and inarticulate quality, a kind of
unspeakable animal anguish that could find no release.</p>

<p>In a moment, lowering his head, and staring away into the
grassy turf, Starwick said quietly:</p>

<p>"Why have you not been in to see me these last two
months?"</p>

<p>The other young man flushed, began to speak in a blundering
and embarrassed tone and then, angered by his own confusion,
burst out hotly:</p>

<p>"Look here, Frank--why have you got to be so damned mysterious
and secretive in everything you do?"</p>

<p>"Am I?" said Starwick quietly.</p>

<p>"Yes, you are! You've been that way ever since I met you."</p>

<p>"In what way?" Starwick asked.</p>

<p>"Do you remember the first time I met you?" the other one
demanded.</p>

<p>"Perfectly," Starwick said. "It was during your first year in
Cambridge, a few days after you arrived. We met for dinner at the
'Cock Horse Tavern'."</p>

<p>"Yes," the other said excitedly. "Exactly. You had written me
a note inviting me to dinner, and asking me to meet you there. Do
you remember what was in that note?"</p>

<p>"No. What was it?"</p>

<p>"Well, you said: 'Dear Sir--I should be pleased if you will
meet me for dinner at seven-thirty, Wednesday evening, at the
"Cock Horse Tavern" on Brattle Street.' And the note was signed,
'Francis Starwick.'"</p>

<p>"Well?" Starwick demanded quietly. "And what was wrong with
that?"</p>

<p>"Nothing!" the other young man cried, his face flushing to a
darker hue and the excitement of his manner growing. "Nothing,
Frank! Only, if you were going to invite a stranger--someone you
had never met before--to dinner--why the hell couldn't you have
told him who you are and the purpose of the meeting?"</p>

<p>"I should think the purpose of the meeting was self-evident,"
said Starwick calmly. "The purpose was to have dinner together.
Does that demand a whole volume of explanation? No," he said
coldly, "I confess I see nothing extraordinary about that at
all."</p>

<p>"Of course there wasn't!" the other youth exclaimed with
vehement excitement. "Of course there was nothing extraordinary
about it! Why, then, did you attempt, Frank, to make something
extraordinary out of it?"</p>

<p>"It seems to me that you're the one who's doing that!"
Starwick answered.</p>

<p>"Yes, but, damn it, man," the other cried angrily "--don't you
see the point? You're that way with everything you do! You try to
surround the simplest act with this great air of mystery and
secrecy," he said bitterly. "Inviting me to dinner was all
right--it was fine!" he shouted. "I was a green kid of twenty who
knew no one here, and I was scared to death. It was wonderful to
get an invitation from someone asking me to dinner. But when you
sent the invitation, why couldn't you have added just a word or
two by way of explanation? Why couldn't you have stated one or
two simple facts that would have made the reason for your
invitation clear?"</p>

<p>"For example?" Starwick said.</p>

<p>"Why, Frank, simply that you were Professor Hatcher's
assistant in the course, and that this thing of inviting people
out to dinner was just a way you and Professor Hatcher had of
getting acquainted with the new people," the other youth said
angrily. "After all, you can't get an invitation to dinner from
someone you don't know without wondering what it's all
about."</p>

<p>"And yet you came," said Starwick.</p>

<p>"Yes, of course I came! I think I would have come if I had
never heard of you before--I was so bewildered and rattled by
this new life, and so overwhelmed by living in a big city for the
first time in my life that I would have accepted any kind of
invitation--jumped at the chance of meeting anyone! However, I
already knew who you were when your invitation came. I had heard
that a man named Starwick was Hatcher's assistant. I figured
therefore that the invitation had something to do with your
connection with Professor Hatcher and the course--that you were
inviting me to make me feel more at home up here, to establish a
friendly relation, to give me what information you could, to help
the new people out in any way you could. But when I met you, what
happened?" he went on indignantly. "Never a word about the
course, about Professor Hatcher, about your being his
assistant--you pumped me with questions as if I were a prisoner
in the dock and you the prosecuting lawyer. You told me nothing
about yourself and asked a thousand questions about me--and then
you shook hands coldly, and departed!--Always this air of secrecy
and mystery, Frank!" the boy went on angrily. "That's always the
way it is with you--in everything you do! And yet you wonder why
people are surprised at your behaviour! For weeks at a time I see
you every day. We get together in your rooms and talk and argue
about everything on earth. You come and yell for me in my place
at midnight and then we walk all over Cambridge in the dead of
night. We go over to Posillippo's place in Boston and eat and
drink and get drunk together, and when you pass out, I bring you
home and carry you upstairs and put you to bed. Then the next
day, when I come round again," the boy cried bitterly, "what has
happened? I ring the bell. Your voice comes through the place as
cold as hell--'Who is it?' you say. 'Why,' I say, 'it's your old
friend and drunken companion, Eugene Gant, who brought you home
last night.'--'I'm sorry,' you say, in a tone that would freeze a
polar bear--'I can't see you. I'm busy now'--and then you hang up
in my face. The season of the great mystery has now begun," he
went on sarcastically. "The great man is closeted in his sanctum
<i>composing,"</i> he sneered. "Not <i>writing,</i> mind you, but
<i>composing</i> with a gold-tipped quill plucked from the wing
of a Brazilian condor--so, out, out, damned spot--don't bother
me, Gant--begone, you low fellow--on your way, burn!--the great
master, Signor Francis Starwick, is upstairs in a purple cloud,
having a few immortal thoughts today with Amaryllis, his pet
muse--"</p>

<p>"Gene! Gene!" said Starwick laughing, a trace of the
old-mannered accent returning to his voice again. "You are
<i>most</i> unfair! You really are, you know!"</p>

<p>"No--but, Frank, that's just the way you act," the other said.
"You can't see enough of someone for weeks at a time and then you
slam the door in his face. You pump your friends dry and tell
them nothing about yourself. You try to surround everything you
do with this grand romantic air of mysterious secrecy--this
there's-more-to-this-than-meets-the-eye manner. Frank, who the
hell do you think you are, anyway, with these grand airs and
mysterious manners that you have? Is it that you're not the same
as other men?" he jeered. "Is it that, like C&aelig;sar, you were
from your mother's womb untimely ripped? Is it that you are made
from different stuff than the damned base clay of blood and agony
from which the rest of us have been derived?"</p>

<p>"What have I ever done," said Starwick flushing, "to give you
the impression that I think of myself that way?"</p>

<p>"For one thing, Frank, you act sometimes as if the world
exists solely for the purpose of being your oyster. You sometimes
act as if friendship, the affection of your friends, is something
that exists solely for your pleasure and convenience and may be
turned on and off at will like a hot-water faucet--that you can
use their time, their lives, their feelings when they amuse and
interest you--and send them away like whipped dogs when you are
bored, tired, indifferent, or have something else it suits you
better to do."</p>

<p>"I am not aware that I have ever done that," said Starwick
quietly. "I am sorry if you think I have."</p>

<p>"No, but, Frank--what can you expect your friends to think? I
have told you about my life, my family, the kind of place and
people I came from--but you have told me nothing. You are the
best friend I have here in Cambridge--I think," the boy said
slowly, flushing, and with some difficulty, "one of the best
friends I have ever had. I have not had many friends--I have
known no one like you--no one of my own age to whom I could talk
as I have talked to you. I think I enjoy being with you and
talking to you more than to anyone I have ever known. This
friendship that I feel for you has now become a part of my whole
life and has got into everything I do. And yet, at times, I run
straight into a blank wall. I could no more separate my
friendship for you from the other acts and meetings of my life
than I could divide into two parts of my body my father's and my
mother's blood. With you it's different. You seem to have all
your friends partitioned off and kept separate from one another
in different cells and sections of your life. I know now that you
have three or four sets of friends and yet these different groups
of people never meet one another. You go about your life with all
these different sets of people in this same secret and mysterious
manner that characterizes everything you do. You have these aunts
and cousins here in Cambridge that you see every week, and who,
like everyone else, lay themselves out to do everything they can
to make your life comfortable and pleasant. You know these swells
over on Beacon Hill in Boston, and you have some grand,
mysterious and wealthy kind of life with them. Then you have
another group here at the university--people like Egan, and Hugh
Dodd and myself. And at the end, Frank," the boy said almost
bitterly--"what is the purpose of all this secrecy and separation
among your friends? There's something so damned arrogant and cold
and calculating about it--it's almost as if you were one of these
damned, wretched, self-centred fools who have their little time
and place for everything--an hour for social recreation and an
hour for useful reading, another hour for healthy exercise, and
then four hours for business, an hour for the concert and an hour
for the play, an hour for 'business contracts' and an hour for
friendship--Surely to God, Frank, you of all people on earth are
not one of these damned, smug, vain, self-centred egoists--who
would milk this earth as if it were a great milk cow here solely
for their enrichment, and who, at the end, in spite of all their
damned, miserable, self-seeking profit for themselves remain
nothing but the God-damned smug, sterile, misbegotten set of
impotent and life-hating bastards that they are--Surely to God,
you, of all people in the world, are not one of these," he fairly
yelled, and sat there panting, exhausted by the tirade, and
glaring at the other youth with wild, resentful eyes.</p>

<p>"Eugene!" cried Starwick sharply, his ruddy features darkened
with an angry glow. "You are being most unjust! What are you
saying simply is not true." He was silent a moment, his face red
and angry-looking, as he stared out across the river--"If I had
known that you felt this way," he went on quietly, "I should have
introduced you to my other friends--what you call these separate
groups of people--long ago. You may meet them any time you wish,"
he concluded. "It simply never occurred to me that you would be
interested in knowing them."</p>

<p>"Oh, Frank, I'm not!" the other boy cried impatiently, with a
dismissing movement of the hand. "I don't want to meet them--I
don't care who they are--or how rich and fashionable or
'artistic' they may be. The thing I was kicking about was what
seemed to me to be your air of secrecy--the mysterious manner in
which you go about things: it seemed to me that there was
something deliberately calculating and secretive in the way you
shut one part of your life off from the people who know and like
you best."</p>

<p>Starwick made no answer for a moment, but sat looking out
across the river. And for a moment, the old grimace of bestial,
baffled pain passed swiftly across his ruddy features, and then
he said, in a quiet and weary tone:</p>

<p>"Perhaps you are right. I had never thought about it in that
way. Yes, I can see now that you have told me much more about
yourself--your family, your life before you came here--than I
have told you about mine. And yet it never occurred to me that I
was being mysterious or secretive. I think it is easier for you
to speak about these things than it is for me. There is a great
river of energy in you and it keeps bursting over and breaking
loose. You could not hold it back if you tried. With me, it's
different. I have not got that great well of life and power in
me, and I could not speak as you do if I tried. Yet, Gene, if
there is anything you want to know about my life before I came
here, or what kind of people I came from, I would tell you
willingly."</p>

<p>"I have wanted to know more about you, Frank," the other young
man said. "All that I know about your life before you came here
is that you come from somewhere in the Middle West, and yet are
completely different from anyone I ever knew who came from
there."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Starwick quietly. "From Horton, for example?" his
tone was still quiet, but there was a shade of irony in it.</p>

<p>"Well," the other boy said, flushing, but continuing
obstinately, "--yes, from Horton. He is from Iowa; you can see,
smell, read, feel Iowa all over him, in everything he says and
does--"</p>

<p>"'It's--a--<i>darn</i>--<i>good--yarn,'"</i> said Starwick,
beginning to burble with laughter as he imitated the heavy,
hearty, sonorous robustiousness of Horton's voice when he
pronounced his favourite judgment.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Eugene, laughing at the imitation, "that's it, all
right--'it's a <i>darn good yarn.'</i> Well, Frank, you couldn't
be more different from Horton if you had come from the planet
Mars, and yet the place you came from out there in the Middle
West, the kind of life you knew when you were growing up, could
not have been so different from Ed Horton's."</p>

<p>"No," said Starwick quietly. "As a matter of fact, I know
where he is from--it's not over fifty miles from the town I was
born in, which is in Illinois, and the life in both places is
much the same."</p>

<p>He was silent a moment longer, as he stared across the river,
and then continued in a quiet voice that had a calm, weary, and
almost inert detachment that characterized these conversations
with his friend, and that was almost entirely free of mannered
speech:</p>

<p>"As to the kind of people that we came from," he continued, "I
can't say how different they may be, but I should think it very
likely that Horton's people are much the same kind of people as
my own--"</p>

<p>"His father is a Methodist minister," the other young man
quickly interposed. "He told me that."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Starwick in his quiet and inert voice--"and Horton
is the rebel of the family." His tone had not changed apparently
in its quality by an atom, yet the quiet and bitter irony with
which he spoke was evident.</p>

<p>"How did you know that?" the other youth said in a surprised
tone. "Yes--that's true. His wife told me that Ed and his father
are scarcely on speaking terms--the old man prays for the
salvation of Ed's soul three times a day, because he is trying to
write plays and wants to get into the theatre. Effie Horton says
Ed's father still writes Ed letters begging him to repent and
mend his ways before his soul is damned for ever: she says the
old man calls the theatre the Devil's Workshop."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Starwick in his quiet and almost lifeless tone
that still had curiously the cutting edge of a weary and detached
sarcasm--"and Horton has bearded the Philistines in their den,
hasn't he, and given all for art?"</p>

<p>"Isn't that a bit unjust? I know you don't think very highly
of Ed Horton's ability, but, after all, the man must have had
some genuine desire to create something--some real love for the
theatre--or he would not have broken with his family and come
here."</p>

<p>"Yes. I suppose he has. Many people have that desire," said
Starwick wearily. "Do you think it is enough?"</p>

<p>"No, I do not. And yet I think a man who has it is better
off--will have a better life, somehow--than the man who does not
have it at all."</p>

<p>"Do you?" Starwick answered in a dead tone. "I wish I thought
so, too."</p>

<p>"But don't you, Frank? Surely it is better to have some kind
of talent, however small, than none at all."</p>

<p>"Would you say, then," Starwick answered, "that it was better
to have some kind of child--however puny, feeble, ugly, and
diseased--as King Richard said about himself, brought into the
world 'scarce half made up'--than to have no child at all?"</p>

<p>"I would not think so. No."</p>

<p>"Have you ever thought, Eugene, that the great enemy of life
may not be death, but life itself?" Starwick continued. "Have you
never noticed that the really evil people that one meets--the
people who are filled with hatred, fear, envy, rancour against
life--who wish to destroy the artist and his work--are not
figures of satanic darkness, who have been born with a malignant
hatred against life, but rather people who have had the seeds of
life within themselves and been destroyed by them? They are the
people who have been given just enough to get a vision of the
promised land--however brief and broken it may be--"</p>

<p>"But not enough to get there? Is that what you mean?"</p>

<p>"Exactly," Starwick answered. "They are left there in the
desert, maddened by the sight of water they can never reach, and
all the juices of their life then turn to gall and bitterness--to
envy and malignant hate. They are the old women in the little
towns and villages with the sour eyes and the envenomed flesh who
have so poisoned the air with their envenomed taint that
everything young and beautiful and full of joy that lives there
will sicken and go dead and vicious and malignant as the air it
breathes. They are the lecherous and impotent old men of the
world, those foul, palsied creatures with small rheumy eyes who
hate the lover and his mistress with the hate of hell and
eunuchry--who try to destroy love with their hatred and the
slanderous rumour of their poisoned tongues. And, finally, they
are the eunuchs of the arts--the men who have the lust, without
the power, for creation, and whose life goes dead and rotten with
its hatred of the living artist and the living man."</p>

<p>"And you think that Horton will be one of these?"</p>

<p>Again Starwick was silent for a moment, staring out across the
river. When he spoke again, he did not answer his companion's
question directly, but in a quiet and inert tone in which the
cutting edge of irony was barely evident, he said:</p>

<p>"My <i>God!</i> Eugene"--his voice was so low and wearily
passionate with revulsion that it was almost inaudible--"if ever
you may come to know, as I have known all my life, the falseness
in a hearty laugh, the envy and the malice in a jesting word, the
naked hatred in a jeering eye, and all the damned, warped,
poisonous constrictions of the heart--the horrible fear and
cowardice and cruelty, the naked shame, the hypocrisy, and the
pretence, that are masked there behind the full hearty tones, the
robust manliness of the Hortons of this earth . . ." He was
silent a moment longer, and then went on in a quiet,
matter-of-fact tone--"I was the youngest in a family of nine
children--the same kind of family that you will find everywhere.
I was the only delicate flower among them," he went on with a
cold impassive irony. "We were not rich people . . . a big family
growing up with only a small income to support us. They were all
good people," he said quietly. "My father was superintendent of a
small farm-machinery plant, and before that they were farming
people, but they sent me to school, and after that to college. I
was the 'bright boy' of the town"--again the weary irony of his
voice was evident--"the local prodigy, the teacher's pet. . . .
Perhaps that is my destiny; to have something of the artist's
heart, his soul, his understanding, his perceptions--never to
have his power, the hand that shapes, the tongue that can
express--oh, God! Eugene! is <i>that</i> to be my life--to have
all that I know and feel and would create rot still-born in my
spirit, to be a wave that breaks for ever in mid-ocean, the
shoulder of a strength without the wall--my God! My God! to come
into this world scarce half made up, to have the spirit of the
artist and to lack his hide, to feel the intolerable and
unspeakable beauty, mystery, loveliness, and terror of this
immortal land--this great America--and a skin too sensitive, a
hide too delicate and rare--" his voice was high and bitter with
his passion--"to declare its cruelty, its horror, falseness,
hunger, the warped and twisted soul of its frustration, and
lacking hide and toughness, born without a skin, to make an
armour, school a manner, build a barrier of my own against its
Hortons--"</p>

<p>"And is that why--?" the other boy began, flushed, and quickly
checked himself.</p>

<p>"Is that why--what?" said Starwick, turning, looking at him.
Then as he did not answer, but still remained silent, flushed
with embarrassment, Starwick laughed, and said: "Is that why I am
an affected person--a poseur--what Horton calls a 'damned little
&aelig;sthete'--why I speak and act and dress the way I do?"</p>

<p>The other flushed miserably and muttered:</p>

<p>"No, I didn't say that, Frank!"</p>

<p>Starwick laughed suddenly, his infectious and spontaneous
laugh, and said:</p>

<p>"But why not? Why shouldn't you say it? Because it is the
truth. It really is, you know," and almost mockingly at these
words, his voice assumed its murmured and affected accent. Then
he said quietly again:</p>

<p>"Each man has his manner--with each it comes for his own
reason--Horton's, so that his hearty voice and robust way may
hide the hatred in his eyes, the terror in his heart, the
falseness and pretence in his pitiable warped small soul. He has
his manner, I have mine--his for concealment, mine for armour,
because my native hide was tender and my skin too sensitive to
meet the Hortons of the earth--and somewhere, down below our
manner, stands the naked man." Again he was silent and in a
moment he continued quietly:</p>

<p>"My father was a fine man and we never got to know each other
very well. The night before I went away to college he 'took me to
one side' and talked to me--he told me how they had their hearts
set on me, and he asked me to become a good and useful man--a
good American."</p>

<p>"And what did you say, Frank?"</p>

<p>"Nothing. There was nothing I could say. . . . Our house
stands on a little butte above the river," he went on quietly in
a moment, "and when he had finished talking I went out and stood
there looking at the river."</p>

<p>"What river, Frank?"</p>

<p>"There is only one," he answered. "The great slow river--the
dark and secret river of the night--the everlasting flood--the
unceasing Mississippi. . . . It is a river that I know so well,
with all my life that I shall never tell about. Perhaps you will
some day--perhaps you have the power in you--And if you do--" he
paused.</p>

<p>"And if I do?"</p>

<p>"Speak one word for a boy who could not speak against the
Hortons of this land, but who once stood above a river--and who
knew America as every other boy has known it." He turned,
smiling: "If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart, absent thee
from felicity awhile, and in this harsh world draw thy breath in
pain, to tell my story."</p>

<p>In a moment he got up, and laughing his infectious laugh,
said:</p>

<p>"Come on, let's go."</p>

<p>And together they walked away.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>October had come again, and that year it was sharp and soon:
frost was early, burning the thick green on the mountain sides to
massed brilliant hues of blazing colours, painting the air with
sharpness, sorrow and delight--and with October. Sometimes, and
often, there was warmth by day, an ancient drowsy light, a golden
warmth and pollenated haze in afternoon, but over all the earth
there was the premonitory breath of frost, an exultancy for all
the men who were returning, a haunting sorrow for the buried men
and for all those who were gone and would not come again.</p>

<p>His father was dead, and now it seemed to him that he had
never found him. His father was dead, and yet he sought him
everywhere, and could not believe that he was dead, and was sure
that he would find him. It was October and that year, after years
of absence and of wandering, he had come home again.</p>

<p>He could not think that his father had died, but he had come
home in October, and all the life that he had known there was
strange and sorrowful as dreams. And yet he saw it all in shapes
of deathless brightness--the town, the streets, the magic hills,
and the plain prognathous faces of the people he had known. He
saw them all in shapes of deathless brightness, and everything
was instantly familiar as his father's face, and stranger, more
phantasmal than a dream.</p>

<p>Their words came to him with the accents of an utter
naturalness, and yet were sorrowful and lost and strange like
voices speaking in a dream, and in their eyes he read a lost and
lonely light, as if they were all phantoms and all lost, or as if
he had revisited the shores of this great earth again with a
heart of fire, a cry of pain and ecstasy, a memory of intolerable
longing and regret for all the glorious and exultant life that he
had known and which he must visit now for ever as a fleshless
ghost, never to touch, to hold, to have its palpable warmth and
substance for his own again. He had come home again, and yet he
could not believe his father was dead, and he thought he heard
his great voice ringing in the street again, and that he would
see him striding toward him across the Square with his gaunt
earth-devouring stride, or find him waiting every time he turned
the corner, or lunging toward the house bearing the tremendous
provender of his food and meat, bringing to them all the
deathless security of his strength and power and passion,
bringing to them all again the roaring message of his fires that
shook the fire-full chimney-throat with their terrific blast,
giving to them all again the exultant knowledge that the good
days, the magic days, the golden weather of their lives would
come again, and that this dreamlike and phantasmal world in which
they found themselves would waken instantly, as it had once, to
all the palpable warmth and glory of the earth, if only his
father would come back to make it live, to give them life,
again.</p>

<p>Therefore, he could not think that he was dead, and yet it was
October, and that year he had come home again. And at night, in
his mother's house, he would lie in his bed in the dark, hearing
the wind that rattled dry leaves along the empty pavement,
hearing, far-off across the wind, the barking of a dog, feeling
dark time, strange time, dark secret time, as it flowed on around
him, remembering his life, this house, and all the million
strange and secret visages of time, dark time, thinking, feeling,
thinking:</p>

<p>"October has come again, has come again. . . . I have come
home again and found my father dead . . . and that was time . . .
time . . . time. . . . Where shall I go now? What shall I do? For
October has come again, but there has gone some richness from the
life we knew, and we are lost."</p>

<p>Storm shook the house at night--the old house, his mother's
house--where he had seen his brother die. The old doors swung and
creaked in darkness, darkness pressed against the house, the
darkness filled them, filled the house at night, it moved about
them soft and secret, palpable, filled with a thousand secret
presences of sorrowful time and memory, moving about him as he
lay below his brother's room in darkness, while storm shook the
house in late October, and something creaked and rattled in the
wind's strong blast. It was October, and he had come home again:
he could not believe that his father was dead.</p>

<p>Wind beat at them with burly shoulders in the night. The
darkness moved there in the house like something silent,
palpable--a spirit breathing in his mother's house, a demon and a
friend--speaking to him its silent and intolerable prophecy of
flight, of darkness and the storm, moving about him constantly,
prowling about the edges of his life, ever beside him, with him,
in him, whispering:</p>

<p>"Child, child--come with me--come with me to your brother's
grave tonight. Come with me to the places where the young men lie
whose bodies have long since been buried in the earth. Come with
me where they walk and move again tonight, and you shall see your
brother's face again, and hear his voice, and see again, as they
march toward you from their graves the company of the young men
who died, as he did, in October, speaking to you their messages
of flight, of triumph, and the all-exultant darkness, telling you
that all will be again as it was once."</p>

<p>October had come again, and he would lie there in his mother's
house at night, and feel the darkness moving softly all about
him, and hear the dry leaves scampering on the street outside,
and the huge and burly rushes of the wind. And then the wind
would rush away with huge caprice, and he could hear it far off
roaring with remote demented cries in the embraces of great
trees, and he would lie there thinking:</p>

<p>"October has come again--has come again"--feeling the dark
around him, not believing that his father could be dead,
thinking: "The strange and lonely years have come again. . . . I
have come home again . . . come home again . . . and will it not
be with us all as it has been?"--feeling the darkness as it moved
about him, thinking: "Is it not the same darkness that I knew in
childhood, and have I not lain here in bed before and felt this
darkness moving all about me? . . . Did we not hear dogs that
barked in darkness, in October?" he then thought. "Were not their
howls far broken by the wind? . . . And hear dry leaves that
scampered on the streets at night . . . and the huge and burly
rushes of the wind . . . and hear huge limbs that stiffly creak
in the remote demented howlings of the burly wind . . . and
something creaking in the wind at night . . . and think, then, as
we think now, of all the men who have gone and never will come
back again, and of our friends and brothers who lie buried in the
earth? . . . Oh, has not October now come back again?" he cried.
"As always--as it always was?"--and hearing the great darkness
softly prowling in his mother's house at night, and thinking,
feeling, thinking, as he lay there in the dark:</p>

<p>"Now October has come again which in our land is different
from October in the other lands. The ripe, the golden month has
come again, and in Virginia the chinkapins are falling. Frost
sharps the middle music of the seasons, and all things living on
the earth turn home again. The country is so big you cannot say
the country has the same October. In Maine, the frost comes sharp
and quick as driven nails; just for a week or so the woods, all
of the bright and bitter leaves, flare up: the maples turn a
blazing bitter red, and other leaves turn yellow like a living
light, falling about you as you walk the woods, falling about you
like small pieces of the sun, so that you cannot say where
sunlight shakes and flutters on the ground and where the
leaves.</p>

<p>"Meanwhile the Palisades are melting in massed molten colours,
the season swings along the nation, and a little later in the
South dense woodings on the hill begin to glow and soften, and
when they smell the burning wood-smoke in Ohio children say:
'I'll bet that there's a forest fire in Michigan.' And the
mountaineer goes hunting down in North Carolina; he stays out
late with mournful flop-eared hounds, a rind of moon comes up
across the rude lift of the hills: what do his friends say to him
when he stays out late? Full of hoarse innocence and laughter,
they will say: 'Mister, yore ole woman's goin' to whup ye if ye
don't go home.'"</p>

<p>Oh, return, return!</p>

<p>"October is the richest of the seasons: the fields are cut,
the granaries are full, the bins are loaded to the brim with
fatness, and from the cider-press the rich brown oozings of the
York Imperials run. The bee bores to the belly of the yellowed
grape, the fly gets old and fat and blue, he buzzes loud, crawls
slow, creeps heavily to death on sill and ceiling, the sun goes
down in blood and pollen across the bronzed and mown fields of
old October.</p>

<p>"The corn is shocked: it sticks out in hard yellow rows upon
dried ears, fit now for great red barns in Pennsylvania and the
big stained teeth of crunching horses. The indolent hooves kick
swiftly at the boards, the barn is sweet with hay and leather,
wood and apples--this, and the clean dry crunching of the teeth
is all: the sweat, the labour, and the plough are over. The late
pears mellow on a sunny shelf; smoked hams hang to the warped
barn rafters; the pantry shelves are loaded with 300 jars of
fruit. Meanwhile the leaves are turning, turning, up in Maine,
the chestnut burrs plop thickly to the earth in gusts of wind and
in Virginia the chinkapins are falling.</p>

<p>"There is a smell of burning in small towns in afternoon, and
men with buckles on their arms are raking leaves in yards as boys
come by with straps slung back across their shoulders. The oak
leaves, big and brown, are bedded deep in yard and gutter: they
make deep wadings to the knee for children in the streets. The
fire will snap and crackle like a whip, sharp acrid smoke will
sting the eyes, in mown fields the little vipers of the flame eat
past the black coarse edges of burned stubble like a line of
locusts. Fire drives a thorn of memory in the heart.</p>

<p>"The bladed grass, a forest of small spears of ice, is thawed
by noon: summer is over but the sun is warm again, and there are
days throughout the land of gold and russet. But summer is dead
and gone, the earth is waiting, suspense and ecstasy are gnawing
at the hearts of men, the brooding prescience of frost is there.
The sun flames red and bloody as it sets, there are old red
glintings on the battered pails, the great barn gets the ancient
light as the boy slops homeward with warm foaming milk. Great
shadows lengthen in the fields, the old red light dies swiftly,
and the sunset barking of the hounds is faint and far and full of
frost: there are shrewd whistles to the dogs, and frost and
silence--this is all. Wind stirs and scuffs and rattles up the
old brown leaves, and through the night the great oak leaves keep
falling.</p>

<p>"Trains cross the continent in a swirl of dust and thunder,
the leaves fly down the tracks behind them: the great trains
cleave through gulch and gulley, they rumble with spoked thunder
on the bridges over the powerful brown wash of mighty rivers,
they toil through hills, they skirt the rough brown stubble of
shorn fields, they whip past empty stations in the little towns
and their great stride pounds its even pulse across America.
Field and hill and lift and gulch and hollow, mountain and plain
and river, a wilderness with fallen trees across it, a thicket of
bedded brown and twisted undergrowth, a plain, a desert, and a
plantation, a mighty landscape with no fenced niceness, an
immensity of fold and convolution that can never be remembered,
that can never be forgotten, that has never been described--weary
with harvest, potent with every fruit and ore, the immeasurable
richness embrowned with autumn, rank, crude, unharnessed,
careless of scars or beauty, everlasting and magnificent, a cry,
a space, an ecstasy!--American earth in old October.</p>

<p>"And the great winds howl and swoop across the land: they make
a distant roaring in great trees, and boys in bed will stir in
ecstasy, thinking of demons and vast swoopings through the earth.
All through the night there is the clean, the bitter rain of
acorns, and the chestnut burrs are plopping to the ground.</p>

<p>"And often in the night there is only the living silence, the
distant frosty barking of a dog, the small clumsy stir and
feathery stumble of the chickens on limed roosts, and the moon,
the low and heavy moon of autumn, now barred behind the leafless
poles of pines, now at the pine-woods' brooding edge and summit,
now falling with ghost's dawn of milky light upon rimed clods of
fields and on the frosty scurf on pumpkins, now whiter, smaller,
brighter, hanging against the steeple's slope, hanging the same
way in a million streets, steeping all the earth in frost and
silence.</p>

<p>"Then a chime of frost-cold bells may peal out on the brooding
air, and people lying in their beds will listen. They will not
speak or stir, silence will gnaw the darkness like a rat, but
they will whisper in their hearts:</p>

<p>"'Summer has come and gone, has come and gone. And now--?' But
they will say no more, they will have no more to say: they will
wait listening, silent and brooding as the frost, to time,
strange ticking time, dark time that haunts us with the briefness
of our days. They will think of men long dead, of men now buried
in the earth, of frost and silence long ago, of a forgotten face
and moment of lost time, and they will think of things they have
no words to utter.</p>

<p>"And in the night, in the dark, in the living sleeping silence
of the towns, the million streets, they will hear the thunder of
the fast express, the whistles of great ships upon the river.</p>

<p>"What will they say then? What will they say?"</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Only the darkness moved about him as he lay there thinking,
feeling in the darkness: a door creaked softly in the house.</p>

<p>"October is the season for returning: the bowels of youth are
yearning with lost love. Their mouths are dry and bitter with
desire: their hearts are torn with the thorns of spring. For
lovely April, cruel and flowerful, will tear them with sharp joy
and wordless lust. Spring has no language but a cry; but crueller
than April is the asp of time.</p>

<p>"October is the season for returning: even the town is born
anew," he thought. "The tide of life is at the full again, the
rich return to business or to fashion, and the bodies of the poor
are rescued out of heat and weariness. The ruin and horror of the
summer are forgotten--a memory of hot cells and humid walls, a
hell of ugly sweat and labour and distress and hopelessness, a
limbo of pale greasy faces. Now joy and hope have revived again
in the hearts of millions of people, they breathe the air again
with hunger, their movements are full of life and energy. The
mark of their summer's suffering is still legible upon their
flesh, there is something starved and patient in their eyes, and
a look that has a child's hope and expectation in it.</p>

<p>"All things on earth point home in old October: sailors to
sea, travellers to walls and fences, hunters to field and hollow
and the long voice of the hounds, the lover to the love he has
forsaken--all things that live upon this earth return, return:
Father, will you not, too, come back again?</p>

<p>"Where are you now, when all things on the earth come back
again? For have not all these things been here before, have we
not seen them, heard them, known then, and will they not live
again for us as they did once, if only you come back again?</p>

<p>"Father, in the night-time, in the dark, I have heard the
thunder of the fast express. In the night, in the dark, I have
heard the howling of the winds among great trees, and the sharp
and windy raining of the acorns. In the night, in the dark, I
have heard the feet of rain upon the roofs, the glut and gurgle
of the gutter spouts, and the soaking gulping throat of all the
mighty earth, drinking its thirst out in the month of May--and
heard the sorrowful silence of the river in October. The
hill-streams foam and welter in a steady plunge, the mined clay
drops and melts and eddies in the night, the snake coils cool and
glistening under dripping ferns, the water roars down past the
mill in one sheer sheet-like plunge, making a steady noise like
wind, and in the night, in the dark, the river flows by us to the
sea.</p>

<p>"The great maw slowly drinks the land as we lie sleeping: the
mined banks cave and crumble in the dark, the earth melts and
drops into its tide, great horns are baying in the gulph of
night, great boats are baying at the river's mouth. Thus,
darkened by our dumpings, thickened by our stains, rich, rank,
beautiful, and unending as all life, all living, the river, the
dark immortal river, full of strange tragic time is flowing by
us--by us--by us--to the sea.</p>

<p>"All this has been upon the earth and will abide for ever. But
you are gone; our lives are ruined and broken in the night, our
lives are mined below us by the river, our lives are whirled away
into the sea and darkness and we are lost unless you come to give
us life again.</p>

<p>"Come to us, Father, in the watches of the night, come to us
as you always came, bringing to us the invincible sustenance of
your strength, the limitless treasure of your bounty, the
tremendous structure of your life that will shape all lost and
broken things on earth again into a golden pattern of exultancy
and joy. Come to us, Father, while the winds howl in the
darkness, for October has come again, bringing with it huge
prophecies of death and life and the great cargo of the men who
will return. For we are ruined, lost, and broken if you do not
come, and our lives, like rotten chips, are whirled about us
onward in darkness to the sea."</p>

<p>So, thinking, feeling, speaking, he lay there in his mother's
house, but there was nothing in the house but silence and the
moving darkness: storm shook the house and huge winds rushed upon
them, and he knew then that his father would not come again and
that all the life that he had known was now lost and broken as a
dream.</p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h1>XL</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>During the whole course of that last October--the last October
he would spend at home--he was waiting day by day with a
desperation of wild hope for a magic letter--one of those magic
letters for which young men wait, which are to bring them
instantly the fortune, fame, and triumph for which their souls
thirst and their hearts are panting, and which never come.</p>

<p>Each morning he would get up with a pounding heart, trembling
hands, and chattering lips, and then, like a man in prison who is
waiting feverishly for some glorious message of release or pardon
which he is sure will come that day, he would wait for the coming
of the postman. And when he came, even before he reached the
house, the moment that Eugene heard his whistle he would rush out
into the street, tear the mail out of his astounded grasp, and
begin to hunt through it like a madman for the letter which would
announce to him that fortune, fame, and glittering success were
his. He was twenty-two years old, a madman and a fool, but every
young man in the world has been the same.</p>

<p>Then, when the wonderful letter did not come, his heart would
sink down to his bowels like lead; all of the brightness, gold,
and singing would go instantly out of the day and he would stamp
back into the house, muttering to himself, sick with despair and
misery and thinking that now his life was done for, sure enough.
He could not eat, sleep, stand still, sit down, rest, talk
coherently, or compose himself for five minutes at a time. He
would go prowling and muttering around the house, rush out into
the streets of the town, walk up and down the main street,
pausing to talk with the loafers before the principal drug store,
climb the hills and mountains all around the town and look down
on the town with a kind of horror and disbelief, an awful
dreamlike unreality because the town, since his long absence and
return to it, and all the people in it, now seemed as familiar as
his mother's face and stranger than a dream, so that he could
never regain his life or corporeal substance in it, any more than
a man who revisits his youth in a dream, and so that, also, the
town seemed to have shrunk together, got little, fragile,
toy-like in his absence, until now when he walked in the street
he thought he was going to ram his elbows through the walls, as
if the walls were paper, or tear down the buildings, as if they
had been made of straw.</p>

<p>Then he would come down off the hills into the town again, go
home, and prowl and mutter around the house, which now had the
same real-unreal familiar-strangeness that the town had, and his
life seemed to have been passed there like a dream. Then, with a
mounting hope and a pounding heart, he would begin to wait for
the next mail again; and when it came, but without the letter,
this furious prowling and lashing about would start all over
again. His family saw the light of madness in his eyes and in his
disconnected movements, and heard it in his incoherent speech. He
could hear them whispering together, and sometimes when he looked
up he could see them looking at him with troubled and bewildered
faces. And yet he did not think that he was mad, nor know how he
appeared to them.</p>

<p>Yet, during all this time of madness and despair his people
were as kind and tolerant as anyone on earth could be.</p>

<p>His mother, during all this time, treated him with kindness
and tolerance, and according to the law of her powerful, hopeful,
brooding, octopal, and web-like character, with all its
meditative procrastination, never coming to a decisive point, but
weaving, re-weaving, pursing her lips, and meditating constantly
and with a kind of hope, even though in her deepest heart she
really had no serious belief that he could succeed in doing the
thing he wanted to do.</p>

<p>Thus, as he talked to her sometimes, going on from hope to
hope, his enthusiasm mounting with the intoxication of his own
vision, he would paint a glittering picture of the fame and
wealth he was sure to win in the world as soon as his play was
produced. And his mother would listen thoughtfully, pursing her
lips from time to time, in a meditative fashion, as she sat
before the fire with her hands folded in a strong loose clasp
above her stomach. Then, finally, she would turn to him and with
a proud, tremulous, and yet bantering smile playing about her
mouth, such as she had always used when he was a child, and had
perhaps spoken of some project with an extravagant enthusiasm,
she would say:</p>

<p>"Hm, boy! I tell you what!" his mother said, in this bantering
tone, as if he were still a child. "That's mighty big talk--as
the sayin' goes,"--here she put one finger under her broad red
nose-wing and laughed shyly, but with pleasure--"as the sayin'
goes, mighty big talk for poor folks!" said his mother. "Well,
now," she said in a thoughtful and hopeful tone, after a moment's
pause, "you may do it, sure enough. Stranger things than that
have happened. Other people have been able to make a success of
their writings--and there's one thing sure!" His mother cried out
strongly with the loose, powerful and manlike gesture of her hand
and index finger which was characteristic of all her
family--"there's one thing sure!--what one man has done another
can do if he's got grit and determination enough!" His mother
said, putting the full strength of her formidable will into these
words--"Why, yes, now!" she now said, with a recollective start,
"Here, now! Say!" she cried--"wasn't I reading?--didn't I see?
Why, pshaw!--yes! just the other day--that all these big
writers--yes, sir! Irvin S. Cobb--there was the very feller!"
cried his mother in a triumphant tone--"Why, you know," she
continued, pursing her lips in a meditative way, "--that he had
the very same trials and tribulations--as the sayin' goes--as
everyone else! Why, yes!--here he told it on himself--admitted
it, you know--that he kept writin' these stories for years,
sendin' them out, I reckon, to all the editors and magazines--and
having them all sent back to him. That's the way it was," she
said, "and now--look at him! Why, I reckon they'd pay him
hundreds of dollars for a single piece--yes! and be glad of the
chance to get it," said his mother.</p>

<p>Then for a space his mother sat looking at the fire, while she
slowly and reflectively pursed her lips.</p>

<p>"Well," she said slowly at length, "you may do it. I hope you
do. Stranger things than that have happened.--Now, there's one
thing sure," she said strongly, "you have certainly had a good
education--there's been more money spent upon your schoolin' than
on all the rest of us put together--and you certainly ought to
know enough to write a story or a play!--Why, yes, boy! I tell
you what," his mother now cried in the old playful and bantering
tone, as if she were speaking to a child, "if I had <i>your</i>
education I believe I'd try to be a writer, too! Why, yes! I
wouldn't mind getting out of all this drudgery and house-work for
a while--and if I could earn my living doin' some light easy work
like that, why, you can bet your bottom dollar, I'd do it!" cried
his mother. "But, say, now! See here!" his mother cried with a
kind of jocose seriousness--"maybe that'd be a good idea, after
all! Suppose you write the stories," she said, winking at
him,--"and I tell, you what I'll do!--Why, I'll <i>tell</i> 'em
to you! Now, if I had your education and your command of
language," said his mother, whose command of language was all
that anyone could wish--"I believe I could tell a pretty good
story--so if you'll write 'em out," she said, with another wink,
"I'll tell you what to write--and I'll <i>bet</i> you--I'll
<i>bet</i> you," said his mother, "that we could write a story
that would beat most of these stories that I read, all to pieces!
Yes, sir!" she said, pursing her lips firmly, and with an
invincible conviction--"and I bet you people would buy that story
and come to see that play!" she said. "Because I know what to
tell 'em and the kind of thing people are interested in hearing,"
she said.</p>

<p>Then for a moment more she was silent and stared thoughtfully
into the fire.</p>

<p>"Well," she said slowly, "you may do it. You may do it, sure
enough! Now, boy," she said, levelling that powerful index finger
toward him, "I want to tell you! Your grandfather, Tom Pentland,
was a remarkable man--and if he'd had your education he'd a-gone
far! And everyone who ever knew him said the same! . . . Oh!
stories, poems, pieces in the paper--why, didn't they print
something of his every week or two!" she cried. "And that's
exactly where you get it," said his mother. "--But, say, now,"
she said in a persuasive tone, after a moment's meditation, "I've
been thinkin'--it just occurred to me--wouldn't it be a good idea
if you could find some work to do--I mean, get you a job
somewheres of some light easy work that would give you plenty of
time to do your writin' as you went on! Now, Rome wasn't built in
a day, you know!" his mother said in the bantering tone, "--and
you might have to send that play around to several places before
you found the one who could do it right for you! So while you're
waitin'," said his mother persuasively, "why, wouldn't it be a
good idea if you got a little light newspaper work, or a job
teachin' somewheres--pshaw! you could do it easy as falling off a
log," his mother said contemptuously. "I taught school myself
before I got married to your papa, and I didn't have a bit of
trouble! And all the schoolin' I ever had--all the schoolin' that
I ever had," she cried impressively, "was six months one time in
a little backwoods school! Now if I could do it, there's one
thing sure, with all your education you ought to be able to do
it, too! Yes, sir, that's the very thing!" she said. "I'd do it
like a shot if I were you."</p>

<p>He said nothing, and his mother sat there for a moment looking
at the fire. Suddenly she turned, and her face had grown troubled
and sorrowful and her worn and faded eyes were wet with tears.
She stretched her strong rough hand out and put it over his,
shaking her head a little before she spoke:</p>

<p>"Child, child!" she said. "It worries me to see you act like
this! I hate to see you so unhappy! Why, son," his mother said,
"what if they shouldn't take it now! You've got long years ahead
of you and if you can't do it now, why, maybe, some day you will!
And if you don't!" his mother cried out strongly and formidably,
"why, Lord, boy, what about it! You're a young man with your
whole life still before you--and if you can't do this thing, why,
there are other things you can do! . . . Pshaw! boy, your life's
not ended just because you find out that you weren't cut out to
be a playwriter," said his mother, "There are a thousand things a
young man of your age could do! Why, it wouldn't bother me for a
moment!" cried his mother.</p>

<p>And he sat there in front of her invincible strength, hope,
and fortitude and her will that was more strong than death, her
character that was as solid as a rock; he was as hopeless and
wretched as he had ever been in his life, wanting to say a
thousand things to her and saying none of them, and reading in
her eyes the sorrowful message that she did not believe he would
ever be able to do the thing on which his heart so desperately
was set.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>At this moment the door opened and his brother entered the
room. As they stared at him with startled faces, he stood there
looking at them out of his restless, tormented grey eyes,
breathing his large and unhappy breath of unrest and nervousness,
a harassed look on his handsome and generous face, as with a
distracted movement he thrust his strong, impatient fingers
through the flashing mop of his light brown hair, that curled
everywhere in incredible whorls and screws of angelic
brightness.</p>

<p>"Hah?" his mother sharply cried, as she looked at him with her
white face, the almost animal-like quickness and concentration of
her startled attention. "What say?" she said in a sharp startled
tone, although as yet his brother had said nothing.</p>

<p>"W-w-w-wy!" he began in a distracted voice, as he thrust his
fingers through his incredible flashing hair and his eyes
flickered about absently and with a tormented and driven look, "I
was just f-f-f-finkin'--" he went on in a dissonant and confused
tone; then, suddenly catching sight of her white startled face,
he smote himself suddenly and hard upon his temple with the
knuckle of one large hand, and cried out "Haw!" in a tone of such
idiotic exuberance and exultancy that it is impossible to
reproduce in words the limitless and earthly vulgarity of its
humour. At the same time he prodded his mother stiffly in the
ribs with his clumsy fingers, an act that made her shriek out
resentfully, and then say in a vexed and fretful tone:</p>

<p>"I'll vow, boy! You act like a regular idiot! If I didn't have
any more sense than to go and play a trick like that--I'd be
ash-a-a-med--ash-a-a-a-med," she whispered, with a puckered
mouth, as she shook her head at him in a movement of strong
deprecation, scorn, and reproof. "I'd be <i>ashamed</i> to let
anyone know I was such a fool," his mother said.</p>

<p>"Whah! <i>Whah!"</i> Luke shouted with his wild, limitlessly
exuberant laugh, that was so devastating in its idiotic exultancy
that all words, reproaches, scorn, or attempts at reason were
instantly reduced to nothing by it. "Whee!" he cried, prodding
her in her resentful ribs again, his handsome face broken by his
huge and exuberant smile. Then, as if cherishing something secret
and uncommunicably funny in its idiotic humour, he smote himself
upon the forehead again, cried out, "Whah--<i>Whah!"</i> and
then, shaking his grinning face to himself in this movement of
secret and convulsive humour, he said: "Whee! Go-o-d-damn!" in a
tone of mincing and ironic refinement.</p>

<p>"Why, what on earth has got into you, boy?" his mother cried
out fretfully. "Why, you're actin' like a regular simpleton, I'll
vow you are!"</p>

<p>"Whah! <i>Whah!"</i> Luke cried exultantly.</p>

<p>"Now, I don't know where it comes from," said his mother
judicially, with a deliberate and meditative sarcasm, as if she
were seriously considering the origin of his lunacy. "There's one
thing sure: you never got it from me. Now, all my people had
their wits about them--now, say what you please," she went on in
a thoughtful tone, as she stared with puckered mouth into the
fire, "I never heard of a weak-minded one in the whole
crowd--"</p>

<p>"Whah--<i>whah!"</i> he cried.</p>

<p>"--So you didn't get it from any of my people," she went on
with deliberate and telling force--"no, you didn't!" she
said.</p>

<p><i>"Whah-h!"</i> he prodded her in the ribs again, and then
immediately, and in a very earnest tone, he said:</p>

<p>"W-w-w-wy, I was just f-f-f-finkin' it would be a good idea if
we all w-w-w-went for a little ride. F-f-f-frankly, I fink it
would do us good," he said, looking at Eugene with a very earnest
look in his restless and tormented eyes. "I fink we need it!
F-f-f-frankly, I fink we do," he said, and then added abruptly
and eagerly as he thrust his clumsy fingers through his hair:
"W-w-w-wy, what do you say?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes!" his mother responded with an instant alacrity as
she got up from her chair. "That's the very thing! A little
breath of fresh air is just the thing we need--as the feller
says," she said, turning to Eugene now and beginning to laugh
slyly, and with pleasure, passing one finger shyly underneath her
broad red nose-wing as she spoke--, "as the feller says, it costs
nothin' and it's Nature's sovereign remedy, good for man and good
for beast!--So let's all get out into the light of open day
again," she said with rhetorical deliberation, "and breathe in
God's fresh air like He intended we should do--for there's one
thing sure," his mother went on in tones of solemn warning, which
seemed directed to a vast unseen audience of the universe rather
than to themselves, "there's one thing sure--you can't violate
the laws of God or nature," she said decisively, "or you'll pay
for it--as sure as you're born. As sure as you're born," she
whispered. "Why, yes, now!"--she went on, with a start of
recollective memory--"Here now!--Say!--Didn't I see it--wasn't I
readin'?--Why, here, you know, the other day," she went on
impatiently, as if the subject of these obscure broken references
must instantly be clear to everyone--"why, it was in the paper,
you know--this article written by Doctor Royal S. Copeland," his
mother said, nodding her head with deliberate satisfaction over
his name, and pronouncing the full title sonorously with the
obvious satisfaction that titles and distinctions always gave
her--"that's who it was all right, sayin' that fresh air was the
thing that everyone must have, and that all of us should take
good care to--"</p>

<p>"Now, M-m-m-m-mama," said Luke, who had paid no attention at
all to what she had been saying, but had stood there during all
the time she was speaking, breathing his large, weary, and
unhappy breath, thrusting his clumsy fingers through his hair, as
his harassed and tormented eyes flickered restlessly about the
room in a driven but unseeing stare:--"Now, M-m-m-mama!" he said
in a tone of exasperated and frenzied impatience, "if we're
g-g-g-going we've g-g-g-got to get started! N-n-n-now I d-d-don't
mean next W-w-w-w-Wednesday," he snarled, with exasperated
sarcasm, "I d-d-d-don't m-m-m-mean the fifteenth of next July.
But--<i>now</i>--<i>now</i>--<i>now,"</i> he muttered crazily,
coming to her with his large hands lifted like claws, the fingers
working, and with a look of fiendish madness in his eyes.</p>

<p>"Now!" he whispered hoarsely. "This week! Today! This
afternoon! A-a-a-a-at once!" he barked suddenly, jumping at her
comically; then thrusting his hand through his hair again, he
said in a weary and exasperated voice:</p>

<p>"M-m-m-mama, will you please get ready? I b-b-b-beg of you. I
beseech you--<i>please!"</i> he said, in tortured entreaty.</p>

<p><i>"All</i> right! <i>All</i> right!" his mother replied
instantly in a tone of the heartiest and most conciliatory
agreement. "I'll be ready in five minutes! I'll just go back here
and put on a coat over this old dress--so folks won't see me,"
she laughed shyly, "an' I'll be ready before you know it!--Pshaw,
boy!" she now said in a rather nettled tone, as if the
afterthought of his impatience had angered her a little, "now you
don't need to worry about <i>my</i> being ready," she said,
"because when the time comes--I'll be <i>there</i>!<i>"</i> she
said, with the loose, deliberate, man-like gesture of her right
hand and in tones of telling deliberation. "Now you worry about
yourself!" she said. "For I'll be ready before <i>you</i>
are--yes, and I'm never late for an appointment, either," she
said strongly, "and that's more than <i>you</i> can say--for I've
seen you miss 'em time an' time again."</p>

<p>During all this time Luke had been thrusting his fingers
through his hair, breathing heavily and unhappily, and pawing and
muttering over a mass of thumbed envelopes and papers which were
covered with the undecipherable scrawls and jottings of his
nervous hand: "T-t-t-Tuesday," he muttered, "Tuesday . . .
Tuesday in
Blackstone--B-b-b-b-Blackstone--Blackstone--Blackstone, South
Car'lina," he muttered in a confused and distracted manner, as if
these names were completely meaningless to him, and he had never
heard them before. "Now--<i>ah</i>!<i>"</i> he suddenly sang out
in a rich tenor voice, as he lifted his hand, thrust his fingers
through his hair, and stared wildly ahead of him--"meet Livermore
in Blackstone Tuesday morning--see p-p-p-p-prospect in
G-g-g-g-Gadsby Tuesday afternoon
about--about--about--Wheet!"--here he whistled sharply, as he
always did when he hung upon a word--"about a new set of
batteries for his Model X--Style 37--lighting system--which the
cheap p-p-p-penny-pinching South Car'lina bastard w-w-w-wants for
nothing--Wednesday m-m-m-morning b-b-b-back to
Blackstone--F'ursday . . . w-w-w-wy," he muttered pawing clumsily
and confusedly at his envelopes with a demented
glare--"F-f-f-f-f'ursday--you--ah--j-j-j-jump over to
C-c-c-Cavendish to t-t-t-try to persuade that ignorant red-faced
nigger-Baptist son of a bitch that it's f-f-f-for his own
b-b-b-best interests to scrap the-the-w-w-w-wy the d-d-d-decrepit
pile of junk he's been using since S-s-s-Sherman marched through
Georgia and b-b-b-buy the new X50 model T Style 46
transmission--</p>

<p>"M-m-m-mama!" he cried suddenly, turning toward her with a
movement of frenzied and exasperated entreaty. "Will you
<i>please</i> kindly have the g-g-g-goodness and the m-m-m-mercy
to do me the favour to b-b-b-begin to commence--w-w-w-w-wy--to
start--to make up your mind--to get ready," he snarled bitterly.
"W-w-w-w-wy sometime before midnight--I b-b-b-beg of you . . . I
beseech you . . . I ask it of you p-p-p-<i>please!</i> for
<i>my</i> sake--for <i>all</i> our sakes--for <i>God's</i> sake!"
he cried with frenzied and maddened desperation.</p>

<p><i>"All</i> right! <i>All</i> right!" his mother cried hastily
in a placating and reassuring tone, beginning to move with an
awkward, distracted, bridling movement that got her nowhere,
since there were two doors to the parlour and she was trying to
go out both of them at the same time. <i>"All</i> right!" she
said decisively, at length getting started toward the door
nearest her. "I'll just go back there an' slip on a coat--and
<i>I'll be with you</i> in a jiffy!" she said with comforting
assurance.</p>

<p>"If you <i>please!"</i> Luke said with an ironic and tormented
obsequiousness of entreaty, as he fumbled through his mass of
envelopes. "If you <i>please!</i> W-w-w-wy I'd certainly be
m-m-m-m-much obliged to you if you would!" he said.</p>

<p>At this moment, however, a car halted at the curb outside,
someone got out, and in a moment more they could hear Helen's
voice, as she came towards the house, calling back to her husband
in tones of exasperated annoyance:</p>

<p>"All <i>right!</i> Hugh! All <i>right!</i> I'm
coming!"--although she was really going toward the house. "Will
you <i>kindly</i> leave me alone for just a moment? Good heavens!
Will I never get a little peace? All right! All right! I'm
coming! For God's sake, leave me <i>alone</i> for just five
minutes, or you'll drive me crazy!" she stormed, and with a
high-cracked note of frenzied strain and exasperation that was
almost like hysteria.</p>

<p>"All right, Mr. Barton," she now said to her husband in a more
good-humoured tone. "Now you just hold your horses for a minute
and I'll come on out. The house is not going to burn down before
we get there."</p>

<p>His lean, seamed, devoted face broke into a slow, almost
unwilling grin, in which somehow all of the submission, loyalty
and goodness of his soul was legible, and Helen turned, came up
on the porch, opened the hall door, and came into the parlour
where they were, beginning to speak immediately in a tone of
frenzied and tortured exacerbation of the nerves and with her
large, gaunt, liberal features strained to the breaking point of
nervous hysteria.</p>

<p>"My <i>God</i>!<i>"</i> she said in a tone of weary
exasperation. "If I don't get away from them soon I'm going to
lose my mind! . . . From the moment that I get up in the morning
I never get a moment's peace! Someone's after me all day long
from morn to night! Why, good heavens, Mama!" she cried out in a
tone of desperate fury, and as if Eliza had contradicted
something she had said, "I've got troubles enough of my own,
without anyone else putting theirs on me! Have they got no one
else they can go to? Haven't they got homes of their own to look
after? Do I have to bear the burden of it all for everyone
<i>all</i> my life?" she stormed in a voice that was so hoarse,
strained and exasperated now that she was almost weeping. "Do I
have to be the goat <i>all</i> my life? Oh, I want a little
peace," she cried desperately, "I just want to be left alone by
myself once in a while!--The rest of you don't have to worry!"
she said accusingly. "You don't have to stand for it. You can get
away from it!" she cried. "You don't know--you don't
<i>know!"</i> she said furiously, "what I put up with--but if I
don't get away from it soon, I'm going all to pieces."</p>

<p>During all the time that Helen had been pouring out her tirade
of the wrongs and injuries that had been inflicted on her, Luke
had acted as a kind of dutiful and obsequious chorus, punctuating
all the places where she had to pause to pant for breath, with
such remarks as--</p>

<p>"W-w-w-w-well, you d-d-do too much for everyone and they don't
appreciate it--that's the trouble," or, "I f-f-f-f-fink I'd tell
them all to p-p-p-p-politely step to hell--f-f-frankly I fink you
owe it to yourself to do it! W-w-w-wy you'll only w-w-w-wear
yourself out doing for others and in the end you d-d-d-don't get
so m-m-m-much as one good Goddamn for all your trouble!
F-f-f-frankly, I mean it!" he would say with a very earnest look
on his harassed and drawn face. "W-w-w-wy hereafter I'd let 'em
g-g-g-g-go to hell!"</p>

<p>--"If they'd only show a little appreciation once in a while I
wouldn't mind so much," she panted. "But do you think they care?
Do you think it ever occurs to them to lift a hand to help me
when they see me working my fingers to the bone for them?
Why"--and here her big-boned generous face worked
convulsively--"if I should work myself to death for them, do you
think any of them would even so much as send a bunch of flowers
to the funeral?"</p>

<p>Luke laughed with jeering scorn: "W-w-w-wy," he said, "it is
to laugh! It is to laugh! They w-w-wouldn't send a
G-g-g-g-God-damn thing--n-n-n-not even a ten-cent b-b-b-bunch
of-of-w-w-w-w-wy--of turnip-greens!" he said.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>"All <i>right!</i> All <i>right!"</i> Helen again cried
furiously through the door, as Barton sounded a long imperative
blast of protest and impatience on his horn. "All <i>right!</i>
Hugh! I'm coming! Good heavens, can't you leave me in peace for
just five minutes? . . . Hugh, <i>please!</i> Please!" she
stormed in a tone of frenzied exasperation as he sourly answered
her. "Give me a little time alone, I beg of you--or I'll go
mad!"--And she turned to them again, panting and with the racked
and strained expression of hysteria on her big-boned features. In
a moment, her harassed and driven look relaxed somewhat, and the
big rough bawdy smile began to shape itself again around the
corners of her generous mouth.</p>

<p>"My God, Mama," she said in a tone of quiet and weary despair,
but with this faint lewd smile about her mouth and growing deeper
as she spoke, "what am I going to do about it? Will you please
tell me that? Did you have to put up with that when you and Papa
were together? Is that the way it is? Is there no such thing as
peace and privacy in this world? Now, I'd like to know. When you
marry one of them, does that mean that you'll never get a
moment's peace or privacy alone as long as you live? Now, there
are some things you like to do alone"--she said, and by this time
the lewd smile had deepened perceptibly around her mouth. "Why,
it's got so," she said, "that I'm almost afraid to go to the
bathroom any more--"</p>

<p>"Whew-w!" shrieked Eliza, laughing, putting one finger
underneath her nose.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," Helen said quietly, with the lewd smile now deep
and loose around her mouth. "I've just got so I'm almost afraid
to go, I don't know from one moment to the next whether one of
them is going to come in and keep me company or not."</p>

<p>"Whew!" Eliza cried. "Why, you'll have to put up signs! 'No
Visitors Allowed!'--that's exactly what you ought to say! I'd fix
'em! I'd do it like a shot," she said.</p>

<p>Helen sniggered hoarsely, and absently began to pluck at her
chin.</p>

<p>"But <i>oh!"</i> she said with a sigh. "If only they'd leave
me alone an hour a day! If only I could get away for just an
hour--"</p>

<p>"W-w-w-wy!" Luke began. "Why don't you c-c-come with us!
F-f-f-frankly, I fink you ought to do it! I fink the change would
do you good," he said.</p>

<p>"Why?" she said rather dully, yet curiously. "Where are you
going?"</p>

<p>"W-w-w-wy," he said, "we were just starting for a little ride.
. . . Mama!" he burst out suddenly in a tone of exasperated
entreaty--"Will you k-k-k-kindly go and get yourself ready?
W-w-wy, it's g-g-g-going to get d-d-d-dark before we get
started," he said bitterly, as if she had kept him waiting all
this time. "Now, <i>please</i>--I b-b-b-beg of you--to g-g-g-get
ready--wy-wy-wy without f-f-f-further delay--now, I ask it of
you, for God's sake!" he said, and then turning to Helen with a
movement of utter exasperation and defeat, he shuddered
convulsively, thrust his fingers through his hair, and moaned
"Ah-h-h-h-h-h!" after which he began to mutter "My God! My God!
My God!"</p>

<p>"All <i>right,</i> sir! All <i>right!"</i> Eliza said briskly,
in a conciliatory tone. "I'll just go right back there and put my
coat and hat on and I won't keep you waitin' <i>five</i>--"</p>

<p>"Wy, wy, wy. If you p-p-please, Mama," said Luke with a
tortured and ironic bow. "If you p-p-please."</p>

<p>At length, they really did get out of the house and were
assembled on the curb in the last throes of departure. Luke,
breathing stertorously his large unhappy breath, began to walk
about his battered little car, casting uneasy and worried looks
at it and falling upon it violently from time to time, kicking it
in the tyres with his large flat feet, smiting it with a broad
palm and seizing it by the sides and shaking it so savagely that
its instant dissolution seemed inevitable. Meanwhile Eliza stood
planted solidly, facing her house, her hands clasped loosely at
the waist and her powerful and delicate mouth pursed reflectively
as she surveyed her property--a characteristic gesture that
always marked every departure from the house and every return to
it, in which the whole power and relish of possession were
evident. As for Barton, while these inevitable ceremonies were
taking place, he just sat in his car with a kind of sour resigned
patience, and waited. And Helen, while this was going on, had
taken Eugene by the arm and walked a few paces down the street
with him, talking all the time in a broken and abstracted way, of
which the reference could only be inferred:</p>

<p>"You see, don't you? . . . You see what I've got to put up
with, don't you? . . . You only get it for a little while when
you come here, but with me it's <i>all</i> the time and
<i>all</i> the time"--Suddenly she turned to him, looked him
directly in the eye, and speaking quietly to him, but with a
curious, brooding and disturbing inflection in her voice, she
said:</p>

<p>"Do you know what day this is?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Do you realize that Ben died five years ago this morning?--I
was thinking of it yesterday when she was talking about getting
that room ready for those people who are coming," she muttered,
and with a note of weary bitterness in her voice. For a moment
her big-boned face was marked with the faint tension of hysteria,
and her eyes looked dark and lustreless and strained as she
plucked absently at her large chin. "But do you see how she can
do it?" she went on in a low tone of brooding and weary
resignation. "Do you understand how she can ever bear to go back
in there? Do you see how she can rent that room out to any cheap
lodger who comes along? Do you realize that she's got the same
bed in there he died on," she said morbidly, "the same
mattress?--K-k-k-k-k-k!" she laughed softly and huskily, poking
at his ribs. "She'll have you sleeping on it next--"</p>

<p>"I'll be damned if she does!"</p>

<p>"K-k-k-k-k-k-k!"</p>

<p>"Do you think I could be sleeping on it now?" Eugene said with
a feeling of black horror and dread around his heart.</p>

<p>"K-k-k-k-k-k!" she snickered. "Would you like that? Would you
sleep better if you knew it was? . . . No," she said quietly,
shaking her head. "Uh-uh! I don't think so. It's still up there
in the same room. She may have painted the bed, but otherwise I
don't think she's changed a thing. Have you ever been back up
there since he died?" she said curiously.</p>

<p>"My <i>God,</i> no! Have you?"</p>

<p>She shook her head: "Not I," she said with weary finality.
"I've never even been upstairs since that morning. . . . Hugh
hates the place," she muttered, looking towards him. "He doesn't
even like to stop and wait for me. He won't come in."</p>

<p>Then she was silent for a moment as they looked at the gaunt
ugly bay of the room upstairs where Ben had died. In the yard the
maple trees were thinning rapidly; the leaves were sere and
yellow and were floating to the ground. And the old house stood
there in all its ugly, harsh, and prognathous bleakness, its
paint of rusty yellow scaling from it in patches, and weathered
and dilapidated as Eugene had never seen it before, but
incredibly near, incredibly natural and familiar, so that all its
ghosts of pain and grief and bitterness, its memories of joy and
magic and lost time, the thousand histories of all the vanished
people it had sheltered, whom all of them had known, revived
instantly with an intolerable and dream-like strangeness and
familiarity.</p>

<p>And now, as they looked up at the bleak windows of the room in
which he died, the memory of his death's black horror passed
across their souls a minute, and then was gone, leaving them only
with the fatality of weary resignation which they had learned
from it. In a moment, with a look of ancient and indifferent
weariness and grief in her eyes, Helen turned to him, and with a
faint rough smile around her mouth, said quietly:</p>

<p>"Does he ever bother you at night?--When the wind begins to
howl around the house, do you ever hear him walking up there? Has
he been in to see you yet?--K-k-k k-k-k!" she poked him with her
big stiff finger, laughing huskily, and then in a low, sombrely
brooding tone, as if the grisly suggestion were his, she shook
her head, saying:</p>

<p>"Forget about it! They don't come back, Eugene! I used to
think they did, but now I know they never do.--He won't come,"
she muttered, as she shook her head. "Forget about it. He won't
come. Just forget about it," she continued, looking at Eliza with
weary resignation. "It's not her fault. I used to think that you
could change them. But you can't. Uh-uh!" she muttered, plucking
at her large cleft chin. "It can't be done. They never
change."</p>

<p>Luke stood distractedly for a moment on the curbstone,
breathing his large unhappy breath and thrusting his clumsy
fingers strongly through the flashing whirls and coils of his
incredible hair.</p>

<p>"Now--ah!" he sang out richly. "Let me see! I--wy--I fink!
M-m-m-mama, if you <i>please!"</i> he said. "Wy if you
<i>please!"</i> with an exasperated and ironic
obsequiousness.</p>

<p>She had been standing there, planted squarely on the sidewalk,
facing her house. She stood with her hands clasped loosely across
her stomach, and as she looked at the gaunt weathered shape of
the old house, her mouth was puckered in an expression of
powerful rumination in which the whole terrible legend of blood
and hunger and desperate tenacity--the huge clutch of property
and possession which, with her, was like the desperate clutch of
life itself--was evident.</p>

<p>What was this great claw in her life--this thing that was
stronger than life or death or motherhood--which made her hold on
to anything which had ever come into her possession, which made
her cling desperately to everything which she had ever owned--old
bottles, papers, pieces of string, worn-out gloves with all the
fingers missing, frayed cast-off sweaters which some departed
boarder had left behind him, postcards, souvenirs, sea-shells,
coco-nuts, old battered trunks, dilapidated furniture which could
be no longer used, calendars for the year 1906, showing coy
maidens simpering sidewise out beneath the crisply ruffled
pleatings of a Japanese parasol--a mountainous accumulation of
old junk for which the old dilapidated house had now become a fit
museum.</p>

<p>Then in the wink of an eye she would pour thousands of dollars
after the crazy promises of boom-town real-estate speculation
that by comparison made the wildest infatuation of a drunken
race-track gambler look like the austere process of a coldly
reasoning mind.</p>

<p>Even as she stood there staring at her house with her pursed
mouth of powerful and ruminant satisfaction, another evidence of
this madness of possession was staring in their face. At the end
of the alley slope, behind the house, there was a dilapidated old
shed or house of whitewashed boards, which had been built in
earlier times as a carriage house. Now through the open entrance
of this shed they could see the huge and dusty relic of Eliza's
motor car. She had bought it four years before, and bought it
instantly one day before they knew about it, and paid $2000 in
hard cash for it--and why she bought it, what mad compulsion of
her spirit made her buy it, no one knew, and least of all
Eliza.</p>

<p>For from that day to this that car had never left the carriage
house. Year by year, in spite of protest, oaths, and prayers, and
all their frantic pleading, she had got no use from it herself,
and would let no one else use it. No, what is more, she had even
refused to sell it later, although a man had made her a good
offer. Rather she pursed her lips reflectively, smiled in a
bantering fashion, and said evasively: "Well, I'll see now! I'll
think it over!--I want to study about it a little--you come back
later and I'll let you know! . . . I want to think about it!"--as
if, by hanging on to this mass of rusty machinery, she hoped it
would increase in value and that she could sell it some day for
twice the price she paid for it, if only she "held on" long
enough.</p>

<p>And at first they had all wrestled by turns with the octopal
convolutions of her terrific character, exhausting all the
strength and energy in them against the substance of a will that
was like something which always gave and never yielded, which
could be grasped, compressed, and throttled in the hard grip of
their furious hands, only to bulge out in new shapes and forms
and combinations--which flowed, gave, withdrew, receded and
advanced, but which remained itself for ever, and beat everything
before it in the end.</p>

<p>Now, for a moment, as Luke saw the car he was goaded into the
old madness of despair. Thrusting his fingers through his hair,
and with a look of desperate exasperation in his tortured eyes,
he began: "M-m-m-mama--M-m-m-mama--I beg of you, I--wy I entreat
you,--w-w-w-wy I <i>beseech</i> you either to s-s-s-sell that
God-damn thing or--wy--g-g-g-get a little s-s-service out of
it."</p>

<p>"Well, now," Eliza said quickly and in a conciliatory tone,
"we'll see about it!"</p>

<p>"S-s-s-see about it!" he stammered bitterly. "See about it! In
G-g-g-God's name, what is there to see about? M-m-m-mama, the
car's there--there--there--" he muttered crazily, poking his
clumsy finger in a series of jerky and convulsive movements in
the direction of the carriage house. "It's <i>there!"</i> he
croaked madly. "C-c-c-can't you understand that? W-w-w-wy, it's
rotting away on its God-damn wheels--M-m-m-mama, will you
<i>please</i> get it into your head that it's not g-g-g-going to
do you or anyone else any good unless you take it out and use
it?"</p>

<p>"Well, as I say now"--she began hastily, and in a diplomatic
tone of voice.</p>

<p>"M-m-m-m-mama"--he began, again thrusting at his hair--"wy, I
beg of you--I beseech you to sell it, g-g-g-give it away, or
wy-wy-wy try to get a little use out of it!--Let me take it out
and drive you round the block in it--w-w-w-wy--just once! Just
once! F-f-f-frankly, I'd like to have the satisfaction of knowing
you'd had <i>that</i> much out of it!" he said. "Wy, I'll
p-p-p-pay for the p-p-p-petrol, if that's what's worrying you!
Wy, I'll do it with pleasure! . . . But just let me take it out
of that G-g-g-g-God-damn place if all--if all--wy if all I do is
drive you to the corner! Now, <i>please!"</i> he begged, with an
almost frantic note of entreaty.</p>

<p>"Why, no, boy!" she cried out in a startled tone. "We can't do
that!"</p>

<p>"C-c-c-can't do that!" he stuttered bitterly. "Wy, in
G-g-g-g-God's name, why can't we?"</p>

<p>"I'd be <i>afra-a-id!"</i> she said with a little troubled
smile, as she shook her head. "Hm! I'd be
<i>afraid</i>!<i>"</i></p>

<p>"Wy-wy-wy-wy <i>afraid?"</i> he yelled. "Wy, what's there to
be afraid of, in God's name?"</p>

<p>"I'd be afraid you'd <i>do</i> something to it," she said with
her troubled smile. "I'd be afraid you'd smash it up or run over
someone with it. No, child," she said gravely, as she shook her
head. "I'd be afraid to let you drive it. You're too
nervous."</p>

<p>"Ah-h-h-h-h-h!" he breathed clutching convulsively in his hair
as his eyes flickered madly about in his head. "Ah-h-h-h-h!
M-m-m-merciful God!" he muttered. "M-m-m-m-m-merciful God!"--and
then laughed wildly, frantically, and bitterly.</p>

<p>Now Helen spoke curiously, plucking reflectively at her large
chin, but with weariness and resignation in her accent as if
already she knew the answer:</p>

<p>"Mama, what are you going to do with your car? It seems a
shame to let it rot away back there after you've paid out all
that money for it. Aren't you going to try to get any use out of
it at all?"</p>

<p>"Well, now, as I say," Eliza began smugly, pursing her lips
with ruminative relish as she looked into the air, "I'm just
waitin' for the chance--I'm just waitin' till the first fine day
to come along--and then, I've got a good notion to take that
thing out and learn to run it myself."</p>

<p>"Oh, Mama," Helen began quietly and wearily, "good
heavens--"</p>

<p>"Why, yes!" Eliza cried nodding her head briskly. "I could do
it! Now, I can do most anything when I make my mind up to it! Now
I've never seen anything yet I couldn't do if I had to! . . . So
I'm just waitin' until spring comes round again, and I'm goin' to
take that car out and drive it all around," she said. "I'm just
goin' to sit up there an' enjoy the scenery an' have a big time,"
said Eliza with her little tremulous smile. "That's what I'm
goin' to do," she said.</p>

<p>"All right," Helen said wearily. "Have it your own way. Do as
you please: it's your own funeral! Only it seems a shame to let
it go to waste after you've spent all that money on it."</p>

<p>But turning to Eugene, and speaking in a lowered tone, she
said to him, with the faint tracing of hysteria on her big-decent
face and weariness and resignation in her voice:</p>

<p>"Well, what are you going to do about it? I used to think that
you could change her, but now I know she never will. . . . I've
given up trying. It's no use," she muttered. "It's no use. I
worked my fingers to the bone to help them save a copper--and you
see what comes of it. . . . I did the work of a nigger in the
kitchen from the time I was ten years old--and you see what comes
of it, don't you? I went off and sang my way around the country
in cheap moving-picture shows . . . and came up here and waited
on the tables to help feed a crowd of cheap boarders--and Luke
sold <i>The Saturday Evening Post,</i> and peddled hot dogs and
toy balloons--and you got up at three o'clock, carried the
morning paper--and they let Ben go to hell until his lungs were
gone and it was too late--and you see what it all comes to in the
end, don't you? . . . It's all given away to real-estate men or
thrown away for motor cars they never use. I've given up
worrying," she said. "I don't think about it any more. . . . They
don't change," she muttered. "I used to think they did, but now I
know they don't. Uh-uh! They don't change! . . . Well, forget
about it," and she turned wearily away.</p>

<p>The year Eliza bought the car, Eugene was eighteen years old
and was a Junior at the State University. When he came home that
year he asked her if she would let him learn to drive it. It was
about the time when everyone in town was beginning to own motor
cars. When he walked up town everyone he knew would drive by him
in a car. Everyone on earth was beginning to live upon a wheel.
Somehow it gave him a naked and desolate feeling, as if he had
nowhere to go and no door to enter. When he asked her if she
would let him take the car out and learn to drive it, she had
looked at him a moment with her hands clasped loosely at the
waist, her head cocked quizzically to one side, and the little
tremulous and bantering smile that had always filled him with
such choking exasperation and wordless shame, and somehow with a
nameless and intolerable pity, too, because behind it he felt
always her high white forehead and her faded, weak, and childlike
eyes, the naked intelligence, whiteness, and immortal innocence
of the child that was looking straight through the mask of years
with all the deathless hope and faith and confidence of her life
and character.</p>

<p>Now, for the last time, he asked her again the question he had
asked with such an earnest hope so many times before. And
instantly, as if he had dreamed her answer, she replied--the same
reply that she had always made, the only reply the invincible
procrastination of her soul could make.</p>

<p>"Hm!" she said, making the bantering and humming noise in her
throat as she looked at him. <i>"Wha-a-a-t</i>! Why, you're my
<i>ba-a-a-by!"</i> she said with jesting earnestness, as she laid
her strong worn hand loosely on his shoulder. "No, sir!" she said
quickly and quietly, shaking her head in a swift sideways
movement. "I'd be <i>afra-a-id,</i> afraid," she whispered.</p>

<p>"Mama, afraid of what?"</p>

<p>"Why, child," she said gravely, "I'd be afraid you'd go and
hurt yourself. Uh-uh!" she shook her head quickly and shortly.
"I'd be afraid to let you try it--well, we'll see," she said,
turning it off easily in an evasive and conciliatory tone. "We'll
see about it. I'd like to study about it a little first."</p>

<p>After that there was nothing to do except to curse and beat
their fists into the wall. And after that there was nothing to do
at all. She had beaten them all, and they knew it. Their curses,
prayers, oaths, persuasions and strangled cries availed them
nothing. She had beaten them all, and finally they spoke no more
to her or to themselves about her motor car: the gigantic folly
of that mad wastefulness evoked for them all memories so painful,
desolate and tragic--a memory of the fatality of blood and nature
which could not be altered, of the done which could be undone
never, and of the web of fate in which their lives were
meshed--that they knew there was no guilt, no innocence, no
victory, and no change. They were what they were, and they had no
more to say.</p>

<p>So was it now as she stood planted there before her house. As
she had grown older, her body had grown clumsier with the
shapeless heaviness of age: as she stood there with her hands
clasped in this attitude of ruminant relish, she seemed to be
planted solidly on the pavement and somehow to own, inhabit, and
possess the very bricks she walked on. She owned the street, the
pavement, and finally her terrific ownership of the house was as
apparent as if the house were living and could speak to her. For
the rest of them that old bleak house had now so many memories of
grief and death and intolerable, incurable regret that in their
hearts they hated it; but although she had seen a son strangle to
death in one of its bleak rooms, she loved the house as if it
were a part of her own life--as it was--and her love for it was
greater than her love for anyone or anything else on earth.</p>

<p>And yet, for her, even if that house, the whole world, fell in
ruins around her, there could be no ruin--her spirit was as
everlasting as the earth on which she walked, and could not be
touched--no matter what catastrophes of grief, death, tragic
loss, and unfulfilment might break the lives of other men--she
was triumphant over the ravages of time and accident, and would
be triumphant to her death. For there was only the inevitable
fulfilment of her own destiny--and ruin, loss, and death availed
not--she would be fulfilled. She had lived ten lives, and now she
was embarked upon another one, and so it had been ordered in the
beginning: this was all that mattered in the end.</p>

<p>But now, Luke, seeing her, as she stood planted there in
all-engulfing rumination, thrust his hands distractedly through
his shining hair again, and cried to her with exasperated
entreaty:</p>

<p>"W-w-w-wy, Mama, if you <i>please!</i> I b-b-b-beg of you and
<i>beseech</i> you, if you <i>please!"</i></p>

<p>"I'm <i>ready!"</i> Eliza cried, starting and turning from her
powerful contemplation of her house. "This very minute, sir! Come
on!"</p>

<p>"Wy, if you p-p-p<i>-please!"</i> he muttered, thrusting at
his hair.</p>

<p>They walked towards his car, which he had halted in the
alley-way beside the house. A few leaves, sere and yellow, from
the maples in the yard were drifting slowly to the ground.</p>

<p> </p>

<h1>XLI</h1>

<p> </p>

<p>During all that time, when he was waiting with a desperate
hope that rose each day to the frenzy of a madman's certitude,
and sank each day to the abyss of his despair, for the magic
letter which was coming to him from the city, and which would
instantly give him all the fortune, fame, and triumph for which
his soul was panting, his family looked at him with troubled
question in their eyes. His enthusiastic hopes and assurances of
the great success that he would have from writing plays seemed
visionary and remote to them. Perhaps they were right about this,
although the reason that they had for thinking so was wrong.</p>

<p>Thus, although they said little to Eugene at this time about
his plans for the future, and what they did say was meant to
hearten him, their doubt and disbelief were evident, and
sometimes when he came into the house he could hear them talking
in a troubled way about him.</p>

<p>"Mama," he heard his sister say one day, as she sat talking
with his mother in the kitchen, "what does Gene intend to do?
Have you heard him say yet?"</p>

<p>"Why, no-o-o!" his mother answered slowly, in a puzzled and
meditative tone. "He hasn't said. At least he says he's goin' to
write plays,--of course, I reckon he's waiting to hear from those
people in New York about that play he's written," she added
quickly.</p>

<p>"Well, I know," his sister answered wearily. "That's all very
fine--if he can do it. But, good heavens, Mama!" she cried
furiously--"you can't live on hope like that! Gene's only one out
of a million! Can't you realize that?--Why, they used to think I
had some talent as a singer"--here she laughed ironically, a
husky high falsetto, "I used to think so myself--but you don't
notice that it ever got me anywhere, do you? No, sir!" she said
positively. "There are thousands more just like Gene, who are
trying to get ahead and make a name for themselves. Why should he
think he's any better than the rest of them? Why, it might be
years before he got a play produced--and even then, how can he
tell that it would be a success?--What's he going to live on?
How's he going to keep going until all this happens? What's he
going to do?--You know, Mama, Gene's no little boy any more.
Please get that into your head," she said sharply, as if her
mother had questioned the accuracy of her remark. "No, sir! No,
sir!" she laughed ironically and huskily. "Your baby is a grown
man, and it's time he waked up to the fact that he's got to
support himself from now on.--Mama, do you realize that it has
been over four months since Gene left Harvard and, so far as I
can see, he has made no effort yet to get a job? What does he
intend to do?" she said angrily. "You know, he just can't mope
around like this <i>all</i> his days! Sooner or later he's got to
find some work to do!"</p>

<p>In all these words there was apparent not so much hostility
and antagonism as the driving fury and unrest of Helen's nervous,
exacerbated, dissonant, and unhappy character, which could lavish
kindness and affection one moment and abuse and criticism the
next. These were really only signs of the frenzy and unrest in
her large, tortured, but immensely generous spirit. Thus, she
would rage and storm at her husband at one moment for "moping
about the house," telling him, "for heaven's sake am I never to
be left alone? Am I never to get a moment's peace or quiet? Must
I have you around me every moment of my life? In God's name,
Hugh--go! go! go!--Leave me alone for a few minutes, I beg of
you!"--and by this time his sister's voice would be cracked and
strident, her breath coming hoarsely and almost with a sob of
hysteria. And yet, she could be just as violent in her sense of
wrong and injustice done to her if she thought he was giving too
much time to business, rushing through his meals, reading a book
when he should be listening to her tirade, or staying away from
home too much.</p>

<p>Poor, tortured, and unhappy spirit, with all the grandeur,
valour, and affection that Eugene knew so well, it had found,
since her father's death, no medicine for the huge and constant
frenzy of its own unrest, no guide or saviour to work for it the
miracle of salvation it must work itself, and it turned and
lashed out at the world, demanding a loneliness which it could
not have endured for three days running, a peace and quiet from
its own fury, a release from its own injustice. And it was for
this reason--because her own unrest and frenzy made her lash out
constantly against the world, praising one week, condemning the
next, accusing life and people of doing her some injury or wrong
that she had done herself--it was for this reason, more than for
any other, that Helen now lashed out about Eugene to their
mother.</p>

<p>And because Eugene was strung on the same wires, shaped from
the same clay, cut from the same kind and plan and quality, he
stood there in the hall as he heard her, his face convulsed and
livid, his limbs trembling with rage, his bowels and his heart
sick and trembling with a hideous grey nausea of hopelessness and
despair, his throat choking with an intolerable anguish of
resentment and wrong, as he heard Helen's voice, and before he
rushed back into the kitchen to quarrel with her and his
mother.</p>

<p>"Well, now," he heard his mother say in a diplomatic and
hopeful tone that somehow only served to increase his feeling of
rage and exasperation--"well, now--well, now," she said, "let's
wait and see! Let's wait and see what happens with this play.
Perhaps he'll hear tomorrow that they have taken it. Maybe it's
going to be all right, after all!"</p>

<p>"Going to be all right!" Eugene fairly screamed at this
juncture, rushing in upon them in the kitchen. "You're God-damned
right it's going to be all right. I'll tell you what's all
right!" he panted, because his breath was labouring against his
ribs as if he had run up a steep hill--"if it was some damned
real-estate man, that would be all right! If it's some cheap
low-down lawyer, that would be all right! If it was some damned
rascal sitting on his tail up here in the bank, cheating you out
of all you've got, that would be all right--hey?" he snarled,
conscious that his words had no meaning or coherence, but unable
to utter any of the things he wished to say and that welled up in
that wave of hot and choking resentment. "O yes! The big man! The
great man! The big deacon--Mr. Scroop Pegram--the big bank
president--that would be all right, wouldn't it?" he cried in a
choked and trembling voice. "You'd get down on your hands and
knees, and crawl if he spoke to you, wouldn't you?--'O thank you,
Mr. Pegram, for letting me put my money in your bank so you can
loan it out to a bunch of God-damn real-estate crooks,'" he
sneered, in an infuriated parody of whining servility. "'Thank
you, sir,'" he said, and in spite of the fact that these words
made almost no coherent meaning, his mother began to purse her
lips rapidly in an excited fashion, and his sister's big-boned
face reddened with anger.</p>

<p>"Now," his mother said sternly, as she levelled her index
finger at him, "I want to tell you something! You may sneer all
you please, sir, at Scroop Pegram, but he's a man who has worked
all his life for everything he has--"</p>

<p>"Yes," Eugene said bitterly, "and for everything <i>you</i>
have, too--for that's where it's going in the end."</p>

<p>"He has made his <i>own</i> way since his childhood," Eliza
continued sternly and deliberately--"no one ever did anything for
him, for there's one thing sure:--there was no one in his family
who was in a position to do it.--What he's done he's done for
himself, without assistance and," his mother said in a stern and
telling voice, "without education--for he never had three months'
schoolin' in his life--and today he's got the respect of the
community as much as any man I know."</p>

<p>"Yes! And most of their money, too," Eugene cried.</p>

<p>"You'd better not talk!" Helen said. "If I were you I wouldn't
talk! Don't criticize other people until you show you've got it
in you to do something for yourself," she said.</p>

<p>"You! You!" Eugene panted. "I'll show you! Talking about me
when my back is turned, hey? That's the kind you are! All right!
You wait and see! I'll show you!" he said, in a choked and
trembling whisper of fury and resentment.</p>

<p>"All right," Helen said in a hard and hostile voice. "I'll
wait and see. I hope you do. But you've got to show me that
you've got it in you. It's time for you to quit this foolishness
and get a job! Don't criticize other people until you show you've
got it in you to support yourself," she said.</p>

<p>"No," said Eliza, "for we've done as much for you as we are
able to. You've had as good an education as anyone could
want--and now the rest is up to you," she said sternly. "I've got
no more money to pay out on you, so you can make your mind up to
it from now on," she said. "You've got to shift for
yourself."</p>

<p>And in the warm and living silence of the kitchen they looked
at one another for a moment, all three, breathing heavily, and
with hard and bitter eyes.</p>

<p>"Well, Gene," Helen said, "I know. Try to forget about it.
You'll change as you grow older," she said wearily. "We've all
been like that. We all have these wonderful ambitions to be
somebody famous, but that all changes. I had them, too," she
said. "I was going to be a great singer, and have a career in
opera, but that's all over now, and I know I never will. You
forget about it," she said quietly and wearily. "It all seems
wonderful to you, and you think that you can't live without it,
but you forget about it. Oh, of course you will!" she muttered,
"of course! Why!" she cried, shaking Eugene furiously, and now
her voice had its old hearty and commanding ring, "I'm going to
beat you if you act like this! What if they don't take your play!
I'll bet that has happened to plenty of people--Yes, sir!" she
cried. "I'll bet that has happened to all of them when they
started out--and then they went on and made a big success of it
later! Why, if those people didn't take my play," she said, "I'd
sit down and write another one so good they'd be ashamed of
themselves! Why, you're only a kid yet!" she cried furiously,
shaking Eugene, and frowning fiercely but with her tongue stuck
out a little and a kind of grin on her big-boned liberal-looking
face. "Don't you know that! You've got <i>loads</i> of time yet!
Your life's ahead of you! Of course you will! Of course you
will!" she cried, shaking him. "Don't let a thing like this get
you down! In ten years' time you'll look back on all this and
laugh to think you were ever such a fool! Of course you
will!"--and then as her husband, who had driven up before their
mother's house, now sounded on the horn for her, she said again,
in the quiet and weary tone: "Well, Gene, forget about it! Life's
too short! I know," she said mysteriously, "I know!"</p>

<p>Then, as she started to go, she added casually: "Honey, come
on over for supper, if you want to.--Now it's up to you. You can
suit yourself!--You can do exactly as you please," she said in
the almost hard, deliberately indifferent tone with which she
usually accompanied these invitations:</p>

<p>"What would you like to eat?" she now said meditatively. "How
about a nice thick steak?" she said juicily, as she winked at
him. "I've got the whole half of a fried chicken left over from
last night, that you can have if you come over!--Now it's up to
you!" she cried out again in that almost hard challenging tone,
as if he had shown signs of unwillingness or refusal. "I'm not
going to urge you, but you're welcome to it if you want to
come.--How about a big dish full of string beans--some mashed
potatoes--some stewed corn, and asparagus? How'd you like some
great big wonderful sliced tomatoes with mayonnaise?--I've got a
big deep peach and apple pie in the oven--do you think that'd go
good smoking hot with a piece of butter and a hunk of American
cheese?" she said, winking at him and smacking her lips
comically. "Would that hit the spot? Hey?" she said, prodding him
in the ribs with her big stiff fingers and then saying in a
hoarse, burlesque, and nasal tone, in extravagant imitation of a
girl they knew who had gone to New York and had come back talking
with the knowing, cock-sure nasal tone of the New Yorker.</p>

<p>"Ah, fine, boys!" Helen said, in this burlesque tone. "Fine!
Just like they give you in New York!" she said. Then turning away
indifferently, she went down the steps, and across the walk
towards her husband's car, calling back in an almost hard and
aggressive tone:</p>

<p>"Well, you can do exactly as you like! No one is going to urge
you to come if you don't want to!"</p>

<p>Then she got into the car and they drove swiftly off
down-hill, turned the corner and vanished.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>The reason, in fact, which argued in Eugene's family's mind
against his succeeding in the work he wished to do was the very
thing that should have been all in his favour. But neither he nor
his family thought so. It was this: a writer, they thought,
should be a wonderful, mysterious, and remote sort of
person--someone they had never known, like Irvin S. Cobb. "Now,
this boy," they argued in their minds, "our son and brother, is
neither wonderful, mysterious, nor remote. We know all about him,
we all grew up together here, and there's no use talking--he's
the same kind of people that we are. His father was a
stone-cutter--a man who was born on a farm and had to work all
his life with his hands. And five of his father's brothers were
also stone-cutters, and had to earn their living in the same
way--by the sweat of their brow. And his mother is a hard-working
woman who brought up a big family, runs a boarding-house and has
had to scrape and save and labour all her life. Everyone in this
part of the country knows her family: her brothers are respected
business men in town here, and there are hundreds of her
kinsfolk--farmers, storekeepers, carpenters, lumber-dealers, and
the like--all through this section. Now, they're all good,
honest, decent, self-respecting people--no one can say they're
not--but there's never been a writer in the crowd. No--and no
doctors or lawyers either. Now there may have been a preacher or
two--his Uncle Bascom was a preacher and a highly educated man
too, always poking his nose into a book and went to Harvard, and
all--yes, and now that we remember, always had queer notions like
this boy--had to leave the Church, you know, for being an
agnostic, and was always writing poems, and all such as that.
Well, this fellow is one of the same kind--a great book-reader
but with no practical business sense--and it seems to us he ought
to get a job somewhere teaching school, or maybe some newspaper
work--which he could do--or, perhaps, he should have studied
law."</p>

<p>So did their minds work on this subject. Yet the very argument
they made--that he was the same kind of person as the rest of
them, and not remote, wonderful, or mysterious--should have been
the chief thing in his favour. But none of them could see this.
For where they thought there was nothing wonderful or mysterious
about them, he thought that there was; and none of them could see
that his greatest asset, his greatest advantage, if he had any,
was that he was made out of the same earth--the same blood, bone,
character, and fury--as the rest of them. For, could they only
have known it, the reason he read all the books was not, as they
all thought, because he was a bookish person, for he was not, but
for the same reason that his mother was mad about
property--talked, thought, felt, and dreamed about real estate
all the time, and wanted to own the earth just as he wanted to
devour it. Again, the fury that had made him read the books was
the same thing that drove his brothers and his sisters around
incessantly, feeding the huge fury of their own unrest, and
making them talk constantly and to everyone, until they knew all
about the lives of all the butchers, bakers, merchants, lawyers,
doctors, Greek restaurant owners, and Italian fruit-dealers in
the community.</p>

<p>If they had understood this--that he had the same thing in him
that they all had in them--they would have understood about his
wanting to be a writer, and even the trouble in which presently
he would involve himself, and that seemed so catastrophic and
disgraceful to him at that time, would not have seemed so bad to
them, for his father, one of his brothers, and several of his
kinsmen had been in this same trouble--and it had caused no
astonishment at all. But now that he had done this thing--now
that the one they looked on as the scholar, and the bookish
person, had done it--it was as if the leading deacon of the
Church had been caught in a raid on a bawdy-house.</p>

<p>Finally, there was to be some irony for Eugene later in the
fact that, had he only known it and grasped it, there was ready
to his use in that one conflict all of the substance and energy
of the human drama, and that the only thing that was wonderful or
important was that they were all full of the passion, stupidity,
energy, hope, and folly of living men--fools, angels, guiltless
and guilty all together, not to be praised or blamed, but just
blood, bone, marrow, passion, feeling--the whole swarming web of
life and error in full play and magnificently alive. As for the
fancied woes and hardships of the young artist in conflict with
the dull and brutal Philistines,--that, he saw later, had had
nothing to do with it, and was not worth a damn, any more than
the plays that had been written in Professor Hatcher's class, and
in which a theatrical formula for living was presented in place
of life. No; the conflict, the comedy, the tragedy,--the pain,
the pride, the folly and the error--might have been just the same
had Eugene wanted to be an aviator, a deep-sea diver, a
bridge-builder, a professional pall-bearer, or a locomotive
engineer. And the study of life was there in all its overwhelming
richness, was right there in his grasp, but he could not see it,
and would not use it. Instead he went snooping and prowling
around the sterile old brothels of the stage, mistaking the glib
concoctions of a counterfeit emotion for the very flesh and
figure of reality. And this also has been true of every youth
that ever walked the earth.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>The letter came at length one grey day in late October; and
instantly, when he had opened it, and read the first words "We
regret," his life went grey as that grey day, and he thought that
he would never have heart or hope nor know the living joy of work
again. His flesh went dead and cold and sick, yet he read the
smooth lying phrases in the letter with the stolid face with
which people usually receive bad news, and even tried to
insinuate a thread of hope, to suck a kind of meagre and hopeless
comfort from the hard, yet oily, words, "We are looking forward
with great interest to reading your next play, and we hope you
will send it to us as soon as it is completed." . . . "Our
members were divided in their opinion, four voting to reconsider
it and five for rejection . . . although all were agreed on the
freshness and vitality of the writing . . . while the power of
some of the scenes is undeniable . . . we must reluctantly. . . .
You are one of the young men whose work we are watching with the
greatest interest . . ." and so on.</p>

<p>Those on whom the naked weight of shame has rested, who have
felt its grey and hideous substance in their entrails, will not
smile calmly and with comfort if their memory serves them.</p>

<p>Now a huge, naked, and intolerable shame and horror pressed
down on Eugene with a crushing and palpable weight out of the
wet, grey skies of autumn. The hideous grey stuff filled him from
brain to bowels, was everywhere and in everything about him so
that he breathed it out of the air, felt it like a naked stare
from walls and houses and the faces of the people, tasted it on
his lips, and endured it in the screaming and sickened dissonance
of ten thousand writhing nerves so that he could no longer sit,
rest, or find oblivion, exhaustion, forgetfulness or repose
anywhere he went, or release from the wild unrest that drove him
constantly about. He went to bed only to get up and prowl again
the wet and barren little streets of night; he ate, and instantly
vomited up again all he had eaten, and then like a dull,
distressed and nauseated brute, he would sullenly and wretchedly
eat again.</p>

<p>He saw the whole earth with the sick eyes, the sick heart, the
sick flesh, and writhing nerves of this grey accursed weight of
shame and horror in which his life lay drowned, and from which it
seemed he could never more emerge to know the music of health and
joy and power again; and from which, likewise, he could not die,
but must live hideously and miserably the rest of his days, like
a man doomed to live for ever in a state of retching and
abominable nausea of heart, brain, bowels, flesh and spirit.</p>

<p>It seemed to him that all was lost, that he had been living in
a fool's dream for years, and that now he had been brutally
wakened and saw himself as he was--a naked fool--who had never
had an ounce of talent, and who no longer had an ounce of hope--a
madman who had wasted his money and lost precious years when he
might have learned some work consonant with his ability and the
lives of average men. And it now seemed to him that his family
had been terribly and mercilessly right in everything they had
said and felt, and that he had been too great a fool to
understand it. His sense of ruin and failure was abysmal,
crushing, and complete.</p>

<h1>XLII</h1>

<p> </p>

<p>It was in this temper, after two days of aimless and frenzied
wandering about the streets of the town, and over the hills that
surrounded it, during which time he was no more conscious of what
he did, said, ate, thought or felt than a man in a trance, that
Eugene started off suddenly to visit his other married sister,
who lived in a little town in South Carolina. He had not seen her
since his father's death two years ago; she had written him a few
days before asking him to come down, and now, driven more by a
fury of flight and movement than by any other impulse, he wired
her he was coming, and started out in one of the Public Service
motor cars which at that time made the trip across the mountains.
Luke had arranged to meet him sixty miles from home at the town
of Blackstone, in South Carolina, and drive him the remainder of
the distance to his sister's house.</p>

<p>He set out on a day in late October, wild and windy, full of
ragged torn clouds of light that came and went from grey to gold
and back to grey again. And everything that happened on that
savage day he was to remember later with a literal and blazing
intensity.</p>

<p>Autumn had come sharp and quick that year. October had been
full of frost and nipping days, the hills were glorious that year
as Eugene had never seen them before. Now, only a day or two
before, there had been, despite the early season, a sudden and
heavy fall of snow. It still lay, light but fleecy, in the
fields; and on the great bulk of the hills it lay in a pattern of
shining white, stark greys and blacks, and the colours of the
leaves, which now had fallen thickly and had lost their first
sharp vividness, but were still burning with a dull massed molten
glow.</p>

<p>An hour away, and twenty-five miles from home, the car had
drawn up before the post office of a mountain village or resort
which lay at the crest of the last barrier of the hills, before
the road dropped sharply down the mountain-side to South
Carolina.</p>

<p>While they were halted here, another car drove up--an open,
glittering, and expensive-looking projectile of light grey--and
in it were three young men from home, two of whom Eugene knew.
This car drew up abreast, stopped, and he saw that its driver was
Robert Weaver. And although he had not seen the other youth since
a midnight visit Robert had made to his room in Cambridge, the
latter peered over towards him owlishly and without a word of
greeting and with that abrupt, feverish, and fragmentary speech
that was characteristic of him and was constantly becoming more
dissonant and broken, he barked out:</p>

<p>"Who's in there? Who's that sitting up there in the front
seat? Is that you, Gene?" he called.</p>

<p>When Gene assured him that it was, Robert asked where he was
going. When he told him "Blackstone," he demanded at once that he
leave the service car and come with him.</p>

<p>"We're going there, too," he said. Turning to his comrades, he
added earnestly:</p>

<p>"Aren't we? Isn't that where we're going, boys?"</p>

<p>The two young men to whom he spoke now laughed boisterously,
crying: "Yeah! That's right! That's where we're going, Robert,"
and one of them added with a solemn gravity:</p>

<p>"We're going to--Blackstone," here a slight convulsion seemed
to seize his throat, he swallowed hard, hiccoughed, and
concluded, "to see a football game"--a statement which again set
them off into roars of boisterous laughter. Then they all shouted
at Eugene:</p>

<p>"Come on! Come on! Get in! We've lots of room."</p>

<p>Eugene got out of the service car, paid the driver, took the
small hand-case he had, and got into the other car with Robert
and his two companions. They drove off fast, and almost
immediately they were dropping down the mountain, along the
sinuous curves and turns of the steep road.</p>

<p>Robert's two companions on this journey were young men whom
Eugene had not known in boyhood, with whom he had now only a
speaking acquaintance, and both of whom were recent comers to the
town. The older of these two was a man named Emmet Blake, and he
now sat beside Robert on the front seat of the car.</p>

<p>Emmet Blake was a man of twenty-seven years, a frail and
almost wasted-looking figure of medium height, straight black
hair, black eyes, and a thin, febrile, and corrupted-looking face
which, although almost dead-white in its colour, was given a kind
of dark and feverish vitality by a faint thin smile that seemed
always to hover about the edges of his mouth, and the dark
unnatural glitter of his black eyes.</p>

<p>He lived a reckless and dissipated life and drank heavily:
time after time, after a h&aelig;morrhage of the lungs, he had
been taken to a sanatorium in an ambulance, and his death had
seemed to be a matter of only a few hours. And time after time he
had come out again, and immediately started on another wild spree
of women and corn whisky with Robert and others of the same
breed. He was well-off as to money, and lived expensively,
because he was a nephew of George Blake, the great Middle-Western
manufacturer of cheap motor cars, which in twenty years' time had
created twenty thousand jokes and glutted the highways of the
earth in twenty million tinny and glittering repetitions.</p>

<p>The name of the other youth, who was Eugene's own age and sat
beside him on the back seat, was Kitchin. He was a tall, dark,
handsome fellow, with agreeable manners and a pleasant voice, the
nephew of a retired physician in the town but not native to the
place. Eugene had seen him on the streets, but had never talked
to him before. It was evident that both Robert and his two
friends had been drinking, although not heavily: there was in
their manner the subdued yet wild and mounting elation of young
men when they begin to drink. They laughed a great deal, rather
hilariously, and for no good reason: they insisted frequently
that they were going to the town of Blackstone to see a football
game, an announcement which would set them off again in roars of
laughter.</p>

<p>Almost as soon as Eugene got into the car, and even as they
started off again, Blake thrust his thin hand into the leather
pocket of the door beside him, produced a bottle that was
three-quarters full of Scotch whisky, and turning, gave it to
Eugene, saying:</p>

<p>"Take a big one, Gant. We're all ahead of you."</p>

<p>He drank long and deep, gulping the fiery liquor down his
throat recklessly, feeling suddenly an almost desperate sense of
release from the grey misery of hopelessness which had crushed
him down for days now, since the letter had come. When he had
finished he handed the bottle back to Emmet Blake, who took it,
looked at it with a thin, evil, speculative smile, and said:</p>

<p>"Well, that's pretty good. What do you say, Robert? Shall we
let him pass on that?"</p>

<p>"Hell, no!" cried Robert hoarsely, looking swiftly round at
the bottle. "That's no drink! Make him take a good one, Emmet.
You've got to do better than that if you keep up with us," he
cried, and then he burst out suddenly in his staccato laugh,
shaking his head to himself as he bent over the wheel, and crying
out: "Lord! Lord!"</p>

<p>Blake handed Eugene the bottle again, and he drank some more.
Then Kitchin took the bottle and drank; he handed it back to
Emmet Blake, who drank, and Blake handed it to Robert, who took
it with one hand, his face turned slightly from the wheel, his
eyes still fastened on the road, and drank until the bottle was
empty. Then he flung it away from him across his arm. The bottle
went sailing out across the road and down the gulch or deep
ravine that sloped away beside them far down: the bottle struck a
rock, exploding brilliantly in a thousand glittering fragments,
and they all roared happily, and cheered.</p>

<p>They had finished up that bottle in one round of gulps and
swallows, passing it from hand to hand as they rushed down the
mountain-side, and almost instantly they were at work on a
beverage of a yet more instant and fiery power--raw, white
corn-whisky, in a gallon jug, clear as water, rank and nauseous
to an unaccustomed throat, strong and instant as the kick of a
mule, fiery, choking, formidable, and savage. They hooked their
thumbs into the handle of the jug and brought the stuff across
their shoulders with a free-hand motion; they let the wide neck
pour into their tilted throats with a fat thick gurgle, and they
gulped that raw stuff down with greedy gulpings like water going
down a gully drain.</p>

<p>It was a drink that would have felled an ox, a terrific
lightning-blast of alcohol that would have thrown Polyphemus to
the earth; and yet it was not drink alone that made them drunk
that day. For they were all young men, and they had shouted,
sung, and roared with laughter, and pounded one another with
affectionate delight as they rushed on--and it was not drink
alone that made them drunk.</p>

<p>For they felt that everything on earth was good and glorious,
that everything on earth was made for their delight, that they
could do no wrong and make no error, and that such invincible
strength was in them that trees would fall beneath their stroke,
the immortal hills bow down before their stride, and that nothing
in the world could stop them.</p>

<p>And for Eugene it seemed that everything had come to life for
him at once--that he had emerged instantly and victoriously from
the horror of shame, the phantasmal and dreamlike unreality that
had held him in its spell. It seemed to him that all the earth
had come to life again in shapes of deathless and familiar
brightness, that he had gloriously re-entered a life he thought
he had lost for ever, and that all the plain priceless joy and
glory of the earth was his, as it had never been before.</p>

<p>And first of all, and with an almost intolerable relief and
happiness, he was conscious of the pangs of hunger: his famished
belly and his withered stomach, which had for days shrunk wearily
and with disgust from food, now, under the stimulation of a
ravenous hunger, fairly pleaded for nourishment. He thought of
food--food in a hundred glorious shapes and varieties: the
literal sensual images of food blazed in his mind like paintings
from the brush of a Dutch master, and it seemed to him that no
one had ever painted, spoken, or written about food before in a
way that would do it justice.</p>

<p>Later, these were the things Eugene would remember from that
day with a living joy, for it was as if he had been born again,
or discovered the world anew in all its glory. And besides all
this--a part, an element in all this whole harmonious design of
triumphant joy and rediscovery--was the way the hills had looked
that day as they came down the mountain, the smell of the air
which was mellow and autumnal, and yet had in it the premonitory
breath of frost and sharpness, and the wild joy, power, and
ecstasy that had filled their hearts, their throats, their
lives--the sense of victory, triumph, and invincible strength,
and of some rare, glorious, and intolerable happiness that was
pending for them, and which seemed to swell the tremendous and
exulting music of that magic day.</p>

<p>Around them, above them, below them--for the living and
shining air of autumn, from the embrowned autumnal earth, from
the great shapes of the hills behind them with their molten mass
of colour--dull browns, rich bitter reds, dark bronze, and mellow
yellow--from the raw crude clay of the piedmont earth and the
great brown stubble of the cotton-fields--from a thousand
impalpable and unutterable things, there came this glorious
breath of triumph and delight. It was late October, there was a
smell of smoke upon the air, an odour of burning leaves, the
barking of a dog, a misty red, a pollenated gold in the rich,
fading, sorrowful, and exultant light of the day,--and far off, a
sound of great wheels pounding on a rail, the wailing whistle,
and the tolling bell of a departing train.</p>

<p>And finally, the immortal visage of the earth itself, with the
soaring and limitless undulations of its blue ranges, the great
bulk of the autumn hills, immense and near, the rugged, homely,
and familiar trees--the pines, oaks, chestnuts, maples,
locusts--the homely look of the old red clay--the unforgettable
and indescribable naturalness of that earth--with its rudeness,
wildness, richness, rawness, ugliness, fathomless mystery and
utter familiarity, and finally the lonely, haunting, and
enchanted music that it made--the strange spirit of time and
solitude that hovered above it eternally, and which can never be
described, but which may be evoked by a cow-bell broken by the
wind in distant valleys, the lonely whistle of a departing train,
or simply a sinuous gust of wind that smokes its way across
coarse mountain grasses when spring comes--all this, which Eugene
had felt and known in his childhood, and yet had never had a
tongue to utter, he seemed now to know and understand so well
that he had himself become its tongue and utterance, the more its
child because he had been so long away from it, the more its eye
because he now saw it again as it must have seemed to the first
men who ever saw it, with the eyes of discovery, love, and
recognition.</p>

<p>And yet, for him all these things spoke instantly,
intolerably, exultantly, not of home, return, and settlement, but
of one image, which now burned for ever in his brain, rose like a
triumphant music in his heart. And that image was the image of
the enchanted city, in which, it now seemed, all the frenzy and
unrest of his spirit would find a certain goal and triumph, and
toward which everything on earth, and all the hope and joy now
rising in his heart, was tending.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>When they got down off the mountain into South Carolina they
were very drunk. On a dusty sand-clay road between some
cotton-fields they stopped the car, and walked out into the
fields to make water. The cotton stood stiff and dry and fleecy
in its pods, the coarse brown stalks rose up in limitless planted
rows, and underneath, he could see the old and homely visage of
the red-clay earth.</p>

<p>At one edge of the field, and seeming very far away and
lonely-looking, there was a negro shanty, and behind this a
desolate wooded stretch of pine. Over all the earth at once, now
that the roar of the engine had stopped, there was an immense and
brooding quietness, a drowsed autumnal fume and warmth, immensely
desolate and mournful, holding somehow a tragic prophecy of
winter that must come, and death, and yet touched with the
lonely, mournful and exultant mystery of the earth.</p>

<p>Eugene pulled several of the big cotton-stalks out of the dry
red earth, thrust one through the button-hole of his coat lapel,
and tore it through exultantly, although the stalk was two feet
long. Then he reeled back toward the car again, holding the other
stalks of cotton in his hands, got into the car, and at once
began to talk to his companions about the cotton--ending up in a
passionate oration about the hills, the fields, the cotton and
the earth--trying to tell them all about "the South" and making
of the stalks of cotton and "the South" a kind of symbol, as
young men will, although they all felt and acted just as young
men anywhere would do.</p>

<p>But at that moment, all Eugene was trying to say about his
years away from home, and his return, and how he had discovered
his own land again and was, "by God!" one of them--waving the
stalks of cotton as he talked, and finding the whole core and
kernel of all he wished to say in these stalks of cotton--all of
this, although incoherent, drunken, and confused, seemed so
eloquent and beautiful to him, so truthful, passionate, and
exact--that he began to weep for joy as he talked to them. And
they--they were, of course, delighted: they howled with laughter,
cheered enthusiastically, slapped him on the back, and shook
hands all round, crying--"By God! Listen to him talk! . . . Give
'em hell, son! We're with you! . . . Hot-damn! Thataway, boy! . .
. Stay with 'em! . . . Whee!"</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Robert was driving at terrific speed. They had
begun to rip and tear along between the cotton-fields and over
the dusty sand-clay roads, mistaking the screams of women and the
shouts of men, as they swerved by their cars and wagons in a
cloud of yellow dust and at a murderous clip, for admiring
applause and enthusiastic cheers, an illusion which only spurred
them on to greater efforts.</p>

<p>The upshot of it was that they finally tore into town,
careening hideously along a central street and with no slackening
of their speed whatever. The excited people in that part of the
State had been phoning in about them for the last fifteen miles
of their mad journey, and now they were halted suddenly at sight
of the police, who stood lined up across the street in a double
row--big, red-faced, country cops--to stop them.</p>

<p>The first brilliant, sparkling and wildly soaring effects of
their intoxication had now worn off and, although they still felt
full of power and a savage rending strength, the corn whisky was
now smouldering in their veins more dully and with a sombre and
brutal drunkenness. Eugene seemed to see all shapes and figures
clearly--the coarse red faces of the country cops and their
clumsy lumbering bodies, and the street drowsy and dusty in the
warmish autumn afternoon.</p>

<p>The grasses on the lawns of houses were faded, sere and
withered-looking, the leaves upon the trees had thinned and hung
yellowed, dry and dead, and in the gutters a few dead leaves
stirred dryly, a few scampered dryly in the streets before a
moment's gust of wind, and then lay still again.</p>

<p>Robert slowed down and stopped before that solid wall of beefy
country blue and red: the police surrounded them and clambered
heavily over the sides of the car, two standing on the
running-boards, two on either side of Eugene on the back seat,
and one with Robert and Emmet Blake up front.</p>

<p>"All right, boys," said one of them, good-naturedly and
casually enough, in the full, sonorous and somewhat howling voice
of the countryman, "drive on down thar to the station-house
now."</p>

<p>"Yes, <i>sir!</i> Yes, <i>sir</i>!<i>"</i> Robert replied at
once in a meek and obedient tone, and with a comical drunken
alacrity. "How do you get there, Captain?" he said with a cunning
and flattering ingratiation.</p>

<p>"Right down this here street to your right," said the
policeman in his drawling and countrified tone, "until you come
to that 'air second turning where you see that 'air f'ar hydrant.
Turn in to the left thar," he said.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir!" said Robert heartily, starting the car again.
"We're all strangers here," he lied, as if he hoped this lie
might make amends for them. "We don't know our way about
yet."</p>

<p>"Well," the policeman drawled with a kind of ugly heartiness,
"maybe the next time you come back you'll be better acquainted
here," he said, winking at his comrades, and they all guffawed.
"We're glad to see you, boys," he continued, still with this ugly
falseness of good nature in his tone. "We been hearin' about
you," he said, winking at his fellows again, "an' we wanted to
git acquainted."</p>

<p>Here the policemen laughed again with sonorous countrified
appreciation of their spokesman's wit.</p>

<p>The policemen were all big beefy men, with hearty drawling
voices, red countrified faces. They had large square feet, wore
dusty-looking black slouch hats with a wide brim, and were
dressed in rather gaudy but slovenly-looking uniforms, with
stripes of gold braid running up the sides of their baggy
trousers, and with the lower brass buttons of their heavy blue
coats unbuttoned, exposing areas of soiled shirts and paunchy
bellies. Their faces had a look of a slow but powerful energy, a
fathomless and mindless animal good nature, and at the same time
a fathomless and mindless animal cruelty--instant, volcanic, and
murderous--written terribly, somehow, into their wide, thin and
horribly cruel mouths, in which there was legible a vitality that
had all the wild and sensual force of nature packed into it, and
was therefore beyond nature--almost supernatural--in its savage
and mindless qualities.</p>

<p>He had seen them standing idly on the corners of the little
towns, huge and slovenly, swinging their thonged clubs in the
great muttons of their hands, surveying with their great red
faces and their wide thin mouths of fathomless cruelty and good
nature the crowds that swarmed around them. He had heard their
drawling howling accents of the country, that had all of the
moisture and distance of the earth in them, and seen their slow
minds wake to a mindless and murderous fury. Once as a child he
had seen one of them, a ponderous giant so huge he lurched from
side to side when he walked, and seemed to fill up the street
with his size, beat a drunken old man--a little howling
integument of bone and gristle--to death with his club, smashing
the little old man across the skull until the blood rushed out in
torrents through his sparse silvery hair, lacing its way in
channels of brilliant red across his face and through his beard
until it seemed incredible so small and old a man could have such
fountains of bright blood in him.</p>

<p>And these huge creatures evoked for Eugene a whole history of
this earth and people, monstrous, savage, and unutterable--a
congruent and unspeakable legend which he knew, and all of them
knew, down to the roots, and which he could not speak about and
had to speak about, somehow, or die. For in these men there was
evident not only the savage and mindless energy of the earth
itself, with all that was wild, sensual, fecund, cruel and
good-natured--the whole weather of life--but there was also
evident the fear, the shame, the horror that had crushed them
beneath its ocean weight of nameless and cowering dread and
broken or destroyed their souls.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>The two policemen who had clambered into the back seat of the
car and now sat on each side of Eugene had these mountainous and
fleshy figures, heavy, yet with a kind of solid and ugly
softness, meaty, and without the muscular and sinewy leanness of
young men. The back seat of the car was a narrow one--the car was
a new "sports model" designed only for four people--and now the
huge fleshy figures of these two policemen, wedged against
Eugene, gave him a feeling of disgust and revulsion.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the feeling of exultant and jubilant power had
not yet worn off, and although he had understood at once, when he
saw the men lined up across the street, that they were under
arrest and would be taken to the city jail, this sordid prospect
caused him no uneasiness whatever. Rather, the feeling of drunken
joy was still so powerful in him that everything on earth seemed
good, and everything that happened wonderful. He hailed the
experience of being arrested and taken to jail exultantly as if
some fortunate and glorious experience was in store for him, and
his exuberant affection for the world was so great that he even
liked the policemen.</p>

<p>Eugene howled with laughter, smote them on their broad backs,
flung his arms out and around their shoulders, saying, "By God,
you're fine fellows, both of you, and you've got to have a
drink!"</p>

<p>At this Robert laughed uneasily, saying to the policemen:</p>

<p>"Don't pay any attention to him! We haven't got anything to
drink--I swear we haven't."</p>

<p>One of them had been rummaging around, however, and now
triumphantly produced the jug from its hiding place beneath
Blake's legs.</p>

<p>"Here it is, boys," he cried, as he displayed it. "I've got
it."</p>

<p>The glass jug was almost empty, but there was still perhaps an
inch of the whisky at the bottom. Robert's face had a worried
look, for the law was such that a capture of this sort might also
mean the confiscation of the owner's car.</p>

<p>Blake, meanwhile, had been talking in a low, craftily
persuasive tone of drunken insinuation and bribery to the
policeman up front, saying:</p>

<p>"Now I know you boys don't want to get us into any trouble. We
weren't doing anything wrong--just having a drink or two together
and if you fellows will just forget about this thing, we'll fix
it up right with you--anything you say," he whispered cunningly,
"and get on out of town right now without anyone knowing a thing
about it. What do you say, now? Come on! You can do it," he said,
with a leer of ingratiation.</p>

<p>The policeman to whom he spoke smiled good-naturedly, but said
nothing. At this moment they drove up before the station-house, a
shabby-looking little building of brick, with bars over the
window, and which was situated on a side-street.</p>

<p>The shabby street looked warm, faded, sleepy, touched with the
ghosts of autumn, but in an instant, as the police got out,
opened the doors, and the gay men clambered down drunkenly among
them, a rabble-rout of ragged negro boys, grinning, gape-mouthed
countrymen with red faces, slouchy-looking barbers in their
shirt-sleeves, and wormy-looking loafers, had gathered magically
from nowhere, stood in a ring about them and snickered and
shuffled about, pressed up to the barred windows and peered in
curiously with shaded eyes as the policemen took them into the
station.</p>

<p>As they started, Robert held back a little, and said hoarsely,
and in a plaintive, troubled voice to the policeman who had him
by the arm:</p>

<p>"What are you taking us in here for? We weren't doing
anything. Honest we weren't. What are you going to do to us?"</p>

<p>The policeman smiled good-humouredly, and then said in a
hearty reassuring voice:</p>

<p>"Aw, we're not goin' to do anything to you. We were just
afraid you boys might run into something and hurt yourself,
that's all. We're just goin' to take you in here, and let you
stay here a little while until you feel better," he said, at the
same time winking at his fellows.</p>

<p>"Well," said Robert sullenly, casting a troubled and unwilling
glance back at his shining car, "--I want to find my car here
when I come out. Now if anything happens to that car, there's
going to be trouble," he said ominously.</p>

<p>"That car will be right here when you come out the way you
left it," the policeman said heartily. "No one is goin' to touch
it. No, sir! I'll look after that car myself!" he said, winking
again at the others.</p>

<p>"All right, then," said Robert. "That's all I want to
know."</p>

<p>Then they marched all of them into the station-house.</p>

<p>The room they entered was a large one, and at first, because
they had come into it out of the brightness of the sun, and the
swimming confusion of drunkenness and arrest, it was so dark
Eugene could not distinguish clearly any of its features. Then he
saw that it was a square, rather high room with worn wooden
floors, wainscoting of a dark varnished brown, and above that
rude calcimined walls of white. In the wall along the street
there were, besides the door, two barred windows which were very
dirty and not very large, and did not give much light.</p>

<p>At one end of the room, as they came in, there was a row of
dull green lockers, probably for the use of the police, and at
the other end a high, square, somewhat majestical-looking desk,
which was also of a dark maply-brown and which seemed to be built
on an elevated rostrum or platform a few inches high. Over this
desk a light with a green glass shade was burning, and behind it
another large red-faced policeman was sitting. By his look of
authority, and the military opulence of his slovenly uniform--for
he had epaulets of thick gold braid upon his shoulders that would
have glorified the uniform of a general in the Marine Corps--he
seemed to be the superior in command.</p>

<p>As for the rest of the room, there was little decoration save
for a row of worn and rickety-looking wooden chairs with rounded
backs along the wall, and a liberal distribution of large brass
spittoons which, to judge from the bare wooden boards around
them, were used less frequently as receptacles than as targets,
and obviously with uncertain success.</p>

<p>Finally, the whole place had the unforgettable look and smell
that police-stations everywhere--and particularly those in little
towns--have always had. Its stale dark air was impregnated with
the odour of cheap cigars and tobacco-juice, of old worn
varnished wood, of human sweat and urine and heavy wool, and with
the strong tarry odour of a sanitary disinfectant. And somehow,
in this stale, dark and weary odour, there was also a quality of
terror, menace, and foreboding--as if the huge and dingy
chronicle of human tragedy and error which this grim room had
witnessed--all the brutal, shabby sinfulness of a little
town--that swarming, hideous and tawdry fraternity of poverty,
vice and error--dredged from its rat-holes in the dark depths of
old brick buildings, hunted out of cheap hotels, pool rooms,
greasy little lunch rooms, nigger shacks, and the rickety wooden
brothels near the railroad tracks, with its vast brotherhood of
scarred and battered men and women--chain-gang niggers, drunken
country youths and cheap bootleggers, grimy prostitutes and all
their furtive bawds and pimps, cutters, sluggers, slabbers,
slashers, and brawlers--both those who live by vice and those who
are its victims--this whole huge earth of pain and crime and
misery had left the terrible imprint of its history so indelibly
there that the weary air was impregnated with sorrow and fear,
and the wood, walls, floors and ceilings were seasoned and
ingrained with the substance of human wretchedness.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>When they had come in, the police had lined up Eugene's three
companions before the imposing rostrum where the desk officer was
sitting, but they had placed him carefully to one side against
the wall, like an object too rare and precious for ordinary
usage. Now, as the great man behind the desk glowered down
gloomily and mistrustfully at them, one of the police spoke to
the desk sergeant and, turning toward Eugene with a nod of the
head, declared in a full countrified tone:</p>

<p>"This big 'un here's the drunkest of the lot."</p>

<p>And the enthroned law bent his gloomy gaze upon him with a
hostile and suspicious look which said as plain as words that it
was no more than he had suspected.</p>

<p>Eugene had not realized, in fact, until he felt that wall
against his shoulders, how very drunk he was; but he was drunker
now than he had ever been in all his life before. He could feel
his back slide down along the wall, and then his bending knees
would straighten with a jerk, and he would solemnly begin to
slide up the wall again. Meanwhile the room swam and rocked and
then was still before his eyes: the shapes of things would melt
into a smear, and then resolve into their proper selves once
more.</p>

<p>And he was conscious that the police were searching him and
his companions, patting their pockets to see if they carried
weapons, examining wallets and letters for identifications,
taking their watches from them, and arraigning them on a series
of formal charges, some of which had no bearing on their case
whatever. Drunk, assuredly, they were; disorderly they might have
been--although it had not seemed so to them; of driving in a
reckless manner they were guilty; but of resisting an officer in
the performance of his duty they had been, up to that time,
spotlessly innocent.</p>

<p>But such were the charges delivered against them in sonorous
and countrified tones. And in the solemn voices of the policemen,
the knowing and portentous way in which they searched the young
men--as if they were a gang of armed desperadoes, and in a manner
that smacked of correspondence-school detective methods--and
finally in the solemn countrified tones of the one who had
pointed to Eugene, saying: "This big 'un here's the drunkest of
the lot," there was something comical and ludicrous.</p>

<p>But in their sense of banded authority, in the stubborn almost
conspiratorial way in which they had now hardened in a group
against the young men, forsaking the good-humoured and jovial
manners which had heretofore distinguished them, there was
something ugly and revolting--something stupid, provincial,
mob-like, and unreasoning, which told the young men plainly that
"they had them" now, that they were "foreigners," therefore
suspect, and must bow their heads in silence to the obdurate and
capricious tyrannies of a local and, for them, impregnable
authority.</p>

<p>At length, the sonorous formalities of their arraignment
having been completed, the sergeant having scrawled and written
in his ledger, the man looked up and ordered sternly:</p>

<p>"All right, boys! Take 'em back and lock 'em up!"</p>

<p>Then the young men were marched back along a corridor into a
large two-storeyed room, which had brick walls and cement floors,
two rows of dirty barred windows, a grey and gelid light, and a
general feel of raw and clammy dankness. This room, which had a
harsh angular steel-and-cement newness that the other did not
have, seemed to be of more recent construction, and to have been
added on to the front part of the jail. In this room, also, there
were several rows of cells, ascending in tiers up to the ceiling.
When they entered, the place was quiet, but immediately a drunken
negress in one of the cells began to bawl and rave and sob,
smashing, hammering, and rattling the bars of her cell like a
demented ape. There was everywhere a foul rank odour of undrained
faecal matter, tempered with the odour of the tarry disinfectant,
and cut more sharply with the acrid smell of some ammoniacal
fluid.</p>

<p>At the first row of cells they paused, and the police in
charge of Robert and Emmet Blake (for Eugene now discovered with
a sense of shock that Kitchin was not with them) unlocked the
doors of cells two and three and thrust Blake and Robert into
them. The last, or end, cell in the row, Eugene now saw was
intended for his occupancy and he stood waiting obediently, in
the relaxed grip of one of the policemen, until his comrade
should unlock the door.</p>

<p>Suddenly, as the door swung open, and Eugene stepped forward
into the cell, his vision cleared somewhat, and he saw a young
negro standing in the cell, beside the iron bed that projected
from the wall, looking toward him with a startled expression on
his face that suggested he had been asleep upon the cot, and had
been rudely wakened by their entrance. Instantly, one fixed and
all-obsessing belief began to burn in Eugene's inflamed and
drunken brain. He thought that he was being put here with this
negro because the jail was crowded and the cell-space scanty, and
further--and this was the thing that maddened him and that he
found intolerable--because, as the policeman had said when they
arraigned the young men, "this big 'un here's the drunkest of the
lot," and they thought he was too drunk to notice or to care
about the advantage they were taking of him.</p>

<p>For this reason--and this reason only--he now acted as he did.
As far as the negro himself was concerned, Eugene bore no grudge
against him, and the feeling of shame and degradation which had
swept over him in an overwhelming flood when he saw the cell and
knew he was to be locked in it like an animal was so great that
he would not have cared with whom he had to share that cell, if
it had been the custom of the country so to share it. But the
custom of the country was not so, he knew, and the belief that he
was being put upon, his drunkenness taken advantage of, and that
he was being dealt with less fairly than the others, now so stung
his maddened pride that he turned and kicked the iron door back
in the faces of the two policemen, just as they were closing
it.</p>

<p>Then he started to come out of the cell. When he did, the two
big red-faced policemen came running forward with a lumbering,
panting, and somehow revolting clumsiness and tried to push him
back into the cell. When this happened, something dark, grey, and
terrible that he had never known before rose up in his soul--and
this thing, which now came to him for the first time, was to
return often in the savage years that followed.</p>

<p>As the police came rushing towards Eugene his fury and
desperation were so great that he felt little or no fear, but the
sensations of horror and disgust were so terrible that they drove
him mad, and he seemed to be drowning in them. And the first
visible and physical, although perhaps not the basic, causes of
these sensations of horror and disgust came from the mountainous
figures of the two policemen, and the feel of their huge
soft-solid bodies as they jammed against him. For, if they had
quelled his rebellion at the outset by smashing him over the head
with their clubs, he might have felt a moment's fear before the
club crashed on his skull, but he would not have felt horror and
disgust.</p>

<p>But the sight, the feel, the smell, the look of these huge
soft-solid bodies of mountainous flesh, and the revolting
clumsiness of their movements, made the thing horrible. As they
rushed towards Eugene and tried to thrust him back into the cell,
he grabbed hold of the bars on either side of the door, and began
to howl at them and curse them foully, and to butt at them with
his head. When this happened the policemen braced themselves
together like turn-squat Buddhas, holding on to the bars with
their huge muttony hands, that had no leanness in them, and
butted back at Eugene with their huge soft-solid stomachs.</p>

<p>They stood, half-squatly, side by side, their muttony hands
gripped around the bars, their great red faces moist and panting,
their huge buttocks somehow obscenely womanish in their fat
breadth, as they butted back clumsily at him with their soft
ponderous bellies--all of this, and the revolting contact of
their flesh against his own, filled him with such an infinite
loathing of horror and disgust that he went mad.</p>

<p>He started to come out of the cell. When he did, the two big
police men came running forward with a lumbering clumsiness and
tried to push him back in. One of the men raised his ponderous
fist and shouted: "Git back in thar now or I'll hit ye." A huge
muttony fist smashed squarely on his nose and mouth: he butted,
cursed, amid a pin-wheel aura of exploding rockets: the fist
smashed hard again below one eye: the boy screamed like a wounded
animal and cursing horribly all the time began to use his head as
a battering ram, butting again and again at the fat red
faces.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the other one, grunting and puffing, and with his
tongue between his teeth, began to thump, tug and wrench at the
fingers of one hand, trying to loosen them from the bar, and
saying to his fellow:</p>

<p>"You git his other hand, Jim, an' try to make him turn
a-loose."</p>

<p>During all this time that Eugene had been cursing and butting
at these men, he had also been shouting: "You God-damned
red-faced South Car'lina bastards, you're not going to lock me up
in here with a nigger--no, you ain't!"--and now he felt something
rough and woolly scraping underneath his arm. It was the
frightened negro's head. He went squirming out below Eugene's arm
until he was outside peering with white eyeballs over a
policeman's shoulder, and when Eugene saw they would not try to
keep the negro there with him, he went back in the cell and was
locked up. He felt very sick, and everything was swimming
nauseously around him: for a while he leaned over the w.c. and
vomited into it. Then he sat down on the edge of the cot and
stared ahead, thinking about nothing, but with something hideous,
like a great grey smear, inside him.</p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h1>XLIII</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>How long he sat there in this way he did not know, for time
would pass in a hideous smear of brownish grey while all things
reeled, mixed, and were fused drunkenly and shapelessly around
him--and then for a moment time would burn in his mind like a
small hard light of brilliant colour, and he would see everything
with an exact and blazing vividness and hear the voices of his
comrades in their cells.</p>

<p>The cell Eugene sat in was a little cubicle of space, perhaps
eight feet deep and four or five feet wide. Its only furnishings
were a black iron cot or bed which projected from the wall and
could be turned up or out, and which had no springs or mattress
on it, and a w.c. of dirty white enamel, which had no seat, and
was broken and would not flush so that it had run over and
spilled out upon the cement floor. The walls and ceilings of the
cell were made of some hard slate-like substance of black-grey,
scrawled with the familiar obscenities and pictures of its former
occupants. Because of these solid walls, each cell was cut off
from its neighbours and for this reason he could not see Emmet
Blake, who had the cell next to him, nor Robert, who had the cell
on the other side of Emmet, but now, as his mind swam from the
stupor of its drunkenness, he could hear their voices and began
to listen to their conversation.</p>

<p>Both were still quite drunk, and for a while they continued a
kind of mournful drunken chant, each responding to the other with
a repetition of his own misfortune.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," Robert would say, heaving a sigh and speaking in a
hoarse, mournfully drunken voice, "this is certainly a hell of a
way to treat a man who's just been admitted to the bar six weeks
ago! A hell of a thing!" he said.</p>

<p>And Blake would answer:</p>

<p>"Yes, sir! And I'll tell <i>you</i> what <i>is</i> a hell of a
thing! This is a hell of a way to treat George Blake's nephew! A
hell of a way!" he said. "If my uncle knew about this he'd come
down here and tear their damned little jail to pieces! He'd
<i>ruin</i> their town!" he cried. "Yes, sir! He'd wash 'em out
and send 'em to the cleaners! Why!" Blake now said in a tone of
drunken boastfulness, "there are 70,000 Blake dealers in the
United States <i>alone</i>--and if they knew that <i>I</i> was
here," he said, "every damned one of them would be on his way
here in five minutes to get us out!"</p>

<p>"Lord! Lord!" said Robert, in a kind of mournful brooding
ululation, as if he had not heard Blake's words at all. "Who'd
have thought it? A young attorney just admitted to the bar six
weeks ago and here he is in jail! The damnedest thing I ever
heard of!" he declared.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," Blake declared, not by way of response, but with
the same self-centred concentration on the indignity which had
been visited on him. "If you told any Blake dealer in the country
that George Blake's nephew was down here in the Blackstone jail,
he wouldn't believe you. Uncle George will carry this thing to
the Supreme Court when we get out," he said. "It is certainly a
hell of a thing to happen to George Blake's nephew!"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," Robert answered, "a hell of a thing to happen is
<i>right</i>--and here I've only had my licence to practise for
six weeks. Why, it's awful!" he said solemnly.</p>

<p>"Robert!" Blake cried suddenly, getting to his feet.--"Do you
guess these damned Blackstone cops know who I am? Do you guess
they realize they've got George Blake's nephew here?" Here he
went to the door of his cell, rattled it violently, and yelled:
"Hey--y! I'm George Blake's nephew! Do you know you've got George
Blake's nephew back here? Come and let me out!" he shouted. No
one answered.</p>

<p>Then they would be silent for a while, and mournful, brooding
drunken time would pass around them.</p>

<p>Then Blake would say:</p>

<p>"Robert?"</p>

<p>"What do you want?" said Robert mournfully.</p>

<p>"What time is it?"</p>

<p>"Hell, how do I know what time it is?" said Robert in a sullen
and protesting tone. "You know they took my watch." Then there
would be silence for a moment more.</p>

<p>"Emmet?" Robert would then say.</p>

<p>"All right. What is it?"</p>

<p>"Did they take your watch, too?"</p>

<p>"Yes!" Blake shouted suddenly in an angry and excited tone.
"And that was an eighteen carat, thirty-two jewel platinum-case
watch that Uncle George bought for me in Switzerland. That watch
is worth $225 and I'd better get it back when I get out of here!"
he shouted rattling the door. "Do you hear? If those sons of
bitches try to steal my watch, my Uncle George will put 'em
<i>all</i> in jail! I want it back!" he shouted.</p>

<p>No one answered.</p>

<p>Then they were silent for another spell of time, and finally
Robert said in a hoarse, brooding, and mournful tone:</p>

<p>"Eugene?"</p>

<p>"Well."</p>

<p>"Are you there?"</p>

<p>"Where the hell do you think I am?" Eugene said bitterly. "You
don't see any holes in this place you can crawl out of, do
you?"</p>

<p>Robert laughed his hoarse falsetto laugh, and then said with a
kind of brooding wonder:</p>

<p>"Lord! Lord! Who'd have thought it? Who'd ever have thought
Eugene and I would get put in jail together here in Blackstone,
South Carolina. Here I am just out of Yale and admitted to the
bar six weeks ago and you--boy!" he laughed suddenly his annoying
falsetto laugh, and concluded--"Just got back from three years at
Harvard and here you are in jail already! Lord! Lord! What are
you going to tell your mother when she sees you? What's she going
to say when you tell her you've been in jail?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know!" the other said angrily. "Shut up!"</p>

<p>Robert laughed his annoying falsetto laugh again, and
said:</p>

<p>"Boy! I'd hate to have to face her! I'm glad I'm not in
<i>your</i> shoes!"</p>

<p>"Not in <i>my</i> shoes!" the other shouted in an exasperated
tone. "You damned fool, you are in my shoes!"</p>

<p>Then they were silent for a spell, and grey time ticked
wearily around them the slow remorseless sound of interminable
minutes.</p>

<p>Presently Blake spoke, out of a drunken silence, saying:</p>

<p>"Gant?"</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"What time is it now?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. They have my watch," he said.</p>

<p>And grey time ticked around them.</p>

<p>"Robert," Eugene said at length, straightening from his
dejected stupor on the cot, "did you see that nigger?"</p>

<p>"What nigger?" Robert said stupidly.</p>

<p>"Why, the nigger they tried to put in here with me!" he
said.</p>

<p>"Why, I didn't see any nigger, Gene," said Robert, in a hoarse
and drunken tone of mild and melancholy protest. "When was
this?"</p>

<p>"Why, Robert!" the other boy now cried in an excited voice and
with a feeling of hideous dread inside him. "You were right here
all the time! Didn't you hear us?"</p>

<p>"Why no, Eugene," Robert answered in a slow protesting voice
that had dull wonder and surprise in it. "I didn't hear
anything," he said.</p>

<p>"Why, my God, Robert!" Eugene now cried excitedly, and even
with a kind of frenzy in his tone. "You must have heard us! Why,
we were fighting here for ten minutes!" he said, for the time of
the struggle now seemed at least that long to him.</p>

<p>"Who?" said Robert, dully and stupidly.</p>

<p>"Why, me and those two big cops!" he cried. "Good God, Robert,
didn't you see us?--didn't you hear us?--butting and kicking like
a goat--hitting me over the head, trying to make me turn
a-loose!" he cried in an excited, almost incoherent tone.</p>

<p>"Who did?" Robert stupidly inquired.</p>

<p>"Why--those two big cops, Robert--that's who! Good God, do you
mean to tell me that you never heard us when we were cursing and
butting away there right in front of you?"</p>

<p>"I didn't hear anything--I thought you said a nigger," he said
in a stupid and confused tone.</p>

<p>"Why, Robert, that's what I'm telling you!" Eugene shouted.
"They had him in here--"</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"Why, in the cell! They were trying to put me in here with
him! That's what the trouble was about!" he said.</p>

<p>"Why, Eugene," Robert said with an uneasy and troubled laugh,
which yet had a note of good-natured derision in it that was
maddening, "I didn't see any nigger. Did you, Emmet? I was right
here all the time and I didn't hear any trouble. . . .
<i>You've</i> been dreaming," Robert now said, with a conviction
in his tone that goaded the other boy almost past endurance, and
yet struck a knife of cold terror into his heart. And he began to
laugh hoarsely his annoying and derisive laugh, as he shook his
head, and said: "Lord! <i>Lord!</i>--He's in there seeing niggers
and policemen and I don't know what-all." And here he laughed
hoarsely again, his derisive and falsetto laugh, and said:
<i>"Boy!</i> You've got 'em! You've <i>got</i> 'em bad! You've
been seeing things!"</p>

<p>"Robert, God-damn it!" Eugene now fairly screamed, "I tell you
he was here! I tell you I saw him standing in the cell when I
came in! I know what I'm talking about, Robert!--there was a
nigger here when I came in!"</p>

<p>"Why, hell, Eugene!" Robert said more kindly, but with a
hoarse derisive laugh, "you've just been seeing things, son.
There was no one there; you just imagined it. I reckon you just
passed out and dreamed it happened!"</p>

<p>"Dreamed! Dreamed!" Eugene shouted, "God-damn it, Robert,
don't you think I know when I'm dreaming? I'll show you if it was
a dream! I'll prove it to you that it really happened! I can
prove it by Blake!" he cried. "Ask Blake! . . . Blake! Blake!
Blake!" he shouted.</p>

<p>And grey time slid with its slow sanded drop around them.</p>

<p>Blake did not answer: he had not heard their conversation and
now they heard him talking softly, slowly, murderously to
himself.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," he was saying, in a low, quiet, drunkenly intent
soliloquy. "Yes, sir, I'll kill him! . . . So help me, God, I'll
kill him dead, as sure as my name is Emmet Blake! . . . I'll pull
out my forty-five. . . . I'll get my forty-five out when I go
home . . . and I'll go Ping! Ping! Ping! the minute that I see
him. I'll go Ping! Ping! Ping!" cried Blake. "I'll kill him dead,
so help me, God, if it's the last thing that I ever do!"</p>

<p>"I'll kill him!" Blake continued in a tone of dogged, drunken
repetition, still talking to himself. "When I get home I'll kill
him if it's the last thing I ever do!"</p>

<p>"And I'll kill <i>you,</i> too," Blake muttered in this same
brooding and intent oblivion of drunken soliloquy. "You
God-damned whore, I'll kill you, too! I'll kill the two of you
together! . . . The bitch! The bitch! The dirty bitch!" the man
now screamed, starting to his feet, and now really with a
tortured note of agony and desperation in his voice. "I know
where you are this minute! I know you're with him! I know you'll
sleep with him tonight, you--dirty--low-down--"</p>

<p>"Emmet, you damned fool, shut up!" Robert now said, with a
troubled and protesting laugh. "Do you want everyone in the whole
damned place to hear you?" The dreadful shame and anguish in the
man's desperate life had burst nakedly through his drunkenness,
and the hideous mutilation of his soul was suddenly stripped
bare--"Don't talk like that," said Robert, with a troubled
laugh--"you'll be sorry tomorrow for what you said, you know you
will: oh, Emmet, shut up!" Robert said again with a protesting
and embarrassed laugh.</p>

<p>For Blake was now sobbing horribly in his cell: as Eugene
stood leaning against the wall next to him, he could hear him
sobbing and pounding his thin fist savagely into the grey-slate
substance of the wall, while he went on:</p>

<p>"The whore! The dirty whore!" he wept. "I know that she's just
waiting for me to die! I know that's what she wants! I know
that's all she's waiting for! . . . That's what you want, you
bitch, isn't it? You'd like that, wouldn't you? That would just
suit you, wouldn't it? . . . Ah, I've fooled you! I've fooled
you, haven't I?" he panted, with a savage and vindictive triumph
in his voice. "You've been waiting for it for the last two years,
haven't you? And I've fooled you every time," he gasped. "And
I'll fool you yet--you bitch, you dirty bitch!"</p>

<p>And they sat there, saying nothing, listening with desolation
in their hearts to the man's naked shame, and now hearing nothing
but his gasping sobs and the slow grey wear and waste of time
around them. And then his sobbing breath grew quieter, they could
hear him panting feebly, like an exhausted runner, and presently
he went over and sat down upon his cot, and there was nothing but
time and silence all about them.</p>

<p>Finally Blake spoke again, and now in a voice that was quiet,
lifeless, and curiously sober, as if this outlet and easement of
his grief had also quenched the drunkenness in him.</p>

<p>"Gant?" he said, in a quiet and lifeless tone that penetrated
curiously the grey silence all around them.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Eugene.</p>

<p>"I never met you till today," said Blake, "and I want you to
know I've got no grudge against you."</p>

<p>"Why, Eugene never did anything to you, Emmet," said Robert at
this point, in a tone of protest. "Why should you have anything
against him?"</p>

<p>"Now, <i>wait</i> a minute!" said Blake pugnaciously.
"Eugene," he went on in a maudlin tone of voice, "I'm friends
with everyone, I haven't got an enemy in the world. . . . There's
just one man in this world I hate," he went on sombrely, "and I
hate his guts--I hate his life--Goddamn him! I hate the air he
breathes!" he snarled, and then was silent for a moment.
"Eugene," he went on in a moment, in a low voice, and with a tone
of brooding drunken insinuation, "you know the man I mean, don't
you?"</p>

<p>Eugene made no answer, and in a moment he repeated the
question, in a more insistent and pugnacious tone:</p>

<p><i>"Don't</i> you?" he demanded.</p>

<p>And Eugene said, "Yes."</p>

<p>"You're damned right you do," he said in a low, ruminant, and
brooding tone. "Everybody knows whom I mean. He's a cousin of
yours," said Blake, and then began to mutter to himself:</p>

<p>"I'll kill him! So help me, God, I'll kill him!" And suddenly,
starting from his cot with a scream of baffled misery and
anguish, he began to beat his fist into the hard slate wall
again, yelling:</p>

<p>"I'll kill you! I'll kill you! . . . You son of a bitch, I'll
kill the two of you! . . . I'll send you both to hell where you
belong, if it's the last thing that I ever do!"</p>

<p>And he began to sob horribly and curse foully, and pounded his
fist into the wall again until he was exhausted, and went back
and sat down on his cot again, muttering his drunken and impotent
threats.</p>

<p>And Eugene did not try to answer him, for there was nothing he
could say. George Pentland was his cousin, and had taken Blake's
wife away from him, and got her love; and Blake was dying, and
they knew it. And suddenly it seemed to Eugene that there was in
this whole story something dark and hideously shameful which he
had never clearly seen in life before, which could not be
endured, and which yet suspended over every man who ever lived
the menace of its intolerable humiliation and dishonour.</p>

<p>For to see a man--a manly-looking man, strong of body,
fearless and bold of glance, deep of voice--physically humiliated
and disgraced, slapped and whipped like a cur before his wife,
his mistress, or his children, and forced to yield, retreat and
slink away, to see his face turn white and the look of the coward
shine through his mask of manhood, is not an easy thing to
see.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Presently they heard steps coming along the corridor again,
and they were so certain they belonged to a messenger bringing
them release that they all arose instinctively, and stood before
the barred doors of the cells, waiting to walk out into the air
of freedom again. To their astonishment the visitor was Kitchin.
They had forgotten him completely, and now as they saw him doing
a gleeful caper before their cells, with a grin of triumphant
satisfaction written wide across his face, they looked at him
with the astounded recognition of men who see a face which they
had known years before, but have forgotten--in the lapse of time
and memory.</p>

<p>"Where?--" Robert began hoarsely and accusingly, in a tone of
astounded stupefaction. "Where have <i>you</i> been all this
time?"</p>

<p>"Out front!" said Kitchin exultantly. "Sitting in your
car!"</p>

<p>"Out front!" cried Robert in a bewildered and resentful tone.
"Didn't they lock you up, too?"</p>

<p>"Hell, no!" cried Kitchin, fairly dancing about with gleeful
satisfaction. "They never touched me! And I'd had as much to
drink as any of you. I've been sittin' out front all afternoon
reading the paper! I guess they thought I was the only sober one
of the crowd," he said modestly. And this apparently was the
reason for his astonishing freedom--this and another, more
mercenary reason, which will presently be apparent.</p>

<p>"Why, what do they mean by keeping us locked up back here
while you're out front there reading the paper? Darnedest thing I
ever heard of!" Robert barked. "Kitchin!" he now said angrily.
"You go out there and tell them we want out of here!"</p>

<p>"I told 'em! I told 'em!" Kitchin said virtuously. "That's
what I've been telling them all afternoon."</p>

<p>"Well, what do they say?" Robert demanded impatiently.</p>

<p>"Boys," said Kitchin now, shaking his head regretfully, but
unable to conceal his own elation and sense of triumph, "I've got
news for you--and I'm afraid it's not going to be good news,
either. How much money you got?"</p>

<p>"Money!" Robert cried, in an astounded tone, as if the uses of
this vile commodity had never occurred to him. "What's money got
to do with it? We want out of here!"</p>

<p>"I know you do," said Kitchin coolly, "but you're not going to
get out unless you've got money enough to pay your fine."</p>

<p>"Fine?" Robert repeated stupidly.</p>

<p>"Well, that's what they call it, anyway. Fine or graft, or
whatever the hell it is, you've got to pay it if you want to be
let out."</p>

<p>"How much is it?" said Robert. "How much do they want?"</p>

<p>"Boys," said Kitchin, slowly and solemnly, "have you got
seventy-three dollars?"</p>

<p>"Seventy-three dollars!" Robert shouted. "Kitchin, what are
you talking about?"</p>

<p>"Well, don't shout at me," said Kitchin. "I can't help it! I
didn't do it! But if you get out of here that's what you've got
to pay."</p>

<p>"Seventy-three dollars!" Robert cried. "Seventy-three dollars
for what?"</p>

<p>"Well, Robert," said Kitchin patiently, "you've got to pay
fifty dollars fine and one dollar costs. That's because you were
driving the car. That's fifty-one. And Emmet and Eugene here have
to pay ten dollars apiece and one dollar costs--that's twenty-two
dollars more. That figures up to seventy-three dollars. Have you
got it?"</p>

<p>"Why, the dirty grafting sons of bitches!" Blake now cried.
"Telling us that everything would be all right and that they had
put us in here so we wouldn't hurt ourselves! . . . All right,
you cheap grafting bastards!" he shouted at the top of his lungs,
rattling the barred door furiously as he spoke. "We'll give you
your dirty graft--but wait till I get out of here!" he cried
threateningly. "Just wait till I get out! George Blake will tend
to you!" he shouted. "It'll be the worst day's work <i>you've</i>
ever done!"</p>

<p>But no one answered, although Blake and Robert cursed foully
and shouted insults at the men. Meanwhile Kitchin waited
patiently before their cells until the furious tumult should
subside a little; when they were calmer he suggested that they
pool their resources to see if they had enough to pay the total
of the fines. But the sum of their combined funds was only a
little more than forty dollars, of which Blake and Robert
contributed the greater part and of which Eugene could contribute
less than three dollars, which was all he had.</p>

<p>When it was apparent that their total funds would not be
adequate to secure their release Blake, still furiously angry,
began to talk in a loud and drunken tone of bravado about his
famous uncle, scrawling out a cheque and instructing Kitchin to
go at once to the local agent for his uncle's motor cars and get
the necessary money.</p>

<p>"Any Blake dealer in the country will cash my personal cheque
for fifty thousand dollars any time I need it!" he cried with
extravagant boast, as if he thought this threat of opulence would
strike terror to the hearts of the police. "Yes, sir!" he said.
"All you got to do is to walk into any Blake agency in the
country and tell them George Blake's nephew needs money--and
they'll give you everything they've got!" he cried. "Tell 'em you
need ten thousand dollars," he said, coming down in scale
somewhat, "and they'll have it for you in five minutes."</p>

<p>"Why, Emmet," said Kitchin quietly, and yet with a trace of
mockery and ridicule on his dark, handsome, and rather sly face.
"We don't need fifty thousand dollars. You know, we're not trying
to buy the whole damned jail. Now, I thought," he went on quietly
and ironically, "that all we needed was about thirty or
forty--say fifty dollars--to make up the fine and get us out of
town."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Robert in a quick excited tone of vigorous
agreement. "You're absolutely right! That's all we need, all
right!"</p>

<p>"All <i>right</i>! All <i>right</i>! Go to the Blake dealer!
Go to the Blake dealer! That's what I'm telling you," cried Blake
with an arrogant impatience. "He'll give you anything you
want.--What are you waiting for?" he cried furiously. "Go
<i>on!</i> Go <i>on!"</i></p>

<p>"But Emmet," said Kitchin quietly and reasonably, in his dark
low voice, as he looked at the cheque which Blake had scrawled
out for him. "This cheque you've given me is for five hundred
dollars. Hadn't you better make out another one for fifty? You
know, we don't need five hundred dollars, Emmet. And besides," he
suggested tactfully, "the man might not have that much on hand.
Hadn't you better give me one just made out for what we
need?"</p>

<p>"He'll have it! He's got it! He's <i>got</i> to have it!" said
Blake with a dogmatic and unreasoning arrogance. "Tell him I sent
you and you'll get the money right away!"</p>

<p>Kitchin did not answer him: he thrust the cheque into his
pocket and turned to Eugene, saying quietly:</p>

<p>"Didn't you say your brother was waiting to meet you here at a
hotel?"</p>

<p>"Yes: he expected to meet me at four o'clock when that service
car came in."</p>

<p>"At what hotel?"</p>

<p>"The Blackstone--listen, Kitchin," he reached through the bar
and grabbed him by the arm, with a feeling of cold horror in his
heart. "For Christ's sake, don't drag my brother into this," he
whispered. "Kitchin--listen to me! If you can get this money from
the Blake agent here, for God's sake, do it! What's the use of
bringing my brother into it," he pleaded, "when it's all between
the four of us, and can stay that way? I don't want my family to
know I ever got into any trouble like this. Kitchin, look here--I
can get the money for my fine: I've got a little money in the
bank, and I'll pay Blake every cent I owe him if you get the
money from the agent. Now, promise me you won't go and tell my
brother!"</p>

<p>He held him hard in the tension of desperation, and Kitchin
promised. Then he went swiftly away, and they were left alone in
their cells again. Robert, utterly cast down from his high
exaltation, now cursed bitterly and morosely against the police
and the injustice of his luck and destiny.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Blake, whose final and chief resource, it had now
become pitifully evident, was nothing in himself but just the
accident of birth that had made him nephew to a powerful and
wealthy man, kept declaring in a loud voice of arrogant bravado
that "any Blake agent in the United States will cash my personal
cheque for fifty thousand dollars any time I ask for it! Yes,
sir, any of them--I don't give a damn where it is! He's on his
way here now! You'll see! We'll be out of here in five minutes
now!"--a boastful assurance that was hardly out of his mouth
before they heard steps approaching rapidly along the corridor
and, even as Blake cried out triumphantly, "What did I tell you?"
and as Eugene leaped up and ran to the door of his cell,
clutching the bars with both hands, and peering out with
bloodshot eyes like a caged gorilla, Kitchin entered the
cell-room, followed by a policeman, and--Eugene's brother!</p>

<p>Luke looked at him for a moment with a troubled expression and
said: "Why, how did you get in here? What's happened to you?" he
said, suddenly noticing his battered face. "Are you hurt,
Eugene?"</p>

<p>The boy made no reply but looked at him with sullen
desperation and jerked his head towards the cells where his two
companions were imprisoned--a gesture that pleaded savagely for
silence. And Luke, instantly reading the meaning of that gesture,
turned and called out cheerfully:</p>

<p>"Now you boys just hold on a minute and I'll have you out of
here."</p>

<p>Then he came up close to the barred door of the cell where his
younger brother stood and, his face stern with care, he said in a
low voice: "What happened? Who hit you? Did any of these bastards
hit you? I want to know."</p>

<p>A policeman was standing behind him looking at them with
narrowed eyes, and the boy said desperately:</p>

<p>"Get us out of here. I'll tell you later."</p>

<p>Then Luke went away with the policeman to pay their fines.
When he had gone, Eugene turned bitterly on Kitchin, who had
remained with the boys, accusing him of breaking his word by
going to Luke. Kitchin's dark evasive eyes shifted nervously in
his head as he answered:</p>

<p>"Well, what else could I do? I went to the Blake agent
here--"</p>

<p>"Did you get the money?" Blake said. "Did he give it to
you?"</p>

<p>"Give!" Kitchin said curtly, with a sneer. "He gave me
nothing--not a damned cent! He said he'd never heard of you!"</p>

<p>There was silence for a moment.</p>

<p>"Well, I can't understand that," Blake said at length, feebly,
and in a tone of dazed surprise. "That's the first time anything
like that has ever happened."</p>

<p>At this moment Eugene's brother returned with two policemen,
who unlocked the cell doors and let them out. The feeling of
coming from the cell into free space again was terrific in its
physical intensity: never before had Eugene known the physical
sensations of release as he knew them at that moment. The very
light and air in the space outside the cell had a soaring
buoyancy and freshness which, by comparison, gave to that within
the cell a material and oppressive heaviness, a sense of walled
and mortared space that had pressed upon his heart and spirit
with a crushing weight. Now, suddenly, as if a cord that bound
him had been cut, or a brutal hand that held his life in its
compelling grip had been removed, the sensations of release and
escape filled his body with a sense of aerial buoyancy and the
power of wing-like flight.</p>

<p>With a desperate eagerness he had never felt before he wanted
to feel the free light and air again: even the shocked solicitude
of his companions when they saw his puffed lips and his blackened
eye was drearily oppressive. He thrust past them, muttering,
striding towards the door.</p>

<p>It was the first time in his life that he had ever been
arrested and locked up, and for the first time now, he felt and
understood the meaning of an immense and brutal authority in
life, which he had seen before, but to which he had always
believed himself to be immune. Until that day he had had all the
pride and arrogance a young man knows. Since childhood no one had
ever compelled him to do anything by force, and although he had
seen the million evidences of force, privilege, and compulsion
applied to the lives of people around him, so that like every
other native of the land in which he lived, he had in his heart
no belief in law whatever, and knew that legal justice, where it
was achieved, was achieved by fortuitous accident rather than by
intent, he had believed, as every young man believes, that his
own life and body were fiercely immune to every indignity of
force and compulsion.</p>

<p>Now this feeling was gone for ever. And having lost it
irrecoverably, he had gained something of more value.</p>

<p>For now, he was conscious, even at the moment he came out of
the cell, of a more earthly, common, and familiar union with the
lives of other men than he had ever known. And this experience
was to have another extraordinary effect upon his spirit and its
understanding and love of poetry, which may seem ludicrous, but
which certainly dated from these few hours of his first
imprisonment. Up to this time in his life, the poet who had
stirred him by his power and genius more than any other was the
poet Shelley.</p>

<p>But in the years that followed, Shelley's poetry came to have
so little meaning for him that all the magic substance which his
lines once had was lost, and Eugene seemed to look indifferently
at the hollow shells and ghosts of words, from which all
enchantment and belief had vanished. And he felt this way not
because the words of this great poet now seemed false to him, but
because, more than any other poet he had known, Shelley was the
poet of that time of life when men feel most strongly the sense
of proud and lonely inviolability, which is legible in everything
he wrote, and when their spirits, like his, are also "tameless
and swift and proud." And this is a time of life and magic that,
once gone, is gone for ever, and that may never be recaptured
save by memory.</p>

<p>But in the years that followed, just as Eugene's physical body
grew coarser and more heavy, and his sensual appetites increased
enormously, so also did the energy of his spirit, which in
childhood had been wing-like, soaring, and direct in its aerial
buoyancy, grow darker, slower, heavier, smouldering and slow in
its beginning heat and densely woven and involved in all its
web-like convolutions.</p>

<p>And as all the strength and passion of his life turned more
and more away from its childhood thoughts of aerial flight and
escape into some magic and unvisited domain, it seemed to him
that the magic and unvisited domain was the earth itself, and all
the life around him--that he must escape not out of life but into
it, looking through walls he never had seen before, exploring the
palpable and golden substance of this earth as it had never been
explored, finding, somehow, the word, the key, the door, to the
glory of a life more fortunate and happy than any man has ever
known, and which yet incredibly, palpably, is his, even as the
earth beneath his feet is his, if he could only take it.</p>

<p>And as he discovered this, Eugene turned more and more for
food and comfort to those poets who have found it and who have
left great pieces of that golden earth behind them in their
verse, as deathless evidence that they were there:--those poets
who wrote not of the air but of the earth, and in whose verse the
gold and glory of the earth are treasured--their names are
Shakespeare, Spenser, Chaucer, Herrick, Donne, and Herbert.</p>

<p>Their names are Milton (whom fools have called glacial and
austere, and who wrote the most tremendous lines of earthly
passion and sensuous magic that have ever yet been written),
Wordsworth, Browning, Whitman, Keats, and Heine--their names are
Job, Ecclesiastes, Homer, and The Song of Solomon.</p>

<p>These are their names, and if any man should think the glory
of the earth has never been, let him live alone with them, as
Eugene did, a thousand nights of solitude and wonder, and they
will reveal to him again the golden glory of the earth, which is
the only earth that is, and is for ever, and is the only earth
that lives, the only one that will never die.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>When they got out into the street again, night had almost
come. It was about six o'clock, the lights in the streets had
gone on, and in the figures of the people that went by, and the
motor cars that flashed past sparsely, there was something
hurried, mournful, and departing, like the breath of autumn and
old leaves stirred by wind and driven on.</p>

<p>Neither spoke for some time, nor dared look at the other: the
boy walked with lowered head, his hat pulled down across his
eyes. His lips were puffed and swollen, and his left eye was now
entirely closed, a blind poached swelling of bruised blue. They
passed below a street lamp, paused for a minute in the hard white
glare, turned as if impelled by sombre instinct, and regarded
each other with the stern defenceless eye of shame and sorrow.
Luke looked earnestly at his brother for a second and then said
gently:</p>

<p>"How's your eye, Eugene?"</p>

<p>The boy said nothing: sullenly, steadily, with his one good
eye he returned his brother's look. Luke stared for a minute at
the nauseous, fatted purple where the bad eye was, suddenly
cursed bitterly, turned, and walked ahead.</p>

<p>"The d-d-dirty bastards!" he said. "I've always fought they
were a f-f-fairly decent lot till now, but the nice, damned,
d-d-d-dirty South Car'lina--" he ground his teeth together,
paused again, and turned towards his younger brother: "What
d-d-did they do to you while you were in there? I w-w-w-want to
know what happened."</p>

<p>"I guess I got what was coming to me," the boy muttered. "We
were all drunk, and we were driving pretty fast. So I want you to
know that I'm not making any excuses for that."</p>

<p>"Well," Luke said quietly, "that's all over now, and there's
no use to w-w-worry about it. I guess you're not the f-f-f-first
one that it's happened to. So let's f-f-forget about that." He
was silent for a moment, and then he went on sternly: "But if
those b-b-bastards beat you up while you were in there I
w-w-w-want to know about it."</p>

<p>"I'm not kicking about it," the boy muttered again, because he
was ashamed to tell him of the struggle he had had with the two
policemen. "I guess I had it coming--but there was one thing!" he
said with a surge of bitter feeling as he remembered it. "They
did one thing I don't believe they had any right to do. If it had
happened in the North it would have been all right, but, by God,
I don't believe they have any right in this State to put a white
man in the same cell with a nigger!"</p>

<p>"Did they d-d-d-do that to you?" Luke cried in an excited
voice, stopping short and half turning as he spoke.</p>

<p>"Yes, they did, they tried to," and then he told him what had
happened. Luke turned completely, and started back towards the
station, cursing bitterly.</p>

<p>"C-c-come on!" he said.</p>

<p>"Where are you going?"</p>

<p>"I'm g-g-g-going down there and tell those b-b-b-bastards what
I fink of them!"</p>

<p>"No, you're not! Listen!" Eugene seized his brother by the
arm. "We'll only get locked up again! They've got us and we've
got to take it! We're not going! Let's get out of this damned
town quick as we can! I never want to see the place again!"</p>

<p>Luke paused and stood, distractedly thrusting his fingers
through his hair.</p>

<p>"All right," he said at last. "We'll go. . . . But by
G-g-god," his voice rose suddenly and he shook his fist in the
direction of the station, "I'll be back. I've done business in
this town for years, I've got f-f-f-friends here who are going
goddam well to know the reason why a kid is beaten up and locked
up with a n-n-nigger by the Blackstone cops. I'll see this f'ing
through now if it t-t-t-takes a lifetime!" Then, turning to his
brother, he said shortly: "All right, Gene. C-c-come on. We're
g-g-getting out of town."</p>

<p>Without further speech, they walked on down the street until
they came to the place where Luke's car was parked.</p>

<p>"W-w-w-what do you want to d-d-d-do, Gene?" he said quietly.
"Do you want to go over to D-d-Daisy's tonight?"</p>

<p>The boy shook his head: "No," he said thickly. "Home. Home.
Let's get out of here. Got to go home now."</p>

<p>Luke said nothing for a moment, thrusting his fingers through
his hair. "W-w-w-well," he muttered at length, "perhaps you're
right."</p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h1>XLV</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>They left town at once.</p>

<p>Luke drove savagely going out of town. He kept his big clumsy
hands gripped hard upon the rim of the steering wheel, his brow
knit and furrowed by its ridge of wrinkles, his face taut and
drawn from the tension of his nerves. From time to time he would
thrust his clumsy fingers strongly through his flashing mass of
hair, laugh a wild jeering "whah-whah" of rage and exasperation,
and then say in a voice so packed with sneering bitterness and
contempt that it was hard to keep from laughing at him:</p>

<p>"S--t! Resisting an officer in the p-p-p-p-performance of his
duties! Now ain't that nice?" he said in a voice of mincing
refinement and daintiness. "W-w-w-wy the nice neat nigger-Baptist
God-damned sons of bitches!" he snarled. "The cheap grafting
South Car'lina bastards! D-d-d-d-disorderly conduct! S--t!" he
snarled with a savage, dainty, mincing bitterness that was
somehow wildly and explosively funny.</p>

<p>Meanwhile they were speeding along through quiet streets that
even in the night-time had the worn and faded dustiness of
autumn, past withered lawns, by frame-houses which had the same
faded dusty look, and under trees on which the dry leaves hung
and fluttered: the mournful, worn, weary feeling told of departed
summer, evoked sadly the memory of a savage heat, and the
sorrowful ghosts and omens of the autumn were everywhere about
them. October was there with its strange, brooding presences of
sorrow and delight--its sense of something lost and vanished,
gone for ever, its still impending prescience of something grand
and wild to come. Above them the ragged cloudy sky had cleared:
it was a night of blazing and magnificent stars, set in the
limitless velvet substance of the sky, burning with faint
brilliance and without light over the immense, mysterious, and
mournful-looking earth.</p>

<p>Twice, going out of town, his brother stopped, and both times
with a kind of sudden indecisive after-thought. Once, when they
had passed a little corner drug-store, he jammed the brakes on
suddenly, bringing the car to such an abrupt and jolting halt
that Eugene was flung forward violently against the wind-screen.
He turned to him with a nervous and distracted air of indecision,
saying:</p>

<p>"Do you f-f-f-fink you could go a dope?" (this was the word in
common use for Coca Cola) "W-w-w-would you like a drink?" he
said, with a comical thrusting movement of the head, a wild look
in his eyes, a restless and stammering indecision and
earnestness. The boy told him no, and after a worried and
restless look of his flickering grey eyes, in the direction of
the drug-store, he thrust his large flat foot into the clutch and
started the car in motion again, with the same violent and
jarring movement as when he had halted.</p>

<p>Again, on the very outposts of the town, where there was
nothing but the dusty road, a few cheap frame-houses, sparely,
flimsily, and carelessly built upon the breast of an immense and
formless land, which seemed indifferent to them and with which
they seemed to have no union, and with nothing but the road, the
stars and the huge mysteries of the earth before them, his
brother had halted with another jarring jolt, when they had
flashed past a filling station where, so read a sign, soft drinks
and barbecued sandwiches were for sale.</p>

<p>"How about a b-b-b-barbecued sandwich?" he demanded, looking
at Eugene with a wild and glaring suddenness. "C-c-c-could you go
one? Huh?"--he said, almost barking at him, with a comical
thrusting movement of the head. But even before the boy could
answer, and he saw the sullen and exasperated scowl upon his
face, he thrust his fingers wildly through his hair, burst into a
wild rich "whah-whah" of crazy laughter--a laughter that was all
the more strange and astonishing because even as he laughed the
taut and drawn tension of his face and nerves, and the frenzied
unrest of his eyes, were terribly apparent--and then started the
car in motion again with a jarring, grinding and convulsive jolt.
And Luke could not have said why he had halted at these last two
outposts of the town--the drug-store and the filling station--but
certainly the impulse that had made him halt had little to do
with food or drink, for neither of them was hungry, and they had
no need or desire for further nourishment.</p>

<p>But the impulse which had made his brother halt belonged to
all the dissonance and frenzied unrest of his whole life, and by
thousands of actions such as this, the course and pattern of his
life were shaped. And finally, his brother had halted because
those two small flares of light--pitiful and shabby as they
were--had wakened in him a memory of the vast darkness of the
huge and lonely earth before them, and because he gave himself
into this dark regretfully and with some misgiving of his
soul.</p>

<p>For his spirit was afraid of solitude and darkness and, like
all men in this land, his soul was drawn by the small hard blaze
of incandescence--even by those barren bulbous clusters of hard
light upon the wintry midnight pavements of a little town--which
somehow pitifully and terribly suggest the fear and loneliness in
men's souls, the small hard assurances of manufactured light
which they have gathered as some beacon of comfort and security
against a dark too vast and terrible, an earth too savage in its
rudeness, space, and emptiness, for the spirit and the strength
of men.</p>

<p>And now his brother and he were given to this earth, this
dark, this loneliness again. And as they rushed on into the
darkness, held, save for the throbbing motor of the little car,
in the immutable silence of the earth and darkness, the
flickering headlights of the car would suddenly pierce into the
huge surrounding mystery of night, lunging for an instant the
flashing finger of their light upon some fugitive and secret
presence in the vault of night, where all the million lives of
men were held. Sometimes the flashing light would blaze upon the
boarding of a little house at the bend of the road, and then the
house would flash behind and be engulfed in darkness.</p>

<p>Sometimes it would reveal the brown and dusty stubble of the
cotton-fields, a stretch of ragged pine, a lonely little wooden
church, a shack, a cabin, the swift and sinuous forking of
another road that spoked into their own, flashed past, and curved
away--was gone for ever--leaving an instant and intolerable pain
and memory--a searing recognition and discovery--a road once seen
but never followed and now for ever lost with all its promises of
a life that they had never known or explored, of faces they had
never seen.</p>

<p>And again, out of this huge and mournful earth, out of the
limitless mystery of this continent of night, the lights upon his
brother's car would for an instant pick out faces, shapes, and
people, and they, too, would blaze there for a moment in their
vision with an intolerable and lonely briefness, and then be lost
for ever--and in that moment of instant parting and farewell was
written the history of man's destiny--his brother's life, and
that of all men living on the earth around him.</p>

<p>Once their lights picked out the figure of a country negro:
his weary plodding figure loomed up for an instant dustily--a
mournful image of bowed back, shapeless garments stained with red
field earth, and clumsy brogans coated with the red dust of the
road, plodding along against a terrific and desolate landscape of
brown cotton-fields, clay, and lonely pine, as much a part of it
as the earth he walked upon, fixed instantly into it in a vision
of labour, sorrow, and destiny, that was eternal.</p>

<p>And again they passed by negroes coming from a country church,
and for a moment saw their white eyes and their black and
mournful faces staring towards the light, and lost these, too,
for ever, and passed into a little town and out again, and saw
far-off, and at its edges, a pollen of bright light above a
little travelling carnival, and heard the sad wheeling music of
the carousal, the mixed and woven clamour of the barker's cries,
the shouts, the people's voices, and all far-faint and lost and
mournful as a dream; and then the earth again--the two back
wheels, clay-caked and rattling, of an ancient buggy, the lifting
hooves of an old bone-yard nag, that slowly turned away from the
road's centre to make way for them, the slow, staring, stupid
looks of wonder and astonishment of a young country fellow and
his girl as they went by them--and finally, always and for ever,
nothing but the earth--that mournful, desolate, and lonely earth
of cotton-fields, and raw red clay and lonely pine, wheeling past
for ever in rude and formless undulations, immemorable,
everlasting, and terrific, above which the great stars blazed
their imperturbable and inscrutable messages of deathless
calm.</p>

<p>And as they rushed ahead into the dark, he thought of the
hundreds of times his brother had hurled himself along this road
at night alone, going furiously from nowhere into nowhere,
rushing ahead with starlight shining on his knit brows and his
drawn face, with nothing but the lonely, mournful, and desolate
red clay earth about him, the immense, the merciless emptiness
and calm of the imperturbable skies above him. And he wondered if
there was anywhere on earth a goal for all his frenzy and unrest,
some final dwelling-place of certitude and love for all his
wandering, or if he must hurl furiously along in darkness beneath
these stars for ever--lost, unassuaged, and driven--until the
immense and mournful earth should take him once again.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>The ride back up into the hills with Luke was cold, dark,
bleak, and desolate--the very painting of his own sick soul.
Black night had come when they had reached the mountains. The
stars were out, and around them the great bulk of the hills was
barren, bleak, and wintry-looking, and there was the distant
roaring of demented winds upon the hills, the lonely preludes of
grim winter among the barren trees. Already, it seemed, the same
landscape which only a day or two before had flamed with all the
blazing colours of October, and with the enchantment which his
hope and joy had given it, had been sorrowfully transformed by
the mournful desolation of coming winter. The earth was no longer
beautiful and friendly: it had become a waste, a desert, and a
prison bleak and bare.</p>

<p>During the ride up the mountain into Old Catawba the two
brothers spoke seldom to each other. Luke, who had made that dark
journey up into the hills a thousand times--for whom, in fact,
this ceaseless hurtling along dark roads had become the very
pattern of the unrest and fury that lashed his own life on for
ever--drove hard and raggedly, communicating perfectly to the
machine he drove the tension and dissonance of his own tormented
spirit. This wordless instrument of steel and brass and leather
seemed, in fact, to start, halt, jolt, stammer, and lunge
fiercely onward as if it had a brain and spirit of its own that
was in anguished sympathy with the tortured nerves that governed
it. His brother drove, bent forward tensely, his large clumsy
hands gripped hard and nervously upon the steering-wheel, as he
peered out upon the ribbon of road before him, which bent and
twisted in a bewildering serpentine that curved constantly upward
along the slopes and flanks of the dark mountain-side. The boy
sat cold and numb and sick at heart, hands thrust in pockets, his
hat pulled low across his eyes, his overcoat turned up around his
neck. He glanced at his brother once or twice. He could see his
face drawn and taut and furrowed in the dim light, but when he
tried to speak to him he could not. The sense of ruin, shame, and
failure which filled his spirit seemed so abysmal and complete
that there was nothing left to say. And he faced the meeting with
his mother and his sister with a sick heart of dread.</p>

<p>Once going up the mountain-side his brother stopped, jamming
his huge flat foot so rudely on the brake that the car halted
with a jarring shuddering thud. They had just passed a road of
unpaved clay which led off from the mountain road towards the
right, and towards a farmhouse and a light or two which were
clearly visible.</p>

<p>Now, looking nervously and uncertainly toward this house, Luke
muttered, almost to himself, thrusting his hand through his hair
with a distracted movement as he spoke: "Wy-wy-wy-I fink we could
g-g-g-get a drink in here wy--if you'd like one. Wy-wy-I know the
old fellow who lives there . . . he's a moonshiner--wy-wy-I
fink--would you like to stop?" he said abruptly and then, getting
no answer from the younger one, he gave another worried and
uncertain look in the direction of the house, thrust his fingers
through his hair, and muttered to himself: "W-w-w-well, perhaps
you're right--maybe it's j-j-j-just as well if we g-g-g-get home
wy-wy-wy-I guess that Mama will be waiting up for us."</p>

<p>When they reached town the hour was late, the streets had a
wintry, barren, and deserted look, and the lights burned dim:
from time to time another motor car would flash by them speedily,
but they saw few people. As they drove across the Square it
seemed almost to have been frozen in a cataleptic silence, the
bulbous clusters of the street lamps around the Square burned
with a hard and barren radiance--a ghastly mocking of life, of
metropolitan gaiety, in a desert scene from which all life had by
some pestilence or catastrophe of nature been extinguished. The
fountain in the Square pulsed with a cold breezeless jet, and
behind the greasy windows of a luncheon room he could see a man
in a dim light seated on a stool and drinking coffee, and the
swart muscular Greek leaned over the counter, his furrowed inch
of brow painfully bent upon the columns of a newspaper.</p>

<p>As they turned into the street where stood his mother's house,
and sloped swiftly down the hill toward home, his brother, in a
tone that tried in vain to be matter of fact and to conceal the
concern and pain which his own generous spirit felt because of
the feeling of defeat, failure, and desperation which was now
legible in every word and gesture of the younger one, began to
speak to him in a nervous, almost pleading voice:</p>

<p>"N-n-now I fink," he began, thrusting his big hand through his
hair,--"I--wy I fink when we get home wy--I just wouldn't say
anything to Mama about--wy-wy about that trouble--wy--that we had
in Blackstone--wy--at all!" he blurted out. "Wy--f-f-f-frankly, I
mean it!" he continued earnestly, as he brought the car to a
jolting halt before the house. "Wy-wy--if I were in your
p-p-place, Gene--wy I'd just forget it. . . . It's all over
now--and it would only worry M-m-m-mama if you t-t-told her about
it--Wy-wy--the whole f'ing's over now . . . those--wy--those
cheap nigger-Baptist South Car'lina sons of bitches--wy-wy--just
saw the chance of m-m-making a martyr of you--so I'd j-j-just
forget about it--It's all over now--Wy-wy--f-f-f-forget it!" he
cried earnestly. "I--I--wy I wouldn't fink about it again!"</p>

<p>But the younger one, seeing the light that burned warmly
behind the drawn shades of the parlour, set his sick heart and
his grim face desperately towards the light, shook his head
silently, and then walked grimly towards the house.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>He found his mother and his sister seated together in the
parlour before the fire. In another moment, almost before their
first startled words of greeting were out of their mouths, he was
blurting out the story of his drunkenness, arrest, and
imprisonment. As he went on, he could see his mother's face,
white, serious, eagerly curious, fixed upon him, and her
powerful, deliberate, and curiously flexible mouth which she
pursed constantly, darting her eyes at him from time to time with
the quick, startled attentiveness of an animal or a bird, as she
said sharply: "Hah? . . . What say? . . . The police, you say? .
. . Jail? . . . Who was with you--hah? Emmet Blake? . . . Weaver?
. . . How much did they fine you--hah?"</p>

<p>Meanwhile his sister sat listening quietly, with an absent yet
intent look in her eyes, stroking her large cleft chin in a
reflective manner with her big hand, smiling a little, and saying
from time to time:</p>

<p>"Ah-hah? . . . And what did Blake say then? . . . What did you
say to the nigger when you saw him in the cell? . . . Ah-hah. . .
. They didn't abuse you, did they? . . . Did they hurt you when
they hit you? . . . Ah-hah. . . . And what did Luke say when he
saw you looking through the bars?" She snickered hoarsely, and
then, taking him by the hand, turned to her mother and in a
kindly yet derisive tone said:</p>

<p>"Here's your Harvard boy. . . . What do you think of your baby
now?" And seeing the gloomy and miserable look upon his face, she
laughed her high, husky, and derisive falsetto, prodding him in
the ribs with her big finger, saying: "K-k-k-k! . . . This is our
Harvard boy! . . . Hi, hi, hi, hi, hi! . . . Here's your baby
son, Miss Eliza!" Then, releasing his hand and turning to her
mother, she said in a good-natured tone, in which yet a kind of
melancholy satisfaction was evident: "Well, you see, don't you? .
. . It just goes to show you, doesn't it? . . . I knew it all the
time. . . . It just goes to show that we're all the same beneath
the skin. . . . We're all alike. . . . We all like the stuff . .
. with all his book education and going off to Harvard, he's no
different from Papa, when you come down to it," she concluded
with a note of sombre brooding satisfaction in her voice.</p>

<p>"Wy-wy-wy--" he could see Luke teetering nervously from one
huge flat foot to another, thrusting his huge hand distractedly
through his flashing hair as he attempted to stammer out an
earnest and excited defence and justification for his
disgrace:</p>

<p>"Wy-wy-wy I don't believe that Gene was drunk at all!" he
stammered. "Wy I fink wy--that he j-j-j-just had the bad luck to
wy to f-f-f-fall in with that gang when they were drinking and
and and--wy I f'ink those wy those B-B-B-B-Blackstone bastards
just saw a chance wy of collecting a wy a little graft and and
and wy j-j-just made Gene the goat. Wy f-f-f-frankly I don't
believe he was drunk at all. . . . Wy I doubt it very much," he
said, thrusting his fingers through his hair. "F-f-f-frankly, I
do."</p>

<p>"I was drunk!" the boy muttered sullenly and miserably.
"Drunker than any of them. . . . I was the worst of the lot."</p>

<p>"You see, don't you?" his sister said again to her mother in a
weary, kindly, yet triumphant tone. "You see what happens, don't
you? . . . I've known it. . . . I've known it all the time," she
said with sombre satisfaction. ". . . No, sir," she shook her
head with a movement of emphatic conviction, as if someone had
disputed her argument, "you can't change them! . . . You can't
change the leopard's spots. . . . Murder will out. . . . You
can't tell me!" she cried again, shaking her head in a movement
of denial. "Blood is thicker than water. But you see, don't you?"
she said again with this curiously kindly yet triumphant
satisfaction; and then added illogically: "This is what comes of
going to Harvard."</p>

<p>And his mother, who had been following this broken and almost
incoherent discourse of his brother and sister with the quick,
startled darting and attentive glances of an animal or a bird,
now said nothing. Instead she just stood looking at him, her
broad worn hands held at the waist for a moment in a loose strong
clasp, her face white and stern, and her mouth pursed in a strong
pucker of reproach. For a moment it seemed that she would speak,
but suddenly her worn brown eyes were hot with tears, she shook
her head at him in a strong, convulsive and almost imperceptible
tremor of grief and disappointment, and turning quickly with a
rapid awkward movement of her short figure, she went out of the
room as fast as she could, slamming the door behind her.</p>

<p>When she had gone there was silence for a minute, save for the
gaseous flare and crumble of the coal-fire in the grate and the
stertorous, nervous and uneasy labour of Luke's breath. Then his
sister turned to him and looking at him with eyes which had grown
dead and lustreless, and in a tone that was full of the sombre
and weary resignation that was now frequent when she spoke, she
said: "Well, forget about it. She'll get over it. . . . You will,
too. . . . It's done now, and it can't be helped . . . So forget
it. . . . I know, I know," she said with a sombre, weary, and
fatal resignation as she shook her head. "We all have these great
dreams and big ambitions when we're twenty. . . . I know. . . . I
had them, too. . . . Don't break your heart about it, Gene. . . .
Life's not worth it. . . . So forget it. . . . Just forget about
it. . . . You'll forget," she muttered, "like I did."</p>

<p>Later that night, when his sister had departed for her home
and his brother had gone to bed, he sat with his mother in the
parlour looking at the fire. Blundering, stumbling incoherently,
he tried desperately to reassure her, to tell her of his
resolution to expiate his crime, to retrieve his failure, somehow
to justify her in the faith and support she had given him. He
spoke wildly, foolishly, desperately, of a dozen plans in
progress, promising everything, swearing anything, and sure of
nothing. He told her he was ready to go to work at once, to do
any work that he could find--like a drowning man he clutched
wildly at a dozen straws--he would get a job on the paper as a
reporter; he would teach school; there were great sums of money
to be made from advertising, he had a friend in that profession,
he was sure he would succeed there; he felt sure that Professor
Hatcher could get him placed at some small college teaching drama
and play-writing courses; someone had told him he could find
employment editing the little magazine or "house organ" of a
department store in the city; a friend at college had secured
employment as librarian of an ocean liner; another made large
sums of money selling floor-mops and brushes to the housewives of
the Middle West--he blurted out the foolish and futile projects
feverishly, clutching at straw after straw, and halted abruptly,
baffled by her silence and by the sudden sickening realization
that he no longer had a straw to clutch at--how foolish, futile,
feeble all these projects were!</p>

<p>As for his mother, she sat staring straight into the fire and
made no answer. Then, for a long time, he sat there melancholy,
saying nothing, while the woman looked straight ahead, hands
clasped across her waist, looking into the fire with a fixed
stare of her white face and puckered mouth. At length she
spoke:</p>

<p>. . . "I have brought them all into the world," she said
quietly, "and seen them all grow up . . . and some are dead now .
. . and some have done nothing with their lives. . . . You were
the youngest, and the last . . . my only hope. . . . Oh, to see
them all, all go the same way . . . to hope and pray year after
year that there would be one of them who would not fail--and
now!" her voice rose strongly, and she shook her head with the
old convulsive tremor, "to think that you--the one on whom my
hope was set--the one who has had the education and the
opportunity that the others never had--should go the way that the
others went. . . . It's too bad to bear!" she cried, and suddenly
burst into tears. "Too much to ask of me!" she whispered huskily,
and suddenly drew the sleeve of the old frayed sweater across her
weak wet eyes, with the pathetic gesture of a child--a gesture
that tore him with a rending anguish of pity, shame and
inexpiable regret. "Too hard . . . too hard," she whispered.
"Surely there's a curse of God upon us if after all the pain and
sorrow all are lost."</p>

<p>And he sat there sick with shame, self-loathing and despair,
unable to reply. And then he heard again the remote demented
howling of the wind, the creaking of bare boughs, the vast dark
prowling of the beast of night about his mother's house. And
again he heard, as he had heard a thousand times in childhood,
far, faint, and broken by the wind, the wailing whistle of a
distant train. It brought to him, as it had brought to him so
many times, the old immortal promises of flight and darkness, the
golden promises of morning, new lands and a shining city. And to
his sick and desperate soul the cry of the great train now came
with a sterner and more desperate hope than he had ever known as
a boy. Suddenly he knew that now there was one road, and only one
before him--flight from this defeat and failure which his life
had come to, redemption by stern labour and grim loneliness, the
stern challenge, the sharp peril and the grand reward--the magic
and undying image of the city. And suddenly he knew that he would
go.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>The night before he went away he went out and prowled
restlessly about the streets of the town until the hour was very
late. A letter from a friend had informed them that there was
hope of a teaching appointment at one of the city universities,
later, when the spring term began. Meanwhile, a swift exchange of
telegrams had promised him temporary employment in New York,
soliciting funds from alumni of his university for a memorial
building. And uncertain, specious, and disheartening as this
employment seemed to him, he had eagerly seized the offer when it
came. He was leaving home the next day.</p>

<p>Now, sick of soul and driven by the unquiet heart, the furious
unrest, he prowled the barren night-time streets of his native
town. The Square was bleak and lifeless and deserted, with its
hard glare of lights: along the main street of the town a few
belated citizens hurried past from time to time, faces and voices
he remembered from his childhood, driven by like ghosts.
Everything he saw and touched was strange and familiar as a
dream--a life which he had known utterly and which now vanished
from his grasp whenever he approached it--his for ever, buried in
his blood and memory, never to be made his own again.</p>

<p>When he returned home it was after midnight and his mother's
old gaunt house was dark. He went quietly up the steps and into
the broad front hall, closing the heavy door quietly behind him.
For a minute he stood there in that living dark, the ancient and
breathing darkness of that old house which seemed to speak to him
with all the thousand voices of its vanished lives--with all the
shapes and presences of things and people he had known, who had
been there, and who had passed or vanished, or had died.</p>

<p>Then quietly he groped his way along the dark old hall and
towards the kitchen and the little room beyond in which his
mother slept.</p>

<p>When he got to the kitchen the room was dark save for the soft
flare and crumble of the fading ashes in the old coal range. But
the kitchen was still warm, with a curious and recent currency of
warmth and silence, as if it were still filled with his mother's
life and as if she had just been there.</p>

<p>He turned on the light and for a minute stood looking at the
familiar old table with its sheathing of ragged battered zinc,
and at the ironing board with its great stack of freshly ironed
and neatly folded linen; and he knew that she had worked there
late.</p>

<p>Suddenly, a desperate urge, an overmastering desire to see
her, speak to her, awoke in him. He thought that if he could only
see her now he could reveal himself to her, explain the purpose
of his failure, the certainty of his success. He was sure that
now, if ever, he could speak to her and say the things he had
always wished to say but never said--speak the unspeakable, find
a tongue for the unspoken language, make her understand his life,
his purpose, and his heart's desire, as he had never done before.
And filled with this wild hope, this impossible conviction, he
strode towards the closed door of her little room to arouse
her.</p>

<p>Then, abruptly, he paused. Upon an old cupboard, in a glass
half-filled with water, he saw, as he had seen a thousand times,
grinning at him with a prognathous, a strangely human bleakness,
the false teeth she had put there when she went to bed. And
suddenly he knew he could not speak to her. For grotesque, ugly,
and absurd as they were, those grinning teeth evolved for him,
somehow, as nothing else on earth could do, the whole image of
his mother's life of grief and toil and labour--the intolerable
memories of the vanished and the irrevocable years, the strange
and bitter miracle of life. And he knew then that he could not
speak, that there was nothing he could say to her.</p>

<p>He rapped gently at the door and in a moment heard her voice,
quick, sharp, and startled, roused from sleep, saying: "Hah? . .
. what say? . . . who's there?"</p>

<p>He answered: in a moment she opened the door and stood there,
her face startled, curiously small and white and sunken, somehow
like a child's. When he spoke to her she answered incoherently:
and then she smiled in an apologetic and embarrassed manner, and
covered her mouth shyly with one hand, while she extended her
other for the glass that held her teeth. He turned his head away:
when he looked again her face had taken on its familiar contour,
and she was saying in her usual tone: "Hah? . . . What is it,
son?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, Mama," he said awkwardly. "I--I didn't know you were
asleep . . . I--I--just came in to say good night, Mama."</p>

<p>"Good night, son," she said, and turned her white cheek up to
him. He kissed it briefly.</p>

<p>"Now go and get some sleep," she said. "It's late and you've
all your packing to do yet when you get up tomorrow."</p>

<p>"Yes," he said awkwardly. ". . . I guess you're right. . . .
Well, good night." And he kissed her again.</p>

<p>"Good night," she said. "Turn out the lights, won't you,
before you go to bed."</p>

<p>And as he turned the kitchen light out he heard her door close
quietly behind him, and the dark and lonely silence of the old
house was all around him as he went down the hall. And a thousand
voices--his father's, his brothers', and of the child that he
himself had been, and all the lives and voices of the hundred
others, the lost, the vanished people--were whispering to him as
he went down the old dark hall there in his mother's house. And
the remote demented wind was howling in the barren trees, as he
had heard it do so many times in childhood, and far off,
far-faint and broken by the wind he heard the wailing cry of the
great train, bringing to him again its wild and secret promises
of flight and darkness, new lands, and a shining city. And there
was something wild and dark and secret in him that he could never
utter. The strange and bitter miracle of life had filled him and
he could not speak, and all he knew was that he was leaving home
for ever, that the world, the future of dark time and of man's
destiny lay before him, and that he would never live here in his
mother's house again.</p>

<p> </p>

<h1>XLVI</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>As the train was pounding north across New Jersey another
train upon the inside track began to race with it, and for a
distance of ten miles the two trains thundered down the tracks in
an even, thrilling, and tremendous contest of steel and smoke and
pistoned wheel that blotted out everything, the vision of the
earth, the thought of the journey, the memory of the city, for
all who saw it.</p>

<p>The other train, which was bound from Philadelphia, appeared
so calmly and naturally that at first no one suspected that a
race was on. It came banging up slowly, its big black snout
swaying and bucking with a clumsy movement as it came on, its
shining pistons swinging free and loose, and with short
intermittent blasts of smoke from its squat funnel. It came up so
slowly and naturally, past their windows, that at first it was
hard to understand at what terrific speed the train was running,
until one looked out of the windows on the other side and saw the
flat, formless and uncharactered earth of New Jersey whipping by
like pickets on a fence.</p>

<p>The other train came slowly on with that huge banging movement
of the terrific locomotive, eating its way up past the windows,
until the engine cab was level with Eugene and he could look
across two or three scant feet of space and see the engineer. He
was a young man cleanly jacketed in striped blue and wearing
goggles. He had a ruddy colour and his strong pleasant face,
which bore on it the character of courage, dignity, and the
immense and expert knowledge these men have, was set in a
good-natured and determined grin, as with one gloved hand held
steady on the throttle he leaned upon his sill, with every energy
and perception in him fixed with a focal concentration on the
rails. Behind him his fireman, balanced on the swaying floor, his
face black and grinning, his eyes goggled like a demon, and lit
by the savage flare of his terrific furnace, was shovelling coal
with all his might. Meanwhile, the train came on, came on, eating
its way past, foot by foot, until the engine cab had disappeared
from sight and the first coaches of the train drew by.</p>

<p>And now a wonderful thing occurred. As the heavy rust-red
coaches of the other train came up and began to pass them, the
passengers of both trains suddenly became aware that a race
between the trains was taking place. A tremendous excitement
surged up in them, working its instant magic upon all these
travellers, with their grey hats, their grey, worn city faces,
and their dull tired eyes, which just the moment before had been
fastened wearily on the pages of a newspaper, as if, having been
hurled along this way beneath the lonely skies so many times, the
desolate face of the earth had long since grown too familiar to
them, and they never looked out of windows any more.</p>

<p>But now the faces that had been so grey and dead were flushed
with colour, the dull and lustreless eyes had begun to burn with
joy and interest. The passengers of both trains crowded to the
windows, grinning like children for delight and jubilation.</p>

<p>Eugene's train, which for a space had been holding its rival
even, now began to fall behind. The other train began to slide
past the windows with increasing speed, and when this happened
the joy and triumph of its passengers were almost unbelievable.
Meanwhile their own faces had turned black and bitter with
defeat. They cursed, they muttered, they scowled malevolently,
they turned away with an appearance of indifference, as if they
had no further interest in the thing, only to come back again
with a fascinated and bitter look as their accursed windows slid
by them with the inevitability of death and destiny.</p>

<p>Throughout, the crews of the two trains had shown as keen and
passionate an interest, as intense a rivalry, as had the
passengers. The guards and porters were clustered at the windows
or against the door in the car-ends, and they grinned and jeered
just as the rest of them had done; but their interest was more
professional, their knowledge more intimate and exact. The guard
on the train would say to the porter--"Whose train is that? Did
you see John McIntyre aboard?" And the negro would answer
positively, "No, sah! Dat ain't Cap'n McIntyre. Ole man Rigsby's
got her. Dere he is now!" he cried, as another coach moved past
and the grizzled and grinning face of an old guard came in
sight.</p>

<p>Then the guard would go away, shaking his head, and the negro
would mutter and chuckle to himself by turns. He was a fat
enormous darkey, with an ink-black skin, a huge broad bottom,
teeth of solid grinning white, and with a big fatty growth on the
back of his thick neck. He shook like jelly when he laughed.
Eugene had known him for years, because he came from his native
town, and the Pullman car in which he rode, which was known as K
19, was the car that always made the journey of 700 miles between
his home town and the city. Now the negro sprawled upon the green
upholstery of the end seat in the Pullman and grinned and
muttered at his fellows in the other train.</p>

<p>"All right, boy. All right, you ole slew-footed niggah!" he
would growl at a grinning darkey in the other train. "Uh! Uh!" he
would grunt ironically. "Don't you think you's somp'n, dough!
You's pullin' dat train yo'self, you is!" he would laugh
sarcastically, and then sullenly and impatiently conclude, "Go
on, boy! Go on! I sees you! I don't care how soon I loses you! Go
on, niggah! Go on! Git dat ugly ole livah-lipped face o' yo'n out
o' my way!"</p>

<p>And that grinning and derisive face would also vanish and be
gone, until the whole train had passed them, pulled ahead of
them, and vanished from their sight. And their porter sat there
staring out of the window, chuckling and shaking his head from
time to time, as he said to himself, with a tone of reproof and
disbelief:</p>

<p>"Dey ain't got no right to do dat! Dey ain't go no right to
run right by us like we wasn't here!" he chuckled. "Dey ain't
nothin' but a little ole Philadelphia local! Dey're not supposed
to make de time we is! We's de Limited! We got de outside rail!"
he bragged, but immediately, shaking his head, he said: "But
Lawd, Lawd! Dat didn't help us none today. Dey've gone right on
by us! We'll never ketch dem now!" he said mournfully, and it
seemed that he was right.</p>

<p>Eugene's train was running in free light and open country now,
and the passengers, resigned finally to defeat, had settled back
into their former dozing apathy. But suddenly the train seemed to
start and leap below them with a living energy, its speed
increased visibly, the earth began to rush by with an ever-faster
stroke, the passengers looked up and at one another with a
question in their eyes and an awakened interest.</p>

<p>And now their fortune was reversed, the train was running
through the country at terrific speed, and in a moment more they
began to come up on the rival train again. And now, just as the
other train had slid by them, they began to walk by its windows
with the calm imperious stride of their awakened and irresistible
power. But where, before, the passengers of both trains had
mocked and jeered at one another, they now smiled quietly and
good-naturedly, with a friendly, almost affectionate, interest.
For it seemed that they--the people in the other train--now felt
that their train had done its best and made a manful showing
against its mighty and distinguished competitor, and that they
were now cheerfully resigned to let the Limited have its way.</p>

<p>And now their train walked up past the windows of the
dining-car of the other: they could see the smiling
white-jacketed waiters, the tables covered with their snowy-white
linen and gleaming silver, and the people eating, smiling and
looking toward them in a friendly manner as they ate. And then
they were abreast the heavy parlour cars: a lovely girl,
blonde-haired, with a red silk dress and slender shapely legs
crossed carelessly, holding an opened magazine face downward in
one hand and with the slender tapering fingers of the other
curved inward towards her belly where they fumbled with a charm
or locket hanging from a chain, was looking at them for a moment
with a tender and good-natured smile. And opposite her, with his
chair turned towards her, an old man, dressed elegantly in a
thin, finely-woven and expensive-looking suit of grey, and with a
meagre, weary, and distinguished face that had brown spots upon
it, was sitting with his thin phthisical shanks crossed, and for
a moment Eugene could see his lean hands, palsied, stiff, and
folded on his lap, and the brown spots on them, and he could see
a corded, brittle-looking vein upon the back of one old hand.</p>

<p>And outside there was the raw and desolate-looking country,
there were the great steel coaches, the terrific locomotives, the
shining rails, the sweep of the tracks, the vast indifferent
dinginess and rust of colours, the powerful mechanical
expertness, and the huge indifference to suave finish. And inside
there were the opulent green and luxury of the Pullman cars, the
soft glow of the lights, and people fixed there for an instant in
incomparably rich and vivid little pictures of their life and
destiny, as they were all hurled onward, a thousand atoms, to
their journey's end somewhere upon the mighty continent, across
the immense and lonely visage of the everlasting earth.</p>

<p>And they looked at one another for a moment, they passed and
vanished and were gone for ever, yet it seemed to him that he had
known these people, that he knew them better than the people in
his own train, and that, having met them for an instant under
immense and timeless skies, as they were hurled across the
continent to a thousand destinations, they had met, passed,
vanished, yet would remember this for ever. And he thought the
people in the two trains felt this, also: slowly they passed each
other now, and their mouths smiled and their eyes grew friendly,
but he thought there was some sorrow and regret in what they
felt. For, having lived together as strangers in the immense and
swarming city, they now had met upon the everlasting earth,
hurled past each other for a moment between two points in time
upon the shining rails, never to meet, to speak, to know each
other any more, and the briefness of their days, the destiny of
man, was in that instant greeting and farewell.</p>

<p>Therefore, in this way, they passed and vanished, the coaches
slipped away from them until again they came up level with the
cab of the other locomotive. And now the young engineer no longer
sat in his high window with a determined grin, and with his hard
blue eyes fixed on the rail. Rather, he stood now in the door,
his engine banging away deliberately, slowed down, bucking and
rocking loosely as they passed. His attitude was that of a man
who has just given up a race. He had turned to shout something at
his fireman who stood there balanced, arms akimbo, black and
grinning, as they moved up by them. The engineer had one gloved
hand thrust out against the cab to support him, he held the other
on his hip and he was grinning broadly at them, with solid teeth
edged with one molar of bright gold--a fine, free, generous, and
good-humoured smile, which said more plainly than any words could
do: "Well, it's over, now! You fellows win! But you'll have to
admit we gave you a run for your money while it lasted!"</p>

<p>Then they drew away and lost the train for ever. And presently
their own train came in to Newark, where it stopped. And
suddenly, as Eugene was looking at some negroes working there
with picks and shovels on the track beside the train, one looked
up and spoke quietly to the fat porter, without surprise or any
greeting, as casually and naturally as a man could speak to
someone who has been in the same room with him for hours.</p>

<p>"When you comin' back dis way, boy?" he said.</p>

<p>"I'll be comin' back again on Tuesday," said the porter.</p>

<p>"Did you see dat ole long gal yet? Did you tell huh what I
said?"</p>

<p>"Not yet," the porter said, "but I'll be seein' huh fo' long!
I'll tell yo' what she says."</p>

<p>"I'll be lookin' fo' you," said the other negro.</p>

<p>"Don't fo'git now," said the fat black porter, chuckling; and
the train started, the man calmly returned to work again; and
this was all. What that astounding meeting of two black atoms
underneath the skies, that casual incredible conversation meant,
he never knew; but he did not forget it.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>And the whole memory of this journey, of this race between the
trains, of the negroes, of the passengers who came to life like
magic, crowding and laughing at the windows, and particularly of
the girl and of the vein upon the old man's hand, was fixed in
Eugene's brain for ever. And like everything he did or saw that
year, like every journey that he made, it became a part of his
whole memory of the city.</p>

<p>And the city would always be the same when he came back. He
would rush through the immense and glorious stations, murmurous
with their million destinies and the everlasting sound of time,
that was caught up for ever in their roof--he would rush out into
the street, and instantly it would be the same as it had always
been, and yet for ever strange and new.</p>

<p>He felt as if by being gone from it an instant he had missed
something priceless and irrecoverable. He felt instantly that
nothing had changed a bit, and yet it was changing furiously,
unbelievably, every second before his eyes. It seemed stranger
than a dream, and more familiar than his mother's face. He could
not believe in it--and he could not believe in anything else on
earth. He hated it, he loved it, he was instantly engulfed and
overwhelmed by it.</p>

<p>He brought to it the whole packed glory of the earth--the
splendour, power, and beauty of the nation. He brought back to it
a tremendous memory of space, and power, and of exultant
distances; a vision of trains that smashed and pounded at the
rails, a memory of people hurled past the window of his vision in
another train, of people eating sumptuously from gleaming silver
in the dining cars, of cities waking in the first light of the
morning, and of a thousand little sleeping towns built across the
land, lonely and small and silent in the night, huddled below the
desolation of immense and cruel skies.</p>

<p>He brought to it a memory of the loaded box-cars slatting past
at fifty miles an hour, of swift breaks like openings in a wall
when coal cars came between, and the sudden feeling of release
and freedom when the last caboose whipped past. He remembered the
dull rusty red, like dried blood, of the freight cars, the
lettering on them, and their huge gaping emptiness and joy as
they curved in among raw piny land upon a rusty track, waiting
for great destinies in the old red light of evening upon the
lonely, savage, and indifferent earth; and he remembered the
cindery look of road-beds and the raw and barren spaces in the
land that ended nowhere; the red clay of railway cuts, and the
small hard lights of semaphores--green, red, and yellow--as in
the heart of the enormous dark they shone, for great trains
smashing at the rails, their small and passionate assurances.</p>

<p>He brought to it the heart, the eye, the vision of the
everlasting stranger, who had walked its stones, and breathed its
air, and, as a stranger, looked into its million dark and driven
faces, and who could never make the city's life his own.</p>

<p>And finally he brought to it the million memories of his
fathers who were great men and knew the wilderness, but who had
never lived in cities: three hundred of his blood and bone, who
sowed their blood and sperm across the continent, walked beneath
its broad and lonely lights, were frozen by its bitter cold,
burned by the heat of its fierce suns, withered, gnarled, and
broken by its savage weathers, and who fought like lions with its
gigantic strength, its wildness, its limitless savagery and
beauty, until with one stroke of its paw it broke their backs and
killed them.</p>

<p>He brought to it the memory and inheritance of all these men
and women who had worked, fought, drunk, loved, whored, striven,
lived and died, letting their blood soak down like silence in the
earth again, letting their flesh rot quietly away into the stern,
the beautiful, the limitless substance of the everlasting earth
from which they came, from which they were compacted, on which
they worked and wrought and moved, and in whose immense and
lonely breast their bones were buried and now lay, pointing
eighty ways across the continent.</p>

<p>Above the pounding of the mighty wheels their voices had
seemed to well out of the everlasting earth, giving to him, the
son whom they had never seen, the dark inheritance of the earth
and the centuries, which was his, even as his blood and bone were
his, but which he could not fathom. "Whoever builds a bridge
across this earth," they cried, "whoever lays a rail across this
mouth, whoever stirs the dust where these bones lie, let him go
dig them up, and say his Hamlet to the engineers. Son, son,"
their voices said, "is the earth richer where our own earth lay?
Must you untwist the vine-root from the buried heart? Have you
unrooted mandrake from our brains? Or the rich flowers, the big
rich flowers, the strange unknown flowers?</p>

<p>"You must admit the grass is thicker here. Hair grew like
April on our buried flesh. These men were full of juice, you'll
grow good corn here, golden wheat. The men are dead, you say?
They may be dead, but you'll grow trees here; you'll grow an oak,
but we were richer than an oak: you'll grow a plum tree here
that's bigger than an oak, it will be all filled with plums as
big as little apples.</p>

<p>"We were great men and mean men hated us," they said. "We were
all men who cried out when we were hurt, wept when we were sad,
drank, ate, were strong, weak, full of fear, were loud and full
of clamour, yet grew quiet when dark came. Fools laughed at us
and witlings sneered at us: how could they know our brains were
subtler than a snake's? Because they were more small, were they
more delicate? Did their pale sapless flesh sense things too fine
for our imagining? How can you think it, child? Our hearts were
wrought more strangely than a cat's, full of deep twistings,
woven sinews, flushing with dull and brilliant fires; and our
marvellous nerves, flame-tipped, crossed wires too intricate for
their fathoming.</p>

<p>"What could they see," the voices rose above the sound of the
wheels with their triumphant boast, "what could they know of men
like us, whose fathers hewed the stone above their graves, and
now lie under mountains, plains, and forests, hills of granite,
drowned by a flooding river, killed by the stroke of the
everlasting earth? Now only look where these men have been
buried: they've heaved their graves up in great laughing lights
of flowers--do you see other flowers so rich on other graves?</p>

<p>"Who sows the barren earth?" their voices cried. "We sowed the
wilderness with blood and sperm. Three hundred of your blood and
bone are recompacted with the native earth: we gave a tongue to
solitude, a pulse to the desert, the barren earth received us and
gave back our agony: we made the earth cry out. One lies in
Oregon, and one, by a broken wheel and horse's skull, still grips
a gunstock on the Western trail. Another one has helped to make
Virginia richer. One died at Chancellorsville in Union blue, and
one at Shiloh walled with Yankee dead. Another was ripped open in
a bar-room brawl and walked three blocks to find a doctor,
holding his entrails thoughtfully in his hands.</p>

<p>"One died in Pennsylvania reaching for a fork: her reach was
greater than her grasp; she fell, breaking her hip, cut off from
red rare beef and roasting-ears at ninety-six. Another whored and
preached his way from Hatteras to the Golden Gate: he preached
milk and honey for the kidneys, sassafras for jaundice, sulphur
for uric acid, slippery-ellum for decaying gums, spinach for the
goitre, rhubarb for gnarled joints and all the twistings of
rheumatism, and pure spring water mixed with vinegar for that
great ailment dear to Venus, that makes the world and Frenchmen
kin. He preached the brotherhood and love of man, the coming of
Christ and Armageddon by the end of 1886, and he founded the Sons
of Abel, the Daughters of Ruth, the Children of The Pentateuch,
as well as twenty other sects; and finally he died at eight-four,
a son of the Lord, a prophet, and a saint.</p>

<p>"Two hundred more are buried in the hills of home: these men
got land, fenced it, owned it, tilled it; they traded in wood,
stone, cotton, corn, tobacco; they built houses, roads, grew
trees and orchards. Wherever these men went, they got land and
worked it, built upon it, farmed it, sold it, added to it. These
men were hill-born and hill-haunted: all knew the mountains, but
few knew the sea.</p>

<p>"So there we are, child, lacking our thousand years and ruined
walls, perhaps, but with a glory of our own, laid out across
three thousand miles of earth. There have been bird-calls for our
flesh within the wilderness. So call, please, call! Call the
robin red-breast and the wren, who in dark woods discover the
friendless bodies of unburied men!</p>

<p>"Immortal land, cruel and immense as God," they cried, "we
shall go wandering on your breast for ever! Wherever great wheels
carry us is home--home for our hunger, home for all things except
the heart's small fence and dwelling-place of love.</p>

<p>"Who sows the barren earth?" they said. "Who needs the land?
You'll make great engines yet, and taller towers. And what's a
trough of bone against a tower? You need the earth? Whoever needs
the earth may have the earth. Our dust, wrought in this land,
stirred by its million sounds, will stir and tremble to the
passing wheel. Whoever needs the earth may use the earth. Go dig
us up and there begin your bridge. But whoever builds a bridge
across this earth, whoever lays a rail across this mouth, whoever
needs the trench where these bones lie, let him go dig them up
and say his Hamlet to the engineers."</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>So had their hundred voices welled up from the earth and
called to him, their son and brother, above the pounding of the
mighty wheels that roared above them. And the memory of their
words, their triumphant tongue of deathless silence, and the full
weight of the inheritance they had given him, he brought back
again out of the earth into the swarming canyons and the million
tongues of the unceasing, the fabulous, the million-footed
city.</p>

<p>And all that he had seen, all that he remembered of this earth
he brought to the city, and it seemed to be the city's
complement--to feed it, to sustain it, to belong to it. And the
image of the city, written in his heart, was so unbelievable that
it seemed to be a fiction, a fable, some huge dream of his own
dreaming, so unbelievable that he did not think that he should
find it when he returned; yet it was just the same as he had
remembered it. He found it, the instant he came out of the
station: the tidal swarm of faces, the brutal stupefaction of the
street, the immense and arrogant blaze and sweep of the great
buildings.</p>

<p>It was fabulous and incredible, but there it was. He saw again
the million faces--the faces dark, dingy, driven, harried, and
corrupt, the faces stamped with all the familiar markings of
suspicion and mistrust, cunning, contriving, and a hard and
stupid cynicism. There were the faces, thin and febrile, of the
taxi-drivers, the faces cunning, sly, and furtive, the hard
twisted mouths and rasping voices, the eyes glittering and toxic
with unnatural fires. And there were the faces, cruel, arrogant
and knowing of the beak-nosed Jews, the brutal heavy figures of
the Irish cops, and their red beefy faces, filled with the
stupid, swift, and choleric menaces of privilege and power,
shining forth terribly with an almost perverse and sanguinary
vitality and strength among the swarming tides of the grey-faced
people. They were all there as he remembered them--a race
mongrel, dark, and feverish, swarming along for ever on the
pavements, moving in tune to that vast central energy, filled
with the city's life, as with a general and dynamic fluid.</p>

<p>And, incredibly, incredibly! these common, weary, driven,
brutal faces, these faces he had seen a million times, even the
sterile scrabble of harsh words they uttered, now seemed to be
touched by this magic of now and forever, this strange and
legendary quality that the city had, and to belong themselves to
something fabulous and enchanted. The people, common, dull,
cruel, and familiar-looking as they were, seemed to be a part, to
comprise, to be fixed in something classic, and eternal, in the
everlasting variousness and fixity of time, in all the fabulous
reality of the city's life: they formed it, they were part of it,
and they could have belonged to nothing else on earth.</p>

<p>And as he saw them, as he heard them, as he listened to their
words again, as they streamed past, their stony gravel of harsh
oaths and rasping cries, the huge single anathema of their bitter
and strident tongues dedicated so completely, so constantly, to
the baseness, folly, or treachery of their fellows that it seemed
that speech had been given to them by some demon of everlasting
hatred only in order that they might express the infamy and
vileness of men, or the falseness of women--as he listened to
this huge and single tongue of hatred, evil, and of folly, it
seemed incredible that they could breathe the shining air without
weariness, agony, and labour--that they could live, breathe, move
at all among the huge encrusted taint, the poisonous congestion
of their lives.</p>

<p>And yet live, breathe, and move they did with a savage and
indubitable violence, an unfathomed energy. Hard-mouthed,
hard-eyed, and strident-tongued, with their million hard grey
faces, they streamed past upon the streets for ever, like a
single animal, with the sinuous and baleful convolutions of an
enormous reptile. And the magical and shining air--the strange,
subtle and enchanted weather, was above them, and the buried men
were strewn through the earth on which they trod, and a bracelet
of great tides was flashing round them, and the enfabled rock on
which they swarmed swung eastward in the marches of the sun into
eternity, and was masted like a ship with its terrific towers,
and was flung with a lion's port between its tides into the very
maw of the infinite, all-taking ocean. And exultancy and joy rose
with a cry of triumph in his throat, because he found it
wonderful.</p>

<p>Their voices seemed to form one general City-Voice, one
strident snarl, one twisted mouth of outrage and of slander bared
for ever to the imperturbable and immortal skies of time, one
jeering tongue and rumour of man's baseness, fixed on the visage
of the earth, and turned incredibly, and with an evil fortitude,
toward depthless and indifferent space against the calm and
silence of eternity.</p>

<p>Filled with pugnacious recollection that Voice said, "'Dis
guy,' I says, 'dis friend of yoehs,'" it said, "'dis bastad who
owes me fawty bucks--dat yuh introduced me to--when's he goin' t'
giv'it to me?' I says." And derisive, scornful, knowing, it would
snarl: <i>"W'ich</i> guy? <i>W'ich</i> guy do yuh mean? Duh guy
dat used to come in Louie's place?" And bullying and harsh it
would reply: <i>"Yuh</i> don't know? Watcha mean yuh don't know!"
. . . Defiant, <i>"Who</i> don't know? . . . <i>Who</i> says so?
. . . <i>Who</i> told yuh so?" And jeering, "Oh <i>dat</i> guy! .
. . Is <i>dat</i> duh guy yuh mean? An' wat t' hell do <i>I</i>
care wat he t'inks, f'r Chris' sake! . . . To hell wit' him!" it
said.</p>

<p>Recounting past triumphs with an epic brag, it said: "'You're
comin' out of dere!' I said. 'Wat do you t'ink of dat?' . . .
'Oh, yeah,' he says, 'who's goin' t' make me?' So I says, 'You
hoid me--yeah! . . . You're goin' to take dat little tin crate of
yoehs right out of deh! You'll take yoeh chance right on duh line
wit' all duh rest of us!' . . . 'Oh, yeah,' he says. . . . 'You
hoid me, misteh'--an' he went!" In tones of ladylike refinement,
it recounted romance into ravished ears as follows: "'Lissen,' I
says, 'as far as my boss is consoined it's bizness only. . . .
An' as far as Mr. Ball is consoined it's my own bizness' (hah!
hah! hah! Y'know that's wat I tol' him. . . . Jeez: it handed him
a laugh, y'know!)--'An afteh five o'clock,' I says, 'I'm my own
boss. . . . At duh same time,' I says, 'deh's duh psychological
side to be considehed.'"</p>

<p>And with the sweet accent of maternal tribulation, it
admitted, "Sure! I hit her! I did! Oh, I hit her very hahd! Jeez!
It was an awful crack I gave her, honestleh! My hand was boinin'
f'r a half-oueh aftehwads! . . . I just blow up, y'know! . . .
Dat's my on'y reason f'r dat! I jus' blow up! Dis fellah's in duh
bathroom callin' f'r his eggs, duh baby's yellin' f'r his bottle,
an' I jus' blow up! . . . Dat's my on'y reason f'r <i>dat!</i>
Dat's duh on'y reason dat I hit her, see! I'm afraid she'll hoit
duh baby, see? She bends its fingehs back. So I says, 'F'r God's
sake, please, don't do dat! . . . I gotta headache' . . . an'
then, I jus' blow up! Sure! I hit her hahd! . . . Duh trouble is
I can't stop wit' one slap, see! . . . Jeez! I hit her! My hand
was boining f'r a half-oueh aftehwads!"</p>

<p>Hot with its sense of outraged decency, it said, "I went
upstairs an' pounded on dat doeh! . . . 'Come out of dere, you s.
of a b.,' I says--Sure, I'm tellin' yuh! Dat's what I said to
her, y'know! . . . 'Come out of dere,' I says, 'before I t'row
you out,'" and regretfully it added, "Sure! I hate to do dese
t'ings--it makes me feel bad lateh--but I won't have dem in my
place. Dat's duh one t'ing I refuse t'do," it said. And with a
passionate emotion, it asserted, "Sure! . . . Dat's what I'm
tellin' yuh! . . . Yuh know how dat was, don't cha? Duh foist
guy--her husban'--was passin' out duh sugah an' duh otheh
guy--duh boy-friend--was layin' her. Can yuh ima-a-gine it?" it
said.</p>

<p>Amazed, in tones of stupefaction, it would say "No kiddin'!
<i>No!"</i> And with solemn reprehension it would add, "Oh, yuh
know I think that's te-e-ri-bul! I think that's aw-w-ful!"--the
voice of unbelieving horror would reply.</p>

<p>Finally, friendly and familiar, the great Voice of the city
said, "Well, so long, Eddy. I'm goin' t' ketch some sleep," it
said, and answered, "Well, so long, Joe, I'll be seem' yuh." "So
long, Grace," it added with an accent of soft tenderness and
love, and the huge Voice of the city murmured, "O.K. kid! Eight
o'clock--no kiddin'--I'll be deh!"</p>

<p>Such were some of the million tongues of that huge single
Voice, as he had heard them speak a thousand times, and as now
instantly, incredibly, as soon as he came back to them, they
spoke again.</p>

<p>And as he listened, as he heard them, their speech could not
have been more strange to him had they been people from the
planet Mars. He stared gape-mouthed, he listened, he saw the
whole thing blazing in his face again to the tone and movement of
its own central, unique, and incomparable energy. It was so real
that it was magical, so real that all that men had always known
was discovered to them instantly, so real he felt as if he had
known it for ever, yet must be dreaming as he looked at it;
therefore he looked at it and his spirit cried:</p>

<p>"Incredible! Oh, incredible! It moves, it pulses like a single
living thing! It lives, it lives, with all its million
faces"--and this is the way he always knew it was.</p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h1>XLVII</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>That year--the first year that he lived there in the city--he
was twenty-three years old. After these months of frenzy,
drunkenness, and arrest, he was at the last gasp of his
resources, and the eighteen hundred dollars a year, which was his
salary at the university that had employed him as an instructor,
seemed to him a wage of princely munificence--a stroke of
incredible good fortune.</p>

<p>And although his position as instructor had been given to him
in one of the usual ways, through the recommendation of the
teachers' bureau at Harvard University, and the letters of some
of the professors there, he was tortured constantly by the
thought of his inadequacy and ignorance, and by the horrible fear
that his incompetence would be discovered and that one day he
would be suddenly, peremptorily, ruinously, and disgracefully
discharged.</p>

<p>At night, when he went to bed in his little cell at the cheap
little hotel nearby where he lived, the thought of the class he
had to meet the next day fed at his heart and bowels with cold
poisonous mouths of fear, and as the hour for a class drew nigh
he would begin to shake and tremble as if he had an ague; the
successive stages of his journey from his room in the Leopold to
the class-room at the university a few hundred yards away--from
cell to elevator, from the tiled sterility of the hotel lobby to
the dusty beaten light and violence of the street outside, thence
to the brawling and ugly corridors of the university, which
drowned one, body and soul, with their swarming, shrieking,
shouting tides of dark amber Jewish flesh, and thence into the
comparative sanctuary of the class-room with its smaller horde of
thirty or forty Jews and Jewesses all laughing, shouting,
screaming, thick with their hot and swarthy body-smells, their
strong female odours of rut and crotch and arm-pit and cheap
perfume, and their hard male smells that were rancid, stale, and
sour--the successive stages of this journey were filled with such
dazed numbness, horror, fear, and nauseous stupefaction as a man
might feel in the successive stages of a journey to the gallows,
the guillotine, or the electric chair: the world swarmed blindly,
nauseously, drunkenly about him. He looked at the faces in the
hotel lobby, the brawling, furious, and chaotic street, and the
swarming and rancid corridors, with dizzy swimming eyes and a
constricted heart; a thousand unutterable and horrible
premonitions and imaginings of ruin and shame swarmed through his
mind--every day he felt the impending menace of some new and
fatal catastrophe, some indefinable and crushing disgrace with
which each hour was ominously, murderously pregnant.</p>

<p>What these fears and forebodings were he could not have told,
but they occasionally found articulate expression in some scene
of frightful insubordination and rebellion, in which he found
himself faced with forty brawling, mocking, swarthily jeering
faces who, like savage and untamed horses that have sensed the
fear and incompetence of their driver, have now broken the last
feeble thread of restraint and are running free and wild before
him. The terror and menace of such a disgrace were heightened by
the intrusion into the scene at the apex of such a moment of riot
and rebellion of one of his employers, the Dean, the head of the
department, or a creature with a wry lean face, a convulsive
Adam's apple, a habit of writhing his lean belly and loins
erotically as he spoke, and a mind of the most obscene
Puritanism, who was employed to oversee the work and methods of
the instructors: he could visualize the moment of their fatal
entrance into the class-room, and hear their words of stern, curt
and immediate dismissal as they drove him out and gathered the
reins strongly into their own parched and freckled hands.</p>

<p>A thousand such images of disgrace and terror swarmed through
his mind, and at the same time there began to smoulder in his
heart a dogged resentment and hatred of this nameless fear, this
wordless and sourceless shame, impalpable, causeless, maddening,
which pressed upon him from the sky, which hovered in the vast
unrest and dissonance of the air he breathed, and which at length
crept poisonously through all the rivers of life, corrupting the
healthy music of the blood, the sweet exultant music of the
heart, curdling men's bowels with fear and withering their loins
with sterile impotence. What was this grey lipless shape of fear
that stalked their lives incessantly--that was everywhere,
legible in the faces, the movements, and the driven frenzied
glances of the people who swarmed on the streets? What was this
thing that duped men out of joy, tricked them out of all the
exultant and triumphant music of the world, drove them at length
into the dusty earth, cheated, defrauded, tricked out of life by
a nameless phantom, with all their glory wasted?</p>

<p>Already, in the city, he had begun to see how life was duped
and menaced by this cheat: a thousand images of cruelty,
violence, cowardice and dishonour swarmed about him in the
streets. As the sparkling and winy exultancy of October, with its
grand and solemn music of death and life, of departure and
return, moved on into the harsh, raw, green implacability of
winter, one could observe the death of joy and hope, the
barometric rise of hate and fear and venom in the city's life: it
got into the faces of the people, it wasted their flesh and
corrupted their blood, it glittered in the eyes of the
instructors at the university, their flesh got green and yellow
with its poisons, the air about them was webbed, cross-webbed,
and counter-webbed with the dense fabric of their million spites
and hatreds. They wasted and grew sick with hate and poison
because another man received promotion, because another man had
got his poem printed, because another man had eaten food and
swallowed drink and lain with women, and lived and would not die;
they sweltered with hate and fear against the professors who
employed them--they grew pale and trembled, and spoke
obsequiously when their employer passed, but when the man had
gone, they whispered with trembling lips: "Has he spoken to you
yet? . . . Has he said anything to you yet about next year? . . .
Are you coming back next year? . . . Did he say anything to you
about <i>me</i> next year? . . ." They greeted him with sly
humility and a servile glance, but they snickered obscenely at
him when his back was turned. And they smiled and sneered at one
another with eyes that glittered with their hate: they never
struck a blow but they spoke lying words of barbed ambiguity,
they lied, cheated, and betrayed, and they sweltered in the
poisons of their hate and fear, they breathed the weary
hatred-laden air about them into their poisoned lungs.</p>

<p>Around him in the streets, again, as winter came, he heard a
million words of hate and death: a million words of snarl and
sneer and empty threat, of foul mistrust and lying slander:
already he had come to see the poisonous images of death and
hatred at work in the lives of a million people--he saw with what
corrupt and venomous joy they seized on every story of man's
dishonour, defeat, or sorrow, with what vicious jibe and jeer
they greeted any evidence of mercy, honesty, or love.</p>

<p>By night, the hard and sterile lights of their glittering,
barren and obscene streets fell lividly over the pale and swarthy
faces of a million rats of the flesh, and by day, in the weary
and hatred-laden air of the university, the harsh and merciless
light shone on the venomous faces of the rats of the spirit.</p>

<p>In his heart a dogged and furious resentment was beginning to
glow and moulder--a savage hate of hate, a fear of fear, a
murderous intensity of desire to strangle the shapes of death and
barrenness--a resistance, still passive, but growing in
bitterness and pugnacity with every passing day, as he saw how
uselessly and horribly men allowed themselves to be duped,
cheated, and beaten by the living rat and by the fraud of fear,
and that was being strengthened momently now by an implacable
conviction, a dogged and incontrovertible memory that, incredibly
sharpened by his fury and desire, awoke and netted out of the
sea-depths of the past, the shining fish of a million living
moments. The sound of forest waters in the night, the rustling of
cool corn-blades in the dark, the goat-cries of a boy into the
wind, the pounding of great wheels upon a rail, the sound of
quiet casual voices at a country station in the night, and the
thorn of delight, the tongueless cry of ecstasy that trembles on
the lips of the country kid as he lies awake for the first time
in the night in the top berth of a Pullman car while the great
wheels pound beneath him toward the city, and he hears the
good-looking woman in the berth below him stir languorously and
move, in a gesture of heavied and sensual appeasement, her milky
thighs.--These things had been upon the earth, past all the
mockery of the old scornmaker's pride, and would endure for ever.
These facts, together with a thousand more--the incredible magic
of the peach bloom in the month of April, the smell of rivers
after rain, the wordless glory and first green of a young tree
seen in a city street at daybreak in the month of May, the
bird-song breaking into light once more, a cry, a leaf, the
passing of a cloud--these facts, as bright as herrings in a
shining water, as literal as nails to fix the hides of falsehood
to the wall, as real as April and all magic whatsoever, returned
now under the furious light of his awakened and incontrovertible
memory.</p>

<p>A murderous hatred against the haters, the mockers, dupers,
cheaters, and all of the walking frauds of death rose up in him.
He resolved to kill the phantoms of this fear and shame which
pressed upon him namelessly; he swore that he should not starve
in the midst of plenty, batter his knuckles bloody on the four
walls of a little cell, break the great shoulder of his power and
strength against a barren wall, prowl ceaselessly and damnably a
million sterile streets, in which there was neither pause nor
curve nor stay, nor door, to enter: he knew there was earth for
his feet, food for his hunger, liquor for his thirst, the
exultant reality of strong golden joy for all the savage passion
of his conviction and desire, and he swore that he should come at
length to doors and harbours, he knew he would not starve and
sicken in the wilderness, and that the venomous rats of the flesh
and of the spirit should never gnaw his bones in triumph in the
desert.</p>

<p>Yet, the sense of drowning daily in the man-swarm returned to
him. Each day there began anew one of the most ancient and fatal
struggles that was ever waged--the struggle of man against the
multitude: each day, like a man who is going into battle, he
would brace himself with savage resolution, and gird his spirit
to the sticking point each time he went out in the streets, and
each day, beaten, driven, trembling and inchoate, drowned in
horror and oblivion, he would at length retreat into the four
walls of his cell again, conscious only of having passed through
a maelstrom of sound, movement, violence, and living tissue--of
living tissue from which all of the radiant and succulent
essences of individual character and memory had been
extracted--and which flowed constantly back and forth along the
beaten pavement in a lava-like tide of tallowy flesh, dark dead
eyes, and grey felt hats. The grey felt hats, in particular,
those machine-made millions of neat cheap cones of crisp grey
felt, all worn in the same way, and tilted at the same angle, and
for the most part shading faces of the same tallowy
texture--those million points of changeless grey that bobbed and
moved incessantly through a thousand streets--drowned him with
their tidal flow of weariness and sterility: they seemed to be
the badge, the uniform, of a race of mechanical creatures, who
were as essential and inhuman a part of the city's substance as
stone and steel and brick, who had been made of one essential
substance and charged with one general and basic energy along
with the buildings, tunnels, streets, and a million glittering
projectiles of machinery, and who flowed by incessantly, were
poured into tunnels or driven through streets, were added to
here, and thinned out there, were portioned, doled, and celled
out in a million destinations, a thousand swarming heaven-daring
hives, the mindless and unwitting automatons of a gigantic and
incomprehensible pattern.</p>

<p>But if he retreated daily, out of this savage and unequal
struggle with the Herculean forces of the city, if he returned
trembling, beaten and exhausted to the hermitage of his own small
cell, it was with no sense of final defeat, no desire for
ultimate escape. His pride and fury grew from every beating that
they got, his faith grew stubborn on adversity, his spirit fed
upon humiliation, and spat into the face of failure, his soul
plunged darkly to the sea-floor of blind horror, swarming
desolation, and came up dripping with a snarl of hatred and
defiance: daily they beat him with their blind appalling mass,
daily they drove him livid, shaking, blind with horror, back into
his cell, so stunned and stricken by the savage, obscene, and
mindless fury of the streets that he could no longer think, feel,
or remember; and hour by hour his soul swam upwards out of the
jungles of the sea! And every night, the merciful anodyne of dark
restored him; sunk deep, at length, in midnight, beastwise aprowl
in all the brooding silence of the night, his spirit swept out
through the fields of sleep, he heard the heartbeats of six
million men: within their million cells sleep crossed the faces
of six million sleepers and in the night-time, in the dark, in
all the living silence of the night, the sleeping faces of
Snodgrass, Weisberg, and O'Hare were strange and dark as his. He
saw the city with the great giant webbing of its thousand
streets, he heard the long deep notes of warning and departure
from the great ships in the harbour; and then he saw the city as
a whole, six million sleepers celled in sleep and walled in
night, and girdled by the bracelet of two flashing sea-borne
tides that isled them round: he held them legible as minted gold
within his hand, he saw them plain as apples in the adyts of his
brain. Exultant certitude and joy welled up in him, and he knew
that his hunger could eat the earth, his eye and brain gulp down
the vision of ten thousand streets, ten million faces; he knew he
should beat and eat them all one day, and that a man was more
than a million, stronger than a wall, and greater than a door,
and taller than a ninety-storey tower.</p>

<p>They swept around him on the rootless pavements in drowning
tides of grey abomination, of numberless depth and horror, and
like the memory of a bird-song in the wood, the memory of all his
people who had lived and died alone for two hundred years within
the wilderness, and whose buried bones were pointing eighty ways
across the continent, returned to him in a rush of savage
resolution, and he swore that he would beat death and nothingness
and all the abominations of a sterile and nameless fear: he swore
it with a sick heart, a trembling lip, and a nauseous stomach in
which the rancid wash of a sour distressful coffee growled and
rumbled queasily--for in those months, this sense of nameless
fear and dread, impending ruin, disgrace and menace, was so great
each time he went to meet a class, its damnable victory over all
the clean and healthful music of the flesh, the exultant joy of
thirst and hunger, so complete and devastating, that he was
unable to touch a mouthful of food for hours in advance.</p>

<p>Thus, while a thousand such images of disgrace and terror
swarmed through his mind, he stood before each class on a small
raised platform three or four inches in height, trembling on
limbs from which every vital essence of blood and bone and marrow
had been drained, staring at the faces that seethed and swarmed
below him, with dead glazed eyes, nauseous, and sick, and
palsied, left only with something clear and small and shining at
the bottom of his mind, one pure small note of conviction and
belief at the bottom of this horrible sea-depth of phantasmagoric
chaos, of desolation and fury. Then, in a voice that was remote,
unreal, and hollow in his throat and ears, he would attempt to
silence them, he would begin to speak to them, and one by one,
each in his accustomed place, he would see the dark, ugly,
grinning faces in their seats below him and become aware of the
pale sweat-shop tailors sitting cross-legged on their tables in
the buildings just across the street--buildings which the
university was acquiring as class-rooms, year by year, and one by
one, as the numberless thousands of these dark and brawling
hordes, there by God knows what blind fantasticality of purpose,
increased.</p>

<p>And then, faint and far, sunken below the furious glare and
clamour of the city's life, fantastic and unreal at first in
these machine shops of the brain, the old words, the undying
words, the deathless bird-song in the city street returned, and
he spoke to them again out of the lips of Herrick, Donne, and
Shakespeare, of all the things that never change, of all the
things that would abide for ever.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>"When to the sessions of sweet silent thought I summon up
remembrance of things past--" Clang--a-lang--a-lang--a-lang
a-lang! Hard and harsh with the violence of an unexpected blow,
the bell that marked the ending of the period rang pat upon the
last word of the sentence and as it died, all of his senses
rudely shocked out of the potent enchantments of the music, he
gave a violent start, as if he had been prodded from behind,
stopped reading, and looked up quickly from his book with an
angry and bewildered face. The class, which had tittered, now
burst into a roar of laughter: even Mr. Abraham Jones from his
accustomed seat on the third row to the right smiled, wearily,
cruelly, and contemptuously behind the winking glitter of his
glasses. Eugene lost his temper completely, lifted the heavy book
above his head with both hands and banged it down upon the table.
"Quiet!" he shouted, "I tell you to be quiet!" The command was
unnecessary, for they had become instantly and craftily silent in
response to his violent gesture, they stared at him meekly and
dumbly, with a kind of stricken dullness, and already ashamed of
his outburst he picked up the heavy book again, fumbled with
trembling fingers for the poem, and said: "You can go after I've
finished reading the poem: it won't take but a moment more!"</p>

<p>The class stirred restlessly, there was a little mutter of
protest, Abe smiled bitterly, shaking his head with a slight sigh
of weary indifference. He glanced up quickly and caught them in a
series of sly communications: at the back of the room Sadie
Feinberg, her fat neck half-turned to the right, was whispering
out of the corner of her mouth to Miss Bessie Weisman; to the
left Mr. Sidney Osherofsky was whispering rapidly and cynically
behind his hand to Mr. Nathan Shulemovitch; and on the right-hand
side of the room Mr. Sol Grebenschik was carrying on a guttural
but animated conversation with Mr. Sam Vucker. Almost everyone in
the class of thirty people, in fact, was either engaged in
conversation or preparing to engage in conversation. Only Abe
Jones and Mr. Boris Gorewitz remained faithful. Mr. Boris
Gorewitz always remained faithful. He sat on the front row close,
very close, ah, fragrantly, odorously close, too, too close to
his teacher! He took notes. When beauty was revealed he smiled
murkily, showing large white wet-looking teeth. When passion was
indicated he looked stern and thoughtful: he was deeply stirred
and polished his glasses. When some stupid question had been
asked, or some opinion expressed with which he did not agree, he
smiled contemptuously, shook his head violently from side to
side, saying, "Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah!" quite loudly and thrust
his short dirty fingers vigorously and impatiently through the
dry crinkly mass of hair that rushed back sproutily from his
bulbous forehead, while Abe turned and glanced at him angrily,
bitterly, mockingly, turning his cruel grinning Yiddish face to
Eugene with a soft "Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho!" of contemptuous
laughter.</p>

<p>The class had now become so absorbed in its private
conversations that it was not for a moment aware of its
instructor nor of the fierce accusation of his glance. His face
would grow dark and swollen with a rush of blood and passion, he
would begin to tremble with rage, veins stood out on his
forehead. Then in a very extraordinary way, through a sort of
comical intuition, silence would come upon the class again: Mr.
Osherofsky, who had turned in his seat and was talking behind his
hand to Mr. Shulemovitch, gradually became aware that something
was amiss from the expression of Mr. Shulemovitch's face, which
altered so subtly that almost without changing a muscle, it
indicated that it was no longer aware of Mr. Osherofsky, that it
was not listening to him, that it did not know him, that it
wished he would go away, and that it was absorbed in its own
meditation. Abruptly Mr. Osherofsky ceased talking, his small
bright eyes shifted around rapidly at Eugene, and immediately his
gaze plunged intently into his book, while his face took on an
expression of sly humility.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Miss Feinberg, who was now so completely absorbed
in her conversation with Miss Weisman that she had twisted around
almost completely to the back, received a sharp warning prod and
a meaningful frown from her companion, accompanied by a
significant lifting of the eyebrows. Miss Feinberg at once
flopped heavily around in her seat, her heavy face fixed upon
Eugene in an expression of vacant and insolent meekness. A loose
smile faintly touched the corners of her lax heavy mouth: her
jaws ruminated slightly at a wad of gum. Mr. Gorewitz during this
commotion had turned in his seat and swept the faces of his
comrades with a glance full of scornful reproof. Now he hissed
loudly at them: "Sh-h! Sh-h! Sh-h!" Then, as a heavy silence fell
upon the room, he turned in his seat and looked up at Eugene with
an expression of understanding and commiseration. He shook his
head pityingly, with a scornful smile, as he thought of these
souls living in darkness and unwilling to admit the light! Then
his own face darkened! Let them wallow in ignorance if they
liked, but let them remember that other people were seeking for
truth and beauty! Let them show some consideration for others!
Then his gaze softened, a glow of tenderness suffused his oily
features, as he gazed upon Eugene's infuriated face: he looked at
him now with love, with reverence, with adoration, and with the
sympathy of a kindred spirit! His eloquent glance said:--"The
poet, the prophet, the seer such as you, has at every time in
history been mocked and misunderstood by the philistine mob. Why
should you suffer so, dear teacher? You are above them. They can
never know you or appreciate you as I do. Despise them, beloved
master. Cast not your pearls before swine."</p>

<p>This devoted and tender message had been lost, however, on his
instructor: Eugene's face was set in a fixed glare of rage as he
regarded his class. For a moment he was absolutely
speechless.</p>

<p>"If anyone thinks," he began at length in a voice that was
small and choked with fury, "that I am here--" apparently someone
did think so, for at this moment, slowly, craftily, the knob of
the door began to move, slowly the door swung open as if
propelled by a ghostly hand. He paused again, and this time
murder sweltered in his heart and was legible upon his face.
Softly with the tread of a cat he stepped toward the door, and
paused as if getting ready to spring, while it opened: the class
waited tensely with held breath. Then, as slowly as the door had
opened, a face was thrust in through the opening: it was the face
of one of the hall guards, the face of an old man, a face of
unutterable melancholy and of the most dismal sourness: the old
dull face with its dry sagging flesh and its small watery eyes
turned slowly on its scrawny neck, surveying Eugene, the class,
and the four walls of the room in a glance full of dislike and
suspicion. Then slowly and craftily, as it had come, as if it had
been thrust forward on a stick by some unseen hand, the face
withdrew, and the door swung to silently once again.</p>

<p>For a moment Eugene stared at the closing door with an
expression of stupefaction. Then suddenly a surge of humour,
powerful, choking, explosive, and tongueless in its unutterable
and wordless implication, welled up in his throat. He cast the
book from him with a roar of laughter in which the class
joined.</p>

<p>"Get out of here," he shouted. "I'm through! That's enough. Go
away! Leave me alone!"</p>

<p> </p>

<h1>XLVIII</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>The Hotel Leopold, where he now lived, was situated on a short
and grimy street about two blocks from the university, northward,
in the direction of Union Square.</p>

<p>The Leopold, although one of the city's smaller hotels, was
not a single building, but a congeries of buildings which covered
an entire block. The central and main building of the system was
a structure of twelve storeys, of that anomalous stone and brick
construction which seems to have enjoyed a vogue in the early
nineteen hundreds. To the left was a building twenty or thirty
years older, known as "the old annex." It was eight storeys high,
of old red brick, and the street floor was occupied by shops and
a restaurant. To the right was a building of six storeys, which
was known as "the new annex." This building, more simple in
design than the others, was constructed of basal stone of the
rough, porous, light-hued kind which was predominant in many of
the new architectures throughout the nation. The building, neat,
compact, and for the most part unadorned by useless ornament,
somehow gave the effect of having been stamped out, with a
million others of its kind, by a gigantic biscuit-cutter of such
buildings--and hence to speak, how or in what way it was hard to
say, yet instantly apparent, the mechanic spirit of a "newer" or
more "modern" scheme--the scheme of "the 'twenties," of 1922 or
1924.</p>

<p>It was hard to know why one found fault with the building, but
somehow it left one without joy. In many obvious ways this would
be apparent at once, not only to the architect, but to the
layman--it was superior to its companion structures. Although not
a building which combined simple grace with use--as the old
colonial structures of New England do--it was at least a building
lacking in the clumsy and meaningless adornment which disfigured
the surface of its two companions. Moreover, the rough,
porous-looking brick had a look of lean and homely integrity: it
was hard to know why one disliked the building, and yet one
did--the other two, with all their confusing and unreasoning
decoration, were the warmer, better, and more cheerful
places.</p>

<p>What was it? It was almost impossible to define the quality of
"the new annex" or its depressing effect upon the spectator, yet
its quality was unmistakable. It belonged somehow to a new and
accursed substance which had come into the structure of life--a
substance barren, sterile, and inhuman--designed not for the use
of man, but for the blind proliferations of the man-swarm to
accommodate the greatest number in the smallest space--to
shelter, house, turn out, take in, all the nameless, faceless,
mindless man-swarm atoms of the earth.</p>

<p>The transient population of the Leopold, comparatively, was
small. The great tidal fluctuation of brief visitors--business
men, salesmen, newly wedded couples on their honeymoons, people
from small towns out for a spree or a week or two of bright-light
gaiety--which swarmed in unceasing movements in and out of the
city, had scarcely touched the life of the Leopold. The hotel,
set in a quarter of the city that was a little remote from the
great business and pleasure districts, depended largely for its
custom on the patronage of a "permanent" clientele. It was, in
short, the kind of place often referred to as "a quiet family
hotel"--a phrase which the management of the Leopold made use of
in advertising the merits of their establishment, on the hotel
stationery.</p>

<p>But that phrase, with its soothing connotations of a tranquil,
felicitous and gentle domesticity, was misleading. For the
Leopold was decidedly not "quiet" and although it contained
within its cell-like rooms almost every other kind of life, of
"family life" there was almost none and what there was, so
desolate and barren, that one felt himself to be looking at the
museum relics of what had once been a family rather than at the
living and organic reality. And because of this, one felt
constantly about the Leopold the spirit of defeat--either of
lives still searching, restless and unfound, or of lives which,
in the worst sense of the word, had fallen upon evil days.</p>

<p>And curiously, in spite of the hotel's pious assurance of its
"quiet family life," its boast of permanency, there hovered about
the place continually, indefinably but certainly, a feeling of
naked insecurity, a terrifying transiency--not the frank
transiency of the great tourist hotels with their constant daily
flux of changing faces--but the horrible transiency of lives held
here for a period in the illusion of a brief and barren
permanence, of lives either on the wing or on the wane.</p>

<p>Here, for example, among the three or four hundred beings who
inhabited the motley structure of these conjoined walls, were a
number of young people who had only recently come from smaller
places and were still stunned and bewildered by the terrific
impact of the city upon their lives, or who, after a year or two
of such bewilderment, were just beginning to orient themselves,
to adjust their lives to the city's furious tempo, and to look
around with a bolder and more knowing calculation for some kind
of residence a little closer to their true desires.</p>

<p>To young people of this sort the Leopold had offered, when
they first came to the city, its spurious promise of warm asylum.
Many of them had landed here--or rather popped in here like
frightened rabbits--after their first terrified immersion in the
man-swarm fury of the city's life, and the feeling of desolation,
houseless naked loneliness, bewilderment, and scrambling,
scuttling terror which the sudden impact of that ruthless, sudden
revelation had aroused in them.</p>

<p>For this reason, those barren walls, those terrible, hive-like
cells of the Hotel Leopold were not without a glory of their own.
For in those cell-like rooms there could be held all of the hope,
hunger, passion, bitter loneliness and earth-devouring fury that
a room could hold, or that this world can know, or that this
little racked and riven vessel of desire, this twisted tenement
of man's bitter brevity, can endure.</p>

<p>Here, in these desolate walls, on many a night long past and
desperately accomplished, many a young man had paced the confines
of his little cell like a maddened animal, had beat his knuckles
bloody on the stamped-out walls, had lashed about him, a creature
baffled and infuriated by the million illusions of warmth, love,
security and joy which the terrific city offered him and which,
tantalus-like, slipped from his fingers like a fume of painted
smoke the instant that he tried to get his grasp upon it.</p>

<p>Again, if the Hotel Leopold had housed all of the hope, joy,
fury, passion, anguish, and devouring hunger that the earth can
know, and that the wild and bitter tenement of youth can hold, it
also housed within its walls all of the barren and hopeless
bitterness of a desolate old age. For here--unloved, friendless,
and unwanted, shunted off into the dreary asylum of hotel
life--there lived many old people who hated life, and yet who
were afraid to die.</p>

<p>Most of them were old people with a pension, or a small
income, which was just meagrely sufficient to their slender
needs. Some of them, widowed, withered, childless, and alone,
were drearily wearing out the end of their lives here in a barren
solitude. Some had sons and daughters, married, living in the
city, who came dutifully to stamp the dreary tedium of waning
Sunday afternoons with the stale counterfeits of filial
devotion.</p>

<p>The rest of the time the old people stayed in their rooms and
washed their stockings out and did embroidery, or descended to
the little restaurant to eat, or sat together in one corner of
the white-tiled lobby and talked.</p>

<p>Why could they never make it come to life? Why was no great
vine growing from the hearts of all these old and dying people?
Why were their flesh, their sagging, pouch-like jowls and faces
so dry, dead, and juiceless, their weary old eyes so dull and
lustreless, their tones so nasal, tedious and metallic? Why was
it that they seemed never to have known any of the pain, joy,
passion, evil, glory of a dark and living past? Why was it that
their lives, on which now the strange dark radiance of
million-visaged time was shining, seemed to have gained neither
wisdom, mystery nor passion from the great accumulation of the
buried past--to have been composed, in fact, of an infinite
procession of dreary moments and little mean adventures, each
forgotten, lost, and buried, as day by day the grey sand of their
lives ran out its numberless grains of barren tedium.</p>

<p>This, indeed, seemed to be the truth about them: as they sat
together in one corner of the lobby talking, all their
conversation seemed made up of dreary dialogues such as
these:</p>

<p>"How do you do, Mrs. Grey? I didn't see you in the restaurant
tonight."</p>

<p>"No--" the old woman spoke triumphantly, proudly conscious of
a sensational adventure--"I ate out tonight at a new place that
my son-in-law told me about!--Oh! I had the most
<i>dee-</i>licious meal--a <i>won</i>-derful meal--all anyone
could eat and only sixty cents. First I had a dish of nice fruit
salad--and then I had a bowl of soup--oh-h! <i>dee-</i>licious
soup, Mrs. Martin--it was vegetable soup, but oh-h!
<i>dee</i>-licious!--a whole meal in itself--and then--" with a
ruminant satisfaction she continued her arid catalogue--"I had
some nice lamb chops, and some <i>dee-</i>licious green peas--and
a nice baked potato--and some salad--and some rolls and
butter--and then I had a nice cup of coffee--and a piece of
apple-pie--oh-h! the apple-pie was simply <i>dee</i>-licious,
Mrs. Martin, I had--"</p>

<p>"I'd think you'd be getting hungry by that time," said another
of the group, an old man, who was their humorist, with a wink
around him at the others. They all laughed appreciatively, and he
continued: "You're sure you didn't miss anything as you went
along--" he winked again and they all laughed dryly, with
appreciation.</p>

<p>"No, sir!"--firmly, positively, with an emphatic nod of the
head--"I ate every bite of it, Doctor Withers--oh-h, it was so
<i>dee</i>-licious, I just couldn't bear to see <i>anything</i>
go to waste--only," regretfully, "I did have to leave my
apple-pie--I couldn't finish it--"</p>

<p>"What!" the humorist exclaimed in mock astonishment. "You mean
you left something behind! Why, you hardly ate enough to feed an
elephant! You'll be getting all run down if you starve yourself
this way!"--and the jester winked again, and the old women of his
audience cackled aridly with appreciative laughter.</p>

<p>"--Well, I know," the glutton said regretfully, "I just hated
to see that good apple-pie go to waste--oh-h! I wish you could
have tasted it, Mrs. Martin,--it was simply
<i>dee</i>-licious--'What's the matter?' the girl says to me--the
waitress, you know--'Don't you like your pie?--I'll go get you
something else if you don't like it.'--Oh! yes--" with sudden
recollection--"oh, yes! she says to me, 'How'd you like some ice
cream?--You can have ice cream instead of pie,' she says, 'if
you'd rather have it'--'Oh-h!' I said,"--spoken with a kind of
gasp, the withered old hand upon the meagre stomach--"'Oh-h!' I
says, 'I couldn't!'--She had to laugh, you know, I guess the way
I said it. 'Well, you got enough?' she said. 'Oh-h!' I
said,"--again the faint protesting gasp, "'if I ate another
mouthful, I'd pop open! Oh-h!"--Well, it made her laugh, you
know, the way I said it--'I'd <i>pop</i> open!' I said, 'I
<i>couldn't</i> eat another mouthful!'--'Well, just so long as
you got enough!' she says. 'We like to see everyone get enough.
We want you to be satisfied,' she said. 'Oh-h!' I said," the
faint protesting gasp again, "'not another <i>mouthful,</i> my
dear! I <i>couldn't</i>!<i>'</i>--But, oh-h! Mrs. Martin, if you
could have seen that apple-pie! It was <i>dee</i>-licious! I was
sorry to see it go to waste!"</p>

<p>"Well," said Mrs. Martin, rather tartly, obviously a little
envious of the other's rich adventure--"we had a good meal here
at the hotel, too. We had some celery and olives to start off
with and then we had some good pea soup and after that we had
roast beef and mashed potatoes--wasn't the roast beef we had
tonight delicious, Doctor Withers?" she demanded of this arbiter
of taste.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, smacking his dry lips together drolly, "the
only complaint I had to make was that they didn't bring me the
whole cow. I had to ask George for a second helping. . . . Yes,
sir, if I never fare any worse than that I'll have no kick--it
was a very good piece of beef--well-cooked, tender, very tasty,"
he said with a dry, scientific precision, and again he smacked
his leathery lips together with an air of relish.</p>

<p>"--Well, I thought so, too," said Mrs. Martin, nodding her
head with satisfaction at this sign of his agreement "--I thought
it was delicious--and then," she went on reflectively, "we had a
nice lettuce and tomato salad, some biscuit tortoni and, of
course," she concluded elegantly, "the demy-tassy."</p>

<p>"Well, I didn't have any of the demy-tassy," said Doctor
Withers, the droll wit. "None of your demy-tassy for me! No, sir!
I had <i>coffee</i>--two big cups of it, too," he went on with
satisfaction. "If I'm going to poison myself I'm going to do a
good job of it--none of your little demy-tassys for me!"</p>

<p>And the old women cackled aridly their dry appreciation of his
wit.</p>

<p>"--Good evening, Mrs. Buckles," Doctor Withers continued,
getting up and bowing gallantly to a heavily built,
arthritic-looking old woman who now approached the group with a
stiff and gouty movement. "We missed you tonight. Did you eat in
the restaurant?"</p>

<p>"No," she panted in a wheezing tone, as, with a painful grunt,
she lowered her heavily corseted bulk into the chair he offered
her. "I didn't go down--I didn't have much appetite and I didn't
want to risk it. I had them bring me something in my room--some
tea and toast and a little marmalade . . . I didn't intend to
come down at all," she went on in a discontented tone, "but I got
tired of staying up there all alone and I thought I'd just as
well--I'd be just as well off down here as I'd be up in my room,"
she concluded morosely.</p>

<p>"And how <i>is</i> your cold today, Mrs. Buckles?" one of the
old women now asked with a kind of lifeless sympathy. "--Do you
feel better?"</p>

<p>"--Oh," the old woman said morosely, uncertainly, "I suppose
so. . . . I think so. . . . Yes, I think it's a little better. .
. . Last night I was afraid it was getting down into my chest,
but today it feels better--seems to be more in my head and
throat--But I don't know," she muttered in a sullen and
embittered tone, "it's that room they've given me. I'll always
have it as long as I've got to live there in that room. I'll
never get any better till I get my old room back."</p>

<p>"Did you do what I told you to do?" asked Doctor Withers. "Did
you go and dose yourself the way I told you?"</p>

<p>"--No--well," she said indefinitely, "I've been drinking lots
of water and trying a remedy a friend of mine down at the Hotel
Gridly told me about--it's a new thing called Inhalo; all you got
to do is put it up your nose and breathe it in--she said it did
her more good than anything she'd ever tried."</p>

<p>"I never heard of it," said Doctor Withers sourly. "Whatever
it is, it won't cure your cold. No, sir!" He shook his head
grimly. "Now, I didn't practise medicine for forty years without
finding out <i>something</i> about colds! Now, I don't care
anything about your Inhalos or Breathos or Spray-Your-Throatos,
or whatever they may call 'em--any of these newfangled remedies.
The only way to get rid of a cold is to have a thorough
cleaning-out, and the only way to get a thorough cleaning-out is
to dose yourself with castor oil, the way I told you to.--Now you
can do as you please," he said sourly, with a constricted
pressure of his thin convex mouth, "it's no business of mine what
you do--if you want to run the risk of coming down with pneumonia
it's your own affair--but if you want to get over that cold
you'll take my advice."</p>

<p>"Well," the old woman muttered in her tone of sullen
discontent. "--It's that room I'm in. That's the trouble. I've
hated that room ever since they put me in there. I know if I
could get my old room back I'd be all right again."</p>

<p>"Then why don't you ask Mr. Betts to give it back to you?"
said Mrs. Martin. "I'm sure if you went to him and told him that
you wanted it, he'd let you have it."</p>

<p>"No, he wouldn't!" said Mrs. Buckles bitterly. "I've been to
him--I've asked him. He paid no attention to me--tried to tell me
I was better off where I was, that it was a better room, a better
bargain!--Here I've been living at this place for eight years
now, but do you think they show me any consideration? No," she
cried bitterly, "they're all alike nowadays--out for everything
they can get--it's grab, grab, grab--and they don't care who you
are or how long they've known you--if they can get five cents
more from someone else, why, out you go! . . . When I came back
here from Florida last spring I found my old room taken. . . . I
went to Mr. Betts a dozen times and asked to have it back and he
always put me off--told me there were some people in there who
were leaving soon and I could have it just as soon as they moved
out. . . . That was all a put-up job," she said resentfully. "He
didn't mean a word of it. I see now that he never had any
intention of giving me my old room. . . . No! They've just found
that they can get a dollar or two more a week for it from these
fly-by-nights than I could afford to pay--and so, of course, I'm
the one that gets turned out!" she said. "That's the way it goes
nowadays!"</p>

<p>"Well," said Mrs. Martin a trifle acidly, "I'm sure if you
went to Mr. Betts in the right way you could get your old room
back. He's always done everything I ever asked him to do for
<i>me.</i> But, of course," she said pointedly, "you've got to
approach him in the right way."</p>

<p>"Oh-h!" said old Mrs. Grey rapturously, "I think Mr. Betts is
the <i>nicest</i> manager they've ever had here--so pleasant, so
good-<i>natured!</i> so <i>willing</i> to oblige! Now that other
man they had here before he came--what was his name?" she said
impatiently. "--Mason, or Watson, or Clarkson--something like
that--"</p>

<p>"Wilson," said Doctor Withers.</p>

<p>"--Oh, yes--Wilson!" said Mrs. Grey. "That's it--Wilson! I
never liked him at <i>all,"</i> she said with an accent of
scornful depreciation. "You could <i>never</i> get anything out
of Wilson. He never did anything you wanted him to do. But Mr.
<i>Betts!</i>--oh-h! I think Mr. Betts is a lovely manager!"</p>

<p>"Well, I haven't found him so," said Mrs. Buckles grimly. "I
liked Wilson better."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't agree with you, Mrs. Buckles," Mrs. Grey said
with a stony and somewhat hostile emphasis. "I don't
ag<i>-gree</i> with you at <i>all!</i> I think there's no
<i>comparison!</i> I like Mr. Betts <i>so</i> much better than I
like Wilson!"</p>

<p>"Well, I like Wilson better," said Mrs. Buckles grimly, and
for a moment the two old women glared at each other with bitter
hostile eyes.</p>

<p>"--Well," Doctor Withers broke the silence quickly in a
diplomatic effort to avert an impending clash, "--what are your
plans for the winter, Mrs. Buckles? What have you decided to do?
Are you going to Florida again this winter?"</p>

<p>"I don't know what I'll do," old Mrs. Buckles answered in a
tone of sullen dejection. "I haven't decided yet. . . . I had
planned to go down to Daytona Beach with Mrs. Wheelwright--that's
my friend at the Hotel Gridly--she had a daughter living in
Daytona and we had planned to spend the winter there in order to
be near them. But now that's all fallen through," she said
dejectedly. "Here, at the last moment, when all my plans were
made, she decided not to go--says she likes it at the Gridly and
it will be cheaper to stay on there than to make a trip to
Florida and back. . . . That's the trouble with people nowadays,"
she said bitterly, "you can't depend on them. They never mean
anything they say!" And she lapsed again into a sullen and
dejected silence.</p>

<p>"Why aren't you going to St. Petersburg?" said Mrs. Martin
curiously after a brief pause. "I thought that's where you always
spent the winter."</p>

<p>"It was," said Mrs. Buckles, "until last winter. But I'll
never go back there again. It's not the same place any more. I've
been going to the same hotel down there for more than twenty
years--it used to be a lovely place; when I went back there last
winter I found the whole place changed. They had ruined it," she
bitterly concluded.</p>

<p>"How was that?" said Doctor Withers curiously. "What had they
done to it?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Buckles looked around cautiously and craftily to make
sure that in this sinister melting-pot of a million listening
ears, she would not be overheard, and then, bending forward
painfully, with one old arthritic hand held up beside her mouth,
she muttered confidingly to her listeners:</p>

<p>"--I'll tell you what it is. It's the <i>Jews!</i> They get in
everywhere," she whispered ominously. "They ruin
<i>everything!</i> When I got down there last winter the whole
place was overrun with Jews! They had ruined the place!" she
hissed. "The place was <i>ruined!"</i></p>

<p>At this moment another old woman joined the group. She
advanced slowly, leaning on a cane, smiling, and with a movement
of spacious benevolence. Everything about this old woman--her big
frame, slow movement, broad and tranquil brow, silvery hair
parted in the middle, and her sonorous and measured speech, which
came deliberately from her mouth in the periods of a cadenced
rhetoric--had an imposing and majestic quality. As she
approached, everyone greeted her eagerly and with obvious
respect, Doctor Withers got up quickly and bent before her with
almost obsequious courtesy, she was herself addressed by everyone
as "Doctor," and her position among them seemed to be one of
secure and tranquil authority.</p>

<p>This old woman was known to everyone in the hotel as Doctor
Thornton. She had been one of the first women physicians in the
country and a few years before, after a long and, presumably,
successful practice, she had retired to spend the remaining years
of her life in the peaceful haven of the Leopold, and to bestow
on man, God, nature and the whole universe around her the
cadenced and benevolent reflections of her measured rhetoric. She
became, by virtue of this tranquil and majestic authority that
emanated from her, the centre of every group, young and old, that
she approached. She was known to everyone in the hotel, everyone
referred to her as "a wonderful old woman," spoke of her
brilliant mind, her ripe philosophy, and her "beautiful
English."</p>

<p>The respect and veneration in which she was held were now
instantly apparent as, with a benevolent smile, she slowly
approached this company of old people. They greeted her with an
eager and excited scraping of chairs, the welcoming tumult of
several old voices, speaking eagerly at once: Doctor Withers
himself scrambled to his feet, pushed a large chair into the
circle and stood by gallantly as, with a slow and stately
movement, she settled her large figure into it, and for a moment
looked about her over the top of her cane with a tranquil,
smiling and benevolent expression.</p>

<p><i>"Well,</i> Doctor!" said Mrs. Grey, almost breathlessly.
"Where have you been keeping yourself all day long? We've
<i>missed</i> you."</p>

<p>The others murmured agreement to this utterance, and then
leaned forward with eager attentiveness so as not to miss any of
the gems of wisdom which would fall from this great woman's
lips.</p>

<p>For a moment Doctor Thornton regarded her interlocutor with an
expression of tolerant and almost playful benevolence. Presently
she spoke:</p>

<p>"What have I been doing all day long?" she repeated in a tone
of sonorous deliberation. "Why, my dear, I have been
<i>reading</i>--reading," she pursued with rhythmical sonority,
"in one of my favourite and most cherished volumes."</p>

<p>And instantly there was for all her listeners a sense of some
transforming radiance in the universe: an event of universal
moment: the Doctor had been reading all day long. They looked at
her with an awed stare.</p>

<p>"What," Mrs. Martin nervously began, with a little giggle,
"--what was it you were reading, Doctor? It must have been a good
book to hold your interest all day long?"</p>

<p>"It was, my dear," said Doctor Thornton sonorously and
deliberately. "It <i>was</i> a good book. More than that, it was
a <i>great</i> book--a magnificent work of genius to show us to
what heights the mind of man may soar when he is inspired by
lofty and ennobling sentiments."</p>

<p>"What was this, Doctor Thornton?" Doctor Withers now inquired.
"--Something of Tennyson's?"</p>

<p>"No, Doctor Withers," Doctor Thornton answered sonorously, "it
was not Tennyson--much as I admire the noble beauty of his
poetry. I was not reading poetry, Doctor Withers," she continued,
"I was reading--<i>prose,"</i> she said. "I was
reading--<i>Ruskin!"</i> As these momentous words fell from her
lips her voice lowered with such an air of portentous
significance that the last word was not so much spoken as
breathed forth like an incense of devotion. <i>"Ruskin!"</i> she
whispered solemnly again.</p>

<p>And although it is doubtful if this name conveyed any definite
meaning to her audience, its magical effect upon them was evident
from the looks of solemn awe with which they now regarded
her.</p>

<p>"--<i>Ruskin!"</i> she said again, this time strongly, in an
accent of rapturous sonority. "The noble elevation of his
thought, the beautiful proportion and the ordered harmony of all
the parts, the rich yet simple style, and, above all, the sane
and wholesome beauty of his philosophy of art--what nobler
monument to man's higher genius was ever built, my friends, than
he proportioned in <i>The Stones of Venice</i>--itself a work of
art entirely worthy of the majestic sculptures that it
consecrates?"</p>

<p>For a moment after the sonorous periods of that swelling
rhetoric had ceased, the old people stared at her with a kind of
paralysis of reverent wonder. Then old Mrs. Grey, gasping with a
kind of awed astonishment, said:</p>

<p>"Oh-h, Doctor Thornton, I think it's the most <i>wonderful</i>
thing the way you keep your mind occupied all the time with all
these deep and beautiful thoughts you have! I don't see how you
do it! I should think you'd get yourself all tired out just by
the <i>thinking</i> that you do."</p>

<p>"Tired, my dear?" said Doctor Thornton sonorously, bestowing
upon her worshipper a smile of tolerant benevolence. "How can
anyone grow tired who <i>lives</i> and <i>moves</i> and
<i>breathes</i> in this great world of ours? No, no, my dear, do
not say <i>tired.</i> Rather say <i>refreshed, rejuvenated,</i>
and <i>inspired</i> by the glorious pageant that life offers us
in its unending beauty and profusion. Wherever I look," she
continued, looking, "I see nothing but order and harmony in the
universe. I lift my eyes unto the stars." she said majestically,
at the same time lifting her face in a movement of rapturous
contemplation toward the ceiling of the hotel lobby, "and feast
my soul upon the infinite beauties of God's heaven, the glorious
proportion of the sidereal universe. I turn my gaze around me,
and everywhere I look I see the noble works that man has
fashioned, the unceasing progress he has made in his march upward
from the brute, the noble aspiration of his spirit, the eternal
labour of his mighty intellect towards a higher purpose, the
radiant beauty of his countenance in which all the highest
ardours of his soul may be discerned!"</p>

<p>And as she pronounced this sonorous eulogy her glance rested
benevolently on old Doctor Withers' soured and wizened features.
He lowered his head coyly, as becomes a modest man, and in a
moment the rhapsodist continued:</p>

<p>"'What a piece of work is man! How noble in reason! How
infinite in faculty! In form, in moving, how express and
admirable! In action, how like an angel! In apprehension, how
like a God!'"</p>

<p>And having sonorously pronounced Hamlet's mighty judgment, the
wonderful old woman, who had herself for thirty years been one of
the most prosperous abortionists in the nation, looked
benevolently about her at all the specimens of God's choice
article who were assembled in the lobby.</p>

<p>Over behind the cigar counter the vendor, a fat Czechish youth
with a pale flabby face and dull taffy-coloured hair, was
industriously engaged in picking his fat nose with a greasy thumb
and forefinger. Elsewhere, in another corner of the lobby, three
permanent denizens of the Leopold, familiarly and privately known
to members of the hotel staff as Crab-face Willy, Maggie the
Dope, and Greasy Gertie, were sitting where they always sat, in
an unspeaking and unsmiling silence.</p>

<p>And at this moment two more wonder-works of God came in from
the street and walked rapidly across the lobby, speaking the
golden and poetic language which their Maker had so marvellously
bestowed on them.</p>

<p>"Cheezus!" said one of them, a large man with a grey hat and a
huge, dead, massive face of tallowy grey which receded in an
indecipherable manner into the sagging flesh-folds of his flabby
neck--"Cheezus!" he eloquently continued with a protesting laugh
that emerged from his tallowy lips in a hoarse expletive mixed
with spittle--"Yuh may be right about him, Eddie, but
Cheezus!"--again the hoarse protesting laugh. "Duh guy may be all
right, but Cheezus!--I don't know! If he'd come in dere like duh
rest of dem an' let me know about it--but Cheezus!--duh guy may
be all right like you say!--but Cheezus! Eddie, I don't
know!"</p>

<p>Doctor Thornton bestowed on them the benevolent approval of
her glance as they went by and then, turning to her awed
listeners again, declared sonorously with a majestic and
expressive gesture of her hand:</p>

<p>"Tired? How could one ever grow tired, my friends, in this
great world of ours?"</p>

<p> </p>

<h1>XLIX</h1>

<p> </p>

<p>At the end of his classes, the final end, when all had spoken,
when that hot wave of life and turbulence had withdrawn, the last
clattering footfalls had echoed away along the corridors, the
last loud aggressive voices had faded into silence, leaving, it
seemed, an odour of exhaustion, use, and weariness even in the
walls, boards and benches of the room, so that the empty
class-room had a tired but living presence of fatigue, the
indefinable but sharply felt character of a room with people
absent from it, and seemed somehow to relax, settle, and respire
with relief and weariness--at this final, fagged, and burned-out
candle-end of day, Abraham Jones, as relentless as destiny, would
be there waiting for Eugene. He waited there, grim, grey,
unsmiling, tortured-looking behind an ominous wink of glasses, a
picture of Yiddish melancholy and discontent, and as Eugene
looked at him his heart went numb and dead; he hated the sight of
him. He sat there now in the front rows of the class like a
nemesis of scorn, a merciless censor of Eugene's ignorance and
incompetence: the sight of his dreary discontented face, with its
vast grey acreage of a painful Jewish and involuted
intellectualism, was enough, even at the crest of a passionate
burst of inspiration, to curdle his blood, freeze his heart, stun
and deaden the fiery particle of his brain, and thicken his
tongue to a faltering, incoherent mumble. Eugene did not know
what Abe wanted, what he expected, what kind of teaching he
thought worthy of him: he only knew that nothing he did suited
him, that the story of his inadequacy and incompetence was
legible in every line of that grey, dreary, censorious face. He
thought of it at night with a kind of horror: the ghoulish head
which craned out of a vulture's body swept after him through all
the fields of a distressful sleep, a taloned fury filled with
croakings of hoarse doom. Never before had Eugene been driven
through desperation to such exhausting intensities of work: night
by night he sweated blood over great stacks and sheaves of their
dull, careless, trivial papers--he read, re-read, and triple-read
them, putting in all commas, colons, periods, correcting all
faults of spelling, grammar, punctuation that he knew, writing
long, laborious comments and criticisms on the back and rising
suddenly out of a haunted tortured sleep to change a grade. And
at the end, the inexorable end, he was always faced with the
menace of Abe's weekly paper; with dread and quaking he tackled
it. He wrote the best papers that Eugene got: the grammar was
flawless, the spelling impeccable, the vocabulary precise and
extensive, the sentences cleanly and forcibly shaped. The thought
was sound, subtle, and coherent--by every standard the work was
of an extraordinary grade and quality, its merit was
unmistakable, and yet Eugene approached a four-page paper with
fear and trembling; before he had gone beyond the first paragraph
great sobs and groans of weariness and despair were wrung from
him; he stamped across the floor with it like a man maddened by
an aching tooth; he began again, he flung himself upon the bed,
got up and walked again, doused his head in basins of cold
water--but it was no use: to read the paper to the end, as he did
and must, was weariness and travail of the spirit--it was like
eating chalk or trying to suck sweetness out of paving brick, or
being drowned in an ocean of dish-water, or forced to gorge
oneself on boiled unseasoned spinach. Abe wrote on a great range
and variety of subjects and everything he wrote was good: he
wrote about the plays of Pirandello, of "Six Characters in Search
of an Author," and of "three planes of reality" therein: he
estimated and analysed those three planes with the power of a
philosopher, the delicacy of a subtle-souled psychologist, and
all of this to Eugene was as weeping and wailing and gnashing of
teeth, because it was so good, and he did not know what was
wrong, and he could not endure to read it. He could not write
upon his papers that he found them intolerably dull unless he
knew wherein the reason for that dullness lay, and he did not
know the reason: accordingly the highest grade he ever gave to
anyone--the grade of "A"--was week by week wrung from trembling
and reluctant fingers. But no matter what the grade was, or how
flattering the comment, Abe protested. Grey, dreary, tortured,
discontented, Yiddish, he would be waiting for Eugene at the end
of every class, clutching his paper in his impatient fingers,
armed and eager for the combat of dispute that was to follow.</p>

<p>The class met at night and they would walk rapidly away
together along the empty echoing corridors, and, turning, clatter
down the stairs that led to the main entrance. The vast building
was deserted and full of weary echoes: they could hear the
solitary clang of an elevator door and the dynamic hum of its
machinery as it mounted. Someone was walking in the big corridor
downstairs: they heard the echoing ring of his footsteps on the
slick marble flags, and the noisy rattle of a cleaner's bucket on
the floor. The whole building was charged with a weary electric
quality--with the quality of a light which has gone dim. And the
taste and the smell of this weariness were in Eugene's mouth and
nostrils; it was as if he had stuck his tongue against a warm but
burned-out storage battery; it was like the smell that comes from
the wheels of a street car when they have ground around a curve,
or like the odour from a smoking hot-box on the fast express. His
body also had this feeling of electric weariness, as if the vital
currents were exhausted: his flesh felt dry and juiceless, his
back was tired, his loins were sterile, the acrid burned-out
flavour filled him.</p>

<p>The big ugly building breathed slowly with the fatigue of
inanimate objects which have been overcharged with human energy:
it was haunted with its tired emptiness, with the absence of the
thousands of people who had swarmed through its every part that
day with such a clamorous, hot and noisy life. The lifeless air
in its passages had been breathed and rebreathed again and again:
the walls, the furniture, the floors--every part of the
building--seemed to exude this sense of nervous depletion.</p>

<p>As he hurried down the stairs on such an evening with his
unshakable companion, his implacable disputant, he hated the
building more than he had ever hated any building before: it
seemed to be soaked in all the memories of fruitless labour and
harsh strife, of fear and hate and weariness, of ragged nerves
and pounding heart and tired flesh: the building brooded there,
charged with its dreadful burden of human pain, encumbered with
its grief; and his hatred for the building was the hatred of a
man for the place where he has met some terrible humiliation of
the flesh or spirit, or for the room in which a man has seen his
brother die, or for the dwelling from which love and the beloved
have departed. The ghosts of pain and darkness sat in the empty
chairs, the spirits of venom and sterility brooded over the
desks: dry hatred and the poison of the brain were seated in the
chairs of the instructors; fear trembled in their seats, it made
a hateful cold around the heart, it made the bowels queasy, it
made swallowing hard, it slithered at the edges of the desk, it
fell and crawled and wobbled like a boneless thing. And the
grey-faced Jew beside Eugene made the weary lights burn dim: he
gave a tongue to weariness, a colour to despair.</p>

<p>They hurried down the steps and left the building almost as if
they were in flight. The heavy door clanged to behind them making
echoes in the halls, they reached the pavement of the Square, and
immediately they halted. Here they were in another world, and
their weary bodies drank in a new vitality. Sometimes, on a cold
still night in winter, the sky had the peculiarly frosty clarity
that comes from a still, biting cold. Above the great vertical
radiance and cold Northern passion of New York, it was a-glitter
with magnificent stars, it was a-glitter with small pollens, with
a jewelled dust of stars that seemed to have been sown drunkenly
through heaven, and as Eugene looked his weariness was cleansed
out of him at once, he was filled with an overwhelming desire to
possess beauty and all things else, and to include all things in
him. He would learn to be all things: he would be an artist and
he would find a way of living in the maelstrom. The darkness
filled him with a sense of power and possession: his spirit
soared out over the city, and over the earth, he was no longer
afraid of the grey-faced Jew beside him, peace and power and
certitude possessed him. He drank the air into his veins in great
gulps, he saw the huge walled cliff of the city ablaze with its
jewellery of hard sown lights, he knew he could possess it all,
and a feeling of joy and victory rushed through his senses.</p>

<p>Under the furious goad of desperation, a fear of failure and
disgrace, a sense of loneliness and desolation, and a grim
determination to go down into the dust of ruin only when he could
no longer lift a hand or draw a breath, he learned his job, and
found his life again, he did the labour of a titan, the flesh
wasted from his bones, he became a mad, driven zealot, but he was
a good teacher, and the day came when he knew he need no longer
draw his breath in fear or shame, that he had paid his way and
earned his wage and could meet them eye to eye. He took those
swarthy swarming classes and looted his life clean for them: he
bent over them, prayed, sweated, and exhorted like a prophet, a
poet, and a priest--he poured upon them the whole deposit of his
living, feeling, reading, the whole store of poetry, passion and
belief: he went into the brain of a dullard like a surgeon, and
he blew some spark of fire into a glow in even the least and
worst of them, but that grey-faced Yiddish inquisitor hung
doggedly to his heels; the more he gave, the more Abe wanted; he
fed on Eugene's life, enriching his greyness with an insatiate
and vampiric gluttony, and yet he never had a word of praise, a
sentence of thanks, a syllable of commendation.</p>

<p>Instead he became daily more open in his surly discontent, his
sour depreciation; his insolence, unchecked, grew by leaps and
bounds, he exulted in a feeling of cruel crowing Jewish mastery
over Eugene's bent aching spirit, he walked away with him day by
day and his conversation now was one long surly indictment of his
class, his teaching, and his competence. Why didn't Eugene give
them better topics for their themes? Why didn't they use another
volume of essays instead of the one they had, which was no good?
Why, in the list of poems, plays, biographies and novels which
Eugene had assigned, and which were no good, had he omitted the
names of Jewish writers such as Lewisohn and Sholem Asch? Why did
he not give each student private "conferences" more frequently,
although he had conferred with them until his brain and heart
were sick and weary? Why did they not write more expository,
fewer descriptive themes; more argument, less narration? Why, in
short, did he not do everything in a different way?--the
indictment, merciless, insistent, unrelenting, piled up day by
day and meanwhile resentment, anger, resolution began to blaze
and burn in Eugene, a conviction grew that this could no longer
be endured, that no life, no age, no position was worth this
thankless toil and trouble, and that he must make an end of a
situation which had become intolerable.</p>

<p>One night, when Abe had accompanied Eugene from the class to
the entrance of the hotel, and as he was in the full course and
tide of his surly complaint, Eugene stopped him suddenly and
curtly, saying: "You don't like my class, do you, Jones? You
don't think much of the way I teach, do you?"</p>

<p>Abe was surprised at the question, because his complaint had
always had a kind of sour impersonality: it had never wholly
dared a final accusatory directness.</p>

<p>"Well," he said in a moment, with a surly and unwilling tone,
"I never said that. I don't think we're getting as much out of
the class as we should. I think we could get a lot more out of it
than we're getting. That's all I said."</p>

<p>"And you have a few thousand suggestions to make that would
improve it? Is that it?"</p>

<p>"Well, I had to tell you how I felt about it," Abe said
doggedly. "If you don't like it, I'm sorry. You know we fellows
down there have got to pay tuition. And they charge you plenty
for it, too! . . . Don't let them kid you!" he said with a
derisive and scornful laugh. "That place is a goldmine for
someone! The trustees are getting rich on it!"</p>

<p>"Well, I'm not getting rich on it," Eugene said. "I get $150 a
month out of it. Apparently you think it's too much."</p>

<p>"Well, we've got a right to expect the best we can get," he
said. "That's what we're there for. That's what we're paying out
our dough for. You know, the fellows down there are not rich guys
like the fellows at Yale and Harvard. A dollar means something to
them. . . . We don't get everything handed to us on a silver
platter. Most of us have got to work for everything we get, and
if some guy who's teaching us is not giving us the best he's got
we got a right to kick about it. . . . That's the way I feel
about it."</p>

<p>"All right," Eugene said, "I know where you stand now. Now,
I'll tell you where I stand. I've been giving you the best I've
got, but you don't think it's good enough. Well, it's all I've
got and it's all you're going to get from me. Now, I tell you
what you're going to do, Jones. You're going out of my class. Do
you understand?" he shouted. "You're going now. I never want to
see you in my class again. I'll get you transferred, I'll have
you put in some other instructor's class, but you'll never come
into my room again."</p>

<p>"You can't do that," Abe said. "You've got no right to do
that. You've got no right to change a fellow to another class in
the middle of the term. I've done my work," he said resentfully;
"you're not going to change me. . . . I'll take it to the faculty
committee if you do."</p>

<p>Eugene could stand no more: in misery and despair he thought
of all he had endured because of Abe, and the whole choking wave
of resentment and fury which had been gathering in his heart for
months burst out upon him.</p>

<p>"Why, damn you!" he said. "Go to the faculty committee or any
other damned place you please, but you'll never come back to any
room where I'm teaching again. If they send you back, if they say
I've got to have you in my class, I quit. Do you hear me, Jones?"
he shouted. "I'll not have you! If they try to force me, I'm
through! To hell with such a life! I'll get down and clean out
sewers before I have you in my class again. . . . Now, you damned
rascal," his voice had grown so hoarse and thick he could hardly
speak, and the blind motes were swimming drunkenly before him. ".
. . I've had all I can stand from you. . . . Why, you damned dull
fellow. . . . Sitting there and sneering at me day after day with
your damned Jew's face. . . . What are you but a damned dull
fellow, anyway? . . . Why, damn you, Jones, you didn't deserve
anyone like me. . . . You should get down on your knees and thank
God you had a teacher half as good as me. . . . You . . . damned
. . . <i>fellow. . . .</i> You! . . . To think I sweat blood over
you! . . . Now, get away from here!" . . . he yelled. "To hell
with you! . . . I never want to see your face again!"</p>

<p>He turned and started toward the hotel entrance: he felt blind
and weak and dizzy, but he did not care what happened now: after
all these weeks of heavy misery a great wave of release and
freedom was coursing through his veins. Before he had gone three
steps Abe Jones was at his side, clutching at his sleeve,
beseeching, begging, pleading: "Say! . . . You've got the wrong
idea! Honest you have! . . . Say! I never knew you felt like
that! Don't send me out of there," he begged earnestly, and
suddenly Eugene saw that his shining glasses had grown misty and
that his dull weak eyes blinked with tears. "I don't want to
leave your class," he said. "Why, that's the best class that I've
got! . . . Honest it is! No kiddin'! . . . All the fellows feel
the same way about it."</p>

<p>He begged, beseeched, and almost wept: finally, when good will
had again been restored between them, he wrung Eugene's hand,
laughed painfully and shyly, and then took off his misted glasses
and began to shine and polish them with a handkerchief. His grey
ugly face as he stood there polishing his glasses had that
curiously naked, inept, faded and tired wistful look that is
common to people with weak eyes when they remove their
spectacles; it was a good and ugly face, and suddenly Eugene
began to like Abe very much. He left him and went up to his room
with a feeling of such relief, ease and happiness as he had not
known for months; and that night, unhaunted, unashamed, unpursued
by fears and furies and visions of his ruin and failure for the
first time in many months, he sank dreamlessly, sweetly,
deliriously, into the depths of a profound and soundless
sleep.</p>

<p>And from that moment, through every change of fortune, all
absence, all return, all wandering, and through the whole
progress of his city life, through every event of triumph, ruin,
or madness, this Jew, Abe Jones, the first man-swarm atom he had
come to know in all the desolation of the million-footed
city--had been his loyal friend.</p>

<p>It was not the golden city he had visioned as a child, and the
grey reptilian face of that beak-nosed Jew did not belong among
the company of the handsome, beautiful and fortunate people that
he had dreamed about, but Abe was made of better stuff than most
dreams are made of. His spirit was as steady as a rock, as
enduring as the earth, and like the flash of a light, the sight
of his good, grey ugly face could always evoke for Eugene the
whole wrought fabric of his life in the city, the whole design of
wandering and return, with a thousand memories of youth and
hunger, of loneliness, fear, despair, of glory, love, exultancy
and joy.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Robert Weaver appeared suddenly one night about seven o'clock
as Eugene was sitting in the lobby at the Leopold: he had not
seen Robert since their arrest. His visit to the hotel was the
result of a sudden impulse on Robert's part: immediately, without
greeting or any preliminary whatever, he began to ask all sorts
of questions about the Leopold--How long had Eugene been there?
Did he have a good room and how big was it? How well did he like
living at the hotel? Then insisted that Eugene show him his room.
Eugene got his key at the desk and took him up: at the sight of
the small room with its piles of books and stacks of student
themes Robert burst out laughing. Then he began to ask all manner
of questions in a serious and earnest tone--Where was the
bathroom?--Eugene showed him--Did they give him plenty of
towels?--Eugene told him--How much did he pay?--Eugene said the
rent was twelve dollars a week.</p>

<p>He received these answers with an air of astounded surprise,
his manner became even more earnest and excited, he began to say,
"You don't mean it!" "Well, I'll be damned!" "Well, what do you
know about that?"--as if the most astonishing revelations were
being made to him. Eugene looked at him with misgiving, because
he was obviously caught in the full surge of one of his impulses
and, sure enough, all at once he said with an air of complete
decision: "Damned if I don't do it! It's the very place I've been
looking for all along! Why, look at all you get for the money!
Damnedest bargain I ever heard of! I've just been throwing my
money away up there!"--he had been living at the Yale
Club--"Damned if I don't get me a room and move in right
away!"</p>

<p>This sudden prospect of having Robert as a neighbour did not
attract the other youth: he was working very hard with his
classes and trying to complete a play he had begun to write, and
he had no intention of becoming the companion or nurse of
Robert's drunkenness or the confessor of his fevered despair and
unrest: he told him he would not like the Leopold, that the
people were old and stodgy, and the rules of propriety very
strict. Further, he made the mistake of emphasizing the
difficulty of getting a room there, although there really was no
difficulty: he told him the place was a quiet family hotel, that
the management wanted regular tenants of quiet habits who
intended to live there permanently, that the preference was given
to middle-aged married couples, and that there were no vacancies,
anyway--that a long list of applicants were waiting to get in.
All this merely whetted Robert's eagerness: he now said that he
fulfilled all the requirements save marriage, and that this
deficiency would soon be remedied: he said he had completely
reformed his old habits of life, and that a quieter, steadier,
more sober and industrious man did not exist: he said he was
determined to live there, and he demanded that Eugene take him to
the manager and plead for him without delay.</p>

<p>When Eugene saw that he was really determined, he agreed: they
went downstairs to see the manager. He came out of his office
with the habitual defensive look of caution and suspicion on his
sour meagre face, and listened with his usual unwilling and
disparaging air, not facing them or directly looking at them, but
with his small parsley face averted and his eyes turned downward,
while Eugene praised Robert up to the skies, said he had known
him all his life, that he was the scion of an ancient and
distinguished family in the South, a brilliant young attorney in
a New York firm, and one of the steadiest and most proper youths
that ever lived. Robert also put in from time to time with his
deep voice and impressive manners, and at length Mr. Gibbs began
to shake his head dubiously, to say he didn't know, to tell how
difficult it was to get admitted to the Leopold--until Eugene
almost laughed in his face--but that in a case like this, because
it was Eugene and he knew if he recommended a man he must be all
right, and so on--he would see what he could do: he began to
thumb over the pages of a meaningless ledger, peering at it and
squinting along his parched finger as it moved across the page
and chattering and mumbling like a monkey: at length he
straightened with an air of decision, took four or five keys from
their boxes and gave them to the negro captain with instructions
"to show this gentleman these rooms." They all got into the
elevator and went upstairs again with Robert and the negro: they
looked at several rooms and at length, after great indecision,
appeals for advice and guidance, and innumerable questions,
Robert selected a room in the old annexe--a selection for which
the other youth was grateful, since his own room was in the new
one.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Robert moved in promptly the next day: they had dinner
together; he was in a state of jubilant elation. Then no more was
seen or heard of him for a week; when Eugene did get news of him
it was neither welcome nor reassuring. The phone in his room rang
one morning as he was dressing: a voice from the office asked him
curtly to see Mr. Gibbs when he came down. He went downstairs
with a sense of ominous misgiving: Mr. Gibbs came toward him with
a puckered and protesting face as if he had just tasted something
sour and unexpected; he began to speak at once in a tone of
shocked and astounded indignation: "In heaven's name!" he rasped;
"who is this man Weaver that you brought here? What kind of man
is here? <i>You</i> brought him here," he said accusingly.
<i>"You</i> recommended him. We thought he was all right. We took
<i>your</i> word for it? What's wrong with the man? Is he crazy?
Is he out of his head completely?"--his face was soured and
wrinkled like a persimmon, his small pinched figure trembled with
excitement and indignation, he looked at the boy with an
expression of horrified reproof--he was a comical sight, but the
boy was in no temper at the moment to appreciate the humour of
his appearance.</p>

<p>"What is it, Mr. Gibbs? What's the matter? What has he
done?"</p>

<p>"Why," he said, trembling with anger at the very thought of
it, "he tried to burn us all up last night. He came in here at
three o'clock in the morning, raving and carrying on like a crazy
man. Then he went upstairs and set his room on fire."</p>

<p>"On fire!"</p>

<p>"Why, yes!" said Gibbs. "We had to call the fire brigade to
put it out. Why, it's a wonder any of us are left alive--all of
these people sleeping in the hotel and this crazy man yelling and
screaming at five o'clock this morning that the place is on fire!
Why, we can't have anything like that in this hotel," he said
with the air of one who describes the desecration of a temple.
"We can't have a man like that here. Why, he'll drive the other
people out, we'll lose all our guests: people aren't going to
stay in a place with a crazy man. There's no telling what a man
like that is liable to do. Now!" he said with an air of abrupt
and pugnacious decision, "he's got to get out: I won't have him
here! I'm not going to have a man like that in my hotel a moment
longer"--his small jaw hardened meanly, his face shrank, and his
eyes narrowed, as he turned away, "and someone's got to pay for
all the damage that was done! Now, I don't care who pays it"--his
face was averted--"but it's not going to be us! Now you can tell
him," he snapped curtly, and he left.</p>

<p>Eugene went upstairs at once to Robert's room in a state of
choking anger and resentment: he felt that Robert had tricked him
and taken advantage of him, that he was being held accountable
for Robert's misbehaviour, and that now his own standing in the
hotel had been jeopardized and he would be forced to leave this
delightful and charming establishment at which he had cursed and
mocked so bitterly many times, but which now, in his resentful
spirit, took on a peaceful and home-like glamour it had never had
before. He walked into Robert's room without knocking: the room
was a wreck, a negro maid was mournfully and sullenly gathering
up from the floor the charred and blackened remnants of a pile of
bed-linen and blankets; the mirror had been smashed by a
drinking-glass which Robert had hurled at it, he said, when he
saw his image reflected in it, the remnants of a chair lay on the
floor, the heavy glass plate upon a writing table had been
broken, there was a large brownish stain upon one of the walls
where he had hurled a whisky bottle, and one end of his bed lay
tilted on the floor where he had stamped or kicked the slats and
boards to splinters. Robert was standing in the midst of all the
ruin he had made, with a nervous and rueful expression on his
face: when his friend came in he looked at him uneasily and
laughed in a feeble and foolish manner, without conviction.</p>

<p>"Now, damn it, don't stand there laughing about it, Robert,"
the other said. "You may think it's funny as hell, but it's no
joke for me. Of course," he went on bitterly, "I'm the goat. I'm
the one who's got to suffer for it. I'm the one they hold
responsible. Now you've just fixed it so that I can't stay here
in the hotel any longer: they're going to put me out!"</p>

<p>"You!" Robert said, in a protesting tone. "Why, it's not your
fault. You didn't have anything to do with it."</p>

<p>"You're damned well right, I didn't," he answered. "And you're
going to tell them so. Now, I was a fool once, but you won't
catch me that way again: I begged and pleaded to get you in here
and you go and play a dirty trick like this. And you're going to
pay for it, too."</p>

<p>"I'll pay, I'll pay," Robert said hastily. "I know it was my
fault. I'll pay whatever they ask. Have they said anything to you
about it?" he said nervously. "What do they say?"</p>

<p>"They say you've got to pay for all the damage that you've
done and get out of the hotel at once."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll pay!" he said earnestly, and with a pleading note in
his voice. "I don't want to leave the hotel. . . . I'll never act
like that again. . . . Does Gibbs want to see me?" he said
nervously.</p>

<p>"You can just bet your bottom dollar he does! And right
now!"</p>

<p>"Come on!" said Robert coaxingly. "You go with me. . . . He'll
listen to you. . . . Tell him how it was."</p>

<p>"Tell him how it was! Why, he knows damn well how it was! And
so do you! You were lousy and crazy-drunk, that's how it was. . .
. No, I won't do it: I've been your goat long enough. You'll have
to fight it out with him for yourself. . . . And don't you bring
my name into it, either, Robert; this was a hell of a thing to
do!" Eugene yelled furiously. "In God's name, what's got into
you? Have you gone mad?"</p>

<p>"Ah," he said in a brooding, sullen tone, "you know what it
is. . . . It's that woman. . . . It's Martha! I can't get her off
my mind, I think about her all the time. . . . My God, Eugene, if
something doesn't happen soon, I will go crazy, sure enough."</p>

<p>"Happen! What do you want to happen?"</p>

<p>He beat himself, suddenly and savagely, on his breast.</p>

<p>"Christ knows!" he said. "Something's got to break loose . . .
here . . . here . . . here!" His eyes were shot with tears and a
madness of desperation: in this baffled and infuriated gesture
there was something that was really painful, tortured, and deeply
moving: all at once Eugene felt sorry for him; he did not know
why Robert wanted to stay at the hotel any longer; he did not
know what he found there in that shabby and sterile life to
attract or interest him, and perhaps it was nothing except a
sense in him that he was disgraced, an outcast from the ranks of
orderly society: he wanted to stay in order to subdue the fear
and shame he felt, and to soothe, in whatever way he could, his
lacerated pride. Therefore Eugene resolved to help him.</p>

<p>"Robert," he said, "if you really want to stay here, why don't
you go and see old Gibbs and talk to him. Tell him you're sorry
for all the trouble you made and the damage you did, and that
you're willing to pay whatever he says is fair. Then let him
rave. He's a sour old devil and he'll bawl you out, but let him
rave. He enjoys it. Then tell him if he'll let you stay, you'll
never act like this again. And if I can help out any, I'll do
it."</p>

<p>He agreed to this at once, and Eugene left him and went to his
own room: when he went downstairs a few minutes later on his way
to his first-class, Robert was standing at the desk, submissively
attentive to the tongue-lashing Gibbs was giving him. The little
man was in a state of trembling denunciation, he squinted and
peered at Robert's face, and wagged an indignant finger at him;
his shrewd, sour, nasal voice carried to all parts of the room,
and Robert listened apologetically and sorrowfully, putting in a
word of penitent assent from time to time, in a deep, respectful
voice:</p>

<p>"I quite agree with you. . . . You are absolutely right, sir.
. . . It was a terrible thing to do. . . . I'll never do it again
as long as I live . . . I'll pay you for every bit of damage that
I did"--and he took out his cheque-book and opened it upon the
counter. Eugene went over and joined them: the old man was
beginning to simmer down somewhat into occasional howls and
blasts of fury, like a hurricane which has spent its fiercest
violence and is in process of abatement: Robert began to talk
smoothly, entreatingly, and charmingly--he swore to a complete
and abject repentance, spoke touchingly and mysteriously of great
storms and tragedies in his recent life which had driven him to
this mad and violent explosion, and gave his solemn oath never to
repeat the experience again if he was only allowed to remain in
the hotel: Eugene put in a word of agreement here and there when
he thought it might help--the upshot of it was that Gibbs finally
began to speak to Robert in a tone of almost paternal affection,
a kind of radiance was given off from his meagre soul, he bent
towards Robert intimately, he even laughed--and when they
departed, to their astonishment, he even gave the repentant
sinner a warm squeeze of the hand and a friendly pat upon the
shoulder.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Within a period of three furious months Robert made trips to
Colorado seven times: he got on trains and was hurled 2000 miles
across the continent as casually as a man would make the subway
trip from Times Square to Brooklyn Heights. Sometimes he would
leave New York on Friday night and be back within four or five
days, after spending ten hours with Martha Upshaw: sometimes he
would be gone a week, and once he did not return for three. On
this occasion Eugene received a telegram from him when he had
been absent about five days: the message curtly bade Eugene to
send all his mail to a hotel in Colorado Springs until further
notice, and said he would explain on his return.</p>

<p>Eugene was sitting in the lobby one evening two weeks later
when Robert came in. He walked with a limp and his face seemed to
have undergone a curious angular distortion: he came toward
Eugene with a kind of frozen grin and when he spoke to him he
began to mutter something incoherent between set teeth and to
point with his finger at his jaw. In a few moments, Eugene was
able to decipher his jargon sufficiently to understand that his
jaw and nose were broken, that most of the teeth had been
extracted, in order that the jaw-bone might be wired together,
and that he could not open his mouth now, either to speak or eat,
because of wires that bound the fracture. In addition, his nose,
which had been strong and straight, now curved sideways in a wide
broken arc.</p>

<p>Robert was shockingly thin and wasted, he said he had bled a
great deal, and had been unable to eat any solid food since his
injury: it was obvious he had about reached the limit of his
strength, the whole contour of his skull was visible, his eyes
were sunken and burned with a more furious and fatal glow than
ever before.</p>

<p>But he laughed at Eugene's look of stupefaction when he saw
him, and laughed again, morosely and indifferently, as he told
him the cause of his injuries: he said he had been driving with
Martha Upshaw the night he got to Colorado Springs, both had been
to a roadhouse and were drunk and neither, to use his description
of their feeling, "gave a damn." The girl was driving, the hour
was late, they had come round a curve in a mountain road at great
speed, the car had left the road, plunged down a steep
embankment, and turned over three times before it smashed up
against a tree. The girl had been badly cut by broken glass and
had several stitches taken in wounds on her face and head, but
she broke no bones. Robert had been hurled twenty feet from the
car, he was unconscious and bleeding horribly, and it had been
thought at first his injuries were fatal.</p>

<p>But here he was, at least a vital piece of him, smashed and
broken, but still fiercely living. It was obvious, however, that
this final catastrophe had hardened his spirit in a resolute
desperation: the suicidal fatalism--that hunger for death which
all men have in them and which is perhaps as strong a
driving-force in man as the hunger for life--and which had been
strongly marked in Robert only when he was drunk--had now become
the habit of his soul. He no longer cared whether he lived or
died, in his inmost heart he had grown amorous of death, and it
was evident that living flesh and bone could not much longer
endure the cruel beating he had given it. And this fact--this
shocking, visible, physical fact--as much as anything--sealed him
in fatal desperation, confirmed him in his belief that everything
was lost.</p>

<p> </p>

<h1>LI</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Man's youth is a wonderful thing: it is so full of anguish and
of magic and he never comes to know it as it is, until it has
gone from him for ever. It is the thing he cannot bear to lose,
it is the thing whose passing he watches with infinite sorrow and
regret, it is the thing whose loss he must lament for ever, and
it is the thing whose loss he really welcomes with a sad and
secret joy, the thing he would never willingly re-live again,
could it be restored to him by any magic.</p>

<p>Why is this? The reason is that the strange and bitter miracle
of life is nowhere else so evident as in our youth. And what is
the essence of that strange and bitter miracle of life which we
feel so poignantly, so unutterably, with such a bitter pain and
joy, when we are young? It is this: that being rich, we are so
poor; that being mighty, we can yet have nothing, that seeing,
breathing, smelling, tasting all around us the impossible wealth
and glory of this earth, feeling with an intolerable certitude
that the whole structure of the enchanted life--the most
fortunate, wealthy, good, and happy life that any man has ever
known--is ours--is ours at once, immediately and for ever, the
moment that we choose to take a step, or stretch a hand, or say a
word--we yet know that we can really keep, hold, take, and
possess for ever--nothing. All passes; nothing lasts: the moment
that we put our hand upon it it melts away like smoke, is gone
for ever, and the snake is eating at our heart again; we see then
what we are and what our lives must come to.</p>

<p>A young man is so strong, so mad, so certain, and so lost. He
has everything and he is able to use nothing. He hurls the great
shoulder of his strength for ever against phantasmal barriers, he
is a wave whose power explodes in lost mid-oceans under timeless
skies, he reaches out to grip a fume of painted smoke; he wants
all, feels the thirst and power for everything, and finally gets
nothing. In the end, he is destroyed by his own strength,
devoured by his own hunger, impoverished by his own wealth.
Thoughtless of money or the accumulation of material possessions,
he is none the less defeated in the end by his own greed--a greed
that makes the avarice of King Midas seem paltry by
comparison.</p>

<p>And that is the reason why, when youth is gone, every man will
look back upon that period of his life with infinite sorrow and
regret. It is the bitter sorrow and regret of a man who knows
that once he had a great talent and wasted it, of a man who knows
that once he had a great treasure and got nothing from it, of a
man who knows that he had strength enough for everything and
never used it.</p>

<p>All youth is bound to be "misspent"; there is something in its
very nature that makes it so, and that is why all men regret it.
And that regret becomes more poignant as the knowledge comes to
us that this great waste of youth was utterly unnecessary, as we
discover, with a bitter irony of mirth, that youth is something
which only young men have, and which only old men know how to
use. And for that reason, in later years, we all look back upon
our youth with sorrow and regret--seeing what a wealth was ours
if we had used it--remembering Weisberg, Snodgrass, and
O'Hare--finally remembering with tenderness and joy the good
bleak visage of the pavement cipher who was the first friend we
ever knew in the great city--in whose grey face its million
strange and secret mysteries were all compact--and who was our
friend, our brother, and this earth's nameless man. And so Eugene
recalled Abraham Jones.</p>

<p>This ugly, good, and loyal creature had almost forgotten his
real name: the "Jones," of course, was one of those random
acquisitions which, bestowed in some blind, dateless moment of
the past, evoked a picture of those nameless hordes of driven and
frightened people who had poured into this country within the
last half-century, and whose whole lives had been determined for
them by the turn of a word, the bend of a street, the drift of
the crowd, or a surly and infuriated gesture by some ignorant
tyrant of an official. In such a way, Abe Jones's father, a
Polish Jew, without a word of Yankee English in his throat, had
come to Castle Garden forty years before and, stunned and
frightened by the moment's assault of some furious little swine
of a customs inspector, had stood dumbly while the man snarled
and menaced him: "What's yer name? . . . Huh? . . . Don't yuh
know what yer name is? . . . Huh? . . . Ain't yuh got a name? . .
. Huh?" To all this the poor Jew had no answer but a stare of
stupefaction and terror: at length a kind of frenzy seized him--a
torrent of Polish, Jewish, Yiddish speech poured from his mouth,
but never a word his snarling inquisitor could understand. The
Jew begged, swore, wept, pleaded, prayed, entreated--a thousand
tales of horror, brutal violence and tyranny swept through his
terror-stricken mind, the whole vast obscene chronicle of
immigration gleaned from the mouths of returned adventurers or
from the letters of those who had triumphantly passed the gates
of wrath: he showed his papers, he clasped his hands, he swore by
all the oaths he knew that all was as it should be, that he had
done all he had been told to do, that there was no trick or fraud
or cheat in anything he did or said, and all the time, the foul,
swollen, snarling face kept thrusting at him with the same
maddening and indecipherable curse: "Yer name! . . . Yer name! .
. . Fer Christ's sake don't yuh know yer own name? . . . All
right!" he shouted suddenly, furiously, "If yuh ain't got a name
I'll give yuh one! . . . If yuh ain't got sense enough to tell me
what yer own name is, I'll find one for yuh!" The snarling face
came closer: "Yer name's Jones! See! J-o-n-e-s. Jones! That's a
good Amurrican name. See? I'm giving yuh a good honest Amurrican
name that a lot of good decent Amurricans have got. Yuh've gotta
try to live up to it and desoive it! See? Yer in Amurrica now,
Jones. . . . See? . . . Yuh've gotta t'ink fer yerself, Jones. In
Amurrica we know our own name. We've been trained to t'ink fer
ourselves over here! . . . See? Yer not one of them foreign
dummies any more! . . . Yer Jones--Jones--Jones!" he yelled.
"See!"--and in such a way, on the impulsion of brutal authority
and idiotic chance, Abe's father had been given his new name.
Eugene did not know what Abe's real name was: Abe had told him
once, and he remembered it as something pleasant, musical, and
alien to our tongue, difficult for our mouths to shape and
utter.</p>

<p>Already, when he had first met Abe Jones in the first class he
taught, the process of mutation had carried so far that he was
trying to rid himself of the accursed "Abraham," reducing it to
an ambiguous initial, and signing his papers with a simple
unrevealing "A. Jones," as whales are said to have lost through
atrophy the use of legs with which they once walked across the
land, but still to carry upon their bodies the rudimentary stump.
Now, in the last year, he had dared to make a final
transformation, shocking, comical, pitifully clumsy in its effort
at concealment and deception: when Eugene had tried to find his
name and number in the telephone directory a month before, among
the great grey regiment of Joneses, the familiar, quaint, and
homely "Abe" had disappeared--at length he found him coyly
sheltered under the gentlemanly obscurity of A. Alfred Jones. The
transformation, thus, had been complete: he was now, in name at
any rate, a member of the great Gentile aristocracy of Jones; and
just as "Jones" had been thrust by violence upon his father, so
had Abe taken violently, by theft and rape, the "Alfred." There
was something mad and appalling in the bravado, the effrontery,
and the absurdity of the attempt: what did he hope to do with
such a name? What reward did he expect to win? Was he engaged in
some vast conspiracy in which all depended on the <i>sound</i>
and not the <i>appearance</i> of deception? Was he using the
mails in some scheme to swindle or defraud? Was he carrying on by
correspondence an impassioned courtship of some ancient Christian
maiden with one tooth and a million shining dollars? Or was it
part of a gigantic satire on Gentile genteelness, country-club
Christianity, a bawdy joke perpetrated at the expense of sixty
thousand anguished and protesting Social Registerites? That he
should hope actually to palm himself off as a Gentile was
unthinkable, because one look at him revealed instantly the whole
story of his race and origin: if all the Polish-Russian Jews that
ever swarmed along the ghettoes of the earth had been compacted
in a single frame the physical result might have been something
amazingly like Eugene's friend, Abraham Jones.</p>

<p>The whole flag and banner of his race was in the enormous
putty-coloured nose that bulged, flared and sprouted with the
disproportionate extravagance of a caricature or a dill-pickle
over his pale, slightly freckled and rather meagre face; he had a
wide, thin, somewhat cruel-looking mouth, dull weak eyes that
stared, blinked, and grew misty with a murky, somewhat slimily
ropy feeling behind his spectacles, a low, dull, and slanting
forehead, almost reptilian in its ugliness, that sloped painfully
back an inch or two into the fringes of unpleasantly greasy curls
and coils of dark, short, screwy hair. He was about the middle
height, and neither thin nor fat: his figure was rather big-boned
and angular, and yet it gave an impression of meagreness,
spareness, and somewhat tallowy toughness which so many city
people have, as if their ten thousand days and nights upon the
rootless pavement had dried all juice and succulence out of them,
as if asphalt and brick and steel had got into the conduits of
their blood and spirit, leaving them with a quality that is
tough, dry, meagre, tallowy, and somewhat calloused.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>What earth had nourished him? Had he been born and grown there
among the asphalt lilies and the pavement wheat? What corn was
growing from the cobble-stones? Or was there never a cry of earth
up through the beaten and unyielding cement of the streets? Had
he forgotten the immortal and attentive earth still waiting at
the roots of steel?</p>

<p>No. Beneath that cone of neat grey felt, behind the dreary,
tallowed pigment of his face, which had that thickened, stunned,
and deadened look one often sees upon the faces of old bruisers,
as if the violent and furious assault of stone and steel, the
million harsh metallic clangours, the brutal stupefaction of the
streets, at length had dried the flesh and thickened the skin,
and blunted, numbed and calloused the aching tumult of the
tortured and tormented senses--there still flowed blood as red
and wet as any which ever swarmed into the earth below the laurel
bush. He was a part, a drop, an indecipherable fraction of these
grey tides of swarming tissue that passed in ceaseless weft and
counter-weft upon the beaten pavements, at once a typical
man-swarm atom and a living man. Indistinguishable in his speech,
gait, dress, and tallowy pigmentation from the typical
cell-and-pavement article, at the same time, although ugly,
meagre, toughened, gnarled and half-articulate, angular as brick
and spare as steel webbing, with little juice and succulence, he
was honest, loyal, somehow good and memorable, grained with the
life and movement of a thousand streets, seasoned and alert, a
living character, a city man. In that horrible desperation of
drowning and atomic desolation among the numberless hordes that
swept along the rootless pavements, in Eugene's madness to know,
own, intrude behind the million barriers of brick, to root and
entrench himself in the hive, he seized upon that dreary, grey
and hopeless-looking Jew.</p>

<p>This was his history:</p>

<p>Abraham Jones was one of the youngest members of a large
family. In addition to two brothers, younger than himself, there
were three older brothers and two sisters. The family life was
close, complex, and passionate, torn by fierce dislikes and
dissensions, menaced by division among some of its members, held
together by equally fierce loyalties and loves among the others.
Abe disliked his father and hated one of his older brothers. He
loved one of his sisters and was attached to the other one by a
kind of loyalty of silence.</p>

<p>She, Sylvia, was a woman of perhaps thirty-five years when
Eugene first saw her; she had not lived at home for ten years,
she was a febrile, nervous, emaciated, highly enamelled city
woman--a lover of what was glittering and electric in life,
caught up in the surge of a furious and feverish life, and yet
not content with it, dissonant, irritable and impatient. Like the
rest of her family she had been forced to shift for herself since
childhood: she had been first a salesgirl, then a worker in a
millinery shop, and now, through her own cleverness, smartness,
and ability, she had achieved a very considerable success in
business. She ran a hat shop on Second Avenue, which Abe told him
was the Broadway of the lower East Side: she had a small,
elegant, glittering jewel of a shop there, blazing with hard
electric light and smartly and tastefully dressed with windows
filled with a hundred jaunty styles in women's hats. She did a
thriving business and employed several assistants.</p>

<p>The first time Eugene met her, one day when Abe had taken him
home to the flat where he lived with his mother, two of his
brothers, and Sylvia's child, he thought she had the look and
quality of an actress much more than of a business woman. There
was a remarkably electric glitter and unnaturalness about her: it
seemed as if the only light that had ever shone upon her had been
electric light, the only air she could breathe with any certitude
and joy the clamorous and electric air of Broadway. Her face
belonged, indeed, among those swarms of livid, glittering,
night-time faces that pour along the street, with that mysterious
fraternity of night-time people who all seem to speak a common
language and to be bound together by some central interest and
communication, who live mysteriously and gaudily without
discoverable employments, in a world remote and alien. Sylvia was
a woman of middling height, but of a dark and almost bird-like
emaciation: all the flesh seemed to have been starved, wasted,
and consumed from her by this devil of feverish and electric
unrest and discontent that glittered with almost a drugged
brilliance in her large dark eyes. Every visible portion of her
body--hair, eyebrows, lashes, lips, skin and nails--was greased,
waved, leaded, rouged, plucked, polished, enamelled and varnished
with the conventional extravagance of a ritualistic mask until
now it seemed that all of the familiar qualities of living tissue
had been consumed and were replaced by the painted image, the
varnished mask of a face, designed in its unreality to catch,
reflect, and realize effectively the thousand lurid shifting
lights and weathers of an electric, nocturnal, and inhuman world.
Moreover, she was dressed in the most extreme and sharpest
exaggeration of the latest style, her thin long hands, which were
unpleasantly and ominously veined with blue, and her fragile
wrists, which were so thin and white that light made a pink
transparency in them when she lifted them, were covered,
loaded--one vast encrusted jewelled glitter of diamond rings and
bracelets: a fortune in jewellery blazed heavily and shockingly
on her bony little hands.</p>

<p>Her life had been hard, painful, difficult, full of work and
sorrow. Ten years before, when she was twenty-five years old, she
had had her first--and probably her last--love affair. She had
fallen in love with an actor at the Settlement Guild--a little
East Side theatre maintained by the donations of two rich
&aelig;sthetic females. She had left her family and become his
mistress: within less than a year the man deserted her, leaving
her pregnant.</p>

<p>Her child was a boy: she had no maternal feeling and her son,
now nine years old, had been brought up by Abe's mother and by
Abe. Sylvia rarely saw her son: she had long ago deserted the
orthodoxy of Jewish family life; she had a new, impatient,
driving, feverish city life of her own, she visited her family
every month or so, and it was then, and only then, that she saw
her child. This boy, Jimmy, was a bright, quick, attractive
youngster, with a tousled sheaf of taffy-coloured hair, and with
the freckled, tough, puggish face and the cocky mutilated
pavement argot and assurance of the city urchin: he was
nevertheless excellently clothed, schooled, and cared for, for
the old woman, Abe's mother, watched and guarded over him with
the jealous brooding apprehension of an ancient hen, and Sylvia
herself was most generous in her expenditures and benefactions,
not only for the child, but also for the family.</p>

<p>The relation between Sylvia and her illegitimate child Jimmy
was remarkable. He never called her "mother"; in fact, neither
seemed to have a name for the other, save an impersonal and
rather awkward "You." Moreover, the attitude of both mother and
child was marked by a quality that was hard, knowing, and cynical
in its conversation: when she spoke to him her tone and manner
were as cold and impersonal as if the child had been a stranger
or some chance acquaintance, and this manner was also touched by
a quality that was resigned and somewhat mocking--with a mockery
which seemed to be directed toward herself more than toward
anyone, as if in the physical presence of the boy she saw the
visible proof and living evidence of her folly, the bitter fruit
of the days of innocence, love, and guileless belief, and as if
she was conscious that a joke had been played on both her and her
child. And the boy seemed to understand and accept this feeling
with a sharp correspondence of feeling, almost incredible in a
child. And yet they did not hate each other: their conversations
were cynically wise and impersonal and yet curiously honest and
respectful. She would look at him for a moment with an air of
cold and casual detachment, and that faint smile of mockery when,
on one of her visits home, he would come in, panting and
dishevelled, a tough and impish urchin, from the street.</p>

<p>"Come here, you," she would say at length, quietly, harshly.
"Whatcha been doin' to yourself?" she would ask, in the same hard
tone, as deftly she straightened and re-knotted his tie, smoothed
out his rumpled sheaf of oaken-coloured hair. "You look as if yuh
just crawled out of someone's ash-can."</p>

<p>"Ah!" he said in his tough, high city-urchin's voice, "a
coupla guys tried to get wise wit' me an' I socked one of 'em.
Dat's all!"</p>

<p>"Oh-ho-ho-ho!"--Abe turned his grey grinning face prayerfully
to heaven and laughed softly, painfully.</p>

<p>"Fightin", huh?" said Sylvia. "Do you remember what I told you
last time?" she said in a warning tone. "If I catch yuh fightin'
again there's goin' to be no more ball games. <i>You'll</i> stay
<i>home</i> next time."</p>

<p>"Ah!" he cried again in a high protesting tone. "What's a guy
gonna do? Do you t'ink I'm gonna let a coupla mugs like dat get
away wit' moidah?"</p>

<p>"Oh-ho-ho-ho!" cried Abe, lifting his great nose prayerfully
again; then with a sudden shift to reproof and admonition, he
said sternly: "What kind of talk do you call that? Huh? Didn't I
tell you not to say 'mugs'?"</p>

<p>"Ah, what's a guy gonna say?" cried Jimmy. "I neveh could loin
all dem big woids, noway."</p>

<p>"My God! I wish you'd listen to 'm," his mother said in a tone
of hard and weary resignation. "I suppose that's what I'm sendin'
him to school for! <i>'Loin, woids, noway, t'ink!</i> Is
<i>that</i> the way to talk?" she demanded harshly. "Is
<i>that</i> what they teach yuh?"</p>

<p>"Say <i>think!"</i> commanded Abe.</p>

<p>"I <i>did</i> say it," the child answered evasively.</p>

<p>"Go on! You <i>didn't!</i> You didn't say it right. I'll bet
you can't say it right. Come on! Let's hear you:
<i>think!"</i></p>

<p>"T'ink," Jimmy answered immediately.</p>

<p>"Oh-ho-ho-ho!"--and Abe lifted his grinning face heavenward,
saying, "Say! This is rich!"</p>

<p>"Can yuh beat it?" the woman asked.</p>

<p>And, for a moment she continued to look at her son with a
glance that was quizzical, tinged with a mocking resignation, and
yet with a cold, detached affection. Then her long blue-veined
hands twitched nervously and impatiently until all the crusted
jewels on her wrists and fingers blazed with light: she sighed
sharply and, looking away, dismissed the child from her
consideration.</p>

<p>Although the boy saw very little of his mother, Abe watched
and guarded over him as tenderly as if he had been his father. If
the child were late in coming home from school, if he had not had
his lunch before going out to play, if he remained away too long
Abe showed his concern and distress very plainly, and he spoke
very sharply and sternly at times to the other members of the
family if he thought they had been lax in some matter pertaining
to the boy.</p>

<p>"Did Jimmy get home from school yet?" he would ask sharply.
"Did he eat before he went out again? . . . Well, why did you let
him get away, then, before he had his lunch? . . . For heaven's
sake! You're here all day long: you could at least do that
much--I can't be here to watch him all the time, you know--don't
you know the kid ought never to go out to play until he's had
something to eat?"</p>

<p>Eugene saw the child for the first time one day when Abe had
taken him home for dinner: Abe, in his crisp neat shirt-sleeves,
was seated at the table devouring his food with a wolfish and
prowling absorption, and yet in a cleanly and fastidious way,
when the child entered. The boy paused in surprise when he saw
Eugene: his wheaten sheaf of hair fell down across one eye, one
trouser leg had come unbanded at the knee and flapped down to his
ankle, and for a moment he looked at Eugene with a rude frank
stare of his puggish freckled face.</p>

<p>Abe, prowling upward from his food, glanced at the boy and
grinned; then, jerking his head sharply toward Eugene, he said
roughly:</p>

<p>"Whatcha think of this guv? Huh?"</p>

<p>"Who is he?" the boy asked in his high tough little voice,
never moving his curious gaze from Eugene.</p>

<p>"He's my teacher," Abe said. "He's the guy that teaches
me."</p>

<p>"Ah, g'wan!" the child answered in a protesting tone, still
fixing Eugene with his steady and puzzled stare.</p>

<p>"Whatcha handin' me? He's <i>not!"</i></p>

<p>"Sure he is! No kiddin'!" Abe replied. "He's the guy that
teaches me English."</p>

<p>"Ah, he's <i>not</i>!<i>"</i> the boy answered decisively.
"Yuh're bein' wise."</p>

<p>"What makes you think he's not?" Abe asked.</p>

<p>"If he's an English teacher," Jimmy said triumphantly, "w'y
don't he say somet'ing? W'y don't he use some of dose woids?"</p>

<p>"Oh-ho-ho-ho!" cried Abe, lifting his great bleak nose aloft.
"Say! . . . This is good! . . . This is swell! . . . Say, that's
some kid!" he said when the boy had departed. "There's not much
gets by <i>him!"</i> And lifting his grey face heavenward again,
he laughed softly, painfully, in gleeful and tender
reminiscence.</p>

<p>Thus, the whole care and government of the boy had been
entrusted to Abe and his mother: Sylvia herself, although she
paid liberally all her child's expenses, took no other interest
in him. She was a hard, feverish, bitter, and over-stimulated
woman, and yet she had a kind of harsh loyalty to her family: she
was, in a fierce and smouldering way, very ambitious for Abe, who
seemed to be the most promising of her brothers: she was
determined that he should go to college and become a lawyer, and
his fees at the university, in part at any rate, were paid by his
sister--in part only, not because Sylvia would not have paid all
without complaint, but because Abe insisted on paying as much as
he could through his own labour, for Abe, too, had embedded in
him a strong granite of independence, the almost surly dislike,
of a strong and honest character, of being beholden to anyone for
favours. On this score, indeed, he had the most sensitive and
tender pride of anyone Eugene had ever known.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>At home Abe had become, by unspoken consent, the head of a
family which now consisted only of his mother, two brothers, and
his sister's illegitimate child Jimmy. Two of his older brothers,
who were in business together, had married and lived away from
home, as did Sylvia, and another sister, Rose, who had married a
musician in a theatre orchestra a year or two before; she was a
dark, tortured and sensitive Jewess with a big nose and one blind
eye. Her physical resemblance to Abe was marked. She was a very
talented pianist, and once or twice he took Eugene to visit her
on Sunday afternoons: she played for them in a studio room in
which candles were burning and she carried on very technical and
knowing conversations about the work of various composers with
her brother. Abe listened to the music when she played with an
obscure and murky smile: he seemed to know a great deal about
music: it awakened a thousand subtle echoes in his Jewish soul,
but for Eugene, somehow, the music, and something arrogant,
scornful, and secretive in their knowingness, together with the
dreary consciousness of a winter's Sunday afternoon outside, the
barren streets, the harsh red waning light of day, and a terrible
sensation of thousands of other knowing Jews--the men with little
silken moustaches--who were coming from concerts at that moment,
awakened in him vague but powerful emotions of nakedness,
rootlessness, futility and misery, which even the glorious memory
of the power, exultancy and joy of poetry could not conquer or
subdue. The scene evoked for him suddenly a thousand images of a
sterile and damnable incertitude, in which man groped
indefinitely along the smooth metallic sides of a world in which
there was neither warmth, nor depth, nor door to enter, nor walls
to shelter him: he got suddenly a vision of a barren Sunday and a
grey despair, of ugly streets and of lights beginning to wink and
flicker above cheap moving-picture houses and chop-suey
restaurants, and of a raucous world of cheap and flashy people,
as trashy as their foods, as trivial and infertile as their
accursed amusements, and finally of the Jews returning through a
thousand streets, in that waning and desolate light, from
symphony concerts, an image which, so far from giving a note of
hope, life, and passionate certitude and joy to the wordless
horror of this damned and blasted waste of Dead-Man's Land,
seemed to enhance it rather and to give it a conclusive note of
futility and desolation.</p>

<p>Abe and his sister did not seem to feel this: instead the
scene, the time, the day, the waning light, the barren streets,
the music, awakened in them something familiar and obscure, a
dark and painful joy, a certitude Eugene did not feel. They
argued, jibed, and sneered harshly and arrogantly at each other:
their words were sharp and cutting, impregnated with an
aggressive and unpleasant intellectualism; they called each other
fools and sentimental ignoramuses, and yet they did not seem to
be wounded or offended by this harsh intercourse: they seemed
rather to derive a kind of bitter satisfaction from it.</p>

<p>Already, the first year Eugene had known him he had discovered
this strange quality in these people: they seemed to delight in
jeering and jibing at one another; and at the same time their
harsh mockery had in it an element of obscure and disquieting
affection. At this time Abe was carrying on, week by week, a
savage correspondence with another young Jew who had been
graduated with him from the same class in high school. He always
had in his pocket at least one of the letters this boy had
written him, and he was for ever giving it to Eugene to read, and
then insisting that he read his answer. In these letters they
flew at each other with undisciplined ferocity, they hurled
denunciation, mockery, and contempt at each other, and they
seemed to exult in it. The tone of their letters was marked by an
affectation of cold impersonality and austerity, and yet this
obviously was only a threadbare cloak to the furious storm of
personal insult and invective, the desire to crow over the other
man and humiliate him, which seemed to delight them. "In your
last letter," one would write, "I see that the long-expected
<i>d&eacute;b&acirc;cle</i> has now occurred. In our last year at
high school I saw occasional gleams of adult intelligence in your
otherwise infantile and adolescent intellect, and I had some hope
of saving you, but I now see my hopes were wasted--your puerile
remarks on Karl Marx, Anatole France, <i>et al.,</i> show you up
as the fat-headed bourgeois you always were, and I accordingly
wash my hands of you. You reveal plainly that your intellect is
incapable of grasping the issues involved in modern socialism:
you are a romantic individualist and you will find everything you
say elegantly embalmed in the works of the late Lord Byron, which
is where you belong also: your mother should dress you up in a
cowboy suit and give you a toy pistol to play with before you
hurt yourself playing around with great big rough grown-up
men."</p>

<p>Abe would read Eugene one of these letters, grinning widely
with Kike delight, lifting his grinning face and laughing softly,
"Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho!" as he came to some particularly venomous
insult.</p>

<p>"But who wrote you such a letter?" Eugene demanded.</p>

<p>"Oh, a guy I went to school with," he answered, "a friend of
mine!"</p>

<p>"A friend of yours! Is that the kind of letter that your
friends write you?"</p>

<p>"Sure," he said. "Why not? He's a good guy. He doesn't mean
anything by it. He's got bats in the belfry, that's all. But wait
till you see what I wrote <i>him!"</i> he cried, grinning
exultantly as he took his own letter from his pocket. "Wait till
you see what I call <i>him!</i> Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho!"--softly,
painfully, he laughed. "Say, this is rich!" and gleefully he
would read his answer: five closely typed pages of bitter insult
and vituperation.</p>

<p>Another astonishing and disquieting circumstance of this
brutal correspondence was now revealed: this extraordinary
"friend" of Abe's, who wrote him these insulting letters, had not
gone abroad, nor did he live in some remote and distant city.
When Eugene asked Abe where this savage critic lived, he
answered: "Oh, a couple of blocks from where I live."</p>

<p>"But do you ever see him?"</p>

<p>"Sure. Why not?" he said, looking at Eugene in a puzzled way.
"We grew up together. I see him all the time."</p>

<p>"And yet you write this fellow letters and he writes you, when
you live only a block apart and see each other all the time?"</p>

<p>"Sure. Why not?" said Abe.</p>

<p>He saw nothing curious or unusual in the circumstance, and yet
there was something disturbing and unpleasant about it: in all
these letters Eugene had observed, below the tirades of abuse, an
obscure, indefinable, and murky emotionalism that was somehow
ugly.</p>

<p>Within a few months, however, this strange communication with
his Jewish comrade ceased abruptly: Eugene began to see Abe, in
the halls and corridors of the university, squiring various
Jewish girls around with a sheepish and melancholy look. His lust
for letter-writing still raged with unabated violence, although
now the subjects of his correspondence were women. His attitude
towards girls had always been cold and scornful: he regarded
their cajoleries and enticements with a fishy eye and with a vast
Jewish caution and suspiciousness, and he laughed scornfully at
anyone who allowed himself to be ensnared. Like many people who
feel deeply, and who are powerfully affected by the slightest and
remotest changes in their emotions, he had convinced himself that
he was a creature whose every action was governed by the
operations of cool reason, and accordingly now that his feelings
were powerfully and romantically involved in thoughts about
several of these warm and luscious-looking Jewish wenches, he
convinced himself that he "cared only for their minds" and that
what he really sought from them was the stimulation of
intellectual companionship. Accordingly, the love-letters which
this great-nosed innocent now wrote to them, and read to Eugene,
were extraordinary and unwitting productions of defence and
justification.</p>

<p>". . . I think I observe in your last letter," Abe would
write, "traces of that romantic sentimentality which we have both
seen so often in these childish lives around us but from which
you and I long ago freed ourselves. As you know, Florence, we
both agreed at the beginning that we would not spoil our
friendship by the intrusion of a puerile and outmoded
romanticism. Sex can play no part in our relations, Florence: it
is at best a simple biological necessity, the urge of the hungry
animal which should be recognized as such and satisfied without
intruding on the higher faculties. Have you read Havelock Ellis
yet? If not, you must read him without further delay. . . . So
Myrtle Goldberg really thought I was in earnest that night of the
dance. . . . Ye Gods! It is to laugh! Ha-ha! What fools these
mortals be . . . I laugh, and yet I do not laugh . . . I laugh
and observe my laughter, and then there is yet another level of
reality which observes my laughter at my laughter. . . . I play
the clown with an ironic heart and put on the grinning mask these
fools wish to see. . . . <i>O tempora! O
mores!"</i>--<i>etcetera.</i></p>

<p>And yet these same letters, in which he protested the cold
detachment of his spirit, his freedom from the romantic
fleshliness which degraded the lives of lesser men, were
invariably tagged and embellished by little verses of his own
contriving, all of them inspired by the emotion he pretended to
despise. He always had a number of these little poems written
down in a small note-book of black leather which he carried with
him, and in which, at this time, with a precise and meticulous
hand, he noted down his rarest thoughts, excerpts from books he
had been reading, and these brief poems. At this lime Abe was in
a state of obscure and indefinable evolution: it was impossible
to say what he would become, or what form his life would take,
nor could he have told, himself. He walked along at a stooping
loping gait, his face prowling around mistrustfully and with a
glance full of tortured discontent: he was tormented by a dozen
obscure desires and purposes and by a deep but murky
emotionalism: his flesh was ugly, bowed and meagre--conscious of
a dreary inferiority (thus, in later and more prosperous years,
he confessed to Eugene that he loved to abuse and "order around"
brusquely the waiters in restaurants, because of the feeling of
power and authority it gave him), but his spirit was sustained by
an immense and towering vanity, a gloomy egotism which told him
he was not as other men, that his thoughts and feelings were too
profound and rare to be understood and valued by the base world
about him. At the same time he was secretly and fiercely
ambitious, although the energy of his ambition was scattered in a
half-dozen directions and could fasten on no purpose: by turn, he
wanted to be a teacher and a great investigator in the
sciences--and in this he might have succeeded, for he showed a
brilliant aptness in biology and physics--or an economist, a
critic of literature, an essayist, a historian, a poet, or a
novelist. His desire was high: at this time he did not want to
make money; he regarded a life that was given up to money-making
with contempt, and although he sometimes spoke of the study of
medicine, he looked at the profession of law, which was the
profession his sister and his family wanted him to follow, with
horror and revulsion: he shrank with disgust from the prospect of
joining the hordes of beak-nosed crooks, poured out of the law
school year by year and who were adept in every dodge of
dishonourable trickery, in working every crooked wire, or
squirming through each rat's hole of escape and evasion the vast
machinery of the law afforded them.</p>

<p>Such a man was Abe Jones when Eugene first knew him: dreary,
tortured, melancholy, dully intellectual and joylessly poetic,
his spirit gloomily engulfed in a great cloud of Yiddish murk, a
grey pavement cipher, an atom of the slums, a blind sea-crawl in
the drowning tides of the man-swarm, and yet, pitifully,
tremendously, with a million other dreary Hebrew yearners,
convinced that he was the Messiah for which the earth was
groaning. Such was he in the state of becoming, an indefinable
shape before necessity and his better parts--the hard, savage,
tough and honest city sinew, hardened the mould--made a man of
him,--this was Abe at this time, an obscure and dreary chrysalis,
and yet a dogged, loyal, and faithful friend, the salt of the
earth, a wonderfully good, rare, and high person.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>"Where shall I go now? What shall I do?" A dozen times that
year he made these tormented journeys of desire. Why did he make
them? What did he expect to find? He did not know: he only knew
that at night he would feel again the huge and secret quickening
of desire to which all life in the city moved, that he would be
drawn again, past hope and past belief, to the huge glare, the
swarming avenues of night, with their great tides of livid
night-time faces. He only knew that he would prowl again, again,
each night, the thronging passages of rats' alley where the dead
men were; that the million faces, forms and shapes of ungraspable
desire would pass, would weave and throng and vanish from his
grasp like evil figures in a dream, and that the old unanswered
questions which have foiled so many million lives lost there in
the labyrinthine maze and fury of the city's life, would come
back again, and that he never found an answer to them.</p>

<p>"What shall I do now? Where shall I go?" They returned to mock
his furious prowling of kaleidoscopic night with their
unsearchable enigmas and when this happened, instant, mad, and
overwhelming the desire to burst out of these canyoned walls that
held him in, this Tantalus mocker of a city that duped his hunger
with a thousand phantom shapes of impossible desire. And when
this blind and furious impulse came to him, he knew only one
desire--to escape, to escape instantly from the great well and
prison of the city; and he had only one conviction--wild, mad,
overmastering in its huge unreason--that escape, fulfilment, a
fortunate and impossibly happy fruition lay somewhere out across
the dark and lonely continent--was somewhere there in any of its
thousand silent sleeping little towns--could be found anywhere,
certainly, instantly, by the divining rod of miraculous chance,
upon the pounding wheels of a great train, at any random halt
made in the night.</p>

<p>Thus, by an ironic twist which at the time he did not see or
understand, this youth, who in his childhood, like a million
other boys, had dreamed and visioned in the darkness of the
shining city, and of the fortunate good and happy life that he
would find there, was now fleeing from it to find in unknown
little towns the thing that he had come to the great city to
possess.</p>

<p>A dozen times that year he made these mad and sudden journeys:
to New England many times, to Pennsylvania, or Virginia; and more
than once at night up the great river towards the secret
North.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>One night that year, in the month of March, he was returning
from the wintry North--from one of those sudden and furious
journeys of caprice, which were decided on the impulse of the
moment, towards which he was driven by the goadings of desire,
and from which he would return, as now, weary, famished,
unassuaged, and driven to seek anew in the city's life for some
appeasement.</p>

<p>Under an immense, stormy, and tempestuous sky the train was
rushing across the country with a powerful unperturbed movement;
it seemed in this dark and wintry firmament of earth and sky that
the train was the only fixed and timeless object--the land swept
past the windows of the train in a level and powerful tide of
white fields, clumped woodland, and the solid, dark, and warmly
grouped buildings of a farm, pierced scarcely by a light. High
up, in the immense and tempestuous skies, the clouds were driving
at furious speed, in an inexhaustible processional, across the
visage of a wild and desolate moon, which broke through momently
with a kind of savage and beleaguered reprisal to cast upon the
waste below a shattered, lost and fiercely ragged light. Here
then, in this storm-lost desolation of earth and sky, the train
hung poised as the only motionless and unchanging object, and all
things else--the driving and beleaguered moon, the fiercely
scudding clouds, the immense regimentation of heaven which
stormed onward with the fury of a gigantic and demoniacal
cavalry, and the lonely and immortal earth below sweeping past
with a vast fan-shaped stroke of field and wood and house--had in
them a kind of unchanging changefulness, a spoke-like recurrence
which, sweeping past into oblivion, would return as on the
upstroke of a wheel to repeat itself with an immutable precision,
an unvarying repetition.</p>

<p>And under the spell of this lonely processional of white
field, dark wood and wild driven sky, he fell into a state of
strange waking-sleepfulness, a kind of comatose perceptiveness
that the motion of the train at night had always induced in him.
In this weary world of sleep and wakefulness and all the flooding
visions of old time and memory, he was conscious of the grand
enchantments of the landscape which is at all times one of the
most beautiful and lovely on the continent, and which now, under
this wild spell of moon and scudding cloud and moving fields and
wintry woods, for ever stroking past the windows of the train,
evoked that wild and solemn joy--the sense of nameless hope,
impossible desire, and man's tragic brevity--which only the
wildness, the cruel and savage loveliness of the American earth
can give.</p>

<p>Thus, as he lay in his berth, in this strange state of
comatose perceptiveness he was conscious first of the vast level
snowclad fields of the Canadian boundaries, the lights of farms,
the whipping past of darkened little stations; then of a wooded
land, the foothills of the Adirondacks, dark with their wintry
foresting, wild with snow; the haunting vistas of the Champlain
country, strange as time, the noble music of Ticonderoga, with
its tread of Indians and old wars, and then the pleasant swelling
earth and fields and woods and lonely little towns set darkly in
the night with a few spare lights; and pauses in the night at
Saratoga, and for a moment the casual and familiar voices of
America, and people crowding in the windows of the train, and old
familiar words and quiet greetings, the sudden thrum and starting
of a motor car, and then dark misty woods, white fields, a few
spare lights and houses, all sweeping past beneath the wild
beleaguered moon with the fan-like stroke of the immortal and
imperturbable earth, with a wild and haunting loneliness, with
tragic brevity and strong joy.</p>

<p>Suddenly, in the middle of the night, he started up into sharp
wakefulness. The train had slackened in its speed, it was slowing
for a halt at the outskirts of a town: in the distance upon the
flanks of low sweeping hills he could see a bracelet of hard
bright lights, and presently the outposts of the town appeared.
And now he saw the spokes of empty wintry streets, and hard
street lamps that cast a barren light upon the grimy
fa&ccedil;ades of old houses; and now old grimy blocks of
buildings of brown stone and brick, all strange and close and
near and as familiar as a dream.</p>

<p>And now the train was slowing to its halt; the old red brick
of station warehouses, the worn rust and grime of factory walls
abutting on the tracks with startling nearness, and all of it was
as it had always been, as he had always known it, and yet he had
not seen the place before.</p>

<p>And now the train had slowed to a full halt; he found himself
looking at a wall of old red brick at one of the station's
corners. It was one of the old brick buildings that one sees in
the station section of almost any town: in the wall beside the
tracks there was a dingy-looking door and above the door a red
electric bulb was burning with a dim but sinister invitation.
Even as he looked the door opened, a man stepped quickly out,
looked quickly to both sides with the furtive and uneasy look men
have when they come out of a brothel, and then, turning up the
collar of his overcoat, he walked rapidly away.</p>

<p>And at the corner, in the first floor of the old brick
building, he could see a disreputable old bar-room, and this,
too, had this dreamlike, stage-like immediacy, it was so near to
him that he could almost have touched the building with his hand,
a kind of gigantic theatrical setting, overpowering in its
immediacy, as strange and as familiar as a dream.</p>

<p>Without moving in his berth he could look through the windows
of the bar, which were glazed or painted half-way up, and see
everything that was going on inside. Despite the lateness of the
hour--the round visage of a clock above the bar told him it was
just four o'clock--there were several people in the place, and it
was doing an open thriving business. Several men, who by their
look were probably railway workers, taxi-drivers, and night-time
prowlers of the station district--(one even wore black leather
leggings and had the fresh red complexion and healthy robust look
of a countryman)--were standing at the old dark walnut bar and
drinking beer. The bartender stood behind the bar with his thick
hands stretched out and resting on the bar, and with a wet cloth
in one hand. He wore an apron and was in his shirtsleeves; he had
the dead eyes and heavy sagging night-time face that some
bartenders have, but he could be seen talking to the men,
responding to their jests, with a ready professional cordiality
that was nevertheless warily ready for any situation that might
come up. And further down the bar, another man was drinking beer
and with him was a woman. She was one of the heavy coarsely
friendly and experienced prostitutes that one also finds in
railway sections; she was drinking beer, talking to the man
amiably and with coarse persuasiveness, and presently she took
his arm with a rude persuasive gesture and jerking her head
towards the stairs pulled him towards her. Grinning rather
sheepishly, with a pleased but foolish look, he went along with
her, and they could be seen going upstairs. When they were gone,
the other men drinking at the bar spoke quietly to the bartender,
and in a moment he could see them shaking with coarse guffawing
laughter. Behind the bar, in old ornately carved walnut frames,
there were big mirrors, and at the top of the central mirror
there was an American flag, fluted and spread fan-wise, and below
this there was a picture of the beetling eyebrows and nobly Roman
features of the President of the United States, Warren G.
Harding. The whole place looked very old and shabby, and yet
somehow warm; dingy with old lights, and stained with drink and
worn with countless elbows, and weary and worn and brutal with
its memories of ten thousand nights of brawls and lust and
drunkenness--its immeasurable age and dateless weariness of
violence and desire.</p>

<p>Then the train moved slowly on, and left this scene for ever;
it passed the street, and there were lights here, taxis, rows of
silent buildings, and then the station, the sight of the baggage
room big with trunks, piled with mail sacks, crates and boxes,
and there were also a few people, a yardman with a lantern, a
conductor waiting with a small case in his hand, a few
passengers, the brick sides of the station, and the concrete
quays.</p>

<p>Then the train stopped again, and this time it stopped across
the street at the other end of the station. And again, from his
dark berth, he could see without moving this whole immense and
immediate theatre of human event, and again it gripped and held
him with its dream-like magic, its unbelievable familiarity. At
the corner, in another old brick building, there was a little
luncheon-room of the kind he had seen ten thousand times before.
Several taxi-cabs were drawn up along the curb, and from the
luncheon-room he could hear the hoarse wrangling voices of the
taxi-drivers, joined in their incessant and trivial debate, and
through the misted window he could see the counterman, young,
thin, sallow, wearily attentive, wearing a dirty apron, and in
his shirt-sleeves, leaning back, his thin white arms humbly
folded as he listened.</p>

<p>And on the corner, just below the window of his berth, there
stood a boy of eighteen or twenty years. The boy was tall, thin,
and rather fragile-looking, his face had the sullen, scowling
almost feverish intensity that boys have on such occasions; he
stood there indecisively, as if trying to make up his mind,
resolve himself, towards his next action; he put a cigarette into
his mouth and lighted it and as he did so his hands trembled. He
turned up the collar of his overcoat impatiently, glanced
grudgingly and nervously about him and stood there smoking.</p>

<p>Meanwhile a young prostitute, still slender and good-looking,
came out of the back room, strolled over to the corner and stood
there indolently, looking round with an innocent and yet impudent
look, appearing not to look directly at the boy, or openly to
invite him, but plainly waiting for him to speak to her.</p>

<p>And all the time his efforts to make up his mind, to come to a
decision, were comically evident. He kept puffing nervously and
rapidly at his cigarette, glancing at the girl out of the corner
of his eye from time to time, pretending not to notice her, and
all the time steeling himself to a decisive action.</p>

<p>But even as he stood there in this temper, trying to focus his
wavering decision on a conclusive act, another man came up and
took the girl away from him. The other man was much older than
the boy; he was in his middle thirties, he was powerfully built
and well, though somewhat flashily dressed. He wore a grey felt
hat, set at a smart angle on his head, a well-fitting and
expensive-looking overcoat cut in at the waist in the "snappy"
Broadway fashion, and he looked like a prosperous Greek; he had a
strong, swarthy, brutal face, full of sensual assurance; he came
walking along the narrow sidewalk beside the tracks, and when he
saw the girl, he approached her instantly, with a swaggering
assurance, began to talk to her, and in a moment walked away with
her.</p>

<p>And again, the effect of this incident upon the boy was
comically, pathetically, apparent. He did not appear to notice
the girl and the Greek as they walked off together, but when they
had gone, his lean young face hardened suddenly, the scowl
deepened, and with a sudden angry movement he flung his cigarette
into the gutter, turned, and with the sudden resolution of a man
who is ashamed of his cowardly procrastination and indecision, he
began to walk rapidly along the dark and narrow little sidewalk
that ran down beside the tracks and along a row of shabby station
tenements.</p>

<p>And again, that strange and stage-like panorama of human
comedy was fantastically repeated: the train began to move, and
the boy kept pace with it, below the windows of the berth.
Immediately they began to pass the row of shabby old wooden
brothels that bordered on the tracks; the windows were closely
shuttered, but through the shutters there flamed hot exciting
bars of reddish light, and in the doorway entrances the small red
lights were burning. At the third house the boy paused, turned,
ran swiftly up the wooden steps and rang the bell; almost
instantly a small slot-like peep-hole in the door was opened, an
inquiring beak-like nose, a wisp of blondined hair peered out,
the door was opened, the boy entered in a glow of reddish light,
the door was closed behind him, and the train, gathering rapidly
in speed now, went on, past the police station where the
night-time cops were sitting, past spokes of brown streets, old
buildings, warehouses, factories, station tenements, the sudden
barren glare of corner lamps--the grimy fa&ccedil;ade of old
rusty buildings--the single substance and the million patterns of
America!</p>

<p>And now the train had left the town, and now there was a vast
and distant flare, incredible in loveliness, the enormous train
yards of the night, great dings and knellings on the tracks, the
flare and sweep of mighty rails, the huge and sudden stirrings of
the terrific locomotives.</p>

<p>And then there was just loneliness and earth and night, and
presently the river, the great and silent river, the noble,
spacious, kingly river sweeping on for ever through the land at
night to wash the basal cliffs and ramparts of the terrific city,
to flow for ever round its million-celled and prisoned sleepers,
and in the night-time, in the dark, in all the sleeping silence
of our lives to go flowing by us, by us, by us, to the sea.</p>

<p>That vision haunted him. He could not forget it. That boy who
stood there on the corner in that lonely little town at night
became the image of his own desire, of the desire of every youth
that ever lived, of all the lonely, secret, and unsleeping desire
of America, that lives for ever in the little towns at night,
that wakes at times, a lively, small, and savage flame, while all
the sleepers sleep, that burns there, unimprisoned and alone,
beneath immense and timeless skies, upon the dark and secret
visage of the continent, that prowls for ever past the shuttered
fa&ccedil;ades of the night, and furious, famished, unassuaged
and driven as it is, lives alone in darkness and will not
die.</p>

<p>That urge held and drew him with a magnetic power. Eight times
that spring he made that wild journey of impulse and desire up
the river. Eight times in darkness over pounding wheel and rod he
saw the wild and secret continent of night, the nocturnal sweep
and flow of the great river, and felt the swelling of the old,
impossible and savage joy within him. That little town, seen
first with such a charm and dream-like casualness out of the
windows of a passing train, became part of the structure of his
life, carved upon the tablets of his brain indelibly.</p>

<p>Eight times that year he saw it in every light and weather: in
blown drifts of sleeting snow, in spouting rain, in bleak and
wintry darkness, and when the first grey light of day was
breaking haggardly against its ridge of eastern hills. And its
whole design--each grimy brick and edge and corner of its shabby
pattern--became familiar to him as something he had known all his
life.</p>

<p>He came to know its times, its movements, and its people--its
station workers, railwaymen, and porters; the night-time litter
of the station derelicts and vagabonds themselves, as he was
blown past this little town in darkness.</p>

<p>And he came to know all the prowlers of the night that walk
and wait and wear the slow grey ash of time away in little
towns--and this, too, was like something he had known for ever.
He came to know them all by sight and word and name: the
taxi-drivers, luncheon-room countermen, the soiled and
weary-looking night-time Greeks, and all the others who inhabit
the great shambles of the night.</p>

<p>Finally, and as a consequence of these blind voyages, he came
to know all the prostitutes that lived there in that little row
of wooden tenements beside the tracks. Eight times, at the end of
night, he came again into the last commerce of their fagged
embrace; eight times he left those shabby shuttered little houses
in grey haggard light; and eight times that year, as morning
came, he again made the journey down the river.</p>

<p>And later he could forget none of it. It became part of a
whole design--all of its horror and its beauty, its grime and
rustiness of stark red brick, its dark and secret loneliness of
earth, the thrill and magic of his casual friendly voices, and
the fagged yet friendly commerce of the prostitutes, the haggard
light of morning at the ridges of the hills, and that great
enchanted river greening into May--all this was one and single,
woven of the same pattern, and coherent to the same design--and
that design was somehow beautiful.</p>

<p>That spring, along the noble sweep of the great river, he
returned at morning to the city many times. He saw April come,
with all its sudden patches of shrewd green, and May, with all
its bloom, its lights of flowers, its purity of first light and
the bird-song waking in young feathered trees, its joy of
morning-gold on the great river's tide.</p>

<p>Eight times that spring, after all the fury, wildness and
debauch of night, he rode back at morning towards the city in a
world of waking men: they were for the most part
railwaymen--engineers, firemen, brakesmen, switchmen, and guards,
on their way to work. And their homely, seamed and pungent
comradeship filled him with the health of morning and with
joy.</p>

<p>And his memory of these journeys of the night, and these
wonderful returns at morning, was haunted always by the vision of
a single house. It was a great white house set delicate and
gleaming in frail morning light upon a noble hill that swept back
from the river, and it was shaded by the silent stature of great
trees, and vast swards of velvet lawn swept round it, and morning
was always there and the tender purity of light.</p>

<p>That house haunted his memory like a dream: he could not
forget it. But he did not know, he could not have foreseen, by
what strange and dreamlike chance he would later come to it.</p>

<p> </p>

<h1>LIII</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Laughing, and breaking at once into the loud harsh accents of
the city, the class scrambled to its feet, and began to gather up
its books. Eugene walked rapidly to his table, which stood upon a
little platform a few inches above the floor, and stationing
himself behind it he began feverishly and untidily to stuff away
into his brief-case text-books and themes and the pile of
examination papers in which were written out the results of the
short "quiz" he had given them that night. But he knew without
looking what those results would be. Miss Feinberg would tell him
that "Christabel" had been written by "Keiths," and that "it was
sort of an epic or narrative poem of a very romantic nature such
as they had in those days." Mr. Katz would assure him that "The
Eve of St. Agnes" had been written by "Wadsworth," "and you might
say there is something very mysterious and peculiar about the
atmosphere of the poem." Mr. Harry Fishbein would explain that a
sonnet "is a kind of poetry they have, usually of a short nature.
The first part of a sonnet is called the octrave. Shakespeare
wrote some sonnets, as did also Wadsworth and Keiths!" Only
Abe--Abe alone, the merciless and relentless and unfaltering Abe,
Abe with his dull, grey, scornful face--would make no errors. As
for the others, what difference did it make? Would these garbled
renderings of what their ears had dully heard make any change for
good or ill in the garbled chaos of their lives, the glare and
fury of the streets? Would Herrick sing his sweet bird-song to
Mr. Shapiro as he roared down to work each morning in the Bronx
Express? Would Miss Feinberg think of Crashaw as she ate her
noonday cream-cheese sandwich in the drug store? Would it matter
much to Katz whether "Wadsworth" or "Keiths" had written "La
Belle Dame," so long as he "got by," so long as he "got his," so
long as he "got what was comin' to 'm"?--Eugene could not think
it. He had heard all the reasons for this folly, and the words
that had been used were very fine--"a larger vision,"--"a sense
of the larger life," and so on--but the bewilderment of these
turbulent and raucous young people was scarcely greater than his
own.</p>

<p>At the end of each class, jostling, thrusting, laughing,
shouting, and disputing, they would surge in upon him in a hot,
clamorous, and insistent swarm, and again, as Eugene backed
wearily against the wall and faced them, he had the maddening
sense of having been defeated and overcome.</p>

<p>For the weariness of flesh was like the weariness a man has
after a great burst of love with a potent and adored
mistress--the back was drawn in, half-broken, toward his
trembling, wrung, depleted loins, his limbs faltered and his
fingers shook, his breath came heavily, his body respired slowly
in a state of languorous exhaustion, but where the weariness of
triumphant love brings to a man a sense of completion, victory,
and finality, the weariness of the class brought to him only a
feeling of sterility and despair, a damnable and unresting
exacerbation and weariness of the spirit, a sense of having
yielded up and lost irrevocably into the sponge-like and
withdrawing maws of their dark, oily and insatiate hunger, their
oriental and parasitic gluttony, all of the rare and priceless
energies of creation: he thought with a weary and impotent fury
of great plans and soaring ecstasies of hope and ambition--of
poems, stories, books which once had swarmed exultantly their
cries of glory, joy, and triumph through his brain--and now all
this seemed lost and wasted, flung riotously and fruitlessly away
into the blind maw of a headless sucking mouth, a dark brainless,
obscene and insatiate hunger.</p>

<p>As he looked at them, a horrible memory returned of the great
fish which once he had caught in deep-sea water outside Boston
harbour: he could feel again the sudden heavy living tug, the
wriggling vitality, at the end of 200 feet of line, and then the
wet line slipping harshly through his fingers as exultantly he
drew the great fish upward to the surface. Then he remembered the
sense of loss and disgust and horror when he saw it: it swam
upward, wriggling heavily in a flail of heavy dying protest,
through a thickened murk of greenish water, and he saw that to
its brain was fastened some blind horror of the sea, a foul
snake-like shape a foot or more in length, a headless, brainless
mouth, a blind suck and sea-crawl, a mindless abomination, glued
implacably, fastened in fatal suck in one small rim of bloody
foam against the brain-cage of the great dying fish. How often,
in a mad fury of escape and freedom, it had lashed its brain to
bloody froth against some razored edge, some coral types upon the
swarming jungle of the sea, he did not know; but the memory of it
had returned a thousand times in abominable waking-sleeping
visions of the night to haunt him with its blind and mouthless
horror, and now he thought of it again, as they drew in on him
their sucking glut of dark insatiate desire.</p>

<p>Their dark flesh had in it the quality of a merciless tide
which not only overwhelmed and devoured but withdrew with a
powerful sucking glut all rich deposits of the earth it fed upon:
they had the absorptive quality of a sponge, the power of a
magnet, the end of each class left him sapped, gutted, drained,
and with a sense of sterility, loss, and defeat, and in addition
to this exhaustion of the mind and spirit, there was added a
terrible weariness and frustration of the flesh: the potent young
Jewesses, thick, hot, and heavy with a female odour, swarmed
around him in a sensual tide, they leaned above him as he sat
there at his table, pressing deliberately the crisp nozzles of
their melon-heavy breasts against his shoulder; slowly,
erotically, they moved their bellies in to him, or rubbed the
heavy contours of their thighs against his legs; they looked at
him with moist red lips through which their wet red tongues
lolled wickedly, and they sat upon the front rows of the class in
garments cut with too extreme a style of provocation and
indecency, staring up at him with eyes of round lewd innocence,
cocking their legs with a shameless and unwitting air, so that
they exposed the banded silken ruffle of their garters and the
ripe heavy flesh of their underlegs.</p>

<p>Thus, to all his weariness of mind, the terror and torment of
his spirit, a thousand erotic images of an aroused but baffled
and maddened sensuality were added: they swarmed around him like
the embodiment of all the frustrate hunger, desire, and fury he
had come to know in the city, with a terrible wordless evocation
of men starving in the heart of a great plantation, of men dying
of thirst within sight of a shining spring, with a damnable
mockery, a nightmare vision of proud, potent and hermetic flesh,
of voluptuous forms in hell, for ever near, for ever palpable,
but never to be known, owned, or touched.</p>

<p>The girls, the proud and potent Jewesses with their amber
flesh, schooled to a goal of marriage, skilled in all the
teasings of erotic trickery, with their lustful caution and their
hot virginity pressed in around him in a drowning sensual tide:
with looks of vacant innocence and with swift counter-glances of
dark mockery, they pressed upon him, breathing, soft and warm and
full, as they cajoled, teased, seduced with look or gesture,
questioned trivially, aggressively, uselessly--those with a body,
and no mind, intent alone upon seduction, spurred on perhaps by
some belief that promotion and reward in all the business of life
could best be got at in this way; and those with minds and bodies
both intent upon some painful mixture of sharp protest, struggle,
and seduction which made erotic musings in their soul:</p>

<p>"Oh, but I don't--ag-gree with you at aw-ull! That's not the
meaning that I saw in it, at aw-ull! I think you're being very
supe-er-fish-al. I don't ag-gree with you at aw-ull!"--the rich
voices, aggrieved, injured, hen-like and sensual, omened with
deep undernotes of ripe hysteria, rose and fell with undulant
duckings of yolky protest--the rich sensual voices of the
Jewesses receiving, giving, returning and withdrawing, rose and
fell in curved undulance of yolky hen-clucking protest, with
omens of a ripe hysteria. Receiving, clucking, and protesting
with their warm hen-feathered cries, they seemed to say, "Oh,
come and take me, break me, but I don't ag-ree with you at
aw-ull; Cluck-cluck-cluck-cluck-cluck! Oh, do, oh, don't, we
will, we won't, but we don't ag-ree with you at aw-ull!"--the
rich injured undulations of aggrieved protest, the omened menace
of impending hysteria awoke in an alien spirit a powerful surge
of desire and humour, a wave of wild choking laughter mixed with
love and lust as one listened to the sensual, aggrieved,
hen-clucking protest of their souls.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>The Jewish women were as old as nature and as round as the
earth: they had a curve in them. They had gone to the wailing
walls of death and love for seven thousand years, the strong
convulsive faces of the Jews were ripe with grief and wisdom, and
the curve of the soul of the Jewish women was still unbroken.
Female, fertile, yolky, fruitful as the earth, and ready for the
plough, they offered to the famished wanderer, the alien, the
exile, the baffled and infuriated man, escape and surcease of the
handsome barren women, the hard varnished sawdust dolls, the
arrogant and sterile women, false in look and promise as a
hot-house peach, who walked the street and had no curves or
fruitfulness in them. The Jewish women waited with rich yolky
cries for him, and the news they brought him; the wisdom that
they gave to him was that he need not strangle like a mad dog in
a barren dark, nor perish, famished, unassuaged, within the
wilderness beside a rusted lance--but that there was still good
earth for the plough to cleave and furrow, deep cellars for the
grain, a sheath for the shining sword, rich pockets of spiced
fertility for all the maddened lunges of desire.</p>

<p>They pressed around him at his table with insistent surge, and
he looked at them and saw that they were young; and sometimes
they belonged to the whole vast family of the earth: they were
like all the young people who had ever lived--they seemed clumsy
and noisy and good, full of hope and loyalty and folly; and
sometimes again, it seemed to him that none of them had ever
known youth or innocence, that they had been born with old and
weary souls, that they were born instructed in the huge dark
history of pain, the thousand mad and tortured sicknesses of the
soul, and that the only thirst and hunger that they knew, the
desire that drove them with an insatiate lust, was for sorrow,
grief, and human misery. Had they ever cried into the howling
winds at night? Had they ever felt the sharp and tongueless
ecstasy of spring or held their breath at night when great wheels
pounded at the rail, or trembled with a vast dark wave of pain, a
wordless cry of joy, when they heard ships calling at the
harbour's mouth and thought of new lands in the morning? Or had
they always been so old and wise, so full of grief and evil?</p>

<p>The girls pressed in on him their sensual wave, and the boys
stood farther off, behind them, waiting, and he saw the dark and
furtive glances of the men pass slyly, each to each, in swift
final looks of cynical communication. They waited for the women
to have done, with a kind of hard and weary patience, an old and
knowing agreement, a sense of acceptance, as if they had known
for thousands of years that their women would betray them with a
Gentile lover, and yet with a kind of triumph, as if they also
knew they would regain them and be victorious in the end.</p>

<p>They seemed to have gained from life the terrible patience,
the old and crafty skill and caution that come from long enduring
of pain: as he looked at them he knew that they would never be
wild and drunken, or beat their knuckles bloody on a wall, or lie
beaten and senseless in the stews, but he knew that with smooth
faces they would decant the bottle for some man who did, and that
they would read him quietly to his desperate fate with their
dark, mocking, and insatiate eyes. They had learned that a savage
word would break no bones and that the wound of betrayal or a
misprized love is less fatal than the stroke of the sword, the
thrust of the knife: in the years that followed he saw that
physically they were, for the most part, incorrupt, old and
cautious, filled with skill and safety--that they had lived so
long and grown so wise and crafty that their subtle,
million-noted minds could do without and hold in dark contempt
the clumsy imperfections of a fleshly evil--that they could evoke
and live completely in a world of cruel and subtle intuitions,
unphrased and unutterable intensities of cruelty, shame, and
horror, without lifting a finger or turning a hand. Thus, in
these years, as his own mind grew mad and twisted with the insane
fabrications of a poisonous jealousy--as if immediately and
without a bridge or break translated into terms of literal
physical actuality an insane picture of cruelty and horror: of
daughters who acted as procurers to their mothers, of sons and
husbands going unperturbed to sleep in houses where their
sisters, wives, and children lay quilted in the lust and evil
abominations of an adulterous love, of calm untelling faces,
looks and glances of a childlike purity, an air of goodness,
faith and morning innocence throughout, while the whole knowledge
of an unspeakable evil trembled in their hearts for ever with an
obscene and soundless laughter--these abominations of his fancy,
this vile progeny which his mad brain translated into literal
fact, were probably for the most part only images the cruel and
subtle minds of the old, wise, patient Jews had evoked and played
with in their complex fantasy; and as he looked at the swarm of
dark insistent faces round him at the table, an overwhelming
sensation of defeat and desolation drowned his spirit--their dark
looks read, and ate, and mocked at him, and yet were full of
affection and tenderness as if they loved the food they fed upon:
it seemed to him that he alone must die; that he must break his
heart and smash his bones, lie beaten, drunken, mashed and
senseless in the dives, must wreck his reason, lose his sanity,
destroy his talent, and die a mad-dog howling in the wilderness
while they--they alone--these old, wise, weary, patient,
pain-devouring subtle-minded Jews--endured.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Robert's mistress had come to town, and Robert asked Eugene to
dine with them. In spite of the fact that Robert had talked
constantly of his love for Martha, they snapped and snarled at
each other throughout the evening. They went to a restaurant on
Sixth Avenue in Greenwich Village for dinner. During the course
of the meal several people came in whom Robert knew; the moment
he saw them he would call sharply to them or jump up nervously
and go to greet them. Then he would bring them back to the table
and, in a tone of dogged and sullen intensity, introduce them to
Martha, saying: "I want you to meet my wife." Martha's face would
flush with anger and sullen rage, but she would acknowledge the
introduction and mutter a few uncordial words of greeting. As for
the people to whom he introduced her, they at first received the
news that Martha was his wife with a look of blank stupefaction,
managing, at length, to stammer: "B-b-but we didn't know you were
married, Robert! Why didn't you let someone know about it? When
did it happen?"</p>

<p>"About two weeks ago," he said brusquely, obviously getting a
fierce and sullen satisfaction from this absurd lie.</p>

<p>"Where are you living?"</p>

<p>"At the Leopold."</p>

<p>"Will you be staying there?"</p>

<p>"No, we're moving out soon."</p>

<p>"Are you going to live in New York?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he said doggedly, "we've taken an apartment. . . .
Going to move in Monday."</p>

<p>"Why, Robert!" they cried, having now recovered some fluency
of speech, "we're awfully glad to know about this." And the women
with some pretence at cordiality would turn to Martha, saying,
"You must come to see us when you've settled down," and the men
would wring Robert by the hand, slap him on the back, and dig him
in the ribs. It was obvious that Robert derived a fierce and
perverse pleasure from his stupid lie, but the girl was in a
state of smouldering rage which blazed out at him the moment his
friends had gone away. "You damn fool," she snapped, "what do you
mean by telling a lie like that?"</p>

<p>"It's not a lie," he said, "it's the truth. You're my wife in
everything but name!"</p>

<p>"You're a liar! Take that back! Don't you believe him." she
said to Eugene, "there's not a word of truth in what he says. . .
. You damned fool!" she blazed out at him. "What do you mean by
telling your friends a story like that? Don't you know they're
going to find out that you lied to them? And then," she added
bitterly, "what are they going to say about me? You never thought
of that, did you? Oh, no! You don't care if you ruin me or not!
All you think of is yourself!"</p>

<p>"I don't care," he said with a sullen fierceness, "you're my
wife and that's what I'm going to tell them all!"</p>

<p>"You're not!"</p>

<p>"I am! I'll show you if I don't!"</p>

<p>"I'm not your wife, and you needn't be so sure I ever will be!
I got married once to a sick man, and I'll think it over a good
long time, I assure you, before I get married again to a crazy
man! Now, you'd better not be too sure of yourself, Mr. Weaver!
You're not married to me yet by a long shot!"</p>

<p>A bitter quarrel broke out between them: they snarled,
snapped, sneered, and wrangled--their voices rose until people at
other tables began to look at them and listen curiously, but they
paid no attention whatever to anyone but themselves. Robert ended
the argument suddenly by pushing his chair back from the table,
sighing heavily, and saying feverishly and impatiently:</p>

<p>"All right, all right, all right! You're right! I'm wrong!
Only, for God's sake, shut up and let me have a little peace!"
Then they got into a taxi and went back to the hotel. They had a
bottle of whisky and they all went up to Robert's room,
telephoned for ice and ginger ale, and began to drink. It was a
little before midnight.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>About two o'clock that night, as they sat there, a light, odd
step, approaching briskly, came down the corridor and paused
outside Robert's door; then someone rapped lightly and sharply at
the door, and with this same movement of an odd, light and
exuberant vitality. They looked at one another with the sudden
startled look of people who feel the interruption of an intense
silence around them--for the Leopold for two hours had been
steeped in this silence of sleep, and they now experienced its
living and animate presence for the first time. A good many
sensations of guilt--all but the real one--flashed through their
minds: that they had been drinking and making more noise than
they should, and that a guest had complained to the office about
them; or that someone had discovered that Robert had a woman in
his room, and that, in the interests of hotel decorum, she was to
be commanded to leave and go to her own quarters. The rapping at
the door was repeated, more brisk and loud. They were all very
still, Robert looked at Eugene nervously, remembering, perhaps,
the sum of his past errors at the hotel and his precarious
standing there.</p>

<p>"You go see who it is," he said.</p>

<p>Eugene went to the door and opened it. A man--or rather, the
wisp, the breath, the fume of what had been a man--stood there:
it was a small figure with nothing on its skeleton of fragile
bone which was recognizable as living flesh, with only the
covering, it seemed, of a parchment-like skin so tightly drawn
over the contours of the face and head that the skull widened and
flared with an impression of enormous dome-like width and depth
above a face so wizened and shrunken that one remembered it later
only as a feverish glint of teeth, an unshaved furze of beard,
and two blazing flags of red, darkened and shadowed by the sunken
depth of the sockets of the eye, where burned a stare of an
incredible size and brilliance--that and the whispering ghost of
a voice, the final, dominant, and unforgettable impression.</p>

<p>This wraith was clothed, or rather, engulfed, in garments
which, although of good cut and quality, it seemed never to have
worn before: they swathed it round and fell away in shapeless
folds so that the body was as indecipherable among them as a
stick, and the neck emerged from a collar through which it seemed
the whole figure of the man might have slipped as easily as
through a hoop.</p>

<p>And yet the creature was burning with a savage energy which
coursed like an electric current through his withered body: it
bore him along at a light, odd step, capricious and buoyant as
the bobbing of a cork, and it foamed and bubbled in him now as he
stood impatiently rapping at the door, and it blazed in his eyes
with a corrupt and fatal glee, a mad flaming exuberance, a focal
intensity of triumph, joy, and hate.</p>

<p>He entered the room immediately as soon as Eugene opened the
door: he went in briskly at his light corky step and immediately
said briskly and jovially in his whispering thread of a voice:
"Good evening! Are we all here? Is everyone well? Did someone say
something?"--he looked round enquiringly, then, with a
disappointed air, continued: "No? I thought someone spoke. Well,
then, come in, Mr. Upshaw. Thank you, I will. Won't you sit down?
Yes, indeed!" He seated himself. "Will you have a drink? I should
be delighted"--here he took the bottle, poured a stiff shot of
whisky into a glass, and drank it at one gulp. When he had
finished, he looked round more quietly until his gaze rested with
a kind of evil temperance on his wife: "Hello, Martha," he said
casually and quietly. "How are you?" She did not answer and in a
minute he repeated, still with his evil calm but with a more
vicious intensity of tone, "Listen, you God-damned bitch! . . .
When I ask you a question, you answer. How are you?"</p>

<p>"How did you get here?" she said.</p>

<p>"Oh!--Surprised to see me, is she?--Well, I tell you, darling,
how it was. I was going to walk--I was going to walk, if
necessary--now that just shows you how anxious I was to see
you--I was going to walk the whole damned way from Denver, right
over mountains and prairies and rivers and everything--but I
didn't have to. I found a train all ready to go, darling; it was
waiting for me when I got there, so 'Why walk?' I said. When I
got to Kansas City I found an aeroplane waiting there, so I said,
'Why ride when flying's faster?' So that's the way I got here,
darling."--He paused and drank again.</p>

<p>"How did you know where to find me?" asked Martha
sullenly.</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Upshaw, lightly and gaily, "that was no trouble at
all. Where should I find you, my dear? Where did I expect to find
you? Why, right in the bedroom of my dear old pal, Mr. Robert
Weaver, of course, I knew he'd look after you. I knew he wouldn't
leave an innocent young girl like you to wander around all alone
in the city. . . . Hi, there, Robert," he said cordially, lifting
his hand in a salute of friendly greeting, as if noting Robert's
presence for the first time.</p>

<p>"How are you, boy? I'm glad to see you. You've been looking
after my wife, haven't you, Robert? You took care of her, didn't
you? I'm much obliged to you. . . . You son of a bitch," he added
quietly and slowly, and with an accent of infinite loathing.</p>

<p>No one spoke, and after gazing at his wife a moment longer
with this same air of evil quietness, he said, in a tone of mock
surprise: "Why, what's the matter? You don't look a bit glad to
see me, darling. Most men's wives would be wild about a husband
who flew across the country in an aeroplane to see them, most
women would be crazy about that."</p>

<p>"I wish," the girl said bitterly, "that you had fallen into a
river and drowned."</p>

<p>"Now, is <i>that</i> nice? Is <i>that</i> kind?" said Upshaw
in a tone of grieved reproach.</p>

<p>He turned toward Eugene and spoke to him for the first time. .
. . "Now, I leave it to you, Mr.--" he hesitated, "I didn't catch
your name, sir, but is it all right if I call you Mr.
Whipple?"</p>

<p>"Yes," Eugene said. "It's all right."</p>

<p>"Good!" he cried. "I knew it would be. The reason I say that
is I used to have a friend out in Cleveland named Charley
Whipple, who was just the same type of fellow that you
are<i>--you</i> know," he said quietly and sneeringly, "a fine
clean-cut fellow, eyes glowing with health, beautiful complexion,
broad-shouldered, both feet on the ground, good to his
mother.--Oh! he was a prince!--Just the same sort of looking
fellow you are--so you won't mind if I call you by his name, will
you? You remind me so much of him. Well, now, Mr. Whipple, I ask
you if you think it's nice for a man's wife to talk to him like
this? Is it kind? Is it fair?"</p>

<p>"She's not your wife," said Robert. "She's my wife."</p>

<p>For the first time Upshaw turned and faced his enemy squarely:
he surveyed him slowly, up and down, with eyes which burned and
glittered with their hatred. "Did you say something?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"You heard me," said Robert.</p>

<p>"Did anyone speak to you? Did anyone say anything to you?"
Upshaw whispered. He was silent a moment; then he leaned forward
slightly over the table. "Let me give you some advice," he said.
"The only pity about this is that you're not going to be able to
use it.--But I'm going to give it to you, anyway: here it
is--Don't fool with a dying man, Robert. If you're going to play
around with anyone, play around with the living, and not with the
dead. Dead men are bad people to play around with."</p>

<p>"All right! All right!" cried Robert in a hoarse, excited
tone. "That constitutes a threat! . . . Martha, Eugene. . . . I
call on you to bear witness that he threatened me! We'll just see
how that sounds in a court of law."</p>

<p>"Courts! Law!" said Upshaw; and even as he spoke they all felt
instantly how preposterous was Robert's threat and how
meaningless such terms had become for this wisp of a man.</p>

<p>"Do you think I care one good God-damn now for all the courts
and laws that ever were? . . . Do you think there has been a time
for the last two years when I gave a damn whether I lived or
died?"</p>

<p>"Except to spite Martha and me," said Robert bitterly. "You
cared about that, all right!"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Upshaw quietly. "You're right. I would have hung
on to life as long as I could gasp a breath of air into what was
left of my lung, and I would have lived on without a lung to
breathe with in order to spoil your filthy game--that was the way
I hated the two of you. You don't understand that, do you,
Robert? You don't understand a man being able to hate so hard he
can keep alive on it, he can use it instead of a lung to breathe
with, he can use it instead of air. You don't know anything about
that, do you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I do," said Robert. "I knew you hated me all along!"</p>

<p>"Hated you!" Upshaw snarled. "Why, damn you, I hated the earth
you walked upon, the air you breathed, the house you lived in,
the places you went to; I hated all the people who saw you or
spoke to you or had ever spent an hour in your company--you
polluted the atmosphere for me if I even heard the sound of your
voice."</p>

<p>"I know you did," said Robert, nodding. "What did I tell you?"
he cried to Martha, with a note of triumphant conviction.</p>

<p>"You <i>know!</i> You <i>know!"</i> cried Upshaw fiercely.
"Why, damn you, you poor cheap imitation of a contriving rascal,
you damned little drugstore Casanova, you dirty little swine of a
country-club snob, you village fortune-teller, you know nothing!
. . . For two years I stayed alive with not enough sound lung
left in me to cover the size of a silver dollar--and do you think
it was because I was afraid to die, or wanted to live? No! No!"
he whispered, and his face, or rather that eloquence of eye and
tooth, grew passionate with the bitterest disgust and loathing he
had ever seen. "I've had more than thirty years of it, and
Christ! it's been enough! I've had my bellyful of it. . . . I'm
fed up all the way to here!" he whispered, and he struck himself
fiercely at the base of the throat. He coughed, suddenly,
briefly, terribly, and with a swift impatient movement of his hot
corded fingers he snatched a towel from the rack beside the
water-basin, pressed his lowered face into it and then stared for
a moment with an expression of intent and fascinated disgust into
its folds, then he flung the bloodied rag away impatiently.</p>

<p>"You know," he said again more calmly, and for the first time
now with a touch of weariness, as if the fierce flame of this
incredible energy of passion which had thus far upheld him had
now been spent. "Why, you know nothing. It took a <i>man</i> to
hate like that," he said. . . . "--a better man than you could
ever be--yes! . . . with no more lung than a rabbit, I'm still a
better man than you could ever be, for you are nothing but a
thing without the courage even of your own rotten
convictions--</p>

<p>"God!" he looked with weary disgust from one to the other as
they sat sullen, dumbly sodden, saying nothing. "The two of you!
What a pair! . . . And to think of the time I wasted hating you .
. . to think of all the time when I might have been pushing
daisies in some quiet spot . . . keeping myself alive by thinking
of this moment." His body was shaken again by a horrible
soundless laughter. "Christ! . . . To think that I should ever
have wanted to kill either of you."</p>

<p>"To kill us!" said Robert hoarsely, not with fear but
accusingly, as if he were collecting damning evidence in a
trial.</p>

<p>"Yes," Upshaw answered with the same weary tranquillity, "to
kill you! . . . I've breathed and drunk and thought it for two
years. I've lived just for this moment. I came two thousand miles
across the continent to blow your brains out. . . ."</p>

<p>"Did you hear him?" cried Robert, jumping up from the table.
"Did you hear what he said, Martha? Did you hear him threaten
me?"</p>

<p>"Sit down!" said Upshaw quietly. "I've seen you now and I'm
satisfied. I wouldn't touch you. Why, God-damn you, you're not
worth it, either of you." Again he surveyed them with slow
loathing, and broke into his soundless laughter. "Kill you! Why,
I wouldn't do either of you so big a favour. You don't deserve
such luck! I'll let you live and rot together. . . . Take her! .
. . Take her!" he cried, more strongly, his eyes burning into
fury. "Take her! . . . But before you do"--with a swift movement
he withdrew from his pocket a small and crumpled wad of dollar
bills--"here! I want to give you something!" And he flung them
straight at Robert's face, "Take that . . . and go and get
yourself a <i>good</i> prostitute while you're at it!"</p>

<p>Robert sat perfectly still for a moment; then he got up
slowly, went over to the door, and flung it open and walked back
to the table. . . . "Get out of here," he said. Upshaw did not
move: he sat regarding him silently, with an intent,
contemptuous, catlike stare.</p>

<p>"Did you hear me?" said Robert. . . . "Get out of my
room!"</p>

<p>"Sit down," said Upshaw. "You're going to annoy me."</p>

<p>"Annoy you! I'll annoy you, you damned rascal," Robert cried
furiously, and suddenly he slapped Upshaw in the face, shouting,
"You're going out of here this minute, do you hear? . . . I'll
show you if you can insult me in my own place," and he lunged
viciously towards him.</p>

<p>What happened then was so sudden and swift that Eugene could
never thereafter remember clearly the order in which all of the
events occurred: as Robert plunged towards the little man, Martha
spoke sharply to him, commanding him to be still, at the same
moment the table and two chairs overturned with a crash of
glassware . . . and Upshaw, somehow, with an incredible speed of
movement, was on his feet and moving backward out of the way of
Robert's lunging fist. Eugene had a brief and terribly clear
sensation of a gesture of catlike speed as Upshaw thrust his hand
into the pocket of his coat and then the bright wicked wink of
steel. Then Martha was on top of him, clinging frantically to his
arm, wrestling him into the wall, and in a moment wrenching the
weapon from his grasp.</p>

<p>For a moment there was no sound in the room whatever save the
sound of three excited people breathing rapidly and heavily, and
another sound, the terrible sound of Upshaw's breathing, hoarse,
rattling, painful, breaking suddenly and sharply into a torn
gasping cough that was thick with blood. The first words spoken
came from Martha:</p>

<p>"Close that door!" she commanded curtly.</p>

<p>Robert, instead of obliging her, turned to Eugene with an awed
and quieted light in his eye.</p>

<p>"Did you see that?" he whispered to Eugene.--"Did you see him
pull that gun on me? . . . Why!" he cried with a kind of sudden
astonishment, "it was assault with a deadly weapon! That's what
it was! He tried to murder me!" He was beside himself with
astonishment and excitement. "I'm going to get the police," and
he rushed out into the hall.</p>

<p>"Go get that damned fool and bring him back here," she said to
Eugene. <i>"And close that door!"</i></p>

<p>Eugene ran out into the corridor just in time to see Robert
disappearing at his long stiff stride around the corner that led
to the lifts in the main building. When Eugene got there Robert
was pressing buttons feverishly, but unfortunately, because the
hour was so late and the lift-man was asleep below, his call had
not yet been answered. Eugene seized him by the arm and began to
pull him along back towards his room.</p>

<p>"Let go of me!" he said.</p>

<p>"You damned fool! . . . Do you want to ruin us all?"</p>

<p>He seemed to sober up and grew calmer after a moment or two of
excited prayer and protest. They went back to the room quietly
enough. When they got there Martha was supporting Upshaw's body
against the basin of the washstand. The man, by this time, was
either unconscious or semi-conscious: all the savage and unholy
energy which had burned for a space so incredibly that it had the
power to hurl this diseased and near-dead mite across a continent
had now flared utterly out and the creature which the girl
supported in her arms, with a kind of dark and sullen tenderness,
seemed to have died and dwindled with it; the body was no longer
discernible, it seemed to have faded, a fabric of rotten sticks,
into a shapeless heap of clothing; it dangled shapelessly and
grotesquely like some deflated figure, and yet from the head,
from that death's-head of skull and tooth and blazing eyes, there
were spurting unbelievable, incredible fountains of blood: it
burst simultaneously from the mouth and nostrils in a steady
torrent until his skin was laced with it; it filled the basin, it
was incredible that such fountains of bright blood should pour
out of this withered squirrel of a man.</p>

<p>Robert sat down sullenly in a chair by the table after saying,
"Now, this is your last chance. . . . I've had as much as I can
stand. You've got to decide between us here and now!" She did not
answer him, and he said no more, relapsing into a sullen and
half-drunken stupor.</p>

<p>The girl washed the blood away from Upshaw's face with a
towel: in a moment more she asked Eugene if he would help her
carry him to the bed. Eugene picked him up and put him on the
bed; his body felt like a handful of light dry sticks, he weighed
no more than a child of ten; already his figure seemed, under the
strange and terrible chemistry of death, to shrink and wither
visibly from one moment to another, but his head rested above
that shapeless and grotesque bundle of clothing as if it had been
severed from the body--with an immense austerity of line and
light, a cold, stiffening, and upthrust calm.</p>

<p>Eugene went down to the office and told them what had
happened. The night clerk, a fat, shuffling old man with a mild,
pasty face, and the black African negro who was at the
telephone-board, received the news with astonishing calmness and
matter of factness, and then acted with admirable coolness, speed
and quiet precision, of which Eugene often thought in the months
that followed, because it revealed to him a kind of secret
knowledge, a hidden seriousness in the hotel's working, and it
showed, moreover, how much knowledge, ability, and decision may
be stored behind the faces of inept and foolish-looking men.</p>

<p>Eugene looked at the clock above the office desk: it was now
ten minutes after three o'clock in the morning. Within twenty
minutes they had an ambulance, a doctor, and two
stretcher-bearers at the hotel; the doctor, a young Jew with a
little moustache, walked quietly and casually into the room, with
the ends of a stethoscope fastened in his ears. Eugene thought
that Upshaw was already dead! His face had the upthrust marble
rigidity of death, but after a moment's examination the doctor
spoke quietly to the two men with him, they put the stretcher on
the floor and laid the withered little figure on it. As they
started to move out of the room Upshaw's arms began to flop and
jerk stiffly and grotesquely with every step they took: at
another word from the doctor they put their burden on the floor
again, the doctor knelt swiftly, unknotted the cravat in Upshaw's
collar and loosely tied his wrists together. Then they all went
out, and Martha followed, holding Upshaw's hat. She rode over in
the ambulance to the hospital, which was only a few blocks away
in Fifteenth Street. Robert and Eugene followed in a taxi; there
was no one on the streets, the buildings and the pavements had
the hard, bare angularity they have early in the morning: they
waited downstairs in a little room until shortly after five
o'clock in the morning, when Martha came down to see them and to
tell them that Upshaw had just died.</p>

<p>Then Eugene left Robert and Martha there together and walked
back towards the hotel. The streets were still bare, but in the
east there was the first width of morning light, cold steel-grey,
harsh and sharply clean: day was beginning to break, and he could
hear the rumbling jingle of a milk-wagon and the sound of hoof
and wheel behind him in the lonely street.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>If the hard and rugged lineaments of Abe's character had not
at this time emerged out of the glutinous paste of obscure
yearnings, there was no such indecision and uncertainty in the
character of his mother. It was as legible as gold, as solid as a
rock.</p>

<p>Abe's mother was an old woman, with the powerful and primitive
features of the aged Jewess: she was almost toothless, a solitary
blackened tooth stood mournfully in the centre of her strong
ruined mouth; she had a craggy worn face, seamed and furrowed by
a countless sorrow, a powerful beaked nose, and a strong
convulsive mouth, a mask which was like a destiny, since it
seemed to have been carved and fashioned for the dirge-like
wailing of eternal grief. The face of the old woman might have
served not only as the painting of the whole history of her race,
but as the painting of the female everywhere--not the female with
her ephemeral youth, her brief snares of hair and hide, her
succulent burst of rose-lips and flowing curve--but the female
timeless, ageless, fixed in sorrow and fertility, as savage, as
enduring, and as fecund as the earth. The old woman's face was
like a worn rock at which all the waves of life had smashed and
beaten: it was unmistakably the face of an old Jewess and yet the
powerful and craggy features bore an astonishing resemblance to
the face of a pioneer woman or of an old Indian chief.</p>

<p>Her life, moreover, had the agelessness of the earth, the
timelessness of her race and destiny: she had not been touched at
all by the furious and savage life of the city with its
sensational brevities, its hard, special, temporal qualities of
speech, fashion, and belief, its million ephemeral enthusiasms,
briefly held and forgotten, the stunned oblivion of its memory,
which, in the brutal stupefaction of a thousand days, can hold to
nothing, so that even the memory of love and death cannot endure
there and a man may forget his dead brother ere his flesh grow
rotten in the grave.</p>

<p>The old woman did not forget: for her, as for the God she
worshipped, the passing of seven thousand years was like the
passing of a single day; yesterday, tomorrow, and for ever, a
moment at the heart of love and memory. Thus, once when Eugene
had called Abe upon the telephone, a full year after the death of
his oldest brother, Jacob, the old woman had answered: the old
voice came feebly, brokenly, indecipherably, and was like a wail.
He asked for Abe, she could not understand, she began to talk in
an excited, toothless mumble--a torrent of Yiddish broken here
and there by a few mangled words and scraps of English--all she
knew. At length Eugene made her understand he wanted to speak to
Abe: suddenly she recognized his voice and remembered him. Then,
instantly, as if it had happened only the day before and as if he
had been a friend of her dead son, although he had never known
him, the old woman began to wail, faintly and rhythmically,
across the wire: "Jakie! . . . My Jakie! . . . Mein Sohn Jakie! .
. . He is dead."</p>

<p>A few days later Eugene had gone home with Abe for dinner: he
lived with his mother, two brothers, and Jimmy, his sister's
illegitimate child, in a flat which occupied the second floor of
an old four-storey red-brick house in Twelfth Street, near Second
Avenue, on the East Side. The old woman had prepared a good meal
for them: a thick rich soup, chopped chicken livers, chicken,
cake, and a strong sweet wine: she served them but would not sit
and eat with them: she came in briefly and shook hands shyly and
awkwardly, mumbling incoherently a mangled jargon of Yiddish and
English. Suddenly, however, as if she had briefly mastered
herself by a strong effort, her old and sorrowful face was
twisted by a convulsion of powerful and incurable grief, and a
long, terrible, savagely wailing cry was torn from her throat:
she turned blindly, and with a movement of natural and primitive
sorrow, she suddenly seized the edges of her apron in her gnarled
and worn hands and flung it up over her head and rushed toward
the door at a blind, lunging, reeling step. She was like one
demented by sorrow: the old woman began to beat her withered
breasts and pull at her wispy grey hair, meanwhile running and
stumbling blindly round her kitchen in a horrible and savage
dementia and drunkenness of grief. Abe followed her out, and
Eugene could hear his voice, low, urgent, and tender, as he spoke
to her persuasively in Yiddish, and her long wailing cries
subsided and he returned. His face was sad and weary-looking and
in a moment he said: "Mama's breaking up fast. She's never been
able to get over my brother's death. She thinks about it all the
time: she can't get it off her mind."</p>

<p>"How long has he been dead, Abe?"</p>

<p>"He died over a year ago," Abe said. "But that doesn't matter:
I know her--she'll never forget it now as long as she lives.
She'll always feel the same about it."</p>

<p>This terrible and savage picture of grief was carved upon
Eugene's memory unforgettably: it became a tremendous and
formidable fact, a fact as ancient, timeless, and savage as the
earth, a fact which neither the stupefying oblivion of the city's
life, the furious chaos of the streets, nor the savage glare of
ten thousand blind and dusty days could touch. The old woman's
grief was taller than their tallest towers, and more enduring
than all their steel and stone: it would last for ever when all
the city's bones were dust, and it was like the grief of all the
women who had ever beat their breasts and flung their aprons
across their heads and run, wailing, with a demented and drunken
step: it filled him with horror, anger, a sense of cruelty,
disgust, and pity.</p>

<p>She was the fertile and enduring earth from which they sprang,
and all of them, transformed so sharply and so curiously by the
city's tone and life, drew in to her with devotion and respect:
Abe, with his dreary grey face of the man-swarm cipher; Sylvia,
with her feverish, electric night-time glitter; all of the
brothers and sisters, with all that was new, sharp, alien,
flashy, trivial, or material in speech, dress, manner, and
belief--all of them returned to her with love, loyalty, and
reverence as to some great brood-hen of the earth. The old
woman's life was rooted in the soil of two devotions: the
synagogue and the home, and all that happened beyond the limits
of this devotion was phantom and remote: this soil was ageless,
placeless, everlasting.</p>

<p>Abe loved his mother dearly: whenever he spoke of her, even
casually, his voice was touched with a hush of respect and
affection. But he disliked his father: the few times Eugene heard
him mention him he spoke of him in a hard and bitter voice,
referring to him as "that guy" or "that fellow," as if he were a
stranger. Eugene never saw the father: the children all felt
bitterly towards him and had sent him away to live alone. Abe
told Eugene that the man was a shoemaker, and apparently
improvident and thriftless. He had never been able to earn enough
to support his family, and in addition, Abe said, he was a petty
family tyrant. Abe's childhood had been scarred by memories of
privation, tyranny and poverty--the mother and the children had
had a bitter struggle for existence, and Abe had worked since his
eighth year at a variety of hard, grey, shabby and joyless
employments: he had been a newsboy, a grocer's delivery boy, an
office boy in a broker's office, a typist in a collection agency
endlessly writing out form letters, the office man and secretary
for the head-professor of the architectural school, and one of
these pallid, swarthy, greasily sweating youths of the fur and
garment house districts who ceaselessly propel through swarming
and kaleidoscopic streets of trade small wheel-trucks piled high
with dresses, garments, furs, and clothes or with the thousand
travelling varieties of all that horrible nondescript junk known
under the indecisive name of "novelties." Once, also, he had
spent part of a summer in New Jersey unloading freight cars
filled with Georgia water-melons, and for a considerable time he
had driven a truck for his two oldest brothers, who had a zinc
business in the "gas-house district" of the East Side, between
Avenue A and the river and North of Fourteenth Street.</p>

<p>Here, once, Eugene had accompanied him at noon of a flashing
day in spring, a glitter of light and flashing waters, a sparkle
of gold and blue: in a large bare space near factories they had
seen a ring of young thugs throwing dice, and near the river were
the immense and ugly turrets of the gas tanks, and then the
wharves, the great odorous piers, and the flashing waters--the
vast exultant play and traffic of the river life, the powerful
little tugs, the ships, and the barges laden with their strings
of rusty freight cars.</p>

<p>As they walked away through the powerful ugliness and
devastation of that district, with its wasteland rusts and
rubbish, its slum-like streets of rickety tenement and shabby
brick, its vast raw thrust of tank, glazed glass and factory
building, and at length its clean, cold, flashing strength and
joy of waters--a district scarred by that horror of unutterable
desolation and ugliness and at the same time lifted by a powerful
rude exultancy of light and sky and sweep and water, such as is
found only in America, and for which there is yet no language--as
they walked away along a street, the blue wicked shells of empty
bottles began to explode on the pavements all round them: when
they looked round to see from what quarter this attack was
coming, the street was empty save for a young thug who leaned
against the rotting edge of a closed door, hands thrust in
pockets, and a look of pustulate and evil innocence upon his thin
tough Irish face. The street was evil and silent and empty, but
when they turned and went on again, the exploding bottles began
to drop around them on the pavement in splinters of sinister
blue.</p>

<p>Abe grinned toughly: he did not seem at all surprised or
perturbed by the murderous stealth and secrecy of the attack, its
obscene and cowardly uselessness. He explained that the district
had been one of the worst in the city and the headquarters for
one of the most criminal gangs: time and again the gangsters had
broken into his brother's zinc shop and robbed it, and Abe and
all his brothers, being Jews, had had to fight it out since
childhood, foot and fist and tooth and nail, and club and stone,
with the young Irish toughs and gangsters who infested the
district. Such had been his childhood: he told Eugene many
stories of bloody fights waged back and forth across these
pavements, of young boys maimed, crippled, or blinded in these
savage fights, of one boy who had his eye torn out of his head by
his enemy's gouging thumb in a fight to a finish on one of the
piers, and of another whose brains had been smashed out on the
pavement below the elevated structure by a rock hurled by an
enemy's hand in a fight of the neighbourhood gangs. Thus, in pier
and alley, on street and roof, children had learned the arts of
murder, the smell of blood, the odour of brains upon the
pavement. Abe told how one of his older brothers, Barney--a
thickly set, powerful-looking man with short thick hands and a
tough meaty-looking fighter's face, grey, square, and
good-humoured--had to fight it out step by step with the
gangsters, who had come to his shop, again and again, with
demands for money--money which the merchants of the district paid
them meekly and regularly for "protection"--a euphemism for graft
and menace, a bribe for being left alone and for the assurance
that one's shop would not be entered and one's stock smashed or
stolen in the night. Barney had met all these menaces with a hard
cold eye and two rock-like fists with which time and again he had
beaten into a pulp the thugs who came to threaten him: he was a
good man and a savage fighter and he had learned the arts of
combat in the sternest and most brutal arena on earth--the city
streets.</p>

<p>"And--oh-ho-ho-ho!"--softly, painfully, Abe lifted his widely
grinning face and laughed, "how that guy loves it! Say! they
picked the wrong one when they picked on him! Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho!
<i>Can</i> he fight! <i>Does</i> he love it! Say! do you know
what I saw him do to two of them one time--oh-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!
Gee! it was rich! They came in there to shake him down and--Oh!
Ho-ho!--ho! You shoulda seen it! He picks up a keg of zinc that
weighs 200 pounds and he <i>breaks</i> it--oh-ho-ho-ho!--over the
first guy's head."</p>

<p>"And what became of the second guy?"</p>

<p>"Oh-ho-ho-ho! . . . Gee it was rich! You shoulda seen that
other guy get out of there! Say! He almost tore the door down in
his hurry--oh-ho-ho-ho!"</p>

<p>Such were the various members of this family as Eugene came to
know about them: each of them in his own way was marked by a
decisive individuality and independence of spirit which told of
their lives of combat, toil and struggle in the city streets, and
yet, although indelibly marked, scarred and hardened by his life,
none of them had been brutalized by it. In fact, as Eugene
thought of all these people later, an extraordinary quality in
them became evident. It was this: here was a family of poor East
Side Jews, the children of an immigrant and thriftless shoemaker
and an old orthodox Jewish woman. These children had all had to
make their own way, to fight and struggle bitterly for a living:
now some of them were tough, rugged and unlettered merchants,
traders and mechanics, some were successful milliners and
designers, and some were talented musicians, students of science,
people of extraordinary intelligence and ability. And all of
them, even the most unlettered, seemed to have a completely
natural unaffected interest and respect for the arts or for
scholarly and intellectual attainment. This circumstance--this
remarkable fusion in one poor Jewish family of elements which
would have seemed almost incredible in the families of poor
labouring or country people Eugene had known before--this
combination of the manual, the commercial, the artistic and the
scholarly in one poor family--seemed so natural both to him and
to them that Eugene never found it strange or wonderful until
years later.</p>

<h1>LVI</h1>

<p> </p>

<p>June had brought with it a blessed respite from his classes at
the university. Now the summer drew on towards its close--the
brutal and weary New York summer with its swelter of dead wet
heats, its death of hope, its sorrow of a timeless memory. And
yet, in the city's summer nights there was a kind of solemn joy,
a hush of peace and light and human resignation that was so
different from the wild and nameless joy and pain of spring, the
sorrow of autumn, the winter's grim and stern protraction of the
soul. <i>Then</i>--in these nights of waning summer--more than at
any other season of the year, the immense and murmurous sound of
time was audible. It was above one and around one, it was near
and far, it was immense and omnipresent, and it was indefinable.
It seemed to hover somewhere in the upper air, above the city's
steep canyons, the giant explosions of her thousand towers, the
swarming millions of her tortured and uneasy life for ever waging
their desperate, ugly and unprofitable strife in all her hot and
tangled mazes. And that voice of time, above the ugly clamour of
that tormented life, was imperturbable; immense, remote and
murmurous, it seemed to have resumed into itself all of the
rumours of the earth, and to comprise, out of the bitter
briefness of man's days, the essence of his own eternity, and to
be itself eternal, fixed, and everlasting, no matter what men
lived or died.</p>

<p>The people of the city heard this sound of time, and on these
evenings of the waning summer their lives were subject to its
spell. For the first time in many months one heard the sounds of
quiet laughter in the streets at night, the voices of the people
as they passed were strangely hushed, the sounds of life were
immense, all murmurous as time itself.</p>

<p>This sense of peace, of resignation, of a quiet and tranquil
sorrow and joy was everywhere; it may have been some quality of
the summer air that imposed on all the violence of the city's
life a kind of muted harmony, but the spirit of this peace seemed
to have entered the very flesh and spirit of the city, somehow to
have tranquillized the feverish blood and nervous and exacerbated
bodies of its people. For the first time in months their eyes
were quiet and thoughtful and had lost their look of hatred and
suspicion, hostility and mistrust. Their faces had lost their
strained, hard, and hurried look, even their tongues had lost
some of their strident, rasping, and abusive violence.</p>

<p>That immense and murmurous hush of time and sorrowful
acceptance had touched even the life of youth. At night one still
saw groups of young men walking through the streets, but even
they had somehow been subdued and chastened by this spell of
time. And in these bands of youth--these straggling bands of
young men who struggle through the city streets at night in
groups of six or eight, and who have become so much a part of our
familiar experience and the city's life that they no longer seem
curious to us--the change that this great spell of time had
wrought was perhaps more evident than anywhere else.</p>

<p>Where were the songs of youth upon those city streets? Where
the laughter, the wild spontaneous mirth, the passion, warmth and
golden poetry of youth? Where was the great boy Jason looking for
brothers in the fellowship of that inspired adventure of man's
youth--the proud, deathless image of what all of us desire when
young: where was it? Where were the noble thoughts and ardours of
young men, the fierce and bitter desperation and the proud and
foolish hopes, the grand dreams and the music of the fleeting and
impossible reveries--all that makes youth lovely and desirable,
and that keeps man's faith--where was it among these young men on
the city streets?</p>

<p>It was not there. Poor sallow, dark, swarthy creatures that
they were, with rasping tongues, loose mouths and ugly jeering
eyes, this infamous band of youth was death-in-life itself. It
had been brought still-born from its mother's womb into a world
of city streets and corners, into all the waning violence of the
tenement, bitterly to try to root its meagre life into the
rootless rock, meagrely to struggle in its infamous small phlegm
along the pavements, feebly to imitate the feeble objects of its
base idolatry--of which the most heroic was a gangster, the most
sagacious was a pimp, the most witty was some Broadway clown.</p>

<p>How often, have we seen them, heard them, turned away from
them with weariness and disgust, as they straggled along at
night, a meagre shirt-sleeved band of gangling sizes, each
fearful and uneasy in the other's eye, kicking the ash-cans over
as feats of derring-do, trying for approbation with a hoarse call
and a pitiable and mirthless striving after repartee, of which
the more glittering fragments ran like this:</p>

<p>"Hey-y . . . Eddy! . . . Holy Jeez! . . . Hey-y, youse guys! .
. . Cuh-mahn!"</p>

<p>"Ah-h, what's yer hurry? . . . Hey-y! Youse udah guys! . . .
Joe's in a hurry . . . Who's goin' t' pay duh taxi-ride?"</p>

<p>"Holy <i>Jeez!</i> What's keepin' yuh! . . . Youse guys,
cuh-mahn!"</p>

<p>"Ah-h, guh-wahn. . . . What's t' hurry? Where's duh fire?"</p>

<p>Now in these nights of waning summer, even these raucous
voices, the pitiable sterility of these feeble jests, that meagre
and constricted speech consisting almost wholly of a few harsh
cries and raucous imprecations that recurred intolerably,
incredibly through all the repercussions of an idiotic
monotony--all of the rootless, fearful, and horrible desolation
of these young pavement lives--was somehow caught up in this
great and tragic hush and spell of time, transmuted by it, until
even their vast unloveliness of youth was given a sorrowful
quality of pity and regret.</p>

<p>August came, and with it already a faint and troubling
premonition of the autumn--a breath, a fragrance, and an
odour--that somehow spoke of summer's ending, the premonitory
thrill and promise of the voyage. What was it? It was one of
those very strange and troubling odours known here in America, of
which our lives are all compact, which we have lived and breathed
and known with our blood, and for which we have no language. It
is, somehow--the odour of cities, cities, cities--at the hour of
evening, the scorched end of every expiring day--the smell of
evening hush and peace and of the sea in harbours. It is the
smell of old worn woods, warm, resinous, sultry, getting into our
very entrails somehow with its strange and nameless fragrance of
sorrow and delight; the smell of the wooden baseball bleachers,
of the old worn plankings of an amusement park, passed over by a
million feet since morning; and it is the smell of street-cars,
car-barns, the faded day-coach plush of trains, the smell of
bridges and of old wharves and piers, of hot tarred roofing, and
of tar out in the streets, of summer's fatigue, quietness, and
summer's ending, the quiet and tranquil sorrow of memory as we
remember youth, our father's voice upon the nighttime summer
porch, the smell of the grape-vines and the ripened grapes, the
grinding screech and halt of a street-car on the hill above our
father's house, and the knowledge that all this is lost, our
father dead, our childhood gone, another year, our first in the
great man-swarm of the city, ended--and this, the knowledge of
the bitter briefness of out days, is somehow mixed with the smell
of the sea in harbours, the freshening breeze of evening, the
call of ships, and, somehow, God knows how, with the intolerable
thrill and promise of the unknown voyage.</p>

<p>And with this breath of autumn and the promise of the voyage
there came to Eugene the news that Starwick was at that moment in
the city--would stop there briefly on his way to Europe. At this
time, also, Joel Pierce turned up and Eugene renewed an
acquaintance that had begun in Cambridge and lapsed during the
interim.</p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h1>LVII</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>He had never met any of Joel Pierce's family, but one night
towards seven o'clock when he had just returned to his room from
the university, Joel telephoned him, and, saying that his father
was in town, asked him if he would go to dinner and to the
theatre with them. He found Joel and his father waiting for him
in the lobby. Mr. Pierce was a man of fifty years, comfortably
dressed for the hot weather in a black mohair suit, and with a
kind of stately yet spacious dignity of linen that was agreeably
old-fashioned and that evoked a picture of an older and more
leisurely generation. He was quite deaf--so deaf, in fact, that
he made use of a small ear-phone--but his speech and manners,
like his dress, were easy, friendly, and yet touched with an air
of distinguished authority.</p>

<p>He took the two boys to the Lafayette for dinner, and ordered
generously and with the easy and comforting assurance of a man of
the world who gives everyone around him a happy feeling of
security and well-being. For Eugene, it was a memorable
experience.</p>

<p>The fine restaurant--it was perhaps the finest he had yet
seen--the French waiters, the delicious food, the beautiful
women, the well-dressed, prosperous and worldly-looking men and
the pleasant weary languor of fading day, the huge nameless
thrill and prophecy of oncoming night touched him with a feeling
of joy and nameless anticipation. He felt, as he had never felt
before, that strange, seductive promise which the city has at
evening, at the end of a day of terrible summer's heat, and which
is so strangely mixed of sorrow and delight, of desolation and
the promise of a wild and nameless joy.</p>

<p>And suddenly, all the horror, heat and desolation of the day
were forgotten. He forgot the blind horror of the man-swarm
thrusting through the mazes of the furious streets. He forgot the
drowning flood of humid flesh, the pale, wet, suffering faces
that thrust from nowhere out of sweltering heat, that were
engulfed again into the heat-hazed distances of swarming streets
in which man's life seemed more uncountable than the sands of the
sea, and more blind, lost and horribly forsaken than the lives of
those eyeless crawls and gropes that scuttle blindly and for ever
through murky ooze upon the sea's vast floor.</p>

<p>The old red light of evening filled his heart again with its
wild prophecy, its huge and secret joy, and the great stride of
oncoming night revived again, in all their magic, his childhood
dreams of the enchanted city, the city of great men and glorious
women, the city of unceasing joy, of power, triumph and success,
and of the fortunate, good, and happy life.</p>

<p>As Mr. Pierce sat there with his air of quiet and urbane
authority, studying the menu with a little frowning smile through
the lenses of a pince-nez that dangled fashionably and casually
from a black silk cord when he was not using it, the boy felt an
indescribable sense of wealth and power and prosperous ease. It
seemed to him that everything in the world was his for the
asking, and the suave service of the waiter, hovering over Mr.
Pierce with poised pencil and an attitude of devoted respect, the
rich designs of snowy linen, the heavy silver, the thick carpets,
the handsome women and distinguished-looking men, all added to
this feeling of wealth and happiness.</p>

<p>Mr. Pierce kept studying the menu with an air of good-natured
seriousness, quizzing his son from time to time with gruff but
genial banter:</p>

<p>"Joel," he would say, "what do you want? Have you any
preference of your own or will you leave it to me to decide?"</p>

<p>"Gosh!" Joel answered in his soft, eager tone. "I don't care,
Pups. Whatever you say goes with me! You know, it's all the same
to me, anyway. I can eat anything you order. Only," he added
laughing, "I'd prefer it if there's no meat. I'd like it much
better if you ordered vegetables."</p>

<p>Mr. Pierce knocked the pince-nez from his nose, and turning to
Eugene with an air of agreeable confidence, said:</p>

<p>"What's wrong with a boy who takes no more interest in his
food than that? Can you make it out? It strikes me as the most
astonishing thing," he went on in a gruff, distinguished way, "to
see a healthy young man who has no interest in his belly. Really
Joel," he went on, turning to his son and regarding him with a
kind of quizzical but good-humoured sarcasm, "I'd feel so much
better about you if you only liked food more. It's really tragic
to see a boy of your age deliberately throwing away one of the
greatest pleasures in life. Don't you think so?" he demanded,
turning to the other boy again with his air of friendly
confidence. "Or have you turned vegetarian, too?"</p>

<p>"Gosh, no!" Joel said, laughing his hushed eager, immensely
agreeable laugh. "He'll agree with every word you say, Pups. He
likes food even more than you do."</p>

<p>"Then I'm glad to hear it!" said Mr. Pierce approvingly. "I
had begun to fear that this younger generation had gone utterly
to hell. But if the symptoms are only local--" he frowned
humorously at his son for a moment--"perhaps it's not as bad as I
thought."</p>

<p>"You and Pups should get along together beautifully," said
Joel to Eugene. "He loves to eat--he's a wonderful cook--you
should come up to Rhinekill sometime and let him cook one of his
meals for you."</p>

<p>The ordering of the meal proceeded in this agreeable fashion.
Mr. Pierce ordered liberally: small pink-fleshed clams, cold,
pungent and exciting in their perfect shells, a thick pea soup
with little squares of toast-crust floating in it, young chicken,
plump and tender, grilled so succulently that it seemed to melt
away the moment that one put it in his mouth, asparagus and
potatoes, and a salad of crisp lettuce, beautifully mixed,
"fatigued," in a big salad bowl, iced coffee, and a dessert of
ripe Camembert and salted crackers. Mr. Pierce and Eugene ate
heartily and with obvious relish, but Joel, in spite of all their
protests and his father's bantering ridicule, which he took with
the beautiful laughing good-nature which was one of the finest
traits of his character, stuck to his vegetable diet with the
gentle doggedness that was also characteristic of him.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Later, when they had finished dinner, they drove uptown in a
taxi-cab and went to one of the summer musical shows near
Broadway, where an English revue was appearing. The comic
actress, Beatrice Lillie, was the star of the performance. Eugene
had never heard of her before, but it was evident from the
fashionable and "smart" look of the audience, and the way in
which Joel and other people greeted every word and gesture, that
the actress was "all the rage," one of those persons who, in
addition to their native talent, have some special quality that
for a time makes them the darling of the cult-adepts of the world
of fashion.</p>

<p>The revue was a clever and amusing one, but it also had a
stylish quality of fashionable smartness that was more and more
beginning to mark the productions of the theatre and the
responses of the audience. Thus, in later years, when one had
almost completely forgotten the scenes of the revue and its songs
and jokes, one could still remember it for the brilliant picture
of the life it evoked. And the image of that life was implied
rather than portrayed. The revue was one of those productions
which people were beginning to "wear" as they "wore" books or
plays or a dress: people went to the revue more because it was
"the thing to do," the thing that everyone was talking about,
than because they had a genuine desire to go, more because they
had been told that it was "amusing" than from any deep conviction
that they would find it so.</p>

<p>Thus, not only in the jokes and songs and scenes of the revue,
but in the laughter and applause with which the fashionable
audience greeted them, there was a quality that was somewhat
strained and metallic--a new and disagreeable mirth that was
coming into man's life, which seemed to have its sources not in
the warm human earth and blood of humour, but to proceed from
something sterile, sour and acrid in his soul. In this hard and
essentially lifeless merriment there was evident the desire to
wound and mock and injure. And this desire came more from fear, a
need to divert attention from one's own nakedness and insecurity
by an attack upon a common target, than from any real cruelty or
scornful hardihood of the soul.</p>

<p>This fear and insecurity were evident even in the fashionable
and sophisticated audience which had come to this theatre to see
the smart revue. In the interval between the acts, the people
streamed up the gangways and out into the lobby, and everywhere
one looked, the hostile fear and insecurity of the people were
apparent. For the most part the audience was fashionably dressed,
the men in evening dress, the women in expensive evening gowns,
that revealed their long white arms, the velvet perfection of
their breasts and long backs. It would have been difficult to
find a more assured, sophisticated and wealthy-looking group of
people, but in spite of this air of complete worldly assurance,
their unhappiness and fear were painfully evident. Their bodies
seemed to throw off and to fill the air with a feverish electric
tension, the texture of their thousand voices rising all together
in a braided clamour was almost hysterically high, and
remembering suddenly the quiet murmurous drone of voices in a
theatre twenty years before, the glamorous spell of enchantment
and happiness that surrounded even the performances of some
travelling company in its one-night appearance in a little town,
one felt poignantly again that something old and pleasant had
gone out of life, that something dissonant, painful and
unwholesome had changed man's rhythm, spread a poisonous
infection through the human chemistries.</p>

<p>One also saw, or rather powerfully felt, among these
fashionable and worldly-looking men of the great city, something
jaded, puny, sterile, horribly weary; a quality as if their vital
energies had been depleted in an unnatural way, as if they were
emptied out, dried up, sapped of their juice, and could keep
going now only by a kind of lifeless dynamism, a dry electric
energy which paced them to the tempo of the city's furious life,
which would not let them go until it had burned them hollow to a
dry grey shell.</p>

<p>By contrast, the vivid loveliness of the women was
astonishing. The differences that distinguished these women from
these men, in colouring, in the velvety texture of the skin, in
the sparkling eyes, red mouths, voluptuously seductive bodies and
general healthiness and glowing elasticity of figure, were so
great that one was reminded of those insect species whose females
are wonderfully and fatally superior in strength and beauty to
their drab mates, and who finally devour them. And yet, even in
the faces and figures of these lovely women, the mutilation of
that hard, metallic, blunted-out stamp was also evident: one
noticed that the general quality of the tone of all these mixed
and intermingled voices was feminine rather than masculine, and
that the feminine voice was even more assertive, arrogant and
incisive in its naked penetration than the voices of the men.</p>

<p>In fact, even as the two young men stood in one corner of the
lobby, surveying the keyed pulsations of this brilliant scene, a
woman's voice could be heard, speaking with an arrogant and
dogmatic assertiveness that instantly quenched denial and left no
room for disagreement, however mild:</p>

<p><i>"Yes!</i> I think she is <i>very</i> charming, and
<i>very</i> clever, and <i>terribly, terribly</i> amusing. The
dancing is <i>very</i> bad; they simply <i>don't know how</i> to
train a chorus. As for the songs, I thought that one she sings
about Queen Mary's hats was <i>awfully</i> funny; the rest are
only fair. Of course, the decor is <i>abominable</i>--but what
can you expect? That man who sings the song with her is rather
good--the other one, the awful little Cockney thing, is <i>simply
horrible!</i> Where do they ever find these people, anyway? . . .
No! No!" she said harshly and arrogantly at this point as one of
the men put in a mild, low-voiced, and apologetic interjection of
his own, "I do <i>not</i> agree with you! I <i>absolutely</i> do
<i>not</i> agree with you: you are <i>absolutely</i> wrong! The
nursemaid scene is <i>decidedly</i> the best thing in the show!
The restaurant scene is <i>very</i> dull, and <i>very</i> cheap,
and <i>terribly, terribly</i> vulgar! And it is <i>very</i>
stupid of you not to see it!"--And having delivered herself with
womanly modesty of these tolerant and generous observations, the
lady turned, saw Joel, and instantly addressed him, speaking to
him in the same arrogant and assertive tones she had used before,
and blurting her words out through lips that she kept perfectly
straight and that scarcely seemed to move or open as she
spoke.</p>

<p><i>"Joel!"</i> she cried. "What on earth are you doing here? .
. . I thought you were at Rhinekill or in Maine? . . . And
where's your mother? . . . Did she come down too? . . . No? Too
bad!" she said harshly. "I want <i>very</i> much to see her. . .
. Yes, I shall be in Newport the week-end after next. . . . Yes,
yes," she went on with metallic harshness, "--with Alice
Mortimer. . . . Is she going, too? . . . Good; then I shall see
her!--My <i>God,</i> no! . . . We're not staying here. . . . We
motored in to see the show. . . . No, no. . . . I've been staying
at Sands Point. . . . Jerry's at Southampton. . . . But
<i>God,</i> no! . . . A whole summer in this hell-hole! . . . The
man's <i>mad! . . .</i> How d'ya do?" she said curtly and
harshly, throwing a cold look and a curt nod towards Eugene as
Joel whispered at his name, and instantly dismissing him. . . .
"But do you seriously mean you're going to spend the whole summer
here? . . . Not <i>really! . . .</i> But, my dear child, what in
heaven's name ever prompted you to do an idiotic thing like that?
. . . Oh! I see!" she said coldly. "Painting, eh . . ."</p>

<p>But now the bell for the curtain sounded, and after a few
conventional words of parting they returned to their seats.</p>

<h1>LVIII</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>The Hudson River joins the harbour. And then the harbour joins
the sea. Always the rivers run.</p>

<p>The Hudson River drinks from out the inland slowly; it is like
vats that well with purple and rich wine. The Hudson River is
like purple depths of evening; it is like the flames of colour on
the Palisades, elves' echoes and old Dutch and Hallowe'en. It is
like the Phantom Horseman, the tossed boughs, and the demented
winds, and it is like the headed cider and great fires of the
Dutchmen in the winter time.</p>

<p>The Hudson River is like old October and tawny Indians in
their camping places long ago; it is like long pipes and old
tobacco; it is like cool depths and opulence; it is like the
shimmer of liquid green on summer days.</p>

<p>The Hudson River takes the thunder of fast trains and throws a
handful of lost echoes at the hills. It is like the calls of lost
men in the mountains; and it is like the country boy who is
coming to the city with a feeling of glory in him. It is like the
green plush smell of the Pullman cars and snowy linen; it is like
the kid in upper four and the good-looking woman down below who
stirs her legs slowly in starched sheets: it is the magic river.
It is like coming to the city to make money, to find glory, fame
and love, and a life more fortunate and happy than any we have
ever known. It is like the Knickerbockers and early autumn; it is
like the Rich Folks, and the River People, the Vanderbilts, the
Astors, and the Roosevelts; it is like Robert W. Chambers and the
Society Folks; it is like the younger set and Hilary, and Monica,
and Garth; it is like The Story Thus Far:</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The lovely Monica Delavere the beautiful but spoiled daughter
of one of the richest men in the world meets at a party given at
her father's Mount Kisco estate in honour of her approaching
marriage to a young architect Hilary Chedester his friend Garth
Montgomery a young artist just returned from years of study
abroad fascinated yet repelled by his dark passionate face and
his slender hands with the longer tapering fingers of the artist
and goaded by something enigmatic and mocking in his eyes in a
moment of mad recklessness spurred on by a twinge of jealousy at
the undue attention which she thinks Hilary is bestowing on Rita
Daventry an old flame she accepts a challenge from Garth to go
for a mad dash across the night in his speedster their objective
being his hunting lodge in the hills and a return before dawn
arrived at the lodge however Garth coolly announces that his car
is out of petrol and that he must phone for assistance to the
nearest town somewhat disturbed and reflecting for the first time
now on the possible scandal her reckless exploit may cause she
enters the lodge now go on with the story:</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>"Monica's red lips curved in a smile of mocking reproof. She
made a <i>moue.</i></p>

<p>"'Hardly a place I should have chosen to spend the evening, my
dear man,' she said. 'But then, perhaps it is the latest Paris
fashion to take ladies to deserted places and inform them you are
stranded. <i>C'est comme &ccedil;a &agrave; Paris,
hein?'"</i></p>

<p>Yes, all these things were like the Hudson River.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>And above all else, the Hudson River was like the light--oh,
more than anything it was the light, the light, the tone, the
texture of the magic light in which he had seen the city as a
child, that made the Hudson River wonderful.</p>

<p>The light was golden, deep and full with all rich golden
lights of harvest; the light was golden like the flesh of women,
lavish as their limbs, true, depthless, tender as their glorious
eyes, fine-spun and maddening as their hair, as unutterable with
desire as their fragrant nests of spicery, their deep melon-heavy
breasts. The light was golden like a golden morning light that
shines through ancient glass into a room of old dark brown. The
light was brown, dark lavish brown hued with rich lights of gold;
the light was rich brown shot with gold like the sultry and
exultant fragrance of ground coffee; the light was lavish brown
like old stone houses gulched in morning on a city street, brown
like exultant breakfast smells that come from basement areas in
the brownstone houses where the rich men lived; the light was
blue, steep frontal blue, like morning underneath the frontal
cliff of buildings, the light was vertical cool blue, hazed with
thin morning mist, the light was blue, cold flowing harbour blue
of clean cool waters rimed brightly with a dancing morning gold,
fresh, half-rotten with the musty river stench, blue with the
blue-black of the morning gulch and canyon of the city,
blue-black with cool morning shadow as the ferry packed with its
thousand small white staring faces turned one way, drove bluntly
toward the rusty weathered slips.</p>

<p>The light was amber-brown in vast dark chambers shuttered from
young light where in great walnut beds the glorious women stirred
in sensual warmth their lavish limbs. The light was brown-gold
like ground coffee, merchants and the walnut houses where they
lived, brown-gold like old brick buildings grimed with money and
the smell of trade, brown-gold like morning in great gleaming
bars of swart mahogany, the fresh wet beer-wash, lemon-rind and
the smell of angostura bitters. Then full golden in the evening
in the theatres, shining with full golden warmth and body on full
golden figures of the women, on fat, red plush, and on rich,
faded, slightly stale smell, and on the gilt sheaves and cupids
and the cornucopias, on the fleshly, potent softly-golden smell
of all the people; and in great restaurants the light was
brighter gold, but full and round like warm onyx columns, smooth
warmly tinted marble, old wine in dark rounded age-encrusted
bottles, and the great blond figures of naked women on
rose-clouded ceilings. Then the light was full and rich,
brown-golden like great fields in autumn; it was full swelling
golden light like mown fields, bronze-red picketed with fat rusty
golden sheaves of corn, and governed by huge barns of red and the
mellow winy fragrance of the apples.--Yes, all of this had been
the tone and texture of the lights that qualified his vision of
the city and the river when he was a child.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Proud, cruel, ever-changing and ephemeral city, to whom we
came once when our hearts were high, our blood passionate and
hot, our brain a particle of fire: infinite and mutable city,
mercurial city, strange citadel of million-visaged time--Oh!
endless river and eternal rock, in which the forms of life came,
passed and changed intolerably before us, and to which we came,
as every youth has come, with such enormous madness, and with so
mad a hope--for what?</p>

<p>To eat you, branch and root and tree; to devour you, golden
fruit of power and love and happiness; to consume you to your
sources, river and spire and rock, down to your iron roots; to
entomb within our flesh for ever the huge substance of your
billion-footed pavements, the intolerable web and memory of dark
million-visaged time.</p>

<p>And what is left now of all our madness, hunger, and desire?
What have you given, incredible mirage of all our million shining
hopes, to those who wanted to possess you wholly to your ultimate
designs, your final sources, from whom you took the strength, the
passion, and the innocence of youth?</p>

<p>What have we taken from you, protean and phantasmal shape of
time? What have we remembered of your million images, of your
billion weavings out of accident and number, of the mindless fury
of your dateless days, the brutal stupefaction of your thousand
streets and pavements? What have we seen and known that is ours
for ever?</p>

<p>Gigantic city, we have taken nothing--not even a handful of
your trampled dust--we have made no image on your iron breast and
left not even the print of a heel upon your stony-hearted
pavements. The possession of all things, even the air we
breathed, was held from us, and the river of life and time flowed
through the grasp of our hands for ever, and we held nothing for
our hunger and desire except the proud and trembling moments, one
by one. Over the trodden and forgotten words, the rust and dusty
burials of yesterday, we were born again into a thousand lives
and deaths, and we were left for ever with only the substance of
our waning flesh, and the hauntings of an accidental memory, with
all its various freight of great and little things which passed
and vanished instantly and could never be forgotten, and of those
unbidden and unfathomed wisps and fumes of memory that share the
mind with all the proud dark images of love and death.</p>

<p>The tugging of a leaf upon a bough in late October, a skirl of
blown papers in the street, a cloud that came and went and made
its shadow in the lights of April. And the forgotten laughter of
lost people in dark streets, a face that passed us in another
train, the house our mistress lived in as a child, a whipping of
flame at a slum's cold corner, the corded veins on an old man's
hand, the feathery green of a tree, a daybreak in a city street
in the month of May, a voice that cried out sharply and was
silent in the night, and a song that a woman sang, a word that
she spoke at dusk before she went away,--the memory of a ruined
wall, the ancient empty visage of a half-demolished house in
which love lay, the mark of a young man's fist in crumbling
plaster, a lost relic, brief and temporal, in all the everlasting
variousness of your life, as the madness, pain and anguish in the
heart that caused it--these are all that we have taken from you,
iron-breasted city, and they are ours and gone for ever from us,
even as things are lost and broken in the wind, and as the ghosts
of time are lost, and as the everlasting river that flowed past
us in darkness to the sea.</p>

<p>The river is a tide of moving waters: by night it floods the
pockets of the earth. By night it drinks strange time, dark time.
By night the river drinks proud potent tides of strange dark
time. By night the river drains the tides, proud potent tides of
time's dark waters that, with champ and lift of teeth, with lapse
and reluctation of their breath, fill with a kissing glut the
pockets of the earth. Sired by the horses of the sea, maned with
the dark, they come.</p>

<p>They come! Ships call! The hooves of night, the horses of the
sea, come on below their manes of darkness. And for ever the
river runs. Deep as the tides of time and memory, deep as the
tides of sleep, the river runs.</p>

<p>And there are ships there! Have we not heard the ships there?
(Have we not heard the great ships going down the river? Have we
not heard the great ships putting out to sea?)</p>

<p>Great whistles blow there. Have we not heard the whistles blow
there? Have we not heard the whistles blowing in the river? (A
harness of bright ships is on the water. A thunder of faint
hooves is on the land.)</p>

<p>And there is time there. (Have we not heard strange time, dark
time, strange tragic time there? Have we not heard dark time,
strange time, the dark, the moving tide of time as it flows down
the river?)</p>

<p>And in the night-time, in the dark there, in all the sleeping
silence of the earth have we not heard the river, the rich
immortal river, full of its strange dark time?</p>

<p>Full with the pulse of time it flows there, full with the
pulse of all men living, sleeping, dying, waking, it will flow
there, full with the billion dark and secret moments of our lives
it flows there. Filled with all the hope, the madness and the
passion of our youth it flows there, in the daytime, in the dark,
drinking with ceaseless glut the land, mining into its tides the
earth as it mines the hours and moments of our life into its
tides, moving against the sides of ships, foaming about piled
crustings of old wharves, sliding like time and silence by the
vast cliff of the city, girdling the stony isle of life with
moving waters--thick with the wastes of earth, dark with our
stains, and heavied with our dumpings, rich, rank, beautiful, and
unending as all life, all living, as it flows by us, by us, by
us, to the sea!</p>

<h1>LIX</h1>

<p> </p>

<p>Full night had come when he got off the train at the town
where Joel was to meet him. After the heavy rains of the
afternoon, and the stormy sunset, the sky had cleared completely:
a great moon blazed in the cloudless bowl of a depthless sky;
after the rain, and the sultry swelter of the city streets, the
tainted furnace-fumes of city breath, the air was clean and
fresh, and marvellously sweet, and the great earth waited, and
was still enormously, and one always knew that it was there.</p>

<p>The engine panted for a moment with a hoarse, metallic
resonance, in the baggage-car someone threw mail-bags and thick
bundles of evening papers off onto the platform, there was the
swinging signal of a brakesman's lantern, the tolling of the
engine bell, thick, hose-like jets of steam blew out of her, the
terrific pistons moved like elbows, caught, bore down, the
terrific flanges spun for a moment, the short, squat funnel
belched explosive thunders of hot smoke, the train rolled past
with a slow, protesting creak of ties, a hard-pressed rumble of
the heavy coaches, and was on her way again.</p>

<p>Then the train was gone, and there was nothing but the rails,
the earth, the moon, the river, and strong silence--and the
haunting and immortal visage of America by night. It was there,
and it was there for ever, and he had always known it, and it
abode there and was still, and there was something in his heart
he could not utter. The rails swept northward towards the dark,
and in the moon the rails were like two living strands of burning
silver, and between the rails the heavy ballast rock was white as
lunar marble, and the brown wooden ties were resinous and dry and
very still.</p>

<p>Sheer beside the tracks, the low banks of the ballast-fill
sloped to the edges of the mighty river. And the river blazed
there in the great blank radiance of the moon, cool waters gently
lapped small gluts and pockets of the shore, and in the great
wink of the moon the river blazed more brightly than elves' gold.
And farther off, where darkness met it, the light was broken into
scallop-shells of gold; it swam and shimmered in a billion winks
of fire like a school of herrings on the water, and beyond all
that there was just the dark, the cool-flowing mystery of
velvet-hearted night, the silent, soundless surge and coolness of
the strange, the grand, the haunting, the unceasing river.</p>

<p>Far, far away in darkness, on the other shore--more than a
mile away--the river met the fringes of the land, but where the
river ended, or the land began, was hard to say. There was just
<i>there</i> a greater darkness, perhaps just by a shade, a
deeper, dark intensity of night--a dark, perhaps, a shade less
lucent, smooth, and fluid, by an indefinable degree more
solid.</p>

<p>Yet there were lights there--there were lights--a bracelet of
a few, hard lights along the river, a gem-like incandescence, few
and hard and bright, and so poignantly lost and lonely in
enormous darkness as are all lights in America, sown sparsely on
the enormous viewless mantle of the night, and by that pattern so
defining it--a scheme of sparse, few lights, hard, bright and
small, sown there upon night's enormous darkness, the great
earth's secret and attentive loneliness, its huge, abiding
mystery.</p>

<p>And for ever, beyond the mysterious river's farthest shore,
the great earth waited in the darkness, and was still. It waited
there with the huge, attentive secrecy of night and of America,
and of the wilderness of this everlasting earth on which we live;
and its dark visage that we cannot see was more cruel, strange
and lonely than the visage of dark death, and its rude strength
more savage and destructive than a tiger's paw, and its wild,
mysterious loveliness more delicate than magic, more desireful
than a woman's flesh, and more thrilling, secret and seductive
than a woman's love.</p>

<p>As he stood there, tranced in that powerful spell of silence
and of night, he heard swift footsteps running down the station
stairs, he turned and saw Joel Pierce approaching. He ran forward
quickly, his tall, thin figure clad in a blue coat and white
flannels, alive with the swift boyish eagerness that was one of
his engaging qualities.</p>

<p>"Gosh!" he said, in his eager whispered tone, panting a little
as he came up, "--I'm sorry that I'm late: we have people staying
at the house; I had to drive a woman who's been staying with us
to Poughkeepsie--I tried to get you there, but your train had
already gone. I drove like hell getting here.--It's good to see
you!" he burst out in his eager whispering way--at once so
gentle, and so friendly and spontaneous--"It's <i>swell</i> that
you could come!" he whispered enthusiastically. "Come on! They're
all waiting for you!"</p>

<p>And picking up his friend's valise, he walked swiftly across
the platform and began to climb the stairs.</p>

<p>Although Joel Pierce would have spoken in this way to any
friend--to anyone for whom he had a friendly feeling, however
casual--and although the other youth knew that he would have
spoken this way to many other people--the words filled him with
happiness, with an instinctive warmth and affection for the
person who had spoken them. Indeed, the very fact that there was
in Joel's words--in all his human relationships--this curious
impersonality, gave what he said an enhanced value. For in this
way Joel revealed instinctively what everyone who knew him well
felt about him--an enormous decency and radiance in his soul and
character, a wonderfully generous and instinctive friendliness
towards humanity--that became finer and more beautiful because of
its very impersonality.</p>

<p>This warm, instinctive humanity was evident in all he did, it
came out somehow in the most casual words and relationships with
people. For example, when they went upstairs into the station
waiting-room, which was completely empty, Joel paused for a
moment at the booking-office window and spoke to a man in
shirt-sleeves inside.</p>

<p>"Joe," he said casually yet in his eager, whispering way, "if
Will comes down will you tell him not to wait? I've got everyone:
there'll be no one else tonight."</p>

<p>"All right, Mr. Pierce," the man said quietly. "If I see him,
I'll tell him."</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Joel's car, a small, cheap one of a popular make, was backed
up against the station curb: he opened the door and put his
friend's suitcase in the back, then they both got in and drove
away.</p>

<p>About two miles back from town upon the crest of a hill that
gave a good view of the great moon-wink of the noble and haunting
river far below, Joel suddenly, and without slackening his
reckless speed, swerved from the concrete highway into a dusty
and gravel road that went off to the left. And now they were
really in the heart of the deep country: on each side of them the
moon-drenched fields and dreaming woods of a noble, grand and
spacious land slept in the steep, white silence of the moon. From
time to time they would pass corn-fields, the high and silent
stature, the cool figure of the corn at night, and see a great
barn, or small lights burning in some farmer's house. Then there
would be only the deep, dark mystery of sleeping woods beside the
road and once, in a field, a herd of cows, all faced one way,
bedded down upon their forequarters, the mottled colours of their
hides showing plainly in the blazing radiance of the moon. When
they had gone about a mile their road swept into another one that
joined it at right angles: between these roads, in the angle that
they formed, there was a pleasant house--a wooden structure of
eight or ten rooms, white and graceful in the moon, and
surrounded by a trim, well-kept lawn and well laid-out
flower-plots and gardens.</p>

<p>A swift and pleasurable conviction told the youth that this
was Joel's house: he was therefore surprised when the car shot
past without slackening its speed and then turned left upon the
other road. He turned to Joel and, almost with a note of protest
in his voice, said:</p>

<p>"Don't you live there? Isn't that your house?"</p>

<p>"What?" Joel whispered quickly, startled from the focal
concentration of his driving. He turned to his companion with a
surprised inquiring look. "Oh, <i>that</i> house?" he went on at
once. "No," he said softly. "That's not our house.--That is, it
is our house," he corrected himself, "it belongs to us, but a
friend of ours--Margaret Telfair--lives there now. You'll meet
her tonight," he went on casually. "She's at the house
now.--You'll <i>like</i> her," he whispered with soft conviction,
"--she's grand! An <i>incredible</i> person!" he whispered
enthusiastically.</p>

<p>They drove on in silence for some time: more moon-drenched
fields, great barns and little farmhouses, and herds of crouching
cattle, more dreaming and mysterious woods, the mysterious
shadows of great trees against the road, and secrecy, and sweet
balsamic scents and cool-enfolding night.--They were now driving
back in the direction of the river: the new road led that
way.</p>

<p>"When do we come to your place, Joel?" the other youth asked,
when they had driven on in silence for a time. "How far is
it?"</p>

<p>"What?" Joel whispered quickly, again turning his radiant and
inquiring face. <i>"Our</i> place? Oh!" he said. "We're on our
place now."</p>

<p><i>"On</i> it?" the other stammered, after a moment's
bewildered pause. "But--but--where--I didn't see a gate or
anything--when?--"</p>

<p>"Oh," Joel whispered, with an enlightened air. <i>"That!</i>
We passed it."</p>

<p><i>"Passed</i> it? Where?"</p>

<p>"When we turned in from the main road," Joel whispered. "Do
you remember?"</p>

<p>"The--the <i>main</i> road?" the other stammered. "You--you
mean--that concrete highway way back there?"</p>

<p>"Yes," Joel whispered. "That was the entrance to our
place--one of them. It's not much of an entrance," he whispered
apologetically. "I don't wonder that you couldn't see it."</p>

<p>"Then--then--everything since then--all we passed--all
this--?" the other stammered.</p>

<p>"Yes," Joel whispered, with his radiant, eager look, "that's
it. That's our place. It's really grand country," he went on
matter-of-factly. "I want to show you around tomorrow."</p>

<p>They swept suddenly around a curve of the gravelled road,
bordered with fragrant shrubs. Before them stretched out an
immense sward of velvet lawn, darkened by the grand and silent
stature of great trees. The car swept forward; through the
tree-barred vista of the lawn, the outline of a house appeared.
It was a dream-house, a house such as one sees only in a
dream--the moonlight slept upon its soaring wings, its white
purity, and gave the whole enormous structure an aerial delicacy,
a fragile loveliness like some enchanted structure that one sees
in dreams. And yet, for all this quality of dream-enchantment,
there was something hauntingly familiar about it too. The car
swept around the drive and halted before the moonlit
fa&ccedil;ade of the house. A back porch level with the ground
was flanked by tall, square columns of graceful, slender wood. To
one side, far below, beyond the house, and the great moon-sweep
of velvet, he could see the wink and glimmer of the Hudson
River.</p>

<p>And suddenly that haunting sense of familiarity fused to a
blind flash of recognition. The house was the house he had passed
a dozen times in darkness, had seen a dozen times at morning from
the windows of a speeding train along the river, as he hurtled
citywards again from those blind night passages of desire and
fury in a town called Troy.</p>

<p>They got out of the car. Joel took his valise, and like a
person walking in a dream, he followed him across the porch, into
a large and dimly lit entrance-hall. Joel put his valise down in
the hall, and turning, whispered:</p>

<p>"Look. I'll show you your room later. Mums and some other
people are waiting for us on the terrace. Let's go and say hello
to them first."</p>

<p>He nodded, unable to speak, and in silence followed his guide
down the hall and through the house. Joel opened a door: the
blazing moonlight fell upon the vast, swarded lawn and sleeping
woods of that magic domain known as Far Field Farm. And that
haunting and unearthly radiance fell as well upon the white wings
of that magic house and on a group of its fortunate inhabitants
who were sitting on the terrace.</p>

<p>The two young men went out: forms rose to greet them.</p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h1>LX</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>A group of eight or ten people were gathered on the terrace.
Joel introduced Eugene swiftly, quietly, in an eager, whispering
voice, as always, with his fine, kind intuition, mindful of
another person's embarrassment and confusion: the moonlit figures
rose, looked toward him, passed and swam and mixed around him in
a blur of names and moon-white faces and politely murmured words.
Then all the figures resolved themselves again into their former
positions; he was standing beside Joel's mother, looking at her
with a helpless and bewildered face; she put one hand swiftly,
lightly on his arm, and in a kind and quiet voice said to him:
"You sit down here, next to me."</p>

<p>Then she sat down again in her chair--a big, wicker chair with
a vast, fan-shaped back, he sat down beside her, and sank
gratefully into oblivion while the other people resumed their
interrupted conversation.</p>

<p>"No, but--<i>Polly! Surely</i> not! You know, she actually did
not go through with it?" said a strong, protesting voice, in
which yet an eager curiosity was evident. "You know, they stopped
the thing before she went the whole way?"</p>

<p>"My dear," said Polly firmly--she had evidently been well
named: in the moonlight her face showed sharp and pointed, with a
big nose, and the shrewd, witty, and rather malicious features of
a parrot--"my dear, I <i>know</i> she <i>did.</i> I was visiting
Alice Bellamy at Newport when it happened: I got the whole story
straight from her. The family were perfectly frantic--they were
calling Hugh Bellamy up or running in to see him a dozen times a
day to find out if something could be done--how to get it
annulled--But I tell you," Polly cried, shaking her head
obstinately and speaking in a tone of unmistakable conviction,
"--I know what I'm talking about! There's no doubt about it
whatever--she <i>married</i> him--the ceremony was
<i>actually</i> performed--"</p>

<p>"And she really <i>lived</i> with him--with this--this
<i>stable-boy?"</i></p>

<p><i>"Lived</i> with him!" Polly cried. "My dear, they'd been
living together for almost two weeks before old Dick Rossiter
found them. Now, of course," she said piously, but with a faint,
malicious smirk, "--I don't know what they'd been doing all that
time--perhaps the whole affair had been quite idyllic, but--well,
my dear, you can use your own imagination. My own experience with
ostlers is rather limited, but I shouldn't think they were
particularly renowned for their platonic virtues."</p>

<p>"No," said Mrs. Pierce quietly, but with an unmistakable note
of level and obdurate cynicism in her voice, "--nor Ellen
Rossiter either--not if I know the breed! . . . After all," she
went on in a moment, in a voice that was characterized by its
grimly quiet conviction, "what else could you expect out of that
crowd? . . . There's bad blood there! Bad blood in the whole lot
of them," her voice rose on a formidable and powerful note of
unrelenting judgment. "--Everyone in Society knows that old Steve
Buchanan, that girl's grandfather, was a thorough-going rotter,"
she bit the word off almost viciously. "His reputation was so bad
that most people wouldn't even have him in their house--that was
the reason he spent the last twenty years of his life in France:
he had become an outcast over here, no one would speak to him--he
had to get out!--But! Heavens! A <i>stable-boy!"</i> she laughed
again, and this time her laugh was almost hard and ugly. "What a
blow to Myra--after all her years of scheming and contriving to
get Timmy Wilson and his millions into the family! . . . I knew
it! I knew it!" she shook her head with formidable, obstinate
conviction. "I could have told them long ago they'd have trouble
with that girl before they were done with her! There's bad blood
there! Of course, it was <i>bound</i> to happen, sooner or later,
anyway--Myra's a fool of the first water: she never had the
brains of a rabbit. But to think!--Heavens! what a let-down after
all her scheming: a stable-boy! I bet she had a fit!"</p>

<p>"Still," suggested a young man named Howard, at this
propitious moment, in his mincing, lisping, and effeminately
mannered tone, "--as Irene Cartwright said, it was the only
original thing that Ellen Rossiter ever did, and it was rather a
pity to break the romance off. . . . I thought," he went on
casually, "that the story they told about the ostler was rather
touching--asking her to send his letters back, you know!"</p>

<p>"No!" cried Mrs. Pierce in an astounded tone. "Did he? . . .
Well!" she went on eagerly. "And did she send them? . . . Go on,
Howard!"</p>

<p>"But, of course," said Howard. "And the wedding-ring, and
everything else that he had given her. . . . I read the letter
that he wrote her: it was really <i>too</i> pathetic--he said he
was going with another girl--a housemaid, I believe--and he
didn't want it to get out that he had paid attentions to someone
else. . . . 'I have spoke it all over with my mother,' he said,"
Howard quoted drolly, "'and she thinks the same as me, you ought
to let me have them back'"--</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>Howard!"</i> Mrs. Pierce shrieked faintly. "You
<i>know</i> he didn't! Simply <i>priceless!"</i></p>

<p>For a moment her splendid, even teeth flashed brilliantly in
the moonlight: she lifted the long cigarette-holder in her hand
and took a long, deliberate puff: the fragrant, acrid smoke of
Turkish tobacco coiled upward in the moonlight air like filings
of light steel. Turning to the young man beside her, she
addressed him with the somewhat patient and dutiful kindliness of
a person receiving a strange guest in her home for the first
time.</p>

<p>"Well," she said, "and how did you find the trip up? Did Joel
frighten you out of your wits by his driving? He does everyone
else."</p>

<p>"Well, he did go pretty fast," the youth admitted. "He had me
hanging on once or twice--when we left the main road we took the
curve on two wheels, but he seemed to know what he was
doing."</p>

<p>"I assure you," said Mrs. Pierce, with a stern laugh, "that he
does not. I wish I could share your confidence, but I can't. I
don't think he has the faintest notion what he's doing."</p>

<p>"But, after all," the very quiet, pleasant, almost toneless
voice of a young man whose name was George Thornton now took up
the thread of the discussion--"after all, I should think that any
reasonable man would be content with a speed of thirty-five or
forty miles an hour. After all," he said very quietly again,
"perhaps the most important things in life are not to be got at
through speed--perhaps all the things that are most worth living
for are not to be had if we always go a mile a minute."</p>

<p>"That's just it, George!" Mrs. Pierce put in with decisive
satisfaction. "That's just it! Any reasonable man <i>would</i> be
content with thirty-five or forty miles an hour--but Joel is not
reasonable. When he gets in a car he's like a child that's been
given a new toy to play with for the first time."</p>

<p>"The greatest things in life, the highest values," George
Thornton went on in his quiet, pleasant, almost toneless voice,
which now, despite the air of telling reasonableness with which
he spoke--the air of temperance, moderation and control--was,
somehow, indefinably tinged by a sombre fatality: the tone of a
man whose extreme reasonableness comes from a fear of madness,
whose temperance from some fatal impulse to insane excess--"the
greatest things in life," he went on in his quiet, toneless
voice, almost as if he were talking to himself and had not heard
what Mrs. Pierce had said--"are not to be got from machinery or
speed, or any material object in the world whatever. . . .
Christ," he continued with his quiet, utterly reasonable, and
implacable finality, "said that the greatest thing in life is
love. Buddha said that the greatest thing in life is the
illumination of the human spirit. Socrates found that man's
highest duty was obedience to his country's laws. And Confucius,
after weighing life and death against each other, found man's
only reason for living in keeping as many of the conventions of
society as he could. . . . And that, Joel, perhaps is the real
reason, the only reason, why you should not drive your car at
reckless speed. . . . You break your country's law by doing so .
. . and you cause pain and worry and anxiety to other people who
may love you. For that reason, if for nothing else, you ought not
to do it."</p>

<p>He delivered this judgment in his quiet and toneless voice,
without vanity or arrogance, but with a finality that was almost
prophetic and that left no room for argument. When he was done
speaking there was a deep, impersonal silence for a moment, and
then the voice of Joel's sister, Rosalind--a voice that was still
the voice of a girl, but that was also sweet and low and womanly,
full of noble tenderness and warmth--could be heard in all its
affectionate young impulsiveness:</p>

<p>"Oh, but, George!--you're an <i>angel</i> about everything! If
everyone were like you, life would be heaven!" She took his hand
between her strong, warm hands and squeezed it--an impulsive and
natural gesture with her that revealed, as much as anything else,
the deep and true affection of her nature. "--Darling," she said,
"--you make all of us--everyone else--feel so mean--and
small--and--so petty. . . . I mean," she went on with the earnest
and na&iuml;ve sincerity, the spontaneous admiration, of a
generous and warm-spirited girl--"the way you live--the way you
have spent your whole life, George, in helping other people--the
way you have found out all these wonderful things
about--about--Buddha and Confucius and Socrates--you <i>know</i>
so much, George!" she cried enthusiastically--"you have learned
so much, while the rest of us were just leading an idle, stupid,
empty kind of life--and the way you give it all away to
others--the way you give your money away to anyone who needs
it--the--the--way," she faltered suddenly, and her voice was
choked with tears--"the way you have looked after poor Dick all
these years"--she blurted out.</p>

<p>"Rosalind!" Mrs. Pierce cried out sharply and warningly, yet
not with reproof so much as with apprehension.</p>

<p>"I don't care!" cried Rosalind impulsively--"I--I think he's
wonderful! George, you're a <i>saint!"</i> she said, and clasped
his hand again.</p>

<p>No one spoke for a moment: George sat quietly on the terrace
step, his fine and small bronzed head, his very still eyes, in
whose steady, quiet depths the fatal madness which would destroy
him was already legible, turned out across the great sward of
moon-drenched lawn towards the shine and wink and velvet mystery
of the noble river far below. In the quality of silence that held
all these people, there was a sense of profound emotion--the
reference to "poor Dick" had touched some sorrowful fact that all
of them knew about, and one could sense this deep feeling now in
the stony silence that held all of them. It was broken in a
moment by Mrs. Pierce, who betrayed, by the studied
matter-of-factness of her tone, the emotion which she, too, had
felt.</p>

<p>"But it <i>is</i> an extraordinary thing, George--a simply
astonishing thing--to find a young man of your age who has read
and studied--and--and--<i>prepared</i> himself for life the way
you have. It's <i>simply</i> astonishing!" she concluded, and
then did what was perhaps an astonishing thing for her--quickly
and vigorously she blew her nose. "But <i>simply</i>
astonishing!" she said again, as she thrust the handkerchief away
and put a cigarette into her eight-inch holder.</p>

<p>"No, I think not," he said quietly, and without a trace of
vanity or false modesty. "It would have been astonishing if I had
not done it. After all, my debt to society for all that it has
done for me is great enough as it is: I could not with any
decency look the world in the face if I knew that I had not made
some effort to repay it."</p>

<p>"How few rich young men feel that way about it," said Mrs.
Pierce quietly. "I wish more did!"</p>

<p>The conversation was now turned to other, lighter channels of
discussion: gossip, spirited but light debate. Mrs. Pierce
renewed her conversation with Howard and Polly; farther away upon
the steps Rosalind, Seaholm, a dark girl named Ruth, and George
Thornton talked, gossiped and laughed together with the charming
intimacy of youth, and Joel and Miss Telfair were engaged in
eager and excited debate--Joel, for the most part, listening with
the eager, respectful, bent-forward attentiveness, the devoted
courtesy of reverence, that marked all of his relations with
women, and Miss Telfair doing most of the talking. She talked the
way she looked and dressed and acted, the way she was: a speech
fragile, empty, nervous, brittle, artificial and incisive as one
of the precious bits of china, the costly, rare, enamelled little
trinkets that filled up her house, her life, her interest.</p>

<p>"No, Joel!" she was saying with a voice that had a curious,
shell-like penetration--a positive, brittle, but incisively
certain voice--"you are absolutely wrong! You are
<i>completely</i> mistaken about that! The thing cannot by any
stretch of the imagination be called Sienese! It is <i>pure</i>
Ravenna--<i>perfect</i> Ravenna--<i>absolutely!"</i> she cried,
shaking her enamelled face with obdurate conviction. "It's
nothing else on earth but the <i>purest</i> and <i>most
perfect</i> Ravenna--and Fourteenth Century Ravenna at that! . .
. No! No!" she cried incisively, cutting him off shortly, and
shaking her head stubbornly as he tried to put in a smiling,
whispered word of courteous doubt. "My dear child, you are dead
wrong! You don't know what you're talking about! . . . I was an
authority on these things before you were born. . . . I've
forgotten more about Ravenna than you'll ever know! . . . No! . .
. No! . . . Absolutely <i>not! . . .</i> You're <i>all</i>
wrong!"</p>

<p>He received this stubborn, arrogant and almost insulting
rebuttal as he always did--with the whispered, gracious humility
of his beautiful good nature: laughing softly and
enthusiastically over her arrogant and contemptuous denial, as if
he were merely the victim of the most tender and high-spirited
raillery.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>At this moment, however, when, with a sense of resentment and
displeasure he was listening to the naked and arrogant
penetrations of Miss Telfair's voice, Rosalind Pierce rose from
her seat on the terrace step, left the other young people there,
came swiftly to where Eugene was seated, and sat down beside
him.</p>

<p>"Why are you sitting here all by yourself--so quiet and so
alone?" she said in her warm, sweet, lovely, and affectionate
young voice. "Can I sit here and talk to you?" she said, and even
as she spoke these words, she slipped her arm through his and
clasped him by the hand. The whole life and character of this
beautiful, fine and lovely girl were in that simple, natural and
spontaneous gesture. That gesture did what words could never do,
explained what years of living with many people could not
explain: in an instant she communicated to him the whole quality
of her life, told him the kind of person she was. And the kind of
person she was was unbelievably good and beautiful.</p>

<p>"What have you been thinking of all the time you have been
sitting here?" she whispered in her low, sweet voice. "I could
see you sitting here, listening, looking at us, and all the time
it was just as if you were a million miles away. What were you
thinking?--that we are all an idle, shallow lot, with nothing to
do except to chatter and gossip about other useless people like
ourselves?"</p>

<p>"Why--no--no," he stammered. "Why--not at all--" He looked at
her with a red embarrassed face, but there was no guile or
mockery in her. She was not clever enough for sarcasm or malice,
not witty enough for irony: she was a creature full of innocence
and ardour, without profound intelligence, but with a nature full
of warmth, generous enthusiasm, and affection.</p>

<p>"I--I--think you're all fine," he blurted out. "I think you're
great."</p>

<p>"Do you, darling?" she said softly. "Well, we're not." She
pulled him towards her with a gesture of friendly intimacy, and
said: "Come on: let's leave them all for a few minutes. I want to
talk to you."</p>

<p>They got up, and still with her warm hand clasped in his, they
walked along the terrace and around the great, moon-whitened
wings of the house on to the road that swept in an oval before
it.</p>

<p>"Do you really like us?" she said, as they walked on down the
road away from the house under a deep, nocturnal mystery of great
trees through which the moonlight shone and swarmed upon the
earth in mottles of light. "Don't you like Joel? Don't you think
he's grand?"</p>

<p>"I--I think he's the best fellow in the world," he said.
"He's--he's just <i>too</i> good!"</p>

<p>"Oh, he's a saint," she said in her quiet, sweet voice. "There
was never anyone like him: he's the loveliest person I've ever
known. . . . Aren't people wonderful?" she said, and turned and
paused in the moonlit road and looked at him. "I mean, there are
a lot of mean ones . . . and useless ones . . . and sort of
shabby ones like . . . like--well, like some of those people
there tonight . . . but there's something good in all of
them--even poor little Howard Martin has something sweet and good
in him: he has a kind heart--he really has--he wants to be
amusing and to entertain people, he wants everyone to be happy
and have a good time. . . . And when you meet someone like Joel,
it makes up for everything else, doesn't it? . . . Or George
Thornton--don't you like him? Don't you think he's a grand
person, too?"</p>

<p>"He--seems fine," he answered with some difficulty. "I--I
never met him till tonight."</p>

<p>"Oh, you'll <i>love</i> him when you get to know him," the
girl said earnestly. "--Everybody does. . . . He's another saint,
just like Joel . . . and he's so brave, and kind, and good--and
his life has been so terrible."</p>

<p>"Terrible? I--I thought he said--"</p>

<p>"Oh, he <i>is,</i> darling--he <i>does</i> have everything
<i>that</i> way--money, I mean. He's terribly rich: one of the
richest young men in the world. . . . Only he doesn't spend it on
himself, he gives it all away and then . . . you see, darling,
George has had an unhappy life of it from the beginning. . . .
His father died a raving madman, there's been insanity in his
family for generations back, his mother was a horrible woman who
deserted him when he was a child and ran off with a man, and he
was brought up by an aunt--his father's sister--who was half
cracked herself. . . . Now he lives all alone on this big place
that he's inherited--he has one brother, Dick, who is two years
older than he is--and he has spent practically his whole life in
looking after Dick."</p>

<p>"Looking after him?"</p>

<p>"Yes," the girl said quietly, "--Dick is insane too--a raving
maniac; they have guards for him, they have to watch him every
minute of the time--when George comes to see him, Dick tries to
kill him. . . . And George loves him, he'd give his life for him,
he does everything he can to make Dick happy--and Dick hates him
so that he'd kill him if he could. . . . And George has this
thing hanging over him all the time, he can't forget about it for
a moment, it's made his whole life wretched, and yet you'd never
know it when you talk to him: he never mentions it, he's always
the same to people,--always kind and good and gentle, never
thinking of himself."</p>

<p>"I see. And is that the reason why he studies all these
different philosophies--Christ and Socrates and Confucius?--"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said quietly. "--And Buddha. I think so. . . . He
would never admit it . . . he has never said so . . . and of
course no one <i>could</i> ask him. . . . But I think that's the
reason. . . . There's something . . . something desperate . . .
lost . . . in his eyes sometimes," she said slowly, after a
pause. ". . . It's . . . it's not good to look at . . . it's . .
. I imagine it's like the look you would see in the eyes of a
drowning man."</p>

<p>"And you think that he may be afraid of . . . of
insanity?"</p>

<p>She was silent for a moment, and did not answer him
directly.</p>

<p>"He's been studying Buddhism for the last two years," she
said. "He's had all kinds of people at the house to teach him. .
. . Hindus, mystics, scholars--learned people . . . he's . . .
he's become more and more . . . I don't know," she said in a
puzzled tone. "--I don't know what you'd call it--sort of
mystical." Again she was silent, and presently added
matter-of-factly: "He's going to India next year."</p>

<p>"To study?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I think so," the girl said, and again was silent.
"Somehow--it's a dreadful thought, isn't it?" she said in a low
tone after a moment--"But sometimes I have wondered if George
would ever come back. . . . Perhaps," she concluded quietly, ". .
. perhaps that is why we all love him so much . . . it's like
loving someone who is brave and good and gentle that you know has
got to die."</p>

<p>For some time they walked on slowly down the moon-white road
without further speech.</p>

<p>"I want you to know Carl, too," she said. "He seems very cold
and strange at first--but that is just his foreign way. He is
really one of the loveliest, sweetest people that ever lived. . .
. You know," she said presently, "we are going to be married in
October."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know. Joel told me. . . . Will you live here--in this
country?"</p>

<p>"No. I'm afraid not. . . . You see, Carl is in the diplomatic
service, and they get moved around a great deal. They have to go
where they get sent."</p>

<p>"And where will you go first? Do you know?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I think they are sending him to Paris next."</p>

<p>"Will you like that? Do you think you'll like living in
Paris?"</p>

<p>"Of <i>course,"</i> she said with her rich, warm, easy laugh.
"I'm awfully easy to please--I like everything--I'm happy
anywhere--wherever I am. Is that very bad of me?" she said with a
kind and gently teasing smile.</p>

<p>"No, that's very good of you. . . . Have you ever been to
Paris?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she cried in a rich, enthusiastic tone, "and I love it.
I adore it. I studied music there. Mother and I lived there for
two years before I came out."</p>

<p>"But now you'll have to learn Swedish and German and Italian
and Spanish and Russian--all those languages--now that you're
getting married to a diplomat. Won't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said with her sweet and careless
laugh--"Everything! One must become a regular little walking
Berlitz school of languages--only I shan't mind very much: I'm
very stupid, but my husband is so kind and clever I'm sure I'll
learn in spite of everything."</p>

<p>"And you'll live in Paris and Rome and London and Berlin--all
those places? Won't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, darling," she said in her warm, sweet tone that always
had something maternal and tolerantly amused in its humour,
"--and in Copenhagen and Stockholm and Bucharest and Madrid--even
in Pogo Pogo or in China or Peru--wherever they choose to send
us. We'll be two international hoboes, darling--that's the kind
of life we'll have to lead."</p>

<p>"God!" he said bluntly. "It sounds wonderful! What a thing to
happen to anyone!--and to happen to you at your age! . . . But
won't if make all this--this place here--seem awfully far away,
and very strange--when you think back on it?"</p>

<p>"Yes," the girl said quietly, and added so softly that she
seemed to breathe the words--so softly that he could scarcely
hear her, "--and quite impossibly lovely!"</p>

<p>He stared at her in blank astonishment for a minute: she had
clasped her hands against her breast in a natural and simple
gesture, the moon had made an aureole of magic around the silken
strands of her brown hair, and suddenly he noticed that her eyes
were bright with tears.</p>

<p>"Very, very far away," she said in a low tone, "and enormously
beautiful. . . . You see," she said simply, "this is my home. . .
. I was born here, and I love it." She was silent for a moment
longer, and then she said quietly but in a more matter-of-fact
way:</p>

<p>"Don't you think our place--this country here--is
beautiful?"</p>

<p>He did not answer her for a moment: at first he was not even
conscious that he had heard her. He kept staring at her with a
comical expression of gape-jawed and hypnotic fascination. He was
conscious of a queer, bewildered and inappropriate feeling of
surprise--a kind of numb, absurd wonder that if he had read all
the books and poems in the world, and then tried to imagine for
himself something as impossibly lovely as this girl and the whole
scene around her, he could never, by any soaring stretch of the
imagination, have come within a million miles of it.</p>

<p>Behind her head the moon was making its spun aura of enchanted
light, the dress she was wearing was of some sweet gossamer stuff
of light moon-blue that seemed spun out of the very substance of
the moon itself--to float, to move like some aerial fume of magic
smoke, but the girl herself was lovely, sweet and strong as the
whole earth around her. She was herself no creature of elves'
fantasy, she was not lithe and slender, fleeting as a nymph: she
was a warm, strong-bodied girl, wide in the hips for children, a
nature warm and soft and gentle as a cow, but radiant and lovely
with fair girlhood, too, and full of sweetness, strength, and
tender, jolly humour.</p>

<p>She stood there in the middle of the white, empty road with
the enchanted radiance of the moon upon her, and he stared at her
unbelievingly, like a man who meets some vision in a dream and
does not know if he is dreaming or awake, and yet knows all the
time that it is real. Then he would take his fascinated gaze away
from her, and look down at the moon-white road, and stamp it with
his foot, and kick and scurf the ground of the moon-white road to
see if it was real, and then lift his head and look at her again,
and turn and see the great, sweet fields and meadows dreaming in
the moonlight, and cows down upon their knees, facing toward him
with their strange and silent stare, or faced one way and grazing
towards him through the moon pastures with sweet, wrenching pull
of teeth; and then he would see the dark and sleeping woods of
night, with all their mystery and loveliness and wild and solemn
joy, and secret terror, and all the grand and casual folds and
convolutions of the sleeping, moon-enchanted earth, and far away
the moon-blaze and wink, the herring glamour, and the dancing
scallop fires and all the darkness, coolness, and the
velvet-breasted mystery of the strange and silent river, the
haunted river, the great Hudson River, drawing on for ever from
the dark and secret earth the sources of its depthless tides, and
in the night-time, in the dark, with soundless movings of its
tide, drawing on for ever like time and silence past the strange
and secret land, the mysterious earth, the sleeping cities and
the lost and lonely little towns of dark America.</p>

<p>It was all so strange, so impossibly lovely, so hauntingly
familiar--the grand and casual landscape of America--and it
seemed past words and past belief, to be so much a part of this
girl's life, and she a part of it, that all the haunting mystery
of the secret earth, the silent river, and all its sweetness,
fragrance and fertility, its casual homeliness, and its unuttered
loveliness had entered into her, had fed her life, had shaped her
to its special quality, and like a solemn music was mixed into
the conduits of her blood and life and soul for ever, so that now
he could not bear to see her taken from it, he felt a cruel and
ruinous loss and waste in this destructive separation--a loss
that touched not only this girl's life, but the life of the great
earth and all America as well--a loss as if a rare and glorious
flower were brutally uprooted from the only earth that could
produce or nurture it and which would henceforth be, by reason of
its treasured loss, bereft. And feeling so, a blind and bitter
resentment surged up in his heart, his whole life and spirit were
set against her going, and in his soul an unforgiving and
protesting voice kept saying doggedly:</p>

<p>"Why has she got to go? Why must she be lost? Why does she
have to go and marry that damned Swede?"</p>

<p>In the great moon-drenched field beside the road, the cows
were moving towards them slowly, grazing, pulling the fragrant
meadow grass of night with sweet, cool wrenching, with rustling
stir, and with whisking of dry tails.</p>

<p>The girl walked over to the wire fence, and one of the cows,
after regarding her with its grave, gentle stare, moved slowly
towards her, rattling the fence wires as it thrust its gentle,
bending head across the fence and nuzzled her soft palm.</p>

<p>"She seems to know you," said the youth.</p>

<p>"Yes," the girl answered. "I know them all by name, they all
know me. I gave them all their names: this one's Brindle. Aren't
they lovely creatures?" she said quietly, as she stroked the cow.
"Such--such--gentle pets," she said, "with their kind looks and
great, soft eyes. They all know me, and will come to me when I
call their names."</p>

<p>The other cows, indeed, were now standing still, faced toward
her, looking at her with slow, gaunt and gentle heads. Now,
slowly, they started to move toward her, making a cool, sweet
rustling through night grasses as they came. The moonlight burst
upon their short, curved horns, it burst upon the rich bright
patches of their mottled hides, upon their stringy,
dung-bespattered rumps, their soft eyes, and the slow, gentle
wonder of their long, gaunt heads.</p>

<p>And it was all so wonderful--the sleeping woods, the
moon-enchanted fields, the slow, light grazings of the moonlit
cows, and all the fragrance of the night, the grass, the clover
and the meadow spells, and the magic warmth and loveliness of the
girl, and her sweet, low voice beside him in the moonlight--that
it seemed to him that all his life had been a prelude and a
preparation to this wonder. He did not know what he could say, it
came swelling up in a wild flood of tenderness and passion, he
felt that he must tell her somehow, and he had no words for
saying it; he seized her hands and stammered:</p>

<p>"Look here--if I live to be a million years I'll never--the
way the river was tonight, the moon, and the way Joel met me and
then finding you and your mother and your friends there in the
moonlight--and the river down below--and now this walk with
you--this road--the field--and all these cows there in the
field--and you here--why, by God!" he cried thickly,
incoherently, "you are the finest girl I ever saw in all my
life!--this place--tonight here--the most wonderful--"</p>

<p>"Come on," she said quietly, with her warm, young laugh, and
took him by the arm again. "We must be going back:--the others
will be waiting for us--but it <i>has</i> been lovely, hasn't
it?"</p>

<p>"Why," he muttered thickly and seized her hand again, "--why!
By God! By God!"</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>When they got back to the house the guests had risen for
departure, but were standing in an interested group around George
Thornton, who was showing them gymnastics.</p>

<p>"Another thing," he was saying, in his very quiet, pleasant,
toneless voice, "--another thing that you can try is this." With
these words he stretched his slight and graceful figure--which
was as tough as hickory and as flexible as a whip--flat out upon
the bricked floor of the terrace.</p>

<p>"Try this some time," he continued in his quiet, even tone
that had a curiously hushed, still and almost sombre penetration
in the deep moon-silence of the night. "Try lying flat out on
your back some time--like this." And he lay there, small,
graceful, beautifully lithe, completely relaxed.</p>

<p>"And then what?" said Mrs. Pierce in an interested tone. "What
do you do then, George?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," he said with toneless quiet. "You just lie
there--it relaxes you: a Hindu showed me how to do it."</p>

<p>"Oh, but anyone could do that!" Howard Martin protested, in
his mannered and rather effeminate voice. "Even I could do that,
George."</p>

<p>"It's not as easy as you think," George said. "You see," he
went on quietly, "it's really a greater effort to be relaxed than
most of us realize. Most of us are all tied up in a knot--so much
more tense than we know we are. The thing you've got to do," he
went on with his quiet and fatal tonelessness, "is to
relax--utterly relax--just let everything relax. You've got to
lie so that everything--the back of your head, your shoulders,
your spinal column--the whole thing--lies flat upon the floor.
Like this," he said, and just lay there, small, fragile,
beautifully lithe and strong, and utterly, quietly,
"relaxed"--his voice coming with a quiet and strange penetration
from a figure that seemed inanimate. "--It's not easy to do, but
you can master it if you try."</p>

<p>"Oh, let me see! I'm going to try!" little Howard Martin cried
with the good-natured and unselfconscious eagerness that was
really one of his attractive and appealing qualities. And
completely unruffled by the laughter of the group, he immediately
lay down and stretched himself out beside George, his dapper
little figure looking indescribably comical as he tried to follow
George's instructions and imitate his posture:</p>

<p>"How's that, George?" he said presently, without moving. "Have
I got it?"</p>

<p>George turned and observed him keenly for a moment.</p>

<p>"No," he said quietly, "you haven't got it yet, Howard. You
see, you've got to flatten out completely. You've just got to let
everything go limp--relax--so that your whole back is flat upon
the ground."</p>

<p>"But I <i>am</i> flat! I <i>am</i> flat!" little Howard
protested in such a mincing and comical tone of protest that
everyone burst out in hearty laughter, and even George smiled his
fine, rare, and grave smile. "My <i>God!"</i> Howard said in an
agonized tone when the laughter had subsided, "if I was any
flatter I'd feel like a pancake."</p>

<p>"No, Howard," George Thornton said quietly after another
moment of observant silence. "You haven't got it yet. You see,
your back is really arched--you're not <i>relaxed</i>--your back
is not upon the floor--the thing is to make yourself lie out as
flat as a board--like this," and with the fingers of his strong,
small, bronzed hand he gently but firmly pushed Howard's stomach
down towards the floor. Howard grunted protestingly, but lay
there after George had taken his hand away, and George, after
looking at him closely for a moment, nodded approvingly and
said:</p>

<p>"Yes, that's better. You're getting it now. But you've really
got to practise every day. It looks easy, but it's hard to
do."</p>

<p>"But, George," Mrs. Pierce broke in, as Howard scrambled to
his feet, "--what I'm interested in knowing is how you keep that
beautiful, strong athlete's figure that you've got! And that
dancer's <i>waist!</i> My dear sir, that is the curse of a
woman's life: so if you can tell me what to do to take it off
around the waist and hips I'll be eternally grateful to
you."--She was, as a matter of fact, herself as lean and
well-conditioned as a race-horse, but George, still lying flat
upon the floor, answered quietly:</p>

<p>"Did you ever try this, Ida? I think you'll find it very
useful for keeping the waist down.--You lie flat on your
back--like this. You keep your arms flat at your sides--you
mustn't raise them or lift your head. You keep your legs
straight--you mustn't bend them at the knees--and then," slowly,
and with a sense of infinite, hard-muscled power and lean
endurance, he suited the action to the words, "you raise your
legs to right angles with your body--straighten out
again--raise--straighten--raise--straighten--raise--straighten--if
you do that a hundred times a day, when you get up and when you
go to bed, I don't think you'll ever be troubled by fat around
the waist," he concluded quietly.</p>

<p>"I know," Joel whispered, nodding with vigorous agreement.
"I've tried that. That's a good one. But a hundred times is a
lot! It's more than most people can do at first."</p>

<p>"Yes," said George quietly. "But you get used to it if you do
it every day! I can do it a hundred times with no difficulty
whatever," he concluded quietly.</p>

<p>"Oh, of <i>course!"</i> Joel whispered instantly. "But then,
you're hard as a rock, George. You can do anything."</p>

<p>"But that doesn't look hard," Howard said again with blithe
confidence. "Oh, I just <i>know</i> that I can do <i>that</i>
one," he said mincingly. And without further ado, while everyone
laughed, he stretched himself out again, extended his dapper
flannelled legs as George instructed him, and then slowly raised
them, lowered them, raised them again with such a painful grunt
that everyone burst out again in hearty laughter. After the
fourth effort he was through, admitting defeat with a painful
"Gosh! If I had to do that for a hundred times I'd be ready for
the undertaker," and scrambled to his feet again.</p>

<p>"Then," said George in his quiet, pleasant tone, "I think
you'll find this one good, Ida, for strengthening the muscles of
the back and stomach. You <i>arch,"</i> he said, "you arch with
the neck and feet--like this," and instantly his strong, frail,
beautifully proportioned figure was arched as lithely and
gracefully as a bow, "--you come down slow like this," he said,
and sank slowly toward the ground, "you arch again like
this"--again the light and graceful human bow.</p>

<p>"Oh, but that looks terribly hard to do, George!" Mrs. Pierce
protested. "I could never learn to do that: it's a regular circus
stunt."</p>

<p>"No," he said in his quiet and toneless fashion, "you could do
it, Ida. Of course, it <i>is</i> hard at first, but it would come
with practice. . . . It makes you very strong," he went on with a
completely detached matter-of-factness. "Do you see that?" He
arched his whip-cord body again and held it in that posture--"I
could keep that up indefinitely--it makes you hard as nails," he
went on quietly, and without an atom of vanity or
self-consciousness. "I could support the whole weight of a man's
body there without any difficulty--and <i>lift</i> him, too."</p>

<p>"Not <i>really!"</i> Joel whispered in an astounded tone.
"Simply incredible!"</p>

<p>"But not at all," said George quietly. "It's the easiest thing
on earth if you're used to it. Come here, Howard," he said
quietly, without moving from his arched position. "Sit down on
me."</p>

<p>"Sit <i>down</i> on you?" said Howard, in a comically
bewildered tone. <i>"Where,</i> George?"</p>

<p>"On my stomach," George replied. "Go on," he said, smiling his
fine, grave smile at sight of Howard's hesitation. "It's all
right. You won't hurt me at all. Sit down."</p>

<p>"Like--like this?" said Howard, and squatted gingerly and
gently, settling down finally upon George's arched stomach and
looking about with such a comically troubled and inquiring
expression that everyone burst out in hearty laughter again. "Is
that all right?" he said, turning anxiously and looking down at
his supporter.</p>

<p>"Yes, perfectly," said George. "Now draw your knees up and
hold them with your arms so that your whole weight is on me. . .
. Good! . . . Now! Are you ready? . . . One, two . . . One, two .
. . One, two," his lithe, whip-cord figure rose and fell, arched
and straightened, with little Howard sitting on top of him, and
looking around with the expression of a frightened, huddled
mannikin. When the demonstration was finished, both young men got
to their feet, and Joel's face could be seen raised in an
expression of radiant admiration, his voice could be heard in an
astounded whisper, saying:</p>

<p><i>"Simply</i> incredible!"</p>

<p>And Mrs. Pierce, her voice stronger, more powerful, and
penetrating, in slow, decisive declaration:</p>

<p><i>"George!</i>
I--think--that--is--the--<i>most</i>--<i>astonishing</i>--I
think--that--is--the--<i>most</i>--"</p>

<p>Words failed her, and as she looked at him, standing quietly
composed before her, with all his beautiful, lithe grace and
stillness, he smiled his grave, rare smile, and displayed his
only playful raillery of the evening:</p>

<p>"But really, Ida," he said quietly, as he smiled his fine,
slow smile at her, "if you're worried about that girlish figure
you ought to try <i>this</i> some time." With these words he bent
over backward, as lithe and limber as a whip, and with his
fingers arched upon the floor, suddenly, with effortless grace
and speed, and without moving an inch from his position, whirled
off a dozen brilliant cartwheels that would have done credit to a
circus tumbler.</p>

<p>He came gracefully, unweariedly erect again, to standing
posture, amid an ovation of breathlessly uttered wonder, frank
applause.</p>

<p>But now the time had come for parting: there was the sound of
a motor in the drive before the house, in a moment a maid-servant
came quietly out upon the terrace and informed Miss Telfair that
her car had come. She gathered her evening cloak about her
fragile, ivory shoulders--that were somehow like a piece of her
own rare porcelain--thrust her hand out towards Mrs. Pierce in
swift and firm farewell, and turned, saying in her crisp,
incisive voice: "Well, children, I'm departing. . . . Joel," she
said, pausing a moment as she went, "I shall expect you and your
young friend at my house for tea tomorrow."</p>

<p>"And are you coming to the pool tomorrow morning, Margaret?"
Mrs. Pierce called after her.</p>

<p>"That, my dear, I couldn't tell you," she said, going. "If I
do not get a call from town. We shall see what we shall see--good
night, all," and she went through the moonlit door into the
house.</p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h1>LXI</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Mrs. Pierce stood at the foot of the stairs surveying this
young stranger from the outside world with a tolerant but
glacially detached smile of impersonal curiosity:</p>

<p>". . . . Joel tells me that you like to stay up all night and
prowl around. What do you do on these prowling expeditions?"</p>

<p>He wanted to answer her with simple eloquence and grace and
warmth, he wanted to paint a picture of his midnight wanderings
that would hold her there in fascinated interest, but the glacial
impersonality of the woman's smile, the proud and haughty
magnificence of her person, froze all the ardours of enthusiasm
and conviction with which, he felt, he might have spoken; it even
seemed to numb and thicken the muscles of his tongue, and he
stood there gaping at her awkwardly, cutting a sorry figure, and
flushing crimson with anger and vexation at his lame, stupid,
halting tongue, and stammered out, replying:</p>

<p>"I--I walk," he mumbled. "I--I take walks."</p>

<p>"You--<i>what?"</i> she said kindly enough, but sharply, with
a kind of peremptory authority that told him that she must
already be growing weary and impatient of his stammering,
incoherent speech, his mumbling awkwardness.</p>

<p>"Oh--<i>walk!"</i> she cried, with an air of swift
enlightenment, as if her puzzled mind had just succeeded in
translating his jargon. "Oh," she said quietly, and looked at him
for a moment steadily with her fixed and glacial smile, "you
do."</p>

<p>It seemed to him that those brief words were already pregnant
with a cold indifferent dismissal: in them he seemed to feel the
impregnable indifference of her cold detachment--the yawning gulf
that separated her life from his. Already it seemed to him that
she had turned away from him, dismissing him as not worthy even
of such amused attention as she had given him. But after a
moment, as she continued to look at him with her brilliant,
glacial, detached, yet not unkindly smile, she continued:</p>

<p>"And what do you do on these walks? Where do you go?"</p>

<p>--Where? Where? Where indeed? His mind groped desperately over
the whole nocturnal pattern of the city--over the lean, gaunt
webbing of Manhattan with the barren angularity of its streets,
the splintered, glacial soar of its terrific buildings, and the
silent, frozen harshness of its streets of old brown houses,
grimy brick and rusty, age-encrusted stone.</p>

<p>Oh, he thought that he could tell her all that could be told,
that youth could know, that any man had ever known about night
and time and darkness, and about the city's dark and secret
heart, and what lay buried in the dark and secret heart of all
America. He thought that he could tell her all that any man could
ever know about the huge, attentive secrecy of night, and of
man's silent heart of buried, waiting, and intolerable desire,
about the thing that waits there in the night-time in America,
that lies buried at the city's secret heart of night, the mute
and single tongue of man's intolerable desire, the silence of his
single heart in all its overwhelming eloquence, the great tide
flowing in the hearts of men, as dark and as mysterious as the
great, unceasing river, the thing that waits and does not speak
and is for ever silent and that knows for ever, and that has no
words to say, no tongue to speak, and that unites six million
celled and lonely sleepers at the heart of night and silence, in
the great dark tide of the unceasing river, and of all our buried
songs of hope and joy and wild desire that live for ever in the
heart of night and of America.</p>

<p>Yes, he thought that he could tell her all of this, but when
he spoke, with thickened tongue, a numb and desperate constraint,
all that he could mutter thickly was: "I--I walk."</p>

<p>"But <i>where?"</i> she said, a trifle more sharply, still
looking at him with her glacial, curious smile. "That's what I'd
like to know. Where do you go? What do you see that's so
interesting? What do you find that's worth staying up all night
for? Where do you go when you make these expeditions?" she again
demanded. "Up to Broadway?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he mumbled thickly, "--sometimes--and--and sometimes--I
go down town."</p>

<p>"Down town?" the cool incisive inflection of the voice, the
glacial grey-green of the eye bored through him like a steel-blue
drill. "Downtown <i>where?</i> To the Battery?"</p>

<p>"Y-y-yes--sometimes. . . . And--and along the East Side, too,"
he mumbled.</p>

<p><i>"Where?"</i> she cried sharply, smiling, but manifestly
impatient with his mumbled, tongue-tied answers. <i>"Oh</i>--the
East Side!" she cried again, with the air of glacial
enlightenment. "--In the tenement section!"</p>

<p>"Yes--yes," he stumbled on desperately, "--and along
Fourteenth Street and Second Avenue--and Grand Street--and--and
Delancey--and--and the Bowery--and all the docks and piers and
all," he blurted out, conscious of Joel's eager, radiant smile of
hopeful kindness, and the miserable clown he was making of
himself.</p>

<p>"But I should think you would find all that dreadfully
boring." Mrs. Pierce's voice was now tinged with cool and mild
surprise. "And awfully ugly, isn't it? . . . I mean, if you've
got to prowl around at night, you might hunt for something a
little more attractive than the East Side, couldn't you? . . .
After all, we still have Riverside Drive--I suppose even that has
changed a great deal, but in my childhood it was quite a lovely
place. Or the Park?" she said, a little more kindly and
persuasively. "If you want to take a walk before going to bed,
why, wouldn't it be better to take it in the Park--where you
could see an occasional tree or a little grass? . . . Or even
Fifth Avenue and around Washington Square--that used to be quite
pleasant? But the East <i>Side!</i> Heavens! My dear boy, what on
earth do you ever find in a place like that to interest you?"</p>

<p>He was absolutely speechless, congealed, actually terrified by
the haughty magnificence, the glacial and almost inhuman
detachment, of her person. His mouth gaped, he gulped, his lips
quivered and made soundless efforts for a moment, and then he
stammered:</p>

<p>"You--you find--you find--p-p-p-people there," he said.</p>

<p><i>"People?"</i> Again her thin eyebrows arched in fine
surprise. "But of course you find people there! You find people
everywhere you go. . . . Only," she added, "I shouldn't think
you'd find many people anywhere at two o'clock in the morning. I
should think most of them would be in bed--even on the East
Side."</p>

<p>"They--they stay up late over there."</p>

<p>"But why?" she now cried with a good-natured but frank
impatience. "That's just what I'm trying to find out! . . .
What's it all about? What's all the <i>shooting</i> for?" she
said humorously, repeating a phrase which was in current use at
that time. "--What's the big attraction? What do they find to do
that's so interesting that it can keep them out of bed half
through the night? . . . Really," she cried, "if it's so amusing
as all that, I think I'll go and have a look myself. What do they
<i>do?"</i> she again insisted. "That's what I want to know."</p>

<p>"They--they sit around and talk."</p>

<p>"But <i>where? Where?"</i> she now cried with frank despair.
"My dear boy, that's what I want you to tell me."</p>

<p>"Oh, in--in lunch-rooms--and restaurants--and
speak-easies--and--and places like that."</p>

<p>"Yes," she nodded with an air of satisfaction. "Good. At
least, we have <i>that</i> settled. And you go to these places,
too--and sit around--and watch--and listen to them. Is that
it?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he said helplessly, nodding, her words suddenly making
all this restless and unceasing explanation of the night seem
reasonless, foolish, pitifully absurd, "sometimes."</p>

<p>"And what kind of people do you find in those places?" she
said curiously. "I've often wondered what kind of people go
there."</p>

<p>Kind? He stared at her foolishly with gaping jaw, and gaped
and muttered wordlessly, and could not find a word to say to her.
Kind? Great God! what word could ever shape them, what phrase
could ever utter the huge swarm and impact of just one moment,
out of all those million swarming memories of kaleidoscopic
night! Kind? Great God! the kind of all the earth, the kind of
the whole world, the unnumbered, nameless, swarming, and
illimitable kind that make all living! Kind? The mongrel compost
of a hundred races--the Jews, the Irish, the Italians, and the
niggers, the Swedes, the Germans, the Lithuanians and the Poles,
the Russians, Czechs, and Greeks, the Syrians, Turks and
Armenians, the nameless hodge-podge of the Balkans, as well as
Chinese, Japs, and dapper little Filipinos--a hundred tongues, a
thousand tribes, unnumbered colonies of life, all poured in
through the lean gateways of the sea, all poured in upon that
rock of life, to join the countless freightage of that ship of
living stone, all nurtured and sustained upon the city's strong
breast,--a thousand kinds, a single substance, all fused and
joined there at the heart of the night, all moving with that
central, secret and dynamic energy, all wrought and woven in,
with all their swarming variousness, into the great web of
America--with all its clamour, naked struggle, blind and brutal
strife, with all its violence, ignorance, and cruelty, and with
its terror, joy, and mystery, its undying hope, its everlasting
life.</p>

<p>All he could do was gape and mumble foolishly again, and
stammer finally: "There--there are all kinds, I guess," and
plunge on desperately, "and then--and then--there are the wharves
and piers and docks--the Battery and the City Hall--and then--and
then," he stumbled on, "--the Bridge--the Bridge is good."</p>

<p>"The Bridge?" Again the pencilled brows of arched surprise,
the glacial curiosity. "What bridge?"</p>

<p>What bridge? Great God! the only bridge, the bridge of power,
life and joy, the bridge that was a span, a cry, an ecstasy--that
was America. What bridge? The bridge whose wing-like sweep that
was like space and joy and ecstasy was mixed like music in his
blood, would beat like flight and joy and triumph through the
conduits of his life for ever. What bridge? The bridge whereon at
night he had walked and stood and watched a thousand times, until
every fabric of its soaring web was inwrought in his memory, and
every stone of its twin terrific arches was in his heart, and
every living sinew of its million cabled nerves had throbbed and
pulsed in his own spirit like his soul's anatomy.</p>

<p>"The--the Brooklyn Bridge," he mumbled. "The--the Bridge is
good."</p>

<p>"Good? How do you mean--good?" The glacial and amused inquiry
pierced his consciousness again with confusion, numb paralysis of
speech, and incoherence. And at this moment Joel, seeing his
agonizing embarrassment, came to his rescue with the exquisite,
radiant kindliness that was the constant evidence of his fine
character.</p>

<p>"Um. Yes," he could hear Joel whispering in a thoughtful and
convinced way. "He's dead right about it, Mums. I've gone with
him once or twice--and the Bridge <i>is</i> good! . . . And the
East Side has good things in it, too," he whispered generously.
"I saw some good bits there--street corners, a store front,
alleys--there's good colour--I'd like to go back some time and
paint it."</p>

<p>For the first time Mrs. Pierce broke into a robust, free and
hearty laugh.</p>

<p>"Joel!" she cried. "You can get the most insane notions in
your head of any boy I ever knew! If I didn't watch you, I
believe you'd be painting ash-cans! . . . My dear boy," she said,
laughing, "you'd better stick to what you're doing. I don't think
you've had much experience with low-life--if that's what you want
I'll find plenty of it for you right here in Rhinekill or on the
farm. . . . If you want low-life," here she paused and laughed
heartily again, "go down to Granny's tomorrow and paint the
expression of those nine maids of hers when she tells them she's
decided to bob their hair because it fits in so nicely with the
new decoration--Hah! Hah! Hah! Hah! Hah!"--Mrs. Pierce cast back
her head and laughed again, a full free hearty laugh of robust
humour in which Joel joined enthusiastically, almost suddenly,
with a face radiant with glee--"I'd just like to be there when
she tells them, that'll be low-life enough," she said.</p>

<p><i>"Simply</i> incredible!" Joel whispered, his face still
radiant with its gleeful merriment.</p>

<p>"But no," his mother went on more casually, and with humorous
tolerance. "--You finish what you're doing first--finish those
screens you're doing for Madge Telfair--then we'll talk about
low-life. . . . But I hardly think your talent lies in that
direction," she said good-humouredly but with an ironically
knowing smile. "I haven't seen your mother all these years
without finding out something about your abilities--and I hardly
think they lie in that direction. So you must stick to what
you're doing for the present--and if there's any low-life to be
done, just let <i>me</i> do the choosing. . . . Well, then, good
night," she said quietly, kindly, and good-naturedly to the young
man, as she turned to go upstairs. "Joel has told me so much
about your nocturnal habits that I was curious to meet you and
find out what you did. I'm glad to get the mystery cleared up. .
. . I suppose," she said, with an idle and detached curiosity,
"that when one is all alone and knows no one in the city, he is
driven to do almost anything for amusement. . . . Where are you
from?" she said curiously.</p>

<p>"From--from the South," he answered.</p>

<p>"Oh," she stared at him a moment longer with her cold, fixed
smile. "Yes," she said. "I can see you are. I thought so. . . .
Well, children," she said with an air of finality, "you can burn
the candle at both ends if that's what you want to do--go out and
bay the moon if you like--but not too near the house," she said
good-naturedly. "Your <i>mother's</i> going to bed. . . . Joel,"
she said quietly, "you'll be in to see me, of course, before you
turn in."</p>

<p>"Yes, Mums," he whispered, eager, radiant, his tall, thin
figure bent forward reverentially as he looked up at her, his
eyebrows arching with their characteristic expression of fine
surprise.--"But of course!" he said.</p>

<p>"Very well," she said quietly. "And now good night to all of
you."</p>

<p>Turning, she went swiftly up the stairs, a tall, magnificently
haughty figure of a woman, holding rustling and luxurious
skirts.</p>

<p>"And now," Joel whispered, when his mother had departed, "I'll
show you your room--and how to find the kitchen--and tell you
anything you want to know--and after <i>that,"</i> he whispered,
laughing and stroking his head, "you can do as you please, stay
up as long as you like--but <i>I'm</i> going to bed."</p>

<p>With these words he took his guest's valise and started up the
stairs. The young man followed him: he had been given a room on
the second floor on the river side of the house. It was a
magnificent spacious room so richly, softly carpeted that the
foot sank down with velvety firmness to a noiseless tread. The
quality of the room was the quality of the whole house--a kind of
ch&acirc;teau-like grandeur and solidity, combined with the
warmth, comfort and simplicity of a country house. Joel pressed
buttons, flooding the great room with light. The wide and snowy
covers of the great bed had been drawn back for the night. It was
a bed fit for a king, and long and spacious enough for a man of
seven feet: it waited there with a kind of still embrace, a
silent and yet animate invitation that was eloquent with the
promise of a strange and sweet repose.</p>

<p>Joel opened the door of the bathroom--it was a miracle of
shining tile and creamy porcelain and gleaming silver and heavy,
robe-like towels. Then Joel raised the shades, drew the curtains
apart and opened the window: the fragrance of the night came in
slowly, sustaining gauzy curtains on its breath of coolness like
a cloud of gossamer. And through the opened window was revealed
anew the haunting loneliness of that enchanted landscape: the
vast sweep of velvet-rounded lawn that slept in moonlight, and
the sleeping and moon-haunted woods below and to each side, and
down below them in the distance the great wink and scallop-dance
and dark unceasing mystery of the lovely and immortal river--a
landscape such as one might see in dreams, in dreams for ever
haunted by the thought of home.</p>

<p>The feeling of happiness that filled the youth was so grand,
so wonderful and so overpowering that he could not speak. It
seemed that all his life he had dreamed of one day finding such a
life as this, and now that he had found it, it seemed to him that
all he had dreamed was but a poor and shabby counterfeit of this
reality--all he had imaged as a boy in his unceasing visions of
the shining city, and of the glamorous men and women, the
fortunate, good, and happy life that he would find there, seemed
nothing but a shadowy and dim prefigurement of the radiant
miracle of this actuality.</p>

<p>It was not merely the wealth, the luxury and the comfort of
the scene that filled his heart with a sense of joy and victory.
Far more than this, it was the feeling that this life of wealth,
and luxury and comfort was so beautiful and right and good. At
the moment it seemed to him to be the life for which all men on
the earth are seeking, about which all men living dream, toward
which all the myriads of the earth aspire; and the thing, above
all, which made this life seem so beautiful and good was the
conviction that filled him at that moment of its essential
incorruptible righteousness. It seemed to him to be the most
wonderful and beautiful life on earth, not only because it
existed for the comfort and the soul-enrichment of its choice
few, but because it stood there as a beacon and a legend in the
hearts of all men living--a symbol of what all life on earth
should be, a promise of what every man on earth should have.</p>

<p>In that blind surge of youth and joy, the magic of that
unbelievable discovery, he could not estimate the strange and
bitter chance of destiny, nor ravel out that grievous web, that
dense perplexity. He could not see how men had groped and toiled
and mined, and grown blind and bent and grey, deep in the dark
bowels of the earth, to wreak this moonlight loveliness upon a
hill; nor know how men had sweated and women worked, how youth
had struck its fire and grown old, how hope and faith and even
love had died, how many nameless lives had laboured, grieved, and
come to nought in order that this fragile image of compacted
night, this priceless distillation of its rare and chosen
loveliness, should blossom to a flower of moonlight beauty on a
hill.</p>

<p>Joel took him downstairs to the kitchen before saying good
night. They crossed the hall and passed through the great
dining-room. It was also a noble gleaming room of white, as grand
and spacious as a room in a ch&acirc;teau, but warm, and
familiar, comforting as home. Then they passed through a service
corridor that connected the kitchen and the pantry with the
dining-room, and instantly he found himself in another part of
this enchanted world--the part that cooked and served and with
viewless grace, and magic stealth and instancy--performed the
labours of this enchanted house.</p>

<p>It was such a kitchen as he had never seen before--a kitchen
such as he had never dreamed possible. In its space, its order,
its astounding cleanliness, it had the beauty of a great
machine--a machine of tremendous power, fabulous richness and
complexity--which in its ordered magnificence, its vast
readiness, had the clear and glittering precision of a geometric
pattern. Even the stove--a vast hooded range as large as those in
a great restaurant--glittered with the groomed perfection of a
racing motor. There was, as well, an enormous electric stove that
was polished like a silver ornament, the pots and pans were hung
in gleaming rows, in vast but orderly profusion ranging from
great copper kettles big enough to roast an ox to little pans and
skillets just large enough to poach an egg, but all hung there in
regimented order, instant readiness, shining like mirrors,
scrubbed and polished into gleaming discs, the battered
cleanliness of well-used copper, seasoned iron and heavy
steel.</p>

<p>The great cupboards were crowded with huge stacks of gleaming
china ware and crockery, enough to serve the needs of a hotel.
And the long kitchen table, as well as the chairs and woodwork of
the rooms, was white and shining as a surgeon's table: the sinks
and drains were blocks of creamy porcelain, clean scrubbed
copper, shining steel.</p>

<p>It would be impossible to describe in detail the lavish
variety, the orderly complexity, the gleaming cleanliness of that
great room, but the effect it wrought upon his senses was instant
and overwhelming. It was one of the most beautiful, spacious,
thrilling, and magnificently serviceable rooms that he had ever
seen: everything in it was designed for use, and edged with
instant readiness; there was not a single thing in the room that
was not needed, and yet its total effect was to give one a
feeling of power, space, comfort, rightness and abundant joy.</p>

<p>The pantry shelves were crowded to the ceiling with the
growing treasure of a lavish victualling--an astounding variety
and abundance of delicious foods, enough to stock a grocery store
or to supply an Arctic expedition--but the like of which he had
never seen, or dreamed of, in a country house before.</p>

<p>Everything was there, from the familiar staples of a cook's
necessities to every rare and toothsome dainty that the climates
and the markets of the earth produce. There was food in cans, and
food in tins, and food in crocks, and food in bottles. There
were--in addition to such staple products of the canning art as
corn, tomatoes, beans and peas, pears, plums and peaches--such
rarer relishes, as herrings, sardines, olives, pickles, mustard,
relishes, anchovies. There were boxes of glac&eacute;d
crystalline fruits from California, and little wickered jars of
sharp-spiced ginger fruit from China: there were expensive
jellies green as emerald, red as rubies, smoother than whipped
cream; there were fine oils and vinegars in bottles, and jars of
pungent relishes of every sort and boxes of assorted spices.
There was everything that one could think of, and everywhere
there was evident the same scrubbed and gleaming cleanliness with
which the kitchen shone, but here there was as well that pungent,
haunting, spicy odour that pervades the atmosphere of pantries--a
haunting and nostalgic fusion of delicious smells whose exact
quality it is impossible to define, but which has in it the
odours of cinnamon, pepper, cheese, smoked ham, and cloves.</p>

<p>When they got into the kitchen they found Rosalind there: she
was standing by the long white table drinking a glass of milk.
Joel, in the swift and correct manner with which he gave
instructions, at once eager, gentle and decisive, began to show
his guest round.</p>

<p>"And look," he whispered with his soft and yet incisive
slowness, as he opened the heavy shining doors of the
refrigerator--"here's the ice-box: if you find anything there you
like, just help yourself--"</p>

<p>Food! Food, indeed! The great ice-box was crowded with such an
assortment of delicious foods as he had not seen in many years:
just to look at it made the mouth begin to water, and aroused the
pangs of a hunger so ravenous and insatiate that it was almost
more painful than the pangs of bitter want. One was so torn with
desire and greedy gluttony as he looked at the maddening plenty
of that feast that his will was rendered almost impotent. Even as
the eye glistened and the mouth began to water at the sight of a
noble roast of beef, all crisp and crackly in its cold brown
succulence, the attention was diverted to a plump broiled
chicken, whose brown and crackly tenderness fairly seemed to beg
for the sweet and savage pillage of the tooth. But now a pungent
and exciting fragrance would assail the nostrils: it was the
smoked pink slices of an Austrian ham--should it be brawny bully
beef, now, or the juicy breast of a white tender pullet, or
should it be the smoky pungency, the half-nostalgic savour of the
Austrian ham? Or that noble dish of green lima beans, now already
beautifully congealed in their pervading film of melted butter;
or that dish of tender stewed young cucumbers; or those tomato
slices, red and thick and ripe, and heavy as a chop; or that dish
of cold asparagus, say; or that dish of corn; or, say, one of
those musty fragrant, deep-ribbed cantaloups, chilled to the
heart, now, in all their pink-fleshed taste and ripeness; or a
round thick slab cut from the red ripe heart of that great
water-melon; or a bowl of those red raspberries, most luscious
and most rich with sugar, and a bottle of that thick rich cream
which filled one whole compartment of that treasure-chest of
gluttony, or--</p>

<p>What shall it be now? What shall it be? A snack! A
snack!--Before we prowl the meadows of the moon tonight and soak
our hearts in the moonlight's magic and the visions of our
youth--what shall it be before we prowl the meadows of the moon?
Oh, it shall be a snack, a snack--hah! hah!--it shall be nothing
but a snack because--hah! hah!--you understand, we are not hungry
and it is not well to eat too much before retiring--so we'll just
investigate the ice-box as we have done so oft at midnight in
America--and we are the moon's man, boys--and all that it will
be, I do assure you, will be something swift and quick and ready,
something instant and felicitous, and quite delicate and
dainty--just a snack!</p>

<p>I think--now let me see--h'm, now!--well, perhaps I'll have a
slice or two of that pink Austrian ham that smells so sweet and
pungent and looks so pretty and so delicate there in the crisp
garlands of the parsley leaf!--and yes, perhaps, I'll have a
slice of this roast beef, as well--h'm now!--yes, I think that's
what I'm going to do--say a slice of red rare meat there at the
centre--ah-h! there you are! yes, that's the stuff, that does
quite nicely, thank you--with just a trifle of that crisp brown
crackling there to oil the lips and make its passage easy, and a
little of that cold but brown and, oh!--most--brawny gravy--and,
yes, sir! I think I <i>will,</i> now that it occurs to me, a
slice of that plump chicken--some white meat, thank you, at the
breast--ah, there it is!--how sweetly doth the noble fowl submit
to the swift and keen persuasion of the knife--and now, perhaps,
just for our diet's healthy balance, a spoonful of those lima
beans, as gay as April and as sweet as butter, a tomato slice or
two, a speared forkful of those thin-sliced cucumbers--ah! what a
delicate and toothsome pickle they do make--what sorcerer
invented them--a little corn perhaps, a bottle of this milk, a
pound of butter and that crusty loaf of bread--and even this
moon-haunted wilderness were paradise enow--with just a snack--a
snack--a snack--</p>

<p>He was aroused from this voluptuous and hypnotic reverie by
the sound of Rosalind's warm sweet laugh, her tender and
caressing touch upon his arm, and Joel's soundless and astonished
mouth, the eager incandescence of his gleeful smile, his whole
face uplifted in its fine and gentle smile, his voice cast in its
frequent tone of whispering astonishment:</p>

<p><i>"Simply</i> incredible!" he was whispering to his sister.
"I've never seen such an expression on <i>any</i> one's face in
all my life! It's simply diabolical! When he sees food, he looks
as if he's just getting ready to rape a woman!"</p>

<p>"Do you, darling?" said the girl, with her warm, sweet
tolerance of humour. "I'm so glad to know that someone else likes
food. I like it, too," she said with a warm plainness; "when I am
married and start having babies I shall eat and eat and eat to my
heart's content--as much as I want to, all the things I ever
wanted, till I'm satisfied. . . . It's so wonderful to find
someone who will eat! You don't know how hard it is to have a
brother who's a vegetarian--and who tells me that I'm getting
disgustingly fat--and what a horrible thing it is to eat dead
animals--like eating corpses. . . . Wouldn't Joel be wonderful if
he ate roast beef," she added with her warm and gentle humour, as
she put her arm around her brother's waist--"he looks so thin and
starved, poor thing--like a religious ascetic--doesn't he?--But
then, he's such a saint as he is--isn't he?--if he liked food, as
well, he'd just have everything--he'd be too perfect."</p>

<p>"No, sir," Joel whispered, shaking his head and laughing with
his curiously boyish, almost clumsily na&iuml;ve, but beautifully
engaging good nature--"Not I! . . . The rest of you can eat all
the dead animals you like--but you don't catch me doing it! . . .
I'll stick to spinach," he whispered radiantly. "That's good
enough for me."</p>

<p>"I know, darling," she said with a gentle and tolerant
sarcasm. "You and Bernard Shaw: if he said baled hay was good for
you, you'd believe him, wouldn't you?"</p>

<p>He laughed in his soundless, enthusiastic and beautifully
generous way, his gaunt starved face lighting up with the
gleeful, almost diabolically brilliant radiance of his wonderful
selfless good-nature.</p>

<p>Then, turning swiftly to his firmer manner of incisive
severity--the direct and earnest concision with which he
whispered his instructions--he said abruptly:</p>

<p>"And look, Gene . . . when you finish eating put the lights
out: the switch is on the right hand by the door as you go out. .
. . And stay up as long as you like, go wherever you like, do as
you please--you'll bother no one," he whispered, ". . . and a
good walk," he continued abruptly after a moment's pause, "--is
down the road--the way you went with Ros' tonight--except that
you keep on--"</p>

<p>"Past the cows, darling," said Rosalind gently. "Past all the
lovely cows and barns and meadows of the moon."</p>

<p> </p>

<h1>LXII</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>The two young people stopped talking instantly as Eugene came
in, Joel got up and shut the door behind him, indicated an easy
leather chair, where the author could read his play most
comfortably, and sitting down again beside his sister, waited for
the play to begin.</p>

<p>Eugene began to read haltingly, with the difficulty and
embarrassed constraint of a young man just beginning to test his
powers, exhibiting his talents to the public for the first time,
and torn by all the anguish, hope, and fear, the proud
incertitude of youth.</p>

<p>It was a play called "Mannerhouse," a title which itself might
reveal the whole nature of his error--and its subject was the
decline and fall and ultimate extinction of a proud old family of
the Southern aristocracy in the years that followed the Civil
War, the ultimate decay of all its fortunes and the final
acquisition of its proud estate, the grand old columned house
that gave the play its name, by a vulgar, coarse and mean, but
immensely able member of the rising "lower class."</p>

<p>This theme--which, in its general form and implications, was
probably influenced a good deal by <i>The Cherry Orchard</i> of
Chekhov--was written in a somewhat mixed mood of romantic
sentiment, Byronic irony, and sardonic realism. The hero was a
rather Byronic character, a fellow who concealed his dark and
tender poetry under the mask of a sardonic humour; the love story
was coloured by defeat and error and departure, and the hero's
final return "years later," a lonely and nameless wanderer,
battered by the world and the wreckage of his life, to the old
ruined house in which already the rasping note of the wrecker's
crew was audible, was tempered by the romantic gallantry of
Cyrano. The final meeting with the girl--the woman that he
loved--their ultimate gallant resignation to fate and age and
destiny--was wholly Cyranoic; and the final scene, in which the
gigantic faithful negro slave--now an old man, almost blind, but
with the savage loyalty and majesty of a race of African kings
from whom he is descended--wraps his great arms around the
rotting central column of the old ruined house, snaps it in two
with a last convulsion of his dying strength, and brings the
whole ruined temple thundering down to bury his beloved master,
his hated "poor white" enemy the new owner, and himself, beneath
its ruins--was obviously a product of the Samson legend.</p>

<p>In spite of this, there was good stuff in the play, dramatic
conflict, moving pageantry. The character of the hard, grasping
but immensely able materialist of "the lower class," the newer
South, was well realized--and had been derived from the character
of the youth's own uncle, William Pentland. The scenes between
the hero and his father--the leonine and magnificently heroic
"General"--were also good; as were those between the hero and
Porter, the poor-white capitalist. Even in these romantic,
grandly-mannered scenes he had already begun to use some of the
powerful and inimitable materials of life itself and of his own
experience: the speech of Porter was the plain, rich, pungent,
earthly, strongly coloured speech of his mother, of his uncle
William Pentland, and of the Pentland tribe.</p>

<p>But the scenes between the hero and the girl were less
successful: the character of the girl was shadowy and
uncertain--a kind of phantasmal combination of the characters of
Roxane in <i>Cyrano,</i> and Ophelia--and her sweet romantic
loveliness, the yearning tenderness of her pure love, did not
provide a convincing foil and balance for the sardonic humour,
the bad and almost brutal volume of wit, with which the hero
marked his pain and love and bitterness and repulsed her
advances. (This scene, by the way, was undoubtedly influenced a
great deal by the Hamlet and Ophelia situation.)</p>

<p>Likewise--in various and interesting ways, what he had read
and seen and actually experienced had shaped the tone and temper
of his play: the character of the pompous and banal old
"Major"--the "General's" contemporary and friend and the father
of the heroine--and his conversations with the hero, in which his
conventional and pompous character is made the butt for the
biting and sardonic gibes of the latter, were also evidently
strongly coloured with the influence of Polonius and Hamlet. But
there was good stuff in these scenes as well; considerable
originality and naturalness were shown in the characterization of
the old "Major": he was, for example, trying to support the
tottering fortune of a small military school which his family had
established several generations before, and whose gigantic
futility, amid this decline of a ruined order and a vanquished
system was, in the years after the war, ironically apparent.
There was, in fact, much telling satire in this situation, and on
the whole it was well managed. Moreover, its "modern"
implications were evident: it suggested, for example, the
Southerner's pitiable devotion to a gaudy uniform and military
trappings, the profusion of ugly, trivial, cheap and brutal
little "military schools" that cover the whole South, even to the
present day, like an ugly rash, and whose "You furnish the
boy--we send back the man" philosophy is nauseous in its
hypocrisy, dishonesty, and cheap pretence.</p>

<p>There was much more that was good and pungent and original in
these scenes between the "Major" and the hero: a great deal of
the falseness, hypocrisy and sentimentality of the South was
polished off in these episodes, and "the war"--the Civil War--was
used effectively as a stalking-horse to satirize the great World
War of modern times. There was, for example, a good, and
original--on the whole, a very true--variation of the
Youth-and-Age, Old Man-Young Man conflict that was evident at
that period, and that provided the material of so many books and
plays and poems of the time.</p>

<p>In these scenes, it was very forcefully and amusingly shown
that the conflict between youth and age had in it an element of
mutual hypocrisy, a kind of mutual acceptance of a literary game
about youth and age which both young and old knew in their hearts
was false, but which both played.</p>

<p>Thus when the old "Major" would heave a melancholy sigh, and
shaking his beard with a doleful and hypocritical regret would
say:</p>

<p>"Ah yes, my boy! . . . We old men have made a sad mess of this
world. . . . We have betrayed our trust, and shown ourselves
unworthy of the confidence you young men have reposed in us. . .
. We were given the opportunity of making the world a better
place in which to live and we have left nothing but ruin,
poverty, and misery wherever we went--we have left the world in
ashes. . . . Now it is for you young men of the world--for
youth--glorious, brave and noble-hearted youth--"</p>

<p>"Ah, youth, youth," the hero would murmur at this point with a
sardonic humour that of course went unnoticed by the pompous old
fool to whom it was uttered--and the Major would nod his head in
agreement and go on--</p>

<p>"Yes, youth--brave, generous and devoted youth--it remains for
youth to repair the damage that we old men have done, to bind up
the nation's broken wounds, to see to it that the world be made
into a fit place for their children to live in, to see
that--"</p>

<p>"Government of the people, by the people and for the people,"
the hero would sardonically supply.</p>

<p>"Yes," the old Major would agree, "--and that the children of
the coming generation may not look at you, as you can look at us,
and say--'What have you done, old men, with your inheritance?
What kind of world are you leaving behind you for us <i>young</i>
men to inherit? How can you look us in the eyes, old men, when
you know that you have been unworthy of your sacred trust--that
the young men of the world have been foully tricked, betrayed,
dishonoured by you old men'--"</p>

<p>"Why, Major!" the hero would now cry, in mock astonishment, as
he ironically applauded. "--This is eloquence! Hear hear! . . .
And you are right! Major, you are right! The young men of the
world have been betrayed and tricked! Not only tricked--but
tr-r-ricked! . . . And by whom?" he would inquire with sardonic
rhetoric. "Why, by these false, lying, greedy, hypocritical old
men who have had the whole world in their keeping and who have
reduced it to a shambles for our inheritance! . . . Major, who
made the war? Who <i>sent</i> us forth to war? . . . Why, these
old, false, lying, greedy men, of course! . . . And who fought
the war? . . . Why, these brave, gallant, devoted, noble-spirited
young men, of course! . . . And why did you old men send us forth
to war, Major? . . . Why, to further your own rapacity, to
protect your own ill-gotten wealth, to conquer, ravage, and
invade for your own enrichment. . . . And how did we go to war,
Major? Why, with faith and trust and the purity of a high
conviction. . . . And how did we come back from war? With hell in
our eyes. . . . We young men always go to war with faith and
trust and the purity of a high conviction. . . . And we always
come back with hell in our eyes! Why, Major? . . . Why, because
you false, lying, greedy, selfish, and hypocritical old men of
the world have lied to us. . . . You always lie to us. And how,
Major, in what way do you lie to us? . . . Why, Major," he said
solemnly, "you tell us that war is beautiful, ideal, and
heroic--that we are going forth to fight for pure ideals, noble
faith. . . . And what do we find, Major? Why," he said, as his
voice sank to an ironically solemn whisper--"we find that war is
really <i>ugly</i>--is really cruel--horrible--base. . . . Why,
Major, do you know what we young men find when we go to war? We
find that men in war actually <i>kill</i> one another. . . . Yes,
sir," he would whisper solemnly, ". . . they <i>shoot</i> one
another--they blow one another's brains out--<i>that's</i> what
they do--why, it's murder, Major--sheer cold-blooded murder--it's
not what you said it was at all--and all of it because you old
greedy, lying, selfish men who make the wars have lied to us and
tr-r-ricked us all along!"</p>

<p>"Ah, my boy," the old "Major" would answer sorrowfully--"it is
a grievous charge you make against us--but I fear--I fear," here
his voice would sink to a dejected whisper--"I fear that it is
just."</p>

<p>In this way, a telling and satiric irony was derived from this
scene, which was well handled and might have been effective on
the stage.</p>

<p>But the most effective scene of all, perhaps, was in the
prologue of this play: here the scene was really splendid,
thrilling in its dramatic pageantry, and undoubtedly would have
been a very good and moving one upon a stage. The scene was on a
hill and showed the building of the great white house--really the
founding of a whole society. Before the unfinished house, a gun
held cocked and ready in his hands, was standing the stern and
silent figure of its founder. And before him, up and down the
hill, and in and out of the unfinished house, and past its great
unfinished columns, were moving two silent and unceasing files of
slaves, powerful black men stripped naked to the waist, bearing
upon their heads the heavy burdens of material that would go into
the house. And from the house there comes a sound of constant
hammering, and night comes, there are the flares of watchfires
and the swift and cat-like passing of the great black forms. A
moment's flare of insurrection, the spring of a great negro at
the stern and lonely figure of the man, the flash of a knife, and
the rebel falls, knocked senseless by a blow from the stock of
the master's gun.</p>

<p>Then, another white man from the neighbouring town--the
minister: the minister's low persuasive voice urging the man to
see the crime of slavery, quoting the Scriptures with a telling
aptness, urging him to repent, to join the life of town and
church, to "come to God" . . . And the quiet and inflexible
answer of the master: "I must build my home."</p>

<p>And nothing finally but night and dullness; the great figures
of the slaves pad past in darkness, as noiseless as cats, and
from the mystery of night there rises now the wailing chant of
all the jungle, the lamentation of man's life of toil and grief
and bitter labour, the chant of the slave.</p>

<p>This was a fine scene, and should have been beautiful and
moving on a stage.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>From this description it will be seen how the young man's play
was made up both of good and bad, how strongly it was marked by
the varied influence of his reading and idolatry--by Shakespeare,
Chekhov, Shaw, Rostand, the Bible--and how he had also already
begun to use some of the materials of his own life and feeling
and experience, how even in this groping and uncertain play, some
of the real grandeur, beauty, terror, and unuttered loneliness of
America was apparent.</p>

<p>Thus the play, with all its faults and imitations, really did
illustrate, as few things else could do, the confused incertitude
and the flashes of blind but powerful intuition, which mark the
artist's early life here in America, and for this reason chiefly
the play was interesting.</p>

<p>And feeling this incertitude as he sat down to read the
play--that feeling mixed of hope, of fear, of quivering
apprehension which the artist feels when for the first time he
releases his work from the lonely prison of creation and lets it
go then, irrevocably, to stand upon its own feet, meet the naked
eye of the great world without protection, and stand or fall upon
its own merits--feeling this fatality of release, this
irrevocable finality of action, he began to read the play in a
halting, embarrassed, and almost inaudible tone, full of the
proud and desperate hope, the trembling apprehension, the almost
truculent hostility towards imaginary detractors which every
young man feels at such a time.</p>

<p>He sensed quickly that his fears were groundless. No man ever
had a more generous, enthusiastic and devoted following than he
had that morning in the presence of these two fine young
people--Joel Pierce and his sister Rosalind.</p>

<p>He saw--or rather <i>felt</i> at once--their rapt and
fascinated attentiveness. Joel sat, his gaunt figure hinged
forward on his knees, in an attitude of tense, motionless and
utterly silent interest: from time to time as the young dramatist
glanced up from his great sheaf of written manuscript he could
see Joel's lean gaunt face fixed on him, uplifted, with its
strangely pure and radiant eagerness, and Rosalind, her warm and
strong young hands clasped quietly, folded in her lap, her warm
and lovely face flushed with excitement, her eyes luminous, vague
and tender, as if she were really in a theatre seeing the figures
in the play pass before her invested in all the magic that the
stage could give to them, displayed an interest that was more
relaxed and more abstracted than her brother's, but none the less
absorbed.</p>

<p>The sense and sight and assurance of these things acted like a
powerful and gloriously intoxicating liquor on his heart and mind
and spirit. He felt an overpowering surge of warm affection,
proud and tender gratefulness towards Joel and his sister. It
seemed to him that they were the finest people he had ever
known--the most generous, the truest, highest, and the
loyalest--and the knowledge that they liked his play--were in
fact conquered and possessed, brought out of themselves and laid
under the play's power and magic--his <i>own</i> power and
magic--overwhelmed him for a moment with a feeling of the purest,
highest, and most glorious happiness that life can yield--the
happiness that is at once the most selfish and the most
selfless--the happiness of the artist when he sees that his work
has been found good, has for itself a place of honour, glory, and
proud esteem in the hearts of men, and has wrought upon their
lives the spell of its enchantment. At that instant he saw, in
one blaze of light, an image of unutterable conviction, the
reason why the artist works and lives and has his being--the
reward he seeks--the only reward he really cares about, without
which there is nothing. It is to snare the spirits of mankind in
nets of magic, to make his life prevail through his creation, to
wreak the vision of his life, the rude and painful substance of
his own experience, into the congruence of blazing and enchanted
images that are themselves the core of life, the essential
pattern whence all other things proceed, the kernel of eternity.
This is the reason that the artist lives and works and has his
being: that from life's clay and his own nature, and from his
father's common earth of toil and sweat and violence and error
and bitter anguish, he may distil the beauty of an everlasting
form, enslave and conquer man by his enchantment, cast his spell
across the generations, beat death down upon his knees, kill
death utterly, and fix eternity with the grappling-hooks of his
own art. His life is soul-hydroptic with a quenchless thirst for
glory, and his spirit tortured by the anguish of possession--the
intolerable desire to fix eternally in the patterns of an
indestructible form a single moment of man's living, a single
moment of life's beauty, passion, and unutterable eloquence, that
passes, flames and goes, slipping for ever through our fingers
with time's sanded drop, flowing for ever from our desperate
grasp even as a river flows and never can be held. This is the
artist, then--life's hungry man, the glutton of eternity,
beauty's miser, glory's slave--and to do these things, to get the
reward for which he thirsts, with his own immortality to beat and
conquer life, enslave mankind, utterly to possess and capture
beauty he will do anything, use anything, destroy anything--be
ruthless, murderous and destructive, cold and cruel and merciless
as hell to get the thing he wants, achieve the thing he values
and must do or die.</p>

<p>He is at once life's monstrous outcast and life's
beauty-drunken lover, man's bloody, ruthless, pitiless and
utterly relentless enemy, and the best friend that mankind ever
had: a creature compact of the most selfish, base, ignoble,
vicious, cruel and unrighteous passions that man's life can
fathom or the world contain, and a creature whose life with all
its toil and sweat and bitter anguish is the highest, grandest,
noblest, and the most unselfish, the most superbly happy, good
and fortunate life that men can know, or any man attain. He is
the tongue of his unuttered brothers, he is the language of man's
buried heart, he is man's music and life's great discoverer, the
eye that sees, the key that can unlock, the tongue that will
express the buried treasure in the hearts of men, that all men
know and that no man has a language for--and at the end he is his
father's son, shaped from his father's earth of blood and sweat
and toil and bitter agony: he is at once, therefore, the parent
and the son of life, and in him life and all man's nature are
compact; he is most like man in his very differences, he is what
all men are and what not one man in a million ever is; and he has
all, knows all, sees all that any man on earth can see and hear
and know.</p>

<p>This knowledge came to him that morning as he read the play
that he had written to his two friends: as he went on with his
reading, and felt with a proud triumphant joy and happiness the
sense of their devotion, his voice grew strong and confident, the
scenes and words and people of the play began to flame and pulse
and live with his own passion--the whole play moved across his
vision in flaming images of beauty, truth and loveliness, his
spirit rose on the powerful wings of a jubilant conviction, a
tremendous happiness, his heart beat like a hammer-stroke and
seemed to ring against his ribs with every blow the music of this
certitude.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>It took him about two hours to read the play: when he finished
he felt a sense of triumphant finality, an immense and joyful
peace within him, and he waited for them to speak. For a moment
there was utter stillness: Joel sat bent forward in the same
position, his head supported by his lean hand; Rosalind sat
quietly; neither moved an inch. In a moment Joel spoke, nodding
his head and speaking with a kind of matter-of-fact assertiveness
that was far more wonderful and thrilling than any idolatrous
warmth of praise could have been:</p>

<p>"Yes," he whispered, nodding his head thoughtfully,--"it's as
good as <i>The Cherry Orchard</i>--I like it better, myself--but
it's as good." His manner now did take on an electric energy: he
straightened sharply, and speaking almost sternly, with a blazing
earnestness of conviction, he looked his friend in the eyes, and
cried: "Eugene! . . . It's simply magnificent! . . . It's
<i>easily</i> the greatest play anyone in this country ever
wrote. . . . There's nothing else to touch it . . . it's
<i>miles</i> ahead of O'Neill . . . it's . . . it's as good as
<i>Cyrano,</i> and you've got to admit," he said, nodding his
head decisively, ". . . that's pretty great. . . .
<i>Cyrano's</i> pretty swell," he whispered, ". . . And those
scenes between the boy and the old 'Major' . . . they're simply
grand," he whispered. "I mean, I didn't know you had it in you .
. . that kind of writing, the satiric kind. . . . But it's . . .
it's," his face flushed, he nodded his head doggedly, and almost
grimly, as if willing to stand up for his conviction against the
whole world, "it's . . . it's as good as <i>Shaw!"</i> And he
laughed suddenly his radiant, soundless laugh and whispered
drolly, ". . . And when I say anything's as good as Shaw . . .
you've got to admit that's going pretty far for me. . . . Ros',"
he said quietly, turning to the girl, "what do you think? . . .
Don't you think it's pretty grand?"</p>

<p>For a moment she did not answer; her eyes were luminous as
stars and far away.</p>

<p>"Oh," she said presently in her low and sweet and lovely young
voice, "it's wonderful. . . . It's the most gloriously beautiful
thing I ever heard. . . . Darling," she said, and took his hand
between her strong, warm and living hands, as she had done the
night before, ". . . you are a great man . . . a great writer. .
. . I am so proud and happy to have known you . . . to be allowed
to hear your play."</p>

<p>He felt the overpowering, thrilling happiness and joy, the
blind speechless gratefulness, and the helpless and agonizing
embarrassment that a young man feels at a moment like this. He
did not know what to say, what to do, how to express the
gratefulness, the affection, the tenderness that he felt towards
them; he turned to Joel, his mouth moving wordlessly and
helplessly, and could say nothing, he made a baffled and
inarticulate movement of the hands, and ended up by putting his
arms around Rosalind and hugging her in a clumsy, helpless
fashion, which was perhaps as good a thing as he could do, and
said all he wished to say.</p>

<p>It was not what these two young people had said to him that
gave the moment a strange imperishable loveliness. Even in the
blind surge of joy and happiness that swept over him and made him
passionately want to believe that his play was as good as Joel
and his sister said it was, that he was really the great man, the
great writer they had called him, a grain of judgment remained
and saved him from an utter self-deception. And curiously, for
that very reason, his joy was somehow greater, his feeling of
triumphant happiness sweeter than if what they had said were
true. For in the very idolatry of their devotion, the
enthusiastic exaggeration of their praise, there was all the
blind but noble loyalty of youth, the beautiful and generous
admiration of youth, that is so fine, so good, so high, so proud
with faith and confidence and loyalty, and because of this, so
right. It was for this reason that, even after years had passed
and he had perhaps accomplished better work, earned more valid
praise, he would yet remember that morning with a peculiar sense
of proud and tender gratefulness. It brought back to him, as
nothing else on earth could do, the beauty and the innocence of
youth, the extravagance of its blind devotion that is so mistaken
and so wonderful, the generous enthusiasm of its loyal faith that
is so wrong and yet so right, its noble sincerity that burns
brightly even in its grievous error, and that is somehow more
true than fact, more real than glory, and more lasting and more
precious than man's fame.</p>

<h1>LXIII</h1>

<p> </p>

<p>When they came out on the verandah, Joel's mother, Howard
Martin, and Joel's cousin, Ruth, had just driven up before the
entrance and were getting out. They had been to the swimming
pool--a small but delightful one a half-mile away in a green
hollow, tree-embowered--and all three were in bathing costume.
Howard Martin trod gingerly across the drive and on to the warm
brick flooring of the porch, on white, wincing, well-kept feet;
Mrs. Pierce and the girl wore light bathing-robes and walked
firmly, with assurance. Mrs. Pierce's figure was as slender and
as well-conditioned as the girl's--her ankles and her legs were
wonderfully graceful, strong and slender--but in comparison to
her niece's black and white voluptuousness--her dark and sullen,
almost brooding, face and her swelling creamy thighs, her lavish
belly and her melon-heavy breasts--the figure of Mrs. Pierce was
lacking in seduction: it had the strength and slenderness of
youth without youth's warmth and freshness; it had, like
everything about her, a chilled and glacial perfection that spoke
of stern regimen, grim watchfulness, and unflagging
effort--"keeping fit."</p>

<p>As the two young men came up, Mrs. Pierce turned gracefully,
her hand upon the screen-door, and with a smile awaited them. Her
teeth were so solid, white, and perfect in their alignment that
it was difficult to see where they joined together, and they
sometimes suggested twin rows of solid gleaming ivory more than
individual teeth: this circumstance also contributed to the
glacial, detached and almost inhuman quality of her smile. She
greeted her son's friend with a kindly but detached "Good
morning," and without altering the rigid brilliance of her smile
a jot, turned to her son and said:</p>

<p>"I thought you were coming to the pool. What happened to you
and Ros'?"</p>

<p>These words were spoken quietly and matter-of-factly:
nevertheless, the suggestion of strong displeasure and annoyance
was somehow unmistakable.</p>

<p>Joel answered quickly, whispering a swift concerned
explanation, his thin figure slightly bent forward, his gaunt
face lifted, eagerly, radiantly concerned, in that attitude of
devoted and solicitous respect that characterized his relations
with every woman, but that was extremely marked when he spoke or
listened to his mother:</p>

<p>"I know, Mums," he whispered swiftly, apologetically,--"I'm
<i>terribly</i> sorry--but he promised to read his play to us and
that took all morning. . . . <i>Mums!"</i> he went on in his
astounded and enthusiastic whisper, "it's <i>simply</i>
magnificent--I wish you could have been there to hear it."</p>

<p>"Oh," said Mrs. Pierce quietly, and turning, for a moment she
regarded her son's friend with that glacially brilliant smile of
her thin and faintly carmined lips that never changed or altered
in expression by an atom. "Oh," she said, "I should like
to--perhaps you will read it to me some time."</p>

<p><i>"Simply</i> superb," Joel whispered, "it really is."</p>

<p>"And now you boys had better get ready for lunch," she said in
a more warm and friendly tone. "You know how Granny hates it if
people get there late."</p>

<p>With these words she went into the house and mounted the
stairs. The young men followed her: at the foot of the stairs
Joel turned and said to his visitor:</p>

<p>"Look--I'd hurry as much as I could! . . . We've only twenty
minutes: you've just got time to bathe and dress."</p>

<p>Bathe and dress! The youth looked at his young host with a
bewildered, uncomprehending face, and with a sinking feeling in
his heart. What did they expect him to do--what, according to the
formula of these strange rare people, was one supposed to do when
one was invited out to lunch? He had bathed that morning when he
got up, it seemed to him that he must still be very clean, and as
for dressing, he had just one suit of clothes in all the world,
and that was the suit he was wearing at that moment. And just one
day before, when he had left New York to come to this magical,
unbelievably glorious place, he had thought, in his miserable
na&iuml;ve ignorance, that this one suit of clothes, three
shirts, three pairs of socks, and a change of underwear were
abundantly sufficient to all the demands that fashion and a
week-end visit could possibly make on him. At that moment, as he
stared at his friend with a gaping mouth, unable to reply, the
terrific impact of this new world which had stunned him the night
before with its magnificence and beauty exploded in his brain in
a flare of stars and rockets. And for a moment now he felt a
lost, sickening desperate terror, and curiously, a feeling of
blind resentment against his friend. For a moment he felt tricked
and deceived--deceived by Joel's modesty, his exquisite humility,
by the frayed and shabby clothes he had worn in Cambridge and New
York, by the over-refinement of his breeding, which had caused
him to conceal utterly his true state of life, never to suggest
by a word or reference the kind of life that he came from, the
wealth, the luxury, the magnificence of the world in which he had
been born and lived.</p>

<p>"D-d-dress! . . . But . . . how--," his face reddened, he
craned his neck doggedly, and suddenly blurted out:</p>

<p>"Dress? In what? This is the only suit I've got!"</p>

<p>"But of <i>course!"</i> Joel whispered, arching his eyebrows
in astounded surprise. "What's wrong with that? . . . You can
wear a dark coat anywhere--all that I meant was that you could
wear white flannels with it."</p>

<p>"Flannels!" the other said, "I have no flannels, Joel. . . .
This suit is all I've got to wear; if I can't wear this, I can't
go."</p>

<p>"But of course you can wear it!" Joel cried, concealing any
surprise he may have felt with the instant impatient agreement of
his tone. "It's <i>perfectly</i> all right--only," his eyes were
thoughtful for a moment, he considered swiftly--"Look here!" he
said abruptly, "would you like to wear a pair of mine? I'm not as
tall as you are, but perhaps you can make them fit. . . . And if
you can't," he said quickly, "it's <i>perfectly</i> all right--it
doesn't matter in the slightest--it's only," and his eyes for an
instant had a faintly perturbed expression, "--it's only that
Grandfather belongs to the old school--oh, he's <i>swell,
simply</i> magnificent; you'll like him the moment you see
him--the only reason I dress when going there is that he's got
old-fashioned standards--and he's so <i>grand</i>--I do
everything I can to please him--But come on!" he whispered
quickly, "I'll give you a pair of mine, and you can wear them if
they fit--and if they don't--it doesn't matter in the
slightest."</p>

<p>They went upstairs then to Joel's room; he gave his friend a
pair of striped flannel trousers, and the other departed
dutifully to bathe, put on a clean shirt and collar and the
flannel trousers--which proved, indeed, a very tight precarious
fit, but which were made to do--and thus correctly garmented, he
joined the family and the other guests, and they drove away to
Mr. Joel's house.</p>

<p>The great rambling old house which had been so lovely in the
moon-enchantment of the night before was no less beautiful by
day. It sat there in the hollow of the hill, embowered in rich
green and shaded by the leafy spread of its great maples, with
the homely, pure, and casual loveliness that the old houses of
New England have.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Old Mr. Joel himself was just as grand and imposing a
personality as Joel had indicated. He was, indeed, in Joel's
word, "stupendous"; a figure of leonine magnificence and gallant
gentility, who might have stepped forth from a page of Thackeray.
He was already past his seventieth year, but his body was still
strongly, vigorously set: he was somewhat above the middle
height, but his neck and shoulders had a kind of massive strength
that suggested he had been a powerfully built man in his prime.
His white mane of hair was soft as silk and gave his wide brow
and ruddy, pleated old man's face a kind of noble lion-like
fierceness, and this impression was enhanced by his grizzled
moustache and his old, rather growling voice, which had in it
nothing surly or ill-tempered, but rather a kind of old and noble
masculinity, an aristocratic kind of growl that seemed perfectly
adjusted to a kind of Pendennis-like language, a
"Dammit-all,-sir,-it's-not-the-fellow's-drinking-that-I-mind,-it's-only-that-he's-proved-himself-incapable-of-holding-his-liquor-like-a-gentleman"
kind of voice.</p>

<p>The inference was warranted: even as they stood there in a
spacious, airy big room, the guests standing and talking in
groups, drinking small glasses of a fine dry sherry, the youth
could hear Joel's eager whispering voice engaged in earnest, but
respectful, debate, with his leonine grand-sire, and Mr. Joel's
nobly growled out answers. The conversation was about
books--about the artist's right to use the materials of his own
experience and conversation--and it hinged particularly upon a
certain book in which the writer had apparently made use of
personal letters and private documents that people he knew, a
woman chiefly, had written him.</p>

<p>"No, sir," Mr. Joel growled, "I do not care what the
circumstances may be or what the nature of the work. If I had a
friend, sir, who would deliberately make public letters which a
woman had written him, why, sir, I should drop him from my
acquaintance--I should be forced to conclude, sir,"--here the old
growling voice fell to an ominous whisper of irrevocable
judgment, and he looked out at his grandson with a fierce glint
of his old eyes under bushy brows--"I should be forced to
conclude, sir, that he was nothing but a cad," old Mr. Joel
whispered, and with a suddenly fierce glint of his old eyes, a
sudden movement of his leonine head, he growled out in a low and
savage tone: "And I should tell him so, sir. I should be
compelled to tell him that he was nothing but a cad!"</p>

<p>"Yes, grandfather," Joel whispered eagerly, his thin figure
bent forward in an attitude of devoted and attentive
reverence--"But after <i>all,</i> some pretty great people have
done it--Rousseau did it, and <i>The Confessions</i> are pretty
great, you know--You've got to admit that.--And Byron did it in
his poems--at least, everyone knew whom he was talking about, and
then there was De Musset and George Sand."</p>

<p>"It makes no difference, sir," growled Mr. Joel implacably,
"it makes no difference who they were or how great they may be
considered in the realm of art, or how great the work they did
may be--if I knew a man who did a thing like that, I should be
forced to consider him a low cad--no matter how great a poet or a
writer, or how great his work might be--I should consider him a
cad,--and"--his old growling voice fell to a whisper of boding
and implacable judgment--"I should tell him so, sir. I should let
him know that I considered him a cad."</p>

<p>Such was Joel's grandsire, Mr. Joel, and surely he was a
specimen of which any group or class could well be proud: of all
that Hudson River aristocracy he was justly venerated and
esteemed as one of its noblest and proudest adornments. He had
lived a long, honourable, and successful life; and now in his old
age he had retired to the bosom of his paternal earth to spend
his last years in dignity and simple ease and in calm but
fruitful reflection on his rich experience. He was writing a
book, and in advance it could be solemnly averred that he would
make no use in it of any letters that a woman ever wrote to
him.</p>

<p>What man, therefore, could speak with greater weight about the
duties, codes and principles of man? What man was better
qualified to know the rules of honour and the standards of a
gentleman--and to assert a truth that might have gone unnoticed
by a person of a baser spirit and a lower quality--that Rousseau
was a scoundrel and De Musset and Lord Byron a couple of low
cads--"because, sir, they made public letters that a woman wrote
them."</p>

<p>It was indeed delightful to find such Thackerayan gallantry,
such Olympian scorn for knavish genius and for the lives of
mighty poets dead and gone who illuminated mankind with their
radiance but had their own light put out--must dwell for evermore
"a couple of low cads," in outer darkness, never again to be
received, acknowledged, given gracious pardon by the chivalric
flower of the Hudson River rich. How wretched that stern judgment
must have made Rousseau! What bitter news for Byron! What misery
for De Musset!</p>

<p>But now a woman servant entered and announced that lunch was
served. The chattering groups of people turned and formed
instinctively, and by a kind of native respect, into files of
deferential waiting, until Mr. Joel had passed. He led the way, a
grand and leonine old man, superbly garmented in a coat of soft,
rich blue, wide loose white flannels, wound at the waist by a
great sash of yellow silk--an adornment that seemed in no way
inappropriate but superbly fitting the noble dignity of the old
man.</p>

<p>At the door he paused and stood aside, with a grizzled majesty
of courtesy, for his wife and the other ladies of the group to
pass. Then he entered the dining-room, followed by his grandson
and the other young men. The dining-room was another light,
spacious, and graciously beautiful room in the old New England
style: through the open windows one saw the deep green and gold
of trees and flowers in the embowered magic of the setting, and
the fragrance of sweet drowsy air breathed on the curtains and
flowed through the room.</p>

<p>The snowy table had a great bowl of fresh-cut wood flowers in
the centre: the food was also native, plain old American, and
superbly cooked: there was a thick pea-soup, fried chicken, plump
and tender, done superbly to a juicy, delicately encrusted brown:
there were candied sweet potatoes, string beans, cooked the
Southern way with the succulent sweet seasoning of pork, stewed
golden corn, and creamy mashed potatoes, a deep smooth gravy,
rich and brown and thick, sliced tomatoes and sliced cucumbers,
no alcoholic beverages, but iced tea, cold and tall and fragrant
in high tinkling glasses rimed with ice, flaky biscuits, smoking
hot, and for dessert, fresh apple-pie, hot and crusty, hued with
cinnamon and flanked by thick fresh squares of pungent yellow
cheese.</p>

<p>It was, in short, a plain but wholesome and most appetizing
meal, completely American in its flavour and abundance, and
superbly cooked, most fitting to this house; the simple green and
natural, casual beauty of the place, the life, the people, the
homely gracious hospitality of democracy.</p>

<p>It is true, the meal was also rather Southern in its cooking
and its quality--a fact that was not surprising, however, when
one remembered that Mr. Joel's present wife had been a famous
Southern belle from the blue-grass region of Kentucky.</p>

<p>One not only remembered this fact, it was difficult for one
not to remember it; Mrs. Joel herself made her romantic origins
evident. Although she was a woman in her early sixties with white
hair, she was still remarkably preserved, and her manners,
graces, dimpled smiles, her roguish glances and her languishing
soft drawl were still the familiar stock-in-trade of the
Dixieland coquette.</p>

<p>She was certainly what is called "a fine figure of a woman";
her figure was tall, spacious, amply proportioned, her face,
although beginning to show the signs of age--a slightly wrinkled
plumpness like the skin of a full but slightly withered
apple--was still almost as soft and white and tender as a
child's: she had almost all her natural teeth and they were white
and pearly, her hands were white and plump and fine, her voice
had the refined and throaty burble that is familiar in the
majestic American female of the upper crust, and she dimpled
beautifully when she smiled.</p>

<p>It was rather uncomfortably evident at once that there was a
strong, if suppressed, hostility between Mrs. Joel and her
step-daughter, Joel's mother.</p>

<p>The struggle between the two was for the possession of
something that neither of them any longer had--youth. Both were
obviously enamoured of youth--of the freshness of youth, the
warmth, the charm, the grace, the vitality of youth. Both hated
the idea of growing old: both bitterly and desperately refused to
admit the possibility of growing old. Mrs. Joel was able to cast
over her soul a spell of hypnotic deception, and by absurdly
flaunting around the graces, airs and manners of a coquette, to
convince herself that she was young and beautiful, able to
enslave every man she met under the domination of her captivating
charm.</p>

<p>And Mrs. Pierce felt bitterly that the older woman had had her
day, that she should be willing to admit her years, gracefully
submit, and take a back seat. This ugly rivalry was now apparent
in almost everything they said, and gave everyone at the table a
feeling of tension, embarrassment and discomfort. Thus, Mrs.
Joel, speaking to her step-daughter, and including the whole
company, in a reference to Mrs. Pierce's strenuous pursuit of
youth, her grim devotion to youth's figure and its vigorous
gymnastics, now remarked in a tone of sugared venom, a malicious
gaiety of fine surprise:</p>

<p>"But really, I do, I think it's the most astonishing thing to
see a woman of your age take part in all these sports and games
that only the <i>young</i> people of my generation played. . . .
After all, if you were twenty--the age of Joel or this young
man--I could understand it better--but at <i>your</i> age, my
dear,"--she drew a fine breath of astonishment, "--really, I
marvel that you don't collapse."</p>

<p>"Do you?" said Mrs. Pierce, smiling her glacial and inflexible
smile, and in a tone of cold, impassive irony--"I confess,
Mother, I see nothing at all to marvel at. . . . Please set your
mind at rest--I assure you I'm not in the slightest danger of
collapse. . . . I can do everything," she went on grandly, "that
I could do at twenty--and I can do it better now, with less
fatigue and greater skill. . . . I can hold my own with any of
these young people around here, no matter what it is--whether
swimming, golfing, playing tennis, or going for a walk. So you
can save your sympathy, Mother," she concluded with a laugh which
seemed casual and friendly enough, but which showed plainly the
hard inflexibility of her antagonism, "--when I need your
condolences I'll let you know."</p>

<p>"But, my <i>dear,"</i> said Mrs. Joel with sweet gushing
malice--"I think it's ma-a-rvellous! I only wonder how you do it
at your age! . . . Why, no girl of my time and generation would
have <i>thought</i> of doing all the things you do every day
without turning a hair--Why!" she breathed, looking around her
with an air of fine amazement, "I hear Ida plays <i>five</i> sets
before breakfast every morning and thinks nothing of it--but in
<i>my</i> day and time, if a girl--a <i>young</i> girl, mind
you--played a <i>single</i> set--she'd be positively
exhausted--done up for a week."</p>

<p>"Perhaps, Mother," Mrs. Pierce coolly suggested, "that is why
the young girls of your time were such a soft and grubby lot--and
why they turned out to be such dowdy frumps later on."</p>

<p>Mrs. Joel's dimpled smile did not lose a single atom of its
saccharine benevolence, nor did her voice alter by a shade its
honeyed drip, but for a moment something bright and adder-like
passed across her eyes, and she gave her step-daughter a swift
and poisonous glance that would have done credit to a snake.
"--And then, of course," she went on sweetly, taking the young
men at the table into her confidence with her dimpled smile--"we
had such old-fashioned notions in those days, too--you boys, I
know, would be amused if you could know what some of our quaint
notions were--but--hah! hah! hah!"--she laughed a gay and silvery
little laugh of envenomed hatred, "--my dear," she said to Joel,
"--you'll have to laugh when I tell you--but do you know it was
actually considered <i>immodest</i>--<i>unwomanly</i>--for a
young girl of my time to take part in sports--<i>compete</i> in
sports--against men--and as for a woman of Ida's age doing
it--why, it was <i>unthinkable! unheard</i> of!--a middle-aged
woman," she pronounced the words with obvious relish and for a
moment there was a swift hard flexion of the muscles in Mrs.
Pierce's jaw--"but a middle-aged woman in <i>my</i> day who had
attempted such a thing would have been <i>ostracized</i>--an
<i>outcast</i>--decent people would have had nothing to do with
her!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know, Mother," Mrs. Pierce said with a swift and
glacial urbanity. "We've all heard about that--I think it's
generally conceded now by most intelligent people that women of
that generation were a pretty worthless, dull and barbarous
lot."</p>

<p>"Ah-hah-hah!" Mrs. Joel laughed sweetly, and dimpled at her
best--<i>"terribly</i> old-fashioned, of course--but," she turned
graciously to her grandson's young guest and lavished on him her
most dimpled smile,--<i>"frightfully</i> amusing, don't you
think?"</p>

<p>He reddened like a beet, looked helplessly at the two
contesting women, craned his neck nervously along the edges of
his collar, and finally said nothing.</p>

<p>Joel relieved the painful situation with his swift whispering
grace of tact and kindliness. "But really, Granny," he whispered
courteously and eagerly, "--Mums is awfully good at it, she
really is. . . . She can beat me two sets out of three in tennis,
and give me ten strokes in golf--and when it comes to
<i>swimming</i>--"</p>

<p>"Oh," said little Howard Martin in his mincing, languishing,
and effeminate tone--"she's ma-a-rvellous! . . . Ida," he gushed,
in a kind of over-ripe ecstasy--"your diving is simply divine! .
. . If you could only show me--oh-h," he said, with gushing
effeminacy--"if you could only teach <i>me</i> how you do it--but
it's <i>simply</i> perfect--<i>marvellous</i>--"</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>The meal now proceeded more smoothly. Mr. Joel seemed to take
small notice of the feud between the two women--his daughter and
his wife--he talked to Joel, Rosalind, and to the other young men
in his grand growling way, expressed his opinion on the
candidacies of Davis and Coolidge, and said he would vote for
Davis.</p>

<p>"If John Davis gets in," said Mrs. Pierce with that positive
worldly assurance that characterized her opinions, "Charles Dana
Gibson will get the ambassadorship to England--oh, but
<i>that's</i> settled!" she said positively, "I happen to know
that Dana Gibson can have the ambassadorship any time he wants
it--"</p>

<p>"Providing Davis gets elected," Joel whispered, laughing.
Turning to his grandfather, he whispered respectfully, "What do
you think, Grandfather? Do you think that Davis will get in?"</p>

<p>"No, sir," Mr. Joel growled, "I do not. I think his chances of
getting elected are <i>very</i> slight--unless some sudden
upheaval turns the tide in his direction before election
day."</p>

<p>"And whom will you vote for, sir?" Joel whispered.</p>

<p>"I shall vote for Davis, sir," growled Mr. Joel. "I have known
him for many years, he is a very able lawyer, a very <i>able</i>
man--but, sir,"--his old growling voice sank to a whisper, and he
peered out fiercely from under his grizzled eyebrows at his
grandson--"his chances of election are very slight indeed. I
should not be surprised to see Coolidge win by a land-slide."</p>

<p>"Did you hear what Alice Longworth said about him?" said Mrs.
Pierce laughing, "--that he looked as if he had been weaned upon
a pickle."</p>

<p>Everyone laughed, even Mr. Joel joining with a kind of
growling chuckle. As for Joel, he bent double, radiantly,
gleefully convulsed with soundless laughter, snapping his fingers
softly as he did so. His own humorous invention was not fertile,
but his love of a good story--particularly when his mother or one
of his friends told it, or quoted one of their own group--was
enthusiastic. Now for a moment he bent double with this
convulsed, whispering laughter: when he recovered somewhat he
said softly and slowly:</p>

<p><i>"Simply</i> swell . . . Gosh!" he whispered admiringly.
"What a wit she's got! It's a swell story," he whispered.</p>

<p>"By the way, Ida," Mr. Joel growled, tugging at his short and
grizzled moustache, "how is Frank? Have you been over to see
them, lately?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Father," she answered, "we drove over last Tuesday and
spent the evening with them. . . . He looks very well," she
added, in answer to his question, "but, of <i>course,"</i> she
said decisively, "he's <i>never</i> going to be any better--they
all say as much--"</p>

<p>"Hm," old Mr. Joel growled, tugged reflectively at his short
and grizzled moustache for a moment longer, and then said: "Has
he been taking any part in the campaign this summer?"</p>

<p>"Very little," she answered--"of course, the man has gone
through hell these last few years--he's suffered agonies! He
seems a little better now, but"--her voice rose again on its tone
of booming finality as she shook her head--"he'll never get back
the use of his legs again--the man is a <i>permanent</i>
cripple," she said positively--"there's no getting around it--and
he himself is reconciled to it."</p>

<p>"Hm," growled old Mr. Joel again, as he tugged at his short
moustache--"Pity! Nice fellow, Frank! Always liked him! . . . A
little on the flashy order, maybe--like all his family . . . too
easy-going, too agreeable . . . but great ability! . . .
Pity!"</p>

<p>"Yes, isn't it!" Joel whispered with soft eager sympathy.
"And, Grandfather," he went on with an eager enthusiasm, "--his
charm is <i>simply</i> stupendous! . . . I've never known
anything like it! . . . The moment that he speaks to you he makes
you his friend for ever--and he <i>knows</i> so much--he has such
interesting things to say--really, the amount he knows is
<i>simply</i> stupendous!"</p>

<p>"Hm, yes," old Mr. Joel agreed with a consenting growl, as he
tugged thoughtfully at his grizzled grey moustache, "--but a
little superficial, too. . . . The whole lot is like that . . .
go hell-for-leather at everything for three weeks at a time--and
then forget it. . . . Still," he muttered, ". . . an able
fellow--very able. . . . Pity this thing had to happen to him
just at the start of his career."</p>

<p>"Still, Father," Mrs. Pierce put in, "--don't you think he'd
gone about as far as he was going when this thing hit him? . . .
I mean, of course, he <i>is</i> a charming person--everyone
agrees on that. I never knew a man with more native charm than
Frank--But for all his charm, don't you think there's something
rather weak in his character? . . . Do you think he would have
had the stamina and determination to go much further if this
disease hadn't forced him to retire?"</p>

<p>"Um," Mr. Joel growled, as he tugged thoughtfully at his short
cropped moustache. ". . . Hard to say. . . . Hard to tell what
would have happened to him. . . . A little soft, perhaps, but
great ability . . . great charm . . . and great opportunists,
everyone of them. . . . Have instinctive genius for seizing on
the moment when it comes. . . . Never know what's going to happen
to a man like that--"</p>

<p>"Well," said Mrs. Pierce, politely, but with an accent of
conviction--"he might have kept on going--but I think he was
through--that he'd gone as far as he could--I don't think he
could have stood the gaff--I don't believe he had it in him."</p>

<p>"Um," Mr. Joel growled, "perhaps you're right. . . . But great
pity just the same. . . . Always liked Frank. . . . Very able
fellow--"</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>The conversation proceeded in these channels for some time,
the guests discussing politics, ambassadorships, using the names
of the great and celebrated people of the earth with the casual
and familiar intimacy of people talking about lifelong friends
whom they had last seen at dinner Tuesday evening. It was the
"inside" of the great world of wealth and fame and fashion--the
world that the youth had read and heard about all his life--but
that he had thought about, had visioned, as Olympus, mantled in
celestial clouds, and for ever remote from the intruding gaze of
common men. Now, to hear these great names, these celestial
personages, bandied about on the tip of the tongue just as
familiarly as one spoke of one's own friends--to hear these
people speak of the habits, the health, the conversation, and the
personal home-life of this august parliament in just the same way
that people spoke of their friends, acquaintances and familiars
the whole world over, gave the youth a sense of living in a
dream, of hearing incredible things--things incredible because of
their very casual familiarity--of being the witness of an
incredible event.</p>

<p>In this way, the meal drew to its close: Mrs. Pierce and her
step-mother managed to avoid further friction, although once it
threatened, when Mrs. Pierce, observing the retreating figure of
one of the maid-servants--a robust and plain-featured
countrywoman of middle age--noticed from the cropped and
unnaturally white texture of her neck and skull that her hair had
been cut, "bobbed" in the fashion that was to grow so popular and
that was just then coming into style, and turned and questioned
her step-mother about it:</p>

<p>"What has happened to that woman's hair, Mother?" she said.
"What did she do to it?"</p>

<p>"Why," cried Mrs. Joel eagerly, beginning to beam and dimple
around at her guests with an air of delighted satisfaction--"I
had it cut off."</p>

<p><i>"You</i> had it cut off?" cried Mrs. Pierce in an astounded
tone.</p>

<p>"Why, yes, my dear," chirped Mrs. Joel eagerly, "I sent all
the girls into the village one morning last week and had the
barber cut their hair."</p>

<p><i>"What!"</i> Mrs. Pierce boomed out in an astounded tone,
and then sank back against her chair, and for a moment returned
her son's stare incredulously, "you mean you herded all these
girls together and <i>whacked</i> their hair off at one
stroke?"</p>

<p>"Why, of course, my dear," said Mrs. Joel eagerly, in a rather
excited and disturbed tone, "--or rather, I told them that they'd
have to do it--that that was what I wanted."</p>

<p>"What <i>you</i> wanted?" Mrs. Pierce boomed out in the same
astounded and incredulous tone.</p>

<p>"Why, yes"--Mrs. Joel rushed on eagerly, excitedly, taking the
whole table in now with a look of beaming explanation. "--You
see, I had the whole house done over this spring--redecorated--I
told the decorator the <i>effect</i> I wanted," she said
gushingly--"I told him everything must be done
for--for--<i>lightness!"</i> she said triumphantly,
"--<i>coolness! . . .</i> to do everything in light cool colours
. . . get <i>that</i> effect. . . . So last week," she went on
happily, "when we had that spell of <i>frightful</i> hot weather,
I noticed suddenly how--how <i>hot</i>--and disagreeable all the
girls looked with their long hair--how--how <i>out of place,"</i>
she said triumphantly, "they looked in this new scheme of things.
. . . Ugh," she shuddered with a little gesture of discomfort and
distaste, "--the very <i>sight</i> of them made me
uncomfortable--I couldn't <i>bear</i> them! So all of a sudden it
occurred to me how nice it would be--how much it would improve
the--the--the general <i>atmosphere</i> of the whole house if I
made them bob their hair. . . . So," she concluded, beaming
around at everyone with dimpled satisfaction--"that's how I came
to do it--I called them all together one morning last
week--Friday, I think it was--and told them what I wanted--and
then sent them all into the village to get it done."</p>

<p>There was a moment's pause while Mrs. Joel beamed at her
guests with a dimpled smile of triumphant finality that seemed to
say--"There! Behold my work and marvel at it! That is the way the
thing was done." Her obvious satisfaction was suddenly disturbed,
however, by Mrs. Pierce, who, after staring at her in astounded
silence for a moment, boomed out incredulously:</p>

<p><i>"Mother!</i> You <i>know</i> you didn't do a thing like
<i>that!"</i></p>

<p>"But--but, of course I did it, Ida," Mrs. Joel returned in a
surprised and nettled tone of voice--"That's what I'm telling
you. . . . What's the matter with it? . . . Don't you think the
girls look nice?"</p>

<p>"I--think," said Mrs. Pierce slowly, after a moment's stunned
reflection--"I--think--that--is--the--most--preposterous--the--most--highhanded--the--most--<i>
God!"</i> she cried, and throwing her head back she fairly made
the room ring with her hearty, booming, and astonished laughter:
"I've heard of Catherine the Great and Marie Antoinette and the
days of the Medicis--and the things they did--but I never thought
I'd live to see the day their methods were adopted here in free
America--Why! hah! hah! hah! hah! hah!" she fell back in her
chair and fairly rocked with booming and incredulous
laughter--<i>"whacking</i> the hair off those eight girls at one
fell stroke because--because--" her voice choked
speechlessly--"because it made you <i>hot</i> to look at them . .
. because--because," her voice rose to a rich choked scream and
presently she said in an almost inaudible squeak--"because she's
had the house--<i>redecorated,"</i> she panted--"Why,
<i>Mother!"</i> she cried strongly at last, her shoulders
shaking, and her face still red with laughter, "--the King of
Siam is not in it compared to you--you make absolute tyranny look
like free democracy--hah! hah! hah! hah! hah!--Strike off their
heads!" cried Mrs. Pierce, "--the very <i>sight</i> of them makes
me perspire!" And leaning back again she surrendered herself to
free, ringing, and whole-hearted laughter, in which everyone save
Mrs. Joel joined. When the laughter had somewhat subsided, Mrs.
Joel, her plump white cheeks red with open anger, cried out in a
furious voice:</p>

<p>"I don't agree with you! . . . I don't agree with you at all.
. . . And I must say it seems very stupid of you, Ida, to take
such a childish point of view."</p>

<p>"Childish!" Mrs. Pierce cried in a challenging tone, "you're
the one who's childish! . . . If I did a thing like that to
<i>my</i> girls--if I for one moment thought I had a right to
take such liberties as that with other people, I'd feel like a
fool! . . . Why, Mother," she cried in a strong protesting tone,
"wake up! . . . What kind of a world do you live in, anyway? . .
. Whatever gave you the notion that you have a right to do things
like that to other people--and all because you're fortunate
enough to be able to keep servants and pay them wages. . . . Wake
up! Wake up!" she cried in a tone of almost furious indignation,
"--You're not living in the Dark Ages, Mother. . . . Slavery has
been abolished! . . . This is the twentieth century! . . . Why,
it's absurd!" she cried scornfully, and with two spots of angry
colour in her cheeks--"the most arrogant and high-handed thing I
ever heard in all my life--The whole thing's preposterous--I only
hope that no one hears about it."</p>

<p>"If you feel that way about it," Mrs. Joel began in a voice
choked with fury--and at this moment Joel came to the rescue and
saved what really threatened to develop into an ugly, open,
painful quarrel between the two women--</p>

<p>"Oh, but Granny," he whispered--"I'm sure the girls don't mind
a bit! . . . And they look <i>much</i> nicer--and <i>much</i>
cooler--without their hair than when they had it--I'm sure they
feel that way about it, too."</p>

<p>"Well," Mrs. Joel began, still very angry but somewhat
placated by her grandson's tactful intervention--"I'm glad to see
that someone still has a little common sense."</p>

<p>And in this way the trouble was finally smoothed out by Joel's
quick diplomacy, and the guests, eager to avert another painful
scene between the two women, rose to go. And it was in this way
that they departed, not without a final explosion of booming and
astounded laughter from Mrs. Pierce as she walked out towards her
car, a final hilarious reference to "redecoration," and the King
of Siam, and the modern prototype of Catherine the Great.</p>

<h1>LXIV</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Joel and his friend did not return immediately to the house
with Joel's mother and her other guests. Instead, leaving old Mr.
Joel's house, they turned left, and struck out for a walk through
the fields and slopes and wooded country of the great estate. The
day was hot, the broad fields brooded in the powerful and
fragrant-clovered scent of afternoon, the woods were dense with
tangled mystery, immensely still and green, yet dark incredibly,
and filled with drowsy silence, brooding calm, ringing with the
lovely music of unnumbered birds, alive with the swift and sudden
bullet-thrum of wings, and haunted with the cool and magical
incantation of their hidden waters.</p>

<p>It was the wild, sweet, casual, savage, and incredibly lovely
earth of America, and of the wilderness, and it haunted them like
legends, and pierced them like a sword, and filled them with a
wild and swelling prescience of joy that was like sorrow and
delight.</p>

<p>They toiled upward through the tangled forest-jungle of a
wooded slope, and down again into the cool green-gladed secrecies
of a hollow, and up through the wild still music of the woods
again and out into the great rude swell of unmown fields, alive
with all their brooding potency, their powerful and silent energy
of the hot and fragrant earth of three o'clock, the drowsy and
tremulous ululation of afternoon.</p>

<p>Their feet trod pathways in the hot and fragrant grasses;
where they trod, a million little singing things leaped up to
life, and hot dry stalks brushed crudely at their knees: the
earth beneath their feet gave back a firm and unsmooth evenness,
a lumpy resiliency.</p>

<p>Once in a field before them they saw a tree dense-leaved and
burnished by hot light: the sun shone on its leaves with a naked
and un-green opacity, and Joel, looking towards it, whispered
thoughtfully:</p>

<p>". . . Hm . . . It's nice, that--I mean the way the light
falls on it--It would be hard to paint: I'd like to come out here
and try it."</p>

<p>And the other assented, not, however, without a certain
nameless desolation in his heart that broad and naked lights, the
white and glacial opacity of brutal day aroused in him--and
wanting more the wooded grove, the green-gold magic of a wooded
grass, the woodland dark and thrum and tingled mystery, and the
sheer sheeting silence of the hidden water.</p>

<p>It was a swelling, casual, nobly lavish earth, for ever
haunted by a drowsy spell of time, and the unfathomed mystery of
an elfin enchantment, the huge dream-sorcery of the mysterious
and immortal river.</p>

<p>It was what he had always known it to be in his visions as a
child, and he came to it with a sense of wonder and of glorious
discovery, but without surprise, as one who for the first time
comes into his father's country, finding it the same as he had
always known it would be, and knowing always that it would be
there.</p>

<p>And finally the whole design of that earth, with the casual
and powerful surveys of its great fields, its dense still woods
of moveless silence ringing with the music of the birds, its
far-off hills receding into time as haunting as a dream, and the
central sorcery of its shining river--that enchanted thread which
ran through all, from which all swept away, and towards which all
inclined--was unutterably the language of all he had ever thought
or felt or known of America: the great plantation of the earth
abundant to the sustenance of mighty men, and enriching all its
glamorous women with the full provender of its huge compacted
sweetness, an America that was so casual and rich and limitless
and free, and so haunted by dark time and magic, so aching in its
joy with all the bitter briefness of our days, so young, so old,
so everlasting, and so triumphantly the place of man's good
earth, his ripe fulfilment and of the most fortunate, good, and
happy life that any man alive had ever known.</p>

<p>It changed, it passed, it swept around him in all its
limitless surge and sweep and fold and passionate variety, and it
was more strange in all its haunting loveliness than magic or a
dream, and yet more near than morning and more actual than
noon.</p>

<p>It was a hot day: the two young men walked along with their
coats flung back across their shoulders: towards five o'clock as
they were coming home again, and coming down into the wooded
hollow where Mr. Joel lived, Joel turned, and with a slight flush
of embarrassment on his gaunt face, said:</p>

<p>"Look--do you mind wearing your coat when we go by
Grandfather's house?--you can take it off again when we get out
of sight."</p>

<p>He said nothing, but silently did as his friend requested, and
thus correctly garmented they passed the old man's great white
house and crossed the little wooden bridge and stared up again
out of the hollow, taking a foot-path through the woods that
would lead them out into the road near Miss Telfair's house: she
had invited them to tea.</p>

<p>And curiously, inexplicably, of all that they had said and
talked about together on that walk, these two things were later
all he could remember:--his friend's eyes narrowed with
professional appraisal as he looked at the hot opacity of the
sun-burnished tree and said, "--hm . . . It's nice that--the
light is interesting--I'd like to do it;" and the embarrassed but
almost stubbornly definite way in which Joel had asked him to put
on his coat as he went past "Grandfather's place." He did not
know why, but that simple request aroused in him a feeling of
quick and hot resentment, a desire to say:</p>

<p>"Good God! What kind of idol-worship is this, anyway? Surely
that old man has been made of the same earth as all the rest of
us--surely he's not so grand and rare and fine that he can't
stand the sight of two young men in shirt-sleeves going by his
house! . . . Surely there is something false, inhuman, barren in
this kind of reverence--no real respect, no decent human
admiration, but something cruel, empty, worthless and untrue, and
against the real warmth and worth and friendliness of man!"</p>

<p>For a moment hot resentful words rose to his lips: that act of
empty reverence seemed to him, somehow, to be arrogant and
disdainful of humanity; he felt a sudden blind resentment, a
choking anger against old Mr. Joel and his grand manners and his
growling and magnificent old age: he wanted to bring back again
the conversation he had overheard at lunch, to ask Joel bitterly
who the hell he thought this old man was that he could grandly
dispose of man according to his judgment as "low cads," as
"gentlemen"--to inquire savagely who the hell this damned
contriving, cunning old custodian of the treasures of the rich
thought he was that he could arrogate unto himself the power to
pronounce banishment on his betters--to call Rousseau a rascal,
and De Musset and Lord Byron "a couple of low cads."</p>

<p>And childish, foolish as this anger was in all its blind
unreason, he was to remember these two trifling episodes in later
years with a feeling of regret and nameless loss. These two acts
on Joel's part--the one an act of barren interest--a joyless
empty interest in the blind opacity of light--and the other an
act of barren joyless reverence to old age and an inhuman
state--seemed to mark for him the beginning of his gradual
separation from his friend, a dumb, inexplicable and sorrowful
acceptation of their fatal severance. It seemed to him that here
began that slow, and somehow desperately painful recognition that
the enchanted world of wealth and love and beauty, of living
fulfilment and of fruitful power, which he had visioned as a
child in all his dreams about the fabled rich along the Hudson
River--did not exist; and that he must look for that grand life
in ways stranger, darker, and more painful in their labyrinthine
complications than any he had ever dreamed of as a child; and
that, like Moses, he must strike water from the common stone of
life, and like Samson, take honey from the savage lion's maw of
the great world, find all the joy of living that he lusted for in
the blind swarm, the brutal stupefaction of the streets; goodness
and truth in the mean hearts of common men; and beauty in the
only place where it can ever be found--inextricably meshed,
inwrought, and interwoven in that great web of horror, pain and
sweat and bitter anguish, that great woven fabric of blind
cruelty, hatred, filth and lust and tyranny and injustice, of
joy, of faith, of love, of courage and devotion--that makes up
life and that resumes the world.</p>

<p>It was a desolating loss, a hideous acknowledgment, a cruel
discovery--to know that all the haunted glory of this enchanted
world, which he thought he had discovered the night before, had
been just what it now seemed to him to be--moon-magic--and to
know that it was gone from him for ever. It was a bitter pill to
know that what had seemed so grand, so strong, so right, and so
inevitable at the moment of discovery was now lost to him--that
some blind chemistry of man's common earth, and of his father's
clay, and of genial nature, had taken from him what he seemed to
possess, and that he could never make this enchanted life his own
again, or ever again believe in its reality. It was a desperate
and soul-sickening discovery to know that not alone through
moonlight, magic, and the radiant images of their heart's desire
could men find America, but that somewhere there, and far
darklier and strangelier than the river, lay the thing they
sought, in all the blind and brutal complications of its
destiny--buried there in the grimy and illimitable jungles of its
savage cities--a-prowl and raging in the desert and half mad with
hunger in the barren land, befouled and smutted with the rust and
grime of its vast works and factories, warped and scarred and
twisted, stunned, bewildered by the huge multitude of all its
errors and blind gropings, yet still fierce with life, still
savage with its hunger, still broken, slain and devoured by its
terrific earth, its savage wilderness--and still, somehow, God
knows how, the thing of which he was a part, that beat in every
atom of his blood and brain and life, and was indestructible and
everlasting, and that was America!</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Miss Telfair's house, which they now entered, was just the
sort of house that one would expect a woman like Miss Telfair to
live in. Everywhere one looked, one saw the image of the woman's
personality--and that personality was fragile, exquisite,
elegant, and elaborately minute. In spite of its graceful, plain
proportions, that house was not wholly a comfortable place to be
in. It was filled with ten thousand little things--ten thousand
little, fragile, costly, lovely and completely useless little
things, and their profusion was so great, their arrangement so
exquisitely right, their proximity so immediate and overwhelming
that one instantly felt cramped, uneasy, and uncomfortable,
fearfully apprehensive lest a sudden free and spacious movement
should send a thousand rare and terribly costly little things
crashing into shattered bits, the treasure of a lifetime
irretrievably lost, and one's own life and work and future
irretrievably mortgaged, blighted, wrecked, in one shattering
instant of blind ruin. In short, in Miss Telfair's lovely,
exquisite and toy-becluttered house, one felt very much like a
delicate, sensitive, intelligent and highly organized bull in a
horribly expensive china-shop, and this feeling was cruelly
enhanced if one was twenty-three years old and six and a half
feet tall, and large of hand and foot, and long of arm and leg in
just proportion, and painfully embarrassed, and given to sudden
and convulsive movements, and keyed and strung on the same wires
as a racehorse.</p>

<p>It was an astonishing place, about as exquisitely feminine a
place as one could imagine. One had only to take a look round to
feel that no man had ever lived here, that the only man who ever
came here had come as a visitor; and somehow one felt at once he
knew the reason why Miss Telfair had not married--she simply did
not want to have "a man about the place," a disgusting, clumsy
brute of a man who would go plunging round like a wild bull,
sending her vases crashing to the floor, upsetting her fragile
little tables and all the precious little bric-&agrave;-brac that
crowded them, sprawling out upon the voluptuously soft but
elegantly arrayed cushions of the sofa, reaching for matches on
the mantel and sweeping it clear of a half-dozen dainty
eighteenth-century clocks and plates and china shepherds with one
swinging blow, barging into dainty little stools of painted china
and sending it a-teeter while Miss Telfair watched and prayed and
waited with a smile of frozen apprehension, raising hell with the
Wedgwood plates, the vases of Dresden and of Delft, and making
the buried kings of the old Ming dynasty turn over in their
graves with groans of anguish every time some brute of a bull of
a man came lumbering near the dearest and most priceless
treasures of their epoch.</p>

<p>Miss Telfair, herself the most dainty, fragile, and
exquisitely inviolable ornament of the collection, was waiting
for them at the centre of this fabulous clutter. She gave each of
the young men a quick cool clasp of her small, frail,
nail-bevarnished hand, a few crisp words of greeting, and a quick
light smile, as brittle, frail, and painted as a bit of china--a
smile curiously like that of Mrs. Pierce in its glacial rigidity
but, like everything else about the woman, more fragile,
delicate, and shell-like.</p>

<p>Then she turned and led the way through the house out into the
sun-porch. The two young men picked their way carefully between
the frail and crowded complications of a thousand costly relics
and around great bowls and vases filled with flowers--great
bouquets of roses, lilies and carnations, which were
everywhere--and which filled the air with the clinging, dense,
and overpowering sweetness of their perfumes.</p>

<p>The sun-parlour was a great, light place, alive and golden
with bright sunlight--a magnificent room with comfortably padded
wicker chairs and tables and settees, but here, as elsewhere in
the house, the fabulous complication of small useless ornaments
was overwhelming, and one walked with care. This room also was
filled with great bowls of roses, lilies and carnations, the air
was dense and heavy with their scent, and through the windows of
the place one could see the smooth velvet of the lawns, trimly
patterned with designs of flowers aflame with all their glorious
polychrome of colour, and at the end the flower-garden, which was
alive with many rich and costly blooms growing in geometric
designs. It was just the kind of flower-garden, just the kind of
flowers, that a woman like Miss Telfair would have: their
orderly, exotic and unnatural profusion suggested the cultivation
of a hot-house; even the wild and lyric growth of sweet unordered
nature had been made to conform to the elegant and fragile
pattern of Miss Telfair's life.</p>

<p>She led the way to a wicker table where there were easy chairs
and a comfortable settee and great flaming fragrant lights of
flowers. They seated themselves and tea was brought in by a
maid-servant. The service of the tea was fragile, costly,
elegant, like everything else about the woman; but it was also
wonderful, rich, and generous in its abundance, and this was
probably like her, too. There were delicate little pastries,
cubes, and crusts of things that were so flaky, rich and
succulent that they melted away in the mouth; and there were
little cubes and squares of sandwiches as well, all dainty,
elegant, and small, but wonderfully good. She asked them if they
wanted hot-tea or iced-tea or some whisky: the day was hot and
Joel took iced-tea, refusing whisky; the other youth took
iced-tea too--she poured it for them in marvellous tall frail
glasses filled with slivers of bright ice, and put in mint and
lemon, doing all things deftly, beautifully, with her small,
swift, china-lovely hands, and then turning to Joel's guest, with
her light cool smile, her crisp incisive inquiry, in which there
was somehow something good and generous, she said:</p>

<p>"And won't you have some whisky, too?" and as he hesitated,
and looked dubious yet consenting, added: "In your iced-tea--if
you like it that way?"</p>

<p>He looked at her, perplexed, and said uncertainly:</p>

<p>"I--don't know. . . . Does it go that way?"</p>

<p>Miss Telfair bent back her head--her cheeks had the delicate
colour of rose-tinted china, and she was pretty in the
rose-tinted-china way--and laughed a thin, metallic, and yet
musical and friendly laugh.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes!" she cried briskly and gaily, "it goes that way! . .
. It goes very well that way." More seriously, she added: "Yes,
it's really very good that way"--and crisply, yet encouragingly,
with her fire-bright china-smile--"why don't you try it?"</p>

<p>He looked at Joel dubiously, not certain what to do, and not
wishing to embarrass his friend, and Joel looked back, with his
radiant eager smile, shaking his head in droll refusal,
whispering:</p>

<p>"Not for me. But go on if you like. Do as you like--"</p>

<p>"Well, then--" he said consentingly--and Miss Telfair, smiling
lightly, took a bottle of Scotch whisky off the tray, uncorked
it, and poured a drink into the tea--a good stiff shot it was,
too--and when he had finished the drink, she poured him out
another, adding another liberal potation of the Scotch.</p>

<p>Thus animated and released, he felt more at ease: they talked
together quickly and easily; he had a good time. She was a
bright, quick, cool, inquiring kind of woman, at once detached
yet friendly, coolly amused yet curious: she asked him about his
work at the university, the kind of classes that he taught and
the kind of people that attended them, the kind of life he had in
the city, and about the play that he was writing. The detached
coolness of her curiosity was much like that of Mrs. Pierce, and
suggested the curiosity of a woman of a separate and privileged
world hearing about the creatures who lived in the great nameless
world of dust and noise and strife and swelter "down below"--and
yet it was also a more friendly and eager curiosity than Mrs.
Pierce had shown: it had a certain warmth of human interest in
it, too.</p>

<p>She was obviously very fond of Joel: her relation to him was
that of an old-maid friend of the family, who is so intimate and
close to all the family's history that she is practically a part
of it herself, and who feels for the children and all their lives
and actions as much affection and interest as she could feel for
her own blood. Now she turned to Joel, and began to talk to him
about some decorative screens which he was painting for her: as
one might expect, she knew all about decorative screens and their
respective merits; she spoke of them with the exact authority,
the assured conviction of the expert, she spoke her mind about
them crisply, plainly, incisively, and Joel listened to her
eagerly, his gaunt face lifted, turned towards her in an attitude
of rapt attention and respect, while she was talking.</p>

<p>"The central one is excellent, Joel--really first-rate, the
best one you've ever done--and <i>decidedly</i> the best of the
lot. The one on the right is also good--not as good as the first,
it swings off-balance in the foreground. I'll show you what I
mean tomorrow--but it is good, and will do."</p>

<p>"What about the other one--the one on the left?" he whispered
eagerly. "What did you think of that?"</p>

<p>"I think it's very, very bad," she said coolly and incisively.
"I think you've fallen down on it, and that you're going to have
to do the whole thing over again."</p>

<p>For a moment his gaunt face winced, but not with pain and
disappointment, rather with swift, concerned interest, eager
attentiveness: he hitched his long thin figure forward
unconsciously, his large well-boned hands splayed out upon his
knees, and he whispered eagerly:</p>

<p>"But why, Madge? . . . Tell me. Where do you think I've fallen
down?"</p>

<p>"Well," said Miss Telfair, "in the first place, Joel, you've
lost out on your design--It falls all to pieces now, you've let
the whole thing get away from you: you were trying to follow it
out from the one in the middle and bring it to an end, but you
didn't know how to finish it--and so you put in that pavilion or
summer-house or whatever it is--because you didn't know what else
to do."</p>

<p>"Don't you like that?" he whispered, smiling.</p>

<p>"I think it's perfectly god-awful," she answered quietly,
"utterly meaningless--simply terrible! It has no relation to
anything else in the whole design--it stands out like a sore
thumb--and the colour is atrocious. . . . No, Joel, the whole
thing is out of key, it upsets the whole design, it has no place
there."</p>

<p>"And what about the background?" he whispered. "What did you
think of that?"</p>

<p>"I think that's bad, too," she replied without a moment's
hesitation. "You've used <i>far, far</i> too much gold--almost
twice as much as you did in the other two--the proportion is very
bad."</p>

<p>"Hm," he muttered, stroking his chin thoughtfully. "Yes," he
whispered, "I see what you mean. . . . I hadn't thought about the
pavilion being out of key--perhaps you're right. . . . But," he
whispered, smiling his radiantly gentle and good-natured smile,
"I <i>don't</i> agree with you about the background being bad,
nor that I have used too much gold on it. But I will argue with
you about that."</p>

<p>"All right," she answered crisply and good-naturedly. "I'll
come over tomorrow and we'll have it out. . . . But," she shook
her head, and spoke with a crisp but obstinate conviction, "Joel,
I <i>know</i> I'm right! . . . That whole screen is out of
proportion. It <i>won't</i> do. . . . You'll have to do the whole
thing over again."</p>

<p>They debated in this fashion of art-talk for some time, and
presently the young men rose to go. As they departed, Miss
Telfair returned to her former tone of crisp and casual
friendliness, saying:</p>

<p>"What is Ida doing tonight? Is she going to the Pastons' for
the fireworks?"</p>

<p>"Yes," Joel whispered. "We're all going; can't you come
along?"</p>

<p>"No, thank you," she said, smiling. "Not this time. They're
very lovely--and very awe-inspiring--and all that--but about once
every five years is my limit. I would <i>not</i> get into that
mob tonight, as hot as it is, for a million dollars. . . . Tell
Ida I expect her here for lunch tomorrow: Irene will be here. . .
. And now, good-bye," she said, turning to the other young man,
and giving him a bright china smile, a swift cool pressure of her
little china hand. . . . "Come up again to see us, won't you? . .
. And bring your play along. And try going to bed some night at
ten o'clock. . . . Really!" she said with a crisp cool irony,
"--you miss very little by doing so."</p>

<p>As they walked away along the road towards Joel's house, Joel
whispered with his radiant and admiring astonishment:</p>

<p>"She's s<i>imp-ly</i> incredible! . . . Don't you <i>think</i>
so? . . . She <i>knows</i> everything," he went on, without
defining more exactly that large specification. "It's simply
<i>stupendous</i> the things she knows! . . . And she's
<i>such</i> a nice person," he said quietly. "One of the
<i>nicest</i> people that I ever knew--just what an old maid
ought to be--don't you think so?"</p>

<p>"Yes. But why is she an old maid? Why did she never get
married?"</p>

<p>"Hm," said Joel thoughtfully, looking down the road with a
detached, abstracted stare. "I can't say. . . . She's
<i>awfully</i> rich," he whispered. <i>"Enormously</i> rich--she
has loads of money--she's been able to do <i>just</i> as she
pleased all her life--she's <i>been</i> everywhere--all over the
world--and I suppose that's the reason that she never married.
She never found anyone that she liked well enough to give up the
kind of life she had. . . . But she's an amazing person. . . .
Don't you think so?"</p>

<p>"Yes," the other said.</p>

<p>They walked on down the road, and presently they saw the great
white shape of Joel's house, framed in the trees before them, and
below them in the light and distance of a westering sun, the
shine and wink of the great river. They entered the house.</p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h1>LXV</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>The Paston estate, like the Pierce estate, was situated upon
the river, but several miles farther north. To reach it, they
drove through the eastern entrance of the Pierce place and
through the little Dutch Colonial village of Leydensberg, of
which Joel's father was the mayor and which the Pierce family
largely owned.</p>

<p>"It's a pity Pups never went into politics," Joel whispered,
as they drove through the old leafy village, with its pleasant
houses among which a few of the lonely white houses of the
Colonial period still remained. "The people around here worship
him: he could have anything he wanted if he ran for office."</p>

<p>It was the first time he had spoken of his father: with a
feeling of sharp surprise, the other youth now remembered that he
had not seen Mr. Pierce since his arrival: he wondered where he
was, but did not ask. He also now remembered that Joel's
references to his father had often been marked by a note of
resignation and regret--the tone a person uses when he speaks of
someone who has possessed talents and wasted opportunities, and
whose life has come to nothing.</p>

<p>Their road led northward from the village: they sped swiftly
along a paved highway bordered by trees and fields and woods, by
houses here and there, and presently by the solid masonry of a
wall that marked the boundaries of another great estate. It was
the Paston place, and presently they turned in to an entrance
flanked by stone-markers, and began to drive along a road arched
by tall leafy trees. Night had come, the moon was not yet well
up, but from time to time there was beside the road the gleam of
steel, and at times as they passed a cleared space he could
plainly see the rail pattern of a tiny railway, complete in all
respects--with roadbed, rock-ballast, grades, and cuts,
embankments, even tunnels, but all so small in scale that it
suggested a gigantic toy more than anything else. He asked what
it was and Joel answered:</p>

<p>"It's Hunter's railway."</p>

<p><i>"Hunter's</i> railway?" he asked in a puzzled tone. "But
why does he need a railway here? What does he use it for?"</p>

<p>"Oh, he really doesn't need it for anything," Joel whispered.
"It's of no use to anyone. He just likes to play with it."</p>

<p>"Play with it? But--but what is it? . . . Isn't it a real
railway?"</p>

<p>"Yes, of course," Joel answered, laughing at his astonishment.
"It's really quite marvellous--complete in every way--with
tunnels, stations, bridges, signals, round-houses, and everything
else a regular railway has. Only everything is on a very small
scale--like a toy."</p>

<p>"But the engine--the locomotive? . . . How does that run? Do
you wind it up, as you do a toy, or run it by electricity, or
how?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no," Joel answered. "It's a regular locomotive--not over
two or three feet high, I should say--but runs by steam, just
like a real locomotive. . . . It's really quite a fascinating
thing," he whispered. "You ought to see it some time."</p>

<p>"But--but how does he run it? Is he able to get into anything
as small as that?"</p>

<p>"He can, yes," said Joel, laughing again. "But usually he just
runs along by the side. It's pretty cramped quarters for a grown
man."</p>

<p>"A grown <i>man! . . .</i> Do you mean that Mr. Paston built
this little railway for himself?"</p>

<p>"But, of <i>course!"</i> Joel turned, and looked at his friend
with a surprised stare. "Whom did you think I was talking
about?"</p>

<p>"Why, I--I thought when you said--'Hunter' you meant one of
his children--a boy--some child in his family who--"</p>

<p>"No, not at all," Joel whispered, laughing again at the
astonished and bewildered look upon his companion's face. "It may
be for a child, but the child is Hunter Paston himself. . . . You
see," he said more quietly and seriously after a brief pause,
"he's crazy about all kinds of machinery--locomotives,
aeroplanes, motor-boats, motor-cars, steam-yachts--he loves
anything that has an engine in it--he always has been that way
since he was a boy--and it's such a pity, too," he whispered, in
the same regretful tone he had used when speaking of his
father--"It's a shame he was never able to do anything with it. .
. . If he hadn't had all this money, he would have made a
<i>swell</i> mechanic--he really would."</p>

<p>But now there was a row of lights through the trees, the
murmurous hum of many voices, the glittering shapes of parked
machinery. They were approaching the Paston house: it was a
rather gloomy-looking mansion of old brown stone, square in shape
and immensely solid and imposing in its grimy magnificence, and
of that style of architecture which was borrowed from France, but
which went through curious and indefinable transformations on the
way, so that any native grace and lightness which the style may
once have had was lost: it was lumpish, ugly and involved, and
somehow looked like one of the children of the New York Post
Office.</p>

<p>A broad veranda ran around the house on all four sides, and on
the side that faced the river, a large number of the friends and
guests of the Paston family were now assembled. Seated on the
great lawns that swept away before the house on the riverside
there was another larger audience composed of the people of the
near-by town, and people employed on the Paston estate and the
other great estates in the vicinity.</p>

<p>But over both groups, not only the wealthier and smaller group
upon the porch, but the larger one spread out upon the lawn,
there was evident a spirit of gay, happy, eager and child-like
elation and expectancy that united everyone in a curiously moving
and high-hearted way. From the dark sweep and mystery of the lawn
there rose the murmur of hundreds of excited and happy voices,
all talking at once, and little bursts of laughter, sudden stirs
and flurries of eager and mysterious interest.</p>

<p>The same spirit, the same feeling--a spirit and a feeling of
plain democracy, warm friendliness, simple, eager hope and
expectancy--animated the people on the porch. They were, as a
group, fine-looking people: many of the young men were tall,
handsome, strong and comely-looking, the girls were lovely, and
many of the women were beautiful. Most of them also had a look of
dignity, assurance, and character. They represented, he knew,
that small group of the fabulously wealthy whose names were
household words throughout the nation--and yet, whether it was
due to the innate democracy of the occasion, the almost childish
pleasure and anticipation which the Fourth of July and its
fireworks renewed in them, and the grand and natural warmth and
spaciousness of the scene--their native earth, or whether the
quality of their lives was really warm and free and friendly,
there was nothing at all arrogant, haughty, cold or insolently
"societyfied" about these people. Their gathering together here
upon the front porch of this gloomy old Victorian house had
exactly the same quality that these summer front-porch gatherings
had always had for him everywhere in little towns; with a feeling
of incredulous recognition he found that the scene was instantly
familiar to him, and he almost expected to hear old familiar
voices--his father's voice among them, as he had heard it on the
porch at home so many times, and now so long ago.</p>

<p>Everyone in the crowd knew the Pierce family and instantly
welcomed them in an eager, laughing, and excited babel of
affectionate greeting. Rosalind and Joel and Mrs. Pierce went
about among the crowd shaking hands and greeting people all about
them, and when the greetings were over, simply and naturally
found their place among those persons to whom each was most akin
by virtue of friendship, age, or temperament--Mrs. Pierce among
men and women of her own generation and among the older people,
and Joel, Rosalind, George Thornton, and Carl Seaholm among the
younger people of the gathering.</p>

<p>Joel introduced him quickly, casually, with his infinite grace
and consideration, to several people--to several of his younger
friends and to certain of the older ones who were obviously among
the best-liked and most respected people there. He was introduced
to Mrs. Paston, a tall and beautiful young woman, very slender,
blond, and lovely-looking: a kind of exquisite blond icicle, and
with no more human warmth or passion than an icicle of any sort
would have. She gave him a few cool words of greeting, a swift
cool clasp of her swift cool hand, a swift, glacial, yet not
unfriendly smile, and so dismissed him, not unkindly, turning
with the same cool, smiling and glacial detachment to her other
guests.</p>

<p>Suddenly the fireworks started. Far away, at the end of the
great lawn, in the obscuring darkness of the night, and among the
obscuring shadows of the shrubs and trees above the hill that
swept down towards the river, there was a terrific
detonation--the deafening bang and flare of a gigantic rocket
that whizzed up into the air in a small hurtling point of light,
and exploded, illuminating heaven with a constellation of
enchanted falling stars. There was a long-drawn "Oh-h!" of
excitement, eagerness, and expectant joy from the crowd gathered
on the lawn, the same from the people gathered on the porch, who
quickly scrambled into chairs; and instantly from all the people
there was utter silence, a thrilled and fascinated attentiveness,
broken now and then by gasps of wonder, joy, surprise and
rapture, as one giant rocket followed another in unending series,
in constantly growing magnificence, until the whole universe of
night was blooming with flowers of fire, alive with
constellations of enchanted stars--green, red, and yellow, blue
and violet and gold--that burst softly in the night with
spreading glory, falling slowly to the earth like some great
parachuted blossom, and cracking, puffing, bursting softly, to
flower, spread, again develop in great blooms of star-enchanted
fire.</p>

<p>Everything had the same familiar quality of America that he
had always remembered and known as a child. It brought back to
him again the quiet voices of people on their summer porches, the
street-car grinding to a halt on the corner of the hill above his
father's house, his father's voice in darkness on the porch, and
the red lifted flare of his cigar, and those Thursday nights in
summer when his father took him on the street-car to the little
park along the river three miles away, where there were outdoor
moving-pictures on an island; later, fireworks and across the
river the great flare, the receding thunder of a train. Now,
curiously, that whole memory came back to him with all its vivid
and unutterable poignancy: he could remember the little
artificial lake there at the park--that lake just three feet deep
that had seemed so vast and thrilling to him, and the boat-house
with lake-water lapping at the piers, the clank of oarlocks and
the dull bump and dry knocking of the boats together as they
collided in the darkness, and the people, gathered there in
darkness, with their dim faces upturned to the great silver dance
and flicker of the moving-picture screen which was set on a
little island on the lake--an island that was dense with trees
and foliage, and that had seemed to him as mysterious and
illimitable as the jungle. And opposite the island, on the shore,
looking over the heads of the people in the boats, the greater
part of the audience sat on wooden benches, all thirsty, silent,
and insatiate, the petals of five hundred dim white faces all
lifted to the flickering magic of the screen.</p>

<p>It all came back to him now as he sat there on the porch of
this splendid mansion with Mrs. Pierce and Joel and the other
guests, and though the place was splendid, wealthy and luxurious
beyond dreams, the happy, warm, and friendly gaiety of the
people, their eager looking-forward to fireworks and the Fourth
of July, something free and warm and simple in their relation,
recalled again those glorious expeditions of his youth to the
little park upon the river, and the crowded streetcars going
home, and friendly voices, laughter, and the slamming of a door,
and then his father's voice upon the porch and sleep and
silence--it all came back now in tones of unutterable brightness,
and the Hudson River lay below him in the great fall and hush of
evening light that fell across America, and even as he thought
these things, a train rushed by below them on the bank of the
river, was hurled instantly past in a projectile flight--a
thunderbolted speed, was hurled past them citywards, and was gone
at once, leaving nothing behind it but the sound of its
departure, a handful of lost echoes in the hills, and the river,
the mysterious river, the Hudson River in the great fall and hush
of evening light, and all somehow was just as it had always been,
and just as he had known he would find it, as it would always
be.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Later that night, when the other people in the house had gone
upstairs to bed, and as he was in the quiet library, making a
final, longing, hungrily regretful survey of the treasure-hoard
of noble books that walled the great room in their rich and
mellow hues from floor to ceiling, Joel came in.</p>

<p>"Look," he whispered, in his abrupt and casual way, "I'm going
to bed now: stay up as long as you please and sleep as late as
you like tomorrow morning. . . . And look," he whispered
casually--and quickly again--"what are you going to do? Do you
think you have to go back to the city tomorrow?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Joel: I think I'll have to--I have an early class the
first thing Monday morning, and if I'm going to meet it, I ought
to be back by tomorrow night: I think that will be best."</p>

<p>"It's been nice having you," Joel whispered. "It was swell
that you could come. And if you really like the place," he said
simply, "I'm glad. . . . I think it's a grand place, too. . . .
And look!" he whispered quickly, casually, looking away "--I
meant what I said yesterday--about that house, the gatekeeper's
lodge, I mean--If you like the place, and think you'd care to
live there, or come up whenever you feel like it, I wish you'd
take it," he whispered. "I really do--It's no use to anyone the
way it stands, and we'd all be delighted if you'd come and live
in it. . . . Just let me know when you are coming, just say the
word, and I'll have everything ready for you--And we <i>wish</i>
you would," he whispered earnestly, with his radiant smile, as if
asking the other youth to do him a favour--"it would be
swell."</p>

<p>"It's--it's pretty fine of you, Joel, too--"</p>

<p>"All right, sir," Joel whispered quickly, hastily, with a
smile, avoiding skilfully the embarrassment of thanks: "And look,
Eugene--of course I'll see you Tuesday when I get back to
town--I'll be right there at the hotel the rest of the
summer--except for week-ends when I come up here--but I wanted to
ask you if you had made up your mind yet about going to
Europe?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I have, Joel. At least, that's what I want to do--what
I'd like to do. If I can manage it, I intend to set sail--" the
two words had a glorious magic sound to him, and his pulse beat
hot and hard with joy and hope as he spoke them--"to set sail in
September when my work at the university is over!"</p>

<p>"Gosh! That's swell!" Joel whispered enthusiastically, his
face lighting with radiant eagerness as if the news had given him
some great and unexpected happiness--"And Frank Starwick will be
glad go hear it, too. You know, he's going over at the end of
August; I had a letter from him just the other day."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know: he wrote me too."</p>

<p>"And he'll want to see you when he comes to town: we must all
try to get together before he goes. . . . And look," he said
quickly, abruptly, casually again--"if you go, how long will you
be gone? How long do you intend to stay away?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, Joel. I'd like to go for a whole year, but I
don't know if I can manage it. They've offered me an appointment
for another year at the university. They want me to come back for
the new term that begins in February, and maybe that's what I'll
have to do. But I'd like to stay away a year!"</p>

<p>"I hope you can," Joel whispered. "You ought to spend a whole
year over there! It would be a swell thing if you could."</p>

<p>"Yes; I think so, too. But I don't know how I'm going to
manage it: at the present time I don't quite see how I can. . . .
You see, all I've got to live on at the present time is what I
earn as an instructor at the university--they pay me eighteen
hundred dollars a year--"</p>

<p>"Gosh!" Joel whispered, arching his eyebrows in polite
astonishment--"That's a lot, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"It's not much, Joel: it amounts to $150 a month; you can get
along on that, but you're not going to paint New York red on it,
the way things are today, especially if you've got a healthy
appetite and love to eat, the way I do."</p>

<p>"Yes," Joel whispered, laughing his beautiful, radiant, and
almost soundless laugh. "I can see that--that belly of yours is
going to cost you a lot of money before you get through with it.
A man who loves food the way you do ought to be a millionaire.
But you see, don't you," he said, with a flash of his rare and
gentle malice--"that's what you get for not being a vegetarian
like Bernard Shaw and me. . . . Eugene," he cried softly,
laughing, after a moment's brief reflection, "--you'll love
France--the food is wonderful--but Lord!" and he laughed again
his radiant soundless laugh "--how you're going to hate
England!"</p>

<p>"Why? Is the food bad?"</p>

<p>"It's unspeakable!" Joel whispered--"that is for anyone who
loves food the way you do: they go through the tortures of the
damned . . . of course, for me it doesn't matter. I can eat
anything--anything, that is, so long as it's vegetables--it all
tastes alike to me--but <i>you'll</i> hate it . . . of course,"
he whispered earnestly, "you really won't: you'll love the
country and you'll like the English. They're swell."</p>

<p>"Have you been there much, Joel?"</p>

<p>"Only once," he whispered. "When Mums and Rosalind were there.
We had a house out in the country and we stayed there for fifteen
months. And it was grand! You'll love it. . . . Gosh! I hope you
can stay over there a whole year!" he went on eagerly. "Don't you
think you can?"</p>

<p>"I don't think so: you see, as I was telling you, I have only
$150 a month; when I finish up in September I'll have about five
pay-cheques coming to me: that's only $750. So I figure I can get
over there on that and live for several months, but unless I can
get money from my mother--I think perhaps she'll help me--I don't
see how I can get along for a whole year."</p>

<p>"Then look," said Joel, speaking swiftly, and casually, and
looking away as if he were making the most matter-of-fact
proposal in the world--"Why don't you let me help you? . . . I
mean," he went on hastily, and showing his embarrassment only by
two spots of colour in his gaunt face--"I'd love to do it if
you'd let me--it'd be no trouble at all--and you could pay it
back whenever you like--just as soon as your play goes on: you'll
have plenty of money then, so I wish you'd take it now when you
need it. . . . You see," he whispered quickly, with a smile, "I
have loads of money--more than I can ever <i>possibly</i> use--I
have no need for it--I was twenty-one this spring, you know,--and
now I'm <i>awfully</i> rich," he whispered humorously, and then
concluded in a quickly apologetic whisper--"not <i>really,</i> of
course--not compared to most people--but rich, for <i>me,"</i> he
whispered, smiling. "--I've got <i>much</i> more than I need--so
I really wish you'd let me help you if you need it--Frank said
he'd let me know if he needed anything and I wish you'd do the
same. . . . I think you ought to go for a whole year since you're
going--it's your first trip, and <i>gosh!"</i> he whispered
enthusiastically, "how I envy you! How I wish <i>I</i> were going
for the first time! It's going to be a swell thing for you,
you're going to have a grand time--and you've simply <i>got</i>
to stay for a whole year--so I wish you'd let me help you if I
can."</p>

<p>He had made this astoundingly generous proposal with a quick,
hurried matter-of-factness that seemed to be eagerly begging for
a favour, instead of magnificently and nobly giving it. And for a
moment the other could not answer, and when he did he did not
know the reason for his reply, for his refusal. It was as
generous, as selfless, and spontaneous an act of liberal and
noble friendship as he had ever known or experienced, and for a
moment, as he thought of his longed-for trip, his dire need of
money, it all seemed so magically easy, good, and wonderfully
right to him that there seemed nothing to do except instantly,
gratefully and jubilantly to accept. Yet, when he opened his
mouth to speak, he found himself, to his surprise, refusing this
miraculous and generous good fortune. And he never knew exactly
the reason why: there was, perhaps, the growing sense of
something alien and irreconcilable in the design and purpose of
their separate lives, a growing feeling of regret, a conviction
enhanced by his conversation with Joel in the studio that morning
that their lives would be lived out in separate worlds, wrought
to separate purposes, and shaped by separate beliefs, and with
that knowledge a feeling--a feeling of loneliness and finality
and farewell--as if a great door had swung for ever closed
between them, as if there was something secret, buried, and
essential in the soul of each which now could never be revealed.
And, to his surprise, he heard himself saying:</p>

<p>"Thanks, Joel--it's mighty fine of you--about as fine as
anything I ever heard--but I don't need help now. If I need it
later--"</p>

<p>"If you do," said Joel very quickly, "I wish you'd let me
know--I'd like it if you would. . . . And gosh! it's great to
know that you are going," he whispered again with radiant
enthusiasm. "I envy you!"</p>

<p>"Then I wish to God you'd come along! . . . Joel," the other
burst out excitedly, with a sudden surge of eager warm
conviction. "Why can't you? We'd have a great time of it--go
everywhere--see everything! It would be a wonderful thing--a
great experience--for you and me both. You've never seen Europe
that way before, have you?--the way that you and I could see
it?--you've always been with your family, your mother, haven't
you?--Come on!" he cried, seizing his friend by the arm, as if
they were ready to go that instant. "Let's go! We'll have the
grandest trip you ever heard about!"</p>

<p>But Joel, laughing his radiant soundless laugh, and shaking
his head with gentle but inflexible denial, said:</p>

<p>"No, Eugene! . . . Not for me! . . . I can't do it! I'm going
to stay right here and keep on with the work I'm doing . . .
Besides," he added gravely, "Mums needs me. No one knows what's
going to happen here in the family," he said quietly--"I
mean--that thing tonight--you saw--about Mums and Pups"--he said
with painful difficulty. The other nodded, and Joel concluded
simply: "I've got to stay." For a moment he was silent, and
suddenly the other youth noticed something starved and lonely,
and almost desperately forsaken and resigned, that he had never
observed in the boy's gaunt face and eyes before, and when Joel
spoke again, although there was a faint smile on his face, there
was something old and sad and weary in his voice that the other
youth had never heard before. He said quietly:</p>

<p>"Perhaps you're right. . . . Perhaps you and I do belong in
different worlds . . . must go different ways. . . . If that is
true," Joel turned and looked directly at his friend and in his
eyes there was an infinite quiet depth of regret and acceptance
"--if that is true, I'm sorry. . . . At any rate, it was good to
have known you. . . . And now, good-bye, Eugene--Good night, I
mean," he hastily concluded, in his former whispered, quick and
casual tones, "I'll see you in the morning."</p>

<p>With these words he turned quickly and left him.</p>

<p>He stayed there long into the night in that rich room, while
the great house sank to sleep and silence all around him. And at
first he moved there quietly like a man living in an enchanted
dream, almost afraid to draw a breath lest he dispel the glory
and the magic of enchantment, and all the time the voices of the
living books around him seemed to speak to him, to say to him:
"Now it is night and silence and the sleep-time of the earth, the
all-exultant time of youth and loneliness, and of your spirit's
proud accession. Now take us, plunder us, and take us, for you
are alone and living in the world tonight while all the sleepers
sleep, immortal knowledge will be yours tonight, the secrets of
an everlasting and triumphal wisdom; the huge compacted treasure
of the earth speaks to you from these storeyed shelves, and it is
yours, you are the richest man in all the earth if you will take
us, only take us, we have waited for you long, dear friend,
tonight the world is yours, and will be yours for ever, if you
will only take us, take us, take us."</p>

<p>And like a man drunk with joy, half through the night he
plundered the living treasure of those shelves. They were all
there--the great chroniclers and recorders, the marvellous and
enchanted lies of old Herodotus, and Sir Thomas Malory, and the
voyages of Hakluyt and of Purchas, the histories of Mandeville
and Hume. There was Burton's marvellous <i>Anatomy,</i> his
staggering erudition never smelling of the dust or of the lamp,
his lusty, pungent ever-rushing-onward style, and the
annihilating irony of Gibbon's latinized sonority, and the
savage, burning, somehow magic plainness of Swift's style. There
was the dark tremendous music of Sir Thomas Browne, and Hooker's
sounding and tremendous passion made great by genius and made
true by faith, and there was the giant dance, the vast
storm-rounding cadence, now demented and now strong as light, of
great Carlyle; and beside the haunting cadences of this
tremendous piece, there was the pungent worldliness of
life-loving men; the keen diaries of John Evelyn, the lusty tang
and calculation and sensual rumination of old Pepys, the writing
bright as noon, natural as morning, and the plain and
middle-magic of the eighteenth century, the flawless grace and
faultless clearness of Addison and Steele, and then all the
pageantry of living character, the pages crowded with the
immortal flesh of Sterne, Defoe, and Smollett, the huge comic
universe of Fielding, the little one of Austen, and the immortal
and extravagant one of Charles Dickens, the magnificent
proliferation of Sir Walter Scott's tremendous gallery--and
Thackeray's sentimental gallantry and magic, and all the single
magics of Nathaniel Hawthorne, of Meredith, and Melville, of
Landor, Peacock, Lamb, and of De Quincey, of Hazlitt, and of
Poe.</p>

<p>There were, as well, the works of all the poets, the Kelmscott
Chaucers, the Dove editions, the doe-skin bindings, white and
soft and velvet to the touch, the splendid bodies in all their
royal pageantry of blue and gold and dense rich green--the Greek
anthologies, and all the poets of antiquity, and the singing
voices of the great Elizabethans--of Wyatt, Surrey, Sidney, and
of Spenser, Webster, Ford and Massinger, of Kyd and Greene and
Marlowe, of Beaumont, Lyly, Nash and Dekker, of Jonson,
Shakespeare, Herrick, Herbert, Donne.</p>

<p>They were all there, from thundering &AElig;schylus to the
sweet small voice of perfect-singing Herrick, from grand plain
Homer to poignant Catullus, from acid and tart-humoured Horace,
from the lusty, vulgar and sweet-singing voice of Geoffrey
Chaucer, the great bronze ring and clangorous sonority of John
Dryden, to the massy gold, the choked-in richness, the haunting
fall and faery, of John Keats.</p>

<p>They were all there--each stored there in his little niche
upon the living shelves, and at first he looted them, he
plundered through their golden leaves as a man who first
discovers a buried and inestimable treasure, and at first is dumb
with joy at his discovery, and can only plunge his hands in it
with drunken joy, scoop handfuls up and pour it over him and let
the massy gold leak out again in golden ruin through his spread
hands; or as a man who discovers some enchanted spring of ageless
youth, of ever-long immortality, and drinks of it, and can never
drink enough, and drinks and feels with every drink the huge
summation of earth's glory in his own enrichment, the ageless
fires of its magic youth.</p>

<p>Then, as the night wore on, another feeling crept across his
heart, the living voices of the books spoke to him with another
tone. From those great tongues of life and power and soaring
immortality there had now departed all the sonorous conviction of
their overwhelming, all-triumphant chant. The grand and ringing
tongue and joy now spoke the language of a quiet and illimitable
despair, confided the legend of an inevitable defeat, an
inexorable fatality.</p>

<p>From those high-storeyed shelves of dense rich bindings the
great voices of eternity, the tongues of mighty poets dead and
gone, now seemed to speak to him out of the living and animate
silence of the room. But in that living silence, in the vast and
quiet spirit of sleep which filled the great house, out of the
grand and overwhelming stillness of that proud power of wealth
and the impregnable security of its position, even the voices of
those mighty poets dead and gone now seemed somehow lonely,
small, lost, and pitiful. Each in his little niche of shelf
securely stored--all of the genius, richness, and whole compacted
treasure of a poet's life within a foot of space, within the
limits of six small dense richly-garnished volumes--all of the
great poets of the earth were there, unread, unopened, and
forgotten, and were somehow, terribly, the mute small symbols of
a rich man's power, of the power of wealth to own everything, to
take everything, to triumph over everything--even over the power
and genius of the mightiest poet--to keep him there upon his
little foot of shelf, unopened and forgotten, but possessed.</p>

<p>Thus, for the first time in his life, even the voices of the
mighty poets seemed lost and small and pitifully defeated. Their
great voices, which had given to the heart of youth the added
fire of their triumphant magic, had borne his spirit high upon
the wings of the soaring and invincible belief that no might on
earth was equal to the might of poetry, no immortality could
equal the immortality of a poet's life and fame, no glory touch
his glory, or no strength his strength--now seemed to speak to
him the mute and small and lonely judgment of defeat.</p>

<p>"Child, child," they said to him, "look at us and reflect:
what shall it profit you to feed upon the roots of all-engulfing
night, desiring glory? Do not the rats of death and age and dark
oblivion feed so for ever at the roots of sleep, and can you tell
us where a man lies buried now, whose substance they have not
devoured? Oh, child, for ever in the dark old house of life to go
alone, to prowl the barren avenues of night, and listen while
doors swing and creak in the old house of life, and ponder on the
lids of night, and ruminate the vast heart of sleep and silence
and the dark, and so consume yourself--desiring what? Poor child,
you son of an unlettered race, you nameless atom of the nameless
wilderness, how have you let us dupe you with our fictive
glories? What power is there on earth, in sea or heaven, what
power have you in yourself, you son of your unuttered fathers, to
find a tongue for your unuttered brothers, and to make a frame, a
shape, a magic and eternal form out of the jungle of the great
unuttered wilderness from which you came, of which you are a
nameless and unuttered atom? What can you hope to do, poor
nameless child, and would-be chronicler of the huge unhistoried
morass of the dark wilderness of America, when we, who were the
children of a hundred gold-recorded centuries and the heirs of
all the rich accumulations of tradition, have really done so
little--and have come to this? What profit do you hope to
gain--what reward could you achieve that would repay you for all
the anguish, hunger, and the desperate effort of your life? At
its rare infrequent best, out of your blind and famished gropings
in the jungle-depths, you may pluck out a shining word--achieve a
moment's flash of grace and intuition--a half-heard whisper of
the vast unuttered language that you seek--perhaps a moment's
taste of fame, a brief hour's flash of the imagined glory that
you thirst for. For just a moment, you, like other men, will play
the lion, will feed upon the older lion's blood, will triumph for
a moment through his defeat, will taste joy for a moment through
the blood of his despair--and then, like him, you too will be
thrown to the mercy of the coming lion, the wilderness will rise
again to engulf you, your little hour of glory for which your
soul thirsts and your life is panting will be over before it has
well begun, and the myriad horde of all your thousand mongrel
races will rise with snarl and jeer and curse and lie and mocking
to do your life to death, with all the hatred of their mongrel
rancour and their own self-loathing, to kill the lion they have
crowned for just a day, to hurl you back into a nameless and
dishonourable oblivion, drowned down beneath the huge mock and
jibe of the old scornmaker's pride. Therefore, short-lived, your
life will soon be ended; your youth, but just begun, will shortly
be consumed, and all the labour of your anguish and your hunger
will be mocked to scorn by the same mongrel fools who praised it,
and forgotten by the very knaves who gave it fame. Such is the
infrequent good, the flash of brief fame, to which you may
aspire, the huge oblivion of failure, misery and dishonour which
will follow. But if, by miraculous good chance, you should escape
from this--be not devoured and slain and drowned out and
forgotten in the brutal swarming shades of jungle time--what
greater glory is there that you can achieve? Some such as ours,
perhaps--then look at us, and see the state to which we've come.
To lie forgotten on the rich shelves of a rich man's library--to
be a portion of his idle wealth--the evidence of his arrogant
possession--to rise, as all the earth must rise--these dreaming
hills and haunted woods, the mighty river and this great
moon-haunted hill where stands this house--shout the tributes of
a rich man's glory--to bow before him--to lie bought, owned,
forgotten and possessed--the greatest poets that ever walked the
earth or built, like you, great dreams of glory--to be obsequious
tributes to a rich man's fame. Yes, you, even you--poor naked
child--may come to this--to reach this state, to be entombed
here, bought and idle among the forgotten huge encumbrance of a
rich man's arrogant possession--and to know at last that all the
glory, genius, and magic of a poet's life may lie condensed in
six rich bindings, forgotten, purchased and unread--and finally
defeated by the only thing in life that lusts and will triumph
for ever--the all-causing tyranny of wealth that makes a slave of
its great poets--that makes us the barren prostitutes of fame,
the pimps of wealth--unused and empty on a rich man's shelf."</p>

<p>So did that great treasure of unread, purchased, and forgotten
books speak to him in the silent watches of the night, as they
stood there, lonely, small and bought, on a rich man's shelf.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Towards morning, as he sat there with a great book propped
upon his knees, his mind filled with the thought of those dead,
forgotten, and still-living voices and of his rich young friend
and the strange and bitter enigma of the fatal severance which
had seemed that day to close a great door between their lives for
ever, he turned the pages of the book idly, and suddenly the
blurred characters on the page before him swam legibly to view.
And what those words upon the page before him said was this:</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>"The young man saith unto him, All these things have I kept
from my youth up: what lack I yet?</p>

<p>"Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell
that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have
treasure in heaven: and come and follow me.</p>

<p>"But when the young man heard that saying, he went away
sorrowful: for he had great possessions."</p>

<h1>LXVII</h1>

<p> </p>

<p>As he and Joel drove to the station it seemed to Eugene that
he was returning to a world from which he had been absent for
years. And the return was not a pleasant one. As they entered the
little town, and began to drive swiftly down a street that led to
the station, the little frame houses with their new
architectures--their faded little strips of "front-yard" grass,
cement walks, and cement-yard walls, looked cheap, flimsy, new
and dreary--the image of a life that was itself as rootless,
insecure, and drearily pretentious as the little painted frames
it lived in.</p>

<p>It was Sunday, and as they drove up to the station he saw
before a Greek confectionery and newspaper store a group of the
town sports. They were dressed up in their cheap Sunday finery,
and their faces wore a smirk. As Joel got out of the car, the
sports tried to look nonchalant and easy in their relations with
one another, but a kind of uneasy constraint had fallen upon them
and held them until he had gone. And yet he had not noticed them
or done anything that might have caused them this discomfort.</p>

<p>In the gravelled parking space before the station several cars
were drawn up. Their shining bodies glittered in the hot sunlight
like great beetles of machinery, and in the look of these great
beetles, powerful and luxurious as most of them were, there was a
stamped-out quality, a kind of metallic and inhuman repetition
that filled his spirit, he could not say why, with a vague sense
of weariness and desolation. The feeling returned to him--the
feeling that had come to him so often in recent years with a
troubling and haunting insistence--that "something" had come into
life, "something new" which he could not define, but something
that was disturbing and sinister, and which was somehow
represented by the powerful, weary, and inhuman precision of
these great, glittering, stamped-out beetles of machinery. And
consonant to this feeling was another concerning people
themselves: it seemed to him that they, too, had changed, that
"something new" had come into their faces, and although he could
not define it, he felt with a powerful and unmistakable intuition
that it was there--that "something" had come into life that had
changed the lives and faces of the people, too. And the reason
this discovery was so disturbing--almost terrifying, in fact--was
first of all because it was at once evident and yet indefinable;
and then because he knew it had happened within the years of his
own life, few and brief as they were--had happened, indeed,
within "the last few years," had happened all around him while he
lived and breathed and worked among these very people to whom it
had happened, and that he had not observed it at the "instant"
when it came. For, with an intensely literal, an almost
fanatically concrete quality of imagination, it seemed to him
that there must have been an "instant"--a moment of crisis, a
literal fragment of recorded time in which the transition of this
change came. And it was just for this reason that he now felt a
nameless and disturbing sense of desolation--almost of terror; it
seemed to him that this change in people's lives and faces had
occurred right under his nose, while he was looking on, and that
he had not seen it when it came, and that now it was here, the
accumulation of his knowledge had burst suddenly in this moment
of perception--he saw plainly that people had worn this look for
several years, and that he did not know the manner of its
coming.</p>

<p>They were, in short, the faces of people who had been hurled
ten thousand times through the roaring darkness of a subway
tunnel, who had breathed foul air, and been assailed by smashing
roar and grinding vibrance, until their ears were deafened, their
tongues rasped and their voices made metallic, their skins and
nerve-ends thickened, calloused, mercifully deprived of aching
life, moulded to a stunned consonance with the crashing uproar of
the world in which they lived. These were the dead, the dull,
lack-lustre eyes of men who had been hurled too far, too often,
in the smashing projectiles of great trains, who, in their
shining beetles of machinery, had hurtled down the harsh and
brutal ribbons of their concrete roads at such a savage speed
that now the earth was lost for ever, and they never saw the
earth again: whose weary, desperate ever-seeking eyes had sought
so often, seeking <i>man,</i> amid the blind horror and
proliferation, the everlasting shock and flock and flooding of
the million-footed crowd, that all the life and lustre and fire
of youth had gone from them; and seeking so for ever in the
man-swarm for man's face, now saw the blind blank wall of faces,
and so would never see man's living, loving, radiant, and
merciful face again.</p>

<p>Such were the faces that he now saw waiting on the station
platform of this little Hudson River town--two dozen faces from
the mongrel and anonymous compost of like faces that made up
America--and with a sudden blinding flash of horror and of
recognition, it now came to him that they were just the faces he
had seen everywhere, at a thousand times and places in "the last
few years."</p>

<p>He had seen them in their last and greatest colony--the huge
encampment of the innumerable submerged, the last and largest
colony of the great mongrel and anonymous compost that makes up
America: he had seen them there, hurtling for ever, from the
roaring arch of the great bridge, with their unceasing flight,
projectile roar, unnumbered flood, in their great and desolate
beetles of glittering machinery--boring for ever through the huge
and labyrinthine horror of that trackless jungle of uncounted
ways, beneath the grime and rust and swarm and violence and
horror of Fulton Street, past all the vast convergences, the
threat and menace of the empty naked corners, the swarming and
concentric chaos of Borough Hall, and with beetling and unceasing
flight through Clinton Street, on Henry Street, through the
Bedford section, out through the flat and limitless swelter known
as "the Flatbush section," beneath the broad and humid light of
solid skies, through ten thousand rusty, grimy, nameless streets
that make up that huge and trackless swelter--and most horrible
of all, a flood of nameless faces, rootless and unnumbered lives,
hurtling blindly past for ever in hot beetles of machinery along
those broad, wide, and splendidly desolate "avenues," that were
flanked upon each side by the cheap raw brick, the gaudy
splendour, of unnumbered new apartment houses, the brick and
stucco atrocities of unnumbered new cheap houses, and that cut
straight and brutal as a spoke across the labyrinthine chaos of
the Brooklyn jungle--and that led to God knows where--to Coney
Island, to the beaches, to the outer districts of that trackless
web, the unknown continent of Long Island--but that, no matter
where or how they led, were always crowded with the blind horror
of those unnumbered, hurtling faces, the blind horror of those
great glittering beetles of machinery drilling past for ever in
projectile flight, unceasing movement and unending change, the
blind horror of these unknown nameless lives hurtling on for
ever, lost for ever, going God knows where!</p>

<p>Yes, this was the thing--blindly, desperately, unutterably
though he felt it--this was the thing that had put this look--the
"new look"--the horrible, indefinable, and abominably desolate
and anonymous look into the face of people. This was the thing
that had taken all the play and flash of passion, joy, and
instant, lovely and mercurial life out of their living faces, and
that gave their faces the look of something blunted, deadened,
stunned, and calloused.</p>

<p>This was the thing that had given people "the new look"--that
had made man what he had become--that had made all these people
waiting on the platform for the train what they were--and now
that he had to face this thing again, now that he had to be
thrust back in it, now that, after these three days of magic and
enchantment, he must leave this glorious world that he had just
discovered--and be thrust brutally back again into the blind and
brutal stupefaction, the nameless agony and swelter of that life
from which he came--it seemed to him he could not face it, he
could not go back to it again, it was too hard, too full of pain
and sweat and agony and terror, too ugly, cruel, futile, and
horrible, to be endured.</p>

<p>No more! No more! And not to be endured! To discover for three
days--three magic swift-winged days--that enchanted life that had
held all his visions as a child in fee--to be for just three
brief and magic days a lord of life, the valued friend, the
respected and well-loved companion of great men and glorious
women, to discover and to possess for three haunting and
intolerable lovely days the magic domain of his boyhood's
"America"--the most fortunate, good and happy life that men had
ever known--the most true and beautiful, the most
<i>right</i>--and now to have it torn from him at the very
instant of possession--and to come to this:--a nameless cipher
hurtled citywards in the huge projectile of a train, with all his
fellow-ciphers, towards this blind and brutal stupefaction. A
voice sounded far off, thundering in his ears through the
battle-roar and rock of that stunned universe, as he cried:</p>

<p>"Joel! Joel! It was good to be here with you--Joel--"</p>

<p>And suddenly he saw his friend's tall form recoil, shrink
back, the look of something instant, startled, closed and final
in his face and eye, and heard the swift incisive whisper saying
quickly--</p>

<p>"Yes! . . . It was good that you could come! . . . And now,
good-bye! . . . I shall see you--"</p>

<p>And so heard no more, and knew that that good-bye was final
and irrevocable and could not be altered, no matter now how much
or how often they should "see" each other in the future.</p>

<p>And at the same moment, as that door swung shut between them,
and he saw that it never could be opened any more, he felt, with
the knowledge of that irrevocable loss, a moment's swift and
rending pity for his friend. For he saw somehow that he was
lost--that there was nothing for him now but shadows on the
wall--Circean make-believe--that world of moonlight, magic and
painted smoke that "the river people" knew. For three days he
himself had breathed the poppied fumes of all its glorious
unreality, and in those three short days the world from which he
came--his father's earth of blood and sweat and stinking day and
bitter agony--this world of violence and toil and strife and
cruelty and terror, this swarming world of nameless lives and
mongrel faces, with all its ugliness--had become phantasmal as an
evil dream, until now he could scarcely endure the hot and savage
swelter, the savage fury, of the unceasing city. To grope and
sweat and thrust and curse his way again among the unceasing
flood-tides of the grimy swarming pavements; to be buffeted,
stunned, bewildered, deadened, and exhausted by the blind
turmoil, the quenchless thirst and searching, the insatiate
hunger and the black despair of all that bleak and fruitless
struggle, that futile and unceasing strife--and to come to this!
To come to this!</p>

<p>It was too hard, too painful, too much to be endured, he could
not go!--and even as his life shrank back in all the shuddering
revulsion and loathing of his desolate discovery--he heard the
great train thunder on the rails--and he knew that he <i>must</i>
go!</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>For a moment, as the train pulled out, he stood looking out of
the window, waved good-bye to Joel standing on the platform, and
for a moment watched his tall retreating form. Then the train
gained speed, was running swiftly now along the river's edge,
swept round a bend, the station and the town were left behind
him, and presently, just for a few brief moments as it swept
along below the magic and familiar hill, he caught a vision of
the great white house set proudly far away up on the hill and
screened with noble trees. Then this was gone: he looked about
him, up and down the grimy coach, which was dense with smoke and
pungent with the smell of cheap cigars and strong tobacco.</p>

<p>They were all there, and instantly he knew that he had seen
each one of them a million times, and had known all of them for
ever; the Greek from Cleveland with his cheap tan suit, his loud
tan shoes, his striped tan socks, his cheap cardboard suitcase
with its tan shirts and collars and its extra pair of pants, and
with his hairy, seamed and pitted nighttime face, his swarthy
eyes, his lowering finger-breadth of forehead bent with painful,
patient, furrowed rumination into the sensational mysteries of
tabloid print. They were all there--two deaf-mutes talking on
their fingers; a young Harlem negro and his saffron wench, togged
to the nines in tan and lavender; two young Brooklyn Jews and
their two girl friends grouped on turned seats; a little chorus
girl from the burlesque with dyed hair of straw-blade falseness,
a false, meagre, empty, painted little prostitute's face, and a
costume of ratty finery false as all the rest of her; a young
Italian with grease-black hair sleeked back in faultless
patent-leather pompadour, who talked to her, eyes leering and
half-lidded, with thick pale lips fixed in a slow thick smile of
sensual assurance, the jaws slow-working on a wad of gum; a man
with the strong, common, gaunt-jawed and anonymous visage of the
working man, wearing neat, cheap, nameless clothing, and with a
brown-paper parcel on the rack above him; and a young dark
Irishman, his tough face fierce with drink and truculence, his
eyes glittering with red points of fire, his tongue snarling
curses, threats, and invitations to the fight that rasped and cut
with naked menace through the smoke-blue air.</p>

<p>The young Jews slouched with laughter, filled the car with
noisy clamour, sparred glibly, swiftly, with quick, eager, and
praise-asking repartee, with knowing smirk and cynic jest, with
acrid cynic wit that did not hit the mark. The little blondined
prostitute listened to the hypnotic, slit-eyed, thick-lipped
seductions of the young Italian with a small coy-bawdy smirk upon
her painted face: she did not know what he meant, she had no idea
what he was talking about, and with coy-bawdy smirk she rose,
edged past his slow withdrawn knees and minced down the corridor
towards the little cupboard at the end that housed the women's
toilet, while with lidded sly eyes and thick, slow-chewing and
slow-smiling lips his calculating glance pursued her. The lady
entered, closed the door upon a stale reek, and was gone some
time. When she emerged she arranged her clothing daintily,
smoothed out her rumpled dress across her hips and came mincing
down the corridor again with faint coy-bawdy smirk, and was
greeted again by her gallant suitor, who welcomed her in the same
manner, with lidded eyes, thick, pallid and slow-chewing lips and
slow withdrawn knees. The two deaf-mutes surveyed the scene with
loathing: one was large and heavy, with the powerful shoulders of
the cripple, a brutal face, a wide and cruel mouth; the other
small and dark and ferret-faced--but both surveyed the scene with
loathing. They looked at each and all the passengers and they
dismissed each in turn upon their fingers. As they did so their
faces writhed in vicious snarls, in sneering smiles, in
convulsions of disgust and hatred; they looked upon the objects
of their hate and jerked cruel thumbs towards earth in gestures
eloquent of annihilation and destructive sudden death, and they
drew swift fingers meaningly across their gullets with the deadly
move of men who slit a throat--and all was as he had known it
would be.</p>

<p>The working man with the strong and common face, the cheap,
neat clothes, sat quietly, and looked quietly out of the window,
with seamed face and quiet worn eyes, and the young Irishman
sweltered in strong drink and murder; the taste of blood was
thick in him, his little eyes glittered with red points of fire,
and ever as the train rushed on he sowed that smoke-blue air with
rasping curse and snarling threat, with all the idiotic
stupefaction of a foul and idiotic profanity, an obscene but
limited complaint:--</p>

<p>"Yuh ----- Kikes! . . . Yuh ----- Jews! . . . I'll kick duh
----- s--t outa duh ----- lot of yuh, yuh ----- bastards, you. .
. . Hey-y! You! . . . Yuh ----- dummies up deh talkin' on yer
----- fingers all duh time. . . . Hey-y! You! Inches! You -----
bastard, I don't give a s--t for duh whole ----- lot of yuh."</p>

<p>It was all as it had always been, as he had known it would be,
as he never could have foreseen it: the young dark Irishman sowed
the air with threats and foulness, he finished up his bottle, and
the foulness and the old red light of murder grew. And the
mongrel compost laughed and snickered as they always did, and at
length grew silent when he lurched with drunken measure towards
them, and the old guard with the sour, seamed face then stopped
the Irishman, and he cursed him.</p>

<p>And the slant light steepened in the skies, the old red light
of waning day made magic fire upon the river, and the train made
on for ever its tremendous monotone that was like silence and for
ever--and now there was nothing but that tremendous monotone of
time and silence and the river, the haunted river, the enchanted
river that drank for ever its great soundless tides from out the
inland slowly, and that moved through all man's lives the magic
thread of its huge haunting spell, and that linked his life to
magic kingdoms and to lotus-land and to all the vision of the
magic earth that he had dreamed of as a child, and that bore him
on for ever out of magic to all the grime and sweat and violence
of the city, the unceasing city, the million-footed city, and
into America.</p>

<p>The great river burned there in his vision in that light of
fading day and it was hung there in that spell of silence and for
ever, and it was flowing on for ever, and it was stranger than a
legend, and as dark as time.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Smoke-gold by day, the numb exultant secrecies of fog, a
fog-numb air filled with the solemn joy of nameless and impending
prophecy, an ancient yellow light, the old smoke-ochre of the
morning, never coming to an open brightness--such was October in
England that year. Sometimes by night in stormy skies there was
the wild, the driven moon, sometimes the naked time-far
loneliness, the most-oh!-most familiar blazing of the stars that
shine on men for ever, their nameless, passionate dilemma of
strong joy and empty desolation, hope and terror, home and
hunger, the huge twin tyranny of their bitter
governance--wandering for ever and the earth again.</p>

<p>They are still-burning, homely particles of night, that light
the huge tent of the dark with their remembered fire, recalling
the familiar hill, the native earth from which we came, from
which we could have laid our finger on them, and making the great
earth and home seem near, most near, to wanderers; and filling
them with naked desolations of doorless, houseless, timeless, and
unmeasured vacancy.</p>

<p>And everywhere that year there was something secret, lonely,
and immense that waited, that impended, that was still. Something
that promised numbly, hugely, in the fog-numb air, and that never
broke to any open sharpness, and that was almost keen and frosty
October in remembered hills--oh, there was something there
incredibly near and most familiar, only a word, a stride, a room,
a door away--only a door away and never opened, only a door away
and never found.</p>

<p>At night, in the lounging rooms of the old inn, crackling
fires were blazing cheerfully, and people sat together drinking
small cups of the black bitter liquid mud that they called
coffee.</p>

<p>The people were mostly family groups who had come to visit
their son or brother in the university. They were the most
extraordinary, ugly, and distinguished-looking people Eugene had
ever seen. There was the father, often the best-looking of the
lot: a man with a ruddy weathered face, a cropped white
moustache, iron-grey hair--an open, driving, bull-dog look of the
country carried with tremendous style. The mother was very ugly
with a long horse-face and grimly weathered cheek-flanks that
seemed to have the tough consistency of well-tanned leather. Her
grim bare smile shone in her weathered face and was nailed for
ever round the gauntness of her grinning teeth. She had a
neighing voice, a shapeless figure, distinguished by the bony and
angular width of the hip structure, clothed with fantastic
dowdiness--fantastic because the men were dressed so well, and
because everything they wore, no matter how old and used it might
be, seemed beautiful and right.</p>

<p>The daughter had the mother's look: a tall gawky girl with a
bony, weathered face and a toothy mouth; she wore an ill-fitting
evening or party dress of a light unpleasant blue, with a big
meaningless rosette of ruffles at the waist. She had big feet,
bony legs and arms, and she was wearing pumps of dreary grey and
grey silk stockings.</p>

<p>The son was a little fellow with ruddy apple-cheeks, crisp,
fair, curly hair, and baggy grey trousers; and there was another
youth, one of his college friends, of the same cut and quality,
who paid a dutiful but cold attention to the daughter, which she
repaid in kind, and with which everyone was completely
satisfied.</p>

<p>They had to be seen to be believed, but even then, one could
only say, like the man who saw the giraffe: "I don't believe it."
The young men sat stiffly on the edges of their chairs, holding
their little cups of coffee in their hands, bent forward in an
attitude of cold but respectful attentiveness, and the
conversation that went on among them was incredible. For their
manner was impregnable; they were cold, remote, and formal almost
to the point of military curtness, and yet Eugene felt among them
constantly an utter familiarity of affection, a strange secret
warmth, past words or spoken vows, that burned in them like
glacial fire.</p>

<p>When you got ten or fifteen feet away from them their language
could not have been more indecipherable if they had spoken in
Chinese; but it was fascinating just to listen to the sounds. For
there would be long mounting horse-like neighs, and then there
would be reedy flute-like notes, and incisive cold finalities and
clipped ejaculations and sometimes a lovely and most musical
speech. But the horse-like neighs and clipped ejaculations would
predominate; and suddenly Eugene understood how strange these
people seemed to other races, and why Frenchmen, Germans, and
Italians would sometimes stare at them with gape-mouthed
stupefaction when they heard them talking.</p>

<p>Once when he passed by them they had the family vicar or some
clergyman of their acquaintance with them. He was a mountain of a
man, and he too, was hardly credible: the huge creature was at
least six and a half feet tall, and he must have weighed three
hundred pounds. He had a flaming moon of face and jowl, at once
most animal and delicate, and he peered out keenly with luminous
smoke-grey eyes beneath a bushy hedge-growth of grey brows. He
was dressed in the clerical garb and his bulging grossly sensual
calves were encased in buttoned gaiters. As Eugene went by, he
was leaning forward with his little cup of muddy coffee held
delicately in the huge mutton of his hand, peering keenly out
beneath his beetling bush of brow. And what he said was this:</p>

<p>"Did you ever read--that is, in recent y&ouml;hs--the
concluding chaptahs in 'The Vicah of Wakefield'?" Carefully he
set the little cup down in its saucer. "I was reading it just the
other day. It's an extraordinary thing!" he said.</p>

<p>It is impossible to reproduce the sound of these simple words,
or the effect they wrought upon Eugene's senses.</p>

<p>For, first, the words "Did you ever" were delivered in a
delicate rising-and-falling neigh, the word "read" really came
out with a long reedy sound, the words "that is, in recent
y&ouml;hs," in a parenthesis of sweetly gentle benevolence, the
phrase "the concluding chaptahs in 'The Vicah of Wakefield'" in
full, deliberate, satisfied tones of titular respect, the phrase
"I was reading it just the other day," thoughtfully, reedily,
with a subdued, gentle, and mellow reminiscence, and the final
decisive phrase, "It's an extraordinary thing," with passionate
conviction and sincerity that passed at the end into such an
unction of worshipful admiration that the words "extraordinary
thing" were not spoken but breathed out passionately, and had the
sound "'<i>strawd'n'ry</i> thing!"</p>

<p>"Ow!" the young man answered distantly, and in a rather
surprised tone, with an air of coldly startled interest, "Now! I
can't say that I have--not since my nursery days, at any rate!"
He laughed metallically.</p>

<p>"You should read it again," the mountainous creature breathed
unctuously. "A <i>'strawd'n'ry</i> thing! A <i>'strawd'n'ry</i>
thing." Delicately he lifted the little cup of muddy black in his
huge hand again and put it to his lips.</p>

<p>"But <i>frightfully</i> sentimental, down't you think?" the
girl neighed sharply at this point. "I mean all the
lovely-woman-stoops-to-folly sawt of thing, you know. After all,
it is a bit thick to expect people to swallow <i>that</i>
nowadays," she neighed, "particularly after all that's happened
in the last twenty y&ouml;hs. I suppose it mattuhed in the
eighteenth centureh, but after all," she neighed with an
impatient scorn, "who cares today? Who cares," she went on
recklessly, <i>"what</i> lovely woman stoops to? I cawn't see
that it makes the <i>slightest</i> difference. It's not as if it
mattuhed any longah! No one cares!"</p>

<p>"Ow!" the young man said with his air of coldly startled
interest. "Yes, I think I follow you, but I don't entirely agree.
How can we be certain what <i>is</i> sentimental and what's
not?"</p>

<p>"But it seems to me that he misses the whole point!" the girl
exclaimed with one full, mouth-like rush. "After all," she went
on scornfully, "no one is interested in woman's folly any
longah--the ruined-maiden broken-vows sawt of thing. If that was
what she got she should have jolly well known what she wanted to
begin with! <i>I'll</i> not waste any pity on her," she said
grimly. "The greatest folly is not knowin' what you want to do!
The whole point today is to live as cleveleh as possible! That's
the only thing that mattahs! If you know what you want and go
about it cleveleh, the rest of it will take care of itself."</p>

<p>"Um," the mother now remarked, her gaunt bare smile set
grimly, formidably, on her weathered face. "That takes a bit of
doin', <i>doesn't</i> it?" And as she spoke these quiet words her
grim smile never faltered for an instant and there was a hard, an
obdurate, an almost savage irony in her intonation, which left
them all completely unperturbed.</p>

<p>"Oh, a <i>'strawd'n'ry</i> thing! A <i>'strawd'n'ry</i>
thing!" the huge clerical creature whispered dreamily at this
point, as if he had not heard them. And delicately he set his
little cup back on the saucer.</p>

<p>Eugene's first impulse when he saw and heard them was to shout
with an astounded laughter--and yet, somehow, one never laughed.
They had a formidable and impregnable quality that silenced
laughter: a quality that was so assured in its own sense of
inevitable rightness that it saw no other way except its own, and
was so invincibly sure in its own way that it was indifferent to
all others. It could be taken among strange lands and alien
faces, and to the farthest and most savage colonies on earth, and
would never change or alter by a jot.</p>

<p>Yes, they had found a way, a door, a room to enter, and there
were walls about them now, and the way was theirs. The mark of
dark time and the architecture of unnumbered centuries of years
were on them, and had made them what they were; and what they
were, they were, and would not change.</p>

<p>Eugene did not know if their way was a good way, but he knew
it was not his. Their door was one he could not enter. And
suddenly the naked empty desolation filled his life again, and he
was walking on beneath the timeless sky, and had no wall at which
to hurl his strength, no door to enter by, and no purpose for the
furious unemployment of his soul. And now the worm was eating at
his heart again. He felt the slow interminable waste and wear of
grey time all about him and his life was passing in the darkness,
and all the time a voice kept saying: "Why? Why am I here now?
And where shall I go?"</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>When Eugene got out into the High Street after dinner, the
dark air would be thronging with the music of great bells, and
there would be a smell of fog and smoke and old October in the
air, the premonitory thrill and menace of some intolerable and
nameless joy. Often at night, the visage of the sky would by some
magic be released from the thick greyness that had covered it by
day, and would shine forth barely, blazing with flashing and
magnificent stars.</p>

<p>And, as the old bells thronged through the smoky air, the
students would be passing along the street, singly or in groups
of two or three, briskly, and with the eager haste that told of
meetings to come, appointments to be kept, the expectation of
some good fortune, happiness, or pleasure toward which they
hurried on.</p>

<p>The soft glow of lights would shine from the ancient windows
of the colleges, and one could hear the faint sounds of voices,
laughter, sometimes music.</p>

<p>Then Eugene would go to different pubs and drink until the
closing time. Sometimes the proctors would come into a pub where
he was drinking, speak amicably to everyone, and in a moment more
go out again.</p>

<p>Somehow he always hoped that they would take him for a
student. He could see them stepping up to him, as he stood there
at the bar, saying courteously, yet gravely and sternly:</p>

<p>"Your name and college, sir?"</p>

<p>Then he could see the look of astonished disbelief on their
grim red faces when he told them he was not a student, and at
last, when he had convinced them, he could hear their crestfallen
muttered-out apologies, and would graciously excuse them.</p>

<p>But the proctors never spoke to him, and the bar-man, seeing
him look at them as they went out one night, misunderstood the
look and laughed with cheerful reassurance:</p>

<p>"You've nothing at all to worry about, sir. They won't bother
you. It's only the gentlemen at the university they're
after."</p>

<p>"How do they know I'm not there?"</p>

<p>"That I couldn't tell you, sir," he answered cheerfully, "but
they 'ave a way of knowin'! Ah, yes!" he said with satisfaction,
slapping a wet cloth down upon the bar. "They 'ave a way of
knowin', right enough! They're a clever lot, those chaps. A very
clever lot, sir, and they always 'ave a way of knowin' when
you're not." And smiling cheerfully, he made a vigorous parting
swipe across the wood, and put the cloth away below the
counter.</p>

<p>Eugene's glass was almost empty and he looked at it, and
wondered if he ought to have another. He thought they made them
very small, and kept thinking of the governors of North and South
Carolina. It was a fine, warm, open sort of pub, and there was a
big fire-place just behind him, crackling smartly with a fire of
blazing coals: he could feel the warmth upon his back. Outside,
in the fog-numb air, people came by with lonely rapid footsteps
and were lost in fog-numb air again.</p>

<p>At this moment the bar-maid, who had bronze-red hair and the
shrewd witty visage of a parrot, turned and called out in a
cheerful, crisply peremptory tone: "Time, please, gentlemen.
Closing time."</p>

<p>Eugene put the glass down empty on the bar again. He wondered
what the way of knowing was.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>It was October, about the middle of the month, at the opening
of the Michaelmas term. Everywhere there was the exultant thrill
and bustle of returning, of a new life, a new adventure beginning
in an ancient and beautiful place that was itself enriched by the
countless lives and adventures of hundreds of years which had
come and gone. In the morning there was the smoky old-gold yellow
of the sun, the numb excitement of the foggy air, a smell of good
tobacco, beer, grilled kidneys, ham and sausages, and grilled
tomatoes, a faint nostalgic smell of tea, and incredibly,
somehow, in that foggy old-gold light, a smell of coffee--an
intolerable, maddening, false, delusive smell, for when one went
to find the coffee it would not be there: the coffee was black
liquid mud, bitter, lifeless, and undrinkable.</p>

<p>Everything was very expensive and yet it made you feel rich
yourself just to look at it. The little shops, the wine shops
with their bay windows of small leaded glass, and the crusty
opulence of the bottles of old port and sherry and the
burgundies, the mellow homely warmth and quietness of the
interior, the tailor shops, the tobacco shops with their selected
grades of fine tobacco stored in ancient crocks, the little bell
that tinkled thinly as you went in from the street, the decorous,
courteous, yet suavely good-natured proprietor behind the
counter, who had the ruddy cheeks, the flowing brown moustache
and the wing-collar of the shopkeeper of solid substance, and who
would hold the crock below your nose to let you smell the moist
fragrance of a rare tobacco before you bought, and would offer
you one of his best cigarettes before you left--all of this gave
somehow to the simplest acts of life and business a ritualistic
warmth and sanctity, and made you feel wealthy and secure.</p>

<p>And everywhere around Eugene in the morning there was the
feeling of an imminent recovery, a recapture of a life that had
always been his own. The buildings seemed to come from some
essence of reality he had always known, but had never seen, and
could scarcely believe in now, even when he put his hand upon the
weathered surface of the stone.</p>

<p>And this look kept shining at him through the faces of the
people. Sometimes it was in the faces of the college boys, but
more often he saw it in the people of the town. It was in the
faces of tradesmen--people in butcher shops, wine shops, clothing
stores--and sometimes it was in the faces of women, at once
common, fine, familiar, curiously delicate and serene, going to
the markets, in the foggy old-bronze light of morning, and of men
who passed by wearing derby hats and with wing collars. It was in
the faces of a man and his son, good-humoured little red-faced
bullocks, packed with life, who ran a pub in the Cowley Road near
the house where, later, he went to live.</p>

<p>It was a look round, full, ruddy, and serene in its good
nature and had more openness and mellow humour in it than Eugene
had found in the faces of the people in New England. It was more
like the look of country people and small-town people in the
South. Sometimes it had the open tranquil ruddiness, the bovine
and self-satisfied good humour of his uncle, Crockett Pentland,
and sometimes it was like Mr. Bailey, the policeman, whom the
negro killed one winter's night, when snow was on the ground and
all the bells began to ring. And then it was full and hearty like
the face of Mr. Ernest Pegram, who was the City Plumber and lived
next door to Eugene's father, or it was plump, common, kindly,
invincibly provincial, ignorant and domestic, like the face of
Mrs. Higginson, who lived across the street, and had herself been
born in England, who had a family of eight children and three
baking days a week, and was a playing, singing, and fanatic
Baptist; yet on her common kindly face was the same animal,
gentle, smoke-like delicacy of expression round the mouth that
some of these men and women had.</p>

<p>It was a life that seemed so near to Eugene that he could lay
his hand on it and make it his at any moment. He seemed to have
returned to a room he had always known, and to have paused for a
moment, without any doubt or perturbation of the soul, outside
the door.</p>

<p>But he never found the door, or turned the knob, or stepped
into the room. When he got there he couldn't find it. It was as
near as his hand if he could only reach it, only as high as his
heart and yet he could not reach it, only a hand's breadth off if
he would span it, a word away if he would speak it. Only a
stride, a move, a step away was all the peace, the certitude, the
joy--and home for ever--for which his life was panting, and he
was drowning in the darkness.</p>

<p>He never found it. The old smoke-gold of morning would be full
of hope and joy and imminent discovery but afternoon would come
and the soft grey humid skies pressed down on him with their huge
numb waste and weight and weariness of intolerable time, and the
empty naked desolation filled his body.</p>

<p>He would walk that legendary street past all those visible and
enchanted substances of time and see the students passing through
the college gates, the unbelievable velvet green of college
quads, and see the huge dark room of peace and joy that time had
made, and he had no way of getting into it.</p>

<p>Each day he walked about the town and breathed the accursed
languid softness of grey foreign air, that had no bite or sparkle
in it, and went by all their fabulous age-encrusted walls of
Gothic time, and wondered what in the name of God he had to do
with all their walls or towers, or how he could feed his hunger
on the portraits of the Spanish king, and why he was there, why
he had come!</p>

<p>Sometimes it was just a word, the intonation of a phrase--the
way they would say <i>"very"</i> or "A<i>mer</i>ican," which
chilled and withered all the ardours of the heart, or the way
they would say "Thank <i>you!"</i> when you paid for something,
crisply, courteously, yet with a quick, cautious, and obdurate
finality, as if someone had swiftly and firmly closed a door lest
you should try to enter it. Eugene could listen to them talk and
hear all the words, the moods and tones of life and humour that
he had known all his life, until it seemed that he could foresee
the very stories they were going to tell, the very situations
they were going to describe--and then in an instant all the
familiar pattern of their speech would vanish, and their words
could not have been stranger to him had they spoken in a foreign
tongue.</p>

<p>Thus, as Eugene looked at the young undergraduates playing in
the fields below the house, their shouts and cries, the boyish
roughness of their play, their strong scurfed knees, and panting
breath, evoked the image of a life so familiar to him that he
felt all he had to do to enter it again was to walk across the
velvet width of lawn that separated him from it. But if he passed
these same people two hours later in the High Street, their
lives, their words were stranger than in a dream, or they seemed
to have an incredible fictitious quality that made everything
they did or said seem false, mannered, and affected, so that when
he listened to them he had a feeling of resentment and contempt
for them as if they spoke and moved with the palpable falseness
of actors.</p>

<p>Eugene would see two young fellows before a college gate, and
one, fragile of structure, with a small lean head, a sheaf of
straight blond hair and thin sensitive features which were yet
sharply and strongly marked, would be talking to another youth,
his hands thrust jauntily into the pockets of his baggy grey
trousers as he talked and the worn elegance of his baggy coat
falling across his hands in folds of jaunty well-worn
smartness.</p>

<p>"I say!" the youth would be saying in his crisp, rapid,
sharply blurred inflections that seemed to come out of lips that
barely moved. "Where <i>were</i> you last night? We missed you at
the party in old Lambert's rooms, you know. Everyone wondered why
you didn't turn up."</p>

<p>"Oh," the other said (but the way he said this word sounded
almost like "Ow" to Eugene). "Did they? I'm frightfully sorry to
have missed it, but I simply couldn't get th&ouml;h. Had dinner
with a chap I know at Magdalen. His sister's down for a day or
so, and later on I simply couldn't break away.--How was the
party?"</p>

<p>"Ow!" the other cried, casting his head back with a strong
quick movement and an exultant little laugh. "Ripping! Simply
ripping! What a shame you had to miss it! Old Fenton got quite
squiffy about ten o'clock," he went on affectionately and with
his exultant little laugh, "and really it was priceless! He
insisted on doing an imitation of Queen Victoria sitting down to
read <i>The Times</i>--Ow!" he cried exultantly again, casting
his head up with a sharp strong movement, "the whole thing was
convulsing!--To see old Fenton <i>settle</i> down!" he cried, "to
see him <i>look</i> round <i>suspiciously,"</i> he whispered,
still maintaining the perfect dramatic sharpness of his
inflection as he looked round with a descriptive gesture, "to see
him wait <i>uneasily</i> to see what's going to happen--finally
to see the look of <i>blissful</i> satisfaction and contentment
gradually <i>stealing</i> over his face," he whispered
rapturously, "as he settles back to read <i>The Times</i> in
peace--<i>ow!"</i> he cried again, as he cast back his small head
with an exultant laugh, "--the whole thing was really <i>too</i>
superb!--it really was, you know! Lambert was quite convulsed! We
had to lift him up and stretch him out upon the bed before he got
his breath again."</p>

<p>In conversations such as these, in the choice and accent of
the words, the sharp crisp and yet blurred inflections of the
speech, even in the jaunty nonchalance of hands in pockets, the
hang and fold of the coat, in the exultant little laugh and the
sharp strong upward movement of the small lean head, there was
something alien, suave, and old. To Eugene it seemed to be the
style of a life that was far older, more suavely knowing and
mature, than any he had ever known, so that at such a time as
this, these young boys who on the playing fields had almost the
appearance of tousled overgrown urchins, now seemed far more
assured and sophisticated than he could ever be.</p>

<p>At the same time, the sound and inflection of their
words--their assured exercise of a style of language that knew
exactly where to use and how to inflect such words as "very,"
"quite," "superb," "priceless," "terribly," "marvellous," and so
on--this style and use seemed to Eugene almost false, fictional,
affected, and theatrical.</p>

<p>He felt this way chiefly because he had read about such people
all his life in books and for the most part had heard them speak
in this manner only in smart plays upon the stage. He was always
connecting these young Englishmen with actors in the theatre, and
for a moment his mind would resentfully accuse them of being
nothing but cheap and affected actors themselves and, bitterly,
of "trying to talk with an English accent"--a phrase which
obviously had no meaning, since they were only speaking their own
language in the way they had been taught to speak it.</p>

<p>But then, at tea-time, Eugene would see these youths again in
Buol's, flirting, with the clumsy na&iuml;vet&eacute; of a grubby
schoolboy, with a leering rawboned hag of a waitress, and
obviously getting the thrill of their lives from the spurious
grins which this dilapidated strumpet flashed at them through her
artificial teeth. Or, as he went up the road towards his house at
night, he would pass them standing in the dark shadows of the
stormy trees, with their arms clumsily clasped around the
buttocks of a servant girl, and their lives seemed unbelievably
young, naked, and innocent again.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Around Eugene was the whole structure of an enchanted life--a
life hauntingly familiar and just the way he had always known it
would be--and now that he was there, he had no way of getting
into it. The inn itself was ancient, legendary, beautiful, elfin,
like all the inns he had ever read about, and yet all of the
cheer, the warmth, the joy and comfort he had dreamed of finding
in an inn was lacking.</p>

<p>Upstairs the halls went crazily up and down at different
levels, one mounted steps, went down again, got lost and turned
around in the bewildering design of the ancient added-on-to
structure--and this was the way he had always known it would be.
But the rooms were small, cold, dark, and dreary, the lights were
dim and dismal, you stayed out of your room as much as possible
and when you went to bed at night you crawled in trembling
between clammy sheets, and huddled there until the bed was warm.
When you got up in the morning there was a small jug of warm
water at your door with which to shave, but the jug was too
small, you poured it out into the bowl and shaved yourself and
added cold water from the pitcher, then, in order to get enough
to wash your face and hands. Then you got out of the room and
went downstairs as quickly as you could.</p>

<p>Downstairs it would be fine. There would be a brisk fire
crackling in the hearth, the old smoke-gold of morning and the
smell of fog, the crisp cheerful voices of the people and their
ruddy competent morning look, and the cheerful smells of
breakfast, which was always liberal and good, the best meal that
they had: kidneys and ham and eggs and sausages and toast and
marmalade and tea.</p>

<p>But at night there would come the huge boiled-flannel
splendour of the dinner, the magnificent and prayerful service of
the waiter, who served you with such reverent grace from heavy
silver platters that you felt the food must be as good as
everything looked. But it never was.</p>

<p>Eugene ate at a large table, in the centre of the dining-room,
provided by a thoughtful management for such isolated waifs and
strays as himself. The food looked very good, and was, according
to the genius of the nation, tasteless. How they ever did it he
could never tell: everything was of the highest quality and you
chewed upon it mournfully, wearily, swallowing it with the dreary
patience of a man who has been condemned for ever to an exclusive
diet of boiled unseasoned spinach. There was a kind of evil
sorcery, a desolate and fathomless mystery in the way they could
take the choicest meats and vegetables and extract all the
succulence and native flavour from them, and then serve them up
to you magnificently with every atom of their former life reduced
to the general character of stewed hay or well-boiled
flannel.</p>

<p>There would be a thick heavy soup of dark mahogany, a piece of
boiled fish covered with a nameless, tasteless sauce of glutinous
white, roast beef that had been done to death in dish-water, and
solid, perfect, lovely brussels sprouts for whose taste there was
no name whatever. It might have been the taste of boiled wet
ashes, or the taste of stewed green leaves, with all the
bitterness left out, pressed almost dry of moisture, or simply
the taste of boiled clouds and rain and fog. For dessert, there
would be a pudding of some quivery yellow substance, beautifully
moulded, which was surrounded by a thin sweetish fluid of a
sticky pink. And at the end there would be a cup of black,
bitter, liquid mud.</p>

<p>Eugene felt as if these dreary ghosts of food would also come
to life at any moment, if he could only do some single simple
thing--make the gesture of an incantation, or say a prayer, or
speak a magic word, a word he almost had, but couldn't quite
remember.</p>

<p>The food plagued his soul with misery, bitter disappointment,
and bewilderment. For Eugene liked to eat, and they had written
about food better than anyone on earth. Since his childhood there
had burned in his mind a memory of the food they wrote about. It
was a memory drawn from a thousand books (of which <i>Quentin
Durward,</i> curiously, was one), but most of all it came from
that tremendous scene in <i>Tom Brown at Rugby,</i> which
described the boy's ride with his father through the frosty
darkness, in an English stage-coach, the pause for breakfast at
an inn, and the appearance of the host, jolly, red-faced,
hospitable, who had rushed out to welcome them.</p>

<p>Eugene could remember with a gluttonous delight the breakfast
which that hungry boy had devoured. It was a memory so touched
with the magic relish of frost and darkness, smoking horses, the
thrill, the ecstasy of the journey and a great adventure, the
cheer, the warmth, the bustle of the inn, and the delicious
abundance of the food they gave the boy, that the whole thing was
evoked with blazing vividness, and now it would almost drive
Eugene mad with hunger when he thought of it.</p>

<p>Now it seemed to him that these people had written so
magnificently about good food not because they always had it, but
because they had it rarely and therefore made great dreams and
fantasies about it, and it seemed to him that this same
quality--the quality of <i>lack</i> rather than of
<i>possession,</i> of desire rather than fulfilment--had got into
everything they did, and made them dream great dreams, and do
heroic acts, and had enriched their lives immeasurably.</p>

<p>They had been the greatest poets in the world because the love
and substance of great poetry were so rare among them. Their
poems were so full of the essential quality of sunlight because
their lives had known sunlight briefly, and so shot through with
the massy substance of essential gold (a matchless triumph of
light and colour and material in which they have beaten the whole
world by every standard of comparison) because their lives had
known so much fog and rain, so little gold. And they had spoken
best of April because April was so brief with them.</p>

<p>Thus from the grim grey of their skies they had alchemied
gold, and from their hunger, glorious food, and from the raw
bleakness of their lives and weathers they had drawn magic. And
what was good among them had been won sternly, sparely, bitterly,
from all that was ugly, dull, and painful in their lives, and,
when it came, was more rare and beautiful than anything on
earth.</p>

<p>But that also was theirs: it was another door Eugene could not
enter.</p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h1>LXIX</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Later, Eugene could remember everything except the way he
found the house and came to live there. But a man named Morison,
who was staying at the "Mitre" when Eugene got there, found the
house and gave him the address. He was a man of twenty-eight or
thirty years, but he constantly seemed younger, much younger, no
older than the average college youth, an illusion that was never
permanent, however, and never for a moment convincing, because
one felt constantly that everything about the man was
spurious.</p>

<p>He had been, he said, a lieutenant in the flying corps, and
had just the month before resigned his commission. And he said he
had resigned his commission because he had received an
appointment from the government in the African colonial service,
and had been sent up to the university to take a special six
months' course in Colonial Administration, after which he would
be "sent out" to assume his new duties in the Colonies. Finally,
he was, he said, by birth, an Edinburgh Scotsman, although his
family were by blood more English than Scotch, and he had lived
most of his life in England. His references to his family were
casual, easy, and indefinite, but carried with them, somehow, the
connotations of aristocratic distinction.</p>

<p>He referred to his father often, but always in this casual and
easy manner, as "the governor," and to his mother as "the mater,"
flinging in parenthetically with his easy nonchalance such a
statement as "of course, my whole crowd came from Devonshire"--a
statement which was unadorned and meaningless enough but that
somehow--God knows how--carried with it a wonderful evocation of
an ancestral seat, an ancient and distinguished name, the quiet
but impregnable position of one of the "old county families."</p>

<p>And yet, God knows how he did it: the man said nothing about
his people that might not be said of any modest little family,
and probably everything he said was true. He made no open
pretences to great name or wealth or ancient lineage, but in
these swift, casual, half-blurted-out references to "the
governor," "the mater," and so on, he projected perfectly a
legend of prestige and family that was most engaging in its sense
of style and dash and recklessness.</p>

<p>The design of this legend was perfectly familiar to everyone:
Eugene had read it a thousand times in the pages of books, but he
had never known anyone who could evoke it so perfectly, so
tellingly, and with such a non-committal economy of means, as
Morison. In this casual, charming, almost nakedly simple picture
of his life which he could suggest in a blurted-out phrase
without giving a shred of real information about himself, or
making a single admission of fact, the characters were few in
number, their lineaments broadly and forcibly outlined, and their
setting a familiar one.</p>

<p>In this setting Morison himself played the part of the dashing
young aristocrat, wild, reckless, and impetuous, always ready for
fun, fight, or frolic, a bottle of Scotch, or a pretty woman, a
roaring drunk, or a hot seduction--a mad hare-brained sort of
fellow who plunged impetuously forward into everything, but who
was somehow always saved from the odium that attaches itself to a
baser sort of drunkard, brawler, or seducer, because he had in
him those mysterious qualities of blood and character that made
of him "a gentleman," and therefore gave his acts a faultless
style, a whole immunity.</p>

<p>And the figure that he stroked in of his father was also a
pleasant one. For "the governor," although he existed chiefly for
the purpose of admonishment and reproof, as a curb upon the wild
spirits of his son, was neither a sour Puritan nor a grim-visaged
household tyrant, but really a very good and understanding sort
of fellow, and, within reasonable limits, as tolerant as anyone
could ask. The old boy, in fact, had been "a bit of a buck
himself" in his younger days, and had seen his share of the flesh
and the devil, and was quite willing to make allowances for the
wilder escapades of youth, so long as a reasonable decorum and
moderation were observed.</p>

<p>But there, alas! was the rub--as Morison himself would
ruefully admit. He was himself such a mad, scapegrace sort of
fellow that his acts sometimes passed all the bounds of decorum
and propriety, and for that reason "the governor" was always
"having him in upon the carpet."</p>

<p>There, in fact, was the whole setting. The governor existed
for the sole purpose of "having him in upon the carpet"--one
never saw them in any other way, but when Morison spoke about it
one saw them in <i>this</i> way with blazing vividness. And this
picture--the picture of Morison going in "upon the carpet"--was a
very splendid one.</p>

<p>First, one saw Morison pacing nervously up and down in a noble
and ancient hall, puffing distractedly on a cigarette and pausing
from time to time in an apprehensive manner before the grim,
closed barrier of an enormous seventeenth-century door which was
tall and wide enough for a knight in armour to ride through
without difficulty, and before whose gloomy and overwhelming
front Morison looked very small and full of guilt. Then, one saw
him take a last puff at his cigarette, brace his shoulders in a
determined manner, knock on the panels of the mighty door, and in
answer to a low growl within, open the door and advance
desperately into the shadowed depths of a room so immense and
magnificent that Morison looked like a single little sinner
walking forlornly down the nave of a cathedral.</p>

<p>At the end of this terrific room, across an enormous space of
carpet, sat "the governor." He was sitting behind a magnificent
flat desk of ancient carved mahogany, in the vast shadowed depths
behind him storeyed rows of old bound volumes climbed dizzily up
into the upper darkness and were lost. And men in armour were
standing grimly all around, and the portraits of the ancestors
shone faintly in the gloom, and the old worn mellow colours of
the tempered light came softly through the coloured glass of
narrow Gothic windows which were set far away in recessed depths
of the impregnable mortared walls.</p>

<p>Meanwhile "the governor" was waiting in grim silence as
Morison advanced across the carpet. The governor was a man with
beetling bushy eyebrows, silver hair, the lean, bitten and
incisive face, the cropped moustache of a man who has seen
service in old wars and commanded garrisons in India, and after
clearing his throat with a low menacing growl, he would peer
fiercely out at Morison beneath his bushy brows, and say: "Well,
young man?"--to which Morison would be able to make no answer,
but would just stand there in a state of guilty dejection.</p>

<p>And the talk that then passed between the outraged father and
the prodigal son was, from Morison's own account, astonishing. It
was a talk that was no talk, a talk that was almost incoherent
but that each understood perfectly, another language, not merely
an economy of words so spare that one word was made to do the
work of a hundred, but a series of grunts, blurts, oaths and
ejaculations, in which almost nothing was said that was
recognizable as ordered thought, but in which the meaning of
everything was perfectly conveyed.</p>

<p>The last outrageous episode that had brought Morison in to his
present position of guilt "upon the carpet" was rarely named by
name or given a description. Rather, as if affronted decency and
aristocratic delicacy could not endure discussion of an
unmentionable offence, his fault was indicated briefly as "that
sort of thing" (or simply "sort of thing," spoken fast and
slurringly)--and all the other passions and emotions of anger,
contrition, stern condemnation and reproof, and, at length, of
exhausted relief and escape, were conveyed in a series of broken
and jerky exclamations, such as: "After <i>all!"</i> "It's not as
if it were the first time you had played the bloody fool!" "What
I mean to say is!" "Damn it all, it's not that I mind the
wine-woman-song sort of thing--young myself once--no plaster
saint--never pretended that I was--man's own business if he keeps
it to himself--never interfered--only when you do a thing like
this and make a bloody show of yourself--you idiot!--sort of
thing men can understand but women!--it's your mother I'm
thinking of!" and so on.</p>

<p>Morison's own speech, in fact, was largely composed of phrases
such as these: he blurted them out so rapidly, scarcely moving
his lips and slurring his words over in such a broken and
explosive way that when one first met him it was hard to
understand what he was saying:--his speech seemed to be largely a
series of blurted-out phrases, such as "sort of thing," "after
<i>all!"</i> "what I mean to say is!" and so on. And yet this
incoherent and exclamatory style was curiously effective, for it
seemed to take the listener into its confidence in rather an
engaging manner which said: "Of course, there's no need to go
into detail about all this, because I can see you are a man of
the world and the same kind of fellow as I am. I know we
understand each other perfectly, and the truth of what I am
saying must be so self-evident that there's no point in
discussing it."</p>

<p>In stature, he was a little below the middle height, and
rather fleshy. In fact, although his jaunty and impetuous manners
gave him an air of boyishness, he was already getting fat around
the waist, and his neck was fat and there was a fold of flesh
beneath his chin. His face was very ruddy, smooth, a little
alcoholic, and he had a small blond moustache with waxed ends.
Finally, his hair was thick, sleek, of a dark taffy-coloured
blond which shaded off into roots of fine silken blondish white
at the edges of his temples.</p>

<p>He could almost have passed for the average Oxford youth if it
had not been for the roll of fat beneath his chin and the
blurred, veinous, and yellowed look of his eyes, and he could
almost have passed for the dashing gentleman whose lineaments he
could so deftly and cleverly sketch in a few boldly casual
strokes had it not been that there was something spurious in his
character that gave him away in everything he did or said.</p>

<p>And yet Eugene never knew just what this spurious quality was.
He felt at once that the man was fraudulent and unfortunate, and
that all he told about himself was fraudulent, and yet everything
he told was not only natural and credible enough but even
plausible. All he said was that he had been a lieutenant in the
flying corps, and had recently resigned, and had been given an
appointment in the Colonies and been sent to Oxford for a course
in Colonial Administration, and that later he would be sent to
Africa.</p>

<p>Later on, Eugene understood that all of this was probably
true, but at the time it sounded like a lie. Or, if it was not a
lie, he thought that there was something discreditable and
shameful behind it. He thought that if Morison had been in the
army flying service, as he said, he had resigned not from choice
but because he had to--because he had been caught cheating at
cards, or had not paid his debts, or had been mixed up in some
unwholesome mess with a woman. And he thought that if Morison
were now going out to Africa it was not so much from choice as by
compulsion--because he had to go. In the years that followed
Eugene saw that these suspicions were probably unfounded and
unjust, but that was the way Morison made him feel.</p>

<p>There was about him, somehow, the look of the ruined
adventurer--shabby and run-down--the face of the actor shining
through its mask of deft gentility, the face of the charlatan
looking through its visage of sincerity, and the old veined
yellow eyes of ruin, hopelessness, and loss looking through all
his attitudes of youth, infectious spontaneity, and grace. And
for this reason, somehow, the man seemed pitiably gallant, and
Eugene liked him.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>He and Morison would go to different pubs and drink until the
closing time. Morison was using him vilely, and Eugene knew it
and did not care. Not only was he paying for three drinks of
every four they drank, but he knew that Morison also sought his
companionship because he thought it gave him some immunity from
the college proctors when they made their visits to a pub. And
this, in fact, he admitted very frankly and with a disarming
gleefulness.</p>

<p>"You see," he said, "if I came in here by myself I'd get
progged, but as long as I'm with you I'm probably all right."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Oh," he said, with an exultant little chuckle, "because they
don't know what to make of it! They've got their eye on
<i>me,</i> all right," he laughed. "They've been giving me some
very fishy looks--but when they see <i>you</i> here, they can't
be sure--they don't know what to make of it!"</p>

<p>"Why don't they?"</p>

<p>"Oh," he said, "they're puzzled about me, but they <i>know</i>
about you--they don't dare to bother you because they know you're
not in the university."</p>

<p>"How do they know it?" he said resentfully. "I look as much
like a student as these Rhodes scholars that you see--yes, and a
damned sight more than most of them!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know," he said tolerantly. "Still, they know you're
not. They've got a way of telling."</p>

<p>"A way of telling! Good God, Morison, how have they got a way
of telling? Do you mean to say they memorize the names and faces
of all the students here, the day the term commences?"</p>

<p>"No, it isn't that. You see, old boy, you don't <i>belong</i>
to them--I don't know what it is, but they have a way of their
own of knowing."</p>

<p>"Do you mean that there's some damned mystery about it?--that
they've got some supernatural gift of intuition that tells them
when you're a student and when you're not?"</p>

<p>"Quite!" he said. "That's just it. That's just the way they do
it!" And he looked at Eugene for a moment with his blurred,
veinous eyes, and laughed softly, good-naturedly, a little
mockingly. "Curious, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"It's more than curious. It's a miracle!"</p>

<p>But it seemed that he was right. For sometimes the proctors
would come into a pub where they were drinking, speak amicably to
everyone, and in a moment more go out again, but Morison would
grow very quiet while they were there, and lean upon the bar, and
look down at his drink until they left. And as they left they
would look curiously at both men again, and their eye would pass
Eugene swiftly and indifferently, and for a moment fix on Morison
with a fishy and suspicious look. When they were gone he would
look up again at the grinning bar-tender and, his ruddy face
suffused with laughter, say exultantly:</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>priceless!</i> Did you see him when he looked at
me?"</p>

<p>"I did," the man behind the counter said. "He didn't half know
what to make of it, did he? The other gentleman is not a student,
<i>is</i> he?"</p>

<p>"No!" Morison fairly shouted, his face crimson, as he pounded
on the bar. "That's just the point! And they don't know what to
make of it when they see me with him! They can't be sure!" he
choked. "They can't be sure!"</p>

<p>And it was Morison who found the house out on the Ventnor
road, took lodgings there himself, and gave Eugene the
address.</p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h1>LXX</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>In the autumn of that year, Eugene lived about a mile out from
town in a house set back from the Ventnor Road. The house was
called a "farm"--Hill-top Farm, or Far-end Farm, or some such
name as that--but it was really no farm at all. It was a
magnificent house of the weathered grey stone they have in that
country, as if in the very quality of the wet heavy air there is
the soft thick grey of time itself, sternly yet beautifully
soaking down for ever on you--and enriching everything it
touches--grass, foliage, brick, ivy, the fresh moist colour of
the people's faces, and old grey stone, with the incomparable
weathering of time.</p>

<p>The house was set back off the road at a distance of several
hundred yards, possibly a quarter of a mile, and one reached it
by means of a road bordered by rows of tall trees which arched
above the road, and which made Eugene think of home, at night
when the stormy wind howled in their tossed branches. On each
side of the road were the Rugby fields of two of the colleges and
in the afternoon he could look out and down and see the fresh
moist green of the playing fields and watch young college
fellows, dressed in their shorts and jerseys, and with their bare
knees scurfed with grass and turf as they twisted, struggled,
swayed, and scrambled for a moment in the scrimmage-circle, and
then broke free, running, dodging, passing the ball as they were
tackled, filling the moist air with their sharp cries of sport.
They did not have the desperate, the grimly determined, the
almost professional earnestness that the college teams at home
have; their scurfed and muddy knees, their swaying scrambling
scrimmages, the swift breaking away and running, their panting
breath and crisp clear voices gave them the appearance of
grown-up boys.</p>

<p>Once when Eugene had come up the road in the afternoon while
they were playing, the ball got away from them and came bounding
out into the road before him, and he ran after it to retrieve it,
as he used to do when passing a field where boys were playing
baseball. One of the players came over to the edge of the field
and stood there waiting with his hands upon his hips while Eugene
got the ball: he was panting hard, his face was flushed, and his
blond hair tousled, but when Eugene threw the ball to him, he
said "Thanks very much!" crisply and courteously--getting the
same sound into the word <i>"very"</i> that they got in
<i>"</i>A<i>mer</i>ican," a sound that always repelled Eugene a
little because it seemed to have some scornful aloofness and
patronage in it.</p>

<p>For a moment Eugene watched him as he trotted briskly away on
to the field again: the players stood there waiting, panting,
casual, their hands upon their hips; he passed the ball into the
scrimmage, the pattern swayed, rocked, scrambled, and broke
sharply out in open play again, and everything looked incredibly
strange, near, and familiar.</p>

<p>Eugene felt that he had always known it, that it had always
been his, and that it was as familiar to him as everything he had
seen or known in his childhood. Even the texture of the earth
looked familiar, and felt moist and firm and springy when he
stepped on it, and the stormy howling of the wind in that avenue
of great trees at night was wild and desolate and demented as it
had been when he was eight years old and would lie in his bed at
night and hear the great oaks howling on the hill above his
father's house.</p>

<p>The name of the people in the house was Coulson: he made
arrangements with the woman at once to come and live there: she
was a tall, weathered-looking woman of middle age, they talked
together in the hall. The hall was made of marble flags and went
directly out on to a gravelled walk.</p>

<p>The woman was crisp, cheerful, and worldly-looking. She was
still quite handsome. She wore a well-cut skirt of woollen plaid
and a silk blouse: when she talked she kept her arms folded
because the air in the hall was chilly, and she held a cigarette
in the fingers of one hand. A shaggy brown dog came out and nosed
upward toward her hand as she was talking and she put her hand
upon its head and scratched it gently. When Eugene told her he
wanted to move in the next day, she said briskly and
cheerfully:</p>

<p>"Right you are! You'll find everything ready when you get
here!" Then she asked if he was at the university. He said no,
and added, with a feeling of difficulty and naked desolation,
that he was a "writer," and was coming there to work. He was
twenty-four years old.</p>

<p>"Then I am sure that what you do will be <i>very, very</i>
good!" she said cheerfully and decisively. "We have had several
Americans in the house before and all of them were very clever!
All the Americans we have had here were very clever people," said
the woman. "I'm sure that you will like it." Then she walked to
the door with him to say good-bye. As they stood there, there was
the sound of a small motorcar coming to a halt and in a moment a
girl came swiftly across the gravel space outside and entered the
hall. She was tall, slender, very lovely, but she had the same
bright hard look in her eye that the woman had, the same faint,
hard smile round the edges of her mouth.</p>

<p>"Edith," the woman said in her crisp curiously incisive tone,
"this young man is an American--he is coming here tomorrow." The
girl looked at Eugene for a moment with her hard bright glance,
thrust out a small gloved hand, and shook hands briefly, a swift
firm greeting.</p>

<p>"Oh! How d'ye do?" she said. "I hope you will like it here."
Then she went on down the hall, entered a room on the left, and
closed the door behind her.</p>

<p>Her voice had been crisp and certain like her mother's, but it
was also cool, young, and sweet, with music in it, and later as
Eugene went down the road, he could still hear it.</p>

<p>That was a wonderful house, and the people there were
wonderful people. Later, he could not forget them. He seemed to
have known them all his life, and to know all about their lives.
They seemed as familiar to him as his own blood and he knew them
with a knowledge that went deep below the roots of thought or
memory. They did not talk together often, or tell any of their
lives to one another. It is very hard to tell about it--the way
they felt and lived together in that house--because it was one of
those simple and profound experiences of life which people seem
always to have known when it happens to them, but for which there
is no language.</p>

<p>And yet, like a child's half-captured vision of some magic
country he has known, and which haunts his days with strangeness
and the sense of imminent, glorious rediscovery, the word that
would unlock it all seemed constantly to be almost on their lips,
waiting, just outside the gateway of their memory, just a shape,
a phrase, a sound away, the moment that they chose to utter
it--but when they tried to say the thing, something faded within
their minds like fading light, and something melted within their
grasp like painted smoke, and something went for ever when they
tried to touch it.</p>

<p>The nearest Eugene could come to it was this: In that house he
sometimes felt the greatest peace and solitude that he had ever
known. But he always knew the other people in the house were
there. He could sit in his sitting-room at night and hear nothing
but the stormy moaning of the wind outside in the great trees,
the small gaseous flare and jet from time to time of the coal
fire burning in the grate--and silence, strong living lonely
silence that moved and waited in the house at night--and he would
always know that they were there.</p>

<p>He did not have to hear them enter or go past his door, nor
did he have to hear doors close or open in the house, or listen
to their voices: if he had never seen them, heard them, spoken to
them, it would have been the same--he would have known they were
there.</p>

<p>It was something he had always known, and he had known it
would happen to him, and now it was there with all the
strangeness and dark mystery of an awaited thing. He knew them,
felt them, lived among them with a familiarity that had no need
of sight or word or speech. And the memory of that house and of
his silent fellowship with all the people there was somehow mixed
with an image of dark time. It was one of those sorrowful and
unchanging images which, among all the blazing stream of images
that passed constantly their stream of fire across his mind, was
somehow fixed, detached, and everlasting, full of a sorrow,
certitude, and mystery that he could not fathom, but that wore
for ever on it the old sad light of waning day--a light from
which all the heat, the violence, and the substance of furious
dusty day had vanished and which was itself like time,
unearthly-of-the-earth, remote, detached, and everlasting.</p>

<p>And that fixed and changeless image of dark time was this: In
an old house of time Eugene lived alone, and yet had other people
all around him, and they never spoke to him or he to them. They
came and went, like silence in the house, but he always knew that
they were there. He would be sitting by a window in a room, and
he would know then that they were moving in the house, and
darkness, sorrow, and strong silence dwelt within them, and their
eyes were quiet, full of sorrow, peace, and knowledge, and their
faces dark, their tongues silent, and they never spoke. Eugene
could not remember how their faces looked, but they were all
familiar to him as his father's face, and they had known one
another for ever, and they lived together in the ancient house of
time, dark time; and silence, sorrow, certitude, and peace were
in them. Such was the image of dark time that was to haunt his
life thereafter, and into which, somehow, his life among the
people in that house had passed.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>In the house that year there lived, besides Eugene and
Morison, the Coulsons, father and mother and their daughter, and
three men who had taken rooms together and who were employed in a
factory where motor-cars were made, two miles from town.</p>

<p>Perhaps the reason that Eugene could never forget these people
later and seemed to know them all so well was that there was in
all of them something ruined, lost, or broken--some precious and
irretrievable quality which had gone out of them and which they
could never get back again. Perhaps that was the reason that he
liked them all so much, because with ruined people it is either
love or hate: there is no middle way. The ruined people that we
like are those who desperately have died, and lost their lives
because they loved life dearly, and had that grandeur that makes
such people spend prodigally the thing they love the best, and
risk and lose their lives because life is so precious to them,
and die at length because the seeds of life are in them. It is
only the people that love life who die in this way--and these are
the ruined people that we like.</p>

<p>The people in the house were people who had lost their lives
because they loved the earth too well, and somehow had been slain
by their hunger. And for this reason Eugene liked them all, and
could not forget them later: there seemed to have been some magic
which had drawn them all together to that house, as if the house
itself were a magnetic centre for lost people.</p>

<p>Certainly, the three men who worked at the motor-car factory
had been drawn together for this reason. Two were still young men
in their early twenties. The third man was much older. He was a
man past forty, his name was Nicholl, he had served in the army
during the war and had attained the rank of captain.</p>

<p>He had the spare, alert, and jaunty figure that one often
finds in army men, an almost professional military quality that
somehow seemed to set his figure upon a horse as if he had grown
there, or had spent a lifetime in the cavalry. His face, also,
had the same lean, bitten, professional military quality: his
speech, although good-natured and very friendly, was clipped,
incisive, jerky, and sporadic, his lean weather-beaten face was
deeply, sharply scarred and sunken in the flanks, and he wore a
small cropped moustache, and displayed long frontal teeth when he
smiled--a spare, gaunt, toothy, yet attractive smile.</p>

<p>His left arm was withered, shrunken, almost useless, part of
his hand and two of the fingers had been torn away by the blast
or explosion which had destroyed his arm, but it was not this
mutilation of the flesh that gave one the sense of a life that
had been ruined, lost, and broken irretrievably. In fact, one
quickly forgot his physical injury: his figure looked so spare,
lean, jaunty, well-conditioned in its energetic fitness that one
never thought of him as a cripple, nor pitied him for any
disability. No: the ruin that one felt in him was never of the
flesh, but of the spirit. Something seemed to have been torn away
from his life--it was not the nerve-centres of his arm, but of
his soul, that had been destroyed. There was in the man somewhere
a terrible dead vacancy and emptiness, and the spare, lean figure
that he carried so well seemed only to surround this vacancy like
a kind of shell.</p>

<p>He was always smartly dressed in clothes that sat well on his
trim spruce figure. He was always in good spirits, immensely
friendly in his clipped spare way, and he laughed frequently--a
rather metallic cackle which came suddenly and ended as swiftly
as it had begun. He seemed, somehow, to have locked the door upon
dark care and worry, and to have flung the key away--to have
lost, at the same time that he lost more precious things, all the
fretful doubts and perturbations of conscience than most men
know.</p>

<p>Now, in fact, he seemed to have only one serious project in
his life. This was to keep himself amused, to keep himself
constantly amused, to get from his life somehow the last atom of
entertainment it could possibly yield, and in this project the
two young men who lived with him joined in with an energy and
earnestness which suggested that their employment in the
motor-car factory was just a necessary evil which most be borne
patiently because it yielded them the means with which to carry
on a more important business, the only one in which their lives
were interested--the pursuit of pleasure.</p>

<p>And in the way in which they conducted this pursuit there was
an element of deliberate calculation, concentrated earnestness,
and focal intensity of purpose that was astounding, grotesque,
and unbelievable, and that left in the mind of one who saw it a
formidable and disquieting memory because there was in it almost
the madness of desperation, the deliberate intent to seek
oblivion, at any cost of effort, from some hideous emptiness of
the soul.</p>

<p>Captain Nicholl and his two young companions had a little
motorcar so small that it scuttled up the road, shot around and
stopped in the gravel by the door with the abruptness of a
wound-up toy. It was astonishing that three men could wedge
themselves into this midget of a car, but wedge themselves they
did, and used it to the end of its capacity, scuttling away to
work in it in the morning, and scuttling back again when work was
done, and scuttling away to London every Saturday, as if they
were determined to wrest from this small motor, too, the last
ounce of pleasure to be got from it.</p>

<p>Finally, Captain Nicholl and his two companions had made up an
orchestra among them, and this they played in every night when
they got home. One of the young men, who was a tall fellow with
blond hair which went back in even corrugated waves across his
head as if it had been marcelled, played the piano; the other,
who was slight and dark, and had black hair, performed upon a
saxophone, and Captain Nicholl himself took turns at thrumming
furiously on a banjo, or rattling a tattoo upon the complex
arrangement of trap drums, bass drums, and clashing cymbals that
surrounded him.</p>

<p>They played nothing but American jazz music or sobbing
crooner's rhapsodies or nigger blues. Their performance was
astonishing. Although it was contrived solely for their own
amusement, they hurled themselves into it with all the
industrious earnestness of professional musicians employed by a
night-club or dance hall to furnish dance music for the patrons.
The little dark fellow who played the saxophone would bend and
weave prayerfully with his grotesque instrument, as the fat
gloating notes came from its unctuous throat, and from time to
time he would sway in a half-circle or get up and prance forward
and back in rhythm to the music, as the saxophone players in
dance orchestras sometimes do.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the tall blond fellow at the piano would sway and
bend above the keys, glancing around from time to time with
little nods and smiles as if he were encouraging an orchestra of
forty pieces or beaming happily at a dance floor crowded with
paying customers.</p>

<p>While this was going on, Captain Nicholl would be thrumming
madly on the strings of a banjo. He kept the instrument gripped
somehow below his withered arm, fingering the end strings with
his two good fingers, knocking the tune out with his good right
hand, and keeping time with a beating foot. Then with a sudden
violent movement he would put the banjo down, snatch up the
sticks of the trap drum, and begin to rattle out a furious
accompaniment, beating the bass drum with his foot meanwhile, and
reaching over to smash cymbals, chimes, and metal rings from time
to time. He played with a kind of desperate fury, his mouth fixed
in a strange set grin, his bright eyes burning with a sharp wild
glint of madness.</p>

<p>They sang as they played, bursting suddenly into the refrain
of some popular song with the same calculated spontaneity and
spurious enthusiasm of the professional orchestra, mouthing the
words of negro blues and jazz with an obvious satisfaction, with
an accent which was remarkably good, and yet which had something
foreign and inept in it that made the familiar phrases of
American music sound almost as strange in their mouths as if an
orchestra of skilful patient Japanese were singing them.</p>

<p>They sang:</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Yes, sir! That's my baby<br>
 Yes, sir! Don't mean maybe<br>
 Yes, sir! That's my baby now!"</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>or:</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Oh, it ain't gonna rain no more, no more<br>
 It ain't gonna rain no more"</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>or:</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>"I got dose blu-u-ues"--</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>the young fellow at the piano rolling his eyes round in a
ridiculous fashion, and mouthing out the word "blues"
extravagantly as he sang it, the little dark fellow bending
forward in an unctuous sweep as the note came gloating fatly from
the horn, and Captain Nicholl swaying sideways in his chair as he
strummed upon the banjo strings, and improvising a mournful
accompaniment of his own, somewhat as follows: "I got dose
blu-u-ues! Yes, suh! Oh! I got dose blues! Yes, suh! I sure have
got 'em--dose blu-u-ues--blu-u-ues--blu-u-ues!--" his mouth never
relaxing from its strange fixed grin, nor his eyes from their
bright set stare of madness as he swayed and strummed and sang
the words that came so strangely from his lips.</p>

<p>It was a weird scene, an incredible performance, and somehow
it pierced the heart with a wild nameless pity, an infinite
sorrow and regret.</p>

<p>Something precious, irrecoverable, had gone out of them, and
they knew it. They fought the emptiness in them with this
deliberate, formidable, and mad intensity of a calculated gaiety,
a terrifying mimicry of mirth, and the storm-wind howled around
them in dark trees, and Eugene felt that he had known them for
ever, and had no words to say to them--and no door.</p>

<h1>LXXI</h1>

<p> </p>

<p>Once or twice a week Eugene went into town and had tea in the
rooms of a boyhood friend whom he had known at school and who was
now a Rhodes scholar at Merton College. The name of this youth
was Johnny Park: he was a good-natured, industrious, and rather
plodding boy, and thus far that patient, diligent and
well-ordered plan of life which he had followed since his
childhood had brilliantly succeeded. Formed in a native air, and
followed out beneath familiar skies, that plan had never been
interrupted by any doubt or strangeness, by any serious
difficulty or dark confusion of the soul, or by any of the
unforeseen surprises, shocks, or bewilderments of chance which
break upon our lives with storm-like fury and twist our precious
plans awry.</p>

<p>Therefore, when he had been awarded the Rhodes scholarship a
few months before, during his last year at the university, it
seemed that Johnny's plan of life was marching onto its
inevitable fulfilment. Everyone had known he would be appointed;
it came to pass with an ordained precision, and Johnny had
announced, just as he should, that he would study "International
Law," and everything was right and proper as it ought to be, and
now he was here to march onward toward his shining goal, as he
had always done.</p>

<p>But, for the first time in his life, something had gone wrong,
something had gone terribly, appallingly amiss, and Johnny did
not yet know what it was. Perhaps he never would, but now he was
in the greatest trouble and confusion of his life, and he knew
it. His voice was still slow, drawling, and good-natured, he was
full of kindly warmth and friendliness as he had always been, he
had responded quickly, dutifully, to all the customs and
observances of the new life--had had grey baggy trousers and
tweed coats made at the tailor's shop, had made arrangements for
trips and walking-tours upon the Continent with his fellows in
vacation time, had met his tutors, found out about the proctors
and the penalties, learned the system of the college bills and
battels, joined the Union and learned to go out dutifully for
sports in the afternoon--he had even learned the mysterious
ceremonial of tea and had it in his rooms each afternoon--all
this he had learned and done with a punctilious thoroughness; but
something had gone wrong.</p>

<p>Everything about Johnny was just as it had always been--his
smile, his slow, good-natured voice, his amiable warmth and
modesty and friendliness--all was the same with him except his
eyes. But the quiet, thoughtful, tranquilly assured expression of
his eyes had changed: he had in them the stunned, bewildered
look, full of pain and a groping confusion, of a man who has been
brutally slugged at the base of the brain and is not yet certain
what has happened to him.</p>

<p>His was an impossible situation, a tragic ordeal of
loneliness, strangeness, and bewilderment among all the complex
and alien forms of a new life for which nothing in the old had
prepared him. Born in a small town in the South, going to school
there and at his own State University, he had all his life
breathed and lived in a familiar air, heard the familiar words of
well-known voices all round him, known and seen nothing but
assurance, certitude and success in everything he planned.</p>

<p>And now all this, even the earth beneath his feet, had melted
from him like a wisp of smoke, and he was wandering blindly about
in a life as strange to him as Asia, as far as the moon, and knew
nowhere to turn, nothing to grasp, no door to enter. In his whole
life he had never seen or visited a great city, and then had seen
New York just for a day or two, and then for seven days had known
for the first time the mystery of the sea and a great ship, and
now was here in the green English country, in an ancient town,
hurled cruelly, suddenly, naked and unprepared for it as he was,
into a life more subtle, complex and confusing than his placid
soul had ever dreamed a life could be.</p>

<p>When Eugene asked him if he had stopped in London on his way
to Oxford, the look of pain and bewilderment in his eyes had
deepened, and he had answered in a slow confused voice:</p>

<p>"We stopped there overnight but we never got to see much of
it. We came on out here the next morning."</p>

<p>The boy was silent a moment, then he laughed good-naturedly
with a troubled and uncertain note.</p>

<p>"It sure looked big enough from what I could see of it. I want
to get down there some time to see what it is like. I guess I've
got a lot to learn," he said.</p>

<p>He could remember London like a man who is whirled blindly at
night through a huge, limitless, smoky kaleidoscope of sound and
sight and moving objects, and this memory of that enormous
terrifying age-encrusted web of life--that web without end or
measure, which seems blackened, soaked, and saturated not only in
the grey light that falls upon it with its weight of eight
million lives, but also by the grey light of compacted centuries
and all the countless men who lived there and have died--that
great grey web appropriately known to seafaring men as "The
Smoke" had added measurably to the sense of bewilderment, terror,
and naked desolation in him.</p>

<p>And it was pitifully the same with all the rest of them--the
little group of Rhodes scholars that gathered together in
Johnny's rooms every afternoon, and who seemed to huddle and
cling together desperately as if they would try to shape, to
resurrect, or to create some little pattern of familiar life,
some small oasis of warmth and friendliness and familiar things
to which they turned with desperate relief from all the alien and
hostile loneliness of a life which they had never entered, which
they could never make their own, which stood against them like a
wall they could not pass, closed against them like a door they
could not open.</p>

<p>Curiously, among this group of five or six Rhodes scholars,
which formed the nucleus of the group which met in Johnny's
rooms, only two--Johnny and his room-mate, a youth named
Price--were first-year men. The others were either in the second
or the final year of their appointments, but they seemed to have
made no friendships with anyone save with a few of the other
Rhodes men, to have no other place to go, and to welcome the
hospitality of these two boys with a desperate unspoken
gratefulness.</p>

<p>There were, besides Johnny and his room-mate Price, three
others who came there every day. One was a chunky, red-faced
fellow, with coarse undistinguished features, who parted his
short crinkly hair in the middle and had come there from Brown
University, where he had been a member of the football team. He
was in his second year abroad, and no longer wore his little
golden football, but a good deal of his self-satisfied
complacency was intact: he was thicker of hide and sense than any
of the others, and evidently felt that his three years at Oxford
were going to give him a kind of pick-and-choose freedom with any
kind of employment when he got back home.</p>

<p>He asked Eugene how much he had been paid by the university in
New York City where he had been employed as an instructor, and
when Eugene told him, smiled tolerantly, saying that he wouldn't
mind "trying it for a year after I get back until I have a chance
to look round." He then informed Eugene graciously that he was
open to an offer, and would even be willing to work for no more
than they paid <i>him,</i> while he "looked round." He added with
a little smile:</p>

<p>"I don't imagine that I'll have much trouble: a man with an
Oxford degree gets snapped up pretty quick over there, doesn't
he? Still," he went on magnanimously, "I wouldn't mind living in
New York a year or two until I settle down--so you can give my
name to them, if you don't mind."</p>

<p>The other two in the group that came to Johnny's rooms were
both third-year men. One was a frail, sensitive, and
&aelig;sthetic-looking youth named Sterling. Although he came
from one of the Western states--Arizona or New Mexico--there was
nothing in him to suggest the wildness, openness, and grandeur of
his native scenery. Rather, he was a most precious, a most
subtle, elegantly sad, quietly bitter and disdainful fellow: he
was quietly, fervently, subtly a devoted follower of Mr. T. S.
Eliot, and although he revealed his theories sparely, cautiously,
and by evasive indirectness, there was in all he said a quiet air
of more-in-this-than-meets-the-eye, as if he were saying: "If you
want to follow me you've got to learn to read between the lines
and get my meaning by what is implied rather than by what is
said--since there's no language that can say exactly what my
meaning--which is too subtle and exact for any language--is."</p>

<p>He wore about him always this air of elegant, cold, and
slightly disdainful restraint, and he had a habit of looking
across his thin arched hands with a faint disdainful smile, and
listening coldly, saying nothing, while the others talked, as if
the waste-land chatter of their tongues, the waste-land vacancy
of their lost waste-land souls was something that he knew he must
endure, but would endure with his cold faint disdainful smile,
his soul steeped in cold and patient weariness till death should
mercifully release him.</p>

<p>The other man was a Jew named Fried, and that man Eugene could
never forget. Eugene didn't know where he came from, how he got
there, who made him a Rhodes scholar, but he knew that of them
all, save Johnny, he was the only one who had maintained his
integrity, the only one who did not have a spurious, fearful,
uneasily evasive quality, the only one who came out with it, the
whole packed load of bitterness and hate within him, the only one
who had remained himself.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was a bad self to remain: it was certainly a self
that was lacking in charm, that had the aggressive, abusive,
curiously unrighteous quality of his race--but there he was,
terrifically himself and unashamed of it--with a naked formidable
integrity of self that blazed with a hard and naked light of a
cut jewel, and that Eugene could never forget even when the
characters of the rest of them had grown blurred and shapeless
and obscure.</p>

<p>Eugene didn't know where he came from, but he was sure it was
from one of the great cities of the Atlantic seaboard--from New
York, Boston, Baltimore or Philadelphia. He had seen his face,
his figure, and his kind a million times upon the pavements of
those cities and incredibly now, that dark unhappy face which
never before had seemed to him to be a face at all, nothing but a
tidal flood of nameless faces, that strident and abusive tongue
which had never before seemed to him to be a single tongue, but
just a common, nameless, and unnumbered ugliness of rasping
voices, an anathema of bitter cries and harsh derisions--a
constant phrase, a dissonance, a weather of the city's life--all
that had been nameless, faceless, characterless and obscure--the
look, the sound, the smell of the man-swarm ciphers of the city
as dark-eyed, dark-faced, and bitter-tongued they swarmed along
the pavements of the cities--all this, in that strange place, was
suddenly, weirdly, resumed into a single character--a character
that was hard, bitter, unforgettably itself, and that no change
of sky or land or custom, nor the huge impact of all the alien
and formidable pageantry of the earth, could ever alter by a
jot.</p>

<p>Theirs was a wretched, hopeless, lonely life, a futile,
feeble, barren life, an impossible, groping, wretched insecure
life--and Fried was the only one of them to meet it, to admit it,
to denounce it with all the bitterness of his bitter soul, and to
remain himself against it. The rest were frightened, bitter,
lonely, homesick, and afraid--afraid of everything, afraid of
their own loneliness and their own dismal unsuccess, afraid to
confess the desolation of their souls, the bitter disappointment
of their hopes, afraid to laugh too loud, to show too much
exuberance or enthusiasm for anything, lest someone should
consider them a "hearty," and pin that feared and hated label on
them.</p>

<p>They were afraid to express any native extravagance in dress,
speech or manner lest they be branded as "bounders," afraid to
talk their natural speech in their own manner lest they seem too
crudely, raucously and offensively American, and afraid to
imitate too studiously the language of the nation for fear that
their own fellows would sneer at them for servile snobbishness,
for "speaking with an English accent." Thus, caught in the web of
a thousand fears, the meshes of a thousand impossible restraints,
trying to maintain their lives, their characters, their native
dignities even while they tried to subdue them by a thousand
small half-mimicries, to be themselves even while they tried to
shape themselves to something else, their characters finally,
strained through the impossible weavings of this mad design,
teetering frantically to maintain a crazy balance on a thousand
wires, were reduced at last to the consistency of blubber--and
trying to be everything, they succeeded finally in being
nothing.</p>

<p>Oh, it was a wretched, futile, hopeless kind of life, and in
their hearts they knew it, but could only speak casually, smile
feebly, speak falsely, yet never lay their hearts bare boldly and
admit the truth. None of them liked Fried; they were ashamed of
him, they turned on him at times in force, argued with him,
denounced him, jeered at him, but at the bottom of their hearts
they had a strange, secret, and unwilling respect for him, and
finally grew silent and listened when he talked.</p>

<p>It was astonishing to watch the effect of that man's bitter
tirades on that forlorn group. For where at first they would
protest, remonstrate, sharply caution him, laugh uneasily and
look fearfully toward the door as his harsh rasping voice mounted
and grew high and snarling with its packed anathema of bitterness
and hate, they would at length grow silent and look at him with
fascinated eyes, and listen to that snarling and savage
indictment with a kind of feeding gluttony of satisfaction, as if
into that single naked and abusive tongue had been packed the
whole huge weight of misery that had sweltered in their hearts,
but to which they had never dared, themselves, to give
utterance.</p>

<p>Eugene had asked Sterling how much longer he would remain
abroad and he had answered:</p>

<p>"Just ten months more. This is my last year. I am going home
next August." He was silent for a moment, then he added with a
faint, regretful smile: "In another year I suppose, I'll be
wondering if all this has ever happened. It will seem strange and
beautiful," he said softly, "like some impossible dream!"</p>

<p>"Yeah!" snarled Fried, with a harsh interruption at this
point. "An impossible dream! Jesus! An impossible
nightmare!--that's what you'd better say!"</p>

<p>Sterling looked at him silently for a moment over his thin
arched hands. He smiled faintly, disdainfully, and made no
answer. In a moment he turned quietly to Eugene again, and
dismissing the other man with the cold contempt of silence,
continued:</p>

<p>"Sometimes it's hard for me to realize I ever lived there. Can
there be such a place as America, I wonder?" he said with a sad
faint smile. "After all this," he gestured slightly, pausing, "it
will seem so strange to be a part of"--he paused carefully
"--<i>that</i> again. . . . Skyscrapers, subways, elevated
trains--" he paused again, with a faint smile--"Tell me," he
said, turning toward Eugene, "do such things <i>really</i>
exist?"</p>

<p>"Do they <i>really</i> exist!" Fried now snarled with a
jeering laugh. "Do they <i>really</i> exist! I'll tell the
cock-eyed world that they exist!" he rasped. "You can bet your
----- that they exist! . . . Do they exist!" he snorted to
himself derisively. "Jesus!"</p>

<p>Sterling stared coldly at him and said nothing. For a moment
Fried's hard, dark, embittered face, the feverish eyes, stared
balefully at the fragile and sensitive face of the other youth,
set disdainfully against him over his arched hands.</p>

<p>"Where do you get that stuff?" Fried said at length with harsh
contempt. "You may kid these guys who never saw the place until a
week ago, but you don't kid me, Sterling. Christ! I know what
kind of a dream it's been--and so do you!"</p>

<p>Sterling did not deign to answer, but continued to look at him
with cold faint disdain, and after another baleful and disgusted
stare, Fried rasped out bitterly again:</p>

<p>"I suppose it was a dream your first term here when you tried
to suck around those English guys and you thought they were going
to take you right into the family, didn't you?" he sneered. "You
thought you were sittin' pretty, didn't you? You were goin' to
pal around with the Duke of What's-His-Name and get invited home
wit' him for the Christmas holidays and make a big play for his
sister, weren't you? Yes, you were!" He jeered, "You saw how far
it got you, didn't you? Those guys took you for a ride and played
you for a sucker, an' when they'd had all the fun wit' you they
could, they dropped you like a ton of bricks! You thought that
you were pretty wise, didn't you?" he snarled bitterly. "You
thought that you were goin' places, didn't you? You were goin' to
do something big, you were! Well, I'll tell you what you did! You
handed them a laugh--see? You handed those guys a great big
laugh--yes! a laugh!" he shouted violently. "And, I'll tell you
something else! They're still laughin' at you! I saw you,
Sterling. I know what you did. But you didn't see me, did you?
Couldn't see me in those days, could you?"</p>

<p>"I can't see you now," said Sterling coldly. "I never could
see you!"</p>

<p>"Is that so?" the Jew said bitterly. "Now, isn't that too bad!
. . . Well, I'll tell you one time that you saw me, Sterling. . .
. That's when those guys had left you flat. . . . You could see
me then, couldn't you? You don't remember, do you?" he jeered.
"Well, I'll tell you when it was. . . . It was when you came back
here that year for the spring term and you found they didn't know
you when you went around. It was when your tail was dragging the
ground and you didn't have a friend in the world--you could see
me then, all right. Couldn't you? . . . I wasn't good enough
before when you were trying to break into High Society--but I was
good enough to see after they gave you the big go-by, wasn't I? .
. . Sure! Sure!" he said with an air of derision, addressing
himself more quietly now to the rest of the group. "I usta go by
this guy when he was running around wit' his English friends--and
did he see me?" he jibed savagely. "Not so you could notice it! .
. . 'Who is that common person who just spoke to you, Mr.
Sterling?' 'O, <i>that!</i> O, I cannot say, old chap--some low
fellow that was on the boat wit' me when I came ovah! . . .
Really cawn't recall his name! A beastly boundah, I believe!' . .
. Sure! Sure!" he nodded. "That was it! High-hattin' me, you
know! I wasn't good enough! And all the time these English guys
were laughin' up their sleeve at him!"</p>

<p>They had been stunned by the snarling fury of his assault,
silenced by the hypnotic compulsion of his dark, hard face, his
feverish eyes, the rasping bitterness of his voice that at the
end grew strident, high, and gasping from his effort to release
in one explosive tirade the whole packed weight of misery,
disappointment, and defeat that sweltered poisonously in his
heart. Now, however, as he paused there, dark and hard and full
of bitterness, surveying them balefully with toxic eyes, silenced
by lack of breath rather than by lack of further curses, they
gathered themselves together and went for him in a mass.</p>

<p>In another moment the last vestige of restraint, gentlemanly
decorum, urbane and tolerant sophistication with which they had
clothed themselves had vanished, and they were yelping, snarling,
shouting, accusing and denying, inextricably mixed-up in one
general and inglorious dogfight; taunts, curses, insults, and
indictments filled the air, all of them were shouting at the same
time, and out of that roaring brawl all one could decipher were
the ragged barbs and ends of their abuse--a tumult of bitter and
strident voices characterized by such phrases as--"You never
belonged here in the first place!" "It's fellows like you who
give all the rest of us a bad name!" "Why the hell should the
rest of us have to suffer for it because you talk and act like an
East Side gangster?" "They think all Americans are a bunch of
roughnecks because they meet a few like you." "Ah, g'wan! youse
guys! You give me a pain. You all feel the same way as I do but
none of you has guts enough to say so!" "You're just sore because
these English boys never had anything to do with you--that's all
you're sore about!" "Yeah? They had a hell of a lot to do wit'
you, didn't they?--even if you did try to talk wit' an English
accent." "You're a damned liar! I never tried to talk with an
English accent!" "Sure you did! Everybody hoid you! You coulda
cut yoeh accent wit' a hatchet! You were tryin' to suck aroun'
that gang at Christ's the first year you were here!" "Who says I
was?" "I say so--that's who! You an' Tommy Woodson both--" "Don't
mix my name with Tommy Woodson, now! You're not going to include
me with that horse's neck!" "Oh, yeah? Since when did you staht
callin' him a horse's neck?" "I always called him one! He
<i>is</i> one!" "Sure he is--but you didn't think so, did you,
that first year that you was heah? You was pallin' around wit'
him an' wouldn't have anything to do wit' the rest of us! You
thought it was goin' to get you somewhere, didn't you? You saw
how quick he dropped you after he got in wit' those guys at
Christ's! He gave you the big go-by then, didn't he? That's when
you stahted callin' him a horse's neck!" "It's a lie! I didn't!"
"Sure you did!"</p>

<p>The snarling medley of bitter tongues rose, mounted; they
vented their weight of insult, misery, and reproach on one
another and at length subsided, checked by exhaustion rather than
by some more charitable cause. And as the tumult died away
Sterling, two spots of colour burning on his pallid face, goaded
completely from his former affectation of coldly elegant disdain,
could be heard saying to Fried in a high, excited, almost
hysterical tone:</p>

<p>"The kind of attack you make is simply stupid! It doesn't get
you anywhere! And it's so crude! So raucous! After all, there's
no reason why you've always got to be so raucous!"--the way he
said the word was "raw-kus," his thin hands were trembling, and
the two spots of colour burned fiercely in his thin pale face; in
this and the bitter way in which he said "raucous" there was
finally something pitiable and futile.</p>

<p>And at the end, when all their strident cries had died away,
the dark embittered visage of the Jew surveyed them wearily, and
held them in its sway again. For as if conceding now what was
most evident--that his savage, disappointed spirit had a hard
integrity, an unashamed conviction, an ugly, snarling but most
open courage which they lacked, they sat there, and looked at him
in silence, somehow conveying by that silence a sense of bitter
and unwilling respect for him, a final admission of agreement and
defeat.</p>

<p>And he, too, when he spoke now, spoke wearily, with a bitter
resignation, as if he realized the futility of his victory over
them, the futility of hurling further insults, oaths, and
accusations at people who knew the bitter truth of his complaint
as well as he.</p>

<p>"Nah!" he said quietly in a moment, with this same note of
bitter, weary resignation in his voice. "To hell wit' it! Wat t'
hell's the use of tryin' to pretend it isn't so? You guys all
know the way things are! You come over here and you think you're
sittin' pretty right on top of the world! You think these guys
are goin' to throw their ahms around your neck and kiss you,
because they love Americans so much! And what happens?" He
laughed bitterly. "Are you telling <i>me?</i> Christ! You can
stay here for three years and none of them will ever give a
tumble to you! You can eat your heart out for all they care, and
when you leave here you'll know no more about them than when you
came. And what does it getcha? What's it all about? Wat t' hell
do you get out of it that's so wonderful?"</p>

<p>"I thought," one of the first-year men suggested mildly, and a
trifle piously, as if he were quoting one of the articles of
faith, "that you were supposed to get out of it a better
understanding of the relations between the two great
English-speaking nations."</p>

<p>"The two great English-speaking nations!" Fried answered
harshly with a jeering laugh. "Jesus! That's a good one!
<i>What</i> two English-speaking nations do you mean?" he went on
belligerently. "England and what other country?" he demanded.
"You don't think <i>we</i> speak the same language as <i>they</i>
do, do you? Christ! The first year I was here they might have
been talkin' Siamese so far as I was concerned! It wasn't any
language that I'd evah hoid before. . . . Yeah, I know," he went
on wearily in a moment, "they fed me all that bunk, too, before I
came over. . . . English-speakin' nations! . . . Goin' back to
your old home! our old home! For Christ's sake!" he said
bitterly. "Christ! It never was a home to me! I'd have felt more
at home if they had sent me to Siberia! . . . Home! The rest of
you guys can make believe it's home if you want to! . . . I know
what you'll do," he muttered. "You'll stick it out and hate it
like the rest of them. . . . Then you'll go back home an'
high-hat everyone and tell them all how wonderful it was, and
what a fine time you had when you were here, and how you hated to
leave it! . . . Not for me! I'm goin' home where I can see
someone that I know some time who's not too good to talk to me. .
. and talk to someone who understands what I'm tryin' to say once
in a while . . . and pay my little nickel for the big ride in the
subway . . . and listen to the kids playin' in the street . . .
an' go to sleep wit' the old elevated bangin' in my ears! . . .
That's home!" he cried. "That's home enough for me."</p>

<p>"A hell of a home," said someone quietly.</p>

<p>"Don't I know it!" snarled the man. "But it's the only home I
got! It's better than no home at all!"</p>

<p>And for a moment he smoked darkly, bitterly, in silence.</p>

<p>"Nah! To hell wit' it!" he muttered. "To hell wit' it! I'll be
glad when it's all over! I'm sorry that I ever came!"</p>

<p>And he was silent then, and the others looked at him, and had
no more to say, and were silent.</p>

<p> </p>

<h1>LXXII</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>There were four in the Coulson family: the father, a man of
fifty years, the mother, somewhere in the middle forties, a son,
and a daughter, Edith, a girl of twenty-two who lived in the
house with her parents. Eugene never met the son: he had
completed his course at Oxford a year or two before, and had gone
down to London where he was now employed. During the time Eugene
lived there the son did not come home.</p>

<p>They were a ruined family. How that ruin had fallen on them,
what it was, Eugene never knew, for no one ever spoke to him
about them. But the sense of their disgrace, of a shameful
inexpiable dishonour, for which there was no pardon, from which
there could never be redemption, was overwhelming. In the most
astonishing way Eugene found out about it right away, and yet he
did not know what they had done, and no one ever spoke a word
against them.</p>

<p>Rather, the mention of their name brought silence, and in that
silence there was something merciless and final, something that
belonged to the temper of the country, and that was far more
terrible than any open word of scorn, contempt, or bitter
judgment could have been, more savage than a million strident,
whispering, or abusive tongues could be, because the silence was
unarguable, irrevocable, complete, as if a great door had been
shut against their lives for ever.</p>

<p>Everywhere Eugene went in town the people knew about them, and
said nothing--saying everything--when he spoke their names. He
found this final, closed, relentless silence everywhere--in
tobacco, wine, and tailor shops, in book stores, food stores,
haberdashery stores--wherever he bought anything and gave the
clerk the address to which it was to be delivered, they responded
instantly with this shut finality of silence, writing the name
down gravely, sometimes saying briefly, "Oh! Coulson's!" when he
gave them the address, but more often saying nothing.</p>

<p>But whether they spoke or simply wrote the name down without a
word, there was always this quality of instant recognition, this
obdurate, contemptuous finality of silence, as if a door had been
shut--a door that could never again be opened. Somehow Eugene
disliked them more for this silence than if they had spoken
evilly: there was in it something ugly, knowing, and triumphant
that was far more evil than any slyly whispering confidence of
slander, or any open vituperation of abuse, could be. It seemed
somehow to come from all the vile and uncountable small maggotry
of the earth, the cautious little hatreds of a million nameless
ciphers, each puny, pallid, trivial in himself, but formidable
because he added his tiny beetle's ball of dung to the
mountainous accumulation of ten million others of his breed.</p>

<p>It was uncanny how these clerk-like faces, grave and quiet,
that never spoke a word, or gave a sign, or altered their
expression by a jot, when Eugene gave them the address, could
suddenly be alive with something secret, foul, and sly, could be
more closed and secret than a door, and yet instantly reveal the
naked, shameful, and iniquitous filth that welled up from some
depthless source. He could not phrase it, give a name to it, or
even see a certain sign that it was there, any more than he could
put his hand upon a wisp of fading smoke, but he always knew when
it was there, and somehow when he saw it his heart went hard and
cold against the people who revealed it, and turned with warmth
and strong affection towards the Coulson family.</p>

<p>There was, finally, among these grave clerk-like faces, one
face that Eugene could never forget thereafter, a face that
seemed to resume into its sly suave surfaces all of the nameless
abomination of evil in the world, for which he had no name, for
which there was no handle he could grasp, no familiar places or
edges he could get his hands upon, which slid phantasmally,
oilily, and smokily away whenever he tried to get his hands upon
it. But it was to haunt his life for years in dreams of hatred,
madness, and despair that found no frontal wall for their attack,
no word for their vituperation, no door for the shoulder of his
hate--an evil world of phantoms, shapes, and whispers that was
yet as real as death, as ever-present as man's treachery, but
that slid away from him like smoke whenever he tried to meet, or
curse, or strangle it.</p>

<p>This face was the face of a man in a tailor shop, a fitter
there, and Eugene could have battered that foul face into a
bloody pulp, distilled the filthy refuse of that ugly life out of
the fat swelling neck and through the murderous grip of his
fingers if he could only have found a cause, a logic, and a
provocation for doing it. And yet he never saw the man but twice,
and briefly, and there had been nothing in his suave, sly,
careful speech to give offence.</p>

<p>Edith Coulson had sent Eugene to the tailor's shop: he needed
a suit and when he asked her where to go to have it made, she had
sent him to this place because her brother had his suits made
there and liked it. The fitter was a heavy shambling man in his
late thirties: he had receding hair, which he brushed back flat
in a thick pompadour; yellowish, somewhat bulging eyes; a coarse
heavy face, loose-featured, red, and sensual; a sloping meaty
jaw, and large discoloured buck-teeth which showed unpleasantly
in a mouth that was always half open. It was, in fact, the mouth
that gave his face its sensual, sly, and ugly look, for a loose
and vulgar smile seemed constantly to hover about its thick
coarse edges, to be deliberately, slyly restrained, but about to
burst at any moment into an open, evil, foully sensual laugh.
There was always about his mouth this ugly suggestion of a loose,
corrupt, and evilly jubilant mirth, and yet he never laughed or
smiled.</p>

<p>The man's speech had this same quality. It was suave and
courteous, but even in its most urbane assurances there was
something non-committal, sly, and jeering, something that slid
away from you, and was never to be grasped, a quality that was
faithless, tricky and unwholesome. When Eugene came for the final
fitting it was obvious that he had done as cheap and shoddy a job
as he could do; the suit was vilely botched and skimped,
sufficient cloth had not been put into it, and now it was too
late to remedy the defect.</p>

<p>Yet the fitter gravely pulled the vest down till it met the
trousers, tugged at the coat, and pulled the thing together where
it stayed until Eugene took a breath or moved a muscle, when it
would all come apart again, the collar bulging outward from the
shoulder, the skimpy coat and vest crawling backward from the
trousers, leaving a hiatus of shirt and belly that could not now
be remedied by any means.</p>

<p>Then, gravely he would pull the thing together again, and in
his suave, yet oily, sly, and non-committal phrases say:</p>

<p>"Um! Seems to fit you very well."</p>

<p>Eugene was choking with exasperation, and knew that he had
been done, because he had foolishly paid them half the bill
already, and now knew no way out of it except to lose what he had
paid and get nothing for it or take the thing and pay the
balance. He was caught in a trap, but even as he jerked at the
coat and vest speechlessly, seized his shirt and thrust the
gaping collar in the fitter's face, the man said smoothly:</p>

<p>"Um! Yes! The collar. Should think all that will be all right.
Still needs a little alteration." He made some chalk-marks on
Eugene. "Should think you'll find it fits you very well when the
tailor makes the alterations."</p>

<p>"When will the suit be ready?"</p>

<p>"Um. Should think you ought to have it by next Tuesday. Yes. I
think you'll find it ready by Tuesday."</p>

<p>The sly words slid away from the boy like oil: there was
nothing to pin him to or grasp him by, the yellowed eyes looked
casually away and would not look at Eugene, the sensual face was
suavely grave, the discoloured buck-teeth shone obscenely through
the coarse loose mouth, and the suggestion of the foul loose
smile was so pronounced now that it seemed that at any moment the
man would have to turn away with heavy trembling shoulders and
stifle the evil jeering laugh that was welling up in him. But he
remained suavely grave and non-committal to the end, and when
Eugene asked him if he should come again to try it on, he said,
in the same oily tone, never looking at him:</p>

<p>"Um. Shouldn't think that would be necessary. Could have it
delivered to you when it's ready. What is your address?"</p>

<p>"The Far End Farm--it's on the Ventnor Road."</p>

<p>"Oh! Coulson's!" He never altered his expression, but the
suggestion of the obscene smile was so pronounced that now it
seemed he would have to come out with it. Instead, he only
said:</p>

<p>"Um. Yes. Should think it could be delivered to you there on
Tuesday. If you'll just wait a moment I'll ask the tailor."</p>

<p>Gravely, suavely, he took the coat from Eugene and walked back
towards the tailor's room with the coat across his arm. In a
moment, the boy heard sly voices whispering, laughing slyly, then
the tailor saying:</p>

<p>"Where does he live?"</p>

<p>"Coulson's!" said the fitter chokingly, and now the foul
awaited laugh did come--high, wet, slimy, it came out of that
loose mouth, and choked and whispered wordlessly, and choked
again, and mingled then with the tailor's voice in sly, choking,
whispering intimacy, and then gasped faintly and was silent. When
the man came out again his coarse face was red and swollen with
foul secret merriment, his heavy shoulders trembled slightly, he
took out his handkerchief and wiped it once across his loose
half-opened mouth, and with that gesture wiped the slime of
laughter from his lips. Then he came toward Eugene, suave, grave,
and courteous, evilly composed, as he said smoothly:</p>

<p>"Should think we'll have that for you by next Tuesday,
sir."</p>

<p>"Can the tailor fix it so it's going to fit?"</p>

<p>"Um. Should think you'll find that everything's all right. You
ought to have it Tuesday afternoon."</p>

<p>He was not looking at Eugene: the yellowish bulging eyes were
staring casually, indefinitely, away, and his words again had
slid away from the boy like oil. He could not be touched,
approached, or handled: there was nothing to hold him by, he had
the impregnability of smoke or a ball of mercury.</p>

<p>As Eugene went out of the door the tailor began to speak to
someone in the shop, Eugene heard low words and whispered voices,
then, gasping, the word "Coulson's!" and the slimy, choking,
smothered laughter as the street-door closed behind him. He never
saw the man again. He never forget his face.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>That was a fine house: the people in it were exiled, lost, and
ruined people, and Eugene liked them all. Later, he never knew
why he felt so close to them or remembered them with such warmth
and strong affection.</p>

<p>He did not see the Coulsons often and rarely talked to them.
Yet he felt as familiar and friendly with them all as if he had
known them all his life. The house was wonderful as no other
house he had ever known, because they all seemed to be living in
it together with this strange speechless knowledge, warmth, and
familiarity, and yet each was as private, secret, and secure in
his own room as if he occupied the house alone.</p>

<p>Coulson himself Eugene saw least of all: they sometimes passed
each other going in or out the door, or in the hall; Coulson
would grunt "Morning," or "Good Day," in a curt blunt manner, and
go on, and yet he always left Eugene with a curious sense of
warmth and friendliness. He was a stocky well-set man with
iron-grey hair, bushy eyebrows, and a red weathered face which
wore the open colour of the country on it, but also had the hard
dull flush of the steady heavy drinker.</p>

<p>Eugene never saw him drunk, and yet he was never sober: he was
one of those men who have drunk themselves past any hope of
drunkenness, who are soaked through to the bone with alcohol,
saturated, tanned, weathered in it so completely that it could
never be distilled out of their blood again. Yet, even in this
terrible excess one felt a kind of grim control--the control of a
man who is enslaved by the very thing that he controls, the
control of the opium-eater who cannot leave his drug but measures
out his dose with a cold calculation, and finds the limit of his
capacity, and stops there, day by day.</p>

<p>But somehow this very sense of control, this blunt ruddy style
of the country gentleman which distinguished his speech, his
manner, and his dress, made the ruin of his life, the desperate
intemperance of drink that smouldered in him like a slow fire,
steadily, nakedly apparent. It was as if, having lost everything,
he still held grimly to the outer forms of a lost standard, a
ruined state, when the inner substance was destroyed.</p>

<p>And it was this way with all of them--with Mrs. Coulson and
the girl as well: their crisp, clipped friendly speech never
deviated into intimacy, and never hinted at any melting into
confidence and admission. Upon the woman's weathered face there
hovered, when she talked, the same faint set grin that Captain
Nicholl had, and her eyes were bright and hard, a little mad,
impenetrable, as were his. And the girl, although young and very
lovely, sometimes had this same look when she greeted anyone or
paused to talk. In that look there was nothing truculent, bitter,
or defiant: it was just the look of three people who had gone
down together, and who felt for one another neither bitterness
nor hate, but that strange companionship of a common disgrace,
from which love has vanished, but which is more secret, silent,
and impassively resigned to its fatal unity than love itself
could be.</p>

<p>And that hard bright look also said this plainly to the world:
"We ask for nothing from you now, we want nothing that you offer
us. What is ours is ours, what we are we are, you'll not intrude
nor come closer than we let you see!"</p>

<p>Coulson might have been a man who had been dishonoured and
destroyed by his women, and who took it stolidly, saying nothing,
and drank steadily from morning until night, and had nothing for
it now but drink and silence and acceptance. Yet Eugene never
knew for certain that this was so; it just seemed inescapable,
and was somehow legible not only in the slow smouldering fire
that burned out through his rugged weathered face, but also in
the hard bright armour of the women's eyes, the fixed set grin
around their lips when they were talking--a grin that was like
armour, too. And Morison, who had referred to Coulson, chuckling,
as a real "bottle-a-day-man," had added quietly, casually, in his
brief, indefinite but blurted-out suggestiveness of speech:</p>

<p>"I think the old girl's been a bit of a bitch in her day. . .
. Don't know, of course, but has the look, hasn't she?" In a
moment he said quietly, "Have you talked to the daughter
yet?"</p>

<p>"Once or twice. Not for long."</p>

<p>"Ran into a chap at Magdalen the other day who knows her," he
said casually. "He used to come out here to see her." He glanced
swiftly, slyly at Eugene, his face reddening a little with
laughter. "Pretty hot, I gather," he said quietly, smiling, and
looked away. It was night: the fire burned cheerfully in the
grate, the hot coals spurting in small gaseous flares from time
to time. The house was very quiet all around them. Outside they
could hear the stormy wind in the trees along the road. Morison
flicked his cigarette into the fire, poured out a drink of whisky
into a glass, saying as he did so: "I say, old chap, you don't
mind if I take a spot of this before I go to bed, do you?" Then
he shot some seltzer in the glass and drank. And Eugene sat
there, without a word, staring sullenly into the fire, dumbly
conscious of the flood of sick pain and horror which the casual
foulness of the man's suggestion had aroused, stubbornly trying
to deny now that he was thinking of the girl all the time.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>One night, as Eugene was corning home along the dark road that
went up past the playing field to the house, and that was
bordered on each side by grand trees whose branches seemed to
hold at night all the mysterious and demented cadences of storm,
he came upon her suddenly standing in the shadow of a tree. It
was one of the grand wild nights that seemed to come so often in
the autumn of that year: the air was full of a fine stinging
moisture, not quite rain, and above the stormy branches of the
trees he could see the sky, wild, broken, full of scudding clouds
through which at times the moon drove in and out with a kind of
haggard loneliness. By that faint, wild, and broken light, he
could see the small white oval of the girl's face--somehow even
more lovely now just because he could not see it plainly. And he
could see as well the rough gleaming bark of the tree against
which she leaned.</p>

<p>As he approached, he saw her thrust her hand into the pocket
of her overcoat, a match flared, and for a moment he saw Edith
plainly, the small flower of her face framed in the wavering
light as she lowered her head to light her cigarette.</p>

<p>The light went out, he saw the small respiring glow of her
cigarette before the white blur of her face, he passed her
swiftly, head bent, without speaking, his heart filled with the
sense of strangeness and wonder which the family had roused in
him.</p>

<p>Then he walked on up the road, muttering to himself. The house
was dark when he got there, but when he entered his sitting-room
the place was still warmly and softly luminous with the glow of
hot coals in the grate. He turned the lights on, shut the door
behind him, and hurled several lumps of coal upon the bedded
coals. In a moment the fire was blazing and crackling cheerfully,
and getting a kind of comfort and satisfaction from this
activity, he flung off his coat, went over to the sideboard,
poured out a stiff drink of Scotch from a bottle there, and
coming back to the fire, flung himself into a chair and began to
stare sullenly into the dancing flames.</p>

<p>How long he sat there in this stupor of sullen and nameless
fury he did not know, but he was sharply roused at length by
footsteps light and rapid on the gravel, shocked into a start of
surprise by a figure that appeared suddenly at one of the French
windows that opened directly from his sitting-room on to the
level sward of velvet lawn before the house.</p>

<p>He peered through the glass for a moment with an astonished
stare before he recognized the face of Edith Coulson. He opened
the doors at once, she came in quickly, smiling at his surprise
and at the glass which he was holding foolishly, half-raised, in
his hand.</p>

<p>He continued to look at her with an expression of gape-mouthed
astonishment and in a moment became conscious of her smiling
glance, the cool sweet assurance of her young voice.</p>

<p>"I say!" she was saying cheerfully, "what a lucky thing to
find you up! I came away without any key--I should have had to
wake the whole house up--so when I saw your light!" she concluded
briskly, "--what luck! I hope you don't mind."</p>

<p>"Why no-o, no," Eugene stammered foolishly, still staring
dumbly at her. "No--no-o--not at all," he blundered on. Then
suddenly coming to himself with a burst of galvanic energy, he
shut the windows, pushed another chair before the fire, and
said:</p>

<p>"Won't you sit down and have a drink before you go?"</p>

<p>"Thanks," she said crisply. "I will--yes. What a jolly fire
you have." As she talked she took off her coat and hat swiftly
and put them on a chair. Her face was flushed and rosy, beaded
with small particles of rain, and for a moment she stood before
the mirror arranging her hair, which had been tousled by the
wind.</p>

<p>The girl was slender, tall, and very lovely with the kind of
beauty they have when they are beautiful--a beauty so fresh,
fair, and delicate that it seems to be given to just a few of
them to compensate for all the grimly weathered ugliness of the
rest. Her voice was also lovely, sweet, and musical, and when she
talked all the notes of tenderness and love were in it. But she
had the same hard bright look in her eye that her mother had, the
faint set smile around her mouth: as they stood there talking she
was standing very close to him, and he could smell the fragrance
of her hair, and felt an intolerable desire to put his hand upon
hers and was almost certain she would not draw away. But the hard
bright look was in her eye, the faint set smile around her mouth,
and he did nothing.</p>

<p>"What'll you have?" Eugene said. "Whisky?"</p>

<p>"Yes, thank you," she said with the same sweet crisp assurance
with which she always spoke, "and a splash of soda." He struck a
match and held it for her while she lit the cigarette she was
holding in her hand, and in a moment returned to her with the
drink. Then she sat down, crossed her legs, and for a moment
puffed thoughtfully at her cigarette as she stared into the fire.
The storm wind moaned in the great trees along the road and near
the house, and suddenly a swirl of rain and wind struck the
windows with a rattling blast. The girl stirred a little in her
chair, restlessly, shivered.</p>

<p>"Listen!" she said. "What a night! Horrible weather we have
here, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I don't like the fog and rain so well. But
this--the way it is tonight--" he nodded toward the window--"I
like it."</p>

<p>She looked at him for a moment.</p>

<p>"Oh," she said non-committally. "You do." Then, as she sipped
her drink, she looked curiously about the room, her reflective
glance finally resting on his table, where there was a great
stack of the ledgers in which he wrote.</p>

<p>"I say," she cried again, "what are you doing with all those
big books there?"</p>

<p>"I write in them."</p>

<p>"Really?" she said, in a surprised tone. "I should think it'd
be an awful bother carrying them around when you travel?"</p>

<p>"It is. But it's the best way I've found of keeping what I do
together."</p>

<p>"Oh," she said, as before, and continued to stare curiously at
him with her fair, lovely young face, the curiously hard, bright,
and unrevealing glance of her eye. "I see. . . . But why do you
come to such a place as this to write?" she said presently. "Do
you like it here?"</p>

<p>"I do. As well as any place I've ever known."</p>

<p>"Oh! . . . I should think a writer would want a different kind
of place."</p>

<p>"What kind?"</p>

<p>"Oh--I don't know--Paris--London--some place like that, where
there are lots of life--people--fun--I should think you'd work
better in a place like that."</p>

<p>"I work better here."</p>

<p>"But don't you get awfully fed up sitting in here all day long
and writing in these enormous books?"</p>

<p>"I do, yes."</p>

<p>"I should think you would . . . I should think you'd want to
get away from it sometimes."</p>

<p>"Yes. I do want to--every day--almost all the time."</p>

<p>"Then why don't you?" she said crisply. "Why don't you go off
some week-end for a little spree? I should think it'd buck you up
no end."</p>

<p>"It would--yes. Where should I go?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Paris, I suppose. . . . Or London! London!" she cried.
"London is quite jolly if you know it."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I don't know it."</p>

<p>"But you've <i>been</i> to London," she said in a surprised
tone.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. I lived there for several months."</p>

<p>"Then you know London," she said impatiently. "Of course you
do."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I don't know it very well. I don't know many
people there--and after all, that's the thing that counts, isn't
it?"</p>

<p>She looked at Eugene curiously for a moment, with the faint
hard smile around the edges of her lovely mouth.</p>

<p>"--Should think that might be arranged," she said with a
quiet, an enigmatic humour. Then, more directly, she added: "That
shouldn't be difficult at all. Perhaps I could introduce you to
some people."</p>

<p>"That would be fine. Do you know many people there?"</p>

<p>"Not many," she said. "I go there--whenever I can." She got up
with a swift decisive movement, put her glass down on the
mantelpiece and cast her cigarette into the fire. Then she faced
Eugene, looking at him with a curiously bold, an almost defiant
directness, and she fixed him with this glance for a full moment
before she spoke.</p>

<p>"Good night," she said. "Thanks awfully for letting me in--and
for the drink."</p>

<p>"Good night," Eugene said, and she was gone before he could
say more, and he had closed the door behind her, and he could
hear her light swift footsteps going down the hall and up the
steps. And then there was nothing in the house but sleep and
silence, and storm and darkness in the world around him.</p>

<p>Mrs. Coulson came into Eugene's room just once or twice while
he was there. One morning she came in, spoke crisply and
cheerfully, and walked over to the window, looking out upon the
velvet lawn and at the dreary, impenetrable grey of foggy air.
Although the room was warm and there was a good fire burning in
the grate, she clasped her arms together as she looked, and
shivered a little.</p>

<p>"Wretched weather, isn't it?" she said in her crisp tones, her
gaunt weathered face and toothy mouth touched by the faint fixed
grin as she looked out with her bright hard stare. "Don't you
find it frightfully depressing? Most Americans do," she said,
getting a sharp disquieting sound into the word.</p>

<p>"Yes. I do, a little. We don't have this kind of weather very
often. But this is the time of year you get it here, isn't it? I
suppose you're used to it by now?"</p>

<p>"Used to it?" she said crisply, turning her gaze upon him.
"Not at all. I've known it all my life, but I'll never get used
to it. It is a wretched climate."</p>

<p>"Still, you wouldn't feel at home anywhere else, would you?
You wouldn't want to live outside of England?"</p>

<p>"No?" she said, staring at him with the faint set grin around
her toothy mouth. "Why do you think so?"</p>

<p>"Because your home is here."</p>

<p>"My home? My home is where they have fine days and where the
sun is always shining."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't like that. I'd get tired of sunlight all the time.
I'd want some grey days and some fog and snow."</p>

<p>"Yes, I suppose you would. But then, you've been used to
having fine days all your life, haven't you? With us, it's
different. I'm so fed up with fog and rain that I could do
without them nicely, thank you, if I never saw them again. . . .
I don't think you could ever understand how much the sunlight
means to us," she said slowly. She turned, and for a moment
looked out of the window. "Sunlight--warmth--fine days for ever!
Warmth everywhere--in the earth, the sky, in the lives of the
people all around you, nothing but warmth and sunlight and fine
days!"</p>

<p>"And where would you go to find all that? Does it exist?"</p>

<p>"Oh, of course!" she said crisply and good-naturedly, turning
to him again. "There's only one place to live--only one country
where I want to live."</p>

<p>"Where is that?"</p>

<p>"Italy," she said. "That's my real home. . . . I'd live the
rest of my life there if I could." For a moment longer she looked
out of the window, then turned briskly, saying:</p>

<p>"Why don't you run over to Paris some week-end? After all,
it's only seven hours from London: if you left here in the
morning you'd be there in time for dinner. It would be a good
change for you. I should think a little trip like that would buck
you up tremendously."</p>

<p>Her words gave him a wonderful feeling of confidence and hope:
she had travelled a great deal, and she had the casual, assured
way of speaking of a voyage that made it seem very easy and
filled one with a sense of joy and adventure when she spoke about
it. When Eugene tried to think of Paris by himself it had seemed
very far away and hard to reach: London stood between it and him,
and when he thought of the huge smoky web of London, the soft
grey skies above him, and the enormous weight of lives that were
hidden somewhere in that impenetrable fog, a grey desolation and
weariness of the spirit filled him. It seemed to him that he must
draw each breath of that soft grey air with heavy weary effort,
and that every mile of his journey would be a ghastly struggle
through some viscous and material substance, that weighted down
his steps and filled his heart with desolation.</p>

<p>But when Mrs. Coulson spoke to him about it, suddenly it all
seemed wonderfully easy and good. England was magically small,
the Channel to be taken in a stride, and all the thrill, the joy,
the mystery of Paris his again--the moment that he chose to make
it his.</p>

<p>He looked at her gaunt weathered face, the hard bright armour
of her eyes, and wondered how anything so clear, so sharp, so
crisp, and so incisive could have been shaped and grown
underneath these soft and humid skies that numbed him, mind and
heart and body, with their thick dull substance of grey weariness
and desolation.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>A day or two before he left, Edith came into his room one
afternoon bearing a tray with tea and jam and buttered bread. He
was sitting in his chair before the fire, and had his coat off:
when she came in he scrambled to his feet, reached for the coat
and started to put it on. In her young crisp voice she told him
not to, and put the tray down on the table, saying that the maid
was having her afternoon off.</p>

<p>Then for a moment she stood looking at him with her faint and
enigmatic smile.</p>

<p>"So you're leaving us?" she said presently.</p>

<p>"Yes. Tomorrow."</p>

<p>"And where will you go from here?" she said.</p>

<p>"To Germany, I think. Just for a short time--two or three
weeks."</p>

<p>"And after that?"</p>

<p>"I'm going home."</p>

<p>"Home?"</p>

<p>"Back to America."</p>

<p>"Oh," she said slowly. "I see." In a moment, she added, "We
shall miss you."</p>

<p>He wanted to talk to her more than he had ever wanted to talk
to anyone in his life, but when he spoke all that he could say,
lamely, muttering, was:</p>

<p>"I'll miss you, too."</p>

<p>"Will you?" She spoke so quietly that he could scarcely hear
her. "I wonder for how long?" she said.</p>

<p>"For ever," he said, flushing miserably at the sound of the
word, and yet not knowing any other word to say.</p>

<p>The faint hard smile about her mouth was a little deeper when
she spoke again.</p>

<p>"For ever? That's a long time, when one is young as you," she
said.</p>

<p>"I mean it. I'll never forget you as long as I live."</p>

<p>"We shall remember you," she said quietly. "And I hope you
think of us some time--back here, buried, lost, in all the fog
and rain and ruin of England. How good it must be to know that
you are young in a young country--where nothing that you did
yesterday matters very much. How wonderful it must be to know
that none of the failure of the past can pull you down--that
there will always be another day for you--a new beginning. I
wonder if you Americans will ever know how fortunate you are,"
the girl said.</p>

<p>"And yet you couldn't leave all this?" Eugene said with a kind
of desperate hope. "This old country you've lived in, known all
your life. A girl like you could never leave a place like this to
live the kind of life we have in America."</p>

<p><i>"Couldn't</i> I?" she said with a quiet but unmistakable
passion of conviction. "There's nothing I'd like better."</p>

<p>Eugene stared at her blindly, dumbly for a moment; suddenly
all that he wanted to say, and had not been able to say, found
release in a movement of his hands. He gripped her by the
shoulders and pulled her to him, and began to plead with her:</p>

<p>"Then why don't you? I'll take you there!--Look here--" his
words were crazy and he knew it, but as he spoke them he believed
all he said--"Look here! I haven't got much money--but in America
you can make it if you want to! I'm going back there. You come
too--I'll take you when I go!"</p>

<p>She had not tried to free herself; she just stood there
passive, unresisting, as he poured that frenzied proposal in her
ears. Now, with the same passive and unyielding movement, the
bright armour of her young eyes, she stepped away, and stood
looking at him silently for a moment. Then slowly, with an almost
imperceptible movement, she shook her head. "Oh, you'll forget
all about us," she said quietly. "You'll forget about our lives
here--buried in fog--and rain--and failure--and defeat."</p>

<p>"Failure and defeat won't last for ever."</p>

<p>"Sometimes they do," she said with a quiet finality that froze
his heart.</p>

<p>"Not for you--they won't!" Eugene said, and took her by the
hand again with desperate entreaty. "Listen to me--" he blundered
on incoherently, with the old feeling of nameless shame and
horror. "You don't need to tell me what it is--I don't want to
know--but whatever it is--for you, it doesn't matter--you can get
the best of it."</p>

<p>She said nothing, but just looked at him through that hard
bright armour of her eyes, the obdurate finality of her
smile.</p>

<p>"Good-bye," she said, "I'll not forget you either." She looked
at him for a moment curiously before she spoke again. "I wonder,"
she said slowly, "if you'll ever understand just what it was you
did for me by coming here?"</p>

<p>"What was it?"</p>

<p>"You opened a door that I thought had been closed for ever,"
she said, "a door that let me look in on a world I thought I
should never see again--a new bright world, a new life and a new
beginning--for us all. And I thought that was something which
would never happen to anyone in this house again."</p>

<p>"It will to you," Eugene said, and took her hand again with
desperate eagerness. "It can happen to you whenever you want it
to. It's yours, I'll swear it to you, if you'll only speak."</p>

<p>She looked at him, with an almost imperceptible movement of
her head.</p>

<p>"I tell you I know what I'm talking about."</p>

<p>Again she shook her head.</p>

<p>"You don't know," she said. "You're young. You're an American.
There are some things you'll never be old enough to know.--For
some of us there's no return.--Go back," she said, "go back to
the life you know--the life you understand--where there can
always be a new beginning--a new life."</p>

<p>"And you--" Eugene said dumbly, miserably.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, my dear," she said so low and gently he could
scarcely hear her. "Think of me sometimes, won't you?--I'll not
forget you." And before he could speak she kissed him once and
was gone, so light and swift that he did not know it, until the
door had closed behind her. And for some time, like a man in a
stupor, he stood there looking out of the window at the grey wet
light of England.</p>

<p>The next day he went away, and never saw any of them again,
but he could not forget them. Although he had never passed beyond
the armour of their hard bright eyes, or breached the wall of
their crisp, friendly, and impersonal speech, or found out
anything about them, he always thought of them with warmth, with
a deep and tender affection, as if he had always known them--as
if, somehow, he could have lived with them or made their lives
his own had he only said a word or turned the handle of a door--a
word he never knew, a door he never found.</p>

<p> </p>

<h1>LXXIV</h1>

<p> </p>

<p>The day before he went away, the Rhodes scholars invited
Eugene to lunch. That was a fine meal: they ate together in their
rooms in college, they had opened their purses to the college
chef, and had told him not to spare himself but to go the limit.
Before the meal they drank together a bottle of good sherry wine,
and as they ate they drank the college ale, strong, brown, and
mellow, and when they came to coffee, they all finished off on a
bottle of port apiece.</p>

<p>There was a fine thick seasonable soup, of the colour of
mahogany, and then a huge platter piled high with delicate
brown-golden portions of filet of sole, and a roast of mutton,
tender, fragrant, juicy and delicious as no other mutton that
Eugene had ever eaten, with red currant jelly, well-seasoned
sprouts, and boiled potatoes, to go with it, and at the end a
fine apple-tart, thick cream, sharp cheese, and crackers.</p>

<p>It was a fine meal, and when they finished with it they were
all happy and exultant. They were beautifully drunk and happy,
with that golden, warm, full-bodied and most lovely drunkenness
that can come only from good rich wine and mellow ale and
glorious and abundant food--a state that we recognize instantly
when it comes to us as one of the rare, the priceless, the
unarguable joys of living, something stronger than philosophy, a
treasure on which no price can be set, a sufficient reward for
all the anguish, weariness, and disappointment of living, and a
far better teacher than Aquinas ever was.</p>

<p>They were all young men and when they had finished they were
drunk, glorious, and triumphant as only young men can be. It
seemed to them now that they could do no wrong, or make no error,
and that the whole earth was a pageantry of delight which had
been shaped solely for their happiness, possession, and success.
The Rhodes scholars no longer felt the old fear, confusion,
loneliness, bitter inferiority and desolation of the soul which
they had felt since coming there.</p>

<p>The beauty, age, and grandeur of the life about them were
revealed as they had never been before, their own fortune in
living in such a place seemed impossibly good and happy, nothing
in this life around them now seemed strange or alien, and they
all felt that they were going to win, and make their own, a life
among the highest and most fortunate people on the earth.</p>

<p>As for Eugene, he now thought of his departure exultantly, and
with intolerable desire, not from some joy of release, but
because everything around him now seemed happy, glorious, and
beautiful, and a token of unspeakable joys that were to come, a
thousand images of trains, of the small rich-coloured joy and
comfort and precision of their trains, of England, lost in fog,
and swarming with its forty million lives, but suddenly not
dreary, but impossibly small, and beautiful and near, to be taken
at a stride, to be compassed at a bound, to enrich him, fill him,
be his for ever in all its joy and mystery and magic
smallness.</p>

<p>And he thought of the huge smoky web of London with this same
joy: of the suave potent ale he could get in one place there, of
its squares, and ancient courts, and age-grimed mysteries, and of
the fog-numb strangeness of ten million passing men and women. He
thought of the swift rich projectile of the channel train, the
quays, the Channel boats, and darkness, night, the sudden
onslaught of the savage choppy seas outside the harbour walls,
and England fading, and the flashing beacon lights of France, the
quays again, the little swarming figures, the excited tongues,
the strange dark faces of the Frenchmen, the always-alien, magic,
time-enchanted strangeness of the land, the people, and the
faces; and then Paris, the nostalgic, subtle and incomparably
exciting fabric of its life, its flavour, and its smell, the
strange opiate of its time, the rediscovery of its food, its
drink, the white, carnal, and luxurious bodies of the ladies of
easy virtue.</p>

<p>They were all exultant, wild, full of joy and hope and
invincible belief as they thought of all these things and all the
glory and the mystery that the world held treasured for their
taking in the depths of its illimitable resources; and they
shouted, sang, shook hands and roared with laughter, and had no
doubts, or fears, or dark confusions, as they had done in other,
younger, and more certain times.</p>

<p>Then they started out across the fields behind the colleges,
and the fields were wet and green, the trees smoky-grey and
blurred in magic veils of bluish mist, and the worn path felt,
looked, and seemed incredibly familiar, like a field they had
crossed, a path they had trod, a million times. And at length
they came to their little creek-wise river, their full, flowing
little river of dark time and treasured history, their quiet,
narrow, deeply flowing little river, uncanny in the small
perfection of its size, as it went past soundlessly among the wet
fresh green of the fields that hemmed it with a sweet, kept
neatness of perfection.</p>

<p>Then, having crossed, they went up along the river path until
they came to where the crews were waiting--the Merton crew
before, another college crew behind, and the students of both
colleges clustered eagerly on the path beside their boats,
exhorting their comrades in the shell, waiting for the signal
that would start the race.</p>

<p>Then, even as the Rhodes scholars pounded on Eugene's back and
roared at him with an exuberant affection that "You've got to run
with us! You've got to root for us! You belong to Merton now!"
the starting-gun cracked out, the crews bent furiously to their
work, the long blades bit frantically the cold grey water, and
the race was on. And they were racing lightly, nimbly now, two
packs of young men running on the path, each yelping cries of
sharp encouragement to his crew as he ran on beside it.</p>

<p>At first, as Eugene ran, he felt strong and lithe and eager.
He was aware of an aerial buoyancy: his step was light, his
stride was long and easy, his breath came softly, without labour,
and the swift feet of the running boys thudded before, behind,
around him, on the hard path, pleasantly, and he was secure in
his strength and certitude again, and thought that he was one of
them and could run with them to the end of the world and back and
never feel it.</p>

<p>He thought he had recovered all the lean sinew and endurance
of a boy, that the storm-swift flight, the speed, the hard
condition, and resilient effort of a boy were his again, that he
had never lost them, that they had never changed. Then a leaden
heaviness began to steal along his limbs, he felt the weariness
of effort for the first time, a thickening slowness in the
muscles of his legs, a numb weight-like heaviness tingling at his
finger-tips, and now he no longer looked so sharply and so
smartly at the swinging crew below him, the nimbly running boys
around him.</p>

<p>He began to pound ahead with dogged and deliberate effort, and
his heart was pounding like a hammer at his ribs, his breath was
labouring hoarsely in his throat and his tongue felt numb and
thick and swollen in his mouth, and blind motes were swimming
drunkenly before his eyes. He could hear his voice, unfamiliar
and detached, weirdly unreal, as if someone else were speaking in
him, as it panted hoarsely:</p>

<p>"Come on, Merton! . . . Come on, Merton! . . . Come on,
Merton!"</p>

<p>And now the nimbler running footsteps all around him had
passed, had gone ahead of him, had vanished. He could no longer
see the crews nor know if they were there. He ran on blindly,
desperately, hearing, seeing, saying nothing any longer, an
anguished leaden creature, weighted down with a million leaden
hours and weary efforts, pounding heavily, blindly, mindlessly
along, beneath grey timeless skies of an immortal weariness,
across the grey barren earth of some huge planetary
vacancy--where there was neither shade nor stay nor shelter,
where there would never be a resting-place, a room, nor any door
which he could enter, and where he must pound blindly, wearily
along, alone, through that huge vacancy for ever.</p>

<p>Then voices swarmed around him once again and he could feel
strong hands on him. They seized him, stopped him, and familiar
faces swarmed forward at him through those swimming motes of
blind grey vacancy. He could hear again the hoarse
ghost-unreality of his own voice panting: "Come on, Merton!" and
see his friends again, now grinning, laughing, shouting, as they
shook him. "Stop! The race is over! Merton won!"</p>

<h1>LXXV</h1>

<p> </p>

<p>Their names were Octave Feuillet, Alfred Capus, and Maurice
Donnay; their names were Hermant, Courteline, and Ren&eacute;
Bazin; their names were Jules Renard, Marcelle Tinayre, and
Andr&eacute; Theuriet; and Clar&eacute;tie, and Frapi&eacute; and
Tristan Bernard; and de R&eacute;gnier and Paul Reboux, and
Lavedan; their names were Rosny, Gyp, Boylesve, and Richepin;
their names were Bordeaux, Pr&eacute;vost, Margueritte, and
Duvernois--their names, Great God! their names were countless as
the sands upon the shore--and in the end, their names were only
names and names and names--and nothing more.</p>

<p>Or, if their names were something more than names--if they
sometimes shaped themselves in his mind as personalities--these
personalities were faded, graceful, and phantasmal ones--each
talented and secure in his position and curiously alike--each
brave and good and gentle in his trade, like lesser-known knights
of the Round Table. He knew that few of them had been the hero of
a generation, the leader of a century; he knew that none of them
had rivalled Balzac, surpassed Stendhal, outdone Flaubert. And
for this reason, their vague, phantasmal company became more
haunting-strange to him than if they had.</p>

<p>He knew, as well, that there must be among them great
differences of talent, great differences of style. His reason
told him that some were good, and some were fair, and some were
only cheap; even his meagre understanding of their tongue showed
him that there was a great range, every kind of difference in
their choice and treatment of a subject--a range that swept from
the gracefully ironic sentiment of <i>Les Vacances d'un Jeune
Homme Sage</i> to the stern earth-and-peasant austerity of <i>Le
Bl&eacute;</i> <i>qui l&egrave;ve;</i> from the dream nostalgia
of <i>Le Pass&eacute;</i> <i>Vivant</i> to the salty and
difficult drolleries of <i>Messieurs les Ronds-de-Cuir</i> or
<i>Le Train de 8 heures 47</i>.</p>

<p>He knew that each of these men must have had his own style,
his special quality which would instantly be discerned and
appraised by a French reader; he knew that some had written of
the quiet life of the provinces, and that others wrote of the
intrigue, the love affairs, the worldly and sophisticated gentry
of Paris; he knew that some were writers of a graceful sentiment,
some delicately ironic, some drolly comic, some savagely satiric,
and some grimly tragic.</p>

<p>But all of them seemed to come from the same place, to have
the same quality, to evoke the same perfume. They were the vague
and shadowy figures of a charming, beautiful, and legendary kind
of life--a life that was all the more legendary to him because he
was constantly groping with half-meanings, filling in his faulty
understanding of the language with painful intuitions, tearing
desperately at the contents of unnumbered volumes, with a
tortured hunger of frustration, an aching brain, a dictionary in
one hand and one of these slick and flimsy little volumes in
another.</p>

<p>And for this reason, perhaps, as much as any other--because of
this savage struggle with an alien tongue, this agonizing,
half-intuitive effort by which he groped his way to understanding
through a book--the books themselves, and these graceful and
shadowy figures who produced them, took on a quality that was as
strange as the whole experience of these first weeks in Paris had
become. Indeed, in later years, the legendary quality of his
savage conflict with this world of print became indistinguishably
mixed with the legendary quality of the life around him. Perhaps,
even the swift, graceful, and fascinating little drawings and
illustrations which dotted the pages of these books were in some
measure responsible for this illusion: the pictures gave to the
hard and difficult pages of a thousand fictions the illusion of
an actual reality: in these little pictures he could see and
recognize a thousand things that had already grown familiar to
him--the narrow sidewalks and the tall and ancient houses of the
Latin Quarter, the bridges of the Seine, the interior of a
railway compartment, the great grilled gate of a ch&acirc;teau,
people sitting at the tables in a caf&eacute; or on the terrace,
the walls, the roofs, the chimney-pots of Paris which, no matter
what changes had come about in human costume, feminine fashions,
top-hats, frock-coats, or facial whiskerage had themselves
changed very little.</p>

<p>The most extraordinary and vividly imagined phenomenon of his
desperate struggle to understand these innumerable fictions was
this: Although his reason told him that all these men--all these
phantasmal and haunting names--Feuillet, Capus, Donnay, Tinayre,
Boylesve, Bazin, Theuriet--and all the rest of them--must have
known all the sweat and anguish of hard labour, the solicitude,
the grinding effort, and the desperate patience, that every
artist knows, he became obsessed, haunted with the idea that the
works of all this graceful, strange, and fortunate company were
written without effort, with the most superb casualness and ease.
It was his strange delusion that all of them were not only of an
equal talent--could do all kinds of writing equally well and with
equal ease--but that the reason for this marvellous endowment lay
somehow in the fact that they were "French"--that by the
fortunate accident of race and birth each one had somehow been
constituted an artist who could do all things gracefully and
well, and could do nothing wrong. Favoured at birth by the great
inheritance of their language, blood, and temperament, they grew
up as children of a beautiful, strange, and legendary
civilization whose very tongue was a guarantee of style, whose
very tradition an assurance of form. These men could write
nothing badly because it was not within the blood and nature of
their race to do so: they must do everything gracefully, easily,
and with an impeccable sense of form, because grace and ease and
form were innate to them.</p>

<p>Finally, the, most extraordinary fact of this curious
obsession was his belief that all these books had been written by
their authors not in the stern and lonely solitude of some
midnight room, but swiftly, casually, and easily, as one might
write a letter at the table of a caf&eacute;.</p>

<p>The obsession was so strong that he could see them writing at
such a place--Feuillet, Capus, Donnay, Bazin--all the rest of
them, each seated in the afternoon at his own inviolable table in
his favourite caf&eacute;, each with a writing pad, a pen and ink
before him, a half-emptied bock or glass of wine beside him, an
adoring and devoted old waiter hovering anxiously near him--each
writing steadily, rapidly, and gracefully the pages of some new
and faultless story, some graceful, perfect book, filling up page
after page of manuscript in their elegant, fine handwriting,
without erasures or deletions, pausing thoughtfully from time to
time to stare dreamily away, stroking their lank, disordered
hair, their elegant French whiskers with a thin white hand, and
so far from being distracted by the gaiety, the noise and clatter
of the caf&eacute; crowd around them, deriving a renewed vitality
from its sparkling stimulation, and returning to fill up page
after page again.</p>

<p>And he could see them meeting every afternoon--that band of
Bohemian immortality, that fortunate and favoured company of art
that could do no wrong--in some caf&eacute; on the Boulevards, or
in some quiet, gracious old place hallowed by their patronage, in
the Latin Quarter, in Montparnasse, or on the Boulevard St.
Michel or in Montmartre.</p>

<p>He saw the whole scene with a blazing imagery, an exact
detail, as if he had himself been present and seen and heard it
all. He could hear the spirited light clamour of their
conversation--like everything they did, gracious, faultless, full
of ease--could see them rise to greet their famous
comrades--whoever they might be--Feuillet, Capus, or Donnay, all
the rest of them--could see them shake hands with the swift, firm
greeting, so graceful, worldly, and so French, and hear them
saying:</p>

<p>"Ah, my dear Maurice--how goes it with you? But--I see that I
disturb you--pardon, my friend!--I see that you are busy with
another of your admirable tales--Ah-h, my old one, not for the
world would I disturb the flow of your so admirable genius.
Parbleu! Do I wish my wretched name to become infamous to all
posterity, to be heard with execration--ah, the devil! Non! The
black forgetfulness of the grave is better! Eh, well, then, old
comrade, till tomorrow--<i>Then</i> I hope--"</p>

<p>"Ah, but no, but no, but no, but no, but no! My dear Octave,
you shall remain! These pages here!--Pouf! it is nothing! I am
already done--Attend!" Swiftly he scrawls a line or two, and then
triumphantly: "Voil&agrave;! C'est fini, old cock! A trifle I was
finishing for my scoundrel of a publisher, who demands it for
tomorrow.--But, tell me, my dear boy--what the devil kept you in
the provinces for so long a time--so long away from this dear
Pa-ree? Ah, how we have missed you: my dear fellow; Paris really
never is the same unless you are here to give it grace! Tiens!
Tiens! Poor Courteline has been quite inconsolable! Capus has
sworn daily he would go and fetch you back! Tinayre is grouchy as
a bear! My dear fellow, we have all lamented you! De
R&eacute;gnier was certain you had got another mistress! Boylesve
insisted that she was at least a duchess--Bazin, a
milkmaid--"</p>

<p>"And you, my old one?"</p>

<p>"I? My dear fellow--I knew it must be chicken-pox or measles:
I was certain you would not have to stir a foot out of Pa-ree to
find a wench."</p>

<p>"But tell me, Octave, how are all our friends? I am starved
for news, I have read nothing. First of all--Ren&eacute;--?"</p>

<p>"Has published another admirable work--an excellent study of
life in the provinces."</p>

<p>"Ah, good. And Duvernois?"</p>

<p>"His latest comedy has been produced and is un succ&egrave;s
fou--a charming thing--witty, naughty, quiet in his best vein, my
dear boy."</p>

<p>"Renard?"</p>

<p>"A comedy, a book of stories, a romance--all excellent, all
doing well."</p>

<p>"And Courteline?"</p>

<p>"Une chose incomparable, my boy: a book of dialogues in his
drollest vein--the public is convulsed: the police are in a
towering rage about <i>Le Gendarme est sans
Piti&eacute;</i>--"</p>

<p>"And Abel?"</p>

<p>"A formidable book, my lad--just what you would expect, a
powerful tragedy, exact psychology, brilliant--but here he comes,
all smiles--ah-h! I thought so! He sees you--My dear Abel,
welcome: behold, our prodigal has come home again--"</p>

<p>Yes, it was so that it was done, without anguish, error, or
maddening of the soul.</p>

<p>And far, far away from all this certain grace, this ease of
form, this assured attaining of expression--there lay
America--and all the dumb hunger of its hundred million tongues,
its unfound form, its unborn art. Far, far away from this
enchanted legend of a city--there lay America and the brutal
stupefaction of its million streets, its unquiet heart, its vast
incertitude, the huge sprawled welter of its life--its formless
and illimitable distances.</p>

<p>And Great God! Great God! but it was farther, stranger than a
dream--he noted its cruelty, savagery, horror, error, loss and
waste of life, its murderous criminality, and its hypocritic mask
of virtue, its lies, its horrible falseness, and its murderous
closure of a telling tongue--and Great God! Great God! with every
pulse and fibre in him, with the huge, sick ache of an
intolerable homelessness, he was longing with every beating of
his anguished heart for just one thing--<i>return!</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Day by day, hour by hour, and minute by minute, the blind
hunger tore at his naked entrails with a vulture's beak. He
prowled the streets of Paris like a maddened animal, he hurled
himself at the protean complexities of its million-footed life
like a soldier who hurls himself into a battle: he was baffled,
sick with despair, wrung, trembling and depleted, finally
exhausted, caught in the toils of that insatiate desire, that
terrible devouring hunger that grew constantly from what it fed
upon and that drove him blindly to madness. The hopeless and
unprofitable struggle of the Faustian life had never been so
horribly evident as it now was--the futility of his insane
efforts to memorize every stone and paving brick in Paris, to
burn the vision of his eyes through walls and straight into the
lives and hearts of a million people, to read all the books, eat
all the food, drink all the wine, to hold the whole gigantic
panorama of the universe within his memory, and somehow to make
"one small globe of all his being," to compact the accumulated
experience of eternity into the little prism of his flesh, the
small tenement of his brain, and somehow to use it all for one
final, perfect, all-inclusive work--his life's purpose, his
heart's last pulse and anguish, and his soul's desire.</p>

<p>As a result of all this anguished and frustrated struggle he
began now to go about with a small notebook in his pocket, the
worn stub of a chewed pencil in his hands.</p>

<p>And because everything went into this mad
<i>m&eacute;lange,</i> because by every one of these scrawls of
notes and sometimes incoherent words--even by the thousands of
crude drawings, swift designs which he scrawled down in a
thousand towns and places, to get the texture of a wall, the
design of a door, the shape of a table, even the sword-cut on a
man's scarred face--because in all of these shells and splinters
that were thrown off from his tormented and uneasy brain the
terrible Faustian fever of his tortured spirit was evident--no
better image of his life--the life of a young man of that
period--of modern man caught in the Faustian serpent-toils of
modern life--can be given than the splintered jottings in these
battered little books afford.</p>

<p>Here, then, picked out at random from the ferment of ten
thousand pages and a million words--put down just as they were
written, in fragments, jots, or splintered flashes, without order
or coherence--here, with all its vanity, faith, despair, joy, and
anguish, with all its falseness, error and pretension, and with
all its desperate sincerity, its incredible hope, its insane
desire, is a picture of a man's soul and heart--the image of his
infuriate desire--caught hot and instant, drawn flaming from the
forge of his soul's agony.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>Monday, November</i> 17, 1924: Worked over 5 hours up to
present (9.40) Cigarettes and coffee--Very tired.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>Tuesday:</i> Worked 4 hours yesterday. Very tired today
only an hour--more tonight--</p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>Wednesday:</i> Good week's work last week--Four or five
hours' <i>actual</i> writing every day--I may succeed ultimately
because I'm not content with what I do.</p>

<p>I was born in 1900--I am now 24 years old. During that period
I think the best writing in English has been done by James Joyce
in "Ulysses"--I think the best writing in the ballad has been
done by G. K. Chesterton in "Lepanto." The best writing in
sustained narrative verse by John Masefield--particularly in "The
Dauber," "The River" and "The Widow in The Bye Street." Who
produce copiously--Arnold Bennett--The best practitioners of the
Essay--Belloc--the most gigantically thorough realist--Theodore
Dreiser--The most sparing selection and unfailingly
competent--Galsworthy--The best play for Poetry--"The Playboy of
Western World"--The best journalist--Sinclair Lewis.</p>

<p>The critic with the greatest subtlety--T. S. Eliot--The critic
with the greatest range and power--H. L. Mencken--The best woman
writer--May Sinclair--The next best--Virginia Woolf--The next
best--Willa Cather.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>Wednesday Night--November</i> 26, 1924: At midnight eating
at Chez Marianne--First day I have not worked for two weeks but
am going home to work after eating. Up at 12.30 today after last
night felt sick--walked to bank--found no mail--wrote and sent
letters to Mama and to University. Talked to young fellow in bank
about Switzerland--had lunch at Taverne Royale--Took taxi to
Place des Vosges--Went to Victor Hugo Museum--Walked around
Square--then back to Carnavalet--at National Archives--The narrow
streets, the narrow sidewalks, the great buses, taxis, autos,
bicycles, trucks and the catty people jabbering and squalling got
me in a stew--Looked over distressing tons of books at a
bookshop, and went on feeling crushed--Bought two books--Then got
taxi Rue du Temple and so home through the jam of Rue de
Rivoli--Women outside pawing cheap articles at Samaritaine. Then
home to hotel where bathed went out to Deux Magots two aperitifs
then to Apollo Revue!--Not as bad as some--one or two good
songs--but of course, on whole quite stupid.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>Thursday--November</i> 27, 1924: At one, after working till
five this morning. Dining at Drouant's--very rich, red restaurant
filled with business men talking of les Anglais, les
Am&eacute;ricains, et cinq cent mille francs--at Drouant's--a
cold consomm&eacute;, a rumpsteak grille--avec des pommes
souffl&eacute;es--a fond d'artichaut Mornay (a cheese and cream
dressing and the ends of artichokes--delicious) a coffee and a
half bottle of Nuit St. Georges couvert 4 fr. total 44 fr.</p>

<p>At one table three Frenchmen of 50 or more--one of 40--one
with black beard--coal-black, neatly trimmed, naked around
jaws--another a heavy distinguished man--grey beard
pompadoured--grey close-cropped moustache--high-coloured--nervous
grey eyes shot with red--hands white, taut and tapping
constantly, while the face smiles--talks politely--another a red
gnarled satanic face--fierce with rich foods and
wines--smooth-shaven--and the youngest--black hair, a black
moustache--a quiet smiling, well-fleshed type. He had rich
colour--red shot with richness, the satanic yet not unpleasant
cast of face--the cropped brown moustache and such pompadoured
brownish hair--a Gallic type.</p>

<p>LATER: Seated at the caf&eacute; in front of Magasin du Louvre
and Palais Royal--Heard a high even monotone that tickles the ear
like a dynamo--It made me think of a great locomotive in the
yards at Altamont--steam shut off (perhaps) and the high small
ear-tickling dynamic noise they make.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday--December</i> 2, 1924:</p>

<p>MOCK LITERARY ANECDOTES:</p>
</center>

<p>Young mannered voice of Harvard johnny: "Oh! Simply
<i>priceless!</i> Don't you <i>l-o-o-ve</i> that?</p>

<p>. . . <i>Marvellous!"</i> etc.--telling what Oscar said to
Whistler, and what Whistler answered him.</p>

<p>A certain kind of mind collects these--pale, feeble, rootless,
arty, hopeless, lost--Joel Pierce tells them, too. First time I
heard them at Harvard what sophisticated raconteurs I thought
them!--God, how green I was! "You will, Oscar, you will," and all
the rest of it!--Today, sitting on terrace at Taverne Royale, I
made some of my own. Here they are:</p>

<p>One day as Whistler was standing before a window in St.
James's Street observing some prints of Battersea Bridge, he was
accosted by Oscar Wilde coming in the opposite direction. "You
will, James, you will," said Wilde with generous
impulsiveness.</p>

<p>"Gad," remarked the inimitable James, imperturbably adjusting
his monocle, "I wish I had said that!"</p>

<p>One day in June, Anatole France went to Rodin's studio for
luncheon. The talk having turned to early Greek primitives, Rodin
remarked:</p>

<p>"Some writers have a great deal to say and an atrocious style.
But you, dear Master, have a delicious style."</p>

<p>"And you, Master?" queried France ironically, allowing his
eyes to rest upon the torso of The Thinker, "since when did you
become a critic?"</p>

<p>In the burst of laughter that followed the thrust, Rodin had
to admit himself floored for once.</p>

<p>A young actor who had, it must be confessed, more ambition
than talent, one day rushed excitedly up to Sir Henry Irving
during the rehearsal of "Hamlet":</p>

<p>"It seems to me, sir," he burst out without preliminaries,
"that some actors ruin their parts by overplaying them."</p>

<p>"And some," remarked Sir Henry, after an awful pause,
"don't."</p>

<p>One day Sir James Barrie discovered Bernard Shaw while he was
lunching at the Athen&aelig;um, staring somewhat disconsolately
at an unsavoury mess of vegetables that adorned his plate.</p>

<p>"I hear you are working on a new play," remarked Barrie,
whimsically eyeing the contents of the platter.</p>

<p>For once G. B. S. had no answer ready.</p>

<p>Why won't these do?</p>

<p>(Suggestion to Young American writing Book Reviews for <i>New
York Times</i> in classical, simple, god-like manner of Anatole
France.)</p>

<p>"The new book of Monsieur Henry Spriggins, which lies before
me on my desk, fills me with misgivings. The author is young and
intolerant of simple things. He is full of talent, but he is
proud, and has not a simple heart. What a pity!" (etc.)</p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>Wednesday--December</i> 3, 1924: Com&eacute;die Francaise
tonight "Les Plaideurs"--and "Ph&egrave;dre"--Respect for play
grew and for actors diminished and went on--The French applauded
loudly when Madame Weber ended a long declamation on a
screech.</p>

<p>LATER: To R&eacute;gence and Harry's--Bought some books along
the quays--Saw Mrs. Martin at hotel today--Story of how she had
been robbed--The picture galleries and antique shops of Rue des
Saints-P&egrave;res.</p>

<p>Feathery snow--The feather-quilted snow.</p>

<p>Freckled eyes.</p>

<p>Wild Ceres through the wheat.</p>

<p>The slow dance of dancers.</p>

<p>The gull swerves seaward like hope--September full of
departing leaves and wings.</p>

<p>He sat alone four thousand miles from home--the lonely death
of seas at dawn.</p>

<p>The decent and untainted eyes that look on spattered
death--Myself dreaming of old battles--For a child the spear goes
clearly through--The musical horns beg and the battles press--The
phantasy of bloody death: The cloven brain-pan--the one lost

sorry for the lions--Savoir is right in this.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>Monday--December</i> 15, 1924: I am getting a new sense of
control--millions of books don't annoy me so much--went along the

<p>The Faustian hell again!</p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>At la R&eacute;gence: Semaine de No&euml;l,</i> 1924:</p>

<p>The people who say they "read nothing but the best" are not,
as some people call them, snobs. They are fools. The battle of
the Spirit is not to read and to know the best--it is to find
it--The thing that has caused me so much toil and trouble has
come from a deep-rooted mistrust in me of all cultured authority.
I hunger for the treasure that I fancy lies buried in a million
forgotten books, and yet my reason tells me that the treasure
that lies buried there is so small that it is not worth the pain
of disinterment.</p>

<p>And yet nearly everything in the world of books that has
touched my life most deeply has come from authority. I have not
always agreed with authority that all the books called great
<i>are</i> great, but nearly all the books that have seemed great
to me have come from among this number.</p>

<p>I have not discovered for myself any obscure writer who is as
great a novelist as Dostoievsky, nor any obscure poet with the
genius of Samuel Taylor Coleridge.</p>

<p>But I have mentioned Coleridge, and although my use of his
name will not, I believe, cause any protest, it may cause
surprise. Why not Shelley, or Spenser, or Milton?--It is here
that my war with Authority--to which I owe everything--begins
again.</p>

<p>There are in the world of my spirit certain gigantic figures
who, although great as well in the world of authority, are yet
overshadowed, and in some places, loom as enormous
half-ghosts--hovering upon the cloudy borderland between
obscurity and living remembrance.</p>

<p>Such a man is Samuel Taylor Coleridge. To me, he is not one of
the great English poets. He is The Poet. To me he has not to make
obeisance at the throne of any other monarch--he is there by
Shakespeare and Milton and Spenser.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>At La R&eacute;gence:</i> Remembering the prostitute with
rotten teeth that I talked to last night on Rue Lafayette:</p>

<p>My dirt is not as dirty as your dirt. My cleanness is cleaner
than your cleanness.</p>

<p>If I have a hole in my sock that is cunning.</p>

<p>If you have a hole in your stocking love flies out of the
window. Why are we like this? Boredom is the bedfellow of all the
Latin peoples--the English, in spite of the phrase "bored
Englishman," are not bored.</p>

<p>The Germans are eager and noisy about everything they are told
they should be interested in.</p>

<p>The Americans are interested in everything for a week--a week
at a time--except Sensation: they are interested in that all the
time.</p>

<p>I have heard a great deal of the "smiling Latins," the "gay
Latins," etc. I have seen few indications that the Latins are
gay. They are noisy--they are really a sombre and passionate
people--the Italian face when silent is rather sullen.</p>

<p>In New York the opportunities for learning, and acquiring a
culture that shall not come out of the ruins, but belong to life,
are probably greater than anywhere else in the world.</p>

<p>This is because America is young and rich and comparatively
unencumbered by bad things.</p>

<p>Tradition, which saves what is good and great in Europe, also
saves what is poor, so that one wades through miles of junk to
come to a great thing.</p>

<p>In New York books are plentiful and easy to get. The music and
the theatre are the best in the world.</p>

<p>The great trouble with New York is that one feels
uncomfortable while enjoying these things--In the daytime a man
should be making money. The time to read is at night before one
goes to bed. The time to hear music or go to the theatre is also
at night. The time to look at a picture is on Sunday.</p>

<p>Another fault comes from our lack of independence. I am sure
some of the most knowing people in the world, about the arts, are
in America. I cannot read a magazine like <i>The Dial,</i> or
<i>The Nation</i> and <i>The New Republic</i> without getting
frightened. One man wrote a book called <i>Studies in Ten
Literatures</i>--which, of course, is foolish. We want to seem
knowing about all these things because we have not enough
confidence in ourselves.</p>

<p>We have had niggers for 300 years living all over the
place--but all we did about it was to write minstrel shows, and
'coon stories, until two or three years ago when the French
discovered for us how interesting they are. We let Paul Morand,
and the man who wrote <i>Batouala,</i> and Soupault do it for
us--Then we began to write stories about Harlem, etc.</p>

<p>Instead of whining that we have no traditions, or that we must
learn by keeping constantly in touch with European models, or by
keeping away from them, we should get busy telling some of the
stories about America that have never been told.</p>

<p>A book like <i>Main Street,</i> which made such a stir, is
like Main Street. It is like "I've seen all Europe" tourists, who
have spent two days in each country in a round-the-town bus.</p>

<p>In a magazine like <i>The American Mercury</i> the stones are
also too much of a pattern--they're all about how the "Deacon
Screwed the Methodist Minister's Wife," and how the "Town
Prostitute Was Put in Jail for Coming to Church on Sunday and
Mixing with the Good Folks."</p>

<p>When you hear people saying about <i>Babbitt</i>--that it is
not the whole story and that much more can be said--you agree
with them. Then they begin to talk about "the other side" and you
lose hope. You see they mean, by "other side," Dr. Crane and
Booth Tarkington.</p>

<p>So far from these being "the other side," there are a million
other sides. And so far from <i>Babbitt</i> being too strong, the
stories that may be written about America will make
<i>Babbitt</i> an innocent little child's book to be read at the
Christmas School entertainment along with <i>The Christmas
Carol</i> and "Excelsior." The man who suggests the strangeness
and variety of this life most is Sherwood Anderson. Or was. I
think he's got too fancy since he wrote <i>Winesburg,
Ohio.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p>A French writer who said there was no real variety in the life
of the French because they all had red wine on the table, sat at
little tables in caf&eacute;s to gossip, and had mistresses,
would be called a fool. Yet an American will criticize his
country for standardization on no better grounds--namely, that
most of them are Methodists or Baptists, Democrats or
Republicans, Rotarians or Kiwanians.</p>

<p><i>Babbitt</i> is a very interesting book. But I believe it
would be possible for a German writer with a talent similar to
Sinclair Lewis to write a book called <i>Schmidt</i> or
<i>Bauer</i> which would be just as sweeping a portrait.</p>

<p>Do you want to know what the gentleman looks like? He is much
easier to describe than <i>Babbitt.</i></p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>Tuesday--December</i> 23, 1924: The mystery explained!
Today, at American Library, found out what it is:</p>

<p>"Time--that dimension of the world which we express in terms
of before and after--the temporal sequence pervades mind and
matter alike."</p>

<p>Time the form of the internal sense, and space the form of the
external sense.</p>

<p>Theory of Relativity--the time-units of both time and space
are neither points nor moments--but moments in the history of a
point.</p>

<p>W. James--Within a definite limited interval of duration known
as the specious present there is the direct perception of the
temporal relations.</p>

<p>After an event has passed beyond the specious present it can
only enter into consciousness by reproductive memory.</p>

<p>James--"The Object of Memory is only an object imagined in the
past to which the emotion of belief adheres."</p>

<p>Temporal experience divided into three qualitatively distinct
intervals: the remembered past, the perceived specious present,
and the anticipated future--By means of the tripartite division
we are able to inject our present selves into the temporal stream
of our own experience.</p>

<p>By arrangement of temporal orders of past with temporal orders
of future--we can construct a temporal order of our specious
presents and their contents.</p>

<p>Thus time has its roots in experience and yet appears to be a
dimension in which experiences and their contents are to be
arranged.</p>

<p>Thus the stuff from which time is made is of the nature of
experienced data.</p>

<p>The Zenonian paradoxes: Achilles cannot catch up with the
almost here save by occupying an infinity of positions.</p>

<p>A flying arrow cannot remain where it is, nor be where it is
not.</p>

<p>These things do not deal with space or time but with the
properties of infinite assemblages and dense series
(Americana).</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Weber's at midnight: The waiters in Weber's standing in a
group in their black coats and white boiled shirts--</p>

<p>All around the great mirrors reflecting there--for a moment a
<i>strange</i> picture I thought of TIME!</p>

<p>The horrible monotony of the French--Weber's at midnight some
Frenchmen in evening dress--the heavy eyelids--the dangling
legs--the look of weary vitality--</p>

<p>Then in come some "Parisiennes"--God! God! All sizes and
shapes and all the same--Unfit for anything else in the world,
and not good for what they are--The texture of enamelled tinted
skin, the hard avaricious noses, the chic style of coats, hair,
eyebrows, etc.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The great myth that the Latins are romantic people. The Latins
have qualities and standards that we do not possess--Hence we
overvalue them.</p>

<p>There are many places in the world where life attains a
greater variety, interest or profundity than in Paris (viz., New
York, London, Vienna, Munich). Yet a great many Americans make
their homes in Paris because they are sure it is the centre of
the world's intellectual and cultural reputations.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>It is easier for a writer to secure a reputation in France
than in any other country. Many French writers have very
respectable reputations who would be laughed at in other
countries. For example, Henri Bordeaux--Some Americans who study
French literature think he is a distinguished writer. His name
has a solid, respectable sound to it. On the cover of all his
books is printed "Member of the French Academy." But you could
hardly find an intellectual in America who would say a kind word
for Harold Bell Wright. Yet Harold Bell Wright--poor as he may
be--is a better writer than Henri Bordeaux. If you don't believe
it, read them. Americans are very unfair about this.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The way things go: At 6.10 A.M. the street lights of Paris go
off. I sit at a little all-night caf&eacute; in Grand Boulevard
opposite Rue Faubourg de Montmartre and watch light widen across
the sky behind Montmartre. At first a wide strip of blue-grey--a
strip of violet light. You see the line of the two clear and
sharp. The paper trucks of Hachette, <i>Le Petit Parisien,</i>
etc., go by.</p>

<p>In the bar a rattling of leaden, holey coins--the five-, ten-
and twenty-five-centime pieces. Taxi-drivers drinking caf&eacute;
rhum, debating loudly in hoarse sanguinary voices. A prostitute,
the blonde all-night antiquity of the Quarter streets, drinking
rich hot chocolate, crunching crusty croissants at the bar. The
veteran of a million loves, well known and benevolently
misprized, hoarse with iniquity and wisdom. A pox upon you,
Marianne: You have made Monsieur le Pr&eacute;sident tr&egrave;s
triste; the third leg of the Foreign Legion wears a sling because
of you!</p>

<p>A swart-eyed fellow, oiled and amorous, sweetly licks with
nozzly tongue his prostitute's rouge-varnished face: with choking
secret laughter and with kissy, wetty talkie he cajoles her; she
answers in swart choked whisperings with her sudden shrill
prostitute's scream of merriment.</p>

<p>A morning rattle of cans and ashes on the pavements. With rich
jingle-jangle and hollow clitter-clatter a Paris milk wagon
passes. Suddenly, a screak of brakes: all over the world the
moaning screak of brakes, and racing, starting motors.</p>

<p>Across the street in faint grey-bluish light the news kiosk is
opening up.</p>

<p>"Est-ce que vous avez <i>Le New York 'Erald?"</i></p>

<p>"Non, monsieur. Ce n'est pas encore arriv&eacute;."</p>

<p>"Et <i>Le Tchicago Treebune?"</i></p>

<p>"&Ccedil;a pas plus, monsieur. C'est aussi en retard ce
matin."</p>

<p>"Merci. Alors: <i>Le Matin."</i></p>

<p>"Bien, monsieur."</p>

<p>Passage of leaden sous: the smell of ink-worn paper, dear to
morning throughout the world. A big Hachette truck swerves up, an
instant halt, the flat heavy smack of fresh-corded ink-warm paper
on the pavement, a hoarse cry and instant loud departure!</p>

<p>&Ccedil;a aussi, monsieur. Sing ye bi-i-i-rds, sing! Light up
your heart, O son of man!</p>

<p>Sweet is the breath of morn, her rising sweet, with charm of
earliest birds!</p>

<p>Some things will never change: some things will always be the
same: brother we cannot die, we must be saved; we are united at
the heart of night and morning.</p>

<p>A good time now, just before dawn and morning. Surfeit of
sterile riches: harvests of stale bought love: the burnt-out
candle-end of night, the jaded blaze of crimson light, in
shattered bars; numb weary lust--which one? which one?</p>

<p>The prostitutes at daybreak, the dead brilliance of electric
smiles.</p>

<p>Tired, tired, tired.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>Tuesday:</i> Woman who sang tonight at Concert Mayol--She
was near 50--magnificent teeth--so good they made me
uneasy--Those things in her head--but how? They keep them so.
This comes to me--that they spend all their time looking after
them: there is something filthy about this.</p>

<p>On the Boulevards--3.20 du matin. Reading the <i>Sourire</i>
for strumpet-house items--I want to find me a Ballon of
Champagne--First of all--pr&eacute;servatif right to my left
around corner Rue Faubourg de Montmartre; all-night pharmacy.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Along the <i>quais</i> again this afternoon to the
bookstalls--Made afraid by the junk--Bought a dozen books or so,
but no "prints" or "etchings"--Countless old-fashioned
prints--pictures of Versailles--the Palais Royal, the
Revolution--Sentimental and cheap pictures--Florid ones--"La
Courtisane Passionn&eacute;e," etc. Stage-coach pictures, etc.
Works of Eug&egrave;ne Scribe--The little books bound or tied, so
you can't look--nothing in them--<i>Vie &agrave; la
Campagne</i>--countless cheap books--ah, I have a little of it
all!--Strasbourg.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>Christmas Week</i>--Colmar, Alsace-Lorraine--Written on the
Spot.</p>

<p>The <i>Isenheimer Altar of</i> Mathias Gr&uuml;newald in the
Cloisters of the Unterlinden Museum at Colmar:</p>

<p>There is nothing like it in the world. I have spent over 4
months getting here--it is much more wonderful than one imagines
it will be. The altar is set up <i>not in one piece</i> but in
three sections in a big room with groined ceilings, a long
groined room like a Dominikaner Cloister.</p>

<p>The first two "volets" of the altar--Everything is distorted
and out of perspective. The figure of the Christ is twice as big
as the other figures--the pointing finger of Saint Antoine is
much too big for his body--but everything in this figure points
along the joints and elbows of that arm and ends in the pointing
finger.</p>

<p>The Lamb with its straight brisk feet, its dainty right
foreleg bent delicately about the Cross and red blood spouting
from its imperturbable heart into a goblet of rich gold, is a
masterpiece of symbolic emotion that strikes far beyond
intelligence.</p>

<p>The body of Christ, and its agony, are indescribable. The
hands and the feet are enlarged to meet the agony--the hands are
tendons of agony, the feet are not feet but lengths of twisted
tendons driven through by a bolt and ending in bent, broken,
bleeding toes. A supernatural light falls upon the immense
twisted length of the body (a grey-white-green) and yet
<i>completely solid light</i>--you can count the ribs, the
muscles (the head falling to the right), full of brutal agony--it
is crowned with long thorns and rusty blood--it droops over, it
is too big, Christ is dead.</p>

<p>The great figure of the woman in white comes up and breaks
backward at the middle and is caught in the red arms of the
pitiful Saint. The fingers of the Magdalen are bent in eloquent
supplication.</p>

<p>The blackness of hell's night behind--the unearthly greenish
supernatural light upon the figures--on Christ's dead, sinewed,
twisted, riven gigantic body and on the living flesh of the other
figures.</p>

<p>The sly face of the Virgin in the wing of the
Annunciation--the eyes slanting up under lowered lids in a sly
leer--the fat loose sensual mouth half open, with the tongue
visible--a look of sly bawdiness over all.</p>

<p>The enormous and demoniac intelligence that illuminates the
piece in Gr&uuml;newald's <i>Altar</i>--the angels playing
instruments in "La Vierge Glorifi&eacute;e par les Anges"--the
faces have a <i>sinister golden light</i>--an almost unholy glee.
You can hear <i>mad heavenly music.</i> This is not true with
Italians--syrup and sugar.</p>

<p>This is the greatest and also the most "modern" picture I have
ever seen.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>Christmas Week</i>--1924: Returning to Paris from
Strasbourg: The approach to Paris through the Valley of the
Marne--Winter--The very magnificent rainbow--the rocking
clacketing train.</p>

<p>The suburbs of Paris--Dark--The little double-deckers rattling
past loaded with people--The weary approaches to a great
city--Endless repetition--monotonous endlessness--The sadness of
seeing people pass you in a lighted train or subway. Why is
this?</p>

<p> </p>

<p>PARIS: There is nothing that I do not know about Paris--That
sounds like the foolishest boast but that is true--I am sitting
on the terrace of the Taverne Royale--Rue Royale--It is
winter--it is cold--but it is the same--to one hand the
Madeleine--to the other the Place de la Concorde--to the right
that of the Champs-Elys&eacute;es--the Arc--the Bois--the
fashionable quarters--the strumpet-houses of that district--the
rue--the Troc--the Tower--the Champs-de-Mars--the Montparnasse
section--the Latin Quarter--the bookshops--the caf&eacute;s--the
Ecole--the Institut--the St. Mich--the Ile--the Notre Dame--The
Old Houses--the Rue de Rivoli--the Tour St. Jacques--the
Carnavalet--the Hugo--Vosges--the Bastille--the Gare de Lyon--the
Gare de l'Est--du Nord--the Montmartre--the Butte--the
caf&eacute;s--houses--the Rue Lepic--the Port Clignancourt--the
La Villette--The Parc Monceau--the Bois--Great circle, unending
universe of life, huge legend of dark time!</p>

<p>But unannealed by water the gaunt days sloped into the grots
of time.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>Paris, Saturday Night:</i> Today has been a horrible one--I
was able to sleep only the most diseased and distressed sleep
(the worst sort of American-in-Europe sleep) last night after
leaving Mrs. Morton. I was sick with my loss (the loss of the
picture and several letters Helen sent me) and I got up sick and
with the <i>shakes</i> this morning--I came to the Abiga bar--I
went to the Am. Ex. Co.--I went to Wepler's in Montmartre--At
each place, as I knew they would, with mean and servile regret
cut by mocking, they were sorry, sorry, sorry.</p>

<p>The day was of the most horrible European sort--Something that
passes understanding--the wet heavy air, that deadens the soul,
puts a lump of indigestible lead in the solar plexus, depresses
and fatigues the flesh until one seems to lift himself leadenly
through the thick wet steaming air with a kind of terrible
fear--an excitement that is without hope, that awaits only the
news of some further grief, failure, humiliation, and torture.
There is a lassitude that enters the folds and lappings of the
brain, that makes one hope for better things and better work
tomorrow, but hope without belief or conviction.</p>

<p>The grey depression of the wet buildings--the horrible nervous
pettiness of the French, swarming, honking, tooting along the
narrow streets and the two-foot sidewalks, while the heavy buses
beetle past--</p>

<p> </p>

<p>A chapter called PARIS or So You're Going to "Paris"? (Perhaps
a piece for a magazine in This.)</p>

<p>The fear always of the corners--you are coming out into the
open, there will be waiting to thrust at you, the heavy grinding
buses, the irritation of the horns, etc.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>A chapter to be called "The Arithmetic of the Soul."</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The music deepened like a passion.</p>

<p>All of our hearts are fulfilled of you, all of our souls are
growing warm with you, all of our lives are beating out their
breath for you, and the strange feel of our pulses is playing
through our blood for you, immortal and unending living.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>Sunday</i>--Up at noon, bathed, etc. Lunch at
Casenave's--Went to Delacroix and Louvre--Something over-rich and
bloody about it.--Note how French love to paint blood
(Delacroix)--then along Seine bookstalls--found only junk--then
to Lipp's for beer and <i>cervelas</i>--then back to hotel where
worked from 6.30-10.30--Then out to eat at Taverne Royale--Walk
back through Vend&ocirc;me and Rue St. Honor&eacute;--Read a
little and worked from <i>one</i> to 3.00--6 hours today.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>Sunday Night:</i> I feel low--discouraged by the mass of
things again tonight. I must make some decisive action--the new
web of streets behind the dome has depressed me.</p>

<p>The mind grows weary with such a problem as mine, by
constantly retracing his steps, by constantly feeling around the
same cylinder from which there seems <i>at present</i> to be no
escape.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The European temper is one that has learned control--that is,
it has learned indifference--Each man writes his own book without
worrying very much about what the other has written--he reads
little or if he reads much, it is only a trifle--a spoonful of
the ocean of print that inundates everything--Picture Anatole
France--with a reputation for omniscience--picking daintily here
and there among the bookstalls of the Seine. To go by them
affects me with horror and weariness--as it does Paul
Val&eacute;ry--but I lack his power to resist. I must go by
there--and if I do again and again I cannot keep away from
them.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>More and more I am convinced that to be a great writer a man
must be something of an ass. I read of Tolstoi that he read no
newspapers, that he went away and lived among peasants for 7
years at a time, and that for six years he read nothing except
the novels of Dumas. Yet such a man could write great books. I
almost think it is because of this that he did.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Bernard Shaw, one of our prophets at the present time, is
worshipped past idolatry by many people who consider that he
knows everything or practically everything.</p>

<p>From what I have been able to discover of his reading from his
writing, I can be sure that he has read Shakespeare--not very
carefully, Ibsen very carefully, a book by Karl Marx, which made
a deep impression on him, the tracts of the Fabian Society, and
the writings of Mr. and Mrs. Sidney Webb.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>There is always the moment when we must begin to write. There
are always the hundreds, the thousands, of struggle, of getting
up, of pacing about, of sitting down, of laborious uneven
accomplishment. During the time of actual work, what else besides
ourselves can help us? Can we call to mind then the contents of
20,000 books? Can we depend on anything other than ourselves for
help?</p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>At La R&eacute;gence:</i></p>

<p>How certain trivial words and phrases haunt the brain--cannot
be forgotten--come back again even when years have passed. Today,
have been hearing old voices, old songs, fleeting forgotten words
of twenty years ago--my mother's--my father's--the voices of the
summer boarders on the porches--most of all, Dinwood Bland,
sitting in pleasant backyard of his house in Norfolk, a drink in
his hand, his blind eyes blindly fixed upon the flashing
sparkling waters of Hampton Roads, blindly on a white ship
passing--his thin, senile, evil, strangely attractive face
touched with bitterness, revulsion, and his weary disgust with
life as he said:</p>

<p>"My father was an educated loafer."</p>

<p>And now, all day long, "the sound of these words rings and
echoes in my mind until I can listen to nothing else." And
sitting here I feel like Coleridge when the rhyme for Youth and
Age came to him (10 Sept. 1823 Wed. morning 10 o'clock)--"An
Air," he says, "that whizzed <i>dia engkefalou"</i> (right across
the diameter of my brain) exactly like a Hummel Bee--etc.</p>

<p>So too, with me, all afternoon--and Dinwood Bland's haunting
phrase about his father has now become:</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>"My father was an educated loafer,<br>
 My mother was an alcoholic bum,<br>
 My sister's name was Nelly, she had a lovely belly,<br>
 Aside from that she was a lousy scum.</p>

<p>"My brother Pete, he went and joined the Navy,<br>
 My brother Hank, he went and caught the clap,<br>
 My little sister Anny, fell down and bruised her fanny--<br>
 Because we had an educated Pap,"--etc.</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>Obscure, ridiculous--but old words, old phrases, and forgotten
sayings--why do they come back to haunt our meaning?</p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>At La R&eacute;gence:</i></p>

<p>On quotations--The practice of nineteenth-century "good"
writers was to decorate their compositions with neat little
patterns of quotations. That practice still persists in a great
deal of the correct writing of the present--viz., the essays and
leading articles of <i>The Atlantic Monthly, The Spectator,
Harper's, The Century, The London Mercury,</i> etc.--The
quotation habit is generally a vicious one, often it has not even
so worthy a design as to borrow from stronger and greater people
an energy and clearness that we do not have, but rather serves as
a sort of diploma to certify culture--said culture consisting in
our ability to quote scraps from Lamb, Dickens, John Keats,
Browning, Doctor Johnson, and Matthew Arnold. The distortion this
works upon the original sinew of the mind is
incalculable--writing becomes a meeting of pseudo-courtliness
neatly designed to arrive before Lamb with a bow and to be handed
by Dickens to Lord Tennyson with a graceful flourish. The phrase
"apt quotation" is one of the most misleading phrases ever
invented. Most quotations, so far from being apt to any purpose,
are distinguished by all the ineptitude a politician displays
when, having spoken for twenty minutes on the Nicaraguan
question, he says: "That reminds me of a little story I heard the
other day. It seems there were two Irishmen whose names were Pat
and Mike"--then proceeds to a discussion of the Prohibition
issue, after his convulsed audience is somewhat recovered.</p>

<p>Europe and America are still too far apart--the "interminable"
day is far too long--six days are far too long--for the intense
impression--to compare and observe their essential
difference--</p>

<p><i>Results:</i> We must have them closer together--as the
English and the French--as Dover and Calais--things that matter
in our life cannot be recalled so easily. I have lived deeply,
intensely, vividly, on the whole unhappily, for six months. Some
people say that is all that matters. I do not think it is. But
things cannot be called up so easily.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>I am wondering in a vast <i>vague</i> about her. I love her, I
think of seeing her again with a sense of strangeness and wonder;
but I have no sort of idea what it will be like, or what has
happened. Why can we not remember the faces of those we love?
This is true: Their faces melt into a thousand shades and shapes
and images of faces the moment that we try to fix them in our
memory. It is only the face of a stranger we remember there.
Why?</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Never have the many-ness and the much-ness of things caused me
such trouble as in the past six months. But never have I had so
firm a conviction that our lives can live upon only a few things,
that we must find them, and begin to build our fences.</p>

<p>All creation is the building of a fence.</p>

<p>But deeper study always, sharper senses, profounder living;
<i>never</i> an end to curiosity!</p>

<p>The fruit of all this comes later. I must think. I must mix it
all with myself and with America. I have caught much of it on
paper. But infinitely the greater part is in the wash of my brain
and blood.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Shaw makes a fool of himself when he writes of Napoleon,
because he hates Napoleon and wants to make him ridiculous. But
Shaw makes a hero of himself when he writes of C&aelig;sar;
Shaw's C&aelig;sar is the best C&aelig;sar I know of. It beats
Shakespeare. It is as C&aelig;sar looks (Naples Museum), I am
sure. I am sure C&aelig;sar was like this.</p>

<p>But it is a mistake to suppose that Napoleon got his hair in
the soup.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>Dirge:</i> Why are we unhappy?--I have no need to envy this
man's fame--nor skill to cloak myself in that man's manner--I am
as naked now as sorrow--and all I ask is: Why are we so
unhappy?</p>

<p>Why are we unhappy?</p>

<p>In my father's country there are yet men with quiet eyes and
slow, fond, kindly faces.</p>

<h1>LXXVI</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>About four o'clock on the afternoon of New Year's Eve, 1924,
as Eugene was entering the Louvre, he met Starwick. Starwick was
elegantly dressed, as always, in casual, beautifully tailored,
brown tweed garments. He still carried a cane and twirled it
indolently as he came down the steps. He was the same old picture
of bored, languorous, almost feminine grace, but instead of a
shirt he was wearing a Russian blouse of soft blue wool which
snuggled around his neck in voluptuous folds and had a kind of
diamond-shaped design of crimson threads along the band.</p>

<p>For a moment, half-way down the grey stone steps, worn and
hollowed as ancient European steps are worn and hollowed by the
soft incessant eternity of feet, as the other people thronged
past him, he paused, his pleasant ruddy face and cleft chin
turned vaguely up towards those soft skies of time, already
fading swiftly with the early wintry light.</p>

<p>As always, Frank looked magnificent, and with his Russian
blouse, and the expression of inscrutable sorrow on his face,
more mysterious and romantic than ever. Even in this foreign
scene he seemed to take possession of his surroundings with a
lordly air. So far from looking like an alien, a foreigner, or a
common tourist, Frank seemed to belong to the scene more than
anybody there. It was as if something very frail and rare and
exquisite and weary of the world--Alfred de Musset or George
Moore, or the young Oscar, or Verlaine--had just come out of the
Louvre, and it all seemed to belong to him.</p>

<p>The enormous central court of the Louvre, the soaring wings of
that tremendous and graceful monument, the planned vistas of the
Tuileries before him, fading into the mist-hazed air and the soft
greying light--the whole tremendous scene, with all its space and
strength and hauntingly aerial grace--at once as strong as
ancient battlemented time, and as delicate and haunting as music
on a spinet--swept together in a harmonious movement of
spaciousness and majesty and graceful loveliness to form a
background for the glamorous personality of Francis Starwick.</p>

<p>Even as he stood there, the rare and solitary distinction of
his person was evident as it had never been before. People were
streaming out of the museum and down the steps past him--for
already it was the closing hour--and as they went by they all
looked common, shabby and drearily prosaic by comparison. A
middle-aged Frenchman of the middle-class, a chubby, ruddy figure
of a man, dressed in cloth of the hard, ugly ill-cut black that
this class of Frenchmen wear, came by quickly with his wife, his
daughter and his son. The man was driven along by the incessant,
hot sugar of that energy which drives the race and which, with
its unvaried repetition of oaths, ejaculations, denials,
affirmations, and exactitudes, lavished at every minute upon the
most trivial episodes of life, can become more drearily tedious
than the most banal monotone. Compared with Starwick, his figure
was thick, blunt, common in its clumsy shapelessness, and his
wife had the same common, swarthy, blunted look. An American came
down the steps with his wife: he was neatly dressed in the ugly
light-greyish clothes that so many Americans wear, his wife was
also neatly turned out with the tedious and metallic stylishness
of American apparel. They had the naked, inept and uneasy look of
tourists; everything about them seemed troubled and alien to the
scene, even to the breezy quality of the air and the soft thick
skies about them. When they had descended the steps they paused a
moment in a worried and undecided way, the man pulled at his
watch and peered at it with his meagre prognathous face, and then
said nasally:</p>

<p>"Well, we told them we'd be there at four-thirty. It's about
that now."</p>

<p>All of these people, young and old, French, American, or of
whatever nationality, looked dreary, dull and common, and
uneasily out of place when compared with Starwick.</p>

<p>After a moment's shock of stunned surprise, a drunken surge of
impossible joy, Eugene ran towards him shouting, "Frank!"</p>

<p>Starwick turned, with a startled look upon his face: in a
moment the two young men were shaking hands frantically, almost
hugging each other in their excitement, both blurting out at once
a torrent of words which neither heard. Finally, when they had
grown quieter, Eugene found himself saying:</p>

<p>"But where the hell have you been, Frank? I wrote you twice:
didn't you get any of my letters?--what happened to you?--where
were you?--did you go down to the South of France to stay with
Egan, as you said you would?"</p>

<p>"Ace," said Starwick--his voice had the same, strangely
mannered, unearthly quality it had always had, only it was more
mysterious and secretive than ever before--"Ace, I have been
there."</p>

<p>"But why?--" the other began, "why aren't you?--" He paused,
looking at Starwick with a startled glance. "What happened,
Frank?"</p>

<p>For, by his few quiet and non-committal words Starwick had
managed to convey perfectly the sense of sorrow and tragedy--of a
grief so great it could not be spoken, a hurt so deep it could
not be told. His whole personality was now pervaded mysteriously
by this air of quiet, speechless and incommunicable sorrow; he
looked at the other youth with the eyes of Lazarus returned from
the tomb, and that glance said more eloquently than any words
could ever do that he now knew and understood things which no
other mortal man could ever know or understand.</p>

<p>"I should prefer not to talk about it," he said very quietly,
and by these words Eugene understood that some tragic and
unutterable event had now irrevocably sundered Starwick from
Egan--though what that event might be, he saw it was not given
him to know.</p>

<p>Immediately, however, in his old, casual, and engaging
fashion, speaking between lips that barely moved, Starwick
said:</p>

<p>"Look! What are you doing now? Is there any place you have to
go?"</p>

<p>"No. I was just going in here. But I suppose it's too late
now, anyway."</p>

<p>At this moment, indeed, they could hear the bells ringing in
the museum, and the voices of the guards, crying impatiently:</p>

<p>"On ferme! On ferme, messieurs!"--and the people began to pour
out in streams.</p>

<p>"Ace," said Starwick, "they're closing now. Besides," he added
wearily, "I shouldn't think it would matter to you, anyway. . . .
God!" he cried suddenly, in a high, almost womanish accent of
passionate conviction, "what junk! What mountains and oceans of
junk! And so bad!" he cried passionately, in his strange,
unearthly tone. "So incredibly and impossibly bad. In that whole
place there are just three things worth seeing--but
<i>they!"</i>--his voice was high again with passionate
excitement--<i>"they</i> are <i>unspeakably</i> beautiful,
Eugene! God!" he cried, high and passionate again, "how
<i>beautiful</i> they are! How utterly, impossibly beautiful!"
Then with a resumption of his quiet, matter-of-fact tone he said,
"You must come here with me some time. I will show them to you. .
. . Look!" he said, in his casual tone again, "will you come to
the R&eacute;gence with me and have a drink?"</p>

<p>The whole earth seemed to come to life at once. Now that
Starwick was here, this unfamiliar world, in whose alien life he
had struggled like a drowning swimmer, became in a moment
wonderful and good. The feeling of numb, nameless terror,
rootless desolation, the intolerable sick anguish of
homelessness, insecurity, and homesickness, against which he had
fought since coming to Paris, and which he had been ashamed and
afraid to admit, was now instantly banished. Even the strange
dark faces of the French as they streamed past no longer seemed
strange, but friendly and familiar, and the moist and languorous
air, the soft thick greyness of the skies which had seemed to
press down on his naked sides, to permeate his houseless soul
like a palpable and viscous substance of numb terror and despair,
were now impregnated with all the vital energies of living, with
the intoxication of an unspeakable, nameless, infinitely strange
and various joy. As they walked across the vast court of the
Louvre towards the great arched gateway and all the brilliant
traffic of the streets, the enormous dynamic murmur of the
mysterious city came to him and stirred his entrails with the
sensual premonitions of unknown, glamorous and seductive
pleasure. Even the little taxis, boring past with wasp-like speed
across the great space of the Louvre and through the sounding
arches, now contributed to this sense of excitement, luxury and
joy. The shrill and irritating horns sounded constantly through
the humid air, and filled his heart with thoughts of New Year:
already the whole city seemed astir, alive now with the great
carnival of New Year's Eve.</p>

<p>At the R&eacute;gence they found a table on the terrace of the
old caf&eacute; where Napoleon had played dominoes, and among the
gay clatter of the crowd of waning afternoon they drank brandy,
talked passionately and with almost delirious happiness, drank
brandy again, and watched the swarming and beautiful life upon
the pavements and at the crowded tables all around them.</p>

<p>The streams of traffic up and down the whole Avenue de
l'Op&eacute;ra and the Place de la Com&eacute;die
Fran&ccedil;aise, the delicate, plain, and beautiful
fa&ccedil;ade of the Com&eacute;die across the Square from them,
the statue of frail De Musset, half-fainting backwards in the
arms of his restoring muse--all this seemed not only part of him,
but now that Starwick was here, to gain an enormous enhancement
and enchantment, to be the total perfume of an incredibly good
and lovely and seductive life, the whole of which, in all its
infinite ramifications, seemed to be distilled into his blood
like a rare liquor and to belong to him. And so they drank and
talked and drank until full dark had come, and tears stood in
their eyes, and the brandy saucers were racked up eight deep upon
their table.</p>

<p>Then, gloriously sad and happy and exultantly triumphant, and
full of nameless joys and evil, they stepped into one of the
shrill, exciting little taxis and were charioted swiftly up that
thronging noble street, until the great soaring masses of the
Op&eacute;ra stood before them and the Caf&eacute; de la Paix was
at one side.</p>

<p>And they were young, all-conquering and exultant, and all the
magic life of strange million-footed Paris belonged to them, and
all its strange and evil fragrance burned fierce and secret in
their veins, and they knew that they were young and that they
would never die, that it was New Year's Eve in Paris, and that
that magic city had been created for them. By this time they had
between them about 400 francs.</p>

<p>Then followed the huge kaleidoscope of night: at one o'clock,
leaving a caf&eacute;, they got into a taxi, and vociferously
demanded of the ruddy driver, in French made eloquently confident
by alcohol and joy, that they be taken to the resorts most
frequented by "nos fr&egrave;res--vous comprenez?--les
honn&ecirc;tes hommes--les ouvriers."</p>

<p>He smilingly assented, and from that time on until dawn they
made a madman's round of little vile caf&eacute;s, so mazed, so
numerous, so inextricably confused in the vast web-like slum and
jungle of nocturnal Paris, that later they could never thread
their way back through that labyrinth of crooked alley-ways, and
drunkenness and confusion. Their driver took them to a region
which they later thought was somewhere in that ancient, foul and
tangled quarter between the Boulevard de S&eacute;bastopol and
Les Halles. And all that night, from one o'clock to dawn, they
threaded noxious alleys, beside the shuttered fa&ccedil;ades of
ancient, evil, crone-like houses, and stopped at every blaze of
garish light to enter dirty little dives, where sullen
evil-visaged men surveyed them sullenly over bistro bars, and
gave them with a slimy hand cheap vile cognac in greasy little
glasses. In these places there was always the evil, swelling,
fatly unctuous and seductive music of accordions, the hoarse
bravos of applause. Here one bought metal slugs, a dozen for five
francs, and gave them to sluttish sirens with no upper teeth for
the favour of a dance; and here also there were many soldiers:
Colonial negroes, black as ebony, were most in favour; and here
were men with caps and scarves and evil, furtive eyes, who
watched them steadily.</p>

<p>From place to place, from dive to dive, all through that huge
and noxious labyrinth of night, their wild debauch wore on. And
presently they noticed that, wherever they went, two gendarmes
followed them, stood quietly at the bar, and courteously and
genially took the drinks they always bought for them, and were
always there when they entered the next place. And the ruddy and
good-natured taxi-man was always there as well, and he too always
drank with them, and always said, with robust satisfaction: "Mais
oui! Parbleu! A votre sant&eacute;, messieurs!"</p>

<p>The grey haggard light of daybreak showed the cold grey waters
of the Seine, ancient, narrowed, flowing on between huge stone
walls, the haggard steep fa&ccedil;ades of the old shuttered
houses in the Latin Quarter, the narrow angularity of the silent
streets. In Montparnasse they got out at the corner of the
Boulevard Edgar Quinet and demanded the reckoning. All that
remained to them was less than fifty francs; they took it all,
the soiled and nibbled little five-franc notes, the coppery one
and two-franc pieces, the ten- and twenty-five- and fifty-centime
pieces, and poured it into his hands, and stood there, guilty,
silent and ashamed, before his astonished and reproachful face,
because he had stood by them well and loyally all through that
blind kaleidoscope of night, and it was New Year's Eve, and they
were drunk and gay, and, he had thought, rich Americans, and he
had hired for, earned, expected, more.</p>

<p>"It's all we have," they said.</p>

<p>That ruddy robust man then did something that is perhaps rare
in the annals of French taxidom, and which they never forgot.</p>

<p>After an astonished moment, while he looked at the little wad
of bills and coins in his broad palm, he suddenly laughed loud
and cheerfully, tossed the little wad of money in the air and
caught it as it fell, stripped off a five-franc note and pocketed
the rest, handed the five-franc note to Starwick, and said
cheerfully--</p>

<p>"It's all right! You two boys take this and buy yourselves
some breakfast to sober up on. Happy New Year!"--and with a
friendly farewell wave of the hand, drove off.</p>

<p>They had delicious morning crescent rolls, fresh-baked and
crusty, and thick rich chocolate, at a little bakery in the
Boulevard Edgar Quinet, next to Starwick's quarters. He was
living in a studio, loaned to him, he said, by "two friends,"
whom he did not name, and who were "out of town for the
holidays."</p>

<p>The studio was one of a row of similar buildings all fronting
on a little enclosed alley-way. One entered from a street through
a gate set in the wall: one rang a bell, and presently la
concierge pressed a button which released the door. Inside, it
was very quiet and still and grey with the grey morning light of
New Year's Day. And all the city was shut out. Then they entered
Starwick's studio: in the grey light a big room with a slanting
roof of grey glazed glass emerged: around the walls were
paintings, the limbs and fragments of unfinished sculptures, a
few chairs and tables, and a couch bed. At the back there was a
balcony, and steps ascending to it: here too there was a cot, and
Starwick told Eugene he could sleep up there.</p>

<p>Both young men were groggy with weariness and the night's
debauch: in the cold grey light, life looked black and ugly; they
were exhausted and ashamed. Starwick lay down upon the couch and
went to sleep; Eugene ascended to the balcony, pulled off his
clothes and tossed them in a heap, and fell into the deep drugged
sleep of drunkenness and exhaustion.</p>

<p>He slept till noon; and was awakened by the sound of steps
below, the opening and closing of the door, and suddenly a
woman's voice, light, gay, authoritative, and incisive:</p>

<p>"Darling, we're back again!" the gay, light voice cried out.
"Welcome to our city! Happy New Year," she went on more quietly,
and with a note of tender intimacy. "How have you been?"</p>

<p>He heard Starwick's quiet voice as it answered her, and
presently the low, brief, and almost sullen tones of another
woman. Starwick called sleepily up to Eugene, telling him to
dress at once and come down: when he got downstairs, Starwick and
the two women were waiting for him.</p>

<p>The one with the light, gay, incisive voice greeted him warmly
and cordially, and made him feel instantly at home. She seemed to
be the older of the two, and yet there was not much difference in
their age. The other woman shook hands with him almost curtly,
and muttered a few words of greeting. She was a big dark-haired
New England sort of girl; she wore dark, drab, rusty-looking
clothes, and her face had a sullen, almost heavy cast to it.
While Starwick, and the other woman, whose name was Elinor,
rattled gaily on together, the dark girl sat sullenly and
awkwardly in her chair and said nothing. Once or twice they spoke
to her: she had a way of answering with a few curt sullen words
and a short angry laugh, which went as quickly as it came, and
left her face heavy and sullen again. But the moment she laughed,
Eugene noticed that her mouth was very red and sweet, her teeth
beautifully white, and for a moment the girl's sullen face was
illuminated by a radiant tender loveliness. He heard Frank call
her Ann: Starwick seemed to want to tease her, and when he spoke
to her there was a little burble of malicious laughter in his
voice. Turning to Eugene, his pleasant face reddening and the
burble of malicious laughter playing in his throat, Frank
said:</p>

<p>"She is <i>very</i> beautiful. You'd never think it, but she
really <i>is,</i> you know."</p>

<p>Ann muttered something short and angry, and her face flushing,
she laughed her short sudden laugh of anger and exasperation. And
as she did so, her face came alive at once with its radiant
loveliness, and he saw that what Starwick said of her was
true.</p>

<p> </p>

<h1>LXXVII</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>That was a fine life that he had that year. He lived in a
little hotel in the Rue des Beaux-Arts. He had a good room there
which cost him twelve francs a day. It was a good hotel, and was
the place where Oscar Wilde had died. When anyone wanted to see
the celebrated death-room, he would ask to see "la chambre de
Monsieur Veeld," and Monsieur Gely, the proprietor, or one of his
buxom daughters, would willingly show it.</p>

<p>At nine o'clock in the morning the maid would come in with
chocolate or coffee, bread and jam and butter, which was included
in the price of the room. She put it down on a little cabinet
beside his bed, which had a door and a chamber pot inside. After
she went out he would get up and move it to the table, and drink
the chocolate and eat some bread and jam. Then he would go back
to bed and sleep until noon and sometimes later: at one o'clock,
Starwick and the two women would come to take him to lunch. If
they did not come, they would send him a <i>pneumatique</i>
telling him where to meet them. They went to a great many
different places, but the lunch was always good. Sometimes they
would send a <i>pneumatique</i> telling him to meet them at the
Dome or the Rotonde. When he got there they would be sitting at a
table on the terrace, and already very gay. Starwick would have a
stack of saucers racked up before him on the table. On each
saucer would be a numeral which said 3.50, or 5.00, or 6.00, or
7.50 francs, depending on what he had been drinking.</p>

<p>Usually it was cognac, but sometimes Starwick would greet him
with a burble of laughter, saying in his sensuous and voluptuous
voice: "Did you ever drink Amer Picon?"</p>

<p>"No," he would say.</p>

<p>"Well," said Starwick. "You ought to try it. You really ought,
you know." And the soft burble would come welling up out of his
throat again, and Elinor, looking at him tenderly, smiling, would
say:</p>

<p>"Francis! You idiot! Leave the child alone!"</p>

<p>Then they would go to lunch. Sometimes they went to a place
near by called Henriettes which Elinor had known about when she
was an ambulance driver in the war. Again they would cross the
river and eat at Prunier's, Weber's, the Caf&eacute;
R&eacute;gence, Fouquet's, or at a place halfway up the hill in
Montmartre, which was in a square called the Place des Martyrs,
and which was called L'Ecrevisse, probably because of a little
shell-fish which they sold there, and which was a specialty. That
was a fine place: they always ate out on the terrace, where they
could see everything that was going on in the little square, and
Elinor, who had known the place for years, said how lovely it
would be in spring.</p>

<p>Often they would eat at little places, which were not very
expensive and which Elinor also knew about. She knew about
everything: there was nothing about Paris she did not know.
Elinor did the talking, rattling off her French like a
native--or, anyway, like a native of Boston who speaks French
well--trippingly off the tongue, getting the same intonations and
gestures the French got, when she argued with them, saying:</p>

<p>"Mais non--mais non mais non mais non mais non mais non!" so
rapidly that we could hardly follow her, and she could say: "Oui.
C'est &ccedil;a!--Mais parfaitement!--Entendu! . . . Formidable!"
etc., in the same way as a Frenchman could.</p>

<p>Yet there was a trace of gaiety and humour in everything she
said and did. She had "the light touch" about everything, and
understood just how it was with the French. Her attitude toward
them was very much the manner of a mature and sophisticated
person with a race of clamouring children. She never grew tired
of observing and pointing out their quaint and curious ways: if
the jolly proprietor of a restaurant came to the table and
proudly tried to speak to them his garbled English, she would
shake her head sharply, with a little smile, biting her lower lip
as she did so, and saying with a light and tender humour:</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>nice! . . .</i> He wants to speak his English! . . .
<i>Isn't</i> he a dear? . . . No, no," she would say quickly if
anyone attempted to answer him in French. "Please let him go
ahead--poor dear! He's so proud of it!"</p>

<p>And again she would shake her head, biting her lower lip, with
a tender, wondering little smile, as she said so, and "Yes!"
Francis would say enthusiastically and with a look of direct,
serious, and almost sorrowful earnestness. "And how <i>grand</i>
the man is about it--how <i>simple</i> and <i>grand</i> in the
way he does it! . . . Did you notice the way he used his hand?--I
mean like someone in a painting by Cimabue--it really is, you
know," he said earnestly. "The centuries of living and tradition
that have gone into a single gesture--and he's quite unconscious
of it. It's grand--I mean like someone in a painting by
Cimabue--it really is, you know," he said with the sad, serious
look of utter earnestness. "It's really <i>quite</i>
incredible."</p>

<p>"Quite," said Elinor, who with a whimsical little smile had
been looking at a waiter with sprouting moustaches, as he bent
with prayerful reverence, stirring the ingredients in a salad
bowl--"Oh, Francis, darling, look--" she whispered, nodding
toward the man. "Don't you <i>love</i> it? . . . Don't you simply
<i>adore</i> the way they do it? . . . I <i>mean,</i> you know!
Now where? Where?" she cried, with a gesture of complete
surrender--<i>"where</i> could you find anything like that in
America? . . . I mean, you simply couldn't find it--that's
all."</p>

<p><i>"Quite!"</i> said Francis concisely. And turning to Eugene,
he would say with that impressive air of absolute sad
earnestness, "And it's really <i>most</i> important. It really
is, you know. It's astonishing to see what they can put into a
single gesture. I mean--the Whole Thing's there. It really
is."</p>

<p>"Francis!" Elinor would say, looking at him with her gay and
tender little smile, and biting her lip as she did so--"You
<i>kid,</i> you! I <i>mean!</i>--"</p>

<p>Suddenly she put her hand strongly before her eyes, bent her
head, and was rigid in a moment of powerful and secret emotion.
In a moment, however, she would look up, wet-eyed, suddenly
thrust her arm across the table at Eugene, and putting her hand
on his arm with a slight gallant movement, say quietly:</p>

<p>"O, I'm sorry--you poor child! . . . After all, there's no
reason why you should have to go through all this. . . . I mean,
darling," she explained gently, "I have an adorable kid at home
just four years old--sometimes something happens to make me think
of him--you understand, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he said.</p>

<p>"Good," she said briskly and decisively, with a swift and
gallant smile, as she patted his arm again. "I knew you
would!"</p>

<p>She had left her husband and child in Boston, she had come
here to join Francis, fatality was in the air, but she was always
brave and gallant about it. As Francis would say to Eugene as
they sat drinking alone in a caf&eacute;:</p>

<p>"It's <i>mad</i>--Boston! . . . Perfectly <i>mad</i>--Boston!
. . . I mean, the kind of thing they do when they ride a horse up
the steps of the State House. . . . I mean, perfectly
<i>grand,</i> you know," he cried with high enthusiasm. "They
stop at nothing. It's simply <i>swell</i>--it really is, you
know."</p>

<p>Everyone was being very brave and gallant and stopping at
nothing, and the French were charming, charming, and Paris gave
them just the background that they needed. It was a fine
life.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Elinor took charge of everything. She took charge of the
money, the making of plans, the driving of bargains with
avaricious and shrewd-witted Frenchmen, and the ordering of food
in restaurants.</p>

<p>"It's really astonishing, you know," said Starwick--"the way
she walks in everywhere and has the whole place at her feet in
four minutes. . . . Really, Gene, you should have been with us
this afternoon when she made arrangements with the man at the
motor agency in the Champs-Elys&eacute;es for renting the car. .
. . Really, I felt quite sorry for him before the thing was over.
. . . He kept casting those knowing and rather <i>bitter</i>
glances of reproach at me," said Starwick, with his burble of
soft laughter, "as if he thought I had betrayed him by not coming
to his assistance. . . . There was something <i>very</i> cruel
about it . . . like a great cat playing with a mouse . . . there
really was, you know," said Starwick earnestly. "She can be
completely without pity when she gets that way," he added. "She
really can, you know . . . which makes it all the more
astonishing--I mean, when you consider what she really is--the
way she let me go to sleep on her shoulder the night we were
coming back from Rheims, and I was so horribly drunk and got so
disgustingly sick," he said with a simple, touching earnestness.
"I mean, the <i>compassion</i> of it--it was <i>quite</i> like
that Chinese goddess of the Infinite Compassion they have in
Boston--it <i>really</i> was, you know. It's quite astonishing,"
he said earnestly, "when you consider her background, the kind of
people that she came from--it really <i>is,</i> you know . . .
she's a grand person, simply terrific . . . it's utterly
<i>mad</i>--Boston . . . it really is."</p>

<p>Certainly it was very pleasant to be in the hands of such a
captain. Elinor got things done with a beautiful, serene
assurance that made everything seem easy. There was no difficulty
of custom or language, no weird mystery and complication of
traffic, trade, and commerce, so maddening and incomprehensible
to most Americans, that Elinor did not understand perfectly.
Sometimes she would just shake her head and bite her lip,
smiling. Sometimes she would laugh with rich astonishment, and
say: <i>"Perfectly</i> insane, of course--but then, that's the
way the poor dears are, and you can't change them. . . . I
<i>know!</i> I <i>know! . . .</i> It's quite incredible, but
they'll <i>always</i> be that way, and we've simply got to make
the best of it."</p>

<p>She was a heavily built woman about thirty years old who
seemed older than she was. She dressed very plainly and wore a
rather old hat with a cockade, which gave her a look of
eighteenth-century gallantry. And the impression of maturity was
increased by her heavy and unyouthful figure, and the strong
authority of her face which, in spite of her good-humoured, gay,
and whimsical smile, her light Bostonian air of raillery,
indicated the controlled tension and restraint of nerves of a
person of stubborn and resolute will who is resolved always to
act with aristocratic grace and courage.</p>

<p>In spite of her heavy figure, her rough and rather
unhealthy-looking skin, she was a distinguished-looking woman,
and in her smile, her tone, her play of wit, and even in the
swift spitefulness and violence which could flash out and strike
and be gone before its victim had a chance to retort or defend
himself, she was thoroughly feminine. And yet the woman made no
appeal at all to sensual desire: although she had left her
husband and child to follow Starwick to France, and was thought
by her own family to have become his mistress, it was impossible
to imagine her in such a r&ocirc;le. And for this reason,
perhaps, there was something ugly, dark, and sinister in their
relation, which Eugene felt strongly but could not define. He
felt that Elinor was lacking in the attraction or desire of the
sensual woman as Starwick seemed to be lacking in the lust of the
sensual man, and there was therefore something in their relation
that came from the dark, the murky swamp-fires of emotion,
something poisonous, perverse and evil, and full of death.</p>

<p>Just the same, it was fine to be with Elinor when she was gay
and deft and charming, and enormously assured, and taking charge
of things. At these times everything in life seemed simple,
smooth, and easy; there were no dreary complications, the whole
world became an enormous oyster ready to be opened, Paris an
enormous treasure-hoard of unceasing pleasure and delight. It was
good to be with her in a restaurant and to let her do the
ordering.</p>

<p>"Now, children," she would say in her crisp, gay, and yet
authoritative tone, staring at the menu with a little frowning
smile of studious yet whimsical concentration--"The rest of you
can order what you like, but Mother's going to start with fish
and a bottle of Vouvray--I seem to remember that it's very good
here--Le Vouvray est bon ici, n'est-ce pas?" she said turning to
the waiter.</p>

<p>"Mais oui, madame!" he said with just the right kind of
earnest enthusiasm, "c'est une sp&eacute;cialit&eacute;."</p>

<p>"Bon," she said crisply. "Alors, une bouteille du Vouvray pour
commencer--does that go for the rest of you, mes enfants?" she
said, looking around her. They nodded their agreement.</p>

<p>"Bon--bon, madame," the waiter said, nodding his vigorous
approval, as he put the order down. "Vous serez bien content avec
le Vouvray--et puis?"--He looked at her with suave respectful
inquiry. "Pour manger?"</p>

<p>"Pour moi," said Elinor, "le poisson--le filet de
sole--n'est-ce pas--Marguery?"</p>

<p>"Bon, bon," he said with enthusiastic approval, writing it
down. "Un filet de sole--Marguery--pour madame--et pour
monsieur?" he said turning suavely to Eugene.</p>

<p>"La m&ecirc;me chose," said that linguist recklessly and even
as the waiter was nodding enthusiastically, and saying:</p>

<p>"Bon. Bon--parfaitement! La m&ecirc;me chose pour monsieur,"
and writing it down, the others had begun to laugh at him.
Starwick with his bubbling laugh, Elinor with her gay little
smile of raillery and even Ann, the dark and sullen beauty of her
face suddenly luminous with a short and almost angry laugh as she
said:</p>

<p>"He hasn't said his other word yet--why don't you tell him
that you want some 'mawndiawnts'"--ironically she imitated his
pronunciation of the word.</p>

<p>"What's wrong with 'mendiants'?" he said, scowling at her.
"What's the joke?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," said Starwick, bubbling with laughter. "They're
very good. They really are, you know," he said earnestly. "Only
we've been wondering if you wouldn't learn another word some day
and order something else."</p>

<p>"I know lots of other words," he said angrily. "Only, how am I
ever going to get a chance to use them when the rest of you make
fun of me every time I open my mouth?--I don't see what the great
joke is," he said resentfully. "These French people understand
what I want to say," he said. "Ecoute, gar&ccedil;on," he said
appealingly to the attentive and smiling waiter.--"Vous pouvez
comprendre--"</p>

<p>"Cawmprawndre," said Ann mockingly.</p>

<p>"Vous pouvez comprendre--ce-que-je-veux-dire," he blundered on
painfully.</p>

<p>"Mais oui, monsieur!" the waiter cried with a beautiful
reassuring smile. "Parfaitement. Vous parlez tr&egrave;s bien.
Vous &ecirc;tes ici &agrave; Paris depuis longtemps?"</p>

<p>"Depuis six semaines," he said proudly.</p>

<p>The waiter lifted arms and eyebrows eloquent with astounded
disbelief.</p>

<p>"Mais c'est merveilleux!" the waiter cried, and as the others
jeered Eugene said with bitter sarcasm:</p>

<p>"Everyone can't be a fine old French scholar the way you are;
after all, I'm not travelled like the rest of you--I've never had
your opportunities. And even after six weeks here there are still
a few words in the French language that I don't know. . . . But
I'm going to speak the ones I do know," he said defiantly, "and
no one's going to stop me."</p>

<p>"Of course you are, darling!" Elinor said quickly and
smoothly, putting her hand out on his arm with a swift movement.
"Don't let them tease you! . . . I think it's mean of you," she
said reproachfully. "Let the poor dear speak his French if he
wants to--I think it's sweet."</p>

<p>He looked at her with a flushed and angry face while Starwick
bubbled with laughter, tried to think of something to say in
reply, but, as always, she was too quick for him, and before he
could think of something apt and telling, she had flashed off as
light and quick as a rapier blade:</p>

<p>"--Now, children," she was studying the card again--"what
shall it be after the fish--who wants meat--?"--</p>

<p>"No fish for me," said Ann, looking sullenly at the menu.
"I'll take--" suddenly her dark, sullen, and nobly beautiful face
was transfigured by her short and almost angry laugh again--"I'll
take an 'awmlet,'" she said sarcastically, looking at Eugene.</p>

<p>"Well, take your 'awmlet,'" he muttered. "Only I don't say it
that way."</p>

<p>"Pas de poisson," she said quietly to the waiter. "I want an
omelette."</p>

<p>"Bon, bon," he nodded vigorously and wrote. "Une omelette pour
madame. Et puis apr&egrave;s--?" he said inquiringly.</p>

<p>"Rien," she said.</p>

<p>He looked slightly surprised and hurt, but in a moment,
turning to Eugene, said:</p>

<p>"Et pour monsieur?--Apr&egrave;s le poisson?"</p>

<p>"Donnez-moi un Chateaubriand garni," he said.</p>

<p>And again Ann, whose head had been turned sullenly down
towards the card, looked up suddenly and laughed, with that short
and almost angry laugh that seemed to illuminate with
accumulating but instant radiance all of the dark and noble
beauty of her face.</p>

<p>"God!" she said. "I knew it!--If it's not mendiants, it's
Chateaubriand garni."</p>

<p>"Don't forget the Nuits St. Georges," said Starwick with his
bubbling laugh, "that's still to come."</p>

<p>"When he gets through," she said, "there won't be a steak or
raisin left in France."</p>

<p>And she looked at Eugene for a moment, her face of noble and
tender beauty transfigured by its radiant smile. But almost
immediately, she dropped her head again in its customary
expression that was heavy and almost sullen, and that suggested
something dumb, furious, and silent locked up in her, for which
she could find no release.</p>

<p>He looked at her for a moment with scowling, half-resentful
eyes, and all of a sudden, flesh, blood, and brain, and heart,
and spirit, his life went numb with love for her.</p>

<p>"And now, my children," Elinor was saying gaily, as she looked
at the menu--"what kind of salad is it going--"she looked up
swiftly and caught Starwick's eye, and instantly their gaze
turned upon their two companions. The young woman was still
staring down with her sullen, dark, and dumbly silent look, and
the boy was devouring her with a look from which the world was
lost, and which had no place in it for time or memory.</p>

<p>Dark Helen in my heart for ever burning.</p>

<p>"L'&eacute;crevisse," Eugene said, staring at the menu. "What
does that mean, Elinor?"</p>

<p>"Well, darling, I'll tell you," she said with a grave light
gaiety of tone. "An &eacute;crevisse is a kind of crayfish they
have over here--a delicious little crab--but <i>much, much</i>
better than anything we have."</p>

<p>"Then the name of the place really means <i>The Crab?"</i> he
asked.</p>

<p><i>"Stop</i> him!" she shrieked faintly. "You barbarian, you!"
she went on with mild reproach. "It's not at <i>all</i> the
same."</p>

<p>"It's really not, you know," said Starwick, turning to him
seriously. "The whole quality of the thing is different. It
really is. . . . Isn't it astonishing," he went on with an air of
quiet frankness, "the genius they have for names? I mean, even in
the simplest words they manage to get the whole spirit of the
race. I mean, this square here, even," he gestured briefly, "La
Place des Martyrs. The whole thing's there. It's really quite
incredible, when you think of it," he said somewhat mysteriously.
"It really is."</p>

<p>"Quite!" said Elinor. "And, oh, my children, if it were only
spring and I could take you down the Seine to an adorable place
called La P&ecirc;che Miraculeuse."</p>

<p>"What does that mean, Elinor?" Eugene asked again.</p>

<p>"Well, darling," she said with an air of patient resignation,
"if you <i>must</i> have a translation I suppose you'd call it
<i>The Miraculous Catch</i>--a fishing catch, you know. Only it
<i>doesn't</i> mean that. It would be sacrilege to call it that.
It means <i>La P&ecirc;che Miraculeuse</i> and nothing else--it's
<i>quite</i> untranslatable--it really is."</p>

<p><i>"Yes,"</i> cried Starwick enthusiastically, "and even their
simplest names--their names of streets and towns and places:
L'Etoile, for example--how grand and simple that is!" he said
quietly, "and how perfect--the whole design and spatial grandeur
of the thing is in it," he concluded earnestly. "It really is,
you know."</p>

<p>"Oh, absolutely!" Elinor agreed. "You couldn't call it <i>The
Star,</i> you know. That means nothing. But <i>L'Etoile</i> is
perfect--it simply <i>couldn't</i> be anything else."</p>

<p><i>"Quite!"</i> Starwick said concisely, and then, turning to
Eugene with his air of sad instructive earnestness, he continued:
"--And that woman at Le Jockey Club last night--the one who sang
the songs--you know?" he said with grave malicious inquiry, his
voice trembling a little and his face flushing as he spoke--"the
one you kept wanting to find out about--what she was saying?--"
Quiet ruddy laughter shook him.</p>

<p><i>"Perfectly</i> vile, of course!" cried Elinor with gay
horror. "And all the time, poor dear, he kept wanting to know
what it meant. . . . I was going to throw something at you if you
kept on--if I'd had to translate <i>that</i> I think I should
simply have passed out on the spot--"</p>

<p>"I know," said Starwick, burbling with laughter--"I caught the
look in your eye--it was really <i>quite</i> murderous! And
<i>terribly</i> amusing!" he added. Turning to his friend, he
went on seriously: "But really, Gene, it <i>is</i> rather stupid
to keep asking for the meaning of everything. It <i>is,</i> you
know. And it's so extraordinary," he said protestingly, "that a
person of your quality--your <i>kind</i> of understanding--should
be so dull about it! It really is."</p>

<p>"Why?" the other said bluntly, and rather sullenly. "What's
wrong with wanting to find out what's being said when you don't
understand the language? If I don't ask, how am I going to find
out?"</p>

<p>"But not at <i>all!"</i> Starwick protested impatiently.
"That's not the point at all: you can find out nothing that way.
Really you can't," he said reproachfully. "The whole point about
that song last night was not the words--the meaning of the thing.
If you tried to translate it into English, you'd lose the spirit
of the whole thing. Don't you see," he went on earnestly, "--it's
not the <i>meaning</i> of the thing--you can't translate a thing
like that, you really can't--if you tried to translate it, you'd
have nothing but a filthy and disgusting jingle--"</p>

<p>"But so long as it's French it's beautiful?" the other said
sarcastically.</p>

<p>"But <i>quite!"</i> said Starwick impatiently. "And it's very
stupid of you not to understand that, Gene. It really is. The
whole spirit and quality of the thing are <i>so</i> French--so
<i>utterly</i> French!" he said in a high and rather womanish
tone--"that the moment you translate it you lose everything. . .
. There's nothing disgusting about the song in French--the words
mean nothing, you pay no attention to the words; the
extraordinary thing is that you forget the words. . . . It's the
whole design of the thing, the <i>tone,</i> the <i>quality.</i> .
. . In a way," he added deeply, "the thing has an <i>enormous</i>
innocence--it really has, you know. . . . And it's so
disappointing that you fail to see this. . . . Really, Gene,
these questions you keep asking about names and meanings are
becoming tiresome. They really are. . . . And all these books you
keep buying and trying to translate with the help of a dictionary
. . . as if you're ever going to understand anything--I mean,
<i>really</i> understand," he said profoundly, "in that way."</p>

<p>"You may get to understand the language that way," the other
said.</p>

<p>"But not at <i>all!"</i> cried Starwick. "That's just the
point--you really find out nothing: you miss the whole spirit of
the thing--just as you missed the spirit of that song, and just
as you missed the point when you asked Elinor to translate La
P&ecirc;che Miraculeuse for you. . . . It's extraordinary that
you fail to see this. . . . The next thing you know," he
concluded sarcastically, a burble of malicious laughter appearing
as he spoke, "you will have enrolled for a course of lessons--"
he choked suddenly, his ruddy face flushing deeply with his
merriment--"for a course of lectures at the Berlitz language
school."</p>

<p>"Oh, but he's entirely capable of it!" cried Elinor, with gay
conviction. "I wouldn't put it past him for a moment. . . . My
<i>dear,"</i> she said drolly, turning toward him, "I have never
known such a glutton for knowledge. It's simply amazing. . . .
Why, the child wants to know the meaning of everything!" she said
with an astonished look about her--"the confidence he has in my
knowledge is rather touching--it really is--and I'm so unworthy
of it, darling," she said, a trifle maliciously. "I don't deserve
it at all!"</p>

<p>"I'm sorry if I've bored you with a lot of questions, Elinor,"
he said.</p>

<p>"But you <i>haven't!"</i> she protested. "Darling, you
<i>haven't</i> for a moment! I <i>love</i> to answer them! It's
only that I feel <i>so</i>--so <i>incompetent. . . .</i> But
listen, Gene," she went on coaxingly, "couldn't you try to forget
it for a while--just sort of forget all about these words and
meanings and enter into the spirit of the thing? . . . Couldn't
you, dear?" she said gently, and even as he looked at her with a
flushed face, unable to find a ready answer to her deft irony,
she put her hand out swiftly, patted him on the arm, and nodding
her head with an air of swift satisfied finality, said:</p>

<p>"Good! I knew you would! . . . He's really a darling when he
wants to be, isn't he?"</p>

<p>Starwick burbled with malicious laughter at sight of Eugene's
glowering and resentful face; then went on seriously:</p>

<p>"--But their genius for names is quite astonishing!--I mean,
even in the names of their towns you get the whole thing. . . .
What could be more like Paris," he said quietly, "than the name
of Paris? . . . The whole quality of the place is in the name. Or
Dijon, for example. Or Rheims. Or Carcassonne. The whole spirit
of Provence is in the word: what name could more perfectly
express Aries than the name it has--it gives you the whole place,
its life, its people, its peculiar fragrance. . . . And how
different we are from them in that respect. . . . I mean," his
voice rose on a note of passionate conviction, "you could almost
say that the whole difference between us--the thing we lack, the
thing they have--the whole thing that is wrong with us, is
evident in our names. . . . It really is, you know," he said
earnestly, turning toward his friend again. "The whole thing's
most important. . . . How harsh and meaningless most names in
America are, Eugene," he went on quietly. "Like addresses printed
on a thousand envelopes at once by a stamping machine--labels by
which a place may be identified but without meaning. . . . Tell
me," he said quietly, after a brief pause, "what was the name of
that little village your father came from? You told me one
time--I remember, because the whole thing I'm talking about--the
thing that's wrong with us--was in that name. What was it?"</p>

<p>"Brant's Mill," the other young man answered.</p>

<p>"Quite!" said Starwick with weary concision. "A man named
Brant had a mill, and so they called the place Brant's Mill."</p>

<p>"What's wrong with that?"</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing, I suppose," said Starwick quietly. "The whole
thing's quite perfect. . . . <i>Brant's</i> Mill," there was a
note of bitterness in his voice and he made the name almost
deliberately rasping as he pronounced it. "It's a name--something
to call a place by--if you write it on a letter it will get
there. . . . I suppose that's what a name is for. . . .
Gettysburg--I suppose a man named Gettys had a house or a farm,
and so they named the town after him. . . . And your mother? What
was the name of the place she came from?"</p>

<p>"It was a place called Yancey County."</p>

<p>"Quite," said Starwick as before--"and the name of the
town?"</p>

<p>"There wasn't any town, Frank. It was a kind of cross-roads
settlement called The Forks of Ivy."</p>

<p>"No!" Elinor's light Bostonian accent of astounded merriment
rang gaily forth. "Not <i>really!</i> You <i>know</i> it
wasn't!"</p>

<p>"But not at <i>all!"</i> said Starwick in a tone of mild and
serious disagreement. "The Forks of Ivy is not bad. It's really
surprisingly good, when you consider most of the other names. It
even has," he paused, and considered carefully, "a kind of
quality. . . . But Yancey," he paused again, the burble of sudden
laughter came welling up, and for a moment his pleasant ruddy
face was flushed with laughter--<i>"Ya-a-ancey</i> County"--with
deliberate malice he brought the word out in a rasping
countrified tone--"God!" he said frankly, turning to the other
boy, "isn't it awful! . . . How harsh! How stupid! How banal! . .
. And what are some of the names, where you come from, Gene?" he
went on quietly after a brief pause. "I'm sure you haven't yet
done your worst," he said. "There must be others just as sweet as
Ya-a-ancey."</p>

<p>"Well, yes," the boy said grinning, "we've got some good ones:
there's Sandy Mush, and Hooper's Bald, and Little Hominy. And we
have names like Beaverdam and Balsam, and Chimney Rock and Craggy
and Pisgah and The Rat. We have names like Old Fort, Hickory, and
Bryson City; we have Clingman's Dome and Little Switzerland; we
have Paint Rock and Saluda Mountain and the Frying Pan Gap--"</p>

<p>"Stop!" shrieked Elinor, covering her ears with her shocked
fingers--"The Frying Pan Gap! Oh, but that's
<i>horrible!"</i></p>

<p>"But how perfect!" Starwick quietly replied. "The whole
thing's there. And in the great and noble region where I come
from--" the note of weary bitterness in his tone grew
deeper--"out where the tall caw-r-n grows we have Keokuk and
Cairo and Peoria." He paused, his grave eyes fixed in a serious
and reflective stare: for a moment his pleasant ruddy face was
contorted by the old bestial grimace of anguish and confusion.
When he spoke again, his voice was weary with a quiet bitterness
of scorn. "I was born," he said, "in the great and noble town of
Bloomington, but--" the note of savage irony deepened--"at a very
tender age I was taken to Moline. And now, thank God, I am in
Paris"; he was silent a moment longer, and then continued in a
quiet and almost lifeless tone: "Paris, Dijon, Provence, Aries .
. . Yancey, Brant's Mill, Bloomington." He turned his quiet eyes
upon the other boy. "You see what I mean, don't you? The whole
thing's there."</p>

<p>"Yes," the boy replied, "I guess you're right."</p>

<p> </p>

<h1>LXXVIII</h1>

<p> </p>

<p>They were sitting at a table in one of the night places of
Montmartre. The place was close and hot, full of gilt and
glitter, heavy with that unwholesome and seductive fragrance of
the night that comes from perfumery, wine, brandy and the erotic
intoxication of a night-time pleasure place. Over everything
there was a bright yet golden blaze of light that wrought on all
it touched--gilt, tinsel, table linen, the natural hue and
colouring of the people, the faces of men, and the flesh of the
women--an evil but strangely thrilling transformation.</p>

<p>The orchestra had just finished playing a piece that everyone
in Paris was singing that year. It was a gay jigging little tune
that Mistinguette had made famous; its name was "Ca, c'est
Paris," and one heard it everywhere. One heard lonely wayfarers
whistling it as they walked home late at night through the silent
narrow streets of the Latin Quarter, and one heard it hummed by
taxi-drivers, waiters, and by women in caf&eacute;s. It was
played constantly to the tune of flutes and violins by dance
orchestras in the night-clubs of Montmartre and Montparnasse.
And, accompanied by the swelling rhythms of the accordion, one
heard it at big dance-halls like the Bal Bullier, and in the
little dives and stews and caf&eacute;-brothel-dancing places
along noisome alleyways near the markets and the Boulevard de
S&eacute;bastopol.</p>

<p>In spite of its gay jigging lilt, that tune had a kind of
mournful fatality. It was one of those songs which seem to evoke
perfectly--it is impossible to know why--the whole colour, life,
and fragrance of a place and time as nothing else on earth can
do. For the boy, that song would haunt him ever after with the
image of Paris and of his life that year, with the memory of
Starwick, Elinor, and Ann.</p>

<p>The song had for him the fatality of something priceless,
irrecoverably lost, full of that bitter joy and anguish we can
feel at twenty-four, when the knowledge of man's brevity first
comes to us, when we first know ruin and defeat, when we first
understand what we have never known before: that for us, as for
every other man alive, all passes, all is lost, all melts before
our grasp like smoke; when we know that the moment of beauty
carries in it the seeds of its own instant death, that love is
gone almost before we have it, that youth is gone before we know
it, and that, like every other man, we must grow old and die.</p>

<p>The orchestra had finished playing this tune and the dancers
were going to their tables from the polished little square of
floor; in a moment Starwick called the leader of the orchestra
over to the table and asked him to play Starwick's favourite
song. This was a piece called "My Chile Bon Bon"; it was not new,
Starwick had first heard it several years before in Boston, but
like the other piece this tune was pregnant with the mournful
fatality of a place and period; in its grotesque words and
haunting melody there was the sense of something irrevocable, an
utter surrender and a deliberate loss, a consciousness of doom.
These two pieces together evoked the whole image and quality of
that year, and of the life of these four people: for Starwick, in
fact, this "Chile Bon Bon" song somehow perfectly expressed the
complete fatality that had now seized his life, the sensual
inertia of his will.</p>

<p>The orchestra leader nodded smilingly when Starwick asked him
to play the song, went back and conferred with his musicians for
a moment, and, himself taking up a violin, began to play. As the
orchestra played, the leader walked toward their table, and,
bending and swaying with the infinite ductile grace which a
violin seems to give to all its performers, he stood facing the
two women, seeming to offer up the wailing, hauntingly mournful
and exciting music as a kind of devotion to their loveliness.</p>

<p>Elinor, tapping the tune out with her fingers on the
table-cloth, hummed the words lightly, absently, under her
breath; Ann sat quietly, darkly, sullenly attentive; Starwick, at
one end of the table, sat turned away, his legs indolently
crossed, his ruddy face flushed with emotion, his eyes fixed in a
blind stare, and a little wet.</p>

<p>Once, while the piece was being played, Starwick's pleasant
ruddy face was contorted again by the old bestial grimace of
nameless anguish and bewilderment which Eugene had seen so many
times before, and in which the sense of tragic defeat,
frustration, the premonition of impending ruin was legible.</p>

<p>When the orchestra leader had finished with the tune, Starwick
turned wearily, thrust his arm indolently across the table
towards Ann and wiggling his fingers languidly and a trifle
impatiently, said quietly:</p>

<p>"Give me some money."</p>

<p>She flushed a little, opened her purse, and said sullenly:</p>

<p>"How much do you want?"</p>

<p>The weary impatience of his manner became more evident, he
wiggled his languid fingers in a more peremptory command, and,
burbling a little with laughter at sight of her sullen face, he
said in a low tone of avaricious humour:</p>

<p>"Give, give, give. . . . Money, money, money," he said in a
low gloating tone, and burbled again, with a rich welling of
humour, as he looked at her.</p>

<p>Red in the face, she flung a wad of banknotes down upon the
table with almost vicious force; he accepted them languidly,
stripped off 300 franc notes and handed them indolently to the
orchestra leader, who responded with a bow eloquent with
adoration; and then, without pausing to count them, Starwick
thrust the remainder carelessly in his pocket.</p>

<p>"Ann!" he said reproachfully. "I am <i>very</i> hurt!" He
paused a moment; the flow and burble of soft laughter came
quickly, flushing his ruddy face, and he continued as before,
with a mock gravity of reproachful humour.</p>

<p>"I had hoped--" his shoulders trembled slightly--"that by this
time your <i>finer</i> nature--" he trembled again with secret
merriment--"your <i>finer</i> nature would be ready to reveal
itself."</p>

<p>"My finer nature be damned!" Ann said angrily. "Whether you
like it or not, I think it's disgraceful the way you fling money
around! Three hundred francs to a man for playing that damned
song! And you've done the same thing at least a dozen times! God,
I'm sick of hearing about your 'Chile Bon Bon'!" she concluded
bitterly. "I wish the damned thing had never been written."</p>

<p>"Ann!" again the soft mockery of sounded reproach. "And this
is the way you repay us, after all we've done for you! It's not
that I'm angry but I'm <i>very, very</i> hurt," he said gently.
"I really am, you know."</p>

<p>"Ah-h!" She made a sudden exasperated movement as if she was
going to push the table away from her and get up, and then said
with angry warning: "Now, look here, Frank, don't you start that
again about how much you've done for me. Done for me!" she said
furiously. "Done for me!" She laughed, short and hard, with angry
exasperation, and was unable to find words to continue.</p>

<p>Starwick's burble of soft laughter answered her:</p>

<p>"I <i>know!"</i> he said, his face reddening a little as he
spoke--"But, after all, you <i>are</i> a little <i>tight,</i>
Ann"--his shoulders trembled slightly, and his ruddy face grew
deeper with its hue of humour. "I think," he said gently, and
paused again, trembling with quiet laughter--"I think it may be
what is known as the Beacon Hill influence. And really," he
continued seriously, looking at her with grave eyes, "you really
ought to try to get it out of you."</p>

<p>"Now, Frank," cried Ann angrily, half rising from the table,
"if you start that again about my being stingy--" She sat down
again abruptly, and burst out with bitter resentment, "I'm not
stingy and you know it! . . . It's not that I mind spending the
money, giving it to you when I've got it. . . . It's only that I
think everyone ought to try to bear his own share. . . . If you
think that's my New England stinginess you're welcome to your
opinion. . . . But I've always felt that way and always will! . .
. Stingy!" she muttered, "I'm not. . . . I'm just tired of being
the goat all the time. . . . It seems to me the rest of you ought
to share in the expense some time!"</p>

<p>"But not at <i>all!"</i> cried Starwick in a tone of
astonished protest. "I can't see that that makes the
<i>slightest</i> difference," he went on gently. "After all, Ann,
it's not as if we were four old maids from Boston doing the grand
tour and putting down every cent we spend in a mutual
account-book," he said a trifle sarcastically. "It's not that
kind of thing at all. When four people know each other the way we
do, the last thing in the world that could <i>possibly</i> be of
value is money. What belongs to one belongs to all. Really," he
said a trifle impatiently, "I should think you'd understand that.
It's <i>quite</i> astonishing to see a person of your quality
with such a material--rather <i>grasping</i>--view of money. I
shouldn't think it would make the <i>slightest</i> difference to
you. You really ought to get it out of your system, Ann," he said
quietly. "You really must. Because you <i>are</i> a <i>grand</i>
person--you really are, you know."</p>

<p>She flushed, and then muttered sullenly:</p>

<p>"Ah! Grand person my eye! I've heard all that before! You
can't get around it that way!"</p>

<p>"But you <i>are!"</i> he said, with earnest insistence. "You
are a <i>very</i> grand person--that's what makes the whole thing
such a pity."</p>

<p>She flushed again, and then sat staring at the table in sullen
embarrassment.</p>

<p>"And, Ann," said Starwick gently, beginning to burble with his
soft flow of wicked laughter, "you are really <i>very</i>
beautiful in that red dress--" his sensuous mannered tone
trembled again with its burble of wicked humour--"and <i>very</i>
seductive--and <i>very,</i>" his shoulders trembled and his face
trembled as he spoke--"You are really <i>quite</i> voluptuous,"
he said with sensual relish, and suddenly choked with laughter.
When he had composed himself, he turned his still
laughter-reddened face towards Eugene, and said earnestly: "It's
<i>quite</i> astonishing! She really is, you know! She's
<i>gloriously</i> beautiful!"</p>

<p>"Frank!" she looked at him for a moment with an expression of
baffled exasperation. Then, suddenly she laughed her short and
angry laugh: "God!" she cried sarcastically. "It's a high price
to pay for compliments, isn't it?"</p>

<p>But that laugh, short and angry as it was, had made radiant,
as it always did, her dark and noble beauty. Instantly her face
had been lifted, transfigured from its customary expression of
dark and almost heavy sullenness, her cheeks, which in repose had
the pendulous sagging quality of a plump child, were suffused
with rose, her sweet red mouth and white teeth suddenly shone
with a radiant and lovely smile, and Eugene noticed now, as he
had begun to notice, that her grey eyes when she looked at
Starwick were no longer hard and angry, but smoky, luminous with
a depthless tenderness.</p>

<p>"You <i>are,"</i> Starwick concluded quietly, seriously, his
pleasant face still a trifle flushed with laughter. "You are one
of the most <i>gloriously</i> beautiful creatures that ever
lived."</p>

<p>What he said was the simple truth. The girl's beauty that
night was almost unbelievable. She had put on a new evening dress
which had been made for her by a famous designer. The dress was a
glorious red, that seemed almost to float with an aerial buoyancy
of filmy gauze; no dress in the world could have suited her dark
beauty or revealed the noble proportions of her figure half so
well. Her hair, which was black, coarse, and fragrant, was parted
simply in the middle: Eugene noted that there were already a few
streaks of coarse grey in it, but her face had the dignity of her
grand and honest character--the sullen plumpness of a child and
the radiant sudden sweetness and happiness of her smile,
combined.</p>

<p>And in every other respect Ann showed this strange and lovely
union of delicacy and grandeur, of the child and the woman. Her
hands were long, brown, and narrow, the fingers long and
delicate, the bones as fine and small as a bird's, and yet they
were strong, sensitive, able-looking hands as well. Her arms were
long and slender, as firm and delicate as a young girl's, but
Eugene noted that her breasts were not round and firm, but the
long heavy sloping breasts of a big woman. When she got up to
dance with Starwick she topped him by a head, and yet, radiant
with a joy and happiness she had never known before, she seemed
to float there in his arms, an Amazonian figure, great of thigh
and limb and breast, and a creature of a loveliness as delicate
and radiant as a child's.</p>

<p>They danced superbly together: in deference to Starwick, the
orchestra played his "Chile Bon Bon" song again; when they
returned to the table Starwick's ruddy face was flushed with the
emotion the song always aroused in him, his eyes looked wet, and
in a high, passionate, almost womanish tone, he cried to
Eugene:</p>

<p>"God! Isn't it grand! Isn't it simply superb! It's one of the
great songs of the world; it really is, you know! The thing has
the same quality as a great primitive--the same quality as a
primitive Apollo or Cimabue's Madonna, in the Louvre. Christ!" he
cried in a high womanish tone, "the whole thing's there--it
really is! I think it's the greatest song that was ever
written!"</p>

<p>He poured out a glass of champagne, cold and sparkling, and
drank it thirstily, his eyes wet, his face flushed deeply with
his feeling.</p>

<p> </p>

<h1>LXXIX</h1>

<p> </p>

<p>In the dull grey light of the short and swiftly waning
winter's day, the two young men were leaving the museum, to spend
the rest of the afternoon until the time of their appointed
meeting with the women, in drink and talk at one of the
innumerable and seductive caf&eacute;s of the magic city. Outside
the Louvre, they hailed a taxi and were driven swiftly over one
of the bridges of the Seine, through the narrow streets of the
Latin Quarter, and at length stopped and got out before La
Closerie des Lilas, where they were to meet the two women later
on.</p>

<p>They spent the remainder of the afternoon in the chill wintry
air of the terrace, warm with drink, with argument or discussion,
and with the gaiety of life and voices of people all around them,
the pageant of life that passed for ever on the street before
them--all that priceless, rare, and uncostly pleasure and
excitement of caf&eacute; life which seemed unbelievable and
magical to these two young Americans. The dull grey air, which
was at once chill and wintry, and yet languorous, filled them
with the sense of some powerful, strange, and inhuman excitement
that was impending for them.</p>

<p>And the bright gaiety of the colours, the constant flash and
play of life about them and along the pavements, the smell and
potent intoxication of the cognac, gave them the sensation of a
whole world given over without reserve or shame to pleasure. All
these elements, together with that incomparable fusion of
odours--at once corrupt and sensual, subtle and obscene--which
exudes from the very texture of the Paris life--odours which it
is impossible to define exactly but which seem in the dull wintry
air to be compacted of the smells of costly perfumes, of wine,
beer, brandy, and of the acrid and nostalgic fumes of French
tobacco, of roasted chestnuts, black French coffee, mysterious
liquors of a hundred brilliant and intoxicating colours, and the
luxurious flesh of scented women--smote the two young men
instantly with the sensual impact of this strange and fascinating
world.</p>

<p>But in spite of all the magic of the scene, and the assurance
and security which Starwick's presence always gave to him, the
ghost of the old unquiet doubt would not wholly be laid at rest,
the ache of the old hunger stirred in Eugene. Why was he here
now? Why had he come? The lack of purpose in this present life,
the dozing indolence of this existence in which no one worked, in
which they sat constantly at tables in a caf&eacute;, and ate and
drank and talked, and moved on to sit at other tables, other
caf&eacute;s--and, most of all, the strange dull faces of the
Frenchmen, the strange and alien life of this magic city which
was so seductive but so unalterably foreign to all that he had
ever known--all this had now begun to weigh inexplicably upon a
troubled spirit, to revive again the old feelings of naked
homelessness, to stir in him the nameless sense of shame and
guilt which an American feels at a life of indolence and
pleasure, which is part of the very chemistry of his blood, and
which he can never root out of him. And feeling the obscure but
powerful insistence of these troubled thoughts within his mind,
he turned suddenly to Starwick, and without a word of explanation
said:</p>

<p>"But do you really feel at home here?"</p>

<p>"What do you mean by 'feeling at home'?"</p>

<p>"Well, I mean don't you ever feel out of place here? Don't you
ever feel as if you didn't belong to this life--that you are a
foreigner?"</p>

<p>"But not at all!" said Starwick a trifle impatiently. "On the
contrary, I think it is the first time in my life that I have
<i>not</i> felt like a foreigner. I never felt at home in the
Middle-West where I was born; I hated the place from my earliest
childhood, I always felt out of place there, and wanted to get
away from it. But I felt instantly at home in Paris from the
moment I got here:--I am far closer to this life than to any
other life I've ever known, for the first time in my life I feel
thoroughly at home."</p>

<p>"And you don't mind being a foreigner?"</p>

<p>"But of course not!" Starwick said curtly. "Besides, I am
<i>not</i> a foreigner. You can only be foreign in a place that
is foreign to you. This place is not."</p>

<p>"But, after all, Frank, you are not a Frenchman. You are an
American."</p>

<p>"Not at all," Starwick answered concisely. "I am an American
only by the accident of birth; by spirit, temperament,
inclination, I have always been a European."</p>

<p>"And you mean you could continue to lead this kind of life
without ever growing tired of it?"</p>

<p>"What do you mean by 'this kind of life'?" said Starwick.</p>

<p>His friend nodded towards the crowded and noisy terrace of the
caf&eacute;.</p>

<p>"I mean sitting around at caf&eacute;s all day long, going to
night-clubs--eating, drinking, sitting,--moving on from one place
to another--spending your life that way."</p>

<p>"Do you think it's such a bad way to spend your life?" said
Starwick quietly. He turned, regarding his friend with serious
eyes. "Don't you find it very amusing?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Frank, for a time. But after a while, don't you think
you'd get tired of it?"</p>

<p>"No more tired," said Starwick, "than I would of going to an
office day after day at nine o'clock and coming away at five,
doing useless and dreary work that someone else could do as well.
On the contrary, this kind of life--" he nodded towards the
crowded tables--"seems to me much more interesting and
amusing."</p>

<p>"But how can you feel that you belong to it?" the other said.
"I should think that would make a difference to you. It does to
me--the feeling that I am a stranger here, that this is not my
life, that I know none of these people."</p>

<p>"Are you getting ready to tell me now that an American never
really gets to know any French people?" said Starwick, repeating
the banal phrase with a quiet sarcasm that brought a flush to the
other's face.</p>

<p>"Well, it's not likely that he will, from what I've
heard."</p>

<p>Starwick cast a weary look around him at the chattering group
of people at the other tables.</p>

<p>"God!" he said quietly. "I shouldn't think he'd want to. I
imagine most of them are about as dull a lot as you could
find."</p>

<p>"If you feel that way about them, what is the great attraction
Paris holds for you? How can you possibly feel that way about the
people and still say you feel at home here?"</p>

<p>"Because Paris belongs to the world--to Europe--more than it
belongs to France. One does not come here because he wants to
know the French: he comes because he can find here the most
pleasant, graceful and civilized life on earth."</p>

<p>"Yes, but there are other things that may be more important
than leading a graceful and pleasant life."</p>

<p>"What, for instance?" said Starwick, looking at him.</p>

<p>"Getting your work done is one of them. For you, I should
think that would be a great deal more important."</p>

<p>Starwick was again silent; the old bestial grimace, image of
an unutterable anguish and confusion in his soul, for a moment
contorted his pleasant ruddy face, developed, passed, was gone;
he said quietly and with the infinite weariness of despair that
had now become the image of his life:</p>

<p>"Getting my work done! My God! as if it mattered."</p>

<p>"There was a time when you thought it did, Frank."</p>

<p>"Yes, there was a time when I did think so," he said
lifelessly.</p>

<p>"And now you no longer feel that way about it?"</p>

<p>Starwick was silent; when he spoke again, it was not to answer
directly.</p>

<p>--"Always the old unquiet heart," he said wearily and sadly;
he turned and looked silently at his friend for a moment. "Why?
Since I first knew you, you have been like that, Eugene--wanting
to devour the earth, lashing your soul to frenzy in this useless,
hopeless and impossible search for knowledge."</p>

<p>"Why useless or hopeless, Frank?"</p>

<p>"Because it is a kind of madness in you that grows worse all
the time; because you cannot cure it or ever satisfy this hunger
of yours while you have it; because it will exhaust you, break
your heart, and drive you mad; and because, even if you could
gratify this impossible desire to absorb the whole sum of
recorded knowledge and experience in the world, you would gain
nothing by it."</p>

<p>"There I can't agree with you."</p>

<p>"Do you really think," said Starwick wearily, "that if you
could achieve this hopeless ambition of reading all the books
that were ever printed--of knowing all the people--seeing all the
places--that you would be any better off than you now are? Now,
day after day, you go prowling up and down along the book-stalls
on the Seine, pawing through tons of junk and rubbish until your
very heart is sick with weariness and confusion. When you are not
with us, you sit alone in a caf&eacute; with a dictionary beside
you trying to decipher the meaning of some useless and
meaningless book. You no longer enjoy what you read, because you
are tortured by a consciousness of the vast number of books you
have not read; you go to the museums--to the Louvre--and you no
longer enjoy the pictures, because you torture your brain and
exhaust your energy in a foolish effort to see and remember all
of them. You no longer enjoy the crowd, you go out on the streets
of Paris, you sit here in this crowded caf&eacute;--and instead
of taking pleasure in all this gaiety and life about you, you are
tortured by the thought that you know none of these people, that
you know nothing about their lives, that there are four million
people here in Paris and you do not know a dozen of them. . . .
Eugene, Eugene," he said sadly, "this thing in you is growing
worse all the time; if you do not master it, it is a disease that
will some day drive you mad and destroy you."</p>

<p>"And yet, Frank, many people on this earth have had the same
disease. Because of it, in order to get knowledge, Doctor Faust
sold his soul to the devil."</p>

<p>"Alas," said Starwick, "where is the devil?" In a moment he
continued quietly, as before: "Do you think that you will really
gain in wisdom if you read a million books? Do you think you will
find out more about life if you know a million people rather than
yourself? Do you think you will get more pleasure from a thousand
women than from two or three--see more if you go to a hundred
countries instead of six? And finally, do you think you'll get
more happiness from life by 'getting your work done' than by
doing nothing? My God! Eugene--" his voice was weary with the
resigned fatality of despair that had now corrupted him--"you
still feel that it is important that you 'do your work,' as you
call it, but what will it matter if you do or don't? You want to
lead the artist's life, to do the artist's work, to create out of
the artist's materials--what will it matter in the end if you do
this, or nothing?"</p>

<p>"You did not always feel so, Frank."</p>

<p>"No," said Starwick wearily, "there was a time when I felt
differently. There was a time when I felt that the artist's life
was the finest life on earth--the only life I would care to
lead."</p>

<p>"And now?"</p>

<p>"Now--nothing--nothing," he spoke so quietly that his words
were scarcely audible. "It no longer matters. . . . I go to the
Louvre and look at that colossal mountain of junk--up and down
those endless corridors hung with the dull or worthless work of
thousands of dead men who once felt as I did--that they must
create, express the image of their soul--that art and the
artist's life were all that mattered. Now they are dead, their
dreary works have been left behind as a kind of useless relic of
their agony: in that whole gigantic storage-plant of worthless
art--there are just three pictures I should have cared to
paint--and I know it's not in me to paint any of them. I thought
I wanted to write plays, but now I feel the same about that, too;
among all the thousands of plays I have read or seen, I doubt
that there are a dozen which I should have cared to write--and I
know now that I could have written none of them. . . . What does
it matter? Why do you goad your spirit and exhaust your mind with
these frantic efforts, these useless desires to add another book
or play to the mountains of books and plays that have already
been written? Why should we break our hearts to add to that
immense accumulation of dull, fair, or trivial work that has
already been done?" He was silent a moment longer, and then the
colour in his ruddy face deepening with excitement, he said in a
high, passionate tone: "What is great--what is priceless--what we
would give our lives to do--is so impossible--so utterly,
damnably impossible! And if we can never do the best--then why do
anything?"</p>

<p>For a moment, there returned to the other a memory of the
moonlit streets of Cambridge, and of a night when Starwick, drunk
with wine and the generous and extravagant enthusiasm of youth,
had turned to him and in a voice that rung along the sleeping
street, had called him a mighty poet. And he remembered how his
own heart had beat hot with hope and joy at the sound of those
proud and foolish words, and how he had grasped Starwick's hand
and wrung it with a hard grip of passionate conviction, and told
Frank what he believed at that moment with all the ardour of his
heart--that Starwick was the greatest young man of his time and
generation.</p>

<p>And remembering now those two drunk and happy boys who stood
there in the moon-still streets, and spoke to each other the
compact of their devotion and belief, he wanted to ask Frank if
this weary acquiescence in defeat, that had now become the very
colour of his life, was a better thing than the proud and foolish
vision of a boy.</p>

<p>But he said nothing, and after a moment's silence, Starwick
looked at his watch and called the waiter, saying that it was
already time for their meeting with the two women at a
caf&eacute; in Montparnasse. Therefore, they paid the bill and
departed; but what Frank had said to him that day would live in
his memory in years to come. For in Frank's words were implicit
every element of the resignation, despair, and growing inertia
and apathy of his will.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>The relations between these four people had now been strained
to the breaking-point. That month of debauch had exacted a stern
tribute from them. Their exhausted bodies and frayed nerves cried
out for rest, a period of curative repose when the well of their
drained energy could be filled up again. But like creatures
hopelessly addicted to a drug, they could not break the bonds of
this tyranny of pleasure which held them. Starwick seemed to be
completely enslaved by this senseless and furious quest, this
frantic seeking after new sensations, this hopeless pursuit of a
happiness, a fulfilment, that they never found. He seemed unable
or unwilling to break the evil spell. Rather, as if a poisonous
hunger was feeding on his vitals--a hunger that grew constantly
from the food it fed upon, and that could not be assuaged by any
means--the evil inertia of his will, the ugly impassivity of his
resignation became every day more marked.</p>

<p>Of all of them, he alone preserved the appearance of calm. And
that cold, impassive calm was maddening: he met the storms of
anger, protests, reproaches, and persuasions of the others with
an air of sad humility, a kind of sorrowful acceptance, a quiet
agreement to every accusation or indictment, a grand manner of
sweet, sorrowful contrition that was more hateful than any
deliberate insult could have been. For behind this impenetrable
armour of humility, this air of mysterious fatality, there was
evident a hateful arrogance which said that words were useless
because no words could express the fatal wisdom of his soul, and
which, with a stubborn and abominable perversity, seemed
deliberately resolved on ruin.</p>

<p>His conduct became daily more absurd, extravagant, ridiculous.
He was acting like a melodramatic fool, but it was impossible to
laugh at his folly because of the desperate fatality that
attended it. He did unbelievable things, contrived unbelievable
situations that seemed fitting only in a world of opera but were
shamefully unreal and unnecessary in the real one. What was
really shameful and unworthy in his conduct was this--his
fatality served no purpose, his reckless and deliberate pursuit
of danger did no good except to dignify the melodramatic
unreality of a comic opera situation with the realities of blood
and death.</p>

<p>He was constantly and deliberately involving himself and
others in these ridiculous but perilous situations. One night, in
one of the Montmartre resorts, he had a quarrel with a man that
would have been farcical save for the ugly consequences it
produced, the painful and shameful memory it would later evoke.
The man, an unpleasant, wizened-looking little Frenchman, a
creature of the night, with obscene eyes, a yellowed skin, and a
pointed beard half covering the features of a rodent, had not
been able to keep his ugly eyes off Ann, had measured the noble
proportions of her beauty with a kind of foul leering appraisal
that had in it something almost as palpable and sensual as a
naked touch, and now, as the orchestra struck up another tune, he
approached the table, bowed, and asked her, courteously enough,
for a dance.</p>

<p>Ann reddened furiously in the face, looked down sullenly at
the tablecloth and, before she was able to think of a reply,
Starwick said:</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle does not care to dance. Please go away."</p>

<p>The cold arrogance of Starwick's tone, and his curt dismissal,
enraged the Frenchman. When he replied, his lips were bared in an
ugly smile that showed unpleasant fangs of yellowed teeth; he
said:</p>

<p>"Is the lady not allowed to speak for herself? Is Monsieur
perhaps her guardian?"</p>

<p>"Will you please go away now?" Starwick said again, with a
cold and weary impassivity. "You are boring us."</p>

<p>"But, it's marvellous!" The little Frenchman cast back his
yellowed face and bared his fangs in a laugh of envenomed
mockery. "It's Monsieur D'Artagnan come to life again, and a lady
so shy and modest that she can't speak for herself! But, it's
superb!" he cried again, and with an ironic bow, concluded:
"Monsieur, with all my heart I thank you for this wonderful
diversion! You are very droll!"</p>

<p>Starwick's reply to this was to pick up the seltzer bottle on
the table and, without for a moment altering his air of cold
impassivity, to squirt the siphon straight in the little
Frenchman's yellow face.</p>

<p>In a moment, the place was a seething maelstrom of excitement.
People all over sprang up from their tables, the dancers stopped
dancing, the orchestra stopped with a crash, and the proprietor
and the waiter came towards them on the run.</p>

<p>They were at once surrounded by an excited group of
gesticulating, chattering people, all trying to talk at once.
Starwick was standing up now, facing his antagonist, cold and
impassive save for a deeper flush of excitement on his ruddy
face. As for the little Frenchman, the look of murderous hatred
on his face was horrible. Without stopping to dry his dripping
face with the napkin which an excited and persuasive waiter was
offering him, he thrust aside the manager, who was trying to
restrain him, and coming close to Starwick, snarled:</p>

<p>"Your name, monsieur? I demand to know your name. My
representatives will call upon you in the morning."</p>

<p>"Good," said Starwick coldly. "I shall wait for them. Monsieur
shall have whatever satisfaction he desires."</p>

<p>And taking a card from his purse, he wrote the studio address
below his name and gave it to the man.</p>

<p>"Ah, good!" the Frenchman cried harshly, glancing at it.
"Until tomorrow!"</p>

<p>And calling for his bill, and silent to all the apologies and
cajoleries of the proprietor, he departed.</p>

<p>"But Frank, darling!" Elinor cried, when they had seated
themselves again. "What do you intend to do? Surely you're not
going to--" She did sot finish, but stared at him with a troubled
and astonished face.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Starwick coldly and quietly. "He has asked me to
fight a duel, and if he wants it, I shall meet him."</p>

<p>"Oh, but don't be absurd!" cried Elinor with an impatient
laugh. "What on earth do you know about fighting duels? My poor
child, how can you be so ridiculous! This is the twentieth
century, darling. Don't you know that people don't act that way
any longer?"</p>

<p>"Quite!" said Starwick, with a stony calm. "Nevertheless, I
shall meet him if he wants me to." He looked at her with quiet
eyes for a moment, and then said gravely: "I've <i>got</i> to do
that. I really have, you know."</p>

<p>"Got to!" Elinor cried impatiently. "Why, the child is
<i>mad!"</i> Her tone immediately became crisp, incisive,
authoritative: she began to speak to him quietly, kindly, but in
a peremptory tone, as one might speak to a child:</p>

<p>"Francis," she said quietly. "Listen to me! Don't be an idiot!
What does it matter about that wretched little man? It's all over
now! A duel! Good heavens! Don't be such a child! Whoever heard
of such a thing?"</p>

<p>His face reddened a little from her ridicule, but he answered,
in a cold impassive tone:</p>

<p>"Quite! Nevertheless, I shall meet him if he wants it!"</p>

<p>"Meet him!" Elinor cried again. "Oh, Francis, how can you be
so stupid! Meet him with what?"</p>

<p>"With whatever weapon he wants to use," Starwick replied.
"Pistols or swords--it doesn't matter!"</p>

<p>"Pistols or swords!" Elinor shrieked faintly, and began to
laugh. "Why, you idiot, what do you know about pistols or swords?
You've never had a sword in your hand in your life--and as for
pistols, you wouldn't even know how to point the thing and press
the trigger!"</p>

<p>"It doesn't matter," he said in a very quiet and fatal way. "I
shall fire into the air."</p>

<p>In spite of the ridiculous and melodramatic quality of these
foolish words, no one laughed. They saw suddenly what fatal
consequences this farcical situation might have, and having felt
the desperation of his soul--that terrible despair which now
seemed to be driving him on to seek ruin everywhere--they knew he
would do exactly as he said, if given the opportunity.</p>

<p>Elinor started to go: she beckoned to a waiter and called for
the bill, and said persuasively:</p>

<p>"Come on! Let's get out of this place! You've had too much to
drink! I think your head needs clearing--a little fresh air will
do you good. You'll feel different about all this tomorrow!"</p>

<p>"But not at all!" he said patiently, and then, as she started
to get up: "Will you please sit down. We're not going yet."</p>

<p>"But why, darling? Aren't you ready? Haven't you raised enough
hell for one evening--or do you want to fight a duel with someone
else? Besides, I do think you might think of Ann. I know she's
wanted to go for some time."</p>

<p>"But <i>why?"</i> he said, turning to Ann with an air of fine
surprise. "Aren't you enjoying yourself? It's a <i>very</i> good
place, and the music is awfully good--it really is, you
know."</p>

<p>"Oh, charming, charming!" she muttered sarcastically. She had
been staring at the table-cloth sullenly, with a flaming face,
ever since the quarrel had begun, and now looking up suddenly,
with a short and angry laugh, she said:</p>

<p>"God! I don't know whether to walk out of here or
<i>crawl!</i> I feel all--<i>undressed!"</i></p>

<p>At these words, his face really did flush crimson with
embarrassment. He looked at her for a moment, and then said
sharply, with a note of stern reproof and anger in his voice:</p>

<p>"Ann! It's <i>very</i> bad and <i>very</i>
wrong--and--and--very <i>mean</i> of you to talk like that."</p>

<p>"That's how I feel," she muttered.</p>

<p>"Then," he said quietly but with two deep and angry spots of
colour flaming in his cheeks, "I'm <i>thoroughly</i> ashamed of
you. It's <i>quite</i> unworthy of you. At a time like this, a
person of your quality has got to show more--" he paused,
choosing the word carefully, "more <i>fibre.</i> You really must,
you know!"</p>

<p>"Oh, fibre my eye!" she flared up, looking at him with
flushed, lovely and angry eyes. "You don't lack fibre simply
because you don't want to be made a fool of! Frank, you make me
tired, the way you talk! Everywhere we go now someone's always
showing 'fibre'--and everyone is having a rotten, awful time. For
God's sake, let's not talk so much about showing fibre and let's
try to enjoy ourselves and get some pleasure and some happiness
from life, and act like decent, natural people for a change. I
had looked forward so much to coming on this trip with
Elinor--and now--" Tears of anger and disappointment glittered in
her eyes, she looked down at the table sullenly in an effort to
conceal them, and then muttered: "Playing the fool and making
scenes and starting rows everywhere we go! Getting into trouble
everywhere, making people hate us, never having any fun!
Squirting siphons at some wretched little man--" she made a
sudden impulsive gesture of disgust and turned away. "God! It
makes me sick!"</p>

<p>"I'm sorry to know you feel that way," he said quietly. "I'll
try to see it doesn't happen again--but, after all, Ann--the
reason it did happen is because I like you so <i>very</i> much,
and have so much respect for you and won't stand for anyone
insulting you!"</p>

<p>"Ah-h! Insulting me!" she said angrily. "Good heavens,
Francis, do you think I need protection from a wretched little
man like that? When I've been a nurse, and had to go alone to
every rotten slum in Boston, and learned to handle people twice
his size! Protect me!" she said bitterly. "Thank you for nothing!
I didn't come over here to be protected--I don't need it. I can
take care of myself. Just try to act and feel like a decent human
being--let's try to be friends together and to show some
consideration for each other--and don't worry about protecting
me!"</p>

<p> </p>

<h1>LXXXI</h1>

<p> </p>

<p>He slept little that night. The quarrel in the night-club and
its consequences seemed fantastic, incredible, like a nightmare.
At daybreak he got up and went to the window and stared out at
the grey light just breaking on the roofs and chimney-pots of
Paris. The old buildings emerged haggard, pale, lemony, with all
the wonderful, homely practicality of dawn and morning, and
looking at them, Montmartre, the blaze of lights, the music and
the drunken voices, and the quarrel with the Frenchman--the whole
strange and evil chemistry of night--seemed farther away, more
unreal and dream-like than ever. Could it have happened? Had
Starwick really been challenged to a duel? Was he going through
with it?</p>

<p>He got up and dressed, and with dry lips and a strange, numb
lightness in his limbs, descended to the street and hailed a
passing taxi in the Rue Bonaparte. The sounds of morning,
shutters being rolled up, scrubwomen and maids down on their
knees at entrances, shops being opened--all this made the night
before seem more unreal than ever.</p>

<p>When he got to the studio he found everybody up. Ann was
already at work making coffee, scrambling eggs for breakfast.
Elinor was just combing up her hair, Starwick was in the balcony
and had not yet come down. Elinor kept talking as she arranged
her hair, and from the balcony Starwick answered her.</p>

<p>"But Frank!" she was saying, "you know you wouldn't be fool
enough to do such a thing! Surely you don't mean you intend to go
through with it?"</p>

<p>"Ace," he said coldly from above, "I do mean to. Quite!"</p>

<p>"But--oh! Don't be an ass!" she cried impatiently. Turning to
Ann, with a little, frowning smile, she bit her lips, and shaking
her head slightly, cried in an astounded tone:</p>

<p>"Isn't it <i>incredible!</i> Did you ever hear of such an
<i>insane</i> thing in all your life?"</p>

<p>But in the set of her jaw, the faint smile around the corner
of her mouth, there was the look of grim decision they had all
seen before.</p>

<p>As Eugene entered, Ann turned from the stove, and, spoon in
hand, stood looking at him sullenly for a moment. Suddenly she
laughed her short and angry laugh and turned away toward Elinor,
saying:</p>

<p>"God! Here's the second! Don't they make a pair!"</p>

<p>"But my <i>dear!"</i> cried Elinor with a light, gay malice.
"Where is the top-hat? Where are the striped trousers and the
morning coat? Where is the duelling case with the revolvers? . .
. All right, Monsieur D'Artagnan," she called up towards the
balcony ironically. "Your friend Monsieur Porthos has arrived . .
. and breakfast is ready, darling! What's that they say about an
army?" she innocently inquired, "--that it ought not to fight on
an empty stomach? . . . Ahem!" she cleared her throat. "Will
Monsieur D'Artagnan condescend to have the company of two frail
women for breakfast on the morning of the great affair . . . or
does Monsieur prefer to be left alone with his devoted second to
discuss--ahem! ahem! . . . the final arrangements?"</p>

<p>Starwick made no reply, until he had come down the steps.</p>

<p>"You can stay, if you want to," he said indifferently. "I
shall have nothing to say to them, anyway." Turning to Eugene, he
said with magnificent, bored weariness: "Find out what they want.
Let me know what they want to do."</p>

<p>"B--but, what do you want me to say to them, Frank? What shall
I tell them?"</p>

<p>"Anything," said Starwick indifferently. "Anything you like.
Say that I will meet him anywhere--on any terms--whatever they
like. Let them settle it their own way."</p>

<p>He picked up a spoon and started to eat his orange.</p>

<p>"Oh, Frank, you idiot!" cried Elinor, seizing him by the hair
and shaking his head. "Don't be stupid! You know you're not going
on with this farce!"</p>

<p>He lifted quiet, wearily patient eyes and looked at her.</p>

<p>"Sorry!" he said. "But I've <i>got</i> to. If that's what he
wants, I really must, I owe the man that much--I really do, you
know!"</p>

<p>Breakfast then proceeded in a painful and uneasy silence,
broken only by Elinor's malicious thrusts, and maintained by
Starwick's weary and impassive calm.</p>

<p>At ten o'clock there were steps along the alley-way outside,
someone mounted the veranda, and the studio bell jangled. The two
women exchanged uneasy looks, Starwick got up quietly and turned
away, and in a moment Elinor called out sharply: "Entrez."</p>

<p>The door opened and a man entered the room. He wore striped
trousers that were in need of pressing, a frayed and worn-looking
frock-coat, and he carried a brief-case under his arm. He was
bald, sallow, about forty-five years old, and had a little
moustache and furtive eyes. He looked at each person in the room
quickly, sharply, and then said inquiringly:</p>

<p>"Monsieur Star-<i>week?"</i></p>

<p>"Ace," said Starwick quietly, and turned.</p>

<p>"Ah, bon!" the little Frenchman said briskly, and smiled,
showing yellow fangs of teeth. He had been bent slightly forward,
holding his brief-case with thin, eager fingers, as he waited.
Now he came forward swiftly, took a card out of his wallet, and
presenting it to Starwick with something of a flourish, said:</p>

<p>"Monsieur, permettez-moi. Ma carte."</p>

<p>Starwick glanced at the card indifferently, and was about to
put it down upon the table when the little Frenchman interrupted
him. Stretching out his thin and rather grimy hand, he said
courteously yet eagerly:</p>

<p>"S'il vous pla&icirc;t, monsieur!"--took the card again, and
put it back into his wallet.</p>

<p>Starwick indicated a chair and said:</p>

<p>"Won't you sit down?"</p>

<p>From that time on, the conversation proceeded in mutilated
French and English. The little Frenchman sat down, hitched up his
striped trousers carefully and with his arched fingers poised
upon his bony knees, bent forward and, with another ingratiating
and somewhat repulsive smile, said:</p>

<p>"Monsieur Star-week ees Am&eacute;ricain, n'est-ce pas?"</p>

<p>"Ace," said Starwick.</p>

<p>"And was at Le Rat Mort last night?"</p>

<p>"Ace," said Starwick again.</p>

<p>"Et Monsieur?" He nodded enquiringly toward Eugene, "vas also
zere?"</p>

<p>"Ace," Starwick answered.</p>

<p>"Et Mademoiselle . . . et Mademoiselle," he turned with
courteous inquiry towards the two young women--"zey vere also
zere?"</p>

<p>"Ace," said Starwick as before.</p>

<p>"Ah, bon!" the little Frenchman cried, nodding his head
vigorously, and with an air of complete satisfaction. Then,
rubbing his bony, little hands together dryly and briskly, he
took up his thin and battered old brief-case, which he had been
holding firmly between his knees, swiftly unfastened the straps
and unlatched it, and took out a few sheets of flaming, yellow
paper covered with notations in a fine, minute hand:</p>

<p>"Monsieur--" he began, clearing his throat, and rattling the
flimsy sheets impressively--"Monsieur, I s'ink"--he looked up at
Starwick ingratiatingly, but with an air of sly insinuation,
"--Monsieur, I s'ink, perhaps, vas"--he shrugged his shoulders
slightly, with an air of deprecation--"Monsieur
vas--drink-<i>ing</i>?"</p>

<p>Starwick made no answer for a moment: his face reddened, he
inclined his head, and said coldly, but unconcedingly:</p>

<p>"Oui! C'est &ccedil;a, monsieur!"</p>

<p>"Ah-h!" the little Frenchman cried again with a dry little
cackle of satisfaction--"--an' ven one drink--espeecial<i>ee</i>,
monsieur, ven ve are yong," he laughed ingratiatingly again,
"--he sometime do an' say some t'ings zat he regret--eh?"</p>

<p>"But of course!" cried Elinor at this point, quickly,
impatiently, eagerly. "That's just the point! Frank was
drinking--the whole thing happened like a flash--it's all over
now--we're sorry--everyone is sorry:--it was a regrettable
mistake--we're sorry for it--we apologize!"</p>

<p>"But not at all!" cried Starwick, reddening angrily, and
looking resentfully towards Elinor. "Not at all! I do <i>not</i>
agree with you!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Frank, you idiot, be quiet! Let me handle this," she
cried. Turning to the little Frenchman, she said swiftly,
smoothly, with all her coaxing and formidable persuasiveness:</p>

<p>"Monsieur, what can we do to remedy this regrettable
mistake?"</p>

<p>"Comment?" said the Frenchman, in a puzzled tone.</p>

<p>"Monsieur Starwick," Elinor went on with coaxing persuasion,
"--Monsieur Starwick--comme vous voyez, monsieur--est tr&egrave;s
jeune. Il a toutes les fautes de la jeunesse. Mais il est aussi
un homme de grand esprit; de grand talent. Il a le
temp&eacute;rament d'un artiste: d'un homme de g&eacute;nie.
Comme un Fran&ccedil;ais, monsieur, vous," she went on
flatteringly "--<i>vous</i> connaissez cette esp&egrave;ce
d'hommes. Vous savez qu'ils ne sont pas toujours responsables de
leurs actes. C'est comme &ccedil;a avec Monsieur Starwick. Il est
de bonne c&oelig;ur, de bonne volont&eacute;: il est
honn&ecirc;te, g&eacute;n&eacute;reux et sinc&egrave;re, mais il
est aussi plein de temp&eacute;rament--impulsif:--il manque de
jugement. Hier soir nous avons tous--comme on dit--fait la noce
ensemble. Monsieur Starwick a bu beaucoup--a bu trop--et il a
&eacute;t&eacute; coupable d'une chose regrettable. Mais
aujourd'hui il se repent tr&egrave;s sinc&egrave;rement de sa
conduite.</p>

<p>"Il vous offre ses apologies les plus profondes. Il a
d&eacute;j&agrave; souffert assez. Dans ces circonstances,
monsieur," she concluded, with an air of charming persuasiveness,
"on peut excuser le jeune homme, n'est-ce pas?--on peut pardonner
une faute si honn&ecirc;tement et sinc&egrave;rement
regrett&eacute;e."</p>

<p>And she paused, smiling at him with an air of hopeful
finality, as if to say: "There! You agree with me, don't you? I
knew you would!"</p>

<p>But the Frenchman was not to be so easily persuaded. Waving
thin fingers sideways in the air, and shaking his head without
conviction, he laughed a dry, dubious laugh, and said:</p>

<p>"Ah-h! I don't know--mademoiselle! Zese apologies!--"--again
he waved thin dubious fingers--"eet ees all ver-ree well to meck
apologies bot ze--vat you say?--ze dom-mage!--ze dom-mage is
done. . . . Monsieur," he said gravely, turning to Starwick, "you
have been coupable of a ver-ree gret offence. Ze--ze--vat you
say?--<i>ze assault,</i> monsieur--ze assault ees 'ere in
France--une chose tr&egrave;s s&eacute;rieuse! Vous
comprenez?"</p>

<p>"Ace," said Starwick coldly.</p>

<p>"Mon client," the little Frenchman cleared his throat
portentously--"--mon client, Monsieur Reynal, 'as been
terriblement bless&eacute;--insult&eacute;! monsieur!" he cried
sharply. "Eeet ees necessaree zu meck des r&eacute;parations,
n'est-ce pas?"</p>

<p>"Ace," said Starwick coldly. "Whatever reparation you
desire."</p>

<p>The Frenchman stared at him a moment in an astonished way and
then, in an excited and eager tone, cried:</p>

<p>"Ah, bon! Zen you agree?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly," said Starwick.</p>

<p>"Bon! Bon!" the little man said eagerly, rubbing his hands
together with greedy satisfaction. "Monsieur est sage--ees, vat
you say?--ees ver-ree wise. Monsieur est
Am&eacute;ricain--n'est-ce pas?--un &eacute;tranger--comme vous,
mademoiselle . . . et vous, monsieur . . . et vous,
mademoiselle--you are 'ere zu meck ze tour--zu be
libre--free--n'est-ce pas--zu avoid ze complications--"</p>

<p>"But," said Elinor, in a bewildered tone, "--what is--I don't
understand--"</p>

<p>"Alors," the Frenchman said, "eet ees bettaire to avoid ze
complications--oui! Ah," he said, with an arching glance at
Starwick, "mais Monsieur est sage . . . est tr&egrave;s,
tr&egrave;s sage! C'est toujours mieux de faire des
r&eacute;parations . . . et &eacute;viter les cons&eacute;quences
plus s&eacute;rieuses."</p>

<p>"But!" cried Elinor again, her astonishment growing, "I don't
understand. What reparations are you talking about?"</p>

<p>"Zese, madame!" the Frenchman said, and coughing portentously,
he rattled the flimsy sheets of paper in his hand, held them up
before his eyes, and began to read:</p>

<p>"Pour l'endommagement d'un veston du soir--trois cents
francs!"</p>

<p>"What? <i>What?"</i> said Elinor in a small, chilled tone.
"For--<i>what?"</i></p>

<p>"Mais oui, madame!" the Frenchman now cried passionately, for
the first time rising to the heights of moral indignation, "--un
veston du soir complet--ruin&eacute;,
madame!--<i>compl&egrave;tement, absolument</i> ruin&eacute;! . .
. Trois cents francs, monsieur," he said cunningly, turning to
Starwick, "--c'est pas cher! . . . Pour moi, oui!--c'est
cher--mais pour vous--ah-h!" he waved his dirty fingers and
laughed with scornful deprecation, "--c'est rien! Rien du tout."
He rattled the flimsy paper in his hands, cleared his throat, and
went on:</p>

<p>"Pour l'endommagement d'une chemise--une chemise, n'est-ce
pas, du soir?" he looked up inquiringly, "--cinquante
francs"--</p>

<p>"But this," gasped Elinor, "this is--" She looked at Starwick
with an astounded face. Starwick said nothing.</p>

<p>"Pour l'angoisse mentale," the Frenchman continued.</p>

<p>"What?" Elinor gasped and looked at Ann. "What did he
say?"</p>

<p>"Mental anguish," Ann answered curtly. "All right," she turned
to the Frenchman, "how much is the mental anguish?"</p>

<p>"C'est cinq cents francs, mademoiselle."</p>

<p>"But this man?" cried Elinor, turning to Ann with an air of
astounded enlightenment--"this man is--"</p>

<p>"He's a shyster lawyer, yes!" Ann said bitterly. "Couldn't you
see it from the first?"</p>

<p>"Ah, mademoiselle,"--the Frenchman began with a reproachful
grimace, and a little, deprecating movement of his fingers,
"--you are--"</p>

<p>"How much?" Ann answered in her level, toneless French. "How
much do you want?"</p>

<p>"Vous comprenez, mademoiselle--"</p>

<p>"How much?" she said harshly. "How much do you want?"</p>

<p>His furtive eyes gleamed with a sudden fox-glint of eager
greed.</p>

<p>"Mille francs!" he said eagerly. "Mille francs pour tout
ensemble! . . . Pour vous, mademoiselle"--he laughed again with
scornful deprecation as he waved his grimy angers--"c'est
rien--pour moi--"</p>

<p>She got up abruptly, went over to the shelf that ran around
the wall and got her purse. She opened it, took out a roll of
bills, and coming back tossed them on the table before him.</p>

<p>"But mademoiselle"--he stammered, unable to believe his good
luck, his eyes glued upon the roll of bills in a stare of
hypnotic fascination.</p>

<p>"Give me a receipt," she said.</p>

<p>"Comment?" he looked puzzled for a moment, then cried, "Ah-h!
Un re&ccedil;u! Mais oui, mais oui, mademoiselle! Tout de
suite!"</p>

<p>Trembling with frantic haste he scrawled out a receipt on a
sheet of yellow paper, gave it to her, clutched the banknotes
with a trembling claw, and stuffed them in his wallet.</p>

<p>"Now get out," said Ann.</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle?" he scrambled hastily to his feet, clutched his
briefcase and his hat, and looked nervously at her--"vous
dites?"</p>

<p>"Get out of here," she said, and began to move slowly towards
him.</p>

<p>He scrambled for the door like a frightened cat,
stammering:</p>

<p>"Mais oui . . . mais parfaitement . . . mais"--he almost
stumbled going down the steps, glancing back with nervous
apprehension as he went. She shut the door behind him, came back,
sat down in her chair, and stared sullenly at her plate, saying
nothing. Starwick was crimson in the face, but did not look at
anyone and did not speak. Elinor was busy with her napkin: she
had lifted it to her face and was holding it firmly across her
mouth. From time to time her breast and stomach and her heavy
shoulders trembled in a kind of shuddering convulsion, smothered
and explosive snorts and gasps came from her.</p>

<p>It got too much for her: they heard a faint, choked shriek,
she rose and rushed blindly across the room, entered the bathroom
and slammed the door behind her. And then they heard peal after
peal of laughter, shrieks and whoops and yells of it, and finally
a dead silence, broken at times by exhausted gasps. Ann continued
to look sullenly and miserably at her plate. As for Starwick, he
sat there wearily detached, impassive, magnificent as always, but
his face had the hue and colour of boiled lobster.</p>

<h1>LXXXII</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>One night, in a small bar or <i>bistro</i> upon the hill of
Montmartre, Starwick met a young Frenchman who was to become the
companion of his adventures in many strange and devious ways
thereafter. It was about four o'clock in the morning: after the
usual nightly circuit of the gilded pleasure resorts,
caf&eacute;s and more unsavoury dives and stews of the district,
Starwick had become very drunk and unruly, had quarrelled with
Elinor and Ann when they tried to take him home, and since that
time had been wandering aimlessly through the district, going
from one cheap bar to another.</p>

<p>The women hung on doggedly; Starwick had refused to let them
accompany him, and they had asked Eugene to stay with him and try
to keep him out of trouble. Eugene, in fact, was only less drunk
than his companion, but fortified by that sense of pride and duty
which a trust imposed by two lovely women can give a young man,
he hung on, keeping pace with Starwick, drink for drink, until
the whole night fused into a drunken blur, a rout of evil faces,
the whole to be remembered later as jags of splintered light upon
a chain of darkness, as flying images, fixed, instant, and
intolerably bright, in the great blank of memory. And out of all
these blazing pictures of the night and the wild reel of their
debauch, one would remain for ever after to haunt his vision
mournfully. It was the memory--or rather the
<i>consciousness</i>--of the two women, Ann and Elinor, waiting
in the dark, following the blind weave of their drunken path, all
through the mad kaleidoscope of night, never approaching them,
but always there. He had not seemed to look at them, to notice
them, and yet later he had always known that they were there. And
the memory fused to one final mournful image that was to return a
thousand times to haunt him in the years to come. He and Starwick
had come out of one of the bars that broke the darkness of the
long steep hill, and were reeling down past shuttered stores and
old dark houses towards the invitation of another blaze of
light.</p>

<p>Suddenly he knew that Ann and Elinor were behind them. For a
moment he turned, and saw the two women pacing slowly after them,
alone, patient, curiously enduring. The image of that long silent
street of night, walled steeply with old houses and shuttered
shops, and of the figures of these two women pacing slowly behind
them, in the darkness, seemed in later years to bear the
sorrowful legend of what their lives--of what so much of
life--was to become. And for this reason it burned for ever in
his memory with a mournful, dark and haunting radiance, became,
in fact, detached from names and personalities and identic
histories--became something essential, everlasting and immutable
in life. It was an image of fruitless love and lost devotion, of
a love that would never come to anything, and of beautiful life
that must be ruinously consumed in barren adoration of a lost
soul, a cold and unresponding heart. And it was all wrought
mournfully there into the scheme of night, made legible in the
quiet and gracious loveliness of these two women, so strong, so
patient, and so infinitely loyal, pacing slowly down behind two
drunken boys in the slant steep street and emptiness of
night.</p>

<p>Suddenly the image blazed to the structure of hard actuality:
another bar, and all around hoarse laughter, high sanguinary
voices, a sudden scheme of faces scarred with night, and vivid
with night's radiance--prostitutes, taxi-drivers, negroes, and
those other nameless unmistakable ones--who come from
somewhere--God knows where--and who live somehow--God knows
how--and who recede again at morning into unknown cells--but who
live here only, brief as moths, and balefully as a serpent's eye,
in the unwholesome chemistry of night.</p>

<p>He found himself leaning heavily on the zinc counter of the
bar, staring at a pair of whited, flabby-looking arms, the soiled
apron and shirt, the soiled night-time face and dark, mistrustful
eyes of night's soiled barman. The blur of hoarse voices, shouts
and oaths and laughter fused around him, and suddenly beside him
he heard Starwick's voice, drunken, quiet, and immensely
still.</p>

<p>"Monsieur," it said--its very stillness cut like a knife
through all the fog of sound about him--"monsieur, du feu, s'il
vous pla&icirc;t."</p>

<p>"But sairtainlee, monsieur," a droll and pleasant-sounding
voice said quietly. "W'y not?"</p>

<p>He turned and saw Starwick, a cigarette between his lips,
bending awkwardly to get the light from a proffered cigarette
which a young Frenchman was holding carefully for him. At last he
got it; puffing awkwardly, and straightening, he slightly raised
his hat in salutation, and said with drunken gravity:</p>

<p>"Merci. Vous &ecirc;tes bien gentil."</p>

<p>"But," said the young Frenchman again, drolly, and with a
slight shrug of his shoulder, "not at all! Eet ees noz-zing!"</p>

<p>And as Starwick started to look at him with grave drunken
eyes, the Frenchman returned his look with a glance that was
perfectly composed, friendly, good-humoured, and drolly
inquiring.</p>

<p>"Monsieur?" he said courteously, as Starwick continued to look
at him.</p>

<p>"I think," said Starwick slowly, with the strangely mannered
and almost womanish intonation in his voice, "I think I like you
<i>very</i> much. You are <i>very</i> kind, and <i>very</i>
generous, and altogether a <i>very</i> grand person. I am
<i>enormously</i> grateful to you."</p>

<p>"But," the Frenchman said, with droll surprise, and a slight
astonished movement of his shoulders, "I 'ave done noz-zing! You
ask for du feu--a light--and I geev to you. I am glad eef you
like--bot--" again he shrugged his shoulders with a cynical but
immensely engaging humour--"eet ees not so ver-ree grand."</p>

<p>He was a young man, not more than thirty years old, somewhat
above middle height, with a thin, nervously active figure, and
thin, pointedly Gallic features. It was a pleasant, most engaging
face, full of a sharply cynical intelligence; the thin mouth was
alive with humour--with the witty and politely cynical disbelief
of his race, and his tone, his manner--everything about him--was
eloquent with this racial quality of disbelief, a quality that
was perfectly courteous, that would raise its pointed eyebrows
and say politely, "You s'ink so"--but that accepted without
assent, was politely non-committal without agreement.</p>

<p>He was dressed as many young Frenchmen of that period
dressed:--a style that served to combine the sinister toughness
of the Apache with a rather gaudy and cheap enhancement of the
current fashions. His clothes were neat but cheaply made; he wore
a felt hat with a wide brim, creased, French fashion, up the
sides, an overcoat with padded shoulders, cut in sharply at the
waist, his trousers had a short and skimpy look, and barely
covered the tops of his shoes. He wore spats, and a rather
loud-coloured scarf which he knotted loosely, cravat-fashion, and
which thus concealed his collar and his shirt. Finally, when he
smoked a cigarette, he drew the smoke in slowly, languorously,
knowingly, with lidded eyes, and a cruel and bitter convulsion of
his thin lips that gave his sharp face a sinister Apache
expression.</p>

<p>Starwick was now crying out in a high drunken tone of
passionate assurance:</p>

<p>"But yes! Yes! Yes!--You are a <i>grand</i> person--a
<i>swell</i> person--I like you <i>enormously. . . ."</i></p>

<p>"I am glad," said the Frenchman politely, with another almost
imperceptible movement of the shoulders.</p>

<p>"But yes! You are my friend!" Starwick cried in a high
passionate tone. "I like you--you must drink with me."</p>

<p>"Eef you like--of course!" the Frenchman politely agreed.
Turning to the soiled barman who continued to look at them with
dark mistrustful eyes, he said, in a hard, sharp voice, "Une
fine. . . . And you, monsieur?" he turned inquiringly toward
Eugene, "I s'ink you have another drink?"</p>

<p>"No, not now"--his glass was not yet empty. "We--we have both
already had something to drink."</p>

<p>"I can see," the Frenchman said politely, but with a swift
flicker of cynical mirth across his thin mouth, that needed no
translation. Raising his glass, he said courteously:</p>

<p>"A votre sant&eacute;, messieurs," and drank.</p>

<p>"Look!" cried Starwick. "You are our friend now, and you must
call us by our names. My name is Frank; his is Eugene--what is
yours?"</p>

<p>"My name ees Alec," said the young Frenchman smiling. "Zat ees
w'at zey call me."</p>

<p>"But it's perfect!" Starwick cried enthusiastically. "It's a
<i>swell</i> name--a <i>wonderful</i> name! Alec!--Ecoute!" he
said to the soiled barman with the ugly eye, "Juh pawnse qu'il
faut--encore du cognac," he said drunkenly, making a confused and
maudlin gesture with his arm. "Encore du cognac, s'il vous
pla&icirc;t!" And as the barman silently and sullenly filled the
three glasses from a bottle on the bar, Starwick turned to Alec,
shouting with dangerous hilarity: "Cognac for ever, Alec,
Alec!--Cognac for you and me and all of us for ever!--Nothing but
drunkenness--glorious drunkenness--divine poetic drunkenness for
ever!"</p>

<p>"Eef you like," said Alec, with a polite and acquiescent
shrug. He raised his glass and drank.</p>

<p>It was four o'clock when they left the place. Arm in arm they
reeled out into the street, Starwick holding on to Alec for
support and shouting drunkenly:</p>

<p>"Nous sommes des amis!--Nous sommes des amis &eacute;ternels!
Mais oui! Mais oui!"</p>

<p>The whole dark and silent street rang and echoed with his
drunken outcry. "Alec et moi--nous sommes des fr&egrave;res--nous
sommes des artistes! Nothing shall part us! Non--jamais!
Jamais!"</p>

<p>A taxi, which had been waiting in the darkness several doors
away, now drove up swiftly and stopped before them at the kerb.
Ann and Elinor were inside: Elinor opened the door and spoke
gently:</p>

<p>"Frank, get in the taxi now, we're going home."</p>

<p>"Mais jamais! Jamais!" Starwick yelled hysterically. "I go
nowhere without Alec!--We are brothers--friends--he has a poet's
soul."</p>

<p>"Frank, don't be an idiot!" Elinor spoke quietly, but with
crisp authority. "You're drunk; get in the taxi; we're going
home."</p>

<p>"Mais oui!" he shouted. "Je suis ivre! I am drunk! I will
always be drunk--nothing but drunkenness for ever for Alec and
me!"</p>

<p>"Listen!" Elinor spoke quietly, pleasantly to the Frenchman.
"Won't you go away, please, and leave him now? He is drunk, he
does not know what he is doing; he really must go home now."</p>

<p>"But, of course, madame," said Alec courteously, "I go now."
He turned to Starwick and spoke quietly, with his thin, engaging
smile: "I s'ink, Frank, eet ees bettaire eef you go home now,
non?"</p>

<p>"But no! But no!" cried Starwick passionately. "I will go
nowhere without Alec. . . . Alec!" he cried, clutching him with
drunken desperation. "You cannot go! You must not go! You cannot
leave me!"</p>

<p>"Tomorrow, perhaps," said Alec, smiling. "Ees eet not bettaire
eef we go to-gezzer tomorrow?--I s'ink zen you feel motch
bettaire."</p>

<p>"No! No!" Starwick cried obstinately. "Now! Now! Alec, you
cannot leave me! We are brothers, we must tell each other
everything. . . . You must show me all you know, all you have
seen--you must teach me to smoke opium--take me where the
opium-smokers go--Alec! Alec! J'ai la nostalgic pour la boue. . .
."</p>

<p>"Oh, Frank, quit talking like a drunken idiot! Get in the car,
we're going home. . . ."</p>

<p>"But no! But no!" Starwick raved on in his high drunken voice.
"Alec and I are going on together--he has promised to take me to
the places that he knows--to show me the dark mysteries--the
lower depths. . . ."</p>

<p>"Oh, Frank, for God's sake get in the car; you're making a
damned fool of yourself!"</p>

<p>"--But no! I will not go without Alec--he must come with
us--he is going to show me. . . ."</p>

<p>"But I show you, Frank," said Alec smoothly. "Tonight, non!"
He spoke firmly, waved a hand. "Eet ees impossible. I wet 'ere
for someone. I must meet, I 'ave engagement--yes. Tomorrow, eef
you like, I meet you 'ere! Tonight, non!" His voice was harsh,
sharp with irrevocable refusal. "I cannot. Eet ees
impossible."</p>

<p>By dint of infinite prayers and persuasions, and by Alec's
promises that he would meet him next day to take him on a tour of
"the lower depths," they finally got Starwick into the taxi. All
the way down the hill, however, as the taxi sped across Paris,
through the darkened silent streets, and across the Seine into
the Latin Quarter, Starwick raved on madly about his eternal
friendship with Alec, from whom he could never more be parted.
The taxi turned swiftly into the dark and empty little Rue des
Beaux-Arts and halted before Eugene's hotel. The two women waited
in nervous and impatient haste for Eugene to get out, Elinor
giving his arm a swift squeeze and saying:</p>

<p>"Good night, darling. We'll see you tomorrow morning. Don't
forget our trip to Rheims."</p>

<p>When he got out, however, Starwick followed him, and began to
run drunkenly towards the corner, smashing at the shutters of the
shops with his cane and screaming at the top of his voice:</p>

<p>"Alec! Alec! O&ugrave; est Alec? Alec! Alec! Mon ami Alec!
O&ugrave; &ecirc;tes-vous?"</p>

<p>Eugene ran after Starwick and caught him just as he was
disappearing round the corner into the Rue Bonaparte, headed for
the Seine. By main strength and pleading he brought him back, and
managed to get him into the taxi again, which had followed his
pursuit in swift watchful reverse. He slammed the door upon that
raving madman, and as the taxi drove off he heard, through a fog
of drunkenness, Elinor's swift "Thank you, darling. You behaved
magnificently--tomorrow--" and Starwick raving:</p>

<p>"Alec! Alec! Where is Alec?"</p>

<p>They sped off up the silent empty street, a narrow ribbon lit
sparsely by a few lamps, and walled steeply with its high old
shuttered houses. Eugene walked back to his hotel, rang the night
bell, and was let in. As he stumbled up the circuitous and
perilous ascent of five flights, he caught a moment's glimpse of
the little concierge and his wife, startled from their
distressful sleep, clutching each other together in a protective
embrace, as they peered out at him from the miserable little
alcove where they slept--a moment's vision of their pale, meagre
faces and frightened eyes.</p>

<p>He climbed the winding flights of stairs, and let himself into
his room, switching on the light, and flinging himself down upon
the bed immediately in a stupor of drunken exhaustion.</p>

<p>It seemed to him he had not lain there five minutes before he
heard Starwick smashing at the street door below, and shouting
drunkenly his own name and that of Alec. In another minute he
heard Starwick stumbling up the stairs; he went to the door,
opened it, and caught him just as he came stumbling in. Starwick
was raving, demented, no longer conscious of his acts: he began
to smash and beat at the bed with his stick, crying:</p>

<p>"There!--And there!--And there!--Out, out, damned spot, and
make an end to you. . . . The stranger--the one I never knew--the
stranger you have become--out! Out! Out!"</p>

<p>Turning to Eugene then, he peered at him with drunken
bloodshot eyes, and said:</p>

<p>"Who are you?--Are you the stranger?--Are you the one I never
knew?--Or are you . . . ?" His voice trailed off feebly, and he
sank down into a chair, sobbing drunkenly.</p>

<p>And getting to his feet at length he looked about him wildly,
smote the bed again with his stick, and cried out loudly:</p>

<p>"Where is Eugene? Where is the Eugene that I
knew?--Where?--Where?--Where?" He staggered to the door and flung
it open, screaming: "Alec! Where are you?"</p>

<p>He reeled out into the hall, and for a moment hung dangerously
against the stair rail, peering drunkenly down into the dizzy pit
five flights below. Eugene ran after him, seized him by the arm
and, together, they fell or reeled to the bottom. It was a
journey as distorted and demented as a dream--a descent to be
remembered later as a kind of corkscrew nightmare, broken by
blind lurchings into a creaking rail, by the rattling of
Starwick's stick upon the banisters, by blind sprawls, and
stumblings, and by blobs and blurs of frightened faces at each
landing, where Monsieur Gely's more sober patrons waited in
breath-caught silence at their open doors. They reached the
bottom finally amid such universal thanksgiving, such prayers for
their safety, as Gely's hotel had never known before.</p>

<p>A vast sigh, a huge and single respiration of relief rustled
up the steep dark pit of the winding stairs. But another peril
lay before them. At the foot of the stairs there stood a
monstrous five-foot vase which, by its lustre and the loving care
with which it was polished every day by Marie, the maid, must
have been the pride of the establishment. Starwick reeled blindly
against it as he went past, the thing rocked sickeningly, and
even as it tottered slowly over, Eugene heard Madame Gely's gasp
of terror, heard her low "Mon Dieu! Ca tombe, &ccedil;a tombe!"
and a loud united "Ah-h-h!" of thankfulness as he caught it in
his hands, and gently, safely, with such inner triumph as a man
may feel who leaps through space and lands safely hanging to a
flying trapeze, restored it to its former position. As he looked
up he saw old Gely and his wife peering from their quarters with
fat perturbed faces, and the little concierge and his wife still
clutched together, peering through their curtains in a covert of
bright frightened eyes.</p>

<p>They got out into the street at last. In the Rue Bonaparte
they stopped a taxi drilling through. When they reached
Montmartre again the night was breaking in grey light behind the
Church of Sacr&eacute;-C&oelig;ur. After further drinks of strong
bad cognac, they piled out of the place into another taxi, and
went hurtling back through Paris. By the time they arrived at the
studio full light had come.</p>

<p>The women were waiting up for them. Starwick mumbled something
and, holding his hand over his mouth, rushed across the room into
the bathroom and vomited. When he was empty, he staggered out,
reeled towards the couch where Ann slept, and toppled on it, and
was instantly sunk in senseless sleep.</p>

<p>Elinor regarded him for a while with an air at once
contemplative and amused. "And now," she said cheerfully, "to
awake the Sleeping Beauty from his nap." She smiled her fine
bright smile, but the lines about her mouth were grimly set, and
her eyes were hard. She approached the couch, and looking down
upon Starwick's prostrate and bedraggled form, she said sweetly:
"Get up, darling. It's breakfast-time."</p>

<p>He groaned feebly and rolled over on his side.</p>

<p>"Up, up, up, my lamb!" Her tone was dulcet, but the hand that
grasped his collar and pulled him to a sitting position was by no
means gentle. "We are waiting for you, darling. The day's at
morn, the hour draws close, it's almost time. Remember, dear,
we're starting out for Rheims at nine o'clock."</p>

<p>"Oh, God!" groaned Starwick wretchedly. "Don't ask me to do
that! Anything, anything but that. I can't! I'll go anywhere with
you if you just leave me alone until tomorrow." He flopped back
on the bed again.</p>

<p>"Sorry, precious," she said in a light and cheerful tone, as
hard as granite, "but it's too late now! You should have thought
of that before. Our plans are made, we're going--and <i>you</i>,"
suddenly her voice hardened formidably, <i>"you're</i> coming
with us." She looked at him a moment longer with hard eyes, bent
and grasped him by the collar, and roughly jerked him up to a
sitting position again.</p>

<p>"Francis," she said sternly, "pull yourself together now and
get up! We're going to have no more of this nonsense!"</p>

<p>He groaned feebly and staggered to his feet. He seemed to be
on the verge of collapse, his appearance was so pitiable that
Ann, coming from the bathroom at this moment, flushed with hot
sympathy as she saw him, and cried out angrily, accusingly, to
Elinor:</p>

<p>"Oh, leave him alone! Let him sleep if he wants to. Can't you
see he is half dead? Why should we drag him along to Rheims if he
doesn't feel like going? We can put the trip off until tomorrow,
anyway. What does it matter when we go?"</p>

<p>Elinor smiled firmly and shook her head with a short
inflexible movement. "No, sir," she said quietly. "Nothing is
going to be put off. We are going today, as we planned. And Mr.
Starwick is going with us! He may go willingly or against his
will, he may be conscious or unconscious when he gets there, but,
alive or dead, he's going!"</p>

<p>At these unhappy tidings, Starwick groaned miserably again.
She turned to him and, her voice deepening to the authority of
indignation, she said:</p>

<p>"Frank! You've <i>got</i> to see this through! There's no
getting out of it now! If you don't feel well, that's just too
bad--but you've got to see this thing through, anyway! You've
known about this trip for the past week--if you chose to spend
last night making the rounds of every joint in Montmartre you've
no one to blame for it but yourself! But you've <i>got</i> to go.
You're not going to let us down this time!"</p>

<p>And steeled and wakened by the challenge of her tone--that
challenge which one meets so often in people who have let their
whole life go to hell, and lacking stamina for life's larger
consequences insist on it for trivialities--he raised his head,
looked at her with angry, bloodshot eyes, and said quietly:</p>

<p>"Very well, I'll go. But I resent your asking it <i>very</i>
much!"</p>

<p>"All right, my dear," she said quietly. "If you resent it, you
resent it--and that's that! Only, when you make a promise to your
friends they expect you to live up to it."</p>

<p>"Ace," said Starwick coldly. "Quite."</p>

<p>"And now," she spoke more kindly, "why don't you go into the
bathroom, Frank, and straighten up a bit? A little cold water
across your head and shoulders would do you no end of good." She
turned to Ann and said quietly: "Did you finish in there?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Ann curtly, "it's all right now. I've cleaned it
up." For a minute she stared sullenly at the older woman, and
suddenly burst into her short and angry laugh:</p>

<p>"God!" she said, with a rich, abrupt, and beautifully coarse
humanity. "I never saw the like of it in my life! I don't see
where he put it all!" Her voice trembled with a full, rich,
infuriated kind of humour. "Everything was there!" she cried,
"except the kitchen sink!"</p>

<p>Starwick flushed deeply, and looking at her, said, quietly,
gravely: "I'm sorry, Ann. I'm <i>terribly, terribly</i>
sorry!"</p>

<p>"Oh, it's all right," she said shortly, yet with a kind of
tenderness. "I'm used to it. Don't forget that I served three
years' training in a hospital once. You get so you don't notice
those things."</p>

<p>"You are a <i>very</i> swell person," he said slowly and
distinctly. "I'm <i>terribly</i> grateful."</p>

<p>She flushed and turned away, saying curtly: "Sit down, Frank.
You'll feel better when you have some coffee. I'm making it now."
And in her silent and competent way she set to work.</p>

<p>In these few commonplace words all that was strong, grand, and
tender in Ann's soul and character was somehow made evident.
Brusque and matter of fact as her words had been when she
referred to the disgusting task just performed, their very
curtness, and the rich and coarse humanity of her sudden angry
laugh, had revealed a spirit of noble tenderness and strength, a
spirit so strong and sweet and full of love that it had risen
triumphant not only over the stale, dead and snobbish little
world from which she came, but also over the squeamishness which
such a task would have aroused in most of the people who made up
that world.</p>

<p>To Starwick, she symbolized certain divinities known to his
art and his experience: Maya, or one of the great Earth-Mothers
of the ancients, or the goddess of Compassionate Mercy of the
Chinese, to whom he often likened her.</p>

<p>But to the other youth, her divinity was less mythical, more
racial and mundane. She seemed to fulfil in part his vision of
the grand America, to make palpable the female quality of that
fortunate, good, and happy life of which he had dreamed since
childhood--to evoke the structure of that enchanted life of which
every American has dreamed as a child. It is a life that seems
for ever just a hand's-breadth off and instantly to be grasped
and made our own, the moment that we find the word to utter it,
the key to open it. It is a world distilled of our own blood and
earth, and qualified by all our million lights and weathers, and
we know that it will be noble, intolerably strange and lovely,
when we find it. Finally, she was the incarnation of all the
secret beauty of New England, the other side of man's dark heart,
the buried loveliness that all men long for.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The car which they had chartered for a four months' tour was
brought round from a garage at nine o'clock. A few minutes later
they were on their way to Rheims.</p>

<p>Elinor drove; Eugene sat beside her; Ann and Starwick were in
the rear seat. The car was a good one--a Panhard--and Elinor
drove swiftly, beautifully, with magnificent competence, as she
did all things, getting ahead of everybody else, besting even the
swerve of the taxi-drivers in their wasp-like flight, and doing
it all with such smooth ease that no one noticed it.</p>

<p>They seemed to get through the great dense web, the monumental
complication of central Paris by a kind of magic. As always,
Elinor communicated to everyone and everything the superb
confidence of her authority. In her presence, and under her
governance, the strange and alien world about them became
instantly familiar as the Main Street of one's native town,
making even the bewildering and intricate confusion of its
swarming mass wonderfully natural and easy to be grasped. Paris,
in fact, under the transforming magic of this woman's touch,
became curiously American, the enchantment beautifully like
Eugene's own far-off visions as a child.</p>

<p>It was astounding. The whole city had suddenly taken on the
clear and unperplexing proportions of a map--of one of those
beautifully simple and comforting maps which are sold to
tourists, in which everything is charming, colourful, and cosy as
a toy, and where everything that need be known--all the
celebrated "points of interest"--the Eiffel Tower, the Madeleine,
and Notre Dame, the Trocad&eacute;ro, and the Arc de Triomphe,
are pictured charmingly, in vivid colours.</p>

<p>Paris, in fact, had this morning become a brilliant, lovely,
flashing toy. It was a toy which had been miraculously created
for the enjoyment of brilliant, knowing and sophisticated
Americans like Elinor and himself. It was a toy which could be
instantly understood, preserved and enjoyed, a toy that they
could play with to their hearts' content, a toy which need
confuse and puzzle none of them for a moment, particularly since
Elinor was there to explain the toy and make it go.</p>

<p>It was incredible. Gone was all the blind confusion, the sick
despair, the empty desolation of his first month in Paris. Gone
was the old blind and baffled struggle against the staggering
mass and number of a world too infinitely complex to be
comprehended, too strange and alien to be understood. Gone were
all the old sensations of the drowning horror, the feeling of
atomic desolation as he blindly prowled the streets among alien
and uncountable hordes of strange dark faces, the sensation of
being an eyeless grope-thing that crawled and scuttled blindly on
the sea-depths of some terrible oceanic world of whose
dimensions, structure, quality and purpose it could know nothing.
Gone were all those feelings of strife, profitless, strange and
impotent futility--those struggles that wracked the living sinews
of man's life and soul with quivering exhaustion and with sick
despair, the hideous feeling of being emptied out in planetary
vacancy, of losing all the high hope of the spirit's purpose, the
heart's integrity--of being exploded, emptied out and dissipated
into hideous, hopeless nothingness where all the spirit of man's
courage turned dead and rotten as a last year's apple, and all
his sounding plans of work and greatness seemed feebler than the
scratchings of a dog upon a wall--a horror that can seize a man
in the great jungle of an unknown city and a swarming street and
that is far more terrible than the unknown mystery of any
Amazonian jungle of the earth could be.</p>

<p>It was all gone now--the devouring hunger, and the drowning
horror, and the blind confusion of the old, swarm-haunted mind of
man--the fruitless struggle of the Faustian life--and in its
place he had the glittering toy, the toy of legend and
enchantment and of quick possession.</p>

<p>The French, they were a charming race--so gay, so light, and
so incorrigible--so childlike and so like a race of charming
toys.</p>

<p>Elinor made their relation to all these good people swarming
in the streets around them wonderfully easy, dear, and agreeable.
There was nothing strange about them, their ways were
unpredictable, since they were French, but they were perfectly
understandable. Her attitude, expressed in a rapid, gay and
half-abstracted chatter--a kind of running commentary on the life
around her as she drove--made the whole thing plain. They were a
quaint lot, a droll lot, an incomparable lot--they were charming,
amazing, irresponsible, a race of toys and children--they were
"French."</p>

<p>"All right, my dear," she would murmur to herself as a fat
taxi-driver snaked recklessly in ahead of her and came to a
triumphant stop--"have it your own way, my darling--have it your
own way--I shan't argue with you--God!" she would cry, throwing
her head back with a sudden rich burst of laughter--"look at the
old boy with the whiskers over there at the table--did you see
him twirl his gay moustachios and roll his roguish eyes at that
girl as she went by? <i>Simply</i> incredible!" she cried with
another laugh, and bit her lips, and shook her head in fine
astonishment. "Thank you!" she murmured politely, as the gendarme
shrilled upon his whistle and beckoned with his small white club.
"Monsieur l'Agent, vous &ecirc;tes bien gentil"--as she smoothly
shifted gears and shot past him.</p>

<p>In this wonderful and intoxicating way all of Paris defiled
past them like a great glittering toy, a splendid map of rich,
luxurious shops and great caf&eacute;s, an animated and beautiful
design of a million gay and fascinating people, all bent on
pleasure, all filled with joy, all with something so vivid,
bright, particular and incomparable about them that the whole
vast pattern resolved itself into a thousand charming and
brilliant pictures, each wonderful and unforgettable, and all
fitting instantly into the single structure, the simple and
magnificent clarity of the whole design.</p>

<p>They swept through the huge central web of Paris, and were
passing through the great shabby complication of the Eastern
Quarters, the ragged, ugly sprawl of the suburbs.</p>

<p>And now, swift as dreams, it seemed, they were out in open
country, speeding along roads shaded by tall rows of poplars,
under a sky of humid grey, whitened with a milky and
soul-troubling light.</p>

<p>Elinor was very gay, mercurial, full of sudden spontaneous
laughter, snatches of song, deep gravity, swift inexplicable
delight. Ann maintained a sullen silence. As for Starwick, he
seemed on the verge of collapse all the time. At
Ch&acirc;teau-Thierry he announced that he could go no farther:
they stopped, got him into a little caf&eacute;, and fortified
him with some brandy. He sank into a stupor of exhaustion, from
which they could not rouse him. To all their persuasions and
entreaties he just shook his head and mumbled wearily:</p>

<p>"I can't!--Leave me here!--I can't go on!"</p>

<p>Three hours passed in this way before they succeeded in
reviving him, getting him out of the caf&eacute;--or
estaminet--and into the car again. Ann's face was flushed with
resentful anger. She burst out furiously:</p>

<p>"You had no right to make him come along on this trip! You
knew he couldn't make it; he's dead on his feet. I think we ought
to take him back to Paris now."</p>

<p>"Sorry, my dear," said Elinor crisply, with a fine bright
smile, "but there'll be no turning back! We're going on!"</p>

<p>"Frank can't go on!" Ann cried angrily. "You know he can't! I
think it's a rotten shame for you to insist on this when you see
what shape he's in."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, we're going on," said Elinor with grim
cheerfulness. "And Mr. Starwick is going with us. He'll see it
through now to the bitter end. And if he dies upon the way, we'll
give him a soldier's burial here upon the field of honour. . . .
Allons, mes enfants! Avancez!" And humming gaily and lightly the
tune of Malbrouck, she shifted gears and sent the car smoothly,
swiftly forward again.</p>

<p>It was a horrible journey: one of those experiences which, by
the grim and hopeless protraction of their suffering, leave their
nightmare image indelibly upon the memories of everyone who has
experienced them. The grey light of the short winter's day was
already waning rapidly when they drove out of
Ch&acirc;teau-Thierry. As they approached Rheims dark had almost
come, the lights of the town had begun to twinkle, sparsely, with
provincial dismalness, in the distance. No one knew the purpose
of their visit; no one knew what the trip was for, what they were
coming to see--no one had enquired.</p>

<p>It was almost dark when they entered the town. Elinor drove
immediately to the cathedral, halted the car, and got out.</p>

<p>"Voil&agrave;, mes amis!" she said ironically. "We are
here!"</p>

<p>And she made a magnificent flourishing gesture towards the
great ruined mass, which, in the last faint grey light of day,
was dimly visible as a gigantic soaring monument of shattering
arches and demolished buttresses, a lacework of terrific stone
looped ruggedly with splinters of faint light, the demolished
fa&ccedil;ades of old saints and kings and shell-torn towers--the
twilight ruins of a twilight world.</p>

<p>"Magnificent!" cried Elinor enthusiastically. "Superb!--Frank!
Frank! You must get out and feast your eyes upon this noble
monument! I have heard you speak so often of its beauty. . . .
But, my dear, you <i>must!"</i> she said, answering with fine
persuasion his feeble and dispirited groan. "You'd never forgive
yourself, or me either, if you knew you'd come the whole way to
Rheims without a single look at its cathedral."</p>

<p>And, despite his wearily mumbled protests, she took him by the
arm and pulled him from the car. Then, for a moment, as he stared
drunkenly, with blind, unseeing eyes, at the great grey twilit
shape, she propped him up and held him between herself and
Eugene.</p>

<p>Then they all got back into the car, and she drove them to the
best caf&eacute;, the best hotel in town. Starwick almost
collapsed getting out of the car. His knees buckled under him,
and he would have fallen if Ann had not caught him, put her arm
round him and held him up. His condition was pitiable. He could
no longer hold his head up; it lolled and wobbled drunkenly on
his neck like a flower too heavy for its heavy stalk. His eyes
were glazed and leaden, and as they started into the caf&eacute;,
he had to be held up. He lifted his feet and dragged them after
him like leaden weights. The caf&eacute; was a large and splendid
one. They found a table to one side. Starwick staggered towards
the cushioned seat against the wall and immediately collapsed.
From that time on, he was never wholly conscious. Ann sat down
beside him, put her arm round him and supported him. He sank
against her shoulder like a child. The girl's face was flushed
with anger, she stared at Elinor with resentful eyes, but by no
word or gesture did Elinor show that she noticed anything amiss
either in Ann's or Starwick's behaviour.</p>

<p>Rather, she chatted gaily to Eugene, she kept up a witty and
high-spirited discourse with everyone around her, she had never
been more mercurial, quick, gay and charming than she was that
evening. And announcing gaily that she was the hostess that was
"giving the party," she ordered lavishly--a delicious meal, with
champagne from the celebrated cellars of the establishment. And
everyone, spurred to hunger by the cold air and their long
journey, ate heartily--everyone save Ann, who ate little and sat
in angry silence, with one arm round Starwick's shoulders, and
Starwick, who could not be roused from his deep stupor to eat
anything.</p>

<p>It was after nine o'clock before they got up to go. Elinor
paid the bill, and still chatting as gaily and as lightly as if
the whole wretched expedition had brought nothing but unqualified
joy to all her guests, started for the door. Starwick had to be
half-carried, half-dragged out by Ann and Eugene, under the
prayerful guidance of several deeply troubled waiters. They put
him in the car and got in themselves. Elinor, looking round
lightly and crying out cheerfully, "Are we ready, children?"
started the motor for the long drive back to Paris.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>That was a hideous and unforgettable journey. Before they were
done with it, they thought that it would never end. Under the
protraction of its ghastly horror, time lengthened out
interminably, unbelievably, into centuries. It seemed to them at
last that they would never arrive, that they were rolling through
a spaceless vacancy without progression, that they were hung
there in the horrible ethers of some planetary emptiness where
their wheels spun futilely and for ever in moveless movement,
unsilent silence, changeless change.</p>

<p>From the very beginning they did not know where they were
going. By the time they got out of Rheims they were completely
lost. It was a cold night, late in February; a thick fog-like
mist that grew steadily more impenetrable as the night wore on,
had come down and blanketed the earth in white invisibility. And
through this mist there were diffused two elements: the weird
radiance of a submerged moon which gave to the sea of fog through
which they groped the appearance of an endless sea of milk, and
the bitter clutch of a stealthy, raw, and cruelly penetrating
cold which crept into man's flesh and numbed him to the bone of
misery.</p>

<p>All through that ghastly and interminable night they groped
their way across France in the milky ocean of antarctic fog. It
seemed to them that they had travelled hundreds of miles, that
Paris had long since been passed, lost, forgotten in the fog,
that they were approaching the outer suburbs of Lyons or
Bordeaux, that presently they would see the comforting lights of
the English Channel or that they had turned northwards, had
crossed Belgium, and soon would strike the Rhine.</p>

<p>From time to time the road wound through the ghostly street of
some old village; the white walls of village houses rose sheer
and blank beside the road, sheeted in phantasmal mist like
ghosts, and with no sound within. Then they would be groping
their way out through the open countryside again--but where or in
what country, no one knew, none dared to say--and suddenly, low
and level, beside them to the left, they would see the moon. It
would suddenly emerge in some blind hole that opened in that wall
of fog, and it was such a moon as no man living ever saw before.
It was an old, mad, ruined crater of a moon, an ancient, worn,
and demented thing that smouldered red like an expiring coal, and
that was like the old ruined moon of a fantastic dream. It hung
there on their left, just at the edge of a low ridge of hills,
and it was so low, so level, and so ghostly-near, it seemed to
them that they could touch it.</p>

<p>Towards midnight they groped their way into a whited ghostly
phantom of a town which Elinor at length, with the sudden
recognition of a person who revisits some old scene of childhood,
discovered to be Soissons. She had known the town well during the
War: the ambulance unit, in which she had been for eighteen
months a driver, had been stationed here. Starwick was half
conscious, huddled into Ann's shoulder on the dark rear seat. He
groaned pitiably and said that he could go no farther, that they
must stop. They found a hotel caf&eacute; that was still open and
half-carried, half-dragged him in. They got brandy for him, they
tried to revive him; he looked like a dead man and said that he
could go no farther, that they must leave him there. And for the
first time Elinor's grave tone showed concern and sharp anxiety,
for the first time her hard eye softened into care. She remained
firm; gently, obdurately, she refused him. He collapsed again
into unconsciousness; she turned her worried eyes upon the others
and said quietly:</p>

<p>"We can't leave him here. We've got to get him back to Paris
somehow."</p>

<p>After two ghastly hours in which they tried to revive him,
persuade him to gird up his fainting limbs for final effort, they
got him back into the car. Ann covered him with blankets and held
him to her for the remainder of the night, as a mother might hold
a child. In the faint ghost-gleam of light her face shone dark
and sombre, her eyes were dark, moveless, looking straight
ahead.</p>

<p>Armed with instructions from an anxious waiter, they set out
again on the presumptive road to Paris. The interminable night
wore on; the white blanket of the fog grew thicker, they passed
through more ghost-villages, sheer and sudden as a dream, sheeted
in the strange numb silence of that ghostly nightmare of a fog.
The old red crater of the moon vanished in a ruined helve at
length behind a rise of earth. They could no longer see anything,
the road before was utterly blotted out, the car-lights burned
against an impenetrable white wall, they groped their way in
utter blindness, they crawled at a snail's pace.</p>

<p>Finally, they felt their way along, inch by inch and foot by
foot. Eugene stood on the running-board of the car, peering
blindly into that blank wall of fog, trying only to define the
edges of the road. The bitter penetration of raw cold struck
through the fog and pierced them like a nail. From time to time
Elinor stopped the car, while he stepped down and stamped numb
feet upon the road, swung frozen arms and lustily blew warmth
back into numb fingers. Then that infinite groping patience of
snail's progress would begin again.</p>

<p>Somewhere, somehow, through that blind sea of fog, there was a
sense of morning in the air. The ghosts of towns and villages
grew more frequent--the towns were larger now, occasionally
Elinor bumped over phantom curbs before the warning shouts of her
look-out could prevent her. Twice they banged into trees along
unknown pavements. There was a car-track now, the bump of
cobbles, the sense of greater complications in the world about
them.</p>

<p>Suddenly they heard the most thrilling and evocative of all
earth's sounds at morning--the lonely clopping of shod hooves
upon the cobbles. In the dim and ghostly sheeting of that light
they saw the horse, the market cart balanced between its two high
creaking wheels, laden with sweet clean green-and-gold of carrot
bunches, each neatly trimmed as a bouquet.</p>

<p>They could discern the faint ghost-glimmer of the driver's
face, the big slow-footed animal, dappled grey, and clopping
steadily towards the central markets.</p>

<p>They were entering Paris and the fog was lifting. In its huge
shroud of mist dispersing, the old buildings of the city emerged
ghostly haggard, pallidly nascent in the dim grey light. A man
was walking rapidly along a terraced pavement, with bent head,
hands thrust in pockets--the figure of the worker since the world
began. They saw at morning, in grey waking light, a waiter, his
apron-ends tucked up, lifting racked chairs from the tables of a
caf&eacute;, and on light mapled fronts of bars and shops, the
signs <i>Bi&egrave;re</i>--<i>P&acirc;tisserie</i>--<i>Tabac.</i>
Suddenly, the huge winged masses of the Louvre swept upon them,
and it was grey light now, and Eugene heard Elinor's low, fervent
"Thank God!"</p>

<p>And now the bridge, the Seine again, the frontal blank of the
old buildings on the quays, faced haggardly towards light, the
narrow lane of the Rue Bonaparte, and in the silent empty street
at length, his own hotel.</p>

<p>They said good-bye quickly, hurriedly, abstractedly, as he got
out; and drove away. The women were thinking of nothing, no one
now, but Starwick, life's fortunate darling, the rare, the
precious, the all-favoured one. In the grey light, unconscious,
completely swaddled in the heavy rugs, Starwick still lay
pillowed on Ann's shoulder.</p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h1>LXXXIV</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>All day Eugene slept the dreamless, soundless sleep of a man
who has been drugged. When he awoke, night had come again. And
this concatenation of night to night, of dreamless and exhausted
sleep upon the strange terrific nightmare of the night before,
the swift kaleidoscope of moving action which had filled his life
for the past two days, now gave to that recent period a haunting
and disturbing distance, and to the events that had gone before
the sad finality of irrevocable time. Suddenly he felt as if his
life with Ann, Elinor, and Starwick was finished, done; for some
strangely troubling reason he could not define, he felt that he
would never see them again.</p>

<p>He got up, dressed, and went downstairs. He saw old Gely and
his wife, his daughters, Marie the maid, and the little
concierge: it seemed to him that they looked at him strangely,
curiously, with some sorrowful sad knowledge in their eyes, and a
nameless numb excitement gripped him, dulled his heart. He felt
the nameless apprehension that he always felt--that perhaps all
men feel--when they have been away a day or two. It was a
premonition of bad news, of some unknown misfortune: he wanted to
ask them if someone had come for him--without knowing who could
come--if they had a message for him--not knowing who might send
him one--an almost feverish energy to demand that they tell him
at once what unknown calamity had befallen him in his absence.
But he said nothing, but still haunted by what he thought was the
strange and troubling look in their eyes--a look he had often
thought he observed in people, which seemed to tell of a secret
knowledge, an inhuman chemistry, a communion in men's lives to
which his own life was a stranger--he hurried out into the
street.</p>

<p>Outside the streets were wet with mist, the old cobbles shone
with a dull wet gleam, through the mist the lamps burned dimly,
and through the fog he heard the swift and unseen passing of the
taxi-cabs, the shrill tooting of their little horns.</p>

<p>Yet everything was ghost-like and phantasmal--the streets of
Paris had the unfamiliar reality of streets that one revisits
after many years of absence, or walks again after the confinement
of a long and serious illness.</p>

<p>He ate at a little restaurant in the Rue de la Seine, and
troubled by the dismal lights, the high old houses, and the empty
streets of the Latin Quarter sounding only with the brief passage
of some furious little taxi drilling through those narrow lanes
towards the bridge of the Seine and the great blaze and gaiety of
night, he finally forsook that dark quarter, which seemed to be
the image of the unquiet loneliness that beset him, and crossing
the bridge, he spent the remainder of the evening reading in one
of the caf&eacute;s near Les Magasins du Louvre.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>The next morning, when he awoke, a <i>pneumatique</i> was
waiting for him. It was from Elinor, and read:</p>

<p>"Darling, where are you? Are you still recovering from the
great debauch, or have you given us the go-by, or what? The
suspense is awful--won't you say it ain't so, and come to lunch
with us today at half-past twelve? We'll be waiting for you at
the studio.--ELINOR"--Below this in a round and almost childish
hand, was written: "We want to see you. We missed you
yesterday.--ANN."</p>

<p>He read this brief and casual little note over again and
again, he laughed exultantly, and smote his fist into the air and
read again. All of the old impossible joy was revived in him. He
went to the window and looked out: a lemony sunlight was falling
on the old pale walls and roofs and chimney-pots of Paris:
everything sparkled with health and hope and work and
morning--and all because two girls from Boston in New England had
written him a note.</p>

<p>He held the flimsy paper of the <i>pneumatique</i> tenderly,
as if it were a sacred parchment too old and precious for rough
handling; he even lifted it to his nose and smelled it. It seemed
to him that all the subtle, sensuous femininity of the two women
was in it--the seductive and thrilling fragrance, impalpable and
glorious as the fragrance of a flower, which their lives seemed
to irradiate and to give to everything, to everyone they touched,
a sense of triumph, joy and tenderness. He read the one blunt
line that Ann had written him as if it were poetry of haunting
magic: the level, blunt and toneless inflexibility of her voice
sounded in the line as if she had spoken; he read into her simple
words a thousand buried meanings--the tenderness of a profound,
simple and inarticulate spirit, whose feelings were too deep for
language, who had no words for them.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>When he got to the studio he found the two women waiting, but
Starwick was not there. Ann was quietly, bluntly matter of fact
as usual; Elinor almost hilariously gay, but beneath her gaiety
he sensed at once a deep and worried perturbation, a worn anxiety
that shone nakedly from her troubled eyes.</p>

<p>They told him that on their return from Rheims, Starwick had
left the studio to meet Alec and had not been seen since. No word
from him had they had that night or the day before, and now, on
the second day since his disappearance, their anxiety was
evident.</p>

<p>But during lunch--they ate at a small restaurant in the
neighbourhood, near the Montparnasse railway station--Elinor kept
up a gay and rapid conversation, and persisted in speaking of
Starwick's disappearance as a great lark--the kind of thing to be
expected from him.</p>

<p><i>"Perfectly</i> insane, of course!" she cried, with a gay
laugh. "But then, it's typical of him: it's just the kind of
thing that kind would do. Oh, he'll turn up, of course," she
said, with quiet confidence, "--he'll turn up in a day or two,
after some wild adventure that no one in the world but Francis
Starwick could have had. . . . I <i>mean!"</i> she cried,
"picking that Frenchman--Alec--up the way he did the other night.
<i>Utterly</i> mad, of course!" she said gaily. "--But then,
there you <i>are!</i> It wouldn't be Frank if he didn't!"</p>

<p>"I see nothing very funny about it," said Ann bluntly. "It
looks like a pretty rotten mess to me. We know nothing at all
about that Frenchman--who he is, what he does; we don't even know
his name. For all you know he may be one of the worst thugs or
criminals in Paris."</p>

<p>"Oh, I know, my dear--but don't be absurd!" Elinor protested.
"The man's all right--Frank's always picking up these people--it
always turns out all right in the end--oh, but of course!" she
cried, as if dispelling a troubling thought from her mind--"Of
course it will! It's too ridiculous to allow yourself to be upset
like this!"</p>

<p>But in spite of her vigorous assurance, her eyes were full of
care and of something painful and baffled, an almost naked
anguish.</p>

<p>He left them after lunch, promising to meet them again for
dinner. Starwick had not come back. When they had finished
dinner, the two women went back to the studio to wait for
Starwick's possible return, and Eugene went to look for him in
Montmartre, promising to let them know at once if he found
Starwick or got news of him. When he got to Montmartre, he made a
round first of all the resorts which Starwick had liked best and
frequented most, as Eugene remembered them, of course; but no one
had seen him since they had last been there all together.
Finally, he went to the bistro in the Rue Montmartre, where they
had first encountered Alec, and asked the soiled barman with the
dark mistrustful eye if he had seen either Alec or Starwick in
the past three days. The man eyed him suspiciously for a moment
before answering. Then he surlily replied that he had seen
neither of them. In spite of the man's denial, he stayed on,
drinking one cognac after another at the bar, while it filled up,
ebbed and flowed, with the mysterious rout and rabble of the
night. He waited until four o'clock in the morning: neither
Starwick nor Alec had appeared. He got into a taxi and was driven
back across Paris to Montparnasse. When he got to the studio, the
two women were still awake, waiting, and he gave them his
disappointing news. Then he departed, promising to return at
noon.</p>

<p>All through that day they waited: the apprehension of the two
women was now painfully evident, and Ann spoke bluntly of calling
in the police. Towards six o'clock that evening, while they were
engaged in vigorous debate concerning their course of action,
there were steps along the alley-way outside, and Starwick
entered the studio, followed by the Frenchman, Alec.</p>

<p>Starwick was in excellent spirits, his eyes were clear, his
ruddy face looked fresh, and had a healthy glow. In response to
all their excited greetings and inquiries, he laughed gleefully,
teasingly, and refused to answer. When they tried to find out
from Alec where Starwick had been, he too smiled an engaging but
malicious smile, shrugged his shoulders politely, and said: "I do
not know, I s'ink he tells you if he v'ants--if not!" again he
smiled, and shrugged politely. And this moody and secretive
silence was never broken. Starwick never told them where he had
been. Once or twice, during dinner, which was a hilarious one, he
made casual and mysteriously hinting references to Brussels, but,
in response to all of Elinor's deft, ironic cross-examination, he
only laughed his burbling laugh, and refused to answer.</p>

<p>And she, finally defeated, laughed suddenly, a laugh of rich
astonishment, crying: <i>"Perfectly</i> insane, of course! But
then, what did I tell you? It's just the sort of thing that Frank
<i>would</i> do!"</p>

<p>But, in spite of all her high light spirits, her gay swift
laughter, her distinguished ease, there was in the woman's eyes
something the boy had never seen before: a horrible, baffled
anguish of torment and frustration. And although her manner
towards the Frenchman, Alec, was gracious, gay, and
charming--although she now accepted him as "one of us," and
frequently said with warm enthusiasm that he was "a
<i>per-fectly</i> swell person--I like him <i>so</i> much!" there
was often something in her eyes when she looked at him that it
was not good to see.</p>

<p>Alec was their guest, and Starwick's constant companion,
everywhere they went thereafter. And everywhere, in every way, he
proved himself to be a droll, kind, courteous, witty and urbanely
cynical person: a man of charming and engaging qualities and
delightful company. They never asked his name, nor inquired about
his birth, his family, or his occupation. They seemed to accept
his curious fellowship with Starwick as a matter of course: they
took him on their daily round of caf&eacute;'s, restaurants,
night-clubs, and resorts, as if he were a lifelong friend of the
family. And he accepted all their favours gracefully, politely,
with wit and grace and charm, with a natural and distinguished
dignity and ease. He, too, never asked disturbing questions; he
was a diplomat by nature, a superb tactician from his birth.
Nevertheless, the puzzled, doubting and inquiring expression in
his eyes grew deeper day by day; his tongue was eloquently
silent, but the question in his puzzled eyes could not be hidden,
and constantly sought speech.</p>

<p>As for Eugene, he now felt for the first time an ugly,
disquieting doubt: suddenly he remembered many things--words and
phrases and allusions, swift, casual darts and flashes of memory
that went all the way back to the Cambridge years, that had long
since been forgotten--but that now returned to fill his mind. And
sometimes when he looked at Starwick, he had the weird and
unpleasant sensation of looking at someone he had never seen
before.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>At the last moment, when it seemed that the argosy of their
battered friendship was bound to sink, it was Elinor who saved it
again. Ann, in a state of sullen fury, had announced that she was
sailing for home the next week; Eugene, that he was going South
to "some quiet little place where"--so did his mind comfortably
phrase it--"he could settle down and write." As for Starwick, he
remained coldly, wearily, sorrowfully impassive; he accepted this
bitter dissolution of their plans with a weary resignation at
once sad and yet profoundly indifferent; his own plans were more
wrapped in a mantle of mysterious and tragic secretiveness than
ever before. And seeing the desperate state which their affairs
had come to, and that she could not look for help from these
three gloomy secessionists, Elinor instantly took charge of
things again and became the woman who had driven an ambulance in
the war.</p>

<p>"Listen, my darlings," she said with a sweet, crisp frivolity,
that was as fine, as friendly, as comforting, and as instantly
authoritative as the words of a capable mother to her contrary
children--"no one is going away; no one is going back home; no
one is going anywhere except on the wonderful trip we've planned
from the beginning. We're going to start out next week, Ann and I
will do the driving, you two boys can loaf and invite your souls
to your hearts' content, and when you see a place that looks like
a good place to work in, we'll stop and stay until you're tired
of working. Then we'll go on again."</p>

<p>"Where?" said Starwick in a dead and toneless voice. "Go on
where?"</p>

<p>"Why, my dear child!" Elinor cried in a gay tone. "Anywhere!
Wherever you like! That's the beauty of it! We're not going to be
bound down by any programme, any schedule: we shall stay where we
like and go anywhere our sweet selves desire.</p>

<p>"I thought, however," she continued in a more matter-of-fact
way, "that we would go first to Chartres and then on to Touraine,
stopping off at Orl&eacute;ans or Blois or Tours--anywhere we
like, and staying as long as we care to. After that, we could do
the Pyrenees and all that part of France: we might stop a few
days at Biarritz and then strike off into the Basque country. I
know <i>incredible</i> little places we could stop at."</p>

<p>"Could we see Spain?" asked Starwick for the first time with a
note of interest in his voice.</p>

<p>"But, of <i>course!"</i> she cried. "My dear child, we can see
anything, everything, go anywhere your heart desires. That's the
beauty of the whole arrangement. If you feel like writing, if you
want to run down to Spain to get a little writing done--why,
presto! chango! Alacazam!" she said gaily, snapping her fingers,
"--the thing is done! There's nothing simpler!"</p>

<p>For a moment, no one spoke. They all sat entranced in a kind
of unwilling but magical spell of wonder and delight. Elinor,
with her power to make everything seem delightfully easy, and
magically simple and exciting, had clothed that fantastic
programme with all the garments of naturalness and reason.
Everything now seemed not only possible, but beautifully,
persuasively practicable--even that ludicrous project of "running
down to Spain to do a little writing," that hopeless delusion of
"stopping off and working, anywhere you like, until you are ready
to go on again"--she gave to the whole impossible adventure not
only the thrilling colours of sensuous delight and happiness, but
also the conviction of a serious purpose, a reasonable
design.</p>

<p>And in a moment, Starwick, rousing himself from his abstracted
and fascinated reverie, turned to Eugene and, with the old
gleeful burble of laughter in his throat, remarked simply in his
strangely fibred voice:</p>

<p>"It sounds swell, doesn't it?"</p>

<p>And Ann, whose sullen, baffled look had more and more been
tempered by an expression of unwilling interest, now laughed her
sudden angry laugh, and said:</p>

<p>"It <i>would</i> be swell if everyone would only act like
decent human beings for a change!"</p>

<p>In spite of her angry words, her face had a tender, radiant
look of joy and happiness as she spoke, and it seemed that all
her hope and belief had returned to her.</p>

<p>"But of course!" Elinor answered instantly, and with complete
conviction. "And that's just exactly how everyone <i>is</i> going
to act! Eugene will be all right," she cried--"the moment that we
get out of Paris! You'll see! We've gone at a perfectly
<i>killing</i> pace this last month or two! No one in the world
could stand it! Eugene is tired, our nerves are all on edge,
we're worn out by staying up all night, and drinking, and flying
about from one place to another--but a day or two of rest will
fix all that. . . . And that, my children, is just exactly what
we're going to do--now--at once!" She spoke firmly, kindly, with
authority. "We're getting out of Paris today!"</p>

<p>"Where?" said Starwick. "Where are we going?"</p>

<p>"We're all going out to St. Germain-en-Laye to rest up for a
day or two before we leave. We'll stay at your pension, Francis,
and you can pack your things while we're out there, because you
won't be going back again. After that we'll come back to Paris to
spend the night--we won't stay here over a day at the outside:
Ann and I will clear our things out of the studio, and Eugene can
get packed up at his hotel--that should mean, let's see"--she
tapped her lips lightly with thoughtful fingers--"we should be
packed up and ready to start Monday morning, at the latest."</p>

<p>"Hadn't I better stay in town and do my packing now?" Eugene
suggested.</p>

<p>"Darling," said Elinor softly, with a tender and seductive
humour, putting her fingers on his arm--"you'll do nothing of the
sort! You're driving out with us this afternoon! We all love you
so much that we're going to take no chance of losing you at the
last minute!"</p>

<p>And for a moment, the strange and almost noble dignity of
Elinor's face was troubled by a faint smile of pleasant, tender
radiance, the image of the immensely feminine, gracious, and
lovely spirit which almost grotesquely seemed to animate her
large and heavy body.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Thus, under the benevolent and comforting dictatorship of this
capable woman, hope had been restored to them, and in gay
spirits, shouting and laughing and singing, feeling an impossible
happiness when they thought of the wonderful adventure before
them, they drove out to St. Germain-en-Laye that afternoon. The
late sun was slanting rapidly towards evening when they arrived:
they left their car before an old caf&eacute; near the railway
station, and for an hour walked together through the vast avenues
of the forest, the stately, sorrowful design of that great
planted forest, so different from anything in America, so
different from the rude, wild sweep and savage lyricism of our
terrific earth, and so haunted by the spell of time. It was the
forest which Henry the Fourth had known so well, and which, in
its noble planted colonnades, suggested an architecture of nature
that was like a cathedral, evoked a sense of time that was
ancient, stately, classical, full of sorrow and a tragical joy,
and haunted for ever by the pacings of noble men and women now
long dead.</p>

<p>When they came out of the forest at the closing hour--for in
this country, in this ancient noble place, even the forests were
controlled, and closed and opened by the measurements of mortal
time--the old red sun of waning day had almost gone.</p>

<p>For a time they stood on the great sheer butte of St. Germain,
and looked across the space that intervened between themselves
and Paris. Below them in the valley, the Seine wound snakewise
through a series of silvery silent loops, and beyond, across the
fields and forests and villages, already melting swiftly into
night and twinkling with a diamond dust of lights, they saw the
huge and smoking substance that was Paris, a design of elfin
towers and ancient buildings and vast inhuman distances, an
architecture of enchantment, smoky, lovely as a dream, seeming to
be upborne, to be sustained, to float there like the vision of an
impossible and unapproachable loveliness, out of a huge
opalescent mist. It was a land of far Cockaigne, for ever
threaded by the eternity of its silver, silent river; a city of
enfabled walls, like Carcassonne, and never to be reached or
known.</p>

<p>And while they looked it seemed to them that they heard the
huge, seductive, drowsy murmur of that magic and eternal city--a
murmur which seemed to resume into itself all of the grief, the
joy, the sorrow, the ambitions, hopes, despairs, defeats and
loves of humanity. And though all life was mixed and intermingled
in that distant, drowsy sound, it was itself detached, remote,
eternal and undying as the voice of time. And it hovered there
for ever in the timeless skies of that elfin city, and was
eternally the same, no matter what men lived or died.</p>

<p>They turned, and went into the old caf&eacute; near the
station for an ap&eacute;ritif before dinner. It was one of those
old, pleasantly faded caf&eacute;s that one finds in little
French towns. The place had the comfortable look and feel of an
old shoe: the old, worn leather cushions, the chairs and tables,
the mirrors in their frames of faded gilt, the old stained woods
conveyed a general air of use, of peace, of homely shabby
comfort, which suggested the schedule of generations of quiet
people who had come here as part of the ordered ritual of a day,
and which was so different from the feverish pulse, the sensual
flash and glitter of the caf&eacute;s of Paris. The noble peace
and dignity of the great forest, and the magic vision of the
time-enchanted city in the evening light, the silver, shining
loops of its eternal river, still haunted their spirits and
filled their hearts with wonder and a tranquil joy. And the old
caf&eacute; seemed to possess them, to make them its own, with
its homely comfort: it was one of those places that one thinks of
at once, instinctively, by a powerful intuition, as being a
"good" place, and yet they could not have said why. As they came
in, the proprietor smiled and spoke to them in a quiet, casual,
and friendly manner as if he had always known them and, in a
moment, when they were seated in the comfortable old leathers
against the wall, their waiter came and smilingly waited for
their order. He was one of those waiters that one often sees
abroad: an old man with a sharp, worn face, full of quiet humour
and intelligence, an old, thin figure worn in service, but still
spry and agile, a decent "family man" with wife and children, a
man seasoned in humanity, whose years of service upon thousands
of people had given him a character that was wise, good, honest,
gentle, and a trifle equivocal. Each ordered an ap&eacute;ritif,
the two women a vermouth-cassis, the two young men, Pernod: they
talked quietly, happily, and with the weary, friendly
understanding that people have when all their passion of desire
and grief and conflict is past. The world that they had lived in
for the last two months--that world of night and Paris and
debauch--seemed like an evil dream, and the way before them now
looked clear and plain.</p>

<p>When they left the caf&eacute;, full dark had come: they got
in the car and drove to the pension at the other end of town,
where Elinor had already engaged rooms for all of them. It now
turned out that Elinor had taken rooms for Starwick at this
pension three months before, upon his arrival in Paris, but after
the first two weeks he had not lived in them, although most of
his clothing, books, and other belongings were still there. It
was one more of his costly, wrong, and tragically futile efforts
to find a place--some impossibly fortunate and favourable place
that never would be found--where he could "settle down and get
his writing done."</p>

<p>When the four friends got to the pension, dinner had already
begun. A table had been reserved for them, and as they entered
the dining-room everyone stopped eating--two dozen pairs of old
dead eyes were turned mistrustfully upon the young people, and in
a moment, all over the room, at every table, the old heads bent
together eagerly in conspiratorial secrecy, a low greedy
whispering went up.</p>

<p>Starwick and Elinor were apparently already well and
unfavourably known to the old pensionnaires. The moment they
entered, in the vast and sibilant whispering that went round the
room, envenomed fragments of conversation could be heard:</p>

<p>"Ah, c'est lui! . . . Et la dame aussi! . . . Ils sont revenus
ensemble. . . . Mais oui, oui!" At the next table to them an old
hag with piled masses of dyed reddish hair, dressed in an
old-fashioned dress bedecked with a thousand little gauds, peered
at them for a moment with an expression of venomous and greedy
curiosity, and then, leaning half across the table towards an old
man with a swollen apoplectic face and thick white moustaches,
and a little wizened old hag with the beady eyes of a
reptile--possibly his wife--she hissed:</p>

<p>"Mais oui! . . . Oui! . . . C'est lui, le jeune
Am&eacute;ricain! . . . Personne ici ne l'a pas vu depuis trois
mois." The old man here muttered something in a choked and
phlegmy sort of voice, and the old parrot-visaged hag
straightened, struck her bony hand sharply on the table, and
cried out in a comical booming note:</p>

<p>"Mais justement! . . . Justement! . . . C'est comme vous
voyez!" . . . Here she lowered her voice again, and peering round
craftily at Elinor and Frank, who were shaking with laughter, she
muttered hoarsely:</p>

<p>"Il n'est pas son mari! . . . Il est beaucoup plus jeune. . .
. Mais non, mais non, mais non, mais non, mais non!" she cried
with a rapid and violent impatience as the old man muttered out a
question to her greedy ear.--"Elle est d&eacute;j&agrave;
mari&eacute;e! . . . Oui! Oui!" This last was boomed out
positively, with an indignant glance at Elinor. "Mais justement!
Justement! . . . C'est comme vous voyez!"</p>

<p>That night Elinor was instant, swift, and happy as a flash of
light. There was nothing that she did not seem to apprehend
immediately, to interpret instantly, to understand before a word
could be spoken, and to translate at once into a mercurial
hilarity which swept everyone along with it, and made all share
instantly in its wild swift gaiety, even when it would have been
impossible to say why one was gay. The soup was served: it was a
brown disquieting liquid in which were floating slices of some
troubling and unknown tissue--a whitish substance of an obscenely
porous texture. It was probably tripe: Eugene stared at it with a
sullen and suspicious face, and as he looked up, Elinor rocked
back in her chair with a gust of wild hilarity, placed her
fingers across her mouth and laughed a rich and sudden laugh.
Then, before he could speak, she placed light fingers swiftly on
his arm, and said swiftly, gravely, in a tone of commiserating
consent:</p>

<p>"Yes, I know, darling! I quite agree with you!--"</p>

<p>"What is it?" he said dumbly, in a bewildered tone. "It looks
like--"</p>

<p>"Exactly! Exactly!" Elinor cried at once, before he could
finish, and was swept by that wild light gale of merriment
again--"That's exactly what it looks like--and don't say another
word! We all agree with you!" She looked drolly at the uneasy
liquid in the soup-plate, and then said, firmly and positively:
"No, I think not! . . . If you don't mind, I'd rather not!"--and
then, seeing his face again, was rocked with rude and sudden
laughter. "God!" she cried. "Isn't it marvellous! Will you look
at the poor kid's face!"--And put light fingers gravely, swiftly,
tenderly upon his arm again.</p>

<p>The great wave of this infectious gaiety swept them along: it
was a wonderful meal. Starwick's burble of gleeful, rich humorous
and suggestive laughter was heard again; Ann laughed her short
and sudden laugh, but her face was radiant, happy, lovelier than
it had ever been, everything seemed wonderfully good and pleasant
to them. Elinor called the waitress and quietly sent the
troubling soup away, but the rest of the meal was excellent, and
they made a banquet of it with two bottles of the best Sauterne
the pension afforded. Their hilarity was touched somewhat by the
scornful patronage of bright young people among their dowdy
elders, and yet they did not intend to be unkind: the whole place
seemed to them a museum of grotesque relics put there for their
amusement, they were determined to make a wonderful occasion of
it, the suspicious eyes, greedy whisperings and conferring heads
of the old people set them off in gales of laughter, and Elinor,
after a glance round and a sudden peal of full rich laughter,
would stifle her merriment with her fingers, and say:</p>

<p>"Isn't it marvellous! . . . God! Isn't it wonderful! . . .
Could anyone have imagined it! . . . Frank. . . . Frank!" she
said quietly in a small stifled tone, "will you <i>look! . .
.</i> Will you <i>kindly</i> take one look at the old girl with
the dyed hair and all the thingumajigs, at the next table. . . .
And the major! . . . And oh! If looks could <i>kill!</i> The
things they are saying about <i>us! . . .</i> I'm sure they think
we're <i>all</i> living in sin together. . . . Such <i>goings</i>
on!" she cried with a gay pretence of horror. "Such open
barefaced goings on, my friends, right in the face of decent
people! . . . Now, is that terrible or not, Monsieur Duval, I ask
you! . . . Darling," she said, turning to Starwick, and speaking
in a tone of droll reproach, "don't you feel a sense of guilt? .
. . Do you intend to do the right thing by a girl or not? . . .
Are you going to make an honest woman of me, or aren't you? . . .
Come on, now, darling," she said coaxingly, bending a little
towards him, "set my tortured heart at rest! Just tell me that
you intend to do the right thing by me! Won't you?" she
coaxed.</p>

<p>"Quite!" said Starwick, his ruddy face reddening with laughter
as he spoke. "But what--" the burble of gleeful and malicious
laughter began to play in his throat as he spoke--"just what is
the right thing? . . . Do you mean?--" he trembled a little with
soundless laughter, and then went on in a gravely earnest but
uncertain tone--"do you mean that you want to live?"--he arched
his eyebrows meaningly, and then said in a tone of droll
impossibly vulgar insinuation--"you know what I
mean--<i>really</i> live, you know?"</p>

<p>"Frank!" she shrieked, and rocked back in her chair, covering
her mouth with her fingers--"But not at <i>all,</i> darling," she
went on with her former ironic seriousness, "--you're talking to
an innocent maid from Boston, Mass., who doesn't know what you
<i>mean</i>--you <i>beast!"</i> she cried. "Don't you know we
Boston girls cannot begin to really live until you make an honest
woman of us first?"</p>

<p>"In that case," Starwick said quietly, his face reddening
again with laughter, "I should think we could begin to live at
once. It seems to me that another man has already taken care of
making you an honest woman!"</p>

<p>"God!" shrieked Elinor, falling back in her chair with another
burst of rich and sudden laughter. "Poor Harold! . . . I had
forgotten him! . . . That's all this place needs to make it
perfect--Harold walking in right now to glare at us over the tops
of his horn-rimmed spectacles--"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Starwick, "and your father and mother bringing up
the rear and regarding me," he choked, "--with very <i>bitter</i>
looks--you know," he said, turning to Eugene, "they feel
<i>quite</i> bitterly towards me--they really do, you know. It's
obvious," he said, "that they regard me as an unprincipled
seducer who has defiled," his voice trembled uncertainly again,
"--who has defiled the virtue of their only <i>darter!"</i> he
brought this word out with a droll and luscious nasality that
made them howl with laughter.</p>

<p>"But really," he went on seriously, turning to Elinor as he
wiped his laughter-reddened face with a handkerchief, "I'm sure
that's how they feel about it. When your mother and father came
to the studio the other day and found me there,"--Elinor's
parents were at that time in Paris--"your father <i>glared</i> at
me in much the same way that Cotton Mather would look at
Casanova. But <i>quite!</i> He really did, you know. I'm sure he
thought you had become my concubine."</p>

<p>"But, darling," Elinor replied, in her playful coaxing tone,
"can't I be your concubine? . . . Oh, how <i>mean</i> you are!"
she said reproachfully. "I do <i>so</i> want to be somebody's
concubine." She turned to Eugene protestingly. "Now is that mean
or not? I ask you. Here I am, a perfectly good well-meaning
female thirty years old, brought up in Boston all my life, and
with the best advantages. I've been a good girl all my life and
tried to do the best I could for everyone, but try as I will,"
she sighed, "no one will help me out in my lifelong ambition to
be somebody's concubine. Now is that fair or not?--I ask
you!"</p>

<p>"But not at all!" said Starwick reprovingly. "Before you can
realize your ambition you've got to go out first and get yourself
a reputation! . . . And," he added, with a swift exuberant glance
at the crafty whispering old heads and faces all around them,
"--I think you're getting one very fast."</p>

<p>They went upstairs immediately to the rooms that Elinor had
engaged. Starwick had two comfortable big rooms in one wing of
the pension; in his living-room a comfortable wood-fire had been
laid and was crackling away lustily. Elinor had taken a small
bedroom for Eugene and a larger room for herself and Ann. In
Ann's room a good wood-fire was also burning cheerfully. Elinor
and Starwick obviously wanted to be alone to talk together--they
conveyed this by a kind of mysterious
more-to-this-than-meets-the-eye quietness that had been frequent
with them during all these weeks. They announced that they were
going for a walk.</p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h1>LXXXVI</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>When they had gone, Eugene went to Ann's door and knocked. She
showed no surprise at seeing him, but stood aside sullenly until
he had come in, and then closed the door behind him. Then she
went back, sat down in a chair before the fire, and leaned
forward upon her knees, and for some time stared dumbly and
sullenly into the crackling flames.</p>

<p>"Where are the others?" she said presently. "Have they gone
out?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he said. "They went for a walk. They said they'd be
gone about an hour."</p>

<p>"Yes," she said cynically, "and they thought it would be good
for me if you and I were left alone for a while. I'm such a grand
person that something just <i>has</i> to be done for me. God!"
she concluded bitterly, "I'm getting tired of having people do me
good! I'm fed up with it!"</p>

<p>He made no reply to this and she said nothing more. Her big
body supported by her elbows, she continued to lean forward and
stare sullenly into the flames.</p>

<p>He had taken a seat in another chair, and at length the
silence, and his position in the chair, and the girl's sullen
expression became painfully awkward, unhappy and embarrassing. He
got up abruptly, took a pillow from the bed, threw it upon the
floor, and lay down flat beside her chair, stretched out
comfortably with his head to the dancing flames. The feel of the
fire, its snap and crackle, the soft flare and fall of burned
wood ash, and the resinous piny smell, together with the broad
old wooden planking of the floor, the silence of the house and
the feel of numb silent night outside, something homelike in the
look of the room--these things, together with Ann's big New
England body leaned forward towards the fire, the sullen
speechless integrity of her grand and lovely face, and the smell
of her, which was the smell of a big healthy woman warmed by
fire--all of these things filled his senses with something
immensely strong, pleasant, and familiar, something latent in
man's blood, which he had not felt in many years, and that now
was quiet but powerfully reawakened. It filled his heart, his
blood, his senses with peace and certitude, with drowsy sensual
joy, and with the powerful awakening of an old perception, like
the rediscovery of an ancient faith, that the sensuous integument
of life was everywhere the same, that the lives of people in this
little town in France were the same as the lives of people in the
town he came from, the same as the lives of people everywhere on
earth. And after all the dark and alien world of night, of Paris,
and another continent, which he had known now for several months,
this rediscovery of the buried life, the fundamental structure of
the great family of earth to which all men belong, filled him
with a quiet certitude and joy.</p>

<p>Ann did not move; bent forward, leaning on her knees, she
continued to stare into the fire, and looking up at her warm,
dark, sullen face, he fell asleep--into a sleep which, after all
the frenzy and exhaustion of the last weeks, was as deep and
soundless as if he were drugged.</p>

<p>How long he lay asleep there on the floor he did not know. But
he was wakened by the sound of her voice--a sullen monotone that
spoke his name--that spoke his name quietly with a toneless,
brooding insistence and that at first he thought he must have
dreamed. It was repeated, again and again, quietly, insistently,
without change or variation until he knew there was no doubt of
it, that he no longer was asleep. And with something slow and
strange and numb beating through him like a mighty pulse, he
opened his eyes and looked up into her face. She had bent forward
still more and was looking down at him with a kind of slow,
brooding intensity, her face smouldering and drowsy as a flower.
And even as he looked at her, she returned his look with that
drowsy, brooding stare, and again, without inflection, spoke his
name.</p>

<p>He sat up like a flash and put his arms around her. He was
beside her on his knees and he hugged her to him in a grip of
speechless, impossible desire: he kissed her on the face and
neck, again and again; her face was warm with the fire, her skin
as soft and smooth as velvet; he kissed her again and again on
the face, clumsily, thickly, with that wild, impossible desire,
and with a horrible feeling of guilt and shame. He wanted to kiss
her on the mouth, and he did not dare to do it: all the time that
he kept kissing her and hugging her to him with a clumsy,
crushing grip, he wanted her more than he had ever wanted any
woman in his life, and at the same time he felt a horrible
profanity in his touch, as if he were violating a Vestal virgin,
trying to rape a nun.</p>

<p>And he did not know why he felt this way, the reason for these
senseless feelings of guilt and shame and profanation. He had
been with so many prostitutes and casual loose promiscuous women
that he would have thought it easy to make love to this big,
clumsy, sullen-looking girl, but now all he could do was to hug
her to him in an awkward grip, to mutter foolishly at her, and to
kiss her warm sullen face again and again.</p>

<p>He tried to put his clumsy hand upon her breast, but the
feeling of shame and profanation swept over him and he could not
keep it there. He put his hand upon her knee, and thrust it under
the skirt: the warm flesh of her leg stung him like an electric
shock and he jerked his hand away. And all the time the girl did
nothing, made no attempt to resist or push him away, just yielded
with a dumb sullen passiveness to his embraces, her face
smouldering with a slow sullen passion that he could not fathom
or define. He did not know why she had wakened him, why she had
called his name, what meaning, what emotion lay behind her
brooding look, her dumb and sullen passiveness, whether she
yielded herself willingly to him or not.</p>

<p>He did not know why he should have this sense of shame and
guilt and profanation when he touched her. It may have come from
an intrinsic nobility and grandeur in her person and in her
character that made physical familiarity almost unthinkable; it
may even have come in part from a feeling of social and class
inferiority--a feeling which may be base and shameful, but to
which young men are fiercely sensitive--the feeling which all
Americans know and have felt cruelly, even those who scornfully
deny that it exists and yet have themselves done most to foster
it. Certainly he had at times been bitterly conscious of the
girl's "exclusiveness"--the fact that she was a member of "an old
Boston family"--a wealthy, guarded, and powerfully entrenched
group; he knew that a beautiful and desirable woman like Ann
would have had many opportunities to pick and choose among
wealthy men of her own class, and that he himself was just the
son of a working-man.</p>

<p>But, most of all, he knew that, more than anything else, the
thing that checked him now, that overpowered him with its
loveliness, that filled his heart with longing and impossible
desire, and at the same moment kept him from possession--was the
passionate and bitter enigma of that strange and lovely thing
which had shaped itself into his life and could never be lost,
could never be forgotten, and was never to be known: the thing he
knew by these two words--"New England."</p>

<p>And as the knowledge came to him he felt the greatest love and
hatred for this thing that he had ever known. A kind of wild
cursing anger, a choking expletive of frustration and despair
possessed him. He took her by the arms and jerked her to her
feet, and cursed her bitterly. And she came dumbly, passively,
sullenly as before, neither yielding nor resisting, as he shook
her, hugged her, cursed her incoherently in that frenzy of desire
and frustrate shame.</p>

<p>"Look here," he panted thickly, shaking her. "Say something! .
. . Do something! . . . Don't stand there like a God-damned
wooden Indian! . . . Who the hell do you think you are, anyway? .
. . Why are you any better than anyone else? . . . Ann! Ann! Look
at me! . . . Speak! What is it? . . . Oh, God-damn you!" he said
with a savagely unconscious humour that neither of them noticed,
"--but I love you! . . . Oh, you big, dumb, beautiful Boston
bitch," he panted amorously, "--just turn your face to me--and
look at me--and by God! I will! I will!" he muttered savagely,
and for the first time, and with a kind of desperation, kissed
her on the mouth, and glared around him like a madman and,
without knowing what he was doing, began to haul and drag her
along toward the bed, muttering--"By God, I'll do it!--Oh, you
sweet, dumb, lovely trollop of a Back Bay--Ann!" he cried
exultantly. "Oh, by God, I'll thaw you out, I'll melt your ice,
my girl--by God, I'll open you!--Is it her arm, now?" he began
gloatingly, and lifted her long arm with a kind of slow, rending
ecstasy and bit into her shoulder haunch, "or her neck, or her
warm face and sullen mouth, or the good smell of her, or that
lovely belly, darling--that white, lovely, fruitful Boston
belly," he gloated, "good for about a dozen babies, isn't it?--or
the big hips and swelling thighs, the long haunch from waist to
knee--oh, you fertile, dumb, unploughed plantation of a
woman--but <i>I'll</i> plant you!" he yelled exultantly--"and the
big, dumb eyes of her, and her long hands and slender
fingers--how did you ever get such slender, graceful hands, you
delicate, big--here! give me the hands now--and all the fine,
long lady-fingers"--he said with gentle, murderous desire, and
suddenly felt the girl's long fingers trembling on his arm, took
them in his hands and felt them there, and all her big, slow body
trembling in his grasp, and was suddenly pierced with a wild and
nameless feeling of pity and regret.</p>

<p>"Oh, Ann, don't," he said, and seized her hand and held it
prayerfully. "Don't look like that--don't be afraid--oh, look
here!" he said desperately again, and put his arms round her
trembling shoulders and began to pat her soothingly. "--Please
don't act like that--don't tremble so--don't be afraid of
me!--Oh, Ann, please don't look at me that way--I didn't mean
it--I'm so God-damned sorry, Ann--Ah-h! it's going to be all
right! It's going to be all right! I swear it's going to be all
right!" he stammered foolishly, and took her hand and pleaded
with her, not knowing what he was saying, and sick with guilt and
shame and horror at the profanation of his act.</p>

<p>Her breath was fluttering, coming uncertainly, panting short
and quick and breathless like a frightened child; this and her
slender hands, her long trembling fingers, the sight of her hands
so strangely, beautifully delicate for such a big woman, filled
him with an unspeakable anguish of remorse. She began to speak, a
breathless, panting, desperate kind of speech, and he found
himself desperately agreeing with everything she said, even
though he did not hear or understand half of it!</p>

<p>". . . Mustn't stay here," she panted. "Let's get out of here
. . . go somewhere . . . anywhere . . . I've got to talk to you.
. . . Something I've got to tell you!" she panted desperately. ".
. . You don't understand . . . awful, horrible mistake!" she
muttered. ". . . Got to tell you, now! . . . Come on! Let's
go."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes--sure--anywhere, Ann. Wherever you say," he agreed
eagerly to everything she said: they put on their hats and coats
with trembling haste, and were preparing to leave just as
Starwick and Elinor returned.</p>

<p>Starwick asked them where they were going: they said they were
going for a walk. He said, "Oh!" non-committally. Both he and
Elinor observed their flushed, excited manner, and trembling
haste, with a curious and rather perturbed look, but said nothing
more, and they departed.</p>

<p>The pension was silent: everyone had already gone to bed, and
when they got out into the street it was the same. It was a night
of still, cold frost, and everywhere around them there were the
strange, living presences of silence and of sleep. The houses had
the closed, shuttered and attentive secrecy that houses in a
small French town have at night, no one else seemed to be abroad:
they strode rapidly along in the direction of the railway
station, saying nothing for a time, their feet sounding sharply
on the frozen ground as they walked.</p>

<p>At length, beneath one of the sparse, infrequent street lamps,
Ann paused, turned to him, and in a rapid, excited tone which was
so different from her usual sullen curtness, began to speak:</p>

<p>"Look here!" she said, "we've got to forget about all that
tonight--about everything that happened! . . . It was my fault,"
she muttered, with a kind of dumb, spinsterly agony of conscience
which, in its evocation of the straight innocence and integrity
of her kind and person, was somehow pitiably moving--"I didn't
mean to lead you on," she said na&iuml;vely. "I shouldn't have
let you get started."</p>

<p>"Oh, Ann," he said, "you didn't do anything! It wasn't your
fault! You couldn't help it--I was the one who started it."</p>

<p>"No, no," she muttered, with a kind of sullen, miserable
doggedness. "It was all my fault. . . . Could have stopped it."
She turned abruptly, miserably, and began to stride on again.</p>

<p>"But, Ann," he began, with a kind of desperate persuasiveness,
as he caught up with her, "don't take it this way. . . . Don't
worry about it like this! . . . We didn't do anything bad,
honestly we didn't!"</p>

<p>"Oh," she muttered without turning her head, "it was an awful
thing--an awful thing to do to you! . . . I'm <i>so</i> ashamed,"
she muttered. "It was a rotten thing to do!"</p>

<p>"But you did nothing!" he protested. "I'm the one!"</p>

<p>"No, no," she muttered again--"I started it . . . I don't know
why. . . . But I had no right . . . there's something you don't
understand."</p>

<p>"But what? What is it, Ann?" He didn't know whether to laugh
or cry over this dumb, spinsterly integrity of New England
conscience which, it seemed to him, was taking the episode so
bitterly to heart.</p>

<p>She paused in her long stride below another street lamp, and
turning, spoke sternly, desperately, to him.</p>

<p>"Listen!" she said. "You've got to forget everything that
happened tonight. . . . I never knew you felt that way about me.
. . . You've got to forget about me. . . . You must never think
of me that way again!"</p>

<p>"Why?" he said.</p>

<p>"Because," she muttered, "it's wrong . . . wrong."</p>

<p>"Why is it wrong?"</p>

<p>She did not answer for a moment, and then, turning, looked him
straight in the eye:</p>

<p>"Because," she said, with quiet bluntness, "nothing can come
of it. . . . I don't feel that way about you."</p>

<p>He could not answer for a moment, and it seemed to him that a
thin film of ice had suddenly hardened round his heart.</p>

<p>"Oh," he said presently; and, after a moment, added, "and
don't you think you ever could?"</p>

<p>She did not answer, but began to walk rapidly ahead. He caught
up with her again, took her by the arm and pulled her round to
face him. He said sharply:</p>

<p>"Answer me! Don't you think you ever could?"</p>

<p>Her face was full of dumb, sullen misery; she muttered:</p>

<p>"There's something you don't understand--something you don't
know about."</p>

<p>"That's not what I asked you. Answer me."</p>

<p>"No," she muttered sullenly. "I can't feel that way about you.
. . . I never will." She turned with a miserable look in her face
and began to walk again. The ring of ice kept hardening round his
heart all the time; he caught up with her again, and again
stopped her.</p>

<p>"Listen, Ann. You've got to tell me why. I've got to
know."--She shook her head miserably and turned away, but he
caught her, and pulled her back, saying in a sharper, more
peremptory tone:</p>

<p>"No, now--I've got to know. Is it because--you just never
could feel that way about a fellow like me--because you could
never think about me in that way--?"</p>

<p>She didn't answer for a moment; she just stood looking at him
dumbly and miserably; and finally she shook her head in a
movement of denial:</p>

<p>"No," she said. "It's not that."</p>

<p>The ring of ice kept getting thicker all the time, it seemed
he would not be able to speak the words, but in a moment he
said:</p>

<p>"Well, then, is it--is it someone else?"</p>

<p>She made a sudden tormented movement of anguish and despair,
and turning, tried to walk away. He seized her, and jerked her
back to him, and said:</p>

<p>"Answer me, God-damn it! Is that the reason why?"</p>

<p>He waited a long moment before the answer came, and then she
muttered it out so low he could scarcely hear it.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, and wrenched her arm free. "Let me go."</p>

<p>He caught her again, and pulled her back. The ring of ice
seemed to have frozen solid, and in that cold block he could feel
his heart throbbing like a trip-hammer.</p>

<p>"Who is it?" he said.</p>

<p>She did not answer, and he shook her roughly. "You answer me.
. . . Is it someone you knew back home--?"</p>

<p>"Let me go," she muttered. "I won't tell you."</p>

<p>"By God, you will," he said thickly, and held her. "Who is it?
Is it someone you met back home, or not?"</p>

<p>"No!" she shouted, and wrenched free with a kind of stifled
sob, and started ahead, almost running: "Leave me alone now! I
won't tell you!"</p>

<p>A sudden flash of intuition, an instant flash of recognition
and horror went through him like a knife. His heart seemed to
have frozen solid, his breath to have stopped: he jumped for her
like a cat, and whisking her round towards him, said:</p>

<p>"Ann! Look at me a moment!" He put his fingers underneath her
chin and jerked her face up roughly: "Are you in love with
Starwick?"</p>

<p>A long wailing note of dumb anguish and despair was torn from
her; she tried to break from his grasp, and as she wrenched to
get free, cried pitiably, in a terror-stricken voice:</p>

<p>"Leave me alone! Leave me alone!"</p>

<p>"Answer, God-damn you!" he snarled. "Is it Starwick or
not?"</p>

<p>With a last frenzied effort, she wrenched free, and screamed
like a wounded animal:</p>

<p><i>"Yes!</i> <i>Yes! . . .</i> I've told you now! Are you
satisfied? Will you leave me alone?" And with a sobbing breath,
she began to run blindly.</p>

<p>He ran after her again, and caught up with her and took her in
his arms, but not to embrace her, but just to hold her, stop her,
somehow quiet, if he could, the wild, dumb, pitiable anguish of
that big creature, which tore through the ventricles of his heart
like a knife. He himself was sick with horror, and a kind of
utter, paralyzing terror he had never felt before; he scarcely
knew what he was doing, what he was saying, but the sight of that
great, dumb creature's anguish, that locked and inarticulate
agony of grief, was more than he could bear. And cold with
terror, he began to mumble with a thickened tongue: "Oh, but Ann,
Ann!--Starwick, Starwick!--it's no use! It's no use!--Christ,
what a shame! What a shame!" For suddenly he knew what Starwick
was, what he had never allowed himself to admit that Starwick had
become, and he kept mumbling thickly, "Christ! Christ! What a
pity! What a shame!" not knowing what he was saying, conscious
only, with a kind of sickening horror, of the evil mischance
which had with such a cruel and deliberate perversity set their
lives awry, and of the horrible waste and loss which had warped
for ever this grand and fertile creature's life and which now
would bring all her strength, her love, the noble integrity of
her spirit, to barren sterile nothing.</p>

<p>At the moment he had only one feeling, overwhelming and
intolerable, somehow to quiet her, to stop, to heal this horrible
wound of grief and love, to bring peace to her tormented spirit
somehow, to do anything, use his life in any way that would give
her a little peace and comfort.</p>

<p>And he kept holding her, patting her on the shoulders, saying
foolishly over and over again, and not knowing what he said:</p>

<p>"Oh, it's all right! . . . It's all right, Ann! . . . You
mustn't look like this, you mustn't act this way . . . it's going
to be all right!" And knowing miserably, horribly, that it was
not all right, that the whole design and fabric of their lives
were ruinously awry, that there was a hurt too deep ever to heal,
a wrong too cruel, fatal, and perverse ever to be righted.</p>

<p>She stayed there in his arms, she turned her face into his
shoulder, she put her slender, strong and lovely hands upon his
arms and held on to him desperately, and there, in the frozen,
sleeping stillness of that street in a little French town, she
wept hoarsely, bitterly, dreadfully, like some great creature
horribly wounded; and all he could do was hold on to her until
the last torn cry of pain had been racked and wrenched out of
her.</p>

<p>When it was all over, and she had grown quiet, she dried her
eyes, and looking at him with a dumb, pleading expression, she
whispered miserably:</p>

<p>"You won't tell them? You won't say anything to Frank about
this, will you? You'll never let him know?"</p>

<p>And stabbed again by wild, rending pity, sick with horror at
her devastating terror, he told her he would not.</p>

<p>They walked home in silence through the frozen, sleeping
streets. It was after midnight when they got back to the pension:
the whole house was long ago asleep. As they went up the stairs a
clock began to strike.</p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h1>LXXXVII</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>He did not see her the next morning until it was time for
lunch. She had gone out early with the big Alsatian dog, and had
spent the morning walking in the forest. During the morning he
told Elinor and Starwick that he was going back to Paris.
Starwick said nothing at all, but Elinor, after a moment's
silence, said coldly, and with a trace of sarcasm:</p>

<p>"Very well, my dear. You're the doctor. If the lure of the
great city has proved too much for you, go you must." She was
silent for a moment, and then said ironically, "Does this mean
that we are not to have the honour of your distinguished company
on our trip? . . . Really," she said curtly, "I wish you'd try to
make up your mind what you're going to do. . . . The suspense,
darling, is growing <i>quite</i> unbearable. If you'd try to
break it to us gently," she went on poisonously, "I beg of you to
let the blow fall now, and not to spare us any longer. After
all," she said with a kind of evil drollery, "we may manage to
survive the shock. . . . Really, I should like to know," she said
sharply, as he did not answer. "If you're not going, we'll get
someone else to take your place--we wanted a fourth party to help
share in the expenses," she added venomously, "and I'd like to
know at once what your intentions are."</p>

<p>He stared at her with a smouldering face and with a swelter of
hot and ugly anger in his heart, but as usual, her envenomed
attack was too quick and sudden for him. Before he could answer,
even as his tongue was blundering at a hot reply, she turned
swiftly away, and with an air of resignation, said to
Starwick:</p>

<p>"Will you try to find out what his intentions are? I can't
find out what he wants to do. <i>Apparently,"</i> she concluded
in a rich, astounded voice, "--apparently, your young friend is
tongue-tied." She walked away, contained and beautifully
self-possessed as ever, save for two angry spots of colour in her
face.</p>

<p>When she had gone, Starwick turned to him, and said with quiet
reproof:</p>

<p>"You ought to let her know. You really ought, you know."</p>

<p>"All right!" he said quickly and hotly, "I'm letting you know
right now. I'm not going."</p>

<p>Starwick said nothing for a moment, then with a quiet, weary,
and sorrowful resignation, he said:</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, Gene."</p>

<p>The other said nothing, but just stood looking at Starwick
with eyes which were cold and hard and ugly with their hate.
Starwick's quiet words, the almost Christ-like humility with
which he uttered them, now seemed to him to be nothing but the
mask of a sneering arrogance of pride and contemptuous assurance,
the badge of his immeasurable good fortune. With cold, measuring
eyes of hate he looked at Starwick's soft and graceful throat,
the languid indolence of his soft, voluptuously graceful figure,
and with murderous calculation he thought: "How easy it would be
for me to twist that damned, soft neck of yours off your
shoulders! How easy it would be to take that damned, soft body in
my hands and break it like a rotten stick across my knees! Oh,
you damned, soft, pampered makeshift of a human being--you thing
of cunning tricks and words and accents--you synthetic imitation
of a living artist--you dear, damned darling of &aelig;sthetic
females--you Boston woman's lap-dog, you--"</p>

<p>The foul words thickened to a swelter of blind hate and murder
in his heart, and would not give him ease, or phrase the choking
and intolerable burden of his hate; the light of hate and murder
burned in his naked eye, curled his hands into two rending paws
of savage power in which he seemed to feel the substance of that
warm, soft throat between the strangling grip of his long
fingers; and all the time he felt hopelessly tricked, outwitted,
beaten by the very nakedness of his surrender to his hate, beaten
by something too subtle, soft and cunning for him ever to grasp,
by something which, for so it now seemed, would always beat him,
by something whose impossible good fortune it would always be to
take from him the thing he wanted most.</p>

<p>A thousand times he had foreseen this thing. A thousand times
he had foreseen, as young men will foresee, the coming of the
enemy--and always he had pictured him in a definite form and
guise. Always he had come, armed in insolence and power, badged
with the open menace of the jeering word, the sneering tongue,
the brandished fist. Always he had come to strike terror to the
heart with naked threat and open brag, to try to break the heart
and courage of another man, to win his jeering domination of
another's life, by violence and brutal courage. He had never come
by stealth but always by the frontal attack, and the youth, like
every youth alive, had sworn that he would be ready for him when
he came, would meet him fiercely and without retreat, and would
either conquer him or most desperately lie dead before he yielded
to the inexpiable shame of foul dishonour.</p>

<p>And now the enemy had come, but in no way that he had ever
known, in no guise that he had ever pictured. The enemy had come,
not armed in brutal might and open brag and from the front, but
subtle, soft, and infinitely cunning, and from a place, and in a
way that he had never foreseen. The enemy had come behind the
mask of friendship, he had come with words of praise, with
avowals of proud belief and noble confidence, in an attitude of
admiration and humility--had come in such a way, and even as he
spoke the words of praise and proud belief in him, had taken from
him what he wanted most in life, and had not seemed to take it,
or to want it, or to care.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Starwick and Elinor had quarrelled again: this time it was
because he too had decided to go back to Paris that afternoon. No
one but Elinor knew the purpose of his going; and that purpose,
whatever it was, did not please her. When Eugene entered the
dining-room for his last meal with them, they were at it hammer
and tongs, totally oblivious of the sensation they were causing
among the whispering and conspiring old men and women all about
them. Or, if not oblivious, they were indifferent to it: even in
their quarrels they kept their grand and rare and special
manner--a manner which more and more conceived the universe as an
appropriate backdrop for the subtle and romantic complications of
their own lives, and which, in its remote and lofty detachment
from the common run of man, said that here was an intercourse of
souls that was far too deep and rare for the dull conscience of
the world to apprehend.</p>

<p>Elinor was talking earnestly, positively, an accent rich, yet
sharp, cultivated, yet formidably assured, a well-mannered
authority, positive with denial and the conviction of
experience.</p>

<p>"You cannot do it! I tell you that you cannot <i>do</i> it!
You will come a cropper if you do!"</p>

<p>Starwick's face was flushed deeply with anger; he answered
quietly in a mannered tone filled with a sense of outrage and
indignation.</p>

<p>"I resent that <i>very</i> much," he said. "It is <i>very</i>
wrong and <i>very</i> unfair of you to speak that way! I
<i>resent</i> it!" he said quietly but with stern reproof.</p>

<p>"Sorry!" she clipped the word out curt and brusque, the way
the English say it. "If you resent it, you resent it--and that's
<i>that!</i> But after <i>all,</i> my dear, what else do you
expect? If you insist on bringing any little cut-throat you pick
up in a Montmartre bistro along with you everywhere you go, your
friends are going to complain about it! And they've a right
to!"</p>

<p>"I <i>resent</i> that <i>very</i> much!" he said again, in his
mannered tone.</p>

<p>"Sorry!" she said crisply, curtly, as before. "But that's the
way I feel about it!" She looked at him for a moment, and then,
suddenly shaking her head in a short and powerful movement, she
said in a whispering shudder of revulsion and disgust:</p>

<p>"No good, Frank! . . . I'm willing to make all the allowances
I can . . . but the man's no good--no good! . . . He just won't
do!" Her tone was the tone of a powerful New Englander, of
"fibre," character and breeding, putting the final dogma of his
judgment upon an inferior person who "just won't do."</p>

<p>And again, Starwick, two spots of bright colour burning in his
cheeks, said coldly, quietly, and with an inflexible
obstinacy:</p>

<p>"I resent that <i>very</i> much!"</p>

<p>He had apparently decided that Alec, the Frenchman they had
met in a Montmartre bar one night, and who had accompanied them
on most of their expeditions since, should be their guest in
their forthcoming travels over France. Moreover, with that
arrogant secretiveness that was characteristic of him, Frank had
made an appointment to meet the Frenchman in Paris that evening,
and had not until that morning informed anyone of his intentions.
This was the cause of the quarrel.</p>

<p>As Eugene entered, they looked up at him indifferently, and
resumed their quarrel; Ann came in a little later, sat down
without speaking, and began to eat in sullen silence. It was an
unpleasant meal. Elinor assumed her customary manner of gay,
light raillery, but this time, in powerful contrast to her
hilarious good spirits of the night before, she was full of spite
and malice--the angry desire of her tormented spirit to sting and
wound as if, by causing pain to others, she could in some measure
assuage her own.</p>

<p>"Darling," she said to Eugene, in her deft, malicious way, "I
do hope you're not going to forget all about me now that you're
deserting me? . . . Won't you write me now and then to cheer me
up? . . . Or is this going to be good-bye for ever! . . .
Because, darling, if it is, I want you to say so right out . . .
no matter how it hurts, I'd rather know the worst right now, so
that I can go out in the garden and eat worms, or howl, or beat
my head against the wall, or something," she said drolly, but
with a glint of spiteful motive in her eyes and in her smooth
tone that left no doubt of her intention.--"Won't you say it
ain't so, darling? . . . I mean, won't you remember me long
enough some time just to write a letter to me . . . I don't care
how short it is if you'll just write and let me know that you
still <i>care!"</i> she said maliciously. "Come on, darling," she
added coaxingly, leaning towards him, "say you will. . . .
Promise to write me just a little letter . . . just a
<i>teeny-weeny</i> little one like that," she measured drolly
between two fingers, and then, while he glared at her with a hot
face and angry eyes, she got in the instant, deft, decisive
stroke before he could think up an answer; and so concluded
it:</p>

<p>"Good!" she said swiftly, and patted him quickly, decisively,
on the arm: "God bless you, darling! I knew you would!"</p>

<p>They finished lunch in a sullen and unhappy silence. After
lunch Eugene went upstairs, packed and closed his valise and came
down and paid his bill. When he got outside, Elinor was sitting
in the car, waiting for him. Starwick had not yet come down.</p>

<p>"Put your suitcase in behind," she said curtly, "and do tell
Frank to hurry if he's coming. There's not much time."</p>

<p>"Where's Ann?" he said. "Is she coming with us to the
station?"</p>

<p>"My dear," she said coldly, "I haven't the remotest idea. Why
don't you ask her yourself if you want to know?"</p>

<p>He flushed again; and then with a feeling of painful
embarrassment and constraint, said:</p>

<p>"Elinor--if you don't mind--that is--I'd like--"</p>

<p>"What?" she said curtly, impatiently, and sharply, turning in
her seat and looking at him. "You'd like <i>what?"</i></p>

<p>"If you don't mind," he said, gulping with embarrassment, and
at the same moment enraged that he should feel so--</p>

<p>"--My money!" he blurted out.</p>

<p>"What? . . . What?" she demanded again, in a brusque, puzzled
tone. <i>"Oh!"</i> she cried with a sudden air of enlightenment.
"Your <i>money!</i> . . . You mean those express cheques you gave
me to keep for you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he said miserably, feeling an inexplicable shame and
embarrassment at having to ask for his own money, and inwardly
cursing the folly which, in the rush of affection that followed
their recent reconciliation, had caused him to give every cent he
had into her keeping--"if you don't mind--that is--"</p>

<p>"But of <i>course,</i> my child!" cried Elinor, with a fine
air of astonishment. "You shall have it at once!"--and opening
her purse she took out the thin little, black folder that
contained all the money he had left--three express cheques of
twenty-dollar denomination. "Here you are, sir!" she said, and
gave it to him in such a way that he felt again a sense of guilt
and shame as if he were acting meanly towards her or were taking
something that did not belong to him.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," he stammered apologetically, "--sorry to have to
ask you for it, Elinor--but you see it's all I've got left."</p>

<p>"It is?" she said curtly. "What did you do with all the rest
that you had when we met you?"</p>

<p>"I--I guess I spent it," he stammered.</p>

<p>The answer came, and buried itself in his heart, as quick, as
cold, as poisonous as a striking snake.</p>

<p>"You did?" she said curtly. "I wonder where. I'm sure you
didn't spend any of it while you were with <i>us."</i></p>

<p>He could have strangled her. The veins stood out upon his
forehead like cords, his face was brick-red, and for a moment he
went blind with the rush of hot, choking blood to his head. He
tried to speak, his throat worked convulsively, but no words
came: he just stood there goggling at her stupidly with an
inflamed face, uttering a few incoherent croaks. Before he could
think of anything to say, she had escaped again: Starwick and Ann
were coming out of the pension, and she was speaking to them
swiftly, telling them to make haste.</p>

<p>No one spoke during the ride to the station. He sat on the
back seat beside Ann and the big Alsatian dog; Starwick and
Elinor were in front. When they got to the station, the clock
still lacked more than five minutes to train-time. He and
Starwick bought third-class fares, and went outside where the
women were still waiting for them. Starwick and Elinor walked
away a few yards and began their quarrel again; Ann said nothing,
but looked at him dumbly, miserably, a look that tore at him with
pity and wild regret, and that made him weak and hollow with his
blind, impossible desire.</p>

<p>They looked at each other with angry, sullen eyes, tormented
with the perverse and headstrong pride of youth, unwilling to
make concessions or relent, even when each desperately wanted the
other to do so.</p>

<p>"Good-bye," he said, and held out his hand. "Good-bye,
Ann."</p>

<p>"What do you mean--?" she began angrily. "What are you going
to do?"</p>

<p>"I'm saying good-bye," he said doggedly.</p>

<p>"You mean you're not coming with us?"</p>

<p>For a moment he did not answer and then, nodding towards
Elinor, he said bitterly:</p>

<p>"Your lady friend there doesn't seem to want me very much. She
doesn't seem to think I bear my fair share of the expenses."</p>

<p>"What did she say to you?" the girl asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing," he said in a quiet, choking tone of fury.
"Nothing in particular. Just one of those friendly little things
I've come to look for. She just said she didn't know what I'd
done with my money--that I hadn't spent any of it while I was
with you."</p>

<p>Her face got brick-red with a heavy, smouldering flush, she
looked towards Elinor with angry eyes, and then muttered:</p>

<p>"It was a rotten thing to say!" Turning towards him again, she
said in a low tone:</p>

<p>"Do you mean, then, that you've given up the trip? You're not
coming with us?"</p>

<p>"That's what I've told you, isn't it?" he said harshly. "What
else do you expect?"</p>

<p>She looked at him sullenly, angrily, a moment longer; and
suddenly her eyes were wet with tears.</p>

<p>"It's going to be a fine trip for me, isn't it?" she muttered.
"I've got a lot to look forward to, haven't I?"</p>

<p>"Oh, you'll get along, I guess," he jeered. "I don't think
you're going to miss <i>my</i> company very much." And felt a
desperate hope that she would.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's going to be charming, charming, isn't it?" she said
bitterly. "Nothing to do but hold down the back seat alone with
the dog--while <i>they"</i>--she nodded towards Elinor and
Starwick--"are up there having their wonderful talks
together--leaving me alone to watch the dog while they stay out
all night together--oh, it's going to be simply wonderful, isn't
it?" she said with an infuriated sarcasm.</p>

<p>"So that's the reason I was wanted?" he said. "To keep you
company on the back seat! To take the place of the dog! To make
it look good, eh?--to make the party look a little more
respectable back in Boston when they hear of Mr. Starwick and his
two lady friends! That's why you wanted me, is it? To fill in
extra space--to be a kind of damned male nurse and chaperon to
you and Elinor and Frank Starwick--"</p>

<p>She took a step towards him and stopped, her hands clenched
beside her, her eyes shot with tears, her big body trembling for
a moment with baffled anger and despair.</p>

<p>"God-damn you!" she said in a small, choked voice; and, her
hands still clenched, she turned away abruptly to hide her
tears.</p>

<p>At this moment Starwick approached and, his ruddy face
flushing as he spoke, he said quietly, casually:</p>

<p>"Ann, look! Will you let me have a thousand francs?"</p>

<p>She turned round, glared at Starwick for a moment with angry,
reddened eyes and then, to his astonishment and her own, boomed
out comically and in an enraged tone:</p>

<p>"No--o!"</p>

<p>His face went crimson with embarrassment, but after looking at
her steadily for a moment, he turned, and walked back to Elinor.
In a moment she could be heard saying coldly:</p>

<p>". . . I am sorry, Francis, but I cannot! . . . You should
have thought about all that before! . . . If you won't stay out
here and go in with us tomorrow, you'll have to do the best you
can by yourself. . . . No, sir, I cannot . . . if you want to put
it that way, yes; I <i>won't</i> then! . . . I do not <i>like</i>
the man. . . . I <i>thoroughly</i> disapprove of what you're
doing. . . . I <i>will</i> not help you!"</p>

<p>Some low, excited words passed between them, and in a moment
Starwick said:</p>

<p>"You have no right to say that! I <i>resent</i> that
<i>very</i> much!"</p>

<p>His ruddy face was deeply flushed with anger and humiliation:
he turned abruptly on his heel and walked away without farewell.
At this moment the guards could be heard calling, "En voiture! En
voiture, messieurs!" and Elinor, glancing towards Ann and Eugene,
said curtly:</p>

<p>"If you're going to catch that train, you'll have to
hurry!"</p>

<p>Eugene turned to say good-bye to Ann; she paid no attention to
his outstretched hand but stood, her hands clenched, glaring
angrily at him with wet eyes.</p>

<p>"Good-bye!" he said roughly. "Aren't you going to say
good-bye?" She made no answer, but just stood glaring at him, and
then turned away.</p>

<p>"All right," he said angrily. "Do as you like!"</p>

<p>Without a word to Elinor, he picked up his valise, ran into
the station and got through the gates just as the little suburban
train began to move. Starwick was climbing up into a compartment,
Eugene followed him, flung his valise inside, and clambered in,
breathless, just as the guard with a remonstrant face slammed the
door behind him.</p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h1>LXXXVIII</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>During the journey back to Paris, Eugene and Starwick said
little. The two young men were the sole occupants of the
compartment, they sat facing each other, looking out through the
windows with gloomy eyes. The grey light of the short winter's
day was fading rapidly: when they entered Paris dusk had come; as
the train rattled over the switchpoints in the yard-approaches to
the Gare St. Lazare, they could see lights and life and sometimes
faces in the windows of the high, faded buildings near the
tracks. Through one window, in a moment's glimpse, Eugene saw a
room with a round table with a dark cloth upon it, and with the
light of a shaded chandelier falling on it, and a dark-haired boy
of ten or twelve leaning on the table, reading a book, with his
face propped in his hands, and a woman moving busily about the
table laying it with plates and knives and forks. And as the
train slackened speed, he saw, high up in the topmost floor of an
old house that rose straight up from the tracks, a woman come to
the window, look for a moment at a canary-bird cage which was
hanging in the window, reach up and take it from its hook. She
had the rough, blowsy, and somewhat old-fashioned look of a
<i>demi-monde</i> of the Renoir period; and yet she was like
someone he had known all his life.</p>

<p>They passed long strings of silent, darkened railway
compartments, and as they neared the station, several suburban
trains steamed past them, loaded with people going home. Some of
the trains were the queer little double-deckers that one sees in
France: Eugene felt like laughing every time he saw them and yet,
with their loads of Frenchmen going home, they too were like
something he had always known. As the train came into the
station, and slowed down to its halt, he could see a boat-train
ready for departure on another track. Sleek as a panther,
groomed, opulent, ready, purring softly as a cat, the train
waited there like a luxurious projectile, evoking perfectly, and
at once, the whole structure of the world of power and wealth and
pleasure that had created it. Beyond it one saw the whole
universe of pleasure--a world of great hotels and famed resorts,
the thrilling structure of the huge, white-breasted liners, and
the slanting race and drive of their terrific stacks. One saw
behind it the dark coast of France, the flash of beacons, the
grey, fortressed harbour walls, the bracelet of their hard, spare
lights, and beyond, beyond, one saw the infinite beat and swell
of stormy seas, the huge nocturnal slant and blaze of liners
racing through immensity, and for ever beyond, beyond, one saw
the faint, pale coasts of morning and America, and then the
spires and ramparts of the enfabled isle, the legendary and
aerial smoke, the stone and steel, of the terrific city.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Now their own train had come to a full stop, and he and
Starwick were walking up the quay among the buzzing crowd of
people.</p>

<p>Starwick turned and, flushing painfully, said in a constrained
and mannered tone:</p>

<p>"Look! Shall I being seeing you again?"</p>

<p>Eugene answered curtly: "I don't know. If you want to find me,
I suppose I shall be at the same place, for a time."</p>

<p>"And after that?--Where will you go?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," he answered brusquely again. "I haven't
thought about it yet. I've got to wait until I get money to go
away on."</p>

<p>The flush in Starwick's ruddy face deepened perceptibly, and,
after another pause, and with obvious embarrassment, he continued
as before:</p>

<p>"Look! Where are you going now?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, Francis," he said curtly. "To the hotel, I
suppose, to leave my suitcase and see if they've still got a room
for me. If I don't see you again, I'll say good-bye to you
now."</p>

<p>Starwick's embarrassment had become painful to watch; he did
not speak for another moment, then said:</p>

<p>"Look! Do you mind if I come along with you?"</p>

<p>He did mind; he wanted to be alone; to get away as soon as he
could from Starwick's presence and all the hateful memories it
evoked, but he said shortly:</p>

<p>"You can come along if you like, of course, but I see no
reason why you should. If you're going to the studio we can take
a taxi and you can drop me at the hotel. But if you're meeting
somebody over on this side later on, why don't you wait over here
for him?"</p>

<p>Starwick's face was flaming with shame and humiliation; he
seemed to have difficulty in pronouncing his words and when he
finally turned to speak, the other youth was shocked to see in
his eyes a kind of frantic, naked desperation.</p>

<p>"Then, look!" he said, and moistened his dry lips. "Could you
let me have some--some money, please?"</p>

<p>Something strangely like terror and entreaty looked out of his
eyes:</p>

<p>"I've <i>got</i> to have it," he said desperately.</p>

<p>"How much do you want?"</p>

<p>Starwick was silent, and then muttered:</p>

<p>"I could get along with 500 francs."</p>

<p>The other calculated swiftly: the sum amounted at the time to
about thirty dollars. It was almost half his total remaining
funds but--one look at the desperate humiliation and entreaty of
Starwick's face, and a surge of savage, vindictive joy swept
through him--it would be worth it.</p>

<p>"All right," he nodded briefly, and started to walk forward
again.</p>

<p>"You come with me while I leave this stuff at the hotel and
later on we'll see if we can't get these cheques cashed."</p>

<p>Starwick consented eagerly. From that time on, Eugene played
with him as a cat plays with a mouse. They got a taxi and were
driven across the Seine to his little hotel, he left Starwick
below while he went upstairs with his valise, promising to "be
down in a minute, after I've washed up a bit," and took a full
and lesiurely three-quarters of an hour. When he got downstairs,
Starwick's restless manner had increased perceptibly: he was
pacing up and down, smoking one cigarette after another. In the
same leisurely and maddening manner they left the hotel. Starwick
asked where they were going: Eugene replied cheerfully that they
were going to dinner at a modest little restaurant across the
Seine. By the time they had walked across the bridge, and through
the enormous arches of the Louvre, Starwick was gnawing his lips
with chagrin. In the restaurant Eugene ordered dinner and a
bottle of wine; Starwick refused to eat, Eugene expressed regret
and pursued his meal deliberately. By the time he had finished,
and was cracking nuts, Starwick was almost frantic. He demanded
impatiently to know where they were going, and the other answered
chidingly:</p>

<p>"Now, Frank, what's the hurry? You've got the whole night
ahead of you: there's no rush at all. . . . Besides, why not stay
here a while? It's a good place. Don't you think so? I discovered
it all by myself!"</p>

<p>Starwick looked about him, and said:</p>

<p>"Yes, the place is all right, I suppose, the food looks
good--it really does, you know--but <i>God!"</i> he snarled
bitterly, "how dull! how dull!"</p>

<p><i>"Dull?"</i> Eugene said chidingly, and with an air of fine
astonishment. "Frank, Frank, such language--and from <i>you!</i>
Is this the poet and the artist, the man of feeling and of
understanding, the lover of humanity? Is this <i>grand,</i> is
this <i>fine</i>, is this <i>swell?"</i> he jeered. "Is this the
lover of the French--the man who's more at home here than he is
at home? Why, Frank, this is unworthy of you: I thought that
every breath you drew was saturated with the love of France. I
thought that every pulse-beat of your artist's soul beat in
sympathy with the people of this noble country. I thought that
you would love this place--find it <i>simply swell,"</i> he
sneered, "and <i>very</i> grand and <i>most</i> amusing--and here
you turn your nose up at the people and call them dull--as if
they were a lot of damned Americans! <i>Dull!</i> How can they be
<i>dull,</i> Frank? Don't you see they're <i>French? . . .</i>
Now this boy here, for example," he pointed to a bus-boy of
eighteen years who was noisily busy piling dishes from a table on
to a tray.--"Isn't he a <i>sweet</i> person, Frank?" he went on
with an evil, jeering mimicry--"and there's something <i>very</i>
grand and <i>enormously</i> moving about the way he piles those
dishes on a tray," he continued with a deliberate parody of
Starwick's mannered accent. "--I <i>mean,</i> the whole thing's
there--it really is, you know--it's like that painting by Cimabue
in the Louvre that we both like so much--you know the one of the
Madonna with the little madonnas all around her.--I mean the way
he uses his hands--Look!" he crooned rapturously as the bus-boy
took a thick, blunt finger and vigorously wiped his rheumy nose
with it. "--Now where, <i>where,</i> Frank," he said
ecstatically, "could you find anything like that in America? I
<i>mean,</i> the <i>grace,</i> the <i>dignity,</i> the complete
unselfconsciousness with which that boy just wiped his nose
across his finger--or his finger across his nose--Hah! hah!
hah!--I get all confused, Frank--<i>really!</i>--the movement is
so beautiful and fluid--it's hard to say just which is
which--which does the <i>wiping</i>--nose or finger--I mean, the
whole thing's <i>quite</i> incredible--and <i>most</i>
astonishing--the way it comes back on itself: it's like a
<i>fugue,</i> you know," and looking at the other earnestly, he
said deeply: "You see what I mean, don't you?"</p>

<p>Starwick's face had flamed crimson during the course of this
jeering parody: he returned the other's look with hard eyes, and
said with cold succinctness:</p>

<p>"Quite! . . . If you don't mind, could we go along now
and,"--his flush deepened and he concluded with painful
difficulty, ". . . and . . . and do what you said you would?"</p>

<p>"But of <i>course</i>!<i>"</i> the other cried, with another
parody of Starwick's tone and manner. "At once! Immediately!
<i>Tout de suite! . . .</i> as we say over here! . . . Now,
<i>there</i> you are!" he said enthusiastically. <i>"There</i>
you are, Frank! . . . <i>Tout de suite!"</i> he murmured
rapturously. <i>"Tout de suite! . . .</i> Not 'at once!' Not
'right away!' Not 'immediately!' But <i>tout de suite! . . .</i>
Ah, Frank, how different from our own coarse tongue! Quel charme!
Quelle musique! Quelle originalit&eacute;! . . . I <i>mean,</i>
the whole thing's there! . . . It really is, you know!"</p>

<p>"Quite!" said Starwick as before, and looked at him with hard,
embittered eyes. "Could we go now?"</p>

<p>"Mais oui, mais oui, mon ami! . . . But first, I want you to
meet yon noble youth who wipes his nose with such a simple
unaffected dignity, and is, withal, so <i>French</i> about it! .
. . I know him well, we artists have the common touch, n'est-ce
pas? Many a time and oft have we talked together. . . . Why,
Frank, you're going to love him like a brother . . . the whole,
great heart of France is beating underneath that waiter's jacket
. . . and, ah! such grace, such flashing rapier-work of Gallic
wit, such quick intelligence and humour. . . . Ecoutez,
gar&ccedil;on!" he called; the boy turned, startled, and then,
seeing the young men, his thick lips slowly wreathed themselves
in a smile of amiable stupidity. He came towards them smiling
eagerly, a clumsy boy of eighteen years with the thick features,
the dry, thick lips, the blunted, meaty hands and encrusted nails
of the peasant. It was a face of slow, wondering intelligence,
thick-witted, unperceptive, flushed with strong, dark colour,
full of patient earnestness, and animal good-nature.</p>

<p>"Bonsoir, monsieur," he said, as he came up. "Vous
d&eacute;sirez quelque chose?" And he grinned at them slowly,
with a puzzled, trustful stare.</p>

<p>"But yes, my boy! . . . I have been telling my friend about
you, and he wants to meet you. He is, like me, an American . . .
but a true friend of France. And so I told him how you loved
America!"</p>

<p>"But yes, but yes!" the boy cried earnestly, clutching eagerly
at the suggestion. "La France and l'Am&eacute;rique are of the
true friends, n'est-ce pas, monsieur?"</p>

<p>"You have reason! It's as you say!"</p>

<p>"Vashingtawn!" the boy cried suddenly, with a burst of happy
inspiration.</p>

<p>"But yes! But yes! . . . Lafayette!" the other yelled
enthusiastically.</p>

<p>"Pair-<i>shing!"</i> the boy cried rapturously. "La France et
l'Am&eacute;rique!" he passionately proclaimed, and he turned
slowly to Starwick, joined his thick, blunt fingers together, and
thrusting them under Starwick's nose, nodded his thick head
vigorously and cried: "C'est comme &ccedil;a! . . . La France et
l'Am&eacute;rique!"--he shook his thick joined fingers vigorously
under Starwick's nose again, and said: "Mais oui! Mais oui! . . .
C'est toujours comme &ccedil;a!"</p>

<p>"Oh, my God!" groaned Starwick, turning away, "how dull! How
utterly, <i>unspeakably</i> dreary!"</p>

<p>"Monsieur?" the boy spoke inquiringly, and turned blunt,
puzzled features at Starwick's dejected back.</p>

<p>Starwick's only answer was another groan: flinging a limp arm
over the back of his chair, he slumped in an attitude of
exhausted weariness. The boy turned a patient, troubled face to
the other youth, who said, in an explanatory way:</p>

<p>"He is profoundly moved. . . . What you have said has touched
him deeply!"</p>

<p>"Ah-h!" the boy cried, with an air of sudden, happy
enlightenment, and thus inspired, began with renewed ardour, and
many a vigorous wag of his thick and earnest beak, to
proclaim:</p>

<p>"Mais c'est vrai! C'est comme je dis! . . . La France et
l'Am&eacute;rique--" he intoned anew.</p>

<p>"Oh, God!" groaned Starwick without turning, and waved a
feeble and defeated arm. "Tell him to go away!"</p>

<p>"He is deeply moved! He says he can stand no more!"</p>

<p>The boy cast an earnest and immensely gratified look at
Starwick's dejected back, and was on the point of pushing his
triumph farther when the proprietor angrily called to him,
bidding him be about his work and leave the gentlemen in
peace.</p>

<p>He departed with obvious reluctance, but not without
vigorously nodding his thick head again, proclaiming that "La
France et l'Am&eacute;rique sont comme &ccedil;a!" and shaking
his thick, clasped fingers earnestly in a farewell gesture of
racial amity.</p>

<p>When he had gone, Starwick looked round wearily, and in a
dispirited tone said:</p>

<p>"God! What a place! How did you ever find it? . . . And how do
you manage to stand it?"</p>

<p>"But look at him, Frank . . . I mean, don't you just
<i>lo-o-ve</i> it?" he jibed. "I mean, there's something so
<i>grand</i> and so <i>simple</i> and so <i>unaffected</i> about
the way he did it! It's really <i>quite</i> astonishing! It
really is, you know!"</p>

<p>The poor bus-boy, indeed, had been intoxicated by his sudden
and unaccustomed success. Now, as he continued his work of
clearing tables and stacking dishes on a tray, he could be seen
nodding his thick head vigorously and muttering to himself: "Mais
oui, mais oui, monsieur! . . . La France et l'Am&eacute;rique. .
. . Nous sommes de vrais amis!" and from time to time he would
even pause in his work to clasp his thick fingers together
illustrating this and to mutter: "C'est toujours comme
&ccedil;a!"</p>

<p>This preoccupied elation soon proved the poor boy's undoing.
For even as he lifted his loaded tray and balanced it on one
thick palm he muttered "C'est comme &ccedil;a," again, making a
recklessly inclusive gesture with his free hand; the
mountainously balanced tray was thrown off balance, he made a
desperate effort to retrieve it, and as it crashed upon the floor
he pawed frantically and sprawled after it, in one general
ruinous smash of broken crockery.</p>

<p>There was a maddened scream from the proprietor. He came
running clumsily, a squat, thick figure of a bourgeois Frenchman,
clothed in black and screaming imprecations. His moustaches
bristled like the quills of an enraged porcupine, and his ruddy
face was swollen and suffused, an apoplectic red:</p>

<p>"Brute! Fool! Imbecile!" he screamed as the frightened boy
clambered to his feet and stood staring at him with a face full
of foolish and helpless bewilderment. ". . . Salaud! . . . Pig .
. . Architect!" he screamed out this meaningless curse in a
strangling voice, and rushing at the boy cuffed him clumsily on
the side of the face and began to thrust and drive him before him
in staggering lunges.</p>

<p>"--And what grace, Frank!" Eugene now said cruelly. "How
<i>grand</i> and <i>simple</i> and how unselfconscious they are
in everything they do! I <i>mean,</i> the way they use their
hands!" he said ironically, as the maddened proprietor gave the
unfortunate boy another ugly, clumsy shove that sent him
headlong. "I <i>mean,</i> it's like a fugue--like Cimabue or an
early primitive--it really is, you know--"</p>

<p>"Assassin! Criminal!" the proprietor screamed at this moment,
and gave the weeping boy a brutal shove that sent him sprawling
forward upon his hands and knees:</p>

<p>"Traitor! Mis&eacute;rable sc&eacute;l&eacute;rat!" he
screamed, and kicked clumsily at the prostrate boy with one fat
leg.</p>

<p>"Now where?--where?" Eugene said maliciously, as the wretched
boy clambered to his feet, weeping bitterly, "--where, Francis,
could you see anything like that in America?"</p>

<p>"God!" said Starwick, getting up. "It's unspeakable!" And
desperately: "Let's go!"</p>

<p>They paid the bill and went out. As they went down the stairs
they could still hear the hoarse, choked sobs of the bus-boy, his
thick face covered with his thick, blunt fingers, crying
bitterly.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>He didn't know what Starwick wanted the money for, but it was
plain he wanted it for something, badly. His agitation was
pitiable:--the bitter exasperation and open flare of temper he
had displayed once or twice in the restaurant was so unnatural to
him that it was evident his nerves were being badly rasped by the
long delay. Now, he kept consulting his watch nervously: he
turned, and looking at Eugene with a quiet but deep resentment in
his eyes, he said:</p>

<p>"Look. If you're going to let me have the money, I wish you'd
let me have it now--please. Otherwise, I shall not need it."</p>

<p>And Eugene, touched with a feeling of guilt at the deep and
quiet resentment in his companion's face, knowing he had promised
him the money and feeling that this taunting procrastination was
ungenerous and mean, said roughly:</p>

<p>"All right, come on. You can have it right away."</p>

<p>They turned into the Rue St. Honor&eacute;, turned again, and
walked to the Place Vend&ocirc;me, where there was a small
exchange office--or "all-night bank"--where travellers' cheques
were cashed. They entered, he cashed his three remaining cheques:
the amount was something over 900 francs. He counted the money,
kept out 500 francs for Starwick, stuffed the rest into his
pocket, and, turning, thrust the little sheaf of banknotes into
Starwick's hand, saying brutally:</p>

<p>"There's you money, Frank. And now, good-bye to you. I needn't
detain you any longer."</p>

<p>He turned to go, but the implication of his sneer had not gone
unnoticed:</p>

<p>"Just a minute," Starwick's quiet voice halted him. "What did
you mean by that?"</p>

<p>He paused, with a slow thick anger beating in his veins:</p>

<p>"By what?"</p>

<p>"By saying you needn't detain me any longer?"</p>

<p>"You got what you wanted, didn't you?"</p>

<p>"You mean the money?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Starwick looked quietly at him a moment longer, then thrust
the little roll of banknotes back into his hand.</p>

<p>"Take it," he said.</p>

<p>For a moment the other could not speak. A murderous fury
choked him: he ground his teeth together, and clenched his fist,
he felt a moment's almost insane desire to grip that soft throat
with his strangling hand and beat the face into a bloody jelly
with his fist.</p>

<p>"Why, God-damn you--" he grated between clenched teeth.
"Goddamn you for a--!" He turned away, saying harshly: "To hell
with you! . . . I'm through!"</p>

<p>He began to walk away across the Square at a savage stride. He
heard footsteps following him: near the corner of the Rue St.
Honor&eacute; Starwick caught up with him and said doggedly:</p>

<p>"No, but I'm going with you! . . . I really <i>must,</i> you
know!" His voice rose and became high, almost womanish, with his
passionate declaration: "If there's anything between you and me
that has to be settled before you go away, you can't leave it
like this . . . we've got to have it out, you know . . . we
really must!"</p>

<p>The other youth stood stock-still for a moment. Every atom of
him--blood, bone, the beating of his heart, the substance of his
flesh--seemed to congeal in a paralysis of cold murder. He licked
his dry lips and said thickly:</p>

<p>"Have it out!"--The blood swarmed through him in a choking
flood, it seemed instantly to rush down through his hands and to
fill him with a savage, rending strength, the curse was torn from
him in a bestial cry and snarling:</p>

<p>"Have it out! Why, you damned rascal, we'll have it out, all
right! We'll have it out, you dirty little fairy--" The foul word
was out at last, in one blind expletive of murderous hate, and
suddenly that tortured, impossibly tangled web of hatred,
failure, and despair found its release. He reached out, caught
Starwick by the throat and collar of his shirt, and endowed with
that immense, incalculable strength which hatred and the sudden
lust to kill can give a man, he lifted the slight figure from the
ground as if it were a bundle of rags and sticks, and slammed it
back against the fa&ccedil;ade of a building with such brutal
violence that Starwick's head bounced and rattled on the stone.
The blow knocked Starwick senseless: his hat went flying from his
head, his cane fell from his grasp and rattled on the pavement
with a hard, lean clatter. For a moment, his eyes rolled back and
forth with the wooden, weighted movement of a doll's. Then, as
Eugene released his grip, his legs buckled at the knees, his eyes
closed and his head sagged, and he began to slump down towards
the pavement, his back sliding all the time against the wall.</p>

<p>He would have fallen if Eugene had not caught him, held him,
propped him up against the wall, until he could recover. And at
that moment, Eugene felt an instant, overwhelming revulsion of
shame, despair, and sick horror, such as he had never known
before. For a moment all the blood seemed to have drained out of
his heart and left it a dead shell. He thought he had killed
Starwick--broken his neck or fractured his skull: even in
death--or unconsciousness--Starwick's frail body retained its
languorous dignity and grace. His head dropped heavily to one
side, the buckling weight of the unconscious figure slumped in a
movement of terrible and beautiful repose--the same movement that
one sees in a great painting of Christ lowered from the cross, as
if, indeed, the whole rhythm, balance and design of that art
which Starwick had observed with such impassioned mimicry had
left its image indelibly upon his own life, so that, even in
death or senselessness, his body would portray it.</p>

<p>At that moment the measure of ruin and defeat which the other
young man felt was overwhelming. It seemed to him that if he had
deliberately contrived to crown a ruinous career by the most
shameful and calamitous act of all, he could not have been guilty
of a worse crime than the one he had just committed. It was not
merely the desperate, sickening terror in his heart when he
thought that Starwick might be dead--that he had killed him. It
was even more than this, a sense of profanation, a sense of
having done something so foul and abominable that he could never
recover from it, never wash its taint out of his blood. There are
some people who possess such a natural dignity of person--such a
strange and rare inviolability of flesh and spirit--that any
familiarity, any insult, above all any act of violence upon them,
is unthinkable. If such an insult be intended, if such violence
be done, the act returns a thousandfold upon the one who does it:
his own blow returns to deal a terrible revenge; he will relive
his crime a thousand times in all the shame and terror of
inexpiable memory.</p>

<p>Starwick was such a person: he had this quality of personal
inviolability more than anyone the other youth had ever known.
And now, as he stood there holding Starwick propped against the
wall, calling him by name, shaking him and pleading with him to
recover consciousness, his feeling of shame, despair, and bitter
ruinous defeat was abysmal, irremediable. It seemed to him that
he could have done nothing which would more have emphasized his
enemy's superiority and his own defeat than this thing which he
had done. And the feeling that Starwick would always beat him,
always take from him the thing he wanted most, that by no means
could he ever match the other youth in any way, gain even the
most trifling victory, was now overpowering in its horror. With a
sick and bitter heart of misery, he cursed the wretched folly of
his act. He would willingly have cut off his hand--the hand that
gave the blow--if by so doing he could undo his act, but he knew
that it was now too late, and with a feeling of blind terror he
reflected that this knowledge of his defeat and fear was now
Starwick's also, and that as long as Starwick lived, he would
always know about it, and realize from this alone the full
measure of his victory. And this feeling of shame, horror, and
abysmal, inexpiable regret persisted even after, with a feeling
of sick relief, he saw Starwick's eyes flutter, open, and after a
moment of vague, confused bewilderment, look at him with a quiet
consciousness.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, his feeling of relief was unspeakable. He bent,
picked up Starwick's hat and cane, and gave them to him, saying
quietly:</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, Frank."</p>

<p>Starwick put on his hat and took the cane in his hand.</p>

<p>"It doesn't matter. If that's the way you felt, you had to do
it," he said in a quiet, toneless and inflexible voice. "But now,
before we leave each other, we must see this through. We've got
to bring this thing into the open, find out what it is. That
<i>must</i> be done, you know!" His voice had risen with an
accent of inflexible resolve, an accent which the other had heard
before, and which he knew no fear of death or violence or any
desperate consequence could ever alter by a jot. "I've got to
understand what this thing is before I leave you," Starwick said.
"That must be done."</p>

<p>"All right!" Eugene said blindly, desperately. "Come on,
then!"</p>

<p>And together, they strode along in silence, along the empty
pavements of the Rue St. Honor&eacute;, past shuttered shops, and
old, silent buildings which seemed to abide there and attend upon
the anguish of tormented youth with all the infinite, cruel, and
impassive silence of dark time, the unspeakable chronicle of
foregone centuries, the unspeakable anguish, grief, and
desperation of a million vanished, nameless, and forgotten
lives.</p>

<p>And thus, in bitter shame and silence and despair, the
demented, drunken, carnal, and kaleidoscopic circuit of the night
began.</p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h1>LXXXIX</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>About ten o'clock the next morning someone knocked at Eugene's
door, and Starwick walked in. Without referring to the night
before, Starwick immediately, in his casual and abrupt way,
said:</p>

<p>"Look. Elinor and Ann are here: they came in this
morning."</p>

<p>"Where are they?" Excitement, sharp and sudden as an electric
shock, shot through him. "Here? Downstairs?"</p>

<p>"No: they've gone shopping. I'm meeting them at Prunier's for
lunch. Ann said she might come by to see you later on."</p>

<p>"Before lunch?"</p>

<p>"Ace," said Starwick. "Look," he said again, in his casual,
mannered tone, "I don't suppose you'd care to come to lunch with
us?"</p>

<p>"Thanks," Eugene answered stiffly, "but I can't. I've got
another engagement."</p>

<p>Starwick's face flushed crimson with the agonizing shyness and
embarrassment which the effort cost him. He leaned upon his cane
and looked out of the window as he spoke.</p>

<p>"Then, look," he said, "Elinor asks to be remembered to you."
He was silent a moment, and then continued with painful
difficulty: "We're all going to the Louvre after lunch: I want to
see the Cimabue once more before we leave."</p>

<p>"When are you leaving?"</p>

<p>"Tomorrow," Starwick said. "--Look!" he spoke carefully,
looking out of the window, "we're leaving the Louvre at four
o'clock. . . . I thought . . . if you were going to be over that
way. . . . I think Elinor would like to see you before she goes.
. . . We'll be there at the main entrance." The anguish which the
effort had cost him was apparent: he kept looking away out of the
window, leaning on his cane, and for a moment his ruddy face was
contorted by the old, bestial grimace of inarticulate pain and
grief which the other had noticed the first time they had met, in
Cambridge, years before. Then Starwick, without glancing at
Eugene, turned towards the door. For a moment he stood, back
turned, idly tapping with his cane against the wall.</p>

<p>"It would be nice if you could meet us there. If not--"</p>

<p>He turned, and for the last time in life the two young men
looked squarely at one another, and each let the other see,
without evasion or constraint, the image of his soul. Henceforth,
each might glimpse from time to time some shadow-flicker of the
other's life, the destiny of each would curiously be interwoven
through twinings of dark chance and tragic circumstance, but they
would never see each other face to face again.</p>

<p>Now, looking steadily at him before he spoke, and with the
deep conviction of his spirit, the true image of his life,
apparent in his face, his eyes, his tone and manner, Starwick
said:</p>

<p>"If I don't see you again, good-bye, Eugene." He was silent
for a moment and, the colour flaming in his face from the depth
and earnestness of his feeling, he said quietly: "It was good to
have known you. I shall never forget you."</p>

<p>"Nor I you, Frank," the other said. "No matter what has
happened--how we feel about each other now--you had a place in my
life that no one else has ever had."</p>

<p>"And what was that?" said Starwick.</p>

<p>"I think it was that you were young--my own age--and that you
were my friend. Last night after--after that thing happened," he
went on, his own face flushing with the pain of memory, "I
thought back over all the time since I have known you. And for
the first time I realized that you were the first and only person
of my own age that I could call my friend. You were my one true
friend--the one I always turned to, believed in with
unquestioning devotion. You were the only real friend that I ever
had. Now something else has happened. You have taken from me
something that I wanted, you have taken it without knowing that
you took it, and it will always be like this. You were my brother
and my friend--"</p>

<p>"And now?" said Starwick quietly.</p>

<p>"You are my mortal enemy. Good-bye."</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Eugene," said Starwick sadly. "But let me tell you
this before I go. Whatever it was I took from you, it was
something that I did not want or wish to take. And I would give
it back again if I could."</p>

<p>"Oh, fortunate and favoured Starwick," the other jeered. "To
be so rich--to have such gifts and not to know he has them--to be
for ever victorious, and to be so meek and mild."</p>

<p>"And I will tell you this as well," Starwick continued.
"Whatever anguish and suffering this mad hunger, this impossible
desire, has caused you, however fortunate or favoured you may
think I am, I would give my whole life if I could change places
with you for an hour--know for an hour an atom of your anguish
and your hunger and your hope. . . . Oh, to feel so, suffer so,
and live so!--however mistaken you may be! . . . To have come
lusty, young, and living into this world . . . not to have come,
like me, still-born from your mother's womb--never to know the
dead heart and the passionless passion--the cold brain and the
cold hopelessness of hope--to be wild, mad, furious, and
tormented--but to have belief, to live in anguish, but to
live--and not to die." . . . He turned and opened the door. I
would give all I have and all you think I have, for just one hour
of it. You call me fortunate and happy. <i>You</i> are the most
fortunate and happy man I ever knew. Good-bye, Eugene."</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Frank. Good-bye, my enemy."</p>

<p>"And good-bye, my friend," said Starwick. He went out, and the
door closed behind him.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Eugene was waiting for them at four o'clock that afternoon
when they came out from the Louvre. As he saw them coming down
the steps together he felt a sudden, blind rush of affection for
all of them, and saw that all of them were fine people. Elinor
came towards him instantly, and spoke to him warmly, kindly, and
sincerely, without a trace of mannerism or affectation or
concealed spitefulness. Starwick stood by quietly while he talked
to Elinor: Ann looked on sullenly and dumbly and thrust her hands
in the pockets of her fur jacket. In the dull, grey light they
looked like handsome, first-rate, dignified people, who had
nothing mean or petty in them and with whom nothing but a
spacious, high and generous kind of life was possible. By
comparison, the Frenchmen coming from the museum and streaming
past them looked squalid and provincial; and the Americans and
other foreigners had a shabby, dull, inferior look. For a moment
the bitter and passionate enigma of life pierced him with
desperation and wild hope. What was wrong with life? What got
into people such as these to taint their essential quality, to
twist and warp and mutilate their genuine and higher purposes?
What were these perverse and evil demons of cruelty and
destructiveness, of anguish, error and confusion that got into
them, that seemed to goad them on, with a wicked and ruinous
obstinacy, deliberately to do the things they did not want to
do--the things that were so shamefully unworthy of their true
character and their real desire?</p>

<p>It was maddening because it was so ruinous, so wasteful and so
useless; and because it was inexplicable. As these three
wonderful, rare and even beautiful people stood there saying to
him good-bye, every movement, look, and word they uttered was
eloquent with the quiet but passionate and impregnable conviction
of the human faith. Their quiet, serious, and affectionate eyes,
their gestures, their plain, clear, and yet affectionate speech,
even the instinctive tenderness that they felt towards one
another which seemed to join them with a unity of living warmth
and was evident in the way they stood, glanced at each other, or
in swift, instinctive gestures--all this with a radiant, clear,
and naked loveliness seemed to speak out of them in words no one
could misunderstand, to say:</p>

<p>"Always there comes a moment such as this when, poised here
upon the ledge of furious strife, we stand and look; the
marsh-veil shifts from the enfevered swamp, the phantoms are
dispersed like painted smoke, and standing here together, friend,
we all see clear again, our souls are tranquil and our hearts are
quiet--and we have what we have, we know what we know, we are
what we are."</p>

<p>It seemed to him that all these people now had come to such a
moment that this clear peace and knowledge rested in their hearts
and spoke out of their eyes; it seemed to him that all his life,
for years, since he had first gone to the dark North and known
cities--since he had first known Starwick--was now a phantasmal
nightmare--a kaleidoscope of blind, furious days, and drunken and
diverted nights, the measureless sea-depth of incalculable
memory, an atom lost and battered in a world of monstrous shapes,
and deafened in a word of senseless, stupefying war and movement
and blind fury. And it seemed to him now that for the first time
he--and all of them--had come to a moment of clarity and repose,
and that for the first time their hearts saw and spoke the truth
that lies buried in all men, that all men know.</p>

<p>Elinor had taken him by the hand and was saying quietly:</p>

<p>"I am sorry that you will not go with us. We have had a
strange and hard and desperate time together, but that is over
now, Eugene: we have all been full of pain and trouble, and all
of us are sorry for the things we've done. I want you to know
that we all love you, and will always think of you with
friendship, as our friend, and will hope that you are happy, and
will rejoice in your success as if it were our own. . . . And
now, good-bye, my dear; try to think of us always as we think of
you--with love and kindness. Do not forget us; always remember us
with a good memory, the way we shall remember you. . . .
Perhaps"--for a moment her face was touched with her gay, rueful
smile--"perhaps when I'm an old Boston lady with a cat, a parrot,
and a canary, you will come to see me. I will be a nice old lady,
then--but also I will be a ruined old lady--for they don't
forget--not in a lifetime, not in Boston--and this time, darling,
I have gone too far. So I shan't have many callers, I shall leave
them all alone--and if you're not too rich, too famous, and too
proper by that time, perhaps you'll come to see me. . . . Now,
good-bye."</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Elinor," he said. "And good luck to you."</p>

<p>"Look," said Starwick quietly, "we're going on--Elinor and I .
. . I thought . . . if you're not doing anything else . . .
perhaps you and Ann might have dinner together."</p>

<p>"I'm--I'm not," he stammered, looking at Ann, "but maybe you .
. ."</p>

<p>"No," she muttered, staring sullenly and miserably at the
ground. "I'm not either."</p>

<p>"Then," Starwick said, "we'll see you later, Ann. . . . And
good-bye, Eugene."</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Frank."</p>

<p>They shook hands together for the last time, and Starwick and
Elinor turned and walked away. Thus, with such brief and casual
words, the bond of friendship--all of the faith, belief and
passionate avowal of their youth--was for ever broken. They saw
each other once thereafter: by chance their lives would have
strange crossings; but they never spoke to each other again.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>They waited in awkward silence for a moment until they saw
Starwick and Elinor get into a taxi and drive off. Then they
walked away together across the great quadrangle of the Louvre. A
haze of bluish mist, soft, smoky as a veil, hung in the air
across the vista'd sweep of the Tuileries and the Place de la
Concorde. The little taxis drilled across the great space between
the vast wings of the Louvre and through the arches, filling the
air with wasp-like drone and menace, the shrill excitement of
their tootling horns. And through that veil of bluish haze the
vast mysterious voice of Paris reached their ears: it was a sound
immense and murmurous as time, fused of the strident clamours of
its four million subjects, and yet, strangely muted, seductive,
sensuous, cruel and thrilling, filled with life and death. The
mysterious fragrance of that life filled Eugene with the potent
intoxication of its magic. He drew the pungent smoky air into his
lungs, and it seemed freighted with the subtle incense of the
great city's hope and secret promise, with grief and joy and
terror, with a wild and nameless hunger, with intolerable desire.
It numbed his entrails and his loins with sensual prescience, and
it made his heart beat hard and fast; his breath came quickly: it
was mixed into the pulses of his blood and gave to grief and joy
and sorrow the wild mixed anguish beating in his heart, its
single magic, its impalpable desire.</p>

<p>They walked slowly across the great Louvre court and through
the gigantic masonries of the arch into the Rue de Rivoli. The
street was swarming with its dense web of afternoon: the sensuous
complications of its life and traffic, the vast honeycomb of
business and desire; the street was jammed with its brilliant
snarl of motors, with shout and horn and cry, and with the
throbbing menace of machinery, and on the other side, beneath
arched colonnades, the crowd was swarming in unceasing flow.</p>

<p>They crossed the street and made their way through a thronging
maze into the Place de la Com&eacute;die Fran&ccedil;aise, and
found a table on the terrace of La R&eacute;gence. The pleasant
old caf&eacute; was gay with all its chattering groups of
afternoon, and yet, after the great boil and fury of the streets,
it was strangely calm, detached, and pleasant, too. The little
separate verandahs of its terrace, the tables and the old settees
and walls, gave the caf&eacute; an incredibly familiar and
intimate quality, as if one were seated in a pleasant booth that
looked out on life, a box in an old theatre whose stage was the
whole world.</p>

<p>In one of the friendly booth-like verandahs of this pleasant
old caf&eacute; they found a table in a corner, seats against the
wall, and sat down and gave their order to the waiter. Then, for
some time, as they drank their brandy, they looked out at the
flashing pulsations of the street, and did not speak.</p>

<p>Presently Ann, without looking at him, in her level, curt, and
almost grimly toneless speech, said:</p>

<p>"What did you and Frank do last night?"</p>

<p>Excitement caught him; his pulse beat faster; he glanced
quickly at her, and said:</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing. We went out to eat, walked round a bit: that was
all."</p>

<p>"Out all night?" she said curtly.</p>

<p>"No. I turned in early. I was home by twelve o'clock."</p>

<p>"What happened to Frank?"</p>

<p>He looked at her sharply, startled. "Happened? What do you
mean--'what happened to him?'"</p>

<p>"What did he do when you went home?"</p>

<p>"How should I know? He went back to the studio, I suppose. Why
do you want to know?"</p>

<p>She made no answer for a moment, but sat looking sullenly into
the street. When she spoke again, she did not look at him, her
voice was level, hard, and cold, quietly, grimly
inflectionless.</p>

<p>"Do you think it's a very manly thing for a big hulking fellow
like you to jump on a boy Frank's size?"</p>

<p>Hot fury choked him, passed before his vision in a blinding
flood. He ground his teeth, rocked gently back and forth, and
said in a small, stopped voice:</p>

<p>"Oh, so he told you, did he? He had to come whining to you
about it, did he? The damned little . . . !"</p>

<p>"He told us nothing," she said curtly. "Frank's not that kind;
he doesn't whine. Only, we couldn't help noticing a lump on the
back of his head the size of a goose egg, and it didn't take me
long to figure out the rest." She turned and looked at him with a
straight, unrelenting stare, and then said harshly:</p>

<p>"It was a wonderful thing to do, wasn't it? I suppose you
think that settles everything. You can be proud of yourself now,
can't you?"</p>

<p>The thin fine blade of cruel jealousy pierced him suddenly and
was twisted in his heart. In a voice trembling with all the
sweltering anguish and defeat that packed his overladen heart, he
sneered in bitter parody:</p>

<p>"Come now, Frankie, dear!--Did bad naughty mans crack little
Frankie's precious head?--There, there, dearie!--Mamma kiss and
make it well . . . let nice big nursey-worsey kiss-um and make-um
well!--Next time Frankie-pankie goes for a walk, big Boston
nursey Ann will go wiv-ems, won't she, pet, to see that wuff,
wuff man leave poor little Frankie be."</p>

<p>She reddened angrily, and said:</p>

<p>"No one's trying to be Frankie's nurse. He doesn't need it,
and he doesn't want it. Only, I think it's a rotten shame that a
big hulking lout like you should have no more decency than to
maul around as fine a person as Frank is. You ought to be ashamed
of yourself; it was a rotten thing to do!"</p>

<p>"Why, you bitch!" he said slowly, in a low, strangled tone.
"You nice, neat, eighteen-carat jewel of a snobby Boston
bitch!--Go back to Boston where you came from!" he snarled.
"That's where you belong; that's all you're worth. . . . So I'm a
big, hulking lout, am I? And that damned little affected
&aelig;sthete's the finest person that you ever knew!--Why,
God-damn the lot of you for the cheap, lying, fakey Boston
bitches that you are!--with your 'he's a <i>swell</i> person, he
really is, you know,'--'Oh, <i>grand</i>! Oh, <i>swell!</i> Oh,
<i>fine!</i>'" he jeered incoherently. "Why, damn you, who do you
think you are, anyway?--that you think I'm going to stand for any
more of your snobby Boston backwash!--So I'm a big, hulking lout,
am I?"--the words rankled bitterly in his memory. "And dear,
darling little Francis is too fine, too fine--oh, dearie me, now,
yes--to have his precious little head cracked up against a wall
by the likes of me. . . . Why, damn you, Ann!" he said in a
grating voice, "what are you, anyway, but a damned dull lummox of
a girl from Boston? Who the hell do you think you are, anyway,
that I should sit here and take your snobby backwash and play
second fiddle while two cheap Boston women praise Starwick up to
the skies all day long and tell me what a great genius he is and
how much finer than anyone else that ever lived? By God, it is to
laugh!" he raved incoherently, blind with pain and passion,
hindering his own progress by his foolish words of wounded pride.
"--To see the damned affected &aelig;sthete get it all! You're
not worth it! You're not worth it!" he cried bitterly. "--You
call me a big hulking lout--and I feel more, know more, see more,
have more life and power and understanding in me in a minute than
the whole crowd of you will ever have--why, I'm so much better
than the rest of you that--that--that--there's no comparison!" he
said lamely; and concluded: "Oh, you're not worth it! You're not
worth it, Ann! Why should I get down on my knees to you this way,
and worship you, and beg you for just one word of love and
mercy--when you call me a big, hulking lout--and you are nothing
but a rich, dull Boston snob--and you're not worth it!" he cried
desperately. "Why has it got to be like this, when you're not
worth it, Ann?"</p>

<p>Her face flushed, and in a moment, laughing her short and
angry laugh, she said:</p>

<p>"God! I can see this is going to be a pleasant evening, with
you raving like a crazy man and passing out your compliments
already." She looked at him with bitter eyes, and said
sarcastically: "You say such nice things to people, don't you?
Oh, charming! Charming! Simply delightful!" She laughed her
sudden angry laugh again. "God! I'll never forget some of the
nice things that you said to me!"</p>

<p>And already tortured by remorse and shame, the huge,
indefinable swelter of anguish in his heart, he caught her hand,
and pleaded miserably, humbly.</p>

<p>"Oh, I know! I know!--I'm sorry, Ann, and I'll do better--so
help me, God, I will!"</p>

<p>"Then why must you carry on like this?" she said. "Why do you
curse and revile me and say such things about Francis, who is one
of the finest people that ever lived and who has never said a
word against you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I know!" he groaned miserably, and smote his brow. "--I
don't mean to--it just gets the best of me--Ann, Ann! I love you
so!"</p>

<p>"Yes," she muttered, "a funny kind of love, when you can say
such things to me!"</p>

<p>"And when I hear you praise up Starwick, it all comes back to
me--and Christ! Christ!--why did it have to be this way? Why did
it have to be Starwick that you--?"</p>

<p>She got up, her face flaring with anger and resentment.</p>

<p>"Come on!" she said curtly. "If you can't behave yourself--if
you're starting in on that--I'm not going to stay--"</p>

<p>"Don't go! Don't go!" he whispered, grabbing her hand and
holding it in a kind of dumb anguish. "You said you'd stay! It's
just for a few hours longer--oh, don't go and leave me, Ann! I'm
sorry! I promise I'll do better. It's only when I think of
it--oh, don't go, Ann! Please don't go! I try not to talk about
it, but it gets the best of me! I'll be all right now. I'll not
talk about it any more--if you won't go. It you'll just stay with
me a little longer--it will be all right. I swear that everything
will be all right if you don't go."</p>

<p>She stood straight and rigid, her hands clenched convulsively
at her sides, her eyes shot with tears of anger and bewilderment.
She made a sudden baffled movement of frustration and despair,
and cried bitterly:</p>

<p>"God! What is it all about? Why can't people be happy,
anyway?"</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>They made a furious circuit of the night. They went back to
all the old places--to the places they had been to with Elinor
and Starwick. They went to Le Rat Mort, to Le Coq et l'Ane, to Le
Moulin Rouge, to Le Bal Tabarin, to La Bol&eacute;e, to the
Jockey Club, to the Dome and the Rotonde,--even to the Bal
Bullier. They went to the big night resorts and to the little
ones, to great caf&eacute;'s and little bars, to dive and stew
and joint and hole, to places frequented exclusively by the rich
and fashionable--the foreigners, the wealthy French, the
tourists, the expatriates--and to other places where the rich and
fashionable went to peer down into the cauldrons of the lower
depths at all those creatures who inhabited the great swamp of
the night--the thieves, the prostitutes, the rogues, the pimps,
the lesbians and the pederasts--the human excrement, the damned
and evil swarm of sourceless evil that crawled outward from the
rat-holes of the dark, lived for a period in the night's huge
blaze of livid radiance, and then were gone, vanished, melted
away as by an evil magic into that trackless labyrinth from which
they came.</p>

<p>Where had it gone? That other world of just six weeks before,
with all its nocturnal and unholy magic, now seemed farther off
and stranger than a dream. It was impossible to believe that
these shabby places of garish light, and tarnished gold, and
tawdry mirrors, were the same resorts that had glowed in all
their hot and close perfumes just six weeks before, had burned
there in the train of night like some evil, secret and unholy
temple of desire. It was all worn off now: cheap as Coney Island,
tawdry, tarnished as the last year's trappings of a circus,
bedraggled, shabby as a harlot's painted face at noon. All of its
sinister and intoxicating magic had turned dull and pitiably
sordid: its people were pathetic, and its music dead--serving
only to recall the splendid evil people and the haunting music of
six weeks before.</p>

<p>And they saw now that this was just the way it was, the way it
had always been. Places, people, music--they were just the same.
All that had changed had been themselves. And all through the
night they went from place to place, drinking, watching, dancing,
doing just the things they had always done, but it was no
good--it had all gone stale--it would never be any good again.
They sat there sullenly, like people at a waning carnival,
haunted by the ghosts of memory and departure. The memory of
Elinor and Starwick--and particularly of Starwick--haunted each
place they went to like a death's-head at a feast. And again
Eugene was filled with the old, choking, baffled, and inchoate
anger, the sense of irretrievable and certain defeat: Starwick in
absence was even more triumphantly alive than if he had been
there--he alone, by the strange, rare quality in him, had been
able to give magic to this sordid carnival, and now that he was
gone, the magic had gone, too.</p>

<p>The night passed in a kaleidoscope of baffled fury, of
frenzied search and frustrate desire. All night they hustled back
and forth between the two blazing poles of Montmartre and
Montparnasse: later he was to remember everything like the
exploded fragments of a nightmare--a vision of dark, silent
streets, old shuttered houses, the straight slant and downward
plunge out of Montmartre--the sudden blaze of lights at
crossings, boulevards, in caf&eacute;s, night-clubs, bars and
avenues, the cool plunge and shock of air along dark streets
again, the taxi's shrill horn tootling at space, empty reckless
corners, the planted stems of light across the Seine, the bridges
and the sounding arches and dark streets, the steep slant of the
hill, the livid glare of night and all the night's scarred faces
over again.</p>

<p>They did not know why they stayed, why they hung on, why they
continued grimly at this barren hunt. But something held them
there together: they could not say good-bye and part. Ann hung on
sullenly, angrily, in a kind of stubborn silence, saying little,
ordering brandy at the bars and caf&eacute;s, champagne in the
night resorts, drinking little herself, sitting by him in a
sullen, angry silence while he drank.</p>

<p>He was like a maddened animal: he raved, stormed, shouted,
cursed, implored, entreated, reviled her and made love to her at
once--there was no sense, or reason, or coherence in anything he
said: it came out of him in one tortured expletive, the urge of
the baffled touch, that conflict of blind love and hate and
speechless agony, in his tormented spirit:</p>

<p>"Oh, Ann! . . . You lovely bitch! . . . You big, dark, dumb,
lovely, sullen Boston bitch! . . . Oh, you bitch! You bitch!" he
groaned, and seizing her hand, he caught it to him and said
desperately, "Ann, Ann, I love you! . . . You're the greatest . .
. grandest . . . best . . . most beautiful girl that ever lived .
. . Ann! Look at me--you big, ox-dumb brute. . . . Oh, you bitch.
. . . You Boston bitch. . . . Will it never come out of you? . .
. Won't you ever let it come? . . . Can't it be thawed, melted,
shaken loose? . . . Oh, you dumb, dark, sullen, lovely bitch . .
. is there nothing there? . . . is this all you are? . . . Oh,
Ann, you sweet, dumb wretch if you only knew how much I love
you--"</p>

<p>"God!" she cried, with her quick, short and angry laugh that
gave her face its sudden, radiant tenderness, its indescribable
loveliness and purity, "--God! But you're the gallant lover,
aren't you? First you love me, then you hate me, then I'm a dumb,
sullen Boston bitch, and then a wretch and then the grandest and
most beautiful girl that ever lived! God, you're wonderful, you
are!" She laughed bitterly. "You say such charming things."</p>

<p>"Oh, you bitch!" he groaned miserably. "You big, sweet, dumb,
and lovely bitch--Ann, Ann, for God's sake, speak to me, talk to
me!" He seized her hand and shook it frantically. "Say just one
word to show me you're alive--that you've got one single atom of
life and love and beauty in you. Ann, Ann,--look at me! In God's
name, tell me, what are you? Is there nothing there? Have you
nothing in you? For Christ's sake, try to say a single, living
word--for Christ's sake, try to show me that you're worth it,
that it's not all death and codfish, Boston, Back Bay, and cold
fishes' blood"--he raved on incoherently.</p>

<p>"Oh! Boston and cold fishes' blood, my eye!" she muttered,
with an angry flush in her face.</p>

<p>"And you?--What are you?" he jeered. "For God's sake, what
kind of woman are you? I never heard you speak a word that a
child of ten could not have spoken. I never heard you say a thing
that ought to be remembered. The only things I know about you are
that you are a Boston spinstress--thirty--no longer very young--a
few grey hairs already on your head--comfortably secure on dead
investments--over here on a spree--away from father and the
family and <i>The Boston Evening Transcript</i>--but never losing
them: always knowing that you will return to them--in God's name,
woman, is that all you are?"</p>

<p>She laughed her sudden, short and angry laugh, and yet there
was no rancour in it.</p>

<p>"That's what Frank would call a brief but masterly
description, isn't it? I suppose I should be grateful." She
looked at him with quiet eyes, and said simply: "What of it? Even
if what you say is true, what of it? As you say, I'm just a dull,
ordinary kind of person, and until you and Francis came along no
one thought me anything else or thought any the less of me for
being like that. Listen"--her voice was hard and straight and
sullen--"what do you expect people to be, anyway? Do you think
it's fair and decent to talk about how beautiful I am when I'm
not beautiful, and then to turn and curse me because I'm just an
ordinary girl?" She was silent a moment, with an angry flush upon
her face, and then she said: "As for my intellect, I went to Bryn
Mawr, and I got through without flunking, with a C average.
That's about the kind of brain I've got." She turned and looked
at him with straight, angry eyes, now shut a little with
tears.</p>

<p>"What of it?" she said. "You say that I am dull and dumb and
ordinary--well, I never pretended to be anything else. You know,
we all can't be great geniuses, like you and Francis," she said,
and suddenly her eyes were wet, and tears began to trickle down
across her flushed face. "I'm just what I am, I've never
pretended to be any different--if you think I'm dull and stupid
and ordinary, you have no right to insult me like this.--Come on,
I'm going home."--She started to get up, he seized her, pulled
her to him.</p>

<p>"Oh, you bitch! . . . You big, dumb, lovely bitch! . . . Oh,
Ann, Ann, you sweet devil, how I love you--I can never let you
go--oh, Goddamn you, Ann--"</p>

<p>It ended at last, at daybreak in a bistro near Les Halles,
where they had often gone at dawn with Elinor and Starwick for
rolls and chocolate or coffee. Outside they could hear the
nightly roar and rumble of the market, the cries of the vendors,
and smell all the sweet smells of earth and morning, of first
light, health, and joy, and day beginning.</p>

<p>When they left the bistro full light had come, and they at
length had fallen silent. They realized that it was useless,
hopeless, and impossible, that nothing could be said.</p>

<p>He left her at the gate outside the studio. She pressed the
bell, the gate swung open, and for a moment before she left him
she stood looking at him with a flushed, angry face, wet angry
eyes--a look of dumb, sullen misery that tore at his heart, and
for which he had no word.</p>

<p>"Good-bye," she said, "if I don't see you again--" She paused
and clenched her fists together at her side, closed her eyes,
tears spurted out, and in a choking voice she cried out:</p>

<p>"Oh, this will be a fine thing for me all right! This trip has
just been wonderful. God! I'm sorry that I ever saw any of
you--"</p>

<p>"Ann! Ann!"</p>

<p>"If you need money--if you're broke--"</p>

<p>"Ann!"</p>

<p>"God!" she cried again. "Why did I ever come?"</p>

<p>She was weeping bitterly, and with a blind, infuriated
movement she rushed through the gate and slammed it behind her.
He never saw her again.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>When he awoke in Chartres he was filled with a numb
excitement. It was a grey wintry day with snow in the air, and he
expected something to happen. He had this feeling often in the
country, in France: it was a strange, mixed feeling of desolation
and homelessness, of wondering with a ghostly emptiness why he
was there--and of joy, and hope, and expectancy, without knowing
what it was he was going to find.</p>

<p>In the afternoon he went down to the station and took a train
that was going to Orl&eacute;ans. He did not know where
Orl&eacute;ans was. The train was a mixed train, made up of goods
cars and passenger compartments. He bought a third-class ticket
and got into one of the compartments. Then the shrill little
whistle blew, and the train rattled out of Chartres into the
countryside, in the abrupt and casual way a little French train
has, and which was disquieting to him.</p>

<p>There was a light mask of snow on the fields and the air was
smoky: the whole earth seemed to smoke and steam, and from the
windows of the train one could see the wet earth and the striped,
cultivated pattern of the fields, and, now and then, some farm
buildings. It did not look like America: the land looked fat and
well kept, and even the smoky wintry woods had this well-kept
appearance. Far off sometimes one could see tall lines of poplars
and knew that there was water there.</p>

<p>In the compartment he found three people--an old peasant and
his wife and daughter. The old peasant had sprouting moustaches,
a seamed and weather-beaten face, and small rheumy-looking eyes.
His hands had a rock-like heaviness and solidity, and he kept
them clasped upon his knees. His wife's face was smooth and
brown, there were fine webs of wrinkles around her eyes, and her
face was like an old brown bowl. The daughter had a dark sullen
face and sat away from them next the window as if she was ashamed
of them. From time to time when they spoke to her she would
answer them in an infuriated kind of voice without looking at
them.</p>

<p>The peasant began to speak amiably to him when he entered the
compartment. He smiled and grinned back at the man, although he
did not understand a word he was saying, and the peasant kept on
talking then, thinking he understood.</p>

<p>The peasant took from his coat a package of the cheap,
powerful tobacco--the 'bleu--which the French government provides
for a few cents for the poor, and prepared to stuff his pipe. The
young man pulled a package of American cigarettes from his pocket
and offered them to the peasant.</p>

<p>"Will you have one?"</p>

<p>"My faith, yes!" said the peasant.</p>

<p>He took a cigarette clumsily from the package and held it
between his great, stiff fingers, then he held it to the flame
the young man offered, puffing at it in an unaccustomed way. Then
he fell to examining it curiously, revolving it in his hands to
read the label. He turned to his wife, who had followed every
movement of this simple transaction with the glittering intent
eyes of an animal, and began a rapid and excited discussion with
her.</p>

<p>"It's American--this."</p>

<p>"Is it good?"</p>

<p>"My faith, yes--it's of good quality."</p>

<p>"Here, let me see! What does it call itself?"</p>

<p>They stared dumbly at the label.</p>

<p>"What do you call this?" said the peasant to the young
man.</p>

<p>"Licky Streek," said the youth, dutifully phonetical.</p>

<p>"L-l-leek-ee--?" they stared doubtfully. "What does that wish
to say, in French?"</p>

<p>"Je ne sais pas," he answered.</p>

<p>"Where are you going?" the peasant said, staring at the youth
with rheumy little eyes of fascinated curiosity.</p>

<p>"Orl&eacute;ans."</p>

<p>"How?" the peasant asked, with a puzzled look on his face.</p>

<p>"Orl&eacute;ans."</p>

<p>"I do not understand," the peasant said.</p>

<p>"Orl&eacute;ans! Orl&eacute;ans!" the girl shouted in a
furious tone. "The gentleman says he is going to
Orl&eacute;ans."</p>

<p>"Ah!" the peasant cried, with an air of sudden illumination.
<i>"Orl&eacute;ans!"</i></p>

<p>It seemed to the youth that he had said the word just the same
way the peasant said it, but he repeated it.</p>

<p>"Yes, Orl&eacute;ans."</p>

<p>"He is going to Orl&eacute;ans," the peasant said, turning to
his wife.</p>

<p>"Ah-h!" she cried knowingly, with a great air of illumination,
then both fell silent, and began to stare at the youth with
curious, puzzled eyes again.</p>

<p>"What region are you from?" the peasant asked presently, still
intent and puzzled, staring at him with his small eyes.</p>

<p>"How's that? I don't understand."</p>

<p>"I say--what region are you from?"</p>

<p>"The gentleman is not French!" the girl shouted furiously, as
if exasperated by their stupidity. "He is a foreigner. Can't you
see that?"</p>

<p>"Ah-h!" the peasant cried, after a moment, with an air of
astounded enlightenment. Then, turning to his wife, he said
briefly, "He is not French. He is a stranger."</p>

<p>"Ah-h!"</p>

<p>And then they both turned their small, round eyes on him and
regarded him with a fixed, animal-like curiosity.</p>

<p>"From what country are you?" the peasant asked presently.
"What are you?"</p>

<p>"I am an American."</p>

<p>"Ah-h! An American. . . . He is an American," he said, turning
to his wife.</p>

<p>"Ah-h!"</p>

<p>The girl made an impatient movement and continued to stare
furiously and sullenly out of the window.</p>

<p>Then the peasant, with the intent, puzzled curiosity of an
animal began to examine his companion carefully from head to
foot. He looked at his shoes, his clothes, his overcoat, and
finally lifted his eyes in an intent and curious stare to the
young man's valise on the rack above his head. He nudged his wife
and pointed to the valise.</p>

<p>"That's good stuff, eh?" he said in a low voice. "It's real
leather."</p>

<p>"Yes, it's good, that."</p>

<p>And both of them looked at the valise for some time and then
turned their curious gaze upon the youth again. He offered the
peasant another cigarette, and the old man took one, thanking
him.</p>

<p>"It's very fine, this," he said, indicating the cigarette.
"That costs dear, eh?"</p>

<p>"Ah-h! . . . That's very dear," and he began to look at the
cigarette with increased respect.</p>

<p>"Why are you going to Orl&eacute;ans?" he asked presently. "Do
you know someone there?"</p>

<p>"No, I am just going there to see the town."</p>

<p>"How?" the peasant blinked at him stupidly, uncomprehendingly.
"You have business there?"</p>

<p>"No. I am going just to visit--to see the place."</p>

<p>"How?" the peasant said stupidly in a moment, looking at him.
"I do not understand."</p>

<p>"The gentleman says he is going to see the town," the girl
broke in furiously. "Can't you understand anything?"</p>

<p>"I do not understand what he is saying," the old man said to
her. "He does not speak French."</p>

<p>"He speaks very well," the girl said angrily. "I understand
him very well. It is you who are stupid--that's all."</p>

<p>The peasant was silent for some time now, puffing at his
cigarette, and looking at the young man with friendly, puzzled
eyes.</p>

<p>"America is very large--eh?" he said at length, making a wide
gesture with his hands.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is very large. Much larger than France."</p>

<p>"How?" the peasant said again with a puzzled, patient look. "I
do not understand."</p>

<p>"He says America is much larger than France," the girl cried
in an exasperated tone. "I understand all he says."</p>

<p>Then, for several minutes, there was an awkward silence:
nothing was said. The peasant smoked his cigarette, seemed on the
point of speaking several times, looked puzzled and said nothing.
Outside, rain had begun to fall in long slanting lines across the
fields, and beyond, in the grey blown sky, there was a milky
radiance where the sun should be, as if it were trying to break
through. When the peasant saw this, he brightened, and leaning
forward to the young man in a friendly manner, he tapped him on
the knee with one of his great, stiff fingers, and then pointing
towards the sun, he said very slowly and distinctly, as one might
instruct a child:</p>

<p>"Le so-leil."</p>

<p>And the young man obediently repeated the word as the peasant
had said it:</p>

<p>"Le so-leil."</p>

<p>The old man and his wife beamed delightedly and nodded their
approval, saying, "Yes. Yes. Good. Very good." Turning to his
wife for confirmation, the old man said: "He said it very well,
didn't he?"</p>

<p>"But, yes! It was perfect!"</p>

<p>Then, pointing to the rain, and making a down-slanting
movement with his great hands, he said again, very slowly and
patiently:</p>

<p>"La pluie."</p>

<p>"La pluie," the young man repeated dutifully, and the peasant
nodded vigorously, saying:</p>

<p>"Good, good. You are speaking very well. In a little time you
will speak good French." Then, pointing to the fields outside the
train, he said gently:</p>

<p>"La terre."</p>

<p>"La terre," the young man answered.</p>

<p>"I tell you," the girl cried angrily from her seat by the
window, "he knows all these words. He speaks French very well.
You are too stupid to understand him--that's all."</p>

<p>The old man made no reply to her, but sat looking at the young
man with a kind, approving face. Then, more rapidly than before,
and in succession, he pointed to the sun, the rain, the earth,
saying:</p>

<p>"Le soleil . . . la pluie . . . la terre."</p>

<p>The young man repeated the words after him, and the peasant
nodded vigorously with satisfaction. Then, for a long time, no
one spoke, there was no sound except for the uneven rackety-clack
of the little train, and the girl continued to look sullenly out
of the window. Outside, the rain fell across the fertile fields
in long slanting lines.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon the train stopped at a little station,
and everyone rose to get out. This was as far as the train went:
to reach Orl&eacute;ans it was necessary to change to another
train.</p>

<p>The peasant, his wife and his daughter collected their bundles
and got out of the train. On another track another little train
was waiting, and the peasant pointed to this with his great,
stiff finger, and said to the young man:</p>

<p>"Orl&eacute;ans. That's your train there."</p>

<p>The youth thanked him, and gave the old man the remainder of
the packet of cigarettes. The peasant thanked him effusively and
before they parted he again pointed rapidly towards the sun, the
rain, and the earth, saying with a kind and friendly smile:</p>

<p>"Le soleil . . . la pluie . . . la terre."</p>

<p>And the young man nodded to show that he understood, repeated
what the old man had said. And the peasant shook his head with
vigorous approval, saying:</p>

<p>"Yes, yes. It's very good. You will learn fast."</p>

<p>At these words, the girl, who with the same sullen, aloof, and
shamed look had walked on ahead of her parents, now turned and
cried out in a furious and exasperated tone:</p>

<p>"I tell you, the gentleman knows all that! . . . Will you
leave him alone now? . . . You are only making a fool of
yourself!"</p>

<p>But the old man and old woman paid no attention to her, but
stood looking at the young man, with a friendly smile, and shook
hands warmly and cordially with him as he said good-bye.</p>

<p>Then he walked on across the tracks and got up into a
compartment in the other train. When he looked out of the window
again, the peasant and his wife were standing on the platform
looking towards him with kind and eager looks on their old faces.
When the peasant caught his eye, he pointed his great finger at
the sun again, and called out:</p>

<p>"Le so-leil."</p>

<p>"Le so-leil," the young man answered.</p>

<p>"Yes! Yes!" the old man shouted, with a laugh. "It's very
good."</p>

<p>Then the daughter looked toward the young man sullenly, gave a
short and impatient laugh of exasperation, and turned angrily
away. The train began to move then, but the old man and woman
stood looking after him as long as they could. He waved to them,
and the old man waved his great hand vigorously and, laughing,
pointed towards the sun. And the young man nodded his head and
shouted, to show that he had understood. Meanwhile, the girl had
turned her back angrily and was walking away around the
station.</p>

<p>Then they were lost from sight, the train swiftly left the
little town behind, and now there was nothing but the fields, the
earth, the smoky and mysterious distances. The rain fell
steadily.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Full dark had come--the wintry darkness of a grey wet day in
early March--before he got to Orl&eacute;ans. The train was of
the variety known in France as omnibus, one of those dingy little
locals that are made up of third-class compartments and that stop
at every country station. As the train neared Orl&eacute;ans
there was a noticeable increase in the travelling public: at
every station there was a noisy traffic of arriving and departing
passengers. For the most part the people had the look of the
country: they came stamping in and out with muddy shoes, with a
great banging of compartment doors, with a great tumult of
voices, with the vigorous excitement of robust and talkative
people.</p>

<p>They were a good-natured crowd, and seemed to know one
another, if not actually by name, with the even completer
familiarity of race and kind and region. At the sudden pauses at
dim-lit country stations one could hear them shouting greetings
and farewells, and see them streaming away along a muddy road
towards the dim light and shine of a little town with all the
utter, common, and dreary familiarity of March. And the train, in
those abrupt and sudden halts and pauses, seemed to be almost as
casual a means of transportation as a street-car: it would rattle
up to a station halt, the people would stamp in and out with a
banging of doors and with many shouts, cries, greetings, and
farewells, then the shrill little whistle would make its fifing
note and the train would rattle out into the wet and wintry
countryside again.</p>

<p>In the compartments the lights were very low and dim, and cast
flickering shadows on the faces of the passengers. Somewhere in
the train, in another compartment, there was a noisy and jolly
crowd of soldiers and robust country people. One man in
particular dominated the whole train with his jolly energy, his
vulgar and high-spirited good nature. The man's rich voice was
charged indescribably with the high, sanguinary vitality of the
Frenchman. The voice, to a foreigner, was at once inimitably
strange in accent, quality and intonation, and yet familiar as
all life, all living. It was packed with the juice of life, and
had the full rich qualities of a good wine.</p>

<p>For the youth, that voice heard there in the flickering
shadows of the little train, heard with all its robust and
full-blooded penetration at the casual and abrupt halts and
pauses at little stations, was to be a strangely haunting one. A
thousand times thereafter the tone of that rich voice would
return to him and reverberate in his memory with the haunting,
strange and wonderful recurrence with which the "little" things
of life--a face seen one time at a window, a voice that passed in
darkness and was gone, the twisting of a leaf upon a bough--come
back to us out of all the violence and savage chaos of the
days--the "little" things that persist so strangely, vividly, and
inexplicably when the more sensational and "important" events of
life have been forgotten or obscured.</p>

<p>So, now, the jolly voice of this unseen Frenchman, as it
shouted out good-natured but derisive comments on the customs,
the appearance, and the inhabitants of every little town at which
they stopped, as it was answered in like fashion by the people on
the station platforms, brought back to him instantly the memory
of a little country town in the South at which, on his way to and
from college, he had stopped a dozen times at just this hour. The
name of the town was Creasman, there was a small sectarian school
there which was known as Creasman College, and it had become
traditional with the university students, who crowded the train
on their journeys home or back to college, to thrust their heads
out of the windows and howl with the derisive arrogance of youth:
"Whoopee, girls! Creasman College!"</p>

<p>And this sally was usually answered by similar jibes and jeers
from the group of students, townsfolk and country people who
crowded the platform of the station "to see the train come
through."</p>

<p>In this Frenchman's taunts and jeers, and in the way the
people at the stations answered him, as well as in all the
traffic of noisy, muddy, talking and gesticulating people who
streamed in and out of the train at every halt, there was, in
spite of all the local differences, the same essential quality
that had characterized the halts at the little town set there
upon the vast, raw Piedmont of the South.</p>

<p>Moreover, there was in the tone and texture of the Frenchman's
voice--at once so actual, living, and familiar in its high,
sanguinary energy, and so foreign, alien, and troubling to a
stranger's ear--the whole warmth and vitality of centuries of
living, a quality which brought the ancient past of Europe, and
of France, to life, as the pages of history could never do.</p>

<p>In the same way the boy had long ago discovered that a single
tone or shading in his mother's or his father's voice could touch
the lost past of America--the past of the Civil War, the strange
mysteries of Garfield, Arthur, Harrison, and Hayes, which is, for
most Americans, more far and strange in time than the
Crusades--and bring it instantly into life.</p>

<p>Thus he had never gained a living image of the Civil War until
he heard his mother speak of it one day. Until that time all his
efforts to recapture that lost time out of the pages of books had
been futile; the men, the battles, the generals, and the lives of
all the people existed in a world of legendary unreality, and
seemed, in fact, as different from the world he knew as if they
had existed on a separate planet. And then one day he heard his
mother--who had been only five years old when the war
ended--describe the return of the troops along a country road
near home. She told how the dust rose from the ragged feet of
weary marching men and of how she sat upon her father's shoulder
as the troops went by, and of all her friends and kinsmen who
were standing near her, and of the return of a cousin--a boy of
sixteen years--starved, ragged, wearing a stove-pipe hat, and
without shoes, of how the women wept and of the boy's words of
jesting and good-natured greeting, as he came to meet them.</p>

<p>Now, with the full rich accents of this unseen Frenchman, at
once so strange and so familiar, all of the ancient life of
France--her wars and histories, the great chronicles of her
battles, and the brilliant and indestructible fabric of her life
and energy through so many hundred years of victory and defeat,
triumph and catastrophe--began to pulse with such a living and
familiar warmth that it seemed to him as if the whole thing from
the beginning had been compacted and resumed into the rich and
sanguinary energies of this one Frenchman's voice.</p>

<p>The man's speech, a kind of furious and high-spirited
repartee, carried on against all comers with an instant's
readiness, an animal vigour, that was almost like a national
intoxication, was penetrated constantly by the exclamation
"Parbleu!"</p>

<p>And more than anything else, it seemed to the youth, it was
the tone and quality of that ancient exclamation, delivered with
such a buoyant and animal vitality, that united the Frenchman to
the distant past of his nation's history, to millions of buried
and forgotten lives, and through him, made that distant past
blaze instantly with all the warmth and radiance of life
again.</p>

<p>The Frenchman's speech was lewd and ribald with the open and
robust vulgarity of healthy country people; his broad jests were
published without affectation in a tone loud enough for all the
world to hear, and it was evident from the roars of hearty,
sensual laughter with which his remarks were received by the
soldiers, provincials, and strapping peasant women who were with
him, that his audience was not a squeamish one.</p>

<p>The chief target for this robust fellow's humour, to which he
loudly returned with unwearied pertinacity, was that unfortunate
man, the station-master, whose calling, for some reason, is
provocative of unlimited mirth in France. Now, at every station,
the Frenchman would publish to the world, amid roars of laughter,
his narration of the station-master's unhappy lot. In particular,
he sang snatches of a ribald song entitled "Il est cocu le chef
de gare"--which described movingly the trials of a
station-master's life, the cuckoldries to which the nature of the
work exposes him, the conduct of his wife when he is away from
home dispatching trains. And the Frenchman would garnish this
ditty with certain pointed speculations of his own, directed at
the station-master of each town, concerning the probable
whereabouts, at that moment, of the station-master's wife.</p>

<p>Sometimes the answer to this ribald banter would be curses,
oaths and maddened imprecations from the station-master;
sometimes the answer would be a good-natured one, as rough and
ready in its coarse spontaneity as the Frenchman's own, but
whatever the result, the Frenchman was always ready with a
reply.</p>

<p>"Are you speaking from your own experience?" one of the
station-masters yelled ironically. "Is that the way your old
woman behaves when you leave home?"</p>

<p>"Parbleu! Oui!" the Frenchman roared back cheerfully. "Why
not? The meat is all the sweeter for a little extra
seasoning."</p>

<p>This sally was rewarded by a scream of delighted laughter from
the peasant women, and the jester, thus encouraged,
continued:</p>

<p>"Parbleu! Do you think I'd play the miser with the old girl,
when I've had so much myself? But, no, my friend! What the devil!
My old girl's no rare canary who'll fade away the first time that
you look at her. The devil, no! There's good stuff there, sound
and solid as an ox, old boy, and lots more where the last batch
came from!"</p>

<p>At this delicate sally there were roars and screams of
delighted laughter from the peasant women in the train, and when
the commotion had somewhat subsided, one could hear the voice of
the station-master from the platform, yelling back
ironically:</p>

<p>"Good! Since there's enough for everyone, I'll come round to
get my share!"</p>

<p>"Parbleu! Why not?" the high, sanguinary voice responded
instantly. "Turn about's fair play, as the saying goes--I've
played the cock to many a station-master's hen--"</p>

<p>Roars of laughter.</p>

<p>"And I'd be the last fellow in the world to begrudge him
now--" he would conclude triumphantly, and the train would move
off to the accompaniment of roars of laughter, ribaldry, and
lusty and derisive banter, above which the high, rich energy of
the Frenchman's voice, crying out,--"Parbleu! Oui! Why not?" was
always dominant.</p>

<p>He left the train at one of the little stations near
Orl&eacute;ans, departing amid a rough but good-natured chorus of
jeers, jibes, and derisive yells which followed him as he walked
away along the platform, and to all of which he instantly
responded with his ribald vitality of coarse humour, that in its
lusty ebullience was somehow like the intoxication of a sound,
rich wine.</p>

<p>The boy saw him for an instant as he passed by the window of
the compartment. He was a strong, stocky figure of a man, wearing
leggings, with blue eyes, a brown moustache, and a solid face
full of dark, rich colour. But even after he had disappeared from
sight, the boy could hear him shouting to the other people, the
sanguinary vitality of his instant, ribald--"Parbleu! Why
not?"--a tone, a voice, a word that had evoked the past of
France, in all the living textures of her earth and blood, and
that, in future years, would bring this scene to life again--all
of the faces, voices, lives of these people--as no other single
thing could do.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>At one of the little stations near Orl&eacute;ans a girl
opened the door and climbed up into the compartment, which was
already crowded. The country people, however, made room for her,
crowding a little closer together on the wooden bench, and
telling her to wedge herself in, with the rough but good-natured
familiarity that characterized their conduct towards one
another.</p>

<p>The girl sat down opposite the boy, beside the window, and put
the market basket which she was carrying on her knees. She was
cleanly but plainly dressed, a very lovely and seductive girl
with a slender figure which seemed, however, already to have
attained a languorous and sensual maturity. She was wearing a
broad-brimmed hat of blue that shaded her face, from which her
eyes looked out with a luminous, troubling, and enigmatic
clarity. She said nothing, but sat silently listening to the rude
jovialities of the peasant people around her and to the ribald
shouts and yells and roars of laughter that came from the nearby
compartment.</p>

<p>All the time, the girl gazed directly at the young man, her
lovely face traced faintly with a tender, enigmatic smile. It
seemed certain to him that if he spoke to her she would not
rebuff him. The sensation of an impossible good fortune, of some
vague and unutterable happiness that was impending for him in
this strange and unknown town, returned. Desire, slow, sultry,
began to beat, throbbing in his pulses and through the conduits
of his blood. He felt certain that the girl would not rebuff him
if he spoke to her. And yet he did not speak.</p>

<p>And presently the little train came puffing in to
Orl&eacute;ans, all of the people got out and streamed away
towards the station along the platform. He took the girl's basket
and helped her down out of the train, and with the old bewildered
indecision in his heart stood there looking after her as she
walked away from him with a graceful, slow, and sensual stride in
which every movement that she made seemed to imply reluctance to
depart, an invitation to follow. And he looked after her numbly,
with hot desire pounding slow and thick in pulse and blood. And
he told himself, as he had told himself so many times before,
that he would certainly find her again, knowing in his heart he
never would.</p>

<p>Already the girl had been lost among the crowds of people
streaming through the station, engulfed again in the everlasting
web and weaving of this great earth, to leave him with a memory
of another of those brief and final meetings, so poignant with
their wordless ache of loss and of regret, in which, perhaps more
than in the grander, longer meetings of our life, man's bitter
destiny of days, his fatal brevity, are apparent.</p>

<p>And again the boy found himself walking along the platform
towards the station after the departing people, whom he had met
so briefly and now lost for ever. Again he had sought the
mysterious promises of a new land, new earth, and a shining city.
Again he had come to a strange place, not knowing why he had
come.</p>

<p>Why here?</p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h1>XCII</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>The Grand H&ocirc;tel du Monde et d'Orl&eacute;ans, which was
situated opposite the railway station on one of the corners of
the station square, was, despite its sounding title, a modest
establishment of forty or fifty rooms, constructed in that style
at once grandiose and solid which is peculiar to French hotel
architecture. When he entered he found two women seated in the
bureau carrying on an animated conversation in fluent English, of
which the startling substance ran somewhat as follows:</p>

<p>"But yes, madame. I assure you--you need have
no--kalms?--kalms?"--the younger and larger of the two women said
in a doubtful tone, lifting puzzled eyebrows at her older
companion--<i>"kalms,</i> Comtesse, je ne comprends pas
<i>kalms.</i> Qu'est-ce que &ccedil;a veut dire?"</p>

<p>"Mais non, cherie," the other answered patiently. "Pas
<i>kalms</i>--<i>qualms</i>--<i>qualms."</i> She pronounced the
word slowly and carefully several times, until the other woman
succeeded in saying it after her, at which the little woman
nodded her meagre little head emphatically with a movement of
bird-like satisfaction, and said:</p>

<p>"Oui! Oui! Bon! C'est &ccedil;a! <i>Qualms?</i></p>

<p>"Mais &ccedil;a veut dire?" the other said inquiringly in a
puzzled tone.</p>

<p>"&Ccedil;a veut dire, ch&eacute;rie--you need have no qualms,
madame--" the little wren-like woman considered carefully before
she spoke--"Vous n'avez pas besoin de perturbation--n'est-ce
pas?" she cried, with an eager look of triumph.</p>

<p>"Ah-h!" the other cried, with an air of great enlightenment.
"Oui! Je comprends. . . . I assure you, madame, that you need
have no qualms about the plumbing arrangements."</p>

<p>"Bon! Bon!" the little woman nodded her head approvingly.
<i>"Plumbing,</i> ch&eacute;rie. <i>Plumbing,"</i> she added
gently as an afterthought.</p>

<p>"You will find everyt'ing t'oroughly modairne--"</p>

<p><i>"Thoroughly</i>--" the other said, slowly and carefully.
<i>"Thoroughly</i>--you pronounce it this way, my
dear--<i>th</i>--<i>th</i>--" She leaned forward, inserting her
tongue illustratively between her false teeth.</p>

<p>"Thoroughly," the other said, with evident difficulty, and
repeated--"thoroughly modairne--"</p>

<p><i>"Modern,</i> dear! <i>Modern!"</i> the little wren-like
woman said slowly and carefully again, but then, nodding her head
with a movement of swift decision, she went on sharply: "Mais
non! &Ccedil;a va! &Ccedil;a va bien!" She nodded her head
vigorously. "Laissez comme &ccedil;a! Les Am&eacute;ricains
aiment mieux comme &ccedil;a--un peu d'accent, n'est-ce pas?" she
said craftily. "Pour les Am&eacute;ricains."</p>

<p>"Ah, oui!" the other woman responded at once, nodding
seriously. "Vous avez raison. Ce n'est pas bon de parler trop
correctement. Un peu d'accent est mieux. Ils aiment
&ccedil;a--les Am&eacute;ricains."</p>

<p>They nodded wisely at each other, their faces comically
eloquent with that strange union of avarice, hard worldliness,
and provincial na&iuml;vet&eacute; which qualifies a Frenchman's
picture of the earth. Then, looking up at the young man, who was
standing awkwardly before the <i>bureau,</i> the younger of the
two women said coldly:</p>

<p>"Monsieur?--"</p>

<p>The young woman was perhaps twenty-eight years old, but her
cold, dark face, which was lean and sallow and cleft powerfully
by a large strong nose, had the maturity of cold mistrustfulness
and unyielding avarice which was incalculable. It was as if from
birth her spirit had been steeped in the hard and bitter dyes of
man's iniquity, as if she had sucked the acid nutriment of
mistrust and worldly wisdom out of her mother's breast--as if her
hard heart and her cold, dark eyes had never known youth,
remembered innocence, or been blinded by romantic fantasies--as
if, in short, she had sprung full-armoured from her cradle,
versed in all grim arts of seeking for one's self, clutching her
first sous in a sweating palm, learning to add by numbers before
she could prattle a child's prayer.</p>

<p>Seen so, the woman's face had a cold and stern authority of
mistrust that was impregnable. The face, indeed, might have been
the very image of a hotel-keeper's soul, impeccable in its
perfection of bought courtesy, but hard, cold, lifeless, cruel as
hell, obdurate as a block of granite, to any warming ray of
mercy, pardon, or concession where another's loss and its own
gain might be concerned.</p>

<p>And yet, for all its cold and worldly inhumanity, the face was
a passionate one as well. Her strong, black brows grew straight
and thick in an unbroken line above her eyes, her upper lip was
dark with a sparse but unmistakable moustache of a few black
hairs, her face, at once cold and hard in its mistrust, and
smouldering with a dark and sinister desire, was stamped with
that strange fellowship of avarice and passion he had seen in the
faces of women such as this all over France.</p>

<p>He had seen these women everywhere--behind the cashier's desk
in restaurants, shops, and stores, behind the desks in
caf&eacute;s, theatres, and brothels, or in the bureau of a hotel
such as this. Sometimes they were alone, sometimes they were
seated together behind one of those enormous tall twin desks,
enthroned there like the very magistrates of gain, totting up the
interminable figures in their ledgers with the slow care and
minute painfulness of greed. They sat there, singly or two
abreast, behind their tall desks near the door, casting their
hard eyes in a glance of cold mistrust upon the customers and at
each other, conspiring broodingly together as they checked and
compared each other's ledgers--seeming to be set there, in fact,
not only as a watch upon the cheats and treasons of the world,
but as a watch upon their own as well.</p>

<p>And yet, haired darkly on their upper lips, cold, hard,
mistrustful in their grasping avarice as they might be, he had
always felt in them the complement of a sinister passion. He felt
that when all the day's countings were over, the last entry made
in the enormous ledger, the last figure added up, and the last
drops of sweat wrung from the leaden visage of the final
sous--then, <i>then,</i> he felt, they would pull down the
shutters, bare their teeth in smiles of savage joy, and go to
their appointed meeting with their lover, Jack the Ripper. Upon
faces such as these, even during their daylight impassivity of
cold mistrust, the ardour of their nocturnal secrecies was almost
obscenely articulate; it required little effort of the
imagination to see these women quilted in a vile, close darkness,
a union of evil chemistries, locked in the grip of a criminal
love, with teeth bared in the bite and shine of a profane and
lawless ecstasy, and making savage moan.</p>

<p>Such, in fact, was the face of the young woman in the bureau
of the hotel, who now looked up at him with the cold inquiry of
mistrust and said:</p>

<p>"Monsieur?--"</p>

<p>"I--I'd like to get a room," he stammered awkwardly, faltering
before her hard, impassive stare, and speaking to her in her own
language.</p>

<p>"Comment?" she said sharply, a little startled at being
addressed so immediately in the language wherein she had just
been holding--studious practice. "Vous d&eacute;sirez?--"</p>

<p>"Une chambre," he mumbled--"pas trop ch&egrave;re."</p>

<p>"Ah-h--a room! He says he wants a room, my dear," the little
woman now put in, quickly and eagerly. She hopped up briskly and
came towards him with an eager gleam in her sharp old eyes, an
anticipating hope in her meagre face.</p>

<p>"You are a stranger?" she inquired, peering sharply at him.
"An American?"--with a look of eager hope.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said.</p>

<p>"Ah-h!" her breath went in with a little intake of greedy
satisfaction. "I thought so! . . . Yvonne! Yvonne!" she cried
sharply, turning to the other woman in a state of great
excitement. "He's an American--he wants a room--he must have
something good--an American," she babbled, "the best you've
got--"</p>

<p>"But yes!" cried Yvonne rising. "To be sure. At vunce!" she
cried, and struck a bell, calling: "Jean! Jean!"</p>

<p>"But not--not," the youth stuttered, "not the best--it's just
for me--I'm all alone," he appealed to the smaller
woman--"something not very expensive," he said desperately.</p>

<p>"Ah--hah--hah!" she said, emitting a little chuckling laugh of
gloating satisfaction and continuing to peer craftily up at him.
"An American! And young, too.--How old are you, my boy?"</p>

<p>"T-t-twenty-four," he stuttered, staring at her
helplessly.</p>

<p>"Ah--hah--hah!" Again the little gloating laugh. "I thought
so--and why are you here? . . . What are you doing here in
Orl&eacute;ans, eh?" she said imperatively, yet coaxingly. "What
brings you here, my boy?"</p>

<p>"Why--why--" he stammered confusedly, and then finding no
adequate reason (since there was none) for being there, he
blurted out--"I'm--a writer--a--a--journalist," he stammered,
feeling this made his lie the less.</p>

<p>"Ah--hah--hah," she chuckled softly again with a kind of
abstracted gluttony of satisfaction--"a journalist, eh, my boy?"
In her ravenous eagerness she had begun to pat and stroke his arm
with a claw-like hand, as a cook might stroke a fat turkey before
killing it. "A journalist, eh? . . . Yvonne! Yvonne!" suddenly
she turned to the other woman again, speaking rapidly in a burst
of high excitement. "The young man is a journalist . . . an
American journalist . . . he writes for <i>The New York
Times,</i> Yvonne . . . the greatest newspaper in America."</p>

<p>"Well, not exactly that," he blundered, red in the face from
confusion and embarrassment. "I never said--"</p>

<p>"Ah--hah--hah," the little old woman said again with her
little gloating laugh, peering up at him with a crafty gleam in
her sharp old eyes, and stroking his arm in her unconscious
eagerness. ". . . And you've come to write about us, eh? . . .
Joan of Arc, eh?" she said seducingly, with a little crafty laugh
of triumph. "--The Cathedral . . . the Maid of Orl&eacute;ans . .
. ah, my boy, you have come to the right place. . . . I will show
you everything. . . . I will take care of you. . . . You are in
good hands now. . . . Ah-h, we love the Americans here. . . .
Yvonne! Yvonne!" she cried again, her excitement growing all the
time. "He says he is here to write about Orl&eacute;ans for
<i>The New York Times . . .</i> he will put it all in . . . the
Cathedral . . . Joan of Arc . . . the hotel here . . . the
greatest paper in America . . . millions of people will come here
when they read it--"</p>

<p>"Well, now, I never said--" he began again.</p>

<p>"Ah--hah--hah," again she was peering up at him craftily, with
old eyes of eager greed, chortling her little laugh of gloating
triumph, as she stroked his arm. "Twenty-four, eh? . . . And
where are you from, my boy? . . . Where is your home?"</p>

<p>"Why--New York, I suppose," he said hesitantly.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I know," she said impatiently--"but before that?
Where were you born? . . . What State are you from?"</p>

<p>He stared at her for a moment with bewildered face.</p>

<p>"Why, I don't think you'd know where it is," he said at
length. "I'm from Catawba."</p>

<p>"Catawba--yes!" the old woman pressed on eagerly. "And what
part of Catawba? What town?"</p>

<p>"Why,"--he stared at her, gape-jawed with amazement--"a place
called Altamont."</p>

<p>"Altamont!" she crowed jubilantly. "Altamont--yes!
Altamont--of course!"</p>

<p>"You <i>know</i> it?" he said incredulously. "You've
<i>heard</i> of it?"</p>

<p><i>"Heard</i> of it! Why, my boy, I've been there seven
times!" She chuckled with triumph, then went on with a wild and
incoherent eagerness. "Little Mother, they call me . . . I am
known everywhere. . . . Letters . . . cablegrams . . . the
Governor of Arkansas . . ." she babbled. "I gave up everything .
. . spent my fortune. . . . Ah, my boy, I love the Americans. . .
. They call me Little Mother. . . . Altamont! . . . A beautiful
town! . . . Do you know Doctor Bradford and his family? . . . And
how is Harold? . . . What's Alice doing now--has she married? . .
. a lovely girl. . . . And how is George Watson? . . . What's he
doing, eh? . . . Is he still secretary of the Chamber of
Commerce? . . . And Mrs. Morgan Hamilton. . . . And Charles
McKee--ah, how I should like to see all my dear old friends in
Altamont again."</p>

<p>"You--you know them--all those people?" he gasped, hearing as
in a dream the great cathedral bells throng out upon the air of
night.</p>

<p><i>"Know</i> them! . . . I know everyone in the town. . . . I
always stay with Doctor Bradford and his family. . . . Ah, what
lovely people, my boy. . . . How good they have been to me. . . .
I love Americans! . . . Little Mother, they call me," she went on
in a strange, tranced tone, her eyes burning feverishly as she
spoke--"'As the brave little woman who is known to thousands of
Our Boys as the Little Mother of the Stars and Stripes stood
before the great audience that packed the City Auditorium last
night as it had never been packed before in its whole history, it
is safe to say there was not a dry eye in the great'--Yvonne!"
She broke sharply away from her mysterious recitation, and again
addressed herself excitedly to the hotel woman--"I know his town
. . . I know his family . . . I know his father and mother . . .
I have stayed at their house! . . . They are all dear friends of
mine! . . . Quick! Tell Madame Vatel that an American friend of
mine is here. . . . Tell her it is going to be a great thing for
her . . . for Orl&eacute;ans . . . for all of us. . . . Tell her
he is going to write about the hotel in <i>The New York Times . .
.</i> you will give him a good room . . . a good price, eh?" she
said cunningly. "He will bring hundreds of people here to the
hotel--"</p>

<p>"But yes, Countess," said Yvonne. "Perfectly."</p>

<p>"The best! The best!" the old woman cried. "He comes from one
of the most prominent families in America--ah--hah--hah! You will
see!" She chuckled with mysterious cunning. "I shall make you all
rich and famous before I'm through . . . I know all the rich
Americans. . . . Hah--hah. . . . They will all come here now when
he has written about us. . . . <i>The New York Times,</i>
Yvonne," she whispered gloatingly, "the paper all the rich
Americans read. . . . Tell Madame Vatel what has happened. . . .
Ah, a great thing, Yvonne. . . . a great thing for us all--see!"
she whispered mysteriously, pointing towards the bewildered
youth--"the head, Yvonne! The head! You can tell by the head,
Yvonne," she whispered. <i>"What</i> a clever head, Yvonne. . . .
<i>The New York Times,</i> eh? . . ." she chuckled craftily,
"that all the clever writers write for! . . . Tell Vatel!" she
whispered gloatingly, rubbing her little claw-like hands
together. "Tell Madame. . . . Tell everyone. . . . He must have
the best," she muttered with conspiratorial secrecy. "The
best."</p>

<p>"But yes, Countess," Yvonne said smoothly. "Monsieur shall
have nothing but the best. Number Seven, I think," she said
reflectively. "Oui! Number Seven!" She nodded her head decisively
with satisfaction. "I am sure Monsieur will like the room. . . .
Jean! Jean!" She clapped her hands sharply to the attentive
porter, who now sprang forward nimbly. "Apportez les baggages de
Monsieur au Num&eacute;ro Sept."</p>

<p>"But--but--the price?" the youth said awkwardly.</p>

<p>"The price," said Yvonne, "to Monsieur is--twelve francs. To
others--that is deeferent, eh?" she said with a significant smile
and an expressive shrug. "But since Monsieur is a friend of the
Countess, the price will be twelve francs."</p>

<p>"Cheap! Cheap!" the Countess muttered. "And now, my boy," she
said coaxingly, taking him by the arm, "you must take your meals
here, too. . . . The cuisine! . . . Ah-h! Merveilleuse!" she
whispered, making a small rhapsodic gesture with one hand. "You
will eat here, too, my boy--eh?"</p>

<p>He nodded dumbly, and the old woman turned immediately to
Yvonne with a look of cunning triumph, saying: "Did you hear,
Yvonne? . . . Do you see? . . . He will take his meals here, too.
. . . Tell Vatel. . . . Tell Madame. . . . I know all the rich
Americans. . . . They will all come now, Yvonne," she whispered.
"You will see. . . . And now, my boy," she said with an air of
decision, turning to him again, "have you had dinner yet? . . .
No? . . . Good!" she said with satisfaction. "I shall eat with
you," she took him by the arm possessively. "We shall eat
together here in the hotel. . . . I shall have Pierre set a table
for us . . . we shall always eat together there--just you and I.
. . . Ah, you have come to the right place . . . I shall look
after you and watch you like your own mother, my boy. . . . There
are so many bad places here in Orl&eacute;ans . . . so many low
resorts. I shall tell you where they are so that you can keep out
of them . . . it is so easy for a young man to go astray. . . .
So many young Americans who come over here get into trouble, meet
with bad companions, because they have no one to guide them. . .
. But have no fear, my boy . . . I will watch over you while you
are here like your own mother. . . . They call me Little
Mother."</p>

<p>He cast a distressed and perplexed glance towards Yvonne, and
that capable person came instantly and suavely to his rescue.</p>

<p>"Perhaps, Countess," she said smoothly, "Monsieur would like
to see his room and brosh up a beet after ze fatigue of his
journey--eh?"</p>

<p>He looked at her gratefully, and the Countess, nodding her
head vigorously, said instantly:</p>

<p>"Oui! Oui! C'est &ccedil;a! . . . By all means, my boy, go up
to your room and wash up a bit. . . . Ah, a lovely room! He will
like it, eh, Yvonne? . . . New furnishings, hot and cold water,
beautiful plumbing."</p>

<p>"I can assure Monsieur," said Yvonne dutifully, "that he need
have no--kalms--"</p>

<p><i>"Qualms,</i> Yvonne, <i>qualms,"</i> the Countess corrected
her gently--"a lovely room, my boy! And when you have finished
come on down and we will dine together. . . . You will find me
here. I will wait for you. And while you eat," she said
enticingly. "I shall let you read my clippings--ah-h, I have a
great book full of them. . . . You shall read it all,
everything--what it says about their Little Mother," she said
tenderly. "And I shall keep you company. I shall talk to you and
tell you what to do in Orl&eacute;ans. . . . No, no, I shall eat
nothing," she said hastily, as if to allay some economic
apprehension on his part. "It will cost you nothing. . . . A
little of your coffee, perhaps. . . . Perhaps a glass of wine--no
more. Ah, my dear," the old woman went on sadly, "the food here
is so lovely, and I cannot eat it . . . I can eat nothing--"</p>

<p>"Nothing?" he said, staring at her.</p>

<p>"Rien, rien, rien," she cried, waving her hand sidewise.</p>

<p>"The Countess is on--what you say--a diet?" said Yvonne
sympathetically. "Eet ees the doctor's orders--she cannot
eat."</p>

<p>"Rien du tout," the Countess said again. "Nothing but horse's
blood, my dear," the Countess said in a sad voice. "That's all I
live on now."</p>

<p><i>"Horse's</i> blood!" he stared at her unbelievingly.</p>

<p>"Oui!" she nodded. "Sang de cheval! You see, my dear," she
went on in an explanatory tone, "I have an&aelig;mia--and by the
doctor's orders I take horse's blood. . . . But the food here is
so lovely. Lovely. I shall wait for you, my boy, and watch you
eat."</p>

<p>"Jean!" cried Yvonne sharply, giving the youth his freedom by
one brisk act. "Les baggages de Monsieur. Num&eacute;ro
Sept."</p>

<p>She handed the key to the porter.</p>

<p>"Oui, monsieur," the porter said cheerfully, picking up the
youth's valise. "Par ici, s'il vous pla&icirc;t."</p>

<p>They went back and got into the little lift, just big enough
for two. It mounted slowly, creakingly, with slatting rope. They
got off at the first flight: he followed the porter down a
thickly carpeted hall and then, while the man switched on lights,
turned down the coverlet of the bed, and pulled the heavy
curtains together in order to assure that atmosphere of stale
nocturnal confinement without which sleep in France seems
impossible, he examined the room.</p>

<p>The place easily lived up to all the rapturous prophesies
which the Countess had made of it. It was astonishingly
luxurious--with that almost indecent luxury that is
characteristic of a French hotel room, and that is disquietingly
similar to the luxury of a brothel. The bed was a lavish,
canopied affair with crimson hangings; the floor was covered with
a thick crimson carpet, completely noiseless to the tread; there
was a sensually fat sofa and several fat chairs covered with fat,
red plush and painted with gilt, a great gilt-rimmed mirror above
the mantel, a washbowl of deep and heavy porcelain with
glittering nickel fixtures, a lavish bidet, the inevitable
provision of a French woman's needs, and curtains of a fat, silk,
quilted material whose sensual folds were now closely drawn
together, completing the effect of bordello secrecy and luxury
previously described.</p>

<p>And this oriental luxury was being provided to him for seventy
cents a day on the recommendation of a mad old woman who drank
horse's blood and whom he had never seen until a half-hour ago.
As he stood there bewildered by this new, strange turn of chance
and destiny, he felt the stillness of the old town around him,
and heard again the vast, sweet thronging of the cathedral bells
through the dark and silent air, and felt again, as he had felt
so many times, the strange and bitter miracle of life. And there
was something in his heart he could not utter.</p>

<p>When he went downstairs again, he found the old woman waiting
for him, with an eager and cunning gleam at once comical and
pathetic in her sharp old eyes, and a great book of newspaper
clippings in her arms.</p>

<p>With an air of complete possession, she took him by the arm,
and thus linked, they entered the hotel restaurant together. As
they went in, it was at once evident that the fame of the young
journalist had preceded him. There was a great scraping of chairs
around the family table and Madame Vatel, her husband, their
comely married daughter, and the daughter's little girl, rose
from the family soup in unison, and received him with a chorus of
smiles, bows, and enchanted murmurs of greeting that alarmed him
by their profuse respectfulness, and that became almost fawningly
obsequious as the Countess began to publish the merits of his
power and influence in a torrential French of which he could only
capture occasional glittering fragments, the chief of which was
the proud name of <i>The New York Times</i>--"le grand journal
am&eacute;ricain."</p>

<p>Then, having muttered out a few desperate words of thanks for
the overwhelming and unexpected warmth of their reception, he and
the Countess were escorted by a bowing waiter to the table which
had been prepared for them at the other end of the restaurant,
near the street entrance. The food--a savoury and wholesome
country soup, broiled fish, succulent thick slices of roast beef,
tender, red, and juicy as none he had ever tasted before, a crisp
and tender salad of endive, and camembert and coffee--was as
delicious as the Countess had predicted; the wine--a Beaujolais,
of which the old woman drank half a glass--both cheap and good;
the service of the old waiter, suave, benevolent, and almost
unctuously attentive; and his own mixed feelings of alarm,
astonishment, embarrassment at the position in which he had been
placed, resentment at the imposture into which the old woman had
compelled him, and wild, helpless, mounting, and astounded
laughter--were explosive, indescribable.</p>

<p>He would look up uneasily from the delicious food to see the
Vatel family, heads together around their table in a congress of
whispering secrecy, and with the imprint of conspiratorial greed
and cunning on their faces. Then they would catch his eye, nudge
one another, and bow and smile at him with fawning graciousness,
and he would return to his food savagely, not knowing whether to
curse or howl with laughter.</p>

<p>During the whole course of the meal, the Countess sat opposite
him, watching like a hawk every move he made, her old eyes
gleaming cunningly and a strange, fixed smile, which he had come
to recognize as being at once crafty and na&iuml;ve, shrewd with
guile and yet pathetically inquiring, hovering faintly upon her
sharp and meagre face.</p>

<p>All the time while he was eating, the old woman kept up her
strange, fragmentary monologue--a semi-coherent discourse which
mirrored forth the very image of her soul and seemed to be
addressed to herself as much as to any listener. With a ravenous
attentiveness she watched him devour his food, exhorted him to
waste none of it, and to sop up the sauce as well, demanded of
the old waiter second helpings of the delicious roast beef,
accompanying her command with a glittering account of the
prosperity that would accrue to him and the hotel as a result of
this solicitude; plied the boy with questions concerning his
friends, his work, his future prospects, and his travels--in
short, pried, probed, wormed and insinuated her way into every
corner of his history, and appointed herself guide and censor of
his life and conduct from this moment on.</p>

<p>"How long have you been over here, my boy?"--she said in her
low but vibrant monotone, which had that curious, dead resonance,
an almost bodiless energy that seems to come from indestructible
vitality of mind or spirit when the vitality of flesh has been
exhausted. It was an energy at once as bitterly tenacious as
man's clutch on life, yet marked all the time by the brooding
fatality of people who have lived too long and seen all things
go--"How long have you been in Europe? . . . And where were you
first? . . . England, yes. . . . And after England. . . . Paris?
Where did you stay there? . . . How much did they charge you for
your room? . . . Twelve francs. . . . Yes, but you could do
better, my boy. . . . You could do much better. . . . You should
find a place for eight francs a day. . . . All the Americans
spend too much money," she said sadly. "They come over here and
waste their money. . . . I have seen so many Americans get
stranded here. . . . During the war I had to help so many out. .
. . Tell me, my boy," she leaned over and clutched his arm with
her claw-like hand, "you are not going to get stranded here like
other Americans, are you?" Her voice had a low, hoarse, and fatal
note in it. "Promise me you won't get stranded here."</p>

<p>He promised her.</p>

<p>"How much money have you got, my boy--eh?" she said, her old
eyes lighted with an avaricious gleam. A sudden apprehension
shocked her; she started forward, saying quickly--"You've got
enough to pay your bill? You've got enough to get you out of
Orl&eacute;ans? . . . You won't get stranded here at the
hotel?"</p>

<p>He reassured her, and with a look of relief she continued:</p>

<p>"You must tell me every day how much you spend. . . . You must
let me watch your money for you. . . . So few young men in
America understand the value of money. . . . They throw it away
as if it were dirt. . . . There are so many ways to waste your
money here in France. . . . We have so many things to spend money
on--it's gone before you know it--restaurants, hotels, liquor,
wine, caf&eacute;s--Ah, caf&eacute;s, caf&eacute;s!" she sighed
with dead fatality. "Caf&eacute;s everywhere you go," she said.
"They are the curse of France. Caf&eacute;s and women. . . . Have
you met the women yet?" she demanded sharply.</p>

<p>He told her that he had.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know," she said, her voice sad with its note of
resigned fatality. "You meet them in caf&eacute;s--bad women,
waiting there to prey upon the young Americans. . . . Tell me--"
the eager gleam awakened in her eyes again--" have you given them
much of your money?"</p>

<p>He told her that he had.</p>

<p>"Ah, I know," she answered sadly. "All the young Americans
waste their money in that way. . . . Don't do it, my boy," her
claw-like hand went out and grasped his arm. "Promise me you will
not give any more money away to those women. . . . They are
<i>bad,</i> bad . . . the shame of France. . . . Get yourself a
nice girl, my boy. . . . I know some nice girls here in
Orl&eacute;ans. . . . I will introduce you--But don't go to the
caf&eacute;s, my boy--Or, if you go, don't talk to any of the
women there. . . . No nice woman here in Orl&eacute;ans goes to
the caf&eacute; . . . all the women that you meet there are bad,
bad. . . . The best caf&eacute;," she concluded irrelevantly, "is
on the Place Martroi. You will find the women there. . . . If you
go, tell me tomorrow about the music. . . . They have good music
there. . . . I love good music. . . . One hears so little music
here in Orl&eacute;ans. . . . There are so few amusements for a
decent woman here. . . . Sometimes I want to go to the
caf&eacute; to hear the music, but if I did I would no longer be
a decent woman. . . . I suppose you'll go to the caf&eacute;
tonight?" she said sadly, fatally, but with an eager glint of
inquiry in her old eyes. "All the Americans go to the
caf&eacute;'s. It's the only place there is to go to here."</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Towards ten o'clock, which was the hour of retiring, he
escaped from her and went to the caf&eacute; of which she had
spoken. There was an orchestra of three pieces playing the kind
of music that is played in French caf&eacute;s; and many mirrors,
and long seats of old worn leather around the walls; and several
young prostitutes sitting singly at tables, patiently ogling the
sporting males of Orl&eacute;ans, who stroked their moustaches
and ogled back, but spent no money on them. And there was one
extremely lovely, blond, seductive and experienced-looking
prostitute from Paris who ogled no one, but sat by herself at a
table, frowning reflectively with half-closed eyes and with a
cigarette in her mouth, studiously involved in solitaire and
completely indifferent to the gallantries of the ogling males of
Orl&eacute;ans, although many a languishing look was cast in her
direction. The men played cards or dominoes together, held their
secret, sly, and whispered conversations, and then roared with
laughter; the caf&eacute; orchestra played the music that a
French caf&eacute; orchestra always plays; the waiters went back
and forth with trays and glasses; the proprietor went from table
to table talking to his regular patrons; the women sat patiently
at tables, and smiled and ogled when they caught somebody's eye;
and somehow the whole scene was instantly, poignantly familiar,
like something he had known all his life.</p>

<p>And he did not know why this was true. But something essential
in the substance and the structure of the scene--the beautiful
and sophisticated prostitute from Paris, the seducers and
gallants of the town of Orl&eacute;ans, the feeling of silence,
secrecy, and darkness all around him in the old sleeping town--in
which this place was now the only spot of warmth and gaiety and
lightness--even the occasional shrill fife and piping whistle at
the railway station not far away--all these things and people had
their counterpart, somehow, in the life of small towns everywhere
and in the life he had known in a small town as a child, when he
had lain in his bed in darkness and had heard the distant wail
and thunder of a departing train, and had seen then in the
central core and vision of his heart's desire, his image of the
distant, the shining, the fabulous, thousand-spired, magic city,
and had thought then of a lovely and seductive red-haired woman
named Norah Ryan, who had that year come from the great city to
live there in his mother's house, and whose coming and whose
going would always be a thing of mystery and wonder to them all;
and felt, then, as now, all around him the numb nocturnal
stillness of the town, the impending prescience of wild joy, the
heartbeats of ten thousand sleeping men.</p>

<p>And this feeling of unutterable loss and familiarity, of
strangeness and reality, remained with him later when he left the
closing caf&eacute; and walked home towards his hotel through a
silent, cobbled street, between rows of old, still houses, the
shuttered secrecy of the shops.</p>

<p>And later, the feeling was more strong and strange than ever,
as he lay in his sumptuous bed in the hotel, reading the
clippings in the Countess's books--those incredible explosions of
Yankee journalese that this old woman had inspired in a thousand
little towns across America--brought back here, read here now, in
the midnight stillness of this ancient town as the great
cathedral bells thronged through the air--the miraculous weavings
of dark chance and destiny, all near as his heart and farther off
than heaven, familiar as his life, and stranger than a dream.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>In the weeks that followed, the boy discovered in the totally
absurd, yet curiously persuasive illogic of the woman's mind a
revealing illustration of the psychology of fraud, the
self-hypnosis of the impostor. When he would protest to her at
the effrontery of her representations, the staggering fiction she
had now woven about him, his family, his wealth, his power, his
influence, and his profession, which made an open, barefaced use
of great names and institutions of which he had no knowledge and
to which he could make no claim, the old woman would answer him
at once with a series of arguments so ingeniously persuasive that
for a moment he would find himself almost conquered by their
hypnotic power, absurdly false though he knew them to be.</p>

<p>"Look here," he would say resentfully. "What do you mean by
telling all these people that I represent <i>The New York
Times?</i> What if <i>The New York Times</i> should hear about it
and have me thrown in jail for fraud--for using their name when I
had no right to do it?--You'd be safe--you would," he said
bitterly. "I'd be the one to suffer--<i>you</i> could always get
out of it by saying that you acted in good faith, that you really
thought I <i>did</i> work for <i>The Times."</i></p>

<p>"But you <i>do,</i> don't you?" She looked at him with a
surprised and puzzled face.</p>

<p>"No!" he shouted. "Of course I don't! And I never told you so,
either! It's something you made up out of your own head five
minutes after I met you, and nothing I could say would stop
you.--Now you've told people all over the town that I'm writing
stories about Orl&eacute;ans for <i>The New York Times,</i> and
am going to put <i>them</i> in the stories. We've accepted
favours, got things at reduced prices and been entertained by
these people all because you told them I am working for <i>The
Times</i> and that they are going to get some free publicity out
of it. Don't you realize what that is?" he said angrily, glaring
at her. "That's fraud. That's getting something by false
pretence. You can be put in jail for that! . . . Why, the next
thing I know you'll be getting money from them--collecting a
commission from them for getting me to write them up. Perhaps you
have already, for all I know," he concluded bitterly.</p>

<p>"But you did tell me that you were a journalist, my boy," the
old woman said gently. "You told me that, you know."</p>

<p>"Well--yes," he sullenly admitted. "I did tell you that. I
said that because I want to be a writer, and I've done nothing
yet--and somehow it didn't seem so big to say I was a journalist.
. . . Besides," he blundered on uncertainly, "I thought the word
had a kind of different meaning here from what it has at
home--"</p>

<p>She nodded her head briskly with a satisfied air:</p>

<p>"Exactly. . . . A journalist is one who contributes articles
and sketches on timely subjects to current publications. . . .
And you've done that, haven't you?"</p>

<p>"Well," he conceded, "I wrote some pieces for the university
magazine when I was at college--"</p>

<p>"Ah-h! Exactly!"--this with an air of triumph.</p>

<p>"And I was editor of the college newspaper."</p>

<p>"But of course! Just as I say!"</p>

<p>"And I suppose I did write news stories about the university
once in a while and send them to the paper back home."</p>

<p>"Of course you did, my boy! Of course!"</p>

<p>"And I did write what they call a feature article one time and
sold it to a paper. . . . And I wrote a one-act play and it was
published in a book and I've had so far eight dollars royalty on
it," he concluded his recital with a meagre glow of hope, a lame
belief that his journalistic pretensions were not wholly
fraudulent.</p>

<p>"But--" the Countess lifted astounded eyebrows and looked
about her with a fine gesture of the hands expressive of
bewilderment--"just as I <i>say,</i> my boy! Just as I
<i>say.</i> From what you tell me there's no doubt of it! You are
a journalist."</p>

<p>"Well," he conceded gloomily, "I guess if you can establish my
reputation from that, I could swear to what I've told you. . . .
Oh, yes," he added ironically, "and I forgot to tell you that I
got up early in the morning and delivered papers when I was a
kid."</p>

<p>"Exactly! Exactly!" she nodded seriously--"you showed a talent
for your present work right from the start. You have been trained
in your profession since childhood."</p>

<p>"Oh, my God!" he groaned. "What's the use? Have it your own
way, then. I can't argue with you. . . . Only, for God's sake,
Countess, stop telling people around here that I am working for
<i>The New York Times."</i></p>

<p>"Now, my boy, see here; you mustn't be so modest about things.
If you don't learn to blow your own trumpet a little no one else
will do it for you. As clever and brilliant as you are, you
mustn't be so self-effacing. What if you are not yet editor of
<i>The New York Times</i>--?"</p>

<p>"Editor! Editor, hell! I'm not even office-boy!"</p>

<p>"But, of <i>course,</i> my dear!" she said patiently. "You
will be some day. But at the present time you are a rising young
journalist of great gifts, for whom all of your confr&egrave;res
of <i>The Times</i> are expecting a brilliant career--"</p>

<p>"Now, Countess, you look here--"</p>

<p>She waved her hand tolerantly with a dismissing gesture, and
went on:</p>

<p>"All that will come," she said. "You are still young--no one
expects you to be editor yet."</p>

<p>"You'll have me editor if you talk much longer," he said
sarcastically. "I wouldn't put it past you. But if you're
determined to tell people I'm a journalist, why drag in <i>The
New York Times?</i> After all, I could pretend to be a journalist
without feeling an utter fraud. So why drag in <i>The
Times?"</i></p>

<p>"Ah," she said. <i>"The Times</i> is a great newspaper. People
have heard of <i>The Times.</i> To say you are connected with
<i>The Times</i> means something, carries prestige."</p>

<p>"Well, if it's prestige you want, why don't you tell them I'm
a college professor? You know, I did work as an instructor for a
year in New York. If you told them I'm a professor I could at
least feel a little less guilty."</p>

<p>"Oh," she said seriously, "but no one here would believe such
a story as that. You are too young to be a professor. Besides,"
she added practically, "it is much better, anyway, to tell them
you are working for <i>The Times."</i></p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because," she patiently explained, "they can see some value
in that. The power of the press is great. A professor could do
nothing for them. A clever young man writing articles for <i>The
Times</i> might do much."</p>

<p>"But, damn it," he cried, in an exasperated tone, "I've never
written articles for <i>The Times.</i> Can't you understand
that?"</p>

<p>"Now, see here, my boy," she said quietly. "Try to be
reasonable about this thing. What's the use of confusing these
people here with needless explanations? What does it matter if
you haven't written articles for <i>The Times?</i> You <i>are</i>
writing them now--"</p>

<p>"Oh, hell, Countess!"</p>

<p>"You are going to write these very brilliant and interesting
articles about Orl&eacute;ans," she went on calmly, "and they
will be published in <i>The New York Times,</i> because they will
be so very clever that <i>The New York Times</i> will want to
publish them. So why tell these simple people here anything more
than that? It would only confuse them. I have told them nothing
but the truth," she said virtuously, "I have told them you are
writing a series of articles about Orl&eacute;ans for the great
newspaper, <i>The New York Times,</i> and that, my boy, is all
they need to know." She smiled tranquilly at him. He gave up.</p>

<p>"All right," he said. "You win. Have it your own way. I'm
anything you like--the white-haired boy, the prize performer, the
crown jewel of <i>The New York Times."</i></p>

<p>She nodded with approval.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>The farce grew more extravagant day by day. And because this
fantastic chance had somewhat dulled the smothering ache that had
been almost constant since his parting with Ann, Elinor, and
Starwick, he stayed on from day to day, not knowing why he stayed
or why he should depart, but held with a kind of hypnotic
interest by this web of absurd circumstance in which he had so
swiftly been involved.</p>

<p>In the morning, when he came downstairs, the old woman would
be waiting for him and would sharply and eagerly catechize him
about his conduct the night before.</p>

<p>"Did you go to the caf&eacute; last night, my dear? . . . How
much did you have to drink? Eh? . . . A Pernod, four cognacs,
coffee, a packet of cigarettes. . . . What did that come to, eh?
. . . How much did you spend? . . . Twenty-one francs! . . . Ah,
my dear, too much, too much!" she clucked sadly and regretfully.
"You will spend all your money in caf&eacute;'s and have nothing
to go on with! . . . Tell me, now, my dear," her old eyes had an
eager glint of curiosity, "were there many people there? . . .
Was the place crowded? . . . Were there many women? . . . You
didn't talk to any of the girls, did you?" she said sharply.</p>

<p>He said that he had.</p>

<p>"You should not have done that!" she said reproachfully. "And
what did she want? She wanted you to come with her, eh?"</p>

<p>"No; we didn't get that far. She asked me for a
cigarette."</p>

<p>"And did you give it to her?"</p>

<p>"Yes, of course."</p>

<p>"But no money! You didn't give her any money?" she said
feverishly.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Did you buy her a drink? . . . Was that what all the cognac
was for?"</p>

<p>"No. It was for me."</p>

<p>"How much money have you left, my boy? . . . Are you keeping
track of your expenses? . . . Did you get another of those
express cheques cashed yesterday?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I did."</p>

<p>"What kind? A ten-dollar one?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Ah, you shouldn't have done that," she said regretfully.
"Once you cash it, it goes quickly." She snapped her fingers,
"like that! &Ccedil;a file! &Ccedil;a file!--You do not watch
your money as you should. You do not keep track of what you
spend. . . . My boy, promise me something, will you?" she went on
in a low, earnest tone. "Promise me you won't spend all your
money and get stranded here. . . . You won't do that, will you? .
. . How much money have you left? . . . Tell me," she said
eagerly. "How many of those express cheques have you left? . . .
Count it, count it," she demanded greedily. "Take the book out
and let me see what you have left."</p>

<p>He took out the little leather folder of express cheques and
opened it. It was getting very thin. Then he thumbed rapidly
through the little sheaf of cheques, trying to get it over as
quickly as he could because of its distasteful reminder of a
harsh reality he wanted to forget. He not only lacked by nature
the sense of money, he was also at the blissful period in a young
man's life when one hundred dollars is as good as a million. In
fact, with twenty dollars in bright, flimsy fifty-franc notes in
his pocket, the pleasant terrace of a good caf&eacute;, a drink,
the knowledge of delicious food and wine within, and the slow,
sensual meditations of desire, he felt as rich as any millionaire
on earth. At such a time, the whole earth lay before him in
winding vistas of pleasure, joy, and mystery: in the huge
unreason of this enchantment he was sure that there was nothing
ahead of him but a beautiful and fortunate life, filled with
success and happiness, and if by any chance he thought of money,
it was only to dismiss the thought impatiently with the
irrational conviction that it would always be ready when he
needed it, that it would come to him miraculously and wonderfully
like manna out of heaven, that he could get great sums of money,
in many strange, delightful ways, at any time he wanted it.</p>

<p>Now the Countess, by the harsh worldliness of her insistence,
had jarred him back to a disquieting reality for which he had no
relish. While the old woman followed every movement with greedy,
avaricious eyes glued on the cheques, he thumbed them over
quickly and sullenly, told her curtly their amount, and thrust
the book brusquely back into his pocket.</p>

<p>When he had finished, she shook her head at him with sad
reproach.</p>

<p>"Ah!" she said, "what extravagance! A French family could have
lived comfortably for a month on what you have spent here in the
last week."</p>

<p>He winced and stirred restlessly, pierced suddenly with a
nameless sense of guilt and shame, and personal unworthiness, a
sudden evocation of the infinite toil and minute saving of his
mother's life. And he felt this despite the fact that his mother
had now acquired a considerable estate, a large sum of money,
and, in spite of her parsimonious economies in innumerable small
ways, displayed in her real estate investments a riotous
extravagance that far surpassed any of his own on the sensual
pleasures of food and drink and books, on voyages and women. And
this curious and irrational sense of guilt and shame was, he
knew, not peculiar to himself, but rooted somehow in the
structure of the lives of most of the Americans he had known. It
was something that went back almost past time and memory, that
they had always had, that was distilled out of their blood and
drawn from the very air they breathed: a feeling that any life
not based on gainful labour, any life devoted openly and nakedly
to pleasure, idleness and leisure, and the gratification of one's
own desires, was, somehow, an ignoble and shameful life.</p>

<p>Now, suddenly torn with this old and irremediable sense of
guilt, he scowled suddenly, fidgeted restlessly in his chair, and
then spoke sharply and angrily to the old woman, who sat with her
sad, reproachful gaze upon him.</p>

<p>"Well, it's spent now, it's gone, it can't be helped. What do
you expect people to do with money, anyway?" he said irritably.
"Count it and kiss it and say good night to it every time they go
to sleep--and kiss it and count it over again every time they
wake up, to see none of it has got away from them in the night?
What's it for, anyway, if it's not to spend? What are you living
for?" he said bitterly. "What are you waiting for? Are you saving
your money so you can have a nice coffin when they bury you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my boy, but you spend so much on food and drink and on
the girls," the old woman said in a sad tone. "So much of it goes
on things like that."</p>

<p>"And why not?" he said resentfully. "Will you please tell me
what else I should spend it on? Is there anything better than
that to spend it on?"</p>

<p>"Don't spend it on those girls in the caf&eacute;," she said.
"They are bad--bad--they will bring you nothing but misfortune
and trouble. Come," she said, getting up briskly. "I shall take
you with me this morning and introduce you to two nice girls. You
will be better off with them than with those women in the
caf&eacute;."</p>

<p>They went out and walked along the streets of the old town,
brisk with morning life, cheerful with the thin, musty yellow of
a wintry sun. As they walked along those streets of morning, many
people recognized the old woman and spoke respectfully to her.
Sometimes shopkeepers spoke to her from doorways, smiling
good-naturedly at the sight of the little old woman trotting
briskly along beside the towering height of the young man.
Sometimes she would hear their laughter and bantering comment
among themselves about the ludicrous disproportion of the pair,
and then, turning to the young man, she would laugh in an
abstracted and yet pleased way, saying:</p>

<p>"Ah--hah--hah! They are laughing at you and me, boy. They
think it is very funny, the way we look together. . . . Un grand
gar&ccedil;on, eh?" she called out to a man standing in the
doorway of a shop, who was measuring the boy up and down with a
look of good-natured astonishment.</p>

<p>"Mon Dieu!" the man cried. "Qu'il est grand! Il mange beaucoup
de soupe!"</p>

<p>At length they stopped before a small millinery shop, where
the old woman was having a hat made, and went in. A small bell
tinkled thinly as they entered, and the milliner and her
assistant came out from behind some curtains to greet them. The
milliner was a competent-looking woman of thirty years, dark,
with a wide face and a strong, compact, and yet seductive figure.
The assistant was younger, taller, and fair in colouring. Both
were attractive girls, and both greeted him with smiles and the
exclamation of good-natured astonishment that he had heard upon
the street. Then, for several minutes, the little shop was gay
with the light, rapid French of the three women. All seemed to be
talking and laughing at the same time, in excited tones; he saw
that the Countess was eagerly publishing his merits to the two
girls, he caught the magic phrase <i>The New York Times</i> now
and then, the two girls kept glancing at him with smiling faces,
and presently the older one, who was the proprietress, walked
towards him, measured her height against his shoulder, and then,
with a little laugh of astonishment, said:</p>

<p>"Mon Dieu! Qu'il est grand!"</p>

<p>The younger of the two girls, laughing, made a reply in rapid
French which he could not follow, and the Countess, with a little
chuckle of satisfaction, turned towards him, saying in an
explanatory manner:</p>

<p>"They say they need you here, my dear, to get boxes down from
the top shelf. It's too tall for them."</p>

<p>"Mon Dieu, oui!" the younger, taller girl, who had picked up
the hat she had been making for the old woman and was shaping it
in her hands, now answered instantly. "He can help
H&eacute;l&egrave;ne now with the box while you try this on.
H&eacute;l&egrave;ne," she called to the other girl, "show
Monsieur where the boxes are and have him get one down for
you."</p>

<p>He followed H&eacute;l&egrave;ne through the curtains to the
rear of the shop, pursued by the laughter and chattering comment
of the other two women. Upon a shelf in the rear a number of
hat-boxes were stacked up, but when he looked inquiringly at
H&eacute;l&egrave;ne, she smiled good-naturedly, and kindly
said:</p>

<p>"Mais non, monsieur. Nous ne sommes pas s&eacute;rieuses.
Attendez," and got up briskly on a chair, reaching for a box
herself. It was, in fact, almost out of reach; she touched it
with her outstretched finger-tips, dislodged it, it came tumbling
down, and he caught it as it fell. And H&eacute;l&egrave;ne
herself came close to falling. She teetered uncertainly on her
unsteady balance, swayed towards him, and he lifted her down. For
a moment her weight was strong and palpable in his arms. He put
her down reluctantly, and for an instant or two she stood flat
against him, her hands gently resting on his arms. Then, with a
pleasant little laugh, she said:</p>

<p>"Oh, l&agrave;, l&agrave;! Qu'il est fort!"</p>

<p>They went out front again, the Countess finished trying on the
hat, and presently, after another burst of gay and rapid talk, he
and the old woman departed. As he went out, the little bell
tinkled thinly and pleasantly again; he had to stoop to go
through the door. He turned to say good-bye again, the two girls
were looking towards him with gay and friendly smiles; he was
sorry to go and wanted some excuse for staying.
H&eacute;l&egrave;ne looked strong and competent and desirable,
she smiled at him a friendly farewell: he thought if he came back
again she would be glad to see him, but he never saw her after
that.</p>

<p>Later the two girls stayed in his memory with a vivid,
pleasant warmth: he thought of H&eacute;l&egrave;ne many times,
her strong seductive figure and her wide, dark face, and he
wondered what her life had been, if she had married, and what
time had brought to her.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The crowning extravagance of the Countess's misrepresentation
was revealed one morning when he found a letter addressed to him
in a firm, feminine, and completely unfamiliar handwriting. The
Countess had spoken to him several times of a great noblewoman in
the neighbourhood, who lived in a magnificent ch&acirc;teau, and
with whom, it was obvious, the Countess wished to improve her
slight acquaintance. Now, upon opening the letter, the following
message greeted his astounded eye:</p>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Le Ch&acirc;teau de Mornaye,</p>

<p>February 23, 1925.</p>

<p>My dear Mr. Gant:</p>

<p>My old friend, La Comtesse de Caux, informs me that you are
spending some time in Orl&eacute;ans preparing a series of
articles for the great journal you represent, <i>The New York
Times.</i></p>

<p>It will be a great pleasure to me if you, together with La
Comtesse, will give me the honour of your presence at Mornaye for
luncheon on Thursday, the twenty-sixth. La Comtesse de Caux
informs me that you became acquainted with my son Paul when he
visited America with Le Mar&eacute;chal Foch in 1922, and that a
warm friendship grew up between you at that time. I have often
heard my son speak of his American tour, and of the dear
friendships he made there, and I know how keen will be his regret
when he hears that you were here and that he missed you. He is at
present, I regret to say, at Paris, but I have written informing
him of your presence here.</p>

<p>At any rate, it will give me great pleasure to welcome one of
my son's American friends to Mornaye, and I am looking forward to
your visit with the most eager anticipation. La Comtesse de Caux
has already informed me of your acceptance, and my motor will be
waiting for you at the village station, Thursday, the
twenty-sixth, at noon.</p>

<p>Until then, ever sincerely yours,</p>

<p>MATHILDE, MARQUISE DE MORNAYE.</p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<p>He read the letter a second time, anger swelling in a hot
flood as its full significance was revealed to him. When he at
length found the Countess, he was so choked with exasperation
that for a moment he could not speak, but stood glaring at her
with infuriated eyes, holding the crumpled letter in one clenched
fist.</p>

<p>"Now, you look here," he said at length in a smothered tone,
"you look here--" he held the letter out and shook it furiously
under her nose. "What do you mean by a thing like this?"</p>

<p>She returned his furious gaze with a glance of bright inquiry,
took the letter from his hand, and immediately, after looking at
it, said cheerfully:</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! La Marquise has written to you, as she said she
would. Did I not tell you I had great things in store for you?"
she said triumphantly. "Ah, my boy, how fortunate you were in
finding me the way you did! Do you realize how few Americans ever
have the opportunity you are getting? Here you are, a boy of
twenty-four, being received with open arms into one of the
greatest families in France. Why, there are American millionaires
who would pay a fortune for the privilege!"</p>

<p>"Now, you see here," he said again in a choking tone. "What do
you mean by doing a thing like this behind my back?"</p>

<p>She raised puzzled eyebrows inquiringly.</p>

<p>"Behind your back? What do you mean, my boy?"</p>

<p>"What right have you got to tell this woman I had accepted her
invitation, when you never spoke to me about it?"</p>

<p>"But!" she said, with a small protesting gasp--"I was sure you
would be delighted! It never occurred to me that you wouldn't be!
I felt sure you'd jump at the opportunity!"</p>

<p>"Opportunity!" he jeered. "Opportunity for what? Opportunity
to let you tell this woman a pack of lies about me, and try to
work her with some trick or dodge that you've got up your
sleeve!"</p>

<p>"I have no idea what you're talking about," she said, with
quiet dignity.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, you have!" he snarled. "You know very well what I'm
talking about. You've told these lying stories and misrepresented
things to people ever since I met you, but you've gone too far
this time. What the hell do you mean by telling this woman that I
am a good friend of her son's and met him in America?" He picked
up the letter and shook it in her face again. "What do you mean
by telling her such a lie as that?"</p>

<p>"Lie!" Her brows were lifted with an air of pained surprise.
"Why, my boy, you told me that you did know her son."</p>

<p><i>"I</i> told you!" he fairly screamed. "I told you nothing!
I never knew the woman had a son until I got this letter."</p>

<p>"Listen, my friend," the Countess spoke gently and patiently
as she would speak to a child. "Think back a little, won't
you--?"</p>

<p>"Think back my eye!" he said rudely. "There's nothing to think
back about. It's another lying story you made up on the spur of
the moment, and you know it!"</p>

<p>"Don't you remember," she went on in the same quiet and
patient voice, "--don't you remember telling me you were a
student at Harvard University?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I did tell you that. And that was true. What has that
got to do with knowing this woman's son?"</p>

<p>"Wait!" she said quietly. "Don't you remember telling me that
you were there at Harvard when Marshal Foch made his visit to
America?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I did tell you that."</p>

<p>"And that you saw him when he visited the university? You told
me that, you know."</p>

<p>"Of course I did! I did see him. Everyone else saw him, too.
He stood on the steps of the library with his aides, and saluted
while they fired the cannon off!"</p>

<p>"Ah!--With his aides, you say?" she said eagerly.</p>

<p>"Yes, of course, what's wrong with that?"</p>

<p>"But nothing is wrong! It's all just as I said!--Among his
aides, now," she said persuasively, "did you not notice a young
man, with a little moustache, about twenty-five years old,
dressed in the uniform of a captain in the French army?--Think
now, my boy," she went on coaxingly--"a young man--much younger
than the other officers on the Marshal's staff?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps I did," he said impatiently. "How should I remember
now? What difference does it make?"</p>

<p>"Because that young man, my dear," the Countess patiently
explained, "that you saw standing there with the Marshal is the
young Marquis--this woman's son."</p>

<p>He stared at her with fascinated disbelief.</p>

<p>"And do you mean to tell me," he said presently, "that because
I may have seen someone like that standing in a great crowd of
people three years ago, you had the gall to tell that woman that
I knew her son--that we were friends?"</p>

<p>"No, no," the Countess said evasively, a little nervously. "I
didn't tell her that, my dear. I'm sure I didn't tell her that.
She must have misunderstood me. All I said was that you
<i>saw</i> her son when he was in America. I'm sure that was all
I said. And that was true, wasn't it? You <i>did</i> see him,
didn't you?" she said triumphantly.</p>

<p>He stared at her, with mouth ajar, unable for a moment to
comprehend the full enormity of such deception. Then he closed
his jaws with a stubborn snap, and said:</p>

<p>"All right. You got yourself into this, now you get out of it.
I'm not going with you."</p>

<p>The old woman's eyes were suddenly sharp with apprehension.
She leaned forward, clutched him by the arm, and said
pleadingly:</p>

<p>"Oh, my boy, you wouldn't do a thing like that to me, would
you? Think what it means to me--the humiliation you would cause
me now if you refused to go."</p>

<p>"I can't help that. You had no right to make arrangements with
the woman, in the first place, before you spoke to me. Even that
wouldn't matter so much if you hadn't told her that other story
about her son and me. That's the reason she's inviting
me--because she thinks her son and I were friends. How can I
accept such an invitation--take advantage of the woman's
hospitality because you told her a story that had no truth in
it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that doesn't matter," the Countess spoke quickly,
eagerly. "If you want me to, I shall explain to her that there
was a mistake--that you really do not know her son. But it makes
no difference, anyway. She would want you to come just the
same.--You see," she spoke carefully, and for a moment there was
a gleam of furtive, cunning understanding in her eye--the wisdom
of fox for fox--"I don't think it's exactly for that reason she
is inviting you."</p>

<p>"What other reason could there be? The woman does not know me.
What other interest could she have in me?"</p>

<p>"Well, my boy--" the Countess hesitated, and spoke
carefully--"you see, it's this way. I think she wants to speak to
you," she paused carefully again before she spoke--"about a
certain matter--about something she's interested in--When she
heard that you were connected with <i>The New York
Times</i>--"</p>

<p><i>"What!"</i> He stared at her again, and suddenly exploded
in a short angry laugh of resignation and defeat--"Are the whole
crowd of you alike? Is there a single one of you who doesn't have
some scheme, some axe to grind--who doesn't hope to get something
out of Americans--"</p>

<p>"Then you'll go?" she said eagerly.</p>

<p>"Yes, I'll go!" he shouted. "Tell her anything you like. It'll
serve both of you right! I'll go just to see what new trick or
scheme you and this other woman are framing up. All right, I'll
go!"</p>

<p>"Good!" she nodded briskly, satisfied. "I knew you would, my
boy. La Marquise will tell you all about it when she sees
you."</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>This final grotesque episode had suddenly determined his
decision to leave Orl&eacute;ans. For a short time his chance
meeting with this strange old woman, his instant inclusion in the
curious schemes, designs and stratagems of her life, with all
that it evoked of the strange and the familiar, its haunting
glimpse of the million-noted web and weaving of dark chance and
destiny, had struck bright sparks of interest from his mind, had
fused his spirit to a brief forgetfulness and wonder.</p>

<p>Now, as suddenly as it had begun, that wonder died: the life
of the town, the people, the old Countess and her friends, which
had for a few days seemed so new, strange, and interesting, now
filled him with weariness and distaste. He was suddenly fed up
with the provincial tedium of the town, he felt the old dislike
and boredom that all dark bloods and races could awake in him an
importunate and unreasonable desire, beneath these soft, dull
skies of grey, for something bright, sharp, Northern, fierce, and
wild, in life--for something gold and blue and shining, the
lavish flesh of great blond women, the surge of savage
drunkenness, the fatal desperation of strong joy. The dark,
strange faces of the Frenchmen all around, and all the hard
perfection of that life, at once so alien and so drearily
familiar, the unwearied energies of their small purposes fixed
there in the small perfection of their universe, so dully
ignorant of the world, so certain of itself, filled him suddenly
with exasperation and dislike. He was tired suddenly of their
darkness, their smallness, their hardness, their cat-like
nervousness, their incessant ebullience, their unwearied and yet
joyless vitalities, and the dreary monotony of their timeless
greed.</p>

<p>He was tired of Orl&eacute;ans, tired of the Vatels; most of
all tired, with a feeling of weary disgust and dislike, of the
old Countess and all the small tricks and schemings of her
life.</p>

<p>And with this sudden weariness and distaste, this loss of
interest in a life which had for a week or two devoured his
interest, the old torment and unrest of spirit had returned.
Again the old question had returned in all its naked desolation:
"Why here? And where shall I go now? What shall I do?" He saw,
with a return of the old naked shame, in a flash of brutal
revelation, the aimless lack of purpose in his wandering. He saw
that there had been no certain reason, no valid purpose, for his
coming here to Orl&eacute;ans, and with a sense of drowning
horror, as if the phial of his spirit had exploded like a flash
of ether and emptied out into the formless spaces of a planetary
vacancy, he felt that there was no purpose and no reason for his
going anywhere.</p>

<p>And yet the demons of unrest and tortured wandering had
returned with all their fury: he knew that he must leave, that he
must go on to some other destination, and he knew nowhere to go.
Like a drowning man who clutches at a straw, he sought for some
goal or purpose in his life, some justification for his
wanderings, some target for his fierce desire. A thousand plans
and projects suggested themselves to him, and each one seemed
more futile, hopeless, barren than the rest. He would return to
Paris and "settle down and write." He would go back to England,
get a room in London, go to Oxford, the Lake District, Cornwall,
Devon--a thousand towns and places, evoked by a thousand fleeting
memories, returned to argue some reasonable purpose for his blind
wandering. Or he would go to the South of France, "to some quiet
place," or to Switzerland, "to some quiet place," or to Germany,
Vienna, Italy, Spain, Majorca,--always "to settle down in some
quiet place"--and for what? for what? Why, always, of course, "to
write," "to write"--Great God! "to write," and even as he spoke
the words the old dull shame returned to make him hate his life
and all these sterile, vain pretensions of his soul. "To
write"--always to seek the magic skies, the golden clime, the
wise and lovely people who would transform him. "To
write"--always to seek in the enchanted distances, in the dreamy
perspectives of a fool's delusions, the power and certitude he
could not draw out of himself. "To write"--to be that most
foolish, vain, and impotent of all impostors, a man who sought
the whole world over "looking for a place to write," when, he
knew now, with every naked, brutal penetration of his life, "the
place to write" was Brooklyn, Boston, Hammersmith, or
Kansas--anywhere on earth, so long as the heart, the power, the
faith, the desperation, the bitter and unendurable necessity, and
the naked courage were there inside him all the time.</p>

<p>Now, having agreed to accompany the Countess on her visit to
the Marquise, he suddenly decided to leave Orl&eacute;ans at the
same time, spend the night at Blois, and go on to Tours the next
day, after visiting Mornaye. And with this purpose he packed his
bag, paid his bill at the hotel, and set out on the appointed day
with the old woman who for two weeks now had been his
self-constituted guide and keeper.</p>

<p> </p>

<center>
<h1>XCV</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>The village of Mornaye was a small and ancient settlement,
similar to thousands of others, situated near the gate of the
ch&acirc;teau from which it got its name. A man was waiting for
them at the station with a motor car: they got in and were driven
swiftly through the town--a dense cluster of old grey-lemon
buildings with tiled roofs, a thatched one here and there, the
shops of the village grocer, cobbler, baker, visible through
small dormer windows, some farm buildings, a fleeting glimpse of
the old cobbled court yard of a barn, some wagons and farm
implements--a little universe of life, compact, unbroken, built
up to the edge of the road--and then, almost immediately, the
gates of the ch&acirc;teau.</p>

<p>They drove through the gates and down a long and stately
avenue of noble trees, and presently came to a halt before the
great entrance of the ch&acirc;teau. As they approached, a
footman came swiftly down the steps, opened the door of the car,
and bowed, and in another moment, led by the man, they had
entered the hall and were being escorted into the great salon
where their hostess was awaiting them.</p>

<p>La Marquise de Mornaye was a woman of about sixty, but from
the energy and vigour of her appearance she seemed to be in the
very prime of life. She was an extraordinary figure of a woman,
as tall and strong-looking as a man, with a personal quality that
was almost mountainously impressive in its command. The image of
the boy's recent discontent had so shaped the French as a dark
and swarthy people of mean stature that it was now startling to
be confronted by a woman of this grand proportion.</p>

<p>She had a wide, round face, smooth, brown and unwrinkled, such
as one often finds in peasant people; her eyes were round,
bright, and shrewd, webbed minutely by fine wrinkles at the
corners. She had strong, coarse hair of grey, brushed vigorously
back from a wide, low forehead. She was big in foot and limb and
body, everything about the woman was strong, large and vigorous
except her hands. And her hands were plump, white, tiny, as
useless-looking as a baby's, shockingly disproportionate to the
power and vigour of the rest of her big frame.</p>

<p>The woman had on a long, brown dress that completely covered
her from neck to toe: it was a strangely old-fashioned
garment--or, rather, it did not seem to have any fashion or style
whatsoever--but it was, nevertheless, a magnificent garment, in
its plain and homely strength perfectly appropriate to the
extraordinary woman who wore it.</p>

<p>In every respect--in word, tone, gesture, look, and act--the
woman showed a plain, forceful, and immensely able character. Her
strong, brown face was friendly, yet shrewd and knowing; she
greeted the Countess cordially, but it was evident from the
humour in her round, bright eyes that she was no fool in the ways
of the world and perfectly able to hold her own in any worldly
encounter.</p>

<p>She was waiting for them, erect and smiling, as they entered
the great salon, a magnificent room at least forty feet in
length, warmly, luxuriously, yet plainly furnished, and with
nothing cold or repellent in its grand proportions. She greeted
the Countess immediately and cordially, extending her plump
little white hand in a friendly greeting, and bending and kissing
the little wren-like woman on her withered cheek. La Marquise, in
deference to her young American guest, spoke English from the
beginning. And her English, like everything else about her, was
plain, forceful, and direct, completely fluent, although marked
with a heavy accent.</p>

<p>"'Ow are you, my dear?" La Marquise said, as she kissed the
other woman on the cheek. "It is good to see you again after
these so many years. 'Ow long 'as it been since you were last at
Mornaye?"</p>

<p>"Almost seven years, Marquise," the Countess answered eagerly.
"The last time--do you remember?--was in the spring of 1918."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes," the other answered benevolently. "Now I can
remember. You were here when many of our so brave
Am&eacute;ricains were quartered here at Mornaye--Monsieur," she
said, using this reference as an introduction, and turning to the
boy with her plump little hand extended in a movement of kindly
greeting, "I am delighted. I meck apologies for my son. I know he
will so much regret not seeing you."</p>

<p>He flushed, and stammered out his thanks: she seemed to take
no notice of his embarrassment and, having completed her friendly
welcome, she turned smilingly to the Countess again, and
said:</p>

<p>"And 'ow 'ave you been, my dear? You are looking very well,"
she said approvingly, "and no older dan you were de lest time you
were here. I s'ink," she said smilingly, including the young man
now in her friendly humour--"I s'ink la Comtesse must 'ave
discover--wat you call it, eh?" she shrugged--"ze se-<i>cret</i>
of ze fountain of yout', eh?"</p>

<p>"Ah, Marquise," the Countess fawned greedily upon the grand
woman, obviously elated by these signs of
intimacy--"ah--hah--hah! it is so kind of you to say so--but I
fear I have grown much older since I saw you last. I have known
great trouble," she said sadly, "and, as you know, Marquise, my
health has not been good."</p>

<p>"Non?" the other said with an air of solicitous inquiry. "I am
so sor<i>-ree,"</i> she continued in a tone of unimpeachable
regret, which nevertheless showed that the Countess's health or
lack of it was really of no moment to her whatever. "Perhaps, my
dear, it is ze wretchet cleemat here. I s'ink perhaps you should
go Sout' in vintaire--ah, monsieur," she continued regretfully,
turning to the youth, "you see Mornaye at a bat season of ze
year--I fear you may be disappointed by our coun<i>-tree.</i> I
'ope you vill come beck some time in sprink. Zen, I s'ink you
vill agree la France is beautiful."</p>

<p>"I should like to," he replied.</p>

<p>"But oh, zis vintaire! Zis <i>vintaire!"</i> La Marquise cried
with passionate distaste, folding her arms and drawing herself
together in a movement of chilled ardour as she looked through a
tall French door across one of those magnificent and opulent
vistas that one finds in France, an architecture of proud, comely
space into whose proportionate dimensions even nature herself has
been compelled. It was a tremendous sweep of velvet sward, that
faded into misty distances and that was cut cleanly on each side
by the smoky denseness of her forest parks. Her shrewd eyes
ranged across this noble prospect for a moment in an expression
of chilled distaste. Then, with a slight contracted shudder of
her folded arms, she turned, and said wearily:</p>

<p>"Ah, zis vintaire! Zis <i>vintaire!</i> Sometimes I s'ink it
vill nevaire end. Every day," she went on indignantly, "it rain,
rain, rain! All vintaire lonk I see noz<i>-zing</i> but rain! I
get up in ze mornink and look out--and it rain! I turn my beck
and zen look out again--it rain! I take a nep, I get up, I go to
bet--always it rain!" She shrugged her shoulders comically and
turning to the boy with a glint of shrewdly cynical humour, she
said, "I s'ink if it keep on ve 'ave again--vat you call
it?--Noah's Floot, eh?"</p>

<p>The Countess clucked sympathetically at this watery chronicle
of woe, and said:</p>

<p>"But have you been here by yourself all winter? I should think
you would get awfully lonely, my dear," she went on in a tone of
ingratiating commiseration. "I know how you must miss your
son."</p>

<p>"No. I vas in Paris for two veeks in Decembaire," said La
Marquise. "But it rain zere too," she said, with another shrug of
comic despair, and then added vigorously, "No! I do not get
lonely if it do not rain. But ven it rains--zen it is tereeble. .
. . Come," she said brusquely, almost curtly, turning away from
the grey prospect through the window, "let us seet here vere eet
ees varm." Still clasping her arms across her breast, she led
them towards a coal fire which was crackling cheerfully in a
hearth at one end of the great room; they seated themselves
comfortably around the fire, La Marquise rang a bell, and spoke a
few words to a butler, and presently he returned, bringing
glasses and a decanter of old sherry on a tray.</p>

<p>They sat talking amiably then of many things. La Marquise
questioned the boy about America, his stay in France, the places
he had seen, referred regretfully again to the absence of her son
and of the great friendship he cherished for America and
Americans as a result of his travels there with Marshal Foch. And
from time to time, the Countess, with a cunning that was
comically na&iuml;ve in its barefaced self-exposure, would prod
him with a skinny finger, and whisper hoarsely:</p>

<p>"Ask her some questions, my dear. You should ask her more
questions and write more in your little book. It will make a good
impression."</p>

<p>And although he saw from the glint of shrewd humour in the
sharp eyes of La Marquise that none of this clumsy by-play had
been lost on her, and that the other woman's design was perfectly
apparent to her, he responded dutifully, if awkwardly, asking
respectful questions about the age and history of the
ch&acirc;teau, the extent of its estate, and so on. At length,
emboldened by the modest success of these beginnings and feeling
that a clever young journalist should display an intelligent
curiosity about the current affairs of the nation to which he is
a visitor, he asked a question about the government of the
period, of which Herriot was the leader and which was dominantly
socialist.</p>

<p>It was, he saw, an unfortunate move; the Countess poked him
sharply with a warning finger, but it was too late. He saw
instantly that his question had produced a bad impression on La
Marquise: for the first time, her manner of amiable and cordial
friendliness vanished, her face hardened, there was an angry
glint in her shrewd eyes, and in a moment she said harshly, and
in a tone of arrogant impatience:</p>

<p>"I know nozzing about zose pipple! I pay no attention to
anys'ing zey say! Zey are fools! fools!" she cried violently.
"You must not believe anys'ing zey say! Zose men are traitors! .
. . Charlatans! . . . Zey are ze pipple who have ruined and
betrayed France!" In her agitation she got up and walked across
the room. "Here!" she cried, picking up a newspaper on a table
and returning with it. "Here is what you should reat if you want
ze trut!" She thrust a copy of <i>L'Action Fran&ccedil;aise</i>
into his hands. "Zat paper--and zat alone--will tell you ze trut
about ze way s'ings are in France today. Ah, monsieur!" she cried
earnestly, "you do not know--ze world does not know--no one
outside of France can know ze trut, because zese wretched men
control ze press--and make it print vatever lies zey tell it to.
But you reat <i>zis,</i> monsieur--you reat <i>zis,"</i> she
struck the paper with the back of her hand as she spoke, "and you
will get ze trut! Ah, zat man!" she said with a grim chuckle of
admiration. "Ze r&eacute;dacteur--ze--vat you say?--ze
<i>editor</i> of zat paper, L&eacute;on Daudet--ah, zat man is
<i>right!"</i> she said with a chuckle of satisfaction. "Zat man
is sometimes coarse--he call zem bat names--he is not always
tr&egrave;s gentil--but," again she chuckled grimly, "he iss
<i>right</i>! He tells ze trut--he calls zem vat zey are--ze
traitors and creemi<i>nals</i> who 'ave ruined France." She was
silent for a moment, and then in a voice harsh with passion, she
said violently: "La France, monsieur, is a royaume--a--vat you
call it?--a monarchy--a kinkdom. Ze French people must have a
kink--zey are lost vitout a kink--zey cannot govern zemselves
vitout a kink! . . . Zere can be no France, monsieur, vitout a
kink!" she almost shouted. "Zere has been no France since ze
monarchy vas destroyed by zese sc&eacute;l&eacute;rats who 'ave
betrayed La France--zere vill never be a France until ze kink is
restored to his rightful office and zese creeminals and traitors
'ave been sent to ze guillotine vere zey belonk. . . . So do not
ask me anys'ink about zese men, monsieur," she said with arrogant
passion. "I know nozzing about zem. I pay no attention to zem!
Zey are fools . . . traitors . . . creeminals," she shouted. "You
reat zat paper, you vill get ze trut."</p>

<p>She was breathing hoarsely and her eyes glinted with hard
fires of passion. At this moment, fortunately, the butler
entered, bowed, and, speaking in a quiet voice, informed his
mistress that luncheon was served. The words recalled the angry
woman to her duties as a hostess: with an almost comical
suddenness she assumed her former manner of gracious cordiality,
smiled amiably at her guests, and saying with benevolent
good-nature, "After our lonk journey and our so much talk, ve are
'ongry--yes?" led the way into the dining-room.</p>

<p>As they went in, the little old Countess nudged her young
companion again with a stealthy warning, and whispered with
nervous reproach:</p>

<p>"You should not have asked her that, my dear. Please do not
say anything more to her about the government."</p>

<p>The dining-room of the ch&acirc;teau was another magnificent
chamber, like everything else about the ch&acirc;teau, nobly
harmonious with those elements of strength and grace, splendour
and simplicity, warmth and delicacy, united with princely
dignity, which are the triumphs of this period of French
architecture. In spite of the chill air of the room--for it was
poorly heated--one felt its living and noble warmth
immediately.</p>

<p>The boy, who had looked forward to this meeting with
considerable awe and apprehension, now felt himself completely at
home, stirred by a profound, tranquil and lovely joy at the noble
beauty and simplicity of the ch&acirc;teau. Even in the sense of
retrenchment, the worn uniforms of the servants, the knowledge
that they served their mistress in various offices, there was
something pleasant, homely, and familiar; he discovered, to his
surprise, that he now felt none of the constraint and uneasiness
which he experienced when Joel Pierce had taken him to his great
estate upon the Hudson River and he had for the first time seen
the lives of the great American millionaires.</p>

<p>With La Marquise de Mornaye he was not conscious of that
exactly mannered style--most mannered in its very affectation of
simplicity--that vulgar arrogance which he had felt among the
rich Americans of Joel Pierce's class. La Marquise was plain as
an old shoe, vigorous and lusty as a peasant, and completely an
aristocrat--magnificently herself, without an ounce of
affectation--a woman Joel Pierce's people would have fawned upon
and to whom they would have given a king's ransom if by so doing
they could have bought for son or daughter an alliance with her
family.</p>

<p>La Marquise seated him beside her, the Countess opposite her,
and at once they began to eat. The food was magnificent, there
was a different wine of royal vintage (brought up from the famous
cellar of the ch&acirc;teau) with every course. La Marquise left
no doubt at all about the robust nature of her appetite, and by
everything she did and was--the plain shrewdness, warmth, and
sensible humanity of her nature--she made it plain that she
expected her guests to eat heartily also, and not to be too nice
and dainty about it either.</p>

<p>"Ven vun is younk as you are," she said, turning with a smile
to her young guest, "he is 'ongry often--non?" she inquired. She
put her soup-spoon to her mouth, swallowed some soup, and
smacking her lips with an air of relish, turned to the youth
again, and said plainly and positively:</p>

<p>"Eet ees good! Oui! I s'ink you will like it, too." Turning to
the Countess, who had tasted nothing, she said severely:</p>

<p>"Vy do you vait, my dear? Are you not 'ongry? You must
eat."</p>

<p>"Ah--hah--hah!" the Countess said with a little undecided
laugh, her eyes greedily fixed upon the smoking soup. "--You
know, my dear, I am on a diet by the doctor's orders--sang de
cheval, you know," she chattered in a distracted tone as her
greedy eyes went ravenously along the table--"I eat almost
nothing--really, my dear, I don't think I should." She snatched
up a piece of bread in one greedy little claw, broke it with an
appetizing crackle, and began to cram it into her mouth like a
starved animal--"Ah--hah--hah!" The poor starved old woman
laughed with almost hysterical delight, and tried to speak with a
mouth full of bread--"I know I shouldn't--but you always have
such delicious food, my dear." She lifted the soup-spoon, and
drew in with a long slobbering suction. "Ah, mon Dieu! mon Dieu!"
she gurgled rapturously--"quel potage!"</p>

<p>And so the meal progressed. With such a lusty trencher-woman
as La Marquise beside one, it was not hard to follow suit; they
polished off the soup, which was a delicious, savoury,
peasant-like brew, in record time, and, as if their hunger
mounted from the delicious food it fed on, they turned then to
the chicken. The chicken, which was almost all fat and juicy
breast, was so young, crisp, tender, plump and succulent that it
seemed almost to melt in the mouth, the boy took two or three
rhapsodic swallows and the chicken was gone, at which La
Marquise, lifting her voice over his feeble and half-hearted
protests, said to the butler: "Encore du poulet pour
Monsieur."</p>

<p>A second chicken, even plumper, crisper and more tender than
the first, was instantly provided, after which the roast and
vegetables were served. He had never tasted better food in his
life--everything, haricots, peas, beef, seemed to melt like an
ambrosial ether the moment that he put it in his mouth; there was
a new wine with every course, each wine rarer, older, richer and
more delicious than the last, the butler kept filling up their
glasses, and he kept drinking the grand wine until heart, mind,
and soul, and every conduit of his life seemed infused by its
glorious warmth and fragrance. They talked little as they ate:
for some time there were no sounds except the crisp crackle of
the bread, the ring of heavy silver, the sound of wine gulped
down, the delicate chime of glasses, and the low, quiet orders of
the butler speaking to his helper, as swiftly, expertly, and
noiselessly they moved round the table, seeming to be there at
one's elbow and to read the gastronomic hopes and wishes of each
guest before he had time to open his mouth and utter them.</p>

<p>La Marquise ate with robust concentration, putting down her
knife from time to time to pick up her wine-glass and take a
generous swallow, after which she would put the glass down and
wipe a napkin deliberately across her mouth and pause, for a
moment, breathing a little heavily, with an air of hearty
satisfaction.</p>

<p>As for the Countess, she ate like a famished wolf: where the
movements of La Marquise were hearty and deliberate, those of the
Countess were almost frantically swift and eager. Her sharp and
greedy little eyes glittered with an almost delirious joy, she
would seize a glass of wine and drain it in one greedy gulp; at
times she was so excited by the variety and abundance of the
dishes that she seemed unable to decide what to reach for next.
She reached out greedily in all directions, her eyes darting
avaricious glances to and fro; chicken, meat, vegetables, salad,
wine disappeared as if by magic, and were replenished, and all
the time the poor old woman chuckled craftily to herself and
muttered to herself in broken monologue:</p>

<p>"Ah--hah--hah!"--crunch, crunch, crunch! And away went the
chicken. "Mon Dieu!--but it's good!--Ah--hah--hah!" gulp, gulp,
gulp! down would go the wine. "Mon Dieu! mon Dieu! Such food!
Such wine!--Mais oui! Mais oui! . . . Un peu encore, s'il vous
pla&icirc;t! Quel b&oelig;uf! Quel b&oelig;uf!"</p>

<p>At which La Marquise would put down her glass, wipe her mouth,
look across the table at the Countess, and say:</p>

<p>"'Ow you like, eh? Good? Mais oui! Il faut manger," she said
coarsely, and applied herself again to knife and fork.</p>

<p>By the time they got down to the cheese--which was a ripe,
delicious Brie--La Marquise de Mornaye was at last fortified for
conversation. Putting down her empty wine-glass with a deliberate
movement, she straightened in her chair, wiped her mouth, sat
upright for a moment in an attitude of solid satisfaction, and
then, turning to her American guest, said:</p>

<p>"Do you know Patter<i>son</i> T. Jones--eh? 'E is an
officer--a vat you call it?--a major in ze Am&eacute;ricain
army." She pronounced these words with an air of na&iuml;ve
confidence, as if Patterson T. Jones must be a name instantly
familiar to every American. When the boy told her, however, that
he did not know Major Patterson T. Jones and confessed, further,
that he had never heard of him, La Marquise looked slightly
astonished and disappointed; and in a moment, her shrewd eyes
narrowing slightly as she spoke, she said rather grimly:</p>

<p>"I should like verree verree motch to see zat gentleman again.
I should like verree verree motch to know vere he now iss. . . .
Attendez!" she said sharply, as inspiration struck her. "Perhaps
if I show you this--vat you say?--his photographie--you will know
ze man. . . . Guillaume!" she raised her voice a little in
command. "Apportez-moi les photographies des officiers
am&eacute;ricains."</p>

<p>"Oui, madame," the butler answered, and went swiftly and
silently out of the room.</p>

<p>"Yes," La Marquise continued with an air of grim meditation,
"I should verree verree motch like to know vere Major
Patter<i>son</i> T. Jones iss to be found."</p>

<p>The butler returned with several large square photographs,
bowed, and gave them to his mistress.</p>

<p>"'Ere, you see," she said, taking one of them and pointing
with her finger, "zis vas taken here--in zis verree room at a
great ban<i>quet</i> vitch I have made for ze Am&eacute;ricains
in 1918. Zis," she said proudly, and pointing with a plump white
finger--"zis is me--c'est moi, La Marquise!" she cried in a jolly
tone, and laughed with satisfaction as she pointed to her own
beaming likeness at the head of a long table, sumptuously adorned
with fine silver, china, linen, and a forest thicket of dark,
crusty-looking bottles of old wine--obviously the relics of a
memorable feast. "And zis," La Marquise said more grimly,
pointing again with her plump white finger, "zis is Major
Patter<i>son</i> T. Jones--You know him, eh?" she said.</p>

<p>The boy looked at the picture for a moment and then handed it
back to La Marquise, telling her that he did not recognize the
face of Patterson T. Jones.</p>

<p><i>"</i>Patter<i>son</i> T. Jones," La Marquise answered,
slowly, and with an air of grim deliberation, "is a gentleman I
vant verree verree motch to see. Zat is ze man," she said, "who
took my picture--who told me he vould get for me, oh! soch huge
soms of mon-nee if he could teck my picture to America," she
laughed ironically--"and so I let him teck ze picture, and I have
heard nozzing from him since."</p>

<p>"Was--was it your own picture, Marquise? A portrait of
yourself?"</p>

<p>"Mais non, mon ami," she said impatiently. "Dat's vat I tell
you--eet vas a picture, a photographie of Le Mar&eacute;chal.
Zere was only seex sotch pictures of Le Mar&eacute;chal in
existence--I say to Madame Foch vun time ven I am at Paris--I see
ze picture in her house--I say--'Oh, my dear, zat so lovely
picture of Le Mar&eacute;chal--I must have vun for myself,' I
say. 'Ah,' she say, 'I do not know, Mathilde--he do not like to
give away zese pictures--I have only t'ree,' she say, 'but vait.
I see vat I can do--' Zen, vun night I go to dinnaire at zere
house. 'Mathilde,' he say, 'for vat you vant my picture? I give
it to you,' he say, 'and zen all ze ozzer girls vill vant vun,
too. I meck my vife jalouse, and zen zere is no peace. I have
enough of var,' he say. 'I am too old to start anozzer vit my
vife!" 'You give to me zat picture,' I say. 'I am no young leddy
in ze chorus,' I say, 'to meck your vife jalouse. She vant you to
give it to me, too.' 'Bon,' he say. 'Here it is, zen.' . . . And
he give to me ze so beautiful photographie vit his name below
written out to me: 'To Mathilde, old comrade, fet'ful friend'--I
bring ze picture beck ven I come beck to Mornaye," La Marquise
continued, "and Major Parter<i>son</i> T. Jones he see it ven he
iss here. 'How motch you vant for zat picture of Le
Mar&eacute;chal?' he say. 'Oh,' I say, 'I cannot say. Already I
have an offer of ten s'ousand francs,' I say, 'but I vould not
sell it because ze Mar&eacute;chal himself, he give to me.'
'Vell,' say Major Patter<i>son</i> T. Jones, 'you lett me teck
zat picture vit me ven I go beck to America, and I sell it for
you.' 'How motch you get for me, eh?" I ask him. 'Oh,' he say, 'I
get twent' s'ousand francs for you--mebbe more.' 'You sure?' I
say. 'Mais oui!' say Major Patter<i>son</i> T. Jones.
'Absolument'--'All right,' I say. 'I give to you. If you get
twenty s'ousand francs I give you five,' I say. And so he teck my
picture and he go avay, and since den," La Marquise bitterly
concluded, "I nevaire hear from him."</p>

<p>"Ah!" the Countess cried indignantly. "Le
sc&eacute;l&eacute;rat!"</p>

<p>"Mais oui!" the other woman now said passionately. "It is
inf&acirc;me! Zis man have my picture, I have nozzing--Ze lest
time Madame Foch is here, she look around, she say, 'But vere, my
dear,--vere iss ze picture zat Le Mar&eacute;chal give you? I do
not see it,' she say. What can I do?" La Marquise went on in a
despairing tone. "I cannot say to her, 'I lose it!' I cannot say
to her, 'I give it avay to an Am&eacute;ricain who sell it for
me.' I don't know vat to say. All I can say is, 'I leave it, my
dear, in Paris vit my son Paul ven I vas zere. He have it, but ze
next time zat he come to Mornaye he vill bring it.' But ven she
come again, vat story can I tell her zen?" La Marquise demanded.
"Ah! Zat sc&eacute;l&eacute;rat! Zat Patter<i>son</i> T. Jones!
If ever I get my fingers on zat gentleman I s'ink he vill
remember me!" she said, with a glint in her eye and a grim note
in her voice that left no doubt of her intention--"But is it not
inf&acirc;me, monsieur," she said with a virtuous indignation
that was now ludicrous after her na&iuml;ve exposure of her own
avarice and greed--"is it not inf&acirc;me zat somevun teck avay
a picture zat a friend give to you--and promise you motch monnee
for it--and zen to hear from him no more? Sc&eacute;l&eacute;rat!
T'ief!" she muttered. "I like to get my hands on him!--But now,
monsieur," she said, turning to him abruptly, with a smile of
winning ingratiation, "I meck a leetle speech to you. You are--la
Comtesse tells me--a younk journalist--eh?"</p>

<p>"Well, Marquise," he flushed, and began to blunder out an
explanation--"I can't exactly say--"</p>

<p>"Mais oui!" the Countess swiftly interposed. "He has written
many clever articles--pour les grands journaux am&eacute;ricains,
n'est-ce pas--la t&ecirc;te, vous voyez?" she whispered craftily,
bending over the table and nodding towards him as she
spoke--"C'est tr&egrave;s intelligent, n'est-ce pas?"</p>

<p>"Et pour <i>Le Times?"</i> La Marquise demanded. "Il
&eacute;crit tout &ccedil;a pour <i>Le New York Times?"</i></p>

<p>"Mais oui," the Countess said glibly, before he could object.
"Il est d&eacute;j&agrave; bien connu. Moi, j'ai lu beaucoup de
choses de sa main--"</p>

<p>"Now, look here," he began, glaring angrily across the table
at the lying old woman. "You have no right--"</p>

<p>"Ah, oui!" La Marquise broke in, with a vigorous nod of
satisfaction, after a brief inspection of him. "C'est tr&egrave;s
&eacute;vident! Il est intelligent! Bon!" she said decisively,
and turned to him with the air of a person whose mind is made up
and whose course of action determined--"Now, monsieur," she said,
"I tell you vat I have in mind. I have beeg 'ospital--non?" she
said, smiling a little at his puzzled look. "I am--vat you call
it?--le pr&eacute;si<i>dent</i>--le directeur, n'est-ce pas?--of
beeg 'ospital in de Nort'--ve have zere ze soldats, n'est-ce
pas--ze oh so many bless&eacute;s--les pauvres!" she said in a
tone of pity--"les mutil&eacute;s de la guerre. . . . Ve have old
building--eet ees no good, eet ees not beeg enough--not
<i>moderne</i>--and so," she added simply, "ve build
anozzer--beeg, moderne--and"--the conclusion of the matter--"ve
need monnee." She was silent for a moment, beaming hopefully at
him. "Monsieur," she said presently, in an ingratiating tone, and
with an air of na&iuml;ve confidence that was astounding--"I
s'ink ven I tell you vat ve need--'ow much monnee," her voice
sank craftily, "you vill get for us--eh?"</p>

<p>He stared at her for a moment with a bewildered face, unable
to reply.</p>

<p>"But how," he stammered at length--"how do you think--what do
you think I can do?" he said bluntly.</p>

<p>"Ah!" La Marquise cried triumphantly. "C'est facile!" Again
her voice became low, confiding, crafty. "You are a
journalist--eh? You write for ze grand journal
am&eacute;ricain--ze <i>New York Times</i>--yes? . . . Vell, I
tell you vat to say," she went on placidly. "You write ze article
for ze <i>Times</i>--you spick of zis beeg 'ospi<i>tal</i>--you
tell of ze grand vork of restauration--you tell of ze poor
soldats--les bless&eacute;s--les mutil&eacute;s--you say La
France have nozzing--zey have no monnee--ze poor pipples 'ave
lose everys'ink--you say, ve 'ave so motch--ze rich
Am&eacute;ricains--ve must not let zis great vork die--ve must
help ze poor soldats--ve must give ze monnee for ze 'ospital. . .
. You see--I show you," she cried with a confident chuckle--"if
you like I write eet out myself--and zen all you have to do is
meck--vat do you say?--la traduction."</p>

<p>"How--how much do you want?"</p>

<p>"Un million de francs," she said, dismissing this bagatelle
airily. "--For ze Am&eacute;ricains vat ees dat? Pouf! Nozzing!
Mais pour les Fran&ccedil;ais--ah!" she said sadly, "for ze
French eet ees too motch. Un millionaire am&eacute;ricain--he see
your story--he say, 'Ve cannot let zis grand vork die'--he write
vun cheque out for ze whole amount--and zen," her smile of
satisfaction deepened, "he send to me, eh?--He meck out cheque to
Marquise--he never miss eet--and he send to me." For a moment she
was silent, smiling triumphantly at him. When she spoke again,
she bent towards him, her voice became low, confiding, craftily
conspiratorial--"And I tell you vat I do. . . . You write ze
piece and get for me ze monnee . . . and I give you a
fourt'--twanty-five per cent--non?"</p>

<p>In a moment, as he continued to stare at her with an
expression of gape-mouthed astonishment, she straightened, with
an air of satisfied finality, nodded her head, and then said with
businesslike decision:</p>

<p>"Bon. Eet ees settled zen." She rose decisively from the
table, and her guests followed her--"You come vit me," she said,
as she led the way out of the dining-room, "and I give you--vat
you say?--ze fects."</p>

<p>She was already gone, before he could blurt out a few words of
bewildered protest; the Countess was at his side, prodding him
sharply with a skinny finger and muttering in a tone of
reproachful entreaty:</p>

<p>"Go on, my dear! Go on! And you should ask more questions!
Don't sit there saying nothing. It will make a good impression.
And use your little book more often," the Countess whispered
cunningly. "You should write more in it when she speaks to
you."</p>

<p>"Now you see here," he burst out furiously, "I'm not going to
write down anything. I'm tired of this foolishness--I'm not going
to be a party any longer to your damned schemes or for this
woman's either. I'm going to tell her once and for all that I'll
write no article--not for <i>The Times</i> nor any place
else!"</p>

<p>"Oh, my boy," the old woman whispered imploringly. "You
wouldn't do that! Please don't say a thing like that, I beg of
you! . . . Think what it means to me," she whispered--"I am so
poor, so miserable--for years I have waited for an opportunity to
see this woman--it means so much to me, so little to you. Please
be polite, my dear--it's only for a little time. You'll be going
soon. What can it matter to you? She has her schemes like
everybody else . . . keep silent if you feel you must, but be
polite to her, for God's sake; pretend to listen--don't ruin
everything for me now."</p>

<p>"All right," he muttered grimly. "I'll listen, but I'm damned
if I'll write anything down in the little book."</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>When they returned to the salon La Marquise had provided
herself with various letters, folders, and descriptive circulars
about the institution for which she was now soliciting aid. They
seated themselves around the fire again, with coffee and
liqueurs; by the time La Marquise had finished the description of
her hospital project, the grey light of the brief wintry
afternoon was fading rapidly, and the time for their departure
had approached.</p>

<p>Before they left she took them on a brief tour of inspection
of the ch&acirc;teau, showing them the portraits of her
ancestors, the great room with the huge, gold-canopied bed where
King Henri IV had slept, on one of his visits to the
ch&acirc;teau--unoccupied since, now closed save for museum
visits such as this.</p>

<p>Their last visit, before departure, was to the library: it was
a pleasant, warm-looking room adjacent to the grand salon, and
had the appearance of being seldom used. La Marquise smiled at
the eager curiosity with which the young man looked over the
storeyed rows of books, the costly elegance and rich colour of
their bindings.</p>

<p>"You like to reat, eh?"</p>

<p>He told her that he did. She smiled, and said
indifferently:</p>

<p>"I do not like so motch. It bore me ven I reat so long."</p>

<p>He asked her a few questions about some of the modern French
writers--Proust, Gide, Romains, and Cocteau, among others, for a
moment her face was hardened by the arrogant look it had worn
when he had asked her about the government, and she said rather
impatiently:</p>

<p>"I know nozzing about zose pipple. Yes, I have heard of some
of zem. But I never reat zem. Zere is no good writing in France
any more. Ze latest s'ing I have here,"--she nodded towards the
shelves of books--"is Paul Bourget. But I never reat him,
eizer."</p>

<p>In a few moments they had said farewell and were being driven
away from the ch&acirc;teau. Rain had begun to fall again, the
dull, grey light was almost gone and, since there was no
convenient train, La Marquise had instructed her driver to take
them back to Blois in the car.</p>

<p>During the ride back to town he spoke seldom to the Countess.
And she, as if recognizing the impatience, weariness and dislike
he had come to feel towards her, the approaching end of their
brief and curious relationship, was silent, too. When they got
back to the hotel he told her rather curtly he was tired and was
going to his room to wash and take a brief rest before
dinner.</p>

<p>"But yes, my dear," she said instantly. "Of course you should.
I can see that you are tired. Perhaps," she added quietly, "I
shall see you again when you come down."</p>

<p>"Of course you will," he said shortly, almost angrily, in a
tone that showed the irritable exasperation which too long
association with the woman had now caused him to feel.</p>

<p>"Good-bye my dear. Get some rest now. You need it."</p>

<p>When he got to his room he took off his coat and shoes, lay
down on his bed, and instantly fell asleep. When he awoke he
discovered he had slept almost three hours, that it was eight
o'clock. Already late for dinner, washing and dressing hastily,
he went downstairs to find no one but the proprietor's wife in
the bureau. Even before he could ask her where the Countess was,
the woman had smilingly informed him that the old woman had gone,
had already taken a train back to Orl&eacute;ans.</p>

<p>"Mais elle vous a remis de tr&egrave;s affectueux adieux," the
woman said with a smile. "Elle vous a fait des grands
compliments."</p>

<p>And for a moment, when he realized that she was gone, he was
conscious of a strange, mixed feeling of pity, loss and regret.
He remembered suddenly the curt exasperation of his parting and
something lonely, sad, and silent in the eyes of the old woman as
she had said good-bye. The old loneliness had closed in around
him again, he felt the sense of loss and sorrow that one feels
when someone he has known a long time has gone.</p>

<p>Play us a tune on an unbroken spinet, and let the bells ring,
let the bells ring! Play music now: play us a tune on an unbroken
spinet. Do not make echoes of forgotten tune, do not strike music
from old broken keys, do not make ghosts with faded tinklings on
the yellowed board; but play us a tune on an unbroken spinet,
play lively music when the instrument was new, let us see Mozart
playing in the parlour, and let us hear the sound of the ladies'
voices. But more than that; waken the turmoil of forgotten
streets, let us hear their sounds again unmuted, and unchanged by
time, throw the light of Wednesday morning on the Third Crusade,
and let us see Athens on an average day. Let us hear the sound of
the voices of the Greeks, and observe closely if they were all
wise and beautiful at ten o'clock in the morning; let us see if
their limbs were all perfect, and their gestures grave and
stately, also let us smell their food and observe them eating,
and hear, if only once, the sound of a wheel in a street, the
texture of just four forgotten moments.</p>

<p>Give us the sounds of Egypt on a certain day; let us hear the
voice of King Menkaura and some of the words of the Lady Sennuwy;
also the voices of the cotton-farmers. Let us hear the vast and
casual sound of life, in these old peoples: their greetings in
the street, the voices of the housewives and the merchants. And
let us hear the laughter of a woman in the sixteenth century.</p>

<p>The cry of the wolf would always be the same; the sound of the
wheel will always be the same; and the hoof of the horse on the
roads of every time will be the same. But play us a tune on an
unbroken spinet; and let us hear the voices of the knights at
dinner. The cry of a man to his dog, and the barking of the dog;
the call of the plough-driver to his horse, and the sound of the
horse; the noise of the hunt, and the sound of the flowing water,
will always be the same.</p>

<p>By the waters of life, by time, by time, play us a tune on an
unbroken spinet, and let us hear the actual voices of old fairs;
let us move backward through our memories, and through the memory
of the race, let us relive the million forgotten moments of our
lives, and let us see poor people sitting in their rooms in 1597,
and let us see the rich man standing with his back before the
fire, in the Middle Ages, and his wife knitting by the table, and
let us hear their casual words.</p>

<p>Let us see the men who built the houses of Old Frankfort; let
us see how they worked, and let us see them sitting on hewn
timbers when they ate their lunches; let us hear their words, the
sound of their voices. Unwind the fabric of lost time out of our
entrails, repair the million little threads of actual
circumstance until the seconds grow grey, bright and dusty with
the living light, and we see the plain unfabled faces of the
people; let us awake, and hear the people in the streets, and see
Tobias Smollett pass our window.</p>

<p>Then, play us a tune on the unbroken spinet, let time be as
the road to London and we a traveller on it; and let us enter
London and find out what year it is there in the Mile End Road;
let it be dark, and let us enter London in the dark, and hear
men's voices, and let us see if we could understand them; and let
us then find out what year it is, a lodging for the night, and
see if they read mystery on us, or would fly away from us.</p>

<p>But there are times that are stranger yet, there are times
that are stranger than the young knights and the horses, and the
sounds of the eating taverns. The far time is the time of
yesterday: it is the time of early America, it is the voices of
the people on Broadway in 1841, it is the sounds of the streets
in Des Moines in 1887, it is the engines of the early trains at
Baltimore in 1853, it is the faces and voices of the early
American people, who are lapped up in the wilderness, who are hid
from us, whose faces are in mystery, whose lives are more dark
and strange than the lives of the Saxon thanes.</p>

<p>The time that is lovely is the time of the fatness and of the
bright colours; it is the elfin time of the calendars, and the
sad and mysterious time of the early photographs. It is the time
of the early lithographs, it is the time when the word was green
and red and yellow. It is the time of the red barn and the
windmill, and the house of the seven thousand gables; it is the
time of the green lawn and the blue sky and the white
excursion-steamer in the river, and the flags, the streamers, and
gay brown-and-white buntings, the brass bands and the tumult of
all the people who cry out Hurray, hurray!</p>

<p>It is the time of the boy rolling his hoop down the pink path,
and of Mama in a bonnet and with a muff, and a stuck-out bottom,
and Papa with a derby; it is the time of peace and plenty and the
fair stripes of colour, and the iron stag. It is the time of the
lightning-rod salesman and the summer boarder, it is the time of
Farmer Hayseed and of Dusty Rhodes the tramp, it is the time when
boys started on the downward path through cigarettes; it is a
lovely time. It is the time of the lures and snares of the wicked
city and of the Great White Way; it is the time of pitfalls that
await the innocent country girl with a whaleboned collar and a
small waist; it is the time of Palaces of Sin or the Devil on
Sunday; it is the time of the Tenderloin, of the nests of vice;
it is the time of the gilded resorts with mirrors and soft
carpets, where the mechanical piano played and you bought
champagne, and of the High Class places and the Madam who would
not stand for any ungentlemanly behaviour, the time of the girls
who wore evening dresses and were Perfect Ladies.</p>

<p>It is the time of the opera and theatre parties, and the Horse
Show, and of late jolly suppers in the walnut dining-rooms; it is
the time of elegant ladies with long gloves on naked arms, and
Welsh rarebit in the chafing-dish; it is the time of the Four
Hundred, and the great names of the millionaires--the
Vanderbilts, the Astors, and the Goulds--it is the time of the
powdered flunkeys and the twenty-dollar favours; it is the time
of Newport, and the canopied red-carpeted sidewalks, and the
great mansions on Fifth Avenue, and the splendid gilt and plush
marble halls, and the time of the fortune-hunting foreign
noblemen (London papers please copy).</p>

<p>It is the time of the effeminate fop, and the lisping ass (Oh,
Percy! I'll slap you on your wrist, you rough, rude thing, you!);
it is the time of the Damned Dude who wears English clothes and
has cuffs on his trousers (Hey, mister! Is it raining in
London?), and he never did anything in his life but spend his old
man's money, he never did an honest lick of work in his life,
he's not worth powder enough to kill him, and if the son of a
bitch comes fooling around any sister of mine I'll beat the
everlasting tar out of him.</p>

<p>When the songs that they sang were old and sweet, when the
songs that they sang were like beauty's from afar, and when
people sitting on their porches in the dusk could hear (O sweet
and low!) the corner quartette sing, "Sweet Adeline"; when the
songs that they sang were "Daisy, Daisy, Give Me Your Answer
True."</p>

<p>It is the time of the wharves and the tangled shipping, the
horse-cars by the docks, of piled-up casks and kegs of rum and
molasses. There are forgotten fume-flaws of bright smoke above
Manhattan; where are the lost faces that came towards us over
Brooklyn bridge, where are the parted ripples and the proud
forgotten ships?</p>

<p>By the waters of life, before we knew that we must die, before
we had seen our father's face, before we had sought the print of
his foot: by the waters of time (the tide! the tide!), before we
had seen the shadows in the haunted woods, before lost moments
lived again, before the shades were fleshed. Who are we, that
must follow in the footsteps of the king? Who are we, that had no
kings to follow? We are the unkinged men. Have we left shadows on
forgotten walls? Have we crossed running water and lived for
seven timeless years with the enchantress, and shall we find our
son who is ourself, and will he know us?</p>

<p>Shall your voices unlock the gates of my brain? Shall I know
you, though I have never seen your face? Will you know me, and
will you call me "son"? Father, I know that you live, though I
have never found you.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>In the old town of Tours he quickly found lodging in an
ancient hotel or tavern--really a congeries of old, whited
buildings with separate doors, looking out on a cobbled courtyard
through whose gate, in former times perhaps, the horses and
post-chaise of weary travellers had often clattered. In a cold,
little room in one of the buildings facing on the court, he now
settled down, and there began for him one of the most
extraordinary and phantasmal time-experiences of his life. Day
passed into night, night merged into day again like the unbroken
weaving of a magic web, and he stayed on, week after week,
plunged in a strange and legendary spell of time that seemed
suspended and detached from the world of measurable event, fixed
in unmoving moment, unsilent silence, changeless change.</p>

<p>Later, it seemed to him that that strange reverie and dream of
time, in which his life was now so strangely fixed, had been
induced by a series of causes, easy to understand in the light of
experience, and almost logical in their consequence. It was five
months since he had left America. After the overwhelming impact
of impression and event which a new world, a new life, had
brought to him in so many varied, chance, and unexpected
ways--after the ship, the voyage, the enormous isolation, the
whole earth-detachment of the sea (itself a life, a world, a
universe of new experience), after the weeks in England, the huge
web of London, the brief but poignantly illuminating days in
Bristol, Bath, and Devonshire, with fleeting glimpses of
something so strange, yet so familiar, so near, yet never to be
touched, that it seemed to him he was looking in through a
lighted window at a life which he had always known, but which he
could never make his own; after the terrific impact of France and
Paris--the month of bewildered, desperate and almost
terror-stricken isolation in a new and hostile world--an atom,
wordless, tongueless, almost drowned among the strange, dark
faces of the Frenchmen; after all the confusion, grief, and error
of that month--the night-time kaleidoscope of caf&eacute;s,
brothels, alcohol, and women, the frenzied day-time prowling
through museums, bookstalls, thronging streets--the thousand
monuments of an alien culture, the million faces of an alien
race, until every atom of him was wrung, trembling, maddened and
exhausted, sick with loss and hopelessness, weary with
despair--after the huge first shock and flood-tide of immersion
in an alien life--had come his meeting with Starwick, Elinor, and
Ann, the brief, fatal, furious weeks of their relation, the
bitter loss and waste and rankling pain of parting; and finally
the sweltering and incurable ache, the blind and driven
aimlessness of wandering, the chance encounter with the Countess,
and the brief interlude of forgetfulness and oblivion that had
come to him while he was with her--and now, blank, silent
loneliness again, the blind fortuity of chance, the arbitrary
halt and desperate entrenchment of his spirit in this town of
Tours.</p>

<p>Now, after the savage kaleidoscope of these months of hope and
grief and ecstasy, of desolation and despair, of passion, love,
and suffering, of maddened hunger and infuriate desire, after all
the restless and insatiable seeking of his goaded, driven, and
unresting soul, he had come at last to a place of quietness and
pause; and suddenly he was like a desperate and bewildered man
who has come in from the furious street of life to seek sanctuary
and repose in the numb stillness of a tomb.</p>

<p>Day and night now, from dawn to dark, from sleeping until
waking, in that strange spell of time and silence that was
neither dream nor sleep nor waking vision, but that like an
enchantment was miraculously composed of all, obsessed as a man
exiled, banished, or condemned by fate to live upon a desert
island without possibility of escape or return--he thought of
home.</p>

<p>In that enchanted spell of time and silence, as men who gaze
in visions across misty and illimitable seas, with the terrible
homelessness of a man for whom there can never be return, with
the terrible homelessness of a man who longs for home and has no
home--with the impossible, hopeless, incurable and unutterable
homesickness of the American, who is maddened by a longing for
return, and does not know to what he can return, whose brain
burns night and day with the maddened hope, whose heart aches
night and day with the smothering and incurable ache of the
houseless, homeless, and forsaken atom of the earth who has no
goal or ending for his hunger, no final dwelling-place for his
desire--he thought of home.</p>

<p>What was it? It was the furious desire, unceasing, unassuaged,
of wandering and forsaken man--the lost American--who longs for
ever for return--and who has no door to enter, no room to dwell
in, no single hand's-breadth of certain, consecrated earth upon
that continent of wild houseless space to which he can
return.</p>

<p>An astounding--an almost incredible thing--now happened. He
had come to Tours telling himself that now at last, at last, he
was going "to settle down and write," that he was going to
justify his voyage by the high purpose of creation. In his mind
there swarmed various projects, cloudy, vague, and grandiose in
their conception, of plays, books, stories, essays he must write:
with desperate resolve he sat down grimly now to shape these
grand designs into the stern and toilsome masonry of words. A few
impatient, fragmentary beginnings, the opening pages of a story,
the beginning speeches of a play--all crumpled in a wad and
impatiently tossed aside--were the final results of this
ambitious purpose.</p>

<p>And yet, write he did. Useless, fragmentary, and inchoate as
were these first abortive efforts, he began to write now like a
madman--as only a madman could write--driven by an insanity of
sense and soul and feeling which he no longer could master or
control, tranced in a hypnosis by whose fatal and insatiate
compulsions he was forced, without will, to act. Gripped by that
ungovernable desire, all ordered plans, designs, coherent
projects for the work he had set out to do went by the board,
were burned up in the flame of a quenchless passion, like a
handful of dry straw. Seated at a table in his cold, little room
that overlooked the old cobbled court of the hotel, he wrote
ceaselessly from dawn to dark, sometimes from darkness on to dawn
again--hurling himself upon the bed to dream, in a state of
comatose awareness, strange sleeping-wakeful visions, dreams mad
and terrible as the blinding imagery that now swept constantly
across his brain its blaze of fire.</p>

<p>The words were wrung out of him in a kind of bloody sweat,
they poured out of his finger-tips, spat out of his snarling
throat like writhing snakes; he wrote them with his heart, his
brain, his sweat, his body; he wrote them with his blood, his
spirit; they were wrenched out of the last secret source and
substance of his life.</p>

<p>And in those words was packed the whole image of his bitter
homelessness, his intolerable desire, his maddened longing for
return. In those wild and broken phrases was packed the whole
bitter burden of his famished, driven, over-laden spirit--all the
longing of the wanderer, all the impossible and unutterable
homesickness that the American, or any man on earth, can
know.</p>

<p>They were all there--without coherence, scheme, or
reason--flung down upon paper like figures blasted by the
spirit's lightning stroke, and in them was the huge chronicle of
the billion forms, the million names, the huge, single, and
incomparable substance of America.</p>

<h1>XCVII</h1>

<p> </p>

<p>At morning, in a foreign land, whether upon the mournful
plains of Hungary or in some quiet square of Georgian houses,
embedded in the immensity of sleeping London, he awakes and
thinks of home; or in some small provincial town of France, he
starts up from his sleep at night, he starts up in the living,
brooding stillness of the night, for suddenly he thinks that he
has heard there the sounds of America and the wilderness, the
things that are in his blood, his heart, his brain, in every atom
of his flesh and tissue, the things for which he draws his breath
in labour, the things that madden him with an intolerable and
nameless pain.</p>

<p>And what are they? They are the whistle-wail of one of the
great American engines as it thunders through the continent at
night, the sound of the voices of the city streets--those hard,
loud, slangy voices, full of violence, humour, and recklessness,
now stronger and more remote than the sounds of Asia--the sounds
that come up from the harbour of Manhattan in the night--that
magnificent and thrilling music of escape, mystery, and joy, with
the mighty orchestration of the transatlantics, the hoarse little
tugs, the ferry boats and lighters, those sounds that well up
from the gulf and dark immensity of night and that pierce the
entrails of the listener.</p>

<p>For this will always be one of the immortal and living things
about the land, this will be an eternal and unchanging fact about
that city whose only permanence is change: there will always be
the great rivers flowing around it in the darkness, the rivers
that have bounded so many nameless lives, those rivers which have
moated in so many changes, which have girdled the wilderness and
so much hard, brilliant, and sensational living, so much pain,
beauty, ugliness, so much lust, murder, corruption, love, and
wild exultancy.</p>

<p>They'll build great engines yet, and grander towers, but
always the rivers run, in the day, in the night, in the dark,
draining immensely their imperial tides out of the wilderness,
washing and flowing by the coasts of the fabulous city, by all
the little ticking sounds of time, by all the million lives and
deaths of the city. Always the rivers run, and always there will
be great ships upon the tide, always great horns are baying at
the harbour's mouth, and in the night a thousand men have died
while the river, always the river, the dark eternal river, full
of strange secret time, washing the city's stains away, thickened
and darkened by its dumpings, is flowing by us, by us to the
sea.</p>

<p>He awakes at morning in a foreign land and he thinks of home.
He cannot rest, his heart is wild with pain and loneliness, he
sleeps, but then he knows he sleeps, he hears the dark and secret
spell of time about him; in ancient towns, thick tumbling chimes
of the cathedral bells are thronging through the dark, but
through the passages of his diseased and unforgetful sleep the
sounds and memory of America make way: now it is almost dawn, a
horse has turned into a street and in America there is the sound
of wheels, the lonely clop-clop of the hooves upon deserted
pavements, silence, then the banging clatter of a can.</p>

<p>He awakes at morning in a foreign land, he draws his breath in
labour in the wool-soft air of Europe: the wool-grey air is all
about him like a living substance; it is in his heart, his
stomach, and his entrails; it is in the slow and vital movements
of the people; it soaks down from the sodden skies into the
earth, into the heavy buildings, into the limbs and hearts and
brains of living men. It soaks into the spirit of the wanderer;
his heart is dull with the grey weariness of despair, it aches
with hunger for the wilderness, the howling of great winds, the
bite and sparkle of the clear, cold air, the buzz, the tumult and
the wild exultancy. The wet, woollen air is all about him, and
there is no hope. It was there before William the Conqueror; it
was there before Clovis and Charles "the Hammer"; it was there
before Attila; it was there before Hengist and Horsa; it was
there before Vercingetorix and Julius Agricola.</p>

<p>It was there now; it will always be there. They had it in
Merry England and they had it in Gay Paree; and they were seldom
merry, and they were rarely gay. The wet, woollen air is over
Munich; it is over Paris; it is over Rouen and Madame Bovary; it
soaks into England; it gets into boiled mutton and the Brussels
sprouts; it gets into Hammersmith on Sunday; it broods over
Bloomsbury and the private hotels and the British Museum; it
soaks into the land of Europe and keeps the grass green. It has
always been there; it will always be there. His eyes are mad and
dull; he cannot sleep without the hauntings of phantasmal memory
behind the eyes; his brain is overstretched and weary, it gropes
ceaselessly around the prison of the skull, it will not
cease.</p>

<p>The years are walking in his brain, his father's voice is
sounding in his ears, and in the pulses of his blood the
tom-tom's beat. His living dust is stored with memory: two
hundred million men are walking in his bones; he hears the
howling of the wind around forgotten eaves; he cannot sleep. He
walks in midnight corridors; he sees the wilderness, the
moon-drenched forests; he comes to clearings in the moonlit
stubble, he is lost, he has never been here, yet he is at home.
His sleep is haunted with the dreams of time; wires throb above
him in the whiteness, they make a humming in the noonday
heat.</p>

<p>The rails are laid across eight hundred miles of golden wheat,
the rails are wound through mountains, they curve through
clay-yellow cuts, they enter tunnels, they are built up across
the marshes, they hug the cliff and follow by the river's bank,
they cross the plains with dust and thunder, and they leap
through flatness and the dull scrub-pine to meet the sea.</p>

<p>Then he awakes at morning in a foreign land and thinks of
home.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>For we have awaked at morning in a foreign land and heard the
bitter curse of their indictment, and we know what we know, and
it will always be the same.</p>

<p>"One time!" their voices cried, leaning upon a bar the bitter
weight of all their discontent. "One time! I've been back one
time--just once in seven years," they said, "and Jesus! that was
plenty. One time was enough! To hell with that damned country!
What have they got now but a lot of cheap spaghetti joints and
skyscrapers?" they said. "If you want a drink, you sneak down
three back-alleyways, get the once-over from a couple of
ex-prize-fighters, and then plank down a dollar for a shot of
varnish that would rot the stomach out of a goat! . . . And the
women!"--the voices rose here with infuriated scorn--"What a nice
lot of cold-blooded gold-digging bastards <i>they've</i> turned
out to be! . . . I spent thirty dollars taking one of 'em to a
show, and to a night-club afterward! When bedtime came do you
think I got anything out of it? . . . 'You may kiss my little
hand,' she says. . . . 'You may kiss my little--that's what you
may do,'" the voices snarled with righteous bitterness. "When I
asked her if she was goin' to come through she started to yell
for the cops! . . . A woman who tried to pull one like that over
here would get sent to Siberia! . . . A nice country, I don't
think! . . . Now, get this! <i>Me,</i> I'm a Frenchman, see!" the
voice said with a convincing earnestness. "These guys know how to
<i>live,</i> see! This is my country where I belong, see! . . .
Johnny, luh m&ecirc;me chose pour mwah et m'seer! . . . Fill 'em
up again, kid."</p>

<p>"Carpen-<i>teer</i>!" the voices then rose jeeringly, in true
accents of French pugnacity. "Sure, I'm a Frenchman--but
Carpen-<i>teer</i>! Where do yuh get that stuff? Christ! Dempsey
could 'a' took that frog the best day that he ever saw! . . . An
accident!" the voices yelled. "Whattya mean--an accident? Didn't
I see the whole thing with my own eyes? Wasn't I back there then?
. . . Wasn't I talkin' t' Jack himself an hour after the fight
was over? . . . An accident! Jesus! The only accident was that he
let him last four rounds. 'I could have taken him in the first if
I wanted to,' Jack says to me. . . . Sure, I'm a Frenchman!" the
voice said with belligerent loyalty. "But Carpen<i>teer!</i>
Jesus! Where do you get that stuff?"</p>

<p>And, brother, I have heard the voices you will never hear,
discussing the graces of a life more cultured than any you will
ever know--and I know and I know, and yet it is still the
same.</p>

<p>Bitterly, bitterly, Boston one time more! the flying leaf, the
broken cloud--"I think," said they, "that we will live here now.
I think," they said, "that we are running down to Spain next
week, so Francis can do a little writing. . . . And really,"
their gay yet cultivated tones continued, "it's wonderful what
you can do here if you only have a little money. . . .
<i>Yes,</i> my dear!" their refined accents continued in a tone
of gay conviction. "It's really quite incredible, you know. . . .
I happen to know of a real honest-to-goodness ch&acirc;teau near
Blois that can be had for something less than $7000! . . . It's
all rather incredible, you know," those light, half-English tones
went on, "when you consider what it takes to live in Brookline! .
. . Francis has always felt that he would like to do a little
writing, and I feel somehow the atmosphere is better here for all
that sort of thing--it really is, you know. Don't you think so?"
said those gay and cultivated tones of Boston which you, my
brother, never yet have heard. "And after all," those cultivated
tones went on in accents of a droll sincerity, "you see all the
people here you really <i>care</i> to see, I <i>mean,</i> you
know! They all come to Paris at one time or another--I
<i>mean,</i> the trouble really is in getting a little time alone
for yourself. . . . Or do you find it so?" the voices suavely,
lightly, asked. . . . "Oh, look! look at that--there!" they cried
with jubilant elation, "I mean, that boy and his girl there,
walking along with their arms around each other! . . . Don't you
just a-do-o-re it? . . . Isn't it too <i>ma-a-rvellous?"</i>
those refined and silvery tones went on with patriotic
tenderness. "I mean, there's something so perfectly sweet and
unselfconscious about it all!" the voices said with all the
cultivated earnestness of Boston! "Now
<i>where?</i>--where?--would you see anything like that at home?"
the voices said triumphantly.</p>

<p>(Seldom in Brookline, lady. Oh, rarely, seldom, almost never
in the town of Brookline, lady. But on the Esplanade--did you
ever go out walking on the Esplanade at night-time, in the hot
and sultry month of August, lady? They are not Frenchmen, lady:
they are all Jews and Irish and Italians, lady, but the noise of
their kissing is like the noise the wind makes through a leafy
grove--it is like the great hooves of a hundred thousand cavalry
being pulled out of the marshy places of the earth, dear
lady.)</p>

<p>". . . I <i>mean</i>--these people really understand that sort
of thing so much better than we do. . . . They're so much
<i>simpler</i> about it. . . . I mean, so much more graceful with
that kind of thing. . . . Il faut un peu de sentiment, n'est-ce
pas? . . . Or do you think so?" said those light, those gay,
those silvery, and half-English tones of cultivated Boston, which
you, my brother, never yet have heard.</p>

<p>(I got you, lady. That was French. I know. . . . But if I felt
your leg, if I began by fondling gracefully your leg, if in a
somewhat graceful Gallic way I felt your leg, and said,
"Ch&eacute;rie! Petite ch&eacute;rie!"--would you remember, lady,
this is Paris?)</p>

<p>Oh, bitterly, bitterly, Boston one time more: their silvery
voices speak an accent you will never know, and of their loins is
marble made, but brother, there are corn-haired girls named
Neilsen out in Minnesota, and the blond thighs of the Lundquist
girl could break a bullock's back.</p>

<p>Oh, bitterly, bitterly, Boston one time more: the French have
little ways about them that we do not have, but, brother, they're
still selling cradles down in Georgia, and in New Orl&eacute;ans
their eyes are dark, their white teeth bite you to the bone.</p>

<p>Oh, bitterly, bitterly, Boston, one time more, and of their
flesh is cod-fish made. Big brother's still waiting for you with
his huge, red fist, behind the barn up in the State of Maine, and
they're still having shotgun marriages at home.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Oh, brother, there are voices you will never hear--ancestral
voices prophesying war, my brother, and rare and radiant voices
that you know not of, as they have read us into doom. The genteel
voices of Oxenford broke once like chimes of weary,
unenthusiastic bells across my brain, speaking to me
compassionately its judgment on our corrupted lives, gently
dealing with the universe, my brother, gently and without
labour--gently, brother, gently, it dealt with all of us, with
easy condescension and amused disdain.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid, old boy," the genteel voices of Oxenford
remarked, "you're up against it over th&ouml;h. . . . I really
am. . . . Th&ouml;h's no peace th&ouml; faw the individual any
longah,"--the genteel voice went on, un-individual brother.
"Obviously," that tolerant voice instructed me, "obviously,
th&ouml;h can be no cultuah in a country so completely lackin' in
tradition as is yo&auml;hs. . . . It's all so objective--if you
see what I main--th&ouml;h's no place left faw the innah life,"
it said, oh, outward brother! ". . . We Europeans have often
obs&ouml;hved (it's <i>very</i> curious, you know) that the
<i>Amer</i>ican is capable of any real feelin'--it seems quite
impawsible faw him to distinguish between true emotion an'
sentimentality--an' he invayably chooses the lattah! . . .
<i>Curious, isn't it?</i>--or do you think so, brother? Of co'se,
th&ouml;h is yo&auml;h beastly dreadful sex-prawblem. . . .
Yo&auml;h women! . . . Oh, deah, deah! . . . Perhaps we'd bettah
say no moah . . . but, th&ouml;h you <i>ah!"</i>--right in the
eye, my brother. "Yo&auml;h country is a matriahky, my deah
fellah . . . it really is, you know." . . . if you can follow us,
dear brother. "The women have the men in a state of complete
subjection . . . the male is rapidly becomin' moah sexless an'
emasculated"--that genteel voice of doom went on--"No!--Decidedly
you have quite a prawblem befoah you. . . . Obviously th&ouml;h
can be no cultuah while such a condition puhsists. . . .
<i>That</i> is why when my friends say to me, 'You ought to see
<i>America, . . .</i> you really ought, you know.' . . . I say,
'No, thanks. . . . If you don't mind, I'd rathah not. . . . I
think I'll stay at home . . . I'm sorry,'" the compassionate
tones of Oxenford went on, "but that's the way I feel--it really
is, you know. . . . Of co'se, I know you couldn't undahstand my
feelin'--faw aftah all, you ah a Yank--but th&ouml;h you ah!
Sorry!" it said regretfully, as it spoke its courteous but
inexorable judgments of eternal exile, brother, and removed for
ever the possibility of your ever hearing it. "But that's the way
I feel! I hope you don't mind," the voice said gently, with
compassion.</p>

<p>No, sir, I don't mind. We don't mind, he, she, it, or they
don't mind. Nobody minds, sir, nobody minds. Because, just as you
say, sir, oceans are between us, seas have sundered us, there is
a magic in you that we cannot fathom--a light, a flame, a
glory--an impalpable, indefinable, incomprehensible, undeniable
something or other, something which I can never understand or
measure because--just as you say, sir--with such compassionate
regret, I am--I am--a Yank.</p>

<p>'Tis true, my brother, we are Yanks. Oh, 'tis true, 'tis true!
I am a Yank! Yet, wherefore Yank, good brother? Hath not a Yank
ears? Hath not a Yank lies, truths, bowels of mercy, fears, joys,
and lusts? Is he not warmed by the same sun, washed by the same
ocean, rotted by the same decay, and eaten by the same worms as a
German is? If you kill him, does he not die? If you sweat him,
does he not stink? If you lie with his wife or his mistress, does
she not whore, lie, fornicate and betray, even as a Frenchman's
does? If you strip him, is he not naked as a Swede? Is his hide
less white than Baudelaire's? Is his breath more foul than the
King of Spain's? Is his belly bigger, his neck fatter, his face
more hoggish, and his eye more shiny than a Munich brewer's? Will
he not cheat, rape, thieve, whore, curse, hate, and murder like
any European? Aye--Yank! But wherefore, wherefore Yank--good
brother?</p>

<p>Brother, have we come then from a fated stock? Augured from
birth, announced by two dark angels, named in our mother's womb?
And for what? For what? Fatherless, to grope our feelers on the
sea's dark bed, among the polyped squirms, the blind sucks and
crawls and sea-valves of the brain, loaded with memory that will
not die? To cry our love out in the wilderness, to wake always in
the night, smiting the pillow in some foreign land, thinking for
ever of the myriad sights and sounds of home?</p>

<p>"While Paris Sleeps!"--By God! while Paris sleeps, to wake and
walk and not to sleep; to wake and walk and sleep and wake, and
sleep again, seeing dawn come at the window-square that cast its
wedge before our glazed, half-sleeping eyes, seeing soft, hated
foreign light, and breathing soft, dull languid air that could
not bite and tingle up the blood, seeing legend and lie and fable
wither in our sight as we saw what we saw, knew what we knew.</p>

<p>Sons of the lost and lonely fathers, sons of the wanderers,
children of hardy loins, the savage earth, the pioneers, what had
we to do with all their bells and churches? Could we feed our
hunger on portraits of the Spanish king? Brother, for what? For
what? To kill the giant of loneliness and fear, to slay the
hunger that would not rest, that would not give us rest.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Of wandering for ever, and the earth again. Brother, for what?
For what? For what? For the wilderness, the immense and lonely
land. For the unendurable hunger, the unbearable ache, the
incurable loneliness. For the exultancy whose only answer is the
wild goat-cry. For a million memories, ten thousand sights and
sounds and shapes and smells and names of things that only we can
know.</p>

<p>For what? For what? Not for a nation. Not for a people, not
for an empire, not for a thing we love or hate.</p>

<p>For what? For a cry, a space, an ecstasy. For a savage and
nameless hunger. For a living and intolerable memory that may not
for a second be forgotten, since it includes all the moments of
our lives, includes all we do and are. For a living memory; for
ten thousand memories; for a million sights and sounds and
moments; for something like nothing else on earth; for something
which possesses us.</p>

<p>For something under our feet, and around us and over us;
something that is in us and part of us, and proceeds from us,
that beats in all the pulses of our blood.</p>

<p>Brother, for what?</p>

<p>First for the thunder of imperial names, the names of men and
battles, the names of places and great rivers, the mighty names
of the States. The name of The Wilderness; and the names of
Antietam, Chancellorsville, Shiloh, Bull Run, Fredericksburg,
Cold Harbour, the Wheat Fields, Ball's Bluff, and the Devil's
Den; the names of Cowpens, Brandywine, and Saratoga; of Death
Valley, Chickamauga, and the Cumberland Gap. The names of the
Nantahalahs, the Bad Lands, the Painted Desert, the Yosemite, and
the Little Big Horn; the names of Yancey and Cabarrus counties;
and the terrible name of Hatteras.</p>

<p>Then, for the continental thunder of the States: the names of
Montana, Texas, Arizona, Colorado, Michigan, Maryland, Virginia,
and the two Dakotas; the names of Oregon and Indiana, of Kansas
and the rich Ohio; the powerful name of Pennsylvania, and the
name of Old Kentucky; the undulance of Alabama; the names of
Florida and North Carolina.</p>

<p>In the red-oak thickets, at the break of day, long hunters lay
for bear--the rattle of arrows in laurel leaves, the war-cries
round the painted buttes, and the majestical names of the Indian
nations: the Pawnees, the Algonquins, the Iroquois, the
Comanches, the Blackfeet, the Seminoles, the Cherokees, the
Sioux, the Hurons, the Mohawks, the Navajos, the Utes, the
Omahas, the Onondagas, the Chippewas, the Crees, the Chickasaws,
the Arapahoes, the Catawbas, the Dakotas, the Apaches, the
Croatans, and the Tuscaroras; the names of Powhatan and Sitting
Bull; and the name of the great Chief, Rain-In-The-Face. Of
wandering for ever, and the earth again: in red-oak thickets, at
the break of day, long hunters lay for bear. The arrows rattle in
the laurel leaves, and the elm-roots thread the bones of buried
lovers. There have been war-cries on the Western trails, and on
the plains the gun-stock rusts upon a handful of bleached bones.
The barren earth? Was no love living in the wilderness?</p>

<p>The rails go westward in the dark. Brother, have you seen
starlight on the rails? Have you heard the thunder of the fast
express?</p>

<p>Of wandering for ever, and the earth again--the names of the
mighty rails that bind the nation, the wheeled thunder of the
names that net the continent: the Pennsylvania, the Union
Pacific, the Santa F&eacute;, the Baltimore and Ohio, the Chicago
and Northwestern, the Southern, the Louisiana and Northern, the
Seaboard Air Line, the Chicago, Milwaukee and Saint Paul, the
Lackawanna, the New York, New Haven and Hartford, the Florida
East Coast, the Rock Island, and the Denver and Rio Grande.</p>

<p>Brother, the names of the engines, the engineers, and the
sleeping-cars: the great engines of the Pacific type, the
articulated Mallets with three sets of eight-yoked
driving-wheels, the 400-ton thunderbolts with J. T. Cline, T. J.
McRae, and the demon hawk-eyes of H. D. Campbell on the
rails.</p>

<p>The names of the great tramps who range the nation on the
fastest trains: the names of the great tramps Oklahoma Red, Fargo
Pete, Dixie Joe, Iron Mike, The Frisco Kid, Nigger Dick, Red Chi,
Ike the Kike, and The Jersey Dutchman.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>By the waters of life, by time, by time, Lord Tennyson stood
among the rocks, and stared. He had long hair, his eyes were deep
and sombre, and he wore a cape; he was a poet, and there was
magic and mystery in his touch, for he had heard the horns of
Elfland faintly blowing. And by the waters of life, by time, by
time, Lord Tennyson stood among the cold, grey rocks, and
commanded the sea to break--break--break! And the sea broke, by
the waters of life, by time, by time, as Lord Tennyson commanded
it to do, and his heart was sad and lonely as he watched the
stately ships (of the Hamburg-American Packet Company, fares
forty-five dollars and up, first-class) go on to their haven
under the hill, and Lord Tennyson would that his heart could
utter the thoughts that arose in him.</p>

<p>By the waters of life, by time, by time: the names of the
mighty rivers, the alluvial gluts, the drains of the continent,
the throats that drink America (Sweet Thames, flow gently till I
end my song). The names of the men who pass, and the myriad names
of the earth that abides for ever: the names of the men who are
doomed to wander, and the name of that immense and lonely land on
which they wander, to which they return, in which they will be
buried--America! The immortal earth which waits for ever, the
trains that thunder on the continent, the men who wander, and the
women who cry out, "Return!"</p>

<p>Finally, the names of the great rivers that are flowing in the
darkness (Sweet Thames, flow gently till I end my song.)</p>

<p>By the waters of life, by time, by time: the names of great
mouths, the mighty maws, the vast, wet, coiling, never-glutted
and unending snakes that drink the continent. Where, sons of men,
and in what other land will you find others like them, and where
can you match the mighty music of their names?--The Monongahela,
the Colorado, the Rio Grande, the Columbia, the Tennessee, the
Hudson (Sweet Thames!); the Kennebec, the Rappahannock, the
Delaware, the Penobscot, the Wabash, the Chesapeake, the
Swannanoa, the Indian River, the Niagara (Sweet Afton!); the
Saint Lawrence, the Susquehanna, the Tombigbee, the Nantahala,
the French Broad, the Chattahoochee, the Arizona, and the Potomac
(Father Tiber!)--these are a few of their princely names, these
are a few of their great, proud, glittering names, fit for the
immense and lonely land that they inhabit.</p>

<p>Oh, Tiber! Father Tiber! You'd only be a suckling in that
mighty land! And as for you, sweet Thames, flow gently till I end
my song: flow gently, gentle Thames, be well-behaved, sweet
Thames, speak softly and politely, little Thames, flow gently
till I end my song.</p>

<p>By the waters of life, by time, by time, and of the yellow cat
that smites the nation, of the belly of the snake that coils
across the land--of the terrible names of the rivers in flood,
the rivers that foam and welter in the dark, that smash the
levees, that flood the lowlands for two thousand miles, that
carry the bones of the cities seaward on their tides: of the
awful names of the Tennessee, the Arkansas, the Missouri, the
Mississippi, and even the little mountain rivers, brothers, in
the season of the floods.</p>

<p>Delicately they dive for Greeks before the railway station:
the canoe glides gently through the portals of the waiting-room
(for whites). Full fathom five the carcass of old man Lype is
lying (of his bones is coral made) and delicately they dive for
luncheon-room Greeks before the railway station.</p>

<p>Brother, what fish are these? The floatage of sunken rooms,
the sodden bridal-veils of poverty, the slime of mined parlour
plush, drowned faces in the family album; and the blur of
long-drowned eyes, blurred features, whited, bloated flesh.</p>

<p>Delicately they dive for Greeks before the railway station.
The stern, good, half-drowned faces of the brothers Trade and
Mark survey the tides. Cardui! Miss Lillian Leitzell twists upon
one arm above the flood; the clown, half-sunken to his waist,
swims upward out of swirling yellow; the tiger bares his teeth
above the surges of a river he will never drink. The ragged
tatters of the circus posters are plastered on soaked boards. And
delicately they dive for Greeks before the railway station.</p>

<p>Have we not seen them, brother?</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>For what are we, my brother? We are a phantom flare of grieved
desire, the ghostling and phosphoric flicker of immortal time, a
brevity of days haunted by the eternity of the earth. We are an
unspeakable utterance, an insatiable hunger, an unquenchable
thirst; a lust that bursts our sinews, explodes our brains,
sickens and rots our insides, and rips our hearts asunder. We are
a twist of passion, a moment's flame of love and ecstasy, a sinew
of bright blood and agony, a lost cry, a music of pain and joy, a
haunting of brief, sharp hours, an almost captured beauty, a
demon's whisper of unbodied memory. We are the dupes of time.</p>

<p>For, brother, what are we?</p>

<p>We are the sons of our father, whose face we have never seen,
we are the sons of our father, whose voice we have never heard,
we are the sons of our father, to whom we have cried for strength
and comfort in our agony, we are the sons of our father, whose
life like ours was lived in solitude and in the wilderness, we
are the sons of our father, to whom only can we speak out the
strange, dark burden of our heart and spirit, we are the sons of
our father, and we shall follow the print of his foot for
ever.</p>

<h1>XCVIII</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>How long he had remained at Tours he scarcely knew: suspended
in this spell of time and memory, he seemed to have detached
himself not only from the infinite connections that bound him to
the past, but from every project and direction that he had
considered for the future. Day after day he stayed in his little
room above the cobbled court of the hotel; he ate his meals
there, going out at nightfall to eat and drink in a caf&eacute;,
to walk about the streets, once or twice to go home with a woman
of the town, and finally to come back to his room, to write
furiously for hours, and then, stretched out in bed, nailed to
the rock of a furiously wakeful sleep, to live again through the
immense and spaceless images of night, in an alert but comatose
hypnosis of the will.</p>

<p>One morning he awoke with a shock of apprehension, the
foreboding of calamitous mischance. It was the first time in
weeks that he had taken thought of the state of his resources or
felt any care or worry for the future. He counted his money with
feverish haste, and discovered that less than 250 francs
remained. For a moment he sat on the edge of the bed, holding the
little wad of franc notes in his hand, stunned and bewildered by
this sudden realization that his funds were exhausted, and for
the moment not knowing what to do. His hotel bill for the week
was due; he went at once to the bureau and asked for it; a hasty
calculation assured him that when he had paid it, less than
twenty francs would be left.</p>

<p>He knew no one in Tours to whom he could appeal for aid; one
glance at the impeccable, cold courtesy of the female face, hard,
dark and Gallic, in the bureau of the hotel--the basalt of the
eyes, the line of hair across the brows--told him that he could
as soon wring milk and honey from the cobble-stones as extract an
ounce of charitable relief from the granite coffers of her soul.
The brows drew in, the black eyes hardened with a cold narrowing
of mistrust: even before he spoke he saw she had read the story
of his profligate extravagance, and that from that moment the
hard propriety of her suspicious soul had been turned against him
with that virtuous dislike which such people feel for unmoneyed
men. When he spoke, therefore, it was to tell her he was leaving
that day: she inclined her dark, hard face impassively, saying:
"Oui, monsieur," and asked if he would have his room vacated by
twelve o'clock.</p>

<p>He went to the railway station and looked up rates and
distances. During the whole period of his stay in Tours--in fact,
during the whole course of his wanderings since leaving Paris--he
had been vaguely assured that he was moving in the general
direction of Provence, Marseilles, and the South. He now
discovered, on consulting a map, that he was off this course by
some hundreds of kilometres, and on the southwest road to
Bordeaux, the Pyrenees, and Spain. For a moment, he was decided
to take the train for Bordeaux--a post card from Ann had been
mailed from Carcassonne, and she had informed him that they were
on their way to Biarritz. A brief inquiry, however, convinced him
that his funds were by no means sufficient to get him even as far
as Bordeaux and, over there, he felt, his case was more desperate
than ever. He knew no one there and had no hope of meeting anyone
he knew. He discovered also that the lowest fare back to
Paris--the third-class fare--was about thirty-four francs, almost
twice as much as he possessed.</p>

<p>Finally, with a feeling of malevolent joy--for, curiously, a
growing realization of his plight, and the dark, hard eyes of the
Frenchmen fixed on him in an expression of avaricious mistrust,
had now wakened in him a jubilant indifference, a desire to roar
with laughter--he thought of Orl&eacute;ans and the Countess.</p>

<p>He found that his funds were sufficient for third-class fare
to Orl&eacute;ans, which was about seventeen francs, and that a
train was leaving in an hour. Returning to the hotel, he packed
his valise with frenzied haste, throwing his clothes in and
stamping it down with his feet, rode to the station in the
hotel's horse-drawn bus, and an hour later was on his way back to
Orl&eacute;ans.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Late March had come: the day was overcast with thin, grey
clouds, an uncertain milky radiance of light; the fields and
earth and forests, still bare, had a moist, thawed fertility that
spoke of spring. On the way up, snow began to fall, a brief
flurry of large, wet flakes that melted as they fell: it was soon
over, and the sun broke through in thin, wavering gusts of
light.</p>

<p>There were no other passengers in his compartment; he sat
looking out of the window across the wet fields, and from time to
time, as he visualized the look of startled, crafty apprehension
on the Countess's face when she saw him, he burst into wild,
sudden whoops and yells of laughter that echoed loudly above the
steady pounding of the wheels.</p>

<p>It was noon when he reached Orl&eacute;ans: he took his heavy
bag and went limping out across the station square, pausing once
to rest his aching arms and change his grip. On entering the
hotel he found Yvonne in the bureau. She looked up from her
ledger as he entered, her dark face hardening with a mistrust of
cold surprise as she saw him.</p>

<p>"Monsieur has returned to stay?" she inquired, and looking
towards his valise. "You wish a room?"</p>

<p>"I do not know yet," he said easily. "I shall let you know in
a few minutes. At present, I should like to speak to the
Countess. Is she here?"</p>

<p>She did not answer for a moment, her black brows gathered in a
line, and her eyes grew perceptibly harder, colder, more
mistrustful as she looked at him.</p>

<p>"Yes. I s'ink she is in her room," she said at length. "I vill
see. . . . Jean!" she called sharply, and struck a bell.</p>

<p>The porter appeared, started with surprise when he saw the
youth, and then smiled cordially and greeted him in friendly
fashion. Then he turned inquiringly to Yvonne. She spoke
curtly:</p>

<p>"Dites &agrave; Madame la Comtesse que Monsieur le jeune
Am&eacute;ricain est revenu. Il attend."</p>

<p>"Mais oui, monsieur," the porter said briskly, turning towards
him. "Et votre bagage?" he looked inquiringly at the valise.
"Vous restez ici?"</p>

<p>"Je ne sais pas. Je vous dirai plus tard. Merci," he said, as
the porter took the valise and put it away behind the office
desk.</p>

<p>The porter departed with his message. Yvonne returned to her
books, and he waited, pacing the hall in a state of nervous
elation, until he heard the old woman's voice, sharp, startled,
excited, speaking to the porter on the floor above. Then he heard
her coming down the stairs, turned and faced her
sharply-inquiring, apprehensive face as she came down, and was
vigorously pumping her uncertain and unwilling little claw,
before she had time to stammer out a greeting:</p>

<p>"But what--why--what brings you here?" she said. "I thought
you had returned to Paris by now. Where have you been?" she asked
sharply.</p>

<p>"In Tours," he answered.</p>

<p>"Tours! But what were you doing there all this time? . . .
What happened to you?" she asked suspiciously.</p>

<p>"Ah, Countess," he said solemnly, "it is a long story." Then,
with a deliberate burlesque of portentous gravity, he lowered his
voice and whispered hoarsely, "I fell among thieves."</p>

<p>"What--?" she said in a faltering tone. "What are you saying?
. . . You mean you have come back here . . . that you have no . .
. how much money have you left?" she demanded sharply.</p>

<p>He thrust his hand into his trousers pocket, fished around and
pulled out a few small coins: four two-franc pieces, a franc, two
twenty-five-centime coins, a ten- and a five-centime piece--</p>

<p>"That's all," he said, counting them over. "Nine francs
sixty-five."</p>

<p>"W-w-w-w-what?" she stammered. "Nine francs sixty-five--do you
mean that's all you have left?"</p>

<p>"That's all," he said cheerfully, "but now that I'm here at
last it doesn't matter."</p>

<p>"Here!" she gasped. "Do you mean you are going--what do you
intend to do?" she said sharply.</p>

<p>"Oh," he said easily, "I shall wait here until I get money
from America."</p>

<p>"And--and how long do you think that will take?" the old woman
was twisting her skinny fingers with feverish apprehension.</p>

<p>"Oh, not long," he said airily. "I wrote my mother yesterday,
and it ought not to take over four weeks to get an answer."</p>

<p>"Four or five weeks!" the old woman said hoarsely. "What are
you saying? Four or five weeks, and you have nine francs
sixty-five in your pockets! My God! the man is mad!"</p>

<p>"Oh, that part of it will be all right, I guess," he said with
an easy laugh. "I told my mother all about you and Monsieur and
Madame Vatel, and all my other friends here, and how good you had
been to me, and how you were always befriending Americans, and
how they call you Little Mother. I told her you couldn't have
been kinder to me if you'd been my own mother, and that she
didn't need to worry about me at all. So I guess that part of
it's all right," he concluded comfortably. "I told her that I'd
just put up here at the hotel, and that you and the Vatels would
take good care of me until the money comes from home."</p>

<p>"Put up here! . . . For four or five weeks! . . . Hush, my
boy! Hush!" she whispered, clutching him feverishly with her bony
little claw and casting an apprehensive glance towards Yvonne,
whose dark head was lowered studiously above her ledger, but who
suggested, by a certain strained attentiveness of posture, that
she was missing none of the conversation.</p>

<p>"Come," the Countess whispered feverishly again, pulling him
towards the stairway as she spoke. "You come with me, my boy. I
want to talk to you alone."</p>

<p>They went upstairs to a parlour on the first floor, deserted,
closed, a little stale with its sumptuous bordello furnishings of
gilt and crimson plush. There the Countess turned to him and said
directly:</p>

<p>"See here, my boy. What you want to do is out of the question.
It will be impossible for you to stay here for four or five
weeks! Impossible!" she cried, twisting her bony little hands
with growing agitation. "It cannot be done!"</p>

<p>He looked surprised, a little pained.</p>

<p>"Why?" he said.</p>

<p>"Because," she said, and now at last her tone was simple and
direct in its quiet assertion, "the Vatels will not keep you
here--they will not give you credit for so long a time--"</p>

<p>"And you?" he said quietly.</p>

<p>"My friend," the old woman answered simply, "I have not got
it." She raised her bony little shoulders in a shrug. "At the
present moment I have nothing--not a sou! I get a little money
from America on the first and fifteenth of each month--if I had
it, I would give it to you, but I have nothing now. And what I
get would not be nearly enough to pay your expenses here for five
weeks. It cannot be done."</p>

<p>For the first time since his return he felt respect and
sympathy for her; in face of the plain and honest directness of
her confession all of his former humour of cynical mockery had
vanished. He said:</p>

<p>"In that case it cannot be done. You are right. I must try to
get help elsewhere."</p>

<p>"You have friends in Paris, haven't you? You know people
there--Americans?"</p>

<p>"Yes--I think I could get help from someone if I were in
Paris."</p>

<p>"Then I shall try to help you to get there," she said quickly.
"How much will you need?"</p>

<p>"I think the third-class fare from here is about seventeen
francs," he said.</p>

<p>"And you have--how much? Nine sixty-five?" She calculated
swiftly, was silent a moment, and then, with an air of decision,
marked by a faint flush of painful embarrassment on her withered
cheek as she thought of the unpleasant task before her, she said:
"If you will wait here, I will go below and see what I can do
with these people. . . . I do not know," she said shortly, the
faint flush deepening as she spoke, "but I will try."</p>

<p>She left him and presently he heard voices below, mixed in
rapid and excited argument. In ten minutes the old woman
returned. In her hand she held a ten-franc note.</p>

<p>"Here," she said, giving it to him. "With what you have, it
will be enough to get you to Paris. I have inquired. There is a
train in twenty minutes. Now, my boy," she said quickly, taking
him by the arm, "you must go. You will just have time to buy your
ticket and get on the train. You have no time to lose."</p>

<p>He had been surprised and disappointed at the meagre exactness
of her loan: he had eaten nothing all day long and suddenly, with
no funds to spare and the prospect of a continued and indefinite
fast before him, he felt ravenously hungry. And now it was his
turn to redden with embarrassment; he found it difficult to
speak, and in a moment said hesitantly:</p>

<p>"I wonder if these people here would let me have a sandwich. .
. . I've had nothing to eat."</p>

<p>She did not answer; he saw the faint flush deepen on her
sallow cheeks again and, already sorry for the additional
distress his request had caused her, he said quickly:</p>

<p>"No, it doesn't matter. I'll get something when I get to
Paris. Besides, there's not time now, anyway. I'll have to get
that train."</p>

<p>"Yes," she said quickly, with relief. "I think you should.
That is best. . . . And now, my boy, make haste. You have no more
time to lose."</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Countess," he said, taking her by the hand, and
suddenly feeling for the old, lonely, and penniless woman the
deepest affection and respect he had ever felt for her. "You have
really been my friend. I'm sorry that I've had to cause you this
trouble. I'll send you the money when I get to Paris. Good-bye,
now, and good luck to you."</p>

<p>When she answered, her voice was quiet and her old eyes were
sad and tranquilly resigned:</p>

<p>"Ah," she said, "I was afraid that this would happen to you. I
have known so many Americans--they are so reckless, so
extravagant, they do not watch their money. . . . Good-bye, my
boy," she now said quietly, clasping his hand. "Take care of
yourself and do not get into any more trouble. . . . Let me know
if all goes well with you. . . . Good-bye, good-bye. . . . Ah,
you are so young, aren't you? Some day you will learn. . . .
Good-bye, God bless you--you must hurry now--good-bye.
Good-bye."</p>

<p>She followed him as he went quickly down the stairs, and stood
on the stairs watching him as he departed. His valise had been
put out before the bureau, where he could get it easily: Yvonne
and Madame Vatel were waiting silently in the office. Yvonne did
not speak at all; when he spoke to Madame Vatel, she cocked her
head a little and said coldly: "Monsieur?"</p>

<p>He seized the valise and started for the door with it at a
rapid limping stride. At the door he paused, turned, and saw the
Countess, still standing on the stairs and looking at him with
old, sad eyes.</p>

<p>"Good-bye," he cried in jubilant farewell. "Good-bye,
Countess."</p>

<p>"Good-bye, my boy," her voice was so weary, old, and sad he
could scarcely hear her.</p>

<p>Then he limped rapidly away from the hotel, across the square,
and towards the station and the train.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>All through the afternoon the train roared up across the fat
and fertile countryside towards Paris. A late sun broke through
ragged clouds of torn gold: the light was wild and radiant with a
prophecy of spring. In the compartment his only companion was a
young soldier: a boy of eighteen, tall, gawky, big of hand and
foot and limb, looking even clumsier than he really was in his
thick-soled army shoes, his blue-olive uniform--his long shanks
coarsely wound with bands of olive cloth.</p>

<p>The boy had a friendly, olive-coloured face, a little marred
by pimples and fuzzy unshaved hair; he talked constantly, amiably
indifferent to his companion's foreign speech and manner,
garrulously friendly in a hoarse boy's voice.</p>

<p>In the middle of the afternoon he began to unpack various
bundles from the staggering impedimenta of military equipment
with which he was surrounded. From a pocket of his overcoat he
solemnly fished out an enormous tin of sardines. From another
package he took out a gigantic bottle of red wine, and with the
same gravity began to unfold from its wrapping in a newspaper a
three-foot loaf of crusty bread.</p>

<p>Then, with the same deliberate concentration, he opened the
sardine tin, uncorked the wine-bottle and took a hearty
preliminary swig, pulled out a clasp-knife with an evil-looking
six-inch blade and, holding the loaf gripped firmly between his
knees, began with a backward motion to carve a crisp and liberal
slab out of the crusty loaf. This done, he put the bread aside,
solemnly impaled a huge sardine upon the point of his gleaming
knife, smacked it down upon the slab of bread and, furnishing
himself with another hearty swig of the red wine, began to poke
the sandwich happily away towards its intended destination,
carrying on a choked but completely unperturbed conversation with
his companion as he did so.</p>

<p>And his fellow traveller, gazing on that coarse but appetizing
fare, felt the pangs of hunger awake in him again with such
maddening insistence that the whole legend of his starved desire
must have been written on his yearning face and in his greedy
eyes. At any rate, the young soldier, his mouth still crammed
with food, uttered some inarticulate but friendly sounds, in
which the word "Mangez" alone was intelligible, suddenly thrust
loaf, bottle, knife, and sardine tin towards his starved
companion, and with a gesture of rude encouragement, hoarsely
spattered forth again:</p>

<p>"Mangez!"</p>

<p>The fellow-traveller required no second bidding. He fell to
ravenously on sardines, wine, and crusty loaf; they sat there
cramming themselves enthusiastically, uttering choked and muffled
sounds from time to time and grinning at each other amiably.</p>

<p>Nothing he had ever eaten tasted as good as that coarse fare;
the strong, plain wine was pulsing warmly in his veins, the food
made a warm glow in his grateful belly; outside, the sun had
broken through in stripes of ragged gold and bronze, above the
wheels he could hear great roars of hearty country laughter from
another compartment, the high, rich, sanguinary voice of a
Frenchman as he cried "Parbleu!"</p>

<p>And he was going back to Paris again, without a penny, a
prospect, or a plan, and he felt no care nor pain nor trouble any
longer--nothing but wild joy and jubilant happiness such as he
had never felt before. He did not know why.</p>

<p> </p>

<h1>XCIX</h1>
</center>

<p> </p>

<p>Early in April money came from home, and he was on his way
again. This time he started South in true earnest, hurtling
southward on one of the crack trains of the P. L. M., his nose
flattened against the window of the compartment and his eyes
glued on the landscape with such an unwinking intensity, a
desperate and insatiate greed, that his fellow-passengers stared
at him curiously and then looked at one another with quiet smiles
and winks.</p>

<p>As it had always done, the movement and experience of the
train filled him with a sense of triumph, joy, and luxury. The
crack express, with its gleaming cars, its richly furnished
compartments, its luxurious restaurant, warm with wine and food
and opulence and suave service, together with the appearance of
the passengers, who had the look of ease and wealth and
cosmopolitan assurance that one finds among people who travel on
such trains, awoke in him again the feeling of a nameless and
impending joy, the fulfilment of some impossible happiness, the
feeling of wealth and success which a train had always given him,
even when he had only a few dollars in his pocket, and that now,
in the groomed luxury of this European express, was immeasurably
enhanced.</p>

<p>On such a train, indeed, the compact density of the European
continent became thrilling in its magical immediacy: one felt
everywhere around him--in the assured and wealthy-looking men,
the lovely and seductive-looking women--even in the landscape
that stretched past with its look of infinite cultivation, its
beautifully chequered design of fields, its ancient scheme of
towns and villages and old farm buildings--the sense of a life
rich with the maturity of centuries, infinitely various and
fascinating in its evocation of a world given without reserve to
pleasure, love, and luxury--in short, the American's dream of
"Europe," a world with all the labour, pain, and fear, the
rasping care and fury of his own harsh world, left out.</p>

<p>At Lyons, midway on his journey to the South, he left the
train. And again, he did not know the reason for his stopping: he
had been told that "there was nothing to be seen," but the place
was a great city; his old hunger for new cities conquered him, he
paused to stay a day and stayed a week.</p>

<p>Later he could remember just four things that had held him
there in that great provincial town. They were a river, two
restaurants, and a girl. The river was the Rh&ocirc;ne; it came
foaming out of the Alps to form at Lyons its juncture with the
Sa&ocirc;ne. Day after day he sat on a caf&eacute; terrace
looking at the river; it foamed past bright and glacial, green as
emerald, cold and shining, bearing in for ever its message of the
Alps, the thaw of crystal ice, the coming on of spring. All of
the coming of the spring was somehow written in the cold,
sparkling and unforgettable green loveliness of that shining
water; it haunted him like something he had always known, like
something he had found, like something he would one day
discover.</p>

<p>The food in the town was incomparable. It was a native
cookery, a food belonging to the region--plain, pungent,
peasant-like and nobly good; there is in all the world no better
cooking than can be found in the great provincial town of
Lyons.</p>

<p>At two places there, La M&egrave;re Guy's and La M&egrave;re
Filliou's, they call their best cooks by the name of "mother."
They offer eating fit for kings, yet all so reasonable and plain
that almost any man can afford it. La M&egrave;re Guy's
establishment is in an old house with various old rooms all used
as restaurants. The floor is sanded, there are no suave carpets,
no low murmuring of refined voices, no thin tinkle of musical
glasses, none of the suave, worldly luxury that one finds in the
great restaurants of Paris. It is a place not made for
tourists--for Lyons is not a tourist town, and what tourist
before ever came there to eat?--It is a place made for the
Lyonnais--according to their taste--and one will find them there
at Mother Guy's and Filliou's, in all their robust,
straightforward eating earnestness. Mother Filliou's is a more
open sort of place than Mother Guy's; it is across the river,
away from the central part of Lyons, which is on an island formed
by the green girdling of the Rh&ocirc;ne and Sa&ocirc;ne. At
Mother Filliou's one can look inside; when the weather permits,
most people eat outside on a terrace: Mother Filliou's has more
sunlight, open air, and gaiety, but the rooms at Mother Guy's
have a more convenient, closed, and homely appearance. Both
places are crowded with solid-looking Lyonnais of both sexes,
their faces filled with sanguinary life, their voices loud and
robust, their napkins tucked in under their chins, as they set
heartily to work.</p>

<p>The food is largely chicken, beef, and fish, superbly cooked.
One will never forget the chicken at Mother Guy's or Mother
Filliou's: the chicken is plump and tender country chicken, fresh
from the lovely countryside near Lyons; it is so crisp and
succulent it almost melts away in your mouth. The beef is thick
and juicy and tender, everything is cooked plainly, but with all
the peasant spice and pungency; they like spicy and robust
relishes, and one eats whole onions, pickled in a kind of brine.
There, people drink only one wine, but that is Beaujolais, a
plain, grand wine that in this town is cheaper than mineral
water, and seems made by nature to wash down such victuals as
these people eat.</p>

<p>On the opposite side of the central isle of Lyons, which is
the side bounded by the Sa&ocirc;ne, there is a steep hill
surmounted by the church of Notre-Dame-de-Fourvi&egrave;re, a
famous place of pilgrimage for the devout. And there, one day,
while pilgrims filed in to see the relics and pay devotion to
their saint, and while some monks were chanting from their
sonorous and reverberating litany through the great spaces, he
saw a girl he could not forget: she sat down across the aisle
from him, looked at him, smiled drowsily. She was small, plump;
her figure was erotically seductive; she raised her head, and
seemed to listen drowsily to chanting monks, and he saw that in
her neck, a warm, slow pulse was beating--slowly, slowly, richly,
warmly beating. She turned her eyes, which were grey and smoky
with a cat-like potency, and looked at him again, smiled
drowsily, and slowly crossed her heavy legs with a slow, sensual
sliding of warm silk. And all the time the pulse beat slowly,
richly, with a drowsy warmth of maddening and hot desire--and
that was the last of the four things he saw, remembered, and
could not forget of Lyons.</p>

<p>A shining river, emerald-green, and magic with its Alpine
prescience of spring, of known, undiscovered loveliness; the
noble cooking of Mother Guy and Mother Filliou; a pulse in the
throat of an unknown girl that beat its slow, warm promise of
fulfilled desire--these, of a town of more than six hundred
thousand lives and faces, were all that later clearly would
remain.</p>

<p>The rest was smoke and silence--some faces here and there, a
scheme of streets, an enormous square, a hill crowned with a
pilgrim's church, a priest, broad-hatted, with slit mouth and
gimlet eyes, some museum relics out of ancient Gaul--all fugitive
and broken, gone like smoke.</p>

<p>. . . An emerald river and a shining light; some glorious
cookery and drink; the pulse-beat in the warm throat of a
girl--these would remain. Smoke! Smoke! has it been otherwise
with any man?</p>

<p>And again, he was hurtling southward in a train.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Time, please, time. . . . What time is it? . . . Gentlemen,
it's closing time. . . . Time, gentlemen . . . that time of year
thou mayst in me behold. . . . In the good old summer-time. . . .
I keep thinking of you all the time . . . all the time . . . and
all the time. . . . A long time ago the world began. . . . There
goes the last bell, run, boy, run: you'll just have time. . . .
There are times that make you ha-a-ap-py, there are times that
make you sa-a-ad. . . . Do you remember the night you came back
to the University: it was that time right after your brother's
death, you had just come back that night; I know I was coming
across the campus before Old East when I saw you coming up the
path with a suitcase in your hand. It was raining, but we both
stopped and began to talk there--we stepped in under one of the
oak-trees because it was raining. I can still remember the old,
wet, shining bark of the tree--the reason I can remember is that
you put your hand out and leaned against the tree as you talked
to me and I kept thinking how tall you were--of course you didn't
notice it, you weren't conscious of it, but you had your head up
and it must have been about eight feet above the ground. But I
can remember everything we said that night--it was that time when
you came back just after your brother's death: that's when it was
all right, I guess that's why I can remember it so well. . . .
It's time all little boys were in bed. . . . Now, boy, I'll tell
you when it was: it was that time your Papa made that trip to
California--the reason that I know is I had just got a letter
from him that morning written from Los Angeles telling me how he
had seen John Balch and old Professor Truman, and how they had
both gone into the real-estate business out there, and both of
them getting rich by leaps and bounds--but that's just exactly
when it was, sir, the time he made that trip out there in 1906,
along towards the end of February, and I had just finished
reading his letter when--well, as I say now . . . Garfield,
Arthur, Harrison and Hayes . . . time of my father's time, life
of his life. "Ah, Lord," he said, "I knew them all--and all of
them are gone. I'm the only one that's left. By God! I'm getting
old." . . . In the year that the locusts came, something that
happened in the year the locusts came, two voices that I heard
there in that year. . . . Child! Child! It seems so long ago
since the year the locusts came, and all of the trees were eaten
bare: so much has happened, and it seems so long ago. . . .</p>

<p>"To keep time with!"--To Eugene Gant, Presented to Him on the
Occasion of His Twelfth Birthday, by His Brother, B. H. Gant,
October 3, 1912. . . . "To keep time with!" . . . Up on the
mountain, down in the valley, deep, deep in the hill, Ben, cold,
cold, cold.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>"Ces arbres--"</p>

<p>"Monsieur?" a thin, waxed face of tired Gaul, professionally
attentive, the eyebrows arched perplexedly above old tired eyes,
the waiter's fatigued napkin on the arm.</p>

<p>"--Monsieur--?"</p>

<p>"Ces arbres--" he stammered, pointing
helplessly--"J'ai--j'ai--mais je les ai vu--avant--"</p>

<p>"Monsieur?"--the eyebrows still more patient, puzzled and
concerned, the voice wrought with attention--"vous dites,
monsieur?"</p>

<p>"J'ai dit que--ces arbres--je les ai vu--" he blundered
helplessly, and suddenly muttered, with a face gone sullen and
ashamed--"&Ccedil;a ne fait rien--l'addition, s'il vous
pla&icirc;t."</p>

<p>The waiter stared at him a moment with courteous, slightly
pained astonishment, then smiled apologetically, shrugged his
shoulders slightly in a movement of defeat, and saying, "Bien,
monsieur," took the ten-franc note upon the table, counted the
racked saucers, and made change for him.</p>

<p>When the waiter had gone, he sat for a moment staring at the
trees. It was in the month of April, it was night, he was alone
on the caf&eacute; terrace, and yet the chill air was touched
with a fragrance that was soft, thrilling and mysterious--a
citrous fume, the smell of unknown flowers, or perhaps not even
this--but only the ghost of a perfume, the thrilling, barren, and
strangely seductive odour of Provence.</p>

<p>It was a street in the little town of Arles, at night--an old,
worn, rutted, curiously dirty-looking street, haunted by the
trunks of immense and dusty-looking trees. He had never been here
before, the scene was strange and haunting as a dream, and yet it
was instantly and intolerably familiar. It was, somehow, he
thought, like a street he had been to in some small town in the
hot South at the faded end of summer--a South Carolina town, he
thought it must be, and he was sure that he would hear the sound
of familiar, unknown voices, the passing of feet, the rustling of
quiet, tired leaves. And then he saw again how strange it was,
and could see the tired waiter racking chairs and tables for the
night, and in the caf&eacute; tired lights and emptiness, and the
white, tired light upon the old dusty street, the huge haunting
boles of the great trees; and he knew that he had never been
along that way before.</p>

<p>Then he got up and walked away, and put his hand upon the
trunk of one of the old trees: it was white and felt smooth to
the touch, and was somewhat like the sycamores at home--and yet
it was not this that haunted him with troubling memory. He felt,
intolerably, that the place, the scene, the great wreathed
branches of the trees, were something he had seen before--that he
had seen it here from the same spot where now he sat--but
<i>when, when, when?</i></p>

<p>And suddenly, with a thrill of recognition that flashed across
his brain like an electric spark, he saw that he was looking at
the same trees that Van Gogh had painted in his picture of the
roadmenders at their work in Arles, that the scene was the same,
that he was sitting where the painter had sat before. And he
noted that the trees had tall, straight, symmetrical trunks, and
remembered that the trees that Vincent had painted had great,
tendoned trunks that writhed and twisted like creatures in a
dream--and yet were somehow more true than truth, more real than
this reality. And the great vinelike trunks of these demented
trees had wound and rooted in his heart, so that now he could not
forget them, nor see this scene in any other way than that in
which Van Gogh had painted it.</p>

<p>When he got up, the waiter was still racking chairs upon the
tables, and the white and quiet light from the caf&eacute; fell
like a tired stillness on the dusty street, and he walked away,
haunted by unfathomed memories of home, and with something in his
heart he could not utter.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>In all the dreams and visions that now swarmed across his
sleep, dreams and visions which can only be described as haunted
fatally by the sense of time--his mind seemed to exercise the
same complete control it ever had shown in all the operations of
its conscious memory. He slept, and knew he slept, and saw the
whole vast structure of the sleeping world about him as he slept;
he dreamed, and knew he dreamed, and like a sorcerer, drew upward
at his will, out of dark deeps and blue immensities of sleep, the
strange, dark fish of his imagining.</p>

<p>Sometimes they came with elvish flakings of a hoary light,
sometimes they came like magic and the promise of immortal joy;
they came with victory and singing and a shout of triumph in his
blood, and again he felt the strange and deathless joy of
voyages: he was a passenger upon great ships again, he walked the
broad, scrubbed decks exultantly, and smelled the hot, tarred
roofs of powerful and ugly piers; he smelled the spermy sea-wrack
of the harbour once again, the wastes of oil, the sharp, acrid
and exultant smoke from busy little tugs, the odour of old, worn
plankings, drenched with sunlight, and the thousand strange
compacted spices of the laden piers. Again he felt the gold and
sapphire loveliness of a Saturday in May, and drank the glory of
the earth into his heart, and heard in lucent and lyrical air the
heavy shattering "baugh" of the great ship's whistle, as it spoke
gloriously, of springtime, new lands and departure. Again he saw
ten thousand faces, touched with their strange admixture of
sorrow and joy, swarm past the openings of the pier, and again he
saw the flashing tides that girdled the city, whitened around the
prows of a hundred boats and gleaming with a million iridescent
points of light. Again the great walled cliff, the crowded isle,
the fabulous spires and ramparts of the city, as delicate as the
hues of light that flashed around them, slid away from him, and
one by one, the great ships, with the proud sweep of their
breasts of white, their opulent storeyed superstructure, their
music of power and speed, fell into line at noon on Saturday. And
now, like bridled horses held in leash, with princely chafe and
curvetings, they breach the mighty harbour, nose the narrows,
circle slowly to brief pauses at the pilot's boat, and then, like
racers set loose from the barriers, they are sent away, their
engines tremble to a mighty stroke, the ships are given to the
sea, to solitude, and to their proper glory once more.</p>

<p>And again he walked the decks, he walked the decks alone, and
saw the glittering sea-flung city melt within his sight, and
watched the sandy edges of the land fade away, and felt the
incredible gold and sapphire glory of the day, the sparkle of
dancing waters, and smelled salt, seaborne air again, and saw
upon the decks the joyful and exultant faces of the passengers,
their looks of wonder, hope, and speculation, as they looked into
the faces of strange men and women, now by the miracle of the
voyage and chance isled with them in the loneliness of water,
upon the glorious prison of a ship. And again he saw the faces of
the lovely women, and saw the lights of love and passion in their
eyes, and again he felt the plangent and depthless undulance, the
unforgettable feeling of the fathomless might of the sea beneath
a ship; a wild cry was torn from his throat, and a thousand
unutterable feelings of the voyage, of white coasts and sparkling
harbours and the creaking, eerie cries of gulls, of the dear,
green dwelling of the earth again, and of strange, golden cities,
potent wines, delicious foods, of women, love, and amber thighs
spread amorously in ripe golden hay, of discovery and new lands,
welled up in him like deathless song and certitude.</p>

<p>But just as these visions of delight and joy thronged upward
through the deep marine of sleep, so, by the same fiat, the same
calm order of an imperial will, the visions of a depthless shame,
a faceless abomination of horror, an indefinable and impalpable
corruption, returned to haunt his brain with their sentences of
inexpiable guilt and ruin: under their evil spell he lay tranced
upon his bed in a hypnosis of acquiescent horror, in a willing
suspension of all his forces of resistance, like some creature
held captive before the hypnotic rhythm of a reptile's head, the
dull, envenomed fascination of its eye.</p>

<p>He moved on ceaselessly across a naked and accursed landscape
and beneath a naked and accursed sky, an exile in the centre of a
planetary vacancy that, like his guilt and shame, had neither
place among things living nor among things dead, in which there
was neither vengeance of lightning nor mercy of burial, in which
there was neither shade nor shelter, curve nor bend, nor hill,
nor tree, nor hollow, in which--earth, air, sky, and limitless
horizon--there was only one vast naked eye, inscrutable and
accusing, from which there was no escape, and which bathed his
naked soul in its fathomless depths of shame.</p>

<p>And then the vision faded, and suddenly, with the bridgeless
immediacy of a dream, he found himself within the narrow canyon
of a street, pacing interminably along on endless pavements where
there was neither face nor footfall save his own, nor eye, nor
window, nor any door that he might enter.</p>

<p>He thought he was walking through the harsh and endless
continuity of one of those brown stone streets of which most of
the city was constructed fifty years ago, and of which great
broken lengths and fragments still remain. These streets, even if
visited by someone in his waking hours, by some stranger in the
fullness of health and sanity, and under the living and practical
light of noon or, more particularly, by some man stunned with
drink, who came there at some desolate and empty hour of night,
might have a kind of cataleptic horror, a visionary unreality, as
if some great maniac of architecture had conceived and shaped the
first harsh, ugly pattern of brown angularity, and then repeated
it, without a change, into the infinity of illimitable
repetition, with the mad and measureless insistence of an idiotic
monotony.</p>

<p>And for ever he walked the street, under the brown and fatal
light that fell upon him. He walked the street, and looked for a
house there that was his own, for a door he knew that he must
enter, for someone who was waiting for him in the house, and for
the merciful dark wall and door that would hide and shelter him
from the immense and naked eye of shame that peered upon him
constantly. For ever he walked the street and searched the bleak,
untelling fa&ccedil;ades for the house he knew and had forgotten;
for ever he prowled along before the endless and unchanging
fa&ccedil;ades of the street, and he never found it, and at
length he became aware of a vast sibilant whispering, of an
immense conspiracy of subdued and obscene laughter, and of the
mockery of a thousand evil eyes that peered in silence from these
bleak fa&ccedil;ades, and that he could never find or see; and
for ever he walked the streets alone and heard the immense and
secret whisperings and laughter, and was bathed in the bottomless
depths of a wordless shame, and could never find the house he had
lost, the door he had forgotten.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>He was sitting in Marseilles, at a table on the terrace of a
caf&eacute; on La Canebi&egrave;re, when he saw them. Suddenly,
above the rapid and vociferous animation of the caf&eacute;
crowd, he heard Starwick's strangely timbred voice, and turning,
saw them seated at a table not a dozen feet away. Starwick had
just turned to Elinor and was saying something quietly, in his
tone of grave yet casual seriousness that often introduced his
drolleries, and then he could see Starwick's ruddy face suffuse
and deepen with his laughter, and Elinor's heavy shoulders begin
to tremble, and then heard her shriek of high, astounded, and
protesting merriment. Ann was seated listening, dark, silent,
sullenly intent, with one long, slender hand resting upon the
neck of the big dog who crouched quietly beside her, and suddenly
her dark and sullen face was lighted by its rare and radiant
smile that gave her features the instant configuration of noble
beauty.</p>

<p>The world rocked before him as if shattered by the force of an
explosion: all the life seemed to have been blown out of him, and
he sat there staring at them, blind, numb, hollow, emptied to a
shell, and conscious of only one sensation--a kind of horrible
fear that they would turn and see him, a kind of horrible fear
that they would not. They did not turn or notice him: completely
absorbed in one another, it seemed to him that they had forgotten
him as completely as if they had never known him, and he was
suddenly stabbed with a horrible chagrin at sight of their free
gaiety, a bitter anguish of despair because of the triumph of
their laughter. Then he was conscious of a single, blind and
overpowering desire--to get away from them, to get away unseen,
to get away somewhere--anywhere--so long as he could escape the
agony of meeting, the naked shame of revelation. He signalled to
a waiter, paid his bill, and quickly made his way out among the
tables into the noisy crowd that thronged for ever past upon the
pavement. He set his face blindly away from them and plunged
ahead: it seemed to him that he could hear Starwick's shout of
recognition, his voice calling to him above the thousand mixed
vociferations of the crowd--and like a man pursued by devils, he
set his head down blindly and fled.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>His life had passed into a state which, if not insane, was
distinguished from insanity chiefly by a kind of quiescent
understanding which surveyed the passage of time and his own
actions with the powerless detachment of a spectator in a dream.
Now, after this encounter with his three lost friends, even this
sense of valuation was taken from him. In the weeks that followed
he was caught in a spell of time in which his life passed in a
kind of evil dream, and later he was no more able to recall what
he had done, how he had lived, where he had gone during this
period, than if he had been the subject of a powerful and
complete hypnosis. He was only vaguely conscious of what had
happened, he felt a numb sense of horrible catastrophe, such as a
drowning man might feel, or an an&aelig;sthetized patient who is
bleeding to death under the surgeon's knife. He had a blind
consciousness that some central governance of his life and reason
had been exploded, that he was spinning down out of control like
a shattered aeroplane--and that there was nothing he could do to
save himself, that he could not get control again, that he could
not "get back."</p>

<p>He lost the time-sense utterly--and it was his consciousness
of this that filled him with numb terror. He would return to his
room at night telling himself that he must work, then sleep, then
rise by day and work again, and suddenly his room would be filled
with light, the street below his window would be loud with all
the noisy business of noon, and he would be seated at his table,
with no knowledge how the time had passed.</p>

<p>He was now haunted constantly by a sense of the overwhelming
nearness of his three lost friends. This feeling, indeed, would
become so overpowering that at times the living presences of
Starwick, Elinor, and Ann seemed invisibly to be with him, beside
him. And the knowledge that they were here--for his conviction
had become the obsession of an unshakable belief--seemed to give
to the strange and sinister life of the evil and mysterious city
an unutterable magic, to infect the very air he breathed with an
intolerable anguish and delight. His whole life--heart and mind
and spirit, and every nerve and sense and sinew of his body--was
now passionately, indefatigably on the search for them. If he
slept, it only brought to him an unbelievable ecstasy, an
unbearable pain.</p>

<p>When he went out into the streets now it was only with the
thought that he would find them--with an overwhelming conviction
of his impending meeting with them. It seemed to him that every
step he took was bringing him nearer to them, that he would meet
them face to face around every corner that he turned--and this
knowledge palsied his flesh with excitement, joy, and terror.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>The two priests had finished eating, and provided with small
cups of black coffee and small glasses of green Chartreuse, they
had settled back against the wall to enjoy in relaxed comfort the
peace that passeth understanding. Both of the priests were
Franciscans, they were on their way to Rome for the Holy Year,
and apparently they had come well bestowed. Beside their table a
frosty silver bucket, over the rim of which floated the gold
necks of two empty champagne bottles, gave evidence of a meal
from which nothing had been lacking. A waiter brought a box of
Coronas and offered them prayerfully. The priests selected their
cigars with an appeased and drowsy air: they bit the ends and
grunted slightly at the flame the waiter offered them; then
collapsing slowly against the cushioned wall, they meditated the
ceiling in silence for several minutes through a blue, fragrant
mist of dreamful ease.</p>

<p>It was a fine evening towards the end of May, and the two
priests were in the best place to observe it. They had the first
table on the right as you entered the caf&eacute;, and at this
season of the year there was no door: the front was open. Just
outside, the priests could see all the gaily painted little
chairs and tables of the terrace, which was empty, and just
beyond, the sidewalk and the Avenue de la Victoire, the chief
thoroughfare of Nice. The street itself was quiet: from time to
time a motor car flashed past or an old nag with clopping hooves,
pulling a dilapidated-looking victoria and urged on by a driver
hunting for a fare. The trees along the street were in their full
green leaf now and the air was sweet with the smell of the trees,
the fragrance of earth and gardens and of unknown flowers. From
time to time people came by with the strolling movement which a
fine evening of this sort always seems to induce; and sometimes
there would be young couples, lovers with arms around each
other's waists, the women walking with a movement of voluptuous
and languorous appeasement as if they were just coming from the
act of love. But probably all they felt was the sensuous mystery,
beauty and fragrance of the night, the smell of the trees and the
earth and the flowers, which seemed to impregnate the whole
continent of dark with the thrilling promises of desire almost
made palpable, of unknown joys about to be realized.</p>

<p>It was a wonderfully seductive scene that opened from the
entrance of the caf&eacute;, and all the more exciting because of
its homely familiarity, its small framed limits into which life
passed briefly with a ring of jaunting hooves, a sudden casual
nearness and loudness of passing voices, and then--the fading and
lonely recession of these homely sounds, a woman's burst of low
and sensual laughter in the dark, the far-off dying-out of
jaunting hooves--and silence.</p>

<p>The two priests missed nothing of the quiet scene: they drank
it in with the air of men who have eaten nobly and who, fumed to
contentment with the drugs of good tobacco and an old liqueur,
are enormously pleased with life.</p>

<p>They were a strangely sorted pair and, once seen, would never
be forgotten. The larger of the two was a huge tub and belly of a
man, a kind of mammoth creature out of Rabelais, whose great moon
of face flared fiercely, from the excess of his eating and his
drinking. His fat neck and triple chin exuded over the neck-band
of his robe, so that the garment he wore seemed to be stained and
larded with the man's own grease. Everything about the great
priest cried out with swingeing openness: his whole nature seemed
to be permeated by a good humour so mountainously all-engulfing
that nothing in the world could stop it: the huge red face would
swell, suffuse, and purple with its choking laughter, the whole
huge torso--the shoulders, arms and breast, and the great heaving
belly--would shake and tremble like a hogshead full of jelly. And
so far was he from being troubled by a thought of judgment, by
fear of censure or the world's reproving eye, that the sight of a
shocked or unconceding face was enough to send him off in a
renewed paroxysm of volcanic mirth. There was no concealment in
the man, there was even a kind of mountainously good-natured
contempt for what the world might say or think of him, and for
this reason his association with his fellow-priest was all the
more grotesquely humorous--a humour which was certainly not lost
on this great modern Friar John of the Funnels, but which he
relished to the full. For, by contrast to this great flaring,
heaving, roaring, full moon of a man, it would be impossible to
imagine a more cautious and hypocritical figure than the other
priest cut. The second priest was a little man with a grey,
bleak, meagre and incredibly sly kind of face in which his native
caution and fear of self-exposure were constantly waging a
grotesque and open warfare with the sly, cunning, avaricious
greed and sensual desire obscenely legible in his countenance. At
the present moment this tormented struggle between lust and
caution was comically evident: the fellow's face was a grotesque
painting of desire, and his furtive little eyes kept darting
around in his head like rodents' and he peered slyly right and
left all round the caf&eacute; to see if anyone had noticed the
naked exposure of his passions. The reason for his confusion, the
very sight of which set his huge companion off in great
breast-and belly-heavings of tremendous laughter, was not hard to
find: at the table next to the two priests were seated two comely
young prostitutes, who had ogled and enticed the two holy men all
through the evening and whose seductive cajoleries, encouraged by
the great priest's explosions of mountainous belly-gushing
laughter, had now become naked, open, and outrageous. The little
fellow was in a cold, grey sweat of fear and longing: afraid to
look at the two women, he could yet hardly keep his eyes off
them; and terrified lest his conduct be observed and followed, he
was nevertheless unable to conceal the feverish eagerness of
desire which held him fascinated in a kind of trance.</p>

<p>So the indecent comedy proceeded: the two women, emboldened by
the huge priest's mountainous heavings of laughter, passed
swiftly from flirtatious raillery to proposals of a more serious
character: at the end, something certain, swift and serious
passed between the women and the huge fat priest: one of them
spoke to him in a low hoarse tone, he lowered his great moon of
face a trifle, and without looking at her, answered. In a moment
the two girls rose with an elaborate casualness, the priest paid
their bill, and the women sauntered out, turned left, moved
slowly towards the corner and, crossing to the other side,
advanced a few yards down the quiet intersecting street, where
they paused and turned, waiting, in the obscuring shadow of a
tree.</p>

<p>In a moment the huge priest called for the bill, paid it,
tipped the waiter generously, and rising with a mountainous
grunt, deliberately launched his huge bulk towards the street,
closely followed by the sly and terror-stricken figure of the
little priest. Outside the caf&eacute; the great priest paused
deliberately, looking both ways with a kind of huge and rotund
benevolence; then turning left in the direction the girls had
gone, he set out again in leisurely, unperturbed pursuit. And the
little priest trotted along beside him like a frightened puppy
beside an elephant; in every step, in every stride and movement
that they made, the separate characters of the two men were
grotesquely and powerfully evident. The huge priest barged along
with a tremendous and deliberate majesty, swinging his great
belly right and left before him as an elephant swings its trunk,
and magnificently indifferent to what anyone might think or say.
But the little man trotted along in a state bordering on terror;
he tried desperately to look casual and unconcerned, but his
shifting eyes darted furtive glances right and left, and beneath
the hem of his rough gown his sandalled feet kept slatting up and
down in a movement that was somehow comically sly and that
revealed the man's whole character. At the corner the big priest
paused deliberately again, turned, surveyed the scene and then,
espying the white of the girls' dresses below the trees across
the street, set out in deliberate pursuit. And the little priest
trotted along beside, his head lowered, his eyes darting furtive
glances right and left, his sandalled feet slatting slyly up and
down. Then they caught up with the girls below the trees and,
half obscured in darkness, they stood for a moment talking in low
voices. Then each of the girls took one of the priests by the arm
and they all walked off together down the street and soon were
lost in leafy darkness and the mystery of the night. Then the
waiter, who had served the priests and who, standing in the
entrance, had observed the meeting across the street, turned and,
glaring at the youth, said quietly:</p>

<p>"C'est tres joli, eh? . . . Moi," he continued, after a brief
pause, "je n'ai pas le sentiment religieux." And having delivered
himself without rancour or surprise of that devastating
statement, he dismissed the subject from his mind completely and,
turning to the table that the priests had left, he racked the
saucers up and wiped the table clean.</p>

<p>From a distance there came suddenly a woman's low, rich burst
of sensual laughter, the receding hoof-beats of a horse, and then
all around there was silence, the overpowering fragrance of the
earth, the huge thrill and mystery of night, and the sense of an
intolerable desire, close and palpable and lovely, and never to
be grasped or found: and from the huge and haunting familiarity
of all these things a thousand receding and unuttered memories of
time arose, a feeling of bitter loss, wild joy and pain--of a
door that closed, a cloud-shadow that had gone for ever. He
thought of home.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Among the dreams that returned to haunt his waking, watchful
sleep during the strange, living vision of that green spring, as
he lay hearted at the pulse of time, there was one which remained
ever after in his memory.</p>

<p>He was striding along a wide and sandy beach and by the side
of a calm and tranquilly flowing sea. The waves broke quietly and
evenly in a long, low roll upon the beach, rushing up the sand in
small hissing eddies of foam and water. Below his feet the firm,
brown sand sprang back with an elastic vitality, a warm and vital
wind was blowing, and he drew into his lungs exultantly the smell
of the sea and of the warm, wet, fragrant beach, ribbed evenly
with braided edges of brown seaweed.</p>

<p>He did not recognize the scene as one which he had ever
visited before, and yet he felt an instant and complete
familiarity with it, as if he had known it for ever. Behind him,
drumming evenly upon the hard, elastic sand, and fading away into
the distance with a hard, wooden thunder of wheels, he heard the
furious rhythm of pounding hooves of driven horses. He knew that
he had just descended from a ship and that he was living in one
of the antique and early ages of the earth; and all of this he
knew with joy and wonder, and without surprise, with the thrill
of recovering something he had always known and had lost for
ever.</p>

<p>It was a scene out of the classic period of the earth, and yet
it was wholly different from every image he had ever had about
this earth in his imagination. For where, in every vision of his
mind and reading, that earth had come to him in a few sharp and
radiant colours, in a structure of life as glowing and
proportionate as one of its faultless temples, as remote from the
world he lived in as all its fables, myths, and legends, this
earth he now walked on was permeated with the living tones and
weathers of life.</p>

<p>The world of Homer was the world of first light, sunlight, and
of morning: the sea was wine-dark, a gold and sapphire purity of
light fell on the walls of Troy, a lucent depthless purity of
light welled from the eyes of Helen, as false, fatal, and
innocently corrupt a woman as ever wrought destruction on the
earth. The light that fell on Nausicaa and her maidens was all
gold and crystal like the stream they bathed in, as lucent in
purity as their limbs, as radiant as joy and morning on the
earth; and even the lights of vengeance and the rout of the dread
furies that fell upon the doomed and driven figure of Orestes
were as fatal as blood, as relentless as an antique tragedy, as
toneless as a destiny.</p>

<p>And in his pictures of a later time, of Athens in the period
of recorded history, of Pericles and Plato and the time of the
wars with Sparta, the scenes of history were bathed in these
radiant and perfect lights and weathers. He knew these men were
made of living, breathing flesh and subject to the errors and
imperfections of mortal men, and yet when he tried to think of a
slum in Athens, of people with bad teeth, blemished skins, muddy
complexions--of disease, filth, and squalor among them, and of
the million weary, beaten, dusty, sweating moments of their
lives, he could not. Even human grief, pain, and trouble took on
a colour of classical perfection, of tragic grandeur, and the
tortured and distressful skein of human life, with all that is
ugly, trivial, and disgusting in it, took on the logical pattern
of design and ordered destiny.</p>

<p>The light that fell upon them was of gold and sapphire, and of
singing, or as ominous and fatal as a certain and inexorable
doom; but now he walked this beach in one of the classical
periods of the earth, and nothing was as he had tried to picture
it, and yet all was as familiar as if he had known it for
ever.</p>

<p>There was no gold and sapphire in the air: it was warm and
sultry, omened with some troubling, variable and exultant menace,
fraught with the sulphurous promise of a storm, pregnant with
mystery and discovery, touched with a hundred disturbing elements
and weathers of man's soul, and scented with a thousand warm and
spermy odours of the land and sea, that touched man's entrails
with delight and prophecy.</p>

<p>And the sea also was neither lyrical with gold and blue nor
wine-dark in its single harmony: the sea was dark and sultry as
the sky that bent above it, murked greenly, thickly, milkily, as
it rolled quietly and broke upon the beach, as omened with
impalpable prophecy as the earth and air.</p>

<p>He did not know the reason for his being there, and yet he
knew beyond a doubt that he had come there for a purpose, that
someone was waiting for him there, that the greatest joy and
triumph he had ever known was impending in this glorious
meeting.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>That year, in June, he was sitting one day at a table before a
little caf&eacute; that looked out across a quiet, cobbled square
in the ancient city of Dijon. He was on his way to Paris from
Italy and Switzerland and he had stopped here on impulse,
remembering that the town was the capital of the old kingdom of
Burgundy--a name which, in some way, since childhood, had
flourished in his mind with a green magic, evoking images of a
fair, green country, noble wine and food, a golden, drowsy
legendry of old wars and heroes, women, gallantry, and knightly
acts.</p>

<p>And he had not been disappointed. The old town with its
ancient palaces--the worn and age-grimed fa&ccedil;ades of a
forgotten power, a storeyed architecture--and the fair, green
earth, the deep, familiar green of the intimate and yet enchanted
hills, awoke in him all the old drowsy gold of legendry, the
promise of a fair and enfabled domain, fat with plenty.</p>

<p>He had been here three days now, flooded with living green and
gold, a willing captive in the spell of time, drinking the
noblest wine, eating some of the noblest cookery he had ever
known. After the dull Swiss food, the food and wine of Burgundy
were good beyond belief; and everything--old town, the fair,
green country and the hills--made a music in him again which was
like all the green-gold magic of his childhood's dream of
France.</p>

<p>Now he sat there at a table before a little caf&eacute;,
already meditating with slow, lustful reverie his noonday meal at
an ancient, famous inn where for eighteen francs one was served a
stupendous meal--a succession of succulent native dishes such as
he had dreamed about but had never thought that he would find
outside of dreams or legends, in a town so small as this.</p>

<p>As he thought of this gourmet's heaven with a feeling of
wonder and disbelief, the memory of a hundred little towns and
cities in America returned to him, with the hideous and dyspeptic
memory of their foods--the greasy, rancid, sodden, stale, dead,
and weary foods of the Greek restaurants, of the luncheon rooms,
coffee shops and railway cafeterias--hastily bolted and washed
down to the inevitable miseries of dyspepsia with gulping
swallows of sour, weak coffee.</p>

<p>Yes, even the noble food and wine had made a magic in this
ancient place, and suddenly he was pierced again by the old
hunger that haunts and hurts Americans--the hunger for a better
life--an end of rawness, newness, sourness, distressful and
exacerbated misery, the taking from the great plantation of the
earth and of America our rich inheritance of splendour, ease, and
abundance--good food, and sensual love, and noble cookery--the
warmth of radiant colour and of wine--pulse of the blood--an end
of misery, bitterness, hunger and unrest upon the breast of
everlasting plenty--the inheritance of exultancy and joy for
ever, which some foul, corrosive poison in our lives--bitter
enigma that it is!--has taken from us.</p>

<p>Now, as he thought these things, sitting before the
caf&eacute; and looking across the quiet square of whitened
cobbles, a bell struck and noon came. Slowly a great clock began
to strike in the old town. In a cool, dark church, which he had
seen the day before, a bell-rope, knotted at the ends, hung down
before the altar-steps from an immense distance in the ceiling.
The moment the town bell had finished its deep reverberation, a
sexton walked noisily across the old flagged church-floor and
took the bell-cord in his hands. Slowly, with a gentle rhythm, he
began to swing upon the rope, and one could hear at first an old
and heavy creaking from the upper air, but as yet no bell.</p>

<p>Then the sexton's body stiffened in its rhythm, he hung hard
upon the knotted rope in punctual sway, and there began, far up
in the church, the upper air of that old place, a sweet and
ponderous beating of the bells. At first they beat in
threes--ding-dong-dong; ding-dong-dong; then swiftly the man
changed his rhythm, and the bells began to beat a faster double
measure.</p>

<p>And now the youth remembered old, distant chimes upon a street
at night; and the memory of his own bells came back into his
heart. He remembered the great bell at college that rang the boys
to classes, and how the knotted bell-rope came down into the room
of the student who rang it; and how often he had rung the bell
himself, and how at first there was the creaking noise in the
upper air of the bell-tower, there as here; and how, as the great
bell far above him swung into its rhythm, he would be carried off
the floor by that weight of thronging bronze; and he remembered
still the lift and power of the old college bell, as he swung at
the knotted rope, and the feeling of joy and power that surged up
in him as he was lifted on the mighty upward stroke, and heard
above him in the tower the dark music of the grand old bell and
the students running on the campus paths below the window, and
then the loose rope, the bell tolling brokenly away to silence,
the creaking sound again, and finally nothing but silence, the
day's green spell and golden magic of the drowsy campus in the
month of May.</p>

<p>And now the memory of that old bell, with all its host of
long-forgotten things, swarmed back with living and intolerable
pungency, as he sat there at noon in the old French town and
heard the sexton swinging on the bell of the old church.</p>

<p>He thought of home.</p>

<p>And now, with the sound of that old bell, everything around
him burst into instant life. Although the structure of that life
was foreign to him, and different from anything he had known as a
child, everything instantly became incredibly living, near, and
familiar, like something he had always known.</p>

<p>The little caf&eacute; before which he was sitting was old and
small, and had a warm, worn look of use and comfort. Inside, in
the cool, dark depth of the place, were two old men sitting at a
table playing cards--with a faded, green cloth upon the table;
and two waiters. One of the old men had long, pointed moustaches,
and a thin, distinguished face; the other was more ruddy and
full-fleshed and had a beard. They played quietly, bending over
the old, green cloth with studious deliberation, making each play
slowly. Sometimes they spoke quietly to each other, only a few
words at a time; sometimes the ruddy old man's thick shoulders
would heave and tremble, and his face would flush rosily with
satisfaction; but the other one laughed thinly, quietly, in a
more gentle, weary way.</p>

<p>The two waiters were polishing up the silverware and getting
the tables set and put in order for the midday meal. One of the
waiters was an old man with the sprouting, energetic moustaches
one sees so often in France, and with the weary, hawk-like,
cynical, yet not ill-natured face that one often sees on old
waiters. The other--really just a bus-boy--was a young, clumsy,
thick-fingered and thick-featured country lad, with the
wine-dark, vital, sanguinary colouring some Frenchmen have.</p>

<p>The young fellow was full of exuberant good spirits; he was
polishing up the knives and forks and spoons with enthusiastic
gusto, humming the snatches of a song as he did so, and slamming
each piece of silver down into a drawer with such vigour, when he
had finished, that it was obvious that he got great pleasure from
the musical jingle thus created.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the old waiter moved quietly, softly, and yet
wearily about, setting the tables. At length, however, at the end
of a particularly violent and enthusiastic jingle of silverware
from his polishing companion, he looked up, with a slight cynical
arching of his eyebrows, and then, without ill-nature but with
perfect urbanity, he said ironically:</p>

<p>"Ah! On fait la musique!"</p>

<p>This was all, but one saw the young fellow's face flush and
redden with exuberant laughter; his thick shoulders rose and for
a moment trembled convulsively, then he went on polishing,
singing to himself, and hurling the noisy silverware into the
drawer with more enthusiasm than ever.</p>

<p>And that brief, pleasant, and somehow poignantly unforgettable
scene now seemed, like everything else, to be intolerably near
and familiar to the youth, and something he had always known.</p>

<p>Before him the quiet, faded, strangely pleasant square was
waking briefly to its moment of noonday life. Far off he could
hear the little shrill fifing whistle of a French locomotive and
the sound of slow trains; an ice-wagon, with a tin interior and
large, delicately carved cakes of ice, clattered across the
cobbles of the square; and he remembered how he had seen, the day
before, some barge people eating on a barge beneath the trees.
From where he sat he could see workmen, wearing shapeless caps
and baggy corduroy trousers streaked with lime and cement, and
talking in hoarse, loud, disputatious voices as they leaned above
their drinks on the zinc bar of a little bistro on the
corner.</p>

<p>Some young, dull-looking women, wearing light-coloured
stockings and light, grey-tannish overcoats, came by, with
domesticity written in every movement that they made, looking,
somehow, their wedded propriety and the stern dullness of
provincial places everywhere.</p>

<p>And then the lost, the irrevocable, the lonely sounds which he
had not heard for fifteen years awoke there in the square, and
suddenly he was a child, and it was noon, and he was waiting in
his father's house to hear the slam of the iron gate, the great
body stride up the high porch steps, knowing his father had come
home again.</p>

<p>At first, before him, in that little whitened square, it was
just the thring of the bicycle bells, the bounding of the
light-wired wheels. And at first he could see some French army
officers riding home upon their bicycles. They were proper and
assured-looking men, with solid, wine-dark faces, and they rode
solidly and well, driving the light-wired wheels beneath them
with firm propulsions of their solid legs.</p>

<p>Then, with a thring of bells, an army sergeant came by, riding
fast and smoothly on his way home to dinner. And then, with
sudden rush, the thring of bells, the thrum of wheels increased:
the clerks, the bank clerks, the bookkeepers--the little proper
and respectable people of all sorts--were riding home across the
quiet little square at noon.</p>

<p>On the other side of the square he could see two workmen who
were still at work upon a piece of stone; one was holding an iron
spike and one a sledge, and they worked slowly, with frequent
pauses.</p>

<p>A young buck, with a noisy, sporty little car, sped over the
square and vanished; and the youth wondered if he was one of the
daring blades of Dijon, and what young women of the town's best
families he had taken out in the car, and if he boasted to other
young town blades in caf&eacute;s of his prowess at seduction, as
did the bucks before Wood's Pharmacy at home.</p>

<p>Then for a moment there was a brooding silence in the square
again, and presently there began the most lonely, lost and
unforgettable of all sounds on earth--the solid, liquid
leather-shuffle of footsteps going home one way, as men had done
when they came home to lunch at noon some twenty years ago, in
the green-gold and summer magic of full June, before he had seen
his father's land, and when the kingdoms of this earth and the
enchanted city still blazed there in the legendary magic of his
boyhood's vision.</p>

<p>They came with solid, lonely, liquid shuffle of their decent
leather, going home, the merchants, workers, and good citizens of
that old town of Dijon. They streamed across the cobbles of that
little square; they passed, and vanished, and were gone for
ever--leaving silence, the brooding hush and apathy of noon, a
suddenly living and intolerable memory, instant and familiar as
all this life around him, of a life that he had lost, and that
could never die.</p>

<p>It was the life of twenty years ago in the quiet, leafy
streets and little towns of lost America--of an America that had
been lost beneath the savage roar of its machinery, the brutal
stupefaction of its days, the huge disease of its furious,
ever-quickening and incurable unrest, its flood-tide horror of
grey, driven faces, stolid eyes, starved, brutal nerves, and
dull, dead flesh.</p>

<p>The memory of the lost America--the America of twenty years
ago, of quiet streets, the time-enchanted spell and magic of full
June, the solid, lonely, liquid shuffle of men in shirt-sleeves
coming home, the leafy fragrance of the cooling turnip-greens,
and screens that slammed, and sudden silence--had long since
died, had been drowned beneath the brutal flood-tide, the edict
stupefaction of that roaring surge and mechanical life which had
succeeded it.</p>

<p>And now, all that lost magic had come to life again here in
the little whitened square, here in this old French town, and he
was closer to his childhood and his father's life of power and
magnificence than he could ever be again in savage new America;
and as the knowledge of these strange, these lost yet familiar
things returned to him, his heart was filled with all the mystery
of time, dark time, the mystery of strange, million-visaged time
that haunts us with the briefness of our days.</p>

<p>He thought of home.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Immense and sudden, and with the abrupt nearness, the
telescopic magic of a dream, the English ship appeared upon the
coasts of France, and approached with the strange, looming
immediacy of powerful and gigantic objects that move at great
speed: there was no sense of continuous movement, of gradual and
progressive enlargement, rather the visages of the ship melted
rapidly from one bigness to another as do the visages of men in a
cinema, which, by a series of fading sizes, brings these
kinematic shapes of things, like genii unstoppered from a
wizard's bottle, to an overpowering command above the
spectator.</p>

<p>At first there was only the calm endlessness of the evening
sea, the worn headlands of Europe, and the land, with its rich,
green slopes, its striped patterns of minutely cultivated earth,
its ancient fortresses and its town--the town of
Cherbourg--which, from this distance, lay like a sold pattern of
old chalk at the base of the coastal indentation.</p>

<p>Westward, a little to the south, against the darkening bulk of
the headland, a long riband of smoke, black and low, told the
position of the ship. She was approaching fast, her bulk widened:
she had been a dot, a smudge, a shape--a tiny, hardly noticed
point in the calm and immense geography of evening. Now she was
there, sliding gently in beyond the ancient breakwater,
inhabiting and dominating the universe with the presence of her
60,000 tons, so that the vast setting of sky and sea and earth,
in which formerly she had been only an inconspicuous but living
mark, were now a background for her magnificence.</p>

<p>At this very moment of her arrival the sun rested upon the
western wave like a fading coal: its ancient light fell over sea
and land without violence or heat, with a remote, unearthly glow
that had the delicate tinging of old bronze. Then, swiftly, the
sun sank down into the sea, the uninhabited sky now burned with a
fierce, an almost unbearable glory; the sun's old light had
faded; and the ship was there outside the harbour, sliding softly
through the water now, and quartering, in slow turn, upon the
land as she came up for anchor.</p>

<p>The sheer wall of her iron plates scarcely seemed to move at
all now in the water; it was as if she were fixed and foundered
there among the tides, as implacable as the headlands of the
coast; yet, over her solid bows the land was wheeling slowly.
Water foamed noisily from her sides in thick, tumbling columns:
the sea-gulls swarmed around her, fluttering greedily and heavily
to the water with their creaking and unearthly clamour. Then her
anchors rushed out of her and she stood still.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the tenders, bearing the passengers who were going
to board the ship, had put out from the town even before the
ship's arrival and were now quite near. They had, in fact,
cruised slowly for some time about the outer harbour, for the
ship was late and the commander had wirelessed asking that there
be as little delay as possible when he arrived.</p>

<p>Now the light faded on the land: the fierce, hard brilliance
of the western sky, full of bright gold and ragged flame, had
melted to an orange afterglow, the subtle, grapy bloom of dusk
was melting across the land; the town, far off, was half immersed
in it, its moving shadow stole across the fields and slopes, it
moved upon the waters like a weft. Above the land the sky was yet
full of light--of that strange, phantasmal light of evening which
reveals itself to people standing in the dusk below without
touching them with any of its radiance: the material and physical
property of light seems to have been withdrawn from it, and it
remains briefly in the sky, without substance or any living
power, like the ghost of light, its soul, its spirit.</p>

<p>In these late skies of France, this late, evening light of
waning summer had in it a quality that was high and sad, remote
and full of classic repose and dignity. Beneath it, it was as if
one saw people grave and beautiful move slowly homeward through
long avenues of planted trees: the light was soft, lucent,
delicately empearled--and all great labour was over, all strong
joy and hate and love had ended, all wild desire and hope, all
maddening of the flesh and heart and brain, the fever and the
tumult and the fret; and the grave-eyed women in long robes
walked slowly with cut flowers in their arms among the glades of
trees, and night had come, and they would go to the wood no
more.</p>

<p>Now, in this light, all over the land of France the men were
coming from the fields: they had used preciously the last light
of day, summer was almost over, the fields were mown, the hay was
raked and stacked, and in a thousand places, along the Rhine, and
along the Marne, in Burgundy, in Touraine, in Provence, the wains
were lumbering slowly down the roads.</p>

<p>In the larger towns the nervous and swarming activity of
evening had begun: the terraces of the caf&eacute;s were
uncomfortably crowded with noisy people, the pavements were
thronged with a chattering and gesticulating tide, the streets
were loud with traffic, the clatter of trams, the heavy grinding
of buses, the spiteful little horns of innumerable small taxis.
But over all, over the opulence of the mown fields and the untidy
and distressful throngings of the towns, hung this high, sad
light of evening.</p>

<p>A stranger, a visitor from some newer and more exultant
earth--an American, perhaps--had he seen this coast thus for the
first time, might have imagined the land as inhabited by a race
far different from the one that really lived here: he would have
felt the opulent austerity of this earth under its dying light,
and he would have been deeply troubled by it.</p>

<p>For such a visitor, disturbed by the profound and subtle
melancholy of this scene, for which his own experience had given
him no adequate understanding or preparation, because it was
steeped in peace without hope, in beauty without joy, in tranquil
and brooding resignation without exultancy, the sight of the
ship, as she lay now, immense and immovable at her anchor, would
have pierced him suddenly with a thrill of victory, a sudden
renewal of his faith and hope, a belief in the happy destiny of
life.</p>

<p>She lay there, an alien presence in those waters; she had the
reality of magic, the reality that is so living and magnificent
that it seems unreal. She was miraculous and true--as one looked
at her, settled like some magic luminosity upon that mournful
coast, a strong cry of exultancy rose up in one's throat: the
sight of the ship was as if a man's mistress had laid her hand
upon his loins.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>The ship was now wholly anchored: she lay there in the water
with the living stillness of all objects that were made to move.
Although entirely motionless, outwardly as fixed and permanent as
any of the headlands of the coast, the story of her power and
speed was legible in every line. She glowed and pulsed with the
dynamic secret of life, and although her great sides towered
immense and silent as a cliff, although the great plates of her
hull seemed to reach down and to be founded in the sea's bed, and
only the quietly flowing waters seemed to move and eddy softly at
her sides, she yet had legible upon her the story of a hundred
crossings, the memory of strange seas, of suns and moons and many
different lights, the approach of April on far coasts, the change
of wars and histories, and the completed dramas of all her
voyages, charactered by the phantoms of many thousand passengers,
the life, the hate, the love, the bitterness, the jealousy, the
intrigue of six-day worlds, each one complete and separate in
itself, which only a ship can have, which only the sea can bound,
which only the earth can begin or end.</p>

<p>She glowed with the radiance of all her brilliant and luminous
history; and besides this, she was literally a visitant from a
new world. The stranger from the new world who saw the ship would
also instantly have seen this. She had been built several years
after the war and was entirely a product of European
construction, engineering, navigation, and diplomacy. But her
spirit, the impulse that communicated itself in each of her
lines, was not European, but American. It is Europeans, for the
most part, who have constructed these great ships, but without
America they have no meaning. These ships are alive with the
supreme ecstasy of the modern world, which is the voyage to
America. There is no other experience that is remotely comparable
to it, in its sense of joy, its exultancy, its drunken and
magnificent hope which, against reason and knowledge, soars into
a heaven of fabulous conviction, which believes in the miracle
and sees it invariably achieved.</p>

<p>In this soft, this somewhat languid air, the ship glowed like
an immense and brilliant jewel. All of her lights were on, they
burned row by row straight across her 900 feet of length, with
the small, hard twinkle of cut gems: it was as if the vast, black
cliff of her hull, which strangely suggested the glittering
night-time cliff of the fabulous city that was her destination,
had been sown with diamonds.</p>

<p>And above this, her decks were ablaze with light. Her enormous
superstructure with its magnificent frontal sweep, her proud
breast which was so full of power and speed, her storeyed decks
and promenades as wide as city streets, the fabulous variety and
opulence of her public rooms, her vast lounges and salons, her
restaurants, grills, and caf&eacute;s, her libraries,
writing-rooms, ballrooms, swimming-pools, her imperial suites
with broad beds, private decks, sitting-rooms, gleaming
baths--all of this, made to move upon the stormy seas, leaning
against eternity and the grey welter of the Atlantic at
twenty-seven knots an hour, tenanted by the ghosts, impregnated
by the subtle perfumes of thousands of beautiful and expensive
women, alive with the memory of the silken undulance of their
long backs, with the naked, living velvet of their shoulders as
they paced down the decks at night--all of this, with the four
great funnels that in the immense drive and energy of their slant
were now cut sharp and dark against the evening sky, burned with
a fierce, exultant vitality in the soft melancholy of this
coast.</p>

<p>The ship struck joy into the spinal marrow. In her intense
reality she became fabulous, a visitant from another world, a
creature monstrous and magical with life, a stranger, seeming
strange, to these melancholy coasts, for she was made to glitter
in the hard, sharp air of a younger, more exultant land.</p>

<p>She was made also to quarter on the coasts of all the earth,
to range powerfully on the crest and ridge of the globe, sucking
continents towards her, devouring sea and land; she was made to
enter European skies like some stranger from another world, to
burn strangely and fabulously in the dull, grey air of Europe, to
pulse and glow under the soft, wet European sky. But she was only
a marvellous stranger there; she was a bright, jewelled thing;
she came definitely, indubitably, wonderfully from but one place
on earth, and in only that one place could she be fully seen and
understood, in only that one place could she slide in to her
appointed and imperial setting.</p>

<p>That place was America: that place was the reaches to the
American coast: that place was the approaches to the American
continent. That place, finally and absolutely, was the port
whither she was bound--the fabulous rock of life, the proud,
masted city of the soaring towers, which was flung with a lion's
port into the maw of ocean. And as the Americans who were now
approaching the ship in the puffing little tender saw this mark
upon her, they looked at her and knew her instantly; they felt a
qualm along their loins, their flesh stirred.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>"Oh, look!" cried a woman suddenly, pointing to the ship whose
immense and glittering side now towered over them. "Isn't that
lovely! God, but she's big! How do you suppose we're ever going
to find the ocean?"</p>

<p>"The first thing I'm going to do, darling, is find my bed,"
said her companion, in a tone of languorous weariness. A tall and
sensual-looking Jewess, she was seated on a pile of baggage,
smoking a cigarette, her long legs indolently crossed:
indifferently, with smouldering and arrogant glances, she
surveyed the crowd of passengers on the tender.</p>

<p>The other woman could not be still: her rosy face was burning
with the excitement of the voyage, she kept slipping the ring on
and off her finger nervously, and moving around at her brisk
little step among the heaped-up piles of baggage.</p>

<p>"Oh, here!" she cried out suddenly in great excitement,
pointing to a bag buried at the bottom of one of the piles. "Oh,
here!" she cried again to the general public. "This one's mine!
Where are the others? Can't you find the others for me?" she said
in a sharp, protesting voice to one of the porters, a little,
brawny man with sprouting moustaches. "Hey?" she said, lifting
her small hand complainingly to her ear as he answered her in a
torrent of reassuring French. She turned to her companion
protestingly:</p>

<p>"I can't get them to do anything. They don't pay a bit of
attention to what I say! I can't find my trunk and two of my
bags. I think it's the most dreadful thing I ever heard of. Don't
you? Hey?" again she lifted her little hand to her ear, for she
was somewhat deaf: her small, rosy face was crimson with
excitement and earnestness--in her tone, her manner, her
indignation, there was something irresistibly comic, and suddenly
her companion began to laugh.</p>

<p>"Oh, Esther!" she said. "Lord!" and then paused abruptly, as
if there were no more to say.</p>

<p>Esther was fair; she was fair; she had dove's eyes.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Now the woman's lovely face, like a rarer, richer, and more
luminous substance, was glowing among all the other faces of the
travellers, which, as the tender circled and came in close below
the ship, were fixed with a single intentness upon the great hull
that loomed over them with its overpowering immensity.</p>

<p>The great ship cast over them all her mighty spell: most of
these people had made many voyages, yet the great ship caught
them up again in her magic glow, she possessed and thrilled them
with her presence as if they had been children. The travellers
stood there silent and intent as the little boat slid in beside
the big one, they stood there with uplifted faces; and for a
moment it was strange and sad to see them thus, with loneliness
and longing in their eyes. Their faces made small, lifted
whitenesses; they shone in the gathering dark with a luminous
glimmer: there was something small, naked and lonely in the
glimmer of those faces, around them was the immense eternity of
sea and death. They heard time.</p>

<p>For if, as men be dying, they can pluck one moment from the
darkness into which their sense is sinking, if one moment in all
the dark and mysterious forest should then live, it might well be
the memory of such a moment as this which, although lacking in
logical meaning, burns for an instant in the dying memory as a
summary and a symbol of man's destiny on earth. The fading memory
has forgotten what was said then by the passengers, the thousand
tones and shadings of the living moment are forgotten, but
drenched in the strange, brown light of time, the scene glows
again for an instant with an intent silence: darkness has fallen
upon the eternal earth, the great ship like a monstrous visitant
blazes on the waters, and on the tender the faces of the
travellers are lifted up like flowers in a kind of rapt and
mournful ecstasy--they are weary of travel, they have wandered in
strange cities among strange tongues and faces, and they have
left not even the print of their foot in any town.</p>

<p>Their souls are naked and alone, and they are strangers upon
the earth, and many of them long for a place where those weary of
travel may find rest, where those who are tired of searching may
cease to search, where there will be peace and quiet living, and
no desire. Where shall the weary find peace? Upon what shore will
the wanderer come home at last? When shall it cease--the blind
groping, the false desires, the fruitless ambitions that grow
despicable as soon as they are reached, the vain contest with
phantoms, the maddening and agony of the brain and spirit in all
the rush and glare of living, the dusty tumult, the grinding, the
shouting, the idiotic repetition of the streets, the sterile
abundance, the sick gluttony, and the thirst which goes on
drinking?</p>

<p>Out of one darkness the travellers have come to be taken into
another, but for a moment one sees their faces, awful and still,
all uplifted towards the ship. This is all: their words have
vanished, all memory of the movements they made then has also
vanished: one remembers only their silence and their still faces
lifted in the phantasmal light of lost time; one sees them ever,
still and silent, as they slide from darkness on the river of
time; one sees them waiting at the ship's great side, all silent
and all damned to die, with their grave, white faces lifted in a
single supplication to the ship, and towards the silent row of
passengers along the deck, who for a moment return their gaze
with the same grave and tranquil stare. That silent meeting is a
summary of all the meetings of men's lives: in the silence one
hears the slow, sad breathing of humanity, one knows the human
destiny.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>"Oh, look!" the woman cried again. "Oh, see! Was ever anything
more beautiful?" The ship's great beetling cliff swept sheer
above her. She turned the small, flushed flower of her face and
saw the slant and reach and swell of the great prow, and music
filled her. She lifted the small, flushed flower of her face and
saw the many men so little, so lonely, silent, and intent, that
bent above her, looking from the ship's steep rail. She turned
and saw the people all around her, the swift weave and patterned
shifting of the forms, and she saw light then, ancient fading
light, that fell upon the coasts of evening, and quiet waters
reddened by fading day, and heard the unearthly creakings of a
gull; and wonder filled her. And the strange and mortal ache of
beauty, the anguish to pronounce what never could be spoken, to
grasp what never could be grasped, to hold and keep for ever what
was gone the moment she put her hand upon it--</p>

<p>"Oh, these people here," she cried in a high tone--"The ship!
. . . My God! the things that I could tell you all!" she cried
indignantly. "The things I know--the things I have inside me
here!"--she struck herself upon the breast with one clenched
hand--"the way things are, the way they happen, and the beauty of
the clear design--and no one ever asks me!" she cried out
indignantly. "This wonderful thing is going on inside me all the
time--and no one ever wants to know the way it happens!"--and
stood staring at her friend accusingly a moment, a little figure
of indignant loveliness until, becoming aware of people's smiles
and her companion's laughter, her own face was suddenly suffused,
and, casting back her head, she was swept with gale-like
merriment--a full, rich, woman's yell of triumph and delight.</p>

<p>And yet, even as she laughed, she was pierced again by the old
ache of wonder, the old anguish of unspoken desire, and saw the
many men, so lonely, silent, and intent, the ship immense and
sudden there above her in old evening light, and so--remembering,
"Canst thou draw out leviathan with an hook? or his tongue with a
cord which thou lettest down?"--was still with wonder.</p>

<p>Ah, strange and beautiful, the woman thought, how can I longer
bear this joy intolerable, the music of this great song
unpronounceable, the anguish of this glory unimaginable, which
fills my life to bursting and which will not let me speak! It is
too hard, too hard, and not to be endured, to feel the great vine
welling in my heart, the wild, strange music swelling in my
throat, the triumph of that final perfect song that aches for
ever there just at the gateway of my utterance--and that has no
tongue to speak! Oh, magic moments that are so perfect, unknown,
and inevitable, to stand here at this ship's great side, here at
the huge last edge of evening and return, with this still wonder
in my heart and knowing only that somehow we are fulfilled of
you, oh time! And see how gathered there against the rail high
over us, there at the ship's great side, are all the people,
silent, lonely, and so beautiful, strange brothers of this
voyage, chance phantoms of the bitter briefness of our days--and
you, oh youth--for now she saw him there for the first time--who
bend there, lone and lean and secret, at the rail of night, why
are you there alone while these, your fellows, wait? . . . Ah,
secret and alone, she thought--how lean with hunger, and how
fierce with pride, and how burning with impossible desire he
bends there at the rail of night--and he is wild and young and
foolish and forsaken, and his eyes are starved, his soul is
parched with thirst, his heart is famished with a hunger that
cannot be fed, and he leans there on the rail and dreams great
dreams, and he is mad for love and is athirst for glory, and he
is so cruelly mistaken--and so right! . . . Ah, see, she thought,
how that wild light flames there upon his brow--how bright, how
burning and how beautiful--Oh, passionate and proud!--how like
the wild, lost soul of youth you are, how like my wild lost
father who will not return!</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>He turned, and saw her then, and so finding her, was lost, and
so losing self, was found, and so seeing her, saw for a fading
moment only the pleasant image of the woman that perhaps she was,
and that life saw. He never knew: he only knew that from that
moment his spirit was impaled upon the knife of love. From that
moment on he never was again to lose her utterly, never to wholly
repossess unto himself the lonely, wild integrity of youth which
had been his. At that instant of their meeting, that proud
inviolability of youth was broken, not to be restored. At that
moment of their meeting she got into his life by some dark magic,
and before he knew it he had her beating in the pulses of his
blood--somehow thereafter--how he never knew--to steal into the
conduits of his heart, and to inhabit the lone, inviolable
tenement of his one life; so, like love's great thief, to steal
through all the adyts of his soul, and to become a part of all he
did and said and was--through this invasion so to touch all
loveliness that he might touch, through this strange and subtle
stealth of love henceforth to share all that he might feel or
make or dream, until there was for him no beauty that she did not
share, no music that did not have her being in it, no horror,
madness, hatred, sickness of the soul, or grief unutterable, that
was not somehow consonant to her single image and her million
forms--and no final freedom and release, bought through the
incalculable expenditure of blood and anguish and despair, that
would not bear upon its brow for ever the deep scar, upon its
sinews the old mangling chains, of love.</p>

<p>After all the blind, tormented wanderings of youth, that woman
would become his heart's centre and the target of his life, the
image of immortal one-ness that again collected him to one, and
hurled the whole collected passion, power and might of his one
life into the blazing certitude, the immortal governance and
unity, of love.</p>

<p>"Set me as a seal upon thine heart, as a seal upon thine arm:
for love is strong as death; jealousy is cruel as the grave: the
coals thereof are coals of fire, which hath a most vehement
flame."</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>And now all the faces pass in through the ship's great side
(the tender flower face among them). Proud, potent faces of rich
Jews, alive with wealth and luxury, glow in rich, lighted cabins;
the doors are closed, and the ship is given to the darkness and
the sea.</p>
