  <h3>ABOUT THE AUTHOR</h3>

  <p class="first">The Australian authoress Mary Helena Fortune (ca. 1833-1911)
  was one of the first women to write detective fiction, and probably the first
  to write it from the viewpoint of the detective. Her opus includes several
  novels and over 500 stories, many of which feature a detective by the name
  of Mark Sinclair. She wrote under the pseudonyms "Waif Wander" and "W.W."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h3>THE STORY</h3>

  <p class="first">WHY, you know, it was only last summer that I was wearily
  trudging through Melbourne streets in search of lodgings, and will you credit
  it that I have to-day arrived at the dignity of keeping lodgers myself!
  Instead of speaking humbly to crusty old women who scan me from head to foot
  inspectively, and watch any loose articles, such as a huckaback towel, that
  may be lying about when I request to see the "apartment" to let, I have the
  immense satisfaction of being crusty, and of snapping and turning up my nose
  at non-eligible inquirers for rooms myself.</p>

  <p>Now, I don't care how much inclined you may be to disagreeable
  fault-finding, you must acknowledge that I have wonderfully improved my
  condition within the past few months; not that I expect much sympathy from
  you in any case, oh, no! (although, if you made anything by it, I have no
  doubt any quantity of that commodity would be humbly at my service), but you
  are so much in the habit of considering yourself and your judgments as
  infallible, and of talking of yourself as a reasonable and reasoning creature
  (fond public!) that you would not venture upon jeopardising your character by
  denying a fact so obvious.</p>

  <p>And although I calculate upon a hearing of my little insignificant
  interests from you in a general way, in a particular one how idle it would be
  to attempt interesting you! You walk on Turkey carpets, or at the least
  Brussels, you do; and you loll upon, oh, so soft and delicious sofas, and in
  the downiest of easy-chairs; and what do you care about the cost of
  dingy-looking drugget, or the price of sea-weed mattresses! Faugh! the very
  idea of the thing makes you ill, doesn't it? but that doesn't trouble me in
  the least, you know, for it is quite as much pleasure to me to talk of my own
  petty affairs as it is to you to discuss the most important arrangements
  connected with your most magnificent menage.</p>

  <p>If one has the bump of constructiveness at all well developed, there is
  nothing more pleasurably exciting than furnishing a house upon nothing. Until
  you commence to do so with not more than four or five pounds in your purse,
  and begin to contrive tables and seats out of empty cases, and to convert
  trunks and boxes into pretty-looking ottomans, you don't know what fun there
  is in the world. Until you have to scrape pennies together in a way that the
  careful can only understand, and lay them together to make shillings for the
  acquisition of some necessary trifle, you have little idea of the comfort to
  be derived from the most ordinary of necessities; and I have not the least
  doubt that I have more real pleasure in contemplating at this moment a very
  pretty rug, bought for the sum of two shillings and sixpence, than you enjoy
  in looking at the tout ensemble of your very magnificent drawing-room, the
  furnishing of which, I myself am aware, cost you a few cool hundreds.</p>

  <p>And when I laid that said rug down in front of a fireplace as white as
  whitening could make it, and looked from the bright cluster of red roses and
  white lilies in the centre of it, to my muslin-draped toilet, that you would
  never suppose to be three empty orange cases, I began to feel the entire
  satisfaction of having a whole "furnished room to let". You might turn up
  your nose at my clean matted floor, and the efforts I had made to make two
  chairs look four in my disposal of them in half a dozen different positions;
  but, thank goodness, I am not likely to have you looking for lodgings at my
  door just at present, although I have seen loftier ideas than yours reduced
  even lower in my time.</p>

  <p>Well, my "apartment" being in a state of readiness, the next step was to
  take expeditious measures to lay my claims for patronage before the public,
  and, of course, considering my means, or rather my want of them, it was
  necessary for me to do so in as cheap a form as possible. Firstly, then, I
  wrote several "cards", stating that furnished apartments might be had at so-
  and-so, such a street, and these I distributed to the baker and the butcher
  and the grocer, with the polite request that they would kindly place the same
  on view in their several windows. Certainly they all promised to be kind
  enough, and, with one exception, all were kind enough, for I made it my
  business to walk round and see that they had done so; and that disgraceful
  exception was the butcher, who goes round and rings a bell every day to call
  out his customers, and I should think the foolish man had since repented his
  conduct in sackcloth and ashes, for I have not since purchased my pound of
  "chuck" steak, or pennyworth of cat's meat from his cart.</p>

  <p>Now for my own window. I dare say there are many very nice people who feel
  a little weakness about putting a card in their parlour window, and so
  advertising the fact that their incomes are not quite so liberal as could be
  wished, but I do assure you that it was with quite a different feeling I
  displayed my pasteboard and its unique notice. You see I was so proud of my
  half a dozen empty cases, and my two chairs, etc., that I was delighted to
  let everybody know that I really had furnished rooms. However, I met with one
  difficulty at the very outset of preparing my advertisement. I could not
  decide in what form to make it public.</p>

  <p>"Board and residence", eh? in an enclosed card with a delightfully
  embossed border, and suspended inside the window by a prettily-coloured bit
  of love ribbon. Very sweet and pretty, no doubt: but there are "young ladies"
  where that card is, and gentlemen might be disappointed on seeing my old phiz
  at the door; and if there is anything in the world aggravating to women "of a
  certain age", it must be to read in the male eye that they are considered
  passe and not worth the trouble of being polite to. No, I couldn't stand
  that, thank you; and so, what do you say to "Furnished Apartments to
  Let"?</p>

  <p>Hum! Apartment is a very fine word; could I conscientiously declare that a
  room, ornamented, or decorated, or whatever you choose to call it, with six
  empty cases, and two chairs, was a furnished apartment? I don't think I
  could, I really do not, although I am by no means a straitlaced person (as my
  lodgers may find when I come to consider my perquisites), and ready enough to
  stretch a point where my interests are concerned. But beyond a certain amount
  of cheek I cannot go, and it would be really a bit too far to declare that I
  was the landlady of a furnished apartment.</p>

  <p>"A Furnished Room to Let". Well, that's sensible-looking, and to the
  point, and I do like things to seem what they really are, without shirking
  the matter in the least; but, look here, my card is rather small, and what do
  you think of the good old-fashioned word "Lodgings"? I have seen that word in
  a good many windows in a good many "old countries", and I rather like the
  unpretending style of it. You might lodge anywhere&mdash;in an exceedingly
  well- furnished apartment or in a room with a few well-disposed empty cases
  doing duty for tables, etc.; nay, your lodgings might be "on the cold ground"
  for that matter, as the song says, or you might lodge in a gaspipe on Cole's
  wharf, as does our mythical friend the Peripatetic Philosopher; at any rate,
  the word describes the thing I have to dispose of accurately, and I have no
  doubt in the world that disagreeable and evil-disposed persons will be
  calling me a lodging-house keeper one of these odd days; so, in the name of
  peace, "Lodgings" be it.</p>

  <p>And "Lodgings" it was, in the finest old English letters, you can well
  believe, barring the L. I am sorry to say I failed in that, and that it was
  difficult, on a cursory inspection, to pronounce that the complete word was
  not "Todgings". Nay, I heard one little wretched gamin calling "Podgings", at
  the top of his voice, one day, in front of my parlour window; but that was
  entirely out of spite, seeing that he belonged to the house over the way,
  where "Board and Residence" is displayed within the usual embossage, and with
  the usual bit of ribbon, although truth compels me to declare that the latter
  is very considerably fly spotted. No, after I had carefully scraped a too
  long tail off my capital L, and drawn the other tail as near the o as I
  dared, I think I may with safety declare that the person must be indeed very
  ignorant who could, for one moment, mistake the word for anything but what it
  really was, namely, "Lodgings".</p>

  <p>And so I pinned it up nicely between my muslin blind and the window, and
  then I went out into the street to see how it showed. Why, it showed
  beautifully, to be sure, and returned, with a relieved mind, to sit in state
  and wait for the lodger which it might please heaven to send me. Heaven was,
  however, pleased to very considerably try my patience, for I waited there at
  that window days&mdash;ay, weeks&mdash;before I had the extreme pleasure of
  talking to my gossips about the sayings and doings of "my lodger".</p>

  <p>Sometimes one of the passers-by would pause and direct a scrutinising look
  at my card, and at such times my heart would begin to beat anticipatively;
  but I soon discovered that those persons were simply interested by the style
  of my card, and occasionally, I dare say, critically pronouncing on the
  demerits of my capital L. But of all the disappointments I have to record,
  that of the old gentleman who was the final occasion (drat him) of the
  embossed card disappearing from the window of my rival opposite was the very
  greatest.</p>

  <p>I saw this old gentleman appear on the opposite side of the way, and by
  the keen examining look he was shooting from under his bushy eyebrows, first
  at one side of the street and then at the other, I was convinced that he was
  a delightful old fellow in search of "Lodgings". How I jumped from my seat,
  to be sure, and how my heart did really pound at an increased rate when I
  observed that my card had taken his attention, and that he was making
  straight across the street in my direction.</p>

  <p>He was a rotund, Pickwickian-looking old boy in figure, but he had a sharp
  and yet half terrified looking expression, not at all suggestive of Dickens's
  hero; yet I thought him the very acme of old gentlemanliness, as he stood at
  my garden railing and looked at my old English characters on the card. He
  looked at it, I say, and thoughtfully shoved up the end of his nose with the
  knob of his umbrella; and then he hesitatingly turned around toward the
  street, although his hand was already on the latch of my gate.</p>

  <p>I wish that the old <sup>____</sup>, well, it's no use being uncharitable
  now that it's all past and gone, but if ever I wished a card at the
  <sup>____</sup>, I did the one opposite at that moment, for it caught the old
  chap's eye, and, like a hawk sighting a fresh quarry, he let go of my latch,
  md pegged away across the street, to that obnoxious lodging-house keeper over
  the way.</p>

  <p>What could it be? Did my capital L disagree with him, or did the old
  reprobate catch a glimpse of a chignon and blue ribbon band that I saw
  plainly enough bobbing up and down behind the blind, and watching the old
  thing's movements with quite as much interest as myself? Goodness knows; but,
  at any rate, never was a greater disappointment experienced, and had it not
  been for some hopes that he might return, I am afraid that old gent would not
  have been followed by many blessings from my side of the way.</p>

  <p>Vain were my hopes in this as in many another matter. The old fellow
  knocked, and was promptly admitted, as you may suppose; and he must have been
  a person of decided and energetic movements, for five minutes did not elapse
  ere he reappeared, and was accompanied by the landlady, with so much
  empressement, and so many smiles and nods (with a perspective of the chignon
  and blue ribbon band), that I concluded the arrangement was made.</p>

  <p>It was. In less than an hour the old chap returned in a cab, accompanied
  by two eminently respectable portmanteaus. He was received by the same smiles
  and nods, and perspective flitting of a chignon and blue ribbon, and finally
  the door was closed, leaving me, in the fullest sense of the word, an
  outsider. Little I thought, when I sighed over the loss of that tasteless
  individual as an inmate of my apartment, how much he would soon have to do
  with that very apartment, or how soon the occupancy of mine would make the
  lodgings of my rival over the way tremble to their very foundations.</p>

  <p>Look you, I was in one of my most unamiable moods that afternoon, and can
  you in your heart wonder at it? When my black cat came purring to remind me
  that her hour of refection was come and past, I saluted her with such a box
  on the ear that she made tracks under the sofa, and did not venture to
  reappear until matters were smoother; and as I desperately began to prepare
  my usual papers "for the press" (ahem!) I maliciously made six blots on one
  page of my MS, just for the purpose of occasioning that compositor a little
  extra trouble.</p>

  <p>"That will pay him out," I said to myself, "for the absurd nonsense he
  puts under my signature at times. There was that last article about the
  cemetery, for instance; didn't he go and print 'brain' for 'train' in
  connection with 'a girl of the period', as if such a girl could be supposed
  to have the slightest soupcon of the former."</p>

  <p>Slightly relieved by this piece of retaliation, I resumed my position at
  the window, just in time to perceive a skippy-looking female pause also at
  the rival house, just as the chignon and blue ribbon was removing the
  obnoxious card which had attracted and landed the fish I had hoped to secure
  as my own prize. The fact of its removal did not, however, affect the female
  in question for she skipped to the door, and used the knocker to such purpose
  that the chignon and blue ribbon were tossed disdainfully as they disappeared
  from the window. It was a satisfaction to me, as you may well believe, to see
  that female disappointed over the way; and that her object was lodgings I did
  not doubt when she turned her back upon my engaged rival, and walked toward
  my door.</p>

  <p>I must describe that lady to you, not exactly as she appeared to me during
  her approach, for, of a certainty, I was disposed to look upon everything
  connected with her attractive just at that moment. She was, then, a lady of
  no few years; perhaps she carried forty of them on her head, but she tried
  hard to carry them with an air of youth and vitality, which attempt was also
  evinced in her style of dressing, that was girlish and periodical to a
  degree.</p>

  <p>Perhaps the tight and awfully high heels of the boots she endured, that in
  some measure necessitated the skipping movement we must term her walk; but I
  am inclined to believe that it was at least partially assumed, her attire so
  corresponded with the juvenile activity it simulated. Her skirts were
  uncommonly short and scant, her ankles as bony as you could wish, and her
  skinny shoulders well defined, not by nature, but by the tight-fitting waist
  of a dress of as skinny a make as herself. She carried a parasol in one hand
  daintily, as if it were a bouquet, and a small leather bag in the other with
  the tips of her gloved fingers, and by the extreme of the chain, consciously,
  as if it contained something dirty.</p>

  <p>Such was, in appearance, the female who came across the street and after,
  with some difficulty, in consequence of the parasol and the bag, opening my
  gate and stepping in with a little extra skip, performed a "tat-a-tat
  ta-ra-ra-ra-ra" upon my door, that would have astonished you. Depend on it, I
  did not keep the lady waiting, although I am sorry to confess that I did not
  obey the summons without a considerable increase of the acidity of temper I
  had been afflicted with since the old gentleman's desertion; so I opened the
  door with a jerk and inquired her business with as supercilious an air as if
  I had kept lodgings in London or Melbourne during the whole term of my
  natural life.</p>

  <p>"Have you got an apartment to let?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"A furnished apartment?"</p>

  <p>"Ye-e-es; what kind of room do you want?"</p>

  <p>"Oh! a bedroom&mdash;a bedroom for a lady."</p>

  <p>"A single lady?"</p>

  <p>"Of course; the room is for myself."</p>

  <p>"Ah! you are unmarried, then?" (How I should like to have added "still!")
  "Well, I am very particular as to whom I take into my house, and expect
  references."</p>

  <p>"'References! I can furnish the best of references, ma'am, if that's
  necessary," said the lady, with an angry rattle of the bag chain; "but in my
  opinion money is as good a reference as you can have, and I am in the habit
  of always paying my rent in advance."</p>

  <p>"That, in my case, miss, you would find to be a necessity. Will you step
  in and see the apartment?"</p>

  <p>"Pray, may I enquire, is it a front room?"</p>

  <p>"It is a front room."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" and my lady gave a sigh of the deepest relief, and at the same time
  a glance which I considered to be strangely directed toward the lodging-house
  opposite. "One question more, ma'am, and a most important one&mdash;are there
  any of the male sex about this house?"</p>

  <p>"Male sex!" I ejaculated in the utmost astonishment, as the prim lady
  moved past me into the hall. "I fail to gather your meaning."</p>

  <p>"I mean have you any gentlemen lodgers or other members of the sex in the
  house&mdash;in daily communion, I mean?" she explained with a little simper,
  and a screwed-up mouth, that I defy you to imitate.</p>

  <p>"On, no! I have no gentlemen lodgers; nor are there any males in intimate
  communion with even the walls of the house, saving and excepting the woodman,
  to whom you could not have any objection, seeing that he is old and
  respectable, viz., the father of a large family."</p>

  <p>"I'm glad of that&mdash;very glad&mdash;for I could not even think of
  risking my character by residing in the same house as a gentleman. I think
  young persons cannot be too careful."</p>

  <p>"Certainly not, miss; that is the reason I have such an objection to
  gentlemen lodgers" (and I thought sadly of the old gent opposite). "Here is
  the apartment."</p>

  <p>Yes, there was the apartment, looking so admirable and pretty with its
  cases decorated, and its two chairs doing duty for four, that I thought it
  the most mortal of pities it should not become the lodging of a nice, tidy,
  elderly gentleman. While I was thinking so, my young lady was looking
  anxiously and carefully from the window, as if the apartment she thought of
  occupying was on the other side of the street, and she was examining its
  comforts and capabilities. I thought this rather strange at the time, more
  particularly when she turned suddenly to me and said.</p>

  <p>"I'll take the room, ma'am. What is the rent?"</p>

  <p>She was in earnest evidently, as her purse was produced from the bag with
  the rattling chain as she spoke.</p>

  <p>Now I have often had occasion to comment on the impossibility of
  gratifying the craving desires of humanity, and in this matter I saw myself
  no exception to the general rule. A few hours before, I should have been only
  too glad to look forward to the probability of letting my apartment to a
  single lady of irreproachable character, and a strict determination to take
  especial care of the same valuable article, and here I was positively half
  sorry that she showed so decided an intention to locate herself in my
  establishment. Simply because she was so ready with her money, after I had
  declared a hundred times over that rent in advance I would have from king or
  kaiser! "Why she has never even looked at the accommodation inside the room!"
  I mentally ejaculated, "and there she is, with the open purse in her hand,
  staring out of the window, as if the most delightful prospect in the world
  was a brick house with a dingy iron railing in front."</p>

  <p>"And the top of an old gentleman's round bald head, surmounting a little
  round pair of spectacled eyes, peering over the blind," I might have added,
  for just at that moment I observed the new lodger opposite taking a peep at
  the street; and my lodger saw him too, for she drew back and bridled, and
  looked sheepishly at me, and again devoted herself to the arrangement of
  terms.</p>

  <p>And the terms were arranged, and the old young lady, whose name, by the
  way, was "Miss Anna Perkins", went to bring her wardrobe from her former
  lodgings. And the wardrobe was brought, also in a cab, consisting, outwardly,
  of one small stereotyped boot-box and four dilapidated bonnet-boxes. Two old
  parasols followed, in company with a white covered umbrella and a pair of
  dingy goloshes, and, finally, Miss Perkins, with all her belongings, was
  "fixed" among my ornamented empty cases and my two chairs, etc.</p>

  <p>And then came my initiation into the comfort of keeping lodgers. Miss
  Perkins wanted some warm water to perform her ablutions, and I was under the
  disagreeable necessity of informing her that she might observe the kitchen
  fire to be out, and that if she wished for warm water, she must kindle it
  (viz., the fire), and procure the article for herself. Then she requested my
  assistance in removing the so-called toilet-table from the window to a dim
  corner of the apartment, as there was "nothing so pleasant," she declared,
  "as a seat by the window"; "or so unpleasant," I mentally added, "as for an
  old woman who wishes to be young to see the wrinkles in her face too
  plainly."</p>

  <p>Early next morning, Miss Anna Perkins was up and out, and all the way to
  the Eastern Market; and she came home laden with two little red flower-pots;
  one containing an incipient rose-tree, and the other a very weak myrtle.
  Added to these were a miniature green watering-pot and a brown-ware teapot of
  the very smallest dimensions; I was just in the middle of my breakfast
  preparations when she entered the kitchen and deposited her purchases on the
  table with a giggle and a skip, and drew the longest breath of relief that
  her flat chest could afford.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I'm so tired! Dear me, you couldn't imagine what a time I've had of
  it! I don't think I should have really got back at all had it not been for a
  gentleman, who insisted on carrying my watering-pot and flowers."</p>

  <p>"What! one of the male sex?" I exclaimed, in affected astonishment.</p>

  <p>"He-he! I couldn't help it. Oh, I do assure you, he perfectly insisted,
  and followed me so persistently: what could I do, you know? And when he
  really took my things, almost forcibly, I couldn't struggle in the street,
  could I, or be rude?"</p>

  <p>"Did it not strike you as rudeness on his part at all, Miss Perkins?"</p>

  <p>"Well now, there's a great deal in manner, you know, and his was not
  rude&mdash;only anxious to save a lady trouble. And he joked so, I could not,
  do all I would, help laughing&mdash;he-he! He did so enjoy my teapot, and
  said it was so old-maid-like, that he almost insisted on destroying it, the
  dear little thing&mdash;he-he! But, in spite of all his entreaties, I would
  not even permit him to carry it for me. It would have looked so, you
  know."</p>

  <p>I didn't like my lodger&mdash;there; and I don't at all mind owning it to
  you as events turned out. I should fifty times over rather have had a crusty
  old bachelor to deal with than a vain old woman, that would imagine herself
  youthful. I don't think there is a more despicable object in the world than
  this latter, and I never meet with one without the inclination to tell her a
  bit of my mind on the subject. Perhaps, you will uncharitably gather from
  this that I have reached such an age myself as to render all attempts at
  revivification useless; but I haven't, you see, although I am by no means a
  skipping young lady myself.</p>

  <p>My morning avocations performed, I resumed my usual seat at the window of
  the sitting-room, and, the door of Miss Perkins' apartment being open and
  opposite mine, I had the pleasure of seeing her arrange her flower-pots in
  the window, and exhibit her loose muslin-clad arm in using the little green
  watering-pot for their behoof in the jauntiest and airiest manner
  conceivable. Indeed, she threw the window so fully up, and fluttered around
  it so persistently, that I began to fancy she was a little more touched in
  the upper story than I had even at first concluded, when something or other
  attracted her gaze to the street.</p>

  <p>And just as it was, I saw the old gentleman opposite appear over the
  blind, or, at least, his round bald head and his round spectacled eyes. He
  stared&mdash;he stared, and his head appeared to grow shiny, as it certainly
  did grow red, and his eyes rounder than ever; and then he drew suddenly back,
  as if from some most disagreeable and astonishing discovery. What could it
  be? I rose up, and looked up the street and down the street, like a true
  daughter of Eve, but I saw nothing, save Miss Anna Perkins flourishing her
  watering-pot, and smirking in such a hideous manner, that I felt certain she
  also had observed the old gentleman with the round eyes and bald head. "Bah!"
  I thought, "she's been making eyes at the poor old man, and terrified him out
  of his wits. I don't wonder at it, for a husband-hunting old fool is
  abominable."</p>

  <p>The old gentleman appeared not again; and, after a couple of hours'
  hanging and lolling around the open window, Miss Perkins dressed herself to
  kill, and emerged from the front door, performing the role of an innocent and
  lively young damsel to her own admiration. The scrap of ground in front of my
  residence ought hardly to be dignified by the title of garden, but Miss
  Perkins made the most of it, as a little area to disport herself in before
  she passed into the street. She plucked a little scrap of privet and a tiny
  bit of laurestina, and a morsel of stunted briar, and she placed them
  daintily together, and smelled them with, oh, such an air! and she finally
  went out, casting a side- glance at the windows over the way, and patting her
  lips and caressing her lanky cheek with the small bouquet in a most
  bewitching manner.</p>

  <p>And she sauntered up the street towards the Gardens, with an air of
  saunter that no person could mistake. "I am simply going for a stroll" was so
  evident in her affected dawdle, that I could not help giving vent to my
  feelings aloud. "If that old gent over the way does not accept your plain
  invitation to follow you in a stroll, my most fair Miss Perkins," I said,
  "then your attentions may in future be devoted to some one of the male sex
  more worthy of, and more likely to reciprocate them. However, I do not doubt
  that you are stringing, or trying to string, your bow double, and that your
  'gentleman' of this morning has some slight idea of your stroll in the
  Gardens."</p>

  <p>"But, bless my heart, is he an old fool after all?" This exclamation was
  drawn from me by the fact that a moment had scarcely elapsed after Miss
  Perkins' disappearance from the street, when the old fellow trotted out from
  his door, and looked keenly in the direction she had taken. And he looked
  more than keenly&mdash;he looked vicious and determined, and like a man who
  had made up his mind to a certain thing, and would go through with it, even
  if all sorts of obstacles should be encountered on the way; but for any sake,
  I beg you to imagine my complete astonishment when the old chap commenced to
  trot across the street, and finally, opened my gate, with the same pursed-up
  mouth and frowning brow, as if his determination had at any rate something to
  do with the sharp rap he presently gave at my door.</p>

  <p>I opened it in a sort of daze, and I had no time to wonder. Perhaps an
  idea that the lodgings opposite did not suit him may have shot across my
  mind, but if it did, the old man's first words changed it.</p>

  <p>"I have something to say to you, ma'am," he said sturdily, and emphasising
  his words with a rap of his stick on the ground&mdash; "something about that
  disgusting lady-lodger of yours; and I want to go inside to your
  sitting-room, where I won't be liable to be pounced upon by the jade in the
  middle of it." And he looked up the street with such a frown and twist of his
  mouth, while he clutched the cane more firmly in his hand, as if he would not
  have hesitated to attack Miss Anna Perkins bodily, should she unfortunately
  make her appearance.</p>

  <p>"Gracious me!" thinks I, as I led the way into my sitting-room
  wonderingly, and saw the old fellow seat himself in my chair, and wipe his
  face with his voluminous silk handkerchief. "And now, sir" (aloud) "will you
  be good enough to tell me your business?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, ma'am, I will be good enough&mdash;I came here for the purpose of
  being good enough. Your female lodger is a jade, ma'am, and it is the very
  greatest satisfaction for me to tell you so." And the fellow drew in his chin
  and stamped his foot and his stick, and looked at me as if he considered me
  in league with Miss Anna Perkins, and one of the same species myself.</p>

  <p>"I have no doubt, sir, that you express your opinion, however too candidly
  I may consider you do it, but pray what have I got to do with your opinion of
  Miss Perkins?"</p>

  <p>"Miss Devilskin!" he muttered between his teeth ere he replied. "Yes,
  ma'am, you've come to the point, and I expected that you would come to the
  point. What have you got to do with it? Exactly. What will you make by it?
  Just so. Oh, ma'am, I know the world&mdash;so do you, eh? However, it
  simplifies matters considerably to have you speak your mind out
  plainly&mdash;not one woman in twenty hundred would have done it; they would
  have pretended innocence, and immaculate honour, and all sorts of trash.
  Ma'am, I hate women!" Emphasised by another thump of the stick.</p>

  <p>"The women are in despair to have gained your bad opinion, doubtless, sir,
  but I do assure you that I do not personally care one straw whether you hate
  them or not. Now, sir, will you please tell me what you are driving at, as
  Miss Perkins may interrupt you before you are prepared?"</p>

  <p>"D<sup>____</sup> Miss Perkins&mdash;the jade! That old woman is the bane
  of my existence, ma'am. She is rendering my existence a perfect hell upon
  earth! I have the misfortune to be well off, ma'am, and the wretch knows it!
  If I was a fox, ma'am, and Miss Devilskin was a hound, she could not nose me
  and follow me out with more persistence; but, by <sup>____</sup>, I am a fox,
  as far as cunning goes, and that she shall know before long!"</p>

  <p>Good heavens! how the stick did go on the floor, and how red the old
  gentleman got in the face as he flourished his hat about with the other hand!
  I do declare to you that I began to think of apoplexy and lunacy, and all
  sorts of disagreeable things, as the excited speaker went on. Suddenly he
  turned and faced me fully. Turned with a movement, in which stick, and hat,
  and eyes, and spectacles, and even the very buttons on his coat, seemed to
  play separate parts of a most extraordinary whole, and asked.</p>

  <p>"Now, ma'am, what will you take for Miss Perkins&mdash;the&mdash;
  jade?"</p>

  <p>"Take for Miss Perkins!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, take for Miss Perkins! What's her selling price? Come now, what
  price, in round straightforward figures, do you put upon that wrinkled,
  bedizened old fool, Anna Perkins?"</p>

  <p>"Ha-ha!" Oh, I couldn't for the life of me help it, the whole thing was so
  absurd. "Ha! ha! ha! Oh, sir, I don't think the value I should set upon the
  dear creature would break any bank; but I do assure you that your meaning is
  incomprehensible to me. If you wish to buy my lodger, surely you had better
  apply to herself on the subject."</p>

  <p>"Of course, I haven't explained myself," he said, looking a little
  foolish, and moving the end of his stick uneasily on the carpet. "You know
  nothing about it&mdash;how should you? Bah, I'm an old fool. Look here,
  ma'am, that jade found me out at a boarding- house in town, where I had been
  for two years, and where I was very comfortable. She made a dead set at me, I
  tell you, and in such a barefaced, giggling manner, that I was obliged to
  bolt for it, to get rid of her. I made a moonlight flitting of it ma'am, and
  used every precaution. By gad, I even had my letters addressed under cover,
  so that she might not find me out. Will you believe it, ma'am? I had not been
  there three days in my new quarters when the wretch took the very room next
  to mine in the same house, and there she was, grinning at me, and sticking up
  her bony shoulders before me when I came home to have a peaceable dinner! Man
  or devil couldn't stand it. Next day, I came here and took a room where there
  was no other to let, but, by ----, the first thing I set my eyes on next
  morning is that infernal hag making faces at me from your window! I'll buy
  her out! By Jupiter, I'll buy her out, if it took my last pound out of the
  bank! I'm not going to be driven about, like a Wandering Jew, in my old days,
  by a&mdash;husband-hunting old curse!"</p>

  <p>He couldn't talk any more; he was completely out of breath, and panting
  with the rage he had worked himself into. And what reply could I make? What
  could I possibly know of his meaning in buying Miss Perkins out? However, he
  soon recovered himself, and went on.</p>

  <p>"Now do you know what I mean, ma'am?"</p>

  <p>"Upon my word, sir, I do not."</p>

  <p>"I want you to turn that old Jezebel out! I want to pay for her room!
  That's what I want, and I don't care if I pay double rent, but out with
  her!"</p>

  <p>"My good sir, if you consider one moment, you will see that it would be
  utterly impossible for me to be taking money from you for an empty room."</p>

  <p>"Why? I can't see it."</p>

  <p>"You simply offer me a bribe, as I understand it, to get Miss Perkins out
  of your way. I couldn't accept a bribe, sir."</p>

  <p>"Bribe be ---, I only want to pay you for losing your lodger."</p>

  <p>"Yes, pay me for keeping my room empty. Perhaps, the next lady lodger I
  got might be quite as objectionable as Miss Perkins."</p>

  <p>"Get a gentleman lodger, can't you?"</p>

  <p>"I might, sir; but it's only a chance, you know."</p>

  <p>"By Jupiter, I'll take the room and live in it myself, before I'll be
  beaten!"</p>

  <p>"And then Miss Perkins will take the one you at present occupy, and you
  will be simply out of the frying pan into the fire. Depend upon it, if Miss
  Perkins discovers your plan, she will just step over into your old room."</p>

  <p>"Will she though?" he said with, I am sorry to say, something very like a
  jubilant wink (the old scamp!) "I'll take care of that! The people over there
  know what side their bread's buttered on. Leave that to me. Now, when does
  she march?"</p>

  <p>"I must give her a week's notice, you know."</p>

  <p>"Phew! I'm off to the Dandenong Ranges for eight days, if that's it! At
  any rate. I'll hide where she won't find me."</p>

  <p>"In the Yarra Bend wouldn't be a bad place," I could not help saying, with
  a laugh.</p>

  <p>"Oh. You're a queer one, you are. There's your money, a fortnight in
  advance. The change for "extras"--lodging-house extras; oh, I know? Good day!
  I'll be here on the evening of this day week, bag and baggage." And out he
  went with a chuckle, banging the door after him, and leaving me sitting with
  the note in my hand, and feeling funny.</p>

  <p>What a scene with Miss Perkins, to be sure! but never mind. I should gain
  three shillings a-week by the change, not to speak of the chance of setting
  my own cap at the gentleman lodger. The old silly! Little he guesses what
  he's doing; never mind, we'll see. With these thoughts, came Miss Anna
  Perkins, skipping to the gate, and casting such sheep's eyes at the window
  opposite, as made me laugh loud enough to be heard next door, I dare say.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I'm quite fatigued! I'm such a creature! but it's lovely in the
  Gardens to-day, Mrs---. Oh, dear, how tired I am, to be sure! I must have a
  cup of tea directly, out of my dear little teapot. He-he! What a nice view
  you have from this window. Oh, there's Lodgings there too!"</p>

  <p>Sure enough the ticket was replaced in the window opposite, and I guessed
  it was simply a ruse of the cunning old fellow's, and followed it up.</p>

  <p>"Yes," I said, "there was an old gentleman came there yesterday, but I
  suppose the rooms do not suit him, for he leaves immediately. I presume that
  cab is come to remove him."</p>

  <p>Yes. Out came the boxes once more, and out came the old hero himself, and
  got into the conveyance with an air of triumph, which I should fail to
  describe. And there stood Miss Perkins, like a transformation, staring at the
  departure with feelings of disappointment that I could guess.</p>

  <p>"By the by, Miss Perkins, I have a rather unpleasant matter to break to
  you, since I entered into an engagement to let you my apartment yesterday,
  circumstances have so altered that I find myself under the necessity of
  giving you a week's notice to leave. If you prefer leaving at once I shall
  with pleasure return your advanced rent."</p>

  <p>If I expected any explosion, I was disappointed. The loss of her game
  affected her too deeply to leave room for any other feeling, so she turned an
  old withered face without one spark of her recent animation in it, from the
  window, and said, "It makes no difference whatever to me; one can always find
  a room. Is the kettle boiling?"</p>

  <p>Well, my ticket with the peculiar L, has disappeared from behind my blind,
  and I have had an old gent in Miss P's late room, for a week. I have
  fabricated for myself such a lovely muslin morning-cap (à la veuve of course)
  in which I make the old chap's chocolate in the mornings, that all the widows
  in the colony would be breaking their hearts for the pattern, could they only
  see it. Little that old chap guesses what a dangerous house he's got into,
  for you see, I'm not an old maid, and I have that funny old gent's measure to
  a T already. Already, too, he is beginning to think me the most sensible
  woman he ever conversed with, and admires excessively my plain outspoken
  manner, "so different from most women," he says; ha, ha! Lord help the old
  silly!</p>

  <p>I mean to tell you something more about my lodgers, for I use the plural,
  seeing that I am fitting up another apartment to let. I wish I dare give you
  my address, it would be such a good advertisement, you know; but what would
  be the use of my writing it, seeing that our Editor would only draw his
  indefatigable pen right through the middle of it. Ha, there comes my old
  chap, trotting along, and twirling his stick as if there was not a Miss Anna
  Perkins in the wide world.</p>
