  sailed out of the terror-ridden night, and sharp, hooked talons ripped at the
  tender flesh of a lovely, helpless girl, he knew that there was
  another&mdash;and far more dangerous mission&mdash;which he must first

  <h2><a id="ch1"
     name="ch1"></a>I. &mdash; BIRD OF DEATH</h2>

  <p class="first">THE dirt road had been climbing for five miles, and Dick
  Mervale knew from the increasing difficulty with which he breathed that they
  must be very high. But there was the greater height on the right of the road
  along which their open-topped roadster traveled: a grey cliff which rose
  almost perpendicular for a thousand feet, and then became a thickly forested
  slope running back, but still upward, until it seemed to hang in the overcast
  sky, a vast, dark, looming shape, somehow foreboding.</p>

  <p>"Buzzard Mountain," Fred Harris said, jerking his head toward it. "If my
  hunch is right, Gorham Carstairs is somewhere up there. Winburg's a mile
  ahead, around the bend. Remember the story. We're driving through to Haleton.
  We got twisted off the highway, but someone told us it was better to keep on
  than to turn back. Better let me do the talking."</p>

  <p>"No chance of someone's recognizing you, is there? Like you did Carstairs'
  photo when the reward circular came into the office?"</p>

  <p>"Hell no! I was a kid of fourteen when Mom died an' Uncle Leslie sent for
  me. Carstairs was a grown man then. <i>He</i> didn't change much in the
  twenty years he was working in the bank, except that he's got grey. But we
  got to watch ourselves. These hillbillies hate furriners worse'n poison, an'
  they stick together like glue. If they're suspicious, we're lawmen our bird'll be
  gone when we get to his hideout, an' five grand reward will be gone with him.
  Five grand, an' our big chance to show up the cops an' wedge in on the
  Bankers' Association business."</p>

  <p>Harris might have left the hills twenty years ago, but the hill dialect
  clung to him; and he was wiry, lean-faced expressionless as all the mountain
  breed. Dick Mervale was burly, gigantic by contrast; his hard-boned
  countenance heavy-jowled. But there was an air of competence about him too,
  and undaunted courage in his grey, level eyes.</p>

  <p>"Lord," he grunted. "You don't have to keep rubbing it in that this break
  means we'll start eating regular at last. I was about ready to pack in the
  private dick racket and crawl back on the force when..."</p>

  <p>Harris grunted suddenly, and pitched forward over the wheel. Mervale
  grabbed for it, kicking Fred's foot off the accelerator, pounding his own
  heel on the brake, and fighting for a frantic moment to keep the lunging car
  from running off the curving road, from catapulting into a shaggy, thick tree
  trunk that loomed suddenly straight ahead.</p>

  <p>The roadster stopped, and Mervale's shoulder-holster automatic was in his
  fist. But there wasn't anyone to shoot at. There was only the thick greenery
  of the tree clump that filled the bend where the road curved, and screened
  the halted car from the heights. There was only the grey glimmer of the
  cliff-face through the clustered trunks.</p>

  <p>"Fred," Mervale whispered. "Are you sick? <i>Fred!"</i></p>

  <p>Harris lolled against him, limp and utterly motionless. "Fred," his
  partner groaned, sighting a little black hole in the left side of
  brown-thatched skull, and a dribble of blood that ran down a leathery cheek.
  Not very much of it. Dead men do not bleed.</p>

  <p>DEAD. It took a little time for the realization to percolate into
  Mervale's numbed brain that his buddy was dead. They hadn't expected anything
  like this. Not from the grey little man who had been an inconspicuous,
  trusted bank clerk for two decades, and then had absconded with fifty
  thousand dollars. They had thought it only a question of tracing Carstairs
  down, putting the cuffs on his wrists and taking him back with them to the
  city.</p>

  <p>No lead from a pocket-gun had made that little hole. It was steel&mdash;a
  steel-jacketed rifle bullet that did not spread. The hole was an inch above
  Harris' ear, raked downward. It had come from above, from far above...</p>

  <p>Mervale recalled a sharp crack, like the snap of a broken bough, that
  sounded just before his companion had slumped. It had been so distant he had
  paid no attention to it. Distant&mdash;The lethal shot had come from far up
  the mountain.</p>

  <p>He glanced up, involuntarily. The leafy tree-tops which had saved him from
  sharing his partner's fate blocked his view of the height. But against the
  leaden sky he saw a black-winged shape wheel and circle. He remembered the
  name of the mountain, and shuddered.</p>

  <p>The buzzards were already gathering to pick Fred's bones. But they
  wouldn't get the chance... If he drove into Winburg he'd have to explain what
  had happened. The quick suspicions of the hillbillies would be aroused, and
  Carstairs would be warned.</p>

  <p>Little muscles, knotting, made a ridge along Mervale's jaw, and his eyes
  were bleak, dangerous.</p>

  <p>There was only one practicable way to climb Buzzard Mountain. Harris had
  sketched it for him: a narrow, ledge-like path that started a half-mile
  beyond Winburg and zigzagged up the face of the cliff. Mervale was going up
  that path. He was going up there alone, and he was going to bring Carstairs
  down it. Or leave him up there, food for the buzzards.</p>

  <p>But he'd have to reach the foot of that path first, and he'd have to pass
  through Winburg to do it. Well, there was a carpet of dead leaves under the
  trees there. And there were scattered rocks that could be piled over a corpse
  and keep it safe from carrion birds, till its murder could be avenged, and it
  could be given decent burial.</p>

  <p>Fifteen minutes later the roadster, with a single occupant now, purred
  through the shielding woods, rounded a shoulder of Buzzard Mountain...</p>

  <p>Again Dick Mervale's heel came down hard on the brake.</p>

  <p>A gaunt, cadaverous man was in the center of the road, where it became a
  street running between a half-dozen ramshackle, unpainted houses. There was a
  sawed-off shotgun in his gnarled hands and it was lifted to snout straight at
  Mervale's heart.</p>

  <p>"What's the idea?" the detective growled. "This a stick-up?" A pulse
  pumped in his wrists. Had he been observed concealing Harris' body? Or were
  Carstairs' friends making sure that no stranger passed through the valley
  alive?</p>

  <p>The armed man came closer. There was a curious wariness in the way he
  moved. There was something like fear in his faded, red-rimmed eyes. Like fear
  that had dwelt there a long time. Nor was it fear of Mervale or of any human
  thing.</p>

  <p>"Who are yeh?" the fellow demanded, hitching a shirt-sleeved shoulder to
  keep the frayed strap of his once-blue overalls from sliding off. "Whar yeh
  comin' from an' whar yeh gwine?"</p>

  <p>Mervale forced a mirthless smile to his tight lips. "Why all the
  questions? This town quarantined or something?" There was something queer
  about the place, some brooding strangeness that was seeping into it with the
  dusk, making it silent and&mdash;evil.</p>

  <p><i>"I'm</i> doin' th' askin'." The man's flesh-less lips seemed not to
  move at all. "An' <i>you</i> th' answerin'&mdash;ef yeh're smart."</p>

  <p>"All right. Keep your shirt on. My name's Dick Merton." There were
  initials on the bag strapped to the luggage-carrier, lucky they were his own
  and not Fred's. "I'm driving through from Louisville to Haleton." Mervale's
  look slid covertly past the gun bearer.</p>

  <p>There were others on the crazily canted wooden sidewalk bordering the
  street&mdash;all men. There wasn't a woman to be seen, nor a child. The door
  of each house was shut, its windows covered by shutters or tattered
  cloths.</p>

  <p>The men were all armed, all silent...They watched him with lackluster
  eyes in which there lurked that same old expression of ancient fear.</p>

  <p>"Haleton, huh. Whut yeh doin' on this road?"</p>

  <p>"I got twisted, back a way. By the time I found I'd taken the wrong turn
  I'd gone about two miles. I was told I might as well keep going, it wasn't
  much farther this way. That right?"</p>

  <p>"Right enough. Who tol' yeh thet?"</p>

  <p>"He didn't introduce himself." Out of the corner of his eye Mervale saw
  that the other men were closing in on him, moving stealthily, as though they
  hoped he would not notice. Their ill-shod feet slid through the grey dust of
  the road, and the dust was a grey film powdering them from head to foot.
  There was a creeping menace in that slow encircling, and yet he was aware
  that they were all in the grip of a nightmare dread.</p>

  <p>"Whut'd he look like?"</p>

  <p>Mervale's expression did not change, there was no flicker in his level,
  steely gaze. But apprehension ran in his veins and tightened his scalp. He
  was caught. They would know every inhabitant for miles around... In the nick
  of time he remembered a figure glimpsed at the edge of the woods, peering as
  if surprised at the passing roadster.</p>

  <p>"He was about sixty. He had a scrubby white beard and there was a white
  scar on his cheek, like this." The detective gestured in description.</p>

  <p>"Thet's Elton Stane, Zebediah," a new voice behind him said. "Thar's a
  Louisville newspaper wadded under the strap here on his bag. Date on it's th'
  twenny-fust. Thet wuz yestiddy. Guess th' furriner's story's squar'."</p>

  <p>The threatening shotgun wavered, dropped. Mervale relaxed. He had passed
  the cross-examination...</p>

  <p>And then he stiffened again as Zebediah asked another question. "D'je see
  anythin' flyin' in th' sky, mister? Like a big, black bird?"</p>

  <p>They knew something then, or suspected something, about what had happened
  behind the mountain spur. They had seen the buzzard...</p>

  <p>"No," the detective answered. "No, I saw no bird."</p>

  <p>The corners of Zebediah's mouth twitched briefly. "Yeh will," he muttered.
  "Yeh'll see it afore yeh're many hours older. An' mebbe yeh'll feel it."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" Mervale rapped the question out, his neck cording with
  sudden anger. Was it a threat? Was it a prophecy that his own body would lie
  out on the mountain, carrion for the buzzards. "What the hell are you driving
  at?"</p>

  <p>"Show him, Elmer. Let him see."</p>

  <p>"Gee, Pop!" It was agonized protest, wrung from the throat of a
  tow-headed, gawky youth of about nineteen. "Gee&mdash;I..."</p>

  <p>"Show him," the man with the shotgun repeated inexorably.</p>

  <p>Elmer turned and shuffled to a burlap-covered, shapeless heap which lay on
  the paintless boards of a stepless porch that crowded the road. He bent,
  pulled back the drab rag.</p>

  <p>Horror twisted at the pit of Mervale's stomach. It was a child who lay
  there, a flaxen-haired little girl. It <i>had been</i> a child. Now it was a
  contorted, stiff cadaver over which black flies crawled and buzzed; a corpse
  whose breast and throat were gashed open, <i>ripped</i> open, by fierce,
  sharp talons. He could see the marks of the lethal claws, the long, ragged
  gashes where they had dug in, striking for a firmer grip.</p>

  <p>"Thet's whut I mean," Zebediah's voice was utterly without intonation,
  without emotion. "She ain't th' fust, nor th' last."</p>

  <p>"Good&mdash;Lord," Mervale husked, his fisted hands pushing down on the
  steering wheel, lifting him from his seat. "I get it now. You're hunting the
  thing that did that. I'll help. I'll..."</p>

  <p><i>"Set down!</i> An' get on. We uns'll take take care of our own
  troubles. Git on whar yeh were gwine, an' keep yer mouth shet, Winburg don't
  need no help from no furriners. <i>Git!"</i></p>

  <p>He meant it. And he was going to enforce his order with a shotgun that was
  lifted again, a gnarled finger tight on its trigger. Dick Mervale shot away
  from that strange group, in that strange, stricken town. He felt their eyes,
  in which terror dwelt, watch him until he had rounded the spur of the cliff
  that hid him from them.</p>

  <p>Shuddering with the memory of the thing he had seen, with the memory of
  the queer men who would keep their vengeance to themselves though their blood
  was watery with the fear in their veins, Mervale almost passed the point
  where the zig-zagging path started up the cliff to where Gorham Carstairs
  hid. But he saw it in time, and braked the roadster to a skidding halt.</p>

  <p>He too, had a mission of vengeance. He too, would carry it out alone,
  though Satan himself should try to stop him.</p>

  <p>There, on the right of the road, was a clump of bushes where Fred had
  planned to conceal the car. Climbing the face of the cliff he would be hidden
  from the killer above. But there would be no concealment from the black bird,
  the sight of whose work still sickened him.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch2"
     name="ch2"></a>II. &mdash; THE FLYING FEAR</h2>

  <p class="first">THE chill of the high forest struck through Dick Mervale's
  thin topcoat to his very marrow, but he dared not kindle the fire for which
  every exhausted cell of his big-boned body cried. He dared not even use his
  flashlight to find a nook that might shelter him from the steady, unrelenting
  flow of the icy wind that had sprung up as darkness rushed down the side of
  Buzzard Mountain to blot cliff and valley from his straining sight.</p>

  <p>The smallest light would carry appallingly far in the starless dark.
  Carstairs would inevitably see it, and his rifle would make another corpse to
  lie unmoving in the silent night.</p>

  <p>Well, Mervale thought, he'd just have to make the best of it till dawn
  made it possible to go on with comparative safety. He'd been lucky, at that,
  to have gained the top of the precipice just as it became too dark to see
  anything any more. He was lucky, in the fading light, not to have made the
  single misstep that would have plunged him off the narrow trail and sent him
  catapulting down to smash on the rocks a thousand feet below.</p>

  <p>The detective was no coward. He had demonstrated that in more than one
  running gun-battle with city crooks. But, haunched on the ground, hands
  between knees that were drawn up to his chin as he huddled in a vain endeavor
  to ward off the penetrating cold by the warmth of his own blood, he was
  afraid now. Deathly afraid.</p>

  <p>It was a new experience to Dick Mervale to be jittery, nervous as a rookie
  cop on his first night patrol. But it was a new experience too, to be so
  terribly, completely alone in a vast and sightless void.</p>

  <p>City-bred, he had never known such silence as this. Such velvety, blinding
  darkness. It loomed above him to his right, alive with vague, ominous
  rustlings. It did Mervale no good to insist those sounds were only the
  stirring of the wind in dense foliage and the scuttering of small, nocturnal
  creatures of the wild. Twenty years of urban dwelling could not wholly have
  robbed Gorham Carstairs of his woodcraft. He would make no more noise than
  that if he were prowling the thicket, hunting for the man who hunted him.</p>

  <p>There were no sounds to Mervale's left. There was only the darkness
  filling an awful, empty abyss, dropping down and down to nothingness.</p>

  <p>Winburg was down there, a thousand feet below. But no lights showed from
  the hamlet, no hint of human existence. They were scarcely human, the
  fearful-eyed people who lived there. They cowered under a pall of primordial
  fear, and for all their shotguns, for all their crusty refusal of outside
  aid, they knew they were helpless against the flying, taloned destroyer that
  ravaged them.</p>

  <p>They had not told him so, but Mervale knew that more than the one clawed,
  ripped body lay unburied in that hamlet of horror. He knew that the terror
  would strike yet again&mdash;and that its lair was somewhere up here on the
  heights.</p>

  <p>Could buzzards, he wondered, see in the dark?</p>

  <p>The nape of his neck bristled at the thought&mdash;and then Mervale's
  muscles tautened in response to a blast of hoarse sound from the forest
  depths.</p>

  <p>He jumped to his feet, his shoulder-holstered automatic magically
  appearing in his fingers. He peered into the stygian murk whence that flat,
  terrifying bellow had come.</p>

  <p>Something screamed thinly, only yards away from him. The distance might
  have been miles, for all Mervale could see of the shrill, agonized sound's
  source. It cut off. The silence shut down again, the murmursome silence of
  the fear-filled forest.</p>

  <p>He probed the darkness with burning eyes. That scream had been the voice
  of terror and torture and death. The hoot that had preceded it had been the
  voice of an unearthly killer sure of its prey.</p>

  <p>The hoot... Hysterical laughter plucked at Mervale's larynx. That was it,
  of course. An owl had hooted, pouncing on a rabbit that had squealed, and
  died. A negligible incident, in the drama of death that is the life of the
  wild, had begun and ended. That was all.</p>

  <p>He'd have to get a hold on himself. He'd have to stop acting like a
  two-year old, afraid of the dark. There was, really, only Carstairs he had to
  fear. And Carstairs would have to have second-sight to know he was on Buzzard
  Mountain. The place where he had shot Fred was the last spot on the road that
  was visible from up here. The absconder could by no possibility have seen
  Mervale leave the roadster and climb the cliff.</p>

  <p>The bird terrorizing Winburg, whatever it was, would not attack a grown
  man. A child, yes; but...</p>

  <p>Thought froze in Mervale's brain with the realization that something
  hovered over him, a shadow that had detached itself from the soaring shadows
  of the trees. His head jerked back.</p>

  <p>There it was, a silently swooping black shape against the grey-black of
  the overcast sky. A winged thing, climbing some long, invisible slope of the
  wind. The owl...</p>

  <p>That was no owl! No owl was ever so huge. No owl, and no buzzard, had a
  body five feet long, wings spreading twelve feet from tip to tip! This was
  some antediluvian monster, some horror from out of the dawn of time, survived
  somehow, or reborn, preying upon human beings as the owl preyed upon the
  small animals of the wild!</p>

  <p>Panic, appalling ancestral panic, shook Dick Mervale as a terrier shakes a
  rat. Fear of the unknown. Fear of the dreadful night and the unknowable,
  unseeable things that prowl the dark his forbears gave over to them, cowering
  sleepless in their dank caves.</p>

  <p>His gun-arm jerked up, his finger tightening on the automatic's trigger.
  He hesitated. Carstairs would be sure to hear the shot and be alarmed. Even
  if, by good fortune, it struck the monster and brought it down, it would make
  death in another form certain for the detective. He could not hope to escape
  the human killer in the night-shrouded woods. He dared not attempt flight
  down the perilous precipice path with no ray of light to reveal its
  pitfalls.</p>

  <p>Relieved breath hissed from between Mervale's teeth. The unbelievable bird
  wheeled, was gliding down again toward the woods. It hadn't seen him. It
  didn't know he was there. It merged with the arboreal shadows&mdash;vanished,
  a nightmare phantasm that could not possibly have been real.</p>

  <p>But it was real. A whiff of fetid, oily odor drifting to him on some
  downward eddy of the wind told him that. Recollection of the burlap-covered
  horror on a porch of paintless, rotting boards told him that.</p>

  <p>He clenched his gun with fingers of ice. Its butt ground into his palm, so
  fiercely that it broke the skin. Mervale didn't feel it. He felt only the
  ponderous mass of the darkness weighing him down. He heard only the muffled
  thud, thud, thud of his own affrighted heart beating against its caging
  ribs...</p>

  <p>He heard a scream, high, and tenuous, and packed with ineffable terror,
  slicing out of the black woods!</p>

  <p>And breaking, abruptly into a single word. "Help!" A despairing, hopeless
  cry in a terror-thinned feminine voice! "Help!"</p>

  <p>It slashed him free from the lashings of fear's paralysis that held him
  rigid. It flung him into the thicket, battling through snatching, ripping
  underbrush, caroming off tree trunks, hurtling toward a threshing tumult
  ahead.</p>

  <p>He catapulted into an unexpected clearing. A vague illumination, light
  only by contrast to the woods' utter darkness, filled it. The sound of
  struggle came from the center of the opening. Mervale glimpsed a flurry of
  combat there, a swaying mass of filmy white and lusterless black.</p>

  <p>He plunged toward it. He dared not shoot, for fear of hitting the woman
  who had cried for help. He thrust his gun into his pocket as he flung
  headlong across the clearing.</p>

  <p>The white was the flutter of a feminine garment. The black was a towering,
  shapeless bulk, grotesquely human-form as a bird with folded wings might
  resemble a human. Mervale battered flailing fists at it.</p>

  <p>His knuckles struck, rebounded from the queasy, revolting feel of oil
  leather. A scream of rage gibbered from the thing. It flung the woman from
  it, twisted to meet the assault it was only now aware of.</p>

  <p>Mervale struck again, again unavailingly. A hooked something flashed out
  from the black swirl. He threw himself backward to avoid the lethal sweep,
  grabbed for his gun.</p>

  <p>The thing lurched toward him, curiously ungainly, awkward. The gun was
  caught in the lining of Mervale's pocket, would not come out.</p>

  <p>The creature was not altogether black. Where its head should be there was
  a pale oval, the blurred, indistinct features of a face&mdash;of <i>a human
  face!</i> This thing that flew and ravaged and killed was possessed of a
  human face.</p>

  <p>The realization robbed Mervale of all capability of movement for a frantic
  instant. The impossible apparition's hooked talon flashed once more. It
  sliced across Mervale's chest, through coat and jacket and shirt, searing him
  with red-hot agony.</p>

  <p>He somersaulted backward, sprawling on the ground. Twisted, lithely,
  leaping to his feet, his gun free at last. It spurted orange-red flame at the
  lunging monster.</p>

  <p>The flash of brilliant light blinded Mervale for a fleeting instant. He
  could see again, at once. The thing was gone. It was not plunging at him. It
  was not floundering, wounded, on the ground. It had
  vanished&mdash;utterly.</p>

  <p>It might have darted into the woods. But no sound came out of that
  interlaced thicket. No threshing of a heavy body forcing its way through. No
  sign that anything alive disturbed the shrubbery.</p>

  <p>Was the thing alive? It was real. It had existence&mdash;no possibility of
  denying that, with the agony of its slash ripping across his chest, wetting
  his skin with seeping blood. But was that existence life, or some strange,
  eerie state of being that enabled it to appear and disappear at will?</p>

  <p>There had been something so outré, so macabre, so utterly beyond
  experience about it. About the shuddersome feel of its skin, the carrion
  stench it exuded, its grotesque shape...</p>

  <p>And its countenance that was a <i>human</i> face!</p>

  <p>These speculations, trailing across Dick Mervale's brain, were interrupted
  by a sobbing whimper that turned him from the darkness. His dilated pupils
  mirrored the prone, white form of the woman he had rescued.</p>

  <p>She lay at the opposite edge of the clearing, a wan, vague form in the
  dimness. She lay so still that she must be badly hurt.</p>

  <p>Mervale moved toward her. He watched the forest, the lowering sky above,
  as he moved. His finger was on the trigger of his gun, and he was taut,
  quivering with apprehension of the thing's return.</p>

  <p>He stood above her, wincing with the pain of his wound, trembling with the
  queasy fear that was unlike any fear he had ever known. There was only
  silence about him, utter silence now; the insects and the woods creatures
  stilled by the crash of combat that had burst among them. There was only the
  faint whimpering at his feet.</p>

  <p>Mervale knelt. His gaze fell to the girl. She was very young. Her gauzy
  frock&mdash;it seemed to be her only garment&mdash;revealed the slim, lissome
  lines of her figure. Where it had been ripped in the struggle he could see
  white, satiny skin seeming to glow by some inner light, and the swelling,
  firm curves of just-budding womanhood.</p>

  <p>Luxuriant hair, blacker than black, made a tumbled cushion for her head.
  In the dimness her face was a pallid mask of pagan beauty, high-cheek boned,
  thin-nostrilled. The quivering lips were dusky-red rose petals. There was a
  smear of blood where the singing line of her throat melted into the misty
  ecstasy of her bosom.</p>

  <p>A cold rage at that which had dared to defile so much beauty choked
  Mervale. His fear was no longer for himself but for her. That he had not been
  in time to save her from the monster. That she was dead...</p>

  <p>A sigh whispered from her. Her eyelids flickered opened...</p>

  <p>Gazing down into their tawny depths Mervale saw again the brooding dread,
  the boding horror, that had made dreadful the bleared eyes of Winburg's
  beleaguered citizens.</p>

  <p>"It's all right," he said, low-toned, comforting. "You're all right. It's
  gone."</p>

  <p>"Gone." A little of the terror faded in the deep pools of her long-lashed
  eyes. Her hand, its fingers white, tapering, lifted to the smear of blood at
  her throat, rubbed.</p>

  <p>The blood rubbed away. There was only a tiny cut beneath it, a cut that
  might have been made by a sharp-pointed tooth, just breaking the skin.</p>

  <p>"That's nothing," Mervale spoke again. "Just a scratch. If that's the
  worst hurt you have..."</p>

  <p>"The worst!" It was a groan, wrenched from her by some obscure dread. Then
  she was sitting up, her movement even from that awkward position
  indescribably graceful. "It's the worst. I&mdash;I must have fainted."</p>

  <p>"Swell!" Mervale spoke with a hearty confidence he did not feel. "We'll
  get you home then. Where is it? What's your name?"</p>

  <p>"Elise."</p>

  <p>"I'm Dick. Come on, Elise, up you get." He must get her to shelter,
  quickly, without alarming her. He slid an arm about her shoulder, lifted.
  Came erect with her, holding her close to him. Holding her warm, soft body to
  him; tingling suddenly, with the electric, prickling sweetness of it.</p>

  <p>"Elise," he breathed. <i>"I..."</i></p>

  <p>The words died on his lips. Mervale froze, staring at the figure that
  stood just within the margin of the clearing.</p>

  <p>It was a little, grey haired man. He held a rifle, its long barrel
  snouting at Mervale and the girl. His scrawny, dungareed body was rigid. And
  his face was the face Fred Harris had recognized on the police circular that
  had placed five thousand dollars within the reach of two bankrupt private
  detectives.</p>

  <p>He was Gorham Carstairs!</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch3"
     name="ch3"></a>III. &mdash; DEATH STALKS THE FOREST</h2>

  <p class="first">IF it had not been for the girl, Dick Mervale might have
  shot it out with the murderer. His gun was in his hand, it would have taken
  only an up-flip of his wrist, a quick pressure on the trigger.</p>

  <p>But Elise was between him and Carstairs. She would be caught in the
  crossfire. She would surely be killed...</p>

  <p>"Elise." Startled, uncomprehending, Mervale realized that Carstairs'
  brooding gaze was fixed on her, not on him. "What are you doing here?"</p>

  <p>"Blackie wa'n't in his kennel, Pop. I were lookin' fer him."</p>

  <p>Pop! Elise was Carstairs' daughter! She was the daughter of the thief, the
  killer Mervale had come to capture. She was...</p>

  <p>"You were looking for a dog&mdash;in the woods at night, without reckoning
  what might happen Elise! Something did! Your dress is torn. I heard a scream,
  a shot..."</p>

  <p>"A panther jumped me. This gentleman shot at it, chased it away. I&mdash;I
  were only scratched a little, Pop. T'aint noth-in'."</p>

  <p>She was lying to her father. Deliberately, without hesitation, without a
  quiver in her voice, she was lying. Why? In God's name why?</p>

  <p>"A panther! You might have been killed." Shock in the old man's voice,
  anxiety, but no doubt. He must know about the ghastly bird-thing that ravaged
  Buzzard Mountain, yet he did not seem to question her assertion that it was
  only a wildcat that had attacked her.</p>

  <p>"Elise was born in these woods. She is as untamed and uncontrollable as
  any of its creatures." Carstairs was speaking to Mervale now. "She simply
  will not realize that it has become dangerous to wander at night on this
  mountain. This time, it seems, she did blunder into danger. I must thank you,
  sir, that it was not worse."</p>

  <p>"I'm glad I could do something."</p>

  <p>What the devil! Carstairs was a hunted fugitive from justice; he had
  killed one of the men who pursued him. Yet he seemed unperturbed by Mervale's
  unexplained presence. He was as suave, as smoothly courteous, as though he
  had nothing at all to fear. But that rifle was very steady in the crook's
  hands. Its muzzle never swayed from its point-blank aim at the detective's
  breast.</p>

  <p>"It was a great deal. I happen to love my daughter, Mr.&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Merton."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Merton, I am grateful to you for saving her. But keeping you out here
  is a poor way of showing that gratitude. Your wound must be taken care of.
  And you must not sleep out in the open. I can offer you shelter of a
  sort."</p>

  <p>That was it, of course. Carstairs wouldn't kill him, unless forced to, in
  the presence of his daughter. He was stalling till he could get the detective
  alone. But he was taking no chances. Any untoward move on Mervale's part
  would bring steel-jacketed death winging from that unwavering rifle.</p>

  <p>"Thank you." Mervale imitated the other's amazing calm. "You are
  kind."</p>

  <p>"We had better get going. Oh&mdash;your pistol! Elise is as familiar with
  it as you are, and she would be quicker to scent any prowling animal on the
  way. Give it to her, please."</p>

  <p>There was a sudden steely note of command in his voice and there was
  nothing to do but obey. The moment when Mervale might have made a fight of it
  was past. The detective disarmed himself, his lips twitching with a wry
  smile, stood waiting for the next move.</p>

  <p>"The path is narrow, Mr. Merton, and we shall have to go in single file.
  Elise will lead the way. You follow her and I will bring up the rear."</p>

  <p>"You're the boss." Mervale shrugged. He understood the little man's plan.
  A shot in the back, excused as an accident&mdash;the result of a stumble, of
  a twig catching the rifle's trigger. Neat. Very neat.</p>

  <p>Would they bury him deep enough, Dick Mervale wondered, to foil the
  buzzards?</p>

  <p>The girl's lissome form was a pale glimmer gliding into the black mystery
  of the thicket with eerie soundlessness. Mervale sensed by feel alone that he
  was in a steadily descending path. The dense, throbbing darkness closed in on
  him. The wind had died down, but his feet stirred up a dank, earthy odor, the
  smell of putrefaction and death. The smell of the tomb.</p>

  <p>It was to be his tomb, this haunted forest...</p>

  <p>A muscle twitched in his biceps. His eyes slitted, and wrath was a tight
  band constricting his temples. Wrath at himself for having allowed himself to
  be so easily overcome. Fiery wrath at the man who had killed his friend, who
  was about to kill him.</p>

  <p>And underneath it there was a quiver of gelid fear, only
  half-acknowledged, that was not fear of Carstairs' rifle or of Mervale's own
  automatic in the girl's hand. It seeped through him from the woods
  themselves, that lay hushed and tense in the spell of a strange dread. Memory
  of the thing he had seen and fought flooded back on him, of the gigantic
  bird-shape that had the face of a man!</p>

  <p>The feel of it was still on his knuckles, of the oily, leathery skin that
  was not skin...</p>

  <p>Elise's vague form was suddenly blotted out by blackness!</p>

  <p>An exclamation tightened Mervale's larynx, unuttered as the feathery touch
  of leaves against his arm told him the path had twisted to the right. He went
  around the bend...</p>

  <p>Then he dived, his muscles exploding like unleashed springs, into the
  underbrush to the side of the path! If Elise had been momentarily hidden from
  him, taking that bend, he was briefly as much screened from Carstairs!
  Realization and act had been almost simultaneous as Mervale seized the one
  tenuous, thousand-to-one chance of escape.</p>

  <p>He threshed through the whipping, searing thicket, the noise of his
  passage thunderous. He pounded hard on dank loam, slithered away from the
  spot where he had fallen, his every cell recoiling from the expected blast of
  gunfire, from the smashing impact of the bullets Carstairs must inevitably
  loose at his flight.</p>

  <p>They did not come! Mervale lay flattened against the earth, holding his
  breath till his lungs were tortured, waiting for probing slashes of
  steel-jacketed death that did not come.</p>

  <p>"Pop!" he heard, instead, Elise's startled cry. "Pop! He&mdash;he jumped
  into the woods. He&mdash;he's run away."</p>

  <p>And Carstairs low, unsurprised reply. "I rather expected it. When I asked
  him to come home with us he looked as if he'd like to refuse but didn't dare.
  Well, if he'd rather take a chance with a night on Buzzard Mountain, that's
  his own lookout."</p>

  <p>"But he doesn't know what it means, Pop. He doesn't know about&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"About what, Elise?" Carstairs purred the question, and there was a
  curious, ominous quality to his voice.</p>

  <p>"The wildcats, Pop." Elise found speech once more, but Mervale knew she
  lied. That was not what she had started to say.</p>

  <p>Carstairs laughed, shortly, humorlessly. "Of course he knows about those."
  Had he put the slightest, most elusive, of emphasis on the last word? "You
  told me he saved you from one, just now. If he wants to take his chances with
  them we should not interfere."</p>

  <p>"But..."</p>

  <p>"But nothing. He<i>&mdash;What's that?"</i> Abrupt, sheer terror in those
  two words. <i>"What was that sound?"</i> And then sudden, shuddering silence
  out there where the two had been talking.</p>

  <p>Silence from them, but Mervale heard that which had brought the silence.
  Overhead it was a faint, hissing whisper. Like the wind flowing over silent
  wings. And a smell threaded the earthy aroma of the forest; a fetid, oily
  smell. The smell of the flying fear.</p>

  <p>"Run, Elise!" Carstairs' cry was a thin, terror-filled scream. "Run for
  the house. Come on."</p>

  <p>She answered him with a throaty whimper. Then a burst of sound told
  Mervale that they were running through the brush, scuttering like a pair of
  rabbits from the hovering doom that threatened them. Only briefly he heard
  the sound of their flight, then there was the sharp slam of a door, and the
  rattle of hastily thrown bolts.</p>

  <p>The forest was hushed once more, cringing under the shadow of dread that
  drifted aloft on black wings. Mervale cowered, flat against the damp loam,
  his throat dry, his blood a slow, dark flow in his veins.</p>

  <p>No wonder Carstairs had not fired at the sound of him in the thicket.
  There had been no need to betray himself thus. He had left the manhunter to a
  surer, more horrible death, to the rending talons and ripping beak of the
  monstrous materialization of evil that guarded the fugitive on Buzzard
  Mountain far more efficiently than whistling lead.</p>

  <p>But it had no beak! It had a mouth, the mouth of a man. Mervale recalled
  the shuddersome thing he had seen, the vague, blurred oval of a human face
  that had been the countenance of the thing from which he had rescued Elise.
  What was it? In the name of all that is holy, what was it? What freak of
  nature, or of forces at odds with nature itself?</p>

  <p>There was some shelter here. The dark tree-boughs were interlaced
  overhead, too closely for any flying thing with a twelve-foot wing-spread to
  penetrate. If he remained here he had a chance to survive. But Dick Mervale,
  unarmed, helpless, started moving, started crawling towards where he had
  heard a door slammed and bolted against the black threat.</p>

  <p>He moved slowly, with infinite caution. The throbbing wound across his
  chest made each inch of progress a separate agony. His fear of the
  night-borne flier was a viscous, invisible miasma through which he must force
  his limbs. There were more material things against which he had to struggle;
  thorns that caught him, that lacerated him, vines like unbreakable wire he
  must creep beneath, impenetrable darkness.</p>

  <p>A shimmer of light through a leafy veil ahead of him warned Mervale to
  even more cautious progress. Then there was only a tenuous screen between him
  and a treeless space more extensive than the glade where he had fought the
  monster.</p>

  <p>It was level. There were buildings in it. A small, squat shed, black and
  deserted-appearing, hunched close to the dim grey loom of a precipitous rock
  some thirty yards high. Another was a great deal larger, though still of only
  one story. It was from this that the light came, from a shaded window that
  was a yellow, wavering oblong against the black wall of the forest that
  hemmed in the clearing except where the perpendicular cliff face completed
  it.</p>

  <p>This was Gorham Carstairs' lair. The skin tightened along Mervale's jaw,
  and his hands fisted till his nails dug into their palms. There, not twenty
  feet away, must be the man he had sworn to capture. But he was armed. He was
  behind a bolted door. More insuperable than these, that open space lay
  between. Once out there a man would be exposed to the swoop of the Satanic
  hawk that hunted human beings.</p>

  <p>Mervale's eyes travelled along the cabin wall. There was another window,
  unlighted. There was a door, a blacker rectangle against the blackness of the
  wall...</p>

  <p>A flicker of movement pulled Mervale's eyes back to the illuminated
  window. It was a shadow that moved across the shade, the slender silhouette
  of Elise, her virginal curves clearly outlined.</p>

  <p>There was a tightening in his throat of pity, of longing. In that poignant
  instant Dick Mervale knew with a certitude somehow terrible that he had
  fallen in love with Elise Carstairs.</p>

  <p>Strange irony, that after years of bachelorhood he gave his heart to the
  daughter of the murderer of his best friend...</p>

  <p>Mervale crouched in the scanty shelter of the clearing edge. Dared he
  chance crossing the clearing, lighted now only by cloud-filtered moonlight,
  and try to gain entrance to the house? Perhaps the winged monster was gone,
  seeking its nightly victim in the valley. Perhaps...</p>

  <p>The soft hiss of wind on a leathery wing, the fetid odor of leathery oil,
  dashed that hope. And then Mervale saw the thing again.</p>

  <p>It poised for a moment, a tremendous shadow of dread in the murk, the
  paradoxical pale oval of its man's countenance a mask of death in the shadow
  of its wings. Mervale watched it, shuddering with a glacial fear such as he
  had never known. He watched the great wings fold, watched the ungainly,
  gigantic body swerve and begin to move, awkward but strangely silent, toward
  the cabin. Toward the very window behind which Elise Carstairs lay.</p>

  <p>Metal snapped. There was the rasp of wood on wood. There was a blotch of
  black against the wan rectangle of the window into Elise's room.</p>

  <p><i>The Thing was climbing into that room.</i> Baffled on its first
  attempt, it had returned for a new attack on the girl!</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch4"
     name="ch4"></a>IV. &mdash; OUT OF THE GRAVE</h2>

  <p class="first">DICK MERVALE shouted something unintelligible. Somehow he
  was across the clearing. Somehow he was the center of a flurry of mad combat,
  of a dizzy whirlwind of battering, leathery wings that clubbed him, of a
  floundering, oily body into which his fists thumped, and thumped and seemed
  to have no effect except to bruise themselves.</p>

  <p>Red-hot fire ripped his shoulder, his side. He held his head down, taking
  the buffetings on the top of his skull, striving to protect his eyes. That
  was a mistake. A terrific blow crashed on the back of his neck. It smashed
  the darkness into his brain. He went down into a weltering, swirling
  darkness.</p>

  <p>Just as consciousness left him he heard a scream, and the blast of a shot.
  Then oblivion claimed him...</p>

  <p>A stygian-feathered buzzard perched on Mervale's chest, keeping its
  balance by the fierce grip of its talons. Its beak tore strips from his
  shoulder, his side. It would not be so bad, he thought, if it would eat more
  rapidly. But this leisurely ripping away of quarter-inch wide lengths of
  bleeding flesh was unbearable torture.</p>

  <p>He was dead, and he shouldn't feel the pain. He felt it, therefore he was
  not dead. If the buzzard knew he wasn't dead it would stop eating him. He
  must tell him. He must... but it was so hard to say anything. His best
  efforts produced only a wordless moan.</p>

  <p>The buzzard was gone, but not the pain. A flower had replaced it, a tiny
  yellow flower that danced where the left tip of the bird's wing had been. It
  wasn't a flower. It was a candle-flame. The candle was stuck upright in a
  little mound of its own drippings, on a debris-cluttered floor. Mervale was
  lying on the same floor. He was in a cell-like room, walled by planed, uneven
  logs. There wasn't any furniture in as much of the room as he could see. But
  there was an odor in the room, the odor of grease-smeared leather.</p>

  <p>The nauseating smell was strong, overpowering, in here. As consciousness
  and memory grew stronger in Mervale's brain he knew why. This was the lair of
  the thing he had attacked, the thing that had overpowered him. It had not
  killed him at once. It had carried him here, so that it could destroy him in
  its own sweet time.</p>

  <p>Mervale rolled, his terror giving him strength to roll&mdash;and there it
  was! His hands flailed against the splintered flooring, thrusting him up to a
  sitting position.</p>

  <p>It wasn't the monster that stared at him. It was a man, stiffly erect, his
  eyes light-less, glazed. It was&mdash;<i>Fred Harris!</i></p>

  <p>Mervale's icy lips moved. "Fred," he husked. "Fred! Why are you looking at
  me like that? Why...?"</p>

  <p>Fred didn't answer him. He didn't move, not so much as a finger. There was
  something wrong about his fingers, on his left hand. They were too short.
  They were red.</p>

  <p>Good God! They were bitten, gnawed away!</p>

  <p>Dick Mervale's hand beat on the floor, hard. He was trying to hurt
  himself, trying to wake himself out of this nightmare. Trying to banish the
  terrible dream.</p>

  <p>It was a dream, of course. Fred couldn't be here. He was dead. He was a
  thousand feet below, buried under dead leaves and heavy rocks. He was dead,
  but he was here. He was standing...</p>

  <p>No! He wasn't standing, he was <i>hanging</i> here. His feet didn't quite
  reach the floor. He was hanging from&mdash;Mervale saw a row of curved meat
  hooks along the wall, level with Fred Harris' neck. There must be another
  hook like those, behind that neck, jabbed into it. Fred's corpse was hung
  there on a meat hook, like the carcass of a slaughtered beef, ready for the
  butcher's knife!</p>

  <p>Red rage at this desecration of the dead burst inside Mervale's skull,
  hurled him to his feet. An oath choked him, erupted from him. He sprang to
  the violated corpse, lifted it from the hook, laid it gently on the floor. He
  straightened...</p>

  <p>There was a high, small window in the wall of the room. A gridiron of iron
  showed across it, in the dancing, eerie candlelight&mdash;a checkerboard of
  bars thick as a big man's thumb, welded together at their junctures. He could
  see that their ends were sunk deep into the framework of the window.</p>

  <p>There was a door too, opposite the window. It was a single slab of wood.
  Mervale hurled himself to it, twisted its knob. It was locked. He had
  expected it to be locked.</p>

  <p>He fell back panting, shaken and sick with his futile efforts. Sick with
  realization that he was a prisoner here, with his dead friend, helplessly
  immured in this place that must be the slaughter-house of the man-bird.</p>

  <p>Sounds came in to Mervale, through the barred window. The rustle of
  wind-stirred leaves. A curious, snick, snick, like the sound a canary's bill
  had once made as he watched the yellow bird eat&mdash;save that this was
  preposterously, grotesquely magnified, till the crackling of seeds was
  changed to the crunching of bones. The bird with the face of a man was
  feeding, out there.</p>

  <p><i>On what?</i> On the tender flesh, the fragile bones, of Elise
  Carstairs?</p>

  <p>The thought stabbed at his mind, and for a moment he was wholly mad. He
  darted to the wall where the window was, leaped. His fingers caught the bars,
  pulled him up to them. He perched like a baboon on the sill, peered
  through.</p>

  <p>Blank greyness met his eyes. The greyness of perpendicular stone, of the
  cliff-like rock that had closed in one side of the clearing where Gorham
  Carstairs lived. He must be in the shack he had glimpsed, cowering under it.
  He was alone in it, with his dead friend, while Satan alone knew what horror
  was being perpetrated out there.</p>

  <p>The scrape of a key, a rattle behind him, pulled Mervale down to the floor
  again. The sounds came from the door. Someone&mdash;or
  <i>something</i>&mdash;was about to enter.</p>

  <p>Mervale sprang across the floor. Just as the key clicked over, he grabbed
  the doorknob with shaking fingers, braced his feet against the jamb on either
  side.</p>

  <p>The knob twisted in his grip. He held it, arching his back, held it
  against the force that was pulling at it, that was trying to pull the door
  open. Even as he clung there, he knew that it was useless. He was weak,
  terribly weak. The <i>thing</i> had been terribly strong, the buffets of its
  wings sledgehammer blows. How could he hope to hold the door...?</p>

  <p>"Mr. Merton." Amazingly it was Elise's voice that called to him through
  the thick wood. "Dick." The voice of the girl he had loved at first sight,
  and thought dead, worse than dead. "Let me in. Hurry&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She was alive, but she was in danger. Mervale swung open the door. Elise
  jumped in, and he slammed it shut again.</p>

  <p>"We've got to get it locked again," he grunted. "Where's the key?"</p>

  <p>"Outside. In the lock." Her thin cotton nightgown was high-collared, fell
  to her ankles. But it clung to her, made her more tempting, somehow, more
  desirable. Even though shaken by terror of the thing that ravaged mountain
  and valley, which was somewhere just outside, Mervale's pulses throbbed in
  his wrists and his arms ached to sweep around her. "I'll get it." He pushed
  the door open a little, slid a hand out, had the key. The door closed
  again&mdash;slid the key into the inner side of the lock.</p>

  <p>"No!" Amazingly she caught at his hand, trying to stop him. "No. We've got
  to get out there. We've got to hunt for Pop. I can't find Pop. I'm
  afraid..."</p>

  <p>"The thing's got him. Maybe it has. I hope it has."</p>

  <p>Anger boiled up once more in Mervale's brain. "I'm not worrying about him.
  It's you I want to keep safe. You, Elise." He heard the massive bolt grate
  into its receptacle.</p>

  <p>"Dick! Please!" She was clinging to him. Her little face turned up to
  his.</p>

  <p>His arms slid around her. She was close to him. Her warm breath played on
  his face, the sweet fragrance of her was in his nostrils. He felt a fire
  within her that lit an answering fire within him. His lips found her lips,
  drank greedily of the honey there. Nothing mattered, in that moment, save
  that.</p>

  <p>A soft, scraping sound meant nothing to Mervale. She pulled a little away
  from him, still nestling in his arms. "You will help me, my dear. You will
  help my father."</p>

  <p>"There isn't any use," he said, hoarsely, thinking of the crunching he had
  heard through the barred window. "We wouldn't stand a chance
  against&mdash;against the bird. We can't save him."</p>

  <p>"I saved you." Her eyes were brown flame. "I heard you outside my window.
  I still had your gun. I shot at it. I didn't hit it, but it went away. Then I
  climbed out. I dragged you here, locked the door so that it couldn't get to
  you. I ran back to the house an'..." She hesitated.</p>

  <p>"And what?"</p>

  <p>"An' Pop wasn't there. I called, and called but he didn't answer.
  Then&mdash;then I saw the light of your candle agin' the rock, an' I knew you
  must of come to. I ran back here to get you to help."</p>

  <p>"You didn't light the candle?"</p>

  <p>"Why no. Didn't you?"</p>

  <p>Mervale didn't answer. He asked another question instead. "Did you leave
  the key in the door?'</p>

  <p>"Of course not. I took it with me."</p>

  <p>Someone had been in here after her. Had he brought Fred's body here then?
  Could a bird use a key, even if it had the face of a man? There was something
  incongruous here. If she were telling the truth...</p>

  <p><i>The door was moving!</i> Mervale saw it over the girl's shoulder, flung
  her to one side, remembering in that moment of terror the scraping sound he
  had disregarded, that he knew now had been the key turning in the lock.
  Turning under <i>her</i> hand, as she kissed him!</p>

  <p>The door flung open. A black figure lunged in. Not the bird. A man,
  dressed in some close fitting garment of black&mdash;Gorham Carstairs!</p>

  <p>"Pop!" Elise screamed. "Pop..."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch5"
     name="ch5"></a>V. &mdash; MAGDALENE!</h2>

  <p class="first">THERE was something in Carstairs' hand. It lashed at
  Mervale, a reptilian whiplash of oxhide. It curled around his waist, flung
  him backwards to crash against the wall, slithered from him.</p>

  <p>"Wanton!" the man hissed. "Magdalene!" The whiplash was a grey haze, so
  fast did it move. It reached Elise, snipped a long tear in her nightgown, not
  touching her skin. "I knew it was no dog you hunted in the woods. I'll kill
  you..."</p>

  <p>Mervale sprang, his hands fisting. The whip met him, gashing him, hurling
  him back. It flicked back to the attack on Elise.</p>

  <p>He sprang again. Dizzy, blind almost with pain, he sprang again to divert
  Carstairs' terrible weapon from the girl. But this time he ducked low as the
  snaking lash reached for him, so that it came down on his back, pounding him
  to the ground. The momentum of his dive carried him to Carstairs' feet. He
  smelled fetid, oiled leather.</p>

  <p>It was Carstairs' strange garment that smelled thus? Was it a garment, or
  his skin? Was he the monster and had he appeared in the midst of some strange
  metamorphosis...</p>

  <p>"Flay you to death," he grunted. "My daughter a wanton. Skulking night
  after night into the wood for carnal delight." The whip cracked again.
  Elise's arm was sleeved with blood.</p>

  <p>"Stop." The word was wrung from Mervale by horror. "Don't..." He realized
  that he was making no sound, that his protest was only a husked rasp. It was
  Elise's shriek that rang out, knife-edged with unendurable pain.</p>

  <p>Mervale's teeth bit through his lips, his blood salty on his tongue. He
  tried to thrust knees, elbows, down on the floor, to somehow lift himself, to
  somehow fling himself at the homicidal maniac that was beating his daughter
  to death. He managed to get his head up...</p>

  <p>He saw the sudden black swoop of something in through the door. He saw
  black wings spread wide, and close again, folding around Carstairs!</p>

  <p>It was Carstairs who screamed now, as the whip flew from his nerveless
  hand. The sound of that scream was the cry of a soul plunged into hell's
  deepest caldron. It pierced deep into Mervale, dissipated the paralysis that
  had held him helpless.</p>

  <p>The whip had fallen near him. He snatched it up, leaped to his feet,
  flailed it at the black, swaying mass out of which that terrible scream still
  came.</p>

  <p>The lash staggered the monster. A curious crackle, as of breaking small
  bones mingled with its report. The man-bird dropped its victim, twisted to
  meet Mervale's berserk attack. A seamed, grey face stared out from between
  the towering black wings, a face convulsed, distorted by utter evil. The face
  of Satan himself. Mervale's whip cracked across it, and it was a scarlet
  mask.</p>

  <p>A curved, scythe-like knife arced at him. He ducked it, slashed again with
  the whistling whip that was so terrible a weapon. It caught the monster
  squarely around the neck, made a noose that Mervale drew tight. Then he
  pulled, pulled...</p>

  <p>The thing that was a bird and a man, and neither, collapsed, thumping to
  the ground in the midst of a vast snapping. It lay there, a still, shapeless
  mass of black, oily leather, through rips in which protruded the broken
  splinters of&mdash;not bones but split bamboo sticks!</p>

  <p>Then it was that Dick Mervale began to get a glimmering of the truth. The
  monster, the thing that had ravaged Winburg, that had made night a horror on
  Buzzard Mountain, was a man. His wings were the wings of a glider, a
  motorless monoplane more efficient than any yet displayed at the air meets,
  yet in principle no different from them.</p>

  <p>Elise, naked, blood-smeared from head to foot, was crawling across the
  floor. She reached the mangled, torn form of Gorham Carstairs, lifted the
  head whose grey hair was blood-matted, whose skin was waxen already with
  approaching death.</p>

  <p>"Pop," she moaned. "Pop, I'm not&mdash;I'm not what you said. We&mdash;we
  only kissed. We didn't do anything else."</p>

  <p>Lips that were scarlet with viscid life-fluid moved. "You wouldn't lie to
  a dying man, Elise. You wouldn't..."</p>

  <p>"No, Pop. As God is my witness..."</p>

  <p>"Then forgive me, as He will forgive me. Forgive me for the terrible thing
  I did to you."</p>

  <p>"They's nothin' to forgive, Pop. You had a right&mdash;by the law of the
  hills."</p>

  <p>"I tried to do my best for you, Elise. I tried to make up to you the wrong
  I did when I abandoned you, a babe in your mother's arms, to go out and make
  money enough to develop the coal mine under Buzzard Mountain. It took so
  long, Elise, so eternally long. Then I got word of the trouble in Winburg,
  and I knew that your Uncle Saul was tired of waiting, and was trying to drive
  the people away from Buzzard so that he would not have to pay for the lands
  where the vein runs near the surface.</p>

  <p>"You see, I remembered how he used to lie and study the buzzards. I
  remembered he once said how a man could fly like they did, and how he could
  do most anything he had a mind to, without fear of being caught, if he did
  that.</p>

  <p>"I knew he was the flying fear that terrorized Winburg. So I stole fifty
  thousand dollars, Elise, to buy the lands with so he would stop."</p>

  <p>"Pop! You didn't steal it. You didn't..."</p>

  <p>"Yes, daughter. I stole from the foreigners, for my own people. But when I
  came home I found that the killing, and maybe the flying, had made Saul a
  devil. He was doing it for his own sake, now, not for the mine."</p>

  <p>"I knew, Pop. But I didn't think you did. I didn't want you to know. I was
  trying to make him stop. He wouldn't listen to me, but he wouldn't hurt me.
  Till tonight.</p>

  <p>"Something queer came over him tonight. He was terrible."</p>

  <p>"That was because he saw two foreigners riding along the Winburg road, and
  before I could stop him he shot one of them from the top of the cliffs.
  Somehow that gave the last bit of him to Satan. He would have slain anyone
  then. You or me. He&mdash;he did kill me, didn't he? He did! He threatened to
  when I tried to argue him out of going down for the foreigner's body.</p>

  <p>"He was going to start a trophy room in here, he said..."</p>

  <p>"Pop!" The one word was breathed horror.</p>

  <p>"Yes. He&mdash;Saul&mdash;" The fingers of death closed on Gorham
  Carstairs' throat. They squeezed blood from his lips&mdash;and then he was
  very still.</p>

  <p>A sob tore from his daughter's throat. Then she too was very silent, very
  still. The people of the hills do not bemoan their dead.</p>

  <p>Dick Mervale turned away, feeling that to look any longer at the grief on
  her face would be blasphemy.</p>

  <p>But he whirled, again, at the sudden clang of metal.</p>

  <p>Elise had the scythe-like knife in her hand. She had lifted it, was
  plunging it into her breast!</p>

  <p>Mervale's flying leap across the room was in time, just in time, to dash
  the blade from her hand. "Why did you do that?" he grunted, swaying on the
  knees to which he had thudded. "Why did you want to kill yourself?"</p>

  <p>She looked at him queerly. "'Cause a good woman dassn't be seen naked
  'cept by her husband, an' live. Thet's th' law o' the hills."</p>

  <p>"Except by her husband." Mervale managed a smile, in the midst of that
  shambles. "Elise&mdash;dear... is it all right, by your law, if the man who
  sees a good woman naked becomes her husband right after that?"</p>

  <p>He did not need any answer other than the light in her eyes.</p>
